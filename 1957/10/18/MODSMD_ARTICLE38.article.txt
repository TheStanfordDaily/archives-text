CLOTHES MAKE THE BMOC
Last week we passed along some fashion hints for
coeds. Today we will do the same for college men.
The most important thing to remember, gentlemen,
is to dress with verve, with dash, with inventiveness.
Don't he imprisoned by the traditional conservatism
of men's clothing. Brighten up your appearance with
a single earring, or a cavalry saber, or a gold derby.

However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance,
you are wearing a gold derby, do not also wear a cavalry
saber. This is too much. Wear a dagger instead, or, for
formal occasions, a bowie knife.
Lot us turn now to a persistent rumor that a gar
ment called the "suit" is on the verge of making a
comeback. Some of you older students may remember
this "suit." Jt was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
and trousers, both of which —this'll kill you—both of
which were made out of the same material!
The last "suit" ever seen on an American campus
was in 1941 —and J ought to know because I was
wearing it. I was an undergraduate then, and in love
—hopelessly in love with a beauteous statistics major
named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one of the two girls I
have ever known named Harry. The other one is her
sister.)
1 loved Harry madly, though her expensive tastes
were the ruin of me. Bit by bit 1 sold off my belong
ings to pursue this costly courtship—first my books,
then my clothes, until finally 1 was left with nothing
to wear but a "suit". One night J came calling for her
in this garment and she, of course, slashed me across
the face with a riding crop and sent, me from her door.
I slunk home and lit a Marlboro and sat down to
think. I always light a Marlboro when I sit down to
think, for their good mild flavor is a great aid to cere
bration. 1 always light a Marlboro when 1 don't sit
down to think, too, because Marlboro is my favorite
cigarette, and I know it will be yours, too, once you
make the acquaintance of thai- filter, that flavor, that
fliptop box. As the man says, you get a lot to like with
a Marlboro.
Well, sirs, smoking and thinking thus, my eye hap
pened to fall on an ad in a campus newspaper which
said: "WIN A COMPLETE WARDROBE! Touhy's
Toggery, the campus's leading men's store, announces
a contest to pick the best-dressed man on campus. The
winner will receive absolutely free a complete new
wardrobe!"
Struck bv a sudden inspiration, T took pen in hand
and wrote a letter to Mr. Touhy of Touhy's Toggery:
"Sir—I see by the paper that you are giving a com
plete new wardrobe to the best-dressed man on cam
pus. What a ridiculous idea!
"Obviously, to be the best-dressed man on campus,
you must first have a lot of clothes, and if you have a
lot of clothes, what do you need with another wardrobe?
"Touhy's Toggery should give a new wardrobe to
the worst-dressed man on campus. Me, for instance.
1 am an eyesore. There isn't a crow in town that will
come near me. Three times this month the Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire has
canceled my subscription.
"I submit that a vote for mo is a vote for reason, a
vote for equity, a vote for the American way!"
With a flourish I signed the letter and sent it off,
somehow feeling certain that very soon I would be
wearing a complete new wardrobe.
And I was right—because two weeks later I was
drafted. O Mm Shulman, 1057
.4limits fashionable, altcat/s correct fur any occasion, is the
briphl red and white flip-lop box of Marlborott, made for
your pleasure bit the sponsors of litis column.

this "suit." Jt was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
and trousers, both of which —this'll kill you—both of
which were made out of the same material!
The last "suit" ever seen on an American campus
was in 1941 —and J ought to know because I was
wearing it. I was an undergraduate then, and in love
—hopelessly in love with a beauteous statistics major
named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one of the two girls I
have ever known named Harry. The other one is her
sister.)
1 loved Harry madly, though her expensive tastes
were the ruin of me. Bit by bit 1 sold off my belong
ings to pursue this costly courtship—first my books,
then my clothes, until finally 1 was left with nothing
to wear but a "suit". One night J came calling for her
in this garment and she, of course, slashed me across
the face with a riding crop and sent, me from her door.
I slunk home and lit a Marlboro and sat down to
think. I always light a Marlboro when I sit down to
think, for their good mild flavor is a great aid to cere
bration. 1 always light a Marlboro when 1 don't sit
down to think, too, because Marlboro is my favorite
cigarette, and I know it will be yours, too, once you
make the acquaintance of thai- filter, that flavor, that
fliptop box. As the man says, you get a lot to like with
a Marlboro.
Well, sirs, smoking and thinking thus, my eye hap
pened to fall on an ad in a campus newspaper which
said: "WIN A COMPLETE WARDROBE! Touhy's
Toggery, the campus's leading men's store, announces
a contest to pick the best-dressed man on campus. The
winner will receive absolutely free a complete new
wardrobe!"
Struck bv a sudden inspiration, T took pen in hand
and wrote a letter to Mr. Touhy of Touhy's Toggery:
"Sir—I see by the paper that you are giving a com
plete new wardrobe to the best-dressed man on cam
pus. What a ridiculous idea!
"Obviously, to be the best-dressed man on campus,
you must first have a lot of clothes, and if you have a
lot of clothes, what do you need with another wardrobe?
"Touhy's Toggery should give a new wardrobe to
the worst-dressed man on campus. Me, for instance.
1 am an eyesore. There isn't a crow in town that will
come near me. Three times this month the Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire has
canceled my subscription.
"I submit that a vote for mo is a vote for reason, a
vote for equity, a vote for the American way!"
With a flourish I signed the letter and sent it off,
somehow feeling certain that very soon I would be
wearing a complete new wardrobe.
And I was right—because two weeks later I was
drafted. O Mm Shulman, 1057

coeds. Today we will do the same for college men.
The most important thing to remember, gentlemen,
is to dress with verve, with dash, with inventiveness.
Don't he imprisoned by the traditional conservatism
of men's clothing. Brighten up your appearance with
a single earring, or a cavalry saber, or a gold derby.

However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance,
you are wearing a gold derby, do not also wear a cavalry
saber. This is too much. Wear a dagger instead, or, for
formal occasions, a bowie knife.
