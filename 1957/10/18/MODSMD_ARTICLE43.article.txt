"The thing 1 that has impressed me most in my two
years at General Electric," says 28-year-old Yusuf A.
Yoler, manager of Aerodynamics Laboratory Inves
tigations, "is the challenging opportunity open to
young people here. My field is guided-missile research
— (he nation's top-priority defense job. Because of
the scope of the company's research and development
program, I've had the opportunity to work with tech
nical experts in many related fields. And I've seen
at first hand the responsibility which General Electric
has given to younger men — proof to me that in a
big company a young man can get to tackle big jobs."
The research being done by Dr. Yusuf A. Yoler is
significant not only to himself, but to General Electric
and the security of the nation as well. At present, the
company is participating as a prime contractor on
three of the four long-range ballistic missiles pro-

gramed by the U. S. government. Yoler, who is play
ing an important role in this work, directed I he design
and development of the world's largest hypersonic
shock tunnel — a device which will "test-fly" missile
nose cones at speeds over 15,000 mph.
Progress in research and development — as well as
in every other field of endeavor depends on how well
young minds meet the challenge of self-development.
At General Electric there are more than 20,000 col
lege graduates, each of whom is given the opportunity
to develop to his fullest abilities. In this way, we.be
lieve, everybody benefits — the individual, the com
pany, and the country.
