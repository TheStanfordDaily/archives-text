# 60-Voice Choir Provides Church, Special Music
## Singers Seldom Seen; New Reddish Gowns Complement Color Scheme 
### Camille Petersen 
A group seldom seen but often heard by those attending Memorial
Church services is the 60-voice Stanford University Choir. The choir
is composed of undergraduate and graduate students and former
members of choral organizations at Stanford.
This year the choir is bedecked in new red gowns. The money for
the robes came from gift funds presented to the University and alio-

cated by the president for this
purpose.
The red for the robes was taken
from a color in the west window
of Memorial Church so that the
new robes would blend into the
color scheme of the church. The
cloth used was made especially
for this purpose. The new robes
replace the old maroon gowns,
which had been in use sinec 1946.

members of choral organizations at Stanford.
This year the choir is bedecked in new red gowns. The money for
the robes came from gift funds presented to the University and alio-

cated by the president for this
purpose.
The red for the robes was taken
from a color in the west window
of Memorial Church so that the
new robes would blend into the
color scheme of the church. The
cloth used was made especially
for this purpose. The new robes
replace the old maroon gowns,
which had been in use sinec 1946.
Great Heritage
Primary objectives of the choir
are to supply music necessary
to carry on the University church
services and to acquaint Stanford
students with the great heritage
of Christian church music.
Harold C. Schmidt, choirmaster,
works with Chaplain Robert Min
to to plan music which will en
hance the worship of students,
faculty, visitors and community
people who attend the services of
the church.
The choir presents special serv
ices such as services of praise and
Christmas Christmas carol con
certs, memorial services such as
for the late Dr. Donald Tresidder,
former president of Stanford, and
inauguration services for all new
University presidents.
For the last three years the
choir has appeared on the fresh
■ man convocation program and for
the last two years has sung with
the San Francisco Symphony un
der the direction of maestro En
rique Jorda.
Combined Choirs
Several church choirs of Palo
Alto combine -with the Stanford
Choir on two occasions during the
year.
In the past the choir made an
hour's tape used on the United
Northern California Protestant
Church program over CBS. The
choir has been heard over NBC at
Easter time.
University organist Herbert
Nanney accompanies the choir.
During his leave of absence this
quarter he is being replaced by
acting University organist Donald
