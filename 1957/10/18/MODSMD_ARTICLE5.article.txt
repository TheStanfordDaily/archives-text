# Russian Space Rocket Gains 23 Minutes On ’Sputnik'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—Russia's
space rocket was reported by
observers yesterday to be whirl
ing along the skyways some 23
minutes ahead of the satellite it
propelled into an orbit 13 days
ago.
Three moon watchers at the
Harvard Observatory spotted
the satellite at 5:17 a.m. (EST)
at a point in the sky where the
third-stage rocket had passed at
4:54 a.m.—some 23 minutes ear
lier.
Scientists have said this indi

cates the rocket itself is moving
nearer and nearer the earth in
ever smaller circles; that its
speed increases as its orbit con
tracts.
There #vere differences of
opinion on how soon the rocket
would move into earth atmos
phere heavy enough to plow it
downward in'flames.
British astronomer A. C. B.
Lovcll said in Manchester, Eng
land, he is convinced "something
catastrophic" will happen to the

rocket very soon—possibly in a
day or two.
But Dr. Fred L. Whipple, head
of the Smithsonian Astrophysi
cal Observatory at Cambridge,
Mass., said the rocket will stay
up for at least two months.
As for the satellite itself, hurl
ed aloft by the Soviets Oct. 4,
Whipple said its life expectancy
could not be forecast at this
time.
Presumably it is continuing
along at an 18,000-mile-an-hour
pace in a track considerably out

ward of the rocket's orbit.
The rocket is due to make
three more early-morning passes
across U.S. skies today. On its
third trip it is to pass over Men
d o c in o, Calif., at 4:59 a.m.
(PST).
Scientists at Cambridge said
that in a few days the rocket
could be seen in the evening as
it moves northward on the other
leg of its orbit. In about 10 days
it may show up both morning
and evening in New England.
Further information on Rus

sian plans for future rockets
came from Christian Clausen,
science editor for the Los An
geles Examiner.
He said the Russians plan an
attempt to hit the moon Nov. 7.
Clausen said the information
came from a European scientist
who talked with rocket experts
who had escaped from a missile
base in East Germany.
The Russians, Clausen wrote,
will aim three rockets at the
moon from a Caspian Sea base,
and if at least one hits that tar

get they will announce their suc
cess. If they miss, he wrote,
they will try three more, and
then three more. If these miss,
they will do further calculating.
"The first Soviet moon rock
ets will be unmanned," Clausen
wrote, "but if they are success
ful with their first vehicles the
Russians plan to send animals
and then men to the moon."
Representative Patterson (R-
Conn.) said the Soviets are pre
paring to launch 95 more rock
ets before the end of 1958.

Patterson also said the pres
ent Soviet Sputnik may not
have been the first Russian
rocket to become an earth satel
lite.
Unofficial Russian sources
claim, he said, that in 1953 the
Soviet army launched a rocket
that inadvertently became a sat
ellite and circled the earth for
a few days. No announcement
ever was made of the experi
ment.
Patterson now is returning
home after a visit to Moscow.

nearer and nearer the earth in
ever smaller circles; that its
speed increases as its orbit con
tracts.
There #vere differences of
opinion on how soon the rocket
would move into earth atmos
phere heavy enough to plow it
downward in'flames.
British astronomer A. C. B.
Lovcll said in Manchester, Eng
land, he is convinced "something
catastrophic" will happen to the

rocket very soon—possibly in a
day or two.
But Dr. Fred L. Whipple, head
of the Smithsonian Astrophysi
cal Observatory at Cambridge,
Mass., said the rocket will stay
up for at least two months.
As for the satellite itself, hurl
ed aloft by the Soviets Oct. 4,
Whipple said its life expectancy
could not be forecast at this
time.
Presumably it is continuing
along at an 18,000-mile-an-hour
pace in a track considerably out

ward of the rocket's orbit.
The rocket is due to make
three more early-morning passes
across U.S. skies today. On its
third trip it is to pass over Men
d o c in o, Calif., at 4:59 a.m.
(PST).
Scientists at Cambridge said
that in a few days the rocket
could be seen in the evening as
it moves northward on the other
leg of its orbit. In about 10 days
it may show up both morning
and evening in New England.
Further information on Rus

sian plans for future rockets
came from Christian Clausen,
science editor for the Los An
geles Examiner.
He said the Russians plan an
attempt to hit the moon Nov. 7.
Clausen said the information
came from a European scientist
who talked with rocket experts
who had escaped from a missile
base in East Germany.
The Russians, Clausen wrote,
will aim three rockets at the
moon from a Caspian Sea base,
and if at least one hits that tar

get they will announce their suc
cess. If they miss, he wrote,
they will try three more, and
then three more. If these miss,
they will do further calculating.
"The first Soviet moon rock
ets will be unmanned," Clausen
wrote, "but if they are success
ful with their first vehicles the
Russians plan to send animals
and then men to the moon."
Representative Patterson (R-
Conn.) said the Soviets are pre
paring to launch 95 more rock
ets before the end of 1958.

Patterson also said the pres
ent Soviet Sputnik may not
have been the first Russian
rocket to become an earth satel
lite.
Unofficial Russian sources
claim, he said, that in 1953 the
Soviet army launched a rocket
that inadvertently became a sat
ellite and circled the earth for
a few days. No announcement
ever was made of the experi
ment.
Patterson now is returning
home after a visit to Moscow.
WASHINGTON (/P)—Russia's
space rocket was reported by
observers yesterday to be whirl
