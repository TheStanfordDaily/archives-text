# After Dinner Opera Company Presentation to Be Tonight
## Subscription Series Sponsors Three Modern Operas in English at Dinkelspiel Auditorium 
### 
The After Dinner Opera Company, a unique three-singer organi
zation, will present three modern operas in English. Offenbach's
"66," Menotti's "The Telephone" and Cockshott's "Apollo and Per
sephone" will be given in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight at 8:30.
The performers are Jeanne Beauvais, soprano, Francis Barnard,

bass-baritone, and Norman Myr*
vik, tenor. In 19p6 the group was
invited to the international music
festival in Edinburgh and then
played in London, Paris, Vienna,
Frankfort and other European
cities.
A large number of tickets is
still available, both for the entire
series at $7 and for single per
formances at $2. The Music De
partment urges students to take
advantage of the opportunity to
attend these concerts on campus.
Jacques Offenbach wrote "66"
for his own Off-the-Champs Ely
sees Theater in Paris. It is a fable
of two Austrian peasants and
their experiences with a lottery.
"The Telephone," by Gian-Carlo
Menotti, was a successful Broad
way production. His other Broad
way successes include "The Me
dium," "The Consul" and"The J
Saint of Bleeker Street."
British composer Gerald Cork
shot t composes a comic retelling
of the classical myth "Apollo and
Persephone." The New York
Times praised its American pre
miere by the After Dinner players
in 1956.
The group was organized in
1949 as an off-Broadway venture
and is now on its first coast-to
coast tour, after several seasons
in New York.
