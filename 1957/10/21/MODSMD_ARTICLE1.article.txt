HUSKY STADH'M, SEATTLE, Oct. 19 A 1 Harrington made
Ihrec-for-three in tho P.A.T. department and Ben Robinson saw to it
that Washington didn't pull off a successful on-sidc kick as Stanford
outplayed the win Joss Huskies here today, 21-14.
In a game similar' to last week's heart-stopper against Washington
State, Chuck Taylors Indians stayed on top this time to register
their third win ol the year and first in PCC action.
Stanford relied on the steady ground gaining of fullback Chuck
Shea and halfback Harrington to pull away to a 21-7 lead midway
through the fourth period.
Then the Huskies tried to copy the WSC script of a week ago as
they quickly drove to a score with 1:46 to play. To no one's surprise,
Washington attempted an on-side kickoff in the hope that they could
at least tie the score.
Seven Up Front
This time, Stanford sent seven men up into the forward wall. The
kick dropped over the lin's head, but .Robinson alertly went back and
fell on it if) ice the game for the Cards.
Shea and Harrington did almost two-thirds of the offensive work
for Stanford, carrying the ball 29 and 18 times respectively. Four
other Indians carried the ball on 11 occasions and Tribe quarterbacks
Jackie Douglas and Jackie Taylor threw just 14 passes.
Shea scored the first and last touchdowns for the Cards, and
amassed 128 yards on the ground for a respectable 4.4 average. Har-

Jim Jones and Dick Payseno
took t urn s carrying Stanford
tacklers on their backs, and moved
the ball to the Indians' 36 before
' Payseno let a fumble squirt into
ihe arms of alert Troy Barbee.
Shea and Harrington moved 21
yards in two plays, but then Stan

Huskies took over on their own
20. Eighteen quick plays later A!

Indians Tie Score
With just 1:43 to play in the
first period, Stanford took the
| kickoff and began a nine - play
j drive that eventually tied the
Count. Twice Ihe Indians were
j faced with third-down situations
I before Shea broke loose for the
i six points.
The first time, al midfield, Stan
ford needed 3 yards, but Shea
: went at right end for 5. Two plays
later the Cards were set back by
1 a delay-of-game penalty and need
ed 8 yards for the first.
Here Douglas thoroughly foxed
j ihe Washington defenders as he
! flipped to Harrington on a screen
pass for 12 yards. The always
effective double reverse sent Jeri
McMillin scampering for 7 yards
lo the Husky 22 and left the Tribe
I inch short of a first down.
IJYV Off Balance
Washington braved themselves)
for a power line play and were j
caught off balance when Shea slid j
off tackle. He broke into the see-1
ondary, angled to his right and j
wen I into the end zone for the
lying rally with no trouble at all.

Drive Dies
The Stanfords showed signs of;
lengthening their lead before the
half-time gun as they marched 49 j
yards in nine plays, but the drive
expired as Taylor threw over Me-1
Millin's head on fourth and 4 at
the Husky 25.
The only bit of excitement gen
erated in the third canto was a
Douglas-to-Barbee tackle - eligible

pass. The 232-
pound tackle cut
over center and
made a ni c c
catch of the
quick aerial. He
lumbered about
15 yards before
being hit hard b>«
a couple of Hus

loose and bounc
ed another 10
yards toward the

Washington goal line before Du

healing Taylor's lunge.
Long Card Drive
At Ihe start of the final period
Stanford initiated a drive which
was to eal up 20 plays, 75 yards,
and 8 minutes 18 seconds.
Two passes by Douglas punctu
ated what was otherwise a Har
rington-Shea production .The two
aerials one to McMillin for 11,
the other to Taylor for 11 were
the long gainers of the drive, but
il was the 5- and 6-yard bursts
lhat used up the time.
Shea finally got the score when
he dove over right guard from I he
I against a tight Washington line.
It was shades of WSC as Wash
ington refused to give up in the
few remaining minutes. Rather
than 87 yards in one play, it took
the Northerners 12 plays to go 68
yards, but the results were Ihe
same—a touchdown.
But there, fortunately for Stan
ford, Ihe similarity ended.

that Washington didn't pull off a successful on-sidc kick as Stanford
outplayed the win Joss Huskies here today, 21-14.
In a game similar' to last week's heart-stopper against Washington
State, Chuck Taylors Indians stayed on top this time to register

Stanford relied on the steady ground gaining of fullback Chuck
Shea and halfback Harrington to pull away to a 21-7 lead midway
through the fourth period.
Then the Huskies tried to copy the WSC script of a week ago as
they quickly drove to a score with 1:46 to play. To no one's surprise,
Washington attempted an on-side kickoff in the hope that they could
at least tie the score.
Seven Up Front
This time, Stanford sent seven men up into the forward wall. The
kick dropped over the lin's head, but .Robinson alertly went back and
fell on it if) ice the game for the Cards.
Shea and Harrington did almost two-thirds of the offensive work
for Stanford, carrying the ball 29 and 18 times respectively. Four
other Indians carried the ball on 11 occasions and Tribe quarterbacks
Jackie Douglas and Jackie Taylor threw just 14 passes.
Shea scored the first and last touchdowns for the Cards, and
amassed 128 yards on the ground for a respectable 4.4 average. Har-

HUSKY STADH'M, SEATTLE, Oct. 19 A 1 Harrington made
Ihrec-for-three in tho P.A.T. department and Ben Robinson saw to it
that Washington didn't pull off a successful on-sidc kick as Stanford
outplayed the win Joss Huskies here today, 21-14.
In a game similar' to last week's heart-stopper against Washington
State, Chuck Taylors Indians stayed on top this time to register
their third win ol the year and first in PCC action.
Stanford relied on the steady ground gaining of fullback Chuck
Shea and halfback Harrington to pull away to a 21-7 lead midway
through the fourth period.
Then the Huskies tried to copy the WSC script of a week ago as
they quickly drove to a score with 1:46 to play. To no one's surprise,
Washington attempted an on-side kickoff in the hope that they could
at least tie the score.
Seven Up Front
This time, Stanford sent seven men up into the forward wall. The
kick dropped over the lin's head, but .Robinson alertly went back and
fell on it if) ice the game for the Cards.
Shea and Harrington did almost two-thirds of the offensive work
for Stanford, carrying the ball 29 and 18 times respectively. Four
other Indians carried the ball on 11 occasions and Tribe quarterbacks
Jackie Douglas and Jackie Taylor threw just 14 passes.
Shea scored the first and last touchdowns for the Cards, and
amassed 128 yards on the ground for a respectable 4.4 average. Har-

It was shades of WSC as Wash

HUSKY STADH'M, SEATTLE, Oct. 19 A 1 Harrington made
Ihrec-for-three in tho P.A.T. department and Ben Robinson saw to it
that Washington didn't pull off a successful on-sidc kick as Stanford
outplayed the win Joss Huskies here today, 21-14.
In a game similar' to last week's heart-stopper against Washington
State, Chuck Taylors Indians stayed on top this time to register
their third win ol the year and first in PCC action.
Stanford relied on the steady ground gaining of fullback Chuck
Shea and halfback Harrington to pull away to a 21-7 lead midway
through the fourth period.
Then the Huskies tried to copy the WSC script of a week ago as
they quickly drove to a score with 1:46 to play. To no one's surprise,
Washington attempted an on-side kickoff in the hope that they could
at least tie the score.
Seven Up Front
This time, Stanford sent seven men up into the forward wall. The
kick dropped over the lin's head, but .Robinson alertly went back and
fell on it if) ice the game for the Cards.
Shea and Harrington did almost two-thirds of the offensive work
for Stanford, carrying the ball 29 and 18 times respectively. Four
other Indians carried the ball on 11 occasions and Tribe quarterbacks
Jackie Douglas and Jackie Taylor threw just 14 passes.
Shea scored the first and last touchdowns for the Cards, and
amassed 128 yards on the ground for a respectable 4.4 average. Har-
