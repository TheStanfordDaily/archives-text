Ihrec-for-three in tho P.A.T. department and Ben Robinson saw to it
that Washington didn't pull off a successful on-sidc kick as Stanford
outplayed the win Joss Huskies here today, 21-14.

their third win ol the year and first in PCC action.
Stanford relied on the steady ground gaining of fullback Chuck
Shea and halfback Harrington to pull away to a 21-7 lead midway
through the fourth period.

they quickly drove to a score with 1:46 to play. To no one's surprise,
Washington attempted an on-side kickoff in the hope that they could
at least tie the score.

other Indians carried the ball on 11 occasions and Tribe quarterbacks
Jackie Douglas and Jackie Taylor threw just 14 passes.
Shea scored the first and last touchdowns for the Cards, and
amassed 128 yards on the ground for a respectable 4.4 average. Har-
