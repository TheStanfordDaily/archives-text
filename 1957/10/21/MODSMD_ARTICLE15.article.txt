A Slight Correction
Editor, The Daily:
I appreciated the straightforward, intelligent
and detailed coverage ot' my recent tour of
China; however there are a few small errors,
mostly my fault, which 1 would like to correct.
In the first article, on Oct. IG, it was not clear
that collective farmers are paid on a calculated
hourly rate. This rate is the net profit divided
by the total man-hours (also woman-hours), and
approved by the membership.
In the second article my quotation "I don't
think it does credit to our American tradition
of free thought to categorize people by color"
was in reply to a question concerning whether
the group of Americans in China were "pinkos."
1 meant simply that it's absurd and insulting, to
yourself as well as the others, to categorize
Weltanschauung on a linear scale of red to white.
In the second article it read that ". . . 41 were
allowed to go," oqt of the original 85 who signed
up. Actually there was no choosing of who
would go and who would not. Anyone who
wanted to go could. I'm sure that if the Chinese
or anyone else had selected who should go, ac
< ai ding to any criteria, I and most others would
not have gone.
()f these three errors, the last seems most im
portant and worth publishing. I would appre
ciate hearing from you on it.
Also I look forward eagerly to the many pro
i'ound and cutting letters which must be pouring
m in you on this and other controversial matters.

A Hungarian Answers
Editor, The Daily:
I icing a Hungarian refugee student at Stanford
University, I have always been eager to know
how people from this side of the Iron Curtain see
us satellite peoples. Now 1 know. Mr. Williamson
pave me a lecture about it in The Daily. He felt
he had the right to learn things about Red China,
and managed to do it. That's all right. But what
about this question: "Are there no Russian stu
denis who want to see the other part of the
world?" Some may suggest that they wouldn't
be allowed to come to this country. Well, I'll
answer it.
For the first time in Communist history, great
masses of Russian soldiers had the opportunity
1o see the outside world. The barbed wires had
held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying
"Do Not Believe Our Returning Soldiers."
Hungarian smallholders popularly called peas
ants told us students in Budapest that when
Ihey came to the National Autumn Fair, Soviet
soldiers damaged their homes, mostly in the east
ern part of the country. The soldiers said the
owners of these homes must be capitalists- they
have curtains, radios, rugs and pictures. The
soldiers couldn't believe that the occupants were
simple peasants.
There was a proverb running among the satel
lite states: Stalin made one mistake; he showed
Europe to his soldiers, and his soldiers to Europe.
Mr. Williamson was lucky to be able to view
the everyday life of a system he was unaccus
tomed to. He had the right to ask people about
their opinions though this was done through
interpreters.
Let's stop here for a while. Since I was an in
terpeter in an American POW camp in France
among fellow Hungarians and Germans, I was
interested in meeting people on the outside of
the Iron Curtain. An announcement asking for
interpreters was circulated in our university ask
ing for interpreters for the coming World Festi
val in Budapest in 1949.
We had to pass an exam before receiving a
permit for interpreting. Discussing it beforehand,
1 was convinced I would pass it. But the first
question, in English, was "What are the merits
of the Communist party in restoring the coun
try?" The second question was "What is your
opinion about the case of Cardinal Mindszenty?"
I felt I'd rather not try to answer those ques
tions. Needless to say, I flunked the test.
Running the dangerous risk of meeting people
from all over the world, 1 tried to tell them about
things they were never told officially. When the
official interpreters were of a different opinion,
ihe people 1 met sometimes didn't believe me.
Often they couldn't understand why I didn't want
10 discuss these problems with the official inter
preters freely why I was even afraid to meet
1 hem.
One of the English visitors, a politics and eco
nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western
::uy," they looked around cautiously and would
say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when
1 hey are coming to liberate us. Tell him we have
been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one
Saturday afternoon. Saying "hello" to each other,
we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years
as a typist. Not needing me as an interpreter, he
poured out his heart to my English friend, who
w as deeply impressed and became convinced.
The result was what one could expect. I was
arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par
sonage near Liverpool, his home town.
I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson
should become a priest of any kind, but I should
like to urge him to pray for the souls of the
people he met.

Editor, The Daily:
There are a great many people in America
today who are disgusted by the actions of Stan
ford student Earl Richard Williamson, and his
fellow traveling friends, whose trip to Commu
nist China during the past summer months was
given the "full treatment" in last week's Stan
ford Daily. It is unfortunate and representative
of poor thinking that The Stanford Daily saw fit
to publish the series a# a mere travelogue for it
is much more than that. The trip by Williamson
and friends has had disruptive and irrevocable
influences upon this country far greater than
anything that will happen around the Stanford
quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his
China expedition better than the hundreds of
career State Department and government offi
cials who have spent years of study on the end
results of actions such as those of Williamson
and his companions.
The Communists gave Williamson a cheap
good time and he now wants to repay them.
Whether he realizes it or not, his travel expenses
have been more than repaid. They were easily
repaid by the tremendous amount of propaganda
source-material which he helped generate.
Williamson "has expressed the desire to talk
to Stanford groups of any size. . . . He wants
to tell his fellow Americans about what he saw.
. . ." I'm sure that Williamson would like to talk
of how the Communists have set about recon
structing China. Many of us have seen how
Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in
Communist Chinese policy and attitude since
that time. It is unfortunate that the "fellow
Americans" to whom Williamson would like to
speak cannot be the 33,629 fellow Americans
whom Communist China killed in Korea, or
perhaps not even the 103,284 men whom they
wounded.
There is a quotation from William Saroyan
that goes: "What they" (the propagandists! "do,
boys, is creep up on you, and I don't mean In
dians. I mean Americans, over the radio, over
the waves, from platforms, pulpit, press and
curb." One must stop to wonder whether the
students who took the trip to China knew too
little about the techniques of propaganda or
whether they might possibly have known full
well how it works!
It is the duty of The Stanford Daily to report
the knews with responsibility and intelligence.
It is the job of the editors to recognize that there
is often more to a story than the mere words
that it contains. Williamson's story is reportable
information and it deserves to be printed by The
Daily, but it is strictly one man's opinion and it
should be clearly lit led and written as such. In
reading the articles one constantly has difficulty
in separating the opinions of Williamson from
the "statement of fact" type writing of the re
porter David Egger. Furthermore, I have no
ticed a conspicuous absence .4' editorial comment
by the Daily editors on the articles. Perhaps the
issue is too "hot" to handle or possibly the edi
tors cannot decide on whethet they should take
a stand. It might be easier to c utter tlie columns
with strictly noncommittal trivia.
Intelligent and discerning readers of The Dai
ly's articles on Williamson's trip will not think
of merely how much "fun" it would have been
if they too could have taken a free trip to Red
China. Instead they will pause and consider
what might be the real issues involved: irrespon
sible actions by selfish and misdirected individ
uals which possibly have had far-reaching ill
effects upon the United Stats government and
ihe principles which it represents, and the fact
that there are times when a person's own selfish
interests must be sublimated to the best inter
ests of the country as a whole.
11 my views are considered somewhat biased
it may be because of my experiences in the In
fantry, my work in counter-intelligence, what I
saw in Korea, and the memory of dead friends.
I regret to say that the United States still re
mains in a "quasi state of war" with Red China.
The attitudes and aims of Chinese Communism
have not changed since Korea, nor will they
change by visiting Americans flashing through
the countryside looking around. Although in
comprehensible to many in America today, wars
nevertheless are fought with jagged and ripping
steel, burning phosphorus, slicing bayonets, and
PROPAGANDA. In ihe past history of Amer
ica there have been cases of men who sold rifles
and ammunition so that Indians could raid and
murder settlers. These men were paid with mon
ey and furs. "Ammunition" for the war we now
find ourselvs involved in is perhaps being bought
by "free trips." Good intentions mean little.

Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in

Earl Williamson
A Hungarian Answers
Editor, The Daily:
I icing a Hungarian refugee student at Stanford
University, I have always been eager to know
how people from this side of the Iron Curtain see
us satellite peoples. Now 1 know. Mr. Williamson
pave me a lecture about it in The Daily. He felt
he had the right to learn things about Red China,
and managed to do it. That's all right. But what
about this question: "Are there no Russian stu
denis who want to see the other part of the
world?" Some may suggest that they wouldn't
be allowed to come to this country. Well, I'll
answer it.
For the first time in Communist history, great
masses of Russian soldiers had the opportunity
1o see the outside world. The barbed wires had
held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying
"Do Not Believe Our Returning Soldiers."
Hungarian smallholders popularly called peas
ants told us students in Budapest that when
Ihey came to the National Autumn Fair, Soviet
soldiers damaged their homes, mostly in the east
ern part of the country. The soldiers said the
owners of these homes must be capitalists- they
have curtains, radios, rugs and pictures. The
soldiers couldn't believe that the occupants were
simple peasants.
There was a proverb running among the satel
lite states: Stalin made one mistake; he showed
Europe to his soldiers, and his soldiers to Europe.
Mr. Williamson was lucky to be able to view
the everyday life of a system he was unaccus
tomed to. He had the right to ask people about
their opinions though this was done through
interpreters.
Let's stop here for a while. Since I was an in
terpeter in an American POW camp in France
among fellow Hungarians and Germans, I was
interested in meeting people on the outside of
the Iron Curtain. An announcement asking for
interpreters was circulated in our university ask
ing for interpreters for the coming World Festi
val in Budapest in 1949.
We had to pass an exam before receiving a
permit for interpreting. Discussing it beforehand,
1 was convinced I would pass it. But the first
question, in English, was "What are the merits
of the Communist party in restoring the coun
try?" The second question was "What is your
opinion about the case of Cardinal Mindszenty?"
I felt I'd rather not try to answer those ques
tions. Needless to say, I flunked the test.
Running the dangerous risk of meeting people
from all over the world, 1 tried to tell them about
things they were never told officially. When the
official interpreters were of a different opinion,
ihe people 1 met sometimes didn't believe me.
Often they couldn't understand why I didn't want
10 discuss these problems with the official inter
preters freely why I was even afraid to meet
1 hem.
One of the English visitors, a politics and eco
nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western
::uy," they looked around cautiously and would
say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when
1 hey are coming to liberate us. Tell him we have
been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one
Saturday afternoon. Saying "hello" to each other,
we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years
as a typist. Not needing me as an interpreter, he
poured out his heart to my English friend, who
w as deeply impressed and became convinced.
The result was what one could expect. I was
arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par
sonage near Liverpool, his home town.
I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson
should become a priest of any kind, but I should
like to urge him to pray for the souls of the
people he met.

There are a great many people in America
today who are disgusted by the actions of Stan
ford student Earl Richard Williamson, and his
fellow traveling friends, whose trip to Commu
nist China during the past summer months was
given the "full treatment" in last week's Stan
ford Daily. It is unfortunate and representative
of poor thinking that The Stanford Daily saw fit
to publish the series a# a mere travelogue for it
is much more than that. The trip by Williamson
and friends has had disruptive and irrevocable
influences upon this country far greater than
anything that will happen around the Stanford
quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his

held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying
"Do Not Believe Our Returning Soldiers."
Hungarian smallholders popularly called peas
ants told us students in Budapest that when
Ihey came to the National Autumn Fair, Soviet
soldiers damaged their homes, mostly in the east
ern part of the country. The soldiers said the
owners of these homes must be capitalists- they
have curtains, radios, rugs and pictures. The
soldiers couldn't believe that the occupants were
simple peasants.
There was a proverb running among the satel
lite states: Stalin made one mistake; he showed
Europe to his soldiers, and his soldiers to Europe.
Mr. Williamson was lucky to be able to view
the everyday life of a system he was unaccus
tomed to. He had the right to ask people about
their opinions though this was done through
interpreters.
Let's stop here for a while. Since I was an in
terpeter in an American POW camp in France
among fellow Hungarians and Germans, I was
interested in meeting people on the outside of
the Iron Curtain. An announcement asking for
interpreters was circulated in our university ask
ing for interpreters for the coming World Festi
val in Budapest in 1949.
We had to pass an exam before receiving a
permit for interpreting. Discussing it beforehand,
1 was convinced I would pass it. But the first
question, in English, was "What are the merits
of the Communist party in restoring the coun
try?" The second question was "What is your
opinion about the case of Cardinal Mindszenty?"
I felt I'd rather not try to answer those ques
tions. Needless to say, I flunked the test.
Running the dangerous risk of meeting people
from all over the world, 1 tried to tell them about
things they were never told officially. When the
official interpreters were of a different opinion,
ihe people 1 met sometimes didn't believe me.
Often they couldn't understand why I didn't want
10 discuss these problems with the official inter
preters freely why I was even afraid to meet
1 hem.
One of the English visitors, a politics and eco
nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western
::uy," they looked around cautiously and would
say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when
1 hey are coming to liberate us. Tell him we have
been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one
Saturday afternoon. Saying "hello" to each other,
we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years
as a typist. Not needing me as an interpreter, he
poured out his heart to my English friend, who
w as deeply impressed and became convinced.
The result was what one could expect. I was
arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par
sonage near Liverpool, his home town.
I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson
should become a priest of any kind, but I should
like to urge him to pray for the souls of the
people he met.

Editor, The Daily:
There are a great many people in America
today who are disgusted by the actions of Stan
ford student Earl Richard Williamson, and his
fellow traveling friends, whose trip to Commu
nist China during the past summer months was
given the "full treatment" in last week's Stan
ford Daily. It is unfortunate and representative
of poor thinking that The Stanford Daily saw fit
to publish the series a# a mere travelogue for it
is much more than that. The trip by Williamson
and friends has had disruptive and irrevocable
influences upon this country far greater than
anything that will happen around the Stanford
quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his
China expedition better than the hundreds of
career State Department and government offi
cials who have spent years of study on the end
results of actions such as those of Williamson
and his companions.
The Communists gave Williamson a cheap
good time and he now wants to repay them.
Whether he realizes it or not, his travel expenses
have been more than repaid. They were easily
repaid by the tremendous amount of propaganda
source-material which he helped generate.
Williamson "has expressed the desire to talk
to Stanford groups of any size. . . . He wants
to tell his fellow Americans about what he saw.
. . ." I'm sure that Williamson would like to talk
of how the Communists have set about recon
structing China. Many of us have seen how
Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in
Communist Chinese policy and attitude since
that time. It is unfortunate that the "fellow
Americans" to whom Williamson would like to
speak cannot be the 33,629 fellow Americans
whom Communist China killed in Korea, or
perhaps not even the 103,284 men whom they
wounded.
There is a quotation from William Saroyan
that goes: "What they" (the propagandists! "do,
boys, is creep up on you, and I don't mean In
dians. I mean Americans, over the radio, over
the waves, from platforms, pulpit, press and
curb." One must stop to wonder whether the
students who took the trip to China knew too
little about the techniques of propaganda or
whether they might possibly have known full
well how it works!
It is the duty of The Stanford Daily to report
the knews with responsibility and intelligence.
It is the job of the editors to recognize that there
is often more to a story than the mere words
that it contains. Williamson's story is reportable
information and it deserves to be printed by The
Daily, but it is strictly one man's opinion and it
should be clearly lit led and written as such. In
reading the articles one constantly has difficulty
in separating the opinions of Williamson from
the "statement of fact" type writing of the re
porter David Egger. Furthermore, I have no
ticed a conspicuous absence .4' editorial comment
by the Daily editors on the articles. Perhaps the
issue is too "hot" to handle or possibly the edi
tors cannot decide on whethet they should take
a stand. It might be easier to c utter tlie columns
with strictly noncommittal trivia.
Intelligent and discerning readers of The Dai
ly's articles on Williamson's trip will not think
of merely how much "fun" it would have been
if they too could have taken a free trip to Red
China. Instead they will pause and consider
what might be the real issues involved: irrespon
sible actions by selfish and misdirected individ
uals which possibly have had far-reaching ill
effects upon the United Stats government and
ihe principles which it represents, and the fact
that there are times when a person's own selfish
interests must be sublimated to the best inter
ests of the country as a whole.
11 my views are considered somewhat biased
it may be because of my experiences in the In
fantry, my work in counter-intelligence, what I
saw in Korea, and the memory of dead friends.
I regret to say that the United States still re
mains in a "quasi state of war" with Red China.
The attitudes and aims of Chinese Communism
have not changed since Korea, nor will they
change by visiting Americans flashing through
the countryside looking around. Although in
comprehensible to many in America today, wars
nevertheless are fought with jagged and ripping
steel, burning phosphorus, slicing bayonets, and
PROPAGANDA. In ihe past history of Amer
ica there have been cases of men who sold rifles
and ammunition so that Indians could raid and
murder settlers. These men were paid with mon
ey and furs. "Ammunition" for the war we now
find ourselvs involved in is perhaps being bought
by "free trips." Good intentions mean little.

A Slight Correction
Editor, The Daily:
I appreciated the straightforward, intelligent
and detailed coverage ot' my recent tour of
China; however there are a few small errors,
mostly my fault, which 1 would like to correct.
In the first article, on Oct. IG, it was not clear
that collective farmers are paid on a calculated
hourly rate. This rate is the net profit divided
by the total man-hours (also woman-hours), and
approved by the membership.
In the second article my quotation "I don't
think it does credit to our American tradition
of free thought to categorize people by color"
was in reply to a question concerning whether
the group of Americans in China were "pinkos."
1 meant simply that it's absurd and insulting, to
yourself as well as the others, to categorize
Weltanschauung on a linear scale of red to white.
In the second article it read that ". . . 41 were
allowed to go," oqt of the original 85 who signed
up. Actually there was no choosing of who
would go and who would not. Anyone who
wanted to go could. I'm sure that if the Chinese
or anyone else had selected who should go, ac
< ai ding to any criteria, I and most others would
not have gone.
()f these three errors, the last seems most im
portant and worth publishing. I would appre
ciate hearing from you on it.
Also I look forward eagerly to the many pro
i'ound and cutting letters which must be pouring
m in you on this and other controversial matters.
Earl Williamson
A Hungarian Answers
Editor, The Daily:
I icing a Hungarian refugee student at Stanford
University, I have always been eager to know
how people from this side of the Iron Curtain see
us satellite peoples. Now 1 know. Mr. Williamson
pave me a lecture about it in The Daily. He felt
he had the right to learn things about Red China,
and managed to do it. That's all right. But what
about this question: "Are there no Russian stu
denis who want to see the other part of the
world?" Some may suggest that they wouldn't
be allowed to come to this country. Well, I'll
answer it.
For the first time in Communist history, great
masses of Russian soldiers had the opportunity
1o see the outside world. The barbed wires had
held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying

Earl Williamson
A Hungarian Answers
Editor, The Daily:
I icing a Hungarian refugee student at Stanford
University, I have always been eager to know
how people from this side of the Iron Curtain see
us satellite peoples. Now 1 know. Mr. Williamson
pave me a lecture about it in The Daily. He felt
he had the right to learn things about Red China,
and managed to do it. That's all right. But what
about this question: "Are there no Russian stu
denis who want to see the other part of the
world?" Some may suggest that they wouldn't
be allowed to come to this country. Well, I'll
answer it.
For the first time in Communist history, great
masses of Russian soldiers had the opportunity
1o see the outside world. The barbed wires had
held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying
"Do Not Believe Our Returning Soldiers."
Hungarian smallholders popularly called peas
ants told us students in Budapest that when
Ihey came to the National Autumn Fair, Soviet
soldiers damaged their homes, mostly in the east
ern part of the country. The soldiers said the
owners of these homes must be capitalists- they
have curtains, radios, rugs and pictures. The
soldiers couldn't believe that the occupants were
simple peasants.
There was a proverb running among the satel
lite states: Stalin made one mistake; he showed
Europe to his soldiers, and his soldiers to Europe.
Mr. Williamson was lucky to be able to view
the everyday life of a system he was unaccus
tomed to. He had the right to ask people about
their opinions though this was done through
interpreters.
Let's stop here for a while. Since I was an in
terpeter in an American POW camp in France
among fellow Hungarians and Germans, I was
interested in meeting people on the outside of
the Iron Curtain. An announcement asking for
interpreters was circulated in our university ask
ing for interpreters for the coming World Festi
val in Budapest in 1949.
We had to pass an exam before receiving a
permit for interpreting. Discussing it beforehand,
1 was convinced I would pass it. But the first
question, in English, was "What are the merits
of the Communist party in restoring the coun
try?" The second question was "What is your
opinion about the case of Cardinal Mindszenty?"
I felt I'd rather not try to answer those ques
tions. Needless to say, I flunked the test.
Running the dangerous risk of meeting people
from all over the world, 1 tried to tell them about
things they were never told officially. When the
official interpreters were of a different opinion,
ihe people 1 met sometimes didn't believe me.
Often they couldn't understand why I didn't want
10 discuss these problems with the official inter
preters freely why I was even afraid to meet
1 hem.
One of the English visitors, a politics and eco
nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western
::uy," they looked around cautiously and would
say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when
1 hey are coming to liberate us. Tell him we have
been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one
Saturday afternoon. Saying "hello" to each other,
we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years
as a typist. Not needing me as an interpreter, he
poured out his heart to my English friend, who
w as deeply impressed and became convinced.
The result was what one could expect. I was
arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par
sonage near Liverpool, his home town.
I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson
should become a priest of any kind, but I should
like to urge him to pray for the souls of the
people he met.

Propagandist W illianison
Editor, The Daily:
There are a great many people in America
today who are disgusted by the actions of Stan
ford student Earl Richard Williamson, and his
fellow traveling friends, whose trip to Commu
nist China during the past summer months was
given the "full treatment" in last week's Stan
ford Daily. It is unfortunate and representative
of poor thinking that The Stanford Daily saw fit
to publish the series a# a mere travelogue for it
is much more than that. The trip by Williamson
and friends has had disruptive and irrevocable
influences upon this country far greater than
anything that will happen around the Stanford
quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his
China expedition better than the hundreds of
career State Department and government offi
cials who have spent years of study on the end
results of actions such as those of Williamson
and his companions.
The Communists gave Williamson a cheap
good time and he now wants to repay them.
Whether he realizes it or not, his travel expenses
have been more than repaid. They were easily
repaid by the tremendous amount of propaganda
source-material which he helped generate.
Williamson "has expressed the desire to talk
to Stanford groups of any size. . . . He wants
to tell his fellow Americans about what he saw.
. . ." I'm sure that Williamson would like to talk
of how the Communists have set about recon
structing China. Many of us have seen how
Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in
Communist Chinese policy and attitude since
that time. It is unfortunate that the "fellow
Americans" to whom Williamson would like to
speak cannot be the 33,629 fellow Americans
whom Communist China killed in Korea, or
perhaps not even the 103,284 men whom they
wounded.
There is a quotation from William Saroyan
that goes: "What they" (the propagandists! "do,
boys, is creep up on you, and I don't mean In
dians. I mean Americans, over the radio, over
the waves, from platforms, pulpit, press and
curb." One must stop to wonder whether the
students who took the trip to China knew too
little about the techniques of propaganda or
whether they might possibly have known full
well how it works!
It is the duty of The Stanford Daily to report
the knews with responsibility and intelligence.
It is the job of the editors to recognize that there
is often more to a story than the mere words
that it contains. Williamson's story is reportable
information and it deserves to be printed by The
Daily, but it is strictly one man's opinion and it
should be clearly lit led and written as such. In
reading the articles one constantly has difficulty
in separating the opinions of Williamson from
the "statement of fact" type writing of the re
porter David Egger. Furthermore, I have no
ticed a conspicuous absence .4' editorial comment
by the Daily editors on the articles. Perhaps the
issue is too "hot" to handle or possibly the edi
tors cannot decide on whethet they should take
a stand. It might be easier to c utter tlie columns

effects upon the United Stats government and
ihe principles which it represents, and the fact

interests must be sublimated to the best inter
ests of the country as a whole.
11 my views are considered somewhat biased

nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western

say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when
1 hey are coming to liberate us. Tell him we have
been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one
Saturday afternoon. Saying "hello" to each other,
we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years
as a typist. Not needing me as an interpreter, he
poured out his heart to my English friend, who
w as deeply impressed and became convinced.
The result was what one could expect. I was
arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par

I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson

There are a great many people in America
today who are disgusted by the actions of Stan
ford student Earl Richard Williamson, and his
fellow traveling friends, whose trip to Commu
nist China during the past summer months was
given the "full treatment" in last week's Stan
ford Daily. It is unfortunate and representative
of poor thinking that The Stanford Daily saw fit
to publish the series a# a mere travelogue for it
is much more than that. The trip by Williamson
and friends has had disruptive and irrevocable
influences upon this country far greater than
anything that will happen around the Stanford
quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his
China expedition better than the hundreds of
career State Department and government offi
cials who have spent years of study on the end
results of actions such as those of Williamson
and his companions.
The Communists gave Williamson a cheap
good time and he now wants to repay them.
Whether he realizes it or not, his travel expenses
have been more than repaid. They were easily
repaid by the tremendous amount of propaganda
source-material which he helped generate.
Williamson "has expressed the desire to talk
to Stanford groups of any size. . . . He wants
to tell his fellow Americans about what he saw.
. . ." I'm sure that Williamson would like to talk
of how the Communists have set about recon
structing China. Many of us have seen how
Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in
Communist Chinese policy and attitude since
that time. It is unfortunate that the "fellow
Americans" to whom Williamson would like to
speak cannot be the 33,629 fellow Americans
whom Communist China killed in Korea, or
perhaps not even the 103,284 men whom they
wounded.
There is a quotation from William Saroyan
that goes: "What they" (the propagandists! "do,
boys, is creep up on you, and I don't mean In
dians. I mean Americans, over the radio, over
the waves, from platforms, pulpit, press and
curb." One must stop to wonder whether the
students who took the trip to China knew too
little about the techniques of propaganda or
whether they might possibly have known full
well how it works!
It is the duty of The Stanford Daily to report
the knews with responsibility and intelligence.
It is the job of the editors to recognize that there
is often more to a story than the mere words
that it contains. Williamson's story is reportable
information and it deserves to be printed by The
Daily, but it is strictly one man's opinion and it
should be clearly lit led and written as such. In
reading the articles one constantly has difficulty
in separating the opinions of Williamson from
the "statement of fact" type writing of the re
porter David Egger. Furthermore, I have no
ticed a conspicuous absence .4' editorial comment
by the Daily editors on the articles. Perhaps the
issue is too "hot" to handle or possibly the edi
tors cannot decide on whethet they should take
a stand. It might be easier to c utter tlie columns
with strictly noncommittal trivia.
Intelligent and discerning readers of The Dai
ly's articles on Williamson's trip will not think
of merely how much "fun" it would have been
if they too could have taken a free trip to Red
China. Instead they will pause and consider
what might be the real issues involved: irrespon
sible actions by selfish and misdirected individ
uals which possibly have had far-reaching ill
effects upon the United Stats government and
ihe principles which it represents, and the fact
that there are times when a person's own selfish
interests must be sublimated to the best inter
ests of the country as a whole.
11 my views are considered somewhat biased
it may be because of my experiences in the In
fantry, my work in counter-intelligence, what I
saw in Korea, and the memory of dead friends.
I regret to say that the United States still re
mains in a "quasi state of war" with Red China.
The attitudes and aims of Chinese Communism
have not changed since Korea, nor will they
change by visiting Americans flashing through
the countryside looking around. Although in
comprehensible to many in America today, wars
nevertheless are fought with jagged and ripping
steel, burning phosphorus, slicing bayonets, and
PROPAGANDA. In ihe past history of Amer
ica there have been cases of men who sold rifles
and ammunition so that Indians could raid and
murder settlers. These men were paid with mon
ey and furs. "Ammunition" for the war we now
find ourselvs involved in is perhaps being bought
by "free trips." Good intentions mean little.

A Slight Correction
Editor, The Daily:
I appreciated the straightforward, intelligent
and detailed coverage ot' my recent tour of
China; however there are a few small errors,
mostly my fault, which 1 would like to correct.
In the first article, on Oct. IG, it was not clear
that collective farmers are paid on a calculated
hourly rate. This rate is the net profit divided
by the total man-hours (also woman-hours), and
approved by the membership.
In the second article my quotation "I don't
think it does credit to our American tradition
of free thought to categorize people by color"
was in reply to a question concerning whether
the group of Americans in China were "pinkos."
1 meant simply that it's absurd and insulting, to
yourself as well as the others, to categorize
Weltanschauung on a linear scale of red to white.
In the second article it read that ". . . 41 were
allowed to go," oqt of the original 85 who signed
up. Actually there was no choosing of who
would go and who would not. Anyone who
wanted to go could. I'm sure that if the Chinese
or anyone else had selected who should go, ac
< ai ding to any criteria, I and most others would
not have gone.
()f these three errors, the last seems most im
portant and worth publishing. I would appre
ciate hearing from you on it.
Also I look forward eagerly to the many pro
i'ound and cutting letters which must be pouring
m in you on this and other controversial matters.
Earl Williamson
A Hungarian Answers
Editor, The Daily:
I icing a Hungarian refugee student at Stanford
University, I have always been eager to know
how people from this side of the Iron Curtain see
us satellite peoples. Now 1 know. Mr. Williamson
pave me a lecture about it in The Daily. He felt
he had the right to learn things about Red China,
and managed to do it. That's all right. But what
about this question: "Are there no Russian stu
denis who want to see the other part of the
world?" Some may suggest that they wouldn't
be allowed to come to this country. Well, I'll
answer it.
For the first time in Communist history, great
masses of Russian soldiers had the opportunity
1o see the outside world. The barbed wires had
held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying
"Do Not Believe Our Returning Soldiers."
Hungarian smallholders popularly called peas
ants told us students in Budapest that when
Ihey came to the National Autumn Fair, Soviet
soldiers damaged their homes, mostly in the east
ern part of the country. The soldiers said the
owners of these homes must be capitalists- they
have curtains, radios, rugs and pictures. The
soldiers couldn't believe that the occupants were
simple peasants.
There was a proverb running among the satel
lite states: Stalin made one mistake; he showed
Europe to his soldiers, and his soldiers to Europe.
Mr. Williamson was lucky to be able to view
the everyday life of a system he was unaccus
tomed to. He had the right to ask people about
their opinions though this was done through
interpreters.
Let's stop here for a while. Since I was an in
terpeter in an American POW camp in France
among fellow Hungarians and Germans, I was
interested in meeting people on the outside of
the Iron Curtain. An announcement asking for
interpreters was circulated in our university ask
ing for interpreters for the coming World Festi
val in Budapest in 1949.
We had to pass an exam before receiving a
permit for interpreting. Discussing it beforehand,
1 was convinced I would pass it. But the first
question, in English, was "What are the merits
of the Communist party in restoring the coun
try?" The second question was "What is your
opinion about the case of Cardinal Mindszenty?"
I felt I'd rather not try to answer those ques
tions. Needless to say, I flunked the test.
Running the dangerous risk of meeting people
from all over the world, 1 tried to tell them about
things they were never told officially. When the
official interpreters were of a different opinion,
ihe people 1 met sometimes didn't believe me.
Often they couldn't understand why I didn't want
10 discuss these problems with the official inter
preters freely why I was even afraid to meet
1 hem.
One of the English visitors, a politics and eco
nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western

say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when

been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one

we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years

arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par
sonage near Liverpool, his home town.
I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson
should become a priest of any kind, but I should

A Hungarian Answers
Editor, The Daily:
I icing a Hungarian refugee student at Stanford
University, I have always been eager to know
how people from this side of the Iron Curtain see
us satellite peoples. Now 1 know. Mr. Williamson
pave me a lecture about it in The Daily. He felt
he had the right to learn things about Red China,
and managed to do it. That's all right. But what
about this question: "Are there no Russian stu
denis who want to see the other part of the
world?" Some may suggest that they wouldn't
be allowed to come to this country. Well, I'll
answer it.
For the first time in Communist history, great
masses of Russian soldiers had the opportunity
1o see the outside world. The barbed wires had
held them back before not the soldiers, I mean,
but the civilians. A few years later I met country
men of mine returning from Soviet prisoner-of
war camps in Siberia. A neighboring camp was
occupied by those former Russian soldiers who
returned from the European occupation. These
POW's saw huge posters in Kiev, Ukraine, saying
"Do Not Believe Our Returning Soldiers."
Hungarian smallholders popularly called peas
ants told us students in Budapest that when
Ihey came to the National Autumn Fair, Soviet
soldiers damaged their homes, mostly in the east
ern part of the country. The soldiers said the
owners of these homes must be capitalists- they
have curtains, radios, rugs and pictures. The
soldiers couldn't believe that the occupants were
simple peasants.
There was a proverb running among the satel
lite states: Stalin made one mistake; he showed
Europe to his soldiers, and his soldiers to Europe.
Mr. Williamson was lucky to be able to view
the everyday life of a system he was unaccus
tomed to. He had the right to ask people about
their opinions though this was done through
interpreters.
Let's stop here for a while. Since I was an in
terpeter in an American POW camp in France
among fellow Hungarians and Germans, I was
interested in meeting people on the outside of
the Iron Curtain. An announcement asking for
interpreters was circulated in our university ask
ing for interpreters for the coming World Festi
val in Budapest in 1949.
We had to pass an exam before receiving a
permit for interpreting. Discussing it beforehand,
1 was convinced I would pass it. But the first
question, in English, was "What are the merits
of the Communist party in restoring the coun
try?" The second question was "What is your
opinion about the case of Cardinal Mindszenty?"
I felt I'd rather not try to answer those ques
tions. Needless to say, I flunked the test.
Running the dangerous risk of meeting people
from all over the world, 1 tried to tell them about
things they were never told officially. When the
official interpreters were of a different opinion,
ihe people 1 met sometimes didn't believe me.
Often they couldn't understand why I didn't want
10 discuss these problems with the official inter
preters freely why I was even afraid to meet
1 hem.
One of the English visitors, a politics and eco
nomics major at Cambridge and an old friend of
mine, told me he was not interested in my per
sonal opinion, because my family had suffered in
lives and in property from the Soviet regime. But
he was truly interested in the opinions of the
"man on the street."
So I took him to the different factory districts
of Budapest, where we waited in hidden streets
ai "leave" lime, 4 p.m. Without exception, after
realizing that my friend was a "real Western
::uy," they looked around cautiously and would
say to me: '"Ask him, for heaven's sake, when
1 hey are coming to liberate us. Tell him we have
been robbed of our freedom, have to work as hard
as we can, and we can hardly stand it any more."
This experience was still not enough until we
had seen a man in an apparently good mood one
Saturday afternoon. Saying "hello" to each other,
we began to converse. Shortly we found out that
Hie man had worked in England for four years
as a typist. Not needing me as an interpreter, he
poured out his heart to my English friend, who
w as deeply impressed and became convinced.
The result was what one could expect. I was
arrested and charged with high treason and es
pionage and sentenced to in year's' imprisonment.
Luckily I had to serve only seven years.
I might add that my English friend, knowing
my ill luck, became a priest and has a nice par
sonage near Liverpool, his home town.
I do not wish to imply that Mr. Williamson
should become a priest of any kind, but I should
like to urge him to pray for the souls of the
people he met.

Editor, The Daily:
There are a great many people in America
today who are disgusted by the actions of Stan
ford student Earl Richard Williamson, and his
fellow traveling friends, whose trip to Commu
nist China during the past summer months was
given the "full treatment" in last week's Stan
ford Daily. It is unfortunate and representative
of poor thinking that The Stanford Daily saw fit
to publish the series a# a mere travelogue for it
is much more than that. The trip by Williamson
and friends has had disruptive and irrevocable
influences upon this country far greater than
anything that will happen around the Stanford
quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his
China expedition better than the hundreds of
career State Department and government offi
cials who have spent years of study on the end
results of actions such as those of Williamson
and his companions.
The Communists gave Williamson a cheap
good time and he now wants to repay them.
Whether he realizes it or not, his travel expenses
have been more than repaid. They were easily
repaid by the tremendous amount of propaganda
source-material which he helped generate.
Williamson "has expressed the desire to talk
to Stanford groups of any size. . . . He wants
to tell his fellow Americans about what he saw.
. . ." I'm sure that Williamson would like to talk
of how the Communists have set about recon
structing China. Many of us have seen how
Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in
Communist Chinese policy and attitude since
that time. It is unfortunate that the "fellow
Americans" to whom Williamson would like to
speak cannot be the 33,629 fellow Americans
whom Communist China killed in Korea, or
perhaps not even the 103,284 men whom they
wounded.
There is a quotation from William Saroyan
that goes: "What they" (the propagandists! "do,
boys, is creep up on you, and I don't mean In
dians. I mean Americans, over the radio, over
the waves, from platforms, pulpit, press and
curb." One must stop to wonder whether the
students who took the trip to China knew too
little about the techniques of propaganda or
whether they might possibly have known full
well how it works!
It is the duty of The Stanford Daily to report
the knews with responsibility and intelligence.
It is the job of the editors to recognize that there
is often more to a story than the mere words
that it contains. Williamson's story is reportable
information and it deserves to be printed by The
Daily, but it is strictly one man's opinion and it
should be clearly lit led and written as such. In
reading the articles one constantly has difficulty
in separating the opinions of Williamson from
the "statement of fact" type writing of the re
porter David Egger. Furthermore, I have no
ticed a conspicuous absence .4' editorial comment
by the Daily editors on the articles. Perhaps the
issue is too "hot" to handle or possibly the edi
tors cannot decide on whethet they should take
a stand. It might be easier to c utter tlie columns
with strictly noncommittal trivia.
Intelligent and discerning readers of The Dai
ly's articles on Williamson's trip will not think
of merely how much "fun" it would have been
if they too could have taken a free trip to Red
China. Instead they will pause and consider
what might be the real issues involved: irrespon
sible actions by selfish and misdirected individ
uals which possibly have had far-reaching ill
effects upon the United Stats government and
ihe principles which it represents, and the fact
that there are times when a person's own selfish
interests must be sublimated to the best inter
ests of the country as a whole.
11 my views are considered somewhat biased
it may be because of my experiences in the In
fantry, my work in counter-intelligence, what I
saw in Korea, and the memory of dead friends.
I regret to say that the United States still re
mains in a "quasi state of war" with Red China.
The attitudes and aims of Chinese Communism
have not changed since Korea, nor will they
change by visiting Americans flashing through
the countryside looking around. Although in
comprehensible to many in America today, wars
nevertheless are fought with jagged and ripping
steel, burning phosphorus, slicing bayonets, and
PROPAGANDA. In ihe past history of Amer
ica there have been cases of men who sold rifles
and ammunition so that Indians could raid and
murder settlers. These men were paid with mon
ey and furs. "Ammunition" for the war we now
find ourselvs involved in is perhaps being bought
by "free trips." Good intentions mean little.

quadrangle for many years to come.
Prior to Stanford student Williamson's depar
ture on his "cut-rate propaganda junket to Com
munist China," this urgent message from Acting
Secretary of State Christian A. Herter was for
warded to them: "Dear Fellow Citizen, By trav
eling to Communist China at this time you will,
in the considered view of your government, be
acting as a willing tool of Communist propa
ganda intended, wherever possible, to subvert
the foreign policy and the best interests of the
U.S." By his very actions, Williamson completely
rejected ihe pleas of the United States govern
ment. Although he states that he realizes that
his 23 days in Red China do not make him an ex
pert on China, yet he ostensibly feels lhat he is
qualified to judge the damaging effects of his
China expedition better than the hundreds of
career State Department and government offi
cials who have spent years of study on the end
results of actions such as those of Williamson
and his companions.
The Communists gave Williamson a cheap
good time and he now wants to repay them.
Whether he realizes it or not, his travel expenses
have been more than repaid. They were easily
repaid by the tremendous amount of propaganda
source-material which he helped generate.
Williamson "has expressed the desire to talk
to Stanford groups of any size. . . . He wants
to tell his fellow Americans about what he saw.
. . ." I'm sure that Williamson would like to talk
of how the Communists have set about recon
structing China. Many of us have seen how
Communist China set out to reconstruct Korea
and there has been no fundamental change in
Communist Chinese policy and attitude since
that time. It is unfortunate that the "fellow
Americans" to whom Williamson would like to
speak cannot be the 33,629 fellow Americans
whom Communist China killed in Korea, or
perhaps not even the 103,284 men whom they
wounded.
There is a quotation from William Saroyan
that goes: "What they" (the propagandists! "do,
boys, is creep up on you, and I don't mean In
dians. I mean Americans, over the radio, over
the waves, from platforms, pulpit, press and
curb." One must stop to wonder whether the
students who took the trip to China knew too
little about the techniques of propaganda or
whether they might possibly have known full
well how it works!
It is the duty of The Stanford Daily to report
the knews with responsibility and intelligence.
It is the job of the editors to recognize that there
is often more to a story than the mere words
that it contains. Williamson's story is reportable
information and it deserves to be printed by The
Daily, but it is strictly one man's opinion and it
should be clearly lit led and written as such. In
reading the articles one constantly has difficulty
in separating the opinions of Williamson from
the "statement of fact" type writing of the re
porter David Egger. Furthermore, I have no
ticed a conspicuous absence .4' editorial comment
by the Daily editors on the articles. Perhaps the
issue is too "hot" to handle or possibly the edi
tors cannot decide on whethet they should take
a stand. It might be easier to c utter tlie columns
with strictly noncommittal trivia.
Intelligent and discerning readers of The Dai
ly's articles on Williamson's trip will not think
of merely how much "fun" it would have been
if they too could have taken a free trip to Red
China. Instead they will pause and consider
what might be the real issues involved: irrespon
sible actions by selfish and misdirected individ
uals which possibly have had far-reaching ill
effects upon the United Stats government and
ihe principles which it represents, and the fact
that there are times when a person's own selfish
interests must be sublimated to the best inter
ests of the country as a whole.
11 my views are considered somewhat biased
it may be because of my experiences in the In
fantry, my work in counter-intelligence, what I
saw in Korea, and the memory of dead friends.
I regret to say that the United States still re
mains in a "quasi state of war" with Red China.
The attitudes and aims of Chinese Communism
have not changed since Korea, nor will they
change by visiting Americans flashing through
the countryside looking around. Although in
comprehensible to many in America today, wars
nevertheless are fought with jagged and ripping
steel, burning phosphorus, slicing bayonets, and
PROPAGANDA. In ihe past history of Amer
ica there have been cases of men who sold rifles
and ammunition so that Indians could raid and
murder settlers. These men were paid with mon
ey and furs. "Ammunition" for the war we now
find ourselvs involved in is perhaps being bought
by "free trips." Good intentions mean little.

Editor's Note: We are reporters, not judges.
We print articles of news interest; it is not our
place to condemn or to applaud. Were we as
biased as your letter seems to indicate, would
we have run your letter?
But, in a way, you are right. An editorial

when the letters don't keep filling up the edi

Editor. The Daily:
The "paper," published by the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University on the days of Oct.
1(5, 1< and 18, could have been called "The Stan
ford Daily Worker" without being misnamed.
I am nauseated by the knowledge that a por
tion of my tuition money has been used to pub
lish the Communist Party Line.
