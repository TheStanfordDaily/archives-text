# THIS WEEK ON QUAD
## Scholarly Side to Stanford Life 
### 
While Stanford students rejoice over the fact
that good old U. of Wash, has been taken to the
cleaners, it is time to remember that there is also
the scholarly side to attending SU.
Today's scintillating headliner is that old
standby, the School of Mineral Sciences Journal
Club, which meets in 320 at 4 p.m. Clyde Wahr
haftig will discuss "Rock Glaciers in the Alaska
Range." Hear it's a critique of that best-selling
cook-book, "How to Make Baked Alaskas That
Are as Tender as Rock Glaciers Cooked on the
Gas Range." Free glaciers to all who attend.
If you have two heads and an extremely long
pair of necks, you can also catch the Department
of Biological Sciences Seminar at Room 430.
Mrs. Ruth Elliott will give inside information on
"New Zealand Vegetation." That New Zealand
vegetation, broiled gently and well seasoned with
parsnips, is a tasty thing to serve with Baked
Alaska glacier.

The Tuesday Evening Series program will fea
ture a United Nations Day talk by J. D. Saund,
California Representative to the 85th Congress.
The place is Mem Aud; time, 7:30.
Dawn is guaranteed to be unbelievably ugly
Wednesday morning: the first Chappie will be
peddled around Quad by that hard-working
(when sober) (i.e., they don't do much work)
Hammer and Coffin crew. Bigger and better
repeats are promised for this issue, which prom
ises to be a sell-out if you don't reach the stands
by 2045 A.D.
Professor R. Hofstadter will address the Phys
ics Department Colloquium Wednesday ai 4 p.m.
in Room ph 101. The subject will bo "Recent
Results in Electron Scattering."

And then there's the Wednesday Matinee. Mrs. I
Jacques Rieuf will discuss "Giraudoux and the j
French Contemporary Scene" at the Mem Aud |
Little Theatre at 4:15. When the program's over, i
don't bo surprised if one or two changes have
taken place in the French government while you |
were attending the lecture. Giraudoux just may
be the new French premier.
History and the Department of Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering Seminar march on. Dr.
Kenneth S. Pitzer of Cal will discuss "Predict
ing the Properties of Fluids." Seems it would be j
more fun to discuss "Predicting the Properties
of Certain Persons after a Few Cases of Cer- ,
tain Fluids." Oh, well, come to c2fl at 4:15 fori
the info.

Another 1 titanic colloquium is due Thursday
when the Math Department gets together to
heai- Dr. Karel deLeeuw on "Functions on Cir
cular Subsets of the Space of N-Complex Vari
ables." After' the lecture the group will take off
in a space ship to calculate Sputnik's orbit.
Trundle your slide-rule to Room slo4 at 3:15.
Grrowwwfff! "Tiger at the Gates" by Jean
Giraudoux (thai fellow we're backing for pre
mier) will be presented by the Stanford Players

Zounds! A real epic is scheduled to erupt '
forth upon the Sunday Evening Flicks audience
. . . it's "Volcano," filmed exclusively in Strom
boliscope and Piz/.acolor! Anna Magnani will be
ihe star. Here at last is a picture destined to
drown out the rioting audience at the flicks! No
meatball tossing will be allowed, either-.

Zounds! A real epic is scheduled to erupt '
forth upon the Sunday Evening Flicks audience
. . . it's "Volcano," filmed exclusively in Strom
boliscope and Piz/.acolor! Anna Magnani will be
ihe star. Here at last is a picture destined to
drown out the rioting audience at the flicks! No
meatball tossing will be allowed, either-.
While Stanford students rejoice over the fact
that good old U. of Wash, has been taken to the
cleaners, it is time to remember that there is also
the scholarly side to attending SU.
Today's scintillating headliner is that old
standby, the School of Mineral Sciences Journal
Club, which meets in 320 at 4 p.m. Clyde Wahr
haftig will discuss "Rock Glaciers in the Alaska
Range." Hear it's a critique of that best-selling
cook-book, "How to Make Baked Alaskas That
Are as Tender as Rock Glaciers Cooked on the
Gas Range." Free glaciers to all who attend.
If you have two heads and an extremely long
pair of necks, you can also catch the Department
of Biological Sciences Seminar at Room 430.
Mrs. Ruth Elliott will give inside information on
"New Zealand Vegetation." That New Zealand
vegetation, broiled gently and well seasoned with
parsnips, is a tasty thing to serve with Baked
Alaska glacier.

The Tuesday Evening Series program will fea
ture a United Nations Day talk by J. D. Saund,
California Representative to the 85th Congress.
The place is Mem Aud; time, 7:30.
Dawn is guaranteed to be unbelievably ugly
Wednesday morning: the first Chappie will be
peddled around Quad by that hard-working
(when sober) (i.e., they don't do much work)
Hammer and Coffin crew. Bigger and better
repeats are promised for this issue, which prom
ises to be a sell-out if you don't reach the stands
by 2045 A.D.
Professor R. Hofstadter will address the Phys
ics Department Colloquium Wednesday ai 4 p.m.
in Room ph 101. The subject will bo "Recent
Results in Electron Scattering."

And then there's the Wednesday Matinee. Mrs. I
Jacques Rieuf will discuss "Giraudoux and the j
French Contemporary Scene" at the Mem Aud |
Little Theatre at 4:15. When the program's over, i
don't bo surprised if one or two changes have
taken place in the French government while you |
were attending the lecture. Giraudoux just may
be the new French premier.
History and the Department of Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering Seminar march on. Dr.
Kenneth S. Pitzer of Cal will discuss "Predict
ing the Properties of Fluids." Seems it would be j
more fun to discuss "Predicting the Properties
of Certain Persons after a Few Cases of Cer- ,
tain Fluids." Oh, well, come to c2fl at 4:15 fori
the info.

Another 1 titanic colloquium is due Thursday
when the Math Department gets together to

in a space ship to calculate Sputnik's orbit.
Trundle your slide-rule to Room slo4 at 3:15.
