# Audience Likes Operas Given By 3 Singers
## Lack of Full House Is Evening's Only Real Disappointment 
### Camille Petersen 
Colorful costumes and scenery:
combined with delightfully light
music of the After Dinner Opera
Company to provide an audience
of about 450 with an evening of
enjoyable entertainment Friday
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Pianist Emanuel Levenson set
the mood for the evening with
his opening chords and the stage
curtain opened to reveal a small
er stage complete with bright or-1
ange curtain.
The unique three-singer organ
ization presented the three mod
ern operas with freshness and
the impression of enjoying pre
senting the program as much as
the audience was enjoying watch
ing and listening.
Attention Held
Soprano Janne Beauvais, bass
baritone Francis Barnard and
tenor N'orman Myrvik held the
attention of the audi en c e
throughout the evening with
their fine portrayals of the hu- |
morous characters of the three
comedies.
Barnard received particular at- ;
tent ion when he appeared from
stage right in Jacques Offen
bach's "66" dressed as a peddler
with long-stringed balloons fast
ened to his top hat. An outstand
ingly hilarious portion was when
hefty, 6-2 Barnard appeared as
Persephone's mother in "Apollo !
and Persephone" by Gerald Cock- i
shott.
Especially enjoyable was the
music of Levenson. His mastery
of the piano made one wish to
hear him play alone.
Half Filled
The one disappointing factor
of the evening was ihe lack of a
full house. Sections one and four
of the 750 - capacity auditorium
were only about half filled. Stu
dents and area residents passed
up an enjoyable evening.
"The Telephone" by Gian-Carlo
Menotti showed the talkative fe
male and her fascination for the
telephone. The show was a suc
cessful Broadway production.
Tickets for the remaining sub
scription series con e'er t s are
available at Dinkelspiel box of
