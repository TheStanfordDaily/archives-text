# Washington Huskies Expected Same Old Team Got Fooled by Running, 'New Look' Cardinals
## 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
One aspect of Washington's
game against Stanford last Satur
day surprised plenty of people
but for the Indians it couldn't
have been a more pleasant sur
prise.
Apparently under the impres
sion that the "New Look" Indians
are really the same old passing
crowd of past years, the Huskies
tried to contain the Cards with
4-4-3, 4-3-4 and 5-3-3 defenses.
Pete Kmetovic, watching tire
game next to his telephone high
above the playing field, said after
the game: "I was amazed at some
of their defenses in certain situa
tions. I don't know if they were
confused, or what."
Pete was particularly startled
when Jim Owens' troops went
into the 4-3-4 when Stanford had

just one yard to go on a third-,
down play.
Through Tackle Kasily
The general consensus was that'
Stanford really had an easy time 1
moving through the Washington J
tackle slots. Kmetovic said they
seemed especially weak inside of
tackle on Stanford's close - end 1
side.
Armand DeWeese, who played
about half the game at tackle for
the Indians, said there never was
anyone opposite him or off either
shoulder when Stanford was on
offense. As a result he just kept j
moving out to screen off Wash-1
ington line-backers.
Taylor Surprised, Too
Coach Chuck Taylor was an
other who was surprised by the j
Washington tactics. He said Stan
ford had practiced against the;
four-man line defense since the j

Huskies had used it three gam
ago. But Taylor di d n't expt
Owens to employ it much agaii
the Cards, particularly when it <
veloped that Stanford could mo
so well against it.
Jackie Douglas related after t
game that he "kept calling vi
ning plays when they were goi
good." Probably the best examj
of tire Indians' ability to mo
through the Washington mirii
came near the end of the game.
••37—Slice!"
Douglas called one play in t
huddle and brought the team
to the line of scrimmage. He to
one look at the Huskie defer
and said, in a voice loud cnou
for all to hear, "37 slice!"
Even the forewarning did
help the Huskies, as Chuck Sli
took the handoff and sliced 1
five yards and a first down.
