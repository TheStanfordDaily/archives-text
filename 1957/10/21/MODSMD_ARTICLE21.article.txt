### 
A Stanford cross-country team
rated by coach Payton Jordan as
"just about twice as good as last
year's squad" finished second to
USC and beat Cal in the season's
first meet Saturday at Berkeley.
The Trojans scored a low of 30 :
points, to 37 for Stanford and 53 ;
for Cal.
Doug Martin led the Card con
tingent as he finished fourth be
hind the Trojans' trio of Max i
Truex, Mai Robertson and Wayne i
Lemons.
The Indians grabbed five of the
first 10 spots as they showed ex
cellent ability to run in a bunch.
It was this packing in together
that Jordan liked best about the
race.
Truex set a new course record
of 18:53 as he far outdistanced ,
the field.
Martin, who ran the same
course in 20:30 in the last race of
the 1956 season, negotiated the
rotue in 20:12 Miis time as he
demonstrated excellent improve
ment from last season.
Maury Graves ran sixth and
showed the best improvement
from last year. He cut his time
down 36 seconds to 20:15. Fresh
man Keith Wallace finished
eighth wilh an excellent clocking
of 20:30.
Boh Monzingo (20:32) and Bob
McGuire (20:36) were ninth and j
10th. McGuire's performance was j
especially encouraging to the
coaching staff, since he had been
laid low with influen/.a for several
weeks.
Stanford's two other entries, Al
Ahumada and Larry Suelzela, fin
ished 16th and 17!h. respectively, I

wilh times of 21:37 and 21:38. On
a dual-meet scoring basis, the In
dians whipped Cal, 22-33, but were
nipped by Troy, 25-30.
Although the Tribe didn't have
much trouble with Cal this time,

Jordan warned that tho next moot
ing with the Bears should bo
tougher, since they will have May
nard Orme and Dick Price back 111
top shapeâ€” which they weren't on
Saturday.
