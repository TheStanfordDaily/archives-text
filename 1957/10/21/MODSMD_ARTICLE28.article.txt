# Debate Students Hear Professor Ohlin Talk On U.S. Foreign Aid
## 
### 
Some 200 delegates to Stanford
Speech Association's eighth an
nual high school debate tourna
ment heard Stanford economics
professor P. Goran Ohlin tell why
he believes that the United States
would be admitting defeat if it
gave foreign aid through the Unit
ed Nations instead of as an inde
pendent nation.
Ohlin spoke on Saturday, the
second and final day of the con
vention. Fremont High School of
Sunnyvale emerged as sweep
stakes winner of the tournament,
while Merced and Alhambra high
schools came in for second and
third places, respectively, in the
sweepstakes division.
In individual debates, Alhambra
High came in first, followed by
Bellarmine High of Santa Clara
and Fremont of Sunnyvale. Tour
nament director was Gloria Bi
anchi.
Aid Reasons Change
In his speech to the debaters,
professor Ohlin pointed out that
the reasons for giving foreign as
sistance have changed within the
past several years. Previously aid
was given as an emergency meas
ure for purposes of reconstruc
tion.
Now assistance is necessary for
economic development in order to
balance the "tremendous econom
ic inequality" throughout the
world. The many underdeveloped
countries lack skills and educa
tional opportunities; they need
capital in the form of machinery,
tools and construction materials.
Although some technical aid is
being given through the United
Nations at present, Ohlin believes
there are several reasons why it
would be extremely impractical
for the United States to give ex
clusively through the UN. Con
gress wou 1 d lose control and
would not give as freely as it does
now, he said. Certain types of aid,
such as farm surpluses, could not
go through the United Nations.
Attitude Stressed
Stressing the importance of the
attitude in which aid is given,
Ohlin emphasized that this coun
try must not give aid only with
the objective of winning the
friendship and political support of
countries, as this produces irri
tation and a feeling of inferiority
on the part of the recipients.
"The United States must in
stead realize that the countries in
need of aid desire to maintain a
neutral stand in the cold war, and
she would be unwise not to tol
erate this wish," he said.
"We should also economically
assist countries in which there
may be a revolution, in order to
prove that U.S. sympathies extend
not only lo governments in power
but also to liberals, radicals and
Ihe 'common man.' "
If, however, the United States
cannot help countries unselfishly,
it would be better to give through
the United Nations, though this
would be admitting failure, Ohlin
concluded.

concluded.
Some 200 delegates to Stanford
Speech Association's eighth an
nual high school debate tourna
ment heard Stanford economics
professor P. Goran Ohlin tell why
he believes that the United States
would be admitting defeat if it
gave foreign aid through the Unit
ed Nations instead of as an inde
pendent nation.
Ohlin spoke on Saturday, the
second and final day of the con
vention. Fremont High School of
Sunnyvale emerged as sweep
stakes winner of the tournament,
while Merced and Alhambra high
schools came in for second and
third places, respectively, in the
sweepstakes division.
In individual debates, Alhambra
High came in first, followed by
Bellarmine High of Santa Clara
and Fremont of Sunnyvale. Tour
nament director was Gloria Bi
anchi.
Aid Reasons Change
In his speech to the debaters,
professor Ohlin pointed out that
the reasons for giving foreign as
sistance have changed within the
past several years. Previously aid
was given as an emergency meas
ure for purposes of reconstruc
tion.
Now assistance is necessary for
economic development in order to
balance the "tremendous econom
ic inequality" throughout the
world. The many underdeveloped
countries lack skills and educa
tional opportunities; they need
capital in the form of machinery,
tools and construction materials.
Although some technical aid is
being given through the United
Nations at present, Ohlin believes
there are several reasons why it
would be extremely impractical
for the United States to give ex
clusively through the UN. Con
gress wou 1 d lose control and
would not give as freely as it does
now, he said. Certain types of aid,
such as farm surpluses, could not
go through the United Nations.
Attitude Stressed
Stressing the importance of the
attitude in which aid is given,
Ohlin emphasized that this coun
try must not give aid only with
the objective of winning the
friendship and political support of
countries, as this produces irri
tation and a feeling of inferiority
on the part of the recipients.
"The United States must in
stead realize that the countries in
need of aid desire to maintain a
neutral stand in the cold war, and
she would be unwise not to tol
erate this wish," he said.
"We should also economically
assist countries in which there
may be a revolution, in order to
prove that U.S. sympathies extend
not only lo governments in power
but also to liberals, radicals and
Ihe 'common man.' "
If, however, the United States
cannot help countries unselfishly,
it would be better to give through
the United Nations, though this
would be admitting failure, Ohlin
concluded.
