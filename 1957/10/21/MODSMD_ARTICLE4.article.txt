; J MOSCOW (/P)—The Soviet Un
• ion issued a veiled warning yes
. terday that it will use nuclear
j rocket weapons if it must defend
. Syria in a war. Such a war, it
I said, would spread.
The warning came in an edito
-1 rial in Izvestia, the official gov
ernment newspaper, which called
' j it a "dangerous illusion" to as
i sume that a war in the Middle
East could be localized.
"It should not be forgotten that
both World Wars also started
with military actions of local
character," Izvestia said. "In our
age of rapid development of mili
tary techniques and atomic rocket
weapons it. is still more difficult
to limit the boundaries of any
armed conflict."
Russia accuses the United
I States of goading Turkey into an
attack on Syria. Soviet charges
say the U.S. has a plan for the
Turks to attack after Oct. 27
Turkey's parliamentary election
