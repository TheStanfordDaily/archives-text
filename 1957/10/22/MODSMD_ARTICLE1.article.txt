# Activity Center Construction To Begin Soon
## New Bookstore, Post Office, Union To Be Built Across From Cellar 
### David Quarles 
With the construction of the Student Activity Center sometime in
the near future a major change will take place in Stanford's campus.
The center, which will cover an area from north of Santa Teresa
Street to Eseondido Road and from cast of Lasuen Street to Lomita
Drive, will consist of two phases, the building units and the open

areas.
The three major units will be
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, a new
Post Office and Bookstore build
ing, and the Tresidder Memorial.
The Post Office - Bookstore unit
will get under construction this
academic year and will be placed
south of the present Bookstore in
a position directly opposite the
Student Union.
Tresidder Memorial, however,
is a more long-range project, the
construction date being undecid
ed. Its general location will be
northwest of Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, between Lasuen and Lo
mita. The memorial, named for
a past president of the Univer
sity, will consist of two connect
ed units.
Multi-purpose
The northernmost unit, de
signed to straddle Santa Teresa
Street, will see multi-purpose
service. Included in its plans are
stud en t organization offices,
lounges, fountain service and rec
reation facilities for bowling,
pingpong, pool and music listen
ing.
The second unit of the Tresid
der Memorial will be a large so
cial pavilion. Included in the
drawings will be dressing room
facilities and an Elizabethan-type
stage designed for a variety of
dramatic productions. However,
this unit's main function will be
for dances and social gatherings.
There will be two major open
area focal points. A large stu
dent plaza for rallies and other
student gatherings is planned. A
more formal court will be con
structed between Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and the Tresidder Me
morial.
Original Philosophy
In releasing important infor
mation about the project, Plan
ning Office's John Lynd stated,
"We are retaining the philosophy
of Stanford's original architect."
Lynd explained the philosophy
as one of "park and walk." He
pointed out that when Olmstead
laid out. the Inner Quad in 1890
the Quad and arcades were de
signed strictly for pedestrian
traffic. "We want to continue
this philosophy in the building of
the Student Activity Center," he
added.
The mechanical details of the
"park and walk" system will in
clude the closing of Lasuen
Street from Engineering Corner
to Campus Drive. All other
streets in the area covered by the
center will, of course, be closed.
However, ample parking area is
included in the plans, Lynd as
sured The Daily.

"With the construction of more
academic buildings we hope to
close Lomita Drive between San
ta Teresa and Serra streets,"
Lynd added. "This would, of
course, necessitate the construc
tion of a new peripheral road on
the west side of the campus."
Lynd concluded that the final
goal of the "park and walk" plan
is to remove automotive traffic
from the congested center of the
campus and to encourage bicycle
and pedestrian traffic only in this
area.

south of the present Bookstore in
a position directly opposite the
Student Union.
Tresidder Memorial, however,
is a more long-range project, the
construction date being undecid
ed. Its general location will be
northwest of Dinkelspiel Audito
rium, between Lasuen and Lo
mita. The memorial, named for
a past president of the Univer
sity, will consist of two connect
ed units.
Multi-purpose
The northernmost unit, de
signed to straddle Santa Teresa
Street, will see multi-purpose
service. Included in its plans are
stud en t organization offices,
lounges, fountain service and rec
reation facilities for bowling,
pingpong, pool and music listen
ing.
The second unit of the Tresid
der Memorial will be a large so
cial pavilion. Included in the
drawings will be dressing room
facilities and an Elizabethan-type
stage designed for a variety of
dramatic productions. However,
this unit's main function will be
for dances and social gatherings.
There will be two major open
area focal points. A large stu
dent plaza for rallies and other
student gatherings is planned. A
more formal court will be con
structed between Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and the Tresidder Me
morial.
Original Philosophy
In releasing important infor
mation about the project, Plan
ning Office's John Lynd stated,
"We are retaining the philosophy
of Stanford's original architect."
Lynd explained the philosophy
as one of "park and walk." He
pointed out that when Olmstead
laid out. the Inner Quad in 1890
the Quad and arcades were de
signed strictly for pedestrian
traffic. "We want to continue
this philosophy in the building of
the Student Activity Center," he
added.
The mechanical details of the
"park and walk" system will in
clude the closing of Lasuen
Street from Engineering Corner
to Campus Drive. All other
streets in the area covered by the
center will, of course, be closed.
However, ample parking area is
included in the plans, Lynd as
sured The Daily.
New Koad
"With the construction of more
academic buildings we hope to
close Lomita Drive between San
ta Teresa and Serra streets,"
Lynd added. "This would, of
course, necessitate the construc
tion of a new peripheral road on
the west side of the campus."
Lynd concluded that the final
goal of the "park and walk" plan
is to remove automotive traffic
from the congested center of the
campus and to encourage bicycle
and pedestrian traffic only in this
area.
With the construction of the Student Activity Center sometime in
the near future a major change will take place in Stanford's campus.
The center, which will cover an area from north of Santa Teresa
Street to Eseondido Road and from cast of Lasuen Street to Lomita
Drive, will consist of two phases, the building units and the open

areas.
The three major units will be
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, a new
Post Office and Bookstore build
ing, and the Tresidder Memorial.
The Post Office - Bookstore unit
will get under construction this
academic year and will be placed
south of the present Bookstore in
a position directly opposite the
Student Union.
