the Turkish-Syrian crisis.
This word came as Sir Leslie

debate on the Middle East prob
lem.
Turkish ambassador Seyfullah
Esin said his government had in
formed the Saudi Arabian mon
arch it was prepared to take part
in mediation efforts. Esin heads
Turkey's UN delegation.
But Syria denied published im
ports that Damascus had agreed
to mediation now. A statement
from the Syrian UN delegation
said such reports are "not in con
formity with fact."
To Meet Saud
In Washington, the Saudi Ara
bian embassy issued a statement
saying that both Turkey and
Syria had accepted the mediation
offer, and that a Syrian delega
tion would meet Saud within the
next two days.
A spokesman at the Syrian em
bassy said the embassy had no
direct word from Damascus, but
he considered the Saudi Arabian
information as accurate. U.S. of
ficials also said Syria as well ;>
Turkey had agreed to the medi
at ion.
Western delegates conferred
privately on the best way to con li
ter Syria's Soviet-backed charge
that Turkey is about to start wai
in the Middle East. Diplomats at
the United Nations believed Syt i;i
wanted a full airing of its ehar;;( ,
in the Assembly before considn
ing any other course.
Charges Attack
Syria and Ihe Soviet Union
charge that Turkey has amas ed
troops at the Syrian border, on
urging of the United States, to
attack Syria after the Turki It
elections next Sunday.
Syria has asked that a UN i,
quiry commission be appointed i\v
the Assembly to investigate the
situation on the Syrian-Turkish
frontier, and the Soviet Union ha.;
proposed setting a two week
deadline for the commission to
file reports with both the A:i•
bly and the Security Council on
the commission's findings.
The United States supported in
troduction of Syria's complaint
for debate by the UN General A
sembly, but made it clear it di

charges. There was no opposition
whatever to placing the complaint
on the agenda. The vote last Fri
