i-'«*iof a number of Americans who visited
<.««1111111111isI China litis past summer al ihe
ex press invitation of the existing government
in thai country.
Tlir <|ui'siion of whether he was right or
wrong in doing so is one that is hring debated
among students, among faculty members, |»oli
tiiiins, statesmen and. yes, even State Depart
ment |»olicv-inakers. Most of all, to them —the
policv-makers il is a live, a pertinent and far
I mm si'll led issue.
W as Williamson acting correctly in his de
cision to go to Red China? We feci lie did not
make the correct decision. But, then, the whole
question is a difficult one.
In the first place, the criteria hv which we
must make our judgment are far from clear-cut
facts. In fact, nothing about this whole thing
is clear cut except possibly the fact that Wil
liamson made the I rip, and the fact that the
State Department requested him and the others
not to go.
Technically, il is true that the United States,
as a member of the United Nations, is still at
war with Red China. There has been a truce—
hut no set I lenient. And il is also true that the
I niled Slates does not recognize the Commu
nis! government of Ked China.
Ihil there are other sides to an issue. Per
haps, as Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas lias suggested in his writings, if we had

recognized the Red Chinese government before
the Korean war had started, Americans would
not have had to light Chinese soldiers in thai
far-away country.
Certainh all will admit that the end purpose
of foreign relations is lo create complete under
standing between peoples and nations. And
certainly most will admit that measures taken
lo effect a short-run policy are often detrimen
tal lo a long-range policy.
We feel that W illiamson, in his way, was
aiding our foreign relations lo his own way of
thinking. We cannot conceive of his decision
as a purposeful flouting of American policy,
lu other words, we feci that \\ illiamson did not
use quite the necessary discretion when making
his decision. Hut when there is more than one
path lo the same goal, it becomes very difficult
lo decide which one lo take.
Therefore we cannot find il in ourselves to
condemn W illiamson. Nor can we condone his
action. What effects of good or evil these
actions by that group of Americans will eventu
ally create, we cannot tell. Nor can anyone
else—not even John Foster Dulles.
But when policy has been made—-good or
bad— that is the policy: and, according to our
democratic beliefs, should we not like that pol
icy, we should seek to change it by changing
public opinion not by acting contrarv to that
policy.
Unfortunately, wisdom in these things is in
deed a rarity.
