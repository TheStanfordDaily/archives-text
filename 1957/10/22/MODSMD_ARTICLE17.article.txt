The UCLA Daily Bruin has been challenged by
at least one reader on its policy of avoiding con
flict and controversy. Jerry Collins, in his letter
to the editor, attacks the DB's passive attitude,
charging, "At this writing the DB has yet to get
its feet wet in the main currents of student in
terest and debate." As examples Collins names
the parking problem, the shackling of UCLA by
the PCC, and the Students' Store.

exercise or instruction." The Campus Religious
Council president Julie Lond was "disappointed.
We understand that this is a rather delicate legal
questio nand we appreciate the fact that the Uni
versity has co-operated with us in previous

A San Jose State student is calling for a lady
tarantula. According to the SJ Spartan, Jerry
Reamer found Harry, a full-grown tarantula, in
the Mojave Desert, and adopted him. But Harry
won't eat. because, says a biology professor, it's
mating season. So Harry languishes in his fruit
jar, literally starving for love, while Reamer
tries to play Cupid.
