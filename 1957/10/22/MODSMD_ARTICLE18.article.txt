## Liver or Salmon 
### Rich Brown, Associate Editor 
Thorn's no doubt about it. Tf Encina Commons
dining hall wants to got some of these "health
foods" into your stomach you'd better make up
your mind that Encina has the upper hand—or
else starve.
Specifically, several hundred of us graduate
students arc thinking of Friday night's grand
election—salmon or liver. It was a great .joke
when the ticket puncher announced that the
choice was salmon or liver. Everyone was gay
and joked about that witty ticket man, until . . .
<>h, no! It couldn't lie. But it was. As the
victims filed by the serving line, one by one, each
was given a choice salmon or liver.
Fortunately, some of the people eating at En
cina Friday night did like at least one of the
choices. But from the others there were a few
groans,and turned-up noses as they sat flown at
1 he tables to sort the salmon meat from among
the hones or try to down the bitter-tasting liver.

One chap succeeded in eating the two strips of
bacon on the liver. That was all.
"Our real choice tonight," commented one
woman, "was whether we could have our mashed
potatoes with or without gravy." As the evening
wore on, those who chose not to eat still got en
joyment of the entrees via their nostrils.
For the most part, Encina has excellent food.
Perhaps Friday's food was also good — if you
liked either salmon or liver. Let us hope in the
future that we at least have the choice of one
of the old standby foods, like roast beef or ham
burger.
Some people admittedly have strong stomachs
for "delicacies," but there are those of us who
like to have just plain ordinary nourishment.
Maybe liver or fishy entrees are good for us, but
most of us are old enough to decide for ourselves
what we want to eat.
Please. Encina, don't corner us like that any
more. We want to be able to laugh instead of
gag the next time the ticket puncher tells a joke.
