# Stanford Songs Began on Quad in 1891 With 'Wah Hoo,' 'Rush the Ball Along'
## 
### Lynne, Gallagher 
Evolution of Stanford songs,
heard at football games, frater
nity parties and freshman girls'
dorms, began in October 1891 in
j the middle of the Quad. Ileie the
| first freshman class passed ihe
word along to give—at a signal
Stanford's first extemporaneous
varsity yell.
This "Wah Hoo! Wah Hoo! L!
S! J! U! Stanford!" came only,
as a fusillade of syllables, but it
demonstrated the enthusiasm that
in the next few months produced
fight songs for the first football
season. "Rush the Ball Along"
came first, followed by "Eleven
Men with a Pigskin Bag."
Two years later "Hail. Stanford,
! Hail!," the oldest surviving Cardi
nal favorite, was contributed by
professor Albert W. Smith and his
wife.
These first four years about 20
songs were written, representing
various themes. The themes have
been classified as: football, 35 per
! cent ; Stanford campus life, 20 per
cent; "facetious attentions to the
home of envy, hatred and malice
across the Bay," 15 per cent;

drinking songs and toasts, farce,
alma mater and Stanford spirit
songs, 30 per cent.
Our present-day Cardinal favo
rites have continued from the
first of the century.
"Hail! Alma Mater" was writ
ten by Weston Wilson, '13. "Come
Join the Band" came in 1913, with
words by Aurania Ellerback. "The
Cardinal Is Waving" was added to
the list by W. (J. Paul, '15, about
the same time "Sons of the Stan
ford Red" was written. Another
Stanford song that has survived
half a century is "A Son of a
Gambolier," written by the boys
who graduated around 1905.
More recent additions in Stan
ford Songs are "The Big Red
Machine" and"The Stanford
Scalp Song." The former was
written by Wally White, copyright
1949; the latter by Irving Bibo
around 1946.
A few of the formerly most
popular songs are now fading out.
"The Bum Bum Song" was begun
in 1904 and was sung to rival
Berkeley.

from his studies; as a sophomore,

maiden in the Cactus Gardens;
when a senior, he struggles over
a thesis in hopes of getting an
A.8.; finally he is counting the
dimes in his jeans up in the city,
away from "calm college scenes."
Back in 1905 the men sang "A
Health to the Stanford Girl." Then
"Ballad of ye Roble Maid'' intro
duced the theme that is now car

Indian Maid"

Larry Bowman's "One, Two,

Three Four" tolls of the resolving
freshman who is soon corrupted
from his studies; as a sophomore,
he drinks beer at a tavern; as a
junior, he pledges his love to a
maiden in the Cactus Gardens;
when a senior, he struggles over
a thesis in hopes of getting an
A.8.; finally he is counting the
dimes in his jeans up in the city,
away from "calm college scenes."
Back in 1905 the men sang "A
Health to the Stanford Girl." Then
"Ballad of ye Roble Maid'' intro
duced the theme that is now car
ried in the popular "Poor Little
Indian Maid"
Evolution of Stanford songs,
heard at football games, frater
nity parties and freshman girls'
dorms, began in October 1891 in
j the middle of the Quad. Ileie the
| first freshman class passed ihe
word along to give—at a signal
Stanford's first extemporaneous
varsity yell.
This "Wah Hoo! Wah Hoo! L!
S! J! U! Stanford!" came only,
as a fusillade of syllables, but it
demonstrated the enthusiasm that
in the next few months produced
fight songs for the first football
season. "Rush the Ball Along"
came first, followed by "Eleven
Men with a Pigskin Bag."
Two years later "Hail. Stanford,
! Hail!," the oldest surviving Cardi
nal favorite, was contributed by
professor Albert W. Smith and his
wife.
These first four years about 20
songs were written, representing
various themes. The themes have
been classified as: football, 35 per
! cent ; Stanford campus life, 20 per
cent; "facetious attentions to the
home of envy, hatred and malice
across the Bay," 15 per cent;

drinking songs and toasts, farce,
alma mater and Stanford spirit
songs, 30 per cent.
Our present-day Cardinal favo
rites have continued from the
first of the century.
"Hail! Alma Mater" was writ
ten by Weston Wilson, '13. "Come
Join the Band" came in 1913, with
words by Aurania Ellerback. "The
Cardinal Is Waving" was added to
the list by W. (J. Paul, '15, about
the same time "Sons of the Stan
ford Red" was written. Another
Stanford song that has survived
half a century is "A Son of a
Gambolier," written by the boys
who graduated around 1905.
More recent additions in Stan
ford Songs are "The Big Red
Machine" and"The Stanford
Scalp Song." The former was
written by Wally White, copyright
1949; the latter by Irving Bibo
around 1946.
