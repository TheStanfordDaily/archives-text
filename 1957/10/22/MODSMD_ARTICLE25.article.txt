No one has to look at his football schedule to find out that the
"big, bad Bruins fr om West wood-" invade Stanford's huge, earthen
bowl this weekend.
Noi sinoe 1958 has Stanford taken one from Ihe I{ed Sanders
coached eleven. And Coach Chuck Taylor has beaten I he single-wing
master only twice his first year on the Farm in 1951 <21 7i and in
1953 <21-20t. The Indians fell to the Bruins by a score of 24-11 in
1952, 72-0 in 1954, 21-13 in 1955 and 1413 last year.
UCLA will undoubtedly enter the game as favorites, having won
four games in five starts. They have defeated the Air Academy, Illi-

nois, Washington and Oregon
State. Their only setback came
at the paddling of the Oregon
Ducks who found their swim
ming-pool-like field just the place
to dump the Westwood gang.
All of Sanders' teams are al
ways well versed on fundamen
tals, whether they include sen
iors or not. A lugged, charging
defense is another keynote of the
Sanders-type of ball. The Bruins
have pulverizing power-runs up
the middle and the wingback-re
verses coupled with an air at
tack. Quarterback Don Long has

developed a passing arm and Dirk Wallen is one of the top receivers
around. Watch for Long starting around end in Prfnio Villanueva
style with arm cocked with option to run or let fly. And if it's punt
ing you like, watch Kirk Wilson turn the punt into one of their most
potent weapons. Wilson set an NCAA punting record with an aver
age of 49.3 yards on 30 punts last year.
The Indians will be going into the contest with a 3 win, 2 loss
record. The»first loss to Rice was a deserved win for the Owls, but
Ihe Washington State fluke . . . enough has been written about that.
The Cougars have run out of luck, having been downed bv Oregon,
14-13, last weekend. And they will probably be defeated by AT
LEAST three more (Oregon State, UCLA and Washington). WSC
has a chance against USC and Idaho. The Cards' three wins were
over neighbor San Jose State, Big Ten co-doormat Northwestern and
ready-for-their-first-win Washington. Roth Stanford and the Hus
kies played their best game of the season against each other last
weekend. And both need the win for morale's sake. Washington
just hasn't congealed yet and next week's foe won't help the cause
any. They meet a mad, defeated Oregon State.
AI Threads the Nee<lle
But out of the Indians' victory over Washington <21-14) came the
talk about Stanford making three consecutive Points After Touch
down. According to Daily Sports Editor Dick Barnes, who traveled
with the team to Seattle, all three of A 1 Harrington's placements
were dead center and hit the scoreboard. He opined that if kicked
from the 20-yard line they would have been good.
With Jack Douglas holding for Harrington, Stanford will make
most of its P.A.T.'s the rest of this year. In practice all week, both
•lack Taylor and Harrington were consistent, especially if Douglas
was holding. Only one thing can be said in favor of the sword
dancing Hawaiian kicking the extra points. His boots are stronger
than Taylor's.
UCLA will have their job cut out for them trying to stop the hard
running of ( buck Shea and Harrington, mixed with a Douglas-pass.
Not to forget Taylor, Stanford's two-way back who plays either right
half or quarterback with passing and running ability. Also, he is
probably the best all-around defensive back the Cards have.
There were so many excellent efforts in the Washington game
lhat when Coach Taylor had finished picking out the stars he had
named all the men on the first two teams. That's a good sign that
the 1957 Big Red Machine still possesses that "New Look," which
is the all-out team effort and team unity. With Gary Can Galder
back in the lineup and spirits high, I pick Stanford over UCLA Sat
urday with one last word of caution: WATCH THAT BRUIN OP
TION RUN-PASS PLAY.
SHOUT AND QUICKIES: Hanging around in front of the gym
after the last home game here were two ex-Stanford students, TV
and cinema stars Richard Boone and Jack Palance. . . . Playing his
sixth season with the Chicago Bears is former All-American end
hill McColl. . . . The Washington Huskies' new coach, Jim Owens,
was an All-American end for the 1949 Oklahoma team. Darrell
Royal, his predecessor and now head mentor at Texas, was the
Sooner quarterback. . . . Quarterback Bob Nicolet has been practic
ing drop-kicking field goals and has made most of them from about
25 yards out. . . . Assistant coach George Lynn was captain-quarter
back of the great 1942 Ohio State team under Paul Brown and back
field coach under Bud Wilkinson just before coming here. . . . Pete
Knietovie, rugby head coach and football assistant, was a halfback
on the same "Wow Boys" team that defeated Nebraska in the 1941
Rose Bowl, 21-13, as Coach Chuck. Kmetovic's razzle-dazzle runback
of a Nebraska punt accounted for one of the Cards' three TD's.
DON'T YOU JUST WANT TO CRY: Asked about the season's
prospects by Sports Illustrated, UCLA's great coach. Red Sanders,
answered: "Just like the situation at Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia
Tech, lowa or any other top university if you took away all ihe
seniors."

SHOUT AND QUICKIES: Hanging around in front of the gym
after the last home game here were two ex-Stanford students, TV
and cinema stars Richard Boone and Jack Palance. . . . Playing his
sixth season with the Chicago Bears is former All-American end
hill McColl. . . . The Washington Huskies' new coach, Jim Owens,
was an All-American end for the 1949 Oklahoma team. Darrell
Royal, his predecessor and now head mentor at Texas, was the
Sooner quarterback. . . . Quarterback Bob Nicolet has been practic
ing drop-kicking field goals and has made most of them from about
25 yards out. . . . Assistant coach George Lynn was captain-quarter
back of the great 1942 Ohio State team under Paul Brown and back
field coach under Bud Wilkinson just before coming here. . . . Pete
Knietovie, rugby head coach and football assistant, was a halfback
on the same "Wow Boys" team that defeated Nebraska in the 1941
Rose Bowl, 21-13, as Coach Chuck. Kmetovic's razzle-dazzle runback
of a Nebraska punt accounted for one of the Cards' three TD's.
DON'T YOU JUST WANT TO CRY: Asked about the season's
prospects by Sports Illustrated, UCLA's great coach. Red Sanders,

Saturday"* (*auie No Secret
No one has to look at his football schedule to find out that the
"big, bad Bruins fr om West wood-" invade Stanford's huge, earthen
bowl this weekend.
Noi sinoe 1958 has Stanford taken one from Ihe I{ed Sanders
coached eleven. And Coach Chuck Taylor has beaten I he single-wing
master only twice his first year on the Farm in 1951 <21 7i and in
1953 <21-20t. The Indians fell to the Bruins by a score of 24-11 in
1952, 72-0 in 1954, 21-13 in 1955 and 1413 last year.
UCLA will undoubtedly enter the game as favorites, having won
four games in five starts. They have defeated the Air Academy, Illi-

nois, Washington and Oregon
State. Their only setback came
at the paddling of the Oregon
Ducks who found their swim
ming-pool-like field just the place
to dump the Westwood gang.
All of Sanders' teams are al
ways well versed on fundamen
tals, whether they include sen
iors or not. A lugged, charging
defense is another keynote of the
Sanders-type of ball. The Bruins
have pulverizing power-runs up
the middle and the wingback-re
verses coupled with an air at
tack. Quarterback Don Long has

developed a passing arm and Dirk Wallen is one of the top receivers
around. Watch for Long starting around end in Prfnio Villanueva
style with arm cocked with option to run or let fly. And if it's punt
ing you like, watch Kirk Wilson turn the punt into one of their most
potent weapons. Wilson set an NCAA punting record with an aver
age of 49.3 yards on 30 punts last year.
The Indians will be going into the contest with a 3 win, 2 loss
record. The»first loss to Rice was a deserved win for the Owls, but
Ihe Washington State fluke . . . enough has been written about that.
The Cougars have run out of luck, having been downed bv Oregon,
14-13, last weekend. And they will probably be defeated by AT
LEAST three more (Oregon State, UCLA and Washington). WSC
has a chance against USC and Idaho. The Cards' three wins were
over neighbor San Jose State, Big Ten co-doormat Northwestern and
ready-for-their-first-win Washington. Roth Stanford and the Hus
kies played their best game of the season against each other last
weekend. And both need the win for morale's sake. Washington
just hasn't congealed yet and next week's foe won't help the cause
any. They meet a mad, defeated Oregon State.
AI Threads the Nee<lle
But out of the Indians' victory over Washington <21-14) came the
talk about Stanford making three consecutive Points After Touch
down. According to Daily Sports Editor Dick Barnes, who traveled
with the team to Seattle, all three of A 1 Harrington's placements
were dead center and hit the scoreboard. He opined that if kicked
from the 20-yard line they would have been good.
With Jack Douglas holding for Harrington, Stanford will make
most of its P.A.T.'s the rest of this year. In practice all week, both
•lack Taylor and Harrington were consistent, especially if Douglas
was holding. Only one thing can be said in favor of the sword
dancing Hawaiian kicking the extra points. His boots are stronger
than Taylor's.
UCLA will have their job cut out for them trying to stop the hard
running of ( buck Shea and Harrington, mixed with a Douglas-pass.
Not to forget Taylor, Stanford's two-way back who plays either right
half or quarterback with passing and running ability. Also, he is
probably the best all-around defensive back the Cards have.
There were so many excellent efforts in the Washington game
lhat when Coach Taylor had finished picking out the stars he had
named all the men on the first two teams. That's a good sign that

weekend. And both need the win for morale's sake. Washington
just hasn't congealed yet and next week's foe won't help the cause
any. They meet a mad, defeated Oregon State.
AI Threads the Nee<lle
But out of the Indians' victory over Washington <21-14) came the
talk about Stanford making three consecutive Points After Touch
down. According to Daily Sports Editor Dick Barnes, who traveled
with the team to Seattle, all three of A 1 Harrington's placements
were dead center and hit the scoreboard. He opined that if kicked
from the 20-yard line they would have been good.
With Jack Douglas holding for Harrington, Stanford will make
most of its P.A.T.'s the rest of this year. In practice all week, both
•lack Taylor and Harrington were consistent, especially if Douglas
was holding. Only one thing can be said in favor of the sword
dancing Hawaiian kicking the extra points. His boots are stronger
than Taylor's.
UCLA will have their job cut out for them trying to stop the hard
running of ( buck Shea and Harrington, mixed with a Douglas-pass.
Not to forget Taylor, Stanford's two-way back who plays either right
half or quarterback with passing and running ability. Also, he is
probably the best all-around defensive back the Cards have.
There were so many excellent efforts in the Washington game
lhat when Coach Taylor had finished picking out the stars he had
named all the men on the first two teams. That's a good sign that
the 1957 Big Red Machine still possesses that "New Look," which
is the all-out team effort and team unity. With Gary Can Galder
back in the lineup and spirits high, I pick Stanford over UCLA Sat
urday with one last word of caution: WATCH THAT BRUIN OP
TION RUN-PASS PLAY.
SHOUT AND QUICKIES: Hanging around in front of the gym
after the last home game here were two ex-Stanford students, TV
and cinema stars Richard Boone and Jack Palance. . . . Playing his
sixth season with the Chicago Bears is former All-American end
hill McColl. . . . The Washington Huskies' new coach, Jim Owens,
was an All-American end for the 1949 Oklahoma team. Darrell
Royal, his predecessor and now head mentor at Texas, was the
Sooner quarterback. . . . Quarterback Bob Nicolet has been practic
ing drop-kicking field goals and has made most of them from about
25 yards out. . . . Assistant coach George Lynn was captain-quarter
back of the great 1942 Ohio State team under Paul Brown and back
field coach under Bud Wilkinson just before coming here. . . . Pete
Knietovie, rugby head coach and football assistant, was a halfback
on the same "Wow Boys" team that defeated Nebraska in the 1941
Rose Bowl, 21-13, as Coach Chuck. Kmetovic's razzle-dazzle runback
of a Nebraska punt accounted for one of the Cards' three TD's.
DON'T YOU JUST WANT TO CRY: Asked about the season's
prospects by Sports Illustrated, UCLA's great coach. Red Sanders,
answered: "Just like the situation at Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia
Tech, lowa or any other top university if you took away all ihe

No one has to look at his football schedule to find out that the
"big, bad Bruins fr om West wood-" invade Stanford's huge, earthen
bowl this weekend.
Noi sinoe 1958 has Stanford taken one from Ihe I{ed Sanders
coached eleven. And Coach Chuck Taylor has beaten I he single-wing
master only twice his first year on the Farm in 1951 <21 7i and in
1953 <21-20t. The Indians fell to the Bruins by a score of 24-11 in
1952, 72-0 in 1954, 21-13 in 1955 and 1413 last year.
UCLA will undoubtedly enter the game as favorites, having won
four games in five starts. They have defeated the Air Academy, Illi-

nois, Washington and Oregon
State. Their only setback came
at the paddling of the Oregon
Ducks who found their swim
ming-pool-like field just the place
to dump the Westwood gang.
All of Sanders' teams are al
ways well versed on fundamen
tals, whether they include sen
iors or not. A lugged, charging
defense is another keynote of the
Sanders-type of ball. The Bruins
have pulverizing power-runs up
the middle and the wingback-re
verses coupled with an air at
tack. Quarterback Don Long has

developed a passing arm and Dirk Wallen is one of the top receivers
around. Watch for Long starting around end in Prfnio Villanueva
style with arm cocked with option to run or let fly. And if it's punt
ing you like, watch Kirk Wilson turn the punt into one of their most
potent weapons. Wilson set an NCAA punting record with an aver
age of 49.3 yards on 30 punts last year.
The Indians will be going into the contest with a 3 win, 2 loss
record. The»first loss to Rice was a deserved win for the Owls, but
Ihe Washington State fluke . . . enough has been written about that.
The Cougars have run out of luck, having been downed bv Oregon,
14-13, last weekend. And they will probably be defeated by AT
LEAST three more (Oregon State, UCLA and Washington). WSC
has a chance against USC and Idaho. The Cards' three wins were
over neighbor San Jose State, Big Ten co-doormat Northwestern and
ready-for-their-first-win Washington. Roth Stanford and the Hus
