# DOUGLAS EYES WIN
## SU Looks Forward to Bruins 
### Dick Barnes Shorts Editor 
"Are you going to beat UCLA?"
"YES!" replies Jackie Douglas,
in as authoritative a manner as if
the game had already been played.
Talking more about the upcom
ing game with the Bruins, Doug
las thinks Stanford will he ex
tremely high for the battle, par
ticularly after last Saturday's vic
tory over Washington.
The rest of the Indians we talk
er! to on the way back from Se
attle are also looking forward to
the Bruin encounter.
A1 Harrington, slightly more
conservative than Douglas, says,
"We'll have to work real hard for

i n e x t week." Don Manoukian
thinks Stanford will be high for
I the game "because we hate to
i lose to those guys from flown
there especially UCLA."
Win vim Help
The chief of the Indians, Chuck
| Taylor, thinks the victory over
| Washington will help Stanford in
! preparing for the UCLA game.
"Every team has to win a cer
tain number of games so the kirls
will know they can win. If they
lose confidence in themselves, it's
awfully hard to get i t back."
That's how the Tribe mentor
views the situation.
Looking back at the Washing
; ton tilt, Taylor was most impress
ed with Chuck Shea and A 1 liar
i rington and their excellent ball
carrying show.
Al to Keep Kicking
Naturally, Harrington's perfect
j score in extra-point kicking put a
j smile on Taylor's face. He said
Honolulu Al will kick P.A.T.'s "as
long as he can make 'em."
The fact thai the Washington
line wasn't charging the Cards ac
counted in some measure for
Stanford's failure to pass any
more than it did, according to
Taylor.
He said the Indians "will have
to increase the passing tempo"
because UCLA will probably come

in quite a bit harder and mor
often than did the Huskies.
Although pleased with the
ground game, Taylor said the In
dians "were cutting in too much,
rather than going wide." Wash
ington was as good as Taylor ex
pected them to be, but then he
commented "they're all tough."
The only bad news from trainer
Connie Jarvis concerned the con
dition of fullback Lou Valli. Jar-

Lou Valli is through for the
season and will undergo sur
gery this weekend, probably
Friday or Saturday, according
to Athletics News Service Di
rector Donald E. Liebendorfer.

vis said he was unable to tape
Valli's bad leg quite as tight as it
should be, with the result that it
was a bit loose when he ran.
Eric Protiva hurt a knee slight
ly in the fourth period. It was an
injury similar to that suffered by
Russ Steele earlier this year, ex
cept that it is probably not as
serious. Eric is expected to go
against UCLA.
Al Harrington was the on l,y
other casualty as he left the game
briefly due to a muscle cramp.

to increase the passing tempo"
because UCLA will probably come

in quite a bit harder and mor
often than did the Huskies.
Although pleased with the
ground game, Taylor said the In
dians "were cutting in too much,
rather than going wide." Wash
ington was as good as Taylor ex
pected them to be, but then he
commented "they're all tough."
The only bad news from trainer
Connie Jarvis concerned the con
dition of fullback Lou Valli. Jar-

Lou Valli is through for the
season and will undergo sur
gery this weekend, probably
Friday or Saturday, according
to Athletics News Service Di
rector Donald E. Liebendorfer.

vis said he was unable to tape
Valli's bad leg quite as tight as it
should be, with the result that it
was a bit loose when he ran.
Eric Protiva hurt a knee slight
ly in the fourth period. It was an
injury similar to that suffered by
Russ Steele earlier this year, ex
cept that it is probably not as
serious. Eric is expected to go
against UCLA.
Al Harrington was the on l,y
other casualty as he left the game
briefly due to a muscle cramp.
"Are you going to beat UCLA?"
"YES!" replies Jackie Douglas,
in as authoritative a manner as if
the game had already been played.
Talking more about the upcom
ing game with the Bruins, Doug
las thinks Stanford will he ex
tremely high for the battle, par
ticularly after last Saturday's vic
tory over Washington.
The rest of the Indians we talk
er! to on the way back from Se
attle are also looking forward to
the Bruin encounter.
A1 Harrington, slightly more
conservative than Douglas, says,
"We'll have to work real hard for

i n e x t week." Don Manoukian
thinks Stanford will be high for
I the game "because we hate to
i lose to those guys from flown
there especially UCLA."
Win vim Help
The chief of the Indians, Chuck
| Taylor, thinks the victory over
| Washington will help Stanford in
! preparing for the UCLA game.
"Every team has to win a cer
tain number of games so the kirls
will know they can win. If they
lose confidence in themselves, it's
awfully hard to get i t back."
That's how the Tribe mentor
views the situation.
Looking back at the Washing
; ton tilt, Taylor was most impress
ed with Chuck Shea and A 1 liar
i rington and their excellent ball
carrying show.
Al to Keep Kicking
Naturally, Harrington's perfect
j score in extra-point kicking put a
j smile on Taylor's face. He said
Honolulu Al will kick P.A.T.'s "as
long as he can make 'em."
The fact thai the Washington
line wasn't charging the Cards ac
counted in some measure for
Stanford's failure to pass any
more than it did, according to
Taylor.

to increase the passing tempo"
