The DU's, victorious over thej
Dolts in their first game, beat thei
KA's 19-6 last week and in the
process showed themselves to be
one of the more powerful teams.
KA scored first, but the DU's
struck back on the next series of i
downs on the strength of a Bob
Wallace to Harry Ilall pass.
The conversion was good and i
gave DIJ a half-time lead of 7-6.
When play resumed, Wallace j
threw twice to center Dennis j
Flammang to up the score to 19-
6. KA drove well in the closing
minutes, but was stopped short :
of the 'goal line by the DU de
fense.

displayed a versatile passing
game as they scored three times
