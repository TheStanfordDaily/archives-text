# THE 						SUN ALSO RISES'
## Movie Becomes So Much Bull 
### John Nickerson 
As a writer, Ernest Heming
way has spent a good deal of
time showing that the "lost gen
eration," once found, is incapable
of being saved.
His book, "The Sun Also
Rises," written during the '20's,
proves this significantly, and the
picture, currently at the Altos
Theater, manages to capture the
point also, even if fleetingly.
First, there's Paris—the Bohe
mian section where all the Amer
icans hang out. Here the princi
pal characters are introduced:
sad-faced, broad-shouldered Jake
Barnes (Tyrone Power); his spir
itually down - at - the - heels girl

friend, Lady Brett Ashley (Aval
Gardner); and Robert Colin (Mel|
Ferrer), a serious young man I
with a hard right to the chin.
Once having introduced this'
not-so-sanguine assortment, the;
picture changes location to Spain. I
and here it becomes so much
bull. Lady Brett finds herself,
deserted by Jake, who is out soul-1
searching, and turns her atten-1
tions to an unplucked toreador,!
fresh from a day's conquest in i
the ring.
Cohn, by now infatuated with
Brett, dccides to confuse things j
further by slugging a whole host
of people.
But in the end, with a sort of

piety which could only come
from the canyons of Culver City,
Lady Brett retains her by now
dowdy dignity, and Jake, the
novel's central figure, vows to
give up tormenting himself—for
a little while at least.
Yet the anguished survivors of
the Great War have lost a little
of their significance today, partly
because now, after a Greater
War, their suffering has been
forgotten. With success the pic
ture could have brought it clear
ly to mind; instead it turns far
too frequently away from the
characters, concentrates far too
much on the bull.
