# The 						Daily Proudly Presents...
## ...Its Freshman Queen 
### 
After searching far and near, through the
corridors of Branner and Roble Halls, The Stan
ford Daily has finally selected the girl it be
lieves to be, not only the most beautiful, but
the most charming and sweetest young thing in
the Class of '61.
Hailing from Compton, California, Jeannie is
five feet four and a half inches tall and hits 115
pounds on her bathroom scales. Her hair is
very dark brown with a slight reddish tint to it,
matching perfectly her deep blue eyes. And she
lias a soft dimple in her chin, too.
Jeannie hasn't quite decided on her major, but
believes it will probably be one of the social sci
ences. She came to Stanford on a California
State Scholarship which she received after her
acceptance here.
Besides studying and just looking beautiful
for the edification of all Stanford males, Jean
nie likes to paint. She says she prefers oils. She
also likes outdoor sports, especially swimming
(as any fool kin plainly see) and horseback rid
ing. "I like to dance a lot, too," she said when
the male members of the editorial board were
interviewing her.
Naturally these same males asked a number
of most pertinent questions, to one of which she
answered, "Since coming to Stanford, I have
heard a lot about the famous Stanford ratio.
But I have been more impressed with the out
standing qualities and personalities of the Stan
ford men I've met."

Jeannie's favorite activity uri campus is the
Sunday Night Flicks. She is the elder of two
girls. Her sister Karen is a 10-year-old blonde.
Quite a contrast!
Jeannie's carrying a class schedule of 14 units
this quarter and works in the main library
stacks in the afternoons. For relaxation Jean
nie likes to sit through Western shoot-'em-ups.
The male members of the editorial board are
agreed among themselves that with Jeannie
along, even a Western can be interesting.
As Jar as the present staff of The Daily
know, this is the first time in its history that
The Daily has decided to grace its pages with
a Freshman Queen. With this thought in mind,
the members of the editorial board kept their
eyes open wide during pre-reg week and rapidly
took down names of promising young freshman
candidates.
Sponsors from both Branner and Roble were
consulted. Soon a list of names began to grow.
From this list Hi girls were selected and called
into The Daily to have their pictures taken so
that the most photogenic ones would be discov
ered.
The editorial board spent hours discussing the
qualities of the 16 candidates. After numerous
votes taken, the hoard finally made its choice.
In the words of Editor Wally Simpson, "We are
more than satisfied with our choice. We scooped
Ihe Chappie on this one." The rest of the board
agrees with him.

five feet four and a half inches tall and hits 115
pounds on her bathroom scales. Her hair is
very dark brown with a slight reddish tint to it,
matching perfectly her deep blue eyes. And she
lias a soft dimple in her chin, too.
Jeannie hasn't quite decided on her major, but
believes it will probably be one of the social sci
ences. She came to Stanford on a California
State Scholarship which she received after her
acceptance here.
Besides studying and just looking beautiful
for the edification of all Stanford males, Jean
nie likes to paint. She says she prefers oils. She
also likes outdoor sports, especially swimming
(as any fool kin plainly see) and horseback rid
ing. "I like to dance a lot, too," she said when
the male members of the editorial board were
interviewing her.
Naturally these same males asked a number
of most pertinent questions, to one of which she
answered, "Since coming to Stanford, I have
heard a lot about the famous Stanford ratio.
But I have been more impressed with the out
standing qualities and personalities of the Stan
ford men I've met."

Jeannie's favorite activity uri campus is the
Sunday Night Flicks. She is the elder of two
girls. Her sister Karen is a 10-year-old blonde.
Quite a contrast!
Jeannie's carrying a class schedule of 14 units
this quarter and works in the main library
stacks in the afternoons. For relaxation Jean
nie likes to sit through Western shoot-'em-ups.
The male members of the editorial board are
agreed among themselves that with Jeannie
along, even a Western can be interesting.
As Jar as the present staff of The Daily
know, this is the first time in its history that
The Daily has decided to grace its pages with
a Freshman Queen. With this thought in mind,
the members of the editorial board kept their
eyes open wide during pre-reg week and rapidly
took down names of promising young freshman
candidates.
Sponsors from both Branner and Roble were
consulted. Soon a list of names began to grow.
From this list Hi girls were selected and called
into The Daily to have their pictures taken so
that the most photogenic ones would be discov
ered.
The editorial board spent hours discussing the
qualities of the 16 candidates. After numerous
votes taken, the hoard finally made its choice.
In the words of Editor Wally Simpson, "We are
more than satisfied with our choice. We scooped
Ihe Chappie on this one." The rest of the board
agrees with him.

After searching far and near, through the
corridors of Branner and Roble Halls, The Stan

the most charming and sweetest young thing in
the Class of '61.

five feet four and a half inches tall and hits 115
