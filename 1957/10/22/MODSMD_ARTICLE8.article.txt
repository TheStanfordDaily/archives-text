# STUTTGART CAMPUS
## No German 'Little America' 
### Neal Rosenberg 
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler told a group of Wilbur
freshmen the University admin
istration does not'want to make
a "little America" of Stanford's
new German branch.
Speaking in the lobby of Cedro
Hall recently, Winbigler dis
cussed the curriculum, food anrl
anticipated atmosphere of the
German campus, which will open
its doors to the first group of
Stanford students in June, 1958.
He emphasized that the cam
pus will retain a strict German
atmosphere. Meals will be pre
pared in the German manner,
with the exception that American '
health standards will be followed, i
he said.
A continental breakfast of
hard rolls, butter and coffee will
be served at 10 a.m. Winbigler
pointed out that morning hunger
would soon be alleviated, since
the Germans not only serve a
large noon meal but also serve

coffee and fruit cake at 3:30 p.m.
and a large supper a few hours
later.
A total of 30 units of work will
be assigned to students on the
foreign campus for their two
quarters' attendance. He said
that about half of the study time
will be devoted to the German
language.
Intense, pr a c t i c a 1 courses
given by local German instruc
tors will constitute the language
program, for which a probable
seven units of credit will be
given.
Two other courses will be of
fered, one in the field of humani
j ties and one in social science.
1 One of these will probably be
I World Literature, the dean said.
| There is a possibility that some of
the courses may be taken in ful
fillment of the general studies re
quirements.
The campus is located in an
area boasting one of Germany's
most moderate climates — al
though Winbigler felt the 30

: inches of rainfall and the 10-de
gree temperatures might cause
Californians to challenge the
word "moderate."
Twelve miles from Stuttgart,
the campus is within easy reach
of that city's cultural activities.
Social exchanges will probably be
arranged with two nearby Ger
man universities, lie said.
Good skiing is available one
hour from the campus. Many ex
cursions will be planned, and
classes may meet only four days
a week to allow more travel time,
Winbigler said.
He emphasized the flexible as
pects of the project's first year,
as class schedules may depend in
part on desires of the students
and faculty. "This will call for
some pioneering in student gov
ernment," Winbigler said.
The two quarters will be bro
ken by a two-week recess to al
! low more extensive travel. Stu
dents may remain in Europe af
ter the six-month study period to
I tour the continent.

Cost of Ihe two quarters in
Germany will be the same as that
for two quarters at Stanford. The
cost will include tuition, room,
board, a one-way plane ticket to
Stuttgart, and fares on Univer
sity-sponsored excursions. Stan
ford scholarships will be appli
cable for the program.
Application deadline for the
first term—summer and autumn
quarters of 1958 — will be near
the end of the present quarter.
Selections will be announced in
January.
Of the 250 who are expected to
apply, HO will be chosen. As the
program is essentially designed
for sophomores, most of the 60
will come from this year's fresh
man class. But members of oth
er classes are also invited to ap
ply, YVinbigler said.
A knowledge of German will
not be essential for the first year,
but preparatory classes will even
tually be established in German
laws, customs and language, he
said.

The campus is located in an
area boasting one of Germany's
most moderate climates — al
though Winbigler felt the 30

: inches of rainfall and the 10-de
gree temperatures might cause
Californians to challenge the
word "moderate."
Twelve miles from Stuttgart,
the campus is within easy reach
of that city's cultural activities.
Social exchanges will probably be
arranged with two nearby Ger
man universities, lie said.
Good skiing is available one
hour from the campus. Many ex
cursions will be planned, and
classes may meet only four days
a week to allow more travel time,
Winbigler said.
He emphasized the flexible as
pects of the project's first year,
as class schedules may depend in
part on desires of the students
and faculty. "This will call for
some pioneering in student gov
ernment," Winbigler said.
The two quarters will be bro
ken by a two-week recess to al
! low more extensive travel. Stu
dents may remain in Europe af
ter the six-month study period to
I tour the continent.

Cost of Ihe two quarters in
Germany will be the same as that
for two quarters at Stanford. The
cost will include tuition, room,
board, a one-way plane ticket to
Stuttgart, and fares on Univer
sity-sponsored excursions. Stan
ford scholarships will be appli
cable for the program.
Application deadline for the
first term—summer and autumn
quarters of 1958 — will be near
the end of the present quarter.
Selections will be announced in
January.
Of the 250 who are expected to
apply, HO will be chosen. As the
program is essentially designed
for sophomores, most of the 60
will come from this year's fresh
man class. But members of oth
er classes are also invited to ap
ply, YVinbigler said.
A knowledge of German will
not be essential for the first year,
but preparatory classes will even
tually be established in German
laws, customs and language, he
said.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler told a group of Wilbur
freshmen the University admin
istration does not'want to make
a "little America" of Stanford's
new German branch.
Speaking in the lobby of Cedro
Hall recently, Winbigler dis
cussed the curriculum, food anrl
anticipated atmosphere of the
German campus, which will open
its doors to the first group of
Stanford students in June, 1958.
He emphasized that the cam
pus will retain a strict German
atmosphere. Meals will be pre
pared in the German manner,
with the exception that American '
health standards will be followed, i
he said.
A continental breakfast of
hard rolls, butter and coffee will
be served at 10 a.m. Winbigler
pointed out that morning hunger
would soon be alleviated, since
the Germans not only serve a
large noon meal but also serve

coffee and fruit cake at 3:30 p.m.
and a large supper a few hours
later.
A total of 30 units of work will
be assigned to students on the
foreign campus for their two
quarters' attendance. He said
that about half of the study time
will be devoted to the German
language.
Intense, pr a c t i c a 1 courses
