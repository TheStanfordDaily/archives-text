# Congressman Lauds UN At Tues. Series Lecture
## Speaker Claims American Apathy Causes Foreign Policy Mistakes 
### 
"The United Nations has served a very useful purpose in averting
war and resolving difficult situations," Dalip Sing Saund, India-born
Southern California congressman, told the Tuesday Evening Series
audience last night in Memorial Auditorium.
Saund, speaking in observance of United Nations Week, explained
that the UN is both oversold and undersold. Elaborating on his state
ment, lie said that enthusiasts of the international organization have
expected more than any such group could possibly accomplish, while
its opponents fail to view the UN in a realistic manner.
" 1 he UN is a body of nations lo get together to compromise dif
ferences, and they have succeeded in this line very well," he said.
While firmly endorsing the United Nations, the speaker pointed
to mistakes in the United States' foreign policy in the Mid-East.
"We are a nation of super-salesmen," he said. "Why we have
failed to sell our way of life to the people in the underprivileged

countries is a mystery to me.
There can be only one explana
tion: the majority of the Ameri
can people have remained uncon
cerned with the ways of the peo
ple in other parts of the world.
"The peoples of Asia and Afri
ca are not debating which side to
choose; they want freedom and
the American way of life. The
key question is: Are the Ameri
cans willing and ready to accept
them as their equals in every re
spect ?
"If the answer is affirmative,"
Saund said, "there is nothing to
fear: but until the Americans are
willing to make this answer, the
threat of Communism will con
tinue to prevail in Asia and Af
rica.
One-Game Series
"We are engaged in a one-game
series with Russia which we
must not lose, because there will
not be another one. We have to
come out on top; there is no such
thing as second best."
"In'the Mid-East," the speaker
continued, "we are buying kings,
and sadly neglecting the people
of the area who need water and
food. Until we expend our ener
gies in working with the people
instead of placating the kings we
will not be able to come out on
top."
Saund pointed to British poli
cies of working only with rulers
and noted that the British were
"tossed out of India and the same
thing will happen to the United
States in the Mid - East, he
warned.
Agreement Sought"
"The U.S. people are looking
for agreement on disarmament,"
Saund added, "but Russia is not
going to accept any practical pro
gram of disarmament as long as
she thinks she can win the people
of Asia and Africa to her side.
This is where U.S. salesmanship
comes in.
"The influence of a peaceful
nation such as ours is greater
than that of Russia, if we can
convince the other countries that
wc have peaceful intentions,"
said the speaker, noting current
Russian propaganda against the
United States in Syria.
"However, we must keep up an
armed force," he emphasized.
In praising the United Nations,
Saund cited activities in the de
velopment of peaceful atomic en
ergy, raising standards of living
and progress toward disarma
ment. i
UN Leadership
"It is my firm belief," lie said,
that it is UN leadership which
has brought Syria and Turkey to
the council table in the current
crisis."
Saund also noted UN influence
in 1940 when Russia withdrew
from the borders of Iran and the
Indonesian Republic was estab
lished, as well as in 1950, "the
first time nations got together to
put up a united fight against ag
gression."
"The UN is also responsible for
the withdrawal of troops from
Egypt and Sinai and the force pa
trolling the Ga/.a Strip has been
influential in the cooling off of
the Mid-East hot spot," he said.
Sau nd's Stanford appearance
was sponsored by the Committee
on Public Exercises, the Political
Union and the lIR. Following
his address he attended a recep
tion in the Trancos lounge of
Wilbur Hall, answering students'
questions.
Saund, 58-year-old graduate of
the University of Punjab, holds a
Ph.D. degree in mathematics
from the University of Califor
nia.
He was elected to represent
Imperial and Riverside counties
in Congress after a campaign
against aviatrix Jacqueline Coch
ran. He is on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
The speaker leaves this week
on a two-month tour of Asia in
order to observe the working of
the mutual security program of
foreign aid.
