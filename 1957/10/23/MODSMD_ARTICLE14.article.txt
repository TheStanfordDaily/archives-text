# MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
## Stanford in Germany 
### David Egger 
Wilh much hand-clapping, back-slapping and
pi ni rii I Stanford enthusiasm, the University is
establishing a branch in Stuttgart, Germany. Be
fore ihe congratulatory din grows too loud. I
would iike to interject a question: What is this
ail about? Has Stanford discovered a method to
spread its paternal arm over 1 students on two
continents, not content with leaving the family
in sunny Palo Alto?
What is the purpose of studying abroad? A
year at a foreign university may teach a student
about foreign ways of life, force him to gain pro
ficienty in a foreign language and enable him
to gain perspective on American and especially
Stanford values. Studying at a German univer
sity means more than eating a continental break
last each morning at 10. It means living either
in a German home, a private apartment or a
student-run house, and not the German equiva
lent of "all but the most modern dormitories."
Living in Germany means living with Germans,
not students who are ideological replicas of one
self.
To be a foreign student among many natives,
to be a learner instead of a teacher, is an experi
ence every American can benefit by. Will this be
Ihe case in Stuttgart? No. Contact with Germans
will be chiefly limited to a few native instructors
and casual acquaintances made on hurried tours
to German cities. Those who have spent a sum
mer in Europe know the futility of tourism for
anything more than the most superficial sight
seeing.
A Stanford branch in Germany does not mean
that the price of foreign study will decrease. Stu
dents Recently returned from Germany report
that they went to and from Iho United States,
at tended a university and traveled Europe during
vacation period for less than the cost of three
quarters at Stanford. This was before the $255
increase in tuition.

Then what is the reason for establishing a !
Stanford adjunct in Stuttgart? I can only guess.
It is in line with the University's policy of making
everything as nice and easy as possible for its
students. Now students won't have to be mature
enough to apply to foreign universities on their
own, to find their own accommodations, to make
their own friends. Now the happy Stanford stu
dent need only press the Stuttgart button—and
there he is, all smiles, "Come Join the Band" on;
his lips, in Germany.
When he arrives home six months later, he !
may have gotten to know his American buddies
much better than he could have under the harried j
conditions here; he will have had an "experience" '
or two to relate; but, best of all, he can sport a
shiny "I've been to Germany" button.
We at Stanford should be grateful that our
administration and trustees are sincerely in
terested in helping us study abroad. But I believe
their efforts are misguided. Two services which
would help are (1) the liberalizing of transfer
credit policy and (2) making information con
cerning foreign universities — their strong and
weak departments, the types of accommodations j
available for foreign students, etc.—more readily'
accessible.
A major impediment to foreign study for many
students is that a year in Europe means an extra
year at Stanford. I think it reasonable to accept |
more foreign credits or to waive some of the j
General Studies requirements in the case of a
student spending a year abroad. Certainly a year
studying and living in Europe should have as
much general educational value as many of the
"culture courses" offered at Stanford. But two
quarters spent in Germany living in dormitories I
under the watchful eye of the deans and coun-!
selors might just as well have been speut on the !
Farm.

fore ihe congratulatory din grows too loud. I
would iike to interject a question: What is this
ail about? Has Stanford discovered a method to
spread its paternal arm over 1 students on two
continents, not content with leaving the family
in sunny Palo Alto?
What is the purpose of studying abroad? A
year at a foreign university may teach a student
about foreign ways of life, force him to gain pro
ficienty in a foreign language and enable him
to gain perspective on American and especially
Stanford values. Studying at a German univer
sity means more than eating a continental break
last each morning at 10. It means living either
in a German home, a private apartment or a
student-run house, and not the German equiva
lent of "all but the most modern dormitories."
Living in Germany means living with Germans,
not students who are ideological replicas of one
self.
To be a foreign student among many natives,
to be a learner instead of a teacher, is an experi
ence every American can benefit by. Will this be
Ihe case in Stuttgart? No. Contact with Germans
will be chiefly limited to a few native instructors
and casual acquaintances made on hurried tours
to German cities. Those who have spent a sum
mer in Europe know the futility of tourism for
anything more than the most superficial sight
seeing.
A Stanford branch in Germany does not mean
that the price of foreign study will decrease. Stu
dents Recently returned from Germany report
that they went to and from Iho United States,
at tended a university and traveled Europe during
vacation period for less than the cost of three
quarters at Stanford. This was before the $255
increase in tuition.

Then what is the reason for establishing a !
Stanford adjunct in Stuttgart? I can only guess.
It is in line with the University's policy of making
everything as nice and easy as possible for its
students. Now students won't have to be mature
enough to apply to foreign universities on their
own, to find their own accommodations, to make
their own friends. Now the happy Stanford stu
dent need only press the Stuttgart button—and
there he is, all smiles, "Come Join the Band" on;
his lips, in Germany.
When he arrives home six months later, he !
may have gotten to know his American buddies
much better than he could have under the harried j
conditions here; he will have had an "experience" '
or two to relate; but, best of all, he can sport a
shiny "I've been to Germany" button.
We at Stanford should be grateful that our
administration and trustees are sincerely in
terested in helping us study abroad. But I believe
their efforts are misguided. Two services which
would help are (1) the liberalizing of transfer
credit policy and (2) making information con
cerning foreign universities — their strong and
weak departments, the types of accommodations j
available for foreign students, etc.—more readily'
accessible.
A major impediment to foreign study for many
students is that a year in Europe means an extra
year at Stanford. I think it reasonable to accept |
more foreign credits or to waive some of the j
General Studies requirements in the case of a
student spending a year abroad. Certainly a year
studying and living in Europe should have as
much general educational value as many of the
"culture courses" offered at Stanford. But two
quarters spent in Germany living in dormitories I
under the watchful eye of the deans and coun-!
selors might just as well have been speut on the !
Farm.
