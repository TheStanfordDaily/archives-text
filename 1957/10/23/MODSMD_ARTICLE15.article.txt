Recognition of Red China
Editor, The Daily:
Within the past week much space has been dc
voted in The Daily to the visit of 41 American
students to Red China. This is fortunate, in that
lho subject will be well aired, and frankly dis
cussed. But there are also indications that the
problem will be confused with the wisdom of
non-recognition of Red China, and of State De
partment policy. This is unfortunate. For while
there is a certain relationship, the question is
quite different from those problems:
1. There may well exist sharp and reasoned
differences of opinion over Red China and its
recognition, the need for information about the
country, and of present State Department policy
iby no means in itself monolithic in agreement).
Hut we live in a democratic country, and in such,
every government and its policy are subject to
choice, change and modification by its citizens in
an orderly and prescribed manner, including free
speech, petition, assembly and voting - . This in
deed is the substance of the appeal of the free
world over the totalitarian Communist system.
Such being the case, it stands to reason that this
is the way one should effect one's disagreement
with policy, not by blithely ignoring it, going
one's own sweet way; that is the surest way to
encourage political and governmental chaos.
Many federal and state laws and procedures ex
ist with which I disagree, but this hardly gives
me cause to go out of my way to break them.
Many recognized the prohibition amendment as
;in invasion of personal freedom, but this gave
no moral sanction to bootlegging and bathtub
gin.
2. If one grants such foreign policy in a sup
posedly democratic state (whether it is right or
wrong), one wonders how ihe peoples of Asia
will then see such actions, helped, of course, by
Communist propaganda. Obviously the govern
ment is left with the choice either of being
shown to follow weak and unpopular policies
which it dares not enforce, or else of punishing
"poor" errants in some fashion, making the gov
ernment look small and ridiculous. Either way
we lose prestige and position. And would not it
be pointed out that American democracy is a
failure (or a myth* when "widely unpopular"
;ui(l (therefore) imposed doctrines are quickly

violated by those students who have a chance?
Certainly the pictures of American students
chatting with Chou En-lai or dipping the Ameri
can flag before Khrushchev will be shown to in
dicate the "real" American opinion. Consider j
too. if one does believe our policy to be without
public support, the lost opportunity to show
American democracy in action as outlined above, |
while actions as shown by the students cast real
doubts on its strength and effectiveness.
3. While our government warned all students
to travel at their own risk to Red China, there
is little doubt that had the Iron Curtain dropped
while they were there, moral pressure alone
would have forced us to agitate for their return,
a position virtually unenforceable short of war.
This would have increased world tension, while
making America look even more impotent to the
neutrals of Asia. We would have suffered an
other psychological defeat, quite unnecessarily.
In short, no person, even an expert (which Mr.
Williamson admittedly is not), can fully judge
the effect and results of such a move, and short
of this the least injurious method of switching a
foreign policy is the democratic procedure
above, expertly advised and directed, which will
at least enable America to realize and partially
direct the consequences of any policy it may
undertake, to partly fashion its effect on the rest
of the world. Because of this, I think citizens
should condemn the action of the 41 American
students, regardless of their own personal opin
ions of the wisdom of our Far Eastern foreign
policy.

Editor, The Daily:
What? No plus points in the Bawlout? The
Stanford men have just been robbed most
accurate method for pro-rating a blind date (next
to looking up ihe girl's picture in the Quad). A
high number of plus points per quarter indicates
either a brilliant woman or a very hard-working
one, either of which makes a poor date; whereas
a low number of plus points per quarter, or pref
erably minus, indicates a girl who came to Stan
ford to have some fun and will make good or
excellent date material.
What are us poor men going to do now?

to travel at their own risk to Red China, there
is little doubt that had the Iron Curtain dropped

a position virtually unenforceable short of war.
This would have increased world tension, while
making America look even more impotent to the
neutrals of Asia. We would have suffered an
other psychological defeat, quite unnecessarily.
In short, no person, even an expert (which Mr.

the effect and results of such a move, and short

foreign policy is the democratic procedure
above, expertly advised and directed, which will
at least enable America to realize and partially

students, regardless of their own personal opin

policy.

What? No plus points in the Bawlout? The
Stanford men have just been robbed most
accurate method for pro-rating a blind date (next
to looking up ihe girl's picture in the Quad). A
high number of plus points per quarter indicates
either a brilliant woman or a very hard-working
one, either of which makes a poor date; whereas
a low number of plus points per quarter, or pref

Recognition of Red China
Editor, The Daily:
Within the past week much space has been dc
voted in The Daily to the visit of 41 American
students to Red China. This is fortunate, in that
lho subject will be well aired, and frankly dis
cussed. But there are also indications that the
problem will be confused with the wisdom of
non-recognition of Red China, and of State De
partment policy. This is unfortunate. For while
there is a certain relationship, the question is
quite different from those problems:
1. There may well exist sharp and reasoned
differences of opinion over Red China and its
recognition, the need for information about the
country, and of present State Department policy
iby no means in itself monolithic in agreement).
Hut we live in a democratic country, and in such,
every government and its policy are subject to
choice, change and modification by its citizens in
an orderly and prescribed manner, including free
speech, petition, assembly and voting - . This in
deed is the substance of the appeal of the free
world over the totalitarian Communist system.
Such being the case, it stands to reason that this
is the way one should effect one's disagreement
with policy, not by blithely ignoring it, going
one's own sweet way; that is the surest way to
encourage political and governmental chaos.
Many federal and state laws and procedures ex
ist with which I disagree, but this hardly gives
me cause to go out of my way to break them.
Many recognized the prohibition amendment as
;in invasion of personal freedom, but this gave
no moral sanction to bootlegging and bathtub
gin.
2. If one grants such foreign policy in a sup
posedly democratic state (whether it is right or
wrong), one wonders how ihe peoples of Asia
will then see such actions, helped, of course, by
Communist propaganda. Obviously the govern

What? No plus points in the Bawlout? The
Stanford men have just been robbed most
accurate method for pro-rating a blind date (next
to looking up ihe girl's picture in the Quad). A
high number of plus points per quarter indicates
either a brilliant woman or a very hard-working
one, either of which makes a poor date; whereas
a low number of plus points per quarter, or pref
erably minus, indicates a girl who came to Stan
ford to have some fun and will make good or
excellent date material.
What are us poor men going to do now?

Recognition of Red China
Editor, The Daily:
Within the past week much space has been dc
voted in The Daily to the visit of 41 American
students to Red China. This is fortunate, in that
lho subject will be well aired, and frankly dis
cussed. But there are also indications that the
problem will be confused with the wisdom of
non-recognition of Red China, and of State De
partment policy. This is unfortunate. For while
there is a certain relationship, the question is
quite different from those problems:
1. There may well exist sharp and reasoned
differences of opinion over Red China and its
recognition, the need for information about the
country, and of present State Department policy
iby no means in itself monolithic in agreement).
Hut we live in a democratic country, and in such,
every government and its policy are subject to
choice, change and modification by its citizens in
an orderly and prescribed manner, including free
speech, petition, assembly and voting - . This in
deed is the substance of the appeal of the free
world over the totalitarian Communist system.
Such being the case, it stands to reason that this
is the way one should effect one's disagreement
with policy, not by blithely ignoring it, going
one's own sweet way; that is the surest way to
encourage political and governmental chaos.
Many federal and state laws and procedures ex
ist with which I disagree, but this hardly gives
me cause to go out of my way to break them.
Many recognized the prohibition amendment as
;in invasion of personal freedom, but this gave
no moral sanction to bootlegging and bathtub
gin.
2. If one grants such foreign policy in a sup
posedly democratic state (whether it is right or
wrong), one wonders how ihe peoples of Asia
will then see such actions, helped, of course, by
Communist propaganda. Obviously the govern
ment is left with the choice either of being
shown to follow weak and unpopular policies
which it dares not enforce, or else of punishing
"poor" errants in some fashion, making the gov
ernment look small and ridiculous. Either way
we lose prestige and position. And would not it
be pointed out that American democracy is a
failure (or a myth* when "widely unpopular"
;ui(l (therefore) imposed doctrines are quickly

violated by those students who have a chance?
Certainly the pictures of American students
chatting with Chou En-lai or dipping the Ameri
can flag before Khrushchev will be shown to in
dicate the "real" American opinion. Consider j
too. if one does believe our policy to be without
public support, the lost opportunity to show
American democracy in action as outlined above, |
while actions as shown by the students cast real
doubts on its strength and effectiveness.
3. While our government warned all students
to travel at their own risk to Red China, there
is little doubt that had the Iron Curtain dropped
while they were there, moral pressure alone
would have forced us to agitate for their return,
a position virtually unenforceable short of war.
This would have increased world tension, while
making America look even more impotent to the
neutrals of Asia. We would have suffered an
other psychological defeat, quite unnecessarily.
In short, no person, even an expert (which Mr.
Williamson admittedly is not), can fully judge
the effect and results of such a move, and short
of this the least injurious method of switching a
foreign policy is the democratic procedure
above, expertly advised and directed, which will
at least enable America to realize and partially
direct the consequences of any policy it may
undertake, to partly fashion its effect on the rest
of the world. Because of this, I think citizens
should condemn the action of the 41 American
students, regardless of their own personal opin
ions of the wisdom of our Far Eastern foreign
policy.
