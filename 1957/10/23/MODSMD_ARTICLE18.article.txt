A Legal Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's item on the law school forum about
the Little Rock crisis correctly reports that the
three participants upheld the President's use of
fedefiil troops. I would like to point out, however,
that it is somewhat misleading in stating that I
"upheld Faubus' right to choose between blood
shed . . . and enforcement of the federal court
order . . ."
Actually, I explained the legal arguments
Governor Faubus presented to the press and to'
the federal court to justify his ir.se of the Arkan
sas National Guard to keep the peace and prevent
the nine Negro students from attending Central
High School. At the same time, however, I point
ed out that his arguments are hy no means sup
ported by past Supreme Court rulings.
In fact, the decision of Chief Justice Hughes in
the most relevant case, Sterling v. Constantin (a
1932 decision concerning the right of the Texas
governor to call out troops to remove ihe danger
of disorder by preventing certain oil producers
from producing to full capacity), makes quite
clear that a governor of a state cannot use his
military power in order to prevent enjoyment of
a federal constitutional right. If his military
power is used in good faith and in the honest
belief that it is needed to head off violence, he
may indeed call out the National Guard. But he
must then use his troops to enforce the federal
court order—in this case, the order requiring ad
mission of the Negro students to the high school
not to prevent its enforcement.
Even though violence might reasonably have
been expected to result from enforcing the con
stitutional rights of the Negro children, Governor
Faubus is, and always has been, under a legal
duty to use his troops only to maintain the peace
while enforcing the federal court order requiring
integration.
Conceivably a governor might have discretion
to prevent. Negro students from entering a school
in the extraordinary and unlikely case that their
entry into the school, under a court decree, would
give rise to so widespread and uncontrollable vio
lence that even the National Guard could not
bring il under control.
Such action would immediately be subject to
review by the federal court, not only as to the
good faith of its exercise but also as to the rea
sonableness of the grounds for the governor's
belief. It would also raise the question whether
Ihe governor was not required to call for the aid
of federal troops under Article IV of the Consti
tution in the event that the court order requiring
integration was not revised.
In any event, it is clear that this was not the
situation in Arkansas, and that Faubus' argu
ment was only that he acted to prevent violence
and bloodshed. He did not, and does not, claim
that he could not control any anticipated violence
by using his troops to enforce the integration
decree. Thus he never did have a "right" to use
his troops for the opposite purpose.
The mere fact that the federal court extended
to Governor Faubus the courtesy of giving him a
day in court on Sept. 20 to justify his action be
fore issuing a decree directed specifically against
him and his military aides, instead of trying him
then for contempt of court for his obstruction of
its Aug. 28 integration decree, doesn't mean that
he had a "right" to act as he did between Sept. 2.
when he called out his troops, and Sept. 20, when
he called them off.
The White House statement on Oct. 2 of its
understanding of the legal issues involved in en
forcing court orders requiring integration in the
schools is accurate and reflects my own Mew:
"The governors of the respective states have
the primary responsibility for maintaining do
mestic order. However, under a pretext of main
taining order, a governor may not interpose mili
tary force or permit mob violence to occur so as
to prevent the final order of a federal court from
being carried out."

School of Law
International (.enter
Editor, The Daily:
At last the International Center, at Stanford
has come into being. I say "at last" because the
creation of the Center has been much awaited.
Up to now, what did the University have for those
who are here to make the University home for
their short, stay in the United States?
Stanford is no more a provincial university for
the sons and daughters of California. It is a
national as well as an international institution ut

high repute from'the vantage point of both repu
tation and substance.
Whether we realize it or not, now the Univer
sity has 300-some foreign students and scholars.
They have a big academic ambition, no doubt. It
does not have to be reminded, however, that what
the University offers academically alone does not
suffice to produce comfort and happiness in them,
psychologically and otherwise, and to further a
wholesome view of the University and the United
States.
Most of these foreign students and scholars, ,
particularly those who have just come to the j
United States, often find themselves lonesome,
far away from their home and from the surround
ings which they are so much used to. And I know
that they spend many days and nights after their
classes and work in frustration and fantasy, or
in watching merely the barren walls in the room
to the point of becoming obsessed by them. These
people wish to go out foi»A spree sometimes. But |
where in P.A., and how, without a four-wheeled !
automatic wagon? They need a feeling of belong- 112
ness or 1 togetherness, if you want to call it that.
They know too well, however, that they are'not
a part of the American civilization, no matter how
much Hiey adore it and how nice Americans are
toward them. And, under the present facilities of
the University for their accommodation, there is
indeed little to create the above sense of efficacy.
Many of the things happening on the campus
they do not know. Even if they have been long
enough at Stanford to know campus affairs, they
are socially too alien to stick their own necks out
and try. They want their friends—Jacks and
Jones —to accompany them for a trial. However,
their classroom acquaintances are too casual for
a favor.
What is the outcome of this? They seek their i
own nationals for companionship, behind the
hacks yf those who wanted otherwise for the |
eventual benefit of those 300-some foreign schol
ars and students to have the first-hand experience
of the United States above their many other in
tentions and ambitions.
I am not .advocating an international house at
Stanford. The University can have something bet- j
ter —maybe an international village on the cam
pus for both American and foreign students and
scholars, living together o na co-operative basis.
I should like to believe that, with the creation of
International Center, the University has made a
big step toward the realization of my dream for ;
an international village at Stanford.
Lastly, as a foreign student here, I am certain
that I share with others a sincere appreciation
of the foreign student adviser and the University
officials and students for their efforts and sacri
fices in connection with the creation of the
Center.

Typical Stanford 'Brain'
Editor, The Daily:
Griswold Nelson, in his sanctimonious discus
sion of the advisability of publishing the (J.P.A. j
(Grade Point Averages) in the Bawlout, reveals
the strange attitude so typical of the Stanford
"brain"—"Let's put the G.P.A. in the Bawlout so
we may see who is fit to associate with."
He is right in only one respect—the college stu
dent should be able to face up to his successes
and failures. However, his assumption that the
G.P.A. can be equated with true academic achieve
ment reeks of puerile pseudo-intellectualism.
Even the faculty freely admits that grades are
largely a matter of chance, the instructor and the
caliber of other students in the section. Perhaps
Mr. Nelson is one of those unfortunate persons
*■ who makes his friends on the basis of the G.P.A.;
as a sign of intellectual ability.

The Daily Errs
Editor, The Daily:
While reading Wednesday's Daily one article j
in particular caught by attention, an article by a
Miss Peterson on the Stanford Players' produc
tion, "Tiger at the Gates," but I am now curious
about the time the play will begin. The caption
beneath the cut pertaining to the article gave
me a clue about the dates on which the event will
occur.
Not to be choleric, I should like to object to
omitting the element "when" from articles writ
ten by budding journalists. I seem to recall
similar omissions in articles on the speech on
"Radiation and Man" and on the opera to be
presented Friday.
