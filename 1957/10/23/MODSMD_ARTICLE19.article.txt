# Hungarian Youth Revolution Marks First Anniversary
## 
### Roger Folsom 
BUDAPEST, one year ago
Rumors are rampant. The secu
rity police are nervous.
A crowd of university students
gathers outside a radio station,
requesting permission to broad
cast a list of student political
opinions. A detachment of police
fires on the students. The Hun
garian revolution of 1956 begins.
It spreads. Soon a whole people
is fighting, but it seems as if it
were mainly a battle of youth—
not only university youth but also
"kids" of 14 and 13 and younger.
The Russians taught them to
shoot in physical education pro
grams.
The Hungarians are learning
how to throw Molotov cocktails
(gasoline bombs I at tanks, and
how to fight guns with clubs. But
knowledge is not enough: bodies
litter the streets.
Army Hesitates
The Hungarian Army is hesi
tating to shoot Hungarians; it fi
nally refuses, and the Freedom
Fighters now have some weapons.
Some Russian soldiers, especial
ly those who have been stationed
in Hungary for a while, also hesi
tate to shoot. Some even join the
revolutionists.
The Hungarian Air Force, pilot
ing Russian planes, announces
that if the Russians do not leave
Budapest within 12 hours they
will start bombing.
Many Hungarians are dead, but
the Russians begin to leave. The
anti-Russian government of Imre
Nagy is negotiating with the Rus
sians for complete withdrawal of
all their troops. Nagy and his
delegations are kidnaped.
The Russian occupation forces
in pre-revolutionary Hungary had
consisted of about two divisions.
Now 19 divisions of Soviet troops
move in — fresh troops, new to
Hungary.
Little Infantry
There is little infantry, but the
Russians bring 5000 heavy tanks
with them. They do not shoot
with rifles at hidden Hungarian
snipers; they blow them up with
cannon fire and mow them down
with machine guns.
No one helps the Hungarians—
not with weapons or ammunition,
much less with troops. There is
grave danger of World War 111.
But somehow the resistance con
tinues.
Finally. Hungary's radio, an
nounces that the "counter-revolu
tionary" forces of the Freedom
Fighters have been crushed.
It is now a year later. The rev
olution did not bring freedom.
The revolution did bring: un
known hordes of dead; carloads
of humanity shipped to Siberia;
thousands of refugees still wait
ing, for something, in resettle
ment ca'mps; broken families; a
disrupted economy yielding a cold
and hungry winter.
A former Hungarian revolution
ist, Janos Lanyi. now a junior

studying chemistry at Stanford,
does not think the revolution was
fruitless. He will not say that it
was worth its cost; ho cannot say
that. He is not now dead in Si
beria, or in a refugee camp. He is
unable to really evaluate the cost.
All of the world that cares can
not now deny the brutality of
Communism. Before the revolu
tion it was not so obvious that
Russia, that Communism, wants
only to conquer and rule. Now it
cannot be doubted.
The Communists have learned.
Lanyi says, that they cannot suc
cessfully indoctrinate satellite
youth living under ;i Communist
system at least not in Hungary.
Before the revolution the gov
ernment never admitted that in a
university there could possibly be
non • Communists. Now students
are told, in effect, "Don't think
we just want you to obey." Before
the revolution Communists eared
what students thought.
Satellites Unreliable
The Russians have learned thai
satellite armies are not reliable,
and that even Russian soldiers
who have been exposed to some
thing other than Russian influ
ences are not always to be trusted.
On the other hand, the captives
in the satellites can no longer be
lieve that, if they revolt, the West
will help. The death of this hope
has aided Russian occupations.
Lanyi understands why the
West did not send either weapons
or troops; he does not blame us
at all. A world war is a terrible
thing.
But Lanyi does not understand
why we did not help where we
could. "The revolutionary Hun
garian government should not
have had to negotiate with the
Russians directly," he said; "the
United Nations should have been
there. Perhaps the Russians would
have kidnaped UN negotiators,
but probably th e y would have
not."
Perhaps if the West'had acted,
Hungary could be free to cele
brate this anniversary of its 195G
revolution.
Free Hungary?
It is dif if cult for Janos Lanyi
to say what form of government,
what economic system, the Hun
garians would adopt it' they were
free.
But some sort of a free state
would have been established, for
the Hungarians hate Communism
too much to become merely an
other "Titoist" variety of inde
pendent Communist state.
Before World War 11, Hungary
lived under a capitalistic economic
system. The people were oppress
ed. Lanyi cannot conceive of any
popularly supported Hungarian
government turning over large in
dustries which the Communist
stale now owns—to private capi
talists.

were mainly a battle of youth—
not only university youth but also
"kids" of 14 and 13 and younger.
The Russians taught them to
shoot in physical education pro
grams.
The Hungarians are learning
how to throw Molotov cocktails
(gasoline bombs I at tanks, and
how to fight guns with clubs. But
knowledge is not enough: bodies
litter the streets.
Army Hesitates
The Hungarian Army is hesi
tating to shoot Hungarians; it fi
nally refuses, and the Freedom
Fighters now have some weapons.
Some Russian soldiers, especial
ly those who have been stationed
in Hungary for a while, also hesi
tate to shoot. Some even join the
revolutionists.
The Hungarian Air Force, pilot
ing Russian planes, announces
that if the Russians do not leave
Budapest within 12 hours they
will start bombing.
Many Hungarians are dead, but
the Russians begin to leave. The
anti-Russian government of Imre
Nagy is negotiating with the Rus
sians for complete withdrawal of
all their troops. Nagy and his
delegations are kidnaped.
The Russian occupation forces
in pre-revolutionary Hungary had
consisted of about two divisions.
Now 19 divisions of Soviet troops
move in — fresh troops, new to
Hungary.
Little Infantry
There is little infantry, but the
Russians bring 5000 heavy tanks
with them. They do not shoot
with rifles at hidden Hungarian
snipers; they blow them up with
cannon fire and mow them down
with machine guns.
No one helps the Hungarians—
not with weapons or ammunition,
much less with troops. There is
grave danger of World War 111.
But somehow the resistance con
tinues.
Finally. Hungary's radio, an
nounces that the "counter-revolu
tionary" forces of the Freedom
Fighters have been crushed.
It is now a year later. The rev
olution did not bring freedom.
The revolution did bring: un
known hordes of dead; carloads
of humanity shipped to Siberia;
thousands of refugees still wait
ing, for something, in resettle
ment ca'mps; broken families; a
disrupted economy yielding a cold
and hungry winter.
A former Hungarian revolution
ist, Janos Lanyi. now a junior

studying chemistry at Stanford,
does not think the revolution was
fruitless. He will not say that it
was worth its cost; ho cannot say
that. He is not now dead in Si
beria, or in a refugee camp. He is
unable to really evaluate the cost.
All of the world that cares can
not now deny the brutality of
Communism. Before the revolu
tion it was not so obvious that
Russia, that Communism, wants
only to conquer and rule. Now it
cannot be doubted.
The Communists have learned.
Lanyi says, that they cannot suc
cessfully indoctrinate satellite
youth living under ;i Communist
system at least not in Hungary.
Before the revolution the gov
ernment never admitted that in a
university there could possibly be
non • Communists. Now students
are told, in effect, "Don't think
we just want you to obey." Before
the revolution Communists eared
what students thought.
Satellites Unreliable
The Russians have learned thai
satellite armies are not reliable,
and that even Russian soldiers
who have been exposed to some
thing other than Russian influ
ences are not always to be trusted.
On the other hand, the captives
in the satellites can no longer be
lieve that, if they revolt, the West
will help. The death of this hope
has aided Russian occupations.
Lanyi understands why the
West did not send either weapons
or troops; he does not blame us
at all. A world war is a terrible
thing.
But Lanyi does not understand
why we did not help where we
could. "The revolutionary Hun
garian government should not
have had to negotiate with the
Russians directly," he said; "the
United Nations should have been
there. Perhaps the Russians would
have kidnaped UN negotiators,
but probably th e y would have
not."
Perhaps if the West'had acted,
Hungary could be free to cele
brate this anniversary of its 195G
revolution.
Free Hungary?
It is dif if cult for Janos Lanyi
to say what form of government,
what economic system, the Hun
garians would adopt it' they were
free.
But some sort of a free state
would have been established, for
the Hungarians hate Communism
too much to become merely an
other "Titoist" variety of inde
pendent Communist state.
Before World War 11, Hungary
lived under a capitalistic economic
system. The people were oppress
ed. Lanyi cannot conceive of any
popularly supported Hungarian
government turning over large in
dustries which the Communist
stale now owns—to private capi
talists.
BUDAPEST, one year ago
Rumors are rampant. The secu
rity police are nervous.

The Hungarian Army is hesi
tating to shoot Hungarians; it fi
nally refuses, and the Freedom
Fighters now have some weapons.
Some Russian soldiers, especial
ly those who have been stationed
in Hungary for a while, also hesi
tate to shoot. Some even join the
revolutionists.
The Hungarian Air Force, pilot
ing Russian planes, announces
that if the Russians do not leave
Budapest within 12 hours they
will start bombing.
Many Hungarians are dead, but
the Russians begin to leave. The
anti-Russian government of Imre
Nagy is negotiating with the Rus
sians for complete withdrawal of
all their troops. Nagy and his
delegations are kidnaped.
The Russian occupation forces
in pre-revolutionary Hungary had
consisted of about two divisions.
Now 19 divisions of Soviet troops
move in — fresh troops, new to
Hungary.
Little Infantry
There is little infantry, but the
Russians bring 5000 heavy tanks
with them. They do not shoot
with rifles at hidden Hungarian
snipers; they blow them up with
cannon fire and mow them down
with machine guns.
No one helps the Hungarians—
not with weapons or ammunition,
much less with troops. There is
grave danger of World War 111.
But somehow the resistance con
tinues.
Finally. Hungary's radio, an
nounces that the "counter-revolu
tionary" forces of the Freedom
Fighters have been crushed.
It is now a year later. The rev
olution did not bring freedom.
The revolution did bring: un
known hordes of dead; carloads
of humanity shipped to Siberia;
thousands of refugees still wait
ing, for something, in resettle
ment ca'mps; broken families; a
disrupted economy yielding a cold
and hungry winter.
A former Hungarian revolution
ist, Janos Lanyi. now a junior

studying chemistry at Stanford,
does not think the revolution was
fruitless. He will not say that it
was worth its cost; ho cannot say
that. He is not now dead in Si
beria, or in a refugee camp. He is
unable to really evaluate the cost.
All of the world that cares can
not now deny the brutality of
Communism. Before the revolu
tion it was not so obvious that
Russia, that Communism, wants
only to conquer and rule. Now it
cannot be doubted.
The Communists have learned.
Lanyi says, that they cannot suc
cessfully indoctrinate satellite
youth living under ;i Communist
system at least not in Hungary.
Before the revolution the gov
ernment never admitted that in a
university there could possibly be
non • Communists. Now students
are told, in effect, "Don't think
we just want you to obey." Before
the revolution Communists eared
what students thought.
Satellites Unreliable
The Russians have learned thai
satellite armies are not reliable,
and that even Russian soldiers
who have been exposed to some
thing other than Russian influ
ences are not always to be trusted.
On the other hand, the captives
in the satellites can no longer be
lieve that, if they revolt, the West
will help. The death of this hope
has aided Russian occupations.
Lanyi understands why the
West did not send either weapons
or troops; he does not blame us
at all. A world war is a terrible
thing.
But Lanyi does not understand
why we did not help where we
could. "The revolutionary Hun
garian government should not
have had to negotiate with the
Russians directly," he said; "the
United Nations should have been
there. Perhaps the Russians would
have kidnaped UN negotiators,
but probably th e y would have
not."
Perhaps if the West'had acted,
Hungary could be free to cele
brate this anniversary of its 195G
revolution.
Free Hungary?
It is dif if cult for Janos Lanyi
to say what form of government,
what economic system, the Hun
garians would adopt it' they were
free.
But some sort of a free state
would have been established, for
the Hungarians hate Communism
too much to become merely an
other "Titoist" variety of inde
pendent Communist state.
Before World War 11, Hungary
lived under a capitalistic economic
system. The people were oppress
ed. Lanyi cannot conceive of any
popularly supported Hungarian
government turning over large in
dustries which the Communist
stale now owns—to private capi
talists.
BUDAPEST, one year ago
Rumors are rampant. The secu
rity police are nervous.
A crowd of university students
gathers outside a radio station,
requesting permission to broad
cast a list of student political
opinions. A detachment of police
fires on the students. The Hun
garian revolution of 1956 begins.
It spreads. Soon a whole people
is fighting, but it seems as if it
were mainly a battle of youth—
not only university youth but also
"kids" of 14 and 13 and younger.
The Russians taught them to
shoot in physical education pro
grams.
The Hungarians are learning
how to throw Molotov cocktails
(gasoline bombs I at tanks, and
how to fight guns with clubs. But
knowledge is not enough: bodies
litter the streets.
