pointment to the Stanford faculty.
He "retired" in 1946 and since that
time has published 10 books and
taught at five universities and
colleges, including Harvard, Bran
deis and the University of Hawaii.
Although Guerard originally
planned to spend only a year at
Brandeis, he was persuaded to
stay three years. He became the
recipient of the honorary Doctor
of Letters degree from that uni
versity. "I felt like the man who
came to dinner," said Guerard.
Universally Known
Despite the fact that he is uni
versally known for his writing as
philosopher, historian and author.
Dr. Guerard exhibits a wry atti
tude lovyard his literary achieve
ments.
His book "Bottle in the Sea"
was designed as a farewell when
it came out in 1954 This led to
"Testament of a Liberal," his
"farewell" book of 1956. "My
latest 'farewell' book," says Gue
rard, "comes out next month un
der the title of 'Fossils and Pres
ences.' "
In addition to his philosophical
works, Dr. Guerard is celebrated
for his "France: A Short His
tory" and for his works on Na
poleon 1 and Napoleon 111.
Although _ technically not a
member of their profession, Gue
rard has enjoyed the respect of
city planners for many years.
This acclaim was granted him for
the prophetical book he wrote on
Paris while he was serving with
army intelligence during World
War I.
Preserving Flavor
"My city planning book on Paris
has kept me in touch with city
planners all over the world," Gue
rard eommerft-s. "The problem of
how to make a city livable while
preserving its historical flavor is
ihe problem of every city in Eu
rope." Guerard sees an interest in
cities as only another aspect of
his life work studying people
and civilization.
Guerard studied at the Univer
sities of Paris and London and at
Geneva College in Pennsylvania.
He first taught at Williams Col
lege and then at Stanford from
1!M)7 to 1913. He became professor
of French at Rice Institute from
1913 to 1924; then he taught for a
year at University of California at
Los Angeles before returning to
Stanford.
Guerard has returned again to
Stanford from the universities
where he lectured since his re
lirement. This quarter he is teach
ing a seminar in humanities.
