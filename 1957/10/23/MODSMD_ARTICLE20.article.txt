# NO INTELLIGENCE NEEDED
## 'Is Wit Its Own Excuse?' Chappie Down To Par 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
The bellboys are back, for hu
mor purposes, lhat is. Perhaps
anteeedenl to the cross-coliseum
yells that usually develop in ath
letic contests with our Southern
California rivals.
Today they are spoofed on the
garish green cover of the Chapar
ral, that rank weed that is indige
nous to the Stanford campus.
"Welcome," the flag says, and
you notice the Old Boy got his
face in there, all right. The bot
tle in the band, that's him.
You might notice his presence
on the inside pages, too, in this
48-page "Welcome - back," "Cul
the-farm-tradition-politely" issue.
"Now that" asks for improve
ment suggestions, in a most gen
tle, we-care-for-you manner. Read
this first, before the rest of the
magazine convinces you that ram
pu.s opinion, hence your opinion,
is pretty worthless and other-di
rected, anyway.
For the uninitiated, or those
with enough good sense to laugh
at themselves, the Chappie has
rewritten the Stanford diction
ary. Items notably missing are
Hoo Tow, Sequoia and the Cen
ter of Quad. Chappie may be as
suming that its readers have
imaginations.
The yells and songs in the two
page Handbook cater to nothing,
not oven intelligence, in their ob
viousness. But then, can wit be
its own excuse?
The Hammer -and Coffin men
don't seem to think so. Most of
the feature material tries to hang
itself on an idea well expressed
in the titles of two of the arti
cles: "Plato's University" and
"The Care and Feeding of Your
Red-Hot." Assuming satire, of
course.
The Platonic dialogue shows a
bit of perception in places, indi
cating that the author may have
read Plato. It is a handsome ve
hide lor Ely diatribes against

things-in-general, ranging from
the philosopher himself (recog
nizable to Ihe better Civ stu
dents) through the usual trite
Daily, Honor Code and Social
Regulations cracks, to a near
sighted siam against the govern
ing bodies of the University, from
the lop administration down the
line.
"The Care and Feeding of Your
Red-Hot" is at) outright and oe
casionally subtle satire - attempt
on the "Com" type of personality
running rampant (the author
would have us believe) on col
lege campuses.
The campus â€¢ favorite comic
strip, which made such a hit in
the "Crash Comics" of last
spring, again appears, this time
tied to the theme of the issue. It
is rather well drawn and offers
a neat suggestion on Ihe current
uses of security blankets, or the
current security blankets in use,
whichever you prefer.
The rest of the art in the maga
zine produces a mixed effect. The
lit tie professors have come back,
along with several oilier of the
old and long-forgotten standbys.
But except for a few original and
remarkably clever cartoons, all
the better ones are borrowed.
"Moom Pitchers" retains its usu
al high standards, as does the sa
tiric photo feature. And the
queen, well . . . the queen.
But lastly, or leastly (depend
ing on your reasons for reading
the magazine), we must com
mend the Chappie on a most un
usual sense of discretion in
choosing jokes. Notably few of
them lack wit; none are repeat
ed; and there are a rare few to
which not even the most obscene
imagination could apply any off
color connotations.
For varying reasons we re
serve mental question marks
about pages 2X, 10 and 4H. A
thick magazine. any
way.
