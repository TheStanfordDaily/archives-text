# HEMLATA DEEN DAYAL
## India Foreign Scholar Describes Homeland 
### Steve Freidberg 
India is a country little known to the Western world, it has had
a magical attraction for traders, explorers and adventurers for hun
dreds of years, but it still holds mystery for foreign people.
India is a land of great extremes, of many people and of noble
religions. Today it has found its place in the world and is recognized

by the rest of the world as a
mighty nation.
For Ilemlata Deen Dayal a trip
to the United States had always
been her ambition—an ambition
which was finally realized this
year. She is now attending Stan
ford in the Foreign Scholar Pro
gram. under sponsorship of the
ASSU.
Hemlata is from Hyderabad, the
fifth largest city in India and the
capital of its state, and is living at
Florence Moore Hall during the
autumn quarter. She received the
A.13. degree at the Women's Col
lege of Osmania University, India,
and is doing graduate work here
in international relations to ob
tain the M.A. degree.
After returning to India she
hopes to join the diplomatic corps
and perhaps some day to return
to the United States. "I would
like to come to San Francisco if
I am in the diplomatic corps," she
said.
HriUsli Schools
As she has attended formerly-
British schools in India most of
her Jife, she speaks English flu
ently; in fact, she spoke English
several years before she learned
her native language, Hindi. She
also knows Urdu, the language of
Pakistan, and is learning French
here.
"I have always been fond of
traveling," Hemlata said. She has
been to Ceylon and Kashmir, and
in 1954 attended the Bandung Af
rican and Asian students' confer
ence in Indonesia as an observer.
This conference of 26 nations
was held to discuss strengthening
of relations between Asian and
African students, and Hemlata
had the distinction of being the
only woman representative from
India at the conference.
She is proficient in studies and
stood first in her class during the
four years of college. In 1952 she
passed Ihe senior Cambridge ex
amination, an extremely difficult
test which is made up and graded
in England.
School Activities
However, her studies have not
prevented her from taking pari
in school activities. In her second
year at college she was a repre
sentative in the student govern
ment and became secretary and
then president in the next two
years. ,
She enjoys music ("I don't care
for rock-and-roll, but I like West
ern classical music") and stamp
collecting, but her favorite hobby
is photography.
For two years she was a mem
ber of Ihe National Cadet Corps,
a training organization for both
men and women, and learned first
aid, map reading and rifle shoot
ing. She attained the rank of ser
geant major, second highest posi
tion in her troop.
Self-Discipline
Hemlata is a Hindu, as are
about 85 per cent, of the people of
India.
"Self discipline is one of the
main characteristics of the Hindu
religion," she said. "Another im
portant characteristic is non-vio
lence in thought, word and deed.
A Hindu must not think, speak or
do anything wrong or violent
against another person."
Because of her religion, Hem
lata is a vegetarian, but. she has
not run into any difficulties here.
"I manage with bread, salad, veg
etables and dessert; and some
times I fix my own food. I'm get
ting all my spices from India,"
she laughed. She said most 11 in
du:; are vegetarians.
Hemlata wears a caste mark on
her forehead. However, she said
this mark is used much as lipstick
is here- as a custom, not as an
indication of class distinction
and mostly Hindus use if. "There
are not castes as such," she com
mented. "There is little discrimi
nation against any caste, and it is
now a crime to discriminate
against untouchables."
Another custom that Hernial a

observes is the wearing of a small
diamond on a si do of her nose.
In regard to the current contest
between the United States and
Russia to gain India's favor, she
said, "India is not bothered much
about the ideologies of capitalism
and Communism. We follow no
rigid ideology but an independent
policy which meets Indian condi
tions.
"India wants to be friendly with
all countries,, but we do not like
pacts or alliances. Ours is not a
policy of neutrality, but it is a
policy of independence."

between the United States and
Russia to gain India's favor, she
said, "India is not bothered much
about the ideologies of capitalism
and Communism. We follow no
rigid ideology but an independent
policy which meets Indian condi
tions.
"India wants to be friendly with
all countries,, but we do not like
pacts or alliances. Ours is not a
policy of neutrality, but it is a
policy of independence."


HEMLATA DEEN DAYAL
"Independent India"
India is a country little known to the Western world, it has had
a magical attraction for traders, explorers and adventurers for hun
dreds of years, but it still holds mystery for foreign people.
India is a land of great extremes, of many people and of noble
religions. Today it has found its place in the world and is recognized

by the rest of the world as a
mighty nation.
For Ilemlata Deen Dayal a trip
to the United States had always
been her ambition—an ambition
which was finally realized this
year. She is now attending Stan
ford in the Foreign Scholar Pro
gram. under sponsorship of the
ASSU.
Hemlata is from Hyderabad, the
fifth largest city in India and the
capital of its state, and is living at
Florence Moore Hall during the
autumn quarter. She received the
A.13. degree at the Women's Col
lege of Osmania University, India,
and is doing graduate work here
in international relations to ob
tain the M.A. degree.
After returning to India she
hopes to join the diplomatic corps
and perhaps some day to return
to the United States. "I would
like to come to San Francisco if
I am in the diplomatic corps," she
said.
HriUsli Schools
As she has attended formerly-
British schools in India most of
her Jife, she speaks English flu
ently; in fact, she spoke English
several years before she learned
her native language, Hindi. She
also knows Urdu, the language of
Pakistan, and is learning French
here.
"I have always been fond of
traveling," Hemlata said. She has
been to Ceylon and Kashmir, and
in 1954 attended the Bandung Af
rican and Asian students' confer
ence in Indonesia as an observer.
This conference of 26 nations
was held to discuss strengthening
of relations between Asian and
African students, and Hemlata
had the distinction of being the
only woman representative from
India at the conference.
She is proficient in studies and
stood first in her class during the
four years of college. In 1952 she
passed Ihe senior Cambridge ex
amination, an extremely difficult
test which is made up and graded
in England.
School Activities
However, her studies have not
prevented her from taking pari
in school activities. In her second
year at college she was a repre
sentative in the student govern
ment and became secretary and
then president in the next two
years. ,
She enjoys music ("I don't care
for rock-and-roll, but I like West
ern classical music") and stamp
collecting, but her favorite hobby
is photography.
For two years she was a mem
ber of Ihe National Cadet Corps,
a training organization for both
men and women, and learned first
aid, map reading and rifle shoot
ing. She attained the rank of ser
geant major, second highest posi
tion in her troop.
Self-Discipline
Hemlata is a Hindu, as are
about 85 per cent, of the people of
India.
"Self discipline is one of the
main characteristics of the Hindu
religion," she said. "Another im
portant characteristic is non-vio
lence in thought, word and deed.
A Hindu must not think, speak or
do anything wrong or violent
against another person."
Because of her religion, Hem
lata is a vegetarian, but. she has
not run into any difficulties here.
"I manage with bread, salad, veg
etables and dessert; and some
times I fix my own food. I'm get
ting all my spices from India,"
she laughed. She said most 11 in
du:; are vegetarians.
Hemlata wears a caste mark on
her forehead. However, she said
this mark is used much as lipstick
is here- as a custom, not as an
indication of class distinction
and mostly Hindus use if. "There
are not castes as such," she com
mented. "There is little discrimi
nation against any caste, and it is
now a crime to discriminate
against untouchables."
Another custom that Hernial a

observes is the wearing of a small
diamond on a si do of her nose.
In regard to the current contest

Russia to gain India's favor, she

this mark is used much as lipstick
is here- as a custom, not as an
indication of class distinction
and mostly Hindus use if. "There
are not castes as such," she com
mented. "There is little discrimi
nation against any caste, and it is
now a crime to discriminate
against untouchables."
Another custom that Hernial a

observes is the wearing of a small
diamond on a si do of her nose.
In regard to the current contest
between the United States and
Russia to gain India's favor, she
said, "India is not bothered much
about the ideologies of capitalism
and Communism. We follow no
rigid ideology but an independent
policy which meets Indian condi
tions.
"India wants to be friendly with
all countries,, but we do not like
pacts or alliances. Ours is not a
policy of neutrality, but it is a
policy of independence."


HEMLATA DEEN DAYAL
"Independent India"
India is a country little known to the Western world, it has had
a magical attraction for traders, explorers and adventurers for hun
dreds of years, but it still holds mystery for foreign people.
India is a land of great extremes, of many people and of noble
religions. Today it has found its place in the world and is recognized

by the rest of the world as a
mighty nation.
For Ilemlata Deen Dayal a trip
to the United States had always
been her ambition—an ambition
which was finally realized this
year. She is now attending Stan
ford in the Foreign Scholar Pro
gram. under sponsorship of the
ASSU.
Hemlata is from Hyderabad, the
fifth largest city in India and the
capital of its state, and is living at
Florence Moore Hall during the
autumn quarter. She received the
A.13. degree at the Women's Col
lege of Osmania University, India,
and is doing graduate work here
in international relations to ob
tain the M.A. degree.
After returning to India she
hopes to join the diplomatic corps
and perhaps some day to return
to the United States. "I would
like to come to San Francisco if
I am in the diplomatic corps," she
said.
HriUsli Schools
As she has attended formerly-
British schools in India most of
her Jife, she speaks English flu
ently; in fact, she spoke English
several years before she learned
her native language, Hindi. She
also knows Urdu, the language of
Pakistan, and is learning French
here.
"I have always been fond of
traveling," Hemlata said. She has
been to Ceylon and Kashmir, and
in 1954 attended the Bandung Af
rican and Asian students' confer
ence in Indonesia as an observer.
This conference of 26 nations
was held to discuss strengthening
of relations between Asian and
African students, and Hemlata
had the distinction of being the
only woman representative from
India at the conference.
She is proficient in studies and
stood first in her class during the
four years of college. In 1952 she
passed Ihe senior Cambridge ex
amination, an extremely difficult
test which is made up and graded
in England.
School Activities
However, her studies have not
prevented her from taking pari
in school activities. In her second
year at college she was a repre
sentative in the student govern
ment and became secretary and
then president in the next two
years. ,
She enjoys music ("I don't care
for rock-and-roll, but I like West
ern classical music") and stamp
collecting, but her favorite hobby
is photography.
For two years she was a mem
ber of Ihe National Cadet Corps,
a training organization for both
men and women, and learned first
aid, map reading and rifle shoot
ing. She attained the rank of ser
geant major, second highest posi
tion in her troop.
Self-Discipline
Hemlata is a Hindu, as are
about 85 per cent, of the people of
India.
"Self discipline is one of the
main characteristics of the Hindu
religion," she said. "Another im
portant characteristic is non-vio
lence in thought, word and deed.
A Hindu must not think, speak or
do anything wrong or violent
against another person."
Because of her religion, Hem
lata is a vegetarian, but. she has
not run into any difficulties here.
"I manage with bread, salad, veg
etables and dessert; and some
times I fix my own food. I'm get
ting all my spices from India,"
she laughed. She said most 11 in
du:; are vegetarians.
