'Somebody has called this the atomic age. It's really
the petroleum age.
"In 1935 America used about 300 gallons of oil
products a year per person. 1 oday it's over 800
gallons. The industry has a big job to meet this
demand. But we're doing it.

"Costs arc up all along the line, but we re drilling
more wells than ever. In spite ol more dry holes,
our production is up. And out products are better
than they've ever been!'' ,

The problems George Veazey discusses are very
re;! I.
1 /(spite them, though, you never got more for
youi money than you do today at a. Union Oil
Service Station.
Today, gasoline is 1 5 octanes higher than it was
in 1939, and you get free services with every gallon.
Tii" price, on tin- other hand, has increased only
05% as compared with a 100% rise in the average
oi all consumer prices.
We intend to continue to bring our customers
the best possible products at the lowest possible
price.
