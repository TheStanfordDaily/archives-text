The Seattle Trip —Part I
Last weekend I had the distinct pleasure of traveling with the
Stanford Indians to Seattle for their game with Washington. And
believe me, it was a pleasure <1> because of the opportunity to travel
with the team and get to know the personnel better, and (2> because
we won.
No one can ever accuse Stanford of not traveling in style. Not
only did we go to Seattle on a first-class charter flight, but we flew
on a DC-7 that had been in service for only three days.
The plane- newest in United Airlines' fleet—had logged only 50
hours of flying time. The quick trip to Seattle put only another 2'■>
hours on its log as we left San Francisco at 11 a.m. Friday and ar
rived at Seattle-Tacoma Airport at 1:30 p.m.
But let's go back and fill in a few details of the flight.
The team and associated personnel who traveled to Seattle began
1o assemble at training quarters as early as 9 a.m. By 9:30. gear was
loaded on a pair of waiting Greyhounds, people were loaded on, and
we were off for International Airport.
Wo had a wait of about 45 minutes at the airport, so everyone
wandered here and there. 'Bob Peterson, the boldest Romeo of the
Jot, managed to strike up a conversation with several girl travelers.
Funny thing—it didn't take long for about a.fourth of the team to
migrate to Peterson and his "friend."
Stewardesses Bridges and Walsh welcomed us aboard "Flight
5643, the Stanford University Football Charter," at 10:45.
We weren't in the air but a few minutes when the two ladies
began to serve lunch a. lunch that was more like a dinner to me.
The menu, printed especially for the flight and complete with a
eartoon of a mean-looking Brave, read like this:
FRESH MELON COCKTAIL
GRILLED FILET MIGNON, COLBERT
RISSOLE POTATO
BUTTERED PEAS
RYE ROLL
SALAD ROSSINI
BASIL FRENCH DRESSING
WHIPPED CREAM PUFF
Howard Miller, the flight captain and Stanford's regular pilot for
Ihe 1957 season, gave us a few special sightseeing looks on Ihe trip
north. Most picturesque were Shasta Dam, Mt. Lassen and Mt.
Shasta. Mt. Shasta was particularly interesting as we flew wilhin
what seemed to be just a few hundred feet of the top, although we
v/erp actually about a quarter of a mile away.
Intramural director Elwyn Bugge, on a road 1 rip for the firsi
1 irue this year, got a special kick out of passing over the many moun
tains of Washington. Why the special kick? He had climbed most
of them when he used to live in Washington.
Entry Through the Back Way
We didn't exactly get a big reception when we landed. As a
matter of fact, we landed at the "back door" of the airport and were
whisker! to two more Greyhounds which were parked by a delivery
enlranee of some sort.
The team was quickly taken to Husky Stadium for a workout,
while the rest of the party, excluding coaches and myself, went di
rectly to the Olympic Hotel.
1 got my first look at the University of Washington as I tried to
locate the offices of the Washington Daily. I wandered first from
the locker room area to a pedestrian overpass and thence up a wide
dirt path to some railroad tracks.
There were plenty of students along this route, and I was ban
ning to wonder just what kind of a school this was. After crossing
ihe tracks and passing some old beat-up sheds, I found myself face
1o face with a whole flock of brand-new and very beautiful buildings
- the real U. of W.
If anyone ever brags to you about the facilities at Washington,
don't bother to argue with him, because he's right. For the most
part, it's a very modern institution, and seems to have most every
llnng. Ihe site, the shores of Lake Washington, is very impressive,
' One thing about Washington, though—the students don't seem to
know where anything is. I asked six people where the Communica
tions Building was. The boxscore on replies—four didn't know, one
sent me in cxactly, the opposite direction and the sixth finally set
me straight. Well, I finally found the place, talked to photographer
Ron Lopp about taking pictures for The Daily, and so that's how
come Monday's Daily had game pictures in it.
After my searching and the team's brief unlimbering workout,
we all returned to the Olympic for a couple of hours of relaxation
before dinner. And this seems like a good place to break this narra
tive until tomorrow, when we'll talk about dinner at the Olympic,
a nasty breakfast rumor, beating the Huskies and a triumphant
flight home.
