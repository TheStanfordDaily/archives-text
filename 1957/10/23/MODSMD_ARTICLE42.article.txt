# SCOUTING REPORT SAYS:
## Bruins Rated Fine Passing Team 
### 
Stanford's Indians are at work
I this week preparing for the inva
: sion of Red Sanders and his smog
-1 land Bruins on Saturday.
On Monday ihe team viewed!
pictures of the UCLA-Oregon
; game, in which the Blue and Gold
I were set back 21-0, their only loss
this year. Dutch Fehring and Pete
| Kmetovic, assistant coaches who 1
[scouted the southlanders, also re-!
! ported to the squad.
"They're a fine passing team !
; with excellent receivers, and they
t have a quick, agile line," was the j
| way coach Chuck Taylor summar- ;
ized the scouting reports. "These;
fact s will dictate our practice
plans."
Performance - wise, the Bruins
are sending a much better team

to Palo Alto than had been pre
dicted at the beginning of the
season. The UCLA 4-1 record in
cludes a predicted trouncing of
the Air Force Academy, 47-0; a
surprising upset over Illinois. 16-
6; their loss to Oregon, 21-0; and
last week's eye-opening romp over
Oregon State, 26-7.
Margin Surprises
What surprised the experts in
last week's game was not only the
Bruin win but the 19-point margin
with which they did it.
Sanders, in his ninth year at the
southland institution, may be
coaching the physically smallest
team he has ever had, but the
Bruins are not without talent.
Take tailback Kirk Wilson, for
instance. The 207-pounder set the
NCAA, PCC and UCLA punting
records in '56, totaling 1479 yards
in 30 boots for a 49.3 average. He
got off to a slow start this year,
but last week averaged 53.4 yards
in four kicks to take over second
place in this PCC category.
Besides his kicking ability, Wil
son is also the top ground gainer
on the UCLA squad. Through the

Washington game Wilson had a
5.25 average. Tailback Don. Long,
marked by the scouts as a stand
out, trails Wilson with a 4.18 av
erage in 33 carries.
Kendall Leads
UCLA's tailback Chuck Kendall
is the squad's leader in total of
fense,' His total of 320 yards
I (through the Washington gamei
included 122 grounders and 198 in
the air. Kendall doubles as the
team's leading passer, having
completed 13 out of 19 passes for
j .685.
Sanders' squad, on the whole,
has out rushed opponents, 723 to
644 yards; outpassed them, 35 of
155, to 31 of 68; outscored them.
82 to 27; outpunted them, 915 to
731 yards; and outreturned them
on punts' 10.81 yards to 8.68.
End Dick Wallen provides the
i greatest threat in the pass-receiv
: ing department, having caught
ill aerials for 135 yards and a
touchdown.
Dawson didn't start against the
! Academy because of an injured
! shoulder. His first game was the
1 Illinois contest, but he hurt the

same shoulder again in that one j
and sat out Washington State. He
should be back in action, ready to
start and go at full steam, on*
Saturday.
Stanford will, of course, be mi-!
nus the services of Lou Valli. who
turned in his uniform yesterday.!
This moves Chuck Shea up into
the No. 1 spot at fullback.
Shea to Have Help
But Shea will have help in the
backfield in an unusual manner.
Chuck Taylor earlier this week
announced plans to shake up his
backfield, but was noncommittal
yesterday as to just'how he'd
do it.
The Taylormen went through
defensive emphasis in their drill
yesterday, as Taylor feels this is
the major factor pf difference in j
playing against a single-wing at-1
lack such as the one used by the!
Bruins.
Stanford's Cardinals are look-!
ing forward to tihs week end with
an unusual amount of spirit. For
some reason, the local boys take
a great deal of pleasure in clean
ing up smog conditions.

Performance - wise, the Bruins
are sending a much better team

to Palo Alto than had been pre
dicted at the beginning of the
season. The UCLA 4-1 record in
cludes a predicted trouncing of
the Air Force Academy, 47-0; a
surprising upset over Illinois. 16-
6; their loss to Oregon, 21-0; and
last week's eye-opening romp over
Oregon State, 26-7.
Margin Surprises
What surprised the experts in
last week's game was not only the
Bruin win but the 19-point margin
with which they did it.
Sanders, in his ninth year at the
southland institution, may be
coaching the physically smallest
team he has ever had, but the
Bruins are not without talent.
Take tailback Kirk Wilson, for
instance. The 207-pounder set the
NCAA, PCC and UCLA punting
records in '56, totaling 1479 yards
in 30 boots for a 49.3 average. He
got off to a slow start this year,
but last week averaged 53.4 yards
in four kicks to take over second
place in this PCC category.
Besides his kicking ability, Wil
son is also the top ground gainer
on the UCLA squad. Through the

Washington game Wilson had a
5.25 average. Tailback Don. Long,
marked by the scouts as a stand
out, trails Wilson with a 4.18 av
erage in 33 carries.
Kendall Leads
UCLA's tailback Chuck Kendall
is the squad's leader in total of
fense,' His total of 320 yards
I (through the Washington gamei
included 122 grounders and 198 in
the air. Kendall doubles as the
team's leading passer, having
completed 13 out of 19 passes for
j .685.
Sanders' squad, on the whole,
has out rushed opponents, 723 to
644 yards; outpassed them, 35 of
155, to 31 of 68; outscored them.
82 to 27; outpunted them, 915 to
731 yards; and outreturned them
on punts' 10.81 yards to 8.68.
End Dick Wallen provides the
i greatest threat in the pass-receiv
: ing department, having caught
ill aerials for 135 yards and a
touchdown.
Dawson didn't start against the
! Academy because of an injured
! shoulder. His first game was the
1 Illinois contest, but he hurt the

same shoulder again in that one j
and sat out Washington State. He
should be back in action, ready to
start and go at full steam, on*
Saturday.
Stanford will, of course, be mi-!
nus the services of Lou Valli. who
turned in his uniform yesterday.!
This moves Chuck Shea up into
the No. 1 spot at fullback.
Shea to Have Help
But Shea will have help in the
backfield in an unusual manner.
Chuck Taylor earlier this week
announced plans to shake up his
backfield, but was noncommittal
yesterday as to just'how he'd
do it.
The Taylormen went through
defensive emphasis in their drill
yesterday, as Taylor feels this is
the major factor pf difference in j
playing against a single-wing at-1
lack such as the one used by the!
Bruins.
Stanford's Cardinals are look-!
ing forward to tihs week end with
an unusual amount of spirit. For
some reason, the local boys take
a great deal of pleasure in clean
ing up smog conditions.

Bruins are not without talent.
Take tailback Kirk Wilson, for
instance. The 207-pounder set the
NCAA, PCC and UCLA punting
records in '56, totaling 1479 yards
in 30 boots for a 49.3 average. He
got off to a slow start this year,
but last week averaged 53.4 yards
in four kicks to take over second
place in this PCC category.
Besides his kicking ability, Wil
son is also the top ground gainer
on the UCLA squad. Through the

Washington game Wilson had a
5.25 average. Tailback Don. Long,
marked by the scouts as a stand
out, trails Wilson with a 4.18 av
erage in 33 carries.
Kendall Leads
UCLA's tailback Chuck Kendall
is the squad's leader in total of
fense,' His total of 320 yards
I (through the Washington gamei
included 122 grounders and 198 in
the air. Kendall doubles as the
team's leading passer, having
completed 13 out of 19 passes for
j .685.
Sanders' squad, on the whole,
has out rushed opponents, 723 to
644 yards; outpassed them, 35 of
155, to 31 of 68; outscored them.
82 to 27; outpunted them, 915 to
731 yards; and outreturned them
on punts' 10.81 yards to 8.68.
End Dick Wallen provides the
i greatest threat in the pass-receiv
: ing department, having caught
ill aerials for 135 yards and a
touchdown.
Dawson didn't start against the
! Academy because of an injured
! shoulder. His first game was the
1 Illinois contest, but he hurt the

same shoulder again in that one j
and sat out Washington State. He
should be back in action, ready to
start and go at full steam, on*
Saturday.
Stanford will, of course, be mi-!
nus the services of Lou Valli. who
turned in his uniform yesterday.!
This moves Chuck Shea up into
the No. 1 spot at fullback.
Shea to Have Help
But Shea will have help in the
backfield in an unusual manner.
Chuck Taylor earlier this week
announced plans to shake up his
backfield, but was noncommittal
yesterday as to just'how he'd
do it.
The Taylormen went through
defensive emphasis in their drill
yesterday, as Taylor feels this is
the major factor pf difference in j
playing against a single-wing at-1
lack such as the one used by the!
Bruins.
Stanford's Cardinals are look-!
ing forward to tihs week end with
an unusual amount of spirit. For
some reason, the local boys take
a great deal of pleasure in clean
ing up smog conditions.
Stanford's Indians are at work
I this week preparing for the inva
: sion of Red Sanders and his smog
-1 land Bruins on Saturday.
On Monday ihe team viewed!
pictures of the UCLA-Oregon
; game, in which the Blue and Gold
I were set back 21-0, their only loss
this year. Dutch Fehring and Pete
| Kmetovic, assistant coaches who 1
[scouted the southlanders, also re-!
! ported to the squad.
"They're a fine passing team !
; with excellent receivers, and they
t have a quick, agile line," was the j
| way coach Chuck Taylor summar- ;
ized the scouting reports. "These;
fact s will dictate our practice
plans."
Performance - wise, the Bruins
are sending a much better team

to Palo Alto than had been pre
dicted at the beginning of the
season. The UCLA 4-1 record in
cludes a predicted trouncing of
the Air Force Academy, 47-0; a
surprising upset over Illinois. 16-
6; their loss to Oregon, 21-0; and
last week's eye-opening romp over
Oregon State, 26-7.
Margin Surprises
What surprised the experts in
last week's game was not only the
Bruin win but the 19-point margin
with which they did it.
Sanders, in his ninth year at the
southland institution, may be
coaching the physically smallest
team he has ever had, but the
Bruins are not without talent.
