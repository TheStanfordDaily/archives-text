# TIBETAN WITCHCRAFT
## Stanford Professor Donates Ghost-Trap to N.J. Museum 
### 
Professor Frederic Spiegelberg has presented New Jersey's New
ark Museum with its first Tibetan ghost-trap.
Spiegelberg, specialist in Indian civilization, discovered the rain
bow-colored ghost-traps while pn a pack trip through the Sikkimese
Himalayas in 1955.
The trap is the so-called "Yam-moos," a magic device believed by

the Tibetans to be effective
against infectious disease and
epidemics of all kinds when
perched on the owner's housetop.
It is a thrce-foothigh contrap
tion of wooden masts and struts
strung with hundreds of yards of
multi-colored yarn in geometrical
webs. Surrounding the main
structure are seven smaller trian
gular webs and seven wooden
slabs with graphic designs of
