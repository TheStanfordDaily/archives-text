# Malpractice Suit Reversed
## 
### S.F. Court 
SAN FRANCISCO (JP) â€” The
State District Court of Appeals
yesterday reversed a $213,355
malpractice verdict against the
Stanford University Hospital and
Dr. Frank Gerbode, staff heart
specialist and surgeon.
A San Francisco Superior
Court jdry . originally awarded
$250,000 damages to Martin Sal
go, who suffered paralysis of his
lower body following a chemical
X-ray examination of the heart.
Superior Judge Edward Mol
kenbuhr reduced the jury award
to $213,355. Salgo died July 19,
1957, after -the appeal was sub
mitted by the hospital and Dr.
Gerbode.
Salgo's widow, Olga, survives.
Judge A. F. Bray, writing the
reversal opinion, said the doc
trine on- which Salgo's claim of
damages for negligence relied,
could not apply.
The doctrine holds that where
obvious injury results the de
fense carries the burden of prov
ing innocence of negligence.
"The doctrine is applicable only
where it is a matter of common
knowledge among laymen .or
medical men or both that the in
jury would, not have resulted
without negligence," Judge Bray
wrote.
The judge pointed out the pro
cedure is new and not common
knowledge among medical men
and certainly not among laymen.
The reversal opinion declared a
prejudicial error when Judge
Molkenbuhr instructed the ju
rors, "As a matter, of law, estab
lished by the evidence, inference
of negligence arose."
