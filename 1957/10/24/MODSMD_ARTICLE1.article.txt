# UCLA Pre-Game Rally To Spark Spirit Friday
## 'Around the World' to Be Theme For Card Stunts, Band Show 
### 
UCLA game rally will be held Friday night at 7 in front of the
Post Office. The rally will be held immediately preceding the Row
Carnival.
Featured at the rally will be the pompon girls, the cheer leaders,
h representative of the team and music by the Stanford Band.

The card stunts devised for this
Saturday could be the most spec
tacular ever performed by Stan
ford. The section will be 50 rows
high and 80 seats wide, in con
trast with the normal 50 by 40
section, or last year's 40 by 70
CinemaScope section. The pro
posed 4000-member section will
include both the regular men's
section and the women's.
Half-Time
Ten stunts will be performed
during half-time, following the
general theme of "Around the
World," which is also being used
as theme by the band during its
half-time activities. The card
stunts will conclude with the tra
ditional expanding "S," enlarged
for this game to fill the new sec
tion.
UCLA is noted for the excel
lence of its card stunts, and Rally
Commission has put in many
hours in making these stunts ex
ceptionally outstanding. In order
for the stunts to be executed suc
cessfully, Rally Com must have
the full co-operation of the stu
dents performing them.
These points are emphasized
by Rally Com: Co-operation is
requested, for these stunts are
not put on for the private enjoy
ment of Rally Com, but belong to
the student body as a whole.
When they are performed badly
they reflect on everyone.
Stunt Directions
Please listen to the directions
given. Follow the instructions on
the instruction card â€” they are
simple. Hold the cards at eye
level, top of card even with bot
tom of nose, not at arm's length
and six feet in the air.
Come up with the card precise
ly when the director says ABC
"Up!" Do not throw the cards,
either after the stunts or while
they are in progress. The cards
could injure someone.
Wear white shirts only in the
rooting section.
