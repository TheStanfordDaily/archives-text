# Rocket Fired 4000 Miles Above Earth
## U.S. Project Collects High Altitude Data, Says L.A. Examiner 
### 
LOS ANGELES (>P) — The Air
Force has successfully fired a
rocket nearly 4000 miles above
the earth, the Los Angeles Exam
ther reported yesterday.
The four-stage rocket was sent
aloft from a balloon at an alti
tude of 100,000 feet over Eniwe
tok Island in the Pacific Ocean,
the story said.
The high altitude research
project is known as Project Far
Side. That the firing was pend
ing was well known, but there
has been no official announce
ment of any firing.
Examiner Story
A story by Examiner Science
Editor Christian Clausen said the
paper learned of the firing from
scientists who returned with a
mass of data collected during the
firing.
The rocket went thousands of
miles higher than Russia's Sput
nik earth satellite, which has
reached a maximum distance
from the earth of only 560 miles,
the story said.
Further Details
The story added:
Unlike Sputnik, the Far Side
rocket was not designed to orbit
around the earth. Its goal was to
reach the maximum possible alti
tude, and then make the long
drop back to earth while its in
struments radioed back informa
tion on conditions at extreme al
titudes—such as data on cosmic
rays and magnetic fields.
The instrument package was a
3Mi-pound collection of counters
and sensitive indicators located
in a six by four-inch container in
the nose cone of the fourth-stage
rocket.
Test Successful
The test was successful in that
it collected information which it
is hoped will confirm calcula
tions about conditions at various
altitudes.
Here are some of the an
nounced details of the project:
The Far Side rocket was de
veloped by the Ford Motor Com
pany's subsidiary Aeroneutronic
Systems Inc. It was expected to
travel 17,000 mph to a height nev
er before achieved.
The largest balloon ever
launched was created to hoist the
1900-pound rocket to 100,000 feet.
Then the rocket, inserted into the
lower end of the balloon trans
port, was to blast straight up
ward through the balloon under
the blast of a 160,000 pound
thrust.
The first-stage rocket is a clus
ter of four recruit rocket engines.
The second stage is a single re
cruit rocket engine. The third
stage is four Arrow II rockets
and the fourth a single Arrow 11.
The mechanical division of
General Mills designed the bal
loon, which soared to more than
100,000 feet in tests in Minne
sota.
