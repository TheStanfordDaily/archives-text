# "Around the World" with Row
## Women's Houses Sponsor Carnival 
### 
"Around the World in 80 Min
utes" is the theme of the annual
Women's Row Carnival, to be held
tomorrow evening following the
UCLA Rally. Booths and activi
ties will be all along the Lower
Row between the Beta and Phi
Delt houses.
Notable personalities are com
ing to participate in the carnival
using all the means of transpor
tation in the .lules Verne novel
and movie—balloon, ship, train,
elephant.
Features of the carnival include
skill booths, restaurants and food
shops, and fortunetelling. Many
valuable items and gift certifi
cates will be sold at an auction at
8:30 at the Beta house.
A special event will be a street
dance to the Dixieland music of
Lou Terman's band. This will be
held between the Beta house and
Manzanita from 7:45 to 11 p.m.
General chairmen of the carni
val are Nyna Miilu of Durand and
Bev Odgen of Hurlburt. "The Row
Carnival is always one of the fall
quarter's most outstanding
events," says Nyna. "This year
will be no exception! Everyone
always has a wonderful time!"
Each of the eight Women's Row
houses - Durand, Guthrie, Ilurl
burt, Jordan, Lathrop, Roth, Still
man and Storey—is in charge of
one or two booths.
Proceeds from the carnival go
to the Women's Row Scholarship
Fund, whi c h assists Stanford
women.
