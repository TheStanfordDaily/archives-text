# Why the United Nations?

### 
Wit at does the United Nations mean to yon?
Js i 1 just a hunch of "radicals" who discuss
■"nonsense""? Or is it an organization whose
existence assures that yon will he able to attend
Stanford next quarter, that you will eat a good
dinner tonight, that you won't be mowed down
by a rampaging army?
That is for you lo decide. On this United
Nations Day we shall review some of the rea
sons for the existence of the UN. Let us first
note that we are no worse off than if no UN
existed; in fact, we're much better off.
In the days before technology united the
world into one system, it was possible for
groups of people (nations) to live separately.
If a couple of states got into a war, it didn't
affect anyone else. Today, however, we are so
interconnected economically and in many other
ways that a rumbling in the Middle East which
no one would have noticed a century ago affects
the survival of all of 11s.
The UN is not new. Tn reality, it is the
League of Nations under a new name; the
League, in turn, was a combination of ideas
and practices dating hack as early as ancient
Crecce. The UN is not a super-state, a con
federation, or a commonwealth. Rather it is a
method of reaching world-wide agreement that
looks toward removing causes of war and other
miseries.
Great strides for keeping the peace —and
thus the chance for individuals to reap the
greatest amount of happiness—were made fol
lowing the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th
century. Gradually there evolved the Concert
of Europe, a system of periodic conferences on
the part ol the major powers to keep the peace.
The concert euro pern was only a safety valve,
however.
| Another development was the public inter
national unions, such as the Universal Postal
I nion—which makes it possible for you to
mail letters at moderate rates to other coun
tries. Here we developed permanent interna
tional machinery. The nations came together
and signed a multilateral treaty setting up the
1 nion; periodic conferences were then held
to make any needed changes.
t Public international unions, though, were
unrelated and did not deal with vital problems
— problems for which nations or, more correct
ly. their leaders would go to war.
As the 20th century dawned, two contrary
ide as could be noted. One was that civilized
people didn't have wars any more. The last
Knropcan war had been the Franco-Prussian of
1870. and that was a generation before. People
bad outgrown wars.
| But, at the same time, many people illogi
eally thought wars had a positive good. "Wars
bring out the best in people, make them un
selfish," etc., was the way some reasoned. Many

thought only of the glorv of military accom
plishments.
Then one of our most needless, senseless
tragedies—World War I—struck. Every aspect
of human life was affected by that holocaust.
Besides the tangible losses ( lives, money, prop
erty), there were those Josses that can't be
counted — children left with no parents, for
example.
The Concert of Europe, with its rights but
110 responsibilities, had proved inadequate. So
the statesmen of 1919-20 tried to cure the ear
lier defects.
Into The League they incorporated the con
ference system of the Concert, but meetings
would be regularly scheduled rather than spo
radic. As the U.S. Congress is a compromise
between the small and large states, so the
League's Assembly catered to all nations, while
the Council represented the major powers,
agreement of whom was necessary before prog
ress was made. The international secretariat
handled routine secretarial work.
In the League there was the machinery for
international cooperation, but, as we saw, the
members were not willing to use it. So came
World War 11. After the flames died down, a
second attempt at general international cooper
ation —the I nited Nations—was made.
Certain minor changes were made, but in
essence the UN carries on in League fashion.
A few names were changed: the Assembly be
came the General Assembly, the Permanent
Court of International Justice became the In
ternational Court of Justice, and the Council
was divided into the Security, Trusteeship and
Economic-Social councils.
The I \ is like a tree that grows and de
velops. It is rooted in history and has a sound
growth in government. It takes lime, conti
nuity and suitable conditions. If the peace is
kept long enough, a spiritual atmosphere for
insuring that peace will emerge from it.
Today, in spite of Sputnik, the preponder
ance of power lies on the side of those who
would have the system of international cooper
ation work, flic United States, a major power,
did not belong to the League.
With a majority of non-democratic nations
in the world today, it would be folk to turn
the I "\ into a world federal government; by
the democratic procedures, the democracies
would be outvoted immediately.
Until the time is ripe for a world govern
ment, the United Nations is our best answer.
Right now it is our only bridge on which the
United States and other democratic nations can
meet with Russia and other Communist nations.
Although peaceful existence many times seems
on shaky ground, we still have peace.
Let us nurture that peace we have now so
that it will pave the way for further advances
for mankind.
