# EXEC PROGRAM
## 18 Men Will Prepare for Management 
### 
At Stanford University next
! January a group of 18 men will
commence an intensive, eight
month training program aimed
at developing top â€¢ drawer busi
ness executives and educators.
The men will be 30- to 35-year-old
college graduates of demonstrat
| ed business and academic ability.
The experimental "Program in
, Executive Management" will be
given by the Stanford Graduate
School of Business. It has been
underwritten by a grant from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Inc.
Professor Carlton A. Pederson,
acting dean of the Business
School, said the program is de
signed to help meet two basic
needs. "Continuous progress of
our society depends to a great
extent," he said, "upon our abil
ity to utilize the full potential of
| the relatively small number of
! exceptionally able young busi-
I ness executives who show prom
| ise for future growth.
"Equally important is the need
to provide a continuous flow of
top-level educators to provide Ihe
appropriate climate for profes
sional business education, within
our universities and within busi
-1 ness itself."
Of Stanford's 18 Business Ex
ecutive Fellows, 12 will be young
executives selected from differ
ent industries and areas of the
! nation who have been given tui
j tion - and - salary - paid leaves by
I their companies. The other six
! will be outstanding graduate stu
j dents studying for the Ph.D. De
i gree,
Creative thinking and active
participation will be required of
i the 18 men throughout the eight
months, including seminars on
management problems, team
projects for their solution, and a
major research project to be con
ducted by all 18 men.
Field trips will enable Business
Fellows to observe current busi
ness practices and contact indus
trial leaders across the nation.
The Business School faculty
for the program will be aug
mented by specialists from other
Stanford departments, from oth
er universities and from top man
agement in industry.
