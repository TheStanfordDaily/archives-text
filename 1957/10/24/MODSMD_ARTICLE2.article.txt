MONTECATINI, Italy (/P) —
Christian Dior, for years the big:
gest name in fashion design, died
here early yesterday of a heart
seizure. He had been holidaying
for the past week in northern
Italy.
His greatest coup was the "New
Look" in 1947, when he seized and
held for France the style leader
ship of the world, after it had
threatened to pass to the United
States in the post-war years.
The French government recog
nized in him a national asset and
awarded him the Legion of
Honor.
After he let skirts down (the
New Look of 1947), hiked them
up (1953► and de-emphasized the
bosom (1954), stylists suspected
he could do anything with fash
ions.
Because his business sense
matched his creative genius, Dior
made fashions pay off handsome
ly. His business crested $17 mil
lion in 1953.
Although Dior ruled the fashion
world for a decade, he had an up
and-down career until the "New
Look" launched him with a splash
in the 1947 season.
His own precept was "to make
elegant women more beautiful; to
make beautiful women more ele
gant."
