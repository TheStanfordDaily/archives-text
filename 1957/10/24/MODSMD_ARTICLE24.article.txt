# The 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
The Seattle Trip—Pari II
We broke off yesterday's column for a two-hour rest at the Olym
pic Hotel in Seattle, where the Stanford footballers were awaiting
ihe next day's game with Washington.
At 6 p.m. sharp, we all went into a private dining room at the
Olympic and were greeted with pieces of eight er, I mean, eighi
pieces of-—eight pieces of silverware, that is.
Nothing caused more comment at ttie dinner table than the three
forks, three spoons and two knives that confronted the 37 hungry
football players. But it didn't take anybody very long to wade
through the pile of silver into the chicken dinner that was served.
Shortly after dinner, Chief Lightfoot arrived on ihe scene. It
seems that the Chief was misinformed about the time of departure
from San Francisco, wilh the result that he arrived 20 minutes after
the plane had left.
Not one to give up easily, the Chief scurried to the reservations
counter and purchased a ticket on a 2 p.m. flight to Seattle. All
wont well from then on for Lightfoot.
While Chuck Taylor buzzed back and forth between television
appearances and alumni gatherings during Friday evening, most;
ol the players either watched television or took in an early flick.
One man who did get in his exercise that night was Bob Roberts,
the Stanford assistant yell leader who made the trip to Seattle.
Bob was a feature attraction at a party for Stanford alums from
Ihe Northwest. It wasn't long before they had him leading yells, and
it seems that they responded with lots oi enthusiasm. They weren't
satisfied with the current Indian yells, either, and had Bob leading
ones that were popular years ago, hut have since died out. There
v\as just one tiling they couldn't get Bob to do, however he would
n't let the alums "Give 'Em the Axe."
Stanford football players go to bed early and sleep lale when
Uiey're on the road, and the past weekend was no exception. They
started to wander around the hotel about 9 a.m., and were finally,
fed breakfast at 10.
While the team was waiting for the morning meal to be served, j
a nasty rumor began to circulate. On the Rice trip, the team had
been served a filling meal of poached eggs before the game, and the;
report was that the menu, set up by trainer Connie Jarvis, was 1 o i
be the same this time. One difference—there were to be three I
poached eggs instead of two.
Reactions to this "threat" were not good.
Gary Van Galder mut.tered, "Connie can have my three—right in
the face."
A 1 Harrington threatened, "I'll go downstairs and get a hambur
ger."
Fortunately for the players' stomachs and Connie's face, the meal
turned out to be steak instead of eggs.
During the lull before going to the stadium to dress for the
game, most of the team took in part of the Illinois-Minnesota game
on TV.

Sideline entertainment was provided during timeouts by Don
Manoukian and Jackie Douglas, who took great delight in mimick
ing TV commentator Red Grange.
I watched the game from high above the field in the press box—
and I mean HIGH above the field. The box is suspended from the
roof, some seven stories above ground level. It hangs out so far
that you're practically looking straight down at the field.
The press box isn't the only notable thing about the stadium,
either. It was built with the upper deck balanced on top of just one
small part of the lower stands.
People at Seattle were quite apprehensive about venturing in
the second deck when the stadium first opened, for far a gust of
wind would send them tumbling onto the field. As a result, posts
were installed at various points to give the appearance of more
strength and rigidity. Construction-wise, the posts don't do a bit of
good; psychologically-wise, they brought fans into the second deck.
Now to the game—AH, THE GAME. We won, Harrington kicked
Ihree out of three, and, well, you know all the details of what hap
pened.

songs four times during the game. . . . Each time, Lightfoot
danced and got a big hand from the 36,000 fans. . . . Bob Roberts
got lots of support from Indian rooters. . . . The Husky mascot,
a brown and white Husky dog. slept through part of the game. . . .
At half-time, all the alums of UW who had won blanket awards in
athletics came on the field, held their blankets up and formed two
columns through which the team ran when it came back on the
field. . . . The columns stretched from the field entrance clear out
to the 40-yard line. . . . The president of UW expressed regrets that
Governor and Mrs. Rossellini couldn't be on hand for the game. . . . j
He neglected to say that they were across the state watching Wash- j
ington State play Oregon.
Immediately after the game, our party went to the airport to !
catch the plane home. Again we were fed after just a few minutes
in tlx 1 air. It was a steak dinner again, and my fourth dinner of
the day (breakfast, which was really a dinner, two chicken dinners
in the press box, and the steak).
All was light hearted and gay on the trip home as the team played
cards, read and snoozed; and the reporters kept Taylor occupied
most of the time. We arrived in San Francisco at 9:30 p.m., were
greeted by girl friends and parents, and bussed back to the campus

small part of the lower stands.
People at Seattle were quite apprehensive about venturing in
the second deck when the stadium first opened, for far a gust of
wind would send them tumbling onto the field. As a result, posts
were installed at various points to give the appearance of more
strength and rigidity. Construction-wise, the posts don't do a bit of
good; psychologically-wise, they brought fans into the second deck.
Now to the game—AH, THE GAME. We won, Harrington kicked
Ihree out of three, and, well, you know all the details of what hap
pened.
A few sidelights on the color at Washington's Homecoming
Game: The queen had to wear a fur coat (temperature, 37 degrees;
wind, 3 mphi. . . . The Husky band, 84 strong, played Stanford
songs four times during the game. . . . Each time, Lightfoot
danced and got a big hand from the 36,000 fans. . . . Bob Roberts
got lots of support from Indian rooters. . . . The Husky mascot,
a brown and white Husky dog. slept through part of the game. . . .
At half-time, all the alums of UW who had won blanket awards in
athletics came on the field, held their blankets up and formed two
columns through which the team ran when it came back on the
field. . . . The columns stretched from the field entrance clear out
to the 40-yard line. . . . The president of UW expressed regrets that
Governor and Mrs. Rossellini couldn't be on hand for the game. . . . j
He neglected to say that they were across the state watching Wash- j
ington State play Oregon.
Immediately after the game, our party went to the airport to !
catch the plane home. Again we were fed after just a few minutes
in tlx 1 air. It was a steak dinner again, and my fourth dinner of
the day (breakfast, which was really a dinner, two chicken dinners
in the press box, and the steak).
All was light hearted and gay on the trip home as the team played
cards, read and snoozed; and the reporters kept Taylor occupied
most of the time. We arrived in San Francisco at 9:30 p.m., were
greeted by girl friends and parents, and bussed back to the campus

The Seattle Trip—Pari II
We broke off yesterday's column for a two-hour rest at the Olym
pic Hotel in Seattle, where the Stanford footballers were awaiting
ihe next day's game with Washington.
At 6 p.m. sharp, we all went into a private dining room at the
Olympic and were greeted with pieces of eight er, I mean, eighi
pieces of-—eight pieces of silverware, that is.
Nothing caused more comment at ttie dinner table than the three
forks, three spoons and two knives that confronted the 37 hungry
football players. But it didn't take anybody very long to wade
through the pile of silver into the chicken dinner that was served.
Shortly after dinner, Chief Lightfoot arrived on ihe scene. It
seems that the Chief was misinformed about the time of departure
from San Francisco, wilh the result that he arrived 20 minutes after
the plane had left.
Not one to give up easily, the Chief scurried to the reservations
counter and purchased a ticket on a 2 p.m. flight to Seattle. All
wont well from then on for Lightfoot.
While Chuck Taylor buzzed back and forth between television
appearances and alumni gatherings during Friday evening, most;
ol the players either watched television or took in an early flick.
One man who did get in his exercise that night was Bob Roberts,
the Stanford assistant yell leader who made the trip to Seattle.
Bob was a feature attraction at a party for Stanford alums from
Ihe Northwest. It wasn't long before they had him leading yells, and
it seems that they responded with lots oi enthusiasm. They weren't
satisfied with the current Indian yells, either, and had Bob leading
ones that were popular years ago, hut have since died out. There
v\as just one tiling they couldn't get Bob to do, however he would
n't let the alums "Give 'Em the Axe."
Stanford football players go to bed early and sleep lale when
Uiey're on the road, and the past weekend was no exception. They
started to wander around the hotel about 9 a.m., and were finally,
fed breakfast at 10.
While the team was waiting for the morning meal to be served, j
a nasty rumor began to circulate. On the Rice trip, the team had
been served a filling meal of poached eggs before the game, and the;
report was that the menu, set up by trainer Connie Jarvis, was 1 o i
be the same this time. One difference—there were to be three I
poached eggs instead of two.
Reactions to this "threat" were not good.
Gary Van Galder mut.tered, "Connie can have my three—right in
the face."
A 1 Harrington threatened, "I'll go downstairs and get a hambur
ger."
Fortunately for the players' stomachs and Connie's face, the meal
turned out to be steak instead of eggs.
During the lull before going to the stadium to dress for the
game, most of the team took in part of the Illinois-Minnesota game
on TV.

Sideline entertainment was provided during timeouts by Don
Manoukian and Jackie Douglas, who took great delight in mimick
ing TV commentator Red Grange.

roof, some seven stories above ground level. It hangs out so far
that you're practically looking straight down at the field.

While Chuck Taylor buzzed back and forth between television
appearances and alumni gatherings during Friday evening, most;
ol the players either watched television or took in an early flick.
One man who did get in his exercise that night was Bob Roberts,
the Stanford assistant yell leader who made the trip to Seattle.
Bob was a feature attraction at a party for Stanford alums from
Ihe Northwest. It wasn't long before they had him leading yells, and
it seems that they responded with lots oi enthusiasm. They weren't
satisfied with the current Indian yells, either, and had Bob leading
ones that were popular years ago, hut have since died out. There
v\as just one tiling they couldn't get Bob to do, however he would
n't let the alums "Give 'Em the Axe."
Stanford football players go to bed early and sleep lale when
Uiey're on the road, and the past weekend was no exception. They
started to wander around the hotel about 9 a.m., and were finally,
fed breakfast at 10.
While the team was waiting for the morning meal to be served, j
a nasty rumor began to circulate. On the Rice trip, the team had
been served a filling meal of poached eggs before the game, and the;
report was that the menu, set up by trainer Connie Jarvis, was 1 o i
be the same this time. One difference—there were to be three I
poached eggs instead of two.
Reactions to this "threat" were not good.
Gary Van Galder mut.tered, "Connie can have my three—right in
the face."
A 1 Harrington threatened, "I'll go downstairs and get a hambur
ger."
Fortunately for the players' stomachs and Connie's face, the meal
turned out to be steak instead of eggs.
During the lull before going to the stadium to dress for the
game, most of the team took in part of the Illinois-Minnesota game
on TV.
Manonk and Jaek Entertain
Sideline entertainment was provided during timeouts by Don
Manoukian and Jackie Douglas, who took great delight in mimick
ing TV commentator Red Grange.
I watched the game from high above the field in the press box—
and I mean HIGH above the field. The box is suspended from the
roof, some seven stories above ground level. It hangs out so far
that you're practically looking straight down at the field.
The press box isn't the only notable thing about the stadium,
either. It was built with the upper deck balanced on top of just one
small part of the lower stands.
People at Seattle were quite apprehensive about venturing in
the second deck when the stadium first opened, for far a gust of
wind would send them tumbling onto the field. As a result, posts
were installed at various points to give the appearance of more
strength and rigidity. Construction-wise, the posts don't do a bit of
good; psychologically-wise, they brought fans into the second deck.
Now to the game—AH, THE GAME. We won, Harrington kicked
Ihree out of three, and, well, you know all the details of what hap
pened.

Game: The queen had to wear a fur coat (temperature, 37 degrees;
wind, 3 mphi. . . . The Husky band, 84 strong, played Stanford
songs four times during the game. . . . Each time, Lightfoot
danced and got a big hand from the 36,000 fans. . . . Bob Roberts
got lots of support from Indian rooters. . . . The Husky mascot,
a brown and white Husky dog. slept through part of the game. . . .
At half-time, all the alums of UW who had won blanket awards in
athletics came on the field, held their blankets up and formed two
columns through which the team ran when it came back on the
field. . . . The columns stretched from the field entrance clear out
to the 40-yard line. . . . The president of UW expressed regrets that
Governor and Mrs. Rossellini couldn't be on hand for the game. . . . j
He neglected to say that they were across the state watching Wash- j
ington State play Oregon.
Immediately after the game, our party went to the airport to !
catch the plane home. Again we were fed after just a few minutes
in tlx 1 air. It was a steak dinner again, and my fourth dinner of
the day (breakfast, which was really a dinner, two chicken dinners
in the press box, and the steak).
All was light hearted and gay on the trip home as the team played
cards, read and snoozed; and the reporters kept Taylor occupied
most of the time. We arrived in San Francisco at 9:30 p.m., were
greeted by girl friends and parents, and bussed back to the campus

The Seattle Trip—Pari II
We broke off yesterday's column for a two-hour rest at the Olym
pic Hotel in Seattle, where the Stanford footballers were awaiting
ihe next day's game with Washington.
At 6 p.m. sharp, we all went into a private dining room at the
Olympic and were greeted with pieces of eight er, I mean, eighi
pieces of-—eight pieces of silverware, that is.
Nothing caused more comment at ttie dinner table than the three
forks, three spoons and two knives that confronted the 37 hungry
football players. But it didn't take anybody very long to wade
through the pile of silver into the chicken dinner that was served.
Shortly after dinner, Chief Lightfoot arrived on ihe scene. It
seems that the Chief was misinformed about the time of departure
from San Francisco, wilh the result that he arrived 20 minutes after
the plane had left.
Not one to give up easily, the Chief scurried to the reservations
counter and purchased a ticket on a 2 p.m. flight to Seattle. All
wont well from then on for Lightfoot.
