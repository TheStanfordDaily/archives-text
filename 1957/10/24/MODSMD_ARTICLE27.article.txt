# Big Red Machine Sets for Single Wing; Taylor Predicts Indians Will Be Ready
## 
### 
Stanford's Indians meet the
UCLA Bruins this Saturday in
one of the Pacific Coast's tradi
tional rivalries. And although the
contest pits Ihe PCC's second
rated running team, Stanford,
against the second-rated passing
team, UCLA, statistics won't
matter much.
Here on campus Ihe Indians
are spending their time trying to
convert into a Big enough and
Red enough Machine to contain
the Bruins' single-wing offense.
"It poses a few problems," Coach
Chuck Taylor admits.

But the Stanford coach feels
that his team will be ready for
the Saturday tussle. And it's true
that the team has some strong
feelings about the game. The In
dians have gone through their
drills with numbers of UCLA
players posted on blocking dum
j mies.
Equal weight is being given to
offensive and defensive tactics in
the Stanford camp as the In
dians reach into their bags 1o
pull out all the tricks they know
; for the Bruins.
I In the Cards' training quarters

there's a reminder to the loo.il
eleven that the last three years
have not been 100 successful in
the UCLA series. Scores of 72-0,;
21-13 and 14-13 are posted along
with a picture of Bruin mentor j
Sanders. And underneath it all
the words "Enough is enough."
Bruin Statements
Clippings from past UCLA
games and the southland sports
contingent's comments about the j
upcoming battle line the walls.
And everywhere the boys look
they are reminded of statements I
like tackle BiJl Leeka's: "Don't J
worry about Stanford—we'll beat |
those guys."
Down south feeling is running
pretty high, too, and ihe Bruins
have let it be known that they
plan to walk out of Stanford Sta
dium on Saturday with another
win under their collective belts.
L.A.'s baby-blue Bruins have
been working out against an In
jun-type offense with reserve Val
Keckin counterfeiting Stanford
qaurterback Jackie Douglas. Ac
cording to reports, semi-Douglas
had a bad day with UCLA backs
intercepting a good number of
his aerials.
Kendal! lin presses
Tailback Chuck Kendall was
most impressive in the Bruin
workouts, but the line sparkled,
too, rushing, and catching, Keck
in on a number of occasions.
Statistically, two Indians ap
pear in the official PCC lists be
fore any Bruins, rushing - wise.
Chuck Shea (4.9) and A 1 Har
rington (5.2) lead Wilson (4.H).
Douglas and Shea lead Long and
Kendall, in that order, in total of
fense.
But Saturday's game won't be
a battle of statistically proven
teams. The game has been taken
out of any columns of facts. The
Bruins always come to Palo Alto
with an axe to grind, and they'll
be meeting a team that knows
how to use one.

pretty high, too, and ihe Bruins
have let it be known that they
plan to walk out of Stanford Sta
dium on Saturday with another
win under their collective belts.
L.A.'s baby-blue Bruins have
been working out against an In
jun-type offense with reserve Val
Keckin counterfeiting Stanford
qaurterback Jackie Douglas. Ac
cording to reports, semi-Douglas
had a bad day with UCLA backs
intercepting a good number of
his aerials.
Kendal! lin presses
Tailback Chuck Kendall was
most impressive in the Bruin
workouts, but the line sparkled,
too, rushing, and catching, Keck
in on a number of occasions.
Statistically, two Indians ap
pear in the official PCC lists be
fore any Bruins, rushing - wise.
Chuck Shea (4.9) and A 1 Har
rington (5.2) lead Wilson (4.H).
Douglas and Shea lead Long and
Kendall, in that order, in total of
fense.
But Saturday's game won't be
a battle of statistically proven
teams. The game has been taken
out of any columns of facts. The
Bruins always come to Palo Alto
with an axe to grind, and they'll
be meeting a team that knows
how to use one.
Stanford's Indians meet the
UCLA Bruins this Saturday in
one of the Pacific Coast's tradi
tional rivalries. And although the
contest pits Ihe PCC's second
rated running team, Stanford,
against the second-rated passing
team, UCLA, statistics won't
matter much.
Here on campus Ihe Indians
are spending their time trying to
convert into a Big enough and
Red enough Machine to contain
the Bruins' single-wing offense.
"It poses a few problems," Coach
Chuck Taylor admits.

But the Stanford coach feels
that his team will be ready for
the Saturday tussle. And it's true
that the team has some strong
feelings about the game. The In
dians have gone through their
drills with numbers of UCLA
players posted on blocking dum
j mies.
Equal weight is being given to
offensive and defensive tactics in
the Stanford camp as the In
dians reach into their bags 1o
pull out all the tricks they know
; for the Bruins.
I In the Cards' training quarters

there's a reminder to the loo.il
eleven that the last three years
have not been 100 successful in
the UCLA series. Scores of 72-0,;
21-13 and 14-13 are posted along
with a picture of Bruin mentor j
Sanders. And underneath it all
the words "Enough is enough."
Bruin Statements

games and the southland sports
contingent's comments about the j
upcoming battle line the walls.
And everywhere the boys look
they are reminded of statements I
like tackle BiJl Leeka's: "Don't J
worry about Stanford—we'll beat |
those guys."
