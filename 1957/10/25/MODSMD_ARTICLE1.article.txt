# U.S. May Cause Another Mid-East War, Arab Says
## Sayegh Sees Turk Attack on Syria; Blames West for Lack of Morals 
### 
A severe indictment of the United States as the link between the
Middle East situation a year ago and that of today was brought for
ward by Dr. Fayez A. Sayegh, head of the Arab League Information
Service in the United States, in a speech last night at Cubberley
Auditorium.
Last year the United States took a moral stand in opposing aggres-

sion, that of Israel upon the Arab
states, nr. Sayegh stated. Today
with political commitments and
alliances as bases for its policy
the' United States may he the
cause of a third Worlr) War by
announcing its intention to aid
lhe aggressor, Turkey, in the
event of an attack by that coun
try upon Syria.
Dr. Sayegh attributed the pres
ent repetition of last years' Mid
dle East situation to the fact that,
instead of analyzing the causes
of the Israeli outbreak, the world,
and the United Nations in partic
ular, basked in the tentative re
lief of peace.
The world, he said, is no closer
today than 12 months ago to a
resolution of its tensions. The
United States has condoned the
conditional, rather than uncondi
tional, withdrawal of Israel from
Gaza, one million Arab refugees
are still waiting to be repatriated
and Jerusalem still has not been
internationalized, the Arab lead
er charged.
Therefore, Dr. Sayegh con
cluded, since the United States is
more concerned with relations be
tween governments than the fate
of the people, the Middle East
has no choice other than further
dealings with the Soviet Union.
Russia has promised her aid to
Syria and the United States has
emboldened Turkey with pledges
of help — a third World War
threatens.
