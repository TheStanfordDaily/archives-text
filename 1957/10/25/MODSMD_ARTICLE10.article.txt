therance of brotherly love was in
voked by Chaplain Minto.
Dean Rhinelander of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences spoke for several minutes,
emphasizing the need for Ameri
cans to understand other coun
tries if they want their country
to be understood abroad.
Rhinelander declared that now
as never before international
friendship is important. He urged
students to take advantage of the
opportunity for experiments in
international understanding pro
vided by the presence of foreign
students among us.
The front porch of the center
served as a stage for the pro
gram while the audience stood on
the lawn in front. Before and
after the program, music from
various foreign countries was
played through a loudspeaker
placed above the porch.
Peter Kirianoff, social vice
president of lIR, danced the na
tive Russian Hopak in full Cos
sack costume. Thomas Orlney
and George Domolky gave a fenc
ing exhibition in a skit satirizing
an opera. To stirring strains of
operatic music they fought over
the lady fair, Jean Risvold. Daily
Queen. Many members of the
audience prudently moved back
when the swordsmen, attired in
Elizabethan doublets, approached
too close and threatened the
crowd with their slashing swords.
Everyone was invited to tour
the center, which was attractive
ly decorated with flowers for the
occasion. The decor is a blend of
foreign influences, with Oriental
furniture and hangings predomi
uating.
