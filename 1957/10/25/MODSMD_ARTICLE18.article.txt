# Tribe Set for UCLA Invasion; Stanford 'High' for Big Battle
## Bruins' Attack Poses Defense Problem for SU Cards Look to Break 3-Year Domination By Los Angeles Foes

Another chapter in the always
exciting Stanford - UCLA series
will he written on the Stanford
Stadium turf tomorrow when the
two teams battle it out for the
28th time in their rough and tum
ble history.
It's hard to say which team
wants the victory more. The
Bruins still feel that the "lily
white" Indians are solely respon
sible for PCC and NCAA penal
ties imposed on them, and would
like nothing better than to show
the Redskins that it doesn't take
seniors to win.
What's more, the Bruins are
doing considerably better tin:;
season than they had been pre
dicted to do, and don't intend to
let down anywhere along the lino,
and least of all in Palo Alto. UC
LA goes into tomorrow's game
with a 4-1 record.
Lastly, the Bruins just don't
like to lose to Stanford. For any
reason.
Tribe Has- Reasons
But the Indians have their rca
sons to win tomorow, too. A1
though Chuck Taylor's eleven
has the edge in the Injun-Bruin
series, 14 games to 12, it's been -i
while since the Indians emerged
from the series with a scalp.
That last time was in "1053
when Stanford found itself down
20-7 before going on to win 21-20.
The following year was a black
one for Stanford. In a game
played in the L.A. Coliseum
coach Red Sanders and his bears
walked all over the Indians, 72 u.
The following year (1955) it.
wasn't so bad, but the UCLAiis
still went back to L.A. happy, 2i
13. And last year the Bruins and
Sanders punctured • some fine
Stanford dreams, turning back
the Injuns before 80,000 in Smog
ville, 14-13.
SU Point Edge
Even though contemporary his
tory seems so black, Stanford
has the point edge in the series,
505-373, including an 82-0 win in
1925 and a 57-0 triumph in 1929.
But it's not the type of game
you figure on this year's statis
tics, last year's record, or a series
history. Anything can happen,
and usually does.
"They're a helluva good team,"
coach Chuck Taylor believes. ' I
just don't know what they're go
ing to throw at us, or how they're
gonna throw it." And he meant


. . and come early —have big fat bruin for supper!"'
