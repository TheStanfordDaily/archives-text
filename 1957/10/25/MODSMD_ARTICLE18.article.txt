# Tribe Set for UCLA Invasion; Stanford 'High' for Big Battle
## Bruins' Attack Poses Defense Problem for SU Cards Look to Break 3-Year Domination By Los Angeles Foes 
### Steve Baffrey 
Another chapter in the always
exciting Stanford - UCLA series
will he written on the Stanford
Stadium turf tomorrow when the
two teams battle it out for the
28th time in their rough and tum
ble history.
It's hard to say which team
wants the victory more. The
Bruins still feel that the "lily
white" Indians are solely respon
sible for PCC and NCAA penal
ties imposed on them, and would
like nothing better than to show
the Redskins that it doesn't take
seniors to win.
What's more, the Bruins are
doing considerably better tin:;
season than they had been pre
dicted to do, and don't intend to
let down anywhere along the lino,
and least of all in Palo Alto. UC
LA goes into tomorrow's game
with a 4-1 record.
Lastly, the Bruins just don't
like to lose to Stanford. For any
reason.
Tribe Has- Reasons
But the Indians have their rca
sons to win tomorow, too. A1
though Chuck Taylor's eleven
has the edge in the Injun-Bruin
series, 14 games to 12, it's been -i
while since the Indians emerged
from the series with a scalp.
That last time was in "1053
when Stanford found itself down
20-7 before going on to win 21-20.
The following year was a black
one for Stanford. In a game
played in the L.A. Coliseum
coach Red Sanders and his bears
walked all over the Indians, 72 u.
The following year (1955) it.
wasn't so bad, but the UCLAiis
still went back to L.A. happy, 2i
13. And last year the Bruins and
Sanders punctured • some fine
Stanford dreams, turning back
the Injuns before 80,000 in Smog
ville, 14-13.
SU Point Edge
Even though contemporary his
tory seems so black, Stanford
has the point edge in the series,
505-373, including an 82-0 win in
1925 and a 57-0 triumph in 1929.
But it's not the type of game
you figure on this year's statis
tics, last year's record, or a series
history. Anything can happen,
and usually does.
"They're a helluva good team,"
coach Chuck Taylor believes. ' I
just don't know what they're go
ing to throw at us, or how they're
gonna throw it." And he meant


. . and come early —have big fat bruin for supper!"'
, that literally and figuratively, for
| UCLA is a sharp passing outfit,
second-rated in the PCC.
In the air the UCLAns have
completed 44 out of 72 passes
with only two having been inter
cepted. Via the above-ground
! lanes the Bruins have amassed
j some 563 yards.
All of the Bruin passers have
! impressive records. Tailbacks
Don Long, Chuck Kendall and
Kirk Wilson have done all the;
throwing so far this season, j
Long has connected on 19 of 28,
Kendall on 13 of 20 and Wilson
on 12 of 24—a1l at the .500 mark
or better.
Single Wing Attack
Defensing against the South-
I land squad has been one of the
| major concerns of the Stanford
I mentor. The Gold and Baby-BJue
j are one of the few teams in the I
country that use the single wing
| attack, and their coach Henry
| ".Red" Sanders is considered a
"mastermind" in this respect.
"We may have to give a little!
oil passing," Taylor noted, "and j
hope that our running game will
! hold up and pull us along. But
i we'll be passing too."
At practice yesterday the team i
j was mixing up its offensive drill!
| with about equal emphasis on
I land and air plays.
Ii
Par..* Patterns Good
Defensively, Ihe squad used a !
good portion of the afternoon to j
set up patterns to use .against
the Sanderisms, and they looked!
good, too. Additional time was
spent in preparation for the out- j
standing UCLA kicking game.
Hclfback John Bond was run
ning with the first squad for a
! while with Starter Jeri McMillin
in with the second unit, but this
' is no indication of a change in
the starting lineup. After prac
tice Taylor was quoted as con
firming the fact that McMillin
| would start at his regular post.
End Joel Freis sat out the
I practice because of a cold, but
! didn't contemplafe missing the
game because of it. There were
no new Indian injuries "this week,
and only one change was noted
i in the Stanford starting eleven.

Gary Van Galder will open at
right end.
Bruin Don Long poses the big
gest*threat to the Indians. Along
with his position of pass leader
ship he is also the team's number
one rusher, averaging 4 15 yards
in 45 carries. The tailback also
leads in three other departments,
total offense with 377 yards, scor
ing four TD's and 24 points, and
kickoff returns- his average is
26 yards.
Other notables in the Bruin
lineup include dangerous end
Dick Wallen, and tailbacks Wil
son and Kendall. Either of the
latter two could steal the starting
role from Long, as both are fig
ured to be among the finest tail
backs in the past few years.
It's unlikely that Long will be
j dislodged, but Kendall and Wil

■ son can plan on seeing a good
Ideal of action, and the Taylors
\ kno<v they have a job on their
j hands in containing any one of
I the three.
Both teams are "up" for the
game,,a feeling that extends not
only from the. rivalry that has
i long existed between them, but
because of their successes last
week.
Up in Seattle the Cards drop
-1 ped Washington 21-14 with half
back and '"golden toe" A 1 Har
rington pleasing Indian fans with
three perfect kicks. Meanwhile,
down in the Coliseum, the Bruins
wre busy as Beavers setting back
highly-touted Oregon State 26-7.
Of course the Bruins won't be
on their own stamping grounds
this week, and that could make
some difference. They're hard to

beat in the big Smogland bowl, |
but so are the Indians in their'
own happy hunting ground.
