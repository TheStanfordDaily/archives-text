# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Barbara Hicks
## Press Shackling Time 
### 
Echoes of last spring- it's press shackling
time again. In Trojan land, University of South
• i') California Senators have proposed an amend
ment to 1 he ASSC constitution providing a "form
of subtle censorship over all student publica
tions," reports the Daily Trojan. The amend
r ent gives the Board of Publications the power
10 recommend the dismissal of the editor if his
policy is deemed not in the best interests of the
community, the administration or the student
body. The by-law amendment was ruled illegal,
but. the sponsoring Senators, Dick Walker and
Larry Knudsen, are expected to try again.

The University of Washington Daily, conduct
ing a survey on racial discrimination in univer
sity district housing, has discovered that the
number of landlords practicing discrimination
has dwindled, partly because of the Little Rock
crisis. "What can we do," landlords said, "but
admit Negroes into our homes after the horrible
thing that happened in Little Rock?" The Wash
ington Daily encountered the opinion that "only
our neighbors, the fraternities, have caused
trouble," in its survey.

Across the bay at Berkeley, the University of
California Health Service has been unable'to ob
tain flu vaccine for wide-scale vaccination. The
Daily Californian points to the efforts of Dr.
George Houck of the Stanford Health Service
in getting ihe vaccine for Stanford students. Dr.
William G. Donald, director of the Cal Health
Service, said that 4000 cases of the "mild dis
ease" have been reported, and the general theme
is, "Why can't Cal get some vaccine, too?"
# it *
Also in the columns of the Daily Californian
is a plea for Cal not to leave the PCC. In July,
1958, the University of California Regents have
granted Berkeley and UCLA permission to with
draw from the Pacific Coast Conference. "We
sincerely hope that Berkeley will not," says the
Californian editorial writer. "The main item of
criticism lately has been the round robin sched

ule which prevails in the conference. UCLA,
USC and California have all come out against
the round robin as of late but supposedly for dif
ferent reasons. It appears fairly obvious that
USC and UCLA are threatening to pull out ,of
the conference if the round robin continues be
cause they are seeking the higher money gates
that would come with more big intersectional
foes. California, on the other hand, has stated
that it feels it should have the right to play
teams who live up to Berkeley's standards. What
these standards are and how many schools can
match them has not been made too clear. We
wonder Whether this is really the reason why
California is threatening to join UCLA and USC
in causing the downfall of the PCC. The fact
that the ASUC has lost heavily on football . . .
may indicate that the Bears are also heeding
the lure of the proverbial pot of gold. And even
if they aren't, it will appear so to others. What
ever the motives, we dont' think California
should withdraw from the PCC."
Colorado State University thinks maybe its
teams will be strengthened if the mascot is
changed from a domestic ram to a mountain
sheep. This would "give us a wild animal that
has as much fight and stamina' as an£ of our
opponents' mascots," says George Snyder, stu
dent president.

"Educators at the administrative level and
boards of education have had a tendency in this
country to think too much of money and not
enough of educational policy," declared Oregon
Governor Robert D. Holmes in speaking at the
University of Oregon recently. "We have been
preached to that economy in government and in
education is the most desirable end of all," the
Oregon Daily Emerald reports Holmes said. "We
have not spent enough money; we have not been
as free from political pressures and practical
considerations as we ought to have been; we
have not been able to operate on an equal plane
with our peers in government and in business."

granted Berkeley and UCLA permission to with
draw from the Pacific Coast Conference. "We
sincerely hope that Berkeley will not," says the
Californian editorial writer. "The main item of
criticism lately has been the round robin sched

the round robin as of late but supposedly for dif

USC and UCLA are threatening to pull out ,of
the conference if the round robin continues be

foes. California, on the other hand, has stated
that it feels it should have the right to play
teams who live up to Berkeley's standards. What
these standards are and how many schools can
match them has not been made too clear. We
wonder Whether this is really the reason why
California is threatening to join UCLA and USC
in causing the downfall of the PCC. The fact
that the ASUC has lost heavily on football . . .
