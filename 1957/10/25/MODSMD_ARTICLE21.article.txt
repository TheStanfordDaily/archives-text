## Horse and Buggy Philosophy 
### Jack Churchill 
John Lynd of the University Planning Office
hns recently defined tlie philosophy of the new
Activity Center as being one of "park and walk."
In discussion of this information it was stated
Ihal this was in accordance with the original phi
losophy of the University designer when Olm
stead laid out the Inner Quad in .1890.
This philosophy is a sound oneâ€”if this is 1890.
However, this scheme is in contradiction to the
everyday demands of our present - 'day living.
When the campus was originally planned and
laid out, there were no automobiles. The first
auto didn't appear in this area until nine year's
later. It was undoubtedly reasonable and neces
sary that students tether their horses off the
main campus, if for no other reason than that
of sanitation.
In addition, the campus was much smaller
then, consisting principally of little more than
Ihe Quadrangle, and the student population was
only a fraction of what it is today.
The Planning Office has told us that for con
structing the new Activity Center, several of the
key roads on campus must be closed. It has been
proposed that Lasuen Street betwen Engineering
< 'orner and Campus Drive, a portion of Lomita
1 )rive and several other streets in the area of the
('enter be closed. Assurances of ample parking
space at the Center have been made. However,
it's just possible that there will be some need
for access roads to get to and from these spaces.
It appears that rather than trying to control
iraffic, the planners are trying to abolish it.
Vague statements have been made saying that
the proposed changes will, "of course, necessi
tate the construction of a new peripheral road
on the west side of campus." Must the students
point out that such a road has to be built before
existing arteries are closed?
During the past several months, the Univer
sity has spent many hundreds of dollars' worth
of labof and materials to neatly color-code the
curbstones in the very areas to be closed off and
lorn out. and hundreds more erecting unwanted
and unnecessary traffic barriers. Why couldn't
lhe.se funds bo put to far more advantageous use
for employing a group of traffic engineers to
specifically study the traffic problem involved
on campus? Such a study has been sorely needed
for many years. Rather than attempt to avoid
congestion by closing roads, and thus putting
further congestion on those remaining open, it
seems reasonable to simply devise controls to
increase efficiency even at the expense of in
stalling much-needed traffic lights at strategic
intersections.
In addition, the University has a responsibility
to the neighborhood. Hundreds of people must
use campus roads in the conducting of everyday
business. Literally thousands come to Stanford

to attend public functions and many of these
people are physically unable to "park and walk"
the unreasonable distances which will be created
by the proposed plans.
If there is a problem of space available, one
possibility for easing this problem might be to
move one of the greatest eyesores on campus,
the Corporation Yard, to a more secluded spot.
This property could be utilized much more prop
erly for student buildings than for the mainte
nance materials now there. It would also help
keep the campus more consolidated and encour
age pedestrian traffic.
If Lomita Drive and Lasuen are closed off
where planned, how are ihe police and fire de
partments to operate efficietnly and effectively?
Last Sunday night the police could have arrived
at the scene of the accident in which Clark King
was killed in half time it actually took had
Los Arboles been'open. In other circumstances,
this time difference could have meant the differ
ence between life and death for someone. Sup
posedly this" road is to lie opened in case of emer
gency. However, it will undoubtedly take as long
to unlock a series of gates, barriers and other
obstructions as to circumvent via open roads.
In the event these roads are closed as planned,
police and fire vehicles will have to travel many
times the existing distance to reach most Quad
buildings and many dormitories. Residents of
Union will have no possible way of driving to
their dorm.
The existing Post Office almost certainly must
continue to operate at its present location during
the proposed construction. Officials have de
clared that for this, the roads surrounding it
must be closed. How then is business to be car
ried on? If there is to be some adjacent route
to remain open, certainly the majority of the
more than eight thousand students here will be
using it to collect mail and Many de
partmental secretaries who pick up and deliver
mail frequently will be forced to endure hectic
congestion or hand-carry moderately heavy loads
great distances.
Supposedly Ihe Activity Center should be eas
ily accessible to studfents regardless of where
they are living, working or studying. The Post
Office, an integral part of the Center, is an auto
matic stopping-point for most students while en
route to classes or living groups. This means
Ihat the Center should serve partially as an ar
terial, rather than an obstruction or bottle-neck.
On a campus Ihe size of Stanford's, a philoso
phy designed in 1890 is not only impractical, it's
impossible. Perhaps the planners would do bet
ter if they started designing Ihe campus for Ihe
needs of the students, rather than attempt to
continue a philosophy that is obsolete and un
realistic in present times.
