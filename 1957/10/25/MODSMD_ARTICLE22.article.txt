r l fM'linique of "Not-think**
Editor, The Daily:
My deepest congratulations to George M. Carr
for his striking broadmindedness in labeling The
Daily as the "Stanford Daily Worker" due 1o ils
publication of the Williamson trip to China. In
doing so, Mr. Carr has shown outstanding ability
in conforming to the all too" prevalent technique
of "not-think" which occurs whenever the Com
munist world is mentioned.
By all means, wc should take every available
opportunity to shut ourselves off from any pos
sible sources of information concerning the coun
tries most affecting us. The very fact that we
dislike these countries serves as ample justifica
tion for ignoring everything about them.
The above theory was, I understand, first
evolved by a particularly intelligent ostrich who,
when bothered by the existence of something he

didn't like, developed the idea of gently placing
his head in the sand and burying it till whatever
was bothering him chose to go away.
Mr. Carr, however several steps above even
the most perceptive of ostriches has borrowed
ihe technique of "labeling." The information pub
lished about China disturbs him; any such infor
mation would. So ho labels it "Communist Party
Line" and tells it to go away.
Perhaps Mr. Williamson's trip to China was
unjustified. Perhaps it did the United States
great damage. Rut 1 wonder if the ever-growing
number of George M. Carrs, with their wonderful
new-found ability to "label rather than think,"
might not, in the long run, do more damage to
the U.S. concepts of freedom than all the China
trips ever made.
Jeff Fadinmn
P.S.—Mr. Carr, have you ever actually "read"
the Official Communist Party Line?
