Chain Letters
Editor, Tlio Daily:
For Ihe past lew weeks there have been chain
letters circulating about campus. These involve
the purchase of the letter for a $25 savings bond
or $18.75. This entitles the purchaser of the
letter to put his name at the bottom of the list
after removing the top name and sending that
person a like sum of money. Two copies of the
letter are then made, each to be given in return
for a $25 bond. Thus the buyer not only gets
back his original investment, but is supposedly
guaranteed unlimited returns as the sale of the
letter progresses.
Although the people who are selling such let
ters tell of the enormous returns, there are many
risks involved in the purchase of the letters. The
Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion feels that the Stanford student body should
be made aware of the existence of these letters
and the risks which they are taking in buying
and selling them.
In theory, everyone who buys such a letter is
guaranteed the receipt of far more than his pur
chase price. In practice, however, the outlook is
not so bright. It seems that many people who
have purchased these letters have found that
when they have tried to find additional buyers
for their two copies, either the letter has already
been around or for other reasons no one is will
ing to buy. Thus the purchaser has lost his $37
investment. Even if he is fortunate enough to
get rid of iiis copies, he may never receive any
greater dividends. Ii is very possible for some
one to remove names from the list or rearrange
them in hope of furthering his own financial re
turns. The chain might also be stopped alto
gether, or, if sent through the mail, it, with its
list of names, might run afoul of postal regula
tions.
Besides being risky chain letters are illegal,
for it is unlawful to exchange money by use of
a chain letter. As a government agency the post
office is quite concerned about the use of the
mails to distribute the letters. Even the local
papers are concerned about the scheme and have
taken a stand against it.
It is the hope of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission that by being in
formed Stanford students will be able to see
through the fallacy of the chain letter and stop
its circulation on the campus.

UC Rooting Section
Editor, The Daily:
The good behavior of the tIC men's rooting
section in California Stadium last Saturday was
a source of amazement to all who witnessed it.
At the conclusion of their card stunts, the male
students, in a quiet and orderly manner, passed,
their cards to the aisles, and not one student
not one—acted so irresponsibly as to toss his
cards into ihe air, even though their team was
ahead at the time, and spirits were high. It was
a remarkable and impressive display of self-con
trol.
How did Ihey achieve such restraint? I do not
know. Perhaps the Daily Californian printed
some timely editorial or perhaps the
head* yell leafier asked for their co-operation
prior to the commencement of the card stunts.
Unless our men's section can be prevailed upon
to similarly discontinue tossing, and retossing
their cards, it is a statistical certainty that some
one will eventually lose the sight of an eye as a
consequence.
This weekend, we will probably have Ihe larg
est crowd of football game visitors to date. Many
of them will have also been at Cal Stadium last
Saturday, and cannot fail to contrast our root
ers' behavior with theirs. Moreover, the more
thought that the UCLA student rooters should
be given the pleasure of seeing us act like spoiled
prcpsters is enough to make a person ill.
Please, everyone—PLEASE.

Free Verse Poetry
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in the review of Miss Moore's
reading which appeared in this morning's Daily.
For the sake of the record, let me correct your
reviewer on two points. A few of Miss Moore's
early poems are in free verse; none of her poems
is in blank verse. Nearly all of ner poems are
rhymed. I suppose that the facts about poetry
seem trivial to you and most of your readers; but
if I am right in this supposition, then you should
not discuss poetry.

Wrong to Tattle?
Editor, The Daily:
I am a freshman girl, and I have a problem.
First, I should tell you that I really like Stanford
no kidding. Having all those boys around all
the time is neat, because I never did see too much
of boys before I carfte here. I really don't know
why that was. Anyway, I never did get to go out
with them in high school, but now I do. Gosh!
Dates and everything sure arc fun. I also like
being able to stay up after midnight and not
having anyone tell me when to go to bed or any
thing -except maybe my sponsor, who's just sucb
a wonderful person anyway. Being away from
home is such a thrill, and so is being a member
of the Stanford family it really is.
Well, anyway, my problem is this: When I
came to Stanford I. was told about the Funda
mental Standard and what it means and all, and
it really is important to me. I've always heard
that drinking is very bad, particularly among
minors, and I believe it's true, too, because my
sponsor said so. Well, I went to a fraternity party
where Ihey were actually drinking liquor and

acting rowdy and everything; so I told my spon
sor all about it, and she told the administration,
and now everything will be all light
It's a funny thing, though -now the fraternity I
men don't ask me. out any more. I was really
getting to like dates, too. Was I wrong to tattle
on someone in the Stanford family? Please
help me.
Bewildered Freshman Girl
Real Puppy Show Business
Editor, The Daily:
Elimination of certain incentives and deckings
from education will in future cause it to be ac
cepted or rejected for what it is.
A case in view is one in which Mi'. Nails Grizzle-
Wolf, sleeping through his letter to the Daily
editor Oct. 17. frets and fumes about Grade Point
Average in the "Bawlout." Incidentally, G.P.A.
has come to mean, according to his private lexi- i
con, General Public Affection. He asks the school
to recognize him for' a contribution he has not 1
made. What a wise-guy! If 1 told Mi'. Nails of a j
boy who requested his mother to recognize him !
for the food he could digest, he might have asked, j
"What's the contribution worthy of recognition?"
If G.P.A. was the only mirror through which
Mr. Nails saw himself as a hero in ihe public eye.
I sympathize, and I would be willing to join
forces with him to storm "Stanford House of
Fame" (C.A.S.), who refuses to recognize other
heroes -except that I have another suggestion
for Mr. Nails. How would it sound to stop play- !
ing ihe Grizzle-Wolf and take up a REAL puppy
show business?

Women's Housing
Editor, The Daily:
We have a problem we would like to put to i
Stanford undergraduate women. The present
housing plan has left many girls dissatisfied, :
particularly the 30 juniors who had to return to
Lagunita for a second year. Furthermore, if we
remain under the present system, next year
there will be approximately 100 juniors who will
be placed in Lagunita for a second time, due to j
the large size of the sophomore class.
Many students have also expressed the desire j
for a better mixture of girls from each class !
within every living group.
What do you think? Our meetings are Monday
evenings at 8 in the AWS office.

Comment, Mr. Smith
Editor, The Daily:
It is very good to learn that America has such |
loyal citizens as Clayton Br uce Smith, who knows j
the number of U.S. casualties of the Korean war
to ihe exact person. However, his figures are |
somewhat misleading, for he did not tell us how
many Koreans and Chinese the U.S. Armed i
Forces killed, for this moy make some of us feel j
that Ihe United States lost more in thai war than
Ihese "yellow faces."
Mr. Smith is perfectly right in saying that The
Daily should never have published any of Mr.
Williamson's articles. We have plenty of food,
clothes and money here. I am sure lhat Ameri
cans can live happily without any of these Red
Chinese jokes. We should all be very "biased" j
toward other people besides ourselves and our I
pets.
Moreover, I am furious about the nonsense
concerning the Russian "moon." It hurts Ameri
cans' feelings and pervades Russian propaganda.
I wonder why the U.S. State Department does
not jail those who talk so loudly about it.

'Innocents Abroad"
Editor, The Daily:
I prefer to borrow Time magazine's term "in
nocents abroad" when contemplating Earl Wil
liamsons' unfortunate junket. However, I keep
asking myself, "Is ii possible to be lhat naive
and yet be a student here?" Pretty please be
careful where you place such youngsters' male
rial in your paper' lest some of us worry about
the "innocents" at home.
The front page story did bring in a lot of good
letters though, didn't it?
Jean Loveless
Vital Statistics
Editor, The Daily:
I was very pleased by the excellent display of i
photography on the front page of Tuesday's
Daily, namely, the Freshman Queen. However,
my delight turned to disappointment when,
while reading the story under the picture, I no
ticed one very important fact was missing, the
Queen's measurements. .
The announcement of any queen contest al
ways contains ihe measurements of the winner, i
Omitting Ihem is like leaving out the eggs in |
ham and eggs or' the beer in beer and pretzels.
They are a vital part of the entire story.
The Daily is a mature newspaper and has ma- j
ture readers. They would not laugh childishly I
if Ihe measurements were given, but would tin
doubtedly approve of them and accept them like
grown-up human beings. It's only fair to ihe
Daily readers lhat a future edition of the paper
make known the statistics.
Editor's Note: You know, we were so en
tranced by our lovely 17-year-old queen from
Branncr 2-YYest (a plug for the house) that we
completely forgot to ask. In the presence of
such pulchritude such questions seem entirely
irrelevant.
For the curious male we suggest the hold
course of asking .leannie, herself. If he is
charming enough with his questions, how could
she refuse?

Chain Letters
Editor, Tlio Daily:
For Ihe past lew weeks there have been chain
letters circulating about campus. These involve
the purchase of the letter for a $25 savings bond
or $18.75. This entitles the purchaser of the
letter to put his name at the bottom of the list
after removing the top name and sending that
person a like sum of money. Two copies of the
letter are then made, each to be given in return
for a $25 bond. Thus the buyer not only gets
back his original investment, but is supposedly
guaranteed unlimited returns as the sale of the
letter progresses.
Although the people who are selling such let
ters tell of the enormous returns, there are many
risks involved in the purchase of the letters. The
Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion feels that the Stanford student body should
be made aware of the existence of these letters
and the risks which they are taking in buying
and selling them.
In theory, everyone who buys such a letter is
guaranteed the receipt of far more than his pur
chase price. In practice, however, the outlook is
not so bright. It seems that many people who
have purchased these letters have found that
when they have tried to find additional buyers
for their two copies, either the letter has already
been around or for other reasons no one is will
ing to buy. Thus the purchaser has lost his $37
investment. Even if he is fortunate enough to
get rid of iiis copies, he may never receive any
greater dividends. Ii is very possible for some
one to remove names from the list or rearrange
them in hope of furthering his own financial re
turns. The chain might also be stopped alto
gether, or, if sent through the mail, it, with its
list of names, might run afoul of postal regula
tions.
Besides being risky chain letters are illegal,
for it is unlawful to exchange money by use of
a chain letter. As a government agency the post
office is quite concerned about the use of the
mails to distribute the letters. Even the local
papers are concerned about the scheme and have
taken a stand against it.
It is the hope of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission that by being in
formed Stanford students will be able to see
through the fallacy of the chain letter and stop
its circulation on the campus.

Editor, The Daily:
The good behavior of the tIC men's rooting
section in California Stadium last Saturday was
a source of amazement to all who witnessed it.
At the conclusion of their card stunts, the male
students, in a quiet and orderly manner, passed,
their cards to the aisles, and not one student
not one—acted so irresponsibly as to toss his
cards into ihe air, even though their team was
ahead at the time, and spirits were high. It was
a remarkable and impressive display of self-con
trol.
How did Ihey achieve such restraint? I do not
know. Perhaps the Daily Californian printed
some timely editorial or perhaps the
head* yell leafier asked for their co-operation
prior to the commencement of the card stunts.
Unless our men's section can be prevailed upon
to similarly discontinue tossing, and retossing
their cards, it is a statistical certainty that some
one will eventually lose the sight of an eye as a
consequence.
This weekend, we will probably have Ihe larg
est crowd of football game visitors to date. Many
of them will have also been at Cal Stadium last
Saturday, and cannot fail to contrast our root
ers' behavior with theirs. Moreover, the more
thought that the UCLA student rooters should
be given the pleasure of seeing us act like spoiled
prcpsters is enough to make a person ill.
Please, everyone—PLEASE.

Free Verse Poetry
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in the review of Miss Moore's
reading which appeared in this morning's Daily.
For the sake of the record, let me correct your
reviewer on two points. A few of Miss Moore's
early poems are in free verse; none of her poems
is in blank verse. Nearly all of ner poems are
rhymed. I suppose that the facts about poetry
seem trivial to you and most of your readers; but
if I am right in this supposition, then you should
not discuss poetry.

Editor, The Daily:
I am a freshman girl, and I have a problem.
First, I should tell you that I really like Stanford
no kidding. Having all those boys around all
the time is neat, because I never did see too much
of boys before I carfte here. I really don't know
why that was. Anyway, I never did get to go out
with them in high school, but now I do. Gosh!
Dates and everything sure arc fun. I also like
being able to stay up after midnight and not
having anyone tell me when to go to bed or any
thing -except maybe my sponsor, who's just sucb
a wonderful person anyway. Being away from
home is such a thrill, and so is being a member
of the Stanford family it really is.
Well, anyway, my problem is this: When I
came to Stanford I. was told about the Funda
mental Standard and what it means and all, and
it really is important to me. I've always heard
that drinking is very bad, particularly among
minors, and I believe it's true, too, because my
sponsor said so. Well, I went to a fraternity party
where Ihey were actually drinking liquor and

acting rowdy and everything; so I told my spon
sor all about it, and she told the administration,
and now everything will be all light
It's a funny thing, though -now the fraternity I
men don't ask me. out any more. I was really
getting to like dates, too. Was I wrong to tattle
on someone in the Stanford family? Please
help me.

Women's Housing
Editor, The Daily:
We have a problem we would like to put to i
Stanford undergraduate women. The present
housing plan has left many girls dissatisfied, :
particularly the 30 juniors who had to return to
Lagunita for a second year. Furthermore, if we
remain under the present system, next year
there will be approximately 100 juniors who will
be placed in Lagunita for a second time, due to j
the large size of the sophomore class.
Many students have also expressed the desire j
for a better mixture of girls from each class !
within every living group.
What do you think? Our meetings are Monday
evenings at 8 in the AWS office.

Editor, The Daily:
It is very good to learn that America has such |
loyal citizens as Clayton Br uce Smith, who knows j
the number of U.S. casualties of the Korean war
to ihe exact person. However, his figures are |
somewhat misleading, for he did not tell us how
many Koreans and Chinese the U.S. Armed i
Forces killed, for this moy make some of us feel j
that Ihe United States lost more in thai war than
Ihese "yellow faces."
Mr. Smith is perfectly right in saying that The
Daily should never have published any of Mr.
Williamson's articles. We have plenty of food,
clothes and money here. I am sure lhat Ameri
cans can live happily without any of these Red
Chinese jokes. We should all be very "biased" j
toward other people besides ourselves and our I
pets.
Moreover, I am furious about the nonsense
concerning the Russian "moon." It hurts Ameri
cans' feelings and pervades Russian propaganda.
I wonder why the U.S. State Department does
not jail those who talk so loudly about it.

photography on the front page of Tuesday's

my delight turned to disappointment when,
while reading the story under the picture, I no
ticed one very important fact was missing, the
Queen's measurements. .
The announcement of any queen contest al
ways contains ihe measurements of the winner, i
Omitting Ihem is like leaving out the eggs in |
ham and eggs or' the beer in beer and pretzels.
They are a vital part of the entire story.
The Daily is a mature newspaper and has ma- j
ture readers. They would not laugh childishly I
if Ihe measurements were given, but would tin
doubtedly approve of them and accept them like
grown-up human beings. It's only fair to ihe
Daily readers lhat a future edition of the paper
make known the statistics.
Editor's Note: You know, we were so en
tranced by our lovely 17-year-old queen from
Branncr 2-YYest (a plug for the house) that we
completely forgot to ask. In the presence of
such pulchritude such questions seem entirely
irrelevant.

Chain Letters
Editor, Tlio Daily:
For Ihe past lew weeks there have been chain
letters circulating about campus. These involve
the purchase of the letter for a $25 savings bond
or $18.75. This entitles the purchaser of the
letter to put his name at the bottom of the list
after removing the top name and sending that
person a like sum of money. Two copies of the
letter are then made, each to be given in return
for a $25 bond. Thus the buyer not only gets
back his original investment, but is supposedly
guaranteed unlimited returns as the sale of the
letter progresses.
Although the people who are selling such let
ters tell of the enormous returns, there are many
risks involved in the purchase of the letters. The
Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion feels that the Stanford student body should
be made aware of the existence of these letters
and the risks which they are taking in buying
and selling them.
In theory, everyone who buys such a letter is
guaranteed the receipt of far more than his pur
chase price. In practice, however, the outlook is
not so bright. It seems that many people who
have purchased these letters have found that
when they have tried to find additional buyers
for their two copies, either the letter has already
been around or for other reasons no one is will
ing to buy. Thus the purchaser has lost his $37
investment. Even if he is fortunate enough to
get rid of iiis copies, he may never receive any
greater dividends. Ii is very possible for some
one to remove names from the list or rearrange
them in hope of furthering his own financial re
turns. The chain might also be stopped alto
gether, or, if sent through the mail, it, with its
list of names, might run afoul of postal regula
tions.
Besides being risky chain letters are illegal,
for it is unlawful to exchange money by use of
a chain letter. As a government agency the post
office is quite concerned about the use of the
mails to distribute the letters. Even the local
papers are concerned about the scheme and have
taken a stand against it.
It is the hope of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission that by being in
formed Stanford students will be able to see
through the fallacy of the chain letter and stop
its circulation on the campus.

Editor, The Daily:
The good behavior of the tIC men's rooting
section in California Stadium last Saturday was
a source of amazement to all who witnessed it.
At the conclusion of their card stunts, the male
students, in a quiet and orderly manner, passed,
their cards to the aisles, and not one student
not one—acted so irresponsibly as to toss his
cards into ihe air, even though their team was
ahead at the time, and spirits were high. It was
a remarkable and impressive display of self-con
trol.
How did Ihey achieve such restraint? I do not
know. Perhaps the Daily Californian printed
some timely editorial or perhaps the
head* yell leafier asked for their co-operation
prior to the commencement of the card stunts.
Unless our men's section can be prevailed upon
to similarly discontinue tossing, and retossing
their cards, it is a statistical certainty that some
one will eventually lose the sight of an eye as a
consequence.
This weekend, we will probably have Ihe larg
est crowd of football game visitors to date. Many
of them will have also been at Cal Stadium last
Saturday, and cannot fail to contrast our root
ers' behavior with theirs. Moreover, the more
thought that the UCLA student rooters should
be given the pleasure of seeing us act like spoiled
prcpsters is enough to make a person ill.
Please, everyone—PLEASE.

Free Verse Poetry
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in the review of Miss Moore's
reading which appeared in this morning's Daily.
For the sake of the record, let me correct your
reviewer on two points. A few of Miss Moore's
early poems are in free verse; none of her poems
is in blank verse. Nearly all of ner poems are
rhymed. I suppose that the facts about poetry
seem trivial to you and most of your readers; but
if I am right in this supposition, then you should
not discuss poetry.

Editor, The Daily:
I am a freshman girl, and I have a problem.
First, I should tell you that I really like Stanford
no kidding. Having all those boys around all
the time is neat, because I never did see too much
of boys before I carfte here. I really don't know
why that was. Anyway, I never did get to go out
with them in high school, but now I do. Gosh!
Dates and everything sure arc fun. I also like
being able to stay up after midnight and not
having anyone tell me when to go to bed or any
thing -except maybe my sponsor, who's just sucb
a wonderful person anyway. Being away from
home is such a thrill, and so is being a member
of the Stanford family it really is.
Well, anyway, my problem is this: When I
came to Stanford I. was told about the Funda
mental Standard and what it means and all, and
it really is important to me. I've always heard
that drinking is very bad, particularly among
minors, and I believe it's true, too, because my
sponsor said so. Well, I went to a fraternity party
where Ihey were actually drinking liquor and

acting rowdy and everything; so I told my spon
sor all about it, and she told the administration,
and now everything will be all light
It's a funny thing, though -now the fraternity I
men don't ask me. out any more. I was really
getting to like dates, too. Was I wrong to tattle
on someone in the Stanford family? Please
help me.

Women's Housing
Editor, The Daily:
We have a problem we would like to put to i
Stanford undergraduate women. The present
housing plan has left many girls dissatisfied, :
particularly the 30 juniors who had to return to
Lagunita for a second year. Furthermore, if we
remain under the present system, next year
there will be approximately 100 juniors who will
be placed in Lagunita for a second time, due to j
the large size of the sophomore class.
Many students have also expressed the desire j
for a better mixture of girls from each class !
within every living group.
What do you think? Our meetings are Monday
evenings at 8 in the AWS office.

Editor, The Daily:
It is very good to learn that America has such |
loyal citizens as Clayton Br uce Smith, who knows j
the number of U.S. casualties of the Korean war
to ihe exact person. However, his figures are |
somewhat misleading, for he did not tell us how
many Koreans and Chinese the U.S. Armed i
Forces killed, for this moy make some of us feel j
that Ihe United States lost more in thai war than
Ihese "yellow faces."
Mr. Smith is perfectly right in saying that The
Daily should never have published any of Mr.
Williamson's articles. We have plenty of food,
clothes and money here. I am sure lhat Ameri
cans can live happily without any of these Red
Chinese jokes. We should all be very "biased" j
toward other people besides ourselves and our I
pets.
Moreover, I am furious about the nonsense
concerning the Russian "moon." It hurts Ameri
cans' feelings and pervades Russian propaganda.
I wonder why the U.S. State Department does
not jail those who talk so loudly about it.

my delight turned to disappointment when,
while reading the story under the picture, I no
ticed one very important fact was missing, the
Queen's measurements. .
The announcement of any queen contest al
ways contains ihe measurements of the winner, i
Omitting Ihem is like leaving out the eggs in |

They are a vital part of the entire story.
The Daily is a mature newspaper and has ma- j
ture readers. They would not laugh childishly I
if Ihe measurements were given, but would tin
doubtedly approve of them and accept them like
grown-up human beings. It's only fair to ihe
Daily readers lhat a future edition of the paper
make known the statistics.

Chain Letters
Editor, Tlio Daily:
For Ihe past lew weeks there have been chain
letters circulating about campus. These involve
the purchase of the letter for a $25 savings bond
or $18.75. This entitles the purchaser of the
letter to put his name at the bottom of the list
after removing the top name and sending that
person a like sum of money. Two copies of the
letter are then made, each to be given in return
for a $25 bond. Thus the buyer not only gets
back his original investment, but is supposedly
guaranteed unlimited returns as the sale of the
letter progresses.
Although the people who are selling such let
ters tell of the enormous returns, there are many
risks involved in the purchase of the letters. The
Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion feels that the Stanford student body should
be made aware of the existence of these letters
and the risks which they are taking in buying
and selling them.
In theory, everyone who buys such a letter is
guaranteed the receipt of far more than his pur
chase price. In practice, however, the outlook is
not so bright. It seems that many people who
have purchased these letters have found that
when they have tried to find additional buyers
for their two copies, either the letter has already
been around or for other reasons no one is will
ing to buy. Thus the purchaser has lost his $37
investment. Even if he is fortunate enough to
get rid of iiis copies, he may never receive any
greater dividends. Ii is very possible for some
one to remove names from the list or rearrange
them in hope of furthering his own financial re
turns. The chain might also be stopped alto
gether, or, if sent through the mail, it, with its
list of names, might run afoul of postal regula
tions.
Besides being risky chain letters are illegal,
for it is unlawful to exchange money by use of
a chain letter. As a government agency the post
office is quite concerned about the use of the
mails to distribute the letters. Even the local
papers are concerned about the scheme and have
taken a stand against it.
It is the hope of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission that by being in
formed Stanford students will be able to see
through the fallacy of the chain letter and stop
its circulation on the campus.

Editor, The Daily:
The good behavior of the tIC men's rooting
section in California Stadium last Saturday was
a source of amazement to all who witnessed it.
At the conclusion of their card stunts, the male
students, in a quiet and orderly manner, passed,
their cards to the aisles, and not one student
not one—acted so irresponsibly as to toss his
cards into ihe air, even though their team was
ahead at the time, and spirits were high. It was
a remarkable and impressive display of self-con
trol.
How did Ihey achieve such restraint? I do not
know. Perhaps the Daily Californian printed
some timely editorial or perhaps the
head* yell leafier asked for their co-operation
prior to the commencement of the card stunts.
Unless our men's section can be prevailed upon
to similarly discontinue tossing, and retossing
their cards, it is a statistical certainty that some
one will eventually lose the sight of an eye as a
consequence.
This weekend, we will probably have Ihe larg
est crowd of football game visitors to date. Many
of them will have also been at Cal Stadium last
Saturday, and cannot fail to contrast our root
ers' behavior with theirs. Moreover, the more
thought that the UCLA student rooters should
be given the pleasure of seeing us act like spoiled
prcpsters is enough to make a person ill.
Please, everyone—PLEASE.

Free Verse Poetry
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in the review of Miss Moore's
reading which appeared in this morning's Daily.
For the sake of the record, let me correct your
reviewer on two points. A few of Miss Moore's
early poems are in free verse; none of her poems
is in blank verse. Nearly all of ner poems are
rhymed. I suppose that the facts about poetry
seem trivial to you and most of your readers; but
if I am right in this supposition, then you should
not discuss poetry.

Editor, The Daily:
I am a freshman girl, and I have a problem.
First, I should tell you that I really like Stanford
no kidding. Having all those boys around all
the time is neat, because I never did see too much
of boys before I carfte here. I really don't know
why that was. Anyway, I never did get to go out
with them in high school, but now I do. Gosh!
Dates and everything sure arc fun. I also like
being able to stay up after midnight and not
having anyone tell me when to go to bed or any
thing -except maybe my sponsor, who's just sucb
a wonderful person anyway. Being away from
home is such a thrill, and so is being a member
of the Stanford family it really is.
Well, anyway, my problem is this: When I
came to Stanford I. was told about the Funda
mental Standard and what it means and all, and
it really is important to me. I've always heard
that drinking is very bad, particularly among
minors, and I believe it's true, too, because my
sponsor said so. Well, I went to a fraternity party
where Ihey were actually drinking liquor and

acting rowdy and everything; so I told my spon
sor all about it, and she told the administration,
and now everything will be all light
It's a funny thing, though -now the fraternity I
men don't ask me. out any more. I was really
getting to like dates, too. Was I wrong to tattle
on someone in the Stanford family? Please
help me.

Women's Housing
Editor, The Daily:
We have a problem we would like to put to i
Stanford undergraduate women. The present
housing plan has left many girls dissatisfied, :
particularly the 30 juniors who had to return to
Lagunita for a second year. Furthermore, if we
remain under the present system, next year
there will be approximately 100 juniors who will
be placed in Lagunita for a second time, due to j
the large size of the sophomore class.
Many students have also expressed the desire j
for a better mixture of girls from each class !
within every living group.
What do you think? Our meetings are Monday
evenings at 8 in the AWS office.

Editor, The Daily:
It is very good to learn that America has such |
loyal citizens as Clayton Br uce Smith, who knows j
the number of U.S. casualties of the Korean war
to ihe exact person. However, his figures are |
somewhat misleading, for he did not tell us how
many Koreans and Chinese the U.S. Armed i
Forces killed, for this moy make some of us feel j
that Ihe United States lost more in thai war than
Ihese "yellow faces."
Mr. Smith is perfectly right in saying that The
Daily should never have published any of Mr.
Williamson's articles. We have plenty of food,
clothes and money here. I am sure lhat Ameri
cans can live happily without any of these Red
Chinese jokes. We should all be very "biased" j
toward other people besides ourselves and our I
pets.
Moreover, I am furious about the nonsense
concerning the Russian "moon." It hurts Ameri
cans' feelings and pervades Russian propaganda.
I wonder why the U.S. State Department does
not jail those who talk so loudly about it.

my delight turned to disappointment when,
while reading the story under the picture, I no

Queen's measurements. .
The announcement of any queen contest al
ways contains ihe measurements of the winner, i
Omitting Ihem is like leaving out the eggs in |

They are a vital part of the entire story.
The Daily is a mature newspaper and has ma- j

if Ihe measurements were given, but would tin

tranced by our lovely 17-year-old queen from
Branncr 2-YYest (a plug for the house) that we
completely forgot to ask. In the presence of
such pulchritude such questions seem entirely
irrelevant.
For the curious male we suggest the hold

Chain Letters
Editor, Tlio Daily:
For Ihe past lew weeks there have been chain
letters circulating about campus. These involve
the purchase of the letter for a $25 savings bond
or $18.75. This entitles the purchaser of the
letter to put his name at the bottom of the list
after removing the top name and sending that
person a like sum of money. Two copies of the
letter are then made, each to be given in return
for a $25 bond. Thus the buyer not only gets
back his original investment, but is supposedly
guaranteed unlimited returns as the sale of the
letter progresses.
Although the people who are selling such let
ters tell of the enormous returns, there are many
risks involved in the purchase of the letters. The
Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion feels that the Stanford student body should
be made aware of the existence of these letters
and the risks which they are taking in buying
and selling them.
In theory, everyone who buys such a letter is
guaranteed the receipt of far more than his pur
chase price. In practice, however, the outlook is
not so bright. It seems that many people who
have purchased these letters have found that
when they have tried to find additional buyers
for their two copies, either the letter has already
been around or for other reasons no one is will
ing to buy. Thus the purchaser has lost his $37
investment. Even if he is fortunate enough to
get rid of iiis copies, he may never receive any
greater dividends. Ii is very possible for some
one to remove names from the list or rearrange
them in hope of furthering his own financial re
turns. The chain might also be stopped alto
gether, or, if sent through the mail, it, with its
list of names, might run afoul of postal regula
tions.
Besides being risky chain letters are illegal,
for it is unlawful to exchange money by use of
a chain letter. As a government agency the post
office is quite concerned about the use of the
mails to distribute the letters. Even the local
papers are concerned about the scheme and have
taken a stand against it.
It is the hope of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission that by being in
formed Stanford students will be able to see
through the fallacy of the chain letter and stop
its circulation on the campus.

Editor, The Daily:
The good behavior of the tIC men's rooting
section in California Stadium last Saturday was
a source of amazement to all who witnessed it.
At the conclusion of their card stunts, the male
students, in a quiet and orderly manner, passed,
their cards to the aisles, and not one student
not one—acted so irresponsibly as to toss his
cards into ihe air, even though their team was
ahead at the time, and spirits were high. It was
a remarkable and impressive display of self-con
trol.
How did Ihey achieve such restraint? I do not
know. Perhaps the Daily Californian printed
some timely editorial or perhaps the
head* yell leafier asked for their co-operation
prior to the commencement of the card stunts.
Unless our men's section can be prevailed upon
to similarly discontinue tossing, and retossing
their cards, it is a statistical certainty that some
one will eventually lose the sight of an eye as a
consequence.
This weekend, we will probably have Ihe larg
est crowd of football game visitors to date. Many
of them will have also been at Cal Stadium last
Saturday, and cannot fail to contrast our root
ers' behavior with theirs. Moreover, the more
thought that the UCLA student rooters should
be given the pleasure of seeing us act like spoiled
prcpsters is enough to make a person ill.
Please, everyone—PLEASE.

Free Verse Poetry
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in the review of Miss Moore's
reading which appeared in this morning's Daily.
For the sake of the record, let me correct your
reviewer on two points. A few of Miss Moore's
early poems are in free verse; none of her poems
is in blank verse. Nearly all of ner poems are
rhymed. I suppose that the facts about poetry
seem trivial to you and most of your readers; but
if I am right in this supposition, then you should
not discuss poetry.

Editor, The Daily:
I am a freshman girl, and I have a problem.
First, I should tell you that I really like Stanford
no kidding. Having all those boys around all
the time is neat, because I never did see too much
of boys before I carfte here. I really don't know
why that was. Anyway, I never did get to go out
with them in high school, but now I do. Gosh!
Dates and everything sure arc fun. I also like
being able to stay up after midnight and not
having anyone tell me when to go to bed or any
thing -except maybe my sponsor, who's just sucb
a wonderful person anyway. Being away from
home is such a thrill, and so is being a member
of the Stanford family it really is.
Well, anyway, my problem is this: When I
came to Stanford I. was told about the Funda
mental Standard and what it means and all, and
it really is important to me. I've always heard
that drinking is very bad, particularly among
minors, and I believe it's true, too, because my
sponsor said so. Well, I went to a fraternity party
where Ihey were actually drinking liquor and

acting rowdy and everything; so I told my spon
sor all about it, and she told the administration,
and now everything will be all light
It's a funny thing, though -now the fraternity I
men don't ask me. out any more. I was really
getting to like dates, too. Was I wrong to tattle
on someone in the Stanford family? Please
help me.

Women's Housing
Editor, The Daily:
We have a problem we would like to put to i
Stanford undergraduate women. The present
housing plan has left many girls dissatisfied, :
particularly the 30 juniors who had to return to
Lagunita for a second year. Furthermore, if we
remain under the present system, next year
there will be approximately 100 juniors who will
be placed in Lagunita for a second time, due to j
the large size of the sophomore class.
Many students have also expressed the desire j
for a better mixture of girls from each class !
within every living group.
What do you think? Our meetings are Monday
evenings at 8 in the AWS office.

Editor, The Daily:
It is very good to learn that America has such |
loyal citizens as Clayton Br uce Smith, who knows j
the number of U.S. casualties of the Korean war
to ihe exact person. However, his figures are |
somewhat misleading, for he did not tell us how
many Koreans and Chinese the U.S. Armed i
Forces killed, for this moy make some of us feel j
that Ihe United States lost more in thai war than
Ihese "yellow faces."
Mr. Smith is perfectly right in saying that The
Daily should never have published any of Mr.
Williamson's articles. We have plenty of food,
clothes and money here. I am sure lhat Ameri
cans can live happily without any of these Red
Chinese jokes. We should all be very "biased" j
toward other people besides ourselves and our I
pets.
Moreover, I am furious about the nonsense
concerning the Russian "moon." It hurts Ameri
cans' feelings and pervades Russian propaganda.
I wonder why the U.S. State Department does
not jail those who talk so loudly about it.

The announcement of any queen contest al

They are a vital part of the entire story.
The Daily is a mature newspaper and has ma- j

make known the statistics.
Editor's Note: You know, we were so en
tranced by our lovely 17-year-old queen from
Branncr 2-YYest (a plug for the house) that we
completely forgot to ask. In the presence of
such pulchritude such questions seem entirely
irrelevant.
For the curious male we suggest the hold
course of asking .leannie, herself. If he is
charming enough with his questions, how could
she refuse?
Chain Letters
Editor, Tlio Daily:
For Ihe past lew weeks there have been chain
letters circulating about campus. These involve
the purchase of the letter for a $25 savings bond
or $18.75. This entitles the purchaser of the
letter to put his name at the bottom of the list
after removing the top name and sending that
person a like sum of money. Two copies of the
letter are then made, each to be given in return
for a $25 bond. Thus the buyer not only gets
back his original investment, but is supposedly
guaranteed unlimited returns as the sale of the
letter progresses.
Although the people who are selling such let
ters tell of the enormous returns, there are many
risks involved in the purchase of the letters. The
Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion feels that the Stanford student body should
be made aware of the existence of these letters
and the risks which they are taking in buying
and selling them.
In theory, everyone who buys such a letter is
guaranteed the receipt of far more than his pur
chase price. In practice, however, the outlook is
not so bright. It seems that many people who
have purchased these letters have found that
when they have tried to find additional buyers
for their two copies, either the letter has already
been around or for other reasons no one is will
ing to buy. Thus the purchaser has lost his $37
investment. Even if he is fortunate enough to
get rid of iiis copies, he may never receive any
greater dividends. Ii is very possible for some
one to remove names from the list or rearrange
them in hope of furthering his own financial re
turns. The chain might also be stopped alto
gether, or, if sent through the mail, it, with its
list of names, might run afoul of postal regula
tions.
Besides being risky chain letters are illegal,
for it is unlawful to exchange money by use of
a chain letter. As a government agency the post
office is quite concerned about the use of the
mails to distribute the letters. Even the local
papers are concerned about the scheme and have
taken a stand against it.
It is the hope of the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission that by being in
formed Stanford students will be able to see
through the fallacy of the chain letter and stop
its circulation on the campus.

UC Rooting Section
Editor, The Daily:
The good behavior of the tIC men's rooting
section in California Stadium last Saturday was
a source of amazement to all who witnessed it.
At the conclusion of their card stunts, the male
students, in a quiet and orderly manner, passed,
their cards to the aisles, and not one student
not one—acted so irresponsibly as to toss his
cards into ihe air, even though their team was
ahead at the time, and spirits were high. It was
a remarkable and impressive display of self-con
trol.
How did Ihey achieve such restraint? I do not
know. Perhaps the Daily Californian printed
some timely editorial or perhaps the
head* yell leafier asked for their co-operation
prior to the commencement of the card stunts.
Unless our men's section can be prevailed upon
to similarly discontinue tossing, and retossing
their cards, it is a statistical certainty that some
one will eventually lose the sight of an eye as a
consequence.
This weekend, we will probably have Ihe larg
est crowd of football game visitors to date. Many
of them will have also been at Cal Stadium last
Saturday, and cannot fail to contrast our root
ers' behavior with theirs. Moreover, the more
thought that the UCLA student rooters should
be given the pleasure of seeing us act like spoiled
prcpsters is enough to make a person ill.
Please, everyone—PLEASE.

Free Verse Poetry
Editor, The Daily:
I was interested in the review of Miss Moore's
reading which appeared in this morning's Daily.
For the sake of the record, let me correct your
reviewer on two points. A few of Miss Moore's
early poems are in free verse; none of her poems
is in blank verse. Nearly all of ner poems are
rhymed. I suppose that the facts about poetry
seem trivial to you and most of your readers; but
if I am right in this supposition, then you should
not discuss poetry.

Wrong to Tattle?
Editor, The Daily:
I am a freshman girl, and I have a problem.
First, I should tell you that I really like Stanford
no kidding. Having all those boys around all
the time is neat, because I never did see too much
of boys before I carfte here. I really don't know
why that was. Anyway, I never did get to go out
with them in high school, but now I do. Gosh!
Dates and everything sure arc fun. I also like
being able to stay up after midnight and not
having anyone tell me when to go to bed or any
thing -except maybe my sponsor, who's just sucb
a wonderful person anyway. Being away from
home is such a thrill, and so is being a member
of the Stanford family it really is.
Well, anyway, my problem is this: When I
came to Stanford I. was told about the Funda
mental Standard and what it means and all, and
it really is important to me. I've always heard
that drinking is very bad, particularly among
minors, and I believe it's true, too, because my
sponsor said so. Well, I went to a fraternity party
where Ihey were actually drinking liquor and

acting rowdy and everything; so I told my spon
sor all about it, and she told the administration,
and now everything will be all light
It's a funny thing, though -now the fraternity I
men don't ask me. out any more. I was really
getting to like dates, too. Was I wrong to tattle
on someone in the Stanford family? Please
help me.

Real Puppy Show Business
Editor, The Daily:
Elimination of certain incentives and deckings
from education will in future cause it to be ac
cepted or rejected for what it is.
A case in view is one in which Mi'. Nails Grizzle-
Wolf, sleeping through his letter to the Daily
editor Oct. 17. frets and fumes about Grade Point
Average in the "Bawlout." Incidentally, G.P.A.
has come to mean, according to his private lexi- i
con, General Public Affection. He asks the school
to recognize him for' a contribution he has not 1
made. What a wise-guy! If 1 told Mi'. Nails of a j
boy who requested his mother to recognize him !
for the food he could digest, he might have asked, j
"What's the contribution worthy of recognition?"
If G.P.A. was the only mirror through which
Mr. Nails saw himself as a hero in ihe public eye.
I sympathize, and I would be willing to join
forces with him to storm "Stanford House of
Fame" (C.A.S.), who refuses to recognize other
heroes -except that I have another suggestion
for Mr. Nails. How would it sound to stop play- !
ing ihe Grizzle-Wolf and take up a REAL puppy
show business?

Women's Housing
Editor, The Daily:
We have a problem we would like to put to i
Stanford undergraduate women. The present
housing plan has left many girls dissatisfied, :
particularly the 30 juniors who had to return to
Lagunita for a second year. Furthermore, if we
remain under the present system, next year
there will be approximately 100 juniors who will
be placed in Lagunita for a second time, due to j
the large size of the sophomore class.
Many students have also expressed the desire j
for a better mixture of girls from each class !
within every living group.
What do you think? Our meetings are Monday
evenings at 8 in the AWS office.

Comment, Mr. Smith
Editor, The Daily:
It is very good to learn that America has such |
loyal citizens as Clayton Br uce Smith, who knows j
the number of U.S. casualties of the Korean war
to ihe exact person. However, his figures are |
somewhat misleading, for he did not tell us how
many Koreans and Chinese the U.S. Armed i
Forces killed, for this moy make some of us feel j
that Ihe United States lost more in thai war than
Ihese "yellow faces."
Mr. Smith is perfectly right in saying that The
Daily should never have published any of Mr.
Williamson's articles. We have plenty of food,
clothes and money here. I am sure lhat Ameri
cans can live happily without any of these Red
Chinese jokes. We should all be very "biased" j
toward other people besides ourselves and our I
pets.
Moreover, I am furious about the nonsense
concerning the Russian "moon." It hurts Ameri
cans' feelings and pervades Russian propaganda.
I wonder why the U.S. State Department does
not jail those who talk so loudly about it.

'Innocents Abroad"
Editor, The Daily:
I prefer to borrow Time magazine's term "in
nocents abroad" when contemplating Earl Wil
liamsons' unfortunate junket. However, I keep
asking myself, "Is ii possible to be lhat naive
and yet be a student here?" Pretty please be
careful where you place such youngsters' male
rial in your paper' lest some of us worry about
the "innocents" at home.
The front page story did bring in a lot of good
letters though, didn't it?

Vital Statistics
Editor, The Daily:
I was very pleased by the excellent display of i
photography on the front page of Tuesday's
Daily, namely, the Freshman Queen. However,
my delight turned to disappointment when,
while reading the story under the picture, I no
ticed one very important fact was missing, the
Queen's measurements. .
The announcement of any queen contest al
ways contains ihe measurements of the winner, i
Omitting Ihem is like leaving out the eggs in |
ham and eggs or' the beer in beer and pretzels.
They are a vital part of the entire story.
The Daily is a mature newspaper and has ma- j
ture readers. They would not laugh childishly I
if Ihe measurements were given, but would tin
doubtedly approve of them and accept them like
grown-up human beings. It's only fair to ihe
Daily readers lhat a future edition of the paper
make known the statistics.
Editor's Note: You know, we were so en
tranced by our lovely 17-year-old queen from
Branncr 2-YYest (a plug for the house) that we
completely forgot to ask. In the presence of
such pulchritude such questions seem entirely
irrelevant.
For the curious male we suggest the hold
course of asking .leannie, herself. If he is
charming enough with his questions, how could
