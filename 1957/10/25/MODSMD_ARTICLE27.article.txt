Marlboro, for they are the most agreeable (if men.

savage of breasts. I refer not only to the flavor which, as
everyone knows, is a delight to the palate, but also to
the Marlboro container. Here is no fiendishly contrived
device to fray the fingernails and rasp the nerves; here,

Let us begin our series of science lessons with chemis
try. Jt is filling that chemistry should be the first, for it
is the oldest of sciences, having been discovered by Ben
jamin Franklin in 108 B.C. when an apple fell on his head
while he was shooting the breeze with Pythagoras one
day outside the Acropolis. (The reason they were outside
the Acropolis and not inside was that Pythagoras had been
thrown out for drawing right triangles all over the walls.)

They had several meetings outside the Acropolis, but
finally Franklin said, "Look. Pythagoras, this is nothing
against you, see, but. I'm no youngster anymore and if
I keep laying around on this wet grass with you, I'm
liable to got breakbone fever. I'm going inside."
Pythagoras, friendless now, moped around Athens for
awhile, then drifted off to Monaco where lie married a
girl named Harriet Sigafoos and went into the chuck-a
luek business. (lie would certainly be forgotten today had
not Shakespeare written "You Know Me, AI. M )

try, and the best way to begin is with fundamentals.
('hemieals are divided into elements. There are four: air,
cart h, fire, and water. Any number of delightful combina
tions can 1k i made from these elements, such as firewater,
dacron, and chef's salad.
Chemicals can be further divided into the classes of
explosive and non-explosive. A wise chemist always
touches a match to his chemicals before lie begins an
experiment.
A variety of vessels of different sizes and shapes are
used in a chemistry lab. There are tubes, vials, beakers,
flasks, pipet tes, and retorts. A retort is also a snappy come
back, such as "Oli, yeah?" and "So's your Facie Oscar."
I have now told you the most important aspects of
chemistry, but there are many more- far too many to
cover in the space remaining here. However, I am sure
there is a fine chemistry lab on your very own campus.
Why don't you g<> up some afternoon and poke around?
