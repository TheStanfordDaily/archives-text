Leland Stanford Junior Mu
seum, built in 1891, was at one
time the largest university mu
seum in the world, according to
John David La Plante, assistant
director of the Museum.
Although somewhat antiquated
today, it still ranks favorably with
other college historical collections
and continues to enlarge and im
prove its vast displays, which
were originally begun by the Le
land Stanford family.
The Museum, located on Lo
mita Drive beyond the chemistry
building, attracts over 30,000 visi
tors each year.
Several Million
Most of the exhibits, which are
collectively valued at several mil
lion dollars, were obtained by
Mrs. Stanford. Some of the ob
jects displayed were procured in
unusual, ways.
The Cypriot pottery had origi
nally belonged to the Metropoli
tan, but the Stanfords outbid (he
Boston Museum, which also want
ed it. The oriental collection was
en route to the British Museum
from Japan when Mrs. Stanford
convinced the shipper to sell her
the entire collection. The Egyp
tian material was Mrs. Stanford's
share of that recovered by (he
Egyptian Exploration Fund, to
which she was a contributor.
Stanford Museum was (he first
reinforced concrete building in
America. The cement mixer was
invented expressly for the con
struction of it, La Plante said.
190(v Earthquake
The 1906 earthquake destroyed
two of the four wings of (he build
ing, and many exhibits were lost
or damaged. All the remaining
items were moved into one of the
other wings, and the other wing
converted into the present anat
omy building.
A favorite exhibit wilh visitors
is the Governor Stanford locomo
(ive. This was the first locomo
tive brought to California, and il
had to be shipped around Cape
Horn. At (hat time Governor
Stanford was president of the
Central Pacific Railroad, so the
engine bears his name.
In order to get the massive loco
motive into the Museum, a large
hole had to be knocked in one
wall, and tracks and a trestle built
out from the Palo Alto station.
Gold Spike
Another item that attracts much
attention is the original gold spike
driven by Governor Stanford in
1869 at the completion of the first
transcontinental railroad. Th is
was moved to the Museum in 1954
from the Wells Fargo Bank in
San Francisco.
The original collection from all
over the world gathered by Le
land Stanford Jr. before his death
is displayed in a special room. He
collected the items with the inten
tion of presenting a museum to
the city of San Francisco.
The Stanford Family Room
gives students an opportunity to
learn more about their school's
founders. Portraits of (he family,
clothes Mrs. Stanford wore on
state occasions and many person
al items of the family are dis
played here.
Three Divisions
The three main divisions of ex
hibits are archaeology, anthropol
ogy and art. Universi(y professors
are curators for these depart
ments.
Many articles would be of spe
cial interest to students in His
tory of Western Civilization class
es, because they can see the ac
tual objects that were made and
used by the peoples they study.
A few examples of these are
the sarcophagus and the mummy
from Egypt, the collection of
skulls showing man's early devel
opment, Persian armor and weap
ons, and examples of Greek art.
Dr. Ray Nelson Faulkner is the
director of the Museum.
