# Indian Harriers Host Cal, UCLA, San Jose Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford goes for victory over
three in v a d in g cross-country
squads tomorrow at 10 a.m. when
California, UCLA and San Jose
State challenge the Indians on the
Stanford Golf Club cotirse. The
race starts and finishes at the
second lee.
This year's edition of Ihe Card
harriers, rated by coach Paylon
Jordan as "the best physically
and mentally prepared team I've
had here," will bank on balance
and depth to overcome the other
three teams.
Seven Good Indians
The Indians will have seven
men running for them, with any
of the seven capable of beating
the other six. Last week at Cal,
Doug Martin was the first Card
to finish, so might be given a
slight edge over his teammates

tomorrow.
Canadian Norman Lloyd, who
looked sharp in a three-mile work
out earlier this week, will run for
the first time this year and is the
dark horse.
Two Frosh
A pair of freshmen, Keith Wal
lace and Larry Suel/.le, \vill also
be at the starting line tor the In
dians. Wallace was among Cali
l'ornia's best prep milers last year
and ran well against Cal and USC
last week. Suel/.le is in only his
second year of running, but has
shown tremendous progress.
The other Tribe starters will be
Bob Monzingo, Maury Graves and
Bob McGuire the latter now
fully recovered from his bout with
influenza.
Monzingo, only a sophomore,
was a main cog in the 1956 cross

country squad, and has already ,
shown plcnly of improvement |
over his season-ending marks of
last year.
Graves, also, appears headed j
for a much better season than he j
enjoyed last fall, when he was i
in 1 rouble in many of his races.
McGuire, a transfer from Mt.
SAC, may well be the number j
one man by season's end.
Cai Tougher
Cal'should be lougher than last
week, since Iho over-all team's
health report has improved. They
may also have Don I'iowden run
ning for them this lime, after his
Memorial Stadium job interfered
with the meet last week.
The Uclans are led by Boh Sea
man and have good second-line
strength from his brother John.
Bob, however, has be c n upset
twice this year and might be push
ed far back by the well-balanced
Indian crew.
San Jose Puzzles
San Jose, the fourth team in the
race, is a virtually unknown quan
tity this year.
Last year, Ihe Spartans tied
Ihe Indians in the year's first
meet, and have consistently had
fairly good teams. Thus, they arc
expected to put up a relatively
strong showing just on the basis
of their normal showing.
A second race lor second-team
men will follow the main event.
