Speaking to the lIR at Bow

sul general at San Francisco,
gave a detailed view of "The
World Crisis in Europe in Per
spective."
Luc's talk, a part of the llR's
United Nations 'Day program,
dealt with the crisis which de
veloped in Europe at the time of
the Hungarian and Middle East
ern conflicts in the autumn of
1956.
"The Communist world has re
covered to a certain extent from
Ihe Hungarian situation," stated
Luc. "The Soviet earth satellite,
Sputnik, has enhanced the Rus
sian position in the eyes of the
uncommitted countries of the
world."
In discussing the results of the
Middle Eastern crisis, the consul
general said, "I can't say that
common leadership in the West
has been restored to what it
should be. . . . The Allies have
tended to forget their common
bonds."
Luc expressed concern over
the West's approach to the under
developed continents, Africa and
Asia . "The major fact is that the
needs of those underdeveloped
countries can only be met if the
Allies muster all of their re
sources," he stated.
In concluding, Luc said, "If
there is disunity in the West and
between the West and the under
developed countries, then the
whole thing will end in a catas
trophe. We are in the same boat.
We must all unite, not only to
meet the Communist threat but
also to meet the social and eco
nomic demands of the underde
veloped countries."
