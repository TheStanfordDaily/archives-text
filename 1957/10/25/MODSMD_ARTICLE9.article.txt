# 'Tiger' Captivates Crowd
## 
### Camille Petersen 
Once again a Stanford Players
audience left Memorial Auditori
um with stinging hands and smil
ing faces.
David Cathcart and the Players
season opened more than success
fully witli Jean Giraudoux's "Ti
ger at the Gates" last night. Spe
cial applause should go to set de
signer Richard Hay and costume
designer Irene Griffin for out
standing work.
The play is directed by Robert
Loper. Enough said.
Excellent performances in lead
ing roles are given by Cathcart,
as the staunch Hector; Betsy
Flint, as his sister Cassandra; and
William Davis as Paris, whose
carrying off of the Greek queen.
Helen, sets off the Trojan War.
Shirley Douglas develops a con
vincing Andromache during the
first act. And Helen is adequately
done by Penelope Young.
The sets are strong through
their simplicity. They are done in
warm orange-brown and yellow
green. This is Hay's first year
with tho Players, though he work
ed with Loper the past summer

at the Oregon Shakespearean Fes
tival.
Laughs aplenty greet the lines
given so convincingly by Hugh
Evans as Dmekos, the poet and
senator; Phil Angeloff as Ajax,
and Bob Lehrer as the mathema
tician.
Ulysses, the famous warrior, is
well portrayed by Stan Throne
berry. After being so logical dur
ing his Lalk with Hector, at the
end of which he agrees to try to
prevent the war, he turns with a
natural gesture and attributes it
all to the fact that Hector's wife's
eyelashes reminded him of Pene
lope's. "Tis done most naturally.
Joan Hays and Jim Freiburger
play the roles of Hecuba and Pri
am, mother and father of Hector,
Cassandra, Paris, Troilus and Po
lyxene.
An interesting touch is added
at the entrance of Iris (Carolyn
French), a messenger of the vari
ous gods of the Greeks and Tro
jans. She is lowered in the midst
of a cloud to deliver the contra
dicting rulings of the gods.
"Tiger at the Gates" will con
tinue through tomorrow night.
Curtain is at 8:30. Tickets may be
obtained at the box office.
