# CAROS AT BEST IN 20-6 UCLA VICTORY
## Defense Holds Baby Blue To 179 Net Yards Triumph Marks First Win Against Smogville Team in Last Four Years 
### Steve Baffrey 
Stanford's nol-to-be-outdonc Indians wrote a much more enjoyable
chapter into the history of the Injun-UCLA Bruins series on Satin
day when they dumped the southland visitors 20-6 before some 18,000
fans in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor's Indians played their best game of the sea-

son in turning back Rori Sanders'
Bruins, and proved from the open
ing kickoff I hat they weren't go
ing to be bettered.
One of the best examples of the
Stanford spirit came in the open
ing minutes of tho game when the
Cards kept the wolves from I In
door with a crowd-pleasing goal
line stand that made them look
like a brick wall.
Quick Kick
A 62-yard quick kick from the
toe of Bruin Kirk Wilson roller!
dead on the Stanford 1-yard line.
In trying to get. away from the
shadow of the goal, fullback
Chuck Shea fumbled on the first
play, UCLA's wingback Ray
Smith recovering.
With four plays to make 7
yards, the Bruins got their first
dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
own 5 and proceeded to move the
oval out of danger.
Victory over the Bruins was
really a team triumph for the
local eleven, with every member
of the Taylor squad contributing
something special to the win.
Picking out standouts for the 20-6
turnback is a hard job.
Alert Line
A hard-charging, alert Stanford
line led by John Thomas, Troy
Barbee, Don Manoukian and co
captain Gary Van Galder, to name
but just a few, kept the smogmen
on their toes (and other places,
too!) trying to please the 5,000-
student contingent that journeyed
north for the tussle.
An excellent job of defending
the otherwise tricky and potent
UCLA backs held the Sanders out
fit to just 179 net yards on the
ground in 51 plays. The Bruins
were gaining only around end,
and even there not enough to do
any damage.
Offensive honors go to Stan
ford's amazing quarterback Jack
Douglas. The field captain called
an almost perfect game, banging
away at the Gold and Baby Blue
with an offensive barrage that
would have been hard to slop
under any circumstances by any
team.
Couldn't Stop Him
Even the Bruins admitted they
couldn't do anything to his roll
out option plays with which he
did so much damage. He was at

held UCLA to 179 net yards in 51 plays. (7) End Joel I're is makes

his best above ground, completing
]() out of 12 passes- -two of them
for touchdowns —and netting 128
yards this way.
On the ground Douglas himself
garnered the highest running av
erage for the day—3s yards in six
carries for a 5.9 mark.
But it was Chuck Shea who
really carried the ground-attack
load for the Cards. In his 21 car
ries he bowled for 86 yards and
marked up 4.1 pins a carry as an
average.
Freis Stars, Too
Second only to Douglas for high
local praise is end Joel Freis, into
whose hands two of the Indian
touchdown hurls fell. The first
of these came on a play originat
ing on the Uclan 36 and was actu
ally about a 47-yard flip. The 180-
pound end from Los Angeles got
away from Bruin tailback Don
Long, and the score was all his.
Freis was the connection man
on the Cards' final tally of the
flay. After marching to the Bruin
1. Douglas seni Rick McMillen
over the tackle slot for no gain
and then found Freis clear in the
end zone on the next play.
While Stanford end Freis had
one of his best days, Bruin pass
catcher Dick Wallen was having
his worst. The Cards kept Wallen
out of the statistics Saturday, and
Injun Jackie Douglas had to steal
one away from hirn to do it.
A Bad Day
Statistics-wise, it was a bad day
for most of the Bruins. Their of
fensive leader Chuck Kendall was
the only one who could have kept
up his average; he gained 6(5
yards in 10 plays.
Tailback Long, figured 1o be a
running star, gained 54 yards but
got dumped for 24, so nelted only
an unhandsome 30. Other tailback
Wilson turned in 34 yards for the
afternoon.
Perhaps the Bruins won't be
noted for their passing ability
since Saturday's hassle. Only four
of 15 passes landed as planned.
Wilson completed two of these in
10 tries, Long two of four, and
Kendall couldn't find anybody on
his lone attempt.
Six Fumbles
Six times the ball was fumbled
in the game—and six times the
ball changed hands because of the
bobble. The Indians ended up on
the long side of the score of un
easy moments, 4 to 2.
It was a Shea fumble that led
to the great brick-wall stand in
the first stanza, and a Harrington
fumble that stopped the Indians

on the UCLA 16 after the Cards
had consumed most of the quarter
driving there from their own 5.
Late in ihe second period, im
part from Card end Dick Stein
caused Bruin tailback Kendall to
fumble, and again the ball went
to Stanford. But the Indians could
go nowhere on the next three
plays and were forced to hand
over 1o the Uclans on a punt.
To No Avail
After Ihe Bruins drove to the
Indian S-yard line minutes into
the third phase, Harrington recov
ered a Long fumble on his own 9.
Shea, on Ihe next play, dropped
the oval after plowing through
ihe Bruin line for 3, tackle Bill
Leek;: recovering.
This set Ihe visitors on the way
to their first and only score. Three
plays later they had chalked up
iheir six-pointer on a Long-Pars
low aerial from the S. Don Dun
can's try for ihe point after was
blocked by Van Galder.
In the finale the Uclans were
trying desperately to add at least
one more score to their sickly 6-
pointer. After a Wilson pass on a
fourth-and-11 silualion fell incom
plete,' il looked lik'» ihe Taylormen
would be able to run out Ihe clock,
but fullback Jim Byrer couldn't
hold, and Duncan recovered on
the Stanford 49.
But it was all for naught so fai
ns the Bruins were concerned; the
Card defense held on as ti'ghl as
il had all through ihe game, and
there just wasn't any time.
Although he fumbled twice,
Shea looked good, driving into Ihe
Bruin line hard enough 1o gain
yardage by momentum if nothing
else. And il was ihe 191-poynder
who scored the first Indian TD
after charging through the Gold
and Blue for 4.
P.A.T. Problem
For Cardinal fans watching Ihe
once-a-problem P.A.T., more good
news was in the air. Harrington,
dubbed "The Boy wilh Ihe Golden
Toe" after his Washington exhi
bition a week ago, split ihe up
rights on Ihe first two tries, even
though the first was close.
When the Injuns scored for the
third lime in the fourth quarter,
Harrington was on the bench. He
immediately sprang to his feet,
seemingly begging to be put in,
but the word from Taylor (the
coach) was 1 hat Taylor (the half
back-quarterback) would do the
kicking.
The latter's kick was wide, and
the score read 20-6 with 11:01 still
to go in ihe game. Not a soul left
the big Injun bowl, but they could
as well have, for Ihe game was
the Cards' and had been when
there was still a full 60 minutes
to £TO.

his best above ground, completing

for touchdowns —and netting 128
yards this way.
On the ground Douglas himself
garnered the highest running av
erage for the day—3s yards in six
carries for a 5.9 mark.
But it was Chuck Shea who
really carried the ground-attack
load for the Cards. In his 21 car
ries he bowled for 86 yards and
marked up 4.1 pins a carry as an
average.
Freis Stars, Too
Second only to Douglas for high
local praise is end Joel Freis, into
whose hands two of the Indian
touchdown hurls fell. The first
of these came on a play originat
ing on the Uclan 36 and was actu
ally about a 47-yard flip. The 180-
pound end from Los Angeles got
away from Bruin tailback Don
Long, and the score was all his.
Freis was the connection man
on the Cards' final tally of the
flay. After marching to the Bruin
1. Douglas seni Rick McMillen
over the tackle slot for no gain
and then found Freis clear in the
end zone on the next play.
While Stanford end Freis had
one of his best days, Bruin pass
catcher Dick Wallen was having
his worst. The Cards kept Wallen
out of the statistics Saturday, and
Injun Jackie Douglas had to steal
one away from hirn to do it.
A Bad Day
Statistics-wise, it was a bad day
for most of the Bruins. Their of
fensive leader Chuck Kendall was
the only one who could have kept
up his average; he gained 6(5
yards in 10 plays.
Tailback Long, figured 1o be a
running star, gained 54 yards but
got dumped for 24, so nelted only
an unhandsome 30. Other tailback
Wilson turned in 34 yards for the
afternoon.
Perhaps the Bruins won't be
noted for their passing ability
since Saturday's hassle. Only four
of 15 passes landed as planned.
Wilson completed two of these in
10 tries, Long two of four, and
Kendall couldn't find anybody on
his lone attempt.
Six Fumbles
Six times the ball was fumbled
in the game—and six times the
ball changed hands because of the
bobble. The Indians ended up on
the long side of the score of un
easy moments, 4 to 2.
It was a Shea fumble that led
to the great brick-wall stand in
the first stanza, and a Harrington
fumble that stopped the Indians

on the UCLA 16 after the Cards
had consumed most of the quarter
driving there from their own 5.
Late in ihe second period, im
part from Card end Dick Stein
caused Bruin tailback Kendall to
fumble, and again the ball went
to Stanford. But the Indians could
go nowhere on the next three
plays and were forced to hand
over 1o the Uclans on a punt.
To No Avail
After Ihe Bruins drove to the
Indian S-yard line minutes into
the third phase, Harrington recov
ered a Long fumble on his own 9.
Shea, on Ihe next play, dropped
the oval after plowing through
ihe Bruin line for 3, tackle Bill
Leek;: recovering.
This set Ihe visitors on the way
to their first and only score. Three
plays later they had chalked up
iheir six-pointer on a Long-Pars
low aerial from the S. Don Dun
can's try for ihe point after was
blocked by Van Galder.
In the finale the Uclans were
trying desperately to add at least
one more score to their sickly 6-
pointer. After a Wilson pass on a
fourth-and-11 silualion fell incom
plete,' il looked lik'» ihe Taylormen
would be able to run out Ihe clock,
but fullback Jim Byrer couldn't
hold, and Duncan recovered on
the Stanford 49.
But it was all for naught so fai
ns the Bruins were concerned; the
Card defense held on as ti'ghl as
il had all through ihe game, and
there just wasn't any time.
Although he fumbled twice,
Shea looked good, driving into Ihe
Bruin line hard enough 1o gain
yardage by momentum if nothing
else. And il was ihe 191-poynder
who scored the first Indian TD
after charging through the Gold
and Blue for 4.
P.A.T. Problem
For Cardinal fans watching Ihe
once-a-problem P.A.T., more good
news was in the air. Harrington,
dubbed "The Boy wilh Ihe Golden
Toe" after his Washington exhi
bition a week ago, split ihe up
rights on Ihe first two tries, even
though the first was close.
When the Injuns scored for the
third lime in the fourth quarter,
Harrington was on the bench. He
immediately sprang to his feet,
seemingly begging to be put in,
but the word from Taylor (the
coach) was 1 hat Taylor (the half
back-quarterback) would do the
kicking.
The latter's kick was wide, and
the score read 20-6 with 11:01 still
to go in ihe game. Not a soul left
the big Injun bowl, but they could
as well have, for Ihe game was
the Cards' and had been when
there was still a full 60 minutes
to £TO.

Stanford's nol-to-be-outdonc Indians wrote a much more enjoyable
chapter into the history of the Injun-UCLA Bruins series on Satin
day when they dumped the southland visitors 20-6 before some 18,000
fans in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor's Indians played their best game of the sea-

son in turning back Rori Sanders'
Bruins, and proved from the open
ing kickoff I hat they weren't go
ing to be bettered.
One of the best examples of the
Stanford spirit came in the open
ing minutes of tho game when the
Cards kept the wolves from I In
door with a crowd-pleasing goal
line stand that made them look
like a brick wall.
Quick Kick
A 62-yard quick kick from the
toe of Bruin Kirk Wilson roller!
dead on the Stanford 1-yard line.
In trying to get. away from the
shadow of the goal, fullback
Chuck Shea fumbled on the first
play, UCLA's wingback Ray
Smith recovering.
With four plays to make 7
yards, the Bruins got their first
dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
own 5 and proceeded to move the
oval out of danger.
Victory over the Bruins was
really a team triumph for the
local eleven, with every member
of the Taylor squad contributing
something special to the win.
Picking out standouts for the 20-6
turnback is a hard job.
Alert Line
A hard-charging, alert Stanford
line led by John Thomas, Troy
Barbee, Don Manoukian and co
captain Gary Van Galder, to name
but just a few, kept the smogmen
on their toes (and other places,
too!) trying to please the 5,000-
student contingent that journeyed
north for the tussle.
An excellent job of defending
the otherwise tricky and potent
UCLA backs held the Sanders out
fit to just 179 net yards on the
ground in 51 plays. The Bruins
were gaining only around end,
and even there not enough to do
any damage.
Offensive honors go to Stan
ford's amazing quarterback Jack
Douglas. The field captain called
an almost perfect game, banging
away at the Gold and Baby Blue
with an offensive barrage that
would have been hard to slop
under any circumstances by any
team.
Couldn't Stop Him
Even the Bruins admitted they
couldn't do anything to his roll
out option plays with which he
did so much damage. He was at

for most of the Bruins. Their of
fensive leader Chuck Kendall was
the only one who could have kept
up his average; he gained 6(5
yards in 10 plays.
Tailback Long, figured 1o be a
running star, gained 54 yards but
got dumped for 24, so nelted only
an unhandsome 30. Other tailback
Wilson turned in 34 yards for the
afternoon.
Perhaps the Bruins won't be
noted for their passing ability
since Saturday's hassle. Only four
of 15 passes landed as planned.
Wilson completed two of these in
10 tries, Long two of four, and
Kendall couldn't find anybody on
his lone attempt.
Six Fumbles
Six times the ball was fumbled
in the game—and six times the
ball changed hands because of the
bobble. The Indians ended up on
the long side of the score of un
easy moments, 4 to 2.
It was a Shea fumble that led
to the great brick-wall stand in
the first stanza, and a Harrington
fumble that stopped the Indians

on the UCLA 16 after the Cards
had consumed most of the quarter
driving there from their own 5.
Late in ihe second period, im
part from Card end Dick Stein
caused Bruin tailback Kendall to
fumble, and again the ball went
to Stanford. But the Indians could
go nowhere on the next three
plays and were forced to hand
over 1o the Uclans on a punt.
To No Avail
After Ihe Bruins drove to the
Indian S-yard line minutes into
the third phase, Harrington recov
ered a Long fumble on his own 9.
Shea, on Ihe next play, dropped
the oval after plowing through
ihe Bruin line for 3, tackle Bill
Leek;: recovering.
This set Ihe visitors on the way
to their first and only score. Three
plays later they had chalked up
iheir six-pointer on a Long-Pars
low aerial from the S. Don Dun
can's try for ihe point after was
blocked by Van Galder.
In the finale the Uclans were
trying desperately to add at least
one more score to their sickly 6-
pointer. After a Wilson pass on a
fourth-and-11 silualion fell incom
plete,' il looked lik'» ihe Taylormen
would be able to run out Ihe clock,
but fullback Jim Byrer couldn't
hold, and Duncan recovered on
the Stanford 49.
But it was all for naught so fai
ns the Bruins were concerned; the
Card defense held on as ti'ghl as
il had all through ihe game, and
there just wasn't any time.
Although he fumbled twice,
Shea looked good, driving into Ihe
Bruin line hard enough 1o gain
yardage by momentum if nothing
else. And il was ihe 191-poynder
who scored the first Indian TD
after charging through the Gold
and Blue for 4.
P.A.T. Problem
For Cardinal fans watching Ihe
once-a-problem P.A.T., more good
news was in the air. Harrington,
dubbed "The Boy wilh Ihe Golden
Toe" after his Washington exhi
bition a week ago, split ihe up
rights on Ihe first two tries, even
though the first was close.
When the Injuns scored for the
third lime in the fourth quarter,
Harrington was on the bench. He
immediately sprang to his feet,
seemingly begging to be put in,
but the word from Taylor (the
coach) was 1 hat Taylor (the half
back-quarterback) would do the
kicking.
The latter's kick was wide, and
the score read 20-6 with 11:01 still
to go in ihe game. Not a soul left
the big Injun bowl, but they could
as well have, for Ihe game was
the Cards' and had been when
there was still a full 60 minutes
to £TO.

Stanford's nol-to-be-outdonc Indians wrote a much more enjoyable
chapter into the history of the Injun-UCLA Bruins series on Satin
day when they dumped the southland visitors 20-6 before some 18,000
fans in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor's Indians played their best game of the sea-

son in turning back Rori Sanders'
Bruins, and proved from the open
ing kickoff I hat they weren't go
ing to be bettered.
One of the best examples of the
Stanford spirit came in the open
ing minutes of tho game when the
Cards kept the wolves from I In
door with a crowd-pleasing goal
line stand that made them look
like a brick wall.
Quick Kick
A 62-yard quick kick from the
toe of Bruin Kirk Wilson roller!
dead on the Stanford 1-yard line.
In trying to get. away from the
shadow of the goal, fullback
Chuck Shea fumbled on the first
play, UCLA's wingback Ray
Smith recovering.
With four plays to make 7
yards, the Bruins got their first
dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
own 5 and proceeded to move the
oval out of danger.
Victory over the Bruins was
really a team triumph for the
local eleven, with every member
of the Taylor squad contributing
something special to the win.
Picking out standouts for the 20-6
turnback is a hard job.
Alert Line
A hard-charging, alert Stanford
line led by John Thomas, Troy
Barbee, Don Manoukian and co
captain Gary Van Galder, to name
but just a few, kept the smogmen
on their toes (and other places,
too!) trying to please the 5,000-
student contingent that journeyed
north for the tussle.
An excellent job of defending
the otherwise tricky and potent
UCLA backs held the Sanders out
fit to just 179 net yards on the
ground in 51 plays. The Bruins
were gaining only around end,
and even there not enough to do
any damage.
Offensive honors go to Stan
ford's amazing quarterback Jack
Douglas. The field captain called
an almost perfect game, banging
away at the Gold and Baby Blue
with an offensive barrage that
would have been hard to slop
under any circumstances by any
team.
Couldn't Stop Him
Even the Bruins admitted they
couldn't do anything to his roll
out option plays with which he
did so much damage. He was at

his best above ground, completing
]() out of 12 passes- -two of them
for touchdowns —and netting 128
yards this way.
On the ground Douglas himself
garnered the highest running av
erage for the day—3s yards in six
carries for a 5.9 mark.
But it was Chuck Shea who
really carried the ground-attack
load for the Cards. In his 21 car
ries he bowled for 86 yards and
marked up 4.1 pins a carry as an
average.
Freis Stars, Too
Second only to Douglas for high
local praise is end Joel Freis, into
whose hands two of the Indian
touchdown hurls fell. The first
of these came on a play originat
ing on the Uclan 36 and was actu
ally about a 47-yard flip. The 180-
pound end from Los Angeles got
away from Bruin tailback Don
Long, and the score was all his.
Freis was the connection man
on the Cards' final tally of the
flay. After marching to the Bruin
1. Douglas seni Rick McMillen
over the tackle slot for no gain
and then found Freis clear in the
end zone on the next play.
While Stanford end Freis had
one of his best days, Bruin pass
catcher Dick Wallen was having
his worst. The Cards kept Wallen
out of the statistics Saturday, and
Injun Jackie Douglas had to steal
one away from hirn to do it.

Bruin line hard enough 1o gain
yardage by momentum if nothing
else. And il was ihe 191-poynder
who scored the first Indian TD
after charging through the Gold
and Blue for 4.
P.A.T. Problem
For Cardinal fans watching Ihe
once-a-problem P.A.T., more good
news was in the air. Harrington,
dubbed "The Boy wilh Ihe Golden
Toe" after his Washington exhi
bition a week ago, split ihe up
rights on Ihe first two tries, even
though the first was close.
When the Injuns scored for the
third lime in the fourth quarter,
Harrington was on the bench. He
immediately sprang to his feet,
seemingly begging to be put in,
but the word from Taylor (the
coach) was 1 hat Taylor (the half
back-quarterback) would do the
kicking.
The latter's kick was wide, and
the score read 20-6 with 11:01 still
to go in ihe game. Not a soul left
the big Injun bowl, but they could
as well have, for Ihe game was
the Cards' and had been when
there was still a full 60 minutes
to £TO.

Stanford's nol-to-be-outdonc Indians wrote a much more enjoyable
chapter into the history of the Injun-UCLA Bruins series on Satin
day when they dumped the southland visitors 20-6 before some 18,000
fans in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor's Indians played their best game of the sea-

son in turning back Rori Sanders'
Bruins, and proved from the open
ing kickoff I hat they weren't go
ing to be bettered.
One of the best examples of the
Stanford spirit came in the open
ing minutes of tho game when the
Cards kept the wolves from I In
door with a crowd-pleasing goal
line stand that made them look
like a brick wall.
Quick Kick
A 62-yard quick kick from the
toe of Bruin Kirk Wilson roller!
dead on the Stanford 1-yard line.
In trying to get. away from the
shadow of the goal, fullback
Chuck Shea fumbled on the first
play, UCLA's wingback Ray
Smith recovering.
With four plays to make 7
yards, the Bruins got their first
dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
own 5 and proceeded to move the
oval out of danger.
Victory over the Bruins was
really a team triumph for the
local eleven, with every member
of the Taylor squad contributing
something special to the win.
Picking out standouts for the 20-6
turnback is a hard job.
Alert Line
A hard-charging, alert Stanford
line led by John Thomas, Troy
Barbee, Don Manoukian and co
captain Gary Van Galder, to name
but just a few, kept the smogmen
on their toes (and other places,
too!) trying to please the 5,000-
student contingent that journeyed
north for the tussle.
An excellent job of defending
the otherwise tricky and potent
UCLA backs held the Sanders out
fit to just 179 net yards on the
ground in 51 plays. The Bruins
were gaining only around end,
and even there not enough to do
any damage.
Offensive honors go to Stan
ford's amazing quarterback Jack
Douglas. The field captain called
an almost perfect game, banging
away at the Gold and Baby Blue
with an offensive barrage that
would have been hard to slop
under any circumstances by any
team.
Couldn't Stop Him
Even the Bruins admitted they
couldn't do anything to his roll
out option plays with which he
did so much damage. He was at

his best above ground, completing
]() out of 12 passes- -two of them
for touchdowns —and netting 128
yards this way.
On the ground Douglas himself
garnered the highest running av
erage for the day—3s yards in six
carries for a 5.9 mark.
But it was Chuck Shea who
really carried the ground-attack
load for the Cards. In his 21 car
ries he bowled for 86 yards and
marked up 4.1 pins a carry as an
average.
Freis Stars, Too
Second only to Douglas for high
local praise is end Joel Freis, into
whose hands two of the Indian
touchdown hurls fell. The first
of these came on a play originat
ing on the Uclan 36 and was actu
ally about a 47-yard flip. The 180-
pound end from Los Angeles got
away from Bruin tailback Don
Long, and the score was all his.
Freis was the connection man
on the Cards' final tally of the
flay. After marching to the Bruin
1. Douglas seni Rick McMillen
over the tackle slot for no gain
and then found Freis clear in the
end zone on the next play.
While Stanford end Freis had
one of his best days, Bruin pass
catcher Dick Wallen was having
his worst. The Cards kept Wallen
out of the statistics Saturday, and
Injun Jackie Douglas had to steal
one away from hirn to do it.
A Bad Day
Statistics-wise, it was a bad day
for most of the Bruins. Their of
fensive leader Chuck Kendall was
the only one who could have kept
up his average; he gained 6(5
yards in 10 plays.
Tailback Long, figured 1o be a
running star, gained 54 yards but
got dumped for 24, so nelted only
an unhandsome 30. Other tailback
Wilson turned in 34 yards for the
afternoon.
Perhaps the Bruins won't be
noted for their passing ability
since Saturday's hassle. Only four
of 15 passes landed as planned.
Wilson completed two of these in
10 tries, Long two of four, and
Kendall couldn't find anybody on
his lone attempt.
Six Fumbles
Six times the ball was fumbled
in the game—and six times the
ball changed hands because of the
bobble. The Indians ended up on
the long side of the score of un
easy moments, 4 to 2.
It was a Shea fumble that led
to the great brick-wall stand in
the first stanza, and a Harrington
fumble that stopped the Indians

on the UCLA 16 after the Cards
had consumed most of the quarter
driving there from their own 5.
Late in ihe second period, im
part from Card end Dick Stein
caused Bruin tailback Kendall to
fumble, and again the ball went
to Stanford. But the Indians could
go nowhere on the next three
plays and were forced to hand
over 1o the Uclans on a punt.
To No Avail
After Ihe Bruins drove to the
Indian S-yard line minutes into
the third phase, Harrington recov
ered a Long fumble on his own 9.
Shea, on Ihe next play, dropped
the oval after plowing through
ihe Bruin line for 3, tackle Bill
Leek;: recovering.
This set Ihe visitors on the way
to their first and only score. Three
plays later they had chalked up
iheir six-pointer on a Long-Pars
low aerial from the S. Don Dun
can's try for ihe point after was
blocked by Van Galder.
In the finale the Uclans were
trying desperately to add at least
one more score to their sickly 6-
pointer. After a Wilson pass on a
fourth-and-11 silualion fell incom
plete,' il looked lik'» ihe Taylormen
would be able to run out Ihe clock,
but fullback Jim Byrer couldn't
hold, and Duncan recovered on
the Stanford 49.
But it was all for naught so fai
ns the Bruins were concerned; the
Card defense held on as ti'ghl as
il had all through ihe game, and
there just wasn't any time.
Although he fumbled twice,
Shea looked good, driving into Ihe
Bruin line hard enough 1o gain
yardage by momentum if nothing

dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
own 5 and proceeded to move the
oval out of danger.
Victory over the Bruins was
really a team triumph for the
local eleven, with every member
of the Taylor squad contributing
something special to the win.
Picking out standouts for the 20-6
turnback is a hard job.
Alert Line
A hard-charging, alert Stanford
line led by John Thomas, Troy
Barbee, Don Manoukian and co
captain Gary Van Galder, to name
but just a few, kept the smogmen
on their toes (and other places,
too!) trying to please the 5,000-
student contingent that journeyed
north for the tussle.
An excellent job of defending
the otherwise tricky and potent
UCLA backs held the Sanders out
fit to just 179 net yards on the
ground in 51 plays. The Bruins
were gaining only around end,
and even there not enough to do
any damage.
Offensive honors go to Stan
ford's amazing quarterback Jack
Douglas. The field captain called
an almost perfect game, banging
away at the Gold and Baby Blue
with an offensive barrage that
would have been hard to slop
under any circumstances by any
team.
Couldn't Stop Him
Even the Bruins admitted they
couldn't do anything to his roll
out option plays with which he
did so much damage. He was at

his best above ground, completing
]() out of 12 passes- -two of them
for touchdowns —and netting 128
yards this way.
On the ground Douglas himself
garnered the highest running av
erage for the day—3s yards in six
carries for a 5.9 mark.
But it was Chuck Shea who
really carried the ground-attack
load for the Cards. In his 21 car
ries he bowled for 86 yards and
marked up 4.1 pins a carry as an
average.
Freis Stars, Too
Second only to Douglas for high
local praise is end Joel Freis, into
whose hands two of the Indian
touchdown hurls fell. The first
of these came on a play originat
ing on the Uclan 36 and was actu
ally about a 47-yard flip. The 180-
pound end from Los Angeles got
away from Bruin tailback Don
Long, and the score was all his.
Freis was the connection man
on the Cards' final tally of the
flay. After marching to the Bruin
1. Douglas seni Rick McMillen
over the tackle slot for no gain
and then found Freis clear in the
end zone on the next play.
While Stanford end Freis had
one of his best days, Bruin pass
catcher Dick Wallen was having
his worst. The Cards kept Wallen
out of the statistics Saturday, and
Injun Jackie Douglas had to steal
one away from hirn to do it.
A Bad Day
Statistics-wise, it was a bad day
for most of the Bruins. Their of
fensive leader Chuck Kendall was
the only one who could have kept
up his average; he gained 6(5
yards in 10 plays.
Tailback Long, figured 1o be a
running star, gained 54 yards but
got dumped for 24, so nelted only
an unhandsome 30. Other tailback
Wilson turned in 34 yards for the
afternoon.
Perhaps the Bruins won't be
noted for their passing ability
since Saturday's hassle. Only four
of 15 passes landed as planned.
Wilson completed two of these in
10 tries, Long two of four, and
Kendall couldn't find anybody on
his lone attempt.
Six Fumbles
Six times the ball was fumbled
in the game—and six times the
ball changed hands because of the
bobble. The Indians ended up on
the long side of the score of un
easy moments, 4 to 2.
It was a Shea fumble that led
to the great brick-wall stand in
the first stanza, and a Harrington
fumble that stopped the Indians

on the UCLA 16 after the Cards
had consumed most of the quarter
driving there from their own 5.
Late in ihe second period, im
part from Card end Dick Stein
caused Bruin tailback Kendall to
fumble, and again the ball went
to Stanford. But the Indians could
go nowhere on the next three
plays and were forced to hand
over 1o the Uclans on a punt.
To No Avail
After Ihe Bruins drove to the
Indian S-yard line minutes into
the third phase, Harrington recov
ered a Long fumble on his own 9.
Shea, on Ihe next play, dropped
the oval after plowing through
ihe Bruin line for 3, tackle Bill
Leek;: recovering.
This set Ihe visitors on the way
to their first and only score. Three
plays later they had chalked up
iheir six-pointer on a Long-Pars
low aerial from the S. Don Dun
can's try for ihe point after was
blocked by Van Galder.
In the finale the Uclans were
trying desperately to add at least
one more score to their sickly 6-
pointer. After a Wilson pass on a
fourth-and-11 silualion fell incom
plete,' il looked lik'» ihe Taylormen
would be able to run out Ihe clock,
but fullback Jim Byrer couldn't
hold, and Duncan recovered on
the Stanford 49.
But it was all for naught so fai
ns the Bruins were concerned; the
Card defense held on as ti'ghl as
il had all through ihe game, and
there just wasn't any time.
Although he fumbled twice,
Shea looked good, driving into Ihe
Bruin line hard enough 1o gain
yardage by momentum if nothing
else. And il was ihe 191-poynder
who scored the first Indian TD
after charging through the Gold
and Blue for 4.
P.A.T. Problem
For Cardinal fans watching Ihe
once-a-problem P.A.T., more good
news was in the air. Harrington,
dubbed "The Boy wilh Ihe Golden
Toe" after his Washington exhi
bition a week ago, split ihe up
rights on Ihe first two tries, even
though the first was close.
When the Injuns scored for the
third lime in the fourth quarter,
Harrington was on the bench. He
immediately sprang to his feet,
seemingly begging to be put in,
but the word from Taylor (the
coach) was 1 hat Taylor (the half
back-quarterback) would do the
kicking.
The latter's kick was wide, and
the score read 20-6 with 11:01 still
to go in ihe game. Not a soul left
the big Injun bowl, but they could
as well have, for Ihe game was
the Cards' and had been when
there was still a full 60 minutes
to £TO.

Stanford's nol-to-be-outdonc Indians wrote a much more enjoyable
chapter into the history of the Injun-UCLA Bruins series on Satin
day when they dumped the southland visitors 20-6 before some 18,000
fans in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor's Indians played their best game of the sea-

son in turning back Rori Sanders'
Bruins, and proved from the open
ing kickoff I hat they weren't go
ing to be bettered.
One of the best examples of the
Stanford spirit came in the open
ing minutes of tho game when the
Cards kept the wolves from I In
door with a crowd-pleasing goal
line stand that made them look
like a brick wall.
Quick Kick
A 62-yard quick kick from the
toe of Bruin Kirk Wilson roller!
dead on the Stanford 1-yard line.
In trying to get. away from the
shadow of the goal, fullback
Chuck Shea fumbled on the first
play, UCLA's wingback Ray
Smith recovering.
With four plays to make 7
yards, the Bruins got their first
dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
