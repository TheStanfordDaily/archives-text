# CAROS AT BEST IN 20-6 UCLA VICTORY
## Defense Holds Baby Blue To 179 Net Yards Triumph Marks First Win Against Smogville Team in Last Four Years

Stanford's nol-to-be-outdonc Indians wrote a much more enjoyable
chapter into the history of the Injun-UCLA Bruins series on Satin
day when they dumped the southland visitors 20-6 before some 18,000
fans in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Chuck Taylor's Indians played their best game of the sea-

son in turning back Rori Sanders'
Bruins, and proved from the open
ing kickoff I hat they weren't go
ing to be bettered.
One of the best examples of the
Stanford spirit came in the open
ing minutes of tho game when the
Cards kept the wolves from I In
door with a crowd-pleasing goal
line stand that made them look
like a brick wall.
Quick Kick
A 62-yard quick kick from the
toe of Bruin Kirk Wilson roller!
dead on the Stanford 1-yard line.
In trying to get. away from the
shadow of the goal, fullback
Chuck Shea fumbled on the first
play, UCLA's wingback Ray
Smith recovering.
With four plays to make 7
yards, the Bruins got their first
dose of frustration when Wilson's
fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete,
and the Indians took over on their
own 5 and proceeded to move the
oval out of danger.
Victory over the Bruins was
really a team triumph for the
local eleven, with every member
of the Taylor squad contributing
something special to the win.
Picking out standouts for the 20-6
turnback is a hard job.
Alert Line
A hard-charging, alert Stanford
line led by John Thomas, Troy
Barbee, Don Manoukian and co
captain Gary Van Galder, to name
but just a few, kept the smogmen
on their toes (and other places,
too!) trying to please the 5,000-
student contingent that journeyed
north for the tussle.
An excellent job of defending
the otherwise tricky and potent
UCLA backs held the Sanders out
fit to just 179 net yards on the
ground in 51 plays. The Bruins
were gaining only around end,
and even there not enough to do
any damage.
Offensive honors go to Stan
ford's amazing quarterback Jack
Douglas. The field captain called
an almost perfect game, banging
away at the Gold and Baby Blue
with an offensive barrage that
would have been hard to slop
under any circumstances by any
team.
Couldn't Stop Him
Even the Bruins admitted they
couldn't do anything to his roll
out option plays with which he
did so much damage. He was at


"BEAT Till: BABY BLUE"—(1) Jcri McMillin and Rick McMillen
form an unbrotherly combination against UCLA end Glen Aim
quis't tr> knock down a Bruin pass. The Card pass defense held
the visitors to four completions in 15 attempts. (2) Chuck Shea
bursts into the end zone for Stanford's first, score in the first
quarter, (3) Stanford Band forms its giant balloon as part of the
halftime performance on the theme of "Around the World in HO
Days." (4) The expanding "S" is formed by the card section in

the big Cinemascope section. (5) Jeri MeMillin tackles Bniin
tailback Kirk Wilson late in the fourth period. Besides his tackling
MeMillin did a line job defending against. UCLA's famed end Dick
Wallen, allowing him no catches all day. (fi) Wilson gets it again,
this time from Don Manoukian and Ben Robinson, as Card defense
held UCLA to 179 net yards in 51 plays. (7) End Joel I're is makes
picture catch on Bruin five-yard line on way to final TD. Freis
caught, five passes and scored two touchdowns.
