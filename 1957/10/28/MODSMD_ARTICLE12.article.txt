# Turk Elections Half Through; Demos Gaining
## Premier's Party Leads In Parliament Contest Of Pro-West Parties 
### 
ISTANBUL, Monday (/i J ) Pre
mier Adnan Menderes and his
Demorcatic party forged strongly
ahead as returns passed the half
way mark today in Turkey's
tense general election. But they
had a harder fight than in 1954.
The government reported the
Democrats leading in 40 prov
inces with a total of 392 seats in
the new 610-member parliament.
Turkey has 67 provinces in all.
The People's Republicans, led
by elder statesman * Ismet Inonu,
a former president, held the edge
in nine provinces with 90 seats.
Small Opposition
Two minor opposition parties,
the Freedom and the Nation par
ties, led in one province each
with a total of eight seats.
A spokesman for Menderes
said the Democrats are assured
of 340 to 400 seats, with a possi
bility of the Republicans gaining
a surprising 200 seats in the as
sembly.
The Republicans are as thor
oughly pro - Western and anti-
Communist as the present Demo
cratic-controlled government.
Uniformity
All parties in this country back
NATO, distrust Soviet imperial
ism and agree Turkey's future
lies in alliance with the West.
Only in the past three days,
when newspapers have been for
bidden to print political stories,
did the Syrian situation come
strongly on to the front pages
here. Even then, Turkey showed
less anxiety than the rest of the
world about the situation.
Turks say their troops—which
the Syrians claim are poised on
the border for American-backed
aggresion after the election—are
in the border area for defensive
maneuvers. They have ex prosed
doubt the Syrians or the Rus
sians would want to start a war
now.
War Not Issue
Thus, the big issues in Turkey
were not war or peace but short
ages of goods and their prices,
Menderes and his all-out econom
ic development program, and civil
liberties, or lack of them.
The new parliament, which con
venes Nov. 1, will elect a presi
dent for a four-year term. The
president must be an elected
member of parliament. He in
turn will invite another member
to be premier and to form a cabi
net which can receive parlia
ment's approval.
