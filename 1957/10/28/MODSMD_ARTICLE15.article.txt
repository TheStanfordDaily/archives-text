# A 						Memorable Saturday
## 
### 
11 WAS PlillF. jov for those of us who sat in 1110
opposition stands Saturday lo see the high
caliber eard stunts appearing from the Stan
ford rooting section.
Known for its laxity in and its apatliv toward
"putting on a show that the student body can
bo proud of." the rooting section made an
abrupt about-face, and the whole press section
was agreeably surprised.
I'art of this surprise must necessarily he laid
to the fine work done hv Rally Com in organ
izing the enlarged card section and in present
ing the "Around the World" theme with such
brilliantly designed tricks. The committee is
to be congratulated.
But, however well organized, it was really
the cooperation given hv the rooters themselves

that made the showing so successful. And so it
is to the students themselves, the ones who ac
tually manipulated the cards, that we must give
the primary credit for the great half-time ex
it i bit ion.
So long as we are passing out laurels, let us
not forget the way the Stanford band outclassed
UCLA's blue- and gold-clad musicians. The
field performance was up to its usual excellence
in style and design.
But, for all the half-time ceremonies, it is the
game that counts â€”and what a game! Some
times revenge is so sweet. After three years of
humiliating, disappointing and frustrating tie
feats, our inspired team gave us a performance
that UCLA will not easily forget.
So, orchids to all who made Saturday after
noon a memorable occasion.
