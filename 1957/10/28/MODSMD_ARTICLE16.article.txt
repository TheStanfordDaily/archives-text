# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Charles Foster Kane
## Football Speculation Rages 
### 
Well, the smogmen have arrived, been bashed
and have left again for the choking atmosphere

While the football speculation continues to
rage, let's have a look at this week's culture
for after all, we must do something to pass the
hours until Saturday afternoon.
Yes, it's back with us again—that stellar hour
of ripping good fellowship and high scholarly
goals -the School of Mineral Sciences Journal
Club. Today's talk will be by Robert Christian
sen who will discuss "Geologic Reconnaissance
of Pine Nut Mountains of Nevada." Just what
is a Pine Nut Mountain? Come to Room 320 at
p.m. and learn oodles of things about Pine Nut
Mountains. Socratic discourse completed.
As usual, the Department of Biological Sci
ences Seminar has dug up a formidable bit of
competition for the pine nut boys—"Growth
Regulation in Amphibian Eyes During Larval
Development." Tea precedes festivities at 4 p.m.
in Room 430 and don't be surprised if you find
a bloodshot, eye looking up at you out of the
leacup only an amphibian eye developing.
