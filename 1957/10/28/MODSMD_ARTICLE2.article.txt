# Is Nikita To Be Another Stalin?
## Ouster of Zhukov Said to Indicate Khrushchev's Confidence of Power 
### 
From (he Associated Press
The stark announcement of tho removal of Marshal Georgi K.
Zhukov as Soviet defense chief appeared to Westerners in Moscow
yesterday to reflect more than anything else the supreme confidence
of Nikita Khrushchev that he is boss.
Whether popular hero Zhukov is going up or down, his removal

appeared to Westerners to repre
sent the firm conviction that
whatever action Khrushchev
takes thre will be no adverse re
action in the Soviet Union.
Most Western diplomats, after
studying the manner and timing
of the Soviet announcement of
Zhukov's removal, were leaning
toward the view that the Soviet
World War II hero was being
downgraded.
Serious Omission
"The omission from the offi
cial announcement of any indica
tion that the change was made to
permit Zhukov's assignment to
other duties—such as premier or
deputy premier—could have only
one possible effect on the Soviet
public," said one veteran diplo
mat:. "They would read into the
announcement that Zhukov is
out."
It: is possible Zhukov may be
given in the future a high-sound
ing title or position of some sort
—but he apparently has been re
moved from the key spot of con
trol over the armed forces.
Evidence accumulates to indi
cate this represents an effort to
remove the idolized war hero
from the Kremlin power strug
gle.
Two Meanings
Two possible interpretations
can be put on the Kremlin in
fighting involved in the Zhukov
replacement. One is that Khrush
chev himself master-minded the
action in order to eliminate a for
midable rival in his drive to su
preme dictatorial power over
Russia. The second, less probable
but more startling in its possi
bilities, is that Khrushchev's own
position might be involved in the
crisis. So far, however, there has
been no indication that Khrush
chev is in difficulty.
The fact that the replacement
of Zhukov by Marshal Rodion
Malinovsky was decided on while
Zhukov was abroad seems to in
dicate Zhukov was not consulted
and was presented with a fait ac
compli when he returned to Mos
cow Saturday from a tour of Yu
goslavia and Albania.
Conspiracy
It looks as if while Zhukov
was outside the U.S.S.R. tiie Com
munist party leadership and fac
tions in the Soviet high command
which feared Zhukov's prestige
and authority conspired to oust
him.
Khrushchev seemed to be mov
ing swiftly and confidently in
consolidating his position before
the big celebrations on the 40th
anniversary of the revolution
next Thursday.
Communist bigwigs arc coming
to Moscow for the party includ
ing Red China's Mao Tze-tung.
