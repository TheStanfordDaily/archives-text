# AFTER THE GAME
## Taylor Praises Card Defense; Sanders: Indians Were Better 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor Roy Lawson 
The Stanford defense — a de
fense 1ha1 coach Chuck Taylor
was "awfully pleased with" was
Ihe subject of most comments and
compliments in the Indian locker
room Saturday after ihe Cards'
surprisingly decisive 20-0 win over
UCLA.
Taylor said the object of his ]
Tribe was to play as honest a de- j
l'ense as possible, to stop Bruin ;
pass-catching ace Dick Wallen and :
to hope to thus contain the UCLA 1
passing threat.
The net result was "the best- j
ever defensive play we've had j
against UCLA."
But just how did Taylor set up
1ho defense which must go into |
lho books as among the best in
his seven-year coaching reign?
Shifting Line
As the Indians' pleased mentor,
explained it. the Stanford linemen
and line backers kept .shifting
from one hole to another an in
stant before UCLA's play would
begin. "We hoped we would plug
a hole that they thought would
be open," ho said.
So far as covering Wallen was
concerned, ihe Indian defenders
couldn't have done belter. All
they did was keep UCLA's most
feared aerial snagger from grab
bing a single pass, and Jackie
Douglas even picked off a throw
intended for Wallen.
Taylor said the strategy here
was to keep two or three men on
Wallen all the time. A line back
er, Russ Steele or John Thomas,
would drift with him into the
short territory.
Then wingback A1 Harrington
and safety halfback Jeri McMillin
would pick up on Wallen to cover
him on medium and long throws.
1 le was covered!
When asked if Stanford played
its best game of the year, Taylor
1 bought for a bit and then said,
"I'd have to say so.
"If any one thing helped us," he
added, "the block of their P.A.T.
did. It meant that they had driven
all that way to score and still
hadn't caught us."
Held On
The otic thing that pleased Tay
lor most was the fact that the In
dians gave UCLA the early oppor
tunity i fumbling away the ball on
Ihe 7 after Kirk Wilson's quick
kick) and held them.
Taylor started to single out a
few individuals, but wound up by
naming virtually every man who
got into the game. lie noted that
"everybody put out 100 per cent."
Douglas, center of post-game
congratulations, was already ea
gerly looking forward to the Ore
gon game this Saturday. He ex
claimed: "Now we've got a chance
to go! I think we've got the best
team."
Don Manoukian thought it was
Stanford's best effort of the year
and 1 ha 1 the Indians certainly de
served to win. He happily re
marked, "I couldn't say enough."
And neither could anybody else.

Henry (Red) Sanders lit a cig
arette and tried to tell a handful
of reporters why his UCLA Bru
ins had just lost a 20-fi decision to
tho Stanford Indians- their first
loss in four years to the Cardi
nals.
He sat on a low dressing-room
bench and stared at the dressing
room's cement floor for a mo
ment and exhaled a stream of
smoke. "Today, Stanford was Ihe
! better team." he said finally,"and
|"and you can just about let it go
| at that."
A hurriedly - fashioned horse
| shoe arrangement of benches had
been assembled and Sanders sat
at the top end. Had the circum
| stances been different, the stocky
steel-haired man from Westwood
might have passed for a middle-
I aged slotman working at the
; copy desk of a newspaper's edi
j torial room.
Best We Could
"We played the best we could
: under the circumstances," he con
i tinued. Asked what the circum
| stances were, Sanders replied:
| "Physical condition and one that
I won't mention. The flu hurt us
more than we ever said. There
I were not fewer than nine out
with the flu. It hurt us more in
I the line than in the backfield."
Eventually, the line of qucs-
I tioning touched upon the "cir
cumstance" that Sanders said he
wouldn't "mention." Someone
surmised that it concerned the
heavy eligibility losses of seniors
| suffered by UCLA when Pacific
Coast Conference subsidy penal
ties rapped the Bruins hard last
year. Sanders, whose team in
cludes only five seniors, turned
| his head toward tho inquirer and
said tersely, "What do you
think?"
"Incredible" Team
'"It is incredible what we have
| done this year," Sanders said,
however, in returning to the Ue
lans' play. The Bruins have won
four games and lost two this sea
son despite a predominance of
j sophomore and junior players.
Sanders expanded on this point:
"Seventeen of our men played
their first minute of varsity ball
I this year," he said.
Several of the Bruin players
were particularly impressed by
(Stanford quarterback Jackie
Douglas' performance. Tailback
Don Long, who passed to the
| Bruins' only score in the third
[quarter, praised Douglas' call
; that gave the Indians their final
I touchdown in the fourth period.
Right end Joel Freis caught
Douglas' fourth - and - one for a
| touchdown pass at least 1.1 yards
I from the nearest Bruin defender,
j "It was a real good call," Long
said. "We didn't adjust.

Shifting Line
As the Indians' pleased mentor,
explained it. the Stanford linemen
and line backers kept .shifting
from one hole to another an in
stant before UCLA's play would
begin. "We hoped we would plug
a hole that they thought would
be open," ho said.
So far as covering Wallen was
concerned, ihe Indian defenders
couldn't have done belter. All
they did was keep UCLA's most
feared aerial snagger from grab
bing a single pass, and Jackie
Douglas even picked off a throw
intended for Wallen.
Taylor said the strategy here
was to keep two or three men on
Wallen all the time. A line back
er, Russ Steele or John Thomas,
would drift with him into the
short territory.
Then wingback A1 Harrington
and safety halfback Jeri McMillin
would pick up on Wallen to cover
him on medium and long throws.

Henry (Red) Sanders lit a cig
arette and tried to tell a handful
of reporters why his UCLA Bru
ins had just lost a 20-fi decision to
tho Stanford Indians- their first
loss in four years to the Cardi
nals.
He sat on a low dressing-room
bench and stared at the dressing
room's cement floor for a mo
ment and exhaled a stream of
smoke. "Today, Stanford was Ihe
! better team." he said finally,"and
|"and you can just about let it go
| at that."
A hurriedly - fashioned horse
| shoe arrangement of benches had
been assembled and Sanders sat
at the top end. Had the circum
| stances been different, the stocky
steel-haired man from Westwood
might have passed for a middle-
I aged slotman working at the
; copy desk of a newspaper's edi
j torial room.
Best We Could
"We played the best we could
: under the circumstances," he con
i tinued. Asked what the circum
| stances were, Sanders replied:
| "Physical condition and one that
I won't mention. The flu hurt us
more than we ever said. There
I were not fewer than nine out
with the flu. It hurt us more in
I the line than in the backfield."
Eventually, the line of qucs-
I tioning touched upon the "cir
cumstance" that Sanders said he
wouldn't "mention." Someone
surmised that it concerned the
heavy eligibility losses of seniors
| suffered by UCLA when Pacific
Coast Conference subsidy penal
ties rapped the Bruins hard last
year. Sanders, whose team in
cludes only five seniors, turned
| his head toward tho inquirer and
said tersely, "What do you
think?"
"Incredible" Team
'"It is incredible what we have
| done this year," Sanders said,
however, in returning to the Ue
lans' play. The Bruins have won
four games and lost two this sea
son despite a predominance of
j sophomore and junior players.
Sanders expanded on this point:
"Seventeen of our men played
their first minute of varsity ball
I this year," he said.
Several of the Bruin players
were particularly impressed by
(Stanford quarterback Jackie
Douglas' performance. Tailback
Don Long, who passed to the
| Bruins' only score in the third

I touchdown in the fourth period.

The Stanford defense — a de
fense 1ha1 coach Chuck Taylor
was "awfully pleased with" was
Ihe subject of most comments and

room Saturday after ihe Cards'

Taylor said the object of his ]
Tribe was to play as honest a de- j
l'ense as possible, to stop Bruin ;
pass-catching ace Dick Wallen and :
to hope to thus contain the UCLA 1
passing threat.
The net result was "the best- j
ever defensive play we've had j
against UCLA."
But just how did Taylor set up
1ho defense which must go into |
lho books as among the best in
his seven-year coaching reign?
Shifting Line
As the Indians' pleased mentor,
explained it. the Stanford linemen
and line backers kept .shifting
from one hole to another an in
stant before UCLA's play would
begin. "We hoped we would plug
a hole that they thought would
be open," ho said.
So far as covering Wallen was
concerned, ihe Indian defenders
couldn't have done belter. All
they did was keep UCLA's most
feared aerial snagger from grab
bing a single pass, and Jackie
Douglas even picked off a throw
intended for Wallen.
Taylor said the strategy here
was to keep two or three men on
Wallen all the time. A line back
er, Russ Steele or John Thomas,
would drift with him into the
short territory.
Then wingback A1 Harrington
and safety halfback Jeri McMillin
would pick up on Wallen to cover
him on medium and long throws.
