# Stanford Only Hindrance to Duck Bowl Bid
## 
### Associated Press 
Oregon's high-flying Webfoots
remain the only undefeated foot
ball team in the Pacific Coast
Conference standings today, and,
unless Stanford can bring thorn
down here next Saturday, an Ore
gon team may represent the PCC
in the Rose Bowl for the second
year in a row. Oregon State was
the nominee last season.
Oregon had lit lie trouble with
the punchless Golden Hears of
California last Saturday in Eu-1
gene, winning, 21-6, as halfhack
Jim Shariley continued his bril
liant running. He scored two
touchdowns. C;il engineered one
sustained march of 66 yards for
its lone score.
Cards Vault Rack
Stanford vaulted back into tille
consideration wilh a more or less
surprising upset of UCLA, 20-6.
Little Jackie Douglas passed and
ran the Indians to their well de
served victory, and the Indian de
fense held UCLA to four pass
complet ions.
UCLA may have suffered a let
down after its upset of Oregon
State the week before, but Wash
ington deflated ihe importance of
that conquest by knocking off the
1956 champions, 19-6. A! Fergu
son's passing and a 53-yard touch
down sprint by Jimmy Jones, who
also was a defensive star, sparked
the Huskies to their first victory
of the season.
Troy Loses Again
Washington State remained in I
title consideration with a 13-12 do- j
cision over University of Southern i
California, the only team in the
PCC that hasn't won a game.
The Trojans gave another lack
luster performance but had the ]
Cougars on the ropes in ihe clos- j
ing minutes, working an on-side
kick and driving to the Washing-1
ton State 11, where coach Don)
Clark called for a place kick on
third down from the 18, with IS j
seconds left.
He'd Do It Again
The Trojans hadn't made good
on either conversion attempt, but
Clark said Saturday, "I'd make
the same decision if I had the op
portunity again."
Idaho whipped Fresno State, 20-
6, in a non-conference game.
