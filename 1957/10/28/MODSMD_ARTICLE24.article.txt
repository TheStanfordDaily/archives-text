NOT A LOSS ALL I)AV —Jackie Douglas per
formed the rare feat of carrying: six limes from
his T-formafion quarterback slot and not losing
ground any time in Saturday's 20-fi victory over
UCLA. He's- ready to be pulled down on this
play by liill Mason (H5) of the lirnins, but not

before h<* had picked up II yards to the UCLA
12. The Indians scored three plays later to take
a TO lead, which turned out to be all the points
they needed to upset the smogland troops. lii
all, Douglas ran on the rollout play for 3r>
yards, an average of nearly siv per carry.
