# Psych Department Begins Student Honors Program
## Research Thesis, Intensive Reading Form Heart of Learning Emphasis 
### 
The Psychology Department,
aware that many of its under
graduate courses do not chal
lenge top students seriously in
tersted in psychology, has insti
tuted an Honors Program, under
the direction of Dr. Douglas H.
Lawrence.
The program, open only to psy
chology majors, will extend over
Ihe junior and senior years, and
will emphasize learning and not
grades.
During the two years, only six
formal courses will be required:
Psychology 103, the junior re
search seminar; Psychology 198,
the senior 1 seminar; four regular
subject matter courses, chosen by
the student.
Research Units'
In addition, the student must
register for 14 units of research
<o be distributed throughout his
first five quarters in the pro
gram, plus three units of directed
reading for each of six quarters.
A minor of four courses must be
completed in some field relevant
to psychology.
For the first five of the six
quarters, the participants will be
expccted to attend a weekly semi
nar conducted by an advanced
graduate student, and open only
to members of the Honors Pro
gram. The purpose of this semi-

nar will be to discuss the read
ings. No grades will be given.
The student's evaluation comes
only near the middle of the final
quarter of work. A comprehen
sixe six-hour essay examination
will be given on two consecutive
days; the first day will be de
voted to general psychology, the
second day to the student's spe
cial field which he will have se
lected for concentration during
his junior year.
Pass or Fail
The examination will be passed
or failed as a whole. If passed,
and if the research Ihesis which
the student must have submitted
before Dead Week of the previ
ous quarter is judged acceptable,
tlie student will be recommended
for graduation in the program.
If the examination is failed, or
if the thesis is unsatisfactory, the
student must satisfy the require
ments of some other major, in
cluding the regular psychology
major, to graduate.
To qualify for admission to the
program, a candidate must have
completed Psychology 1 and Psy
chology 60 with a grade of B or
better, and have at least a B aver
age. Formal application must be
submitted not later than the end
of the sophomore year.
Committee Admission
Applications and further infor
mation can be obtained from Ella
C. Bale in Room el 3. In addition
to the above requirements, ad
mission is contingent on the
judgment of the Honors Program
Committee that the candidate
will profit from this course of in
dependent study and research.
Adviser Help
Under his adviser's guidance,
the student will do a unit of re
search which must be submitted
in thesis form to the committee.
It is this research project plus
the intensive readings in the field
which constitute the heart of the
Honors Program.
According to the committee,
"The evaluation emphasis has
been placed on the long-term in
tegration of knowledge and de
velopment of creative skills.
