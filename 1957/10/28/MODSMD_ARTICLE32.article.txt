# German Club Reactivated on Campus
## 
### 
In response to the interest in
Germany created by the newly
established Stanford center in
Stuttgart, (he University's Ger
man Club has been re-established.
Through a wide and varied ac
tivity program, the club hopes to
provide its members with the op
portunity to broaden their under
standing of the German nation
and its people.
Becoming better acquainted
with the language, a necessary
antecedent to the understanding
of Germany, is a prime goal of
the club. To this end, time is pro

vided during the biweekly meet
ings on Monday nights for infor
mal conversation practice and for
the singitig of German songs.
A panel of five Stanford stu
dents who spent the last year in
Germany will be the feature of
the next club meeting, to be held
on Nov. 2.
Also scheduled for the near fu
ture is an explanatory talk com
plete with colored slides, about
the Stuttgart center. This meet
ing will be co-sponsored with the
Institute of International Rela
tions.
