From (lie Associated Cress
Stanford's Rixford K. Snyder
will testify before the State As
sembly subcommittee on inter
collegiate athletic activities today
and tomorrow, as the subcommit
tee continues its Pacific Coast
Co n fere nce i nvestigat ions.
Snyder is Stanford's faculty
representative to the conference
and in addition serves as secre
tary to the organization.
The subcommittee opens phase
two of its Pacific Coast Confer
ence today with a suggestion Cal
ifornia schools form their own
league.
lionelii Head
Assemblyman Frank G. Bonel
li (I-Huntington Parki, chairman,
announced that faculty leaders,
as well as athletic directors and
coaches, v/ill testify during the
two-day session.
"School presidents and faculty
representatives are the policy
makers of the conference," he as
serted, adding that in last
month's hearings in Los Angeles
the committee cried in hearing
only the athletic leaders.
In addition to Snyder, Profes
sor Emmett B. Moore, of Wash
ington State, the PCC president,
has agreed to testify.
Invited also were Dr. Glenn T.
Seaborg and Gregg Englhard, the
athletic faculty rpresentative and
athletic director respectively at
California.
Other Colleges
Representatives of the slate
colleges in Northern California
and independent College of the
Pacific also have been invited.
Bonelli said: "Such a confer
ence could include the four big
schools, California, Stanford, UC
LA and Southern California, and
others, perhaps such as San Jose
State, College of the Pacific and
Santa Clara, St. Mary's and Loy
ola of Los Angeles, if the latter
three again play intercollegiate
foot ball."
The Bonelli subcommittee in
vestigation resulted from Coast
Conference penalties against UC
LA, California and USC in the il
legal aid to athletes cases of last
year.
Although Bonelli stated a per
sonal belief that fines of $23,000,
$15,000 anrl $10,000 against Cali
fornia, UCLA and USC by the
conference last year were illegal,
the state attorney general's opin
ion does no tagrec. The opinion
stating the right of the confer
ence to penalize members was re
leased Oct. 1.
