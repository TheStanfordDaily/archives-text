# UCLA Yell Leader Fortells Unexpected Stanford Victory
## 
### Frank Huntress 
"We're going to be real nice
and good to Stanford people to
day."
The UCLA yell king who greet
ed his rooting section with those
words didn't realize how "good"
until two and a half hours later
when the scoreboard read:
Stanford 20 . . . UCLA (5
It was a beautiful day, even
the weather, for some 48,000 per
sons who spotted huge Stanford
Stadium to see the Indians com
pletely dominate the gafne and
take away their first victory from
the Westwood Bruins since 1053.
Of the student rooters, only
graduates and fifth-year seniors
had seen Stanford defeat UCLA.
They remember the last victory
over the Red Sanders gang, 21-20,
when Bob Garrett completely
dominated the game with his bril

Before 1 o'clock unplanned
card stunts began cropping up in
the rooting section. BJven many
different living groups brought
banners with appropriate slogans
against the Bruins. "Smother the
Smogmen" was one.
Ed Bordenkircher and the rest
of his motley yell group came as

his yells were a bit on the high

trouble getting cheers out ol the
fired-up rooting section.

the far side of the stands.
UCLA's card stunts were, as
always, excellent. The closing
stunt, their signature in script,
was their best executed stunt.
Many students thought that the
dam gates had broken and the
flood was coming any moment
when UCLA executed a perfect
63-yard kick which died on the
Indian one-yard line. Then a few
plays later Stanford fumbled.
"Was this going to be another
one of those days?" one pesimis
tic grad asked another.
No. The Card defense stiffened
and held the Bruins on four
downs from scoring. From then
on it was Stanford's game to the
gun.
After the game and the singing
of the hymn, students trying to
get mementos of the victory in
the form of goal posts found it
difficult. More than 30 official
and student police guarded the
wooden frames,
