# Cal Official Favors PCC In Inquiry
## Subcommittee Opens Investigation of Fines Against Coast Teams 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (A I )—A vice
president of the vast University
of California testified yesterday it
would bo "a mistake to put poli
ties into intercollegiate athletics."
James H. Corley, vice president
in charge of business affairs,
whose jurisdiction includes both
Berkeley and UCLA campuses,
said also he believes the Pacific
Coast Conference has "worked
satisfactorily for the good of in
tercollegiate athletics."
Corley was opening witness be
fore the state Assembly subcom
mittee on intercollegiate athletic
activities, headed by Frank G. Bo
nelli (D-Huntington Park).
A bill has been introduced in
the Legislature to set up a state
intercollegiate athletic commis
sion. Subcommittee investigation
centers on the PCC and the fines
it levied against California, UCLA
and the University of Southern
California.
Bonelli charged that the PCC is
on the downgrade and exceeded
its authority in assessing the pen
alties in the illegal aid to football
player cases.
Proposes Alliance
lie proposed a California con
ference composed of the fo u r
major schools, including Stan
ford, plus independent San Jose
State and College of the Pacific.
He added that possibly Santa
Clara, St. Mary's and Loyola could
join if they re-establish football.
Bonelli hoped to have PCC pres
ident Emmett Moore of Washing
ton State and presidents Robert
G. Sproul of California and J. E.
Wallace Sterling of Stanford be
fore the committee. Moore was
reported .sick. The two university
presidents had prior commit
ments.
California's new football coach,
Pete Elliott, when asked his opin
ion of PCC penalties that cost
player ineligibilities, replied:
".Most Severe"
"They are the most severe I've
ever heard of. They are as drastic
as they could be. I am not fa
miliar enough, however, with the
PCC situation at that time to
know whether they were war
ranted."
Asked if California could have
winning football teams under
present rules, the coach replied,
"I believe the question is whether
material on the Coast is good
enough to have winning teams. I
would say yes."
Asked whether his recruiting
this season was successful in the
light of PCC penalties, he replied:
"No coach ever is satisfed with
the recruiting. I do feel we got
some athletes we were very anx
ious to get."
He indicated California would
stick with its PCC round-robin
schedule through 1960. The board
of regents last June decreed that
after the current season UCLA
and California need not be bound
by the PCC rule requiring each
football team, except Idaho, to
play each other's conference team
annually.

some athletes we were very anx
ious to get."
He indicated California would
stick with its PCC round-robin
schedule through 1960. The board
of regents last June decreed that
after the current season UCLA
and California need not be bound
by the PCC rule requiring each
football team, except Idaho, to
play each other's conference team
annually.
SAN FRANCISCO (A I )—A vice
president of the vast University
of California testified yesterday it
would bo "a mistake to put poli
ties into intercollegiate athletics."
James H. Corley, vice president
in charge of business affairs,
whose jurisdiction includes both
Berkeley and UCLA campuses,
said also he believes the Pacific
Coast Conference has "worked
satisfactorily for the good of in
tercollegiate athletics."
Corley was opening witness be
fore the state Assembly subcom
mittee on intercollegiate athletic
activities, headed by Frank G. Bo
nelli (D-Huntington Park).
A bill has been introduced in
the Legislature to set up a state
intercollegiate athletic commis
sion. Subcommittee investigation
centers on the PCC and the fines
it levied against California, UCLA
and the University of Southern
California.
Bonelli charged that the PCC is
on the downgrade and exceeded
its authority in assessing the pen
alties in the illegal aid to football
player cases.
Proposes Alliance
lie proposed a California con
ference composed of the fo u r
major schools, including Stan
ford, plus independent San Jose
State and College of the Pacific.
He added that possibly Santa
Clara, St. Mary's and Loyola could
join if they re-establish football.
Bonelli hoped to have PCC pres
ident Emmett Moore of Washing
ton State and presidents Robert
G. Sproul of California and J. E.
Wallace Sterling of Stanford be
fore the committee. Moore was
reported .sick. The two university
presidents had prior commit
ments.
California's new football coach,
Pete Elliott, when asked his opin
ion of PCC penalties that cost
player ineligibilities, replied:
".Most Severe"
"They are the most severe I've
ever heard of. They are as drastic
as they could be. I am not fa
miliar enough, however, with the
PCC situation at that time to
know whether they were war
ranted."
Asked if California could have
winning football teams under
present rules, the coach replied,
"I believe the question is whether
material on the Coast is good
enough to have winning teams. I
would say yes."
Asked whether his recruiting
this season was successful in the
light of PCC penalties, he replied:
"No coach ever is satisfed with
the recruiting. I do feel we got
some athletes we were very anx
ious to get."
