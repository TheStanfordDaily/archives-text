# Hero Rings Alarm; Saw Horses Burn
## 
### 
Release for the tension built up during a hard week of mid
terms came early Friday morning at about 2:30 when an inmate
of Arroyo 3 realized his life-long ambition turning in a fire
alarm.
About 2:2.) a.m. an inebriate (obviously not a Stanford student)
in an Austin Healey backed into saw horses and flares which sur
rounded an open manhole in Escondido tSreet.
The overturned flares caught the saw horses on fire and started
a fire, according to eye witnesses, of "reasonable" size. Believing
in the maxim that "opportunity knocks but once," the Wilbur man
bolted across the street to Branner's lawn and pulled the fire
alarm.
Unfortunately, when the Stanford Fire Department arrived 10
minutes later with three ladder trucks, on police car and one irri
tated fire chief, the "fire" had dwindled to such a proportion that
a slight gust of wind (say from a pasing car) might easily have
put the conflagration out.
The episode ended with student firemen ceremoniously using
a fire extinguisher on the all but extinct flame. When asked the
reason for turning in the alarm the Arroyo man replied, "I thought
there might be a gas main down there, or something."
The fine for turning in a false alarm was waived in view of the
.student's "good intentions.
