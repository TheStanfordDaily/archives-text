# Dr. Houck Praises Vaccine Program; 1033 Immunized
## 
### 
Final tabulations on last week's
influenza inoculation program re
vealed that 1033 Stanford students
were immunized during the five
day period.
Dr. George Houck hailed the
figure as "a great accomplishment
on the part of the students and
the Health Service.
"We only hope the students will
continue to come for their shots
in equal numbers this week," Dr.
Houck commented at yesterday's
meeting of the Student Health
Cou ncil.
Both first and second shots will
lie given to all students from 3 to
1:45 p.m. through Friday of this
week at the Health Service.
A two-week interval is recom
mended between first and second
injections.
