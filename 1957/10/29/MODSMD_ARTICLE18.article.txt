## Strategic Importance of Syria 
### IIR Political Analysts 
Editor's Note: The Institute of International
Relations lias begun :i policy of giving forth
statements on issues of international signifi
cance. When these policy statements are is
s.ned by tin* I IK, The Daii.v will pass them on
as a public service to the student body.
A "Communist coup" was heralded in Western
papers on Aug. 19. Since then events in the Mid-
East have moved to the point of extremely tense
relations between Syria and Turkey, and Ameri
(••m and Russian threats and counter-threats. In
this article we will attempt to assess ihe real
importance of the Syrian situation to the West.
The events in Syria are simply listed;
• The expulsion of American diplomats in mid-
August ;
• The change of power in the Syrian army, in
cluding the dismissal of 10 high-ranking officers
on Aug. 19;
• Deals with Russia to the extent of $230 mil
lion of armaments and $140 million of economic
aid.
Power is in the hands of the army, which
favors dealing with Russia rather than with the
West.
However, it must lie remembered that these
flea Is are not themselves important to the West;
the two important factors are <1) the degree of
Russian influence on Syrian foreign policy and
< '21 the actual power of Syria in Mid-East affairs.
Syrian foreign policy will become subordinate
1o Russia if she should become financially de
pendent on Russia, or if she should be persuaded
1o pursue a policy ostensibly in her own interest
hut in fact not so. Only in one field does it seem
lhat either of the above conditions will apply.
Comparing the extent of debt with the volume
fit Syrian foreign trade, we find the indebtedness
relatively slight; repayment of Ihe economic aid
fiver 10 years involves a yearly payment of about

5 per cent of her normal volume of exports a
small proportion. Combined with the fact that
the Arab countries are aware of the danger of
becoming dependent on a foreign power, it seems
that the likelihood of Syria being forced, through
debt, to follow Russia's lead is small.
Economically, Syria is weak; her main sources
of foreign currency being agricultural exports,
and dues from the transit of oil and railway
freight. For her to interfere in the oil trans
shipment would reduce her own income, would
adversely affect other Arab countries and bring
their pressure to bear on her, and would in any
case have only a marginal effect on Western
Europe, as most of their oil from the Middle East
comes by tanker, relatively little by pipeline.
Of Syria's neighbors, Turkey, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia are larger and stronger than she is; ex
panding political influence in the Aral) world
could be gained only by pressure on Jordan or
Lebanon, but both these countries are strongly
pro-Western. Thus the danger of subversion of
surrounding states is small.
The real danger from Russian influence in
Syria is that by propaganda it may be possible
to revive the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Western
world is both dependent on Arab oil and commit
ted to supporting Israel; increased tensions be
tween the Arab states and Israel would put the
West in a very awkward situation.
The irrational and hysterical fears shown in
America, and in Great Britain too, after the
recent Syrian news are not justified by the situ
ation itself.
The purpose of this article has not been to
say that the Syrian situation is completely un
important, but to show in what direction it is
important. Our conclusion is that the Syrian
changes, taken by themselves, do not justify the
hysteria we have witnessed over the past two
months.

East have moved to the point of extremely tense
relations between Syria and Turkey, and Ameri
(••m and Russian threats and counter-threats. In
this article we will attempt to assess ihe real
importance of the Syrian situation to the West.
The events in Syria are simply listed;
• The expulsion of American diplomats in mid-
August ;
• The change of power in the Syrian army, in
cluding the dismissal of 10 high-ranking officers
on Aug. 19;
• Deals with Russia to the extent of $230 mil
lion of armaments and $140 million of economic
aid.
Power is in the hands of the army, which
favors dealing with Russia rather than with the
West.
However, it must lie remembered that these
flea Is are not themselves important to the West;
the two important factors are <1) the degree of
Russian influence on Syrian foreign policy and
< '21 the actual power of Syria in Mid-East affairs.
Syrian foreign policy will become subordinate
1o Russia if she should become financially de
pendent on Russia, or if she should be persuaded
1o pursue a policy ostensibly in her own interest
hut in fact not so. Only in one field does it seem
lhat either of the above conditions will apply.
Comparing the extent of debt with the volume
fit Syrian foreign trade, we find the indebtedness
relatively slight; repayment of Ihe economic aid
fiver 10 years involves a yearly payment of about

5 per cent of her normal volume of exports a
small proportion. Combined with the fact that
the Arab countries are aware of the danger of
becoming dependent on a foreign power, it seems
that the likelihood of Syria being forced, through
debt, to follow Russia's lead is small.
Economically, Syria is weak; her main sources
of foreign currency being agricultural exports,
and dues from the transit of oil and railway
freight. For her to interfere in the oil trans
shipment would reduce her own income, would
adversely affect other Arab countries and bring
their pressure to bear on her, and would in any
case have only a marginal effect on Western
Europe, as most of their oil from the Middle East
comes by tanker, relatively little by pipeline.
Of Syria's neighbors, Turkey, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia are larger and stronger than she is; ex
panding political influence in the Aral) world
could be gained only by pressure on Jordan or
Lebanon, but both these countries are strongly
pro-Western. Thus the danger of subversion of
surrounding states is small.
The real danger from Russian influence in
Syria is that by propaganda it may be possible
to revive the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Western
world is both dependent on Arab oil and commit
ted to supporting Israel; increased tensions be
tween the Arab states and Israel would put the
West in a very awkward situation.
The irrational and hysterical fears shown in
America, and in Great Britain too, after the
recent Syrian news are not justified by the situ
ation itself.
The purpose of this article has not been to
say that the Syrian situation is completely un
important, but to show in what direction it is
important. Our conclusion is that the Syrian
changes, taken by themselves, do not justify the
hysteria we have witnessed over the past two
months.
