Stanford Bookstore Replies
Editor, The Daily:
In your paper of Oct. 18 there is a letter from
n bookseller in a nearby town. Since this letter
might be interpreted as making adverse com
ments regarding the president of ihe board of
directors of the Stanford Bookstore, I feel obli
gated to ask you to publish my statement that
any such aspersions are completely unwarranted.
1 know that I, as a member of the Bookstore
board, and the other members also have been
kept fully informed of Bookstore business, in
cluding correspondence with the bookseller in
question. The president has my unreserved
backing.
It is only natural that a bookseller should wish
to sell more books, at a higher price. The Stan
ford Bookstore, on the other hand, is operated
for the purpose of supplying Stanford students
and faculty at as low a price as possible. The
divergence of interest is obvious.
As I say, I can understand the bookseller want
ing to increase his business. I cannot, however,
permit any innuendoes in his verbose letter to
escape a categorical denial.

In Defense of . . .
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mr. Smith's recent letter to The
Daily, I would like to say something in defense
of Mr. Williamson and his trip through Red
China. The United States is supposed to be a
country where travel is free to all citizens, and
Ihis assumption is supported by the fact that the
State Department did not stop Mr. Williamson
from making his trip, but merely advised him
not to.
But in view of this official "advice," and of
Mr. Smith's published reaction to the trip. I.
would like to ask the question, "What are we
afraid of. anyway?" Do we fear that if ordinary
Americans go to China or Russia they will return
as Communists? If so, we must think that Amer
icans are so gullible as to swallow any propa
ganda fed them, and that exposure to a foreign
ideology would corrupt their minds.
What if we did allow or even encourage large
numbers of Americans to visit China or Russia?
To be sure, they might only see what the Com
munists wanted them to see, but I am sure most
would realize that they were being shown the
frosting of the cake. There sre always some who
will be fooled by Red propaganda, but I believe
1 his would be counteracted by the many who are
not. Witness the millions who have fled from
Communism at the risk of their lives; their story
has the ring of truth.
Mr. Lieszkovszky (whose letter also appears
in Monday's Daily) has raised a pertinent ques
tion: Why are not Russian students allowed to
visit the Western world? It is obviously because
Ihe Communists are afraid of the effect this
would have on their ideology. I do not think our
fears in this respect are justified. Just because
Hie Russians deny liberty to their citizens does
not give us reason to do the same.
Mr. Smith almost accuses Mr. Williamson of
being a traitor to his country for allowing him
self to be exposed to Communist ideology against
the wishes of the State Department. Baloney!
Mr. Williamson had a perfect right to make his
trip and to publicly express his ideas afterwards
- at least if the principles upon which this nation
was founded are not dead. We may criticize him
for expressing those opinions, but we cannot pre
vent him from making them for that is the path
that leads to the totalitarianism we are supposed
to he fighting.

Editor, The Daily:
Monday's Daily reached another minimum in
its frequent oscillations between questionable
journalism (answering Letters to the Editor in
boldface type I and ersatz editorializing. How can
an editorial "neither condemn nor condone"?
First you said, "We feel that he fEarl William
son] did not make the correct decision. But, then,

Ihe whole question is a difficult one." You con
tinue: "Therefore we cannot find it in ourselves
to condemn Williamson. Nor can we condone his
action." What on earth are you trying to say?
Why write on the subject if you don't take some
stand?
Apparently the only subject you can be posilive
about is Friday night meals in Encina, "con
demned" so brilliantly in Rich Brown's appropri
ately titled column "Much Ado About Nothing."
In my opinion, the issue in the Williamson case
is this: The State Department requested William
son's group not to go to China. They went.
Whether their action was wrong for propaganda,
political or legal reasons is not nearly so signifi
cant as the fact that they outright flouted the
United States government. It seems 1o me that
most college students do not have the competence
to judge the State Department.
Notwithstanding the general belief Ihat the
government is run by "fat bureaucrats," there
are many men, particularly in the State Depart
ment. who are extremely capable and who have
good reason for what they do. Williamson and
his hot-headed associates certainly did not behave
democratically, but rather childishly.
Tom Smith
Editor's Note: To condemn or to condone is
to place value judgments on a person's actions.
As the editorial implied, we do not profess to
possess that great wisdom needed to evalua'ie
the results, good or evil, of Williamson's and
his associates' actions. Moreover, we prefer to
believe in a theory of ethics that judges the
value of action by its results.

As bewildered freshmen at Stanford Univer

pressions of the bewildering Civ exam in the
form of a freshman's prayer:
PSALM OF CIV
Western Civ is my weakness,
I shall not pass.
It maketh me to stay home nights
And be absent from the flicks.
It. leadeth me into Mem Aud
For examination's sake.
Yea, tho I walk through the quad to Mem Aud,
I shall not be happy.
He shall prepare a place for me in the corner,
And he shall anoint my head with a dunce cap:
My head is empty.
Surely D's and F's shall follow me all the days
of my life.
And I shall dwell in Western Civ forever.

Editor, The Daily:
Monday's Daily reached another minimum in
its frequent oscillations between questionable
journalism (answering Letters to the Editor in
boldface type I and ersatz editorializing. How can
an editorial "neither condemn nor condone"?
First you said, "We feel that he fEarl William
son] did not make the correct decision. But, then,

Ihe whole question is a difficult one." You con
tinue: "Therefore we cannot find it in ourselves
to condemn Williamson. Nor can we condone his
action." What on earth are you trying to say?
Why write on the subject if you don't take some
stand?
Apparently the only subject you can be posilive
about is Friday night meals in Encina, "con
demned" so brilliantly in Rich Brown's appropri
ately titled column "Much Ado About Nothing."
In my opinion, the issue in the Williamson case
is this: The State Department requested William
son's group not to go to China. They went.
Whether their action was wrong for propaganda,
political or legal reasons is not nearly so signifi
cant as the fact that they outright flouted the
United States government. It seems 1o me that
most college students do not have the competence
to judge the State Department.
Notwithstanding the general belief Ihat the
government is run by "fat bureaucrats," there
are many men, particularly in the State Depart
ment. who are extremely capable and who have
good reason for what they do. Williamson and
his hot-headed associates certainly did not behave

In your paper of Oct. 18 there is a letter from
n bookseller in a nearby town. Since this letter
might be interpreted as making adverse com
ments regarding the president of ihe board of
directors of the Stanford Bookstore, I feel obli
gated to ask you to publish my statement that
any such aspersions are completely unwarranted.
1 know that I, as a member of the Bookstore
board, and the other members also have been
kept fully informed of Bookstore business, in
cluding correspondence with the bookseller in
question. The president has my unreserved
backing.
It is only natural that a bookseller should wish
to sell more books, at a higher price. The Stan
ford Bookstore, on the other hand, is operated
for the purpose of supplying Stanford students
and faculty at as low a price as possible. The
divergence of interest is obvious.
As I say, I can understand the bookseller want
ing to increase his business. I cannot, however,
permit any innuendoes in his verbose letter to
escape a categorical denial.

In response to Mr. Smith's recent letter to The

of Mr. Williamson and his trip through Red
China. The United States is supposed to be a
country where travel is free to all citizens, and
Ihis assumption is supported by the fact that the
State Department did not stop Mr. Williamson
from making his trip, but merely advised him
not to.
But in view of this official "advice," and of
Mr. Smith's published reaction to the trip. I.
would like to ask the question, "What are we
afraid of. anyway?" Do we fear that if ordinary
Americans go to China or Russia they will return
as Communists? If so, we must think that Amer
icans are so gullible as to swallow any propa
ganda fed them, and that exposure to a foreign
ideology would corrupt their minds.
What if we did allow or even encourage large
numbers of Americans to visit China or Russia?
To be sure, they might only see what the Com
munists wanted them to see, but I am sure most
would realize that they were being shown the
frosting of the cake. There sre always some who

In your paper of Oct. 18 there is a letter from
n bookseller in a nearby town. Since this letter
might be interpreted as making adverse com
ments regarding the president of ihe board of
directors of the Stanford Bookstore, I feel obli
gated to ask you to publish my statement that
any such aspersions are completely unwarranted.
1 know that I, as a member of the Bookstore
board, and the other members also have been
kept fully informed of Bookstore business, in
cluding correspondence with the bookseller in
question. The president has my unreserved
backing.
It is only natural that a bookseller should wish
to sell more books, at a higher price. The Stan
ford Bookstore, on the other hand, is operated
for the purpose of supplying Stanford students
and faculty at as low a price as possible. The
divergence of interest is obvious.
As I say, I can understand the bookseller want
ing to increase his business. I cannot, however,
permit any innuendoes in his verbose letter to
escape a categorical denial.

Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mr. Smith's recent letter to The
Daily, I would like to say something in defense
of Mr. Williamson and his trip through Red
China. The United States is supposed to be a
country where travel is free to all citizens, and
Ihis assumption is supported by the fact that the
State Department did not stop Mr. Williamson
from making his trip, but merely advised him
not to.
But in view of this official "advice," and of
Mr. Smith's published reaction to the trip. I.
would like to ask the question, "What are we
afraid of. anyway?" Do we fear that if ordinary
Americans go to China or Russia they will return
as Communists? If so, we must think that Amer
icans are so gullible as to swallow any propa
ganda fed them, and that exposure to a foreign
ideology would corrupt their minds.
What if we did allow or even encourage large
numbers of Americans to visit China or Russia?
To be sure, they might only see what the Com
munists wanted them to see, but I am sure most
would realize that they were being shown the
frosting of the cake. There sre always some who
will be fooled by Red propaganda, but I believe
1 his would be counteracted by the many who are
not. Witness the millions who have fled from
Communism at the risk of their lives; their story
has the ring of truth.
Mr. Lieszkovszky (whose letter also appears
in Monday's Daily) has raised a pertinent ques
tion: Why are not Russian students allowed to
visit the Western world? It is obviously because
Ihe Communists are afraid of the effect this
would have on their ideology. I do not think our
fears in this respect are justified. Just because
Hie Russians deny liberty to their citizens does
not give us reason to do the same.
Mr. Smith almost accuses Mr. Williamson of
being a traitor to his country for allowing him
self to be exposed to Communist ideology against
the wishes of the State Department. Baloney!
Mr. Williamson had a perfect right to make his
trip and to publicly express his ideas afterwards
- at least if the principles upon which this nation
was founded are not dead. We may criticize him
for expressing those opinions, but we cannot pre
vent him from making them for that is the path
that leads to the totalitarianism we are supposed

Stanford Bookstore Replies
Editor, The Daily:
In your paper of Oct. 18 there is a letter from
n bookseller in a nearby town. Since this letter
might be interpreted as making adverse com
ments regarding the president of ihe board of
directors of the Stanford Bookstore, I feel obli
gated to ask you to publish my statement that
any such aspersions are completely unwarranted.
1 know that I, as a member of the Bookstore
board, and the other members also have been
kept fully informed of Bookstore business, in
cluding correspondence with the bookseller in
question. The president has my unreserved
backing.
It is only natural that a bookseller should wish
to sell more books, at a higher price. The Stan
ford Bookstore, on the other hand, is operated
for the purpose of supplying Stanford students
and faculty at as low a price as possible. The
divergence of interest is obvious.
As I say, I can understand the bookseller want
ing to increase his business. I cannot, however,
permit any innuendoes in his verbose letter to
escape a categorical denial.

Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mr. Smith's recent letter to The
Daily, I would like to say something in defense
of Mr. Williamson and his trip through Red
China. The United States is supposed to be a
country where travel is free to all citizens, and
Ihis assumption is supported by the fact that the
State Department did not stop Mr. Williamson
from making his trip, but merely advised him
not to.
But in view of this official "advice," and of
Mr. Smith's published reaction to the trip. I.
would like to ask the question, "What are we
afraid of. anyway?" Do we fear that if ordinary
Americans go to China or Russia they will return
as Communists? If so, we must think that Amer
icans are so gullible as to swallow any propa
ganda fed them, and that exposure to a foreign
ideology would corrupt their minds.
What if we did allow or even encourage large
numbers of Americans to visit China or Russia?
To be sure, they might only see what the Com
munists wanted them to see, but I am sure most
would realize that they were being shown the
frosting of the cake. There sre always some who
will be fooled by Red propaganda, but I believe
1 his would be counteracted by the many who are
not. Witness the millions who have fled from
Communism at the risk of their lives; their story
has the ring of truth.
Mr. Lieszkovszky (whose letter also appears
in Monday's Daily) has raised a pertinent ques
tion: Why are not Russian students allowed to
visit the Western world? It is obviously because
Ihe Communists are afraid of the effect this
would have on their ideology. I do not think our
fears in this respect are justified. Just because
Hie Russians deny liberty to their citizens does
not give us reason to do the same.
Mr. Smith almost accuses Mr. Williamson of
being a traitor to his country for allowing him
self to be exposed to Communist ideology against
the wishes of the State Department. Baloney!
Mr. Williamson had a perfect right to make his
trip and to publicly express his ideas afterwards
- at least if the principles upon which this nation
was founded are not dead. We may criticize him
for expressing those opinions, but we cannot pre
vent him from making them for that is the path
that leads to the totalitarianism we are supposed
to he fighting.

Editor, The Daily:
Monday's Daily reached another minimum in
its frequent oscillations between questionable
journalism (answering Letters to the Editor in
boldface type I and ersatz editorializing. How can
an editorial "neither condemn nor condone"?
First you said, "We feel that he fEarl William
son] did not make the correct decision. But, then,

Ihe whole question is a difficult one." You con
tinue: "Therefore we cannot find it in ourselves
to condemn Williamson. Nor can we condone his
action." What on earth are you trying to say?
Why write on the subject if you don't take some
stand?
Apparently the only subject you can be posilive
about is Friday night meals in Encina, "con
demned" so brilliantly in Rich Brown's appropri
ately titled column "Much Ado About Nothing."
In my opinion, the issue in the Williamson case
is this: The State Department requested William
son's group not to go to China. They went.
Whether their action was wrong for propaganda,
political or legal reasons is not nearly so signifi
cant as the fact that they outright flouted the
United States government. It seems 1o me that
most college students do not have the competence
to judge the State Department.
Notwithstanding the general belief Ihat the
government is run by "fat bureaucrats," there
are many men, particularly in the State Depart
ment. who are extremely capable and who have
good reason for what they do. Williamson and
his hot-headed associates certainly did not behave
democratically, but rather childishly.

Editor's Note: To condemn or to condone is
to place value judgments on a person's actions.
As the editorial implied, we do not profess to

the results, good or evil, of Williamson's and
his associates' actions. Moreover, we prefer to
believe in a theory of ethics that judges the
value of action by its results.
