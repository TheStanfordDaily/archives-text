# Alumni Association Lists Advantages As Membership Drive Gets Under Way
## 
### 
"Stanford is important to you
as long as you live," says the
Stanford Alumni Association.
"Your degree is y o u r prime
asset, and, although it may seem
to have everlasting value when
Dr. Sterling places your diploma
in your hand, Stanford's reputa
tion in the future will inevitably

have a direct influence on its ne
gotiability."
One of the best ways to pre
serve the spirit and reputation of
Stanford is to join the Alumni As
sociation, whose membership
drive started yesterday and will
continue through Friday, under
the direction of the Axe Society.
Association headquarters is in
Bowman Alumni House. Here stu
dents as well as alumni and ad
ministrative groups hold meetings
and talks — approximately 400 a
year.
All facilities of Bowman are at
the disposal of students, including
a stove and a refrigerator. The
only requirement for usage of the
building is to register the event
with the secretarial staff.
Alumni Gifts
The building was opened in
1930. It was constructed through
gifts of alumni, the largest con
tribution coming from Guy Bow
man, class of '02.
One of the many gifts present
ed to the alumni house is the
multicolored picture hanging in
the office of Robert Pierce, as
sistant to the president.
The story of its presentation is
that the president of the Stanford
Club of the Philippines thought
the office should have a picture
with all the color of the office in
it. When he returned a short time
later, lie carried the picture under
his arm. The duty on it was
$3000.
Ticket Priority
Benefits derived from associa
tion membership include football
ticket priority and a life subscrip
tion to the award-winning Stan
ford Review, a magazine publish
ed 10 times a year, which con
nects alumni with campus activi
ties, friends and former class
mates. Review editor Dan Ends
ley is a former Daily editor.
At Big Game time the associa
tion sponsors eight Stanford class
reunions. Each class has a re
union every five years. Confer
ences are held in 15 cities through
out the country with University
officials to inform alumni on
plans and policies.
Members also have access to
the summer camp at Fallen Leaf
Lake, near Tahoe.
Most Life Members
About 20,200 alumni are mem
bers of the association most of
them life members.
During the current membership
drive, students will be given re
duced rates. A degree is not re
quired for membership. Anyone
who attends the University for at

least one quarter, graduate or un
dergraduate, may join.
The main advantage of Alumni
Association membership, as put
by the association's magazine, is
this : "Stanford isn't just an insti
tution. it's a state of mind—and
Stanford will remain great as long
as this holds true."


MANY FUNCTIONS —One of the numerous ac
tivities which keep the Bowman Alumni House
in a busy whirl is this International Club gather
ing. More than 100 events are held yearly in the

building which is supported by the Alumni As
sociation. The annual association membership
drive is currently under way, directed by the
Axe Society.

quired for membership. Anyone
who attends the University for at

least one quarter, graduate or un

The main advantage of Alumni
Association membership, as put
by the association's magazine, is
this : "Stanford isn't just an insti
tution. it's a state of mind—and
Stanford will remain great as long
as this holds true."


MANY FUNCTIONS —One of the numerous ac
tivities which keep the Bowman Alumni House

building which is supported by the Alumni As

"Stanford is important to you
as long as you live," says the
Stanford Alumni Association.
"Your degree is y o u r prime
asset, and, although it may seem
to have everlasting value when
Dr. Sterling places your diploma
in your hand, Stanford's reputa
tion in the future will inevitably

have a direct influence on its ne
gotiability."
One of the best ways to pre
serve the spirit and reputation of
Stanford is to join the Alumni As
sociation, whose membership
drive started yesterday and will
continue through Friday, under
the direction of the Axe Society.
Association headquarters is in
Bowman Alumni House. Here stu
dents as well as alumni and ad
ministrative groups hold meetings
and talks — approximately 400 a
year.
All facilities of Bowman are at
the disposal of students, including
a stove and a refrigerator. The
only requirement for usage of the
building is to register the event
with the secretarial staff.
Alumni Gifts
The building was opened in
1930. It was constructed through
gifts of alumni, the largest con
tribution coming from Guy Bow
man, class of '02.
One of the many gifts present
ed to the alumni house is the
multicolored picture hanging in
the office of Robert Pierce, as
sistant to the president.
The story of its presentation is
that the president of the Stanford
Club of the Philippines thought
the office should have a picture
with all the color of the office in
it. When he returned a short time
later, lie carried the picture under
his arm. The duty on it was
$3000.
Ticket Priority
Benefits derived from associa
tion membership include football
ticket priority and a life subscrip
tion to the award-winning Stan
ford Review, a magazine publish
ed 10 times a year, which con
nects alumni with campus activi
ties, friends and former class
mates. Review editor Dan Ends
ley is a former Daily editor.
At Big Game time the associa
tion sponsors eight Stanford class
reunions. Each class has a re
union every five years. Confer
ences are held in 15 cities through
out the country with University
officials to inform alumni on
plans and policies.
Members also have access to
the summer camp at Fallen Leaf
Lake, near Tahoe.
Most Life Members
About 20,200 alumni are mem
bers of the association most of
them life members.
During the current membership
drive, students will be given re
duced rates. A degree is not re
quired for membership. Anyone
who attends the University for at

least one quarter, graduate or un
dergraduate, may join.
