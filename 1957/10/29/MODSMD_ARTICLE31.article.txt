# Cards Watch Oregon-Cal Game Movies; Thrilling Contest Predicted for Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford got the low-down on
Oregon last night through the
magic eye of the movie projector,
and what the Indians saw made
it evident that Saturday's game
against the Ducks will be a
thriller.
Chuck Taylor's troops, fresh ;
from their best showing of the
year, looked on while the Oregon-
California game was replayed be
fore their eyes. As expected, the
most impressive phases of the
Duck game were the ability of
their fast-running backs and I he
strength of their defense.
The Cards had earlier in the
day watched another fine team in
action some squad from the San
Francisco Bay Area that trounced
a good UCLA eleven, 20-6, last
Saturday.
Two of the Indians who watch
ed the flicks found themselves on
the doubtful list for Saturday's

battle with Oregon. They are
Troy Barbee and Russ Steele, both
bothered by knee trouble.
The present plan in Steele's sit
uation is to have him back up
John Thomas, who will move into
the first-string center slot. Barbee,
however, is a bit more question

able. and there is a chance that
Taylor might shuffle his tackles
around at today's practice session.
The Indians will go through a
normal Tuesday workout pro
gram, after half the team took
things easy at yesterday's abbre
viated drills.
