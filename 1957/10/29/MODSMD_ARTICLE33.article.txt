For the second time in one month, Stanford Stadium becomes the
site of what sport experts call "the game that will probably decide
the PCC's Rose Bowl team." The University of Oregon Ducks will
he trying to cinch that distinction this Saturday when they meet
Stanford in their 26th encounter of the series which began back in
1900.
This year the Oregonians bring with them what they consider
to ho their host team since 1920 the last time they made the trip
to Pasadena. They have a running powerhouse to go with one of
the best defensive units on the Coast—having led the PCC in Ihat de
partment for the past two years. This year Oregon will not be "duck
soup" for the Indians. The Webfoots have allowed less than a touch
down a game thus far this season 31 points in six games. They
hold a 5-1 season record with a 4-0 conference report card. Their
only loss was a respectable 0-3 setback to Pittsburgh in the last 20

seconds of the game. Victories
include Idaho, UCLA, San Jose
State, WSC and Cal.
Watch the speed of all thi-ee
Oregon running backs — half
hacks Jim Shanley and Charlie
Tourville and fullback Jack Mor
ris. Shanley is elusive while
Morris is a track-fast, power run
ner. Also watch for passes from
the left halfbacks who have
thrown more than 12 already.
Tourville is the loft half. On the
line look for the fine pass catch
ing of Ron Stover and the bone
crushing of Harry Mondale. The

i— 1 key to any I -attack is the leader
ship of the quarterback and the Ducks have one in .lack Crabtree '
who is a good runner and adequate passer.
In six games Oregon and Stanford have met three common op
ponents San Jose, UCLA and WSC. Oregon won all three while ihc
Indians lost only to WSC. But comparative scores mean nothing in
football, especially when so much is at stake as in a game like this.
Stanford has lost two games this season—the shellacking Rice ad
ministered the Cards and the WSC fluke. The game will probably
be rated even by most writers with any edge being given to the
Bucks. Against UCLA last weekend the Indians proved that they
can play top-notch football. Jack Douglas showed that he is an ex
cellent passer and an adequate runner. The line contained UCLA
when it counted, while the hitherto terrible pass defense was .just
short of fantabulous.
That Old Black Gas
This writer took "gas" last week in The Daily's 17 predictions by |
picking only eight winners. So with so much encouragement here
we go again. In the PCC race this coming weekend I pick UCLA
over Cal, Oregon State over Washington State, Washington over
SC. And in the most important game of the conference I pick Stan
ford to sidetrack Oregon's Rose Bowl-bound express. I leave you
with, the always, one last word of caution: WATCH OREGON;
THEY'RE GREEN AND YELLOW.
SHORT AND QUICKIES: One of the big reasons for the In
dians' improved job on defense and in the line this year is Herm
Meistcr, new assistant coach. He played his football at St. Mary's
where he was captain and All-Coast tackle in 1935. He has coached
at Santa Clara and Cal. . . . Did you know that Chuck Taylor
coached wrestling, rugby and, later, the intramural program after
World War II here on Ihe Farm? . . . Washington State dedicated
last Saturday's game against SC to quarterback Bunny Aldrich who
remained at home while his young son was near death with heart
trouble. . . . Akin Tausau Harrington can really put on a sword
dancing act. . . . Stanford's Bob Reynolds, the only man to play
three complete Rose Bowl games 11934-3(5), in a story by Dick Hy
land in the Los Angeles Times said: "Stanford hasn't a prayer to
beat UCLA unless the Indians do a complete right-about-face. . . .
I simply cannot understand the Stanford letdowns." Well, Bob, they
did the about-face. What command should we give them next week
against the Ducks?
BEST COMEBACK OF THE SEASON: Uclan coach Red Sanders
blamed his 20-6 defeal by Stanford last Saturday mainly on the Asian j
flu. As to the significance it played on the outcome of the game, a
Stanford lineman was quoted as coming back with the remark: "I
didn't notice anybody sneezing in my lace."

In six games Oregon and Stanford have met three common op
ponents San Jose, UCLA and WSC. Oregon won all three while ihc
Indians lost only to WSC. But comparative scores mean nothing in
football, especially when so much is at stake as in a game like this.
Stanford has lost two games this season—the shellacking Rice ad
ministered the Cards and the WSC fluke. The game will probably
be rated even by most writers with any edge being given to the
Bucks. Against UCLA last weekend the Indians proved that they
can play top-notch football. Jack Douglas showed that he is an ex
cellent passer and an adequate runner. The line contained UCLA
when it counted, while the hitherto terrible pass defense was .just
short of fantabulous.
That Old Black Gas
This writer took "gas" last week in The Daily's 17 predictions by |
picking only eight winners. So with so much encouragement here
we go again. In the PCC race this coming weekend I pick UCLA
over Cal, Oregon State over Washington State, Washington over
SC. And in the most important game of the conference I pick Stan
ford to sidetrack Oregon's Rose Bowl-bound express. I leave you
with, the always, one last word of caution: WATCH OREGON;
THEY'RE GREEN AND YELLOW.
SHORT AND QUICKIES: One of the big reasons for the In
dians' improved job on defense and in the line this year is Herm
Meistcr, new assistant coach. He played his football at St. Mary's
where he was captain and All-Coast tackle in 1935. He has coached
at Santa Clara and Cal. . . . Did you know that Chuck Taylor
coached wrestling, rugby and, later, the intramural program after
World War II here on Ihe Farm? . . . Washington State dedicated
last Saturday's game against SC to quarterback Bunny Aldrich who
remained at home while his young son was near death with heart
trouble. . . . Akin Tausau Harrington can really put on a sword
dancing act. . . . Stanford's Bob Reynolds, the only man to play
three complete Rose Bowl games 11934-3(5), in a story by Dick Hy
land in the Los Angeles Times said: "Stanford hasn't a prayer to
beat UCLA unless the Indians do a complete right-about-face. . . .
I simply cannot understand the Stanford letdowns." Well, Bob, they
did the about-face. What command should we give them next week
against the Ducks?
BEST COMEBACK OF THE SEASON: Uclan coach Red Sanders
blamed his 20-6 defeal by Stanford last Saturday mainly on the Asian j
flu. As to the significance it played on the outcome of the game, a
Stanford lineman was quoted as coming back with the remark: "I
didn't notice anybody sneezing in my lace."

For the second time in one month, Stanford Stadium becomes the
site of what sport experts call "the game that will probably decide
the PCC's Rose Bowl team." The University of Oregon Ducks will
he trying to cinch that distinction this Saturday when they meet
Stanford in their 26th encounter of the series which began back in
1900.
This year the Oregonians bring with them what they consider
to ho their host team since 1920 the last time they made the trip
to Pasadena. They have a running powerhouse to go with one of
the best defensive units on the Coast—having led the PCC in Ihat de
partment for the past two years. This year Oregon will not be "duck
soup" for the Indians. The Webfoots have allowed less than a touch
down a game thus far this season 31 points in six games. They
hold a 5-1 season record with a 4-0 conference report card. Their
only loss was a respectable 0-3 setback to Pittsburgh in the last 20

seconds of the game. Victories
include Idaho, UCLA, San Jose
State, WSC and Cal.

SC. And in the most important game of the conference I pick Stan
ford to sidetrack Oregon's Rose Bowl-bound express. I leave you
with, the always, one last word of caution: WATCH OREGON;
THEY'RE GREEN AND YELLOW.
SHORT AND QUICKIES: One of the big reasons for the In
dians' improved job on defense and in the line this year is Herm
Meistcr, new assistant coach. He played his football at St. Mary's
where he was captain and All-Coast tackle in 1935. He has coached
at Santa Clara and Cal. . . . Did you know that Chuck Taylor
coached wrestling, rugby and, later, the intramural program after
World War II here on Ihe Farm? . . . Washington State dedicated
last Saturday's game against SC to quarterback Bunny Aldrich who
remained at home while his young son was near death with heart
trouble. . . . Akin Tausau Harrington can really put on a sword
dancing act. . . . Stanford's Bob Reynolds, the only man to play
three complete Rose Bowl games 11934-3(5), in a story by Dick Hy
land in the Los Angeles Times said: "Stanford hasn't a prayer to
beat UCLA unless the Indians do a complete right-about-face. . . .
I simply cannot understand the Stanford letdowns." Well, Bob, they
did the about-face. What command should we give them next week
against the Ducks?
BEST COMEBACK OF THE SEASON: Uclan coach Red Sanders
blamed his 20-6 defeal by Stanford last Saturday mainly on the Asian j
flu. As to the significance it played on the outcome of the game, a
Stanford lineman was quoted as coming back with the remark: "I
didn't notice anybody sneezing in my lace."
Tli<* Hose Howl Decider
For the second time in one month, Stanford Stadium becomes the
site of what sport experts call "the game that will probably decide
the PCC's Rose Bowl team." The University of Oregon Ducks will
he trying to cinch that distinction this Saturday when they meet
Stanford in their 26th encounter of the series which began back in
1900.
This year the Oregonians bring with them what they consider
to ho their host team since 1920 the last time they made the trip
to Pasadena. They have a running powerhouse to go with one of
the best defensive units on the Coast—having led the PCC in Ihat de
partment for the past two years. This year Oregon will not be "duck
soup" for the Indians. The Webfoots have allowed less than a touch
down a game thus far this season 31 points in six games. They
hold a 5-1 season record with a 4-0 conference report card. Their
only loss was a respectable 0-3 setback to Pittsburgh in the last 20

seconds of the game. Victories
include Idaho, UCLA, San Jose
State, WSC and Cal.
Watch the speed of all thi-ee
Oregon running backs — half
hacks Jim Shanley and Charlie
Tourville and fullback Jack Mor
ris. Shanley is elusive while
Morris is a track-fast, power run
ner. Also watch for passes from
the left halfbacks who have
thrown more than 12 already.
Tourville is the loft half. On the
line look for the fine pass catch
ing of Ron Stover and the bone
crushing of Harry Mondale. The

i— 1 key to any I -attack is the leader
ship of the quarterback and the Ducks have one in .lack Crabtree '
who is a good runner and adequate passer.
In six games Oregon and Stanford have met three common op
ponents San Jose, UCLA and WSC. Oregon won all three while ihc
Indians lost only to WSC. But comparative scores mean nothing in
football, especially when so much is at stake as in a game like this.
Stanford has lost two games this season—the shellacking Rice ad
ministered the Cards and the WSC fluke. The game will probably
be rated even by most writers with any edge being given to the
Bucks. Against UCLA last weekend the Indians proved that they
can play top-notch football. Jack Douglas showed that he is an ex
cellent passer and an adequate runner. The line contained UCLA
when it counted, while the hitherto terrible pass defense was .just
short of fantabulous.
That Old Black Gas
This writer took "gas" last week in The Daily's 17 predictions by |
picking only eight winners. So with so much encouragement here
we go again. In the PCC race this coming weekend I pick UCLA
over Cal, Oregon State over Washington State, Washington over
SC. And in the most important game of the conference I pick Stan
ford to sidetrack Oregon's Rose Bowl-bound express. I leave you
with, the always, one last word of caution: WATCH OREGON;
THEY'RE GREEN AND YELLOW.
