# Minto Views Post Duties As Chaplain
## Stresses Importance Of Role as Counselor To Troubled Students 
### Diana Smith 
Chaplain of the University
Robert M. Minto views his func
tion in the University community
as at least twofold; he acts as a
general spiritual adviser to all
Stanford students of whatever
faith, and in addition is "Chap
lain of the University," a post in
volving a variety of duties.
In his counseling capacity Min
to is available to any student at
any time. He commented that
many students do appreciate the
chaplain's role in this respect,
hut probably not enough of them
do.
If students would feel free to
stop by his office when they are
only slightly perplexed about
something, instead of waiting
until faced with a major problem
which forces them to seek out
the chaplain as an extreme meas
ure, counseling could meet the
real needs of the student more
effectively, he said.
As University chaplain, Minto
is first of all the administrator of
all religious aflairs for the cam
pus, working as a University of
ficial.
Deeply Concerned
Also, he is deeply concerned
with what he terms "the general
spiritual welfare of the Univer
sity community," which involves
him in planning and executing
general policy in many phases of
campus life. And finally, there is
his work connected with Stan
ford Memorial Church.
Minto went on to talk about
Memorial Church as the center
of religious life at Stanford.
The 11 a.m. Sunday service is
only "the University officially at
worship," Minto explained. The
nature of the setting's size and
atmosphere indicates that it is a
rather formal service, and so the
church's other activities aim at a
more personal contact between
student and church, he said.
Daily Prayers
These include daily prayers at
10-a.m. and weekly Sunday morn
ing Holy Communion at 9 a.m.
The Wednesday night Candlelight
Service is now well established as
a campus institution, and recent
ly the west transept in the rear
of the church was set aside for
private meditation during the
day.
Minto pointed out that the
opening of the west transept is
a partial answer to the problems
encountered in a church which is
something of a museum as well
as a place of worship.
With Memorial Church as a
sort of "spiritual umbrella," said
Minto, there are many projects
that the various denominational
youth groups is currently inves
tigating these common interests.
Memorial Church's expanding
program is part of a nationwide
upsurgence of student interest in
worship, the chaplain comment
ed.
Important Activity
The most important religious
activity of every Stanford stu
dent is "to work in the University
community, keeping his religious
spirit and views," he emphasized.
Religion cannot be divorced
from the rest, of the college ex
perience, he continued, and there
is always some danger of Memo
rial Church's program not taking
its proper place in campus life
unless it involves people of wide
interests in activities which re
late to their everyday life.
Minto quoted Rev. Outler of
the Perkins School of Theology
at Southern Methodist Univer
sity, who was a guest preacher
here Oct. (>, as saying, "This is
the finest service of worship in
any university chapel in the
country, and the easiest church
for a visitor to preach in. because
of its responsive congregation."
The chaplain added that Canon
Bryan Green said last year he
prefers preaching at Stanford
rather than any other American
university, for substantially the
same reasons.
