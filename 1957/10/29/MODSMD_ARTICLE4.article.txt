# Gov. Knight Denies Report of Quitting Race; Leaves State
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (ZP)â€”Governor
Knight took off yesterday for an
out-of-state vacation, after deny
ing reports he is dropping out of
the governorship race to avoid a
fight with Sen. William Knowland
in California's Republican prima
ry next June.
Replying to mounting specula
tion he would either accept a fed
eral appointment or become a can
didate for Knowland's U.S. Sen
ate seat, Knight said in a press
statement:
"My political plan s are un
changed. I am a candidate to suc
ceed myself as governor of Cali
fornia." He promised a "crusad
ing campaign."
But he didn't as he has several
times in the past say flatly that
he wouldn't accept a federal ap
pointment. Nor did he appear to
completely rule out the chance he
may run for the U.S. Senate.
As to speculation "that. I had
agreed to drop out of the gover
nor's race so that Senator Know
land could be spared the risk of
contesting for the Republican
nomination," Knight declared:
"These reports are untrue."
