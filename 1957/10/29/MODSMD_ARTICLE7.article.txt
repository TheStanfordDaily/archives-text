UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/Pi-
Britain accused the Soviet Union
yesterday of trying to dominate
the Arab world "by every mis
chievous and dangerous means
short of war." It urged the United
Nations to remain calm in the
face of "this whole Soviet hulla
baloo."
Britain, Turkey and other Bagh
dad Pact members replied in the
82-nation UN General Assembly
to Soviet-Syrian charges that Tur
key is about to launch war in the
Middle East.
Amid I lie third round of bitter
Middle East debate. Communist
Yugoslavia's Jo/.a Brilej called
upon the big powers to stop ex
changing threats over the Middle
East crisis. "A chain reaction ap
pears to have been generated that
may well carry us further than
the worst protagonist may wish,"
lie declared.
Turkey proclaimed its determi-
I nation to remain in the Baghdad
j and NATO alliances and described
as "fantastic" accusations by So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gro
myko that the United States is
encouraging Turkey to attack
Syria.
Comdr. Allan Noble, British
minister of state for foreign af
fairs, told the Assembly that the
Soviet Union wants to shake Tur
j key's adherence to NATO and the
j Baghdad Pact and to dominate the
! Arab world.
"If Arabs could really be
brought to believe that Syria was
menaced by invasion from Tur
key, and had been saved from this
menace by Soviet intervention,
great benefits would accrue to
I the Soviet Union, and the position
I of the Arab friends of Turkey and
I the Western world would be
i gravely shaken," Noble declared.
