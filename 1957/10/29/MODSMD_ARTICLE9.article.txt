# Disgrace Seen For Zhukov
## 
### 
LONDON, Tuesday (#>) — Mar-.
| shal Georgi K. Zhukov, Russia's j
J hero of Berlin, seemed headed to-!
| day for political oblivion.
Reports reaching here from 1
I Moscow indicated he has been '
fired from the ruling Presidium
of the Soviet Communist Party
I and is facing official disgrace.
These reports are completely j
j unofficial. They come from mem-!
bers of Western diplomatic mis
sions in Moscow. But indications '
I were that Soviet Communist Par- j
j ty boss Nikita S. Khrushchev had
called an urgent meeting of the i
| party Central Committee, prob-j
j ably to affirm Zhukov'S" ouster as i
I defense minister.
Repeat Show
II was considered possible that I
j Khrushchev was repeating his
! performance of last June, when
j he summoned the full party Cen
! tral Committee to confirm the
; purge of Georgi Malenkov, Lazar
i Kaganovieh and V. M. Molotov
j from their high party and gov
! ernment posts. Khrushchev ap
! parently had been outvoted in
I the Presidium—then a nine-mem
' ber Politburo—but a hasty meet
ing of the Central Committee!
backed him and turned the tide |
j against those accused of being I
! part of an "anti-party group."
It seemed likely Khrushchev
: was calling the signals again and I
this might mean a new shakeup
in the Kremlin hierarchy. There
was some speculation that a
place was being cleared for Zhu
kov, but this idea was fast losing j
favor among Westerners who j
scented disgrace in the portents j
surrounding Zhukov's dismissal. [
Basic Charge
The basic charge against Zhu- :
kov, fired Saturday as Soviet de- j
fense minister and head of all the .
armed forces, is that he hindered
| the work of the Communist Par- :
i ty's organization among the mili- 1
tary, a dispatch from Moscow to
! London's Communist Daily Work- j
| er said.
Zhukov is known to have op-1
posed bitterly the system of po- j
litical commissar's in the army.
He considered them to be inter
| fering with the army's authority
while they served as spies and j
whiplashes for the Communist
Party.
Censorship blocked correspond-1
ents' efforts to file any hard;
news from Moscow. It appeared
to be the most thorough censor
-1 ship invoked since the Stalin era. |

Zhukov is known to have op-1
posed bitterly the system of po- j
litical commissar's in the army.
He considered them to be inter
| fering with the army's authority
while they served as spies and j
whiplashes for the Communist
Party.
Censorship blocked correspond-1
ents' efforts to file any hard;
news from Moscow. It appeared
to be the most thorough censor

LONDON, Tuesday (#>) — Mar-.

J hero of Berlin, seemed headed to-!

Reports reaching here from 1
I Moscow indicated he has been '
fired from the ruling Presidium
of the Soviet Communist Party
I and is facing official disgrace.
These reports are completely j
j unofficial. They come from mem-!
bers of Western diplomatic mis
sions in Moscow. But indications '
I were that Soviet Communist Par- j
j ty boss Nikita S. Khrushchev had
called an urgent meeting of the i
| party Central Committee, prob-j
j ably to affirm Zhukov'S" ouster as i
I defense minister.

j from their high party and gov

backed him and turned the tide |
j against those accused of being I
! part of an "anti-party group."
It seemed likely Khrushchev
: was calling the signals again and I
this might mean a new shakeup
in the Kremlin hierarchy. There
was some speculation that a
place was being cleared for Zhu
kov, but this idea was fast losing j
favor among Westerners who j
scented disgrace in the portents j
surrounding Zhukov's dismissal. [
