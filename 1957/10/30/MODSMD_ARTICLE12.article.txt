# Williamson: Communication Basis of Peace
## 
### 
"World peace is extremely im
portant, and the foundation for
peace is the communication with
many peoples of the world. The
State Department should encour
age rather than discourage travel
to such places as China."
So said Earl Richard William
son, one of 41 Americans who
toured Communist China this
summer, at the first regular
meeting of the Political Union in
Cubberley Auditorium yesterday
afternoon. The talk was spon
sored in co-operation with the
lIR.
Williamson, admittedly on the
defensive, agreed when ques
tioned that the right to travel
anywhere in the world brings ob
ligations.
"It is difficult to consider the
many implications of this right,"
he observed. "The only definite
act of the State Department,
while recommending Ihat we not
go, was to say they would take
our passports. They said we!
'might' violate the trading with I
the enemy act. I don't think the
exchange of ideas can be inter
preted as violating this act."
The State Department has said t
it will return his passport, the
speaker added.
Science Grant
Williamson, who is attending
Stanford on a National Science
Foundation grant, outlined brief
ly his participation in the Mos
cow Youth Festival and his tour
through the Soviet. Union and
China.
While showing slides of his
travels, Williamson commented,
"You know the bad about China,
so I hope you'll forgive me for
not bringing it up again."
Williamson said the American
flag was greeted with cheers
when unfurled upon the group's
arrival in one Chinese eitv. "The
people knew we were obviously
friendly observers. They obvi
ously want the U.S. to recognize
Communist China."
When queried as to (he politi
cal inclinations of the American'
delegation, the speaker said the'
Chinese and Russians were im
pressed by the heterogeneous
group. "All were red-blooded
Americans and included a mod
est group of conservatives
along."
"What I Saw"
"I could wander about the
streets as I pleased, and I did,"
Williamson explained, in reply to
the question, "Did he feel he saw
only the best in China, the frost
ing on the cake." "I can only tell
you what I saw," he said, "just
as you can tell what you see j
when walking down an American
street."
Williamson said he does not
feel his trip will have any serious
repercussions on his teaching ca
reer. "I intend to apply for a
teaching position again, and 1
may be optimistic, but I think I'll
get one."

afternoon. The talk was spon
sored in co-operation with the
lIR.
Williamson, admittedly on the
defensive, agreed when ques
tioned that the right to travel
anywhere in the world brings ob
ligations.
"It is difficult to consider the
many implications of this right,"
he observed. "The only definite
act of the State Department,
while recommending Ihat we not
go, was to say they would take
our passports. They said we!
'might' violate the trading with I
the enemy act. I don't think the
exchange of ideas can be inter
preted as violating this act."
The State Department has said t
it will return his passport, the
speaker added.
Science Grant
Williamson, who is attending
Stanford on a National Science
Foundation grant, outlined brief
ly his participation in the Mos
cow Youth Festival and his tour
through the Soviet. Union and
China.
While showing slides of his
travels, Williamson commented,
"You know the bad about China,
so I hope you'll forgive me for
not bringing it up again."
Williamson said the American
flag was greeted with cheers
when unfurled upon the group's
arrival in one Chinese eitv. "The
people knew we were obviously
friendly observers. They obvi
ously want the U.S. to recognize
Communist China."
When queried as to (he politi
cal inclinations of the American'
delegation, the speaker said the'
Chinese and Russians were im
pressed by the heterogeneous
group. "All were red-blooded
Americans and included a mod
est group of conservatives
along."
"What I Saw"
"I could wander about the
streets as I pleased, and I did,"
Williamson explained, in reply to
the question, "Did he feel he saw
only the best in China, the frost
ing on the cake." "I can only tell
you what I saw," he said, "just
as you can tell what you see j
when walking down an American
street."
Williamson said he does not
feel his trip will have any serious
repercussions on his teaching ca
reer. "I intend to apply for a
teaching position again, and 1
may be optimistic, but I think I'll
get one."
"World peace is extremely im
portant, and the foundation for
peace is the communication with
many peoples of the world. The
State Department should encour
age rather than discourage travel
to such places as China."
So said Earl Richard William
son, one of 41 Americans who
toured Communist China this
summer, at the first regular
