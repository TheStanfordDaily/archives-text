# Light Is Shed On Revolution
## Former Imperial Ambassador Dies; Researchers Unveil 30-Year Legacy 
### Stew Toy, Associate Editor 
A huge collection of "destroyed" Tsarist Russian secret polico
files, so vast that their scope and importance are not yet known,
were opened publicly by Hoover Institution for the first time yes
terday after 31 years of gathering campus dust.
The dossiers and other materials, called "unique in the world," afr>

a veritable "Who's Who" of the
Russian revolutionary movement.
Packed in 16 large wooden
crates, the papers contain, among
other things, a complete list of
every "wanted" Russian criminal
and political figure from 1883 to
1917.
"This is the only Russian police
archive of any magnitude acces
sible to scholars outside the So
viet Union," according to Witold
Sworakowski, assistant director
of Hoover Institution in charge of
eastern European collections.
"It will unquestionably prove to
be a mother lode of knowledge on
the crucial years leading to the
overthrow of the Romanovs in
March 1917," he said.
Intrigue
History of the dossiers and their
secret shipment from Paris to
Stanford in 1926 is as shaded with
intrigue as the 1917 revolution it
self.
The files were begun in 1883 by
the Paris branch of the Imperial
secret police, the "Okhrana,"
whose agents watched the activi
ties of Russian revolutionaries in
western Europe.
Failure of the Russian revolu
tion attempt in 1905 forced a
swarm of political emigres into
western European countries.
Their organizational and ideologi
cal preparations and their illegal
publications, which they smug
gled into Russia by the thousands,
laid the groundwork for the suc
cessful revolution of 1917.
"The Paris office of the Okh
rana was assigned to collect infor
mation on all this activity and the
individuals connected with il and
to report it to St. Petersburg,"
Sworakowski said.
Office Sealed
When in March 1917 the Rus
sian Tsarist government was over
thrown, the office of the Paris
Okhrana, benefiting from diplo
matic immunity, was closed and
sealed under the custody of Basil
Maklakoff, last Imperial ambas
sador to France.
U n (I e r pressure of demands
cabled to St. Petersburg by Rus
sians in western Europe, who for
years had been persecuted by the
Okhrana, the provisional govern
ment. of Russia created an inter
i party committee to study the files.
"The main objective was the ex
j posure of secret agents among
the Russian emigres, who, for a
I handsome salary from the Okh
rana, spied upon their political
friends," Sworakowski said.
< oinmission Disbanded
But the investigation was cut
short when the Bolsheviks sci/ed
power in November 1917. The
commission was disbanded and
'the Okhrana rooms in the Paris
embassy were again sealed.
Finally in 1921 France recog
nized the Soviet regime. The em
bassy building and its contents
| were to be turned over to Russian
| emissa ries.
Maklakoff realized the great
value that the papers held for suc
ceeding generations and was will

ing to take the risk of deceiving
the Communists in order that the
dossiers would not be swallowed
up in Russia.
The Hoover War Library, estab
lished in 1919, had sent a collect
ing agent to Europe to gather in
formation on the revolution from
emigres fleeing the Bolsheviks.
He contacted Maklakoff and, with
the aid of Herbert Hoover, man
aged to have the dossiers shipped
to Stanford.
Files "Burned"
Maklakoff told the Soviet gov
ernment that the files had been
burned.
"All the evidence we have been
able to find indicates that the
Reds accepted Maklakoff's state
ment that he burned the papers,"
Sworakowski said. "In fact, they
were probably relieved to think
that they had been destroyed and
are unaware that this material
exists and is now being opened.
He told The Daily that Stanford
was the logical place to send tlr
papers.
"At that time the Hoover li
brary was the only one in 111*'
world interested in them." he said.
"Harvard library's Russian stud
ies section was interested only in
literature and culture, not in poli
tics. Not even the Library of Con
gress was interested."
Maklakoff gave the code name
"Tagil," the name of a Siberian
village, to the shipping opera
tion. He bound each of the 500-
pound packing boxes with wire
and fastened the ends togeth >
with lead seals impressed with hi.;
initials on one side and "Tagil" on
the other.
His only stipulation was tl il
the 16 crates remain unopened
until his death to protect him
j from Communist retributive
! measures.
The crates were put in the base
ment of the Stanford Museum.
After the Hoover Institution's 285-
foot tower was completed in 1911,
they were transferred to a stor
age room on the top floor, under
the cupola.
And then their existence was
j apparently forgotten. Sworakow
| ski, who has been at Hoover 10
years, said neither he nor any
other Institution researcher knew
any tiling about the boxes until re
cent years.
"Death Clause"
He said he discovered them a
few years ago when French au
thorities asked him for informa
tion on one of the men whose dos
sier is in the collection. He in
< vestigated and found Maklakoff's
| contract with emeritus history
! professor Ralph Haswell Lutz,
containing the death clause. But
lhe contents of the boxes were
still unknown.
Maklakoff died last July in
Switzerland at the age of 86. He
had been attached to the French
ministry of foreign affairs.
Hoover Institution scholars have
thus far opened live of the boxes
and have given the contents a
hurried examination.
Fat Folders
What they have found princi
pally are dozens of fat folders,
each belted with a cloth strap and
buckle, containing detailed rec
ords of the activities of Russian
| revolutionaries in western Eu-
I rope.
"Already we have found files
on Trotsky, Molotov and Pilsud
ski," Sworakowski said. "I have
no doubt but that we shall find
material on Lenin, Stalin and oth
er leading men of the revolution."
The material in the boxes will
have to be inventoried and organ
ized before it will become avail
able for research, Sworakowski
added.
No Money
lie said this might take a year
and a half, after funds for the job
are obtained. Hoover Institution
director C. Easton Rothwell is
now in New York investigating
possibilities for a research grant.
Sworakowski said possession of
the files puts Stanford in a
"unique position in the world."
1 He said the present "Big Five" of
S Russian Revolution research are
j Stanford, Harvard, Columbia, the
Library of Congress and the New
York City Public Library.
He said the papers present "so
many possibilities for research I
can't say what they will be used
for. They cover such a broad field
it would be ridiculous to predict
their future use."
