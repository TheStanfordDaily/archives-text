# No Legislation for PCC
## 
### 
r l hf. ItoNF.Uif subcommittee of the California
Slate Assembly is currently al work in San
Francisco trying to solve a very difficult prob
lem that of learning what, if any, steps the
slate might hike to safeguard ihe interests of
California members of the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
Insofar as llie bearings are attempting to
clear I be air over the PCC situation and insofar
as they are attempting to bring to light facts
w 11i«• 11 have been bidden, and should be known,
we applaud the Bonelli subcommittee.
There can be no doubt that bad feelings and
misunderstandings do exist among the nine
conference schools. If, then, lhe investigation
can even in some small way serve to lessen
some of the animosity and misunderstandings,
then il will have provided a valuable service.
Il may then be possible for the conference
members, upon having a more complete under
standing of each other's motives and ideas, to
<.'<' l together and work out an amicable solution
to a serious problem.
\\ e question, however, the wisdom of the
guiding purpose of the committee — making
recommendations for legislative action to gov
ern the conduct of California schools in the
PCC.
I lie state, of course, will be looking out for
the best interests of the University of Califor
nia and UCLA, the two conference members
il supports. But iu seeking to do what is best
for these two schools we question whether the
state would be doing what is best for the other
seven schools—five state universities and col
leges from the Northwest and two private
schools in California.
We think, rather, that the state should allow
the administrative officials of UCLA and Cali
fornia to continue working with the adminis-
Mfr

trators of the other schools toward either solv
ing the PCC controversy or dissolving the con
ference. If the state of California steps into
the problem with legislation, it will only create
another series of hurdles for officials already
working on the situation.
One other outgrowth of the investigation
also upsets us—the statement by chairman
Bonelli that lie favors a California Conference
made up of the "Big Four*' plus Santa Clara,
San Jose Stale, St. Mary's, Loyola and other
schools in the state.
Certainly this would not be feasible for foot
ball. Some of the named schools don't even
play football currently, and those other than
I lie "Big Four" who do play aren't in the same
class as the larger schools. For basketball, the
other sport played conference-wide in the PCC,
a conference of this type would he no improve
ment over the PCC setup.
Few will argue that the round-robin basket
ball plan has been very successful from the
competitive standpoint. Financially, too, it
has helped the southern schools, who now gel
to plav before the large crowds of the North
west. Crowd - wise, a California Conference
would suffer simply because there aren't
enough big pavilions in the state.
Artistically, we doubt that competition
among the small and large of California schools
would be as close as that of the evenly-matched
PCC. As we see it, then, why form a football
league when half of the schools don't even plav
football? And win form a basketball loop that
wouldn I be as good as the existing circuit?
TX e say, too, more power to the Bonelli sub
committee for bringing facts to light, but less
power to them in regard to recommending
legislative action concerning the PCC.
