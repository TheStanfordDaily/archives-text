Manifestations of Interest
Editor, The Daily:
I read with great interest the two letters which
appeared in your Monday edition, because they
are the first manifestations of interest in prob
lems of very great importance by some students
here at Stanford, and I would like to add a few
comments.
I sympathize greatly with the Hungarian stu
dent, and I realize what Communism means to
him (something that most car-possessing, care
free students here at Stanford will never feel).
And I agree with several things Mr. Smith has
written. I, too, am as much against Communism
as he, and I, too, think that only a few realize the
sacrifices whirh 33,000 American boys made in
Korea.
Rut surely this was not the real issue in the
trip undertaken by the American students into
Communist China. Horrible as life under dicta
torship may be, the question at stake was: "Has
an American citizen, of a nation that prides itself
on its freedom, the right to explore and sec what
lie wants or can the government tell him what
7iot to see?"
Whether we like it or not, Communist China is

here to stay; ignoring it will not cause it to dis
appear. And every American, if ho so wishes,
ought to he left free 1o visit it. even though he
may be doing so at his own risk—for the U.S.
government, entertaining no relations with Com
munist China, will not be able to protect him.
This question really brings under examination
at least one aspect of American life, which is hard
not to notice when coming from Europe: con
formity. Individualism is hard to find, even in a
university where free thoughts should be stimu
lated and encouraged as much as possible. Men
here know what are the "things to do"—the same
for all—and few try to follow their own inclina
tions. But what is pertinent here is that most
men also know what they should and should not
think, for holding certain views may cost a man
his job and his reputation.
Is this complete freedom of thought? No, this
is what constitutes the real issue in this contro
versy. For should not every American hold his
own views rather than believe in what the gov
ernment officially tells him? I think the answer
is yes. After all, isn't the suppression of free
thought one of the main accusations about Com
munism?
