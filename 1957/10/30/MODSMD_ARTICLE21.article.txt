# General Studies Program Bulletin Published Explaining Requirements
## 
### 
A new General Studies Pro
gram bulletin which gives de
tailed information on all general
studies requirements is available
this year.
Dr. Robert S. Walker, chair
man of the General Studies Com
mittee, explained that the new
booklet is not a change from the
General Studies Program initiat
ed at Stanford last year. The
booklet's purpose is to give stu
dents a clearer idea of their re
quirements and how they may
fulfill them.
The new booklet lists all gen
eral studies courses and their

scope, reading requirements and |
prerequisites.
Although there are not enough
copies at present to distribute to !
the entire student body, refer- !
ence copies are available in the!
Main Library and the General |
Studies Office.
Dr. Walker stressed that Stan- j
ford's study of undergraduate ed-1
ucation is not completed with this
booklet. The program is a con-;
tinuous review and the General
Studies Committee is continuing
its studies on admissions, student ;
incentives and undergraduate re- j
quirements.
