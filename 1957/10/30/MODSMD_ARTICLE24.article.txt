The Day for Praise
"Nino out of (on football players in California are great, and tho
tenth one goes to Stanford and the same for the girls." Quote the
UCLA head yell leader during last Saturday's game.
Just goes to show you that there's always a big foot around to
shove in your month when you open it too wide. And this young
man probably has an aching set of jaws right now.
Saturday's win over UCLA was really a three-way victory. Re
sides the one which took place over a span of four quarters on the
floor of the bowl, two more took place at halflime. One by the Stan
ford Band on the field, and one by Rally Com and the card stunt
section in the stands.
I'm forced to disagree with co-worker Frank Huntress and his
impression of what took place on Saturday, and to side with Editor
VVally Simpson in praising those who were responsible.
Card stunts were excellent, one of the most impressive arrays I
have ever seen. Dick Stanford and his crew incorporated the theme

provided by the Stanford Band
into the attractively enlarged sec
tion for some very unusual ef
fects. Granted, the UCLA section
may have been good, but I'll stick
by my contention that Stanford
was better.
And the band itself put on one
of its best performances, too. A
clever idea, combined with some
darn good arrangements and
nicely executed formations Ihey
looked and sounded superior to
Ihe "we've got Hollywood ar
rangements" aggregation from
Westwood.
Putting on a good half time j
show means a lot to these people. j
It's equally as important to them ;
as playing a good game is to the 112
team. They deserve praise when {
they do a good job, and last Sat
urday was a good job.
BUT TWO OBJECTIONS:
Where's the tree that used to
grow up in the middle of the ex
panding "S"? For heaven's sake, 5
put it hack it looked good there. ;
And, the card stunts could have j
started .just a bit later and j
would have coincided much bet- |
ler with the band's show. j
Here we go again, Frank! Al
-1 hough there have been many
comments about Head Yell Lead
er Ed Bordenkircher, T want to
lie the first one to say he's one
of the most sincere, ambitious
guys I know.
I )oing a good job means a lot
to Ed, and a great deal of his *
pare time is spent in trying io
do things better than they have
ever been done before. And an-

ni hop ihing is sometimes overlooked: A good rooting seel ion can
make a lousy yell leader look good, then praise him: and a poor
one make the best yell leader look bad, and criticize him. Shoe fit?
Tie the laces, 1 hen!
AND MORE PRAISE YET: This time to another tremendous
guy. Timm Williams! Mean anything to you? Then try Chief Light
tool, and ! hope thai does! "That Indian," as he'll unaffectionalely
Known lo some people around hero, is really one of Stanford's most
famous personalities.
Taken Too Mnrh for (irantfel?
Perhaps it's because we see a lot of the Chief lhal we are inclined
to overlook the things he does. But if that is Irue, we are the only
people who do. Everywhere around the conference he is known as
•tanford's Indian a real Indian who does real Indian dances in real
Indian war-paint and in a real Indian costume.
He's as famous to some as the John Brodies, Bobby Garrett's and
oilier great Stanford athletic names. But to a good many of us he
is "that Indian." Perhaps if we had to replace him with a local joker
wealing a papier-mache head and a costume-shop outfit he'd begin
1o lake on more significance.
Light foot is Stanford's Indian by his own volition, it's true, and
the reason he is such is because he thinks so much of Stanford and
its students and faculty. In return his only compensation is free
entry to home games, and a trip or two away. Enough, you say?
Well, maybe, but I don't think so. Many people get into Stanford
Stadium for free and they don't: do half as much as the Chief.
Let's honor him somehow. The next time you watch him remem
ber that those are actually Indian victory, prayer and war dances
done by a fellow with a real sense of humor and pride. The Yurok
Injun travels some miles every Saturday lo be Stanford's Indian.
Applaud him, show him you appreciate him, if you do and you
should.
And if the band and Rally Com arc looking for another theme for
another halftime some day I'm offering this one! A Tribute to Stan
lord's Indian. Chief Lightfoot. A joy to know, a pleasure to watch.
A Stanford fan to rank with the reddest and tho hottest.

Perhaps it's because we see a lot of the Chief lhal we are inclined
to overlook the things he does. But if that is Irue, we are the only
people who do. Everywhere around the conference he is known as
•tanford's Indian a real Indian who does real Indian dances in real
Indian war-paint and in a real Indian costume.
He's as famous to some as the John Brodies, Bobby Garrett's and
oilier great Stanford athletic names. But to a good many of us he
is "that Indian." Perhaps if we had to replace him with a local joker
wealing a papier-mache head and a costume-shop outfit he'd begin
1o lake on more significance.
Light foot is Stanford's Indian by his own volition, it's true, and
the reason he is such is because he thinks so much of Stanford and
its students and faculty. In return his only compensation is free
entry to home games, and a trip or two away. Enough, you say?
Well, maybe, but I don't think so. Many people get into Stanford
Stadium for free and they don't: do half as much as the Chief.
Let's honor him somehow. The next time you watch him remem
ber that those are actually Indian victory, prayer and war dances
done by a fellow with a real sense of humor and pride. The Yurok
Injun travels some miles every Saturday lo be Stanford's Indian.
Applaud him, show him you appreciate him, if you do and you
should.
And if the band and Rally Com arc looking for another theme for

CHIEF LIGHTFOOT

The Day for Praise
"Nino out of (on football players in California are great, and tho
tenth one goes to Stanford and the same for the girls." Quote the
UCLA head yell leader during last Saturday's game.
Just goes to show you that there's always a big foot around to
shove in your month when you open it too wide. And this young
man probably has an aching set of jaws right now.
Saturday's win over UCLA was really a three-way victory. Re
sides the one which took place over a span of four quarters on the
floor of the bowl, two more took place at halflime. One by the Stan
ford Band on the field, and one by Rally Com and the card stunt
section in the stands.
I'm forced to disagree with co-worker Frank Huntress and his
impression of what took place on Saturday, and to side with Editor
VVally Simpson in praising those who were responsible.
Card stunts were excellent, one of the most impressive arrays I
have ever seen. Dick Stanford and his crew incorporated the theme

provided by the Stanford Band
into the attractively enlarged sec
tion for some very unusual ef
fects. Granted, the UCLA section
may have been good, but I'll stick
by my contention that Stanford
was better.
And the band itself put on one
of its best performances, too. A
clever idea, combined with some
darn good arrangements and
nicely executed formations Ihey
looked and sounded superior to
Ihe "we've got Hollywood ar
rangements" aggregation from
Westwood.
Putting on a good half time j
show means a lot to these people. j
It's equally as important to them ;
as playing a good game is to the 112
team. They deserve praise when {
they do a good job, and last Sat
urday was a good job.
BUT TWO OBJECTIONS:
Where's the tree that used to
grow up in the middle of the ex
panding "S"? For heaven's sake, 5
put it hack it looked good there. ;
And, the card stunts could have j
started .just a bit later and j
would have coincided much bet- |
ler with the band's show. j
Here we go again, Frank! Al
-1 hough there have been many
comments about Head Yell Lead
er Ed Bordenkircher, T want to
lie the first one to say he's one

sides the one which took place over a span of four quarters on the
floor of the bowl, two more took place at halflime. One by the Stan
ford Band on the field, and one by Rally Com and the card stunt
section in the stands.
I'm forced to disagree with co-worker Frank Huntress and his
impression of what took place on Saturday, and to side with Editor
VVally Simpson in praising those who were responsible.
Card stunts were excellent, one of the most impressive arrays I
have ever seen. Dick Stanford and his crew incorporated the theme

provided by the Stanford Band
into the attractively enlarged sec
tion for some very unusual ef
fects. Granted, the UCLA section
may have been good, but I'll stick
by my contention that Stanford
was better.
And the band itself put on one
of its best performances, too. A
clever idea, combined with some
darn good arrangements and
nicely executed formations Ihey
looked and sounded superior to
Ihe "we've got Hollywood ar
rangements" aggregation from
Westwood.
Putting on a good half time j
show means a lot to these people. j
It's equally as important to them ;
as playing a good game is to the 112
team. They deserve praise when {
they do a good job, and last Sat
urday was a good job.
BUT TWO OBJECTIONS:
Where's the tree that used to
grow up in the middle of the ex
panding "S"? For heaven's sake, 5
put it hack it looked good there. ;
And, the card stunts could have j
started .just a bit later and j
would have coincided much bet- |
ler with the band's show. j
Here we go again, Frank! Al
-1 hough there have been many
comments about Head Yell Lead
er Ed Bordenkircher, T want to
lie the first one to say he's one
of the most sincere, ambitious
guys I know.
I )oing a good job means a lot
to Ed, and a great deal of his *
pare time is spent in trying io
do things better than they have
ever been done before. And an-

ni hop ihing is sometimes overlooked: A good rooting seel ion can
make a lousy yell leader look good, then praise him: and a poor
one make the best yell leader look bad, and criticize him. Shoe fit?
Tie the laces, 1 hen!
AND MORE PRAISE YET: This time to another tremendous
guy. Timm Williams! Mean anything to you? Then try Chief Light
tool, and ! hope thai does! "That Indian," as he'll unaffectionalely
Known lo some people around hero, is really one of Stanford's most
famous personalities.
Taken Too Mnrh for (irantfel?
Perhaps it's because we see a lot of the Chief lhal we are inclined
to overlook the things he does. But if that is Irue, we are the only
people who do. Everywhere around the conference he is known as
•tanford's Indian a real Indian who does real Indian dances in real
Indian war-paint and in a real Indian costume.
He's as famous to some as the John Brodies, Bobby Garrett's and
oilier great Stanford athletic names. But to a good many of us he
is "that Indian." Perhaps if we had to replace him with a local joker
wealing a papier-mache head and a costume-shop outfit he'd begin
1o lake on more significance.
Light foot is Stanford's Indian by his own volition, it's true, and
the reason he is such is because he thinks so much of Stanford and
its students and faculty. In return his only compensation is free
entry to home games, and a trip or two away. Enough, you say?
Well, maybe, but I don't think so. Many people get into Stanford
Stadium for free and they don't: do half as much as the Chief.
Let's honor him somehow. The next time you watch him remem
ber that those are actually Indian victory, prayer and war dances
done by a fellow with a real sense of humor and pride. The Yurok
Injun travels some miles every Saturday lo be Stanford's Indian.
Applaud him, show him you appreciate him, if you do and you
should.
And if the band and Rally Com arc looking for another theme for
another halftime some day I'm offering this one! A Tribute to Stan
lord's Indian. Chief Lightfoot. A joy to know, a pleasure to watch.
A Stanford fan to rank with the reddest and tho hottest.


CHIEF LIGHTFOOT

The Day for Praise
"Nino out of (on football players in California are great, and tho
tenth one goes to Stanford and the same for the girls." Quote the
UCLA head yell leader during last Saturday's game.
Just goes to show you that there's always a big foot around to
shove in your month when you open it too wide. And this young
man probably has an aching set of jaws right now.
