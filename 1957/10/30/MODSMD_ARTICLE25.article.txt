# Indian-Duck Clash a PCC Crucial
## Oregon Astride PCC Standings With 4-0 Mark 
### 
What may be The Crucial of
the 10,"57 Pacific Coast grid race j
will unfold Saturday at 1:30 p.m.!
in Sianforcl Stadium when 'he
"Rising to New Heights" Indians
take on the surprising Oregon |
Ducks.
Oregon, picked at Ihe start of;
the season as the dark horse j
team of the PCC, has turned out i
to be a darned fast dark horse.
The Ducks currently reign atop i
the PCC grid standings, and are |
ihe only team to boast an unblem-1
ished conference record. Stan-1
ford, meanwhile, is reposing in j
third place with a 2-1 mark in
loop action.
5-1 Record
Thus far in the '57 campaign, ;
Len Casanova's Ducks have
bumped off UCLA. 21-0; Wash
ington State, 14-13; California, j
24-6; and Idaho, 9-6. Tn non-loop
play, the Eugenians have clouted 1
San Jose State, 20-0, and lost to !
Pittsburgh in the last 22 seconds, 1
6-3.
The encounter represents a
crucial in the coast grid race pri-!
marily because it is the only j
game left on the card that
matches teams which have not
lost at least two PCC games.
A victory for Oregon would i
leave them 5-0 with USC, Wash
ington and Oregon State left to
play. Even with losses to two of
those three, the Ducks would j
more than likely grab a share
of first place.
Si I Win Would Cause Jam-up
An Indian win, on the other j
hand, would nicely scramble the
standings, leaving the Cards, i
Ducks and Cougars each with
one loss unless Washington 1
State loses to Oregon State Sat-1
u relay.
Stanford, of course, prefersj
that the latter situation prevail.
With this end in mind yesterday.
Chuck Ta y lor' s men went
through the usual Tuesday pat
tern of setting defenses and run
ning offensive plays.
The report from Connie .Jarvis' j
training quarters was that Troy j
Barbee and Russ Steele would
probably play Saturday. Both
were suited up and went through
unlimbering yesterday. Don Ma
noukian sat out the contact por
tion of the drill because of treat
ment he is undergoing for a
chronic tendonitis in his ankle.
It was announced by Don Lie
bendorfer that beginning tomor
row and for Ihe remainder of the
week. Hie Stanford workouts j
would be closed to all visitors ex- i
eept newspapermen.

What may be The Crucial of
the 10,"57 Pacific Coast grid race j
will unfold Saturday at 1:30 p.m.!
in Sianforcl Stadium when 'he
"Rising to New Heights" Indians
take on the surprising Oregon |
Ducks.
Oregon, picked at Ihe start of;
the season as the dark horse j
team of the PCC, has turned out i
to be a darned fast dark horse.
The Ducks currently reign atop i
the PCC grid standings, and are |
ihe only team to boast an unblem-1
ished conference record. Stan-1
ford, meanwhile, is reposing in j
third place with a 2-1 mark in
loop action.
5-1 Record
Thus far in the '57 campaign, ;
Len Casanova's Ducks have
bumped off UCLA. 21-0; Wash
ington State, 14-13; California, j
24-6; and Idaho, 9-6. Tn non-loop
play, the Eugenians have clouted 1
San Jose State, 20-0, and lost to !
Pittsburgh in the last 22 seconds, 1
6-3.
The encounter represents a
crucial in the coast grid race pri-!
marily because it is the only j
game left on the card that
matches teams which have not
lost at least two PCC games.
A victory for Oregon would i
leave them 5-0 with USC, Wash
ington and Oregon State left to
play. Even with losses to two of
those three, the Ducks would j
more than likely grab a share
of first place.
Si I Win Would Cause Jam-up
An Indian win, on the other j
hand, would nicely scramble the
standings, leaving the Cards, i
Ducks and Cougars each with
one loss unless Washington 1
State loses to Oregon State Sat-1
u relay.
Stanford, of course, prefersj
that the latter situation prevail.
With this end in mind yesterday.
