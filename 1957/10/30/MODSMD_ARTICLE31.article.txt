Three backs who toil long and
hard every Saturday afternoon
and probably have to because
there's no one to relieve them
are the top individual offense per
formers in major college football.
Consistent but unspectacular
Bob Winters of Utah State leads
the total offense table in the NC
AA service bureau statistics for
the fifth straight week with 916
yards. Versatile, hard-running
Bob Stransky of Colorado leads
in rushing at 689 and is second in
total offense, and Billy Baker of
Furman. with a great day against
the Citadel, has taken the lead in
passing from Winters.
These three represent an un
usual situation in the NCAA sta
tistical races. Of the three teams

they represent, only Colorado is;
Dii the winning side with a 3-2-L
record.
