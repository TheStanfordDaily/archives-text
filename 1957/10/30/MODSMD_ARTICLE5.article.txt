## Africans Not Bound to West, Paris Library Head Declares 
### 
A warning that the West must wake up to the situation if it is to
win the support of the peoples of Africa was issued by Dr. Lan
Forbes Fraser, director of the American Library in Paris, who spoke
last night at the regular Tuesday Evening Series talk in Memorial
Auditorium.
"Despite ties with France, there is no reason the Africans should

support the free world," a near
capacity audience heard Dr. Fra
ser say.
"We have a double enemy in
Africa," he explained. "The no
tion that Islam and Communism
are incompatible has been shat
tered by recent developments in
thp Near East. Both conflict with
our Greco-Roman tradition of the
value of the individual man. Both
have dynamism which makes
them the main missionary reli
gions.
The loss of Algeria by France
probably means the loss of Algo
ria by the free world, Dr. Fraser
continued. He said that if France
were to pull out of Algeria, it
would cause "a blood bath the
like of which the West has not
seen in a long time" and would
throw the country's govern men
tal machinery into chaos, a fer
tile field for Communism.
Dr. Fraser pointed to two "mir
acles" which will transform the
Sahara region of Africa. Vast
oil fields have been discovered in
the desert area, which will
change the whole oil picture of
Western Europe. Water has also
been found under the Sahara,
providing irrigation for (late
growing, which will stabilize the
economy of the oasis peoples.
