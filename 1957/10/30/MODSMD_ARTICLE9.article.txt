# Al Masters Says Football Scheds Binding Until 1960
## Tells Committee Mutual Consent of PCC Members Needed for Change 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P) â€”Stanford's athletic director A 1 Masters
said yesterday the Pacific Coast Conference round robin schedules
are binding until 1960 and can be broken only by mutual consent.
California, UCLA and USC have challenged the round robin which
requires each PCC team to play each other team, except Idaho, in

football annually. Governing bod
ies at these schools have said
they should be able to schedule
freely after the 1957 season.
Masters was asked by the State
Assembly subcommittee on inter
collegiate athletic activities what
the results would be if the con
ference sticks to its round robin
and the three schools refuse to
go along. Masters answered:
"It cither means the conference
must fold up or expel those
schools trying to get out of these
schedules."
Winter Meeting
Action on the problem comes
at the PCC winter meeting here
! Dec. 1-5.
Masters said no feud, as fre
quently reported, actually existed
! between UCLA and Stanford, al
j though there have been disagree
i ments.
Masters denied vehemently
that he ever had sent an emissary
I to UCLA suggesting that, if foot
ball coach Red Sanders were
fired, penalties against the Bru
ins in the illegal aid cases of last
year would be eased.
Kerr's Statement
Later in the hearings, Clark
Kerr, incoming president of the
University of California, said
UC's Berkeley campus would be
required to withdraw from the
Pacific Coast Conference should
UCLA be kicked out.
"If UCLA refused to play a
member school and the confer
ence ejected UCLA, we would
withdraw," Kerr said. "We are
so committed and it's a commit
ment we will honor."
