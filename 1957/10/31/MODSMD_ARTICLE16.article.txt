# Spaak: West's Future Safety Seems Certain
## NATO Secretary Says Present Policies Make War Impossible 
### Dick Frey, Associate Editor 
NATO Secretary-General Paul-Henri Spaak told a near-capacity
Memorial Auditorium audience last night the West is "safe for the
foreseeable future—provided we remain strong."
Spaak, whose Stanford talk was his only university appearance
on his current American tour, has served Belgium for the past 20

years as either prime minister or
foreign • minister and has con
tinually supported the integra
tion of Western Europe. This
support has won him the respect
ed title of "Mr. Europe."
He based his belief in the in
evitable success of NATO on the
fact that past wars were fought
because one or both sides be
lieved that they could achieve
final victory through military
means.
Relationship
He emphasized that the cur
rent relationship of Russia and
the West is such that a third
world war is impossible as long
as both sides continue to adhere
to the policies which they are
now following.
First, Spaak pointed out that
there is no chance that the NATO
nations will collectively declare
war on Russia since NATO is a
purely defensive alliance. His
second point was that of Nikita
Khrushchev's philosophy that the
West will be unable to solve the
problems which it faces and thus
revert to Communism as a pana
cea for economic and social
troubles.
Spaak said that he believes
that Khrushchev is "sincere" in
his long-term planning for evolu
tionary Communization of the
West.
Red Program
The Communist program of
waiting for the West to go Com
munist does not, of course, mean
that the Communist letfflers will
not try to hasten victory by in
terference in problems which the
West has and will experience in
the future, Spaak said.
"Whenever there is a problem
in the world which is difficult,
you can be sure the Communists
will be there to make things
more difficult." However, Spaak
emphasized, we are safe for the
foreseeable future provided that
we remain strong.
Spaak then mentioned Russia's
own weaknesses in their social
and economic systems. He said
the recent revolts by the Polish
and Hungarian peoples illustrate
the "bankruptcy of the Commu
nist social and economic sys
tems."
Recent Strides
The fact that Russia has made
recent strides in scientific work,
particularly their artificial space
satellite, does not compensate for
the Russian people's basic neces
sities of life. It is more impor
tant to the individual people to
have shoes and other material
comforts, he said.
Spaak also pointed out the ex
istence of definite Soviet impe
rialism. Imperialism is a simple
and clear concept, he said. It ex
ists when one country seizes a
certain territory and subjects its
inhabitants to foreign laws
against their will. "If the estab
lishment of the Russian satellites
is not imperialism, then we must
re-define the word."
He also expressed his opposi
tion to the right of veto in inter
national organizations as it is
now used. An international or
ganization will only work when
small and large nations realize
international law exists in spite
of their individual ambitions.
