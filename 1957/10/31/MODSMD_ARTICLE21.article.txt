11 U'l'K \ its 111 a I some meiiibers of tin* Stanford
I .»1 11 11 \ have forgotten the spirit of cooperation
and helpfulness v\llicli lias been a tradition on
our campus lor more than 60 years.
All 100 often students and faculty members
alike are forced lo stand for long periods of
lime al the «rive-a-lifl stands tin Calm Drive
before sonic thoughtful individual finally pulls
over and offers a ride.
During the period of time in people
must wait, 1.1, 20. sometimes 30 cars whiz, hv,
their owners apparently oblivious to the fact
I lint some people do not possess automobiles.
During recent years the bus line has been

cutting its schedule and continually lipping its
fare. \\ iih infrequent bus schedules, mam
have to depend entirelv upon the generosity
of car owners.
It was a help to those needing rides when
Alpha Chi Omega, service fraternity, built a
shelter several vears ago. A Chi O can only
facilitate the give-a-lift system. W hen it all
boils down, it is you —the student or stall mem
ber with a car who can maintain our share-a
ride plan.
Next time vou travel on Calm Drive, won't
you look to see if you can assist someone wish
ing lo go in the same direction as you?
