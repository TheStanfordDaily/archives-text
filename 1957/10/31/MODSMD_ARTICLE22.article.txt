Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.
George M. Carr
Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.
Michael Haas
Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro
gressive cause.

Utter Disregard ol' Law
Editor, The Daily:
While I have not traveled as widely as Mr. Wil
liamson, having tried to abide my restrictions on
my passport, I feel compelled to state that my
opinions on the living conditions'in the territo
ries under Russian domination which 1 did visit
differ greatly from his. However, I wholeheart
edly agree with the observation of Mr. Smith
that his action, like that of Governor Faubus,
was an utter disregard of the law of this coun
try. One can only speculate as to his future had
Mr. Williamson disregarded a decree of the Rus
sian government in a similar manner."
As to The Daily's practice of making ethics a
matter of result, I have no comment.

William Hosier
'Would-be Shakespeares'
Editor, The Daily:
What kind of journalism is it 1hat publishes
"Letters to the Editor" hut changes the wording
so that a sentence means just the opposite of
what it originally said?
In my letter concerning Mr. Williamson's trip
to China, I said: "We may criticize his opinions,
but let's not criticize him for expressing those
opinions. . . ."
When the letter appeared in Tuesday's Daily,
it read: "We may criticize him for expressing
those opinions, but we cannot prevent him from
making them. . . ."
Will you please tell any would-be Shakespeares
on your staff that they can gel plenty of practice
in grammar by takfng English I,
or even by experimenting on their own articles?
Letters should either he published as I hey are
written or not published at all.

Editor's Note: We stand corrected. A typo

reader scurrying into our office to check the

the proofreader did a little editing on his own.
Our humble apoiogies to you.

Aimed at the V ulgar
Editor. The Daily:
I hesitate to address this communication to
your journal, suspecting that its "poetic'' con
tent might label it for some restricted medium
of quality and sensitive appeal. But my observa
tions are crude and aimed at the vulgar. They
are of possible interest inasmuch as they are the
reaction of a student-visitor from one of t he
underdeveloped countries Great Britain, from
which even Mother-Symbol has occasionally to
escape.
Overcome with the exhilaration of palm trees
and parking lots, I dedicate these few lines to the

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer
sities. Any student who is interested is invited
to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.

Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro

Utter Disregard ol' Law
Editor, The Daily:
While I have not traveled as widely as Mr. Wil
liamson, having tried to abide my restrictions on
my passport, I feel compelled to state that my
opinions on the living conditions'in the territo
ries under Russian domination which 1 did visit
differ greatly from his. However, I wholeheart
edly agree with the observation of Mr. Smith
that his action, like that of Governor Faubus,
was an utter disregard of the law of this coun
try. One can only speculate as to his future had
Mr. Williamson disregarded a decree of the Rus

As to The Daily's practice of making ethics a

'Would-be Shakespeares'

What kind of journalism is it 1hat publishes

In my letter concerning Mr. Williamson's trip

but let's not criticize him for expressing those
opinions. . . ."
When the letter appeared in Tuesday's Daily,
it read: "We may criticize him for expressing

making them. . . ."

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer
sities. Any student who is interested is invited
to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.
Jack L. Hymans
Vice president in charge of education
Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.
George M. Carr
Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.

'Would-be Shakespeares'
Editor, The Daily:
What kind of journalism is it 1hat publishes
"Letters to the Editor" hut changes the wording

In my letter concerning Mr. Williamson's trip

but let's not criticize him for expressing those
opinions. . . ."
When the letter appeared in Tuesday's Daily,
it read: "We may criticize him for expressing
those opinions, but we cannot prevent him from
making them. . . ."
Will you please tell any would-be Shakespeares

Letters should either he published as I hey are

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer

to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.

Vice president in charge of education
Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.
George M. Carr
Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.
Michael Haas
Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro
gressive cause.

For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.

Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.

Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro
gressive cause.

Utter Disregard ol' Law
Editor, The Daily:
While I have not traveled as widely as Mr. Wil
liamson, having tried to abide my restrictions on
my passport, I feel compelled to state that my
opinions on the living conditions'in the territo
ries under Russian domination which 1 did visit
differ greatly from his. However, I wholeheart
edly agree with the observation of Mr. Smith
that his action, like that of Governor Faubus,
was an utter disregard of the law of this coun
try. One can only speculate as to his future had
Mr. Williamson disregarded a decree of the Rus
sian government in a similar manner."
As to The Daily's practice of making ethics a
matter of result, I have no comment.

'Would-be Shakespeares'

What kind of journalism is it 1hat publishes

In my letter concerning Mr. Williamson's trip
to China, I said: "We may criticize his opinions,
but let's not criticize him for expressing those
opinions. . . ."
When the letter appeared in Tuesday's Daily,
it read: "We may criticize him for expressing
those opinions, but we cannot prevent him from
making them. . . ."
Will you please tell any would-be Shakespeares

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer
sities. Any student who is interested is invited
to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.

Vice president in charge of education
Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying

quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer
sities. Any student who is interested is invited
to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.
Jack L. Hymans
Vice president in charge of education
Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.
George M. Carr
Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.
Michael Haas
Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer
sities. Any student who is interested is invited
to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.

Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.
George M. Carr
Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.
Michael Haas
Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro
gressive cause.

Utter Disregard ol' Law
Editor, The Daily:
While I have not traveled as widely as Mr. Wil
liamson, having tried to abide my restrictions on
my passport, I feel compelled to state that my
opinions on the living conditions'in the territo
ries under Russian domination which 1 did visit
differ greatly from his. However, I wholeheart
edly agree with the observation of Mr. Smith
that his action, like that of Governor Faubus,
was an utter disregard of the law of this coun
try. One can only speculate as to his future had
Mr. Williamson disregarded a decree of the Rus
sian government in a similar manner."
As to The Daily's practice of making ethics a
matter of result, I have no comment.

'Would-be Shakespeares'
Editor, The Daily:
What kind of journalism is it 1hat publishes
"Letters to the Editor" hut changes the wording
so that a sentence means just the opposite of

In my letter concerning Mr. Williamson's trip
to China, I said: "We may criticize his opinions,
but let's not criticize him for expressing those
opinions. . . ."
When the letter appeared in Tuesday's Daily,
it read: "We may criticize him for expressing
those opinions, but we cannot prevent him from
making them. . . ."
Will you please tell any would-be Shakespeares
on your staff that they can gel plenty of practice

Letters should either he published as I hey are

but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.
To reply directly to Mr. Clayton Smith, I should
like to state four points:
First, I deny that the State Department is com
posed of authoritative experts; they might be in
error in restricting freedom of the press, for ex
ample.
Secondly, Communist China has announced a
change in policy: Mao is allowing criticism of his
regime; this, of course, may be a mask. Ameri
can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for
"defense" of Formosa was far from a concili
ating move.
Thirdly, I fail to see what Mr. Smith means by
"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms
are abstract and undefined.
Lastly, if the United States is in a "quasi state
of war" with Communist China, I pray that it

may stop immediately. To settle international [
problems, a bellicose attitude is highly ineffec
tive; it invites mistrust' and hatred. Let's ap-1
proach Mao in a friendly manner (I am not argu-1
ing for appeasement ). It is always possible that
he might split with the Soviets; we are making
this desirable situation an impossibility by our i
present policy.

Profound Thoughts Evoked
Editor, The Daily:
I was very glad to see in print some profound |
thoughts evoked by the recent articles describing I
Eai'l Williamson's trip through Russia and Red
China. While many statements in the letters
were heartily disagreeable to this reader, I was
very pleased to see that so many students are
interested in the variety of questions linked with
the actions of Mr. Williamson and the other mem
bers of his group.
Fear of being made fools from propaganda
seems to be one of the liasic cries behind several
of the letters condemning Mr. Williamson. But i
how can those who censure him see how much
good U.S. propaganda these 41 young Americans
carried with them in their enthusiasm to see, talk
with and learn about the Communist people. The
Americans certainly must have created numerous
unforgettable good impressions on the people j
they talked to by their genuine interest, intelli-,
gence and sincere desires to understand their:
fellow men.
There are so many other questions that could
be easily expounded concerning the true meaning
of individual freedom, the right of our govern-1
ment to detain American citizens from traveling
to other countries, the closed doors of our own
country, the impossibility of isolation in a world |
growing smaller every day, the effects of knowl
edge of an unpleasant subject and its relationship
to promotion of more unpleasantness—but these
questions may at least be considered by you and
other Daily readers.
I do want to bring up the idea of student-faculty
exchange programs—so prevalent and enthusi
astically undertaken with other European coun
tries—being extended to Russia and her satellites.
During a year of study and living with a Rus-1
sian student an American could get to know him
quite well. He would be able to see and discuss
both the good and the bad points of living under
a Communist regime. He would also be able to
see for himself the actual living conditions; rules ,
the people must and must not follow; books that
may be read. He would be able to see the lux
uries and absence of luxuries; desire or lack of
desire for what we as Americans consider so
important. He could also view fairly objectively
the substitutions for various viewpoints or ma
terial objects which we take for granted.
In a situation where people must live, work,
eat, sleep and consequently talk together, a secure
foundation for judgment can lie created. But
judgment is not the only important aim. There
must also be room for a certain amount: of under
standing and cooperation arising from such close :
association. Such understanding is almost the
only way to erase the propagandist's black pic
ture of the "American capitalist." Perhaps some
few Russians would know us as fellow students,
fellow human beings and fellow future world '
leaders.
On the other hand, we as Americans could dem
onstrate, through our own understanding of our
American ideals, how we live and act and believe. '
We could show how our systems of government,
education and freedom work, if some Russians
were permitted to come to live and go to school!
with us. Normal everyday living cannot be de
scribed in the Voice of America programs, nor
can it be distributed in multicolor folders. We ;
can only define our way of life by living it; by :
having others live it with us.
We as students must try to crush this ever
increasing barrier between the people of the two
world leading nations. After all, we students will
be the leaders ot our respective countries very
soon. Must we wait until the Big Four confer
ences or the Summit meetings to define our posi
tions in the world? Why can't we build up some
kind of individual relationships now which may
lead to better national understanding in the I
future?

Secede from ASSU
Editor, The Daily:
Your publication of the tales of the journalist
who visited Red China has prompted careful con
sideration by the members of Stanford Village
306-B. Because of this, we have decided to secede
from the ASSU and set up our own independent
collective state. With this in mind we have es
tablished community ownership of all personal
property in Village 306-B. Furthermore, in order |
to consolidate our assets, we petition the ASSU
to return our $2 club dues.
It is not without regret that we leave the AS
SU, but with the feeling that it is ultimately
necessary to depart from the bumbling bureauc
racy of Democracy. It is now with a dual pride
that we wear the Stanford Red. We should like
to express our appreciation to The Daily and all 1
the Daily workers for Iheir support, of the pro
gressive cause.

Utter Disregard ol' Law
Editor, The Daily:
While I have not traveled as widely as Mr. Wil
liamson, having tried to abide my restrictions on
my passport, I feel compelled to state that my
opinions on the living conditions'in the territo
ries under Russian domination which 1 did visit
differ greatly from his. However, I wholeheart
edly agree with the observation of Mr. Smith
that his action, like that of Governor Faubus,
was an utter disregard of the law of this coun
try. One can only speculate as to his future had
Mr. Williamson disregarded a decree of the Rus
sian government in a similar manner."
As to The Daily's practice of making ethics a
matter of result, I have no comment.

'Would-be Shakespeares'
Editor, The Daily:
What kind of journalism is it 1hat publishes
"Letters to the Editor" hut changes the wording
so that a sentence means just the opposite of
what it originally said?
In my letter concerning Mr. Williamson's trip
to China, I said: "We may criticize his opinions,
but let's not criticize him for expressing those
opinions. . . ."
When the letter appeared in Tuesday's Daily,
it read: "We may criticize him for expressing
those opinions, but we cannot prevent him from
making them. . . ."
Will you please tell any would-be Shakespeares
on your staff that they can gel plenty of practice
in grammar by takfng English I,
or even by experimenting on their own articles?
Letters should either he published as I hey are
written or not published at all.

Editor. The Daily:
I hesitate to address this communication to

reaction of a student-visitor from one of t he
underdeveloped countries Great Britain, from
which even Mother-Symbol has occasionally to
escape.
Overcome with the exhilaration of palm trees

Information on Foreign Studies
Editor, The Daily:
In response to David Egger's complaint in
Wednesday's Daily, 1 would like to bring to the
attention of readers the service maintained by
the Institute of International Relations on foreign
universities.
The Stanford Overseas Information Service of
the IIR maintains a complete and up-to-date file
on almost every university in Europe. A staff of
Stanford world travelers is on hand most days
from 4:15 to 6.to answer questions about study
opportunities abroad. This information i.s acces
sible to every Stanford student who wishes to
make use of it. This year the Service is expand
ing its files to include Latin American univer
sities. Any student who is interested is invited
to drop by the SOIS desk in the IIR.

Welcome to the Sandpile
Editor, The Daily:
My regrets are extended to Jeff Fadiman and
his fellow sophomorie liberals, whose sensibili
ties were offended by my recent characteriza
tion of The Daily as the "Stanford Daily Work
er," due 1o its publication of the Williamson ar
ticles. His gratuitous assumption, that the appli
cation of the label is a result of the "prevalent
technique of 'not think'," is itself a label for
Uiose whose conclusions he is unable or unwill
ing to analyze. Welcome to the sandpile, Mr.
Fadiman!
It is an unfortunate limitation of any short
statement of one's conclusions in a letter that it
cannot be supplemented by an analysis of trea
tise length. On the other hand, in a university
community, one is entitled to assume that the
basic principles of democracy in a capitalistic
society are held with settled conviction by those
who would be leaders, else our doctrines and way
of life cannot be sustained. That the announced
Communist doctrines are unalterably opposed to
such convictions has become clear to most think
ing Americans, even to the fuzzy-minded intel
lectual of the 20's, is beyond question.
If these premises are conceded, as they must
be, the task of interpreting and acting from
principle with regard to contemporary Commu
nist tactics becomes a matter of vital impor
tance. The dangerous and fallacious approach to
1 h is task of a disturbing number of our present
flay pseudo-intellectual liberal thinkers, as so
clearly exemplified by Mr. Fadiman, is one of
reasoning from facts without principle, rather
Hian reasoning from facts and principle.
Our founding fathers, in Section 4 of Article
IV of the Constitution, took particular care that
for at least one hated thought—overthrow of our
form of government—there should never be free
dom, and, far from establishing a cosmic market
place for the interchange of ideas in which it
might emerge victorious, provided that this par
ticular thought should never triumph, even
peacefully and through the force of reason alone.
For an individual to maintain that he, as a lib
eral, or under the guise of broadmindedness, is
required to give audience to all theories and
ideas is directly opposed to the principles upon
which our nation is founded. This is not to say,
however, that individual thinking and studying
are precluded or present great danger to our so
ciety. for thought ful, bold and independent minds
are essential to wise and considered selfcgovern
ment.
There is a vital distinction between the desir
able study of authoritative materials concerning
1he Communist regime and the indiscriminate
publication of Communist propaganda. The dif
ference between the Communist Party Line in
its purist and most obvious form of ideology, and
Mr. Williamson's published reports of a con
ducted tour of China is solely a matter of degree.
George M. Carr
Rather Infantile Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to the editor pertaining to the
Williamson interview remind me of the rather
infantile reaction that a minority of Atlantic
Monthly readers had to an article gently satiriz
ing Billy Graham: some of these readers canceled
iheir subscriptions in protest. The parallel I am
Irving to make is that it seems incredible that
persons who voluntarily chose to attend Stanford
are seeking to deny academic freedom of thought.
It seems lamentable to me when even a handful
of college students corroborate Erich Fromm's
unfortunate thesis that 20th century man seeks
1o escape from freedom. Dr. Fromm's hypothesis,
briefly stated, is that modern man has inherited
a political system in which an unprecedented
level of individual expression is allowed; but men
in general have been overawed by their freedom,
such that they seek to shield themselves from the
painfulness of making decisions and thinking for
ihemselves by submitting themselves to authori
tarian governments and, I might add, by assum
ing dogmatic, inflexible intellects.
I wish it were possible to engender the spirit
oi the following statement, attributed-to Voltaire,
into those who have objected to Williamson's
trip: "I do not agree with a word that you say.
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." However hackneyed this epigram may seem
to 20th century man, it is my hope that the cli
mate of opinion of ihe 18th century may be
reborn in the minds of our contemporaries. Free
dom of speech, press, thought and conscience
sprang from this Enlightenment.

posed of authoritative experts; they might be in

can shipment of nuclear warhead missiles for

ating move.

"propaganda" and by "irresponsible actions by
elfish and misdirected individuals." These terms

of war" with Communist China, I pray that it
