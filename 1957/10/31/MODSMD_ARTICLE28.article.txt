PUBLIC REACTION TO INNOVATION (or shall we call it de
parture from the routine?) is always interesting to observe.
Take, 'for instance, the furor which arose when the Indians
elected to kick off to Rice after winning the pre-game toss. Rice
look the ball and marched down for a quick score. This departure
from custom in the minds of the many opened the gates for the
Texas flash-flood which did not subside until the Indians had been
humiliated, 34-7.
What most failed to remember was that the same innovation had
been used with success the week before against Northwestern. For
some reason, those who did remember this, or were reminded by the
press, could only pursue their thoughts to the conclusion that the
coaching staff was really daffy. Two weeks in a row!
The thoughi behind electing to receive is simple. It's all psycho
logical. It's like saying to the other team, "Here, little fellows, you
take the ball and play with it while you can because we're going to
lake it right away from you anyway." \
Against an untried, sophomore-laden Northwestern team, the psy
chology worked. The Indians held and Lou Valli returned the en
suing punt 48 yards to set up an early score. This must have been
very demoralizing.
Against Rice the strategy backfired as strategy often will. Rice
was more than ready to meet Stanford's (and it was a team decision,
not a Taylor mandate in this case) challenge.
Chuck has weathered greater storms and was able to pass the
situation off by commenting simply, "It's just like everything else
in this sport. If you guess light you're a hero. If you don't . .
The P.A.T. Problem
When the P.A.T. situation became the focal point of those who
are prone to criticize following the Washington State loss, quarter
back Bob Nicolet caused many eyebrows to flex on attempting a few
drop-kicks in Ihe pre-game warm-up at Washington the next Sat
urday.
"Was Taylor going to resort to that?" was the general reaction.
Although I believe there could have been nothing further from
Chuck's mind at the moment, I fail to see that—if he lias a man who
could drop-kick the ball through those two upright poles with any
degree of consistency any coach is stooping to the ridiculous in
electing to drop-kick extra points.
I understand that drop-kicking takes a fraction of a second longer
to accomplish than the conventional placement. Offsetting this in
my mind, however, is the availability of one more blocker, the easier
pass from center and the elimination of the middle" man.
Although Nicolet professes to have successfully drop-kicked field
goals in high school competition, he was just kidding up north. And
Taylor had better things on his mind, too.
The innovator I find most sympathy for this week (just this
week, however) is Coach Don Clark of USC.
With his Trojans desperately struggling for their first victory
of the season, he ended what could have been their winning drive
against WSC Saturday when he inserted Ed Isherwood to attempt
a field goal.
El Trojan was trailing 13-12 with 20 seconds remaining in the
game. Following an on-side kick they had driven to a third and one
situation on the 11-yard line.
In Isherwood. Out Trojans (13-12). In (the doghouse) Clark.
Clark, as must any coach, stuck to his guns. "If I had it to do
over, I'm not so sure I wouldn't call for the field goal again," he said
after the game.
And why not! I remember only too well Sam Tsagalakis' 38-yard
last-chance (13 seconds) field goal in 1953, which gave USC a 23-20
win and all but eliminated Bobby Garrett and crowd from the 1054
Rose Bowl.
* * «
Speaking of field goals, was the difference between professional
football's scoring theory and that of the colleges ever more dramati
cally evidenced than last Saturday when the Indians held UCLA
scoreless following Kirk Wilson's masterful 63-yard quick kick?
The pros after gaining nothing on three running plays would
have gone for the sure, quick "three." UCLA played it collegiate and
Al Harrington's brilliant pass defense held the Bruins scoreless.
Those who weekly seek the mythical "turning point" might give
inspection to that first-quarter, fourth-down play.
Over the Bounding Main
We don't pretend to know much about the sailing sport, but what
sounds like a good deal has come to our attention and we pass it on
to you.
Last month biz student John Scarborough and Alpha Delt Tom
Decker swept to the San Francisco Yacht Racing Association's 1957
season championship for the Bear class.
Actually it is the third straight championship for Scarborough
and his good sloop Trigger.
In 1955 he won the championship with a record point total. He
bettered this record in 1956 and again during the recent season, in
which he won eight out of his last nine races.
In the hopes of gaining more competition, John has purchased a
Star boat (he and Decker placed fourth in their first Star competi
tion) and intends to race in that class henceforth.
Both the Bear and the Star are 23-foot sloops; but the Bear has
a cabin and is adapted to cruising (Trigger is outfitted for ocean
going, we understand) while the Star is a hotter model, designed
primarily for racing.
Scarborough thus finds himself the owner of one boat too many,
nnd the extra boat is the proven winner, Trigger.
Admittedly, the success of a sailboat, like a racehorse, depends
a great deal upon the skipper. We are sure that for the $3000-$4OOO
asking price, John (phone DA 3-8635) would be willing to give a
good amount of tutoring in winning methods with a Bear.
It only seems a shame to us that, unlike the racehorse, the object
of such a large investment cannot be expected to produce a string
of winners in the smaller classes.

Tt seems a bit ironic that Coach Taylor has as many ex-quarter
backs playing right end on the varsity as Bob Ghilotti has been able
to corral for his entire freshman squad.
The top three Indian right ends— Gary Van Galder, Ben Robinson
and Jim Ukropina—were quarterback candidates druing their Pa
poose year on the Farm.
Dick Van Galder, one of Gary's four brothers, is among the three
signal callers Ghilotti has been tutoring for Friday's frosh opener
against USC.

from custom in the minds of the many opened the gates for the
Texas flash-flood which did not subside until the Indians had been
humiliated, 34-7.
What most failed to remember was that the same innovation had
been used with success the week before against Northwestern. For
some reason, those who did remember this, or were reminded by the
press, could only pursue their thoughts to the conclusion that the
coaching staff was really daffy. Two weeks in a row!
The thoughi behind electing to receive is simple. It's all psycho
logical. It's like saying to the other team, "Here, little fellows, you
take the ball and play with it while you can because we're going to
lake it right away from you anyway." \
Against an untried, sophomore-laden Northwestern team, the psy
chology worked. The Indians held and Lou Valli returned the en
suing punt 48 yards to set up an early score. This must have been
very demoralizing.
Against Rice the strategy backfired as strategy often will. Rice
was more than ready to meet Stanford's (and it was a team decision,
not a Taylor mandate in this case) challenge.
Chuck has weathered greater storms and was able to pass the
situation off by commenting simply, "It's just like everything else
in this sport. If you guess light you're a hero. If you don't . .
The P.A.T. Problem
When the P.A.T. situation became the focal point of those who
are prone to criticize following the Washington State loss, quarter
back Bob Nicolet caused many eyebrows to flex on attempting a few
drop-kicks in Ihe pre-game warm-up at Washington the next Sat
urday.
"Was Taylor going to resort to that?" was the general reaction.
Although I believe there could have been nothing further from
Chuck's mind at the moment, I fail to see that—if he lias a man who
could drop-kick the ball through those two upright poles with any
degree of consistency any coach is stooping to the ridiculous in
electing to drop-kick extra points.
I understand that drop-kicking takes a fraction of a second longer
to accomplish than the conventional placement. Offsetting this in
my mind, however, is the availability of one more blocker, the easier
pass from center and the elimination of the middle" man.
Although Nicolet professes to have successfully drop-kicked field
goals in high school competition, he was just kidding up north. And
Taylor had better things on his mind, too.
The innovator I find most sympathy for this week (just this
week, however) is Coach Don Clark of USC.
With his Trojans desperately struggling for their first victory
of the season, he ended what could have been their winning drive
against WSC Saturday when he inserted Ed Isherwood to attempt
a field goal.
El Trojan was trailing 13-12 with 20 seconds remaining in the
game. Following an on-side kick they had driven to a third and one
situation on the 11-yard line.
In Isherwood. Out Trojans (13-12). In (the doghouse) Clark.
Clark, as must any coach, stuck to his guns. "If I had it to do
over, I'm not so sure I wouldn't call for the field goal again," he said
after the game.
And why not! I remember only too well Sam Tsagalakis' 38-yard
last-chance (13 seconds) field goal in 1953, which gave USC a 23-20
win and all but eliminated Bobby Garrett and crowd from the 1054
Rose Bowl.

Speaking of field goals, was the difference between professional
football's scoring theory and that of the colleges ever more dramati
cally evidenced than last Saturday when the Indians held UCLA
scoreless following Kirk Wilson's masterful 63-yard quick kick?
The pros after gaining nothing on three running plays would
have gone for the sure, quick "three." UCLA played it collegiate and
Al Harrington's brilliant pass defense held the Bruins scoreless.
Those who weekly seek the mythical "turning point" might give
inspection to that first-quarter, fourth-down play.
Over the Bounding Main
We don't pretend to know much about the sailing sport, but what
sounds like a good deal has come to our attention and we pass it on
to you.
Last month biz student John Scarborough and Alpha Delt Tom
Decker swept to the San Francisco Yacht Racing Association's 1957
season championship for the Bear class.
Actually it is the third straight championship for Scarborough
and his good sloop Trigger.
In 1955 he won the championship with a record point total. He
bettered this record in 1956 and again during the recent season, in
which he won eight out of his last nine races.
In the hopes of gaining more competition, John has purchased a
Star boat (he and Decker placed fourth in their first Star competi
tion) and intends to race in that class henceforth.
Both the Bear and the Star are 23-foot sloops; but the Bear has
a cabin and is adapted to cruising (Trigger is outfitted for ocean
going, we understand) while the Star is a hotter model, designed
primarily for racing.
Scarborough thus finds himself the owner of one boat too many,
nnd the extra boat is the proven winner, Trigger.
Admittedly, the success of a sailboat, like a racehorse, depends
a great deal upon the skipper. We are sure that for the $3000-$4OOO
asking price, John (phone DA 3-8635) would be willing to give a
good amount of tutoring in winning methods with a Bear.
It only seems a shame to us that, unlike the racehorse, the object
of such a large investment cannot be expected to produce a string
of winners in the smaller classes.

Tt seems a bit ironic that Coach Taylor has as many ex-quarter
backs playing right end on the varsity as Bob Ghilotti has been able
to corral for his entire freshman squad.

some reason, those who did remember this, or were reminded by the
press, could only pursue their thoughts to the conclusion that the
coaching staff was really daffy. Two weeks in a row!
The thoughi behind electing to receive is simple. It's all psycho
logical. It's like saying to the other team, "Here, little fellows, you
take the ball and play with it while you can because we're going to
lake it right away from you anyway." \
Against an untried, sophomore-laden Northwestern team, the psy
chology worked. The Indians held and Lou Valli returned the en
suing punt 48 yards to set up an early score. This must have been
very demoralizing.
Against Rice the strategy backfired as strategy often will. Rice
was more than ready to meet Stanford's (and it was a team decision,
not a Taylor mandate in this case) challenge.
Chuck has weathered greater storms and was able to pass the
situation off by commenting simply, "It's just like everything else
in this sport. If you guess light you're a hero. If you don't . .
The P.A.T. Problem
When the P.A.T. situation became the focal point of those who
are prone to criticize following the Washington State loss, quarter
back Bob Nicolet caused many eyebrows to flex on attempting a few
drop-kicks in Ihe pre-game warm-up at Washington the next Sat
urday.
"Was Taylor going to resort to that?" was the general reaction.
Although I believe there could have been nothing further from
Chuck's mind at the moment, I fail to see that—if he lias a man who
could drop-kick the ball through those two upright poles with any
degree of consistency any coach is stooping to the ridiculous in
electing to drop-kick extra points.
I understand that drop-kicking takes a fraction of a second longer
to accomplish than the conventional placement. Offsetting this in
my mind, however, is the availability of one more blocker, the easier
pass from center and the elimination of the middle" man.
Although Nicolet professes to have successfully drop-kicked field
goals in high school competition, he was just kidding up north. And
Taylor had better things on his mind, too.
The innovator I find most sympathy for this week (just this
week, however) is Coach Don Clark of USC.
With his Trojans desperately struggling for their first victory
of the season, he ended what could have been their winning drive
against WSC Saturday when he inserted Ed Isherwood to attempt
a field goal.
El Trojan was trailing 13-12 with 20 seconds remaining in the
game. Following an on-side kick they had driven to a third and one
situation on the 11-yard line.
In Isherwood. Out Trojans (13-12). In (the doghouse) Clark.
Clark, as must any coach, stuck to his guns. "If I had it to do
over, I'm not so sure I wouldn't call for the field goal again," he said
after the game.
And why not! I remember only too well Sam Tsagalakis' 38-yard
last-chance (13 seconds) field goal in 1953, which gave USC a 23-20
win and all but eliminated Bobby Garrett and crowd from the 1054
Rose Bowl.

Speaking of field goals, was the difference between professional
football's scoring theory and that of the colleges ever more dramati
cally evidenced than last Saturday when the Indians held UCLA
scoreless following Kirk Wilson's masterful 63-yard quick kick?
The pros after gaining nothing on three running plays would
have gone for the sure, quick "three." UCLA played it collegiate and
Al Harrington's brilliant pass defense held the Bruins scoreless.
Those who weekly seek the mythical "turning point" might give
inspection to that first-quarter, fourth-down play.
Over the Bounding Main
We don't pretend to know much about the sailing sport, but what
sounds like a good deal has come to our attention and we pass it on
to you.
Last month biz student John Scarborough and Alpha Delt Tom
Decker swept to the San Francisco Yacht Racing Association's 1957
season championship for the Bear class.
Actually it is the third straight championship for Scarborough
and his good sloop Trigger.
In 1955 he won the championship with a record point total. He
bettered this record in 1956 and again during the recent season, in
which he won eight out of his last nine races.
In the hopes of gaining more competition, John has purchased a
Star boat (he and Decker placed fourth in their first Star competi
tion) and intends to race in that class henceforth.
Both the Bear and the Star are 23-foot sloops; but the Bear has
a cabin and is adapted to cruising (Trigger is outfitted for ocean
going, we understand) while the Star is a hotter model, designed
primarily for racing.
Scarborough thus finds himself the owner of one boat too many,
nnd the extra boat is the proven winner, Trigger.
Admittedly, the success of a sailboat, like a racehorse, depends
a great deal upon the skipper. We are sure that for the $3000-$4OOO
asking price, John (phone DA 3-8635) would be willing to give a
good amount of tutoring in winning methods with a Bear.
It only seems a shame to us that, unlike the racehorse, the object
of such a large investment cannot be expected to produce a string
of winners in the smaller classes.

Tt seems a bit ironic that Coach Taylor has as many ex-quarter
backs playing right end on the varsity as Bob Ghilotti has been able
to corral for his entire freshman squad.
The top three Indian right ends— Gary Van Galder, Ben Robinson
and Jim Ukropina—were quarterback candidates druing their Pa
poose year on the Farm.
Dick Van Galder, one of Gary's four brothers, is among the three
signal callers Ghilotti has been tutoring for Friday's frosh opener
against USC.
PUBLIC REACTION TO INNOVATION (or shall we call it de
parture from the routine?) is always interesting to observe.
Take, 'for instance, the furor which arose when the Indians
elected to kick off to Rice after winning the pre-game toss. Rice
look the ball and marched down for a quick score. This departure
from custom in the minds of the many opened the gates for the
Texas flash-flood which did not subside until the Indians had been
humiliated, 34-7.
What most failed to remember was that the same innovation had

logical. It's like saying to the other team, "Here, little fellows, you
take the ball and play with it while you can because we're going to
lake it right away from you anyway." \
Against an untried, sophomore-laden Northwestern team, the psy
chology worked. The Indians held and Lou Valli returned the en
suing punt 48 yards to set up an early score. This must have been
very demoralizing.
Against Rice the strategy backfired as strategy often will. Rice
was more than ready to meet Stanford's (and it was a team decision,
not a Taylor mandate in this case) challenge.
Chuck has weathered greater storms and was able to pass the
situation off by commenting simply, "It's just like everything else
in this sport. If you guess light you're a hero. If you don't . .
The P.A.T. Problem
When the P.A.T. situation became the focal point of those who
are prone to criticize following the Washington State loss, quarter
back Bob Nicolet caused many eyebrows to flex on attempting a few
drop-kicks in Ihe pre-game warm-up at Washington the next Sat
urday.
"Was Taylor going to resort to that?" was the general reaction.
Although I believe there could have been nothing further from
Chuck's mind at the moment, I fail to see that—if he lias a man who
could drop-kick the ball through those two upright poles with any
degree of consistency any coach is stooping to the ridiculous in
electing to drop-kick extra points.
I understand that drop-kicking takes a fraction of a second longer
to accomplish than the conventional placement. Offsetting this in
my mind, however, is the availability of one more blocker, the easier
pass from center and the elimination of the middle" man.
Although Nicolet professes to have successfully drop-kicked field
goals in high school competition, he was just kidding up north. And
Taylor had better things on his mind, too.
The innovator I find most sympathy for this week (just this
week, however) is Coach Don Clark of USC.
With his Trojans desperately struggling for their first victory
of the season, he ended what could have been their winning drive
against WSC Saturday when he inserted Ed Isherwood to attempt
a field goal.
El Trojan was trailing 13-12 with 20 seconds remaining in the
game. Following an on-side kick they had driven to a third and one
situation on the 11-yard line.
In Isherwood. Out Trojans (13-12). In (the doghouse) Clark.
Clark, as must any coach, stuck to his guns. "If I had it to do
over, I'm not so sure I wouldn't call for the field goal again," he said
after the game.
And why not! I remember only too well Sam Tsagalakis' 38-yard
last-chance (13 seconds) field goal in 1953, which gave USC a 23-20
win and all but eliminated Bobby Garrett and crowd from the 1054
Rose Bowl.

Speaking of field goals, was the difference between professional
football's scoring theory and that of the colleges ever more dramati
cally evidenced than last Saturday when the Indians held UCLA
scoreless following Kirk Wilson's masterful 63-yard quick kick?
The pros after gaining nothing on three running plays would
have gone for the sure, quick "three." UCLA played it collegiate and
Al Harrington's brilliant pass defense held the Bruins scoreless.
Those who weekly seek the mythical "turning point" might give
inspection to that first-quarter, fourth-down play.
Over the Bounding Main
We don't pretend to know much about the sailing sport, but what
sounds like a good deal has come to our attention and we pass it on
to you.
Last month biz student John Scarborough and Alpha Delt Tom
Decker swept to the San Francisco Yacht Racing Association's 1957
season championship for the Bear class.
Actually it is the third straight championship for Scarborough
and his good sloop Trigger.
In 1955 he won the championship with a record point total. He
bettered this record in 1956 and again during the recent season, in
which he won eight out of his last nine races.
In the hopes of gaining more competition, John has purchased a
Star boat (he and Decker placed fourth in their first Star competi
tion) and intends to race in that class henceforth.
Both the Bear and the Star are 23-foot sloops; but the Bear has
a cabin and is adapted to cruising (Trigger is outfitted for ocean
going, we understand) while the Star is a hotter model, designed
primarily for racing.
Scarborough thus finds himself the owner of one boat too many,
nnd the extra boat is the proven winner, Trigger.
Admittedly, the success of a sailboat, like a racehorse, depends
a great deal upon the skipper. We are sure that for the $3000-$4OOO
asking price, John (phone DA 3-8635) would be willing to give a
good amount of tutoring in winning methods with a Bear.
It only seems a shame to us that, unlike the racehorse, the object
of such a large investment cannot be expected to produce a string
of winners in the smaller classes.

Tt seems a bit ironic that Coach Taylor has as many ex-quarter
backs playing right end on the varsity as Bob Ghilotti has been able
to corral for his entire freshman squad.
The top three Indian right ends— Gary Van Galder, Ben Robinson
and Jim Ukropina—were quarterback candidates druing their Pa
poose year on the Farm.
Dick Van Galder, one of Gary's four brothers, is among the three
signal callers Ghilotti has been tutoring for Friday's frosh opener
against USC.
