# Hank Sauer Wins NL Award
## 
### 
INGLEWOOD (/P) â€” Towering
Hank Sauer had just finished a
round of golf yesterday when he
learned he had been voted Ihe
comeback player of 1957 in the
National League.
Hank, whose 1 9 5 pounds
mounted on a 6-foot-3 frame
makes him a dominating figure
on or off the baseball field,
beamed from ear to ear.
"That's great," he said, adding
his thanks to the members of the

Baseball Writers Association of
America who voted for him in
the annual Associated Press poll.
"Funny thing. I noted Bobby
Shantz got the award in the
American League. I didn't think
I'd get it but you remember, Bob
by was voted the most valuable
player in his league in 1952 and
I won it in Ihe National League
the same year.
"Guess we're just a couple of
comeback kids."
