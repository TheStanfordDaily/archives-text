## Baran Urges Non-profit Aid Instead of Point Four 
### 
"All of us in the advanced world are responsible for what happens
in the rest of the world," Professor Paul Baran of the economics de
partment told the Independent Caucus of the Political Union yester
day afternoon in Bowman Alumni House.
Baran, whose book "The Political Economy of Growth" has re-

eently been published, spoke on
"A Socialist Alternative to Point
Four" before the audience of
about 33 persons.
"There is no point in our main
taining that, we are Christian and
developed civilizations if we are
going to say that what happens
in the other parts of Ihe earth
doesn't matter to us," Professor
Baran said.
More Investments
The speaker explained that in
sufficient investment in produc
tive facilities is the key to the
problem of under-developed coun
tries. This may be caused, he
continued, by either the total na
tional income of the nation being
so small that it cannot do any
thing or that the income is un
evenly distributed.
"It is feasible," Professor Ba
ran said, "that the United States
could give $20 billion to these
under-developed countries, and in
10 or 15 years they could be in
dustrially developed enough to
move on their own."
The economist said that most
investments by private compa
nies are in such industries as
mining and oil, in which the raw
materials are taken out of the
country. Most of this stays out
of the source nation and the pay
ments which are paid back are
generally small. The other prob
lem is what is done with what is
paid back.
Quick Profits
Private investors are unlikely
to go into long - range projects
such as railroads or schools.
They want quick profits.
"What we need in our govern
ment," said Professor Baran, "are
functionaries interested in solv
ing world problems. Present lead
res are too concerned with politi
cal and economic commitments at
home. They are pushing us to
1 the brink of disaster," he con
j eluded.
Organisation of a Socialist
Caucus was proposed by John
Lane at yesterday's meeting.
Those interested will meet Wed
nesday at 5 p.m. in the Nitery.

ments which are paid back are
generally small. The other prob
lem is what is done with what is
paid back.
Quick Profits
Private investors are unlikely
to go into long - range projects
such as railroads or schools.
They want quick profits.
"What we need in our govern
ment," said Professor Baran, "are
functionaries interested in solv
ing world problems. Present lead
res are too concerned with politi
cal and economic commitments at
home. They are pushing us to
1 the brink of disaster," he con
j eluded.
Organisation of a Socialist
Caucus was proposed by John
Lane at yesterday's meeting.
Those interested will meet Wed
nesday at 5 p.m. in the Nitery.
"All of us in the advanced world are responsible for what happens
in the rest of the world," Professor Paul Baran of the economics de
partment told the Independent Caucus of the Political Union yester
day afternoon in Bowman Alumni House.
Baran, whose book "The Political Economy of Growth" has re-

eently been published, spoke on
"A Socialist Alternative to Point
Four" before the audience of
about 33 persons.
"There is no point in our main
taining that, we are Christian and
developed civilizations if we are
going to say that what happens
in the other parts of Ihe earth
doesn't matter to us," Professor
Baran said.
More Investments
The speaker explained that in
sufficient investment in produc
tive facilities is the key to the
problem of under-developed coun
tries. This may be caused, he
continued, by either the total na
tional income of the nation being
so small that it cannot do any
thing or that the income is un
evenly distributed.
"It is feasible," Professor Ba
ran said, "that the United States
could give $20 billion to these
under-developed countries, and in
10 or 15 years they could be in
dustrially developed enough to
move on their own."
The economist said that most
investments by private compa
nies are in such industries as
mining and oil, in which the raw
materials are taken out of the
country. Most of this stays out
of the source nation and the pay
ments which are paid back are
generally small. The other prob
lem is what is done with what is
paid back.
