# OREGON IS STRONG
## Stanford Sets Defenses For Ground-minded Ducks 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford defenses are being set to stop the fastest and one of the
best sets of running backs on the West Coast who will be showing
their wares when Oregon tangles with the Indians Saturday in Stan
ford Stadium.
This year's Webfoot team has compiled its excellent 4-0 PCC rec-

ord on a foundation of defense
and great running. In Charley
Tourville, Jim Shanley and Jack
Morris, the Ducks have a trio
that has accounted for a total of
953 yards in six games.
Right halfback Shanley, who
last week lost the PCC rushing
leadership to the Cards' Chuck
Shea, has rolled for an average
of 4.4 yards per carry and is
sefond in conference stats. Mor
ris, who's carried only about half
as often, has a 4.7 average. Tour
ville has toted just 47 tunes, but
has the best average of the lot,
4.8. #
Shanley tlu\ Vet
Shanley is the real veteran of
the troupe. He's been a starter
for the Ducks for two and one
half years, and is the leading ac
tive running back in the PCC.
He's a little guy at 5-8 and 170
pounds, but makes up for his
lack of size with good speed and
clever deception.
Rushing isn't Shanley's only
strong point, as lie also contrib
utes strongly to the Oregon de
fensive unit and does a workman
like job on kickoff and punt run
backs and pass receiving. He has
n't missed a game at Oregon
since he started the first game of
the 1955 season, and has aver
aged over 40 minutes per contest.

Shanley is at the right place
when it counts, too, as is evi
denced by his league-leading 36
points scored this season.
Taller, Heavier, Older
Morris is taller, heavier and
older than Shanley, and a bit fast
er-, too. tie's been timed at 9.5
in the 100-yard dash, and has a
flock of 9.7's to his credit.
Morris operates from the full
i back slot after originally playing
halfback. In addition to his six
years of high school and college
ball, Morris picked up lots of ex
perience with three years of Ma
rine play. He's now 25.
Morris is particularly valuable
to the Ducks as a conversion
kicker. He set the PCC record of
23 straight PAT's without a miss,
and went through all last year
without a misfired kick.
Any time Oregon gets close to
scoring territory, Morris and his
! educated toe become a threat. In
just six games this season, he's
booted three field goals.

Stanford assistant coach
George Lynn and Oregon men
tor Len C asanova will discuss
the Indian â€¢ Duck game with
Don Klein on "This* Week in
Stanford Sports" at 9:45 to
night on KCBS.
