Those line - pounding Stanford
Indians have humped the Oregon
State Beavers from the Paeifit-
Coast Conference's total offense
leadership, statistics from the
PCC commissioner's office indi
cated yesterday.
The Indians, with 2000 total
yards to their credit after six
games, have averaged 333.3 yards
per game this season. Oregon
State, meanwhile, has averaged
328.5 yards and has totaled 1971
yards.

The stoutest total defense, inci
dentally. is owned by Oregon, who
meet Stanford here Saturday in
the game that conceivably could
determine this season's PCC Rose
Bowl representative.
Ducks Stingy
The Ducks, stingy members of
the Scrooge McDuck clan, have
been reluctant to give up yardage
this season, relinquishing only
132.7 yards per game on the
ground and 230.3 total yards.
Stanford's rushing defense is |

the PCC's second best, having al
lowed an average of 158 yards
each game. The Indians are fifth
in total defense, nevertheless, per
mitting 292.2 total yards.
Oregon's high - stepping back
field of Jack Morris, Jim Shanley
and Charley Tourville has pro
duced 223.2 yards per game on
the ground, for the PCC's third
best mark. The Ducks' passing
attack, however, is only eighth
best in the PCC.
Washington State's Bob New

man & Co. are the front runners
in the PCC's pass department
with 150.7 yards per game, and
Stanford is second with 108 yards
each game. The Indians have
thrown 112 times this season, com
pleting 47.3 per cent of their at-
I tempts for (548 yards.

yards per game leads in rushing.
