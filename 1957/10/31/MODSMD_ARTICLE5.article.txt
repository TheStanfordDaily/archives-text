# SU Professor Will Air Ideas On TV Series
## 
### 
Hitting out at some ideals and
idols of the human race will be
Dr. John W. Dodds' purpose
when he stars soon in a new se
ries of National Educational Tele
vision pr ogram s called "The
Measure of Man."
Dodds, English professor and
director of special programs in
the humanities at Stanford, will
appear Nov. 21 over KQED, San
Francisco's educational TV sta
tion, in the first of six half-hour
programs.
The series will deal with such
matters as loyalty, dignity and
the tragedy of man. Dodds will
spice his television talks with
readings from great literature,
ranging from the humor of
James Thurber to the drama of
Euripedes.
"The dignity of man," says
Dodds in his preface to the se
ries, "is an idea that has been
kicked around a good deal by
writers and commencement
speakers; and for some people
the phrase has a sort of oratori
cal, stuffed-shirt vagueness about
itâ€”yet the concept of the dignity
of man has profound impor
tance."
Dodds is now on leave from
Stanford and will return in Janu
uary.
