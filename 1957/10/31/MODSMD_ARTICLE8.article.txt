## Pat Brown Announces Candidacy 
### Associated Press 
California Attorney General Ed
mund G. Brown yesterday said he
would seek the Democratic nomi
nation for governor and predicted
his Republican opponent will be
Sen. William Knowland, not in
cumbent Gov. Goodwin J. Knight.
"The power elite of the Repub
lican party in California is doing
everything it can to dry up the
sources of Governor Knight's fi
nancial support and make it im
possible for him to. run." said
Brown. "I have been told by a
Republican leader that a deal has
already been set."
The ambitions of both Vice
President Richard Nixon and Sen
ator Knowland to enter the White
House one day are well known.
Nixon and Knowland
Though Nixon, as President
Eisenhower's heir-apparent, and
Knowland, as leader of the right
wing Republicans, would appear
to be rivals for the presidential
nomination, both men evidently
feel their interests would better
be served if Knight were not in
control of .the party machinery in
the state.
As late as Monday, Knight was
still insisting he would not drop
out of the race. But political ob
servers detected a weakening in
his position as he declined flatly
to rule out the possibilities he
might accept a federal position or
run for the U.S. Senate the two
alternatives most prominently
montioned in connection with his
political future.
Brown a Threat
Whatever the result of the
Knight-Knowland - Nixon ruckus,
Republicans face a serious threat
in "Pat" Brown to their continued
control of the state. A popular
leader in a resurgent party, the
52-year-old attorney general is out
to upset the GOP's well-laid plans
by becoming the second Democrat
to win the governorship of Cali
fornia in this century.
In the press conference yester
day at which he announced his
candidacy, Brown described Gov
ernor Knight as "a confused and
wavering incumbent deserted by
his own party," and Knowland as
"a reactionary who views the
state's highest office as only a
pawn in presidential power poli
tics."
Brown said he will file in both
the Democratic and Republican
primaries under California's cross
filing law. In 1954 he won both
parties' nominations for attorney
general.
