KWICK KOURSE
No. 3
Econ Made Simple
1. Supply—Kepler sells books (the inexpensive paper
bounds), art prints, and studio cards.
2. Incentive — Kepler knows that man doesn't live by
bread alone, but he (and the little Keplers) do
like to cat.
3. Demand — You read books (if required to do so), enjoy
art, and startle your friends with fantastic studio
cards.
4. Free Market — Kepler wants to sell you his books,
prints, and cards — but so do all other book
sellers.
Hence . . .
5. Advertising — Kepler prostitutes himself and the arts
in order—
6. Consumption — to sell to you.
And that, students, is BUSINESS

Whaf helps Kepler helps business, and what helps Kepler's business
helps Kepler.
