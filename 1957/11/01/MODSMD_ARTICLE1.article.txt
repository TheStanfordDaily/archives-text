# Day After the Night Before?

### 

'TWAS HALLOWEEN —All Saints'* Day, when goblins and spooks
prowl in the night, was apparently not limited to little kiddies in
home-made masks and costumes last night. It seems that a large
and motley) crew of Stanford-rfgc youngsters were having the
times of their lives, sharing their tricks and treats 1 with Paly's little
children, But, fortunately, perhaps-, it is this once-a-year chance,
when suppressed desires of the more dignified college crowd can
come f<> the lore for a night, only to he squelched the next day as
they try »o explain the sacks full of goodies to their roommates.
