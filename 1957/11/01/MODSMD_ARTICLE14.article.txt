# Musicals Headline Band's Half-Time
## 
### 
The Stanford Band will fare
Stanford rooters tomorrow when
it presents its half-time enter
tainment featuring tunes made
popular in Broadway musicals.
The band will play to the Stan
ford side because rooters will not
be busy doing card stunts, for
this game, according to Student
Manager Ed Best.
"My Fair Lady" will lead off
the series of six famous tunes
from the musicals. Working
backward in time, the show will
end with a tune from a vaudeville
show.
Best suggests that students
| pay close attention to one stunt
featuring "Hello Young Lovers."
A 35-pieec pop band will be on
hand from Oregon to play in the
stands.
