# Indians in Crucial with Oregon; PCC Title May Hang in Balance
## Cards, With Coast's Top Attack, To Meet Number One Defense Shea, Shanley Tangle for Hushing Leadership; Statistics Show Tribe, Ducks Evenly Matched 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The lure of I ho Pacific Coast Conference championship and a very
faint aroma of flowers will be in the air tomorrow when Oregon and
Stanford clash at $ p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
A crowd of more than 50,000 is expected to sit in on the struggle
between the PCC's number one and number three teams. Oregon

enters t ho game with a 4-0 mark
in conference play and a 5-1 sea
son mark. Chuck Taylor's In
dians are 2-1 in loop action, and
4-2 for the year.
The winner tomorrow will
move into a slight favorite's role
for both the title and the Ja;i. 1
assignment. Oregon, particularly,
would be in a commanding posi
tion if they won. A Stanford vic
tory, on the other hand, would
leave the Cards, Ducks and
Washington State Cougars each
with one loss in loop play.
Dark Horse and Long Shot
Oregon has been the dark
horse of the season, but the In
dians have been the real long
shots. While it has been the Ore
gon defense and running attack
that have surprised the experts,
Stanford has contributed its
share of surprises in rushing and
rush defense.
And then last week, the Tribe
pass defense came into its own
with a brilliant job against UC
LA. Stanford passing has been
at its usual high level of effi
ciency.
Stanford appears to be "up"
for the game. Taylor, when
asked if the Cards were as high
for the Ducks as for UCLA, re
plied, "Well, I think they should
be. but of course I can't get in
side of them and find out."
Taylor wouldn't make a predic
tion on the outcome of the game,
except to jokingly reply "0-0"
when he was asked to name the
final score.
The Stanford mentor wasn't
any more definite when he was
asked to single out the strongest
part of the Oregon game. "Rush
ing, passing, kicking, defense—
they ail worry me," was his reply.
Evenly Matched
From a statistical standpoint
the teams could hardly be more
evenly matched. Stanford leads
the PCC in total offense; the
Ducks hold the top spot in total
defense.
There's going to be about 100
yards that'll have to give some
where, however. Casanova's crew
is giving up just 230.3 yards per
game, but the Indians have been
rolling up over 333 yards per en
counter.
On the other side of the ledger,
things are more balanced. Ore
gon has driven .for 258.8 yards in
each 60 minutes -of play, while
Card defenders have allowed I he
average opponent to pile up 298.2
yards of ground.
Five io Five
An over-fill look at the 10 de
partments in which the PCC
keeps statistics shows Stanford
ahead in five and Ihe Ducks on
top in a like number.
Taylor's men hold- the upper
hand in rush offense, pass offense,
total offense,., interceptions jind
punting. Oregon is above the
Cards in punt returns, kickoff
returns, rush defense, pass de
fense and total defense.
In only one 'department pass
offense are the two clubs more
than three positions apart in the
statistical standings. In two de
partments -kickoff returns and
rush defense; tjie .Tribe and the
Webfoots rank one-two in the con
ference. In punting they're eighth
and ninth, respectively.
Fewest Fonts
Fortunately for Stanford, the
low place in the punting slats is
not as bad ;is it might be, since
the Cards have had to kick just
18 times this year nine less than
any other team in the conference.
Indian opponents have also re
turner] kicks less than two yards
per effort.
The principal offensive battle
will be waged "between tjie PCC
rushing leader, Chuck Shea of
Stanford, and the No. 2 man, Ore
gon's Jim Shanjey.
Although carrying five times
less than Shanley this year, Shea
has rolled up 172 yards to his op
ponent's 467. Although close in
statistics, the two are different
types of runners.
Standard SU Fullback
Shea follows the pattern of
Stanford fullbacks from the past.
He carries the ball on about one
third of the Indians' rushing plays
and gpes up the middle, off guard
and thekle, and around the ends
equally well.
Shea depends on power, for the
most part, and has done a top
flight job of shoving ahead for
extra yardage this year.
Shanley, on the other hand, is
a light runner (170 pounds) and
gains a lot of his yardage because
of his speed and agility. He runs
from the right-halfback slot and,
like Shea, carries the ball on
about one-third of his team's rush
ing plays.
Other Threats
Of course, these two runners
aren't the only offensive threats
on the field. In Jackie Douglas,
Stanford boasts one of the Coast's
most effective and efficient quar
terbacks.
He hit a phenomenal 10-for-12
in the passing department against
UCLA last week and hiked his
season's passing average to 53.3

per cent. He's specialized in short
tosses, although he proved he carr
throw the long ones with his 37-
yard touchdown heave to Joei
Freis against the Bruins.
Roll-Out Ability
Douglas' strongest poinl in re
lation to past greal quarterbacks
at Stanford is his ability lo roll
out. He did'it six times against
the Bruins and wound up with 35'
yards gained and-not. a one lost.
And he rolled out in light spots,
100. Particularly, when the Cards
had third-and-4 deep in Bruin ter
ritory, Douglas rolled for 11 yards
and Stanford scored a few plays
later.
In the signal-calling department

I Douglas has shown more imagi
! nation than most of his predeces
! sors. He's done an excellent job
j of mixing up his plays, alt hough
I railing, on Shea and A 1 Harring
ton to carry the ball on over half
■ the Stanford plays.
4.9 Average
Harrington stands second only
| to Shea among the Card ball-lug
gers. He's carried 02 times for
305 yards and sports a sharp 4.!)
j average.
; Harrington has turned out to
j be the indispensable man in an
other department, too P.A.T.
kicking. Five times in a row ho
| has kicked the ball through the
! uprights. It's, meant five points

for Stanford in Iho Washington
and UCLA games.
In*lhe kicking and running de
partments, Oregon can counter
with Jack Morris. He's kicked
three field goals in six games 1 his
year and helped set up the three
with his 1.7 running average.
There are more who'll he in Iho
. offensive limelight, too. Jack Tay
lor, Jeri McMiliin, Rick McMillen

for Stanford; Charley Tourville,
Jack Crabtree for the Ducks
these backs anrl the others plus

a flock of good linemen should
make tomorrow's game among
the year's best of the PCC race.

The Stanford mentor wasn't
any more definite when he was
asked to single out the strongest
part of the Oregon game. "Rush
ing, passing, kicking, defense—
they ail worry me," was his reply.
Evenly Matched
From a statistical standpoint
the teams could hardly be more
evenly matched. Stanford leads
the PCC in total offense; the
Ducks hold the top spot in total
defense.
There's going to be about 100
yards that'll have to give some
where, however. Casanova's crew
is giving up just 230.3 yards per
game, but the Indians have been
rolling up over 333 yards per en
counter.
On the other side of the ledger,
things are more balanced. Ore
gon has driven .for 258.8 yards in
each 60 minutes -of play, while
Card defenders have allowed I he
average opponent to pile up 298.2
yards of ground.
Five io Five
An over-fill look at the 10 de
partments in which the PCC
keeps statistics shows Stanford
ahead in five and Ihe Ducks on
top in a like number.
Taylor's men hold- the upper
hand in rush offense, pass offense,
total offense,., interceptions jind
punting. Oregon is above the
Cards in punt returns, kickoff
returns, rush defense, pass de
fense and total defense.
In only one 'department pass
offense are the two clubs more
than three positions apart in the
statistical standings. In two de
partments -kickoff returns and
rush defense; tjie .Tribe and the
Webfoots rank one-two in the con
ference. In punting they're eighth
and ninth, respectively.
Fewest Fonts
Fortunately for Stanford, the
low place in the punting slats is
not as bad ;is it might be, since
the Cards have had to kick just
18 times this year nine less than
any other team in the conference.
Indian opponents have also re
turner] kicks less than two yards
per effort.
The principal offensive battle
will be waged "between tjie PCC
rushing leader, Chuck Shea of
Stanford, and the No. 2 man, Ore
gon's Jim Shanjey.
Although carrying five times
less than Shanley this year, Shea
has rolled up 172 yards to his op
ponent's 467. Although close in
statistics, the two are different
types of runners.
Standard SU Fullback
Shea follows the pattern of
Stanford fullbacks from the past.
He carries the ball on about one
third of the Indians' rushing plays
and gpes up the middle, off guard
and thekle, and around the ends
equally well.
Shea depends on power, for the
most part, and has done a top
flight job of shoving ahead for
extra yardage this year.
Shanley, on the other hand, is
a light runner (170 pounds) and
gains a lot of his yardage because
of his speed and agility. He runs
from the right-halfback slot and,
like Shea, carries the ball on
about one-third of his team's rush
ing plays.
Other Threats
Of course, these two runners
aren't the only offensive threats
on the field. In Jackie Douglas,
Stanford boasts one of the Coast's
most effective and efficient quar
terbacks.
He hit a phenomenal 10-for-12
in the passing department against
UCLA last week and hiked his
season's passing average to 53.3

per cent. He's specialized in short
tosses, although he proved he carr
throw the long ones with his 37-
yard touchdown heave to Joei
Freis against the Bruins.
Roll-Out Ability
Douglas' strongest poinl in re
lation to past greal quarterbacks
at Stanford is his ability lo roll
out. He did'it six times against
the Bruins and wound up with 35'
yards gained and-not. a one lost.
And he rolled out in light spots,
100. Particularly, when the Cards
had third-and-4 deep in Bruin ter
ritory, Douglas rolled for 11 yards
and Stanford scored a few plays
later.
In the signal-calling department

I Douglas has shown more imagi
! nation than most of his predeces
! sors. He's done an excellent job
j of mixing up his plays, alt hough
I railing, on Shea and A 1 Harring
ton to carry the ball on over half
■ the Stanford plays.
4.9 Average
Harrington stands second only
| to Shea among the Card ball-lug
gers. He's carried 02 times for

j average.
; Harrington has turned out to
j be the indispensable man in an
other department, too P.A.T.
kicking. Five times in a row ho
| has kicked the ball through the
! uprights. It's, meant five points

for Stanford in Iho Washington
and UCLA games.
In*lhe kicking and running de
partments, Oregon can counter
with Jack Morris. He's kicked
three field goals in six games 1 his
year and helped set up the three
with his 1.7 running average.
There are more who'll he in Iho
. offensive limelight, too. Jack Tay
lor, Jeri McMiliin, Rick McMillen

for Stanford; Charley Tourville,
Jack Crabtree for the Ducks
these backs anrl the others plus

a flock of good linemen should
make tomorrow's game among
the year's best of the PCC race.

The lure of I ho Pacific Coast Conference championship and a very
faint aroma of flowers will be in the air tomorrow when Oregon and
Stanford clash at $ p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
A crowd of more than 50,000 is expected to sit in on the struggle
between the PCC's number one and number three teams. Oregon

enters t ho game with a 4-0 mark
in conference play and a 5-1 sea
son mark. Chuck Taylor's In
dians are 2-1 in loop action, and
4-2 for the year.
The winner tomorrow will
move into a slight favorite's role
for both the title and the Ja;i. 1
assignment. Oregon, particularly,
would be in a commanding posi
tion if they won. A Stanford vic
tory, on the other hand, would
leave the Cards, Ducks and
Washington State Cougars each
with one loss in loop play.
Dark Horse and Long Shot
Oregon has been the dark
horse of the season, but the In
dians have been the real long
shots. While it has been the Ore
gon defense and running attack
that have surprised the experts,
Stanford has contributed its
share of surprises in rushing and
rush defense.
And then last week, the Tribe
pass defense came into its own
with a brilliant job against UC
LA. Stanford passing has been
at its usual high level of effi
ciency.
Stanford appears to be "up"
for the game. Taylor, when
asked if the Cards were as high
for the Ducks as for UCLA, re
plied, "Well, I think they should
be. but of course I can't get in
side of them and find out."
Taylor wouldn't make a predic

turner] kicks less than two yards
per effort.
The principal offensive battle
will be waged "between tjie PCC
rushing leader, Chuck Shea of
Stanford, and the No. 2 man, Ore
gon's Jim Shanjey.
Although carrying five times
less than Shanley this year, Shea
has rolled up 172 yards to his op
ponent's 467. Although close in
statistics, the two are different
types of runners.
Standard SU Fullback
Shea follows the pattern of
Stanford fullbacks from the past.
He carries the ball on about one
third of the Indians' rushing plays
and gpes up the middle, off guard
and thekle, and around the ends
equally well.
Shea depends on power, for the
most part, and has done a top
flight job of shoving ahead for
extra yardage this year.
Shanley, on the other hand, is
a light runner (170 pounds) and
gains a lot of his yardage because
of his speed and agility. He runs
from the right-halfback slot and,
like Shea, carries the ball on
about one-third of his team's rush
ing plays.
Other Threats
Of course, these two runners
aren't the only offensive threats
on the field. In Jackie Douglas,
Stanford boasts one of the Coast's
most effective and efficient quar
terbacks.
He hit a phenomenal 10-for-12
in the passing department against
UCLA last week and hiked his
season's passing average to 53.3

per cent. He's specialized in short
tosses, although he proved he carr
throw the long ones with his 37-
yard touchdown heave to Joei
Freis against the Bruins.
Roll-Out Ability
Douglas' strongest poinl in re
lation to past greal quarterbacks
at Stanford is his ability lo roll
out. He did'it six times against
the Bruins and wound up with 35'
yards gained and-not. a one lost.
And he rolled out in light spots,
100. Particularly, when the Cards
had third-and-4 deep in Bruin ter
ritory, Douglas rolled for 11 yards
and Stanford scored a few plays
later.
In the signal-calling department

I Douglas has shown more imagi
! nation than most of his predeces
! sors. He's done an excellent job
j of mixing up his plays, alt hough
I railing, on Shea and A 1 Harring
ton to carry the ball on over half
■ the Stanford plays.
4.9 Average
Harrington stands second only
| to Shea among the Card ball-lug
gers. He's carried 02 times for
305 yards and sports a sharp 4.!)
j average.
; Harrington has turned out to
j be the indispensable man in an
other department, too P.A.T.
kicking. Five times in a row ho
| has kicked the ball through the
! uprights. It's, meant five points

for Stanford in Iho Washington
and UCLA games.
In*lhe kicking and running de
partments, Oregon can counter
with Jack Morris. He's kicked
three field goals in six games 1 his
year and helped set up the three
with his 1.7 running average.
There are more who'll he in Iho
. offensive limelight, too. Jack Tay
lor, Jeri McMiliin, Rick McMillen

for Stanford; Charley Tourville,
Jack Crabtree for the Ducks
these backs anrl the others plus

a flock of good linemen should
make tomorrow's game among
the year's best of the PCC race.

The lure of I ho Pacific Coast Conference championship and a very
faint aroma of flowers will be in the air tomorrow when Oregon and
Stanford clash at $ p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
A crowd of more than 50,000 is expected to sit in on the struggle
between the PCC's number one and number three teams. Oregon

enters t ho game with a 4-0 mark
in conference play and a 5-1 sea
son mark. Chuck Taylor's In
dians are 2-1 in loop action, and
4-2 for the year.
The winner tomorrow will
move into a slight favorite's role
for both the title and the Ja;i. 1
assignment. Oregon, particularly,
would be in a commanding posi
tion if they won. A Stanford vic
tory, on the other hand, would
leave the Cards, Ducks and
Washington State Cougars each
with one loss in loop play.
Dark Horse and Long Shot
Oregon has been the dark
horse of the season, but the In
dians have been the real long
shots. While it has been the Ore
gon defense and running attack
that have surprised the experts,
Stanford has contributed its
share of surprises in rushing and
rush defense.
And then last week, the Tribe
pass defense came into its own
with a brilliant job against UC
LA. Stanford passing has been
at its usual high level of effi
ciency.
Stanford appears to be "up"
for the game. Taylor, when
asked if the Cards were as high
for the Ducks as for UCLA, re
plied, "Well, I think they should
be. but of course I can't get in
side of them and find out."
Taylor wouldn't make a predic
tion on the outcome of the game,
except to jokingly reply "0-0"
when he was asked to name the
final score.
The Stanford mentor wasn't
any more definite when he was
asked to single out the strongest
part of the Oregon game. "Rush
ing, passing, kicking, defense—
they ail worry me," was his reply.
Evenly Matched
From a statistical standpoint
the teams could hardly be more
evenly matched. Stanford leads
the PCC in total offense; the
Ducks hold the top spot in total
defense.
There's going to be about 100
yards that'll have to give some
where, however. Casanova's crew
is giving up just 230.3 yards per
game, but the Indians have been
rolling up over 333 yards per en
counter.
On the other side of the ledger,
things are more balanced. Ore
gon has driven .for 258.8 yards in
each 60 minutes -of play, while
Card defenders have allowed I he
average opponent to pile up 298.2
yards of ground.
Five io Five
An over-fill look at the 10 de
partments in which the PCC
keeps statistics shows Stanford
ahead in five and Ihe Ducks on

Taylor's men hold- the upper
hand in rush offense, pass offense,
total offense,., interceptions jind
punting. Oregon is above the
Cards in punt returns, kickoff
returns, rush defense, pass de
fense and total defense.
In only one 'department pass
offense are the two clubs more
than three positions apart in the
statistical standings. In two de
partments -kickoff returns and
rush defense; tjie .Tribe and the
Webfoots rank one-two in the con
ference. In punting they're eighth
and ninth, respectively.

Fortunately for Stanford, the
low place in the punting slats is
not as bad ;is it might be, since
the Cards have had to kick just
18 times this year nine less than
any other team in the conference.

kicking. Five times in a row ho

and UCLA games.
In*lhe kicking and running de
partments, Oregon can counter
with Jack Morris. He's kicked
three field goals in six games 1 his
year and helped set up the three
with his 1.7 running average.
There are more who'll he in Iho
. offensive limelight, too. Jack Tay
lor, Jeri McMiliin, Rick McMillen

for Stanford; Charley Tourville,
Jack Crabtree for the Ducks
these backs anrl the others plus

a flock of good linemen should
make tomorrow's game among
the year's best of the PCC race.

The lure of I ho Pacific Coast Conference championship and a very
faint aroma of flowers will be in the air tomorrow when Oregon and
Stanford clash at $ p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
A crowd of more than 50,000 is expected to sit in on the struggle
between the PCC's number one and number three teams. Oregon

enters t ho game with a 4-0 mark
in conference play and a 5-1 sea
son mark. Chuck Taylor's In
dians are 2-1 in loop action, and
4-2 for the year.
The winner tomorrow will
move into a slight favorite's role
for both the title and the Ja;i. 1
assignment. Oregon, particularly,
would be in a commanding posi
tion if they won. A Stanford vic
tory, on the other hand, would
leave the Cards, Ducks and
Washington State Cougars each
with one loss in loop play.
Dark Horse and Long Shot
Oregon has been the dark
horse of the season, but the In
dians have been the real long
shots. While it has been the Ore
gon defense and running attack
that have surprised the experts,
Stanford has contributed its
share of surprises in rushing and
rush defense.
And then last week, the Tribe
pass defense came into its own
with a brilliant job against UC
LA. Stanford passing has been
at its usual high level of effi
ciency.
Stanford appears to be "up"
for the game. Taylor, when
asked if the Cards were as high
for the Ducks as for UCLA, re
plied, "Well, I think they should
be. but of course I can't get in
side of them and find out."
Taylor wouldn't make a predic
tion on the outcome of the game,
except to jokingly reply "0-0"
when he was asked to name the
final score.
The Stanford mentor wasn't
any more definite when he was
asked to single out the strongest
part of the Oregon game. "Rush
ing, passing, kicking, defense—
they ail worry me," was his reply.
Evenly Matched
From a statistical standpoint
the teams could hardly be more
evenly matched. Stanford leads
the PCC in total offense; the
Ducks hold the top spot in total
defense.
There's going to be about 100
yards that'll have to give some
where, however. Casanova's crew
is giving up just 230.3 yards per
game, but the Indians have been
rolling up over 333 yards per en
counter.
On the other side of the ledger,
things are more balanced. Ore
gon has driven .for 258.8 yards in
each 60 minutes -of play, while
Card defenders have allowed I he
average opponent to pile up 298.2
yards of ground.
Five io Five
An over-fill look at the 10 de
partments in which the PCC
keeps statistics shows Stanford
ahead in five and Ihe Ducks on
top in a like number.
Taylor's men hold- the upper
hand in rush offense, pass offense,
total offense,., interceptions jind
punting. Oregon is above the
Cards in punt returns, kickoff
returns, rush defense, pass de
fense and total defense.
In only one 'department pass
offense are the two clubs more
than three positions apart in the
statistical standings. In two de
partments -kickoff returns and
rush defense; tjie .Tribe and the
Webfoots rank one-two in the con
ference. In punting they're eighth
and ninth, respectively.
Fewest Fonts
Fortunately for Stanford, the
low place in the punting slats is
not as bad ;is it might be, since
the Cards have had to kick just
18 times this year nine less than
any other team in the conference.
Indian opponents have also re
turner] kicks less than two yards
per effort.
The principal offensive battle
will be waged "between tjie PCC
rushing leader, Chuck Shea of
Stanford, and the No. 2 man, Ore
gon's Jim Shanjey.
Although carrying five times
less than Shanley this year, Shea
has rolled up 172 yards to his op
ponent's 467. Although close in
statistics, the two are different
types of runners.
Standard SU Fullback
Shea follows the pattern of
Stanford fullbacks from the past.
He carries the ball on about one
third of the Indians' rushing plays
and gpes up the middle, off guard
and thekle, and around the ends
equally well.
Shea depends on power, for the
most part, and has done a top
flight job of shoving ahead for
extra yardage this year.
Shanley, on the other hand, is
a light runner (170 pounds) and
gains a lot of his yardage because
of his speed and agility. He runs
from the right-halfback slot and,
like Shea, carries the ball on
about one-third of his team's rush
ing plays.
Other Threats
Of course, these two runners
aren't the only offensive threats
on the field. In Jackie Douglas,
Stanford boasts one of the Coast's
most effective and efficient quar
terbacks.
He hit a phenomenal 10-for-12
in the passing department against
UCLA last week and hiked his
season's passing average to 53.3

per cent. He's specialized in short
tosses, although he proved he carr
throw the long ones with his 37-
yard touchdown heave to Joei
Freis against the Bruins.
Roll-Out Ability
Douglas' strongest poinl in re
lation to past greal quarterbacks
at Stanford is his ability lo roll
out. He did'it six times against
the Bruins and wound up with 35'
yards gained and-not. a one lost.
And he rolled out in light spots,
100. Particularly, when the Cards
had third-and-4 deep in Bruin ter
ritory, Douglas rolled for 11 yards
and Stanford scored a few plays
