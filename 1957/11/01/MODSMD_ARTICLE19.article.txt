# Indians in Crucial with Oregon; PCC Title May Hang in Balance
## Cards, With Coast's Top Attack, To Meet Number One Defense Shea, Shanley Tangle for Hushing Leadership; Statistics Show Tribe, Ducks Evenly Matched 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The lure of I ho Pacific Coast Conference championship and a very
faint aroma of flowers will be in the air tomorrow when Oregon and
Stanford clash at $ p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
A crowd of more than 50,000 is expected to sit in on the struggle
between the PCC's number one and number three teams. Oregon

enters t ho game with a 4-0 mark
in conference play and a 5-1 sea
son mark. Chuck Taylor's In
dians are 2-1 in loop action, and
4-2 for the year.
The winner tomorrow will
move into a slight favorite's role
for both the title and the Ja;i. 1
assignment. Oregon, particularly,
would be in a commanding posi
tion if they won. A Stanford vic
tory, on the other hand, would
leave the Cards, Ducks and
Washington State Cougars each
with one loss in loop play.
Dark Horse and Long Shot
Oregon has been the dark
horse of the season, but the In
dians have been the real long
shots. While it has been the Ore
gon defense and running attack
that have surprised the experts,
Stanford has contributed its
share of surprises in rushing and
rush defense.
And then last week, the Tribe
pass defense came into its own
with a brilliant job against UC
LA. Stanford passing has been
at its usual high level of effi
ciency.
Stanford appears to be "up"
for the game. Taylor, when
asked if the Cards were as high
for the Ducks as for UCLA, re
plied, "Well, I think they should
be. but of course I can't get in
side of them and find out."
Taylor wouldn't make a predic
tion on the outcome of the game,
except to jokingly reply "0-0"
when he was asked to name the
final score.
The Stanford mentor wasn't
any more definite when he was
asked to single out the strongest
part of the Oregon game. "Rush
ing, passing, kicking, defense—
they ail worry me," was his reply.
Evenly Matched
From a statistical standpoint
the teams could hardly be more
evenly matched. Stanford leads
the PCC in total offense; the
Ducks hold the top spot in total
defense.
There's going to be about 100
yards that'll have to give some
where, however. Casanova's crew
