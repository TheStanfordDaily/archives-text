## Chinese Physicists Win Nobel Prize for U.S. 
### 
Compiled from Associated Press
Two young Chinese-born nuclear scientists — one of whom was
visiting professor at Stanford this summer—won the 1957 Nobel
prize in physics yesterday for removing important obstacles to the
understanding of the functions of the atom and the universe.
The joint winnors of the $42,000 award are Dr. Chen Ning Yang,

34-year-old professor of physics
at the Institute for Advanced
Study, Princeton, N.J., and Dr.
Tsung Dao Lee, 30, Columbia
University professor of physics
who is on leave and also at the
Princeton Institute.
Dr. Lee taught at Stanford this
summer, giving special advanced
lectures on the subject for which
he won the Nobel prize, accord
ing to Stanford Professor of
Physics Leonard I. Schiff.
Parity Law
Drs. Lee and Yang theorized
that the parity law did not hold
for some atomic particles at
least. The experiments they pro
posed showed that these particles
have a favored rotation or spin as
an intrinsic property.
The award to Drs. Lee and
Yang is the 18th physics prize
won by America. Britain runs
second with 16.
Completing the 1937 N'obel
choices, the chemistry prize was
awarded yesterday to Sir Alexan
der Todd of Cambridge Univer
sity, 50 - year - old Scotland - born
biologist, for fundamental re
search on matter inside the sim
plest of cells.
The citation of the Swedish
Academy of Science said the two
(Lee and Yang) were honored
"for their profound investiga
tions of the so-called laws of par
ity, which have led to important
discoveries regarding sub-atomic
particles."
New Hypothesis
The hypothesis they formulat
ed, and subsequent experiments
by Dr. Chien Shiung Wu of Co
lumbia, in effect blew up the par
ity laws in nuclear physics, which
had been generally recognized
for more than three decades as
fundamental laws of nature.
The discoveries enable physi
cists to restore some intelligible
order to the bewildering picture
of the goings-on inside the atom.
