# Ground Rules for Letters
## 
### 
F.VHtY M WSI'AI'I K is flattered when readership
response in the form of "Fetters to the Editor'
rises lo what appears to be an all-time high.
The Daily is no exception to this flattery.
I nforturiatelv, The l)ail\ is limited by size
to the amount of letters it can run—unfor
tunately, because many of the letters raise
thought-provoking questions that have stimu
lated much discussion throughout the campus
on pertinent issues facing Stanford students.
Up lo the present lime, every letter received
lias been printed. But the time lag between
the receipt of the letter and its appearance in
typesetting of the letter and ils appearance in
'I he Daily has reached a full week. Such delay
is not good for the purposes of those letters.
We''therefore believe it would be best to lay
down some definite ground rules regarding the
publishing of letters.

First, maximum length should be between
150 aiui 201) words. Louder letters will of neees
»il\ be edited hy ourselves to proper length.
Seeond. ail letteiN must be signed and verified
as to authorship bv a member ol' the staff. In
cluding the telephone number ol the signer
would facilitate such verification, litis docs
not mean a letter cannot run under an anony
mous name: it merely says that, for the protec
tion of The Dailv, the author must he known
to us. Names will he removed only at the dis
cretion of the editor. From today on, no un
signed letter will he acceptable for publication.
Third. 110 letter from an active candidate for
office can be published unless that letter was
1 1
received by us prior to the start of active cam*
paigning. Otherwise, such letter can be run
only after elections are over, or if the author
is no longer in contention for office.
