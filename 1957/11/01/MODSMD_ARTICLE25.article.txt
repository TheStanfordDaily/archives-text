Not al All Bewildered
Editor, The Daily:
Let's get the facts straight!- We are freshmen,
and we aren't at all bewildered. Our sponsor was
among the many who, in explaining the liquor
Jaw, pointed out to us its intricacies. She ex
plained that at private, off-campus parties drink
ing is allowable and to a degree not in conflict
wilh the Fundamental Standard. We also under
stand that ihe third-person responsibility, as usu
ally interpreted under the Fundamental Standard,
i«, not to report the organization that is taking all
possible precautions to comply with the law and
lo remind those individuals who are violating it.
Hut naturally there are those who have different
interpretations.
Anyhow, why aren't these experienced frater
nity men able to size up the girls they invite to
iheir social functions? They are showing their
embarrassment at their inability to pick iheir
women by implying that ALL freshman girls and
their sponsors are naive children, and ridiculing
1 lie entire freshman class-for the actions of a few.
Two Non-Bewildered Freshmen
Don't Despair, Freshman Girl
Editor, The Daily:
ODE TO THE
"BEWILDERED FRESHMAN GIRL"
Once a long time ago,
In Stanford fraternity land,
A very important thing
Known as Fun Stan
Was thought best to be forgotten.
At parties and dances
All there closed their eyes,
Hoping in this way
That the Standard would die
And be forgotten.
Unfortunately for the "big men,"
The most sad part is
That for freshmen and many others
The Standard still lives
And shall never be forgotten.
Don't despair, Freshman Girl!
If fraternities aren't
What you thought them to be. remember—
There are ALWAYS more fish in the sea
(Some are best forgotten.)
Anonymous
'Bewildered" Commended
Editor, The Daily:
It is with great consternation that I read the
condemning note from "Bewildered Freshman
Girl" in Friday's edition.
This young maiden, suddenly elevated to the
position of "college woman," obviously has not
yet fully adjusted herself to the peculiarities of
such a life. She has found herself in a social
windfall after a chaste high school life and, ap
parently, has not yet learned to control herself
to fit the patterns of her new social environment.
And yet it is admirable that this young lady
has maintained her moral equilibrium while un
dergoing her social successes. Seeing a situation
which she know to be against the principles of
the Fundamental Standard (and the law), she
promptly reported ft to her sponsor, who had
steadfastly attempted to maintain this freshman
miss's moral concepts.
Drinking among fraternities is known to exist
and is generally accepted by the student body.
Certainly a good many college women have no
objection to tipping a can or two themselves.
Bewildered Freshman Girl has certainly shown
a distinct lack of tolerance. However, I must
point out, unhappily, that her intolerance would
not have pushed itself to the fore probably if the
rowdiness which followed the drinking had not
occurred.
As a fraternity man. I must admit that any
college man who respected his date, especially
one who did not favor drinking herself, would not
drink se much as to be rowdy and indulge in some
unnecessary boisterousness.
Jf these fraternity»men were being as obnox
ious as she seemed to think they were, she is to
be praised for maintaining her moral standards
and reporting a flagrant violation of Stanford's
guiding document.
I, for one, say to you, Bewildered Freshman
Girl, that I regret the behavior of these fraternity
men, and you needn't he bewildered any more.
You're lo be commended.
Ashamed Fraterni'fy Man
I'.S. It dates are really that hard to find now,
I'd like to meet you.
I rne Stanford Boy
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to "Bewildered Freshman Girl" . . .
I am a true Stanford boy, fully believing and
practicing all of the ideas and standards which
are evident in the Fundamental Standard under
which our Stanford Family has risen to such

great heights. I must say that I am frightfully
happy to discover a freshman girl who has in
stilled in her the same loyal spirit and regard for
Stanford's wonderful Family as I.
Yes, "Bewildered Freshman Girl," you were
right to turn in your date and his fraternity
friends for drunkenness and rowdiness. After all,
we must all have our personal spirit and desire
to keep Stanford's wonderful Family as pure and
clean as we can.
To meet such a person with such high Stanford
ideals as you is my one desire. 1 would appreciate
any information as to your whereabouts.
Stanley Stern Boy
P.S.—I didn't have any dates in high school either.
Heading for San Jose
Editor, The Daily:
Re "Bewildered Freshman Girl" letter of last
Friday [Oct. 25]: It's nauseating!! Here I've
been half-gassed ever since I've been here. I'd
heard Stanford was a party-time school. And
what do 1 find? No less than three fraternities
have turned me in. What is all this, anyway?
I'm heading for the talent at San Jose.
Frustrated Freshman Woman
Psendo Self-Righteousness
Editor, The Daily:
In a frenzy of utter disgust, I would like to
reply to the put-up letter of the "bewildered fresh
man" of Friday last, and to the drastic actions of
Fraternity Royv.
Undoubtedly, there is a faction among the
freshman women given to a pseudo-self-righteous
ness which prompts them to turn in the "alcohol
ics" on campus. But—because these females are
definitely in the minority —it is unfair to in
discriminately levy fines for dating freshman
women. As yet. we are uncertain whether this is
really being enforced, or whether it is a nasty
rumor spread by frustrated sophomores. But, if
true, the future life of Fraternity Row will be
come quite dull due to the lack of the more
spirited freshman girls.
A Party-Time Freshman
To Stanford Girls
Editor, The Daily:
ODE TO STANFORD GIRLS
FROM A FRESHMAN BOY
I used to think about defeat
Like happening to Pete,
Or Sam, or some ancient Greek.
Only now it's me that's up the creek.
Old Panic has the base of my spine so tight
I can hardly get my sleep at night;
And in my dreams the terrible foe
Is just freshman girls shouting, "No! No! No!"
There's not even a candidate
For a Thursday study-date
Who isn't busy until December.
Why, 1 can hardly even remember
When I got my last good-night kiss.
It looks like the situation boils down to this:
There are always lots of guys girls paint the
town on,
But fundamentally it's always me they frown on.
Sigh
Strawberry Duel
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to challenge the earful of mature
Stanford students who landed a large handful of
jam on the side of my skirt Sunday night, while
a friend and I were walking home from the post
office, to a little tournament: Strawberry Pre
serves at 15 paces loser pay the cleaning bill.
Branner Hall Freshman
UC Rooting Section
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter to the editor, Mr. MacFarland coir,-
mented upon the exemplary behavior of the UC
rooting section, noting that no instances of card
lossing were observed. He asked, rhetorically,
how such restraint had been achieved. I feel that
I can answer him.
At the Cal-Navy game the previous week, the
completion of ihe card stunts saw ihe rooting
section throw the cards with ihe same carefree,
irresponsible elan that has so far characterized
the Stanford section. As envisioned by Mr. Mac-
Farland, one of the students was seriously hurt,
the card striking him just below an eye, severely
lacerating his cheek. He was removed from the
stands to an ambulance hastily summoned to the
scene, observed by a hushed—and, it is felt, thor
oughly chastened rooting section. The yell lead
er then appealed to the students to pledge that
there would be no repetition of such irresponsible
behavior in the future. They did, and, from the
results reported last week, it would appear that
such a pledge was observed.
Let-us hope that such an incident will be un
necessary to insure observance of common-sense
handling of the cards after the stunts have been
completed.

Sophomores, Perhaps ?
Editor, The Daily:
This is a letter from a genuine frosh girl—
unlike the first one you printed. Let's hope you
print this one and give us other poor girls a
chance to defend ourselves!
First of all, since the first incident of a fra
ternity being turned in for drinking, I understand
that a couple of others have been reported also.
What makes everyone think that freshman girls
have been responsible for this? Is it definitely
known, or are we just the likeliest suspects?
Maybe it was sophomore girls pretending to be
freshmen.
In any case, I can see how those girls who re
ported the drinking were confused. They had
been filled with a lot of talk on the Fundamental
Standard, and they were told it applied every
where. They didn't catch on that most Stanford
students dra\\- a line between the Fundamental
Standard and drinking, and that they don't apply
it to liquor at all.
All technicalities aside, however, since I am not
writing a letter to excuse Ihese girls. But why
should the entire class of freshman girls bo
blamed for the actions of a few? I think that the
majority of us are dry behind the ears, and, in
any case, I don't like the business of reporting
people. If freshman (or any class) girls are
against drinking, they shouldn't attend fraternity
parties where they know there is going to be
drinking. 1 scarcely feel that, if they do attend,
they have the right to turn around and report
their date and his friends for drinking. By even
attending they are making themselves accessories
to the crime—something that these girls seemed
to forget!
Both my friends and I have been to quite a few
fraternity parties since school has started, and,
if wo chose, could probably have put most of
Fraternity Row on Social Pro. Needless to say,
we appreciated being invited enough not to med
dle in what was really none of our business.
The Fun Stan is a fine thing, and it worked
very well up to a certain point—in test, stealing
and most of the things thai we consider morally
wrong anyway. But, actually, what is really
wrongywith drinking? I don't drink myself, but,
if the boys want to, why should Stanford be any
different from the nearly two thousand other
campuses across the country? I realize, of course,
lhat Mrs. Stanford's will forbids drinking on
campus, and I am referring to off-campus parties.
Why, in the first place, does California place a
21 -year-old age limit on drinking, anyway? In
New York the limit is 18, and Ihe law is strictly
enforced up to lhat age- which I think is more
sensible. Or are kids in California younger than
on the East Coast?
After all, if 18-year-olds are old enough to fight
and be killed (I realize that: this particular argu
ment is so old that it has gray hair, but I think
il is applicable in this case), then they should
have enough sense to decide for themselves
whether or not to drink!
I've gotten rather off Ihe subject of the frosh
girls, but I guess I have made it clear that we
(most of us) resent being regarded as tattletales,
babies and naive little fools who don't know what
the score is! It is particularly galling to learn
that many fraternities have started fining their
members So for bringing a freshman girl to a
party.
You probably won't consider this letter impor
tant enough to print, but I hope you will. This is
a controversial subject, especially the Fundamen
tal Standard, but I hope lhat the people whose
general feelings I have put into words will be

honest with themselves. Anyway, let's not blame
all of us for what has happened —it is nice to see
such idealism even if we don't share it.
Boys, if you continue to be flown on the frosh
girls, you just don't know what you are missing
in the way of good dates!!

Pompon Girls Applaud
Editor, The Daily:
We want to thank all the Stanford rooters who
made the card stunts so "fantastic" at last Satur
day's game.
The pompon girls were standing on the shady
side of the field, waiting to participate in the
band performance. When we saw the card stunts
we thought we were looking at the famous UCLA
section . . . but we weren't. It was Stanford's
section that was stealing the show. '
Thanks again, and keep up the good work!

Agree Willi Mr. Egger
Editor, The Daily:
Having spent the past year in a "junior year
abroad" situation at Edinburgh University, I
would like to agree emphatically with Mr. Eg
ger's views stated in his letter of Oct. 23. Cer
tainly, in providing a fortress of Americanism,
the University is creating an artificial-situation
Stuttgart which will nearly preclude any student
contact with the German people in any save a
superficial way. How many German students
would feel bold enough to knock at the gate to
inquire if a particular Stanfordite would care to
spend a week of the coming holiday with him at
his home? And how many deep friendships could
be formed with the German students in the
pourse ot "class-acquaintance" during two terms?
I feel, on the basis of my experience in Scot
land. that the real value gained in being abroad
consists in 1) living in the university community
with the native students and having the oppor
tunity such an experience offers to form deep
and lasting friendships, and 2) being, as a result
of this first opportunity, invited to "come home
for a week" during the holidays.
As Mr. Egger points out, there 1s in tourism
only a most superficial glimpse of a country; and,
though Stanford students at Stuttgart will lie
localized in one area for a greater length of time
than the average tourist spends, I wonder if the
longer term will make appreciable difference in
the total acquaintanceship they have With less
superficial relationships. I count my good for
tune in being with girls in the university hostel
and staying in their homes as the most meaning
ful and valuable part of the year. In the "Stan
ford abroad" program there seems to be little or
no chance of any such experience.
As an introduction to Europe, the "Stanford
extension" plan may have certain advantages in
easing the hesitant student gently into the diffi
culties which a foreign country and especially a
foreign language present. But for the student
who would prefer to spend a year removed from
the standards, ideologies and customs of his own
country, 1 feel that Stanford could better be of
service in 1 > the location and presentation of in
formation and evaluating materials regarding
universities abroad in which the student could
enroll on equal terms with all others for a full
academic year, and in 2) the adoption of a more
liberal basis for credit transfer than "Stanford
course equivalents only."
