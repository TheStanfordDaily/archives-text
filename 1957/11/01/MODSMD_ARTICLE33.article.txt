People who speculate about Stanford's chances to go to the You-
Know-VVhat t>n You-Know-When at YouKnow-Where are either (1)
crazy, or (2) haven't had the "opportunity" of following Stanford
football through such interesting seasons as 19153 and 1956. Now I
certainly don't mean to say that I don't think we have a chance to
be There Then. 1 just prefer to think about the Pacific Coast Con
ference race rather than fhe "Sprint for the Thorny Things." And
can they be thorny!
At any rate, the aforementioned PCC race presents an interest
ing contest for our collective viewing pleasures tomorrow when a
darned good Oregon team takes on a darned surprising Stanford
club. Now maybe loyalty blinds me, or maybe I'm prejudiced, or
maybe I just think Stanford has a better team than Oregon. Prob
ably it's a combination of these three that prompts me to pick our
men to win. Now the only thing we need to cinch the victory is for
Herman Hickman to pick Oregon. With all due respect to Herman's
selections, he always seem;; to go wrong* on Stanford games.

Interesting reports have filtered up from Southland newspapers
following last week's pleasing victory over the Bruins. The most
interesting of these comes from an article by Bob Seizer in the Los
Angeles Mirror News. Ilere are a few of Seizor's Monday morning
remarks:
. . Practically to a man, Bruin players feel the Indians will
whip the Ducks when they meet Saturday in (lie battle thai should
settle this Rose Bowl issue once and for all.
"Unofficially, Red Sanders alvo leans to Stanford in the crucial
conference game. However, all he would tell hungry Bay Area
scribes was, 'It's impossible to compare one team to the other.'"
to to to
In a completely different vein comes this remark in Sid Ziff's
"The Inside Track," in the Mirror-News:
"l)o you know what else has taken a big drop this year? Pro
gram sales are away off at both SC and IJ(LA games'. SC was
really stuck on the Michigan game. It's not just a local trend —
hut also has been reported at the University of California as well."
Stanford's athletic publicity director, Don Liebendorfer, was in
terested in this report, and had a few interesting observations of
his own to add on the matter of programs. As far as 1957 sales were
concerned, Don thought they were running at a normal rate one
program to every three to four admissions although he didn't have
exact figures available for this
season.

Don wont on to say th;tt the
basic idea behind Stanford pro
grams "isn't to gain revenue, but
to provide a service." Stanford is
one of the very few schools in the
country that sell football -pro
grams for 25 cents. At the Coli
seum, and most other places,
you'll pay 50 cents for what is
essentially the same thing.
Sure Stanford programs arq
smaller—they don't have as much
advertising. But the programs do
have rosters, pictures, line-ups—
ihe things a program is supposed
to have. One thing Stanford pro
grams don't have is written copy
about the game. And yon know
why? Because the sort of balo
ney that appears in other pro
grams has to be written several
weeks ahead, and usually doesn't

say a thing. Don commented on this very soundly: "I'd rather see
the fans spend a dime for a newspaper and get up-to-the-minute in
formation than spend the extra quarter on :t program and get old
news."
Watch for the Game Masterpiece
I'm all for Don Liebendowfer's ideas on programs. When you go
down to the USC game, see if the extra quarter brings you much
except a friendly word from all the beaneries in the vicinity of the
Coliseum. There's just one principal exception to the Stanford policy
of a quarter a program. That's the Big Game masterpiece, which
Don guarantees will be well worth the 50 cents.
While on the subject of programs, Don reminded us that Stan
ford's the only school around which furnishes free basketball pro
grams. "So what?" you say. "All they have is* line-ups." So what
more do you need? This conversation between a couple of Cal fans
at last year's Card-Bear basketball game down here might serve to
clear up the point: ,
Fan Number One: "Boy, these programs sure don't have much
in the way of pictures or anything, do they?"
Fan Number Two: "No, but the price sure is right."

CORRECTION: Last week we referred to our Seattle pilot as
Howard Miller. Turns out that I carelessly combined the names of
two of the flight crew. The- pilot was Howard Hunter; the other
man in the cockpit was Rusty Miller.
ONE LAST NOTE—on' the Daily predictions. The action has
perked up the last few weeks with Huntress, Frey and Simpson tak
ing the lead at various stages. One thing, though, the Daily leader
has a consistently higher average than the leading handicappers in
ihe metropolitan papers. And .they're a heckuva lot higher than
Hickman.

Interesting reports have filtered up from Southland newspapers
following last week's pleasing victory over the Bruins. The most
interesting of these comes from an article by Bob Seizer in the Los
Angeles Mirror News. Ilere are a few of Seizor's Monday morning
remarks:
. . Practically to a man, Bruin players feel the Indians will
whip the Ducks when they meet Saturday in (lie battle thai should
settle this Rose Bowl issue once and for all.
"Unofficially, Red Sanders alvo leans to Stanford in the crucial
conference game. However, all he would tell hungry Bay Area
scribes was, 'It's impossible to compare one team to the other.'"
to to to
In a completely different vein comes this remark in Sid Ziff's
"The Inside Track," in the Mirror-News:
"l)o you know what else has taken a big drop this year? Pro
gram sales are away off at both SC and IJ(LA games'. SC was
really stuck on the Michigan game. It's not just a local trend —
hut also has been reported at the University of California as well."
Stanford's athletic publicity director, Don Liebendorfer, was in
terested in this report, and had a few interesting observations of
his own to add on the matter of programs. As far as 1957 sales were
concerned, Don thought they were running at a normal rate one
program to every three to four admissions although he didn't have
exact figures available for this
season.

Don wont on to say th;tt the
basic idea behind Stanford pro
grams "isn't to gain revenue, but
to provide a service." Stanford is
one of the very few schools in the
country that sell football -pro
grams for 25 cents. At the Coli
seum, and most other places,
you'll pay 50 cents for what is
essentially the same thing.
Sure Stanford programs arq
smaller—they don't have as much
advertising. But the programs do
have rosters, pictures, line-ups—
ihe things a program is supposed
to have. One thing Stanford pro
grams don't have is written copy
about the game. And yon know
why? Because the sort of balo
ney that appears in other pro
grams has to be written several
weeks ahead, and usually doesn't

say a thing. Don commented on this very soundly: "I'd rather see
the fans spend a dime for a newspaper and get up-to-the-minute in
formation than spend the extra quarter on :t program and get old
news."
Watch for the Game Masterpiece
I'm all for Don Liebendowfer's ideas on programs. When you go
down to the USC game, see if the extra quarter brings you much
except a friendly word from all the beaneries in the vicinity of the
Coliseum. There's just one principal exception to the Stanford policy
of a quarter a program. That's the Big Game masterpiece, which
Don guarantees will be well worth the 50 cents.
While on the subject of programs, Don reminded us that Stan
ford's the only school around which furnishes free basketball pro
grams. "So what?" you say. "All they have is* line-ups." So what
more do you need? This conversation between a couple of Cal fans
at last year's Card-Bear basketball game down here might serve to
clear up the point: ,
Fan Number One: "Boy, these programs sure don't have much
in the way of pictures or anything, do they?"
Fan Number Two: "No, but the price sure is right."

CORRECTION: Last week we referred to our Seattle pilot as
Howard Miller. Turns out that I carelessly combined the names of
two of the flight crew. The- pilot was Howard Hunter; the other
man in the cockpit was Rusty Miller.
ONE LAST NOTE—on' the Daily predictions. The action has
perked up the last few weeks with Huntress, Frey and Simpson tak
ing the lead at various stages. One thing, though, the Daily leader
has a consistently higher average than the leading handicappers in
ihe metropolitan papers. And .they're a heckuva lot higher than
Hickman.

"The Inside Track," in the Mirror-News:
"l)o you know what else has taken a big drop this year? Pro
gram sales are away off at both SC and IJ(LA games'. SC was
really stuck on the Michigan game. It's not just a local trend —
hut also has been reported at the University of California as well."
Stanford's athletic publicity director, Don Liebendorfer, was in
terested in this report, and had a few interesting observations of
his own to add on the matter of programs. As far as 1957 sales were
concerned, Don thought they were running at a normal rate one
program to every three to four admissions although he didn't have
exact figures available for this
season.

Don wont on to say th;tt the
basic idea behind Stanford pro
grams "isn't to gain revenue, but
to provide a service." Stanford is
one of the very few schools in the
country that sell football -pro
grams for 25 cents. At the Coli
seum, and most other places,
you'll pay 50 cents for what is
essentially the same thing.
Sure Stanford programs arq
smaller—they don't have as much
advertising. But the programs do
have rosters, pictures, line-ups—
ihe things a program is supposed
to have. One thing Stanford pro
grams don't have is written copy
about the game. And yon know
why? Because the sort of balo
ney that appears in other pro
grams has to be written several
weeks ahead, and usually doesn't

say a thing. Don commented on this very soundly: "I'd rather see
the fans spend a dime for a newspaper and get up-to-the-minute in
formation than spend the extra quarter on :t program and get old
news."
Watch for the Game Masterpiece
I'm all for Don Liebendowfer's ideas on programs. When you go
down to the USC game, see if the extra quarter brings you much
except a friendly word from all the beaneries in the vicinity of the
Coliseum. There's just one principal exception to the Stanford policy
of a quarter a program. That's the Big Game masterpiece, which
Don guarantees will be well worth the 50 cents.
While on the subject of programs, Don reminded us that Stan
ford's the only school around which furnishes free basketball pro
grams. "So what?" you say. "All they have is* line-ups." So what
more do you need? This conversation between a couple of Cal fans
at last year's Card-Bear basketball game down here might serve to
clear up the point: ,
Fan Number One: "Boy, these programs sure don't have much
in the way of pictures or anything, do they?"
Fan Number Two: "No, but the price sure is right."

CORRECTION: Last week we referred to our Seattle pilot as
Howard Miller. Turns out that I carelessly combined the names of
two of the flight crew. The- pilot was Howard Hunter; the other
man in the cockpit was Rusty Miller.
ONE LAST NOTE—on' the Daily predictions. The action has
perked up the last few weeks with Huntress, Frey and Simpson tak
ing the lead at various stages. One thing, though, the Daily leader
has a consistently higher average than the leading handicappers in
ihe metropolitan papers. And .they're a heckuva lot higher than
Hickman.

People who speculate about Stanford's chances to go to the You-
Know-VVhat t>n You-Know-When at YouKnow-Where are either (1)
crazy, or (2) haven't had the "opportunity" of following Stanford
football through such interesting seasons as 19153 and 1956. Now I
certainly don't mean to say that I don't think we have a chance to
be There Then. 1 just prefer to think about the Pacific Coast Con
ference race rather than fhe "Sprint for the Thorny Things." And
can they be thorny!
At any rate, the aforementioned PCC race presents an interest
ing contest for our collective viewing pleasures tomorrow when a
darned good Oregon team takes on a darned surprising Stanford
club. Now maybe loyalty blinds me, or maybe I'm prejudiced, or
maybe I just think Stanford has a better team than Oregon. Prob
ably it's a combination of these three that prompts me to pick our
men to win. Now the only thing we need to cinch the victory is for
Herman Hickman to pick Oregon. With all due respect to Herman's
selections, he always seem;; to go wrong* on Stanford games.

Interesting reports have filtered up from Southland newspapers
following last week's pleasing victory over the Bruins. The most
interesting of these comes from an article by Bob Seizer in the Los
Angeles Mirror News. Ilere are a few of Seizor's Monday morning
remarks:
. . Practically to a man, Bruin players feel the Indians will
whip the Ducks when they meet Saturday in (lie battle thai should
settle this Rose Bowl issue once and for all.
"Unofficially, Red Sanders alvo leans to Stanford in the crucial
conference game. However, all he would tell hungry Bay Area
scribes was, 'It's impossible to compare one team to the other.'"
