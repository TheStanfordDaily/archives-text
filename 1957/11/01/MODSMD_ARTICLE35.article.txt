## Harriers Face SJS Here 
### 
Freshman Keith Wallace, the
hottest distance-running prospeqt
to hit the Stanford campus in
years, will had (lie Indian cross
country forces in ;i return match
with San Jose State today at 4
p.m. on ihe Stanford Golf Course.
Last Saturday the Indians fell
1o San Jose, among others, in a
quadrangular meet held here. The
dual meet score between the iwo
Was 25-30 for the Spartans.
This week the Cards think the
result will be different. Coach
Paytoii Jordan was flisappoinled
when his second-through-; eventh
men failed to run as a gn up and
got lost in the pack in the race
against Cal. SJS and UCLA.
Jordan thinks his men have
learned a valuable lesson from
last week's race and will be ready
1o keep up with the Spartans.
Shows Promise
Wallace, who finished third be
hind SJS's Wes Bond and UCLA's
Bobby Seaman, shows promise of
being an all-time Stanford dis
tance great.
Jordan praises the Piedmont
High graduate, noting that he is
"extremely coachable." The coach
sa if I that on a basis of his race
against much more experienced
runnel's last week, Wallace looks
to have prospects for a great run
ning future. His time of 21:58
was the best ever aimed in by a
Card on the four-mile course.

| The Card had five other men in
the 22-minute bracket to show
! great improvement from last
year, when only Hirer* men could
break 2.3 minutes all season.
"Twice (lie Team"
"This year's team," exclaimed
Jordan, "is twice the team we had
last year! Of course, that doesn't
"mean we're anywhere near per
fect, bin it's improvement."
The only newcomer to the team
of seven for Stanford will be jun-
I ior Ernie Cunliffe. He laid off
last track season with leg trouble
and then was hit by influenza this
fall. But last week he came back
in fine shape to place seventh

among the Stanford entries, al
though running unofficially.
Other Entries
The balance of the team will
consist of Doug Martin, Maury
Graves, Bob Moir/.ingo, Norman
Lloyd and Bob McGuire.
Jordan announced that after
Hie race, at -1:1") on Angell Field,
exhibition competition in the hop
step-jump and the hammer throw
will be held. John Kelly, who ex
ceeded 48 feet in the triple .jump
last spring, will be the featured
attraction. Athletes from San Jose
State and the Santa Clara Youth
Center will also compete in the
special events.

Bobby Seaman, shows promise of
being an all-time Stanford dis
tance great.

"extremely coachable." The coach
sa if I that on a basis of his race
against much more experienced
runnel's last week, Wallace looks
