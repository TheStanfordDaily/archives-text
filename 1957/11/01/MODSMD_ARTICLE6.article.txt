# Knight Quits Gov. Race, Seeks Senate
## Knowland Uncontested On Republican Slate, Faces Brown in Finals 
### 
Compiled from Associated Press
The San Francisco Examiner,
the San Francisco Chronicle and
the Los Angeles Times said to
day that Governor Knight has de
cided to run for the Senate rather
| than seek re-election. Such action
| would leave Senator William F.
Knowland a clear field in the
Republican governorship pr i -
mary.
In a story hy its political spe
cialist, Clint Mosher, the Exam
iner said Knight reached his de
cision only after lunch yesterday
and that the White House and
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
were notified that the decision
was "official." Mosher said that
the Examiner's information all
came from Washington.
No Comment
Knight's press secretary, Tom
Bright, contacted Knight's execu
tive secretary, Newton Stearns,
at Knight's vacation hideaway
and quoted the governor as say
ing he had t no comment on the
Examiner ' story. Bright said
Knight "doesn't deny or affirm"
the story. Bright added he was
not aware of any further state
ment to come from the governor
immediately.
Before the announcement of
Knight's change in plans, Vice-
President Nixon had declined to
make a choice between Knight
and Knowland. hinting, however,
that he would openly announce
his support for one or the other
sometime early next year.
The Opponents
If Knight seeks the Senate seat
Knowland will vacate next year,
his Democratic opponent is not
yet certain. Perhaps the front
runner is Representative Claire
Engle of Red Bluff, liberal Demo
crat who has taken a strong
stand on the public power ques
tion and is active in promoting a
solution to the state's tangled wa
ter rights issue.
For the governorship, Know
land would face Attorney Gen
eral Edmund G. <Pat> Brown, the
only Democrat thus far to an
nounce his candidacy.
The other Republican candi
date for the Senate. State Con
troller Robert C. Kirkwood, ap
peared surprised yesterday when
told that newspapers say Knight
plans to run for the Senate.
