## 
### 
Two c;i r s parked on Galvez
.Street between I louver Tower and
Etvina wore extensively damaged
las! night when ;i third ear driven
hy a 75-year-old man from San
.lose liii one of the ears, knocking
il up onto the curb and into the
second ear, and then hil the sec
ond car directly. No one was in
jured.
I ardwig Koenig, driver and own
er o(. Ihe moving car, was on his
way home to San .lose, hut he had
taken a wrong turn, lie was driv
ing up Galvez Street toward Stein j
I la!l.
IJnahle to see the road clearly
be 'rinse of headlights of approach-!
ing ears, he saw, by Ihe tail lights, i
that thecar in front of him turned j
to the right, and believed that the i
road turned also. He swung right
and hit the two parked cars.
The policeman at the scene said
that possibly, when Koenig sud
denly saw the cars in front'oil
him, he braced for the crash, and,
with his foot possibly on the ac
celerator, the car shot forward |
and struck Ihe cars.
Observers said the moving carl
was going slowly and was possi-!
bly in second gear. Its brakes j
were probably good enough to I
stop such a slow-moving vehicle.
The first parked car hit. a 191S i
Pontine owned bv graduate stu
dent Chester A. Kisiel, had to be |
lowed away, as did Koenig's car.
The second parked ear, a Chevro
let owned by Essie A. Pursell, was
in running condition after Ihe ac
cident, except thai the gasoline
tank was damaged so that, if over
filled, it could be ignited by the
exhaust pipe.
