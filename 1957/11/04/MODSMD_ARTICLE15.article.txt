NEW YORK (/I') Next on Russia's space time table cutiltl be a
| rocket landing on I lie moon.
Russian scientists say they hope to do it. Typically, no date vv.t;
j Riven. But the time could be closer than the rest of the world thin!';
One clue is that they talk about it at all.

Predictions
Repeatedly through this last
summer, Moscow Radio gave!
brief statements saying a baby I
moon would be launched "soon." I
That's ambiguousâ€”it could have
meant the next day or next year.
They never said, "We will try to
do it tomorrow."
There's some speculation that
! perhaps these statements meant
j a test firing of Sputnik was im
i minent. Then if it didn't work,
the Soviets wouldn't be commit
ted even to saying there had been
j an attempt that failed.
Success
When Sputnik the first soared
up, Russia said it had succeeded
on the very first try, in a mighty
difficult feat.
A week ago Moscow Radio said
a dog would soon go into space.
She's up there now, the loneli
est dog in our known universe.
So talk of a rocket to hit the
man in the moon could mean an
| imminent attempt.
Such a rocket could explode a
I bright flare to tell of its arrival.

If a doggy satellite is not a big
enough surprise to mark Thurs
day's 40th anniversary of the Bol

Technically, the Soviets might

New Satellite
i Their new satellite is described
as a rocket housing the dog and
instruments, with everything
weighing 1120 pounds.
The space used by the dog and
instruments perhaps could be re
placed with another, s m a 11 c r
rocket. It might be fired off.
from high altitude and speed, to
try to reach the necessary speed
of seven miles a second to escape
the earth's gravity and race to
the moon.
The Soviets could have special
moon-trip rockets under design,
or ready to go.
Or the moon talk could refer to
some pretty distant date.
