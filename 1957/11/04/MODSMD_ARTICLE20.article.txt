'-*<)\Fi"i lIINC has to he done right now.
\\ e cannot all'ord to lose any more Stanford
.•-Indents in automobile crashes. Saturdays
u reek that proved latal to Larry (look came
11*ss than two weeks 13 davs, to he exact
alter the accident which claimed the life of
LI ark King.
Sandwiched in between these two fatalities
was an accident on Oct. 29 resulting in in juries
to two Stanford men.
Ip until this vear we had heen doing very
well so far as accident ratio was concerned.
Not since September of 1953 was there a fatal
accident involving a Farm student although
there have during that time been some crashes
that came close to being fatal ones.
Our recent series of auto wrecks points out
one obvious fact —that highwav safety is not
'"old-fashioned," or "just for the other fellow."
In main cases the California Legislature has
provided us with rules which, if everyone fol
lowed, would prevent most of the smashups.
I?ut a law-making bodv can't do everything; in
the last analysis, it is we the ordinary licensed

drivers who must lake it upon ourselves to |
insure our safety.
To keep out of the hospital or Iho morgue
- one needs to do more than juat obey tin* law.
For one tiling, its a good idea to !<»ok out for
someone who is careless: don't demand your
right of way, for, as the old saving goes, you're |
just as dead when you're dead right as if voii
had heen dead wrong.
Another hit of advice is that of driving "safe-
In and prudently according to highway condi
tions." This means that, even though the posted
speed limit mav he 55, construction work, the |
weather, or other conditions might make it
assinine to drive over 25. And, of course, a
thorough saturation with alcohol is a sure wa\
to ilirt with death.
Lastly, stunting with motor vehicles, such as I
"drag" races, demonstrates an extreme low in |
mentality of the participants.
\\ hether we like it or not, we're going to
need to practice highwav safety. Ouronlv other i
alternative is to make advance reservations at j
the hospital or the undertakers.
