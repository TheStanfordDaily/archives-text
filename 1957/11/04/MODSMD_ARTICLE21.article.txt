# THIS WEEK ON QUAD-By The Raunchback of Pismo Beach
## 'Rocks in Their Heads' 
### 
This week starts off with a bang for those
with rocks in their heads. Those in such a con
dition may go to Room 320 at 4 p.m. today to
hear Vincent McElvey of the United States Geo
logical Society discuss "A Proposed Binomial
System for the Nomenclature of Sedimentary
Rocks."
As if that weren't enough, the Biology Depart
ment is offering a fantastic discussion 15 min
utes later by A. Hunter Depree on "The Contro
versy Between Louis Agassi/ and Asa Gray."
All Agassi/, and Gray fans report to Room 430,
Jordan Hall. If you hurry, you can get tea before
the talk.
It's bad enough having so many earthquakes
around here but the fellows over at the Division
of Engineering Mechanics have carried things a
bit farther. They're sponsoring a colloquium to
morrow titled "Nonlinear Vibration Research at
the Engineering Laboratory of Cambridge Uni
versity." Hm. As long as the topic's confined
to dear old England, I guess there's no harm.
Really, it's bad enough turning on the radio to
hear "Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin' On." and the
rest of that noisy rock 'n' roll garbage. Anyway,
vibrate on over to Room 541 at 3:15.
John Wisdom will be this week's guest at the
Tuesday Evening Series to speak on "Paradox
and Discovery." Mem Aud is the place, provid
ing the rubble from"The Wild Party" is cleaned
up in time..

Ah. the eolloquia are really blooming this
week. Wednesday's attraction is "Electromag
netic Structure of Nueleons" at the 4 p.m. Phys
ics Department Colloquium in the Physics Hall
(or the ol' tank as it's commonly referred to).
Meanwhile, the Department of Chemistry and

Chemical Engineering Seminar is scheduled to
strike again in c2O. "Linear Electron Accelera- j
tors and Their Application in Chemistry" will be
discussed. One or two molecules of home brew
will be split in a titanic demonstration.
The Wednesday Matinee lias a jolly little ex
cerpt from August Strindberg's play. "The Fa
ther." set up for Mem Aud's Little Theatre at
4:15. Free POPcorn? Yuk yuk!
And just to really confuse the issue more, the
Philosophy Department Colloquium will present i
John Wisdom, speaking on "A Feature of Witt- ;
genstein's Technique," also at 4:15.
All four of these cultural events will be held
at approximately the same time. How can one;
choose which to attend? I suggest combining 1
the whole thing into one big mess and titling it i
"Electromagnetic Structure of Wittgenstein's I
Father and His Application in Chemistry." So j
there!
Thursday the Stanford Mothers' Club meets
for a chrysanthemum tea at Flo Mo. Anyone
for soggy chrysanthemums?
# «
Saturday will find most of the campus charac
ters bombing the smog /one for that old tradi
tional with USC. Won't be any problem about
kicking those PAT's, either. Who can FIND the
damn goal posts???
Avast, ye slobs . . . or, swabs. The ocean will
gurgle and gush across the screen at the good !
old Sunday Night Flicks this week when Greg- j
ory Peck stars in "Moby Dick." I think it's about 1
a bathtub full of idiots who charge around trying '
to stab a whale or shoot down a Navy blimp or j
something. The lights go off and the shrieks I
begin at 7:30 in Mem And.

begin at 7:30 in Mem And.
This week starts off with a bang for those
with rocks in their heads. Those in such a con
dition may go to Room 320 at 4 p.m. today to
hear Vincent McElvey of the United States Geo
logical Society discuss "A Proposed Binomial
System for the Nomenclature of Sedimentary
Rocks."
As if that weren't enough, the Biology Depart
ment is offering a fantastic discussion 15 min
utes later by A. Hunter Depree on "The Contro
versy Between Louis Agassi/ and Asa Gray."
All Agassi/, and Gray fans report to Room 430,
Jordan Hall. If you hurry, you can get tea before
the talk.
It's bad enough having so many earthquakes
around here but the fellows over at the Division
of Engineering Mechanics have carried things a
bit farther. They're sponsoring a colloquium to
morrow titled "Nonlinear Vibration Research at
the Engineering Laboratory of Cambridge Uni
versity." Hm. As long as the topic's confined
to dear old England, I guess there's no harm.
Really, it's bad enough turning on the radio to
hear "Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin' On." and the
rest of that noisy rock 'n' roll garbage. Anyway,
vibrate on over to Room 541 at 3:15.
John Wisdom will be this week's guest at the
Tuesday Evening Series to speak on "Paradox
and Discovery." Mem Aud is the place, provid
ing the rubble from"The Wild Party" is cleaned
up in time..

Ah. the eolloquia are really blooming this
week. Wednesday's attraction is "Electromag
netic Structure of Nueleons" at the 4 p.m. Phys
ics Department Colloquium in the Physics Hall
(or the ol' tank as it's commonly referred to).
Meanwhile, the Department of Chemistry and

Chemical Engineering Seminar is scheduled to
strike again in c2O. "Linear Electron Accelera- j
tors and Their Application in Chemistry" will be
discussed. One or two molecules of home brew
will be split in a titanic demonstration.
The Wednesday Matinee lias a jolly little ex
cerpt from August Strindberg's play. "The Fa
ther." set up for Mem Aud's Little Theatre at
4:15. Free POPcorn? Yuk yuk!
And just to really confuse the issue more, the
Philosophy Department Colloquium will present i
John Wisdom, speaking on "A Feature of Witt- ;
genstein's Technique," also at 4:15.
All four of these cultural events will be held
at approximately the same time. How can one;
choose which to attend? I suggest combining 1
the whole thing into one big mess and titling it i
"Electromagnetic Structure of Wittgenstein's I
Father and His Application in Chemistry." So j
there!
Thursday the Stanford Mothers' Club meets
for a chrysanthemum tea at Flo Mo. Anyone
for soggy chrysanthemums?
# «
Saturday will find most of the campus charac
ters bombing the smog /one for that old tradi
tional with USC. Won't be any problem about
kicking those PAT's, either. Who can FIND the
damn goal posts???
Avast, ye slobs . . . or, swabs. The ocean will
gurgle and gush across the screen at the good !
old Sunday Night Flicks this week when Greg- j
ory Peck stars in "Moby Dick." I think it's about 1
a bathtub full of idiots who charge around trying '
to stab a whale or shoot down a Navy blimp or j
something. The lights go off and the shrieks I
begin at 7:30 in Mem And.
