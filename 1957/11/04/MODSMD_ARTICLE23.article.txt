# CONCERT SERIES OPENER
## Schwarzkopf Concert 'Best Here in Years' 
### Bob Christiansen 
The opening concert of this
year's Concert Series last Friday
was in many ways the finest vo
cal concert to be given here in
many years.
The program consisted mostly
of Lieder, and the artist, Elisa
beth Schwarzkopf, may easily be
considered the foremost expo
nent of the German art-song.
The opening group consisted of
Schubert songs, and it is here
that Madame Schwarzkopf espe
cially shines. She combined not
only charm and grace, but also a
rare insight into Schubert Lieder
in her singing.
Each song was handled as es
sentially a dramatic entity, and
each phrase was carefully molded
into the contour of the song. In
"An Sylvia" the rustic character
5 of the song was carefully shaded
; by a consideration of the Shake
sperean lyrics. Mme. Schwarz
kopf showed off the lightness in
her voice to good example in a
beautiful performance of "Die
I Voegel."
The dramatic side of Schubert

was excellently p or t r a ye d by
Mine. Schwarzkopf in "Gretchen
ain Spinnrade" and "Auf dem
Wasser /u singen."
The two Brahms songs were
very well done, but were easily
surpassed by Mme. Schwarz

kopf's performance of tho Hugo
Wolf songs. "Kennst du das
Land" was probably tho best of
those, but "Philine" was also ex
cellently sung.
The program concluded with j
two songs by Richard Strauss, i

both done with that consummate
style which Schwarzkopf tans
remember from "Der Rosenkava
lier."
Encores included "Deh viene
non tardar" from Mozart's "Le
Nozze fli Figaro," done with a i

complete understanding of the
style and magnificent vocal con
trol, "Se to m'aml" by Pergolesi,
and a delightful Swiss waltz.
"Schaetzli."
Mine. Schwarzkopf was accom
panied by George Reeves.
