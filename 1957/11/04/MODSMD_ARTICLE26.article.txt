# Rose Bowl? 'What's That?' Say Ducks; Only Al Would Have Tried Field Goal
## 
### John Anderson Steve Baffrey 
The Rose Bowl was NOT the subject of conver
sation in the Oregon dressing room after their
narrow 27-26 win over Stanford. The Ducks were
quiet, relieved and tired from coach Len Casa
nova all the way down to their papier-mache duck.

When Casanova was asked if
he was now thinking about the
Jan. 1 date his answer was a
short crisp "No!" The team was
n't talking much either, except
for an occasional remark about
Tom Keele dropping Jack Doug
las' pass on the nine-yard line
during the closing seconds of the
game.
"If he had made that one," Cas
remarked, "it would have saved
me 10 years."
Key Play
As for a key play, if may have
been the unplanned lateral from
Jack Crabtree to Charley Tour
villc inside the Indian 1()-yard
line. This set up the final and
winning Duck score.
"This is the most remarkable
team I have ever coached," stated
Len. "I don't see how they do
what they do." This was directed
in particular to Oregon's defense
when it was first-and-goal-to-go
for Stanford on the Webfoots'
nine.
"1 just wish, though, that they
would think of a less hectic way
to do it," added the Oregon men
tor who started his coaching at
near-by Sequoia High School in
Redwood City.
Don't Blame Stanford
Guard Harry Mondale received
credit as being outstanding on de
fense for the winners and the
coach described Jim Shanley as
being one of the best backs in the
business. When asked if it was
poor Stanford tackling which al
lowed Oregon drives to continue
he remarked, "Don't blame Stan-,
ford. Shanley is just a hard man i
to bring down."
The relieved air about the |
dressing room clearly showed j
that this was one of Oregon's
toughest games. Casanova defi
nitely thought so, but added that j
he thought there would be more ;
defense. On the other hand Stan
ford was the best offensive team !
that the Webfoots have met thus
far.
Douglas Good Passer
Douglas' j) a s sing hurt the
Ducks. "He's a good thrower but
not as hard to defense against as !
Brodie," remarked Cas.
As far as comparing the In- j
dians against California, which
was downed by Oregon 24-(■> last
week. Casanova preferred not to i
say anything. "I don't like to
compare teams and I couldn't
compare Stanford and Cal."
He did know one thing for cer i
tain and that was that the emer- (
aid and yellow had won. for the
third time, a ball game by less I
than one touchdown. They had I
beaten WSC 14-13 and Idaho 9-G. j
Their only loss was to Pitts- i
burgh. 6-3.
Was this the most pleasant?
Cas: "They're all pleasant."
Lay Off the ltoses
There were no serious losses in !
the game except center Dave i
Fish who may have a broken
hand. Someone asked if he would
he ready by Jan. 1. and the coach
snapped, "Would you lay off that
stuff?"
He was just as curt when I
asked to comment on the power
in the Big Ten and if lie had been i
doing any scouting in that direc
tion.

'Therc're a lot of people who participate in that
pasttimc," Stanford coach Chuck Taylor noted
when confronted with a question about second
guessers, "but when you find yourself in a situa
tion you have to do what seems best at ihe time.

•'We thought of a field goal, of
course we did. but we had
chances for something better.
Harrington would have been the
only one who would have kicked
it, but he wasn't eligible to return
to the game. Then. too. he had ;
missed two kicks already. Jack
Taylor wasn't ready."
Feeling "as satisfied as a coach
can be after a game like this," ;
Taylor offered nothing but praise '
for Oregon's Ducks who had just j
stolen some very pretty dreams j
from his tribe of Indians. "But 1 :
think our kids did a great job of j
coming back.
Great for Cas
"It was a great victory for Cas
[Webfoot coach Len Casanova |;
they deserved it. Oregon played
as perfect a game as. a team
could." Speculating on how the
56,000 spectators felt about the
game, the Indian mentor said. "It
was a great game to watch from
the stands."
It seemed impossible that the
interview would go by without
someone mentioning the New
Year's classic in Pasadena. Asked
about how the Ducks would fare,
he answered, "They'll make a
good Rose Bowl representative."
Then, when his opinion was op
posed by some of the press con
tingent, he went on to say,
"They'll do all right, they'll score
a few touchdowns."
Good Runners
Oregon's entire squad contin
ued to draw praise from Taylor,
but he singled out quarterback
Jack Crabtree for special honors.
Feeling that he called an awfully
good game. Taylor was quick to
add "and those backs were aw
fully good runners."
Indians Chuck Shea and A 1
Harrington drew praise from
their coach. Linemen Gary van
Galder and John Thomas were
standouts in their respective posi
tions. Thomas, with the excep
tion of a breather by Pete Swan
son. played almost GO minutes.
There were more touchy sub
jects bridged in the course of the
post - game interview. "I don't
know what was wrong." Taylor
mused when confronted with a
query about the elusive PAT.
"The center and the holding were
OK. We'll have to see."
No Inst ructions
Did the coach call the plays at
the end of the game? Douglas
had no instruction of any sort.
Was the boss pleased with Doug
las' performance throughout the
game? Yes, it was OK.
Stanford depended on its ends
to protect against the Ducks' luck
with running at those positions.
And what about Oregon calling
plays without going into a hud
dle, and their "checking" proc
ess? "We shifted to try to throw
off their checking . . . that hud
dle business might have upset
us."
"I'd say it was the best running
we've faced this year; they were
about equal to Rice as far as be
ing the best team (overall) we've
played against."
Well, coach, how does this
leave you for SC? Will the team
be down for the game? "Not
these kids—not down for SG—
| our kids will play football."
