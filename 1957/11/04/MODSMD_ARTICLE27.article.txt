# Wallace Sets Course Mark; Harriers Win
## 
### 
Keith Wallace broke the Stan
ford cross-country course record
and four other Indians came
within 10 seconds of the old mark
as they raced to a brilliant 18-39
victory over San Jose State Fri
day.
Wallace, a freshman who has
yet to turn IS, ran the four miles
in 21:2G to better the former
standard of 21:31, set by Califor
nia's Bob House last year.
Wallace was actually second in
the race as Walt Boehm of the
Olympic Club, running unat
tached, crossed the finish line in
21:13. But Boehm's time is unof
ficial, since he accidentally cut
off a segment of the course on
the home stretch and so didn't
run the full distance.
Wallace was at the front of the
pack much of the way before
Boehm, a veteran runner with
years of competitive experience,
moved up to challenge. Wallace
still stuck with him most of the
way. falling just slightly behind
over the final quarter-mile.
Maury Graves ran the best har
rier race of his career to place
second for Stanford in 21:32. The
first San Jose man to finish was
sophomore Grady Neal, who was
five seconds back of Graves.
Stanford placed the next three
men. Norman Lloyd (21:39), Bob
Mon/.ingo (21:40 > and Doug Mar
tin (21:41). Ernie Cunliffe and
Bob McGuire were the sixth and
seventh Indians, at 22:21 and
22:24.
Payton Jordan's squad did not
make the mistake it had made
last week in a quadrangular.
