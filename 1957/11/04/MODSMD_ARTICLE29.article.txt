HOW TO STUDY
The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes have bought this
space so I ran bring a message of importance to American
undergraduates each week. There is no more important,
me—ago I ean bring yon than ibis: ('ollege ran be beauti
ful. Don't louse it up with studying.
Thai was my mistake. At first, eowed by college,
I studied so much that I turned into a dreary, blinking
creature, subject to dry mouth and night sweats. This
dismal, condition prevailed until 1 learned the real mean
ing of college. And what is that? I'll tell you what: to
prepare you to face ihe realities of the world. And what,
do you need to face the realities of the world? 1 II tell you
what: poise. And how do you get poise? 1 II tell you how:
not by sticking your nose in a book, you may be sure!
Relax! Live! Enjoy! . . . That's how you get pofte.
Of course you have to study, but, be poised about it.
Don't be like some drones who spend every single night
buried in ;i book. They are not learning poise; what's
more, they are playing hob with their posture.
The truly poised student knows better than to inalte
the whole semester hideous with studying, lie knows
the night before an exam is plenty of time to study.
Yes, I've heard people condemn cramming. Hut who
are these people? They are the electric light, and.
interests, that's who! They want you to sit. up late and
study every night so you will use more electricity and
enrich their bulging coffers.
Don't be taken in by their insidious propaganda!
Cramming is clearly the only sensible way to study. But
beware! Even cramming can be overdone. When you
cram, be sure you are good and relaxed. Before you start,
eai a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat.
another hearty dinner. Then go park some place and lifcb.fc
up a Marlboro. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it affords.
Don't go home till you're properly relaxed.

Once at home, stay relaxed. Do not, however, fall
asleep. This is ton relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose
a chair that is not too comfortable. For example, take
a chair with nails pointing up through ihe seats
Place several packs of Marlboros within easy reach,
flood, mild tobacco helps you relax, and that's what.
Marlboro is—good, mild tobacco. Bui Marlboro is more
than just good, mild tobacco; it is also cigarette paper
to keep the good, mild tobacco from spilling all over the
place. And a filter. And a flip-top box. Ami a red tape,
to lift the cigarettes easily ... It is, in short, a lot, to like.
Now you've got the uncomfortable chair and the
Marlboros. Now you need light. l T se the lit end of your
Marlboro. Do not enrich the light and power interests.
Head your textbook in a slow, relaxed manner. Do
not underline; it reduces the resale value of the book.
Always keep your books in prime resale condition. You
never know when you'll need getaway money.
As you read you will no doubt come across many
things you don't understand. But. don't panic. Uelax.
