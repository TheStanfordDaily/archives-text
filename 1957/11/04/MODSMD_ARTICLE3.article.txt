For I ho fifth lime in two years,
Stanford rooters wont home mum
bling lo lhomselv.es after another
one of those extra-pointless In
dian spectaculars that makes you
age I•) years every play.
As before, the Indians played
true to the script and lost by one
point to the Oregon Ducks, 27-2(5,
before the largest Stanford Sta
dium crowd this season. More
than 56,000 chilled-cheek fans saw
the two teams play a near-perfect
seesaw game which ended with
Oregon virtually cinching the
Rose Bowl bid.
The game was without one fum
ble or intercepted pass. And only
15 yards of penalties were marked
off against each team. Although
the game was "nowhere" defen
sively, the explosive offense of
each team kept the crowd bobbing
up and down all afternoon.
