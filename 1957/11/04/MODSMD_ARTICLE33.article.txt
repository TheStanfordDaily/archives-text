*'111 a company that develops new ideas by
tlie thousands, 11 says 30-year-old William K.
Cordier, manager of General Electrics Man-
Made Diamond pilot plant, "a young man's
career progress need not lie limited by his
particular field. In my five years with Gen
eral Electric, I vc gained valuable experience
in several different fields, and each assign
ment has helped me to move ahead. Might
now, I have an exciting job. I run the world's
first diamond-making plant — a business no
body dreamed of three years ago."
Diamond Making a Reality
I he job Bill Cordier holds is an important
one, created because General Electric has
the scientific and technical resources needed
to seek out new knowledge and swiftly trans
late it into products that people want and
need. In 1955, the company announced a
major scientific breakthrough — the produc
tion of real diamonds in the laboratory. To
day, little more than two years later. General
Electric is making and selling quantities of
these diamonds for civilian and defense use.
Achieving Three-Way Progress
General Electric's ability to take on and
solve big problems — in research and devel
opment as well as every phase of production
— is constantly creating challenging new op
portunities for the 29,000 college graduates
at the company. As we see it, by providing a
healthy climate for a young man's self-devel
opment in whatever area he may choose,
we encourage not only his own progress, but
that of the company and I he nation as well.
