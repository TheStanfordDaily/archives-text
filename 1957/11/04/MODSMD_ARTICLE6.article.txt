# IS IT LAST YEAR ALL OVER AGAIN?
## Oregon Boots SU Indians, 27-26 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
Similarities between Iho 1956
and 1957 Stanford football seasons
I are becoming painfully evident as
j the year rolls on.
In '56 the Cards entered the sev-
I enth game with a 4-2 record and
I bright hopes for a rousing finish.
They lost by one point. In '57 the
Cards entered the seventh game
with a 4-2 record and bright hopes
for a rousing finish. They again
lost by one point.
Oregon did the damage this
time, and it was by a 27-26 count
on the thrill-scarred turf of Stan-
I ford Stadium Saturday.
Stanford fought back from a
touchdown deficit on three occa
sions; iho Indians riddled the
PCC's best defense (until Satur
day) for 468 yards and 26 first
j downs.
Bill Ihe good side of the Stan
j ford story missed by one poinl of
: equaling the bad side a pair of
I missed extra points, a pass de
fense thai lot Iho Ducks complete
10 of 11, and potential scoring
I drives thai died on the Oregon
I It), the US and Iho 9.
No Traffic. Worries
Needless lo say, Stanford poo
pie won't have to worry about
bucking Pasadena's Now Year's
Day traffic. Oregon, b.y winning,
ran its loop record lo 5-0 and
moved Iwo games ahead of its
closes I pursuers. Only by losing
to Washington, I JSC and Oregon
State can the Ducks miss making
Iho Rose Bowl I rip.
In '56 the Tribe opened Iho year
with an easy win over Washing
lon Stale; lhal decks with this
year's opener against San Jose.
Then they went on through the

next four games playing good
football most of the way and hit
the midway point of the season
at 3-2. Same pattern this fall.
Last season's battle with the
Trojans and this year's Bruin tilt

also match. Stanford entered each
game as an underdog against a
team from Los Angeles armed
with special anti-Stanford feel
ings. Each time the Cards won a
j weli-deserved victory, and each

time optimism sailed high as a
kite.
Then came the two seventh
games and the two conversion
losses. Now. if the pattern con
tinues, Stanford will drop a one
pointer to USC, gel routed by
OSC and come out on the short
end against Cal.
Of course, the Indians see no
reason why the pattern should
continue. Comments coach Chuck
Taylor on the Troy game: "I
think our kids'll play football.''
I Will you be down for USC? "Not
! these kids."
There's one thing in Stanford's
favor no serious injuries were
; sustained against Oregon.
Muss Sleele, after being named
as a starter last Thursday, didn't
play at all because of his bad
| knee; but he'll be ready by the
I <Mid of this week. John Kidd had
I shoulder-point trouble and didn't
play much, but ho, too. should be
set. for USC. A third lineman,
center John Thomas, played al
most 60 minutes despite a hyper
extension of an arm, and is ex-
I peeled lo play again Saturday.
Ducks Near--I'erlcct
i An index <>l how good a game
Stanford did play may be seen in
the fact that Oregon played an
almost-perfect game of football,
I yet won by just Hie one point. The
Ducks didn't fumble once, they
didn't lose the ball on an intorcep
; lion and they had just 15 yards in
penalties all day. Hut, then, Stan

made the stop after the former Menlo star made six yards around
