# IS IT LAST YEAR ALL OVER AGAIN?
## Oregon Boots SU Indians, 27-26 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
Similarities between Iho 1956
and 1957 Stanford football seasons
I are becoming painfully evident as
j the year rolls on.
In '56 the Cards entered the sev-
I enth game with a 4-2 record and
I bright hopes for a rousing finish.
They lost by one point. In '57 the
Cards entered the seventh game
with a 4-2 record and bright hopes
for a rousing finish. They again
lost by one point.
Oregon did the damage this
time, and it was by a 27-26 count
on the thrill-scarred turf of Stan-
I ford Stadium Saturday.
Stanford fought back from a
touchdown deficit on three occa
sions; iho Indians riddled the
PCC's best defense (until Satur
day) for 468 yards and 26 first
j downs.
Bill Ihe good side of the Stan
j ford story missed by one poinl of
: equaling the bad side a pair of
I missed extra points, a pass de
fense thai lot Iho Ducks complete
10 of 11, and potential scoring
I drives thai died on the Oregon
I It), the US and Iho 9.
No Traffic. Worries
Needless lo say, Stanford poo
pie won't have to worry about
bucking Pasadena's Now Year's
Day traffic. Oregon, b.y winning,
ran its loop record lo 5-0 and
moved Iwo games ahead of its
closes I pursuers. Only by losing
to Washington, I JSC and Oregon
State can the Ducks miss making
Iho Rose Bowl I rip.
In '56 the Tribe opened Iho year
with an easy win over Washing
lon Stale; lhal decks with this
year's opener against San Jose.
Then they went on through the

next four games playing good
football most of the way and hit
the midway point of the season
at 3-2. Same pattern this fall.
Last season's battle with the
Trojans and this year's Bruin tilt

also match. Stanford entered each
game as an underdog against a
team from Los Angeles armed
with special anti-Stanford feel
ings. Each time the Cards won a
j weli-deserved victory, and each

time optimism sailed high as a
kite.
Then came the two seventh
games and the two conversion
losses. Now. if the pattern con
tinues, Stanford will drop a one
pointer to USC, gel routed by
OSC and come out on the short
end against Cal.
Of course, the Indians see no
reason why the pattern should
continue. Comments coach Chuck
Taylor on the Troy game: "I
think our kids'll play football.''
I Will you be down for USC? "Not
! these kids."
There's one thing in Stanford's
favor no serious injuries were
; sustained against Oregon.
Muss Sleele, after being named
as a starter last Thursday, didn't
play at all because of his bad
| knee; but he'll be ready by the
I <Mid of this week. John Kidd had
I shoulder-point trouble and didn't
play much, but ho, too. should be
set. for USC. A third lineman,
center John Thomas, played al
most 60 minutes despite a hyper
extension of an arm, and is ex-
I peeled lo play again Saturday.
Ducks Near--I'erlcct
i An index <>l how good a game
Stanford did play may be seen in
the fact that Oregon played an
almost-perfect game of football,
I yet won by just Hie one point. The
Ducks didn't fumble once, they
didn't lose the ball on an intorcep
; lion and they had just 15 yards in
penalties all day. Hut, then, Stan

ford's figures in these three de
partments were identical to the
Ducks'.
The Indian offensive was the i
best of the season. II gained 217
yards rushing. 251 passing. A 1
Harrington a 1 on e ran for 106
yards, and Chuck Shea added 92
more. Jackie Douglas completed
1 1 of 25 passes for 210 yards. But
there were the three times when
Stanford bogged down within a
short distance of the goal line.
The closest of these unproduc
tive threats came in the waning j
moments of the game. Stanford
had closed the gap to 26-27. miss
ed the conversion, held the Ducks
and gotten the ball again, with
3:21 to play.
Reverse —Almost
Beginning on their own 20, the
Cards got just 4 yards in two '
plays. Then it was lime for the:
usually effective double reverse.
Only this time Jackie Taylor
didn't keep running. He stopped,
rared back and threw a long pass
to Dick Stein. Stein went up with
two Ducks, came down with the
ball and almost twisted away be
fore he was downed on the Ore
gon 35 a 41-yard gain.
Douglas completed two of his j
next three passes for a total of 26
yards, and the Indians were on
the Oregon 9 with 1:11 to play.
Then ihe roof caved in on the
Indian passing game. Douglas I
twice threw incomplete, and one
of these was almost intercepted.
On third down, still 9 to go. he
went back to pass, then had to run
and was hit for no gain.
What to Do
There was momentary confu- j
siort before the Cards ran their |
fourth-down play. Did they want
to try a field goal? Or did they '
want to go for 6?
Taylor said afier the game that
if Harrington had been able to get
back in the game the Indians
would have tried for the three
pointer. But Harrington, two-for
four in the P.A.T. department,
was dead substitution - wise, and j
so no field goal was attempted.
Douglas tried to pass again

the eighth straight pass play in j
the series and he was finally
dropped on the 15-yard line as the |
clock reached the 21-second mark, i
And that was the game, as Oregon j
didn't even bother to run off a
play.
When the Stanford offense did i
not bog down it was beautiful to !
behold. Midway through the first j
period Oregon had relentlessly!
driven 70 yards in 13 plays to take |
a 7-0 lead. Stanford look the kick-1
off, racked up a first down and |
then looked in bad shape at third-!
and-16 on its own 27.
Perfect Throw
Douglas didn't let the long yard-1
age bother him. He sent Jeri Mc-!
Millin long down the right side.!
gave him time to outdistance
three Oregon defenders, and laid !
the ball in his arms with a throw
that carried more than 50 yards.;
McMillin cut to his left to out
fake his pursuers and went into
the end zone standing up for the
6-pointer. And 6 is all it .was, as
the conversion attempt into a
near-gale went low and wide to !
the left.
Stanford hold the lead in the
game for an elapsed time of 3
minutes 32 seconds. The Cards j
grabbed the edge near the end of t
the second quarter on an 82-yard, j
17-play drive punctuated by seven ;
completed passes and 23 yards' :
worth of carries by Harrington.
Who Was It For?
The payoff came on a fourth
down-and-6 pass, Douglas to Shea.
On the play. Joel Freis had wig
gled loose deep in the end zone,
and it looked as though the pass
were intended for him. But Shea,
a yard or two past the goal line,
cut in front of an Oregon man i
and went high to pull down the j
aerial for the score.
The Ducks wasted no time get
ting the lead back. They went
from their 34 to a touchdown in
10 plays as Jack Crabtree sneaked
over with 5 seconds left in Ihe
halt. An off-side penalty probably
cost Stanford ihe 7 points.
Armand DeWeese's kiekoff had
been returned only to ihe 15. But
the 5-yard infraction forced Stan
ford to kick over again, and this

time if was returned 10 the 34.
from where Oregon made it to
pay-dirt barely in time.
An opening drive in the second
half widened the Webfoot margin
to 21-13. Again Crabtree snuek
over for the points—this time on
Epurth-and-1.
More Fighting Rack
Stanford fought back again,
Harrington scoring from the 3
I just one play before the end of
i the third period. But a 24-yard
| pass play, Charley Tourville to
; Jim Shanley, started Oregon on a
1 quick scoring drive that was cli
! maxed by Jack Morris' 1-yard cen
! t.er plunge. It was after this score
that Morris had his only conver
sion miss.
Douglas led the Cards back
; again. Fourteen plays later Gary
Van Galder was in the end zone
with a 2-yard pass from ihe In-J
| dian quarterback, and there was!
1 1he chance to tie. But again the
' P.A.T. attempt was low and to the
left.
And so Stanford had its fifth j
conversion loss in two years, j
though still to come was the final 1
rally, which fell 9 yards short.
