1 wo (,r.\i.itA'i ions of Stanford students, alumni,
administration and staff personnel are today
mourning over the passing away ol" possibly the
most colorful figure in Stanford's history.
( Certain I v.the death of Sam McDonald yester
d«i\ morning is a tragic blow to the hundreds
of students who had known him personally. His
cheerful friendliness, even after the lingering
illness followed b\ the amputation of both his
legs two vears ago, was well known on eampus.
Mam a student would not have graduated with
out his help.
I'erhaps even more tragic is the passing away
ol the tradition that was Sam McDonald. For
this was truly Sain McDonald's Farm. With
more validity than anyone else, he could claim
Stanford to he his private domain. Few, il any,
can claim 51 vears of service lo this University.
Had Sam McDonald been University presi
denl, or chairman of the Hoard ol Trustees, he
could not have been any more loved or appre
ciated. His devotion to his work in care of the

athletic grounds, and lo those athletes who used
I hem. is so well known il need not be recounted.
Hut perhaps his pet pro ject, and the one with
which most of us connect him, was the Stanford
Convalescent Home. Sam McDonald devoted
much of his time and energy in these last years
to the aid of Con Home. Mam of us remember
him as head chef at the Con Home barbecues.
Sam McDonald has passed away —but he is
not forgotten. One of the campus roads has
already been named in his honor. But we
should like to propose that this year's "*Hig
Game" he dedicated to his memory.
We should like to see "In Memory of Sam
McDonald ' as the theme of that game. And
when our team meets Cal on the field in Stan
ford Stadium, when they are carrying or fight
ing for that football, we should like them to lie
doing it for Sam McDonald.
This was his University; this was his Farm.
Let us hold his memory high.
