Scanning the campus scenes throughout the
nation:
Drinking has been reinstated at fraternity
rush parties at Johns Hopkins University, do
spite iho objection of the Interfraternity Council
president. In making the decision, officers com
mented, "The administration might not look
upon this action as good. Something drastic may
happen." The Delta Phi president defended the

ttie gym [referring to the Fall Cotillion] but not
in the houses," according to the Johns Hopkins

A mystery photographer attended a recent
meeting at the University of California which
featured a Socialist, taking pictures with his
camera in a briefcase. The Daily Californian said
he refused to grant an interview, and is guessing
Ihat he may have been from the Burns Commit
tee, a California state investigating committee
for subversion. "Can't we even listen to a speech
any more without being watched?" one student
asked.

La Salle College in Philadelphia is a unique
place, says the La Salle Collegian reporter Tom

Adams. "You can walk from the cafeteria to the
library in minus-five minutes. Or you might
pick up a few minutes since the library to college
hall takes anywhere from minus four minutes
to 15 minutes, depending upon which room you
enter. The reason for these singular happenings
is that almost every clock on campus has a dif
ferent time. Why is it . . . huh?"
a
The new publication, Young Socialist, is pro
testing attacks by the UCLA Daily Bruin. The
furor over socialism and the Young Socialist at
UCLA was touched off by a front-page article
in the Oct. 7 Daily Bruin with accompanying
editorials. The Young Socialist was assailed for
attempting the alleged "dissemination of Social
ist propaganda under the mask of the most
democratic of practices, that of 'free and open
discussion'." In a letter to the editor of the Daily
Bruin, Tim Wohll'orth. managing editor of the
Young Socialist, said, "All attempts to smother
this discussion |of Socialism| in the universities
can only serve to stultify the student body, iso
lating them from the real questions of the day."
The new publication is an independent monthly,
published in New York by younng socialists of
various tendencies.
