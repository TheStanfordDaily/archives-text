# STUDENTS MAINTAIN VIGIL
## Stanford Prof Estimates Long Life for Satellite 
### 
The second Russian earth-satellite may prove to be '"a long-lived
affair," Dr. Ronald Bracevvell, associate professor of electrical engi
neering, told The Daily yesterday.
Bracewell, who is also a noted astronomer, said Sputnik II "will J
probably stay up there longer" than its predecessor, "since it's a j

more massive object and it will
; take more to bring it down."
A team of Stanford students is
maintaining a vigil in a shack on
1 campus to pick up signals from
; the dog-carrying satellite. They
heard its combination beep and
| whistle yesterday afternoon, Dr.
j Bracewell said.
Dog May Live
Commenting on the Russians'
j supposed plan to parachute Sput
i nik ll's occupant to earth, Brace-
J well said ii was "entirely possi
i blc" that the dog could be recov
ered alive.
He said he believes the satellite
was deliberately sent into a dras
! tically elliptical orbit so the dog's
| space-capsule could be parachuted
at a time when the missile would
; be 160 miles from the earth's sur
' face. At the height of the ellipse
j Sputnik II is 1000 miles above
: the earth.
Hissing Sound
Bracewell explained the hissing
! sound which accompanies the now
j familiar beep of Sputnik I as
I probably the satellite's instru
ments "recording the breathing.
I heart beat and blood pressure of
! the dog."
One ham radio operator has re
ported hearing the dog bark into
Sputnik ll's microphone.
Bracewell believes that the sat
ellite's elliptical orbit brings it
closest to earth as it passes over!
western United States and Russia.
20 R.P.M.
From its fading signals, he cal-1
eulates that the new satellite is
spinninng at 20 revolutions per j
minute.
This does not mean that "Ku- J
dryavka," the female Husky that
occupies the missile, is spinning j
with it. It is much more likely j
i that the dog's capsule is independ
| ent of the satellite surface, like >
| the stationary part of a gyroscope.'
Bracewell thinks recovery of
the animal could be accomplished
! by having a rocket in the satellite j
j that would eject the dog's capsule
: as Sputnik II swept to its closest
! orbital point to earth.
Capsule Stationary?
The rocket would be of suffi- j
, cient force to hold the capsule j
stationary in space while the sat
j ellite continued in its orbit, Brace- j
i well explained. The capsule would I
| then start dropping. When it;
I reached an altitude 50.000 feet j
jab o v c the earth, a parachute,
; would be opened automatically j
! and the entire unit would drift to |
I earth.
The newest Russian success in |
the conquest of space led Dr. -
Nicholas U. Maya 11, astronomer
at Lick Observatory, to declare
that it is now possible for the j
; Reds to send up a rocket carrying
a human being.
Man Similar
The problems involved in j
launching a man into space would
i be similar to those of the dog. |
I with the comparatively simple ex-!
ception that the man would re- i
'quire more oxygen, food and 1
| space, he said.
He added that the Russians j
I have a good chance of hitting the
! moon within the next two months, j
'Rumor has it that they may try
|to send a rocket to the earth's
I original satellite this Thursday
] 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution.

neering, told The Daily yesterday.
Bracewell, who is also a noted astronomer, said Sputnik II "will J
probably stay up there longer" than its predecessor, "since it's a j

more massive object and it will
; take more to bring it down."
A team of Stanford students is

Dog May Live
Commenting on the Russians'
j supposed plan to parachute Sput
i nik ll's occupant to earth, Brace-
J well said ii was "entirely possi
i blc" that the dog could be recov
ered alive.
He said he believes the satellite
was deliberately sent into a dras
! tically elliptical orbit so the dog's
| space-capsule could be parachuted
at a time when the missile would
; be 160 miles from the earth's sur
' face. At the height of the ellipse
j Sputnik II is 1000 miles above
: the earth.
Hissing Sound
Bracewell explained the hissing
! sound which accompanies the now
j familiar beep of Sputnik I as
I probably the satellite's instru
ments "recording the breathing.
I heart beat and blood pressure of
! the dog."
One ham radio operator has re
ported hearing the dog bark into
Sputnik ll's microphone.
Bracewell believes that the sat
ellite's elliptical orbit brings it
closest to earth as it passes over!
western United States and Russia.
20 R.P.M.
From its fading signals, he cal-1
eulates that the new satellite is
spinninng at 20 revolutions per j
minute.
This does not mean that "Ku- J
dryavka," the female Husky that
occupies the missile, is spinning j
with it. It is much more likely j
i that the dog's capsule is independ
| ent of the satellite surface, like >
| the stationary part of a gyroscope.'
Bracewell thinks recovery of
the animal could be accomplished
! by having a rocket in the satellite j
j that would eject the dog's capsule
: as Sputnik II swept to its closest
! orbital point to earth.
Capsule Stationary?
The rocket would be of suffi- j
, cient force to hold the capsule j
stationary in space while the sat
j ellite continued in its orbit, Brace- j
i well explained. The capsule would I
