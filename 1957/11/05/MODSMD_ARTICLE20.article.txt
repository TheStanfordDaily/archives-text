Shades of Brainier
Editor, The Daily:
Upon my blessed return to Stanford, after a
long summer, 1 immediately noticed an appalling
fact. Glancing out of my window at night, there
seems to be no vestige of the once flowering spirit
in Branner Hall. What was considered such a
vital part of the greater whole, College Experi
ence, is gone—perhaps, though I certainly hope
not, forever. Every single, solitary shade in Bran
ner Hall is pulled down each and every night.
This display of modesty, Victorianism and, in
deed. conceit is not only against the grain of a
truly well-rounded education but also counter to,
and a flagrant violation of, the Stanford Tradi
tion -which, as even the most uninitiated fresh
man will agree, is one of the most fundamental
facets and, indeed, the whole solid foundation of
a truly happy, wholesome and profitable College
Experience here at Stanford.
There are several reasons (which I shall pre
sent in numbered statements for the close scru
tiny of my fellow students) for one to become
slightly upset about this problem.
1. First (but not foremost) is the fact that too
much emphasis is being placed upon national and
international problems such as integrating the
Deep South (which is, in reality, not worth all the
trouble) and very little attention is being focused
these days on the deep-seated problems and trials
facing us here on this very campus!
2. Perhaps the girls (I here hesitate to use such
a word in describing the Young Females which
hold dear to their hearts the chambers of Dear
Old Branner) do not realize that Ihey are com
mitting a rending breach of tradition as old as
('ollege Life itself.
3. Thirdly, and here I refer the reader to the
opening paragraphs above, these ignoble and
savage practices are counter to the spirit of true
progressive education as it is said to prevail here
at Stanford. By the simple removal of the Bran
ner Shades, a striking saving of dollars could be
realized. This money could be put to some useful
purpose such as completing the new Medical Cen
ter or the permanent conversion of Encina Hall
into an infirmary for housing the victims of the
latest debilitating fads, better known as epi
demics.
4. The persistent and careful reader will notice
(or perhaps the memory will have faded into a
misty past by this timet that I have used the
rather acute and acrid term "conceit" in connec
tion with, and the description of, the Branner
Women. I cannot help but wonder if this "con
ceit" is not the real basis for the whole deplorable
situation.
Last year the women were no raving beauties
either, but at least they had the wisdom and the
reality-testing apparatus to realize this fact, and
reasoned that, no matter how much their rooms
resembled glassed-in fish bowls, it simply was not.
worth a guy's time and energy to look up. They
learned from hard, old Mother Experience (whom
we all recognize as the Supreme Teacher) that
1 he men simply would not bother to look up and
watch the action in the windows. Not that it
would have made any difference if they had.
To some, the above statements may seem con

tradictory, but I am confident that, upon closer
examination and upon the application of real
"critical thinking" as defined and practiced by
such philosophical giants as Plato and Aristotle,
the seeming inconsistency will vanish like the
misty forms of unclad female bodies cavorting
in my overburdened and unrefreshed memory
processes. Hopefully yours,

Editor, The Daily:
I have just made a startling discovery concern
ing the distaff section of the big. sprawling,
happy Stanford Family. The girls in this Univer
sity are, theoretically, chosen on the basis of in
telligence and personal initiative.
It seems odd that the female members of the
aforesaid big, sprawling, happy Stanford Family
are compelled to attend free, democratic, untram
meled meetings once a week. In these junior
league soviets the girls get to approve what is
best for them. What is best for them has been
benevolently determined in advance by their
R.A.'s. This is definitely THE BEST WAY, as we
all know that discussions are of no value, espe
cially if they lead to any result.
But, at any rate, the girls are welcome to par
ticipate in these discussions. In fact, if they do
not avail themselves of this privilege, they are
allowed to contribute to the funds of their living
groups, and if they waive their privilege enough
times, they are encouraged to participate in a
more exclusive democratic group known as the
Women's Council.
To make sure that all abide by the freely-de
cided rules and regulations, a special group
comparable to the MOB in my country—go about
to ascertain popular opinion in the living groups.
They report this opinion to their superiors and
with admirable thoroughness include the names
ol those who hold the various opinions. This
process is carried out so painlessly that many
girls are not even aware that their opinions are
being polled.
To insure that the girls get to know one an
other, they are encouraged to eat in the living
group dining areas almost exclusively.
And, most important of all, a proper mental
state is encouraged in the young ladies. If one of
them gets the Philistine idea of thinking WRONG
THOUGHTS an admirable organization aids them
in their return to the proper ideology.
Girls do not know what is best for them and
are therefore not allowed, for their own good, to
live off campus. Many girls oVer 21 seem to think
this unfair, but they do not really know their own
minds.
Ali hail, all power, to the handful of girls who
keep this remarkable system going! 1 am sure
they will go on to bigger and better things ( DAR,
improvement clubs, WCTU, Watch and Ward,
etc.l. Keep up the good work! In the new world
such minds as yours will be highly valued.
I hope none of these budding young leaders will
think I am in any way mocking them. Only a
depraved, anti-social WRONG THINKER would
get such a meaning. We who are pure of heart,
as you well know, are'simple people and are often
misunderstood.

I have just made a startling discovery concern
ing the distaff section of the big. sprawling,
happy Stanford Family. The girls in this Univer
sity are, theoretically, chosen on the basis of in
telligence and personal initiative.
It seems odd that the female members of the
aforesaid big, sprawling, happy Stanford Family
are compelled to attend free, democratic, untram
meled meetings once a week. In these junior
league soviets the girls get to approve what is
best for them. What is best for them has been
benevolently determined in advance by their
R.A.'s. This is definitely THE BEST WAY, as we
all know that discussions are of no value, espe
cially if they lead to any result.
But, at any rate, the girls are welcome to par
ticipate in these discussions. In fact, if they do
not avail themselves of this privilege, they are
allowed to contribute to the funds of their living
groups, and if they waive their privilege enough
times, they are encouraged to participate in a
more exclusive democratic group known as the
Women's Council.
To make sure that all abide by the freely-de
cided rules and regulations, a special group
comparable to the MOB in my country—go about
to ascertain popular opinion in the living groups.
They report this opinion to their superiors and
with admirable thoroughness include the names
ol those who hold the various opinions. This
process is carried out so painlessly that many
girls are not even aware that their opinions are
being polled.
To insure that the girls get to know one an
other, they are encouraged to eat in the living
group dining areas almost exclusively.
And, most important of all, a proper mental
state is encouraged in the young ladies. If one of
them gets the Philistine idea of thinking WRONG
THOUGHTS an admirable organization aids them
in their return to the proper ideology.
Girls do not know what is best for them and
are therefore not allowed, for their own good, to
live off campus. Many girls oVer 21 seem to think
this unfair, but they do not really know their own
minds.
Ali hail, all power, to the handful of girls who
keep this remarkable system going! 1 am sure
they will go on to bigger and better things ( DAR,
improvement clubs, WCTU, Watch and Ward,
etc.l. Keep up the good work! In the new world
such minds as yours will be highly valued.
I hope none of these budding young leaders will
think I am in any way mocking them. Only a
depraved, anti-social WRONG THINKER would
get such a meaning. We who are pure of heart,
as you well know, are'simple people and are often

Upon my blessed return to Stanford, after a
long summer, 1 immediately noticed an appalling
fact. Glancing out of my window at night, there
seems to be no vestige of the once flowering spirit
in Branner Hall. What was considered such a
vital part of the greater whole, College Experi
ence, is gone—perhaps, though I certainly hope
not, forever. Every single, solitary shade in Bran
ner Hall is pulled down each and every night.
This display of modesty, Victorianism and, in
deed. conceit is not only against the grain of a
truly well-rounded education but also counter to,
and a flagrant violation of, the Stanford Tradi
tion -which, as even the most uninitiated fresh
man will agree, is one of the most fundamental
facets and, indeed, the whole solid foundation of
a truly happy, wholesome and profitable College
Experience here at Stanford.
There are several reasons (which I shall pre
sent in numbered statements for the close scru
tiny of my fellow students) for one to become
slightly upset about this problem.
1. First (but not foremost) is the fact that too
much emphasis is being placed upon national and
international problems such as integrating the
Deep South (which is, in reality, not worth all the
trouble) and very little attention is being focused
these days on the deep-seated problems and trials
facing us here on this very campus!

I have just made a startling discovery concern
ing the distaff section of the big. sprawling,
happy Stanford Family. The girls in this Univer
sity are, theoretically, chosen on the basis of in
telligence and personal initiative.
It seems odd that the female members of the
aforesaid big, sprawling, happy Stanford Family
are compelled to attend free, democratic, untram
meled meetings once a week. In these junior
league soviets the girls get to approve what is
best for them. What is best for them has been
benevolently determined in advance by their
R.A.'s. This is definitely THE BEST WAY, as we
all know that discussions are of no value, espe
cially if they lead to any result.
But, at any rate, the girls are welcome to par
ticipate in these discussions. In fact, if they do
not avail themselves of this privilege, they are
allowed to contribute to the funds of their living
groups, and if they waive their privilege enough
times, they are encouraged to participate in a
more exclusive democratic group known as the
Women's Council.
To make sure that all abide by the freely-de
cided rules and regulations, a special group
comparable to the MOB in my country—go about
to ascertain popular opinion in the living groups.
They report this opinion to their superiors and
with admirable thoroughness include the names
ol those who hold the various opinions. This
process is carried out so painlessly that many
girls are not even aware that their opinions are
being polled.
To insure that the girls get to know one an
other, they are encouraged to eat in the living
group dining areas almost exclusively.
And, most important of all, a proper mental
state is encouraged in the young ladies. If one of
them gets the Philistine idea of thinking WRONG
THOUGHTS an admirable organization aids them
in their return to the proper ideology.
Girls do not know what is best for them and
are therefore not allowed, for their own good, to
live off campus. Many girls oVer 21 seem to think
this unfair, but they do not really know their own
minds.
Ali hail, all power, to the handful of girls who
keep this remarkable system going! 1 am sure
they will go on to bigger and better things ( DAR,
improvement clubs, WCTU, Watch and Ward,
etc.l. Keep up the good work! In the new world
such minds as yours will be highly valued.
I hope none of these budding young leaders will
think I am in any way mocking them. Only a

Upon my blessed return to Stanford, after a
long summer, 1 immediately noticed an appalling
fact. Glancing out of my window at night, there
seems to be no vestige of the once flowering spirit
in Branner Hall. What was considered such a
vital part of the greater whole, College Experi
ence, is gone—perhaps, though I certainly hope
not, forever. Every single, solitary shade in Bran
ner Hall is pulled down each and every night.
This display of modesty, Victorianism and, in
deed. conceit is not only against the grain of a
truly well-rounded education but also counter to,
and a flagrant violation of, the Stanford Tradi
tion -which, as even the most uninitiated fresh
man will agree, is one of the most fundamental
facets and, indeed, the whole solid foundation of
a truly happy, wholesome and profitable College
Experience here at Stanford.
There are several reasons (which I shall pre
sent in numbered statements for the close scru
tiny of my fellow students) for one to become
slightly upset about this problem.
1. First (but not foremost) is the fact that too
much emphasis is being placed upon national and
international problems such as integrating the
Deep South (which is, in reality, not worth all the
trouble) and very little attention is being focused
these days on the deep-seated problems and trials
facing us here on this very campus!
2. Perhaps the girls (I here hesitate to use such
a word in describing the Young Females which
hold dear to their hearts the chambers of Dear
Old Branner) do not realize that Ihey are com
mitting a rending breach of tradition as old as
('ollege Life itself.
3. Thirdly, and here I refer the reader to the
opening paragraphs above, these ignoble and
savage practices are counter to the spirit of true
progressive education as it is said to prevail here
at Stanford. By the simple removal of the Bran
ner Shades, a striking saving of dollars could be
realized. This money could be put to some useful
purpose such as completing the new Medical Cen
ter or the permanent conversion of Encina Hall
into an infirmary for housing the victims of the
latest debilitating fads, better known as epi
demics.
4. The persistent and careful reader will notice
(or perhaps the memory will have faded into a
misty past by this timet that I have used the
rather acute and acrid term "conceit" in connec
tion with, and the description of, the Branner
Women. I cannot help but wonder if this "con
ceit" is not the real basis for the whole deplorable
situation.
Last year the women were no raving beauties

R.A.'s. This is definitely THE BEST WAY, as we
all know that discussions are of no value, espe
cially if they lead to any result.
But, at any rate, the girls are welcome to par
ticipate in these discussions. In fact, if they do
not avail themselves of this privilege, they are
allowed to contribute to the funds of their living
groups, and if they waive their privilege enough
times, they are encouraged to participate in a
more exclusive democratic group known as the
Women's Council.
To make sure that all abide by the freely-de
cided rules and regulations, a special group
comparable to the MOB in my country—go about
to ascertain popular opinion in the living groups.
They report this opinion to their superiors and
with admirable thoroughness include the names
ol those who hold the various opinions. This
process is carried out so painlessly that many
girls are not even aware that their opinions are
being polled.
To insure that the girls get to know one an
other, they are encouraged to eat in the living
group dining areas almost exclusively.
And, most important of all, a proper mental
state is encouraged in the young ladies. If one of
them gets the Philistine idea of thinking WRONG
THOUGHTS an admirable organization aids them
in their return to the proper ideology.
Girls do not know what is best for them and
are therefore not allowed, for their own good, to
live off campus. Many girls oVer 21 seem to think
this unfair, but they do not really know their own
minds.
Ali hail, all power, to the handful of girls who
keep this remarkable system going! 1 am sure
they will go on to bigger and better things ( DAR,
improvement clubs, WCTU, Watch and Ward,
etc.l. Keep up the good work! In the new world
such minds as yours will be highly valued.
I hope none of these budding young leaders will
think I am in any way mocking them. Only a
depraved, anti-social WRONG THINKER would
get such a meaning. We who are pure of heart,
as you well know, are'simple people and are often
misunderstood.
