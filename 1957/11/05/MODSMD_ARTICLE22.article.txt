# VALVE OF FRIENDSHIP
## Sam McDonald Lived Two Lives—Both Fruitful 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Sam McDonald considered himself fortunate: be was endowed
with two lives; most people have only one. And both of Sam's were
fruitful.
Born Emmanuel B. McDonald on Jan. 1, 188-1. in Monroe, Louisi
ana, Stanford's "Sam" was the fifth of seven children.

His parents both were children j
of slaves. Sam's father became a !
Methodist minister, and preached
in the Deep South until 1890,
when the whole McDonald family
moved to Southern California
and new pursuits.
Eventually, the family moved
north to the Gilroy area, where
the senior McDonald worked in
the sugar beet fields. Then Sam
got the wanderlust, and jour
neyed back to Washington, D.C.
At one time he wanted to go into
law, but the East just wasn't like
California, and he returned.
He first went to Sacramento,
where he hired on to the "Mo
doc," a river steamboat, as a
chore boy and galley hand. Trav
eling south, he decided to try his
hand at ranching, and got a job
near Palo Alto.
Teamster
Next on the list of occupational
pursuits, Sam became a teamster
in this area .Finally, in 1903, he
began working for the organiza
tion he devoted his life to, Stan
ford University.
Beginning with the task of
night watchman. Sam worked up
to superintendent of athletic I
buildings and grounds, a position,
he held for 51 years.
Sam served in this capacity un
der all of the University's five
presidents. He had a home facing
Angell Fieid, near the cinder
track he laid.
54 Years
Throughout his 54-year stay at
Stanford, thousands of students j
wended their way to his home
and office. They chatted with
him, told him their problems, and !
went to Sam for everything. His
generosity never ceased.
With no pomp or ceremony, de
siring no recognition, Sam put i
numerous students through Stan
ford.
Always trying to be helpful,
sometimes Sam even acted like
Cupid. The story goes that one
day two students were to meet
Sam at his La Honda home. Ar
riving after them, Sam didn't
want to startle them by his en
trance, so he nonchalantly drop
ped a number of pots and pans.
Sam had arrived.
400 Acres
Sam had a home, with about
400 wooded hillside acres, at La
Honda in the coastal mountains.
His "reservation" had been open
to his friends since 1918. Here
the Sierra Club practiced hiking
a few years ago, here numerous
people just went to retreat.
Sam had great plans for his
wild-life sanctuary here. He in
tended to turn it into a "Stan
ford Indian Reservation" for the
use of students—a perfect place
for parties, picnicking and camp
ing.
Bachelor Sam enjoyed having
guests for dinner. In fact, lie
liked it so much that in 1954 he
supervised a dinner for 5000.
Originally, a few boys would
drop in for a sandwich, but as he
said, "Then it grew to more of
the boys and their lady friends

j all going out for a party. They
| convinced me that I could harbe
: cue" —and Sam did, for 50 years.
His most famous barbecues, of
course, are the ones he put on
for the Con Home during Stan
! ford's annual Con Home Week.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
was close to Sam's heart.
Con Home Work
He became a staunch supporter
of it, and during World War II
maintained a victory garden to
assure an adequate supply of
vegetables for the children. Ac
cording to Mrs. Ruth Spande At
wood, for 30 years administrator
of the Convalescent Home, on
Sam's first trips out, he was shy,
and waved in the windows to the
children. Soon he was in the
i house, spinning yarns for the
I children which fascinated them so
: they never wanted him to leave
and he didn't eilher.
Sam was out with the children
every spare moment he could
find. He played with them,
helped them, and aided many in
their yearning for knowledge af
ter they were released from the
Con Home.
Gifts from Children
The youngsters at Hie Con
Home showered Sam with gifts
every time he journeyed over; he
visited them for the last time a
few weeks ago.
With the thousands of students
who have called Sam McDonald a
| friend, the hundreds of Con
i Home children he befriended, and
hundreds of others throughout
| the country, Sam McDonald was
j truly a man rich in a wealth of
friendships.
Sam realized his fortune. One
of his favorite mottoes hung on
j the wall of his bachelor apart
ment: "He who has a thousand
friends has not one to spare."
Sam went out of his way to ac
knowledge these many friends.
Last year he mailed over 800
Christmas cards, midst receiving
callers, phone calls, and making
plans for another book.
An Author, Too
Yes, in addition to his many
other assets, Sam was an author.
His "Sam McDonald's Farm" was
, a compilation of accounts of 50
years at Stanford. This book
dealt with the first generation of
Stanford and his friends; the sec
ond was to have dealt with the
second and third. Receipts from
the book all went to the Con
Home.
The largest personal corre
spondence of anyone ai. Stanford
was carried on by Sam in the
writing of this book. The letters
| of friends who wrote him con
cerning dates and various anec
; dotes were bound in a volume by
workmen of the Stanford Univer
! sity Press and presented him at a
i Con Home Christmas party in
j 1954.
Included in the volume were
| letters from U.S. Senator Mat
thew Neely; Earl Behrens, politi
cal editor of the San Francisco
I Chronicle; J. Arthur Younger,

California representative in Con-1
gress; Homer R. Spence, associ
ate justice of the California Su
preme Court; ant! many others of 1
his acquaintances.
The recognition Sam McDonald
received during his lifetime could
never come close to repaying;
this unselfish Negro gentleman.
Among the honors he received
was having a Stanford road
named after him. Sam McDon
ald Road runs from the Encina
Gym to El Camino Real, and was j
formally named by Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur in 1941.
Said Wilbur at the dedication. j
"I wouldn't want to run against '
Sam for president because I'd be
sure to lose."
Sam was given a new car at his 1
retirement banquet held at; Rick- j
ey's in 1954. He was an honorary

member of the Stanford Alumni
Association. Sam organized and
sponsored an informal organiza
tion in 1952 called the "Sons and
Daughters of Stanford Alumni."
Sam planned many activities
following his retirement, but in
August of 1955, he was hospital
ized for treatment of a severe leg
infection, which eventually re
quired amputation of both legs.
In the hospital for six months,
Sam explained thai he was ready
to die, but "Stanford students
and other friends gave me the de
I sire to live that I'd lost when 1
got sick."
Upon getting out of the hospi
tal, Sam called his sickness a
blessing in disguise because it
taught him how to live for other
: people's joy. And this he did, in
his second life.

California, and he returned.
He first went to Sacramento,
where he hired on to the "Mo
doc," a river steamboat, as a
chore boy and galley hand. Trav
eling south, he decided to try his
hand at ranching, and got a job
near Palo Alto.
Teamster
Next on the list of occupational
pursuits, Sam became a teamster
in this area .Finally, in 1903, he
began working for the organiza
tion he devoted his life to, Stan
ford University.
Beginning with the task of
night watchman. Sam worked up
to superintendent of athletic I
buildings and grounds, a position,
he held for 51 years.
Sam served in this capacity un
der all of the University's five
presidents. He had a home facing
Angell Fieid, near the cinder
track he laid.
54 Years
Throughout his 54-year stay at
Stanford, thousands of students j
wended their way to his home
and office. They chatted with
him, told him their problems, and !
went to Sam for everything. His
generosity never ceased.
With no pomp or ceremony, de
siring no recognition, Sam put i
numerous students through Stan
ford.
Always trying to be helpful,
sometimes Sam even acted like
Cupid. The story goes that one
day two students were to meet
Sam at his La Honda home. Ar
riving after them, Sam didn't
want to startle them by his en
trance, so he nonchalantly drop
ped a number of pots and pans.
Sam had arrived.
400 Acres
Sam had a home, with about
400 wooded hillside acres, at La
Honda in the coastal mountains.
His "reservation" had been open
to his friends since 1918. Here
the Sierra Club practiced hiking
a few years ago, here numerous
people just went to retreat.
Sam had great plans for his
wild-life sanctuary here. He in
tended to turn it into a "Stan
ford Indian Reservation" for the
use of students—a perfect place
for parties, picnicking and camp
ing.
Bachelor Sam enjoyed having
guests for dinner. In fact, lie
liked it so much that in 1954 he
supervised a dinner for 5000.
Originally, a few boys would
drop in for a sandwich, but as he
said, "Then it grew to more of
the boys and their lady friends

j all going out for a party. They
| convinced me that I could harbe
: cue" —and Sam did, for 50 years.
His most famous barbecues, of
course, are the ones he put on
for the Con Home during Stan
! ford's annual Con Home Week.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
was close to Sam's heart.
Con Home Work
He became a staunch supporter
of it, and during World War II
maintained a victory garden to
assure an adequate supply of
vegetables for the children. Ac
cording to Mrs. Ruth Spande At
wood, for 30 years administrator
of the Convalescent Home, on
Sam's first trips out, he was shy,
and waved in the windows to the
children. Soon he was in the
i house, spinning yarns for the
I children which fascinated them so
: they never wanted him to leave
and he didn't eilher.
Sam was out with the children
every spare moment he could
find. He played with them,
helped them, and aided many in
their yearning for knowledge af
ter they were released from the
Con Home.
Gifts from Children
The youngsters at Hie Con
Home showered Sam with gifts
every time he journeyed over; he
visited them for the last time a
few weeks ago.
With the thousands of students
who have called Sam McDonald a
| friend, the hundreds of Con
i Home children he befriended, and
hundreds of others throughout
| the country, Sam McDonald was
j truly a man rich in a wealth of
friendships.
Sam realized his fortune. One
of his favorite mottoes hung on
j the wall of his bachelor apart
ment: "He who has a thousand
friends has not one to spare."
Sam went out of his way to ac
knowledge these many friends.
Last year he mailed over 800
Christmas cards, midst receiving
callers, phone calls, and making
plans for another book.
An Author, Too
Yes, in addition to his many
other assets, Sam was an author.
His "Sam McDonald's Farm" was
, a compilation of accounts of 50
years at Stanford. This book
dealt with the first generation of
Stanford and his friends; the sec
ond was to have dealt with the
second and third. Receipts from
the book all went to the Con
Home.
The largest personal corre
spondence of anyone ai. Stanford
was carried on by Sam in the
writing of this book. The letters
| of friends who wrote him con
cerning dates and various anec
; dotes were bound in a volume by
workmen of the Stanford Univer
! sity Press and presented him at a
i Con Home Christmas party in
j 1954.
Included in the volume were
| letters from U.S. Senator Mat
thew Neely; Earl Behrens, politi
cal editor of the San Francisco
I Chronicle; J. Arthur Younger,

California representative in Con-1
gress; Homer R. Spence, associ
ate justice of the California Su
preme Court; ant! many others of 1
his acquaintances.
The recognition Sam McDonald
received during his lifetime could
never come close to repaying;
this unselfish Negro gentleman.
Among the honors he received
was having a Stanford road
named after him. Sam McDon
ald Road runs from the Encina
Gym to El Camino Real, and was j
formally named by Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur in 1941.
Said Wilbur at the dedication. j
"I wouldn't want to run against '
Sam for president because I'd be
sure to lose."
Sam was given a new car at his 1
retirement banquet held at; Rick- j
ey's in 1954. He was an honorary

member of the Stanford Alumni
Association. Sam organized and
sponsored an informal organiza
tion in 1952 called the "Sons and
Daughters of Stanford Alumni."
Sam planned many activities
following his retirement, but in
August of 1955, he was hospital
ized for treatment of a severe leg
infection, which eventually re
quired amputation of both legs.
In the hospital for six months,
Sam explained thai he was ready
to die, but "Stanford students
and other friends gave me the de
I sire to live that I'd lost when 1
got sick."
Upon getting out of the hospi
tal, Sam called his sickness a
blessing in disguise because it
taught him how to live for other
: people's joy. And this he did, in
his second life.
Sam McDonald considered himself fortunate: be was endowed
with two lives; most people have only one. And both of Sam's were
fruitful.
Born Emmanuel B. McDonald on Jan. 1, 188-1. in Monroe, Louisi
ana, Stanford's "Sam" was the fifth of seven children.

His parents both were children j
of slaves. Sam's father became a !
Methodist minister, and preached
in the Deep South until 1890,
when the whole McDonald family
moved to Southern California
and new pursuits.
Eventually, the family moved
north to the Gilroy area, where
the senior McDonald worked in
the sugar beet fields. Then Sam
got the wanderlust, and jour
neyed back to Washington, D.C.

54 Years
Throughout his 54-year stay at
Stanford, thousands of students j
wended their way to his home
and office. They chatted with
him, told him their problems, and !
went to Sam for everything. His
generosity never ceased.
With no pomp or ceremony, de
siring no recognition, Sam put i
numerous students through Stan
ford.
Always trying to be helpful,
sometimes Sam even acted like
Cupid. The story goes that one
day two students were to meet
Sam at his La Honda home. Ar
riving after them, Sam didn't
want to startle them by his en
trance, so he nonchalantly drop
ped a number of pots and pans.
Sam had arrived.
400 Acres
Sam had a home, with about
400 wooded hillside acres, at La
Honda in the coastal mountains.
His "reservation" had been open
to his friends since 1918. Here
the Sierra Club practiced hiking
a few years ago, here numerous
people just went to retreat.
Sam had great plans for his
wild-life sanctuary here. He in
tended to turn it into a "Stan
ford Indian Reservation" for the
use of students—a perfect place
for parties, picnicking and camp
ing.
Bachelor Sam enjoyed having
guests for dinner. In fact, lie
liked it so much that in 1954 he
supervised a dinner for 5000.
Originally, a few boys would
drop in for a sandwich, but as he
said, "Then it grew to more of
the boys and their lady friends

j all going out for a party. They
| convinced me that I could harbe
: cue" —and Sam did, for 50 years.
His most famous barbecues, of
course, are the ones he put on
for the Con Home during Stan
! ford's annual Con Home Week.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
was close to Sam's heart.
Con Home Work
He became a staunch supporter
of it, and during World War II
maintained a victory garden to
assure an adequate supply of
vegetables for the children. Ac
cording to Mrs. Ruth Spande At
wood, for 30 years administrator
of the Convalescent Home, on
Sam's first trips out, he was shy,
and waved in the windows to the
children. Soon he was in the
i house, spinning yarns for the
I children which fascinated them so
: they never wanted him to leave
and he didn't eilher.
Sam was out with the children
every spare moment he could
find. He played with them,
helped them, and aided many in
their yearning for knowledge af
ter they were released from the
Con Home.
Gifts from Children
The youngsters at Hie Con
Home showered Sam with gifts
every time he journeyed over; he
visited them for the last time a
few weeks ago.
With the thousands of students
who have called Sam McDonald a
| friend, the hundreds of Con
i Home children he befriended, and
hundreds of others throughout
| the country, Sam McDonald was
j truly a man rich in a wealth of
friendships.
Sam realized his fortune. One
of his favorite mottoes hung on
j the wall of his bachelor apart
ment: "He who has a thousand
friends has not one to spare."
Sam went out of his way to ac
knowledge these many friends.
Last year he mailed over 800
Christmas cards, midst receiving
callers, phone calls, and making
plans for another book.
An Author, Too
Yes, in addition to his many
other assets, Sam was an author.
His "Sam McDonald's Farm" was
, a compilation of accounts of 50
years at Stanford. This book
dealt with the first generation of
Stanford and his friends; the sec
ond was to have dealt with the
second and third. Receipts from
the book all went to the Con
Home.
The largest personal corre
spondence of anyone ai. Stanford
was carried on by Sam in the
writing of this book. The letters
| of friends who wrote him con
cerning dates and various anec
; dotes were bound in a volume by
workmen of the Stanford Univer
! sity Press and presented him at a
i Con Home Christmas party in
j 1954.
Included in the volume were
| letters from U.S. Senator Mat
thew Neely; Earl Behrens, politi
cal editor of the San Francisco
I Chronicle; J. Arthur Younger,

California representative in Con-1
gress; Homer R. Spence, associ
ate justice of the California Su
preme Court; ant! many others of 1
his acquaintances.
The recognition Sam McDonald
received during his lifetime could
never come close to repaying;
this unselfish Negro gentleman.
Among the honors he received
was having a Stanford road
named after him. Sam McDon
ald Road runs from the Encina
Gym to El Camino Real, and was j
formally named by Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur in 1941.
Said Wilbur at the dedication. j
"I wouldn't want to run against '
Sam for president because I'd be
sure to lose."
Sam was given a new car at his 1
retirement banquet held at; Rick- j
ey's in 1954. He was an honorary

member of the Stanford Alumni
Association. Sam organized and
sponsored an informal organiza
tion in 1952 called the "Sons and
Daughters of Stanford Alumni."
Sam planned many activities
following his retirement, but in
August of 1955, he was hospital
ized for treatment of a severe leg
infection, which eventually re
quired amputation of both legs.
In the hospital for six months,
Sam explained thai he was ready
to die, but "Stanford students
and other friends gave me the de
I sire to live that I'd lost when 1
got sick."
Upon getting out of the hospi
tal, Sam called his sickness a
blessing in disguise because it
taught him how to live for other
: people's joy. And this he did, in
his second life.
Sam McDonald considered himself fortunate: be was endowed
with two lives; most people have only one. And both of Sam's were
fruitful.
Born Emmanuel B. McDonald on Jan. 1, 188-1. in Monroe, Louisi
ana, Stanford's "Sam" was the fifth of seven children.

His parents both were children j
of slaves. Sam's father became a !
Methodist minister, and preached
in the Deep South until 1890,
when the whole McDonald family
moved to Southern California
and new pursuits.
Eventually, the family moved
north to the Gilroy area, where
the senior McDonald worked in
the sugar beet fields. Then Sam
got the wanderlust, and jour
neyed back to Washington, D.C.
At one time he wanted to go into
law, but the East just wasn't like
California, and he returned.
He first went to Sacramento,
where he hired on to the "Mo
doc," a river steamboat, as a
chore boy and galley hand. Trav
eling south, he decided to try his
hand at ranching, and got a job
near Palo Alto.
Teamster
Next on the list of occupational
pursuits, Sam became a teamster
in this area .Finally, in 1903, he
began working for the organiza
tion he devoted his life to, Stan
ford University.
Beginning with the task of
night watchman. Sam worked up
to superintendent of athletic I
buildings and grounds, a position,
he held for 51 years.
Sam served in this capacity un
der all of the University's five
presidents. He had a home facing
Angell Fieid, near the cinder
track he laid.

His "reservation" had been open
to his friends since 1918. Here
the Sierra Club practiced hiking
a few years ago, here numerous
people just went to retreat.
Sam had great plans for his
wild-life sanctuary here. He in
tended to turn it into a "Stan
ford Indian Reservation" for the
use of students—a perfect place
for parties, picnicking and camp
ing.
Bachelor Sam enjoyed having
guests for dinner. In fact, lie
liked it so much that in 1954 he
supervised a dinner for 5000.
Originally, a few boys would
drop in for a sandwich, but as he
said, "Then it grew to more of
the boys and their lady friends

j all going out for a party. They
| convinced me that I could harbe
: cue" —and Sam did, for 50 years.
His most famous barbecues, of
course, are the ones he put on
for the Con Home during Stan
! ford's annual Con Home Week.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
was close to Sam's heart.
Con Home Work
He became a staunch supporter
of it, and during World War II
maintained a victory garden to
assure an adequate supply of
vegetables for the children. Ac
cording to Mrs. Ruth Spande At
wood, for 30 years administrator
of the Convalescent Home, on
Sam's first trips out, he was shy,
and waved in the windows to the
children. Soon he was in the
i house, spinning yarns for the
I children which fascinated them so
: they never wanted him to leave
and he didn't eilher.
Sam was out with the children
every spare moment he could
find. He played with them,
helped them, and aided many in
their yearning for knowledge af
ter they were released from the
Con Home.
Gifts from Children
The youngsters at Hie Con
Home showered Sam with gifts
every time he journeyed over; he
visited them for the last time a
few weeks ago.
With the thousands of students
who have called Sam McDonald a
| friend, the hundreds of Con
i Home children he befriended, and
hundreds of others throughout
| the country, Sam McDonald was
j truly a man rich in a wealth of
friendships.
Sam realized his fortune. One
of his favorite mottoes hung on
j the wall of his bachelor apart
ment: "He who has a thousand
friends has not one to spare."
Sam went out of his way to ac
knowledge these many friends.
Last year he mailed over 800
Christmas cards, midst receiving
callers, phone calls, and making
plans for another book.
An Author, Too
Yes, in addition to his many
other assets, Sam was an author.
His "Sam McDonald's Farm" was
, a compilation of accounts of 50
years at Stanford. This book
dealt with the first generation of
Stanford and his friends; the sec
ond was to have dealt with the
second and third. Receipts from
the book all went to the Con
Home.
The largest personal corre
spondence of anyone ai. Stanford
was carried on by Sam in the
writing of this book. The letters
| of friends who wrote him con
cerning dates and various anec
; dotes were bound in a volume by
workmen of the Stanford Univer
! sity Press and presented him at a
i Con Home Christmas party in
j 1954.
Included in the volume were
| letters from U.S. Senator Mat
thew Neely; Earl Behrens, politi
cal editor of the San Francisco
I Chronicle; J. Arthur Younger,

California representative in Con-1
gress; Homer R. Spence, associ
ate justice of the California Su
preme Court; ant! many others of 1
his acquaintances.
The recognition Sam McDonald
received during his lifetime could
never come close to repaying;
this unselfish Negro gentleman.
Among the honors he received
was having a Stanford road
named after him. Sam McDon
ald Road runs from the Encina
Gym to El Camino Real, and was j
formally named by Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur in 1941.
Said Wilbur at the dedication. j
"I wouldn't want to run against '
Sam for president because I'd be
sure to lose."
Sam was given a new car at his 1
retirement banquet held at; Rick- j
ey's in 1954. He was an honorary

member of the Stanford Alumni
Association. Sam organized and
sponsored an informal organiza
tion in 1952 called the "Sons and
Daughters of Stanford Alumni."
Sam planned many activities
following his retirement, but in
August of 1955, he was hospital
ized for treatment of a severe leg
infection, which eventually re
quired amputation of both legs.
In the hospital for six months,
Sam explained thai he was ready
to die, but "Stanford students
and other friends gave me the de
I sire to live that I'd lost when 1
got sick."
Upon getting out of the hospi
tal, Sam called his sickness a
blessing in disguise because it
taught him how to live for other
: people's joy. And this he did, in
his second life.
Sam McDonald considered himself fortunate: be was endowed
with two lives; most people have only one. And both of Sam's were
fruitful.
Born Emmanuel B. McDonald on Jan. 1, 188-1. in Monroe, Louisi
ana, Stanford's "Sam" was the fifth of seven children.

His parents both were children j
of slaves. Sam's father became a !
Methodist minister, and preached
in the Deep South until 1890,
when the whole McDonald family
moved to Southern California
and new pursuits.
Eventually, the family moved
north to the Gilroy area, where
the senior McDonald worked in
the sugar beet fields. Then Sam
got the wanderlust, and jour
neyed back to Washington, D.C.
At one time he wanted to go into
law, but the East just wasn't like
California, and he returned.
He first went to Sacramento,
where he hired on to the "Mo
doc," a river steamboat, as a
chore boy and galley hand. Trav
eling south, he decided to try his
hand at ranching, and got a job
near Palo Alto.
Teamster
Next on the list of occupational
pursuits, Sam became a teamster
in this area .Finally, in 1903, he
began working for the organiza
tion he devoted his life to, Stan
ford University.
Beginning with the task of
night watchman. Sam worked up
to superintendent of athletic I
buildings and grounds, a position,
he held for 51 years.
Sam served in this capacity un
der all of the University's five
presidents. He had a home facing
Angell Fieid, near the cinder
track he laid.
54 Years
Throughout his 54-year stay at
Stanford, thousands of students j
wended their way to his home
and office. They chatted with
him, told him their problems, and !
went to Sam for everything. His
generosity never ceased.
With no pomp or ceremony, de
siring no recognition, Sam put i
numerous students through Stan
ford.
Always trying to be helpful,
sometimes Sam even acted like
Cupid. The story goes that one
day two students were to meet
Sam at his La Honda home. Ar
riving after them, Sam didn't
want to startle them by his en
trance, so he nonchalantly drop
ped a number of pots and pans.
