The City Boys Have Done It Already
Because of the circumstances, the "gobble" will be kept down
to a minimum today. Too many city sports writers have rationalized
that game of football away already.
One word before we give you the "grut" of the column. Jackie
Douglas* and Al Harrington did a great job out there Saturday.
Don't blame them. In fact, Harrington gained more than 100 yards
on the ground the first time in his Stanford career. Douglas gained
210 yards in the air. Stanford blew it by the "toe" route again and
will probably blow at least one more that way before the season is
over—it is inevitable.
SHORT AND QUICKIES: Former Farm footballers who can be
seen each afternoon assisting Bob Gliilotti wilh the frosh are Carl

Isaacs, Donn Curs well and Jerry
Beatie. . . . The Indians have a
lop- notch assistant in Dutch
Fehring- who was trained at Okla
homa as a line coach immediate
ly after World War II. He was
graduated from Purdue with
nine letters in football, basketball
and baseball in 1934. Dining the
spring he is head baseball men
tor, having taken over that post
in 1956 and won 24, lost 10 and
lied 1— the best record since 1931.
. . . Kill C'orbus, All-American
guard in 1932 and 1933, holds the
modern record for the most min
utes played by a Stanford player

during one season 550 minutes in all games during the 1933 season.
He will be welcomed officially into the National Football Hall of
Fame at the Big Game halftime activities this year. . . . Stanford
has scored two 82-0 games against opponents since 1892. They were
against Mare Island in 1923 and UCLA in 1925. Stanford's highest
score of the recent era was against the University of Hawaii, 74-20,
in 1949.
BIGGEST HUMOR AFLOAT: Former Stanford football star
Dick llyland, in one of his sports columns in the Los Angeles Times,
recently said that ill health probably would cause Athletic Director
Al Masters' to retire soon. His replacement most likely would be
football coach Chuck Taylor and the head grid job would be offered
first to all-time Indian quarterback and now 49cr coach Frankie
Albert.
