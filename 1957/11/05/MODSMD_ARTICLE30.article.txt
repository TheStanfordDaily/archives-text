# THE 						INJURY SCOREBOARD
## Two Noses, One Tooth for Indians 
### Roy Lawson 
Noblest Hammurabists of them
all, the Stanford Indians did not
retaliate in the "nose for a nose
and tooth for a tooth" fashion
during last Saturday's Oregon
game, despite suffering a bitter
27-26 defeat.
The Indians, who openpd drills
yesterday for their Saturday aft-,
ernoon game against the Univer
sity of Southern California in the
Los Angeles Coliseum, suffered
two broken noses and a knocked-j
out tooth against the Oregonians. :
Following a rough-and-tumble |
game scrimmage between reserve
players yesterday, Stanford train- j
er Connie Jarvis said no Indian
was injured sufficiently against |
the Ducks to sideline him for the:
USC game.
Trio Will Be Ready
Tackle John Kidd has a shoul-.
der pointer, center John Thomas
has a strained elbow and halfback j
A 1 Harrington, the Indians' lead-1
] ing ground-gainer against Oregon
with 106 yards, has slightly strain
ed knees; but the trio will be
| ready for the Trojans Saturday.
Coach Chuck Taylor had his
I first-line unit running plays and
pass patterns by itself yesterday,
while the remainder of the squad
banged heads in a lengthy game
type scrimmage.
The Indians will focus the spot-!

light on defense today when drills
for the Trojan game move into
their second day.
El Troy, which dropped its first
five games this season, .finally
broke into the victory column last
week by defeating winless Uni
versity of Washington. 19-12.
Previously the Trojans had fall
en to Oregon State, 20-0; Michi
gan, 16-6; Pittsburgh, 20-14;
Washington State, 13-12; and even
California, 12-0.
By comparison, the Indians also
toppled Washington by 7 points,
21-14, and fell by 3 points and 44

seconds to Washington State, 21 j
to 18.
Coach Don Clark's Trojans op
prate from the split-T formation,
with Jim Conroy and Tom Maud
lin, former Menlo College star,
alternating at quarterback.
Pacific Coast Conference sub
sidy penalties rapped the Trojans'
knuckles hard this year, and eight
USC seniors, including potential
All-American fullback C. R. Rob
erts, were ruled ineligible for
their final season of competition.
In addition, USC lost first-string
ends Hillard Hill and Bob Voiles
at the season's outset because of :
injuries. The Trojans' 49-man ros- 1
ter includes only 1.3 lettermen.
Stanford holds a two-game win
ning streak in the 35-game series
against the Smogvillians. USC
has won 19 times, the Cardinals
14 times, and four games have
been tied.
Last year Stanford spoiled All-
American halfback Jon Arnett's
final game for Troy by flipping
the Trojans, 27-19, before 70,000
spectators at Stanford Stadium.
The Indians won, 28-20, in 1955.
Southern California's last tri
umph over the Big Red Machine
came in 1954, when the Rose Bowl
bound Cardinal-and-Gold group of
that season prevailed, 21-7.
