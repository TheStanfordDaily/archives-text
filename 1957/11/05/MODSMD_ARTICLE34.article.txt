# Creative Writing Instructor Explains Revamped Course
## 
### Betty Kantor 
Until a few years ago, Richard
Kraus thought that people who
enrolled in introductory creative
writing classes had been stimu
lated to write because they had
read widely and wanted to be
come writers themselves.
"Now I'm not so sure," says
Kraus, who is in his third year
with Stanford's English Depart
ment, teaching English 5, a nar
rative course, and 133, a more ad
vanced class. "It seems that they
are 'culture vultures' trying
their wings. Now they are inter
ested in writing; next year it will
be finger painting, or ballet."
As a result of this lack of read
ing on the part of students, Kraus
revamped the English 5 course
and regards it now as a literature |
course. Students are taught the j
basic ingredients of short stories
so that they can recognize them
in others' work or in their own.
New Program
Things are getting better main
ly, Kraus believes, because of tho
new English program which in
cludes more literature in the long
er freshman English course and
the special English classes. At
least now when he mentions a
short story in glass, there is no
longer silence in answer to the
question, "Has anyone read it?" 1
Not all of Kraus' students are!
taking creative writing .just fori
an easy three units. A pleasant j
surprise for him has been the cx-;
tremely high caliber of student ;

fiction on the campus in general
and the fact that there seem to be
more good writers at Stanford
than in most creative writing de
partments around the country.
Much of this good student writ
ing has been helped along by
Kraus himself. "A Camp in the
Wilderness" by Dennis Murphy
and "Cats Are Like People" by
Joanne Hardy, both appearing in
the current issue of "Stanford
Short Stories," were written in
Kraus's classes.
Kraus Students
Murphy recently won the Jo
seph Henry Jackson novel prize.
Also written in a Kraus-taught
class are stories by Susan Geary
and .To Do Eds which will appear
in the next issue of "Sequoia."
Kraus himself is a writer and
will admit to "the most unsuc
cessful unpublished novel I ever
heard of," for which he won the
Avery Hopwood Prize at the Uni
versity of Michigan.
Short Story Writer
lie originally came to Stanford
on a creative writing scholarship,
and has published short stories in
"Stanford Short Stories" and in
the University of Michigan liter
ary magazine. As an undergrad

At present Kraus, a faculty
resident at Wilbur Hall, spends
his summers and vacations writ
ing another novel. He is also
thinking of completing the re
quirements for a doctorate which
he started at Michigan.

fiction on the campus in general
and the fact that there seem to be
more good writers at Stanford
than in most creative writing de
partments around the country.
Much of this good student writ
ing has been helped along by
Kraus himself. "A Camp in the
Wilderness" by Dennis Murphy
and "Cats Are Like People" by
Joanne Hardy, both appearing in
the current issue of "Stanford
Short Stories," were written in
Kraus's classes.

Murphy recently won the Jo
seph Henry Jackson novel prize.
Also written in a Kraus-taught
class are stories by Susan Geary
and .To Do Eds which will appear
in the next issue of "Sequoia."
Kraus himself is a writer and
will admit to "the most unsuc
cessful unpublished novel I ever
heard of," for which he won the
Avery Hopwood Prize at the Uni
versity of Michigan.
Short Story Writer
lie originally came to Stanford
on a creative writing scholarship,
and has published short stories in
"Stanford Short Stories" and in
the University of Michigan liter
ary magazine. As an undergrad
uate, he won several prizes for
short stories.
At present Kraus, a faculty
resident at Wilbur Hall, spends
his summers and vacations writ
ing another novel. He is also
thinking of completing the re
quirements for a doctorate which
he started at Michigan.
Until a few years ago, Richard
Kraus thought that people who
enrolled in introductory creative
writing classes had been stimu
lated to write because they had
read widely and wanted to be
come writers themselves.
"Now I'm not so sure," says
Kraus, who is in his third year
with Stanford's English Depart
ment, teaching English 5, a nar
rative course, and 133, a more ad
vanced class. "It seems that they
are 'culture vultures' trying
their wings. Now they are inter
ested in writing; next year it will
be finger painting, or ballet."
As a result of this lack of read
ing on the part of students, Kraus
revamped the English 5 course
and regards it now as a literature |
course. Students are taught the j
basic ingredients of short stories
so that they can recognize them
in others' work or in their own.
New Program
Things are getting better main
ly, Kraus believes, because of tho
new English program which in
cludes more literature in the long
er freshman English course and
the special English classes. At
least now when he mentions a
short story in glass, there is no
longer silence in answer to the
question, "Has anyone read it?" 1
