# Russia Agrees To Tell World 'Muttnik' Data
## Valuable Space Travel Information Promised Under IGY Obligations 
### 
Compiled from Associated I'ress
Russia has agreed to tell Ihe
world what she learns from Sput
nik II and its dog. under commit
ments of the International Geo
physical Year.
When Sputnik I was launched
a month ago, a Soviet scientist
said it was a tost shot and there
fore "outside the IGY." That could
mean no obligation to tell of its
findings.
But the first official announce
ment about Sputnik II said it was
launched "in conformity with the
IGY program" to study the upper
air and space. No such phrase
was used regarding Sputnik I.
IGY is a cooperative effort by
scientists of 64 nations to discover
new knowledge about our earth,
Ihe sun. air and space. All nations
are pledged to report fully and
share everything each learns, in
cluding discoveries made by baby
moons.
Other Findings
Russian scientists are reporting
IGY findings in other fields, such
as observations of the sun and the
ionosphere—tlie electrified layer
of air which reflects radio signals.
Dr. Norman Lee Barr, a U.S.
Navy doctor of medical research,
said that data which the Russians
are collecting from Sputnik ll's
dog reactions would enable scien
tists to learn, for example, some
thing about response of the heart
and lungs to the gravity-free state
in space and possibly sometning
about the influence of the gravity
free state on the digestive process
and metabolism.
The dog. Barr said, is similar to
humans in these processes.
