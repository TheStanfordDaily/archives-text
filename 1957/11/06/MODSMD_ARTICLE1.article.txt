### 
WASHINGTON (/Pj GOP Governor Goodwin J. Knight of Cali
fornia abandoned his campaign for re-election yesterday to bid for
a Senate seat.
Vice-President Nixon promptly wheeled out a glowing endorse
ment of a Knowland-Knight ticket for governor and senator.
After conferences with President Eisenhower and Nixon, Knight
said he is yielding tho field to Senator Knowland (RCalifj in the
race for the 19.18 Republican nomination for governor.
Knight said he will bid for the scat which Knowland will vacate
in what is generally regarded as a possible preliminary move toward
seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 1960 or later.

Knight said Eisenhower was
"pleased to know we wouldn't
have a bitter struggle" in the gov
ernorship primary which might
split the Republican party in Cali
fornia and possibly pave the way
to election of a Democrat as gov
ernor next year.
Knight also told a news confer
ence he had the "unqualified en
dorsement and approval" of Nix
on. Nixon backed this up with a
statement pledging "my full sup
port" to the nomination and elec
tion of Knowland as governor
and Knight as senator.
Clears Way
Knight's decision apparently
cleared the way for Knowland
who is vacating his Senate seat
in January, 1939, to get the nomi
nation for governor, without a
fight.
Nixon, an obvious candidate
for 1 the 1960 presidential nomina
tion. said Knowland has "superb
qualifications" for 1 the office of
governor. He said he is confident
Knight "will prove to be one of
the most articulate and effective
supporters of the Eisenhower ad
ministration in the Senate."
Along with Nixon, Eisenhower
was quoted as expressing pleas
ure that California Republicans
had outwardly patched up their
differences and would present a
united front in 1958.
No Endorsement
Knight said he told Eisenhower
about his decision at a 25-minute
White House conference. He said
he did not ask the President to
endorse him, because Knight said
he doesn't know yet whether oth
er Republicans, including Mayor
George Christopher of San Fran
cisco. will contest for the senato
rial nomination in the party pri
mary.
At Los Angeles, Knowland said
he would support whomever the
Republicans nominate for the
Senate. Asked whether he would
support Knight in advance of the
primary, Knowland refused to
elaborate on his statement.

said he is yielding tho field to Senator Knowland (RCalifj in the
race for the 19.18 Republican nomination for governor.
Knight said he will bid for the scat which Knowland will vacate
in what is generally regarded as a possible preliminary move toward
seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 1960 or later.

Knight said Eisenhower was
"pleased to know we wouldn't
have a bitter struggle" in the gov
ernorship primary which might
split the Republican party in Cali
fornia and possibly pave the way
to election of a Democrat as gov
ernor next year.
Knight also told a news confer
ence he had the "unqualified en
dorsement and approval" of Nix
on. Nixon backed this up with a
statement pledging "my full sup
port" to the nomination and elec
tion of Knowland as governor
and Knight as senator.
Clears Way
Knight's decision apparently
cleared the way for Knowland
who is vacating his Senate seat
in January, 1939, to get the nomi
nation for governor, without a
fight.
Nixon, an obvious candidate
for 1 the 1960 presidential nomina
tion. said Knowland has "superb
qualifications" for 1 the office of
governor. He said he is confident
Knight "will prove to be one of
the most articulate and effective
supporters of the Eisenhower ad
ministration in the Senate."
Along with Nixon, Eisenhower
was quoted as expressing pleas
ure that California Republicans
had outwardly patched up their
differences and would present a
united front in 1958.
No Endorsement
Knight said he told Eisenhower
about his decision at a 25-minute
White House conference. He said
he did not ask the President to
endorse him, because Knight said
he doesn't know yet whether oth
er Republicans, including Mayor
George Christopher of San Fran
cisco. will contest for the senato
rial nomination in the party pri
mary.
At Los Angeles, Knowland said
he would support whomever the
Republicans nominate for the
Senate. Asked whether he would
support Knight in advance of the
primary, Knowland refused to
elaborate on his statement.
