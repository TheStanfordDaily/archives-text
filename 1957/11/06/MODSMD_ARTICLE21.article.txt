# THE 						PLAIN TRUTH
## Hypocrisy on the Rocks 
### David Egger 
Ignoring the widely propagandized intellectual
rind moral superiority of Stanford students, our
Board of Trustees feels obliged to go the Cali
lornia State Legislature one better. No student,
minor or not, may consume liquor on the Stan
lord campus.
The ASSU By-laws (Article 1, Section 3, B)
state, "The possession, transportation, or use of
intoxicating liquors by Stanford students in the
University community shall he grounds for ex
pulsion from the University."
The Trustees' blanket prohibition and the AS
SC By-law stand between students and a mature
altitude toward alcohol. Nothing in the state
l;iws and nothing in !\lrs. Stanford's* will pro
hibits non-minors from drinking on campus.
<The myth-enshrouded will, in fact, is a legal
document: pertaining only to the bequeathal of
properties.)
Our "dry" campus results chiefly from the
Victorian ideas of the founders and the subse
quent All-American family tradition. I believe
that the present University policy is a mistaken
one, and that it should be changed. If the Trus
tees' ruling were rescinded, the ASSU By-law
could be repealed. Then Stanford would join
Hie ranks of leading private universities such as
Harvard, Princeton, MIT and Cal Tech which
trust their 21-year-old and above students to
solve liquor problems for themselves.
The University's policy of total prohibition ag
gravates the problem of student drinking. Fresh
man men are not told that Stanford simply up
holds the laws against minors drinking. Instead,
ihey learn that no Stanford student is ever con
sidered adult enough to possess liquor on cam
pus.
For many, the desire to consume alcohol, al
ready a forbidden fruit, becomes nearly irresis
tible. Dormitory drinking becomes an end-all,
the most exciting adventure of the year. The
exaggerated importance of consuming liquor
leads to the insanity of fraternity beer busts at
8 o'clock in the morning:.

Stanford's liquor policy teaches freshman
women the first lesson in Stanford hypocrisy.
As "Fanny Frosh" pointed out in last Friday's
Daily, freshman women "had been filled with a
lot of talk on the Fundamental Standard, and
they were told it applied everywhere. They did
n't catch (til that most Stanford students draw a
line between the Fundamental Standard and
drinking, and that they don't apply it to liquor
at all."
A change in the University's policy would not
put an end to the problems of minors' drinking.
But it would mean that a non-minor student
would not have to flout the Fundamental Stand
ard every time he accepted a glass of sherry from
a professor. Seniors would not have to leave
campus to hold discussions over beer or :i glass
of wine. Parties now forced off campus could
return to campus where they belong. Drinking
would lose much of its inviting "wickedness."
Adult students could learn to deal with liquor
as adults.
Liquor on campus means increased student re
sponsibility. A 21-year-old would have to decide
whether to serve his 19-year-old roommate. But
the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard are
based upon principles of mutual trust. Can't
these principles apply here?
Just as a student must decide whether or not
to cheat, he must decide whether or not to break
the laws. By banning liquor the University pro
tects us from the necessity of making moral
decisions. If we are as superior as the Stanford
brochures proclaim, we are able to decide for
ourselves, to decide as adu'<ts.
Members of the administration have been dis
cussing this question at great length. Several
believe that the current liquor policy is unrealis
tic and should be revised. Now is the time when
student opinion can be most effective. If stu
dents are interested enough to protest to the
Deans or to write to the Board of Trustees, the
liquor regulations can be changed. But if the
Trustees fail to take action, I believe that they
must make clear to the students of 1957 why
Stanford adheres to a liquor policy of the 1890's.

Stanford's liquor policy teaches freshman
women the first lesson in Stanford hypocrisy.
As "Fanny Frosh" pointed out in last Friday's
Daily, freshman women "had been filled with a
lot of talk on the Fundamental Standard, and
they were told it applied everywhere. They did
n't catch (til that most Stanford students draw a
line between the Fundamental Standard and
drinking, and that they don't apply it to liquor
at all."
A change in the University's policy would not
put an end to the problems of minors' drinking.
But it would mean that a non-minor student
would not have to flout the Fundamental Stand
ard every time he accepted a glass of sherry from
a professor. Seniors would not have to leave
campus to hold discussions over beer or :i glass
of wine. Parties now forced off campus could
return to campus where they belong. Drinking
would lose much of its inviting "wickedness."
Adult students could learn to deal with liquor
as adults.
Liquor on campus means increased student re
sponsibility. A 21-year-old would have to decide
whether to serve his 19-year-old roommate. But
the Honor Code and Fundamental Standard are
based upon principles of mutual trust. Can't
these principles apply here?
Just as a student must decide whether or not
to cheat, he must decide whether or not to break
the laws. By banning liquor the University pro
tects us from the necessity of making moral
decisions. If we are as superior as the Stanford
brochures proclaim, we are able to decide for
ourselves, to decide as adu'<ts.
Members of the administration have been dis
cussing this question at great length. Several
believe that the current liquor policy is unrealis
tic and should be revised. Now is the time when
student opinion can be most effective. If stu
dents are interested enough to protest to the
Deans or to write to the Board of Trustees, the
liquor regulations can be changed. But if the

must make clear to the students of 1957 why
Stanford adheres to a liquor policy of the 1890's.
