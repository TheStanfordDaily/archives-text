Daily Complimented
Editor, The Daily:
You arc certainly to he complimented for pre
senting Mr. Egger's tine article on the proposed
Slanford-in-Germany plan. Such adverse com
ment is essential to an accurate evaluation of the
project. However, I think that Mr. Egger over
looked several points in his criticism. It is true
mat living in an American community in Europe
floes not offei the best opportunities to learn for
eign ways of life. But to say that the German
plan offers no more than an equivalent two
quarters on 7'he Farm is ridiculous.
In addition to the advantage of a concentrated
and practical introduction to the German lan
guage, the plan provides more opportunities for
social contact than Mr. Egger will admit. The
discussion of a four class-day week, social ex
changes with German universities and freedom
for independent travel at the close of the six
months' study period surely offer far better in
sight into modern German culture than any
course the University could devise here in the
United States.
The Stanford branch in Germany was never
intended to "decrease the price of foreign travel."
lialher it is an attempt to give us more for our
money. It gives the majority of students, who
arc not proficient enough in a language to make

possible creditable study in a foreign university,
a chance to gain the advantages of living abroad
without loss in credits or prolongment of gradu
ation.

'He's Been to Germany'
Editor, The Daily:
I sure want my son Cluck to git to go to that
there Stanford School in Germany, and I'm
writ in' to thank you for that fine editorial of
Oct. 23 discouragin' those mature Stanford stu
dents of 18 and 19 frm doin' anything so rash.
Cluck's goin' to have a much belter chance of
git tin' in if everybody else gits out of the runnin'.
He won't mind tourin' round with his Stanford
buddies and git tin' full credit for his work there.
He won't even mind the "watchful eyes of the
dean" I been watchin' him nigh on to 19 years,
and he's real used to it.
When 1 went to school on The Farm, I didn't
git anything set up for me so nice and easy-like,
like Mr. Egger said; so I jist did all my schoolin'
in this here country. That's probably Cluck's
story, too, so please keep on discouragin' every
body you kin, and givin' my Cluck a chance.
I don't know about Cluck's wearin' a button
hisself, but T sure would like to sport a "He's
been to Germany" button!

When 1 went to school on The Farm, I didn't
git anything set up for me so nice and easy-like,
like Mr. Egger said; so I jist did all my schoolin'
in this here country. That's probably Cluck's
story, too, so please keep on discouragin' every
body you kin, and givin' my Cluck a chance.
I don't know about Cluck's wearin' a button
hisself, but T sure would like to sport a "He's

You arc certainly to he complimented for pre
senting Mr. Egger's tine article on the proposed
Slanford-in-Germany plan. Such adverse com
ment is essential to an accurate evaluation of the
project. However, I think that Mr. Egger over
looked several points in his criticism. It is true
mat living in an American community in Europe
floes not offei the best opportunities to learn for
eign ways of life. But to say that the German
plan offers no more than an equivalent two
quarters on 7'he Farm is ridiculous.
In addition to the advantage of a concentrated
and practical introduction to the German lan
guage, the plan provides more opportunities for
social contact than Mr. Egger will admit. The
discussion of a four class-day week, social ex
changes with German universities and freedom
for independent travel at the close of the six
months' study period surely offer far better in
sight into modern German culture than any
course the University could devise here in the
United States.
The Stanford branch in Germany was never
intended to "decrease the price of foreign travel."
lialher it is an attempt to give us more for our
money. It gives the majority of students, who
arc not proficient enough in a language to make

possible creditable study in a foreign university,
a chance to gain the advantages of living abroad
without loss in credits or prolongment of gradu
ation.

I sure want my son Cluck to git to go to that
there Stanford School in Germany, and I'm
writ in' to thank you for that fine editorial of
Oct. 23 discouragin' those mature Stanford stu
dents of 18 and 19 frm doin' anything so rash.
Cluck's goin' to have a much belter chance of
git tin' in if everybody else gits out of the runnin'.
He won't mind tourin' round with his Stanford
buddies and git tin' full credit for his work there.
He won't even mind the "watchful eyes of the
dean" I been watchin' him nigh on to 19 years,
and he's real used to it.
When 1 went to school on The Farm, I didn't
git anything set up for me so nice and easy-like,
