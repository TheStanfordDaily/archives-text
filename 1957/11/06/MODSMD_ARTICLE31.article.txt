The (.'ountrvs Vlosl Tlirilling Football
STANFORD FANS Do not sulk; do not be discouraged because
wo have lost by conversions live times in th<f last 11 games. Dwell,
instead, on the fiict thai you viewers of Stanford football see, game
i/i and game out, the most thrilling football, in the country. Maybe
Stanford lose* more close ones than it wins, but there can be no
denying that a Stanford game is an exciting game.
When the other team is far ahead, the Indian air arm remains a
constant threat for at least one spectacular 1 scoring play. When the
Cards are far ahead, fans bite their nails and panic every time the
opposition gets the ball, for who can forget the Washington State
game? And then there is the average, normal, run-of-the-mill Stan
ford game a cliff-hanger to the last minute.
But lest you think the trend of conversion losses is a recent one j
at Indianville, you are wrong.
In the 20 seasons beginning in 1935 < no football here in 1943-45)
Hie Tribe has been involved in 19 games which were won or lost by
the margin of conversions. Stanford came out on top in only six of
these contests.
This year's conversion-decider to Washington State was certainly
nothing new to the Card-Cougar series. Of the 16 meetings, five
have been decided via the P.A.T. . ..

route and three of the live have
gone to the boys from Pullman.
The records against Oregon
and California are the worst of
all from the Stanford viewpoint.
Oregon clipped SIT by one point
in 1937, 1952 and last week.
We've never repaid the favor.
The Berk e 1 e y Bear s have
achieved conversion victories by
one-, two- and three-point mar
gins; and all three have come in
the last 10 years: 21-18 in '47,
7-0 in '48 and 20-18 in '56. Need
less to say, we've never sent Cal
home cursing their P.A.T. luck.
There is a brighter side to the
conversion picture as it has af
fected tie games. Since 1929, the
Cards have played 10 deadlocks—
and in those 10 battles, there has
n't been a single missed conver
sion. Seven of the games were

0-0 tremenders, but throw them out and there still remain nine
games in which 26 touchdowns have been scored and 26 P.A.T.'s
have been kicked. So, accurate Indian kicking has at least saved
nine losses from showing up on the scoreboard.
We have to go all the way back to 192S before finding a tie game
1 hat Stanford could have won with a successful conversion. That
year, ihe Cards matched Cal, 13-13. But at least the Bears managed
to miss one, too.
A long look back to the days of 1906-1917 when rugby was played
on the Farm finds the Cardinals winning a pair of one-point deci
sions while dropping just one. Of course these just might not have
happened to be conversion losses there are other ways of doing it
in rugby.
And even back as far as 1899—football, again—Stanford was
losing the closies: this one, a 6-5 defeat at the hands of the Olympic
< "111 b.
The overall football and rugby totals on conversion and one-point
defeats? Not quite as bad as they might seem. It happened, believe
it oi not, that in 1926-27, Stanford won three one-pointers and didn't
lose a one. So, the final score on tight ones:
11 VICTORIES FOR STANFORD
15 VICTORIES FOR TIIE OPPONENTS
I lie Longest Score Since "53
A BRIO TIT NOTE ON THE OREGON GAME When .Tori MeMil
lin pulled in a long Jackie Douglas pass for a 73-yard touchdown
play, it marked the longest SU scoring spectacular since 1953. In
Hie USC game of that year, Ron Cook took a screen pass from Bob
Garrett and went 84 yards to the end zone. As The Daily of Nov. 9.
1953, described the play:
"Cook took the ball on the left sidelines, tight-rope walked the
sidelines, took precision advantage of crunching blocks by Norm
Wanoogian and Ernie Dorn, cut to his right, and went the entire
XI yards untouched."
COME JOIN THE BAND Art Rosenbaum wrote a humorous
piece in Monday's Chronicle advising Chuck Taylor to look to the
Stanford band for P.A.T. kickers. Rosenbaum commented that
"Other schools in the past have found extra-point and field goal kick
ers among the ranks of clarinetists and big horn players." Probably
he was thinking of USC's Tommy Walker, a tooter-kicker from sev
eral years back. The upshot of the whole thing is that last night,
ihe following sign appeared at the Stanford band shack:

The records against Oregon
and California are the worst of
all from the Stanford viewpoint.
Oregon clipped SIT by one point
in 1937, 1952 and last week.
We've never repaid the favor.
The Berk e 1 e y Bear s have
achieved conversion victories by
one-, two- and three-point mar
gins; and all three have come in
the last 10 years: 21-18 in '47,
7-0 in '48 and 20-18 in '56. Need
less to say, we've never sent Cal
home cursing their P.A.T. luck.
There is a brighter side to the
conversion picture as it has af
fected tie games. Since 1929, the
Cards have played 10 deadlocks—
and in those 10 battles, there has
n't been a single missed conver
sion. Seven of the games were

0-0 tremenders, but throw them out and there still remain nine
games in which 26 touchdowns have been scored and 26 P.A.T.'s
have been kicked. So, accurate Indian kicking has at least saved
nine losses from showing up on the scoreboard.
We have to go all the way back to 192S before finding a tie game
1 hat Stanford could have won with a successful conversion. That
year, ihe Cards matched Cal, 13-13. But at least the Bears managed
to miss one, too.
A long look back to the days of 1906-1917 when rugby was played
on the Farm finds the Cardinals winning a pair of one-point deci
sions while dropping just one. Of course these just might not have
happened to be conversion losses there are other ways of doing it
in rugby.
And even back as far as 1899—football, again—Stanford was
losing the closies: this one, a 6-5 defeat at the hands of the Olympic
< "111 b.
The overall football and rugby totals on conversion and one-point
defeats? Not quite as bad as they might seem. It happened, believe
it oi not, that in 1926-27, Stanford won three one-pointers and didn't
lose a one. So, the final score on tight ones:
11 VICTORIES FOR STANFORD
15 VICTORIES FOR TIIE OPPONENTS

A BRIO TIT NOTE ON THE OREGON GAME When .Tori MeMil
lin pulled in a long Jackie Douglas pass for a 73-yard touchdown
play, it marked the longest SU scoring spectacular since 1953. In
Hie USC game of that year, Ron Cook took a screen pass from Bob
Garrett and went 84 yards to the end zone. As The Daily of Nov. 9.
1953, described the play:
"Cook took the ball on the left sidelines, tight-rope walked the
sidelines, took precision advantage of crunching blocks by Norm
Wanoogian and Ernie Dorn, cut to his right, and went the entire
XI yards untouched."
COME JOIN THE BAND Art Rosenbaum wrote a humorous
piece in Monday's Chronicle advising Chuck Taylor to look to the
Stanford band for P.A.T. kickers. Rosenbaum commented that
"Other schools in the past have found extra-point and field goal kick
ers among the ranks of clarinetists and big horn players." Probably
he was thinking of USC's Tommy Walker, a tooter-kicker from sev
eral years back. The upshot of the whole thing is that last night,
ihe following sign appeared at the Stanford band shack:

play, it marked the longest SU scoring spectacular since 1953. In
Hie USC game of that year, Ron Cook took a screen pass from Bob
Garrett and went 84 yards to the end zone. As The Daily of Nov. 9.
1953, described the play:
"Cook took the ball on the left sidelines, tight-rope walked the
sidelines, took precision advantage of crunching blocks by Norm
Wanoogian and Ernie Dorn, cut to his right, and went the entire

Wanoogian and Ernie Dorn, cut to his right, and went the entire
XI yards untouched."
COME JOIN THE BAND Art Rosenbaum wrote a humorous
piece in Monday's Chronicle advising Chuck Taylor to look to the
Stanford band for P.A.T. kickers. Rosenbaum commented that
"Other schools in the past have found extra-point and field goal kick
ers among the ranks of clarinetists and big horn players." Probably
he was thinking of USC's Tommy Walker, a tooter-kicker from sev
eral years back. The upshot of the whole thing is that last night,
ihe following sign appeared at the Stanford band shack:
SIGN I P SHEET

FAME AND GI.ORY CAN BE YOURS

sal for short workout. We must be ready in time for the SC Game
this weekend.

Somehow we don't quite think Chuck posted this. But the word
is that the band boys are taking it very seriously, so don't be sur
prised if you hear a few thuds of foot against ball after band prac
-1 ice.
The hand isn't the only bunch who are thinking about the P.A.T.
problem. Yesterday afternoon down on one of the practice fields,
there were two people practicing conversions. They were making a
few of them, too. We'll have to wait a feu vears for them to produce
for Stanford, however each was 11 years rid.
