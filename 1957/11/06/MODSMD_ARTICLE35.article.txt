hurt his throwing hand earlier
this season and has played mainly
at fullback during recent games.
He didn't play during the Trojans'
first five games last year, but,
after replacing the injured Ells
Kissinger, Conroy directed USC
to late-season triumphs over No
tre Dame and UCLA.
Coach Don Clark's T r o j a n s
dropped their first five games be
fore breaking into the win column
last week at the expense of the
University of Washington, 19-12.
The Huskies, incidentally, are now
winless in seven attempts.
Stanford has won four games
and lost three, including a pair of
squeakers to Washington State,
21-18, and Oregon, 27-26. In PCC
action the Indians hold a 2-2 rec
ord, while USC has a 1-3 confer
ence mark.
Best Defense
If Stanford unleashes its fine
passing attack Saturday, it would

not be surprising if USC's No. 1-
ranked PCC pass defense crum
bled and fell at the feet of Tommy
Trojan.
Although the Trojans have held
opponents to an average of only
61.7 yards per game through the
sky lanes, the unvarnished truth
is that USC has met only one
aerial-minded team. Washington
State, with pilot Bob Newman and
co-pilot Bunny Aldrich at the con
trols. WSC tripped the men of
Troy, 13-12.
With ends Joel Freis, Gary Van
Galder, Dick Stein and Ben Robin
son and halfbacks Jeri McMillin
and Taylor on the receiving end
of quarterback Jackie Douglas' of

unpleasant day for the IJSC sec

No Problem
The Indian s' running game
probably will not be stymied by
USC, although the Cardinals may
find more success running to the
outside than through the interior,
where tackles Monte Clark and
Mike Henry and guards Pat Rea
gan and Frank Fiorentino reign.
Opponents have averaged more
than 2-10 yards per game on the
ground against Southern Califor
nia, and Stanford's second-ranking
PCC ground - gobbling machine
led by fullback Chuck Shea and
Harrington has averaged more
than 220 yards ground-wise.

hurt his throwing hand earlier
this season and has played mainly
at fullback during recent games.
He didn't play during the Trojans'
first five games last year, but,
after replacing the injured Ells
Kissinger, Conroy directed USC
to late-season triumphs over No
tre Dame and UCLA.
Coach Don Clark's T r o j a n s
dropped their first five games be
fore breaking into the win column
last week at the expense of the
University of Washington, 19-12.
The Huskies, incidentally, are now
winless in seven attempts.
Stanford has won four games
and lost three, including a pair of
squeakers to Washington State,
21-18, and Oregon, 27-26. In PCC
action the Indians hold a 2-2 rec
ord, while USC has a 1-3 confer
ence mark.
Best Defense
If Stanford unleashes its fine
passing attack Saturday, it would

not be surprising if USC's No. 1-
ranked PCC pass defense crum
bled and fell at the feet of Tommy
Trojan.
Although the Trojans have held
opponents to an average of only
61.7 yards per game through the
sky lanes, the unvarnished truth
is that USC has met only one
aerial-minded team. Washington
State, with pilot Bob Newman and
co-pilot Bunny Aldrich at the con
trols. WSC tripped the men of
Troy, 13-12.
With ends Joel Freis, Gary Van
Galder, Dick Stein and Ben Robin
son and halfbacks Jeri McMillin
and Taylor on the receiving end
of quarterback Jackie Douglas' of
ferings, Saturday coidd prove an
unpleasant day for the IJSC sec
ondary.
No Problem
The Indian s' running game
probably will not be stymied by
USC, although the Cardinals may
find more success running to the
outside than through the interior,
where tackles Monte Clark and
Mike Henry and guards Pat Rea
gan and Frank Fiorentino reign.
Opponents have averaged more
than 2-10 yards per game on the
ground against Southern Califor
nia, and Stanford's second-ranking
PCC ground - gobbling machine
led by fullback Chuck Shea and
Harrington has averaged more
than 220 yards ground-wise.
