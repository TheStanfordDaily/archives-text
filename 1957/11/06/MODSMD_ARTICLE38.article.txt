# DANGER AND A ROPE
## Alpine Club Learns Climbing Methods 
### John Lane 
The Stanford Alpine Club, with
newly qualified members tagging
behind the many expert climbers,
will make its big trip of the year
this week end to Yosemite.
All through the fall quarter the
club has been practicing climbing
techniques and teaching the new
members the tricks of the rather
nerve-racking trade how to find
hand-holds that don't break, how
to develop muscles in finger tips
and how to swing out over the
lips of precipices on ropes, thumb
ing their noses at the danger, to
name some of the more impor
tant.
The club was formed at the end
of World War II by a group of
veterans who had climbed before
and wanted t«> continue. As new
members were added, the club
grew in size. This year it. num
bers about 3."i.

Al a meeting early in the quar
ler, members were shown slides
of a trip taken by some of the
expert members to the Peruvian
Andes.
As well as the Andes, club mem
bers have climbed in such places

as the Teton Range, Glacier Na
tional Park and mountains of the
Northwest. The Yosemite trip af
fords some very good climbing
and is the main trip taken by the
club as a unit.
New members started this year
with the trip to the Twin Peaks
area of San Francisco. There they
were first shown the proper knots
to use when tying on to a safety
rope, how to belay a climber from
above, keeping enough tension on
the rope to keep him from falling
more than a few feet if he loses
his grip and how to "rappelle"
down a sheer cliff face on a rope.
Special Art
The art of rappelling has given
the Stanford campus at least one
moment of frustration.
A few years ago a member of
the club made his way into Hoo
ver Tower at night, belayed a rope
to a support at the top, and rap
pel led down the side, leaving large
black footprints to worry early
morning risers. Some of the rap
pelle "pitches" on which the club
practices compare favorably in
dizziness with the side of Hoover.
As the beginning climber pro
gresses, he is taught how to use
pitons, soft metal hooks driven
into cracks in rock, and "kara
biners," metal rings lo snap into
the pitons. At all limes he must
remember lo keep a safe tautness
to his safety rope.
After learning to use pitons and
karabiners for his own safety, he
learns to use them for complete
support, hanging rope slings from
them, thereby traversing even the
undersides of overhanging cliffs.
Owns Equipment
The club owns such equipment
as tents and ropes for the Yo
semite trips and to loan to club
members for their own trips, but
members must have their own

pitons, piton hammers, karabiners
and, of course, shoes.
Shoes or climbing boots are the
most important articles in a sport
in which a slip in footing can
mean, at least, a nasty fall. Many
members practice in tennis shoes,
but most have their own stout
climbing boots, often of European
manufacture, with heavy, tight
gripping soles.
The club meets on Sundays at
10:30 a.m. during autumn and
spring quarters for the practice
trips, their destinations ranging
from San Francisco and Oakland
to areas on Alpine Road and San
Franeisquito Creek. For winter
quarter the club plans ski-touring
trips to the Sierras.
The club will hold a meeting
tonight in Room 160 on the front
of Quad, at 7:30 p.m. Featured
speaker will be Oil Roberts, Stan
ford Medical School studenl and
member of the 1957 Mount Logan
expedition, who will talk on moun
taineering medicine and first, aid.
Plans for the Yosemite trip will
also be discussed.

Al a meeting early in the quar
ler, members were shown slides
of a trip taken by some of the
expert members to the Peruvian
Andes.
As well as the Andes, club mem
bers have climbed in such places

as the Teton Range, Glacier Na
tional Park and mountains of the
Northwest. The Yosemite trip af
fords some very good climbing
and is the main trip taken by the
club as a unit.
New members started this year
with the trip to the Twin Peaks
area of San Francisco. There they
were first shown the proper knots
to use when tying on to a safety
rope, how to belay a climber from
above, keeping enough tension on
the rope to keep him from falling
more than a few feet if he loses
his grip and how to "rappelle"
down a sheer cliff face on a rope.
Special Art
The art of rappelling has given
the Stanford campus at least one
moment of frustration.
A few years ago a member of
the club made his way into Hoo
ver Tower at night, belayed a rope
to a support at the top, and rap
pel led down the side, leaving large
black footprints to worry early
morning risers. Some of the rap
pelle "pitches" on which the club
practices compare favorably in
dizziness with the side of Hoover.
As the beginning climber pro
gresses, he is taught how to use
pitons, soft metal hooks driven
into cracks in rock, and "kara
biners," metal rings lo snap into
the pitons. At all limes he must
remember lo keep a safe tautness
to his safety rope.
After learning to use pitons and
karabiners for his own safety, he
learns to use them for complete
support, hanging rope slings from
them, thereby traversing even the
undersides of overhanging cliffs.
Owns Equipment
The club owns such equipment
as tents and ropes for the Yo
semite trips and to loan to club
members for their own trips, but
members must have their own

pitons, piton hammers, karabiners
and, of course, shoes.
Shoes or climbing boots are the
most important articles in a sport
in which a slip in footing can
mean, at least, a nasty fall. Many
members practice in tennis shoes,
but most have their own stout
climbing boots, often of European
manufacture, with heavy, tight
gripping soles.
The club meets on Sundays at
10:30 a.m. during autumn and
spring quarters for the practice
trips, their destinations ranging
from San Francisco and Oakland
to areas on Alpine Road and San
Franeisquito Creek. For winter
quarter the club plans ski-touring
trips to the Sierras.
The club will hold a meeting
tonight in Room 160 on the front
of Quad, at 7:30 p.m. Featured
speaker will be Oil Roberts, Stan
ford Medical School studenl and
member of the 1957 Mount Logan
expedition, who will talk on moun
taineering medicine and first, aid.
Plans for the Yosemite trip will
also be discussed.
The Stanford Alpine Club, with
newly qualified members tagging
behind the many expert climbers,
will make its big trip of the year
this week end to Yosemite.
All through the fall quarter the
club has been practicing climbing
techniques and teaching the new
members the tricks of the rather
nerve-racking trade how to find
hand-holds that don't break, how
to develop muscles in finger tips
and how to swing out over the
lips of precipices on ropes, thumb
ing their noses at the danger, to
name some of the more impor
tant.
The club was formed at the end
of World War II by a group of
veterans who had climbed before
and wanted t«> continue. As new
members were added, the club
