# Wisdom Gives Technical Dissertation at Series
## Cambridge Professor Discusses Metaphysics—Justifications, Pitfalls 
### 
John Wisdom, reputed to be one of England's foremost philoso
phers, and a professor at Cambridge University, appeared at last
night's Tuesday Evening Scries program and proceeded to read a
technical and complicated dissertation concerning metaphysics, its
justifications and possible pitfalls.
Wisdom, who is an authority on former colleague and Cambridge

professor Ludwig Wittgenstein's
logical positivism, read excerpts
from his published work entitled
"Paradox and Discovery."
Me summarized his talk with
the following:
'"An application of metaphys
ics to the understanding of puz
■/. Ii n g paradoxical statements
made by explorers in psychology
(Freud), physics (Einstein) and
religion."
He continued to explain that
paradoxical statements are apt
to annoy and confuse one because
they arc a departure from one's
normal practices, conventions
and logic. And recognizing this,
one should tie careful not to re
ject or accept the paradoxical
statement too quickly.
In resolving these apparently
paradoxical statements, which
are in direct conflict with one's
normal range of experiences,
metaphysics steps in and tries to
logically explain the paradox.
And an hour and a half later,
during which metaphysics was
applied to reconcile the contra
dicting statements, he quipped:
"Metaphysical statements are
more often ineffective than harm
ful."
