# Gaillard to Be New Premier
## 
### 
PARIS (/P) I'cfflix Gaillard last
night won approval as France's
2Mb postwar premier.
The victory came on Gaillard's
38th birthday and gives him the
distinction of being the youngest
premier in French Republican
history.
Assembly acceptance of Gail
lard has been virtually certain
since Sunday when Ihe Socialists
and right-wing Independent Re
publicans decided to give him
their votes and to join his gov
ernment.
All parties of the Assembly
had become weary of the cabinet
crisis. It had dragged on for 30
days because of bitter political
squabbling among the deputies.
