# Sputnik II Seen Here; Scientists Get Orbit Data
## Canine Space Traveler Still Lives; Russian Rocket to Moon Possible 
### 
WASHINGTON (A 3 )- Sputnik II was sighted all across the coun
try yesterday, giving scientists the information needed for an accu
rate fix of its orbit around the earth.
The Soviet satellite appeared to be tumbling end over end in its
furious flight at nearly 18,000 miles an hour. This caused renewed

speculation about the fate of Lai
ka, the little Russian dog har
nessed inside.
A late report from Moscow,
based on radio signals received
from the satellite, said Laika was
still alive and in "satisfactory"
condition. At that time Sputnik
II had been up for about four
days. Soviet scientists indicated
several days ago that eccentric
movements of the satellite might
in time cost the dog's life.
Yesterday was the first time
U.S. observers were able to get
a good look at the satellite. They
will get another glimpse today
during three pre - dawn passes,
when optical conditions are best.
Peace Talks
In Moscow, Nikita Khrush
chev, the Communist party chief,
crowcd about his country's re
cent scientific achievements but
spoke of peace.
"Our Sputniks are circling the
world and are waiting for Ameri
can and other Sputniks to appear
and make a commonwealth of
sputniks," he told the Soviet
Union's Parliament.
"Such a commonwealth, such a
competition, would be much bet
ter than competition in the race
to manufacture death - producing
weapons."
There has been speculation
that Russia is sending a rocket to
the moon, but nobody in the West
knows whether the Soviets are
attempting an immediate rocket
hit on the moon. They've been
saying they can do it, and today's
40th anniversary of the Bolshevik
revolution would be an appropri
ate time.
No Guarantee
Of course there's no guarantee
the Russian missile would hit the
moon at a time when it could be
seen. Its launchers could have
timed it to hit during today's
eclipse of the moon, starting at
4:43 a.m. PST.
That would make sense if the
missile carried an atomic war
head. Astronomers say the ex
plosion would light up the dark
ened face of the moon like a
Fourth of July sparkler. The
eclipse won't be seen in this coun
try. however, east of Colorado.
President Eisenhower is to
make a major TV and radio ad
dress to the nation today at 5
p.m. PST on science and security.
The White House indicated the
President did not have any sur
prises to spring in the way of
new scientific progress by this
country.
