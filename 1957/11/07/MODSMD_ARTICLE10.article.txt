# Senator at Poli Union

"While members of the Con
gress can be stampeded into vari
ous causes, (lie Supreme Court
has never lost its sense of pro
portion and has consistently held
that any internal security pro
gram must conform to the Con
stitution."
So said Sen. Thomas I Jennings
Jr. (D-Mo.i before an audience of
some 200 persons at the Political
Union meeting last, night in Cub
berlcy Auditorium.
Hcnnings, defending the Su
preme Court, contended that the
court cannot be wrong in requir
ing that "we live up to the naked
absolutes of the Constitution."
Formidable Barrier
The court has to work in a so
ciety favoring an infallible public
security program, and it is a very
formidable barrier between the
people and the creation ol a po
lice state, Uennings said.
"There must be something to I
transcend party politics," the sen
ator, who is chairman of the Sen
ate Rules Committee, continued.
"It has done no more and no
less than fulfilled its responsibili
ties as set out and limited by the
Constitution. Hy so doing, the leg
islative and executive branches

are required to do the same
thing."
The Supreme Court and other
federal courts hold unusual posi
tions, Senator Uennings added.
The other branches of govern
ment have to report to the peo
ple; they are the mirrors of pub
lic opinion because of their elec
tion. The courts are not respon
sive to outside pressures; their job
is to stand by the law.
Opponents to Court
Opponents of the U.S. Supreme
Court want the destruction of an
independent, judiciary. It is by
this independence that the court
can conform to the Constitution.
The value of the independence is
incalculable, especially with the
threat of Communism, the sena
tor said, again stressing the need
of a guard against an infallible
security program which disre
gards the effect on individual con
stitutional liberties.
Briefly speaking in opposition
to the senator's stand, Lester
O'Shea cited court cases claiming
the court has disregarded the in
tent of law makers and has ig
nored the maintenance of the bal
ance of power.
