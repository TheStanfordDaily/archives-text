## 
### 
Stanford University has re
ceived a $500,000 gift from the
estate of Edward C. Crossett,
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
announced yesterday.
Crossett, a prominent forest
products company executive, was
a resident of Pasadena at the
time of his death in July, 1955.
His will left securities valued
at $500,000 to establish at Stan
ford the Elizabeth Rankin Cros
sett Fund, named in honor of his
wife.
Half the income from the fund
is to provide undergraduate tui
tion scholarships in tho humani
ties, with preference for the first
three in philosophy.
'['he other half will enable
leaves up to one year at full sal
ary for faculty members in the
humanities who, for family or
health reasons, need temporary
relief from the strains of a full
academic schedule.
"This is a most useful gift, and
we appreciate it deeply," com
mented Philip H. Rhinclander,
dean of Stanford's School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
"It provides a way of prevent
ing a man from becoming inca
pacitated before the damage is
done. Mr. Crossett's bequest is
the act of a thoughtful and con
siderate j'M'son, and Stanford is
grateful to him."
