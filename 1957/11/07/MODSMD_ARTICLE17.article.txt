# Needed: A Mid-term Schedule

Faf.RY quarter al about this time Stanford
slarl taking; mid-quarter examinations,
and mail) arc faced with examination schedule
conflicts. Speaking from llie standpoint of the
Khident, it is often a job to prepare for one of
these liO-minute ordeals; hut when a person is
faced with two exams which take place (hiring
the same morning or afternoon, the problem
of preparation becomes extremely difficult.
The School of Humanities and Sciences real
ized that such examination conflicts should be
avoided when they issued a schedule for inid
qnarler one-honr examinations a number of
years ago. Copies of this examination schedule
were distributed to all departments within the
School of Humanities and Sciences, along with
a memorandum requesting that this schedule
be followed so that students would not have
two or more midterms during the same morn
ing or afternoon period.
Some departments have followed the sched
ule, but many others have not, thus continuing
the problem of examination conflicts. Many

students this quarter have complained about
having two or more examinations during the
same morning or afternoon. So long as this
examination schedule has been drawn up, it is
only fair that all instructors follow it. Obvi
ously, it cannot succeed unless this is so.
The mid-term examination schedule for the
School of Humanities and Sciences appears on
this page.
Rut whv limit such a schedule to the School
of Humanities and Sciences? If. say, an engi
neering student had an exam in a course of
fered by a School of Humanities and Sciences
department the same morning that he had one
in an engineering course, the same problem
would arise.
What is needed is a mid-term examination
schedule that would cover all courses in all
schools. Such a schedule would allow students
to plan their study time more effectively and
eliminate the harassment caused by two or
more conflicting examinations.
