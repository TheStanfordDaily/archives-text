Obviously, a Rally Com Man
Editor. The Daily:
We did it! Yes, we smothered the smogmen
and we knocked the out of UCLA. It was a
great, important victory. It was the result of the
"I know I can" attitude instilled in the team and
1he rooting section. The card stunts in the newly
enlarged card section were the best ever seen by
1 his observer, who has seen the best perform
many times. But there were a few too many mis
lakes made by individuals in the section.
The rooters in the section should think ahead
a stunt or two. This would eliminate coming up
with the wrong color or coming up late. He
should listen carefully to the directions and fol
low ihem sharply. When a card is up. the top of
it should be level with the rooter's forehead. Take
1he cards down together. The cards should be
snapped up and down on the count.
A great card section like last week's comes
from a great rooting section. The block red "S"
looked terrific. This week let's drown the Ducks
with a fighting rooting section behind a fighting
1eam.
Some individuals will scorn at the subject of
this letter, saying that rooting, card stunts, fight
ing football teams, etc., are a result of improper
emphasis on an academic atmosphere. This nar
row, stereotyped comment need not be answered
once more. The same people regularly put up
1 his same squawk on this trite old criticism.
The Paleface
Use Axe Yell
Editor, The Daily:
Gone are the days when Stanford rooters knew
how to yell and Stanford cheer leaders knew how
lo lead them. There was once a time when Stan
lord cheering was famous for its fire and enthu
siasm. But contrast the pale performance so far
1 his season- the insipid response of the rooting
section to 1hc equally insipid, inane suggestions

of the cheer leaders to "smother those mothers,"
"ruin the Bruin," "ar-ti-cu-late," etc. Stanford
rooters in recent years have become lazy and in
different. They have grown accU.st.omed to, and
usually give, a colorless, sluggish performance.
Sir, the rooting section on autumn Saturday
afternoons needs new force. And I suggest the
best way to get it is 1o shake the dust off the
Axe Yell, and to use it with regularityâ€”if not
every game, at least when we are playing major
opponents. What is so sacrosanct about that
chant that it is used, if at all, 1) only in "despera
tion" situations or 2) only at the Big Game (also
only in desperation situations)? No wonder it is
a forgotten yell.
Is it heresy to urge that the yell be modified
to allow more frequent use? For instance, let the
rapid-fire chant (the last half of the yell) be used
with frequency throughout each game. Perhaps
a simple "Give 'em [pause] the axe" could spark
each play. An original cheer leader could give us
countless variations.
Let the full veil tall three minutes of it) be
given at least once each game, preferably just
before the kickoff. And, above all, let at least a
modified version of the yell be used when the
team is on the offensive as well as the defensive,
and when we arc one or two touchdowns ahead
of the opponent as well as one or two behind. If,
indeed, the yell possesses some magical power to
save the day on the playing field, better to give
the yell while the team is moving and ahead, and
save the day before it is lost.
If the present-day Stanford rooting is to rise
from its canyon of spiritless mediocrity, we must
revise our thinking about the Axe Yell. Stop
hiding it as if it were a mystic secret weapon.
Let those absurd traditions which too long have
silenced one of the greatest yells in college lore
be discarded forthwith, and let the Stadium each
week resound to the thrilling, thunderous "Give
'em the axe!"
