## Mothers Club Sponsors Benefit for Rest Homes 
### Betty Kantor 
The Mothers Club of Stanford
University will hold its annual
autumn Chrysanthemum Tea this
afternoon from 2 until 4:30 at
Florence Moore Hall on the patio
between Gavilan and Loro. Tick
ets are $1.50 including tax and
may be purchased at the door.
The public is invited.
The Chrysanthemum Tea is
one of two yearly benefits the
Mothers Club sponsors. Funds
also come from an annual Phan
tom Party in the spring, from $1
per year membership dues and
from gifts. With this money, the
club supports both rest homes
on campus. The Women's Rest
Home is directly owned and oper
ated by the club, and it rents the
Men's Rest Home from the Uni
versity.
Also supported by the Mothers
Club are the scholarship and wel
fare committees, which aid indi
vidual students who have emer
gency financial needs, and the
wardrobe committee, which
works with the Family Council in
Stanford Village to provide good
used'clothing for students.
Money left at the end of the
school year is given to the Uni
versity in the form of scholar
ships.
