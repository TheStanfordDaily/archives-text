# Are Card P.A.T.ers Ready? They've Practiced Plenty
## 
### 
If Stanford fails to convert after touchdowns Saturday against the
University of Southern California, it won't be because the Indians
were unprepared.
The Cards opened yesterday's practice with a lengthy session at
the two-yard line with tackles Armand DeWeese and Kyrk Reed

and halfback Jackie Taylor at
tempting the kicks.
DeWeese was the most consist
eni upright splitter of the trio as
the Indians tried to solve the
problem that has cost them two
games this season and three last
year.
A 1 Harrington, ihe big halfback
who usually attempts Stanford's
extra points, look heat treatments
for his sore knees yesterday and
did not participate in the drill. He
was expected to be ready for Sat
urday afternoon's Pacific Coast
Conference tussle with the Tro
jans in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Coach Chuck Taylor had his
third and fourth teams running
USC plays against- the first and
second units, and the "Trojans"
completed several passes in the
non-contact affair.
Meister Speaks
The highlight remark of the
day came during a blocking and
tackling workout for linemen
when assistant coach Hcrm Mei
ster admonished an Indian for
ward:
"Don't hit them easy," he ad
vised. "Those big USC guys will
absorb you." The Trojans average
more than 225 pounds per man
from tackle-to-tackle.
Although USC broke loose for
221 yards r us hi n g last week
against the University of Wash
ington, its T-l'ormation offense
has been inconsistent this season,
and coach Don Clark tried to perk
it up at yesterday's workout in
Los Angeles.
USC's anemic offensive attack
is at the bottom of the PCC's total
offense ladder. The Trojans have
gained only 228 total yards per

| game this season.
None of USC's backs rank
J among the top 15 PCC ball-pack-
I ers, and the leading Trojan pass
er, Tom Maudlin is only ninth
I best among PCC flingers.
Maudlin, a (5-0, 197-pound jun
| ior from North Hollywood, gained
two seasons of junior college ex
perience just a hop, step and
jump from the Stanford campus
at Menlo College.
Impressed Last Spring
He was impressive during USC's
spring practice this year and has
completed 19 of 36 attempts for
205 yards and a 52.8 per cent
mark in six games this season.
Maudlin's favorite receiver has
been halfback Tony Ortega, the
Trojans' most experienced back.
Ortega, who played 325 minutes
last season as a sophomore, has
caught eight passes for 102 yards
this year.
Quarterback Willie Wood has
alternated with Maudlin since
first-string signal-caller Jim Con
roy injured his throwing hand
earlier this season. Conroy has
returned to the lineup at fullback.
Wood is the PCC's 12th leading
passer, with 185 yards gained on
15 completions of 38 throws for a
39.5 per cent efficiency rating and
1 one touchdown.
First-line halfback Rex Johns-
I ton, the Trojans' leading ball-car
| rier, and guard Frank Fiorentino
I missed heavy scrimmage work
yesterday because of ankle inju
ries. Both, however, are expected
to be ready for action Saturday.
The Trojans, who have only 13
lette'rman, are relatively inexperi
enced and have taken their lumps
accordingly this season.

If Stanford fails to convert after touchdowns Saturday against the
University of Southern California, it won't be because the Indians
were unprepared.
The Cards opened yesterday's practice with a lengthy session at
the two-yard line with tackles Armand DeWeese and Kyrk Reed

and halfback Jackie Taylor at
tempting the kicks.
DeWeese was the most consist
eni upright splitter of the trio as
the Indians tried to solve the
problem that has cost them two
games this season and three last
year.

Coach Chuck Taylor had his
third and fourth teams running
USC plays against- the first and

completed several passes in the
non-contact affair.

The highlight remark of the
day came during a blocking and
tackling workout for linemen
when assistant coach Hcrm Mei

"Don't hit them easy," he ad

absorb you." The Trojans average
more than 225 pounds per man

Impressed Last Spring
He was impressive during USC's
spring practice this year and has
completed 19 of 36 attempts for

Maudlin's favorite receiver has
been halfback Tony Ortega, the
Trojans' most experienced back.
Ortega, who played 325 minutes
last season as a sophomore, has
caught eight passes for 102 yards
this year.
Quarterback Willie Wood has
