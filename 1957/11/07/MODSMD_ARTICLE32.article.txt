# C'EST LA VIE
## 'No Privacy’ Says Frenchman 
### Steve Freidberg 
Michel Barret, mounted on his
Vespa, has become a familiar
sight around the campus. This
motorcycle is probably his most
useful possession and takes him
every place he wants to go.
Michel, one of the 10 foreign
scholars at Stanford under ASSU
sponsorship, is from Metz, in the
east of France. However, his fam
ily has lived in many parts of the
country.
He is now living at the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity and is ma
joring in business and economics.
Upon returning to France, he
hopes to go into stock and invest
ment banking.
Michel has had three years of
college at Paris' L'Ecole des
Hautes Etudes Commerciales,
whore he was a member of the
student government and was in
charge of the cultural activities of
the school. He also studied at the
French Lycee in London for one
year.
While at the university in Paris
Michel was taking 23 different
subjects at one time and had 30
hours of classes every week. He
was also giving lessons in mathe
matics, English and Spanish. At
Stanford ho is giving French les
sons to several students.
Oilier Interests
In addition to motorcycling, Mi
chcl likes soccer, horseback rid
ing and swimming. However, he
said ho hasn't had much time for
those sports in the last few years.
"I enjoy life at Stanford very
much," ho commented, "but there
are two difficulties which I have
found. First, there is never any
private life. A person needs to be
alone sometimes.
"A second difficulty is the sys
tem of education. I don't like to
be told what to read for a course.
In France wo may read what we
want. Reading the' same things
does not help to develop individu
ality."
In regard to the current gov
ernment. crisis in France, he said:
"This crisis is one of the most
difficult because of the Algerian
problem. Happily, former finance
minister Felix Gaillard, 37 years
old, has been asked by President
Rene Coty, and has agreed, to
form a new government.
Big Chance
"This is a big chance for France,
whatever her political tendency
is. This man wants to do some
thing for France and is not afraid
of losing his popularity during a
few years by making non-dema
gogic but sane and indispensable
reforms that will prove to be good
later.
While commenting on the eco
i nomic difficulties in his country,
Michel mentioned that the balance
of exports and imports is in a
j dangerous position.
"The deficiency in the balance
i is due to the many dollars we
! must spend to buy oil from the
Middle East," he said. "Gasoline
is one of our big problems. We
depend on it for many things.
"There were harsh restrictions
in France on gasoline during the
| Middle East crisis. There was a
limit of seven gallons per car per
month, and a gallon cost $1 or
! more. Even though gasoline is
still expensive but no longer re
! strictcd, it. does not slow down
! driving. The government just gets
i more money, as 70 per ccnt of the
! price is tax."
It has boon said that the na
j tional sport of France is found in
evading the tax collector, and Mi
j chel admitted this may be par
! lially true.
Must Pay Taxes
"The French people should
know they can't got services from
j the government without: paying
I taxes, and many are boginnning
to realize that now," he pointed
out. "For example, the govern
ment pays SO per cent of all medi
i cal bills and gives social security
which people would have to pay
for themselves otherwise."
In his university Michcl was a
member of a group studying
North African problems, so lie is
well informed about the Algerian
| situation, lie said there are over

500,000 French soldiers stationed
in Algeria and that the fighting
is costing about 1 billion francs
each day, a sum equal to $2 I L»
million.
The French people are separat
ed into two different schools of
thought regarding the Algerian
"war," he mentioned. Some are
for continuing it and others are
for ending it and leaving Algeria.
Those who want to continue
the fighting point out that a mil
lion French people live in Algeria.
Michel observed that these people
have the same feeling toward Al
geria that an American has for
the state he lives in. They are
Frenchmen first, but they are also
Algerians.
Second Reason
A second reason given for
France holding onto Algeria, ac
cording to Michel, is that the peo
ple there are not politically or
ganized as were the Tunisians or
the Moroccans, to whom France
gave independence.
The Algerian rebels not only
fight the French, but they also
light among themselves. If the
French loft, the country would bo
disorganized and the Communists
might step in, he said.
In answer to beliefs that France
takes money from Algeria, ho
said: "Wo always have been
spending money on Algeria. We
are also still giving money to
Tunisia and Morocco."
Michcl indicated he would bo
happy to spoak to any group that
wishes to know more about
France and her problems.
"Thanks to Stanford students,"
ho said, "I have a wonderful op
portunity to know the United
States. I want in return to mako
thorn know about my country, for
a better understanding between
us all."
