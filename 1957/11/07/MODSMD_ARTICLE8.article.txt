## LASSU OK's Larson's Decision; Messinger Uncertain on Successor 
### Joan Woods, Staff Editor 
Ron Larson, elections commission chairman, resigned last night.
Ilis resignation was accepted by Legislature in closed executive
session. No reason was given.
Contacted later by The Daily, Larson said, "Since the elections are
j over, it is an appropriate time to resign. I have had many duties

I with other organizations and have
I taken on more.
"I will not consider my job as
chairman of elections commission
finished until I have presented my
formal report to Legislature and
have given my successor the ben
efit of my experience and knowl
edge."
ASSU president Jim Messinger
said he had several candidates in
mind as Larson's successor, but
that he was as yet undecided
who he would appoint.
Other Action
Elections commission chairman
is appointed by Iho president and
| approved by Legislature.
In other action last night, Leg
islature unanimously approved
I election results. A question on
; legality of the Branner represent
j ative election was resolved after a
' hasty reference to the ASSU by
laws.
Mary Griffing was elected over
Carole Franklin by a vote of 58
j to 57, with one vote invalidated.
Bylaws provide that candidates
may bo elected by plurality vote
in the final election, and the Bran
ner results were then approved in
a separate motion.
Biggest tussle of the evening
occurred over the proposed allo
j cation of $500 to the Institute of
International Relations to bring a
recognized political speaker to the
campus for a week of discussion
on foreign policy during spring
quarter.
lIK Tussle
It was argued that this showed
I favoritism and discriminated un
favorably against other political
organizations on campus. lIR had
requested $1000 for the project.
The administration has unoffi
i daily indicated it would foot the
additional $500.
i Final motion read that Legisla
ture would appropriate the mon
ey to be given "to the president's
j office," the speaker to be "jointly
, sponsored by the University and
| the Associated Students."
In a second motion on the sub
ject, lIR was designated an
"agent" but not a "sponsor" of the
project, so that responsibility for
the setting up and publicizing of
the program would rest with that
organization and not with LASSU.
Dean Acheson
Before the money is allocated,
approval of the speaker by Legis
lature must be obtained. President
Messinger said attempts are being
made to bring former Secretary
of State Dean Acheson to the
campus.
Legislature also:
• Passed unanimously a reso
lution expressing the sorrow of
(the Associated Students at the
passing of Sam McDonald.
• Approved pay increases for
editors and business manager of
the Chaparral.
• Sent back the proposed con
stitution of the Anthropological
Society for clarification and re
wording of inconsistent para
graphs.
• Approved athletic awards.
