### 
Stanford delegates to the Sixth j
National Conference on UNESCO j
in San Francisco last night heard ;
Under-Secretary of State Chris-1
tion A. Herter say, "It is time
we turned east toward Asia to !
listen and learn."
Herter said America has be- j
come great through absorbing j
many cultures from other coun-1
tries.
"However, these cultural infu
sions — or transfusions — have
originated for the most part in |
the West. I think it is time we
turned east," Herter declared.
Representing the Stanford In
stitution of International Rela
tions at the conference, which is
considering "Asia and the United j
States: What the American Citi-!

Zen Can Do to Promote Mutual
Understanding and Cooperation,"
were Craig Barnes, Stu Pollack,
Karen Erickson, Tony Springer,
Jean Ackerman, Jim Morrison,
Serena Auster, Dorothy Heffner
and Joann Fry.
Earlier yesterday, the opening
day of the four-day conclave, the
U.S. National Commission for
UNESCO met and passed a reso
lution urging that UNESCO help
to member states be extended
only where "specific assurances"
are received that the local educa
tional programs it helps "will be
wholly consonant with the de
clared principles and purposes of
UNESCO."
Stanford Research Institute of
ficials will t;ike part in three ses
sions beginning today dealing
dealing with "Economic Relations
in Asian - American Understand-
I ing and Cooperation."
