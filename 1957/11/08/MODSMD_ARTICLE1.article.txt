# Room & Board Follows Trend: $35 Price Hike
## Winbigler Claims No 'Profit' Sought, Just 'Building Up Money Reserves' 
### 
Stanford University will increase board and room rates $35 a
quarter beginning next autumn quarter, Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler announced yesterday.
Except for slight variations depending upon facilities, the basic
quarterly board and room charge for all undergraduate men and

wom en occupying University
housing will increase from $250
to $285. The last boost in rates
was made five years ago.
"The increase is attributable
to the rising costs familiar to all
households," Dean Winbigler
said. "During the current aca
demic year, the University will
lose about $128,000 on its board
and room operation . It is not our
intention to make money on the
residence halls but we must
break even and be able to build
up some reserves for renova
tion."
The actual rate increases per
quarter are as follows:
For graduate and undergradu
ate women, the rate will increase
from $250 to $285.
Men Students
The increases for men students
are broken down according to the
type of accommodations they
have. However, the board rate
will increase uniformly from $165
to $185.
.Room rates for on - campus
men's dormitories will increase
from $100 to $115 for single
rooms and from $85 to $100 for
doubles.
Increases for Stanford Village
men's accommodations will be
from $46 to $55 for triple rooms,
$55 to $65 for doubles and $65 to
$75 for singles.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson. as
istant to President Sterling, said
that part of the planning in the
increase concerns reduction of
the occupancy of University
housing units.
The accepted higher occupancy
which has occurred in the past
allowed the University to retain
its current board and room rates,
he added.
Continuous Increase
However, the continuous in
crease in costs, the necessity of
future remodeling of older units
and the need to offset the deficit
which the University is incurring
this year made the increase in
rates absolutely necessary, Cuth
bertson said. He expressed hope
that the increase would be suffi
cient to last the University for
some time to come.
Dean Winbigler said that Stan
ford's new rate is comparable to
that, of other universities. The
statistics show that Stanford's
rates are lower than many of the
private schools for example,
board and room rates at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
and Vassar now exceed $1000 per
year, and the Mills College rate
is $925.
In June, Stanford announced
that tuition will be increased to
$335 a quarter, also effective
next autumn. Much of the new
income will he applied to in
creases in faculty salaries and in
student aid.
"We shall do our best to see
that no student has to leave
Stanford because of these in
creased costs," Dean Winbigler
said. "Scholarships, loans and
part-time work opportunities will
be made available where needed."

men's dormitories will increase
from $100 to $115 for single
rooms and from $85 to $100 for
doubles.
Increases for Stanford Village
men's accommodations will be
from $46 to $55 for triple rooms,
$55 to $65 for doubles and $65 to
$75 for singles.
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson. as
istant to President Sterling, said
that part of the planning in the
increase concerns reduction of
the occupancy of University
housing units.
The accepted higher occupancy
which has occurred in the past
allowed the University to retain
its current board and room rates,
he added.
Continuous Increase
However, the continuous in
crease in costs, the necessity of
future remodeling of older units
and the need to offset the deficit
which the University is incurring
this year made the increase in
rates absolutely necessary, Cuth
bertson said. He expressed hope
that the increase would be suffi
cient to last the University for
some time to come.
Dean Winbigler said that Stan
ford's new rate is comparable to
that, of other universities. The
statistics show that Stanford's
rates are lower than many of the
private schools for example,
board and room rates at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
and Vassar now exceed $1000 per
year, and the Mills College rate
is $925.
In June, Stanford announced
that tuition will be increased to
$335 a quarter, also effective
next autumn. Much of the new
income will he applied to in
creases in faculty salaries and in
student aid.
"We shall do our best to see
that no student has to leave
Stanford because of these in
creased costs," Dean Winbigler
said. "Scholarships, loans and
part-time work opportunities will
be made available where needed."
Stanford University will increase board and room rates $35 a
quarter beginning next autumn quarter, Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler announced yesterday.
Except for slight variations depending upon facilities, the basic
quarterly board and room charge for all undergraduate men and

wom en occupying University
housing will increase from $250
to $285. The last boost in rates
was made five years ago.
"The increase is attributable
to the rising costs familiar to all
households," Dean Winbigler
said. "During the current aca
demic year, the University will
lose about $128,000 on its board
and room operation . It is not our
intention to make money on the
residence halls but we must
break even and be able to build
up some reserves for renova
tion."
The actual rate increases per
quarter are as follows:
For graduate and undergradu
ate women, the rate will increase
from $250 to $285.
Men Students
The increases for men students
are broken down according to the
type of accommodations they
have. However, the board rate
will increase uniformly from $165
to $185.
.Room rates for on - campus
men's dormitories will increase
from $100 to $115 for single
rooms and from $85 to $100 for
doubles.

$55 to $65 for doubles and $65 to
