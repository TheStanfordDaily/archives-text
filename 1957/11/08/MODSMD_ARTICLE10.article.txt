"Germany 1957" was the sub
ject of a talk by Dr. Peter Her
mes, consul with the German
Consulate in San Francisco, at
the weekly meeting of the lIR in
Bowman Alumni House yester
day afternoon.
Dr. Hermes, who has been in
the foreign service since 19.">."5,
gave a brief outline of the eco
nomic and political outlook in
Germany now. He said that both
situations have been improving
rapidly since 1930, and that the
general prospect for Germany,
economically and socially, is ex
tremely good.
"There are no Communists of
any significance in West Ger
many today," stated the consul,
commenting on the influence of
Communism in Germany. "Fur
thermore. there is no popular
support for Communism in East
Germany."
The German consul said that
the Western government is the
true representative of Germany.
"The partition of my country is
only a reflection of East-West re
lations," he stated. "Prospects of
unity in the near future are not
encouraging. This does not mean

that I lie reunification will never
come, however. The Soviets
could make an acceptable propo
sal for reunifying Germany only
if they change their entire policy
toward the West."
In discussing the recent diplo
matic break with Communist Yu
goslavia. the German representa
tive declared, "We did not try to
punish Tito, we were forced to
take the action we did. . . . Tito
has, on every important issue in
the past, sided with Russia."
Dr. Hermes was most optimis
tic about the recently enacted Eu
ropean Common Market agree
ment. "The signing of the com
mon market treaty is perhaps the
most important economic ad
vancement of our times. . . .
There is hope that it is a step
toward a United States of Eu
rope, a thought which has been
in the minds of some far-sighted
Europeans for a long time," Her
mes said.
The German consul concluded
his afternoon appearance with a
short question and answer ses
sion. Last evening Dr. Hermes
was a dinner guest at Florence
Moore Hall.
