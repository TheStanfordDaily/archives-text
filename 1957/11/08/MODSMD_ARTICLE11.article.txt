# Sputnik II Still Going Strong Smithsonian Scientists Agree
## Reports Satellite Breaking Up Unfounded, Say Researchers Earlier Observers Picked Up Double Signal; Seems Unlikely Dog Will Be Returned Alive 
### 
(Compiled from fth.e Associated Press)
Smithsonian experts said yesterday they do not think the Rus
sians' dog-bearing satellite Sputnik II is breaking up.
At least there arc no definite signs yet, according to Dr. Fred L.
Whipple, director, and Dr. J. Allen Iiynck, associate director ot the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
They were studying reports from observers in Chicago and Tokyo

that the main section of Sputnik
II appeared to be trailing another
object. Radio signals on the sat
ellite's 20-megacycle band indi
cated they might be coming from
two separate radio-equipped ob-1
jects.
Dr. Hynek said he personally i
watched the newest satellite yes- i
terday morning.
"It went right across the star
Mizar in the Big Dipper—it al
most looked like a celestial colli
sion—but I saw no separation,"
Dr. Hynek said.
"Generally wh en something
like that occurs—a splitting of a
satellite — a great many people
would see it. None of the obser
vations today [Thursday] report
ed any more than one object," he
said.
Dog Stays with Sputnik
As for getting the dog back to
earth from the new satellite, the
two scientists agreed that would
be quite an accomplishment.
Von R. Eshleman. research as
sociate at Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, said that nothing
unusual had been observed here
as of yesterday afternoon.
He added that it is quite com
mon for several pieces of the sat
ellite to come loose and trail the
main section. The nose cone
trailed Sputnik I for several days,
he said.
Eshleman discounted the the
ory that the gradual disintegra
tion of the rocket may be a pre
lude to an attempt to bring the
female dog, Laika, down alive.
Such a step, ho predicted, is too
difficult for the Russians to at
tempt at their present stage of
development but it is entirely
possible they will attempt it "at
some future date."
Sky Observers
U.S. sky observers redoubled
their vigilance on the chance that
the Russians might try for some
thing spectacular in honor of the
40th anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution.
The two favorite pieces of
speculation were:
• That an attempt might be
made to eject from the satellite
the container carrying Laika, the
famous space dog. It would be a
great feat to bring the animal
back to earth alive for scientific
study.
• That the Russians might
take a shot at the moon. Soviet
scientists have said a rocket to
the moon is one of the projects
they have in the works.
Sputnik II was estimated to
have been only about 150 miles
high on its flights over the Unit
ed States yesterday. Rising and
falling in brilliance, its color was
variously described as bluish
white, pinkish, ruddy and even
red.

Smithsonian experts said yesterday they do not think the Rus
sians' dog-bearing satellite Sputnik II is breaking up.
At least there arc no definite signs yet, according to Dr. Fred L.
Whipple, director, and Dr. J. Allen Iiynck, associate director ot the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
They were studying reports from observers in Chicago and Tokyo

that the main section of Sputnik
II appeared to be trailing another
object. Radio signals on the sat
ellite's 20-megacycle band indi
cated they might be coming from
two separate radio-equipped ob-1
jects.
Dr. Hynek said he personally i
watched the newest satellite yes- i
terday morning.
"It went right across the star
Mizar in the Big Dipper—it al
most looked like a celestial colli
sion—but I saw no separation,"
Dr. Hynek said.
"Generally wh en something
like that occurs—a splitting of a
satellite — a great many people
would see it. None of the obser
vations today [Thursday] report
ed any more than one object," he
said.
Dog Stays with Sputnik
As for getting the dog back to
earth from the new satellite, the
two scientists agreed that would
be quite an accomplishment.
Von R. Eshleman. research as
sociate at Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, said that nothing
unusual had been observed here
as of yesterday afternoon.
He added that it is quite com
mon for several pieces of the sat
ellite to come loose and trail the
main section. The nose cone
trailed Sputnik I for several days,
he said.
Eshleman discounted the the
ory that the gradual disintegra
tion of the rocket may be a pre
lude to an attempt to bring the
female dog, Laika, down alive.
Such a step, ho predicted, is too
difficult for the Russians to at
tempt at their present stage of
development but it is entirely
possible they will attempt it "at
some future date."
Sky Observers
U.S. sky observers redoubled
their vigilance on the chance that
the Russians might try for some
thing spectacular in honor of the
40th anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution.
The two favorite pieces of
speculation were:
• That an attempt might be
made to eject from the satellite
the container carrying Laika, the
famous space dog. It would be a
great feat to bring the animal
back to earth alive for scientific
study.
• That the Russians might
take a shot at the moon. Soviet
scientists have said a rocket to
the moon is one of the projects
they have in the works.
Sputnik II was estimated to
have been only about 150 miles
high on its flights over the Unit
ed States yesterday. Rising and
falling in brilliance, its color was
variously described as bluish
white, pinkish, ruddy and even
red.
