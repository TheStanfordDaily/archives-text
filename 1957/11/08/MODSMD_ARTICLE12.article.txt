# Sophs to Continue Sun. Coffee Mixers
## 
### 
"Coffee Mixers," Sunday night
socials held from 9:30 to mid
night in the Nitery, will continue
throughout the academic year.
These socials are sponsored by
the sophomore class and are un
der the approval of the ASSU.
Featured at the coffee mixers
are coffee, doughnuts, a fire,
dance records and an informal
atmosphere. Pat Curley, chair
man of the event, urges all stu
dents to drop by, stag or drag,
after the Flicks or for a study
break.
