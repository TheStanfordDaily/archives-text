WASHINGTON (£>)—President
Eisenhower, acknowledging thai:
surging Russian power could
"damage us seriously" if war
came, last night named a scien
tific chief of staff to rush devel
opment of the weapons of the
future.
He appointed Dr. James R. Kil
lian, president of the world - fa
mous Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, to take command.
Killian, 55-year-old scientist
and administrator with a record
of government service, was em
powered to crack down on any in
ter - service rivalry, to prevent
needless delays and to give high
priority to certain hush-hush
projects the President only hint
ed at.
"It is my conviction," Eisen
hower said, "supported by trust
ed scientific and military advis
ers, that, although the Soviets ai e
quite likely ahead in some mis
sile and special areas, and are
obviously ahead of us in satellite
development, as of today the
over-all military strength of the
free world is distinctly greater
than that of the Communist coun
tries.
"We must see to it that what
ever advantages they have arc
temporary only."
