Silencing of Opinions
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Carr's letter on the Williamson case in
advertently exposes what I consider to be a pri
mary objection to the silencing of any opinion.
The advocacy of the overthrow of our govern
ment —and hence, presumably, Ihe silencing of
all opinion—should, if I understand Mr. Carr cor
rectly, never be expressed or reported in any pub
lication on a campus dedicated to the principles
of freedom.
But did Mr. Williamson advocate overthrow of
Ihe government? Mr. Carr ihinks so, in that the
difference between Mr. Williamson's position and
Hint of the Communist party is solely a matter
of degree. Could we not be led, by such an argu
ment, to condemn, step by step, any criticism of
our economic system, the advocacy of socialized
medicine, fluoridization ("mass medication")—in
short, any opinion with which we disagree—on
Hie ground that it differs from Ihe frank advo
cacy of violent overthrow of our government, or
1 he "Communist Party Line," only in degree?
Surely, if there is an opinion which we are not
free to express, any other opinion can be sup
pressed by linking it to the condemned opinion
• e.g., Communism > if only as a matter of degree.
I maintain that it is incompatible with the prin
ciple of freedom of expression to silence any
opinion, even the opinion lhat it should be ex
pressed. We cannot have much faith in the "bold
and intelligent minds" who will be tomorrow's
loaders if we are afraid that they would be con
vinced by those who wish to overthrow our gov
ernment. if they ever were allowed to be heard.
We cannot produce bold and intelligent minds by
using the censorship which dictatorships use to
conceal the truth from their subjects.
rf our form of government is desirable, we do
71 ot need to suppress criticism of it in a college
community. In short, in a community of respon
sible and intelligent individuals who will be to
morrow's leaders, the best way of guaranteeing
Hie continuance of the idea of freedom is to re
main true to its principles, and to defend it by
ihe method of free discussion which we ourselves
affirm.
The strength of a free society is and always
has been in its freedom and in the extent to
which the people and their leaders are well in
11timed and intelligent. This, rather than the
silencing of opinions which are or are thought to
be antagonistic to our ideals, is our greatest
security.

Collaboration With the Enemy
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Williamson's trip to Russia and China cer
tainly cannot be considered anything short of col
laboration With the enemy. And the student who
characterized The Daily, in its publication of Wil
liamson's articles, as "The Stanford Daily Work
er" was more than accurate. The Daily's policy
of continuing to publish letter after letter rele
vant to the Williamson articles is just further
testimony of its insidious desire to keep the whole
matter before the public. If The Daily had only
"refused to recognize" that one of its students
had even made this trip, none of us would know
that it had taken place! (Our State Department
has exemplified this technique; we should take
note.)
Although publication of Williamson's articles
has brought out many sound criticisms of his
action, it has also reflected attitudes in this col
umn that seem to actually approve of his conduct.
This is in direct conflicl with State Department
policy. In order to preserve the existing una
nimity of American support toward all aspects
of our present foreign policy, this should not be
tolerated.
I salute William Hosier, who in his recent letter
In this column endorsed Ihe analogy between Wil

liamson's trip and Governor Faubus' action. s ? in
Lit lie Rock. I only wish Mr. Hosier and I were
in a position to call out troops to prevent any
further such publication by The Daily or speeches
by Mr. Williamson and his advocates.

Library Steam Pipes
Editor, The Daily:
The paternal arm of Stanford University has
now extended itself warmly about the Main
Library, moistening the brow of many a once
aspiring, now perspiring student. In a seeming
effort to forestall an epidemic of Asian flu, the
steam pipes in this great center of knowledge
have been pressed into overtime service. During
California's warm autumn weather, young biblio
philes must push their way past clanking radia
tors into the humid, tropical atmosphere of the
Reserve Book Room, Humanities or Social Sci
ences Room, and on into the muggy stacks in the
quest for relief.
At any rate, the heat would be unbearable if it
were not for the patently humorous sight of doors
and windows flung open to allow the warm air
outside to mix with the steam inside. Since the
University has seen fit to spend thousands of
.sorely-needed dollars in lighting, painting and re
decorating its Library, is it not possible to have
the heating system regulated relative to existing
weather conditions, instead of the absolute stand
ards of heat requisite to the raising of flourishing
hothouse plants and, apparently, healthy libra
rians?

Answer the Phone
Editor, The Daily:
I'm writing this letter while I wait for someone
to answer the phone at Flo Mo. I have noticed
that the service at the women's dorms this year
is very inferior to that of past, years. Almost any
fraternity or women's Row house will answer the
phone within two or three rings. When the dorms
are paying people to do the job, you would think
they could do as well as a fraternity.
They still haven't answered.

Read With Dismay
J
Editor, The Daily:
It was with dismay that I read the letter by the
bewildered freshman girl. I am also a freshman,
but I don't think she has a very mature view
point. Obviously she has been reared in a very
sheltered manner.
Stanford is a school of supposedly mature men
and women, and Miss "Tatt letale" certainly hasn't
a very mature outlook. She is ready to accept the
dating activities here at Stanford but is not will
ing to accept an equally traditional part of college
life—drinking.
I personally see nothing wrong with social
drinking among young people. It has always
been done and always will be. I like to drink,
myself, and see nothing wrong with it if it does
not get out of hand. Freshmen should be content
with tradition and not try to rewrite the social
code the first month.

Outstanding Presentation
Editor, The Daily:
Wp wish to take this opportunity to lhank the
ASSU and Flick Com for their outstanding pres
entation in Memorial Auditorium Sunday night.
"The Wild Party" was an unusually vivid repre
sentation of Americans at work and play. This
epical, historical, documentary, realistic, hypo
thetical, sociological, psychosomatic drama is a
valuable contribution to our lives as students.
It kinda makes you stop and think.

Answer the Phone
Editor, The Daily:
I'm writing this letter while I wait for someone
to answer the phone at Flo Mo. I have noticed
that the service at the women's dorms this year
is very inferior to that of past, years. Almost any
fraternity or women's Row house will answer the
phone within two or three rings. When the dorms
are paying people to do the job, you would think
they could do as well as a fraternity.
They still haven't answered.

Editor, The Daily:
It was with dismay that I read the letter by the
bewildered freshman girl. I am also a freshman,
but I don't think she has a very mature view
point. Obviously she has been reared in a very
sheltered manner.
Stanford is a school of supposedly mature men
and women, and Miss "Tatt letale" certainly hasn't
a very mature outlook. She is ready to accept the
dating activities here at Stanford but is not will
ing to accept an equally traditional part of college
life—drinking.
I personally see nothing wrong with social
drinking among young people. It has always
been done and always will be. I like to drink,
myself, and see nothing wrong with it if it does
not get out of hand. Freshmen should be content
with tradition and not try to rewrite the social
code the first month.

Silencing of Opinions
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Carr's letter on the Williamson case in
advertently exposes what I consider to be a pri
mary objection to the silencing of any opinion.
The advocacy of the overthrow of our govern
ment —and hence, presumably, Ihe silencing of
all opinion—should, if I understand Mr. Carr cor
rectly, never be expressed or reported in any pub
lication on a campus dedicated to the principles
of freedom.
But did Mr. Williamson advocate overthrow of
Ihe government? Mr. Carr ihinks so, in that the
difference between Mr. Williamson's position and
Hint of the Communist party is solely a matter
of degree. Could we not be led, by such an argu
ment, to condemn, step by step, any criticism of
our economic system, the advocacy of socialized
medicine, fluoridization ("mass medication")—in
short, any opinion with which we disagree—on
Hie ground that it differs from Ihe frank advo
cacy of violent overthrow of our government, or
1 he "Communist Party Line," only in degree?
Surely, if there is an opinion which we are not
free to express, any other opinion can be sup
pressed by linking it to the condemned opinion
• e.g., Communism > if only as a matter of degree.
I maintain that it is incompatible with the prin
ciple of freedom of expression to silence any
opinion, even the opinion lhat it should be ex
pressed. We cannot have much faith in the "bold
and intelligent minds" who will be tomorrow's
loaders if we are afraid that they would be con
vinced by those who wish to overthrow our gov
ernment. if they ever were allowed to be heard.
We cannot produce bold and intelligent minds by
using the censorship which dictatorships use to
conceal the truth from their subjects.
rf our form of government is desirable, we do
71 ot need to suppress criticism of it in a college
community. In short, in a community of respon
sible and intelligent individuals who will be to
morrow's leaders, the best way of guaranteeing
Hie continuance of the idea of freedom is to re
main true to its principles, and to defend it by
ihe method of free discussion which we ourselves
affirm.
The strength of a free society is and always
has been in its freedom and in the extent to
which the people and their leaders are well in
11timed and intelligent. This, rather than the
silencing of opinions which are or are thought to
be antagonistic to our ideals, is our greatest
security.

Mr. Williamson's trip to Russia and China cer
tainly cannot be considered anything short of col
laboration With the enemy. And the student who
characterized The Daily, in its publication of Wil
liamson's articles, as "The Stanford Daily Work
er" was more than accurate. The Daily's policy
of continuing to publish letter after letter rele
vant to the Williamson articles is just further
testimony of its insidious desire to keep the whole
matter before the public. If The Daily had only
"refused to recognize" that one of its students
had even made this trip, none of us would know
that it had taken place! (Our State Department
has exemplified this technique; we should take
note.)
Although publication of Williamson's articles
has brought out many sound criticisms of his
action, it has also reflected attitudes in this col
umn that seem to actually approve of his conduct.
This is in direct conflicl with State Department
policy. In order to preserve the existing una
nimity of American support toward all aspects
of our present foreign policy, this should not be
tolerated.

Mr. Williamson's trip to Russia and China cer
tainly cannot be considered anything short of col
laboration With the enemy. And the student who
characterized The Daily, in its publication of Wil
liamson's articles, as "The Stanford Daily Work
er" was more than accurate. The Daily's policy
of continuing to publish letter after letter rele
vant to the Williamson articles is just further
testimony of its insidious desire to keep the whole
matter before the public. If The Daily had only
"refused to recognize" that one of its students
had even made this trip, none of us would know
that it had taken place! (Our State Department
has exemplified this technique; we should take
note.)
Although publication of Williamson's articles
has brought out many sound criticisms of his
action, it has also reflected attitudes in this col
umn that seem to actually approve of his conduct.
This is in direct conflicl with State Department
policy. In order to preserve the existing una
nimity of American support toward all aspects
of our present foreign policy, this should not be
tolerated.

Library Steam Pipes
Editor, The Daily:
The paternal arm of Stanford University has
now extended itself warmly about the Main
Library, moistening the brow of many a once
aspiring, now perspiring student. In a seeming
effort to forestall an epidemic of Asian flu, the
steam pipes in this great center of knowledge
have been pressed into overtime service. During
California's warm autumn weather, young biblio
philes must push their way past clanking radia
tors into the humid, tropical atmosphere of the
Reserve Book Room, Humanities or Social Sci
ences Room, and on into the muggy stacks in the
quest for relief.
At any rate, the heat would be unbearable if it
were not for the patently humorous sight of doors
and windows flung open to allow the warm air
outside to mix with the steam inside. Since the
University has seen fit to spend thousands of
.sorely-needed dollars in lighting, painting and re
decorating its Library, is it not possible to have
the heating system regulated relative to existing
weather conditions, instead of the absolute stand
ards of heat requisite to the raising of flourishing
hothouse plants and, apparently, healthy libra
rians?

I'm writing this letter while I wait for someone
to answer the phone at Flo Mo. I have noticed
that the service at the women's dorms this year
is very inferior to that of past, years. Almost any

phone within two or three rings. When the dorms

they could do as well as a fraternity.

Editor, The Daily:
It was with dismay that I read the letter by the
bewildered freshman girl. I am also a freshman,
but I don't think she has a very mature view
point. Obviously she has been reared in a very
sheltered manner.
Stanford is a school of supposedly mature men
and women, and Miss "Tatt letale" certainly hasn't
a very mature outlook. She is ready to accept the
dating activities here at Stanford but is not will
ing to accept an equally traditional part of college
life—drinking.
I personally see nothing wrong with social
drinking among young people. It has always
been done and always will be. I like to drink,
myself, and see nothing wrong with it if it does
not get out of hand. Freshmen should be content
with tradition and not try to rewrite the social
code the first month.

Silencing of Opinions
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Carr's letter on the Williamson case in
advertently exposes what I consider to be a pri
mary objection to the silencing of any opinion.
The advocacy of the overthrow of our govern
ment —and hence, presumably, Ihe silencing of
all opinion—should, if I understand Mr. Carr cor
rectly, never be expressed or reported in any pub
lication on a campus dedicated to the principles
of freedom.
But did Mr. Williamson advocate overthrow of
Ihe government? Mr. Carr ihinks so, in that the
difference between Mr. Williamson's position and
Hint of the Communist party is solely a matter
of degree. Could we not be led, by such an argu
ment, to condemn, step by step, any criticism of
our economic system, the advocacy of socialized
medicine, fluoridization ("mass medication")—in
short, any opinion with which we disagree—on
Hie ground that it differs from Ihe frank advo
cacy of violent overthrow of our government, or
1 he "Communist Party Line," only in degree?
Surely, if there is an opinion which we are not
free to express, any other opinion can be sup
pressed by linking it to the condemned opinion
• e.g., Communism > if only as a matter of degree.
I maintain that it is incompatible with the prin
ciple of freedom of expression to silence any
opinion, even the opinion lhat it should be ex
pressed. We cannot have much faith in the "bold
and intelligent minds" who will be tomorrow's

bewildered freshman girl. I am also a freshman,
but I don't think she has a very mature view
point. Obviously she has been reared in a very
sheltered manner.
Stanford is a school of supposedly mature men
and women, and Miss "Tatt letale" certainly hasn't
a very mature outlook. She is ready to accept the
dating activities here at Stanford but is not will
ing to accept an equally traditional part of college
life—drinking.
I personally see nothing wrong with social
drinking among young people. It has always
been done and always will be. I like to drink,
myself, and see nothing wrong with it if it does
not get out of hand. Freshmen should be content
with tradition and not try to rewrite the social
code the first month.

Outstanding Presentation
Editor, The Daily:
Wp wish to take this opportunity to lhank the
ASSU and Flick Com for their outstanding pres
entation in Memorial Auditorium Sunday night.
"The Wild Party" was an unusually vivid repre
sentation of Americans at work and play. This
epical, historical, documentary, realistic, hypo
thetical, sociological, psychosomatic drama is a
valuable contribution to our lives as students.
It kinda makes you stop and think.

Silencing of Opinions
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Carr's letter on the Williamson case in
advertently exposes what I consider to be a pri
mary objection to the silencing of any opinion.
The advocacy of the overthrow of our govern
ment —and hence, presumably, Ihe silencing of
all opinion—should, if I understand Mr. Carr cor
rectly, never be expressed or reported in any pub
lication on a campus dedicated to the principles
of freedom.
But did Mr. Williamson advocate overthrow of
Ihe government? Mr. Carr ihinks so, in that the
difference between Mr. Williamson's position and
Hint of the Communist party is solely a matter
of degree. Could we not be led, by such an argu
ment, to condemn, step by step, any criticism of
our economic system, the advocacy of socialized
medicine, fluoridization ("mass medication")—in
short, any opinion with which we disagree—on
Hie ground that it differs from Ihe frank advo
cacy of violent overthrow of our government, or
1 he "Communist Party Line," only in degree?
Surely, if there is an opinion which we are not
free to express, any other opinion can be sup
pressed by linking it to the condemned opinion
• e.g., Communism > if only as a matter of degree.
I maintain that it is incompatible with the prin
ciple of freedom of expression to silence any
opinion, even the opinion lhat it should be ex
pressed. We cannot have much faith in the "bold
and intelligent minds" who will be tomorrow's
loaders if we are afraid that they would be con
vinced by those who wish to overthrow our gov
ernment. if they ever were allowed to be heard.
We cannot produce bold and intelligent minds by
using the censorship which dictatorships use to
conceal the truth from their subjects.
rf our form of government is desirable, we do
71 ot need to suppress criticism of it in a college
community. In short, in a community of respon
sible and intelligent individuals who will be to
morrow's leaders, the best way of guaranteeing
Hie continuance of the idea of freedom is to re
main true to its principles, and to defend it by
ihe method of free discussion which we ourselves
affirm.
The strength of a free society is and always
has been in its freedom and in the extent to
which the people and their leaders are well in
11timed and intelligent. This, rather than the
silencing of opinions which are or are thought to
be antagonistic to our ideals, is our greatest
security.

Collaboration With the Enemy
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Williamson's trip to Russia and China cer
tainly cannot be considered anything short of col
laboration With the enemy. And the student who
characterized The Daily, in its publication of Wil
liamson's articles, as "The Stanford Daily Work
er" was more than accurate. The Daily's policy
of continuing to publish letter after letter rele
vant to the Williamson articles is just further
testimony of its insidious desire to keep the whole
matter before the public. If The Daily had only
"refused to recognize" that one of its students
had even made this trip, none of us would know
that it had taken place! (Our State Department
has exemplified this technique; we should take
note.)
Although publication of Williamson's articles
has brought out many sound criticisms of his
action, it has also reflected attitudes in this col
umn that seem to actually approve of his conduct.
This is in direct conflicl with State Department
policy. In order to preserve the existing una
nimity of American support toward all aspects
of our present foreign policy, this should not be
tolerated.
I salute William Hosier, who in his recent letter
In this column endorsed Ihe analogy between Wil

liamson's trip and Governor Faubus' action. s ? in
Lit lie Rock. I only wish Mr. Hosier and I were
in a position to call out troops to prevent any
further such publication by The Daily or speeches
by Mr. Williamson and his advocates.

Library Steam Pipes
Editor, The Daily:
The paternal arm of Stanford University has
now extended itself warmly about the Main
Library, moistening the brow of many a once
aspiring, now perspiring student. In a seeming
effort to forestall an epidemic of Asian flu, the
steam pipes in this great center of knowledge
have been pressed into overtime service. During
California's warm autumn weather, young biblio
philes must push their way past clanking radia
tors into the humid, tropical atmosphere of the
Reserve Book Room, Humanities or Social Sci
ences Room, and on into the muggy stacks in the
quest for relief.
At any rate, the heat would be unbearable if it
were not for the patently humorous sight of doors
and windows flung open to allow the warm air
outside to mix with the steam inside. Since the
University has seen fit to spend thousands of
.sorely-needed dollars in lighting, painting and re
decorating its Library, is it not possible to have
the heating system regulated relative to existing
weather conditions, instead of the absolute stand
ards of heat requisite to the raising of flourishing
hothouse plants and, apparently, healthy libra
rians?

Answer the Phone
Editor, The Daily:
I'm writing this letter while I wait for someone
to answer the phone at Flo Mo. I have noticed
that the service at the women's dorms this year
is very inferior to that of past, years. Almost any
fraternity or women's Row house will answer the
phone within two or three rings. When the dorms
are paying people to do the job, you would think
they could do as well as a fraternity.
They still haven't answered.
