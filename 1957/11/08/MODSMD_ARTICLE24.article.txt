Jousting Over Aid
A great deal of the heaviest scrimmaging on "Go-South" week
ends traditionally occurs before and/or after the actual game. This
is the verbal jousting which is so much a part of pre-game warm-up
and post-game parties.
Time was when it was more than fashionable to spend time be
tween sips telling tales about footballers who wound clocks to keep
their Cadillacs in petrol and their ladies in booze.
But that day is gone.
Our southern cousins were always wont to divulge just how well
Ihey took care of their "boys," e.g., the monthly "fast forty" and
free clothing deals.
And no loyal northern Californian would be outdone in this cock
tail hour variation of "Can You Top This?"
It cannot be denied that many of these tales had at least some
factual basis.
One doesn't have to go too far back into athletic history on this
campus to find tackles and ends holding lucrative campus represen
tative jobs and other off-campus work, which often enough featured
set pay on ;i work-when-you-can basis.
Most of these practices were curtailed in line with a conference
mandate in 1954.
Based on fact or not, conversations on the subject tended toward
exaggeration if not pure fantasy. The footballers could never have
guessed they haft it so good.
In the interest of more informed conversation and universal un
derstanding this weekend and in the future we offer the follow
ing information concerning the athletic work program at Stanford
today.
following last year's PCC upheaval (penalties, cries of indigna
-1 ion and buck passing of a different sort), the conference adopted a
standard policy for athletic financial assistance at member schools.
Included are provisions for a $4-per-hour maximum wage for
work done during the competitive season and a $2 off-season rate.
A $100 limit is set 'for earnings in any one month.
The universities are no longer allowed to solicit off-campus jobs
for iheir alhletes.
Clmck Taylor has limited his job offers to footballers this year
to three general categories: hashing, janitorial work in either the
HAC building or in Encina Gym, or grounds work through the BAC
corporation yard.
Remuneration is offered in meals for hashing and $2 per hour
for janitorial or grounds work, BOTH IN AND OUT OF SEASON.
University officials do not feel the $4 rate is in consonance with the
over-all student work-aid program, in which $1.25 is the normal
hourly wage.
Student-athletes are free to line up their own off-campus employ
ment, but those who do may not participate in the University's pro
gram. Only two varsity footballers have taken the off-campus option
in preference to the $2 on-campus rate.
If, in the verbal scrimmaging which is sure to develop this week
end, conversation sweeps to athletes and financial aid, why not see
if you can "turn it in" to a discussion of the merits of the present
program instead of the one based on imagined excesses.
Otherwise your story may be too easy to top.
