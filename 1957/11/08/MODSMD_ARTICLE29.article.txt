# PAPOOSES HIGH
## Freshmen Entertain Brubabes Tomorrow 
### Alan Miller 
Stanford frosh footballers will seek their first victory.of the sea
son over an evenly-matched UCLA squad tomorrow at Stanford
Stadium. Kick-off time is 2 p.m. and admission is free.
Coach Bob Ghilotti's Papooses have been going through rough
practices this week with stress on basic fundamentals after their

28-6 defeat by IJSC last Friday.
"Last week's game and recent
practices have taught the boys
what real college football isâ€”
I with its aggressive defense and
hard tackling," explained Ghi
i lotti.
The team is in fine shape for
this contest. Fullback Gil Dowd
and halfback Chris Knott have
improved considerably and
should be good ground gainers
for Stanford. Tom Clark and
John Butler have consistently
been showing more ability in
their backfield positions.
Papoose Sparklers
Linebackers Bob Atkinson and
! Dick Hearney and center Art
Speigel should spark the defense,
| while quarterbacks Dennis
Haoux and Rod Sears will run
the ball club.
Right end Bill Cooper will be
on the bench due to a knee in
jury sustained last week. He will
be replaced by George Honore,
back from sick leave.
UCLA boasts a strong eleven
and uses the single wing as does
the varsity. They strike hard
with reverses and pose a defen
| sive problem for Stanford. The
| Brubabes were dumped 34-0 by
| California last week and are de-
I termined to beat the Papooses.
Moore Leads UCLA
Their running and passing is
vested in Dean Moore, a big full
back and tailback from Redondo
Beach. Bob Zingler. another of
their fine runners, will be
watched closely.
"If we put up a good defense
performance against UCLA's sin
gle wing and are able to move the
ball on the ground, we should
! win," says Ghilotti.

If Stanford beats' UCLA, and
Cal defeats.USC tomorrow, the
Papooses can still be in the fight
for top spot in the Pacific Coast
conference freshman fool ball
race.
