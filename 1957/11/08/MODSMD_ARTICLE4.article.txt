# Group Placed On Probation For Shrinking
## Council Says Violation Occurred in Breaking Law, Not in Drinking 
### 
The Judicial Council recently
ruled on a Fundamental Standard
violation concerning a mixed
group of 12 Stanford students, all
minors, who had been reported by
the county sheriff's office for
drinking beer on a public beach.
The sheriff's report did not say
that the students were guilty of
disorderly conduct but only of
drinking illegally.
The dozen students had pur
chased 36 cans of beer for the
party, and, according to the sher
iff, 21 cans were unopened when
the party was investigated. Ap
parently no liquor had been con
sumed before the students got to
the beach.
A Stanford student, over 21. had
purchased the beer for the minors
as a favor. He did not attend the
party.
Women Students
The Judicial Council found that
several of the women students in
volved had not been drinking the
beer and that ihey had not known
that beer would be served when
they agreed to go to the party.
These students had pleaded not
guilty, and the council acquitted
them.
All of the other students, except
one, admitted drinking and plead
ed guilty to a Fundamental Stand
ard violation. These were found
guilty and placed on probation
until the end of the quarter.
One student admitted drinking
but did not plead guilty to a Fun
damental Standard violation on
the grounds that drinking was not
a violation of the Standard.
Although some members of the
council felt that this student was
guilty of drinking, and should be
punished, Ihey did not feel that a
Fundamental Standard violation
was involved.
No Violation
But the council finally decided
that, although drinking itself is
not a violation of the Standard,
breaking the law is. Therefore,
the student was found guilty and
placed on probation with the oth
ers who had pleaded guilty.
The adult student who bought
the beer was found guilty of a
Fundamental Standard violation
and was also placed on probation
until the end of this quarter.
If any of these students had
been convicted in a regular state
court of breaking the liquor laws
by drinking in a public place
while minors, or by purchasing
liquor for minors, they would
have been subject to $500 fines
and/or six months in jail.
However, the sheriffs' office, in
referring the case to Stanford,
gave the University complete jur
isdiction.
