for the respondent, was declared

the sixth annual Marion Rice
Kirkwood moot court finals in
the Law School. Second place

sel for the respondent.
The court's decision was handed
down by the Hon. Raymond E.
Peters, presiding justice of the

fornia; the Hon. Murray Draper,
associate justice of the District
Court of Appeal of California; and
the Hon. Frederick G. Hamley,
judge, U.S. Court of Appeal for

In making their decision the
presiding judges considered, not
the merits of the case, but the

ted by counsel, skill in developing
oral arguments, clarity of presen
tation and ability to deal effec
tively with questions from the
court.
Law Association
The Stanford Law Association
presented a $100 award to winner
Hoss, a $50 award to runner-up
Bea and $25 awards to each of the
other two finalists, counsels for
the petitioner, William H. Abbott
and Robert B. Smith.
The awards were a gift to the
Moot Court Board from the Stan
ford Law Society of Northern Cal
ifornia and Nevada.
Commented Justice Peters in
declaring the winners: "All of the
counsels have made able, intelli
gent and lawyer-like presenta
tions. My associates and I are
confident that the presentations
made here tonight were compara
ble to presentations made day by
day in our courts."
Majority Decision
Wednesday's ruling was the
majority decision of two out of
three of the'presiding judges, in
accordance with moot court regu
lations.
Primary issue before the court
was whether an American citizen,
fired from his job in private in
dustry because of a government
administrative agency determina
tion that he is a security risk, is
deprived of his constitutional
rights when denied an opportu
nity to confront his accusers and
to examine government files on
his case.
A balancing of individual rights
against the safety of the nation,
the "due-process clause" with the
"war clause" of the Constitution,
according to public policy on the
matter and the circumstances of
this particular case, was the main
problem facing the court.
Guided Missiles
The case under consideration
was that, of guided missiles ex
pert Newton P. Ohm, employed
from 1042 to 1956 by Stratospheric
Systems, Inc., an electronics re
search firm under exclusive con
trad to the Aimed Services.
On April 30, 1956, Dr. Ohm's
security clearance was revoked by
the Department of Defense on the
sole grounds that, his wife had
been seen in the company of So
viet diplomats and suspectcd es
pionage agents prior to her recent
marriage.
The Industrial Personnel Secu
rity Review Board confirmed the
revocation, denying Dr. Ohm's de
mand to face his accusers and
examine th e evidence against
him.

court.

presented a $100 award to winner

ifornia and Nevada.
Commented Justice Peters in
declaring the winners: "All of the
counsels have made able, intelli
gent and lawyer-like presenta
tions. My associates and I are
confident that the presentations
made here tonight were compara
ble to presentations made day by
day in our courts."
Majority Decision
Wednesday's ruling was the
majority decision of two out of
three of the'presiding judges, in
accordance with moot court regu
lations.
Primary issue before the court
was whether an American citizen,
fired from his job in private in
dustry because of a government
administrative agency determina
tion that he is a security risk, is
deprived of his constitutional
rights when denied an opportu
nity to confront his accusers and
to examine government files on
his case.
A balancing of individual rights
against the safety of the nation,
the "due-process clause" with the
"war clause" of the Constitution,
according to public policy on the
matter and the circumstances of
this particular case, was the main
problem facing the court.
Guided Missiles
The case under consideration
was that, of guided missiles ex
pert Newton P. Ohm, employed
from 1042 to 1956 by Stratospheric
Systems, Inc., an electronics re
search firm under exclusive con
trad to the Aimed Services.
On April 30, 1956, Dr. Ohm's
security clearance was revoked by
the Department of Defense on the
sole grounds that, his wife had
been seen in the company of So
viet diplomats and suspectcd es
pionage agents prior to her recent
marriage.
The Industrial Personnel Secu
rity Review Board confirmed the
revocation, denying Dr. Ohm's de
mand to face his accusers and
examine th e evidence against
him.
Peter 'I'. Hoss. second counsel
for the respondent, was declared
the winner Wednesday night in
the sixth annual Marion Rice
Kirkwood moot court finals in

went to Carlos T. Bca, first coun
sel for the respondent.
