University researchers working under Dr. Ron
ald N. Brace well yesterday calculated estimated
times of closest points of approach (CPA) for
the new Russian satellite. As charted above by
David S. Pratt, the two morning passages will

be far to the east and west of the Bay Area.
Dr. Bracewell says Sputnik may still be visible
at either time to viewers who are high up and
have a clear view of the horizon.
