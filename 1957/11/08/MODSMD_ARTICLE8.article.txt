## Indians Take On Southern Cal In PCC Encounter Tomorrow Trojan War Revived In LA Coliseum 
### Roy Lawson 
The Achilles heel once again may determine who wins the Trojan
War—and not the one fought in 1200 B.C. either. Halfback Rex
Johnston, the Trojans' leading ball-carrier, has a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful participant tomorrow when the University of Southern
California hosts the Stanford Indians.
Johnston, who injured his ankle last week against Washington,

and guard Frank Fiorentino, also
an ankle victim, are doubtful
starters for the Trojans. Game
time is 2 p.m. in the gladiators'
arena, the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Although he has gained but 212
yards for a 4-yard average, Johns
ton paces the Trojans' second best
ball • packer by more than 100
yards. Flis loss, coupled with the
loss of Fiorentino, USC's best de
fensive guard, would be gravely
serious to the undermanned south
ern Californians.
On the subject of the lower ex
tremities, Stanford has also had
trouble with its feet, but maitrly
when attempting points after
touchdowns. Two of the Indians'
three defeats this season have
come via the missed extra-point
route.
Coach Chuck Taylor has had
tackles Armand DeWcese an d
Kyrk Reid and halfback Jackie
Taylor working on the problem
this week, and some solution may
he foreseen.
Regular kicker A1 Harrington,
who led Indian runners with 106
yards gained last week against
Oregon, was sidelined this week
with knee soreness but will never
theless open at right halfback to
morrow.
The Indians are fifth in the Pa
cific Coast Conference, with two
wins and two losses. USC is tied
with Washington for sixth place,
both teams having 1-3 records.
Oregon—27-26 victor over Stan
ford—leads the PCC with a 5-0
mark. With only three games left
to play, only a miracle will keep
the Ducks out of the Rose Bowl
come New Year's Day.
Trojans Top Huskies
Over-all this season, Stanford
has won 4 and lost 3, while the
Trojans list a 1-5 record. USC
broke loose last week by upending
Washington, 19-12, in Seattle,
The Indians boast the PCC's
leading ball-carrier in fullback
Chuck Shea, who has gainer! 564
yards in 117 totes. The running
of Shea and Harrington and the
passing of quarterback Jackie
Douglas has vaulted Stanford into
the PCC's No. 1 total offense po ;
sition.
Despite their potent offense,
which has proven good for 352.4
yards per game 1 his season, spo
radic pass defense problems have
hurt the Cards. Stanford's pass
defense is the lowest ranked in
the PCC.
However, the Indians may take
heart in ihe fact that USC's total
defense has relinquished 306 yards
per game, 244.3 yards of that fig
ure on the ground -Stanford's
forte.

HE'S GONE —Fleet halfback Jon Arnetf (2(5) picks up yardage
against Stanford last season in his final game for USC. Arnetf,
who gained 117 yards in a loving £7-19 effort!, won't be back to
plague the Indians tomorrow when they meet the Trojans. Moving
in for the stop is Stanford halfback Gordy Young (44).
The Achilles heel once again may determine who wins the Trojan
War—and not the one fought in 1200 B.C. either. Halfback Rex
Johnston, the Trojans' leading ball-carrier, has a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful participant tomorrow when the University of Southern
California hosts the Stanford Indians.
Johnston, who injured his ankle last week against Washington,

and guard Frank Fiorentino, also
an ankle victim, are doubtful
starters for the Trojans. Game
time is 2 p.m. in the gladiators'
arena, the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Although he has gained but 212
yards for a 4-yard average, Johns
ton paces the Trojans' second best
ball • packer by more than 100
yards. Flis loss, coupled with the
loss of Fiorentino, USC's best de
fensive guard, would be gravely
serious to the undermanned south
ern Californians.
On the subject of the lower ex
tremities, Stanford has also had
trouble with its feet, but maitrly
when attempting points after
touchdowns. Two of the Indians'
three defeats this season have
come via the missed extra-point
route.
Coach Chuck Taylor has had
tackles Armand DeWcese an d
Kyrk Reid and halfback Jackie
Taylor working on the problem
this week, and some solution may
he foreseen.
Regular kicker A1 Harrington,
who led Indian runners with 106
yards gained last week against
Oregon, was sidelined this week
with knee soreness but will never
theless open at right halfback to
morrow.
The Indians are fifth in the Pa
cific Coast Conference, with two
wins and two losses. USC is tied
with Washington for sixth place,
both teams having 1-3 records.
Oregon—27-26 victor over Stan
ford—leads the PCC with a 5-0
mark. With only three games left
to play, only a miracle will keep
the Ducks out of the Rose Bowl
come New Year's Day.
Trojans Top Huskies
Over-all this season, Stanford
has won 4 and lost 3, while the
Trojans list a 1-5 record. USC
broke loose last week by upending
Washington, 19-12, in Seattle,
The Indians boast the PCC's
leading ball-carrier in fullback
Chuck Shea, who has gainer! 564
yards in 117 totes. The running
of Shea and Harrington and the
passing of quarterback Jackie
Douglas has vaulted Stanford into
the PCC's No. 1 total offense po ;
sition.
Despite their potent offense,
which has proven good for 352.4
yards per game 1 his season, spo
radic pass defense problems have
hurt the Cards. Stanford's pass
defense is the lowest ranked in
the PCC.
However, the Indians may take
heart in ihe fact that USC's total
defense has relinquished 306 yards
per game, 244.3 yards of that fig
ure on the ground -Stanford's
forte.

defense is the lowest ranked in
the PCC.
However, the Indians may take
heart in ihe fact that USC's total
defense has relinquished 306 yards
per game, 244.3 yards of that fig
ure on the ground -Stanford's
forte.

le; Troy Barbee, It; John Clark,
lg; John Thomas, c; Bob Peterson,
rg; Eric Protiva, rt; Gary Van
Galder, re; Jackie Douglas, q;
Jackie Taylor, Hi; A 1 Harrington,
rh; Chuck Shea. 112.

at left half, and with Pat Ragan
at right guard for Fiorentino.
Clark also plans to open with
the following; Lindsy Hubby, le;
Monte Clark, It; Ben Lardi/.abal,
lg; Ken Antle, c; Mike Henry, rt;
Ron Mix, re; Tom Maudlin, q;
Tony Ortega, rh; Jim Conroy, 112.
It will be the 38th meeting of
the two teams. Stanford has won
17 times, including three rugby
triumphs, hut USC" leads the se
ries with 18 victories. Two games
were tied.
The Indians enplane for Los An
geles at 3 p.m. today. They will

HE'S GONE —Fleet halfback Jon Arnetf (2(5) picks up yardage
against Stanford last season in his final game for USC. Arnetf,
who gained 117 yards in a loving £7-19 effort!, won't be back to
plague the Indians tomorrow when they meet the Trojans. Moving
in for the stop is Stanford halfback Gordy Young (44).
The Achilles heel once again may determine who wins the Trojan
War—and not the one fought in 1200 B.C. either. Halfback Rex
Johnston, the Trojans' leading ball-carrier, has a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful participant tomorrow when the University of Southern
California hosts the Stanford Indians.
Johnston, who injured his ankle last week against Washington,

and guard Frank Fiorentino, also
an ankle victim, are doubtful
starters for the Trojans. Game
time is 2 p.m. in the gladiators'
arena, the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Although he has gained but 212
yards for a 4-yard average, Johns
ton paces the Trojans' second best
ball • packer by more than 100
yards. Flis loss, coupled with the
loss of Fiorentino, USC's best de
fensive guard, would be gravely
serious to the undermanned south
ern Californians.
On the subject of the lower ex
tremities, Stanford has also had
trouble with its feet, but maitrly
when attempting points after
touchdowns. Two of the Indians'
three defeats this season have
come via the missed extra-point
route.
Coach Chuck Taylor has had
tackles Armand DeWcese an d
Kyrk Reid and halfback Jackie
Taylor working on the problem
this week, and some solution may
he foreseen.
Regular kicker A1 Harrington,
who led Indian runners with 106
yards gained last week against
Oregon, was sidelined this week
with knee soreness but will never
theless open at right halfback to
morrow.
The Indians are fifth in the Pa
cific Coast Conference, with two
wins and two losses. USC is tied
with Washington for sixth place,
both teams having 1-3 records.
Oregon—27-26 victor over Stan
ford—leads the PCC with a 5-0
mark. With only three games left
to play, only a miracle will keep
the Ducks out of the Rose Bowl
come New Year's Day.
Trojans Top Huskies
Over-all this season, Stanford
has won 4 and lost 3, while the
Trojans list a 1-5 record. USC
broke loose last week by upending
Washington, 19-12, in Seattle,
The Indians boast the PCC's
leading ball-carrier in fullback
Chuck Shea, who has gainer! 564
yards in 117 totes. The running
of Shea and Harrington and the
passing of quarterback Jackie
Douglas has vaulted Stanford into
the PCC's No. 1 total offense po ;
sition.
Despite their potent offense,
which has proven good for 352.4
yards per game 1 his season, spo
radic pass defense problems have
hurt the Cards. Stanford's pass
defense is the lowest ranked in
the PCC.
However, the Indians may take
