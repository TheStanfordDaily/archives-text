## Indians Take On Southern Cal In PCC Encounter Tomorrow Trojan War Revived In LA Coliseum 
### Roy Lawson 
The Achilles heel once again may determine who wins the Trojan
War—and not the one fought in 1200 B.C. either. Halfback Rex
Johnston, the Trojans' leading ball-carrier, has a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful participant tomorrow when the University of Southern
California hosts the Stanford Indians.
Johnston, who injured his ankle last week against Washington,

and guard Frank Fiorentino, also
an ankle victim, are doubtful
starters for the Trojans. Game
time is 2 p.m. in the gladiators'
arena, the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Although he has gained but 212
yards for a 4-yard average, Johns
ton paces the Trojans' second best
ball • packer by more than 100
yards. Flis loss, coupled with the
loss of Fiorentino, USC's best de
fensive guard, would be gravely
serious to the undermanned south
ern Californians.
On the subject of the lower ex
tremities, Stanford has also had
trouble with its feet, but maitrly
when attempting points after
touchdowns. Two of the Indians'
three defeats this season have
come via the missed extra-point
route.
Coach Chuck Taylor has had

Taylor working on the problem
