# Hope for Plane Lost in Pacific Fades Rapidly
## Search Continues for PAA Liner Silent Since Friday; 44 on Board 
### 
HONOLULU (A*) Weak radio distress signals were reported heard
yesterday in the Pacific area where a Pan American air liner van
ished Friday night with 44 persons aboard. But the hopes they
aroused quickly faded whiie carrier and land planes and surface
vessels searched a 150,000-square-mile area.
The Coast Guard said two planes picked up SOS signals at 1:47

a.m. Honolulu time and again an
hour later but they were too
weak to fix a location.
Later a Pan American spokes
man said:
"While we are not discounting;
anything, the signals do not seem
to have the characteristics of
llio.se sent (Hit. by either our planes
or survival equipment."
Planes searching throughout
Saturday night repeatedly report
ed flashing lights but all turned
out to be those of ships.
Since the Honolulu-bound "Ro
mance of the Skies" would have
run out of fuel by now, her 36
passengers and crew of eight
either had to be afloat in the
area or had perished.
The search area for scores of
planes and ships was expanded
from 65,000 to 150,000 square
miles centered on the point 1028
miles east of Honolulu where the
plane s captain, Gordon H. Brown,
of Palo Alto, Calif., made a rou
tine position report at 5:04 p.m.
(PST) Friday night.
That was the last word heard
from the air liner. There was not
one hint of trouble then. The
weather was good. The luxury
air liner transport simply van
ished from the sky as if snatched
by a giant hand.
Officials could only make a wild
guess as to what happened.
"You will hear rumors of ex
plosion or sabotage or whatever,"
said a Pan American spokesman.
"But the plain fact is: we have
no idea of what might have oc
curred."
Comdr. William Chapline, head
ing the Coast Guard phase of the
search, said he felt that the swift
blackout of the transport's radio
meant something happened sud
denly while the Stratocruiser was
10,000 feet above the Pacific.
This, he said—conceding it was
"pure speculation" — could have
been a fuel tank explosion or an
engine.
"Nobody knows," he empha
sized.

from 65,000 to 150,000 square
miles centered on the point 1028
miles east of Honolulu where the
plane s captain, Gordon H. Brown,
of Palo Alto, Calif., made a rou
tine position report at 5:04 p.m.
(PST) Friday night.
That was the last word heard
from the air liner. There was not
one hint of trouble then. The
weather was good. The luxury
air liner transport simply van
ished from the sky as if snatched
by a giant hand.
Officials could only make a wild
guess as to what happened.
"You will hear rumors of ex
plosion or sabotage or whatever,"
said a Pan American spokesman.
"But the plain fact is: we have
no idea of what might have oc
curred."
Comdr. William Chapline, head
ing the Coast Guard phase of the
search, said he felt that the swift
blackout of the transport's radio
meant something happened sud
denly while the Stratocruiser was
10,000 feet above the Pacific.
This, he said—conceding it was
"pure speculation" — could have
been a fuel tank explosion or an
engine.
"Nobody knows," he empha
sized.
HONOLULU (A*) Weak radio distress signals were reported heard
yesterday in the Pacific area where a Pan American air liner van
ished Friday night with 44 persons aboard. But the hopes they
aroused quickly faded whiie carrier and land planes and surface
vessels searched a 150,000-square-mile area.
The Coast Guard said two planes picked up SOS signals at 1:47

a.m. Honolulu time and again an
hour later but they were too
weak to fix a location.
Later a Pan American spokes
man said:
"While we are not discounting;
anything, the signals do not seem
to have the characteristics of
llio.se sent (Hit. by either our planes
or survival equipment."
Planes searching throughout
Saturday night repeatedly report
ed flashing lights but all turned
out to be those of ships.
Since the Honolulu-bound "Ro
mance of the Skies" would have
run out of fuel by now, her 36
passengers and crew of eight
either had to be afloat in the
area or had perished.
The search area for scores of
planes and ships was expanded
