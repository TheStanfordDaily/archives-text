# 200 Blacken Big "C" During Nightmare Rally
## 
### 
Apparently the University of California is already in mourning
for the Dig Game. At least they have painted their once-gold-col
ored Big "C" with black paint.
The prophetic event took place at midnight Thursday when
more than 200 Cal students climbed the Radiation Lab hill to the
Big "C" and smeared it with black paint.
The march to the Big "C" was precipitated by Russ Coglin,
announcer on KRON-TV's Thursday night horror show, "Night
mare." Coglin addressed his followers at the "University of Goula
foria," and called a meeting of the "Berkeley believers" at the Big
"C" at midnight.
Appropriately, red lanterns illuminated the hillside for the
painters, who swabbed on paint with big brooms, and onlookers
set off red flares. The red lights atop Berkeley police cars flashed
about the campus also.
At the same time that the Big "C" was being clad in funeral
garb, about 400 more "Berkeley believers" assembled in Charming
Circle, the heart of fraternity row. Jeers and shouts and wolf
calls, all in honor of "Nightmare," were heard throughout the
campus. Up ;il the Big "C" onlookers inspired I lie painters by
spelling out a D-R-A-C-U-L-A yell.
A bonfire was built in Channing Circle in honor of "Night
mare" a week before at the same time. Dean Sheppard of the Uni
versity of California said that probably a proclamation will be
issued about Wednesday to avoid a repetition of the rallies.
There was no violence. Students in sheets or masks were cen
ters of interest, and police said that the crowds were good-natured.
