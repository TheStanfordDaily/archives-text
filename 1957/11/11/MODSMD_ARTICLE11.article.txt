# BAND MARCHES ON
## SU Music Corps Invades South With Enthusiasm 
### Camille Petersen 
Did you ever spend 24 hours
with the Stanford Band? If you
get the chance, take it — you'll
never forget it. But let me ex
plain from the beginning.
At 4 a.m. Saturday — a crisp
morning just right for sleeping
soundly—bu/.zers on the Wilbur
exchange started going off. It
was nothing serious, just David
Korten, assistant band manager.

and John Miller, band member,
waking band members.
Young men in various degrees
of alertness soon were ploding
toward the band house, for at 5
sharp they were to leave for
USC. The usual kidding filled the
room. So it was 5 a.m. — oh,
groan. . . . Even at this time of
the morning, they remembered
their manners when the handful
of dates arrived.
Breakfast was served at the
airport, and a few minutes after
seven the field of red and white
moved out of the building and
onto the two chartered planes.
Much joking, coffee and many
future pilot wings later the group
landed at Burbank airfield. What
a beautiful sight — nothing but
smog on every side.
One of the buses taking the
band to the USC campus pre
ferred the company of director
and Mrs. Jules Shuchat to that of
girls accompanying the band.
They must be allergic to Stanford
women.
By the time the group arrived
on the USC campus, the girls
were glad to be with the band—
not USC coeds—Skyrocket; left,
right, etc.
After practicing, the band
members ate lunch at the cam
pus cafeteria.
It is quite an experience wait
ing in the tunnel with the band
before it goes on field for pre
game activities. Apathy just isn't
in their dictionary. You can't help
but catch a little of the pride they
have in their group.
As usual, the Stanford Band
was more than noticeably better
than the group from the oppos-
ing school. They work at it—and
the half-times and time-out music
show it.
After the game everyone
denned up and parted for the eve
ning—some to shows, some to the
four corners of Pershing Square;
some to parties and some to night
spots.
One-fifteen a.m. found them all

hack on the buses heading for the
airport. The singing was not as
spirited as it had been earlier in
! the day—there weren't even any
"skyrockets." In fact, the most
prevalent noise was s-n-o-r e. . . .
One minute they were boarding
the planes, the next they were
! taxiing into San Francisco Inter
national. The group was much
quieter during breakfast than it
i had been about 24 hours before.

The sun wasn't up when the
band reached the campus at
about 5:30 a.m. - that anyone
really noticed. Who even realized
it was Sunday already.
Football shows don't take any
time to prepare. Manager Ed
Best and Korten only worked
most of Sunday finishing the one
for Big Game. Tomorrow night
the entire band starts working
on it.

exchange started going off. It
was nothing serious, just David
Korten, assistant band manager.

and John Miller, band member,
waking band members.
Young men in various degrees
of alertness soon were ploding
toward the band house, for at 5
sharp they were to leave for
USC. The usual kidding filled the
room. So it was 5 a.m. — oh,
groan. . . . Even at this time of
the morning, they remembered
their manners when the handful
of dates arrived.
Breakfast was served at the
airport, and a few minutes after
seven the field of red and white
moved out of the building and
onto the two chartered planes.
Much joking, coffee and many
future pilot wings later the group
landed at Burbank airfield. What
a beautiful sight — nothing but
smog on every side.
One of the buses taking the
band to the USC campus pre
ferred the company of director
and Mrs. Jules Shuchat to that of
girls accompanying the band.
They must be allergic to Stanford
women.
By the time the group arrived
on the USC campus, the girls
were glad to be with the band—
not USC coeds—Skyrocket; left,
right, etc.
After practicing, the band
members ate lunch at the cam
pus cafeteria.
It is quite an experience wait
ing in the tunnel with the band
before it goes on field for pre
game activities. Apathy just isn't
in their dictionary. You can't help
but catch a little of the pride they
have in their group.
As usual, the Stanford Band
was more than noticeably better
than the group from the oppos-
ing school. They work at it—and
the half-times and time-out music
show it.
After the game everyone
denned up and parted for the eve
ning—some to shows, some to the
four corners of Pershing Square;
some to parties and some to night
spots.
One-fifteen a.m. found them all

hack on the buses heading for the
airport. The singing was not as
spirited as it had been earlier in
! the day—there weren't even any
"skyrockets." In fact, the most
prevalent noise was s-n-o-r e. . . .
One minute they were boarding
the planes, the next they were
! taxiing into San Francisco Inter
national. The group was much
quieter during breakfast than it
i had been about 24 hours before.

The sun wasn't up when the
band reached the campus at
about 5:30 a.m. - that anyone
really noticed. Who even realized
it was Sunday already.
Football shows don't take any
time to prepare. Manager Ed
Best and Korten only worked
most of Sunday finishing the one
for Big Game. Tomorrow night
the entire band starts working
on it.
Did you ever spend 24 hours
with the Stanford Band? If you
get the chance, take it — you'll
never forget it. But let me ex
plain from the beginning.
At 4 a.m. Saturday — a crisp
morning just right for sleeping
soundly—bu/.zers on the Wilbur
exchange started going off. It
