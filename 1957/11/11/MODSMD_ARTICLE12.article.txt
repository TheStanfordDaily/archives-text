## Ruin Homecoming; Water Bombs, Fouls Spark 35-7 Triumph 
### Frank Huntress 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM
Stanford made its first grand
slam of the two big L.A. univer
sities since 1951 by ruining USC's
homecoming. 35-7, before 52,000
persons in this smog-filled Olym
pic bowl Saturday.
The Indians dumped UCLA, 2<»-
6, earlier this season to make it
the first "perfect season" over the
schools in the south since the In
dians managed it in 1951 before
going to the Rose Bowl.
The onesided game was high
lighted by a near-riot involving
players from both teams and the
bombing of some older Trojan
rooters with water bombs.
Players Ejected
Late in the fourth quarter two
simultaneous personal fouls set
off a fight in front of the USC
bench between players of both
teams.
Before the officials were able to
stop the fight and eject, a player
from each side, the entire Trojan
team was on the field ready to
jump into the melee. The players
on the Indian bench refrained
from getting into the act but had
been "ready" if the officials had
not stopped it.
The rooters were not to be out
done by the players on this sunny
but smoggy afternoon. Earlier in
the second half some rooter let
fly with a carton full of water
which landed in the midst of a
group of USC rooters who were
seated in front of the Stanford
cheer leaders. The Trojan backers
were reported to have been "bois
terous" to the point of inciting
the hostile act.
USC Mimics
Before the game a group of
USC men made their way around
the Coliseum mimicking Stanford
pompon girls, waving red-and
white papier-mache and wearing
red skirts and white blouses.
At half time Stanford's band
again showed they were one of
the best outfits on the Coast. Al
though they did a repeat of the
UCLA game half-time perform
ance with music from "Around
the World in 80 Days," the band's
formations were improved and
were excellent. To repeat the
same half-time performances at
the games "down south" is stand
ard procedure every year.
The Trojan band was conspicu
ously without the accompanimcnt
of its spear-carrying and chariot
riding warriors. However, a Tro
jan, clad for combat and riding a
white steed, did manage to kick
up a lot of dust on the track. He
was greeted by a T-U-R-K-E-Y
spell from the Indian rooting sec
tion.
"Peanuts" Theme
USC's card-stunt theme was
based on the comib strip "Pea
nuts." But, except for their final
stunt the Trojan signature —
their performance was well below
par.
On Friday nig h I before the
game most of the fraternity and
sorority houses at USC adorned
their 1 front lawns with decorations
for the homecoming game. Pi
Kappa Epsilon woti the most
beautiful award for their huge
replica of Snow White with a big
red "S" on her bodice depicting
"Snow White Stanford."
