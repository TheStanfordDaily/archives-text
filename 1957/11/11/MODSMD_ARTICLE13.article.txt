# Students React to New Sputnik
## 
### 
The launching of Sputnik I and
| Sputnik II lias been ;i major
political and scientific develop
mcnl of the past few weeks.
The Daily sampled student re
actions following the firing of
Sputnik 11, with I he following re
sults:
Hassan Ahmed, graduate stu
dent from Egypt: The progress
of science in the world doesn't
have to be generated by a spe
cial country, either the United
States or the USSR, or whatever
country it will be. What we care
for is the benefit for the world.
Shirley Douglass, senior, Flor
ence Moore: The Soviet scientists
seem to have made the most star
tling demonstration so far of
their knowledge. But we will
| have to wait to see where the
1 total achievement lies.
A. Hammond, graduate student
from Egypt: This is an improve

mcnl ol the scientific experi
merits of one of the countries and
perhaps they can use it after
ward in making more investiga
tions about the moon and other
\ planets. Perhaps it can be used
for the service of the human
race. We hope it can be used for
peace rather than war.
Mike llnsayni, graduate stu
dent from Jordan: It serves a
very good purpose in the United
Slates by lessening the superior
ity complex of the American peo
ple. They would know there are
other people in the world who are
;is competent as far as intelli
gence and ability to produce is
concerned. However, I still be
lieve 1 that it does not mean at all
that the USSR is definitely ahead
of the United States in develop
! ment of science.
Nancy Martin, freshman, Ro
ble: It seems to me that Russia's

experiments with this satellite,
having a live animal actually liv
ing in space in preparation for
the lime when man can live
there, arc more beneficial to the
human race than the United
States' experiments with directed
missiles for destructive purposes.
Of course Russia may be plan
ning to use the derived informa
tion for warfare and destruction,
but their experiment itself seems
more beneficial than ours.
Paul Petersen, senior, off cam
pus: This is part of a unified pro
gram to impress the rest of the
world; it has both political and
scientific value to the Russians.
I am glad they got it up there.
Maybe it will make us reconsider
our own program.
Iticluird Itnsscl, freshman, Rin
eonado: The United States can
i be likened to a college freshman,
j who, after setting nn outstanding
I record in high school, does not

step up his efforts to meel l lie
now demands, and at the first
crucial test finds himself unable
to keep up with competition.
Katie Sickler, sophomore, La
gunita: If it isn't publicity, the
second Sputnik is a great advance
as far as science is concerned.
The United States isn't up with
the Russians. This might indi
cate Russia has made other sci
entific advancements, possibly in
the military field.
â€¢Mm Wolsmann, freshman. Ar
royo: I think the significance of
the second Sputnik wasn't scien
tific for it served to augment So
viet propaganda. To me, the
propaganda value is definitely
superior to the scientific value.
What is hurting us now is the
competition among the army, air
force and navy. They are all
wasting time duplicating their ef
fort. There should be a co-ordi
nated effort.
