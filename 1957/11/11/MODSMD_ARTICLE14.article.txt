# Tribe Trounces Trojans, 35 to 7, For 5th Victory
## Five Score for Indians In 3rd Straight Over SC 
### Roy Lawson 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. 9 A halftime card stunt de
picting good ol' Charley Brown and his friends was the best the Uni
versity of Southern California had to cffer today, but even that was
frayed at the edges.
And when it came to playing football, the people from Troy
proved even more inept, for not even the Peanuts bit could offset a
crushing 35-7 defeat from the Stanford Indians.
In the aftermath, the Indians had supporters reaching for their
Rose Bowl-covered glasses to view the Pacific Coast Conference's
race to the patented Big 10 treadmill to oblivion.
While Stanford was racking up its largest point-spread over USC
in their 38-game series, the PCC-leading Oregon Ducks were falling
to a Washington Husky Called Desire, 13-6, in Portland.
The Huskies, going nowhere in tho PCC race at this late hour,
recorded their second straight triumph and kept Stanford's slim
chance to appear in the New Year's Day classic alive. All that lb"
Ducks have to do is lose to USC and Oregon State while the Indians
defeat Oregon State and California. Oregon has a 5-1 PCC record,
including a win over Idaho that won't count in the balloting, and
Stanford is now 3-2.
The Indians will be in good physical shape for Satruday's Oregon
State game in C'orvallis. Trainer Connie Jarvis said yesterday that,
no one will miss the OSC crucial because of injuries from the USC
game.
Harrington Hurl—OK for OSC
Halfback A 1 Harrington was hit in the jaw while blocking in
the second period and was knocked unconscious. He returned to the
field in the second half in street clothes, however, and received a
thundering ovation from the Stanford rooting section. It was ex
pected that he will play Satruday.
A strong defense that was rapping enemy ball-packers with two
and three tacklers most of the time kept the Trojans from becoming
a serious threat. Stanford end Joel Freis didn't catch a single pass,
but the job he did on defense was something to behold. The 6-0, 179-
poundcr, whose home town is Los Angeles, made five unassisted
tackles and paiticipated in four other tackles as well.
Freis wasn't alone. Guards Bob Peterson and Noel Robinson were
in on 12 tackles between them and tackles Armand DeWeese and
Eric Protiva had a hand in nine stops together.
The big come-through was turned in by right tackle Phil Burk
land. Burkland, a 210-pound junior, is a reserve, but he played like
a first-stringer, contributing an aided tackle and six assists. Line
backers Don Manoukian, Don Dawson and John Thomas totaled J8
tackles.
Satisfying Win for Chuck
It was a satisfying triumph for Indian coach Chuck Tayolr. USC
may have had eight seniors ineligible this season because of PCC
rule infractions, but that didn't kick five straight extra points for
Stanford—six counting the one that Jackie Taylor had to boot twice.
Stanford has now won three straight times against USC, and
the series between the two teams is even at 18 triumphs each and
two ties. Today's defeat was the worst suffered in five seasons for
th Trojans since they were bombed 48-14 by Notre Dame in 1953.
posted over the Indians in 1952.
The Indians' won-lost total was hoisted to five victories and
three losses. Coach Don Clark's Trojans suffered their sixth loss
in seven games this season. Their only win came against Washing
ton, 19-12, two weeks ago.
The Indians, running only 13 yards below their PCC-leading total
offense average, advanced 339 yards through the Trojans to score
ihree times in the first half and twice in the third quarter.
Tied once but never headed, Stanford raked the Trojans' stacked
but slow flanks for big chunks of yardage and when USC compen
sated further the Indians shot through the middle like P. T. Bar
num's man in the cannon.
Fullback Chuck Shea added to his position as the PCC's leading
bail-carrier with 77 yards in 10 carries. The 6-2, 200-pound senior haS
gained 64! yards for a five-yard average this season. Shea was ihc
games leading ground-gainer, but close behind were fullback Rick
McMillen with 12-for-Ol yards and a five-yard mark and right half
back Jim Byrer with 5-for-51 yards and a flossy 10.2-yard figure.
The Cards—two men or more participated in most of the tackles
played good defensive ball against USC, but the Trojans did plenty
on their own to abet the Stanford cause.
Time after time, USC's inexperienced players stalled potential
lengthy drives with inopportune penalties. Only in the opening
minutes of the second period did their attack click for a touchdown.
Stanford began its 67-yard drive to the first of five touchdowns
with 4:30 remaining in the first quarter. It took 10 plays before
McMillen drove six yards around the right side to pay dirt. Quarter
back Jackie Douglas, running McMillen often and at the right times,
sent the fleet 190-pound sophomore from Danville through the line
five times on the march.
The big play came with a first and 10 on the USC 42 when Doug
las rolled right and fired to flankerback Jeri McMillin 17 yards away
on the 2").
Douglas Evades Trojan Warriors
With fourth and one on the 16. Douglas again rolled right, but
his receivers were covered and just when it appeared that the big
Trojans had descended upon the 178-pounder from Santa Monica, he
jerked free and ducked under three men, racing to the six. McMillen
took a pitchout and scored on the next play. Harrington added the
conversion with only 13 seconds left in the first period.
USC wasn't the better team today, but nevertheless they were
dead game. They took DeWeese's subsquent kickoff and drove 74
yards to tie the score.
Quarterback Willie Wood had halfback Tony Ortega picking up
the ground yardage for the Trojans, but the pay-off play was a 20-
yard touchdown pass to end Don Voyne. Halfback Don Buford knot
ted the count at 7*7 with a perfect kick.
Midway through Ihe second quarter, Jackie Taylor picked off a
Wood pass on the USC 37 and the nimble Indian returned to the 10
to set up the tie-breaker.
A pitchout to Shea to the left netted four yards, then he took a
lateral to Ihe right, dropped the ball and had it bounce back into
his hands and scored without further ado. Harrington again con
verted, giving the Indians a 14-7 edge.
After kicking off to the Trojans, ihe Indians forced a punt, taking
over on their own 29. Thirteen plays later, the go-go-go Cards were
across the goal again.
Shea was ripping off 10 yards a crack to the outside when Doug
las took 1o the skylanes and hit Taylor with an 11-yarder and end
Dick Stein with a nine-yard shot on the USC 15. McMillen went to
the seven, then one play later Douglas moved to the right and hit
end Gary van Galder on the one. Halfback Roy Stephen crashed
over center from that point with Ihe 20th point.
Taylor Boots Long P.A.T.
Taylor's kick was good, but Stanford was penalized five yards
for illegal procedure and Taylor repeated the foal from five yards
back. It was 21-7 with 19 seconds remaining in the first half.
End Chris Burford's successful onside kick lo Stein on the Trojan
42 precluded a last-second USC scoring attempt.
Two more scores were to come for Stanford the firsl of them
right off the bat in the third period. Shea took ihe second-half kick
off 31 yards to the Stanford 43 to get the ball rolling. USC had de
cided to roam wide in an effort to stop the Indians' outside running
attack.
The maneuver worked in a sense—in the sense that Stanford
started running wild up the middle. Shea powered straight ahead
for 21 yards and Byrer slanted through ihe center for 16 yards to
Ihe USC 15.
Two plays failed to click, so Douglas sent Byrer through Ihe same
spot and center John Thomas and right guard Bob Peterson opened
a hole for him that the Trojan horse could have dragged Tommy
Trojan through wilhout getting caught. Byrer was over the goal
like a flash on the 15-yard play.
Taylor converted for the second straight lime, giving Stanford
a 28-7 margin with only 2:12 gone in the second half.
In Ihe latter stage of the third quarter, the Indians fashioned
their final touchdown move of the afternoon. It was a split march
that started when McMillen called a fair catch on halfback Bill
Howard's punt at the Stanford 46.
McMillen swung wide to ihe right for nine yards and the Cards
made one first down before Byrer punted over Ihe goal on a fourth
and-fottr situation at the USC 36.
Two-Play Touchdown Drive
Two plays later. Howard fumbled on a third-man-through play
to the left side and Douglas recovered for Stanford. He Ihen engi
neered a two-play, 29-yard drive to the promised land.
Douglas ran the split-T option play to the right and drew in USC
left end Don Douglas (no relation), then pitched back to McMillen.
Rick raced 17 yards to the 12 before tackle Rod Humenuik nailed
him. Douglas fired a jump pass to Burford on the six and the big
right end shot through safetyman Tom Maudlin and wingback Don
Buford for the score.
Only three seconds remained in the third quarter when DeWeese
ended scoring for the day with a conversion.
Reserves dominated fourth-period action for the Indians, and
USC with Wood running and passing for all he was worth—gained
more than 100 yards of its total in ihe final quarter.
Sid Garber was the big gun for Stanford in the final period. He
gained 25 yards in three carries and passed to six additional yards,
completing both attempts.
