# Tribe Trounces Trojans, 35 to 7, For 5th Victory
## Five Score for Indians In 3rd Straight Over SC 
### Roy Lawson 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. 9 A halftime card stunt de
picting good ol' Charley Brown and his friends was the best the Uni
versity of Southern California had to cffer today, but even that was
frayed at the edges.
And when it came to playing football, the people from Troy
proved even more inept, for not even the Peanuts bit could offset a
crushing 35-7 defeat from the Stanford Indians.
In the aftermath, the Indians had supporters reaching for their
Rose Bowl-covered glasses to view the Pacific Coast Conference's
race to the patented Big 10 treadmill to oblivion.
While Stanford was racking up its largest point-spread over USC
in their 38-game series, the PCC-leading Oregon Ducks were falling
to a Washington Husky Called Desire, 13-6, in Portland.
The Huskies, going nowhere in tho PCC race at this late hour,
recorded their second straight triumph and kept Stanford's slim
chance to appear in the New Year's Day classic alive. All that lb"
Ducks have to do is lose to USC and Oregon State while the Indians
defeat Oregon State and California. Oregon has a 5-1 PCC record,
including a win over Idaho that won't count in the balloting, and
Stanford is now 3-2.
The Indians will be in good physical shape for Satruday's Oregon
State game in C'orvallis. Trainer Connie Jarvis said yesterday that,
no one will miss the OSC crucial because of injuries from the USC
game.
Harrington Hurl—OK for OSC
Halfback A 1 Harrington was hit in the jaw while blocking in
the second period and was knocked unconscious. He returned to the
field in the second half in street clothes, however, and received a
thundering ovation from the Stanford rooting section. It was ex
pected that he will play Satruday.
A strong defense that was rapping enemy ball-packers with two
and three tacklers most of the time kept the Trojans from becoming
a serious threat. Stanford end Joel Freis didn't catch a single pass,
but the job he did on defense was something to behold. The 6-0, 179-
poundcr, whose home town is Los Angeles, made five unassisted
tackles and paiticipated in four other tackles as well.
Freis wasn't alone. Guards Bob Peterson and Noel Robinson were
in on 12 tackles between them and tackles Armand DeWeese and
Eric Protiva had a hand in nine stops together.
The big come-through was turned in by right tackle Phil Burk
land. Burkland, a 210-pound junior, is a reserve, but he played like
a first-stringer, contributing an aided tackle and six assists. Line
backers Don Manoukian, Don Dawson and John Thomas totaled J8
tackles.
Satisfying Win for Chuck
It was a satisfying triumph for Indian coach Chuck Tayolr. USC
may have had eight seniors ineligible this season because of PCC
rule infractions, but that didn't kick five straight extra points for
Stanford—six counting the one that Jackie Taylor had to boot twice.
Stanford has now won three straight times against USC, and
the series between the two teams is even at 18 triumphs each and
two ties. Today's defeat was the worst suffered in five seasons for
th Trojans since they were bombed 48-14 by Notre Dame in 1953.
posted over the Indians in 1952.
The Indians' won-lost total was hoisted to five victories and
three losses. Coach Don Clark's Trojans suffered their sixth loss
in seven games this season. Their only win came against Washing
ton, 19-12, two weeks ago.
