# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Dave Quarles
## From Smogland to Peachy Speeches 
### 
For those of you who recover sometime in
Ihe next seven days from the successful lost
weekend down in Smogland, we thought we
would let you in on ihc peachy calendar issued
by the Committee on Public Exercises. Those
unable to open their eyes needn't bother 1o read.
•» « «
Patriotic Californians will have a chance to
soak up some state lore today at 4 p.m., Room
320, Geology Corner. Robert Coleman will orate
on "The Mineralogy and Petrology of the New
Jdria District, California." If Mineralogy. Pet
rology and the New Idria District don't fascinate
you, coffee preceding the show may.
Attention, letter-to-the-editor writers . . . here's
;i chance to learn how to make your hot air ef
fective. At 4:15 this afternoon Professor H. Bar
iels of the University of Tubingen, Germany,
will discuss "Gas Exchange in the Human Pla
centa" in Room 430. Jordan Hall. We don't know
about Germany, but there seems to be ample gas
exchange around here.
*
Those interested may traverse the realms of
Ihe literary Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Mem Aud
with Frank O'Connor, author. Topic: "Mr.
O'Connor, Why Don't You Write About Amer
ica?" We have just one question, Mr. O'Connor:
Why don't you write about America?
Wednesday offers thrills and chills galore. Tf
you want a preview of what Cal may spring on
us come Big Game, go to hear M. L. Stevenson
of the University of California discuss '"Asso
ciated Production with 1.1-Bev Pions" in Room
ph 101, Physics lecture hall. How can we occupy
ourselves with Muttniks when fiendish Calites
are preparing to attack with 1.1-Bev Pions? The
important question is what are 1.1-Bev Pions,
and are we prepared for them? Are they irre
vocable?

Perhaps our own George Leppert, associate
professor of mechanical engineering, lias the
answer to 1. 1-Bev Pions in his discussion of "The
Argonaut Nuclear Reactor" at 4:1") p.m. Wednes
day in Room 20 of the Chemistry Building. Keep
your fingers crossed that the Argonaut can sub
due those demon 1.1-Bev Pions. If not, Big
Game may not be such a breeze.
Students enrolled in that classic course His
tory of the Motion Picture will get a chance to
see two classic films al 4:15 p.m. Wednesday in
the Li I tie Theatre, Mem And. Featured are Paul
Rotha's "Shipyard" and Laurel and Hardy in
"Laughing Gas." Don't feel discriminated
against if you are not pursuing higher- learning
in the motion picture field because EVERYONE
is invited.
To round out the day, a sports reel, "Air Force
Acrobatics," and"The Man Behind the Badge"
will be shown in Room 50, Department of Ath
letics, at 7:30 p.m. Beware of brain washing—
sounds like AFROTC propaganda!
a « «
Someone should stop the Mathematics Depart
ment before they enslave us all. Now they are
subjugating Stochastic Processes. John Lam
port! will pronounce the Math Department's ty
rannical rulings Thursday at 3:15 p.m. in Room
104, Sequoia Hall, when he discusses "An Occu
pation-time Theorem for a Class of Stochastic
Processes." Surely Stochastic Processes can
think of their own ways to occupy their time.
Wishful thinking at the flicks Sunday when
James Stuart comes on the screen as "The Man
Who Knew Too Much." Evidently Jimmy never
heard of Stanford exams. At any rate, elbow
your way through the crowd to Mem Aud at 7:30
p.m. and bring pencil and paper to catch any of
Jimmy's overflow information.
For those of you who recover sometime in
Ihe next seven days from the successful lost
weekend down in Smogland, we thought we
would let you in on ihc peachy calendar issued
by the Committee on Public Exercises. Those

Wednesday offers thrills and chills galore. Tf
you want a preview of what Cal may spring on
us come Big Game, go to hear M. L. Stevenson
of the University of California discuss '"Asso
ciated Production with 1.1-Bev Pions" in Room
ph 101, Physics lecture hall. How can we occupy
ourselves with Muttniks when fiendish Calites
are preparing to attack with 1.1-Bev Pions? The
important question is what are 1.1-Bev Pions,
and are we prepared for them? Are they irre
vocable?

Perhaps our own George Leppert, associate
professor of mechanical engineering, lias the
answer to 1. 1-Bev Pions in his discussion of "The
Argonaut Nuclear Reactor" at 4:1") p.m. Wednes
day in Room 20 of the Chemistry Building. Keep
your fingers crossed that the Argonaut can sub
