Aggrieved lo Read
Editor, The Daily:
I am much aggrieved to read almost weekly of
deaths and injuries to Stanford male students on
highways near the campus. According to the
National Office of Vital Statistics, mortality rates
in the categories of non-vehicular accidents and
vehicular accidents in the United States for hoys
and men are, respectively, two and three times
Ihe rates for girls and women. The sex differen
tial in over-all mortality reaches a maximum in
1 ho age group of 20 to 24 years, being 7.2 times
as much for young men as for young women in
connection with motor vehicles.
The facts suggest that certain means common
ly adopted by young men for release of tensions
are highly self-destructive of Ihe group. In some
cases the deaths and injuries are associated with
racing along the highways. Insofar as deliberate
choices of the participants are involved, I would
like to know whether the Stanford Honor Code
applies to the use of courteous and safe driving
practices by Stanford students when Ihey are off
the campus.
Insofar as less conscio\is behavior is involved,
we may recognize that the atmosphere at Stan
ford University is stimulating and also tension
creating, only part of the latter of which is re
leased at football games. An important contrib
utor to unhealthy academic and social tensions,
particularly among male students at Stanford, is
ihe artificial social-intellectual environment cre
ated by the admission of two to three times as
many men as women students and the appoint
ment of at least 20 times as many men as women
1o the faculty and Ihe policy-determining admin
istration.
Sex discriminatory ratios are maintained at
Stanford by male administrators and trustees
with the objective of giving special privilege to
members of their own sex. Masculinism, like
racism — the other large-group discrimination
based on birth-determined characteristics- has a
boomerang component, however. The price of
special privilege in educational opportunities dis
regarding individual qualifications is paid for by
those for whom benefits are intended as well as
by those who are discriminated against. The un
desirable academic and social tensions created by
Stanford's sex - discriminatory ratios are recog
nized by Stanford's most competent faculty mem
bers in psychology and education and other fields
who have considered the matter.
It should be remembered that the Stanford
ratio is not a decision of the Stanford faculty, and
that the students, alumni and alumnae as groups
have not been consulted. The Faculty Admissions
Committee is simply told to determine which ap
plicants shall be admitted according to a pre
determined ratio which they have had no hand
in deciding, and residence facilities are assigned
and built to conform to a predetermined ratio
without regard to the essential equality in num
bers of men and women qualified for admission.

Ke-clefine Imperialism
J >1 it or. The Daily:
Said Mr. Spaak, "If the establishment of Ihe
Russian satellites is not imperialism, then we
must redefine the word."
II the next task of Mr. Spaak is to build a new
dictionary, he should in the foreword redefine his
own position first. For when he says that Mr.
Khrushchev is "sincere," I start to wonder wheth
er Mr. Spaak is the right man for an accurate
European language. His concept of sincerity is,
at least, fairly loose [sic], and his speech last
Wednesday proved it well enough.
For, if I understood well, did not he say that
Christianity was the banner of the free world?
In the youth of Mr. Spaak a previous socialist
premier of Belgium, influent [sic] member of the
party . . . ! Let me smile slightly at the picture
of this lately-converted Christianity torchbearer.
If truly the Communist world can be presented as
ihe Antichrist, then Mr. Spaak has longer worked
for it than against it. For Ihose who remember
ihe climate of violent passion in Belgium a few
years ago when a project of law was to be passed
which would hav§ suppressed completely the

financial support to the Catholic schools, this
conversion seems miraculous.
For, who was the sponsor of this law if not Ihe
Socialist party of which he was the head? How
better could he work against Christianity lhan
by making its teaching impossible? And where
are his concepts of individual freedom when he
would guide the whole youth through a single
teaching, namely, an antireligious, socialist so
called chumenism [sic] ?
Why, all of a sudden, make synonymous two
different worlds, the capitalist world on one hand
and the free world on the other hand, when they
are not? I feel deeply that I belong to Ihe free
world, but I certainly do not adhere to the capi
talist one. I do not "believe" that Mr. Spaak did
not make this confusion willingly when in ihe
past he probably got elected by promising his
electors the defeat of capitalism.
I do not understand unless a hidden conversion,
necessary inside NATO, occurred. "Paris vaut
bien une messe."
Mr. Spaak's new dictionary won't be a best
seller.

'Innocents Abroad'
Editor, The Daily:
A famous magazine spoke of Ihe travelers to
Red China as "innocents abroad." While I do not
quite agree that this is a fair generalization to
make concerning the students, 1 think that Mi
chael Hass. who recently wrote a letter to The
Daily, fits the description perfectly.
It seems amazing to me that any college stu
dent could accept Mao Tse-tung's statements at
lace value; Hass has evidently done so. He says
that Mao has announced a change in policy and
that he permits criticism of his regime. I didn't
know that anyone except the editor of the Daily
Worker really believed this. A recent issue of
Time points out what has recently happened to
those residents of China who took up Mao's offer.
And Hass ends by urging this country to ap
proach China in a "friendly manner," and attacks
our ally Nationalist China, whose people were
pushed from their country by the Communists.
I have only compliments for Mr. Williamson,
who took the trip. He could have done us much
harm if, like Mr. Hass, he swallowed the line so
naively.

Frankly a Pain
Editor, The Daily:
It is Frankly a pain to many of your readers
to find the Daily staff employing people doing
high school graduate work in Beginning Jour
nalism such as Frank Huntress. Clearly such
staff members can and do support head yell
leader Ed Bordenkireher, the team and the stu
dent body to the best of their high school ability.
I hope that as a result of his constructive criti
cism. Mr. Huntress has sent Ed a long list of
"college yells," a few of which are suitable for
mixed company. Maybe if the band helps, "With
a Little Bit of Luck" we will find Mr. Huntress
"Standing on Ihe Corner" pointing his thumb in
the direction of the campanile.

Excellent Coverage
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Student Health Committee, I
would like to extend my appreciation for the ex
cellent coverage given our committee in your
paper. The Daily's articles have been terrific in
stimulating health interest in ihe Stanford stu
dent body. As a result we now have one of the
largest student health committees for many past
years. Through your publication students have
become more aware of their own heallli and the
importance of maintaining good health.
Your paper is making a needed contribution to
Stanford students, and Ihe commiHee hopes The
Daily will continue to do so. Again, may I Iharik
you most sincerely for all that your paper has
done lo promote the services of our committee.
Sincerely,

based on birth-determined characteristics- has a
boomerang component, however. The price of
special privilege in educational opportunities dis
regarding individual qualifications is paid for by
those for whom benefits are intended as well as
by those who are discriminated against. The un
desirable academic and social tensions created by
Stanford's sex - discriminatory ratios are recog
nized by Stanford's most competent faculty mem
bers in psychology and education and other fields
who have considered the matter.
It should be remembered that the Stanford
ratio is not a decision of the Stanford faculty, and
that the students, alumni and alumnae as groups
have not been consulted. The Faculty Admissions
Committee is simply told to determine which ap
plicants shall be admitted according to a pre
determined ratio which they have had no hand
in deciding, and residence facilities are assigned
and built to conform to a predetermined ratio
without regard to the essential equality in num
bers of men and women qualified for admission.

Ke-clefine Imperialism

Said Mr. Spaak, "If the establishment of Ihe
Russian satellites is not imperialism, then we
must redefine the word."
II the next task of Mr. Spaak is to build a new
dictionary, he should in the foreword redefine his
own position first. For when he says that Mr.
Khrushchev is "sincere," I start to wonder wheth
er Mr. Spaak is the right man for an accurate
European language. His concept of sincerity is,
at least, fairly loose [sic], and his speech last
Wednesday proved it well enough.
For, if I understood well, did not he say that
Christianity was the banner of the free world?
In the youth of Mr. Spaak a previous socialist
premier of Belgium, influent [sic] member of the
party . . . ! Let me smile slightly at the picture
of this lately-converted Christianity torchbearer.
If truly the Communist world can be presented as
ihe Antichrist, then Mr. Spaak has longer worked
for it than against it. For Ihose who remember
ihe climate of violent passion in Belgium a few
years ago when a project of law was to be passed
which would hav§ suppressed completely the

financial support to the Catholic schools, this
conversion seems miraculous.
For, who was the sponsor of this law if not Ihe
Socialist party of which he was the head? How
better could he work against Christianity lhan
by making its teaching impossible? And where
are his concepts of individual freedom when he
would guide the whole youth through a single
teaching, namely, an antireligious, socialist so
called chumenism [sic] ?
Why, all of a sudden, make synonymous two
different worlds, the capitalist world on one hand
and the free world on the other hand, when they
are not? I feel deeply that I belong to Ihe free
world, but I certainly do not adhere to the capi
talist one. I do not "believe" that Mr. Spaak did
not make this confusion willingly when in ihe
past he probably got elected by promising his
electors the defeat of capitalism.
I do not understand unless a hidden conversion,
necessary inside NATO, occurred. "Paris vaut
bien une messe."
Mr. Spaak's new dictionary won't be a best

'Innocents Abroad'
Editor, The Daily:
A famous magazine spoke of Ihe travelers to
Red China as "innocents abroad." While I do not
quite agree that this is a fair generalization to
make concerning the students, 1 think that Mi
chael Hass. who recently wrote a letter to The
Daily, fits the description perfectly.
It seems amazing to me that any college stu
dent could accept Mao Tse-tung's statements at
lace value; Hass has evidently done so. He says
that Mao has announced a change in policy and
that he permits criticism of his regime. I didn't
know that anyone except the editor of the Daily
Worker really believed this. A recent issue of
Time points out what has recently happened to
those residents of China who took up Mao's offer.
And Hass ends by urging this country to ap
proach China in a "friendly manner," and attacks
our ally Nationalist China, whose people were
pushed from their country by the Communists.
I have only compliments for Mr. Williamson,
who took the trip. He could have done us much
harm if, like Mr. Hass, he swallowed the line so
naively.

Frankly a Pain
Editor, The Daily:
It is Frankly a pain to many of your readers
to find the Daily staff employing people doing
high school graduate work in Beginning Jour
nalism such as Frank Huntress. Clearly such
staff members can and do support head yell
leader Ed Bordenkireher, the team and the stu
dent body to the best of their high school ability.
I hope that as a result of his constructive criti
cism. Mr. Huntress has sent Ed a long list of
"college yells," a few of which are suitable for
mixed company. Maybe if the band helps, "With
a Little Bit of Luck" we will find Mr. Huntress
"Standing on Ihe Corner" pointing his thumb in
the direction of the campanile.

On behalf of the Student Health Committee, I
would like to extend my appreciation for the ex

paper. The Daily's articles have been terrific in
stimulating health interest in ihe Stanford stu

largest student health committees for many past
years. Through your publication students have
become more aware of their own heallli and the
importance of maintaining good health.
Your paper is making a needed contribution to
Stanford students, and Ihe commiHee hopes The

you most sincerely for all that your paper has

Aggrieved lo Read
Editor, The Daily:
I am much aggrieved to read almost weekly of
deaths and injuries to Stanford male students on
highways near the campus. According to the
National Office of Vital Statistics, mortality rates
in the categories of non-vehicular accidents and
vehicular accidents in the United States for hoys
and men are, respectively, two and three times
Ihe rates for girls and women. The sex differen
tial in over-all mortality reaches a maximum in
1 ho age group of 20 to 24 years, being 7.2 times
as much for young men as for young women in
connection with motor vehicles.
The facts suggest that certain means common
ly adopted by young men for release of tensions
are highly self-destructive of Ihe group. In some
cases the deaths and injuries are associated with
racing along the highways. Insofar as deliberate
choices of the participants are involved, I would
like to know whether the Stanford Honor Code
applies to the use of courteous and safe driving
practices by Stanford students when Ihey are off
the campus.
Insofar as less conscio\is behavior is involved,
we may recognize that the atmosphere at Stan
ford University is stimulating and also tension
creating, only part of the latter of which is re
leased at football games. An important contrib
utor to unhealthy academic and social tensions,
particularly among male students at Stanford, is
ihe artificial social-intellectual environment cre
ated by the admission of two to three times as
many men as women students and the appoint
ment of at least 20 times as many men as women
1o the faculty and Ihe policy-determining admin
istration.

party . . . ! Let me smile slightly at the picture
of this lately-converted Christianity torchbearer.
If truly the Communist world can be presented as
ihe Antichrist, then Mr. Spaak has longer worked
for it than against it. For Ihose who remember
ihe climate of violent passion in Belgium a few
years ago when a project of law was to be passed
which would hav§ suppressed completely the

financial support to the Catholic schools, this
conversion seems miraculous.
For, who was the sponsor of this law if not Ihe
Socialist party of which he was the head? How
better could he work against Christianity lhan
by making its teaching impossible? And where
are his concepts of individual freedom when he
would guide the whole youth through a single
teaching, namely, an antireligious, socialist so
called chumenism [sic] ?
Why, all of a sudden, make synonymous two
different worlds, the capitalist world on one hand
and the free world on the other hand, when they
are not? I feel deeply that I belong to Ihe free
world, but I certainly do not adhere to the capi
talist one. I do not "believe" that Mr. Spaak did
not make this confusion willingly when in ihe
past he probably got elected by promising his
electors the defeat of capitalism.
I do not understand unless a hidden conversion,
necessary inside NATO, occurred. "Paris vaut
bien une messe."
Mr. Spaak's new dictionary won't be a best
seller.

'Innocents Abroad'
Editor, The Daily:
A famous magazine spoke of Ihe travelers to
Red China as "innocents abroad." While I do not
quite agree that this is a fair generalization to
make concerning the students, 1 think that Mi
chael Hass. who recently wrote a letter to The
Daily, fits the description perfectly.
It seems amazing to me that any college stu
dent could accept Mao Tse-tung's statements at
lace value; Hass has evidently done so. He says
that Mao has announced a change in policy and
that he permits criticism of his regime. I didn't
know that anyone except the editor of the Daily
Worker really believed this. A recent issue of
Time points out what has recently happened to
those residents of China who took up Mao's offer.
And Hass ends by urging this country to ap
proach China in a "friendly manner," and attacks
our ally Nationalist China, whose people were
pushed from their country by the Communists.
I have only compliments for Mr. Williamson,
who took the trip. He could have done us much
harm if, like Mr. Hass, he swallowed the line so
naively.

Frankly a Pain
Editor, The Daily:
It is Frankly a pain to many of your readers
to find the Daily staff employing people doing
high school graduate work in Beginning Jour
nalism such as Frank Huntress. Clearly such
staff members can and do support head yell
leader Ed Bordenkireher, the team and the stu
dent body to the best of their high school ability.
I hope that as a result of his constructive criti
cism. Mr. Huntress has sent Ed a long list of
"college yells," a few of which are suitable for
mixed company. Maybe if the band helps, "With
a Little Bit of Luck" we will find Mr. Huntress
"Standing on Ihe Corner" pointing his thumb in
the direction of the campanile.

Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Student Health Committee, I
would like to extend my appreciation for the ex
cellent coverage given our committee in your
paper. The Daily's articles have been terrific in
stimulating health interest in ihe Stanford stu
dent body. As a result we now have one of the
largest student health committees for many past
years. Through your publication students have
become more aware of their own heallli and the
importance of maintaining good health.
Your paper is making a needed contribution to
Stanford students, and Ihe commiHee hopes The
Daily will continue to do so. Again, may I Iharik
you most sincerely for all that your paper has
done lo promote the services of our committee.

Aggrieved lo Read
Editor, The Daily:
I am much aggrieved to read almost weekly of
deaths and injuries to Stanford male students on
highways near the campus. According to the
National Office of Vital Statistics, mortality rates
in the categories of non-vehicular accidents and
vehicular accidents in the United States for hoys
and men are, respectively, two and three times
Ihe rates for girls and women. The sex differen
tial in over-all mortality reaches a maximum in
1 ho age group of 20 to 24 years, being 7.2 times
as much for young men as for young women in
connection with motor vehicles.
The facts suggest that certain means common
ly adopted by young men for release of tensions
are highly self-destructive of Ihe group. In some
cases the deaths and injuries are associated with
racing along the highways. Insofar as deliberate
choices of the participants are involved, I would
like to know whether the Stanford Honor Code
applies to the use of courteous and safe driving
practices by Stanford students when Ihey are off
the campus.
Insofar as less conscio\is behavior is involved,
we may recognize that the atmosphere at Stan
ford University is stimulating and also tension
creating, only part of the latter of which is re
leased at football games. An important contrib
utor to unhealthy academic and social tensions,
particularly among male students at Stanford, is
ihe artificial social-intellectual environment cre
ated by the admission of two to three times as
many men as women students and the appoint
ment of at least 20 times as many men as women
1o the faculty and Ihe policy-determining admin
istration.
Sex discriminatory ratios are maintained at
Stanford by male administrators and trustees
with the objective of giving special privilege to
members of their own sex. Masculinism, like
racism — the other large-group discrimination
based on birth-determined characteristics- has a
boomerang component, however. The price of
special privilege in educational opportunities dis
regarding individual qualifications is paid for by
those for whom benefits are intended as well as
by those who are discriminated against. The un
desirable academic and social tensions created by
Stanford's sex - discriminatory ratios are recog
nized by Stanford's most competent faculty mem
bers in psychology and education and other fields
who have considered the matter.
It should be remembered that the Stanford
ratio is not a decision of the Stanford faculty, and
that the students, alumni and alumnae as groups
have not been consulted. The Faculty Admissions
Committee is simply told to determine which ap
plicants shall be admitted according to a pre
determined ratio which they have had no hand
in deciding, and residence facilities are assigned
and built to conform to a predetermined ratio
without regard to the essential equality in num
bers of men and women qualified for admission.

Daily, fits the description perfectly.
It seems amazing to me that any college stu
dent could accept Mao Tse-tung's statements at
lace value; Hass has evidently done so. He says
that Mao has announced a change in policy and
that he permits criticism of his regime. I didn't
know that anyone except the editor of the Daily
Worker really believed this. A recent issue of
Time points out what has recently happened to
those residents of China who took up Mao's offer.
And Hass ends by urging this country to ap
proach China in a "friendly manner," and attacks
our ally Nationalist China, whose people were
pushed from their country by the Communists.
I have only compliments for Mr. Williamson,
who took the trip. He could have done us much
harm if, like Mr. Hass, he swallowed the line so
naively.

Frankly a Pain
Editor, The Daily:
It is Frankly a pain to many of your readers
to find the Daily staff employing people doing
high school graduate work in Beginning Jour
nalism such as Frank Huntress. Clearly such
staff members can and do support head yell
leader Ed Bordenkireher, the team and the stu
dent body to the best of their high school ability.
I hope that as a result of his constructive criti
cism. Mr. Huntress has sent Ed a long list of
"college yells," a few of which are suitable for
mixed company. Maybe if the band helps, "With
a Little Bit of Luck" we will find Mr. Huntress
"Standing on Ihe Corner" pointing his thumb in
the direction of the campanile.

Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Student Health Committee, I
would like to extend my appreciation for the ex
cellent coverage given our committee in your
paper. The Daily's articles have been terrific in
stimulating health interest in ihe Stanford stu
dent body. As a result we now have one of the
largest student health committees for many past
years. Through your publication students have
become more aware of their own heallli and the
importance of maintaining good health.
Your paper is making a needed contribution to
Stanford students, and Ihe commiHee hopes The
Daily will continue to do so. Again, may I Iharik
you most sincerely for all that your paper has
done lo promote the services of our committee.

Aggrieved lo Read
Editor, The Daily:
I am much aggrieved to read almost weekly of
deaths and injuries to Stanford male students on
highways near the campus. According to the
National Office of Vital Statistics, mortality rates
in the categories of non-vehicular accidents and
vehicular accidents in the United States for hoys
and men are, respectively, two and three times
Ihe rates for girls and women. The sex differen
tial in over-all mortality reaches a maximum in
1 ho age group of 20 to 24 years, being 7.2 times
as much for young men as for young women in
connection with motor vehicles.
The facts suggest that certain means common
ly adopted by young men for release of tensions
are highly self-destructive of Ihe group. In some
cases the deaths and injuries are associated with
racing along the highways. Insofar as deliberate
choices of the participants are involved, I would
like to know whether the Stanford Honor Code
applies to the use of courteous and safe driving
practices by Stanford students when Ihey are off
the campus.
Insofar as less conscio\is behavior is involved,
we may recognize that the atmosphere at Stan
ford University is stimulating and also tension
creating, only part of the latter of which is re
leased at football games. An important contrib
utor to unhealthy academic and social tensions,
particularly among male students at Stanford, is
ihe artificial social-intellectual environment cre
ated by the admission of two to three times as
many men as women students and the appoint
ment of at least 20 times as many men as women
1o the faculty and Ihe policy-determining admin
istration.
Sex discriminatory ratios are maintained at
Stanford by male administrators and trustees
with the objective of giving special privilege to
members of their own sex. Masculinism, like
racism — the other large-group discrimination
based on birth-determined characteristics- has a
boomerang component, however. The price of
special privilege in educational opportunities dis
regarding individual qualifications is paid for by
those for whom benefits are intended as well as
by those who are discriminated against. The un
desirable academic and social tensions created by
Stanford's sex - discriminatory ratios are recog
nized by Stanford's most competent faculty mem
bers in psychology and education and other fields
who have considered the matter.
It should be remembered that the Stanford
ratio is not a decision of the Stanford faculty, and
that the students, alumni and alumnae as groups
have not been consulted. The Faculty Admissions
Committee is simply told to determine which ap
plicants shall be admitted according to a pre
determined ratio which they have had no hand
in deciding, and residence facilities are assigned
and built to conform to a predetermined ratio
without regard to the essential equality in num
bers of men and women qualified for admission.

Ke-clefine Imperialism
J >1 it or. The Daily:
Said Mr. Spaak, "If the establishment of Ihe
Russian satellites is not imperialism, then we
must redefine the word."
II the next task of Mr. Spaak is to build a new
dictionary, he should in the foreword redefine his
own position first. For when he says that Mr.
Khrushchev is "sincere," I start to wonder wheth
er Mr. Spaak is the right man for an accurate
European language. His concept of sincerity is,
at least, fairly loose [sic], and his speech last
Wednesday proved it well enough.
For, if I understood well, did not he say that
Christianity was the banner of the free world?
In the youth of Mr. Spaak a previous socialist
premier of Belgium, influent [sic] member of the
party . . . ! Let me smile slightly at the picture
of this lately-converted Christianity torchbearer.
If truly the Communist world can be presented as
ihe Antichrist, then Mr. Spaak has longer worked
for it than against it. For Ihose who remember
ihe climate of violent passion in Belgium a few
years ago when a project of law was to be passed
which would hav§ suppressed completely the

financial support to the Catholic schools, this
conversion seems miraculous.
For, who was the sponsor of this law if not Ihe
Socialist party of which he was the head? How
better could he work against Christianity lhan
by making its teaching impossible? And where
are his concepts of individual freedom when he
would guide the whole youth through a single
teaching, namely, an antireligious, socialist so
called chumenism [sic] ?
Why, all of a sudden, make synonymous two
different worlds, the capitalist world on one hand
and the free world on the other hand, when they
are not? I feel deeply that I belong to Ihe free
world, but I certainly do not adhere to the capi
talist one. I do not "believe" that Mr. Spaak did
not make this confusion willingly when in ihe
past he probably got elected by promising his
electors the defeat of capitalism.
I do not understand unless a hidden conversion,
necessary inside NATO, occurred. "Paris vaut
bien une messe."
Mr. Spaak's new dictionary won't be a best
seller.
