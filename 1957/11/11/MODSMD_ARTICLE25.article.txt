# Chuck Denies 'Quit' Story; USC Doesn't Care to Help
## 
### Dick Barrios Sports Editor Steve Baffrey 
Chuck Taylor emphatically de
nied Saturday that he was think
ing of resigning as Indian foot
hall coach. As a prelude to a post
game press conference in Los An
geles, he said:
"In regard to rumors which
have spread, I categorically deny
that 1 have any intention of re
signing at the end of this season."
The youthful mentor then shut
Die door on further talk about his
status and gol down to a discus
sion of his team's decisive 35-7
victory over I ISC.
Three Straight
The win, of course, was a,pleas
ant one for Taylor, and it marked
the third straight year he has
beaten Troy. He "didn't like to
see I he score run up so high, but
somelimes it's inevitable."
Taylor wouldn't single out any
one Indian for praise, but said
ihey all did a good job. He went
on to say that, this year's Stanford
club is ihe best team he has ever
had in regard to "intenseness,
willingness and desire to play."
A close game had been antici
pator) by Taylor, but, of course,
it didn't turn out that way. He
1 bought SC coach Don Clark had
set up good defenses for the Cards
bul then Stanford found the
weakness around Troy's ends and
proceeded to take full advantage.
No matter what the USC de
fenses or patterns, the game boil
ed down to the fact that "Don
[Clark] just didn't have too much
out there," he said.
The five-for-five in the Stanford
P.A.T. department came in for
comment, and Taylor was natu
rally pleased. He reiterated his
claim, however, that "the P.A.T.
does nothing to determine the
merits of two teams."
More P.A.T. Talk
Talking more about the conver
sion situation, Taylor said that
practice does not necessarily make
a kicker better.
He also refused to look ahead
1o the Rose Bowl and the faint
chance Stanford has to play in it.
He said the Cards were only look
ing ahead to Saturday's game
with Oregon State in Corvallis.

"We aren't at all interested in
putting Stanford in the Rose
Bowl," Southern California head
coach Don Clark told a handful
of writers after his Trojans had
just been embarrassed by the In
dians to a 35-7 tune.
The comment came after men
tion of Oregon's loss to Washing
ton Saturday and the Trojans' up
coming game with the Ducks.
"Still," he said, "we could help
to do it, I suppose. If all goes
well for us this week in practice,
| we plan to give them trouble."
Mention of ihe still-touchy sub
ject of ineligible seniors cropped
up throughout Clark's post-game
talk. "Stanford is the best bal
anced club in the conference," he
said. "And they have nine start
ing seniors with plenty of experi
ence."
Can't Do It
And another barb on the same
subject: "They had as experienc
ed personnel playing at the end
as we started with." And in an
other vein: "Look at Douglas. As
sophomore and junior he plays a
little bit and understudies a guy
like John Brodie. Then in his sen
ior year he's ready to go full time.
We'd like to be able to do that,
too."
Although he wanted to make
i clear that the 35-7 walk-over was
1 not one of his team's best efforts,
he pulled no other punches in
! praising the Injuns: "That club
loses no time in finding your
weaknesses and then really taking
advantage of them.
"It just seemed that everything
worked for them, too."
About his team's performance
i this season, the Trojan mentor
noted: "We need more work. We
had injuries and sickness, but
j that's not necessarily the reason
we lost. We haven't had a full
team, mentally and physically,
I yet.
According to Clark, the Stan
ford squad can look forward to a
win over Oregon State 1 his Satur
day in Corvallis. Stanford has a
much better offense, he feels, and
"Stanford can contain Oregon
State but Oregon State will nev
er contain Stanford."

out there," he said.
The five-for-five in the Stanford
P.A.T. department came in for
comment, and Taylor was natu
rally pleased. He reiterated his
claim, however, that "the P.A.T.
does nothing to determine the
merits of two teams."
More P.A.T. Talk
Talking more about the conver
sion situation, Taylor said that
practice does not necessarily make
a kicker better.
He also refused to look ahead
1o the Rose Bowl and the faint
chance Stanford has to play in it.
He said the Cards were only look
ing ahead to Saturday's game
with Oregon State in Corvallis.

"We aren't at all interested in
putting Stanford in the Rose
Bowl," Southern California head
coach Don Clark told a handful
of writers after his Trojans had
just been embarrassed by the In
dians to a 35-7 tune.
The comment came after men
tion of Oregon's loss to Washing
ton Saturday and the Trojans' up
coming game with the Ducks.
"Still," he said, "we could help
to do it, I suppose. If all goes
well for us this week in practice,
| we plan to give them trouble."
Mention of ihe still-touchy sub
ject of ineligible seniors cropped
up throughout Clark's post-game
talk. "Stanford is the best bal
anced club in the conference," he
said. "And they have nine start
ing seniors with plenty of experi
ence."
Can't Do It
And another barb on the same
subject: "They had as experienc
ed personnel playing at the end
as we started with." And in an
other vein: "Look at Douglas. As
sophomore and junior he plays a
little bit and understudies a guy
like John Brodie. Then in his sen
ior year he's ready to go full time.
We'd like to be able to do that,
too."
Although he wanted to make
i clear that the 35-7 walk-over was
1 not one of his team's best efforts,
he pulled no other punches in
! praising the Injuns: "That club
loses no time in finding your
weaknesses and then really taking
advantage of them.
"It just seemed that everything
worked for them, too."
About his team's performance
i this season, the Trojan mentor
noted: "We need more work. We
had injuries and sickness, but
j that's not necessarily the reason
we lost. We haven't had a full
team, mentally and physically,
I yet.
According to Clark, the Stan
ford squad can look forward to a
win over Oregon State 1 his Satur
day in Corvallis. Stanford has a
much better offense, he feels, and
"Stanford can contain Oregon
State but Oregon State will nev
er contain Stanford."
Chuck Taylor emphatically de
nied Saturday that he was think
ing of resigning as Indian foot
hall coach. As a prelude to a post
game press conference in Los An
geles, he said:
"In regard to rumors which
have spread, I categorically deny
that 1 have any intention of re
signing at the end of this season."
The youthful mentor then shut
Die door on further talk about his
status and gol down to a discus
sion of his team's decisive 35-7
victory over I ISC.
Three Straight
The win, of course, was a,pleas
ant one for Taylor, and it marked
the third straight year he has
beaten Troy. He "didn't like to
see I he score run up so high, but
somelimes it's inevitable."
Taylor wouldn't single out any
one Indian for praise, but said
ihey all did a good job. He went
on to say that, this year's Stanford
club is ihe best team he has ever
had in regard to "intenseness,
willingness and desire to play."
A close game had been antici
pator) by Taylor, but, of course,
it didn't turn out that way. He
1 bought SC coach Don Clark had
set up good defenses for the Cards
bul then Stanford found the
weakness around Troy's ends and
proceeded to take full advantage.

subject: "They had as experienc
ed personnel playing at the end
as we started with." And in an
other vein: "Look at Douglas. As
sophomore and junior he plays a
little bit and understudies a guy
like John Brodie. Then in his sen
ior year he's ready to go full time.
We'd like to be able to do that,
too."
Although he wanted to make
i clear that the 35-7 walk-over was
1 not one of his team's best efforts,
he pulled no other punches in
! praising the Injuns: "That club
loses no time in finding your
weaknesses and then really taking
advantage of them.
"It just seemed that everything
worked for them, too."
About his team's performance
i this season, the Trojan mentor
noted: "We need more work. We
had injuries and sickness, but
j that's not necessarily the reason
we lost. We haven't had a full
team, mentally and physically,
I yet.
According to Clark, the Stan
ford squad can look forward to a
win over Oregon State 1 his Satur
day in Corvallis. Stanford has a
much better offense, he feels, and
"Stanford can contain Oregon
State but Oregon State will nev
er contain Stanford."
Chuck Taylor emphatically de
nied Saturday that he was think
ing of resigning as Indian foot
hall coach. As a prelude to a post
game press conference in Los An
geles, he said:
"In regard to rumors which
have spread, I categorically deny
that 1 have any intention of re
signing at the end of this season."
The youthful mentor then shut
Die door on further talk about his
status and gol down to a discus
sion of his team's decisive 35-7
victory over I ISC.
Three Straight
The win, of course, was a,pleas
ant one for Taylor, and it marked
the third straight year he has
beaten Troy. He "didn't like to
see I he score run up so high, but
somelimes it's inevitable."
Taylor wouldn't single out any
one Indian for praise, but said
ihey all did a good job. He went
on to say that, this year's Stanford
club is ihe best team he has ever
had in regard to "intenseness,
willingness and desire to play."
A close game had been antici
pator) by Taylor, but, of course,
it didn't turn out that way. He
1 bought SC coach Don Clark had
set up good defenses for the Cards
bul then Stanford found the
weakness around Troy's ends and
proceeded to take full advantage.
No matter what the USC de
fenses or patterns, the game boil
ed down to the fact that "Don
[Clark] just didn't have too much
out there," he said.
The five-for-five in the Stanford
P.A.T. department came in for
comment, and Taylor was natu
rally pleased. He reiterated his
claim, however, that "the P.A.T.
does nothing to determine the
merits of two teams."
More P.A.T. Talk
Talking more about the conver
sion situation, Taylor said that
practice does not necessarily make
a kicker better.
He also refused to look ahead
1o the Rose Bowl and the faint
chance Stanford has to play in it.
He said the Cards were only look
ing ahead to Saturday's game
with Oregon State in Corvallis.

"We aren't at all interested in
putting Stanford in the Rose
Bowl," Southern California head
coach Don Clark told a handful
of writers after his Trojans had
just been embarrassed by the In
dians to a 35-7 tune.
The comment came after men
tion of Oregon's loss to Washing
ton Saturday and the Trojans' up
coming game with the Ducks.
"Still," he said, "we could help
to do it, I suppose. If all goes
well for us this week in practice,
| we plan to give them trouble."
Mention of ihe still-touchy sub
ject of ineligible seniors cropped
up throughout Clark's post-game
talk. "Stanford is the best bal
anced club in the conference," he
said. "And they have nine start
ing seniors with plenty of experi
ence."
