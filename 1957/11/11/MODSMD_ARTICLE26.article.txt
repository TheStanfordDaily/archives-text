### Alan Miller 
An uninspired Stanford frosh
football team was edged, 19-13. by
UCLA here Saturday. The Pa
pooses jumped off to a 7-0 lead,
but. then allowed the Brubabes to
make all three of their TD's in the
first half.
Stanford's first score came 5
minutes 16 seconds into the game.
Chris Knott took a 38-yard pass
from quarterback Rod Sears and
sprinted past UCLA back Dean
Moore into the end zone. End
Larry Meyer converted.
Two minutes later high-step-
Moore hit Mike Noyes with a 13-
yard pass on the 12, and Noyes
sped flown the sidelines into pay
dirt. Center Bob Atkinson block
ed Noyes' conversion attempt as
Stanford held a 7-6 first-quarter
lead.
Brubabes Take Lead
In the second stanza UCLA
went ahead, 12-7, when Moore
connected with Bob Williams from
the 25 for another touchdown.
Moore's conversion attempt was
wide.
With 30 seconds left in the half,
Moore, running from a fullback
flanker formation, bolted over
left tackle for 9 yards and a score.
He also added the conversion for
a 19-7 margin.
The Papooses held Moore & Co.
scoreless for the rest of the game,
but the damage had already been
done.
Stanford made a comeback in
the fourth quarter, driving 62
yards to a touchdown. Right half
Pete Witter smashed over from
the 1, and Meyer's conversion
was wide.
Dovvd Hurt
Injury of ace Papoose fullback
Gil Dovvd in the early minutes of
the game definitely hurt the
squad. He is resting in Palo Alto
Hospital for observation with a
Charley horse in his thigh. He
will probably be out of action for
the rest of the season.
Bob Ghilotti, Stanford mentor,
said that what hurt the team were
little mistakes like penalties at
crucial times, pass interceptions,
poor tackling and lack of team
spirit when the chips were down.
Fewer Mature I'layers
"We just don't have as many
mature players from high school
as other frosh squads do," added
Ghilotti. "There are too many in
dividuals who don't get the idea
of playing for the team. Our spir
it fluctuated instead of being at
a constant height.
"After this week's practice Ihe
boys should get to know each oth
er better, will realize the value of
the team as a working unit and
will see that spirit must he kept
up especially when the chips are
down."
