SAN FRANCISCO (#>) â€” The j
powerful Presidents' Council of
the Pacific Coast Conference yes
terday appi'oved in principle four i
i of five points asked by the Uni
; versifies of California and South
-1 ern California.
They reached no decision on
the knotty scheduling problem.
The University of California,
including the campuses at Berke
ley and Los Angeles, with USC
demanded scheduling of football
games on free choice and not
under the round robin required
by the conference. The present
rule calls for each team, except
Idaho, to play each other's foot
ball team annually.
General Agreement
President Robert G. Sproul of
California, council chairman, said
agreement in general was reached
on points covering scholastic eli
gibility. tuition grants-in-aid, sub
sistence grants-in-aid and wage
rates, and institutional responsi
bility for rule enforcement.
Dr. Sproul described the seven
hour 10-minule session as "the
most peaceable discussion I've sat
in on on in a long time on this
subject."
Asked if there was discussion
of press predictions Idaho might
withdraw or be dropped, he said
"there was no discussion of it at
all."
No Decision Seen
Dr. Sproul further indicated
that any decision on California or
UCLA leaving the conference was
not in the near future.
"I can't conceive of Ihe Uni-
I versity of California [including

UCLA] withdrawing from the
conference without further dis
cussion with the presidents," he
said.

No date has boon sot for the
next council meeting. The confer
once itself will meet here Dec.
1 to 5.
