# THE 						PAST SPEAKS
## Doctor Views Flu History 
### Dave Quarles 
In discussing the Asian flu, Dr.
George Houck emphasized the
importance of empirical knowl
edge gained through history. "If
history has any validity," said
Dr. Houck, "this is one case
where its application is vital to
everyone."
Dr. Houck explained that med
ical science is coping this year
with a pandemic of influenza or
world-wide spread of the disease.
It is not an epidemic or local rise
of disease. "Because these pan
demics of influenza have oc
curred more than once, we have a
basis for conjecture which can
aid us in prevention."
Serious Attack
In the period of 1917-1918 a
! very serious attack of influenza
j spread over the world. This pan
i demic resulted in the deaths of
j an estimated 20 million people.
Most fatalities were due to bac
terial complications.
Using history as a guide, Dr.
Houck pointed out that every
pandemic has followed the basic
pattern of three successive
waves.
"In general, the first wave hits
a large number of people. The
influenza is mild, causing few
complications and no deaths.
Stanford has just passed through

| a first wave with all of these
characteristics."
Interval Varies
Dr. Houck explained that the
interval between the first and
second waves varies according to
climate, season of the year and
the activities and living condi
tions of the persons concerned.
"Some think our second wave
will come in February and some
think next fall. The one thing we
are sure of is that there will be
a second wave."
The characteristics of the sec
ond wave have been consistently
serious. There are fewer cases,
but the cases are severe. Bacte
rial complications are prevalent,
and there are quite a few deaths.
The third wave's earmarks are
a little more indefinite. In the
19th century the third wave was
very mild. The third wave of the
1917-1918 pandemic was severe.
"What our third wave will be like
is still a question mark," con
cluded Dr. Houck. "Our main
concern at present is preparing
for the coming second wave."
First Not Bad
"The first wave is not bad for
the individual, although some
times catastrophic for organiza
tions. However, tho second wavq
is of supreme importance to the
individual because his life is
threatened."

Deaths generally are caused by
bacterial complications such as
pneumonia which result from the
attack of influenza. "Of course
we have antibiotic drugs which
will combat these complications.
However, immunity to these
drugs and the speed of bacterial
growth warn us not to be confi
dent at all," Dr. Houck empha
sized.
The best protection is to gain
immunity to a disease, and im
munity can be gained only
through having the disease and
through inoculation.
One of the dangers of the so
called Asian strain of influenza
is that it is very ineffective in
producing antibodies, making
even those who suffered the dis
ease during the first wave vulner
able to a second and more seri
ous attack.
"Because of the great danger
of the second wave, the Health
Service is offering a two-shot vac
cination to all members of the
Stanford family. This vaccina
tion gives the most immunity
possible at the present time, and
it should be taken by all faculty
and students, including those who
have had the disease," Dr. Houck
said.
About 4000 injections have been
given in the past three weeks.
This is 40 per cent of the Health
Service's 10,000 injection goal. In
jections will continue to be given
this week every afternoon from
3 to 4:45.
