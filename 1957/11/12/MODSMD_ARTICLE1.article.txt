# Irish Writer Guest Speaker On Tuesday Series Bill Tonight
## â€˜Why Don't I Write About America?' Set As Topic of Address by Frank O'Connor 
### 
Frank O'Connor, Irish short-story writer, will answer the question
"Why don't you write about America?" tonight at the Tuesday Eve
ning Lecture Series in Memorial Hall Auditorium at 7:30.
O'Connor's insight and compassion have won him a host of U.S.
I'an.s. and he has become best known through his stories in the

New Yorker magazine. He has
been described by his friends as
"a handsome man, with charming
accent, a contagious sparkle and
the wit of the true Irishman."
He was born an County Cork in
1903 to a family too poor to afford
a college education for him, but
his literary talent was indicated
when he put together, at the age
of 12, a "collected edition" of his
poems, biographies and essays on
Irish history. His early pen name
was "Michael O'Donovan."
His first published work, print
ed in 1931. was a volume of short
stories entitled "Guest of the Na
tion." The title story of this vol
ume was reprinted in the Atlantic
Monthly and marked his first ap
pearance in a U.S. magazine.
O'Connor will also appear to
read one of his short stories in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium tomorrow
at. 4:15 p.m. under auspices of the
Stanford Creative Writing Center.
The public is invited.
