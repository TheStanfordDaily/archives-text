NEW YORK (/P) â€”Former Re
publican President Herbert Hoo
ver, from the promontory of his
83 years, surveyed the American
scene yesterday and concluded:
"I have lived a long time and
I have seen our country exert its
strengths to overcome as great
dangers as those which beset us
today."
Without mentioning Soviet
Russia's accomplishments in out
er space, Hoover told the 49th an
nual meeting of the Grocery Man
ufacturers of America:
"We possess many eminent sci
entists and engineers of great
ability and ingenuity. We have
more research laboratories in ac
tion than all the rest of the world
put together.
"Our country has had a great
warning. It is on the alert.
"I have no doubt of our ability
to invent any . . . horrible weapon
necessary to deter our enemy."
Hoover said Russian techni
cians deserve our respect. But lie
declared that most of their scien
tific know-how has been bor
rowed from the United States,
Britain, Germany and France.
He continued:
"But with our own discoveries
and our productive capacity, our
country has risen to a position of
effective retaliation to any irre
sponsible nation which might
contemplate attacking us."
Hoover called it "a worm's eye
view" to suggest that America is
entering its decline and fall. A
bird's eye view, he added, would
disclose the "growing strength of
our nation."
