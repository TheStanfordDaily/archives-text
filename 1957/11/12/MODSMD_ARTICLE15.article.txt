# Project Vanguard's Chief Urges Program to Send Man in Space
## U.S. Not Ready To Insure Safe Return to Earth Fate of Pooch Unsure; Bulganin Says Alive, Scientist Says Dead 
### 
WASHINGTON Dr. John
I P. Hagen, head of project Van
guard < devoted to launching a
fully instrumented satellite into
space), said yesterday the United
States should develop a well-co
ordinated program aimed at send
ing a man into space.
He estimated it would lake
years before a man could be sent
up with any chance of getting
back safely, and that meanwhile
I animal experiments must eon
j tinue.
The fate of Laika, the Russian
i dog, remained uncertain. Soviet.
Premier Bulganin told reporters
that radio signals indicated she
was still alive. A Russian physi
cist said, however, that she must
bo dead. This was based on the
Soviet report that the satellite
carried only eight days' food sup
ply.
Heat u Problem
Hagen said he would prefer to
send a rat or a monkey into space
because of the physiological simi
larity to man. Vanguard's chief
said one of the problems of man
ned space vehicles is re-entry into
the earth's atmosphere, where
friction creates intense heat.
He told newsmen he didn't:
know when the Army would at
tempt to launch a satellite with
its modified Jupiter-C missile. The
Army entered the project only
last Friday.
"Covering Your Bets"
i Hagen said it was rather late
i for Army men to enter the proj
ect, but it was nice to have them
I anyway. He said their efforts
! would serve as "a reserve ... a
! means of covering your bets."
Sputnik II was scheduled to
I make two passes over the United
States this morning. Radio Mos
cow reported that at 10 p.m. last
night it had made 124 revolutions,
and that Sputnik I had completed
i 576 trips around the earth, while
! the last stage of its rocket, which
is going slightly faster, had com
! pleted 579 orbits.
