# Toward a Useful Cabinet

### 
.ASSI! < UniNF/r met for the firsl lime this year
last 1 11tirs«li»y night. Kxccpt lor a run-down by
each member of the activities of his organiza
tion or class, nothing was accomplished.
As the meeting opened, ASSU president Jim
Alessinger set a high tone, warning that either
ihe (labinet must make itself a useful part of
I lie executive brunch of the student government
or il must die on the vine as did the last two
years" cabinets.
II the first meeting is any indication of future
meetings, then ASSI Cabinet will die on the
\ine and the whole idea should he completely
deleted from the ASSU constitution.
The Cabinet is a wholly advisory- organ,
having no legislative powers at all. The whole
purpose of a cabinet is to advise the president
on the attitudes of the various administrative
boards concerning various problems facing
these boards, and also the various classes. I n
fortunately, the heads of the various boards and
classes ran seldom see any fnrllier than their
own narrow jurisdiction.
The good of student government as a whole
is seldom considered l>\ them. Instead, they

take the attitude that what does not specifically
concern their own group has no real meaning
or interest for them.
The power of the Cabinet is a power of
opinion, and only that. The strong opinion of
an effectively coordinated and cohesive cabinet
is a great counterbalance to any inclination on
the part of ASSI Legislature to go overboard
in its legislation. Neither Legislature nor Cabi
net nor any organization, including The Daily,
is perfect.
If certain organizations continue to consider
only their own good and not the good of the
an hole student, body, then The Daily cannot
help but assign space in favor of the organiza
tions which do cater to the good of the student
hod y as a whole. This is only good journalism,
as The Daily is dedicated to serve the interests
of the student body as a whole.
\\ hen ASSU Cabinet next meets, it would be
well for the members to thoughtfully consider
the purpose of the Cabinet, and to at least
make attempts at cohesion and toward discov
ering the many difficulties that presently plague
near I \ all ASSL organizations,

concern their own group has no real meaning
or interest for them.
The power of the Cabinet is a power of
opinion, and only that. The strong opinion of
an effectively coordinated and cohesive cabinet
is a great counterbalance to any inclination on
the part of ASSI Legislature to go overboard
in its legislation. Neither Legislature nor Cabi
net nor any organization, including The Daily,
is perfect.
If certain organizations continue to consider
only their own good and not the good of the
an hole student, body, then The Daily cannot
help but assign space in favor of the organiza
tions which do cater to the good of the student
hod y as a whole. This is only good journalism,
as The Daily is dedicated to serve the interests
of the student body as a whole.

.ASSI! < UniNF/r met for the firsl lime this year
last 1 11tirs«li»y night. Kxccpt lor a run-down by
each member of the activities of his organiza
tion or class, nothing was accomplished.
As the meeting opened, ASSU president Jim
Alessinger set a high tone, warning that either
ihe (labinet must make itself a useful part of
I lie executive brunch of the student government
or il must die on the vine as did the last two
years" cabinets.
II the first meeting is any indication of future
meetings, then ASSI Cabinet will die on the
\ine and the whole idea should he completely
deleted from the ASSU constitution.
The Cabinet is a wholly advisory- organ,
having no legislative powers at all. The whole
purpose of a cabinet is to advise the president
on the attitudes of the various administrative
boards concerning various problems facing
these boards, and also the various classes. I n
fortunately, the heads of the various boards and
classes ran seldom see any fnrllier than their
own narrow jurisdiction.
The good of student government as a whole
is seldom considered l>\ them. Instead, they

take the attitude that what does not specifically
concern their own group has no real meaning
or interest for them.
