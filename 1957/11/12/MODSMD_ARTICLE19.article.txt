# THE 						INTERNATIONAL SCENE-By IIR Political Analysts
## America and the European Common Market 
### 
When Mr. Spaak was here two weeks ago, we
were reminded of the European Common Mar
ket Treaty; but the difficulties preventing appli
cation of that treaty were not mentioned. This
article will try to describe the present tensions,
and also try to point out where the American
interest lies.
The plan presently calls for a common market
with no internal tariffs or restrictions to em
brace Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Belgium
and Luxembourg. There is a second free trade
area plan which will give other countries, par
ticularly Great Britain, tariff-free access to the
main European market. The expected gains from
ihe market are the abolition of monopolies and
protectionism with a consequent stimulus to ef
ficiency. and a possible production increase on
ihe part of industry to a much larger scale than
was hitherto possible.
The country most strongly in favor of the
plan is Germany, which would have a tremen
dous opportunity to expand her exports; this, in
itself, makes France fearful of seeing some of
hor industries decline under competition. France,
in fact, will not expose herself to German compe
tition alone and demands that Great Britain be
connected with the area to counterbalance Ger
many.
Great Britain, in turn, cannot afford to let a
market develop without being connected with it,
but because of her political ties with the Com
monwealth, many British people do not want to
be linked closely with Europe. This is false rea
soning because the economic value of Common
wealth trade is becoming less important; but,
nevertheless, the feeling against becoming linked
with Europe exists.
Holland has become less keen on the common
market, because she would not be able to expand
her agricultural exports as much as had been
expected. Italy wants an investment fund cre
ated to help in the development of southern

Italy. France wants Iho market to bo open to j
Ihe goods from hor colonies, and wants an in-,
vestment fund created to assist in their develop- 1
ment; the present weak state of the French econ- ;
omy makes her unwilling to lake on this further -
commitment.
The above points indicate that the countries
are very much in the common market scheme
for what they can get out of it: and France
is ihe country whose decisions will determine
whether or not the treaty is applied next year.
If France applies Ihe treaty, the other countries
would not lose by joining the market scheme,
and Great Britain will be forced to link herself
with them to preserve her European markets.
The other European countries, without France,
are not strong enough eilher to have a market
without her, or to enforce acceptance upon
France.
America's interest in this is very clear: all
measures to increase European wealth and
strength are to America's political benefit in
giving her less dependent and more useful allies.
More specifically, the closer identification of
interests between the nations of Europe would
lead to easier political co-operation between
them. This is a very good check against "devia
tion" such as the Suez venture, which harmed
European nations other than just Great Britain
and France.
West Germany would become fully integrated
into the Western European economy, which
would act as a guarantee against a strong, rela
tively independent Germany attempting to gain
unification of Germany by pursuing policies not
in accord with the interests of other Western Eu
ropean nations.
The urop e a n common market would
strengthen and unite Western Europe, and link
West Germany clearly with the rest of Western
Europe. On all these grounds it is in America's
interest to give what support she can to the de
velopment of the common market scheme.
