# Syria Jittery At Turk Action
## 
### 
DAMASCUS, Syria (JP)â€”Syria
put on a new show of war jitters
yesterday after the army report
ed unusually large Turkish troop
movements along the northern
frontier.
An army spokesman described
the Turkish movements as "large
scale, night-long, unusual and un
precedented." As a result of Ihe
army reports, Syrian troop units
in the north were put on alert,
and the Syrian cabinet held a Iwo
hour meeting in the middle of the
night.
Turkey, however, has repeat
edly denied any aggressive inten
tions, and has explained that her
troop arrangements arc for her
own security because of Syria's
increasing friendliness with Mos
cow.
High excitement was also gen
erated by mass street demonstra
tions and new editorial attacks
against Hussein of Jordan, king
of the brother Arab state to the
south. Speakers and editorials
accused him of betraying Arab
nationalism and threatened him
with liquidation.
Developments which otherwise
could presage a new crest of the
Middle East crisis were some
what balanced, however, by un
confirmed reports from Arab
sources at the United Nations iti
New York that Syria and the
United States had agreed on
steps to improve their relations.
