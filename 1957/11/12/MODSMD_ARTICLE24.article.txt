# ‘BEST FOR THE MOST
## ASSU Prexy Working Toward Common Goal 
### Dare Quarles 
Born in Monterey, Calif., Jim Messlnger heads up Stanford's stu
dent government as president of the Associated Students of Stanford
University.
Jim, as chief executive of the ASSU, tries to keep student govern
ment running smoothly toward a common goal. In his words, this

goal is "doing the greatest good
for the most number of people."
As an individaul, Jim likes va
riety. Among other things in the
past three years, he has served
on the freshman Excom, been a
sponsor at Wilbur and has served
on numerous committees.
In the future. Jim plans to be a
medical doctor. He is majoring in
biology and pre-med. However,
medicine has not overshadowed
Jim in his stay at Stanford, for he
has sampled economics, the clas
sics and languages and has found
them all interesting.
A member of Alpha Sigma Phi,
Jim enjoys fraternity life in con
trast to a demanding schedule he
has to follow daily.
Jim's main hangout is his office
in the Student Union. However,
when he escapes for a few min
utes, you will find him listening
to music—classical and jazz—see- j
ing movie musicals and reading !
Time magazine.
Pet-peeve-less, Jim's only dis
satisfaction is that he does not j
have more time to meel more peo
ple personally, an occupation ho
has learned 1o enjoy through his J
work with the ASSU.
