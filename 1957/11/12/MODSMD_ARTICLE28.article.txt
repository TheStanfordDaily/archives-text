### Frank Huntress 
Weekend Full of Sporl Slories
This was a red-letter weekend for the Stanford sports enthusiast.
Publications and radio sportcasts were full of rumors, half-truths
and speculations which sent the Indian "red hot" off in all directions
making one rationalization after another.
Rumors and half-truths concerned the alleged changes to take
place in the hierarchy of the Athletic Department. A speech by a
former assistant coach blew up a storm in the Los Angeles area.
Oregon's loss to Washington sent the "dreamers" to believe Stanford
would represent the PCC in the Rose Bowl. And, last hut not least,
was the article in Life magazine on the college student's apathy
toward today's football hero. Here are five of the items which broke
this weekend:
1. Athletic Director A 1 Masters will retire because of ill health.
Football Coach Chuck Taylor will replace him and 49er Coach
Frunkie Albert will be given the first crack at the Indian coaching
job, according to rumors.
2. Then, after Masters said that his physical condition was much
improved and that he had no intention of retiring, a front page pic
lure of Coach Chuck with the line "Planning to Retire?" appeared
in Ihe Palo Alto Times last Friday afternoon.
Taylor has been quoted during the past few years as having the
desire to "gel out of this crazy business." But most writers believe

that he will not be coaching foot
ball next year. They think he will
lake over Masters' position if the
latter retires and if he doesn't,
Ihen Taylor will become assistant
athletic director until Masters
steps down.
3. In a Friday speech, Associ
ate General Secretary Joe Ruelz
was quoted as saying (which he
later denied) that he expected
"drastic action" by the PCC pres
idents in their meeting Sunday.
Also lie was quoted as saying
Stanford would be better off out
of the 42-year-old PCC. Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling

said that Ruetz's remarks were solely his own. .Ruetz, who was an
assistant coach in charge of the lino last year, made his speech in
ihe Los Angeles area.
<1. After hearing that Washington had upset Oregon, some Indian
rooters and most of the newspapers jumped in to say that Stanford
"has ;i flickering hope" to go to the Rose Bowl.
This "hope" is "wishful thinking." Oregon plays push-over IJSC
next weekend and Oregon State in its final "big game." They must
lose BOTH of these games, while Stanford MUST win over Oregon
State this weekend and Cal the next. This is too much to hope for.
The Ducks now have a 51 PCC record and the Indians stand with a
'i 2 mark. And since ihcy squeaked by Stanford, 27-26, the Ducks
would got the nod if both teams finished the season losing two con
ference games—Oregon would have a 6-2 record and Stanford, a 5-2
record. Oregon's win over Idaho will not count toward the Rose
Rowl selection in either case.
5. Life magazine printed a feature entitled "The Football Hero
Isn't a Hero" in which fullback Chuck Shea was given as an example
ol ihe rooters' apathy.
"Life" Tells Shea Yarn
Life tells the story that Shea limped into his history class on the
Monday morning following the Rice game and eased himself into
Jlis chair next to a coed who had been sitting next to him since the
beginning of the quarter. She asked him about his leg.
Sh**a was reported to have answered: "Ciot it down In Texas
this weekend."
"In Texas?" said the girl. "Did you go down there to see the
game?"
"I saw a little of it,"he said.
He was said to have commented later, "Sure, she's a pretty one,
and maybe worth getting to know better. But around here you
don't impress anybody by bragging about being a football player."
Shea, in an interview with The Daily yesterday, said that a man
from Life did ask him a few questions. He didn't know where the
writer found out about the incident. When asked about whether the
coed really thought he didn't play in the game, the fullback replied,
"I don't exactly remember, but I don't think so. That's just how he
wrote it. I didn't say she was pretty or that stuff."
Life points out that the last great national football hero was
SMU's Doak Walker. And that the attitude today "is far removed
from the golden days when great Stanford Indians like Ernie Nevers
and Frankie Albert could flaunt their varsity sweaters and other
emblems of their trade as badges of prestige." The stars of today
know better, the articlc said. "If they do not. they soon learn." Life
tells the story of one halfback who wore his letter jacket around
the fraternity house until his brothers showed up for dinner one
night wearing sweat shirts with the halfback's number on them.
As the magazine said, "He got the point."
Even The Daily was mentioned as being "concerned lest such de
bunking of football players go too far." According to the picture
magazine, The Daily "is trying to counteract it by running regular
features, complete with pictures and biographical data, entitled
"Know Your Indians."
By the way, that particular column appears today, and its "real"
purpose is to acquaint rooters with what the different players look
like (providing the photographer doesn't make the picture a blob of
fog) and give them an idea of their capabilities.
GUESS WHO?—In the same Life article on football players ap
peared this remark: "When one big West Coast star was caught
cheating in a final exam last year, it was a coed who turned him
in. He left school without any outcry from either male or female
students, a thing that could not have happened two decades ago."

"I don't exactly remember, but I don't think so. That's just how he
wrote it. I didn't say she was pretty or that stuff."
Life points out that the last great national football hero was
SMU's Doak Walker. And that the attitude today "is far removed
from the golden days when great Stanford Indians like Ernie Nevers
and Frankie Albert could flaunt their varsity sweaters and other
emblems of their trade as badges of prestige." The stars of today
know better, the articlc said. "If they do not. they soon learn." Life
tells the story of one halfback who wore his letter jacket around
the fraternity house until his brothers showed up for dinner one
night wearing sweat shirts with the halfback's number on them.
As the magazine said, "He got the point."
Even The Daily was mentioned as being "concerned lest such de
bunking of football players go too far." According to the picture
magazine, The Daily "is trying to counteract it by running regular
features, complete with pictures and biographical data, entitled
"Know Your Indians."
By the way, that particular column appears today, and its "real"
purpose is to acquaint rooters with what the different players look
like (providing the photographer doesn't make the picture a blob of
fog) and give them an idea of their capabilities.
GUESS WHO?—In the same Life article on football players ap
peared this remark: "When one big West Coast star was caught
cheating in a final exam last year, it was a coed who turned him
in. He left school without any outcry from either male or female
students, a thing that could not have happened two decades ago."
Weekend Full of Sporl Slories
This was a red-letter weekend for the Stanford sports enthusiast.
Publications and radio sportcasts were full of rumors, half-truths
and speculations which sent the Indian "red hot" off in all directions
making one rationalization after another.
Rumors and half-truths concerned the alleged changes to take
place in the hierarchy of the Athletic Department. A speech by a
former assistant coach blew up a storm in the Los Angeles area.
Oregon's loss to Washington sent the "dreamers" to believe Stanford
would represent the PCC in the Rose Bowl. And, last hut not least,
was the article in Life magazine on the college student's apathy
toward today's football hero. Here are five of the items which broke
this weekend:
1. Athletic Director A 1 Masters will retire because of ill health.
Football Coach Chuck Taylor will replace him and 49er Coach
Frunkie Albert will be given the first crack at the Indian coaching
job, according to rumors.
2. Then, after Masters said that his physical condition was much
improved and that he had no intention of retiring, a front page pic
lure of Coach Chuck with the line "Planning to Retire?" appeared
in Ihe Palo Alto Times last Friday afternoon.
Taylor has been quoted during the past few years as having the
desire to "gel out of this crazy business." But most writers believe

that he will not be coaching foot
ball next year. They think he will
lake over Masters' position if the
latter retires and if he doesn't,
Ihen Taylor will become assistant
athletic director until Masters
steps down.
3. In a Friday speech, Associ
ate General Secretary Joe Ruelz
was quoted as saying (which he
later denied) that he expected
"drastic action" by the PCC pres
idents in their meeting Sunday.
Also lie was quoted as saying
Stanford would be better off out
of the 42-year-old PCC. Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling

said that Ruetz's remarks were solely his own. .Ruetz, who was an
assistant coach in charge of the lino last year, made his speech in
ihe Los Angeles area.
<1. After hearing that Washington had upset Oregon, some Indian
rooters and most of the newspapers jumped in to say that Stanford
"has ;i flickering hope" to go to the Rose Bowl.
This "hope" is "wishful thinking." Oregon plays push-over IJSC
next weekend and Oregon State in its final "big game." They must
lose BOTH of these games, while Stanford MUST win over Oregon
State this weekend and Cal the next. This is too much to hope for.
The Ducks now have a 51 PCC record and the Indians stand with a
'i 2 mark. And since ihcy squeaked by Stanford, 27-26, the Ducks
would got the nod if both teams finished the season losing two con
ference games—Oregon would have a 6-2 record and Stanford, a 5-2
record. Oregon's win over Idaho will not count toward the Rose
Rowl selection in either case.
5. Life magazine printed a feature entitled "The Football Hero
Isn't a Hero" in which fullback Chuck Shea was given as an example
ol ihe rooters' apathy.
"Life" Tells Shea Yarn
Life tells the story that Shea limped into his history class on the
Monday morning following the Rice game and eased himself into
Jlis chair next to a coed who had been sitting next to him since the
beginning of the quarter. She asked him about his leg.
Sh**a was reported to have answered: "Ciot it down In Texas
this weekend."
"In Texas?" said the girl. "Did you go down there to see the
game?"
"I saw a little of it,"he said.
He was said to have commented later, "Sure, she's a pretty one,
and maybe worth getting to know better. But around here you
don't impress anybody by bragging about being a football player."
Shea, in an interview with The Daily yesterday, said that a man
from Life did ask him a few questions. He didn't know where the
writer found out about the incident. When asked about whether the
coed really thought he didn't play in the game, the fullback replied,
"I don't exactly remember, but I don't think so. That's just how he
wrote it. I didn't say she was pretty or that stuff."

State this weekend and Cal the next. This is too much to hope for.
The Ducks now have a 51 PCC record and the Indians stand with a
'i 2 mark. And since ihcy squeaked by Stanford, 27-26, the Ducks
would got the nod if both teams finished the season losing two con
ference games—Oregon would have a 6-2 record and Stanford, a 5-2
record. Oregon's win over Idaho will not count toward the Rose
Rowl selection in either case.
5. Life magazine printed a feature entitled "The Football Hero
Isn't a Hero" in which fullback Chuck Shea was given as an example
ol ihe rooters' apathy.
"Life" Tells Shea Yarn
Life tells the story that Shea limped into his history class on the
Monday morning following the Rice game and eased himself into
Jlis chair next to a coed who had been sitting next to him since the
beginning of the quarter. She asked him about his leg.
Sh**a was reported to have answered: "Ciot it down In Texas
this weekend."
"In Texas?" said the girl. "Did you go down there to see the
game?"
"I saw a little of it,"he said.
He was said to have commented later, "Sure, she's a pretty one,
and maybe worth getting to know better. But around here you
don't impress anybody by bragging about being a football player."
Shea, in an interview with The Daily yesterday, said that a man
from Life did ask him a few questions. He didn't know where the
writer found out about the incident. When asked about whether the
coed really thought he didn't play in the game, the fullback replied,
"I don't exactly remember, but I don't think so. That's just how he
wrote it. I didn't say she was pretty or that stuff."
Life points out that the last great national football hero was
SMU's Doak Walker. And that the attitude today "is far removed
from the golden days when great Stanford Indians like Ernie Nevers
and Frankie Albert could flaunt their varsity sweaters and other
emblems of their trade as badges of prestige." The stars of today
know better, the articlc said. "If they do not. they soon learn." Life
tells the story of one halfback who wore his letter jacket around
the fraternity house until his brothers showed up for dinner one
night wearing sweat shirts with the halfback's number on them.
As the magazine said, "He got the point."
Even The Daily was mentioned as being "concerned lest such de
bunking of football players go too far." According to the picture
magazine, The Daily "is trying to counteract it by running regular
features, complete with pictures and biographical data, entitled
"Know Your Indians."
By the way, that particular column appears today, and its "real"
purpose is to acquaint rooters with what the different players look
like (providing the photographer doesn't make the picture a blob of
fog) and give them an idea of their capabilities.
GUESS WHO?—In the same Life article on football players ap
peared this remark: "When one big West Coast star was caught
cheating in a final exam last year, it was a coed who turned him
in. He left school without any outcry from either male or female
students, a thing that could not have happened two decades ago."
Weekend Full of Sporl Slories
This was a red-letter weekend for the Stanford sports enthusiast.
Publications and radio sportcasts were full of rumors, half-truths
and speculations which sent the Indian "red hot" off in all directions
making one rationalization after another.
Rumors and half-truths concerned the alleged changes to take
place in the hierarchy of the Athletic Department. A speech by a
former assistant coach blew up a storm in the Los Angeles area.
Oregon's loss to Washington sent the "dreamers" to believe Stanford
would represent the PCC in the Rose Bowl. And, last hut not least,
was the article in Life magazine on the college student's apathy
toward today's football hero. Here are five of the items which broke
this weekend:
1. Athletic Director A 1 Masters will retire because of ill health.
Football Coach Chuck Taylor will replace him and 49er Coach
Frunkie Albert will be given the first crack at the Indian coaching
job, according to rumors.
2. Then, after Masters said that his physical condition was much
improved and that he had no intention of retiring, a front page pic
lure of Coach Chuck with the line "Planning to Retire?" appeared
in Ihe Palo Alto Times last Friday afternoon.
Taylor has been quoted during the past few years as having the
desire to "gel out of this crazy business." But most writers believe

that he will not be coaching foot
ball next year. They think he will
lake over Masters' position if the
latter retires and if he doesn't,
Ihen Taylor will become assistant
athletic director until Masters
steps down.
3. In a Friday speech, Associ
ate General Secretary Joe Ruelz
was quoted as saying (which he
later denied) that he expected
"drastic action" by the PCC pres
idents in their meeting Sunday.
Also lie was quoted as saying
Stanford would be better off out
of the 42-year-old PCC. Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling

said that Ruetz's remarks were solely his own. .Ruetz, who was an
assistant coach in charge of the lino last year, made his speech in
ihe Los Angeles area.
<1. After hearing that Washington had upset Oregon, some Indian
rooters and most of the newspapers jumped in to say that Stanford
"has ;i flickering hope" to go to the Rose Bowl.
This "hope" is "wishful thinking." Oregon plays push-over IJSC
next weekend and Oregon State in its final "big game." They must
lose BOTH of these games, while Stanford MUST win over Oregon
State this weekend and Cal the next. This is too much to hope for.
