# BUT WILL KICK P.A.T.'S IN BIG GAME
## Harrington Out With Cracked Jaw 
### 
A 1 Harrington suffered a brok
en jaw last Saturday against USC.
This diagnosis was made yester
day afternoon following X-ray ex
aminations.
Harrington will not engage in
any contact work the rest of the
regular season and will not there
fore see action against Oregon
State this Saturday.
Trainer Connie J a r vi s said,
however, that the star halfback
would probably be ready to kick
P.A.T.'s in the Big Game.
Jarvis added, "Harrington will
be ready for post-season games,
such as the East-West Shrine
game."
Harrington was hurt,at the tag
end of the first half in the Trojan
game and was carried from the
field on a stretcher. He was at
first Ihought lo have just been
knocked out and hit in the teeth.
He had difficulty eating during
the balance of the week end, and
the X-rays were taken. Jarvis said
they were not taken sooner since
it was not an emergency case.
Broken Molar
The most serious phase of the
injury is a molar tooth which was
broken in half, leaving open the
possibility of infection. The jaw
break itself occurred directly un
der the molar on Harrington's
right side.
He will wear a brace inside his
mouth for three weeks and must
eat through a straw. His dental
problem will not be appraised
until after the brace is removed.
Coach Chuck Taylor said Jim
Byrer and Roy Stephen would
each move up a team to take Har
rington's place. Flanker back Jeri
McMillin will also learn the plays
and may take Harrington's place,
as the Indians strive to keep the
defensive backfield at its peak.
In addition to his running abil
ity, the Cards will miss Harring
ton's excellent blocking. Taylor
said Byrer and Stephen would get
lots of work on blocking this
week.
Aside from Harrington, the
most serious case on the Stanford
injury rolls is that of Gary Van
Galder.
Kidney Ailment
He won't suit up for a couple
of days, or until a kidney ailment
is diagnosed. He also has a broken
nose, received in the USC game,
but this alone wouldn't keep him
out of the Oregon State game.
Jarvis said that, except for Har
rington. the Tribe came out of
the Trojan game in better shape
than they went into it. The rest
of the report shows:
• John Clark and Joel Freis not
suited up because of colds.
• John Kidd recovering from a
shoulder he rehurt when he fell
on it Saturday.
• Russ Steele and Troy Barbee
continuing to improve following
knee injuries against UCLA.
• John Thomas and Don Ma
noukian much better than they
were last Friday.
Taylor sent the team through
only a light drill yesterday, con
centrating on setting defenses for
the Beavers. The Indians then
watched pictures of their victory

over the Trojans and OSC's 21-19
win over California.
At the regular luncheon session
of the Northern California Foot
ball Writers Assn. earlier yester
day Taylor said, "I think that Or
egon State right now is in the po
sition of being the top team in the
Pacific Coast Conference."
Defensive Reaction
He said that he feared the run
ning of the Oregon State crew of
Joe Francis, Earnel Durden and
Nub Beamer. "And the club has
a tremendous defensive reaction
and pursuit," he added.
About his team's convincing 35-
7 victory over Southern Califor
nia, Taylor said the loss of USC
halfback Rex Johnston and guard
Frank Fiorentino for the game
hurt USC.
He was asked again about re
ports that he would resign at the
end of this season. Taylor has
denied them, and yesterday he
sairl, "I am not commenting on
any more rumors that have been
spread." •
