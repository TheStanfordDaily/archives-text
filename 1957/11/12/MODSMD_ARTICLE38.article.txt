## ASSU Scholar from Holland Says Only Customs Vary Around World 
### Steve Freidberg 
"There are no real differences
between people in the world; there
are only differences in customs."
This is the belief of John Veltman,
an ASSU foreign scholar from the
Netherlands.
John comes from Hilversum,
which is 20 miles south of Am
sterdam and is the radio broad
casting center of Holland. During
the autumn quarter he is living
at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house.
He and Everardus Beers, also
here this year, are the fourth and
fifth foreign scholars at Stanford
from their school. "This is the
best scholarship we can apply
for," said John, explaining the in
terest in the program.
His school, the Nederlands Op
leidings Instituut voor het Buiten
land (the Dutch Institute for Rep
resentation Abroad) specializes in
a two-year course on business
commerce. He majored in eco
nomics while there and is in the
social sciences department here.
He intends to become a personnel
manager in industry when he re
turns to Holland.
High School
John attended a high school, or
lycee, for six years and was quite
active in extracurricular activi
ties. He was on a committee su
pervising all the school sports and
played on the basketball and soc

cer teams. He was editor of the
school magazine and participated
in the drama group and the choir.
In college he served as secre
tary of a French cultural organi
zation and was a member of the
soccer and basketball teams. He
held the position of deputy senior
prefect and was in charge of su
pervising and keeping discipline
in his dormitory.
Between high school and college
he was in the army medical corps
for two years as a second lieuten
ant, training medical soldiers in
infantry methods.
Favorite Activities
One of John's favorite activities
is singing folk songs in general
and French songs in particular.
He got this interest during his
many bicycle trip s to France.
Some of his selections were broad
cast over the Holland radio, and
he sang often at his college. He
hopes to start a vocal group here
to sing all types of songs.
Another big interest of his is
reading modern literature which
has a psychological theme. "I feci
this will help me in my career as
a personnel manager," he said.
"Hemingway and Steinbeck are
my favorite American authors."
John has a very unusual job at
Stanford; he takes care of the
rats used in psychology experi
ments. He also has worked in
Holland al a railway express agen
cy and other similar jobs.

The numerous separate houses
here surprise him. "In Holland
we build one row of houses all
under the same roof," he said.
"We also have a great number of
apartment houses. Everyone al
ways puts flowers on their win
dow sills, so there is much color.
Free Enterprise
"Another thing which impresses
me is the extent of free enterprise
in America. We do not have this
in Holland. As a result of this
free enterprise here, everyone is
always looking for ways to make
things better and cheaper.
"I am also surprised at the
large amount of group living and
getting together in America. I
believe this is a result of the ne
cessity of staying together in the j
first years of American history. '

We have fewer community activi
ties; we do things in small groups
and like to be alone."
According to John, one of Hol
land's biggest problems now is the
lack of skilled labor. In the future
there will not be enough work for
all the people because of the large
population. Holland has the most
people, 520, per square mile of
any country in the world.
Another major problem, he said,
is the necessity of relying on
other countries for supplies of
raw materials, as Holland has few
natural resources. This makes
her dependent on the conditions
and measures thai other countries
put. on these materials.

He and Everardus Beers, also
here this year, are the fourth and
fifth foreign scholars at Stanford
from their school. "This is the
best scholarship we can apply
for," said John, explaining the in
terest in the program.
His school, the Nederlands Op
leidings Instituut voor het Buiten
land (the Dutch Institute for Rep
resentation Abroad) specializes in
a two-year course on business
commerce. He majored in eco
nomics while there and is in the
social sciences department here.
He intends to become a personnel
manager in industry when he re
turns to Holland.
High School
John attended a high school, or
lycee, for six years and was quite
active in extracurricular activi
ties. He was on a committee su
pervising all the school sports and
played on the basketball and soc

cer teams. He was editor of the
school magazine and participated
in the drama group and the choir.
In college he served as secre
tary of a French cultural organi
zation and was a member of the
soccer and basketball teams. He
held the position of deputy senior
prefect and was in charge of su
pervising and keeping discipline
in his dormitory.
Between high school and college
he was in the army medical corps
for two years as a second lieuten
ant, training medical soldiers in
infantry methods.
Favorite Activities
One of John's favorite activities
is singing folk songs in general
and French songs in particular.
He got this interest during his
many bicycle trip s to France.
Some of his selections were broad
cast over the Holland radio, and
he sang often at his college. He
hopes to start a vocal group here
to sing all types of songs.
Another big interest of his is
reading modern literature which
has a psychological theme. "I feci
this will help me in my career as
a personnel manager," he said.
"Hemingway and Steinbeck are
my favorite American authors."
John has a very unusual job at
Stanford; he takes care of the
rats used in psychology experi
ments. He also has worked in
Holland al a railway express agen
cy and other similar jobs.

The numerous separate houses
here surprise him. "In Holland
we build one row of houses all
under the same roof," he said.
"We also have a great number of
apartment houses. Everyone al
ways puts flowers on their win
dow sills, so there is much color.
Free Enterprise
"Another thing which impresses
me is the extent of free enterprise
in America. We do not have this
in Holland. As a result of this
free enterprise here, everyone is
always looking for ways to make
things better and cheaper.
"I am also surprised at the
large amount of group living and
getting together in America. I
believe this is a result of the ne
cessity of staying together in the j
first years of American history. '

We have fewer community activi
ties; we do things in small groups
and like to be alone."
According to John, one of Hol
land's biggest problems now is the
lack of skilled labor. In the future
there will not be enough work for
all the people because of the large
population. Holland has the most
people, 520, per square mile of
any country in the world.
Another major problem, he said,
is the necessity of relying on
other countries for supplies of
raw materials, as Holland has few
natural resources. This makes
her dependent on the conditions
and measures thai other countries
put. on these materials.
"There are no real differences
between people in the world; there
are only differences in customs."
This is the belief of John Veltman,
an ASSU foreign scholar from the
Netherlands.
John comes from Hilversum,
which is 20 miles south of Am
sterdam and is the radio broad
casting center of Holland. During
the autumn quarter he is living
at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house.
