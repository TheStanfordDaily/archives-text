# Missing Plane Still Mystery, Feared Lost
## No Trace of 'Romance Of the Skies'; Search Continues in Pacific 
### 
HONOLULU (IP) — All clues
kindling a spark of hope that 44
persons had survied a mystery
shrouded plane disaster at sea
faded out yesterday. But the
mammoth search was pressed
without let-up.
"We have not thrown in the
sponge by any means," said Wil
liam E. Chapline, the Coast Guard
commander heading up the hunt
over 172,440 square miles of the
vast Pacific for the vanished Pan
American Stratocruiser "Ro
mance of the Skies."
In San Francisco, Pan Ameri
can officials opened an investiga
tion yesterday into the possibility
a "crime" was involved.
Company investigators were
checking on insurance carried 021
persons aboard.
SOS Signals
At II :32 a.m. yesterday a Coast
Guard station operator at IJpolu
Point, Hawaii, reported hearing
what he thought could be faint
SOS signals.
Captain Donald MacDiarmid,
Coast Guard chief of operations,
began a check, but. said, "We are
hearing those things all the
time." He said it was possible
someone was testing emergency
equipment.
Reported sighting Sunday
night 1000 miles east of Honolulu
of three flares had raised hopes
momentarily of finding rubber
rafts from the Honolulu - bound
air liner, unheard from since Fri
day night. The plane carried 36
passengers and a crew of eight.
Surface and air searchers
found nothing on reaching the
area and a Coast Guard spokes
man said they probably were
"shooting stars or from other
search aircraft."
Search Force Increased
The search force was increased
yesterday. Three Pan American
planes left from Honolulu and
another from San Francisco.
They joined forces with two
score other land-based planes, ra
dar - tracking planes of the air
craft carrier Philippine Sea, de
stroyers, submarines, Coast
Guard cutters and merchant
ships.
Failure to turn up a single tan
gible clue seemed foreboding. The
Stratocruiser's gas supply gave
out at 1 a.m. Hawaii Standard
Time Saturday.
The liner's pilot had routinely
reported at 3:04 p.m. Friday that
the plane was just past the mid
way point of the 2400-mile San
Francisco-Honolulu run. It was
never heard from again.
Air line and search officials
were agreed that whatever hap
pened 10,000 feet aloft happened
suddenly, else the plane would
have radioed distress signals
during descent or sent them out
by hand • cranked equipment if
rubber rafts were launched.
