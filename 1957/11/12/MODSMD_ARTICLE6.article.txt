# EXPERIMENT
## Meeting Set To Discuss Living Abroad 
### Pam Staley 
The Experiment in Internation
al Living, a non-profit organiza
tion which gives American stu
dents tlie opportunity to live
abroad as members of foreign
families, will hold an open meet
ing for all interested students in
the Nitcry tomorrow at. 7:30 p.m.
Leighton Rollins, director of the
Experiment for the West Coast,
will explain the nature of the Ex
periment program, and Stanford
students who have participated in
the program will discuss their ex
periences and answer questions.
The Experiment program pro
vides American young people with
the opportunity to become, for a
summer, full-fledged members of
foreign families. Through the mu
tual sharing of ideas and experi
ences, both Americans and their
foreign hosts develop ties that
stretch far across national bar
riers.
"Expect Unexpected"
The Experiment's motto, "Ex
pect the Unexpected," indicates
the nature of the program, for,
though the organization has been
operating for 25 years, each par
ticipant finds that his "experi-!
ment" is distinctly and uniquely |
his own.
The Experiment program en-!
compasses the European coun- !
tries and Chile, Mexico, Nigeria,
Japan and India. Next summer,
for the first time, an Experiment
group will go to Poland.
Graduate students and faculty
members interested in leading Ex
periment groups are invited to
obtain information about the Ex
periment leadership program at
the meeting tomorrow evening.
Qualifications for leaders include
outstanding language ability, ex
perience in living abroad and a !
background of teaching or group
work.
