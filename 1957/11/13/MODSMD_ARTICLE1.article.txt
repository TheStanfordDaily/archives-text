Big Game. The last time Stanford won the Axe was in 1955 with a
score of 19 to 0. The Axe, a 10-pound broadaxe with a 15-inch blade,
became the famed Stanford trophy in 1899 when Yell Leader Billy
Erb produced it at a game and beheaded a dummy of a bear on a
chopping block. The Axe has a long history of being stolen and
returned in time for Big Game.
