# IIR Panel Gives Views On Foreign Employment
## 
### 
Integrity, attitude, a knowledge of language, and enthusiasm are
all requisites for people aspiring for foreign positions in the fields
of military, business and foreign service, agreed the five speakers
on yesterday's lIR panel at Bowman Alumni House.
The speakers, representing branches of the diplomatic service,

private industry and military
service abroad, told a large group
of students the advantages and
disadvantages of foreign employ
ment. Their examples were based
on personal experiences.
Brig. Gen. Philip Faymonville,
U.S. military attache in Moscow
for five years, stressed integrity
in any foreign service, particular
ly in the army, as the most valu
able quality. To be successful in
a foreign position one must have
an appreciation of the culture of
that country, according to Fay
monville.
U.S. Diplomat
James Triolo, who spent five
years in the U.S. diplomatic serv
ice in Colombia, warned that if
one expects to do foreign work
for only a short time, it would be
best to do it upon graduation,
rather than wait some years. He
felt younger people would enjoy
the opportunities more.
Mark Tuban, formerly in charge
of the Central American distri
bution for Ford Motor Company,
stressed attitude as having pri
mary importance. A knowledge
of language is necessary, as well
as an idea of the country's cul
ture and climate.
Business Representative
Also representing business was
Wayne Elwood, president of the
Food Machinery Corporation In
ternational. Elwood's main point
was enthusiasm. In attaining a
foreign position, he said he con
siders enthusiasm more impor
tant than technical competence.
Concluding the panel was Carl
Grove, employee of Siam Cement
Company in Thailand. He men
tioned that foreign company em
ployment is disappearing since
many countries are employing
native help. He considered the
only opportunities in foreign bus
iness for Americans today U> be
in American companies in foreign
areas.
Following the talks, the prob
lems of foreign employment
were discussed by the group as a
whole.
