A famous magazine .spoke of (lie travelers 1o
('liina as ''innocents abroad." While T do not
quite agree 1 hat this is a lair generalization lo
make concerning the students, I think that Mi
chael Mass |IIaas], who recently wrote a letter
to The Daily, fits the description perfectly.
Ii seems amazing to me that any college stu
dent could accept Mao Tse-tung's statements at
i.m" value; Mass |Haas| has evidently done so.
I In says that Mao has announced a change in
policy and ilia) he permits criticism of his re
gone. I didn't know that anyone except the edi
tor of the Daily Worker really believed this. A
recent issue of Time points out what has re
cently happened to those residents of China who
took up Mao's offer.
And he ends by urging this country to ap
proach China in a "friendly manner." In one
word, nuts. She shoots down our planes, holds
our men prisoner ( Hass |Haas| should read the
accounts of those few who come hack and then
think about a "friendly manner"), and attacks
our ally, Nationalist China, whose people were
pushed from their country by the Communists.
I have only compliments for Mr. Williamson,
who took the trip. He could have done us much
harm if. like Mr. Hass |Haas], he swallowed the
line so naively.

Evaluation of an Evaluation
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent issue of The Stanford Daily, Mr.
Christiansen reviewed the Friday evening concert
of Nov. 1, the first of the year's ASSU Concert
Series.
Other than a list of the program selections, the
evaluation of tho performance in Memorial Audi
lorium was vague and showed little contrast for
value judgments. The opening group of selec
tions was by Purcoll, not Schubert, as the per
former changed the program showing poor
laste in concert practice. The presentation of
"lieder," or German art songs, was lacking in
brilliance. On the other hand, the operatic selec
tion in the encore was admirably done, demon
strating the extensive operatic background of 1 he
performer.
Mr. Christiansen noted that this concert "was
in many ways the finest vocal concert to be given
here in many years." If he listened closely—pro
viding he attended the concert he would have
given due credit to the accompanist, who provided
ihe arlistic, complementary background for Ihe
soloist.
Hotter luck to the next review column —that it
be more discerning in both criticism and com
pliments.
T. T. Anderson
Editor's Note: Space problems in a news
upper can cause headaches for both reporters
and readers, as we see happened here. Actu
ally, Mob Christiansen was very glowing in bis

remarks about the accompanist. Unfortunate
ly, that part of the review containing' praise for
the accompanist liatl to be en I in older (o make
the story fit on the page.
Of a Clarifying Nature
Editor, The Daily:
We read with interest, if not with credulity,
David Egger's enlightened letter in the issue of
Nov. 0, in which he made the rather glib state
ment that "for many, the desire to consume
alcohol . . . becomes nearly irresistible .... The
exaggerated importance of consuming liquor
leads to the insanity of fraternity beer busts at
X o'clock in the morning."
For Mr. Egger, as well as for others who have
noi been fortunate enough to participate in this
"insane" custom; we have several points to make
which might be of a clarifying,nature.
1 ) Every gentleman knows that beer is never
consumed before 8:30 a.m. at the earliest, and
we are gentlemen.
2) In view of the fact that this activity was
coeducational in nature, it can be argued that the
tradition can have no other lhan a propitious
effect on the bonds of friendship in the "Great
Stanfoi'd Family."
.3) Many campus dignitaries, as well as the
more profound sophists, were there. Activities
included a successful Socratic Circle (in which
was probed the nature of truth), a game of "Red
Rover'' and a round of centrifugal bumble-puppy.
41 And, most important, we of the "suds-at
dawn" faction never drink in reaction to the
"Victorian ideas of the founders." Nor are we
obsessed with the "exaggerated importance of
consuming liquor." We drink to get drunk.

Editor, The Daily:
On 5 October 1937 the U.S.S.R. sent into space
the first earth satellite. This is one of man's
greatest and most important accomplishments.
The following Monday, 7 October, there was no
appreciable interest shown in this memorable
event by the students of Stanford. The usual con
versations were prevalent, viz.. Saturday's foot
ball game, the fraternity parties following, the
personalized "sex on the Farm" talk, his new car,
her new pin, beer.
In six classes that day the satellite was men
tioned by professors jokingly. No mention was
made as to the national implications: Ihe national
security, the budget and the ability of a competi
tive free-enterprise system to meet this challenge,
the interservice rivalries, the progress and plani
fieation |sic] of our scientific program. No men
lion was marie concerning the international as
pects of this accomplishment: 1hc role of the
United Nations, the problems of international law
and air-space sovereignty, the loss of American
prestige and technological leadership, the shift
ing power relationship and our alliance obliga
tions. No mention was made of the moral issues
that will arise.
On 3 November 1957 the U.S.S.R. sent into
space a satellite containing a living animal. This,
again, is one of man's greatest, and most impor
tant accomplishments.
The following Monday, 4 November, there was

Evaluation of an Evaluation
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent issue of The Stanford Daily, Mr.
Christiansen reviewed the Friday evening concert
of Nov. 1, the first of the year's ASSU Concert
Series.
Other than a list of the program selections, the
evaluation of tho performance in Memorial Audi
lorium was vague and showed little contrast for
value judgments. The opening group of selec
tions was by Purcoll, not Schubert, as the per
former changed the program showing poor
laste in concert practice. The presentation of
"lieder," or German art songs, was lacking in
brilliance. On the other hand, the operatic selec
tion in the encore was admirably done, demon
strating the extensive operatic background of 1 he
performer.
Mr. Christiansen noted that this concert "was
in many ways the finest vocal concert to be given
here in many years." If he listened closely—pro
viding he attended the concert he would have
given due credit to the accompanist, who provided
ihe arlistic, complementary background for Ihe
soloist.
Hotter luck to the next review column —that it
be more discerning in both criticism and com
pliments.

Editor, The Daily:
We read with interest, if not with credulity,
David Egger's enlightened letter in the issue of
Nov. 0, in which he made the rather glib state
ment that "for many, the desire to consume
alcohol . . . becomes nearly irresistible .... The
exaggerated importance of consuming liquor
leads to the insanity of fraternity beer busts at
X o'clock in the morning."
For Mr. Egger, as well as for others who have
noi been fortunate enough to participate in this
"insane" custom; we have several points to make
which might be of a clarifying,nature.
1 ) Every gentleman knows that beer is never
consumed before 8:30 a.m. at the earliest, and
we are gentlemen.
2) In view of the fact that this activity was
coeducational in nature, it can be argued that the
tradition can have no other lhan a propitious
effect on the bonds of friendship in the "Great
Stanfoi'd Family."
.3) Many campus dignitaries, as well as the
more profound sophists, were there. Activities
included a successful Socratic Circle (in which
was probed the nature of truth), a game of "Red
Rover'' and a round of centrifugal bumble-puppy.
41 And, most important, we of the "suds-at

"Victorian ideas of the founders." Nor are we
obsessed with the "exaggerated importance of
consuming liquor." We drink to get drunk.

Evaluation of an Evaluation
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent issue of The Stanford Daily, Mr.
Christiansen reviewed the Friday evening concert
of Nov. 1, the first of the year's ASSU Concert
Series.
Other than a list of the program selections, the
evaluation of tho performance in Memorial Audi
lorium was vague and showed little contrast for
value judgments. The opening group of selec
tions was by Purcoll, not Schubert, as the per
former changed the program showing poor
laste in concert practice. The presentation of
"lieder," or German art songs, was lacking in
brilliance. On the other hand, the operatic selec
tion in the encore was admirably done, demon
strating the extensive operatic background of 1 he
performer.
Mr. Christiansen noted that this concert "was
in many ways the finest vocal concert to be given
here in many years." If he listened closely—pro
viding he attended the concert he would have
given due credit to the accompanist, who provided
ihe arlistic, complementary background for Ihe
soloist.
Hotter luck to the next review column —that it
be more discerning in both criticism and com
pliments.

Of a Clarifying Nature
Editor, The Daily:
We read with interest, if not with credulity,
David Egger's enlightened letter in the issue of
Nov. 0, in which he made the rather glib state
ment that "for many, the desire to consume
alcohol . . . becomes nearly irresistible .... The
exaggerated importance of consuming liquor
leads to the insanity of fraternity beer busts at
X o'clock in the morning."
For Mr. Egger, as well as for others who have
noi been fortunate enough to participate in this
"insane" custom; we have several points to make
which might be of a clarifying,nature.
1 ) Every gentleman knows that beer is never
consumed before 8:30 a.m. at the earliest, and
we are gentlemen.
2) In view of the fact that this activity was
coeducational in nature, it can be argued that the
tradition can have no other lhan a propitious
effect on the bonds of friendship in the "Great
Stanfoi'd Family."
.3) Many campus dignitaries, as well as the
more profound sophists, were there. Activities
included a successful Socratic Circle (in which
was probed the nature of truth), a game of "Red
Rover'' and a round of centrifugal bumble-puppy.
41 And, most important, we of the "suds-at
dawn" faction never drink in reaction to the
"Victorian ideas of the founders." Nor are we
obsessed with the "exaggerated importance of
consuming liquor." We drink to get drunk.

dent could accept Mao Tse-tung's statements at
i.m" value; Mass |Haas| has evidently done so.
I In says that Mao has announced a change in
policy and ilia) he permits criticism of his re
gone. I didn't know that anyone except the edi
tor of the Daily Worker really believed this. A
recent issue of Time points out what has re
cently happened to those residents of China who
took up Mao's offer.
And he ends by urging this country to ap
proach China in a "friendly manner." In one
word, nuts. She shoots down our planes, holds
our men prisoner ( Hass |Haas| should read the
accounts of those few who come hack and then
think about a "friendly manner"), and attacks
our ally, Nationalist China, whose people were
pushed from their country by the Communists.
I have only compliments for Mr. Williamson,
who took the trip. He could have done us much
harm if. like Mr. Hass |Haas], he swallowed the
line so naively.

Evaluation of an Evaluation
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent issue of The Stanford Daily, Mr.
Christiansen reviewed the Friday evening concert
of Nov. 1, the first of the year's ASSU Concert
Series.
Other than a list of the program selections, the
evaluation of tho performance in Memorial Audi
lorium was vague and showed little contrast for
value judgments. The opening group of selec
tions was by Purcoll, not Schubert, as the per
former changed the program showing poor
laste in concert practice. The presentation of
"lieder," or German art songs, was lacking in
brilliance. On the other hand, the operatic selec
tion in the encore was admirably done, demon
strating the extensive operatic background of 1 he
performer.
Mr. Christiansen noted that this concert "was
in many ways the finest vocal concert to be given
here in many years." If he listened closely—pro
viding he attended the concert he would have
given due credit to the accompanist, who provided
ihe arlistic, complementary background for Ihe
soloist.
Hotter luck to the next review column —that it
be more discerning in both criticism and com
pliments.

Editor's Note: Space problems in a news
upper can cause headaches for both reporters
and readers, as we see happened here. Actu
ally, Mob Christiansen was very glowing in bis

remarks about the accompanist. Unfortunate
ly, that part of the review containing' praise for
the accompanist liatl to be en I in older (o make
the story fit on the page.
Of a Clarifying Nature
Editor, The Daily:
We read with interest, if not with credulity,
David Egger's enlightened letter in the issue of
Nov. 0, in which he made the rather glib state
ment that "for many, the desire to consume
alcohol . . . becomes nearly irresistible .... The
exaggerated importance of consuming liquor
leads to the insanity of fraternity beer busts at
X o'clock in the morning."
For Mr. Egger, as well as for others who have
noi been fortunate enough to participate in this
"insane" custom; we have several points to make
which might be of a clarifying,nature.
1 ) Every gentleman knows that beer is never
consumed before 8:30 a.m. at the earliest, and
we are gentlemen.
2) In view of the fact that this activity was
coeducational in nature, it can be argued that the
tradition can have no other lhan a propitious
effect on the bonds of friendship in the "Great
Stanfoi'd Family."
.3) Many campus dignitaries, as well as the
more profound sophists, were there. Activities
included a successful Socratic Circle (in which
was probed the nature of truth), a game of "Red
Rover'' and a round of centrifugal bumble-puppy.
41 And, most important, we of the "suds-at
dawn" faction never drink in reaction to the
"Victorian ideas of the founders." Nor are we
obsessed with the "exaggerated importance of
consuming liquor." We drink to get drunk.

iNo Appreciable Interest
Editor, The Daily:
On 5 October 1937 the U.S.S.R. sent into space
the first earth satellite. This is one of man's
greatest and most important accomplishments.
The following Monday, 7 October, there was no
appreciable interest shown in this memorable
event by the students of Stanford. The usual con
versations were prevalent, viz.. Saturday's foot
ball game, the fraternity parties following, the
personalized "sex on the Farm" talk, his new car,
her new pin, beer.
In six classes that day the satellite was men
tioned by professors jokingly. No mention was
made as to the national implications: Ihe national
security, the budget and the ability of a competi
tive free-enterprise system to meet this challenge,
the interservice rivalries, the progress and plani
fieation |sic] of our scientific program. No men
lion was marie concerning the international as
pects of this accomplishment: 1hc role of the
United Nations, the problems of international law
and air-space sovereignty, the loss of American
prestige and technological leadership, the shift
ing power relationship and our alliance obliga
tions. No mention was made of the moral issues
that will arise.
On 3 November 1957 the U.S.S.R. sent into
space a satellite containing a living animal. This,
again, is one of man's greatest, and most impor
tant accomplishments.
The following Monday, 4 November, there was
no appreciable interest. . . .
What the hell is this? A university? An edu
cation?
