# FAR EAST OPINION
## Visitor Agrees with US On Red Chinese Policy 
### 
For the sake of the future
friendship of the Chinese people
on the mainland, and the eventual
understanding between China and
the United States, the latter
should not recognize the Chinese
Communist government.
Miss Maria Yen, a current visi
tor to the campus from Hong
Kong and formerly from Peking,
made this observation in an inter
view with The Daily yesterday
afternoon.
The Chinese people, she contin
ued, are very discontent with the
Communists' totalitarian govern
ment. In adddition, their standard
of living has been lowered since
Mao Tse-tung took over the Chi
nese mainland in 1949. The peo
ple are very much opposed to the
collective farming system which
the Communists have forced on
them, she said.
Not Friendly to U.S.
But. even though they do not
like Ihe Communist system, nei
ther are they friendly to the Unit
ed States and other democratic
governments.
This, she explained, is due to
the outright lies about the United
States and democracy which con
front them in every form of com
munication. Over 95 per cent of
the textbooks used in Chinese
schools — which are all govern
ment-cont rolled are C hi nese
translations of Russian texts. In
addition, all newspaper, magazine
and radio correspondence is pre
pared, edited and, if need be, cen
sored by the Communists.
"Ruthless Capitalists"
Therefore, the people know only
untrue facts about Western coun
tries. "Ruthless capitalists" and
"imperialists" are terms used to
describe Americans in history and
economic courses, she said.

President Eisenhower is pictur
ed as the imperialistic, militaristic
dictator of the American people -
who, incidentally, are divided into
two classes, the exploiters and the
exploited.
"But if you recognize the pres
ent government, which the people
hate, you will destroy even the
slightest hope of a future favor
able view of tho United States.
You will discourage and offend
the people, because they will think
the U.S. is being friendly to out
enemy [the Communists]."
Miss Yen, who is visit ing I lie
United States on a State Depart
ment grant, has published a book
describing her student life at Pe
king University under a Commu
nist regime. Miss Yen, who was
graduated from the university as
a literature major in 1950, has
named her book "The Umbrella
Garden."
Her purpose here is to visit col
leges, universities and publishing
houses around the country and lo
promote more understanding be
tween East and West.

The Chinese people, she contin
ued, are very discontent with the
Communists' totalitarian govern
ment. In adddition, their standard
of living has been lowered since
Mao Tse-tung took over the Chi
nese mainland in 1949. The peo
ple are very much opposed to the
collective farming system which
the Communists have forced on
them, she said.
Not Friendly to U.S.
But. even though they do not
like Ihe Communist system, nei
ther are they friendly to the Unit
ed States and other democratic
governments.
This, she explained, is due to
the outright lies about the United
States and democracy which con
front them in every form of com
munication. Over 95 per cent of
the textbooks used in Chinese
schools — which are all govern
ment-cont rolled are C hi nese
translations of Russian texts. In
addition, all newspaper, magazine
and radio correspondence is pre
pared, edited and, if need be, cen
sored by the Communists.
"Ruthless Capitalists"
Therefore, the people know only
untrue facts about Western coun
tries. "Ruthless capitalists" and
"imperialists" are terms used to
describe Americans in history and
economic courses, she said.

President Eisenhower is pictur
ed as the imperialistic, militaristic
dictator of the American people -
who, incidentally, are divided into
two classes, the exploiters and the
exploited.
"But if you recognize the pres
ent government, which the people
hate, you will destroy even the
slightest hope of a future favor
able view of tho United States.
You will discourage and offend
the people, because they will think
the U.S. is being friendly to out
enemy [the Communists]."
