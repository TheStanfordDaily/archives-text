The Stanford footballers figure
1o have a rough game on their
h: nds when they meet the Ore
gon Slate Beavers this Saturday
.-si Corvallls.
The Beavers boast a hard-hit
ting offense and currently are on
1 (>|> of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence defensive • wise, although
OSC had trouble stopping Cali
fornia, 21-19, last Saturday. Tom
my Proline's troops ran into
1 rouble when Cal's Joe Kapp
started pitching long aerials to
wide-open ends.
Cal stuck pretty much to the
ground dining the first half, and
was smothered by the Beavers'
hard-charging line. The Beavers
scored early in the first quarter
and added Iwo more TD's in the
second to post a convincing 21-0
hall lime lead. The second half
was all Cal's as the Bears stopped
ihe PC("s leading rushers cold.
IKven Offensively
Offensively, the Indians and
the Beavers are evenly matched.
Both teams have a crushing
ground attack, but Stanford has
a heavy edge in passing. Oregon
Slate has piled up 2656 net yards
as compared to Stanford's 2805.
The Beavers have an edge defen
• ively, although their famed de
fensive ability crumbled badly in
the second half at Berkeley.
Leading the Beaver single-wing
attack is tailback Joe Francis,
rated as Ihe best tailback in the
POO and best in the nation by
«ome. Francis, however, was
forced to sit out Ihe Cal game last
week when he came down with
flu. Francis leads the Beaver
passers, completing 22 of 42 for
321 yatds and a 52.4 per cent
average.
Subs Impress
Tn Francis' absence last week
subs Larry Sanchez and Tony
Arana filled in at tailback and
<>a ve impressive performances.
Sanchez is a competent passer,
and threw two touchdown passes
againsl the Bears, one good for
-i(> yards 1o fleel halfback Earnel
Durden.
Durden, who is spelled by
Sterling Hammack at half, is a
ronstant breakaway threat. Ham
mack also has speed and was
ired effectively until he left Ihe
Cal game on a stretcher.
Rounding out the Beaver back
field are blocking back and cap
lain Ted Searle and fullback Nub
Reamer. Searle boots OSC's
P.A.T.'s, and Beamer is a vicious
runner who can really smash
through the line for yardage.
Top man in the Beaver line is
Bob De Grant, who played his
prep ball at Burlingame. De
Grant is the leading pass receiv
er for Ihe Beavers and is a tough
customer on defense. Center Buzz
Randall and tackle Dave Jesmer
are also standouts in Ihe rugged
Beaver line.
(5-2 Record
Tn addition to squeaking by
Cal, the Beavers have defeated
TJSC, Kansas, Northwestern, Ida
ho and Washington State, while
UCLA and Washington beat the
Black Bandits by respective
scores of 26-7 and 10-6.
Summing up: An Indian win
in the OSC -vntest appears to
hinge on whether Stanford's line
can crack the tough Beaver for
ward wall and stop the fleet Bea
ver backs before they can cause
any damage with their tricky re
verses. end-arounds and fullback
spinners. The Beavers show a
weakness in pass defense and can
be clobbered if Jack Douglas is
on target. The Beavers hold one
advantage in the strong reserve
forces they possess.
