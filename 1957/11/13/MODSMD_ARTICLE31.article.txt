# Allied Arts Guild Makes Creative, Unusual Gifts
## 
### Nina Elkind 
If Christmas shopping meant
shopping with the true spirit of
the holiday, the busiest place
would be the Allied Arts Guild in
Menlo Park.
Maintenance of five beds in the
Stanford Convalescent Home is
the aim of the 130 members of
the Woodside - Atherton Junior
Auxiliary, who operate the Guild.
Located there are a tea - room
and nine shops that specialize in
unusual gifts. Children's toys,
clothing, modern and traditional
gifts are just some of the special
ty items sold there.
Allied Arts Guild originated as
a co-operative type place where
local craftsmen could create and
sell their goods. Some of the
craftsmen, still working at the
Guild, include a lapidary, a pot
ter, a cabinet maker and a weav
er.
Shops are housed in an old
Spanish estate that was originally
a land grant from tho Spanish
king to the San Francisco com
mandant, Don Jose Arguello. In
1929, three and one-half acres of
the estate were purchased by. Mr.
and Mrs. Garfield Mcrner, world
travelers and collectors of un
usual items.
Complementing the Spanish
setting are the Court of Abun
dance, at the entrance to the main
building; the Garden of Delight,
done in blue; and the Cervantes

Court, displaying a Don Quixote
j mural and many other murals,
mosaics and frescoes pertaining
to the Spanish author.
In 1932, the Merners invited
the Palo Alto Junior Auxiliary to
take over the luncheon - tea
room. and three years later, they
leased the Guild to the Senior
Auxiliary of the Stanford Conva
lescent Home. Allied Arts Asso
ciates, Inc., purchased the Guild
in 1946, and the Woodside-Ather
j ton workers took over the trus
! teeship in 1951.
