with me a half-day." Between
Dan and his part-time helper, an
award-winning magazine is pub
lished 10 times yearly and dis
tributed to to the Alumni Asso
ciation's 20,370 members all over
the globe.
Last year's awards testify to
the Alumni Board's opinion that
the Review has the finest editor
possible. An independent group
of judges presented the two na
tional awards, the first for "ex
cellence of column" and the sec
ond for "significant editorial
achievement."
Amusingly typical editorials
were entitled "Next Stop: Slob
bovia?" "Ate Students Neces
sary?" and finally, "Alumni: Who
Needs 'Em?"
Dan's literary career began
during his undergraduate days at
Stanford, when an article of his
appeared in "Harper's." Then, to
celebrate the occasion, he took a
trip to Mexico and, before realiz

received from the magazine. "I
just assumed those checks would
keep coming in!" Dan laughed.

four years under his direction,

Dan Endsley, as editor of the Alumni Review, the official Alumni
Association publication, comes about as close to running a one-man
show as anyone since the famed P. T. Barnum.

Dan Endsley is responsible solely
to the Alumni Association Board,
