# The 						light With no Third Dimension

### 
A new source of light is nearing
practicality. Called electrolumines
cence, it comes from a flat surface.
By the twist of a knob, you can
change the brightness, or even the
color, of a room.
Since electric lighting first became
practical, only three basically dif
ferent light sources have achieved
widespread use â€”incandescent, fluo
rescent, and gas-discharge lamps.
Now a fourth basic type electro
luminescence is nearing practical
ity. With fewer theoretical limita
tions than any of its predecessors,
it promises to revolutionize lighting

and become a practical light source
of the future.
In an incandescent lamp, light
comes from a single point. In a
fluorescent lamp (form of giis
diseharge), light comes from a
straight line. In electroluminescence,
light comes from an area or flat sur
face. Electroluminescence is light
emission from phosphor powders em
bedded in an insulator, excited by
an a-c field.
Westinghouse engineers gave the
first practical demonstration of this
new light source. They lighted an
entire room with fiat electrolumi

nescent panels on the ceiling and
three walls. These panels were one
foot-square flat glass plates about
as thick as a window pane and coated
with a plastic containing the phos
phor. They were topped off by an
aluminum conducting coating.
Hooked up to a source of power,
these plates had a brightness of 100
foot lamberts in their present stage
of development.
Since some phosphors have more
than one emission band, the color
and brightness of electroluminescent
lighting can be changed by varying
the frequency. It is possible to con
trol the color of a room, and bright
ness too, simply by twisting a knob.
Besides supplying ordinary light,
this new light source has other fas
cinating possibilities. Just one is
"picture framing" television. An
electroluminescent cell might replace
the conventional cathode-ray tube
in such a set.
Westinghouse engineers, under the
supervision of E. G. F. Arnott
(Princeton '28), developed electro-

luminescent lighting under the name
of "Rayescent" lighting. Westing
house approached the problem, not
as a commercial venture, but as a
pure research project. Much work
remains to be done in this field. It is
typical of the pioneering develop
ments undertaken by Westinghouse.
