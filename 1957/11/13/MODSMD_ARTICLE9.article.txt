## O'Connor Explains Reasons for Not Writing of America 
### 
The question of why he doesn't
write about America causes
, Frank O'Connor, Irish short-story
I writer, "a certain amount of em
barrassment."
O'Connor answered the ques
tion at the Tuesday Series last
j night at Memorial Auditorium to
! a larger than usual crowd.
"I have three standard replies
I to why I don't write about Amer
ica," O'Connor said, "and they
I are graded in order of diffi
[ culty":
1» "I don't know enough about
America. This is true, hut it is
I not very convincing since the peo
ple I'm talking to know authors
I who know even less about Amer
i ica than I do."
2) "I don't know the American
i language." For an example, O'-
Connor related how when he used
the word "catapult" in a story
for the "paper" he writes for, the
New Yorker, no one knew what
he meant. After much confusion
the word "slingshot" replaced the
j offending word.
3) "I don't know the American
I customs."
People rebel against their par
j ents and communities.
We often are unable to see the
civilization which is right before
us, O'Connor said. When we read
books such as Sherwood Ander
son's "Winesburg, Ohio" and Wil
la Cather's "Youth and the Bright
Medusa" we cry inside. We can
recognize in these characters peo
ple we have known, "people who
have been mutilated in these
ways—and it isn't funny."
"The only realities men know
come from their families and their
home communities. That is why
I write about County Court. The
only reason people want me to
i write about America is because
I they want me to share with I hem
II heir realities."
