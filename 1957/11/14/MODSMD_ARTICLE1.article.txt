# "Farm" Shows Tradition of Student Responsibility

(Editor's Note: This is the first of a two-part series on stu
dent government at Stanford. Today's installment traces the
slow development of student government. Tomorrow the struc
ture and functions of Legislature will be discussed.)

Before the polls closed for fall quarter elections last week, Elec
tion Commission officials were as much in the dark as anyone else
on the identity of the winning candidates.
But of one thing they could be certain —final results would show
that only a small percentage of the student body had voted.
'Twas not always so—as a good, long look at Stanford's history
will show.
Although cries of "Apathy!" have rung loud and long through
classrooms and dormitories through the years, it was student interest
and enthusiasm in the first place that was responsible for the setting
up of a truly independent and representative student body govern
ment.
The prize was obtained in much the same way that other political
groups have obtained free government—only after much protest and
agitation, amounting at times almost to a "civil war" that rent the
happy "Stanford Family" in two.

Although no records of outright skirmishes between students and
faculty on Inner Quad can be found, accounts show that the two
camps were solidly split on the question of student responsibility for
their own affairs.
When the University was founded in 1891, student government
was non existent and seemingly little missed.
A "student body" existed and the group held meetings, but a yel
lowed newspaper clipping from the Daily Palo Alto (predecessor to
The Stanford Daily) of March 2, 1894. shows that debate was more
concerned with such matters as "Should we accept tlie offer of the
Ice Skating Company for the free use of the rink on any day we
designate?"
After this momentous question was settled (by an affirmative
vote), the meeting was adjourned "on account of the '95-'96 baseball
game." ('96 won, breaking '95's three-year record.)
The students had fun but no responsibility. All important affairs
were handled by faculty committees appointed by the administration
—and a tight grip was kept on the reins.
Prominent faculty members at the time were quoted as feeling
thkt the students were not capable of handling their own affairs.
But more and more students escaped from the croquet-playing
atmosphere of "The Farm" at the turn of the century and disagreed.

They demanded control and protested the system of proctored exami
nations. asking for an honor code, with a student judicial council to
judge cases.
Some faculty members were just coming around to the student's
point of view on government when this "radical" proposal was made.
The response was frosty.
It was felt that these crusaders did not know what they were
getting into and that it was only the "glamour" of legislating that
attracted them. When it came to discipline, faculty and administra
tion agreed, the system would break down.
Then in 1901 the faculty made an all-important admission—an
honor code could only work if the students themselves were respon
sible for the system. But the coveted powers were still not granted.
Student-faculty dissension was recognized as a serious problem
on the campus during the first decade of this century when finally,
in 1912, a wary and weary faculty consented to a limited form of !
student government.
The concession went almost in vain as balky students refused to !
accept the restricted terms.
However, fearing the withdrawal of the offer, women students
voted acceptance, to be followed by the men soon after—and student ,
government of a sort was at last established.

Perhaps because of the grudging nature of the concessions, per
haps because headstrong students were giddy with their new freedom,
the experiment almost failed during the first months. Conscientious
student body leaders attempted to control student energies. On the
other extreme, "apathy" reared its ugly head, and support for tin
new leaders was lacking in many quarters.
Although balance was gradually achieved as excesses declined
faculty committees still kept a watchful eye on the proceedings.
In 191.") president John Caspar Branner appointed Dr. Murray D
Wildman and Dr. David M. Folsom to survey students' progress it
self-government.
They reported favorably on the improved faculty-student relation?
and the fairness of judicial decisions—but knocked executive organi
zation and the lack of student responsibility displayed on the campus
The faculty was still skeptical on this point when an announce
ment was made on May 24, 1921, that the Honor Code had beer
adopted on petition of the student body.
Complete student control had come to Stanford—after 30 years
