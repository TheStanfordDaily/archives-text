# 'Experimenters' Find Youth Abroad 'Question U.S. Life
## 
### 
The "Experiment in Interna
tional Living" is not merely a
travel program, but a chance for
the participant to represent this
country abroad and to answer
questions about it. as well as
learn about the country in which
he is living. This was stressed
by Leighton Rollins, West Coast
representative of the Experiment,
in a meeting last night.
Some of the questions asked
previous participants were "liovv
can you say you arc a democracy
when you have the Little Rock
troubles?" and '"Do all Ameri
cans have two Cadillacs and one
divorce?"
The meeting in the Nitery was
held to L r ive information to those

interested in the program and to
relate experiences of past par
ticipants in the program.
The Experiment begins on the
student ship where all the 850
experimenters meet together and
attend lectures to gain knowl
edge about many subjects they
may have to discuss with the peo
ple of the country in which they
are staying.
On arrival the group of experi
menters that arc living in the
same country take a two weeks'
tour of it with the young people
of the host community. Each
one lives from four to six weeks
with his "family" and then has
two weeks to travel before com
intr back.
