# Garcia Wins Full Term In Philippines Election
## Magsaysay Heir in for Four Years; Running Mate Lags in Early Results 
### 
MANILA (/P) —President Carlos Garcia apparently has won a four
year term of his own as president of the Philippines. His growing
lead switched attention today to the question of whether he would
have a teammate or an opposition party man for vice-president.
Garcia himself moved up to the presidency from the vice-presi-

dent's post last March when Pres
ident Ramon Magsaysay was
killed in an airplane crash. Gar
cia, 61, was Magsaysay's chosen
political heir.
Votes pouring in from strong
Nacionalista provinces gave Gar
cia a comfortable margin over
Liberal Jose Yulo, 63 • year • old
sugar king. The ballot surge also
put Jose B. Laurel, Garcia's run
ning mate, back in the picture.
Laurel Behind
Laurel, House speaker and a
member of one of the Philip
pines' leading political families,
had been trailing far behind Dios
dado Macapagal, Liberal vice
presidential nominee. But the
Philippine News Service predict
ed that if Laurel maintains his
late gains in the provinces he will
overtake Macapagal.
The key to the vice-presidential
race appeared to be centered in
Mindanao Island, where returns
were slow in being reported.
Last Tabulations
The last vice-presidential tabu
lation reported gave Macapagal
635,343 to 460,508 for Laurel.
The last presidential tabulation
reported gave Garcia 619,131
votes to Yulo's 404,840. Progres
sive candidate Manuel P. Mana
han had 335,820; Senator Claro
M. Recto, Nationalist - Citizens
Party, 206,903, and Antonio Qui
rino, Independent Liberal, 29,079.
The mounting Nacionalista
vote was attributed partly to
Garcia's personal popularity in
the southern islands and partly
to the strong Nacionalista party
organization.
