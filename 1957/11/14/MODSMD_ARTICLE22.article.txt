With ttif, passing away of ihe furor over
Karl Williamson's summer \isit lo Communist
< liina. and The Daih's suhse(|uent publishing
of his impressions, it is perhaps an appropriate
linn* lo diseuss the full question of propaganda
and the publication or the exposition of doc
trines eonsidered inimical to the interests ol
the United Slates.
One of the most fundamental aspects of
democracy—perhaps the real foundation of
dcmocracv is the belief that the majority will,
in the final analysis, discover what is best (or
whatever group the majority is a pari.
The majority, within bounds of constilll
- limits, decides what the policy of the
I niled States will he. If the majority changes
ils mind, the policy of the I nited Stales must
change.
Inherent in this right of the majority to
decide policy is the right of llie majority il
it so wishes—to amend the Constitution so that
form of government in the L nited States be
comes totalitarian rather than republican. That
it hasn't done this is because the majority has
been aware of the undesirability ol
totalitarianism to prevent its occurring.
Thus, another inherent right of the ma
joril\ and of all people, since everyone may
he part of the majority is the right to become
informed in every wa\ possible on all things
in which the majority is given the constitu
tional right and duly to rule upon. And, since
the majority can change the Constitution, this
means practically everything.
I here exists in the world today ideological
doctrines that are inconsistent with the Ameri
can democratic system as it is presently consti
tuted. It is argued that for anv American lo
advance, publish, expound, or in am way to

further these doctrines in the United States is
to contribute toward the undermining of the
American way of life. Such acts have been
eonsidered little short of treason. Strict cen
sorships have even been advocated.
If is reasoned that Americans must be pro
tected from contamination lest they fall victims
to their own mis-reasonings. This implies that
the majority cannot wiselv reason for itself
•which strikes at the very foundation of de
mocracy.
To dcn\ the righl of a socialist or a commu
nist or even a misled democrat to expound his
beliefs is to admit the right of a totalitarian
government lo deny tlx l right of any of its
people? to expound or to espouse the cause of
democracy.
It is often wondered whether the advocates
of protectionism are sincerely interested in
preserving democracy as an ideal, or whether
tliev are interested in preserving democracy as
the best environment for their predominant
interests. For. surely. extreme protectionism
would nunc readily destroy the ideal of de
mocracy than protect il.
In this period of extreme world tensions it
would he advisable for all Americans to seri
oitslv consider the line, immeasurable value of
democracy. If we truly love democracy for
itself, nol just as a convenient environment, we
should find out what it is and why il works.
Further, we should not hesitate to avail our
selves of all knowledge concerning any threat
to democracy, real or alleged, so that we may
intelligently decide through our reason what
v\e. as part of that majority which rules in
democracy, consider is right and good for
America.
I here is wisdom and strength in foreknowl
edge.
