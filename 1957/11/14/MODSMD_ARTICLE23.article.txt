4 Ou! of Slep \\ ilit Reality"
To the Editor:
Recently a flock of placards have appeared in
classrooms referring to the Fundamental Stand
ard as a "mutual co-operation between students
and faculty." When will the dreamers on this
campus wake up and realize the Fundamental
Standard is out of step with reality Tt is absurd
1o assume such a standard will ever replace any
carefully thought out and well defined code of
laws. Are we to struggle through centuries of
legal improvement only to slip back to a system
which existed prior to Hammurabi, where laws
were not written, and people acted as they
1 bought fit and were judged by a king as he
thought fit? The Fundamental Standard encour
ages this. All modes of conduct on and off cam
pus, according to the Fundamental Standard, are
Id be directed by the individual's moral stand
ards, and then his conduct is judged by the Men's

and Women's Councils through their moral
standards. What are our common moral stand
ards?
Here at Stanford where Ihe air is rich with
intellectual activity, and students and faculty
share "mutual responsibility" to push back the
cloud of illiteracy which covers much of the
world, it is fitting to be guided by our intelli
gence and insight through "mutual responsibil
ity" in making our moral decisions. Let's be
serious! The Fundamental Standard was sug
gested by David Starr Jordan at a time when
Stanford was much smaller and a "family" spirit
could prevail, but now it is obvious such a stand
ard is not workable. The ambiguity inherent in
it makes it useless, if not dangerous. It is about
lime we stop kidding ourselves about what a fine
thing the Fundamental Standard is and adopt
a standard that is more definite and more real
istic.
