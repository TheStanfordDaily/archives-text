# Bogus Solicitor Invades Wilbur
## 
### 
A salesman is thought to have
| been selling bogus magazine sub
scriptions at Wilbur Hall, accord
! ing to Dr. William Alloway, di
j rector of the hall.
After being warned Monday
not to return, he was found again
; Tuesday and thrown off campus
1 by the campus police.
"It is against University rules
[ for off-campus solicitors to be in
dormitories," Dr. Alloway said.
"Students must get permission
from both the Student - Faculty
Employment Committee and the
director of the dormitory to so
licit."
"We have the impression from
! reports that he is bogus," Dr. Al
; loway commented. "Some spon
sors knew of someone who had
bought a subscription last year
from the same organization he
I represented, and no magazines
' were ever sent."
