Class newspapers are one of
: I ho best ways of keeping class
members in contact with one an

com decisions. A typical edition
includes publicity of class act ivi-!
ties, news of class members, pin- 1
ning and engagement lists and;
feature stories. These newspa-1
pers, usually four pages in |
length, are published on an aver
! age of three a quarter, usually
; immediately preceding a class 1
(event. Financed through the
class treasuries, they are printed
commercially and distributed to
! all class members through dormi
; tories and houses.

by Hie class officers through
an interview system. The editor
