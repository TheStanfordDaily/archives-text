Drive into any Union Oil station in the West
and you'll get a sample of what we call Minute
Man Service.
"In 4 1 /? minutes your oil, water, battery and
tires are checked, your windshield and rear
window cleaned, your gasoline tank filled, and
your receipt handed you.

"But that's routine. It's the Minute Man's
service beyond the call of duty that we keep
getting fan mail about.
"For instance, the dealer in the small town
who located a tenant for his customer's vacant
house.
"Or the dealer in the suburb who baby-sat so
his Customer could go to an important dinner
meeting.
\ "Or the dealer who fixed his customer's
washing machine when she couldn't get help
on a Sunday.
ji "Or the dealer who shopped for his customer's
groceries and delivered them to her house.
"Exceptions to the rule? Not at all. Our files

are full of letters recounting incidents like these.
t- I tak<- special pride in them because I'm one
of the men at Union Oil whose job it is to train

these dealers. We help them in every way we
can to get the Union Oil idea: I he only way
to stay in business for yourself is to he in busi
ness for your customers."
* * * *
No small part of our reputation for having
America's finest service station system is the
quality of the men who operate them.
They are all individual business men. Like
us, they compete for a living. That's why its
very likely that their service will continue to
be as good as their gasoline.

Drive into any Union Oil station in the West
and you'll get a sample of what we call Minute
Man Service.
"In 4 1 /? minutes your oil, water, battery and
tires are checked, your windshield and rear
window cleaned, your gasoline tank filled, and
your receipt handed you.

"But that's routine. It's the Minute Man's
service beyond the call of duty that we keep
getting fan mail about.
"For instance, the dealer in the small town
who located a tenant for his customer's vacant
house.
"Or the dealer in the suburb who baby-sat so
his Customer could go to an important dinner
meeting.
\ "Or the dealer who fixed his customer's
washing machine when she couldn't get help
on a Sunday.
ji "Or the dealer who shopped for his customer's
groceries and delivered them to her house.
"Exceptions to the rule? Not at all. Our files

are full of letters recounting incidents like these.
t- I tak<- special pride in them because I'm one
of the men at Union Oil whose job it is to train

these dealers. We help them in every way we
can to get the Union Oil idea: I he only way
to stay in business for yourself is to he in busi
ness for your customers."

No small part of our reputation for having
America's finest service station system is the
quality of the men who operate them.
They are all individual business men. Like
us, they compete for a living. That's why its
very likely that their service will continue to
be as good as their gasoline.
