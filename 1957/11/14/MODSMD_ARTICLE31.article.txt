Douglas, Shea Up in National Stats
National football statistics were released yesterday, and Stan
ford fans will note that quarterback Jackie Douglas, with a total
offense of 850, tics with Army's Don Anderson for 14th place across
the U.S. Bob Newman, Washington State, is third. The King Hill
half of the Rice Owls' dangerous duo (Frank Ryan and Hill) is
tenth.
Chuck Shea of the Indians is the only PCC man to place in rush
ing stats with an eighth ranked spot. He's carried for 641 yards.
Newman leads the nation in passing; 75 out of 140 for a .536 mark.
Douglas has a higher percentage in tenth spot, but has completed
fewer aerials. Jack'.v totals are 62 for 113, and .549.
Don lOJlingscn of the Cougars is ihe nation's third rated pass
receiver, with 34 to his credit. Bon Stover of Oregon is 15th with
1!) catches.
There's a Taylor in the national scoring statistics, but he's from
LSU, and there are no other PCC men in this department.
Looks like the Indians proved their ability to draw a Southland
crowd last Saturday in the Coliseum. SC's crowd the week before
(against Washington State) was around 25,000, and previous crowds
have brought little in the form of $$.$ receipts. Seems funny that
so many more would come to hiss.
in a way it's odd that even the Indians would help to draw so
many fans to a game with this year's SC team. On the homo front
the Indians haven't been able to draw the crowds this year that the
Stadium saw during last year's schedule.
Hut there's one thing you can count on and that's darn near a
full house for BIG gAME, if not a lull one. Latest report from the
BAC indicates that tickets, with still a limited amount available,
are going fast. They're available at the BAC and at regular ticket
channels through the Peninsula and Bay Area.
A WORD IN ADVANCE: Couldn't help but pick the Trojans
over Oregon (you'll see, tomorrow). This is probably the year's
greatest manifestation of wishful thinking, but you've got to admit
it's a possibility. There's some good material in the Smogland squad,
and if all goes well for Don Clark I really think his boys can upset
Ihe Oregon rose peddler's cart (for this week, anyway).
Of course in order to do it I'm surmising that Oregon will be a
little overconfident, and "down" for the game, and that things will go
right for a change for Don Clark. If they don't, I wonder what he'll
be doing next year at this lime???? I wonder anyway.

Ran into Stanford great Bob Mathia* at the SU Alumni Party in
Ihe L.A. Ambassador the night before the SC game. At that lime,
to quote him, he'd been out of the Marines "two years, one month
and 26 days," had been in the advertising business for a while, and
now plans to switch to acting permanently.
He's working in an independent film outfit set up by John Wayne,
and just finished a movie in which he co-stars with Wayne. Flick's
name is "China Doll" and Bob plays Wayne's first lieulenant co
pilot.
To my way of figuring one of the best, at least most appropriate,
of the Trojan fraternity row house decorations went unmentioned.
It shows a degree of realism not often found filtering through the
smog. Sign read: "Hell Yes, We're Poor Losers!"
IJP AND COMlNG—lndian hoop coach Howie Dallmar reports
that basketball practices are speeding up these days, and the first
big intrasquad scrimmage is set for tomorrow. The turnout has
been cut to a 12-man varsity squad and a 14-man JV set. But the
players are alternating between the two squads and nothing re
garding a final, or even preliminary, starting lineup is definite.
Dick Haga and Neal Brockmeyer are alternating at the center
spot, with Haga, Jerry Thuesen, John Pfluger and John Arrillaga at
forwards. Doug Warren and Paul Neumann are working at guards.

IJP AND COMlNG—lndian hoop coach Howie Dallmar reports
that basketball practices are speeding up these days, and the first
big intrasquad scrimmage is set for tomorrow. The turnout has
been cut to a 12-man varsity squad and a 14-man JV set. But the
players are alternating between the two squads and nothing re
garding a final, or even preliminary, starting lineup is definite.
Dick Haga and Neal Brockmeyer are alternating at the center
spot, with Haga, Jerry Thuesen, John Pfluger and John Arrillaga at
forwards. Doug Warren and Paul Neumann are working at guards.
Douglas, Shea Up in National Stats
National football statistics were released yesterday, and Stan
ford fans will note that quarterback Jackie Douglas, with a total
offense of 850, tics with Army's Don Anderson for 14th place across
the U.S. Bob Newman, Washington State, is third. The King Hill
half of the Rice Owls' dangerous duo (Frank Ryan and Hill) is
tenth.
Chuck Shea of the Indians is the only PCC man to place in rush
ing stats with an eighth ranked spot. He's carried for 641 yards.
Newman leads the nation in passing; 75 out of 140 for a .536 mark.
Douglas has a higher percentage in tenth spot, but has completed
fewer aerials. Jack'.v totals are 62 for 113, and .549.
Don lOJlingscn of the Cougars is ihe nation's third rated pass
receiver, with 34 to his credit. Bon Stover of Oregon is 15th with
1!) catches.
There's a Taylor in the national scoring statistics, but he's from
LSU, and there are no other PCC men in this department.
Looks like the Indians proved their ability to draw a Southland
crowd last Saturday in the Coliseum. SC's crowd the week before
(against Washington State) was around 25,000, and previous crowds
have brought little in the form of $$.$ receipts. Seems funny that
so many more would come to hiss.
in a way it's odd that even the Indians would help to draw so
many fans to a game with this year's SC team. On the homo front
the Indians haven't been able to draw the crowds this year that the
Stadium saw during last year's schedule.
Hut there's one thing you can count on and that's darn near a
full house for BIG gAME, if not a lull one. Latest report from the
BAC indicates that tickets, with still a limited amount available,
are going fast. They're available at the BAC and at regular ticket
channels through the Peninsula and Bay Area.
A WORD IN ADVANCE: Couldn't help but pick the Trojans
over Oregon (you'll see, tomorrow). This is probably the year's
greatest manifestation of wishful thinking, but you've got to admit
it's a possibility. There's some good material in the Smogland squad,
and if all goes well for Don Clark I really think his boys can upset
Ihe Oregon rose peddler's cart (for this week, anyway).
Of course in order to do it I'm surmising that Oregon will be a
little overconfident, and "down" for the game, and that things will go
right for a change for Don Clark. If they don't, I wonder what he'll
be doing next year at this lime???? I wonder anyway.

Boh Mathias Switches to Acting Career
Ran into Stanford great Bob Mathia* at the SU Alumni Party in
Ihe L.A. Ambassador the night before the SC game. At that lime,
to quote him, he'd been out of the Marines "two years, one month
and 26 days," had been in the advertising business for a while, and
now plans to switch to acting permanently.
He's working in an independent film outfit set up by John Wayne,
and just finished a movie in which he co-stars with Wayne. Flick's
name is "China Doll" and Bob plays Wayne's first lieulenant co
pilot.
To my way of figuring one of the best, at least most appropriate,
of the Trojan fraternity row house decorations went unmentioned.
It shows a degree of realism not often found filtering through the
smog. Sign read: "Hell Yes, We're Poor Losers!"
IJP AND COMlNG—lndian hoop coach Howie Dallmar reports
that basketball practices are speeding up these days, and the first
big intrasquad scrimmage is set for tomorrow. The turnout has
been cut to a 12-man varsity squad and a 14-man JV set. But the
players are alternating between the two squads and nothing re
garding a final, or even preliminary, starting lineup is definite.
Dick Haga and Neal Brockmeyer are alternating at the center
spot, with Haga, Jerry Thuesen, John Pfluger and John Arrillaga at
forwards. Doug Warren and Paul Neumann are working at guards.
