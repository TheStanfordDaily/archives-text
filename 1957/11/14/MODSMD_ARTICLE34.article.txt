# Byrer Probable Starter
## 
### 
Jim Byrer worked at right
halfback and Jeri MeMillin at
flanker back on ihe first team as
Stanford went through a damp
day of practice yesterday. The
Cards will go through final drills
today before enplaning tomorrow
for Corvallis and their game with
Oregon State.
Coach Chuck Taylor said the
Indians would taper off today.
Yesterday's workout was also of
the minimum-contact variety as
the Tribe worked on defensive
set-ups and offensive polish.
Following the workout, Taylor
said he expected Byrer woidd
start in the position left open by
the injury to A 1 Harrington. He

added, however, that MeMillin
would probably shift to Harring
ton's old spot in some defensive
situations. That would leave both
Jackie Taylor and MeMillin in
the defensive backfield.
! Taylor, who left practice early

I to take heat treatments on his
leg, will also see action at flanker
I back and probably at quarter
back, where he will spell Jackie
j Douglas.
The report on Harrington, who
! broke his jaw against USO, was
1 that he definitely won't kick
1 P.A.T.'s against Oregon State,
j but is almost sure to boot against
I California next week.'
Van Galder Iteady
Gary Van Galder, who several
days ago had been rated only 50-
50 to play against the Beavers,
was pronounced fit to go. Taylor
said he didn't know yet whether
he would start Van Galder or
Ben Robinson at the end spot.
Van Galder has been bothered
with a kidney condition that kept
! him from suiting up Monday and
restricted him to light working
out Tuesday..
