manufacture, distribution or installation
of the equipment needed for the nation
wide communications network of 49
million Bell telephones.

veloped for production; where repeaters
for the new transatlantic telephone

cable wore tailor-made—there's a con
stant need for new products and now
processes. Two-thirds of the equipment ,
we make today for the Bell telephone »
companies is of types developed since
World War II. ' -d
Besides telephone work, Western
Electric—over the years —has been re- '
sponsible for a continuous flow of de
fense jobs for the government such as

the Nike guided missile

Line.

cialization. So —whether
