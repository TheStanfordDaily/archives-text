# FLU BOOSTS BUSINESS
## Rest Homes Provide Service; Sponsored by Mothers' Club 
### Nina Elkind 
During the rccent Asian influenza epidemic many Stanford stu
dents spent some time in the Men's and Women's Rest Homes. These
homes are run as a service to the students by Mrs. Elmer Hoagland,
who runs the Men's Rest Home, and Mrs. George Murray, who runs
the Women's Rest Home.
Mrs. Hoagland accepted her job nearly 12 years ago when the

Men's Rest Home was moved to
its present location. Previously it
had been set up in professor Ter
man's home while he was in
Washington, D.C.
The Mothers' Club of Stanford
University sponsors this rest
home, and they rent the house
from the University, to whom it
was left by the wife of the late
professor Coover.
In order for a man to be ad
mitted, he must be sent by the
Health Service. Dr. John Eckert
visits the home once a day, and
he is the one who releases the
patients.
Because of the flu outbreak,
there have been more patients
this year than at this time any
other year; nearly 150 men have
been admitted. Six weeks is the
longest any man has stayed in
the home.
"I have found this job very en
joyable and interesting," added
Mrs. Hoagland during our inter
view. "There are pleasant days
and bad days, of course, but I
have found the boys very nice to
take care of. I think they are
quite fortunate to have a place
such as this."
Also sponsored by the Stanford
Mothers' Club is the Women's
Rest Home. The house was willed
to the club by the owner to be
used for University purposes.
For 20 years it has been run by
Mrs. Murray, who says:"The
nice thing about it is I'm taking
care of youth, and they bounce
back and get well so fast."
Women are admitted and dis
charged only by Health Service
doctors; a doctor visits every day.
The average length of time that
women remain in the home is two
and one-half days, and the longest
amount of time anyone has ever
stayed is three weeks.
This has been the busiest fall
quarter for the Women's Rest
Home, with a grand total of well
over 100 patients.
Cooking in the home is done by
Mrs. Thornton, who has held the
job for nearly six years. How
ever, Mrs. Murray has been ad
vised by Dr. Eckert that the girls
should drink water in order to be
fed.

used for University purposes.
For 20 years it has been run by
Mrs. Murray, who says:"The
nice thing about it is I'm taking
care of youth, and they bounce
back and get well so fast."
Women are admitted and dis
charged only by Health Service
doctors; a doctor visits every day.
The average length of time that
women remain in the home is two
and one-half days, and the longest
amount of time anyone has ever
stayed is three weeks.
This has been the busiest fall
quarter for the Women's Rest
Home, with a grand total of well
over 100 patients.
Cooking in the home is done by
Mrs. Thornton, who has held the
job for nearly six years. How
ever, Mrs. Murray has been ad
vised by Dr. Eckert that the girls
should drink water in order to be
fed.
During the rccent Asian influenza epidemic many Stanford stu
dents spent some time in the Men's and Women's Rest Homes. These
homes are run as a service to the students by Mrs. Elmer Hoagland,
who runs the Men's Rest Home, and Mrs. George Murray, who runs
the Women's Rest Home.
Mrs. Hoagland accepted her job nearly 12 years ago when the

Men's Rest Home was moved to
its present location. Previously it
had been set up in professor Ter
man's home while he was in
Washington, D.C.
The Mothers' Club of Stanford
University sponsors this rest
home, and they rent the house
from the University, to whom it
was left by the wife of the late
professor Coover.
In order for a man to be ad
mitted, he must be sent by the
Health Service. Dr. John Eckert
visits the home once a day, and
he is the one who releases the
patients.
Because of the flu outbreak,
there have been more patients
this year than at this time any
other year; nearly 150 men have
been admitted. Six weeks is the
longest any man has stayed in
the home.
"I have found this job very en
joyable and interesting," added
Mrs. Hoagland during our inter
view. "There are pleasant days
and bad days, of course, but I
have found the boys very nice to
take care of. I think they are
quite fortunate to have a place
such as this."
Also sponsored by the Stanford
Mothers' Club is the Women's
Rest Home. The house was willed
to the club by the owner to be
used for University purposes.
