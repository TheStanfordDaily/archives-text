The final touches are being add- j
cd to the 1937 production of Gaie
ties as rehearsals draw to a close.
A cast of 70 will be featured in
Ihe show, according to Ram's

it a satire on everything from
football to Wagner," stated Nan

tain on the Tuesday and Thurs
day shows to allow for the Tues

girls will be on hand to lend their
talents to the skits and production
numbers.
