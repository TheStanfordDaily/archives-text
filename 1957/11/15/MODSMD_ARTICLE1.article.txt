# Searchers Find 15 Bodies from Downed Plane
## Shoeless Victims Lead to Belief That Plane Tried to Land in Ocean 
### 
HONOLULU (A-*) Fifteen bodies, all shoeless and most with life
jackets, from the lost airliner "Romance of the Skies" were picked
up yesterday from an 11-by-3-mile debris-scattered area of the Pacific
953 miles northeast of here, the aircraft carrier Philippine Sea re
ported.
The carrier reported it had a flotilla of small boats recovering and

delivering bodies and bits of de
bris to its decks.
The fact that most of the bod
ies were shoeless and wore life
jackets led to conjecture here
(hat the big Pan American
Stratocruiser had tried to land in
the sea after its last message late
last Friday afternoon, and that
its 36 passengers and eight crew
members started standard ditch
ing procedure.
The Philippine Sea reported
the bodies and debris apparently
had been scattered by drift, and
that helicopters were assisting
the boats in locating the grim tar
gets of the search.
External Injuries
All the bodies had external in
juries and multiple fractures, the
report said. It said the cause of
death was considered to be from
extensive injuries and fractures.
Early yesterday, nine of the 15
bodies were located floating on
the surface, one reportedly still
strapped in a seat.
The Pan American Stratocruis
er, with 41 persons aboard, van
ished silently last Friday after
noon on a routine flight from San
Francisco to Honolulu.
The tragic discovery was made
by a search plane from the air
craft carrier Philippine Sea. The
carrier and escorting vessels sped
to the scene and put over boats
which began fishing for the
wreckage and bodies.
Search Planes
One of two Pan American
search planes which had gone out
on the hunt early yesterday ra
dioed at about the same time that
it was over the area and that two
of the bodies were wearing life
jackets.
The carrier pilot who made the
original sighting said one body
remained strapped in a seat of
the lost Stratocruiser.
Land-based search planes were
recalled and the surface vessels
began converging on the location.
The Philippine Sea reported
that the discovery site was a con
siderable distance northeast, of
the area where a Pan American
plane late Wednesday had sight
ed some unidentifned matter in
the water.
The N'avy said it was 88 miles
north of the customary route of
passenger planes from San Fran
cisco to Honolulu.
