with music department head William Crostcn yesterday. He later
attended the dress rehearsal of (he symphony-chorus concert which
opens tonight.
Schuman is in the Bay Area to inspect Ihc many new plants for

the performing of the arts.
These new buildings are of spe
cial interesl to Schuman since
New York's planned Lincoln Cen
ter will contain new facilities for
Juilliard as well as for the other
performing arts.
The center will provide a home
for the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany; the Philharmonic; drama
and ballet troupes; and a novel
museum-library of the perform
ing arts, Schuman said.
Juilliard will become a school
for advanced study not only of
music but also of drama and
dance.
"We now have about 1400 stu
dents at Juilliard," Schuman said,
"tho genius class. Since the en
rollment will have to be de
creased, we will be limiting our
selves to the 'clever' geniuses
now."
All artistic and academic train
ing will be tailor made for the
individual. Students will not be
required to take academic
courses, Schuman said.
"It is important to keep the
students in the school so that
they will receive all the training
they need in order to develop
their talents to the greatest ex
tent," Schuman said. They will
sign contracts not to accept jobs
before they are ready or they
cannot do which might jeopar
dize their careers later.
There will be sufficient funds
available so that students will
not have to give up their studies.
Schuman became president of
Juilliard in 1945. He has studied
with Haubiel, Persin and Roy
Harris. lie has composed several
symphonies, cantatas, and inci
dental music as well as the ballet
"Undertow."
