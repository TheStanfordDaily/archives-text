# Taylormen Invade Beaverland; Look For Sixth Victory
## Chuck Predicts Victory 'If We Get the Breaks' Byrer Slated to Start In Harrington's Spot; Van Galder Set to Go 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
Stanford will attempt tomor
row to do what no other team has
ever doneâ€”boat Tommy Prot ti
ro's Oregon Staters in their own
den.
Prothro has been at Corvallis
for nearly three years now, and
has yet to taste defeat on homo
soil.
The Indians have a good chance
to snap this skein. Picked a! the
start of the year as a seventh
place team, Chuck Taylor's ag
gregation has come along to post:
a 5-3 record, and might be 7-1 if
the ball had bounced differently
on a couple of occasions.
"Wo Can Win"
"Sure, I think we can win."
commented Taylor. "But we're
going to need all the breaks.
They're a very good team."
Prothro's club has been a bit
of a disappointment, although
they've lost just twice this year.
But at the start of the season,
Oregon State was picked almost
unanimously to repeat as Pacific
Coast Conference champions.
After rising to sixth place in
national polls on the strength of
four straight wins, the Beavers
had the dam cave in on them.
UCLA tromped the Rose Bowl
losers, and then Washington won
its first game of the year in a
big upset.
Solid, Itougli
Stanford, however, won't find
itself meeting a collapsing team
of any sort. The Beavers are
solid all the way through, and
they're rough, too.
The defensive problem for
Stanford, and also the solution,
will be similar to that encoun
tered against UCLA. If the Card
defense is as effective against the
single - wing Beavers as it. was
against the single - wing Bruin ,
then the Indian record will prob
ably run to 6-3.
Taylor said last night he didn't,
yet know whether Jim Byrer or
Jeri McMillin would start against
the Beavers, He continued that.
Byrer would probably get the
nod, but that the pregame toss
of the coin might determine the;
choice.
Jeri on Defense
The Stanford plan is to have
McMillin in on defense as much
as the substitution rules will al
low. The burden of the flanker
back duties on offense will fall to
Jack Taylor, and he will also be
in on defense with McMillin.
A 1 Harrington, whose place By
rer and McMillin are taking, will
make the trip to OSC but won't
suit up. Taylor said that it i.
now doubtful that he will be
available for P.A.T. duty against
California. He reasoned that doe
tors would probably not let Har
rington run the risk of jarring
his jaw and possibly damaging
it further.
The Tribe's other main casual
jty Gary Van Galder is ready
i to si art following a quick recu
' peration from a kidney injury,
j How long he plays will hp deter-
I mined hy his condition as the
game progresses. Ben Robinson
will he held in reserve for Van
; Galder.
The remainder of (he lineup as
announced hy Taylor will he the
same as that which opened
against the Trojans last Satur
! day.
The Taylormen will again bank
on the passing of Jackie Douglas
I and the power-running of Chuck
j Shea, plus the ground-gaining of
I whoever is in Harrington's old
j spot.
Tops in Offense
This combination has sent Ihe
i Indians to the top of ihe heap in
PCC total offense with an aver
age of more than 3f)o yards per
I game.

Listen to Jackie Douglas' and
I) ii tc h Fehring discuss the
Stanford - Oregon State game
and sports in general on "'The
Experts Predict," tonight at 7
oil KZSiL!. They will be joined
by Daily sports editor Dick
Barnes, KZSU sports director
Bill Khoadcs and moderator
Steve Baffrey on the weekly
program.

Another integral part of Ihe
Stanford offense has been the ex
cellent receiving of the ends, Van
Galder, Dick Stein and Joel Freis.
Concentrating primarily on the
short aerial, Douglas and his re
ceivers have been able to loosen
up defenses enough to make the
power game doubly effective.
Oregon State features a triple-

J threat backfield led hy tailback-
Joe Francis. Francis, however,
may not be at full effectiveness
for the game. Ho rejoined the
team only Wednesday following
a recent bout with the flit.
Earnel Durden, a wingback
I who makes the reverse one of
OSC's best gainers; and Nub
j Beamer, the PCCs second-best
rusher from his fullback slot, are
- the other bright spots iti the Bea
; ver backfield.
Bates Tops in Line
i The big man in the line for the
| Beavers is tackle Ted Hates. In
dian assistant coach Dutch Fehr
ing, who scouted Oregon State,
j said Bates is much more agile
and speedy than John Witte, the
l Beaver All - American of a year
i ago.
The Stanford party will leave
campus at 7:30 for San Francisco
International Airport. They're
I expected back at Stanford by 10
' p.m. Saturday.
