# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Barbara Hicks
## Cost of Studying Rises

."an Jose State College students are finding,
with their Stanford neighbors, that the cost of
college living is going up. A near TOO per cent
increase has been proposed in student lees at
,Kaccording to the Spartan Daily. Officials
reported that the cost of operating the state
college has gone up 23.7 per cent, and they sug
£» si raising semester fees from $20 to $40.
Across the Bay, University of California stu
rli nis are also struggling with rising costs. The
columns of the Daily Californian l'eveal that a
rent charge to students attending home bas
ketball games is being favored. The proposal
would not take effect until next year.
The Daily Kansan has a nomination for "Jerks
of the Week." Kansas University students have
been sponsoring a Little Man on Campus contest
and, says the Daily Kansan, "The hucksters have
been at their raucous worst this week." It seems
• uonsors of a LMOC candidate moved in on a
press interview with Senator John Kennedy <D-
Mass.) who visited the KU campus, requesting
the senator to pose with their man. They also
tried to print a phony senatorial "endorsement"
in ilie columns of the Daily Kansan, which com-

merits, "This sort of juvenile foolishness has
gone on long enough. The LMOC contest, should
be abolished if antics such as ihese result."
Trojans arc still trying to gel their ticker tape
to work. The card stunts—which failed to mate
rialize at the Stanford-IJSC game—can and will
work, says Trojan Knight President Merv Klrsh
ner in the Daily Trojan. "We need more partici
pation during the practice sessions."

Is it Johns Hopkins Hospital or Johns Hopkins
University? That's the question posed in the
editorial columns of the JH News Letter. The
writer is concerned over the essentially "local
stock" of the University. "Last year there were
1326 undergraduates in the Hopkins Day School,
including G37 Baltimoreans, and a total of 822
Marylanders." Hence little more than one-third
of the undergraduates were drawn from the
"nation." The editorial writer attributes the dif
ficulty to the fame of Johns Hopkins as a medi
cal school, a fame which is built up through
alumni, and national publicity on medical discov
eries. Officials are attempting 1o ameliorate the
Hopkins dilemma but, said one, "it's a seed here
and a seed there ... a painfully slow process."
