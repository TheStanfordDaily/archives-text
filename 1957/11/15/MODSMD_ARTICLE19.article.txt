Return Home—To Los Angeles
Editor, The Daily:
Andreas Brown's recent loiter is in error in as
• fi ling that The Daily is publishing the deluge of
Williamson letters because of "its insidious de
• tic lo keep the whole matter before the public.'
Jn reality, the insidious public is to blame for ox
i (Vising its insidious desire to freely express it
.''■II. The Daily can bo properly castigated in pub-
Ji liing the original Williamson article, however.
< ')(-;irly ihis was a case where editorial policy
bowed to public opinion, and the public's even
more insidious desire to bo informed. A news
paper, by its very name, should properly devote
itself solely to Peanuts, Abby and Goren.
I'.iil Mr. Brown severely underestimates the
< ommunicative powers of the mass media that
insidious cartel in asserting that, had The Daily
• oppressed the Williamson article, none of us
would know that the incident had taken place.
W<- must make war upon all of these spreaders
r,f information.
We must work quickly, Mr. Brown, for there
arc few at Stanford who agree with us. Somn
ppople here ihink so much of knowledge that
11 if-y have turned away from homo and family to
pursue it here. Lot us, therefore, return home
1o Los Angeles -where wo can reunite ourselves
with our families. There are, moreover, a num
ber of institutions down there whose citizens
share our view of knowledge. Lot. us matriculate
among friends and go out for football, therefore
to make our living.

TYomm Hypothesis Confirmed
Editor, The Daily:
Again the Fromm hypothesis has been con
firmed. My condolences to Andreas Brown for
his slight case of moral masochism. As an ama
teur psychologist I recommend that Mr. Brown

read the following letter to cure him of his Iran
mata.
He accuses Williamson of being a "collabora
tor with the enemy"; f accuse him, however, of a
subtle form of connivance with "the enemy,"
namely, wanting to restrict and nullify the guar
antees of the Bill of Rights. The real enemy of
America is authoritarianism in all its forms.
Williamson is not an apologist for authoritarian
ism; Brown is.
Brown also seeks to abridge the First Amend
ment of the Constitution to restrict freedom of
the press. He seems to object when newspapers
print what is newsworthy; hence he imputes to
The Daily an "insidious desire" to stir up con
troversy. Brown is to be congratulated for his
letter of Nov. 8, which clearly plays into the
hands of the insidious Daily reporters; he in
sidiously contributes to the insidious contro
versy!
1 got a special kick out of Brown's following
hypothesis, which he regards as irrefutable: "If
The Daily had only 'refused to recognize' that
one of its students had over made this trip, none
of us would know that it had taken place"!
Brown apparently regards Stanford students, in
cluding himself, as ignorant of current affairs.
Stanford students, however, do not live on a
Daily newspaper diet, Mr. Brown.

Hole of Stanford Ratio
Editor, The Daily:
Unless my memory fails me, the same learned
Dr. Jewell Cross, responsible for the shrewd
analysis in today's [Nov. 11] Daily of the role of
1ho Stanford ratio in automobile accidents, arose
at the Political Union meeting at which Senator
Hennings spoke, lo attribute investigating com
mit lee abuses to the frustration of committee
members caused by the absence of female sena
tors on their committees.
