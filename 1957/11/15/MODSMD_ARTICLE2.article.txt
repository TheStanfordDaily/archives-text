# Senior Class Denied Petition To Show Flick
## 
### 
A petition of the senior class to
show a 35-millimeter movie in
Memorial Auditorium to increase
the class coffers was defeated by
a vote of 8-5 at last night's Legis
lature meeting in Bowman Alum
ni House.
The motion was defeated be
cause it might "jeopardize" the
position of the Sunday Evening
Flicks. Theater managers in the
area have claimed that student
showings at cut rates on the cam
pus constitute "unfair" competi
tion.
Senior Class President Jerry
Beys had contended that since
the showing would consist of
cartoons and an old feature such
as a Charlie Chaplin or W. C.
Fields movie that this did not
constitute direct competition.
ASSU Business Manager Mar
tin Johnson pointed out that this
would be setting a precedent and
that any worthwhile cause would
have to be given similar permis
sion, constituting a real danger
to the already "precarious" posi
tion of the Sunday Flicks and the
shaky relations with distributors
in San Francisco.
Beys had requested the money
to replenish the senior class
treasury for activities such as
the Senior Ball and Ferryboat
Ride. The class donated $1000
last year to the Leavelle Memo
rial fund.
The flicks, tentatively sched
uled for Wednesday, Jan. 8, may
be shown in 16 millimeter.
In other action Legislature ap
pointed Tom Kranz, row repre
sentative, to the selection com
mittee for the Model United Na
tions; appointed Mary Griffing,
Branner representative, to min
utes committee and Ken Purcell,
Wilbur representative, to by-laws
committee, and approved the ap
pointment of Political Union of
ficers.
