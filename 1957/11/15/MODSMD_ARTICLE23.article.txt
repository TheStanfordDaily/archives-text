# THE 						Finish Line
## 
### Dick Barnes 
l our Touchdowns Needed io Win
We're off and flying for Oregon State bright and early this
morning, hoping and expecting to see Chuck Taylor's band of In
dians come home with a Heaver pelt. If all the scout reports are
tight, then this is going to he one of the year's most rugged games.
Hailing a downpour and weather reports say there won't be one
I look for a high-scoring battle. Probably, it'll take four touchdowns
io win.
If it comes down Io P.A.T.'s, the Indians might do better than they
have recently. After all five for live against the Trojans is a pretty
impressive record. Following last week's partial expose of the P.A.T.
.statistics, ii looked like time for another glance when SU kicked the
five perfects.
Sooo The pages were turned back to Nov. 12, 19f>.">, before
a better performance was found. In that 44-7 rout of Oregon, the
Cards went six-for-six on conversions. Lest you wonder, the extra
points came on a safety. The successful kickers in that regionally
televised game were Mike .Raftery, with four, and Jack Taylor and
Doug Dick, with one each.
Dear Oiaeh . . .
There has long been plenty of kidding about Ihe way football j
players are supposed to get classroom concessions. I'm not about to
say whether or not I think this is true, and I'm not going to launch
inlo any long dissertations on the subject. I'm merely going to use
the thought as an introduction for what I think is d very funny
Jet ter:
Dear Coach:
Remembering our discussion of your football men who were
having troubles 1 in English, I have decided to ask you, in turn, for
help.
We feel that Paul Spindleslianks, one of our most promising
scholars, has a chance for an excellent graduate scholarship, which
would be a great thing for him and for our college.
Paul has the academic record for this award, but we find that
the aspirant is also required to have other excellences, and ideally
should have a good record in athletics*. Paul is weak. He tries
hard, but he has troubles in athletics. But he does try hard.
We propose that you give some special consideration to Paul
as a varsity player, putting him if possible in the backfiehl of the
football team, in this way, we can show a better college record
to Ihe committee deciding on the scholarship.
We realize that Paul will be a problem 011 the field, but —as you
have often said —co-operation between our department and yours
is highly desirable, and we do expect Paul to try hard, of course.
During intervals of study we shall coach him as much as we
can. Ilis work in the English Club and on the debate team will
force him to miss many practices, but we intend to see that he
carries: an old football around to bounce (or whatever one does
with an old football) during intervals in his work.
We expect rani to show entire good will in his work for you,
and though he will not he able to begin football practice till late
in the season, he will finish the season with good attendance.
Sincerely,
Chairman, English Department
This hypothetical letter tat least I think it is) came via Presi- j
deniial Assistant Fred Glover. He, in turn, got it via a professor or
two. The originating point is supposed to have been a Big Ten
• chool. | don't suppose such a letter will ever appear in seriousness, j
but then maybe it would be a good thing if the coaches at a few of
the nation's real pressure schools received something like this.
Track Meets Will Be Even Better
Don't get the idea that football is the only sport doing anything!
at this time of year. In fact, practically every other sport fall, j
winter and spring—is in session now.
The wheels are running at a rapid clip in preparation for the |
spring track season. The meets here against USC and Oxy in '57 |
were fabulous, especially in comparison to anything Stanford had
seen previously. But Coaches Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain aren't \
about to stop the train of innovations.
Jordan already is getting plans down on paper for improved field
event markers and identification, and is toying with several other
ideas which- if approved—will add loads more to spectator pleasure
at the meets.
BRIEF PICK-UPS FROM THE WEEKEND IN LOS ANGELES—
The alumni blast at the Ambassador Friday night was a big success, i
The alums are really hot about this year's team, but they're curious
about the PCC and P.A.T. situations. . . . The Stanford Club of
Los Angeles presented athletic director A 1 Masters with a new Chev
rolet and a certificate of honor for his many years of devoted service
to Stanford athletics. . . . Several of the Southland sports men of
distinction (like Dick Nash, Clevc Herrmann and Gil Strattoni gol
disgusted and left the press box awfully early. . . . Nash, formerly
a Mirror-News writer and now with Santa Anita, was especially ve
hement in his denunciation of Trojan tackling. . . . The ill feelings j
which erupted in the final minutes of play didn't take long to heal.
.. . Don Dawson, ejected for fighting, was shaking hands with tho j
SO men in the locker room after the game.
