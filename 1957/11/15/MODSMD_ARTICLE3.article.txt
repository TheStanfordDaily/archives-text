# Farm Student Government Remains Touchy Subject

### Joan Woods Staff Editor 
(Editor's Note: This is (lie
last of a two-part series on stu
rl<Mit government at Stanford.
It took exactly 30 years for the
University to give students full
responsibility for their own af
fairs. After .SO years, what is
student government like to
day?)

The question of student govern
ment at Stanford was a touchy
one during the first 30 years of
the University before students
proved their right and their abil
ity to govern themselves.
But it is hardly a less touchy
issue today, with student cries of
"Red-hots!" directed often toward
those running for office, and with
Legislature members retaliating
by accusations of "Apathy!" on
the part of the student body
After the smoke has cleared
away, it becomes evident that
much of the fuss was caused by

misunderstanding on both sides
and by a general lack of knowl
edge about the functions of stu
dent government.
The preamble to the 10-page
constitution of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
states that the purposes of stu
dent government here are "to en
hance our educational, social and
cultural opportunities, further our
welfare and interest as students,
promote self-government and
leadership, and develop personal,
public and professional responsi
bility."
Government Divided
To accomplish these ends, the
government is divided into execu
tive. legislative and judicial
branches with numerous subsidi
ary groups and commissions.
Many students have said they
consider the structure top-heavy,
that student, administrators are
involved in too much "busy work,"
or that policy is ultimately decid
ed by the administration anyway.
Others insist that the coordina
i tion of social and other activities
; in a large university is a compli
cated process at best, and that a
student governing body with
smaller operating committees is
the only practicable way of deal-1
ing with the problem.
One member of Legislature said
l he ran for election with the one
purpose in mind of determining
j whether or not students did de
cide their own policies or merely
! rubber - stamped administration
J "suggestions."
His conclusion? "The adminis
j (ration manages the issues In such
a way thai the students think
'they arc doing it. They give Hip i
| students their say in trivial mat-j
1 tcrs, but decide important issues
themselves.
Up to Expectations
"Legislature could be the or- j
ganization that really got the pol
icy the students wanted, but for
1 the most part it lives up to the
I administration's expectations."
Students also express curiosity
and some cynicism on the reasons
potential lawmakers elect to run.
One member said it is "left-over

enthusiasm from high school.
They get used to being leaders."
Others, with an eye to graduate
school, run because they think
participation in student govern
ment will look nice on their ac
tivity records. Fraternities like to
get their house represented in stu
dent; government, while some stu
dents run "because they have
good ideas which they think will
benefit the student body in gen
eral."
Under the constitution adopted
three years ago, Legislature is the
supreme policy-making body. It
has jurisdiction over all student
activities and conduct, with power
to levy fees and to appropriate
and control ASSU funds.
Regular Members
Regular members are president,
vice president, undergraduate rep
resentatives elected from living
groups and graduate representa
tives elected by academic divi
sions. Ex-officio members with
out vote include financial director,
student financial manager, admin
istrative assistant and the editor
of The Daily.
The president is the chief exec
utive officer and official repre
sentative of the students. Tie pre
sides as president of the Legisla
ture and as chairman of the Cabi
net and has ex-officio membership
on all administrative boards and
commissions.
With Hie assistance of the Cabi
net an advisory body composed
of president, vice president, heads
of administrative boards, under
graduate class presidents and
graduate student representatives
he prepares his program for the
year and presents it and the budg
et for approval of the Legislature.
Third branch under the separa
tion-of-powers theory is the Judi
cial Council, a 10-man board com
posed of the members of Men's
and Women's Councils. Final ap
peal from their decisions may be
made to the office of president
J. E. Wallace Sterling.
