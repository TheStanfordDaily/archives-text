WHAT TO DO TILL THE
PSYCHIATRIST COMES
Once upon a time at the "University of Virgin in there was
a coed named, oddly enough, Virginia University who was
handsome and kindly and intelligent and ingeniously con
structed and majoring in psychology. Virginia went steady
with a young man on campus named, oddly enough,
Oddly Enough who was supple and fair and lit he and ani
mated and majoring in phys ed.
Virginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance Hint was n
idyllic as a summer day, as placid as a millpond. Never
did they tight—never, never, never!—because Virginia,
who was majoring in psychology, did not believe in light
ing. "Fighting," she often said, "settles nothing. I li<- < i
entific way is to look calmly for the cause of the friction.
So whenever she and Oddly were on the verge ol a
quarrel, she used to whip out a series of ink blot tests and
they would discover the true underlying cause of their
dispute and deal with it in an enlightened, dispas ion.'iie
manner. Then, the irritant removed, Iheir romance would
resume its tranquil, serene, unruffled course.
After six months of this sedate liaison. Oddly \va. o
bored he could spit. He loved Virginia well eiiou' h. bill
he also believed that people in love ought to light now
and then. "It opens the pores," he said. "And besides, ii
so much fun making up afterwards."
Rut Virginia would not be provoked into a quarrel.
One night Oddly Iried very hard. "Hey," he said to her,
"your hair looks like a bat's nest and your ears look like
last year's turnips and your face looks like a pan of worm
and as for your head, I've seen better heads on newel
posts."
"My goodness, we're hostile tonight !" said Virginia
cheerfully and whipped 120 Rorschach cards out ol her
reticule. "Come," she said, "let us examine your pwrhic
apparatus."

Oddly tried again. "Who makes your clothe ,) " he
sneered. "Bethlehem Si eel?
"Hmm," said Virginia thoughtfully and lit a cigarette
"This sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemi. m,
anagogic trauma, and a belt in the hack.
"I hate you," said Oddly. "I hale your looks am I your
elothes and your toenails and your relatives and the
cigaret tes you smoke."
"Now, hold on, buster!" eried Virginia, her eye crack
ling. her color mounting, her nostriIs aflame. "Jum keep a
civil tongue in your stupid head when you talk about
Marlboro! Nobody's knocking that filter, thai lla.vor,
that Hip-top box while (here's breath in my body! It's a
great cigarette, it's a doozv, it's a dilly, it s :i bear and
anybody who says a word against il gels (his."
By "this" Virginia meant ;i series of combination.- lo
the liead and liver, which she now delivered to (>ddl\ :md
turned on her heel and stormed away.
Oddly brought her down with a Hying tackle. ' I love
you," he said.
"And Marlboro?" said she.
"And Marlboro," said he.
And they kissed and plaited love knots In one another's
hair and were married at Whitsun and -moked h.ippilv
ever after.
