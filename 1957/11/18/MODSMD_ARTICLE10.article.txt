# Beavers Better Stanford, 24-14, As Card Forward Wall Falters
## Francis Tears Through Tribe For 274 Yards 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
PARKER STADIUM, Corvallr .
Ore., Nov. 16 Maybe the Big
Game will be different.
It better be, because if it's any
thing like the 24-14 pasting thai-
Stanford absorbed at the hands
of Oregon State today, Indians
and Indian fans will be in for an
awfully long Big Game.
The Cards were outplayed in
the line; their backs were oui
shown; their pass defense wa.s
riddled.
But, one-sided as the game was,
Stanford came within two offside
penalties and two dropped pas cs
of making quite a game of it.
Penalties Hurt
A first-quarter infraction cost
the Tribe a first down on the
Beaver Va-yard line and an almost
sure touchdown. Then, just as the
half was ending, the Cards recov
ered an OSC fumble on their own
3-yard line.
But Stanford was ruled off side
here, too; so the Beavers got an
extra play after time had run out,
and they scored.
The dropped passes came earl*
and late. The first came in ihe
initial play of the second period,
when the score was still 0-0. Stan
ford had driven from its 38 to li"
OSC 10-yard line, where it wa:
fourth down and 9 to go.
Incomplete
Jackie Douglas went back, spot
ted Dick Stein in the end zone and
threw. But Ihe ball bounced ol
Stein's chest, and that was it fo;
another Indian drive.
The other dropped TD pass di i
not mean much, since it came * i
the last play of the game and
couldn't have changed the l esul
It was a 32-yarder from Join
Bond to Jeri McMillin, whic h .1 i i
had in the clear on the 14 but lo:
Statistically, there was no com
parison between the two club:.
OSC racked up 422 yards on 11k
ground and through Ihe air, to
just 288 for Stanford. In fit i
downs it was 24-14. Of course
these stats are about as expecb I
when it is seen that the winner
had 73 offensive plays to 54 Joi
the Cards.
Not Really Sic k
The man responsible for nearh
two-thirds of the Oregon Slate
yardage was tailback Joe Franc 1
supposedly a sick man. Even aliei
the game, OSC mentor Tom nr.
j Prothro was insisting thai Fran
cis was in bad shape, but you
t couldn't prove it by anyone who
saw the game.
All the senior from Hawaii did
was run for 138 yards and com
plete 9 of 10 passes for 136 yards
He scored two of the touchdowns
himself and passed to Bob D<
Grant for a third.
Francis was especially profi
! cient at hurdling Stanford tar ! <
lers who were crouched low to hit
him. But the biggest factor in his
I success was the clearing-away job
j his line did for him.
Seldom in Trouble
Francis was rarely in trouble
! passing and usually could have all
ihe time he needed to spot his rc
ceivers. He nearly always had
plenty of time to turn the cornei
on end sweeps, too. as the St a
I ford defenders couldn't break
i through the Beaver interferene"
The game began on a bright
: note for Stanford as it won thr
j coin toss for the seventh time in
' nine games. The Cards moved


INTO STARTING LINEUP—Jim Byrer, moved
up to the first, string* in place of injured A 1 Har
rington, gained 41 yards on eight carries for a

5.1 average a.«- the Cards fell to OSC, 21-14.

GOT HIM THIS TlME—Rick McMillen upended Oregon State's
Joe Francis this time in Saturday's Beaver-Indian tilt, hut the
Cards didn't duplicate the feat enough times. Francis accounted
for H74 yards, running and passing. Don Manoukian is the Stan
ford man moving in to help.

right down the field until Jim
Byrer lost the ball to OSC at
the 37.
Oregon State returned the favor
as it drove to the Stanford 24.
Then Francis got in trouble cir
cling end, was hit and fumbled
into the arms of McMiflin.
All for Naught
The Cards punted a few plays
later, then got the ball back as
Hick McMillen leaped high to in
t<n<-pt a Francis pass. Then the
Indians began the march that was
to end with the dropped pass.
In six plays, the Indians got to
ihe OSC 11. Douglas tossed to
Hen Robinson for 4, then McMil
len hit to the 3. He went to the
Ms-yard line for a first down on
the next play, but then came the
offside penalty that set the Cards
back.
So instead of firsthand-Ms, it was
third-and-7. Ami when McMillen
was dropped for a 3-yard loss,
Stanford was in trouble that it
couldn't get out of.
First of Four
OSC took over on the 10 and
promptly marched 90 yards for
the go-ahead score. Francis and
Nub Beamer carried most of the
lime, with the long-gainer a 20-
yard end sweep by Francis that
brought the ball to Stanford's 26.
The payoff was a 9-yard Fran
cis-to-De Grant pass that the OSC
end caught on the ground in the
end zone. Ted Searle's attempted
kick marked the start of a con
version-less day for the Beavers.
Stanford couldn't do anything
significant following the kickoff,
so OSC got the ball again. A 19-
yard Francis -to - Earnel Durden
pass put them on the 1 as time
was running out.
Beamer plowed into the middle
and didn't gain a thing as the
clock read 10 seconds to play. OSC
quickly came to the line, and the
snap was made with one second
remaining. Beamer went to his
left, fumbled, and the Cards re
covered.

But — a handkerchief on the
play. Virtually all observers
thought the Beavers were guilty
of not coming to a full second
stop before the snap. Most of the
reserves were already on their
way to the locker room.
So the Indians are ruled off
side, Oregon State gets an extra
play in the half, and Beamer
plunges over for the 12-0 half-time
lead.
Another Fumble
Oregon State took the third-pe
riod kickoff and used up 4:22
driving to a touchdown as Francis
swept end for the points. Stan
ford's only threat ended in a
Chuck Shea fumble on OSC's 37.
Stanford finally scored midway
through the final period. The key
play was a 38 - yard pass from
Douglas to Joel Freis, who made
an excellent lunging catch before
he fell.
Two runs and an incompleted
pass later, Douglas cleverly evad
ed three tacklers and threw to
McMillen. Rick had gotten behind
his man on what he said was an
unplanned play, and he pulled the
ball in for the touchdown.
Took No Chances
Oregon State took no chances
on a fast finish by Stanford, and
lengthened the count to 24-7 as
only 1:02 remained to play.
The Cards weren't through,
though, and Jim Sinnerud ran the
kickoff back to the 39. An inter
ference penalty moved Stanford
wit hit} 9 yards of the goal. With
13 seconds left, Bob Nicolet threw
to Irv Nicolai, who twisted into
the end zone.
The Last Gasp
In the seconds remaining, Stan
ford recovered an on-side kick and
tried for one more touchdown. But
it was in vain anyway, and the
gun sounded with the score 24-14.
So it's on to the Big Game for
Stanford. As usual in the Cal
battle, all the records will be
thrown out the window. And, hope
the Indians, so will all traces of
their performance against Oregon
State.


IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKK IT—Jackie Douglas' fourth-and nine
pass to Dick Stein almost made it into the end zone for a touch
down, but not quite. Actually, it did get into pay-dirt area, but
bounced off Stein's chest and onto the ground, incomplete. The
play occurred on the first play of ihe second period.

First of Four
OSC took over on the 10 and
promptly marched 90 yards for
the go-ahead score. Francis and
Nub Beamer carried most of the
lime, with the long-gainer a 20-
yard end sweep by Francis that
brought the ball to Stanford's 26.
The payoff was a 9-yard Fran
cis-to-De Grant pass that the OSC
end caught on the ground in the
end zone. Ted Searle's attempted
kick marked the start of a con
version-less day for the Beavers.
Stanford couldn't do anything
significant following the kickoff,
so OSC got the ball again. A 19-
yard Francis -to - Earnel Durden
pass put them on the 1 as time
was running out.
Beamer plowed into the middle
and didn't gain a thing as the
clock read 10 seconds to play. OSC
quickly came to the line, and the
snap was made with one second
remaining. Beamer went to his
left, fumbled, and the Cards re
covered.

But — a handkerchief on the
play. Virtually all observers
thought the Beavers were guilty
of not coming to a full second
stop before the snap. Most of the
reserves were already on their
way to the locker room.
So the Indians are ruled off
side, Oregon State gets an extra
play in the half, and Beamer
plunges over for the 12-0 half-time
lead.
Another Fumble
Oregon State took the third-pe
riod kickoff and used up 4:22
driving to a touchdown as Francis
swept end for the points. Stan
ford's only threat ended in a
Chuck Shea fumble on OSC's 37.
Stanford finally scored midway
through the final period. The key
play was a 38 - yard pass from
Douglas to Joel Freis, who made
an excellent lunging catch before
he fell.
Two runs and an incompleted
pass later, Douglas cleverly evad
ed three tacklers and threw to
McMillen. Rick had gotten behind
his man on what he said was an
unplanned play, and he pulled the
ball in for the touchdown.
Took No Chances
Oregon State took no chances
on a fast finish by Stanford, and
lengthened the count to 24-7 as
only 1:02 remained to play.
The Cards weren't through,
though, and Jim Sinnerud ran the
kickoff back to the 39. An inter
ference penalty moved Stanford
wit hit} 9 yards of the goal. With
13 seconds left, Bob Nicolet threw
to Irv Nicolai, who twisted into
the end zone.
The Last Gasp
In the seconds remaining, Stan
ford recovered an on-side kick and
tried for one more touchdown. But
it was in vain anyway, and the
gun sounded with the score 24-14.
So it's on to the Big Game for
Stanford. As usual in the Cal
battle, all the records will be
thrown out the window. And, hope
the Indians, so will all traces of
their performance against Oregon
State.


IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKK IT—Jackie Douglas' fourth-and nine
pass to Dick Stein almost made it into the end zone for a touch
down, but not quite. Actually, it did get into pay-dirt area, but
bounced off Stein's chest and onto the ground, incomplete. The
play occurred on the first play of ihe second period.

Game will be different.
It better be, because if it's any
thing like the 24-14 pasting thai-
Stanford absorbed at the hands
of Oregon State today, Indians
and Indian fans will be in for an
awfully long Big Game.
The Cards were outplayed in
the line; their backs were oui
shown; their pass defense wa.s
riddled.
But, one-sided as the game was,
Stanford came within two offside
penalties and two dropped pas cs
of making quite a game of it.
Penalties Hurt
A first-quarter infraction cost
the Tribe a first down on the
Beaver Va-yard line and an almost
sure touchdown. Then, just as the
half was ending, the Cards recov
ered an OSC fumble on their own
3-yard line.
But Stanford was ruled off side
here, too; so the Beavers got an
extra play after time had run out,
and they scored.
The dropped passes came earl*
and late. The first came in ihe
initial play of the second period,
when the score was still 0-0. Stan
ford had driven from its 38 to li"
OSC 10-yard line, where it wa:
fourth down and 9 to go.
Incomplete
Jackie Douglas went back, spot
ted Dick Stein in the end zone and
threw. But Ihe ball bounced ol
Stein's chest, and that was it fo;
another Indian drive.
The other dropped TD pass di i
not mean much, since it came * i
the last play of the game and
couldn't have changed the l esul
It was a 32-yarder from Join

Statistically, there was no com
parison between the two club:.
OSC racked up 422 yards on 11k
ground and through Ihe air, to
just 288 for Stanford. In fit i
downs it was 24-14. Of course
these stats are about as expecb I
when it is seen that the winner
had 73 offensive plays to 54 Joi
the Cards.
Not Really Sic k
The man responsible for nearh
two-thirds of the Oregon Slate
yardage was tailback Joe Franc 1

Oregon State returned the favor
as it drove to the Stanford 24.

into the arms of McMiflin.
All for Naught
The Cards punted a few plays
later, then got the ball back as
Hick McMillen leaped high to in

Indians began the march that was
to end with the dropped pass.
In six plays, the Indians got to
ihe OSC 11. Douglas tossed to

GOT HIM THIS TlME—Rick McMillen upended Oregon State's
Joe Francis this time in Saturday's Beaver-Indian tilt, hut the
Cards didn't duplicate the feat enough times. Francis accounted
for H74 yards, running and passing. Don Manoukian is the Stan
ford man moving in to help.

right down the field until Jim
Byrer lost the ball to OSC at
the 37.
Oregon State returned the favor
as it drove to the Stanford 24.
Then Francis got in trouble cir
cling end, was hit and fumbled
into the arms of McMiflin.
All for Naught
The Cards punted a few plays
later, then got the ball back as
Hick McMillen leaped high to in
t<n<-pt a Francis pass. Then the
Indians began the march that was
to end with the dropped pass.
In six plays, the Indians got to
ihe OSC 11. Douglas tossed to
Hen Robinson for 4, then McMil
len hit to the 3. He went to the
Ms-yard line for a first down on
the next play, but then came the
offside penalty that set the Cards
back.
So instead of firsthand-Ms, it was
third-and-7. Ami when McMillen
was dropped for a 3-yard loss,
Stanford was in trouble that it
couldn't get out of.
First of Four
OSC took over on the 10 and
promptly marched 90 yards for
the go-ahead score. Francis and
Nub Beamer carried most of the
lime, with the long-gainer a 20-
yard end sweep by Francis that
brought the ball to Stanford's 26.
The payoff was a 9-yard Fran
cis-to-De Grant pass that the OSC
end caught on the ground in the
end zone. Ted Searle's attempted
kick marked the start of a con
version-less day for the Beavers.
Stanford couldn't do anything
significant following the kickoff,
so OSC got the ball again. A 19-
yard Francis -to - Earnel Durden
pass put them on the 1 as time
was running out.
Beamer plowed into the middle
and didn't gain a thing as the
clock read 10 seconds to play. OSC
quickly came to the line, and the
snap was made with one second
remaining. Beamer went to his
left, fumbled, and the Cards re
covered.

But — a handkerchief on the
play. Virtually all observers
thought the Beavers were guilty
of not coming to a full second
stop before the snap. Most of the
reserves were already on their
way to the locker room.
So the Indians are ruled off
side, Oregon State gets an extra
play in the half, and Beamer
plunges over for the 12-0 half-time
lead.
Another Fumble
Oregon State took the third-pe
riod kickoff and used up 4:22
driving to a touchdown as Francis
swept end for the points. Stan
ford's only threat ended in a
Chuck Shea fumble on OSC's 37.
Stanford finally scored midway
through the final period. The key
play was a 38 - yard pass from
Douglas to Joel Freis, who made
an excellent lunging catch before
he fell.
Two runs and an incompleted
pass later, Douglas cleverly evad
ed three tacklers and threw to
McMillen. Rick had gotten behind
his man on what he said was an
unplanned play, and he pulled the
ball in for the touchdown.
Took No Chances
Oregon State took no chances
on a fast finish by Stanford, and
lengthened the count to 24-7 as
only 1:02 remained to play.
The Cards weren't through,
though, and Jim Sinnerud ran the
kickoff back to the 39. An inter
ference penalty moved Stanford
wit hit} 9 yards of the goal. With
13 seconds left, Bob Nicolet threw
to Irv Nicolai, who twisted into
the end zone.
The Last Gasp
In the seconds remaining, Stan
ford recovered an on-side kick and
tried for one more touchdown. But
it was in vain anyway, and the
gun sounded with the score 24-14.
So it's on to the Big Game for
Stanford. As usual in the Cal
battle, all the records will be
thrown out the window. And, hope
the Indians, so will all traces of
their performance against Oregon
State.


IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKK IT—Jackie Douglas' fourth-and nine
pass to Dick Stein almost made it into the end zone for a touch
down, but not quite. Actually, it did get into pay-dirt area, but
bounced off Stein's chest and onto the ground, incomplete. The
play occurred on the first play of ihe second period.

Ore., Nov. 16 Maybe the Big
Game will be different.
It better be, because if it's any
thing like the 24-14 pasting thai-
Stanford absorbed at the hands
of Oregon State today, Indians
and Indian fans will be in for an
awfully long Big Game.
The Cards were outplayed in
the line; their backs were oui
shown; their pass defense wa.s
riddled.
But, one-sided as the game was,
Stanford came within two offside
penalties and two dropped pas cs
of making quite a game of it.
Penalties Hurt
A first-quarter infraction cost
the Tribe a first down on the
Beaver Va-yard line and an almost
sure touchdown. Then, just as the
half was ending, the Cards recov
ered an OSC fumble on their own
3-yard line.
But Stanford was ruled off side
here, too; so the Beavers got an
extra play after time had run out,
and they scored.
The dropped passes came earl*
and late. The first came in ihe
initial play of the second period,
when the score was still 0-0. Stan
ford had driven from its 38 to li"
OSC 10-yard line, where it wa:
fourth down and 9 to go.
Incomplete
Jackie Douglas went back, spot
ted Dick Stein in the end zone and
threw. But Ihe ball bounced ol
Stein's chest, and that was it fo;
another Indian drive.
The other dropped TD pass di i
not mean much, since it came * i

ed three tacklers and threw to
McMillen. Rick had gotten behind
his man on what he said was an
unplanned play, and he pulled the
ball in for the touchdown.
Took No Chances
Oregon State took no chances
on a fast finish by Stanford, and
lengthened the count to 24-7 as
only 1:02 remained to play.
The Cards weren't through,
though, and Jim Sinnerud ran the
kickoff back to the 39. An inter
ference penalty moved Stanford
wit hit} 9 yards of the goal. With
13 seconds left, Bob Nicolet threw
to Irv Nicolai, who twisted into
the end zone.
The Last Gasp
In the seconds remaining, Stan
ford recovered an on-side kick and
tried for one more touchdown. But
it was in vain anyway, and the
gun sounded with the score 24-14.
So it's on to the Big Game for
Stanford. As usual in the Cal
battle, all the records will be
thrown out the window. And, hope
the Indians, so will all traces of
their performance against Oregon
State.


IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKK IT—Jackie Douglas' fourth-and nine
pass to Dick Stein almost made it into the end zone for a touch
down, but not quite. Actually, it did get into pay-dirt area, but
bounced off Stein's chest and onto the ground, incomplete. The
play occurred on the first play of ihe second period.

Ore., Nov. 16 Maybe the Big
Game will be different.
It better be, because if it's any
thing like the 24-14 pasting thai-
Stanford absorbed at the hands
of Oregon State today, Indians
and Indian fans will be in for an
awfully long Big Game.
The Cards were outplayed in
the line; their backs were oui
shown; their pass defense wa.s
riddled.
But, one-sided as the game was,
Stanford came within two offside
penalties and two dropped pas cs
of making quite a game of it.
Penalties Hurt
A first-quarter infraction cost
the Tribe a first down on the
Beaver Va-yard line and an almost
sure touchdown. Then, just as the
half was ending, the Cards recov
ered an OSC fumble on their own
3-yard line.
But Stanford was ruled off side
here, too; so the Beavers got an
extra play after time had run out,
and they scored.
The dropped passes came earl*
and late. The first came in ihe
initial play of the second period,
when the score was still 0-0. Stan
ford had driven from its 38 to li"
OSC 10-yard line, where it wa:
fourth down and 9 to go.
Incomplete
Jackie Douglas went back, spot
ted Dick Stein in the end zone and
threw. But Ihe ball bounced ol
Stein's chest, and that was it fo;
another Indian drive.
The other dropped TD pass di i
not mean much, since it came * i
the last play of the game and
couldn't have changed the l esul
It was a 32-yarder from Join
Bond to Jeri McMillin, whic h .1 i i

Statistically, there was no com
parison between the two club:.
OSC racked up 422 yards on 11k

just 288 for Stanford. In fit i
downs it was 24-14. Of course
these stats are about as expecb I
when it is seen that the winner
had 73 offensive plays to 54 Joi
the Cards.

The man responsible for nearh
two-thirds of the Oregon Slate

GOT HIM THIS TlME—Rick McMillen upended Oregon State's
Joe Francis this time in Saturday's Beaver-Indian tilt, hut the
Cards didn't duplicate the feat enough times. Francis accounted
for H74 yards, running and passing. Don Manoukian is the Stan
ford man moving in to help.

right down the field until Jim
Byrer lost the ball to OSC at
the 37.
Oregon State returned the favor
as it drove to the Stanford 24.
Then Francis got in trouble cir
cling end, was hit and fumbled
into the arms of McMiflin.
All for Naught
The Cards punted a few plays
later, then got the ball back as
Hick McMillen leaped high to in
t<n<-pt a Francis pass. Then the
Indians began the march that was
to end with the dropped pass.
In six plays, the Indians got to
ihe OSC 11. Douglas tossed to
Hen Robinson for 4, then McMil
len hit to the 3. He went to the
Ms-yard line for a first down on
the next play, but then came the
offside penalty that set the Cards
back.
So instead of firsthand-Ms, it was
third-and-7. Ami when McMillen
was dropped for a 3-yard loss,
Stanford was in trouble that it
couldn't get out of.
First of Four
OSC took over on the 10 and
promptly marched 90 yards for
the go-ahead score. Francis and
Nub Beamer carried most of the
lime, with the long-gainer a 20-
yard end sweep by Francis that
brought the ball to Stanford's 26.
The payoff was a 9-yard Fran
cis-to-De Grant pass that the OSC
end caught on the ground in the
end zone. Ted Searle's attempted
kick marked the start of a con
version-less day for the Beavers.
Stanford couldn't do anything
significant following the kickoff,
so OSC got the ball again. A 19-
yard Francis -to - Earnel Durden
pass put them on the 1 as time
was running out.
Beamer plowed into the middle
and didn't gain a thing as the
clock read 10 seconds to play. OSC
quickly came to the line, and the
snap was made with one second
remaining. Beamer went to his
left, fumbled, and the Cards re
covered.

But — a handkerchief on the
play. Virtually all observers
thought the Beavers were guilty
of not coming to a full second
stop before the snap. Most of the
reserves were already on their
way to the locker room.
So the Indians are ruled off
side, Oregon State gets an extra
play in the half, and Beamer
plunges over for the 12-0 half-time
lead.
Another Fumble
Oregon State took the third-pe
riod kickoff and used up 4:22
driving to a touchdown as Francis
swept end for the points. Stan
ford's only threat ended in a
Chuck Shea fumble on OSC's 37.
Stanford finally scored midway
through the final period. The key
play was a 38 - yard pass from
Douglas to Joel Freis, who made
an excellent lunging catch before
he fell.
Two runs and an incompleted
pass later, Douglas cleverly evad
ed three tacklers and threw to
McMillen. Rick had gotten behind
his man on what he said was an
unplanned play, and he pulled the
ball in for the touchdown.

Oregon State took no chances

right down the field until Jim
Byrer lost the ball to OSC at
the 37.
Oregon State returned the favor
as it drove to the Stanford 24.
Then Francis got in trouble cir
cling end, was hit and fumbled
into the arms of McMiflin.
All for Naught
The Cards punted a few plays
later, then got the ball back as
Hick McMillen leaped high to in
t<n<-pt a Francis pass. Then the
Indians began the march that was
to end with the dropped pass.
In six plays, the Indians got to
ihe OSC 11. Douglas tossed to
Hen Robinson for 4, then McMil
len hit to the 3. He went to the
Ms-yard line for a first down on
the next play, but then came the
offside penalty that set the Cards
back.
So instead of firsthand-Ms, it was
third-and-7. Ami when McMillen
was dropped for a 3-yard loss,
Stanford was in trouble that it
couldn't get out of.
First of Four
OSC took over on the 10 and
promptly marched 90 yards for
the go-ahead score. Francis and
Nub Beamer carried most of the
lime, with the long-gainer a 20-
yard end sweep by Francis that
brought the ball to Stanford's 26.
The payoff was a 9-yard Fran
cis-to-De Grant pass that the OSC
end caught on the ground in the
end zone. Ted Searle's attempted
kick marked the start of a con
version-less day for the Beavers.
Stanford couldn't do anything
significant following the kickoff,
so OSC got the ball again. A 19-
yard Francis -to - Earnel Durden
pass put them on the 1 as time
was running out.
Beamer plowed into the middle
and didn't gain a thing as the
clock read 10 seconds to play. OSC
quickly came to the line, and the
snap was made with one second
remaining. Beamer went to his
left, fumbled, and the Cards re
covered.

But — a handkerchief on the
play. Virtually all observers
thought the Beavers were guilty
of not coming to a full second
stop before the snap. Most of the
reserves were already on their
way to the locker room.
So the Indians are ruled off
side, Oregon State gets an extra
play in the half, and Beamer
plunges over for the 12-0 half-time
lead.
Another Fumble
Oregon State took the third-pe
riod kickoff and used up 4:22
driving to a touchdown as Francis
swept end for the points. Stan
ford's only threat ended in a
Chuck Shea fumble on OSC's 37.
Stanford finally scored midway
through the final period. The key
play was a 38 - yard pass from
Douglas to Joel Freis, who made
an excellent lunging catch before
he fell.
Two runs and an incompleted
pass later, Douglas cleverly evad
ed three tacklers and threw to
McMillen. Rick had gotten behind
his man on what he said was an
unplanned play, and he pulled the
ball in for the touchdown.
Took No Chances
Oregon State took no chances
on a fast finish by Stanford, and
lengthened the count to 24-7 as
only 1:02 remained to play.
The Cards weren't through,
though, and Jim Sinnerud ran the
kickoff back to the 39. An inter
ference penalty moved Stanford
wit hit} 9 yards of the goal. With
13 seconds left, Bob Nicolet threw
to Irv Nicolai, who twisted into
the end zone.
The Last Gasp
In the seconds remaining, Stan
ford recovered an on-side kick and
tried for one more touchdown. But
it was in vain anyway, and the
gun sounded with the score 24-14.
So it's on to the Big Game for
Stanford. As usual in the Cal
battle, all the records will be
thrown out the window. And, hope
the Indians, so will all traces of
their performance against Oregon
State.


IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKK IT—Jackie Douglas' fourth-and nine
pass to Dick Stein almost made it into the end zone for a touch
down, but not quite. Actually, it did get into pay-dirt area, but
bounced off Stein's chest and onto the ground, incomplete. The
play occurred on the first play of ihe second period.

PARKER STADIUM, Corvallr .
Ore., Nov. 16 Maybe the Big
Game will be different.
It better be, because if it's any
thing like the 24-14 pasting thai-
Stanford absorbed at the hands
of Oregon State today, Indians
and Indian fans will be in for an
awfully long Big Game.
The Cards were outplayed in
the line; their backs were oui
shown; their pass defense wa.s
riddled.
But, one-sided as the game was,
Stanford came within two offside
penalties and two dropped pas cs
of making quite a game of it.
Penalties Hurt
A first-quarter infraction cost
the Tribe a first down on the
Beaver Va-yard line and an almost
sure touchdown. Then, just as the
half was ending, the Cards recov
ered an OSC fumble on their own
3-yard line.
But Stanford was ruled off side
here, too; so the Beavers got an
extra play after time had run out,
and they scored.
The dropped passes came earl*
and late. The first came in ihe
initial play of the second period,
when the score was still 0-0. Stan
ford had driven from its 38 to li"
OSC 10-yard line, where it wa:
fourth down and 9 to go.
Incomplete
Jackie Douglas went back, spot
ted Dick Stein in the end zone and
threw. But Ihe ball bounced ol
Stein's chest, and that was it fo;
another Indian drive.
The other dropped TD pass di i
not mean much, since it came * i
the last play of the game and
couldn't have changed the l esul
It was a 32-yarder from Join
Bond to Jeri McMillin, whic h .1 i i
had in the clear on the 14 but lo:
Statistically, there was no com
parison between the two club:.
OSC racked up 422 yards on 11k
ground and through Ihe air, to
just 288 for Stanford. In fit i
downs it was 24-14. Of course
these stats are about as expecb I
when it is seen that the winner
had 73 offensive plays to 54 Joi
the Cards.
Not Really Sic k
The man responsible for nearh
two-thirds of the Oregon Slate
yardage was tailback Joe Franc 1
supposedly a sick man. Even aliei
the game, OSC mentor Tom nr.
j Prothro was insisting thai Fran
cis was in bad shape, but you
t couldn't prove it by anyone who
saw the game.
All the senior from Hawaii did
was run for 138 yards and com
plete 9 of 10 passes for 136 yards
He scored two of the touchdowns
himself and passed to Bob D<
Grant for a third.
Francis was especially profi
! cient at hurdling Stanford tar ! <
lers who were crouched low to hit
him. But the biggest factor in his
I success was the clearing-away job
j his line did for him.
Seldom in Trouble
Francis was rarely in trouble
! passing and usually could have all
ihe time he needed to spot his rc
ceivers. He nearly always had
plenty of time to turn the cornei
on end sweeps, too. as the St a
I ford defenders couldn't break
i through the Beaver interferene"
The game began on a bright
: note for Stanford as it won thr
j coin toss for the seventh time in
' nine games. The Cards moved


INTO STARTING LINEUP—Jim Byrer, moved
up to the first, string* in place of injured A 1 Har
rington, gained 41 yards on eight carries for a

5.1 average a.«- the Cards fell to OSC, 21-14.
