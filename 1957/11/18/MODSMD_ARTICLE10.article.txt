# Beavers Better Stanford, 24-14, As Card Forward Wall Falters
## Francis Tears Through Tribe For 274 Yards 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
PARKER STADIUM, Corvallr .
Ore., Nov. 16 Maybe the Big
Game will be different.
It better be, because if it's any
thing like the 24-14 pasting thai-
Stanford absorbed at the hands
of Oregon State today, Indians
and Indian fans will be in for an
awfully long Big Game.
The Cards were outplayed in
the line; their backs were oui
shown; their pass defense wa.s
riddled.
But, one-sided as the game was,
Stanford came within two offside
penalties and two dropped pas cs
of making quite a game of it.
Penalties Hurt
A first-quarter infraction cost
the Tribe a first down on the
Beaver Va-yard line and an almost
sure touchdown. Then, just as the
half was ending, the Cards recov
ered an OSC fumble on their own
3-yard line.
But Stanford was ruled off side
here, too; so the Beavers got an
extra play after time had run out,
and they scored.
The dropped passes came earl*
and late. The first came in ihe
initial play of the second period,
when the score was still 0-0. Stan
ford had driven from its 38 to li"
OSC 10-yard line, where it wa:
fourth down and 9 to go.
Incomplete
Jackie Douglas went back, spot
ted Dick Stein in the end zone and
threw. But Ihe ball bounced ol
Stein's chest, and that was it fo;
another Indian drive.
The other dropped TD pass di i
not mean much, since it came * i
the last play of the game and
couldn't have changed the l esul
It was a 32-yarder from Join
Bond to Jeri McMillin, whic h .1 i i
had in the clear on the 14 but lo:
Statistically, there was no com
parison between the two club:.
OSC racked up 422 yards on 11k
ground and through Ihe air, to
just 288 for Stanford. In fit i
downs it was 24-14. Of course
these stats are about as expecb I
when it is seen that the winner
had 73 offensive plays to 54 Joi
the Cards.
Not Really Sic k
The man responsible for nearh
two-thirds of the Oregon Slate
yardage was tailback Joe Franc 1
supposedly a sick man. Even aliei
the game, OSC mentor Tom nr.
j Prothro was insisting thai Fran
cis was in bad shape, but you
t couldn't prove it by anyone who
saw the game.
All the senior from Hawaii did
was run for 138 yards and com
plete 9 of 10 passes for 136 yards
He scored two of the touchdowns
himself and passed to Bob D<
Grant for a third.
Francis was especially profi
! cient at hurdling Stanford tar ! <
lers who were crouched low to hit
him. But the biggest factor in his
I success was the clearing-away job
j his line did for him.
Seldom in Trouble
Francis was rarely in trouble
! passing and usually could have all
ihe time he needed to spot his rc
ceivers. He nearly always had
plenty of time to turn the cornei
on end sweeps, too. as the St a
I ford defenders couldn't break
i through the Beaver interferene"
The game began on a bright
: note for Stanford as it won thr
j coin toss for the seventh time in
' nine games. The Cards moved


INTO STARTING LINEUP—Jim Byrer, moved
up to the first, string* in place of injured A 1 Har
rington, gained 41 yards on eight carries for a

5.1 average a.«- the Cards fell to OSC, 21-14.

GOT HIM THIS TlME—Rick McMillen upended Oregon State's
Joe Francis this time in Saturday's Beaver-Indian tilt, hut the
Cards didn't duplicate the feat enough times. Francis accounted
for H74 yards, running and passing. Don Manoukian is the Stan
ford man moving in to help.
