# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Dave Quarles
## 'Trivial' Events Precede Big Game 
### 
Having recovered from the USC weekend, stu
dent bodies around campus are clutching excit
odly in their hot little fists an assortment of
tickets including the Gaieties and that "major
athletic event,"the Big Game. We just want to
say simmer down! there's a whole fascinating
week of trivia in store for- you before the game.
<>
Just a quick reminder to the goodly number
of disillusioned students who (fools) elected to
study their predecessors. At various times today
there will be Western Civ question and answer
periods on lessons 10-19, covering your new
friends, Messrs. Socrates, Plato, Cicero, ct al.,
including Brutus (et tu>.
The School of Mineral Sciences Journal Club
is being coy again. Visitors are welcome to come
at 4 p.m. today to Room 320, Geology Corner,
1o hear R. M. Fosse "be the speaker." We can
hardly give Mr. Fosse our full endorsement with
out knowing what he is going to "he the speak
er" about. However, if you're dry, we do know
coffee's being dispensed before the program.
At 4:15 p.m. today the Department of Biologi
cal Sciences Seminar is presenting O. E. Lowen
stein, professor of zoology, UCLA, in a program
entitled "Proprioception in Insects" sounds
questionable to us. Come to Room 430, Jordan
Hall, 15 minutes early when they try to smooth
it over with tea.

The Tuesday Evening Series is presenting the
Cambridge debate team vs. the Stanford debate
learn, "Has the United States Yet if) Prove Her
Capacity for World Leadership?" Program's set
for 7:30 p.m. in Mem Aud.
From the sublime to the ridiculous 9:15 same
night, same place as the debate, you will find the
B-G Gaieties being unleashed on ihe public for
the first time. Our recommendation: "Be Pre
pared."
For those of you who enjoy watching mass
confusion and have time to kill, the freshmen,
bless their eager little hearts, will bo collecting
wood on Tuesday from 1 to 6 p.m. for their an
nual conflagration.

"Heuristic Approach to Prime Number Theory"
will be run through the adding machine by
George Polya Wednesday at 1:15 p.m. in Room
20, Chemistry Building. Sounds like anything
but the Scientific Approach. However, if it in
volves physics, we'd rather not approach it at
all.
John McElhenny will spread the good word
Wednesday at 4:15 p.m. in the Little Theater.
His topic is "The Old Testament Revisited."
Those to whom we addressed our opening re
marks had better visit Mr. McElhenny, as his
material is reported (from reliable sources) lo

The Distaff Club has planned a bash and a
half for its Big Game Rally this time. At 8 p.m.
Wednesday in the home of Professor and Mrs.
Konrad B. Krauskopf the "football coach wives
in panel discussion and Men's Glee Club" will
throw in contrapuntally to make a musically con
fused, if not eventful evening.
B-G Gaieties at 8:15 p.m. in Mem Aud Wednes
day.
J. L. McGregor, instructor in mathematics, will
discuss Thursday "A Theorem in Diffusion The
ory" at 1:30 p.m. in Room 104, Sequoia Hall. The
practical application of McGregor's theory will
certainly be tested this weekend with the dif
fusion of "good cheer" around about. We hope
the letters ABC aren't factors in his calculation.
B-G weekend is really providing a proving
ground for all the science departments. Go hear
David A. Hamburg discuss "Psychological Stress
and Adrenal Cortical Function" in the Medical
Microbiology Conference Room at 4 p.m. Thurs
day. Then make your own test this weekend and
see if your adrenal cortical function isn't way
above par because of all sorts- of psychological
stresses. Caution: adrenal corticals are irreplace
able.
Denys L. Page, professor of classical literature
at Cal. will make a reconnaissance raid in the
lower lounge of the Women's Clubhouse Thurs
day at 4 p.m. His ostensible purpose is orating
on "The Antigone of Sophocles." All security
measures are being taken because there's a nasty
rumor circulating that Sophocles never had an
aunt in the first place. (Yuk!)
Don't miss the Frosh Fire at 8 p.m. etb (esti

by Music I profs to all their students.
Not required, but equally stimulating, will be
Ingrid Bergman when she tolls the bells for
Stanford's B-G victory. Hop. skip and jump in
