# Chorus Grows In Numbers, Achievement
## New Music Building Provides Ideal Site; No More Mice, Bees 
### Camille Petersen 
During its 12 years (if existence, :
i he University Chorus has grown
i from 65 to 1 Hf3 voices. It has prac
ticed with n«v-e and bees for an
I audience. II has tried and accom
plished many things.
The Chorus was started in 1945
and held its first rehearsals in the
bast ment of The Knoll. Here, with
bare foundation walls, rattling |
pipes and the pattering of mice's
feet, they rehearsed for five years. 1
A slight improvement in condi
tions came in 1.950 when the Cho
rus moved its headquarters to
Woodpecker Lodge. The acoustics
| still left much to be desired, but
at least they only had swarms of
bees and squirrels in the rafters
to compete with.
Woodpecker might have been
picturesque but was not very
functional. Both Chorus and Or
! chestra rehearsed there, and the
sealing arrangement for each
j group had to be put up and torn
down al each meeting. Their li
; braries were far away, and the
concerts could not be rehearsed
regularly in the auditorium in
which they would be presented.
Moved to Dinkelspiel
Last spring all this was reme
died when the groups moved to
the new Dinkelspiel Memorial Au
ditorium. Woodpecker was torn
down to make room for the new
Petroleum wing addition to the
Geophysics Building.
The University Chorus has had
a major production with the San
Francisco Symphony every year
except one. Under the baton of
i Pierre Montcux, it recorded
Brahms' "Song of Fate" with the
Symphony for RCA-Victor.
The first week in April. 1958,
the Chorus will present Berlioz's
"Requiem" with the Symphony,
i under the direction of Enrique
j Jorda.
Since it is the largest vocal
| group on campus, the Chorus is
1 concerned mos 11 y with large
works such as Mozart's "C Minor
; Mass." The group prepares many
contemporary works. It is prima
: rily for the general student—grad
uate and undergraduate- who is
interested in vocal music.
Under Noted Directors
Members have the opportunity
to sing under the direction of such
j noted musicians as Bruno Walter,
Thor Johnson, William Steinberg
j and Monteux.
The Chorus has participated in
such operas as "Peter Grimes,"
i "Love for Three Orange s,"
"Rake's Progr e s s" and last
spring's "Ballad of Baby Doe."
The latter was ihe dedication pres
entation at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
Rehearsals are held twice week
ly in Dinkelspiel Rehearsal Hall.
Here the music library is close at
i hand; the hall is centrally located
on campus, and the seating ar
j rangement is ideal for seeing the
I conductor. In the words of con
ductor Harold Schmidt, "the build
ing is a great addition to the mu
sical life at Stanford."
Schmidt has directed the Cho
| rus during 10 of its 12 years. Last
. spring he became a full professor
in the department.
The Chorus is made up of stu
dents from all University depart
ments. This year's group is the
largest since thai of 1953, which
boasted 195 voices.
Jess Parker is chorus accom
panist, Robert MacKinnon assist
ant director, and Joe Rynear man
ager. The Chorus also has a staff
! of student librarians.

The Chorus was started in 1945
and held its first rehearsals in the
bast ment of The Knoll. Here, with
bare foundation walls, rattling |
pipes and the pattering of mice's
feet, they rehearsed for five years. 1
A slight improvement in condi
tions came in 1.950 when the Cho
rus moved its headquarters to
Woodpecker Lodge. The acoustics
| still left much to be desired, but
at least they only had swarms of
bees and squirrels in the rafters
to compete with.
Woodpecker might have been
picturesque but was not very
functional. Both Chorus and Or
! chestra rehearsed there, and the
sealing arrangement for each
j group had to be put up and torn
down al each meeting. Their li
; braries were far away, and the
concerts could not be rehearsed
regularly in the auditorium in
which they would be presented.
Moved to Dinkelspiel
Last spring all this was reme
died when the groups moved to
the new Dinkelspiel Memorial Au
ditorium. Woodpecker was torn
down to make room for the new
Petroleum wing addition to the
Geophysics Building.
The University Chorus has had
a major production with the San
Francisco Symphony every year
except one. Under the baton of
i Pierre Montcux, it recorded
Brahms' "Song of Fate" with the
Symphony for RCA-Victor.
The first week in April. 1958,
the Chorus will present Berlioz's
"Requiem" with the Symphony,
i under the direction of Enrique
j Jorda.
Since it is the largest vocal
| group on campus, the Chorus is
1 concerned mos 11 y with large
works such as Mozart's "C Minor
; Mass." The group prepares many
contemporary works. It is prima
: rily for the general student—grad
uate and undergraduate- who is
interested in vocal music.
Under Noted Directors
Members have the opportunity
to sing under the direction of such
j noted musicians as Bruno Walter,
Thor Johnson, William Steinberg
j and Monteux.
The Chorus has participated in
such operas as "Peter Grimes,"
i "Love for Three Orange s,"
"Rake's Progr e s s" and last
spring's "Ballad of Baby Doe."
The latter was ihe dedication pres
entation at Dinkelspiel Audito
rium.
Rehearsals are held twice week
ly in Dinkelspiel Rehearsal Hall.
Here the music library is close at
i hand; the hall is centrally located
on campus, and the seating ar
j rangement is ideal for seeing the
I conductor. In the words of con
ductor Harold Schmidt, "the build
ing is a great addition to the mu
sical life at Stanford."
Schmidt has directed the Cho
| rus during 10 of its 12 years. Last
. spring he became a full professor
in the department.
The Chorus is made up of stu
dents from all University depart
ments. This year's group is the
largest since thai of 1953, which
boasted 195 voices.
Jess Parker is chorus accom
panist, Robert MacKinnon assist
