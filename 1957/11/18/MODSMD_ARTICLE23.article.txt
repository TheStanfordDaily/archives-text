## 
### 
3:4s—lndians lose to Oregon State, 24-14.
7:4s—Head Coach Chuck Taylor is busy mapping out defenses
.'igainst California.
So, with the Oregon State game water over the heaver dam, Stan
ford quickly began to prepare for Saturday's Big Game.

Dutch Fehring, who has scout
ed Cal, said, "If they put two
good halves together, they'll be
rough. They've had the bad
breaks—fumbles, penalties at in
opportune times."
Cal Line
This, plus words of warning
about the Cal line from ex-Cal as
sistant Herm Meister, were what
Taylor heard on the plane home
as he busily set about the task of
mapping plans to stop the Bears'
split-T attack.
Taylor did look back to the loss
1o OSC, and frankly commented,
"We just didn't play our football.
We were flat." He added that it
was the first lime all year the
Indians have really been down |
for a game.
Reminded of the 34-7 loss to 1
Rice. Taylor said that in Houston
it was just a case of being beaten
by a superior team, i A team good '
enough to beat number • one
ranked Texas A&M last Satur- j
day.) He said Rice is much bet
tor than O.SC.
Penalties Hurt
Taylor agreed that the two off- .
side penalties hurt Stanford, and i
that 6-0 at half-time would have I
been much better than 12-0, but
he didn't think that different dei
cisions at these points would
have changed the outcome.
When asked if OSC's line real- j
ly outcharged the Stanford wall, j
his reply was a to-the-point, "Oh. j
yeah."
Armand DeWee.se was im- i
pressed by the Beaver backs. !
"Our guys would jump over to
plug a hole, then they'd shift real j
well and spot a new hole."
Ol' Sick Joe
Tn the Beaver dressing room :
after the game, Coach Tommy i
Prothro was still moaning about :
how sick poor ol' Joe Francis :
was. (He only accounted for 271
yards.)
Prothro wouldn't compare
Stanford and California. He '
noted that "It's hard to say; j
they're different types of teams, j
And, we played Cal there and !
Stanford here. I don't know
about others, hut that makes a
difference to us." Prothro has
never lost at home since coming
to Oregon State.
Prothro summed the effort up ;
as "one of our best perform- i
ances."
