# Cal Blanks SU in Little Big Game, 20-0; Bearcubs Undefeated, Papooses Winless
## 
### 
The California frosh displayed
a powerful ground attack to whip
Stanford's Papoose squad, 20-0, at
Berkeley Saturday morning.
The Cub victory gave the Cubs
an undefeated season, their first
since 1936. The Stanford year
lings finished in the frosh cir
cuit basement with a 0-3 record.
The game opened with Cal be
ing assessed a 15 ■ yard penalty
for failing to arrive at the field
on time. Stanford took the ball
on the 50 and drove for two first
downs, only to have Cub fullback
Walt Arnold intercept Dennis
Houx's pass.
Early Score
In eight plays Cal was on the
Papoose 29, and Cub quarterback
Jim Ferguson passed to swift
halfback John Blavlock for the
first touchdown. Ferguson con
verted to give Cal a 7-0 lead.
Statistically, Stanford dominat
ed the first half, grinding out 141
yards to Cal's 81, but still could
n't push over a score.
In the second period the Pa
pooses lost the ball regularly on
fumbles and interceptions, but
were still able to hold the Cubs
scoreless.
Reese Leads
Cub halfback and leading
ground • gainer Ernie Reese led
the Cal club to Iheir second Tl)
in the third quarter. Ferguson
did the scoring on a one - yard
plunge, but his attempted P.A.T.
was no good.
With the Cubs enjoying a 13-0
advantage, the Stanford year
lings suddenly caught fire as
quarterback Rod Sears tossed a
40-yard pass to end Tim Alexan
der. Alexander went another IS
yards before Cub d e fend e r s
forced him down on the Cal 11.
But Cal took over on downs as
the Papoose offense bogged down
again.

Cal's final touchdown in the
last period was a gift from the
Card frosh after forcing Cal to
punt. Houx fumbled on Stan
ford's first play at their own 21
and Cub guard Doug Furuta re
covered. The Indian yearlings
stiffened their defense and it
took Cal eight plays to grind out
the 21 yards to the score. Cub
halfback Jerry White finally
crashed over left tackle from the
one and Mitch Reinis booted the
conversion for the final 20-0!
count.
The Cubs made most" of their!
yardage on the ground while the;
Papooses had most of their sue-j
cess in the air. The fact that
Stanford made 14 first downs to
Cal's 19 and ground out 258 yards
to the Cubs' 328 reveals that thci
tilt was somewhat closer than
the score indicates.

After the 1 same Stanford Frosh
Coach Bob Ghilotti said, "All our
mistakes, intercepted pa s ses,
fumbles and slips came at crucial
times—when in a scoring position
or when deep in our own terri
tory. Although the score read
20-6, we hung on and fought all
1 the way. Cal couldn't afford to
1 let up at any point."
Much Progress
Ghilotti feels that the team has
definitely progressed and devel
open through the season. He re
marked that by losing all their
! games, the players learned as
much or more than by winning
I because they really strove to cor
: rect their mistakes.
He cited John Butler, Bill Coo
per, Gil Dowd, Bob Heigold,
I George Honore Chris Knott and
Phil Toorvald as fine varsity po
j tential for next year.

The California frosh displayed
a powerful ground attack to whip
Stanford's Papoose squad, 20-0, at
Berkeley Saturday morning.
The Cub victory gave the Cubs
an undefeated season, their first
since 1936. The Stanford year
lings finished in the frosh cir
cuit basement with a 0-3 record.
The game opened with Cal be
ing assessed a 15 ■ yard penalty
for failing to arrive at the field
on time. Stanford took the ball
on the 50 and drove for two first
downs, only to have Cub fullback
Walt Arnold intercept Dennis
Houx's pass.
Early Score
In eight plays Cal was on the
Papoose 29, and Cub quarterback
Jim Ferguson passed to swift
halfback John Blavlock for the
first touchdown. Ferguson con
verted to give Cal a 7-0 lead.
Statistically, Stanford dominat
ed the first half, grinding out 141
yards to Cal's 81, but still could
n't push over a score.
In the second period the Pa
pooses lost the ball regularly on
fumbles and interceptions, but
were still able to hold the Cubs
scoreless.
Reese Leads
Cub halfback and leading
ground • gainer Ernie Reese led
the Cal club to Iheir second Tl)
in the third quarter. Ferguson
did the scoring on a one - yard
plunge, but his attempted P.A.T.
was no good.
With the Cubs enjoying a 13-0
advantage, the Stanford year
lings suddenly caught fire as
quarterback Rod Sears tossed a
40-yard pass to end Tim Alexan
der. Alexander went another IS
yards before Cub d e fend e r s
forced him down on the Cal 11.
But Cal took over on downs as
the Papoose offense bogged down
again.

Cal's final touchdown in the
last period was a gift from the
Card frosh after forcing Cal to
punt. Houx fumbled on Stan
ford's first play at their own 21
and Cub guard Doug Furuta re
covered. The Indian yearlings
stiffened their defense and it
took Cal eight plays to grind out
the 21 yards to the score. Cub
halfback Jerry White finally
crashed over left tackle from the
one and Mitch Reinis booted the
conversion for the final 20-0!
count.
The Cubs made most" of their!
yardage on the ground while the;
Papooses had most of their sue-j

Stanford made 14 first downs to
Cal's 19 and ground out 258 yards
to the Cubs' 328 reveals that thci
tilt was somewhat closer than
the score indicates.
