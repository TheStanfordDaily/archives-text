# SU Soccer Squad Ties Spartans, 1-1, To Finish Season
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer eleven closed
out its conference season with a
1-1 tie against San Jose State last
Saturday to post a 3-2-1 record
for the season and finish in fifth
place in the Northern Intercolle
giate Soccer Conference.
Strangely it was defensive er
rors that led to both goals. In
the second period all three Stan
ford defenders rushed to cover a
high-bouncing pass. When they
all hesitated waiting for the other
to make the kick the ball bounced
between them and SJS center
forward Werner Groshens quick
ly shot past Stanford goalie Bill
Dittman.
Stanford equalized in the third
period when a pushing foul gave
the Cards a free kick at the right
sideline. Vic Van Huyse sent a
hard, low drive toward the goal
which skidded off the foot of an
SJS defender into the goal.
