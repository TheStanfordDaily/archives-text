# 'DEAR ABBY'
## Lovelorn Column Attracts All Ages 
### Steve Deck 
I Jena' Abby: IVly boy friend
look me out: on my 21st birth
day and wanted to show me a
very special time. I usually
don't go in much tor drinking,
but I bud throe martinis. Dur
ing dinner we split a I Kittle of
wine. Alter dinner we had two
brandies. Did I do wrong? —
Blondie.
Dear Blondie: Probably.
Abigail Van Buren, better
known as Abby, has become one
of the two "musts" for students
reading morning newspapers (the
other is "Peanuts") by making
herself known for her sharp, hu
morous answers to letters such as
the one above.

Success of the Abby column
with readers of all ages may be
credited largely to careful selec
tion of the letters that are printed
daily from nearly 3000 received
each week, and to Abby's answers,
which are planned for brevity and
impact- for instance:
Dear Abby: I am very hurt.
I have been married for three
years, and my husband always
kisses me good-bye before going
to work. He used to kiss me on
the lips. Now he kisses me on
the forehead. How do I get him
to kiss me on the lips?— Joyce.
Dear Joyce: Wear high heels.
Abby, though questioned often
by her readers as to what right
she, as MISS Van Buren, has to
advise on marital problems, is, in
reality, an attractive wife, mother
of two children and resident of
San Mateo.
Pauline Esther (Popo) Phillips
—her real name—is not the only
member of her family to qualify
as Miss Lonely Hearts, for her
sister is turning out to be her big
gest competitor in the newspaper
syndicates.
Sister Advises
Ann Landers—actually Esther
Pauline (Eppie) Lederer—whose
home base is Chicago, is no less
popular throughout the country,
though her answers are usually
longer and more analytical.
Abby and Ann have revolution
ized the lovelorn industry. Before
they entered the field, lonely
hearts columns were generally
soupy and sentimental. Ann and
Abby have declared war on the
"shoulder-to-cry-on stuff."
Both columnists base their an
swers on such axioms as: If
things are too bad, try separation
but never divorce. Never go
through with a marriage if you're
in any doubt whether you should.
Parents always know best and
should be told what goes on. Don't
think you have to tell your hus
band (or wife) everything.
Sheer Jokes
Though most of the letters she
receives are sincere, occasionally
Abby gets ones that are sheer
jokes—usually from college stu
dents—for instance: "Dear Abby:
I am in love with the boy next
door. The only trouble is that he
has 45 brothers and I have 37 sis
ters. How can I get him to notice
me as an individual instead <>t .just
one of the girls next, door?"
The letter 1 was, of course, from
a sorority house next door to a
fraternity.
While Abby began writing on
an impulse- she thought tlie then
current agony corner conducted
by Molly Mayfield was ridiculous
—she has no intention of giving
it up. She and three secretaries
devote a part of each day to the
column, and Abby herself consults
religious leaders and several psy
chiatrists before answering any
but the stock questions.
