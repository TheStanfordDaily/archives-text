# Ballet Dancers Give 'Dazzling' Performance
## 
### Natasha Mazour 
Dazzling techniques and fast
paccd numbers were combined
Saturday night when a capacity
crowd turned out to see the bal
let team of Kovac and Rabovsky
with Sonia Arova and William
Roil Icy.
Reilley was tilling in for the in
jured Job Sanders.
The first number 1 , Suite by Ed
v-utl Grieg, had a choreography
which limited Miss Arova and
Reilley with its careful and bal
anced patterns, first on one side
of I lie stage, then on the other.
The best number on the pro
gram was Melody fr om "Orfco ed
Euridice" by Christoph Gluck.
Miss Kovach has tremendous
depth and a very fine lyrical
style.
Choreography was excellent
and contained very difficult lifts
which did not detract from the
delicacy of the feeling, but rather
gave the selection many varia
tions and contrasts with lifts and
low sweeping movements.
The unpredictable antics of the
stage crew seemed to vie with
the stars for attention. The cur
tain not rising more than half
way for almost half of the first
selection was accidental, but the
noises originating from back
stage were preventable.
On the whole the performance
was very good, especially consid
ering the fact that Reilley had
very short notice that he was to
appear. The four dancers with
their particular talents offered a
varied yet well â€¢ integrated per
formance.
