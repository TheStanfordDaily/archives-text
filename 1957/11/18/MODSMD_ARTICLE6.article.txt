# PREMIERE GIVEN
## Orchestra, Chorus Join For Concert 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
The Stanford Symphony Or
chestra and University Chorus
displayed nearly a quarter's
worth of work to the best pos
sible advantage Friday and Sun
day when they presented their
first concert of the year at Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
A memorial to Larry Cook,
who was first trumpet with the
orchestra until his recent death,
was the opening number. Gabrie
li's Conzone in the Ninth Mode
was played by three brass choirs
in an unusual arrangement: one
at each side of the auditorium
and one in the open upstairs of
the auditorium. The competing
forces of the three choirs could
not have been balanced and per
formed in any place that was not
nearly acoustically perfect.
Second Piece
The second piece was the pre
miere performance of the Harle
quin Overture by Stanford's Pro
fessor Leonard Ratner . Dr. Rat
ner displayed an excellent under
standing of contemporary music
in his work. Aside from a slight
bit of intonation trouble and
keeping up with the furious pace
set by Director Sandor Salgo, the
orchestra played well.
The third offering featured
Putnam Aldrich at the harpsi
chord in Poulenc's "Concert
Champetre." The piece was tech
nically difficult, and Aldrich
played it easily.
Finishing the first half of the
performance, the orchestra per
formed three excerpts from Die
Meistersinger, by Wagner. The
group displayed an excellent
grasp of the technique usually
found in professional orchestras.
Stirring: Performance
The second half of the program
was devoted to Randall Thomp
son's orchestration of Michael
Drayton's poem "Ode to the Vir
ginian Voyage," describing the
feelings of the first settlers cÂ»s
they crossed the Atlantic.
The chorus and orchestra com
bined to give a stirring perform
ance which would fill the heart
of any member of the First Fam
ilies of Virginia with pride. Their
rendition was expressive, well
balanced, brilliant and soft in the
appropriate places, and powerful.
An extra bit of applause should
go to director Salgo for his dy
namic leadership. The great
amount of continuity displayed
by the two groups belies their
few rehearsals together.
