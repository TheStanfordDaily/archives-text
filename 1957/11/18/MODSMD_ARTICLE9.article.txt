## 
### Roger Folsom 
The first session of Stanford in
Germany will bo held in June and
i the deadline for applications,
j which are available at the infor
| mation office, is Dec. 15.
Stanford in Germany is a
branch of Stanford, a study cen
; ter located near the German city
of Stuttgart (population, 600,-
'000). It offers 60 Stanford stu
dents (sophomores, juniors and
i seniors) the opportunity to trav-
I el, live and study abroad for six
months.
Each session will last for two
quarters. The branch will be
i near a German technical univer
sity, an opera, two theaters, mu
i scums and concert halls; and stu
! dents will be encouraged to take
; advantage of these.
European leaders of university
and public life will visit the cen
ter regularly. Opportunity for
travel, privately or in groups, to
the rest of Europe will be pro
vided. Every effort will be made
to bring German and Stanford
students together. Students and
faculty will eat their meals, typi
cally European, together.
Regular Stanford credit will be
j offered for all courses taken at
| the study center. Expenses for
two quarters at Stanford in Ger
many will be the same as two
(quarters here, including tuition,
I room and board and the trip to
j Germany, which will be by char-
I tered plane.

Students will be responsible lor
their personal expenses, and also
for ihe cost of their return trip
to the United States.
Stanford men and women in
Germany will be expected to ad
here to the Fundamental Stand
ard and the Honor Code. While
students are living on the study
center campus in Germany, and
not traveling, there will be appro
priate regulations covering stu
dent activities of an academic or
social nature, developed by usual
student government procedures.
Excursions organized by the staff
will bo supervised in much the
same way as a field trip at Stan
ford.
On private trips, during week
ends and holidays or between
quarters, the same social regula
tions and code as in the United
States will apply. Students, while
away from the study center, will
not be chaperoned but will be ex
peeled to exercise good .judgment.
The University's position is
that a considerable degree of lib
erty should be granted every stu
dent. However, students should
realize that while in Germany
they voluntarily assume a defi
nite responsibility for represent
ing I heir country abroad. Before
students leave for Germany, par
ents will be asked to sign a state
ment indicating consent.
Private automobiles will not bo
necessary, as travel by public
carriers is easily arranged in Eu

rope. Students may not bring
cars from the United States, and
they must get approval of the fac
ulty director of the study center
to rent or purchase automobiles
in Europe.
The director will require evi
i dence of complete insurance cov
erage. and a statement of paren
tal approval and acceptance of
responsibility. Permission may
be revoked at any time by the di
rector for unsatisfactory conduct.
The Committee on General
! Studies will select students for
the program on the basis of past
academic performance, personal
qualifications, balance, reliability,
tolerance and the general ability
to live amicably with others. The
group will be diversified yet eon
-1 genial, expected to contribute
I something of value and to gain
something of value from the ex
i periencc.
All Stanford undergraduates
who will have sophomore, junior
j or senior standing by June 15,
1958, may apply for either the
fii'st or second six-month session

Germany will bo held in June and
i the deadline for applications,
j which are available at the infor

Stanford in Germany is a
branch of Stanford, a study cen
; ter located near the German city
of Stuttgart (population, 600,-
'000). It offers 60 Stanford stu
dents (sophomores, juniors and
i seniors) the opportunity to trav-
I el, live and study abroad for six
months.
Each session will last for two
quarters. The branch will be
i near a German technical univer
sity, an opera, two theaters, mu
i scums and concert halls; and stu
! dents will be encouraged to take
; advantage of these.
European leaders of university
and public life will visit the cen
ter regularly. Opportunity for
travel, privately or in groups, to
the rest of Europe will be pro
vided. Every effort will be made
to bring German and Stanford
students together. Students and
faculty will eat their meals, typi
cally European, together.
Regular Stanford credit will be
j offered for all courses taken at
| the study center. Expenses for
two quarters at Stanford in Ger
many will be the same as two
(quarters here, including tuition,
I room and board and the trip to
j Germany, which will be by char-
I tered plane.

Students will be responsible lor
their personal expenses, and also
for ihe cost of their return trip
to the United States.
Stanford men and women in
Germany will be expected to ad
here to the Fundamental Stand
ard and the Honor Code. While
students are living on the study
center campus in Germany, and
not traveling, there will be appro
priate regulations covering stu
dent activities of an academic or
social nature, developed by usual
student government procedures.
Excursions organized by the staff
will bo supervised in much the
same way as a field trip at Stan
ford.
On private trips, during week
ends and holidays or between
quarters, the same social regula
tions and code as in the United
States will apply. Students, while
away from the study center, will
not be chaperoned but will be ex
peeled to exercise good .judgment.
The University's position is
that a considerable degree of lib
erty should be granted every stu
dent. However, students should
realize that while in Germany
they voluntarily assume a defi
nite responsibility for represent
ing I heir country abroad. Before
students leave for Germany, par
ents will be asked to sign a state
ment indicating consent.
Private automobiles will not bo
necessary, as travel by public
carriers is easily arranged in Eu

rope. Students may not bring
cars from the United States, and
they must get approval of the fac
ulty director of the study center
to rent or purchase automobiles
in Europe.
The director will require evi
i dence of complete insurance cov
erage. and a statement of paren
tal approval and acceptance of
responsibility. Permission may
be revoked at any time by the di
rector for unsatisfactory conduct.
The Committee on General
! Studies will select students for
the program on the basis of past
academic performance, personal
qualifications, balance, reliability,
tolerance and the general ability
to live amicably with others. The
group will be diversified yet eon
-1 genial, expected to contribute
I something of value and to gain
something of value from the ex
i periencc.
All Stanford undergraduates
who will have sophomore, junior
j or senior standing by June 15,
1958, may apply for either the
fii'st or second six-month session
of Stanford in Germany. Appli

i the deadline for applications,
j which are available at the infor
| mation office, is Dec. 15.
Stanford in Germany is a
branch of Stanford, a study cen
; ter located near the German city
of Stuttgart (population, 600,-
'000). It offers 60 Stanford stu
dents (sophomores, juniors and
i seniors) the opportunity to trav-
I el, live and study abroad for six
months.
Each session will last for two
quarters. The branch will be
i near a German technical univer
sity, an opera, two theaters, mu
i scums and concert halls; and stu
! dents will be encouraged to take
; advantage of these.
European leaders of university
and public life will visit the cen
ter regularly. Opportunity for
travel, privately or in groups, to
the rest of Europe will be pro
vided. Every effort will be made
to bring German and Stanford
students together. Students and
faculty will eat their meals, typi
cally European, together.
Regular Stanford credit will be
j offered for all courses taken at
| the study center. Expenses for
two quarters at Stanford in Ger
many will be the same as two
(quarters here, including tuition,
I room and board and the trip to
j Germany, which will be by char-
I tered plane.

Students will be responsible lor
their personal expenses, and also
for ihe cost of their return trip
to the United States.
Stanford men and women in
Germany will be expected to ad
here to the Fundamental Stand
ard and the Honor Code. While
students are living on the study
center campus in Germany, and
not traveling, there will be appro
priate regulations covering stu
dent activities of an academic or
social nature, developed by usual
student government procedures.
Excursions organized by the staff
will bo supervised in much the
same way as a field trip at Stan
ford.
On private trips, during week
ends and holidays or between
quarters, the same social regula
tions and code as in the United
States will apply. Students, while
away from the study center, will
not be chaperoned but will be ex
peeled to exercise good .judgment.
The University's position is
that a considerable degree of lib
erty should be granted every stu
dent. However, students should
realize that while in Germany
they voluntarily assume a defi
nite responsibility for represent
ing I heir country abroad. Before
students leave for Germany, par
ents will be asked to sign a state
ment indicating consent.
Private automobiles will not bo
necessary, as travel by public
carriers is easily arranged in Eu

rope. Students may not bring
cars from the United States, and
they must get approval of the fac
ulty director of the study center
to rent or purchase automobiles
in Europe.
The director will require evi
i dence of complete insurance cov
erage. and a statement of paren
tal approval and acceptance of
responsibility. Permission may
be revoked at any time by the di
rector for unsatisfactory conduct.
The Committee on General
! Studies will select students for
the program on the basis of past
academic performance, personal
qualifications, balance, reliability,
tolerance and the general ability
to live amicably with others. The
group will be diversified yet eon
-1 genial, expected to contribute
I something of value and to gain
something of value from the ex
i periencc.

j or senior standing by June 15,
