The days grow short, Ihe nights grow long, Iho norlh wind
doth blow, and a light frost appears on the knees of coeds.
Christmas is ieumen in, and onee more our keen young
minds turn to the vexing problem of Christmas gifts.
Let us examine first the most vexing of all gift problems:
What do you buy for the person who has everything? Well
sir, when you encounter this dilemma, the best thing to
do is sei/e it by the horns. Ask yourself 1 his quest ion: I )oes
he truly have everything? Does he, for example, have a
birthmark? A Maeh number? A lacrosse net? An I-beam?
An S-hook? A I -bolt ? A T-square? A Primus stove?
(There is, incidentally, quite an interesting little storv
about how Primus came to invent the stove. Before Primus's
invention, cooking was rather a hazardous occupation.
People just built fires any old place—the floor, the closet,
the escritoire—and often as not the whole house would go
u)i in flames along with the dinner. Primus, a goose
plucker of Frankfurt-am-Main, kept Ihinking there must
be a more efficient way to cook. Finally, in a flash of in
spiration, it came to him: Why not build a device to contain
the fire and keep it from spreading?
(Well sir, he built precisely such a device and named if
after his beloved wife Stove. Primus's first Stove, it must
be confessed, was less than a triumph; his mistake was in
building it out of paper. The next Stove, built of wood,
fared hardly better. Not until he made one out of metal
could the Stove really be called a success.
(But even then the Stove was not entirely satisfactory.
The trouble was that, Ihe Stove filled up with ashes and
became useless after a few weeks. It remained for Primus's
son Frederick 1o conquer thai problem. lie invented a
mechanism to remove ashes from the bottom of Ihe Stove
and was thenceforth known to posterity as Frederick the.
Grate.)
But I digress. We were discussing Christmas gifts. This
year, as every year, a popular gift is Ihe smoking jacket.
And what do the smoking jackets smoke? Why, Marlboro,
of course—every map jacket of them. And why wouldn't
lliev smoke Marlboros? Why wouldn't anybody with a
laste bud in his head? You get such a lot to like in a Marl
boro —filter .. . flavor... flip-top box.
Here is no filter to hollow the cheeks and bug Ihe eye
balls; here is a filter that draws nice and easy. Mere i- no
flavor to pale and pall; here is a flavor ever fresh, ever
xestful. Here is no flimsy pack to crumble and shred its
precious cargo; here is a sturdy box that keeps each ciga
rette plump and pristine.
Speaking of smoking, the year's most unusual gift item
is a brand-new cigarette lighter that never needs refilling.
You are scoffing. You are saying you have heard such claims
before. But it's true, I promise you. This new lighter
never, never needs refilling! The fuel supply lasts forever.
Of course, there are certain disadvantages. For one
ihing, the lighter is rather bulky—l7o feet long and three
stories high.
But look on the bright side: As the fuel runs out, you
can rent rooms in it. „ , M7iM „

Christmas is ieumen in, and onee more our keen young
minds turn to the vexing problem of Christmas gifts.
Let us examine first the most vexing of all gift problems:
What do you buy for the person who has everything? Well
sir, when you encounter this dilemma, the best thing to
do is sei/e it by the horns. Ask yourself 1 his quest ion: I )oes
he truly have everything? Does he, for example, have a
birthmark? A Maeh number? A lacrosse net? An I-beam?
An S-hook? A I -bolt ? A T-square? A Primus stove?
(There is, incidentally, quite an interesting little storv
about how Primus came to invent the stove. Before Primus's
invention, cooking was rather a hazardous occupation.
People just built fires any old place—the floor, the closet,
the escritoire—and often as not the whole house would go
u)i in flames along with the dinner. Primus, a goose
plucker of Frankfurt-am-Main, kept Ihinking there must
be a more efficient way to cook. Finally, in a flash of in
spiration, it came to him: Why not build a device to contain
the fire and keep it from spreading?
(Well sir, he built precisely such a device and named if
after his beloved wife Stove. Primus's first Stove, it must
be confessed, was less than a triumph; his mistake was in
building it out of paper. The next Stove, built of wood,
fared hardly better. Not until he made one out of metal
could the Stove really be called a success.
(But even then the Stove was not entirely satisfactory.
The trouble was that, Ihe Stove filled up with ashes and
became useless after a few weeks. It remained for Primus's
son Frederick 1o conquer thai problem. lie invented a
mechanism to remove ashes from the bottom of Ihe Stove
and was thenceforth known to posterity as Frederick the.
Grate.)
But I digress. We were discussing Christmas gifts. This
year, as every year, a popular gift is Ihe smoking jacket.
And what do the smoking jackets smoke? Why, Marlboro,
of course—every map jacket of them. And why wouldn't
lliev smoke Marlboros? Why wouldn't anybody with a
laste bud in his head? You get such a lot to like in a Marl
boro —filter .. . flavor... flip-top box.
Here is no filter to hollow the cheeks and bug Ihe eye
balls; here is a filter that draws nice and easy. Mere i- no
flavor to pale and pall; here is a flavor ever fresh, ever
xestful. Here is no flimsy pack to crumble and shred its
precious cargo; here is a sturdy box that keeps each ciga
rette plump and pristine.
Speaking of smoking, the year's most unusual gift item
is a brand-new cigarette lighter that never needs refilling.
You are scoffing. You are saying you have heard such claims
before. But it's true, I promise you. This new lighter
never, never needs refilling! The fuel supply lasts forever.
Of course, there are certain disadvantages. For one
ihing, the lighter is rather bulky—l7o feet long and three
stories high.
But look on the bright side: As the fuel runs out, you
can rent rooms in it. „ , M7iM „
