# Suspended Sentence For Girard
## Slaving Called 'Whim'; Light Verdict Satisfies Prosecution, Defense 
### 
MAEBASHI, Japan (/P)—A Jap
anese court yesterday convicted
Sp. 3-C Filliam Girard of killing
a woman brass-picker in a "child
ish whim" and gave him a sus
pended sentence of three years.
The suspension provides for
four years' good behavior.
It permits 22-year-old Sp. 3-C
Girard, of Ottawa, 111., to return
to the United States if neither do
te nso nor prosecution appeals
within 14 days.
Appeals
Either side may appeal a ver
dict in Japan.
The three-judge, no-Jury district
court also ordered Girard to pay
witness fees of the trial. It had
convened in 15 intermittent ses
sions since Aug. 26. The fees are
expected to total about $20.
The court sharply rejected de
fense claims that the U.S. Army,
not Japan, should have tried Gi
rard because he was performing
military duties.
Neither side disclosed appeal
plans immediately.
Satisfaction
There were strong signs, how
ever. that both were satisfied with
Ihe verdict in the Jan. 30 shooting
that brought a crisis in U.S.-Jap
anese relations last summer.
Judge Yuzo Kawachi rejected
Girard's denials and accepted tes
timony of fellow GI Victor Nickel,
Inkster, Mich., and Japanese wit
nesses that Girard exceeded his
guard duties by enticing shell
pickers with hand motions and
shouts.
Sentencing
Thus, the judge said, "the ac
cused is sentenced to three years
of imprisonment with hard labor."
But Kawachi added, in the next
breath, "However, the above sen
tence shall be suspended for a
period of four years from the
date of this judgment," because
Girard was not completely to
blame.
Conviction could have meant a
possible penalty of 2 to 15 years
at hard labor. The prosecution
had asked for a five-year sen- j
tence.
Not Sole Blame
Kawachi scolded the trespassing :
Japanese shell-pickers.
"They cannot escape being
shouldered with the burden of
half the criticism . . ." he declared.
"It is not appropriate to place the
entire responsibility .. . only upon
a simple soldier, the accused, im
mature as is his thinking. . .

guard duties by enticing shell
pickers with hand motions and
shouts.
Sentencing
Thus, the judge said, "the ac
cused is sentenced to three years
of imprisonment with hard labor."
But Kawachi added, in the next
breath, "However, the above sen
tence shall be suspended for a
period of four years from the
date of this judgment," because
Girard was not completely to
blame.
Conviction could have meant a
possible penalty of 2 to 15 years
at hard labor. The prosecution
had asked for a five-year sen- j
tence.
Not Sole Blame
Kawachi scolded the trespassing :
Japanese shell-pickers.
"They cannot escape being
shouldered with the burden of
half the criticism . . ." he declared.
"It is not appropriate to place the
entire responsibility .. . only upon
a simple soldier, the accused, im
mature as is his thinking. . .
MAEBASHI, Japan (/P)—A Jap
anese court yesterday convicted
Sp. 3-C Filliam Girard of killing
a woman brass-picker in a "child
ish whim" and gave him a sus
pended sentence of three years.
The suspension provides for
four years' good behavior.
It permits 22-year-old Sp. 3-C
Girard, of Ottawa, 111., to return
to the United States if neither do
te nso nor prosecution appeals
within 14 days.
Appeals
Either side may appeal a ver
dict in Japan.
The three-judge, no-Jury district
court also ordered Girard to pay
witness fees of the trial. It had
convened in 15 intermittent ses
sions since Aug. 26. The fees are
expected to total about $20.
The court sharply rejected de
fense claims that the U.S. Army,
not Japan, should have tried Gi
rard because he was performing
military duties.
Neither side disclosed appeal
plans immediately.
Satisfaction
There were strong signs, how
ever. that both were satisfied with
Ihe verdict in the Jan. 30 shooting
that brought a crisis in U.S.-Jap
anese relations last summer.
Judge Yuzo Kawachi rejected
Girard's denials and accepted tes
timony of fellow GI Victor Nickel,
Inkster, Mich., and Japanese wit
nesses that Girard exceeded his
guard duties by enticing shell
pickers with hand motions and
shouts.
