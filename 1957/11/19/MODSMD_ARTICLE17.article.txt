# FROM ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## U.S. Arms to Tunisia 
### 
EUJlor's Note: Michel Barret, an ASSU
Foreign Scholar from Franee, has kindly of
tVwi to give The Daily liis country's feelings
on the present tensions existing between the
United States and Great Britain, on the one
Hand, and France on the other. The crisis has
developed over an agreement l>y the U.S. and
Britain to ship small arms to Tunisia, a pro-
Western Arab state. Officially, France has
claimed the arms would eventually end in the
hands of Algerian rebels. The future of NATO
may well depend on the outcome of this con
troversy.
By Michel liarrrt
France has been angered by Ihe shipment of
American arms to Tunisia. Whatever solution
can be found will take a long time before the
French people forget what happened and work
again in full co-operation with the United States
and Great Britain. In the following I will try to
express my viewpoint on this matter.
What was the problem to solve?
The following elements should be kept in
mind:
• Tunisia is an independent country.
• Tunisia wanted ammunition whether from
the West or from the East.
• This ammunition will likely end up shortly
in the hands of the rebels in Algeria.
Keeping these elements in mind, the United
States had two courses it could follow—either
send arms or not send arms. What are the con
sequences of following either course?
If no arms had been sent to Tunisia, then:
• Tunisia would have got ammunition from
Russia through Egypt.
• Russia would have used the fact for propa
ganda purposes.
But:
• It would have been an opportunity to show,
Ihree weeks before the NATO meeting, that the
Occidental nations are united.

• Tunisia would not have turned 1o Commu
nism just like it is not now turning to capitalism
because of American rifles.
• Tunisia is not willing to follow Ihe East or
the West but wants to take advantage of its
position like any other normal country would.
But since arms have already been sent, and
Without consulting France:
• Tunisia is protected against Communism!
• The Americans got Iherc before the Rus
sians.
But:
• Those few rifles that are going to kill
French young men are very important in 11k 1
French people's minds.
• Is the idea of keeping a step ahead of Ihe
Russians worth to the United States Ihe friend
ship of thousands of French people whose sons
or friends might be killed by an American-manu
factured bullet?
• Knowing that President Bourguiba of Tu
nisia will receive Russian arms anyway through
President Nasser of Egypt, is it worth it to have
the American and British embassies in Paris pro
tected by the army?
These are some of the consequences of the
shipment of a few rifles to Tunisia. I bitterly
regret that the co-operation between our coun
tries must undergo such a blow, but Mr. Dulles
could not have known the psychological conse
quences of such a small action, and we could
not tell him as we did not know about the ship
ment.
A third solution might have been adopted. The
same arms could have been delivered through
the intermediation of France which could have
negotiated an agreement with President Bour
guiba as to the employment of the arms. Even
if this availed nothing as far as the final desti
nation of the arms is concerned, still, the psycho
logical effect on the people of the Ameri
can shipments would have disappeared.

• The Americans got Iherc before the Rus
sians.
But:
• Those few rifles that are going to kill
French young men are very important in 11k 1
French people's minds.
• Is the idea of keeping a step ahead of Ihe
Russians worth to the United States Ihe friend
ship of thousands of French people whose sons
or friends might be killed by an American-manu
factured bullet?
• Knowing that President Bourguiba of Tu
nisia will receive Russian arms anyway through
President Nasser of Egypt, is it worth it to have
the American and British embassies in Paris pro
tected by the army?
These are some of the consequences of the
shipment of a few rifles to Tunisia. I bitterly
regret that the co-operation between our coun
tries must undergo such a blow, but Mr. Dulles
could not have known the psychological conse
quences of such a small action, and we could
not tell him as we did not know about the ship
ment.
A third solution might have been adopted. The
same arms could have been delivered through
the intermediation of France which could have
negotiated an agreement with President Bour
guiba as to the employment of the arms. Even
if this availed nothing as far as the final desti
nation of the arms is concerned, still, the psycho
logical effect on the people of the Ameri
can shipments would have disappeared.

France has been angered by Ihe shipment of
American arms to Tunisia. Whatever solution
can be found will take a long time before the
French people forget what happened and work
again in full co-operation with the United States
and Great Britain. In the following I will try to
express my viewpoint on this matter.
What was the problem to solve?
The following elements should be kept in
mind:
• Tunisia is an independent country.
• Tunisia wanted ammunition whether from
the West or from the East.
• This ammunition will likely end up shortly
in the hands of the rebels in Algeria.
Keeping these elements in mind, the United
States had two courses it could follow—either
send arms or not send arms. What are the con
sequences of following either course?
If no arms had been sent to Tunisia, then:
• Tunisia would have got ammunition from
Russia through Egypt.
• Russia would have used the fact for propa
ganda purposes.
But:
• It would have been an opportunity to show,
Ihree weeks before the NATO meeting, that the
Occidental nations are united.

• Tunisia would not have turned 1o Commu
nism just like it is not now turning to capitalism
because of American rifles.
• Tunisia is not willing to follow Ihe East or
the West but wants to take advantage of its
position like any other normal country would.
But since arms have already been sent, and
