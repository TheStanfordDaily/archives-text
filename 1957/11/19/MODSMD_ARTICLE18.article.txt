Brutality of Man
Editor, Tho Daily:
This correspondent is indeed pleased at tho
heartening wave of public protest which has en
gulfed tho Soviet Union as a result of its cruelty
in putting aloft a defenseless member of the
animal kingdom for the selfish ends of mere
scientific advancement.
It gives one a warm feeling to see that there
are so many perceptive people who, in ihe face
of the great clamor over the military and scien
tific significance of the Soviet launching of
"Mutnik" (and need we add insidl to injury by
1 his crude cpithel which denies the poor beast
even of breed?) have realized the oven greater
import of this action as representing a zenith, or
more properly, a nadir in the inglorious historc
|sic) of brutality of man in his treatment of his
best friend, and most rapid animal competition.
As Irene Castle McLaughlin Enzinger, famour
fsiej former ballroom danseuse, pointed out in
Little Rock, Ark., "They (the Russian dogs)
have no chance to speak up as to whether they
Want to be used in these experiments." Mrs.
Castle McLaughlin Enzinger's point is well
taken. Why couldn't (lie Russians have asked for
dogs to volunteer for this dangerous experiment,
instead of arbitrarily selecting one who probably
didn't even want to go?
And yet we American[s] cannot afford to sit
back smugly in the assumption lliat our scien
tists are ahead of the Soviets in their efforts to
be more humane in iheir treatment of animals.
As Estelle Taylor, president of the California Pet
Owners' Protective League, observed, "Our coun
try will do the same thing Ihe same as it has in

atomic tests." Yes, let us not forget that it will j
be many years before we Americans forget the
atrocious way in which our government blew up
so many dogs at Alamogordo, N.M. N'o wonder
there's a big fireball down there turning off car
motors.

Approaching Classless Society
Editor, The Daily:
A paragraph appeared on the front page of
The Daily last Friday |Nov. 8| which stated:
"Stanford announced that tuition will be in
creased to $335 a quarter. Much of the new in
come will be applied to increases in faculty sala
ries and in student aid."
Now I don't think anyone is opposed to in
creasing faculty salaries if it is necessary to re
tain our present staff and to entice other in
structors of good quality to come to Stanford. It
is the second use of the increased income that
bothers me. Apparently part of the tuition raise
is not to be used for running the school either
academically or financially. But instead, more
financial aid will be given to students. In other
words, a paying student at Stanford is called
upon to provide his own tuition and part of
someone else's.
How many educations do we have to buy? Is
this present policy of the University an attempt
to level out the financial resources of the stu
dents? If so, is this in Ihe spirit of altruism or is
it part of a planned program? It appears that
we are approaching a classless society far more
rapidly than Russia.
