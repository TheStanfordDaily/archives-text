Lefs Even I lie Series

It's Big Game time. And the odds-makers already favor Stanford
over California by one touchdown. But this only gives the city
sports scribes a "stronger" reason for picking the Bears to win.
The underdog usually does, or haven't you rear! the script?
Cal holds a one-game victory margin over the Indians in the
grid classic which dates back to 1892. The Bears have won 25; the
Cards, 24;- and 10 games have ended in ties. In the last 11 years
Stanford has managed only two wins over the Berkeleyites- in 1946
and in 1955. Two of the struggles ended in ties in 1950 and 1953.
Since becoming head mentor at Stanford, ('buck Taylor has man
aged only one win over Cal <19-0 in 1955). In the past six years the
Indians have been favored to win four of the games. Cal upset the
experts' predictions by downing the Cards twice and tying them
another time. The Rose Bowl-bound team of 1951 was upset, 27-20;
last year's "disappointment" was defeated, 20-18; the Bobby Garrett
led eleven of 1953 was tied, 21-21; and the 1955 team won, 19-0.
So more often than not, the Big Game has been played according
to the script with the underdog upsetting the favored team. This
has been true especially if the favored team has something to gain,
such as the Rose Bowl bid. But this year's tussle can be compared
with that of 1955 in that both teams need the win to "salvage" the
season. Stanford now has a 5-4 season mark and a Big Game win
would give them a winning season of 6-4. In 1955 the Indians won
six games. Cal, on the other hand, needs this game to "save" face,
probably Coach Fete Elliott's. But even if they win they will finish
with the worst season record <2-8) since 1882 the year the Univer
sity of California was founded.
Elliott began coaching after his graduation from the University
of Michigan by being named an end coach at Oregon State in 1949.
He remained there until 1951 when he became assistant to Bud Wil
kinson at Oklahoma. In 1955 he was selected to become head coach
at Nebraska and last year was named lo succeed Pappy Waldorf at
Cal. His record at Cal has not been impressive not as impressive
as the city papers had painted it would be. And that is probably why

his only one win and eight de
feats look so hurl. The scribes
predicted all kinds of laurels
would go to Ihe Cal learn this
year the Rose Bowl included.
But I hey overlooked Cal's hard,
inlersectional schedule of SMU,
Michigan State and Navy. Also
misjudged was the material with
which lie had to work. The Cal
team has lacked depth and steadi
ness all season.
Stanford has been no "ball of
fire." Disappointing, close losses
to WSC and Oregon make Stan
ford look worse than they really
are. Their offense is the most bal-

anced on the Coast and that includes Oregon State. But their
inconsistent line play and horrible pass defense have led to their
downfall. In spite of their weaknesses I pick the Indians to defeat
Cal by at least two touchdowns and even the series at 2f> games
apiece. Why? Let's just say I'm a "red-hot."

In other "big games" in the conference I pick UCLA over IJSC;
Washington over Washington State; and Oregon State over Oregon.
Oh, and in the most important of all, The Stanford Daily over The
Daily California!! in the "Ink Bowl." In the latter game. Hie Stan
ford scribes will have to rely on scoring a lot of TD's because their
one and only P.A.T. kicker has the Asian flu and will miss the tilt.

The West Coast nominating board for the Associated Press All-
America selections chose three Stanford players for their choices
of the "best from the West." Those selected were seniors Jack Doug
las and Chuck shea and junior Troy Barbee. Douglas was named at
Hie quarterback post; Shea, fullback; and Barbee, tackle.

The 'Story' Behind the Doublecross

Wally Simpson, The Daily editor, received this anonymous letter
yesterday postmarked from Honolulu:
AGAIN STANFORD DOUBLEC ROSSED RV FRIENDS
"For the second-year in a row Stanford has been knifed by its
friends. Stanford voted with the northern schools to sandbag the
bigger schools, athletically, thinking that by so doing they would
be assured of a Rose Bowl bid.
"In 1956, Oregon State double-crossed Stanford by coming up
with a better team. In 1957. Stanford had a chance to right a wrong
by voting with the California schools and allowing some sinned
against athletes to play football. Stanford, however, once again
chose to vote northern. They reasoned that lightning couldn't pos
sibly strike in the same place twice.
"Now again, in 1957. one of the northern schools has double
crossed Stanford by coming up with a better team. Stanford has
learned that Rose Bowl bids cannot be bought or gained by collusion.
They must be earned."
SPEAKING OF BAD YELLS: When Stanford gained a first
down deep in Oregon State territory last Saturday because of an
interference penalty against the Beavers, the OSC rooting section
replied with: "The referee lias no father."
