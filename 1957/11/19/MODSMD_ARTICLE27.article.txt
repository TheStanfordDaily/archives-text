# Elliott Predicts Best Big Game Effort
## Says Cal Has Good Chance To Win Game 
### Associated Press 
California coach Pete Elliott
took a note from the optimism
notebook of Stanford coach Chuck
Taylor yesterday and said of their
Big Game coming up here Satur
day :
"It will be a real, best-effort
affair. We always feel we'll do
our very best and have a good
possibility of winning."
California has won but one
game in nine outings this season,
| while Stanford boasts a 5-4 mark,
; but Taylor said:
"We are quite concerned be
cause of the variety of California
formations and the problem of de
fending against them. Although
the scores haven't been in their
j favor, they have constantly im
proved."
A crowd of 90,0000 is expected
for the Saturday battle.in Stan
-1 ford Stadium. Elliott and Taylor
gave their little previews at the
Palo Alto luncheon yesterday of
I the Northern California Football
Writers Association.
The California coach said Ron
i Wheat croft, the Bears' outstand
| ing end, isn't counted on for any
| service because of a knee injury
I suffered last Saturday when Cali
| fornia lost to Washington, 35-27.
Quarterback Joe Kapp, shaken up
in the game, should be okay.
In its offense this year, basi
cally a split T, California also has
used an unbalanced line variation,
a flanker and a bit of single wing.
"Last Saturday California play
ed a team which I consider to be
the toughest in the Pacific Coast
Conference at this time," said
Taylor. "So perhaps California
right now is the second strongest.
I'll agree with Pete—it will take
the biggest and best effort."
Elliott said Ron Currie would
replace Wheatcroft at end, but
that this probably would lie the
only change from the lineup
which started against Washing
ton.
Taylor reported no injuries in
last Saturday's loss to Oregon
State.
"We didn't play to the level of
: our previous games against Ore
' gon State," said Taylor, whose
j club lost 24-14.
Asked it there was any chance
that A 1 Harrington, injured two
weeks ago against Southern Cali
fornia, could play, the Stanford
coach said no, adding, "It's quite
a loss."

took a note from the optimism
notebook of Stanford coach Chuck
Taylor yesterday and said of their
Big Game coming up here Satur
day :
"It will be a real, best-effort
affair. We always feel we'll do
our very best and have a good
possibility of winning."
California has won but one
game in nine outings this season,
| while Stanford boasts a 5-4 mark,
; but Taylor said:
"We are quite concerned be
cause of the variety of California
formations and the problem of de
fending against them. Although
the scores haven't been in their
j favor, they have constantly im
proved."
A crowd of 90,0000 is expected
for the Saturday battle.in Stan
-1 ford Stadium. Elliott and Taylor
gave their little previews at the
Palo Alto luncheon yesterday of
I the Northern California Football
Writers Association.
The California coach said Ron
i Wheat croft, the Bears' outstand
| ing end, isn't counted on for any
| service because of a knee injury
I suffered last Saturday when Cali
| fornia lost to Washington, 35-27.
Quarterback Joe Kapp, shaken up
in the game, should be okay.
In its offense this year, basi
cally a split T, California also has
used an unbalanced line variation,
a flanker and a bit of single wing.
"Last Saturday California play
ed a team which I consider to be
the toughest in the Pacific Coast
Conference at this time," said
Taylor. "So perhaps California
right now is the second strongest.
I'll agree with Pete—it will take
the biggest and best effort."
Elliott said Ron Currie would
replace Wheatcroft at end, but
that this probably would lie the
only change from the lineup
which started against Washing
ton.
Taylor reported no injuries in
last Saturday's loss to Oregon
State.
"We didn't play to the level of
: our previous games against Ore
' gon State," said Taylor, whose
j club lost 24-14.
Asked it there was any chance
that A 1 Harrington, injured two
weeks ago against Southern Cali
fornia, could play, the Stanford
coach said no, adding, "It's quite
a loss."
