# Formed in 1891
## Glee Club to Join Band During Half-Time Show 
### Margot Zeiss 
The Stanford Glee Club is
making its first campus perform
ance this year during the half
time show at the Big Game with
the University of California. The
Glee Club will join the Marching
Band in presenting such old fa
vorites as "Oh, Susanna" and
"Battle Hymn of the Republic."
Having a men's glee club is a
tradition on Stanford's campus.
The first club was organized in
1891, and, although it was short
lived, it led to a highly selective
and popular group that performed
all over the Coast in the years
from 1893 to 1918.
World War I, which disrupted
all campus organizations, caused
the demise of the Glee Club. Pres
ident Harding's "return to nor
malcy" also saw the return of a
glee club to the Stanford campus.
Concert Music
This group concentrated on con
cert rather than popular music
and swelled to an enrollment of
over 70 members in 1921. The or
ganization patterned itself after
the famous Harvard Glee Club

and went on many highly profit
able tours and engagements.
In 1927 Dr. Warren S. Allen be
came discouraged with the com
mercial character of the club and
resigned as director. At the same
time, the University withdrew its
financial .support, and the Glee
Club was put under the auspices
of the ASSU.
A graduate member of the Glee
Club, Dr. Allen's assistant, took
over the job of director and re
mained in this post until 1935.
With the growing Depression, the
Glee Club lost importance gradu
ally, and its history from that
date until 1954 is one of repeated
reorganizations and failures due
to inexperienced leadership, inade
quate financial support from the
University and the ASSU, and stu
dent apathy.
';»4 Spring Sing
Spring Sing of 3954 produced
the seed which has grown into
the Glee Club of today. A group
of male freshmen who had taken
part in the Sing and won decided
they would like to make the group
a permanent organization for the
Stanford campus.
Eight men took part in the orig
inal planning and wrote letters to
established glee clubs in the East
and Mid-East, including Harvard
and Dartmouth. The replies prov
ed both useful and encouraging.
The present Glee Club is a di
rect continuation of this group
and has shown great progress in
three years. It has grown from
less than 30 men to over 60. Part
of its success is due to the enthu
siasm of Ivan Rasmusscn, the
club's director. Rasmusscn is a
voice teacher with the Music De
partment.
No Credit
The Glee Club differs from the
University Chorus and Choir be
cause it is an "activity." The club
is not connected with the Music
Department, an d no academic
credit is given for participation.
The men in the club are there be
cause they love to sing.
Under the leadership of presi
dent Clark McEuen and Wayne
Anderson, the club's student di
rector and baritone soloist, the
Glee Club is planning an active
schedule this year.
They are appearing at the Mark
Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco
for the 25th anniversary of the
Class of '32 the night before the
Big Game. Besides their Big Game
half-time show with the Band, the
men are scheduled to sing for
various alumni organizations this
quarter, including a performance
for the faculty wives at the Dis
taff Club.
Big Plans
Bookings for '58 include the an
nual spring concert and a pro
posed tour of the northern Pacific
Coast—possibly including a per
formance in Sacramento—during
spring vacation.
In keeping with the famous in
formal atmosphere of the Stan
ford campus, the Glee Club is an
informal group. They are pat
terned more after the Yale Whif
fen poofs — well known for their
casual performances — than the
more formal glee clubs such as
Michigan's or the Purdue Glee
Club, which is renowned for its
tails and top hats as well as its
singing.

The Glee Club is hampered in
its activities by a lack of funds
and is prevented from being the
great propaganda force for Stan
ford that the Eastern glee clubs,
such as Harvard and Dartmouth,
are for their schools. It is actively
in pursuit of alumni support so
that it can enlarge the scope of
its activities.
Varied Repertoire
The repertoire of the group in
cludes spirituals, sea chanties,
folk songs, sacred music and the
popular medley of college songs.
The men in the club have high
hopes that this organization will
be a lasting one—the end of the
string of organizations that have
constituted the glee club tradition
on the Stanford campus. They
feel that a well-known, widely
touring glee club could make a
name for Stanford in the way that
few organizations can.
As president McEuen says: "A
famous glee club such as the East
ern schools have would be a tre
mendous asset to Stan/ord, be
sides being a money-making prop
osition. If given a little support
from the administration and the
students, this Glee Club can grow
into a group that will make Stan
ford well known all over the
country."
