# 'FROSH INFERNO'
## Wood Collection Begins For Traditional Bonfire 
### Morrie Hodges 
Freshmen will begin the wood
collection for Thursday night's 35-
to-50-foot-high Bonfire this after
noon at 1:00, and this morning, if
there is no rain, Pacific Gas &
Electric men will drive in the
utility poles to hold the heap of
wood.
Cardinals has rented 10 l'i-ton
staked trucks from the Hengehold
Truck Company to be used today
until 6:00 and all day tomorrow.
The trucks will be loaded with as
many freshmen as possible from
Wilbur. The men are urged to
wear old clothes and to use gloves.
There have been 43 offers of
scrap wood and brush, but only
the 15 offers nearest campus have
been accepted. The wood piles
which will be collected range in
area from Mountain View to Red
wood City.
As the wood is brought back

and dumped in dry Lake Lagu
nita, the guarding will begin.
Starting tonight and continuing
until the actual burning, uniform
ed policemen will be on hand.
The PG&E Company has do
nated the poles and the labor nec
essary to drive them into place.
On Thursday, after collection of
the wood has been completed, the
Shell and Cook oil companies will
spray the pile with oil they have
donated to make the fire burn
well at the rally.
48-Hour Limit
According to Clyde VVyant. in
charge of the wood collecting,
"there is no margin of error" in
the timing of building of the Bon
fire, because the freshmen will
have a strict limit of 48 hours to
complete the project.
Doug Brown, chosen by Cardi
nals to organize the Bonfire, has
been working since September to
schedule and time the order of the
building so that the freshmen will
be able to take over completely.
He has a committee of six to help
him.
Today Wyant and Ivl Epstein,
in charge of getting the freshmen
out, will turn the Bonfire-building
over to the frosh, and tomorrow
Jim It obe r t so 11, construction
chairman, will start them at pil
ing the wood.
lie freshmen Is
Marilyn Beck is the committee
member in charge of organizing
the Roble freshmen to serve hot
coffee tomorrow night during the
big push, while the Branner girls,
under the direction of Veloris
Brown, arc constructing a crcpc
paper "Oskie" to be burned at the
top of the fire.
Brown's final committee mem
ber. Bob Mang, has been in charge
of publicity for the freshman ef
forts. &
Wyant sums up the committee's
position on the Bonfire as they
turn its construction over to the
Class of '01 as follows: "We have
plenty of wood accounted for, and
trucks to collect the wood, but the
important thing now is to get Ihe
freshmen out to collect and
build."
