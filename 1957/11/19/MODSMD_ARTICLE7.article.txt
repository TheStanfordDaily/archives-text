# Gaieties Opens Four-Day Run; All Show Material By Students
## Carnival, Straight Humor, Satiric Scenes Featured Opening Number Predicted as Show-Stopper; Ram's Head Places Ban on All Publicity Shuts 
### Pat Brenner 
At 9:15 this evening the curtain will go up to reveal the 1957
Gaieties, product of nearly a year's planning and revision by Ram's
J Mead, producer of the annual gala musical revue.
Nearly as basic to Big Game Week as the grid battle itself is the
| annual presentation, with words, music and dialogue written by

Stanford students. Twenty-one i
colorful acts will highlight the
revue, including skits, dances, spc- j
cialty acts and original music.
Since its inauguration in 15)22,
Gaieties has arisen from a small
campus presentation to one of the
brightest revues on the coast, at
tended not only by students hut
by Big Game fans from every
where. As is the custom, Gaieties!
this year will ridicule Stanford as
well as everything else that there |
is time for within two hours of
entertainment.
Opening Night
Tonight begins Gaieties' four
day run, with curtain time at 8:15
tomorrow and Friday nights, and
at 9:1.5 again on Thursday to al
low time for the Bonfire Rally at
Lake Lagunita.
Tickets are still available at the
Memorial Hall box office on cam
pus, and Ram's Head sources re
port that excellent seats are still
available for tonight's and Thurs
day's performances.
The opening number is predict
ed to be the show-stopper, and
Ram's Head has put a ban on all
publicity shots. The skit came out
of an argument between Mark
Hammer and Dave Lamb over
what act should open the produc
tion. The result: both do on a
i split stage!
: On each set throughout the eve
ning, in some obscure corner, a
mouse hole will be painted—a Gai
eties tradition dating back to the
j times when felines were scarcer j
and mice more plentiful on the i
; campus.
"Mardi Gras Magic"
A cast of TO, including soloists,
dancers and specialists, will pre-1
sent the production throughout
; the week. Highlighting this year's
I show will be a musical produc
; tion number entitled "Mardi Gras
| Magic," which features voodoo
1 and calypso rhythm orchestrated
| with great emphasis on drums.
Special lighting and costume ef
fects will help to produce the car
| nival atmosphere.
Several hilarious skits with
original themes will provide '57
Gaieties with its humor. Exam
-1 pics are "Gone with the Wind
skv." a version of the novel as it
might have been written by Tol
stoy during the Russian Revolu
tion, and "Small Tube, Please,"
j showing the effect on a small
town druggist of his TV commer
i cial counterpart. Other skits have
j adopted various themes, including
"Romeo and .Juliet" jazzed up and
I a satire on magazines.

with wide experience in college

| as producing or directing.

At 9:15 this evening the curtain will go up to reveal the 1957
Gaieties, product of nearly a year's planning and revision by Ram's
J Mead, producer of the annual gala musical revue.
Nearly as basic to Big Game Week as the grid battle itself is the
| annual presentation, with words, music and dialogue written by

Stanford students. Twenty-one i
colorful acts will highlight the
revue, including skits, dances, spc- j
cialty acts and original music.
Since its inauguration in 15)22,
Gaieties has arisen from a small
campus presentation to one of the
brightest revues on the coast, at
tended not only by students hut
by Big Game fans from every
where. As is the custom, Gaieties!
this year will ridicule Stanford as
well as everything else that there |
is time for within two hours of
entertainment.
Opening Night
Tonight begins Gaieties' four
day run, with curtain time at 8:15
tomorrow and Friday nights, and
at 9:1.5 again on Thursday to al
low time for the Bonfire Rally at
Lake Lagunita.
Tickets are still available at the
Memorial Hall box office on cam
pus, and Ram's Head sources re
port that excellent seats are still
available for tonight's and Thurs
day's performances.
The opening number is predict
ed to be the show-stopper, and
Ram's Head has put a ban on all
publicity shots. The skit came out
of an argument between Mark
Hammer and Dave Lamb over
what act should open the produc
tion. The result: both do on a
i split stage!
: On each set throughout the eve
ning, in some obscure corner, a
mouse hole will be painted—a Gai
eties tradition dating back to the
j times when felines were scarcer j
and mice more plentiful on the i
; campus.
"Mardi Gras Magic"
A cast of TO, including soloists,
dancers and specialists, will pre-1
sent the production throughout
; the week. Highlighting this year's
I show will be a musical produc
; tion number entitled "Mardi Gras
| Magic," which features voodoo
1 and calypso rhythm orchestrated
| with great emphasis on drums.
Special lighting and costume ef
fects will help to produce the car
| nival atmosphere.
Several hilarious skits with
original themes will provide '57
Gaieties with its humor. Exam
-1 pics are "Gone with the Wind
skv." a version of the novel as it
might have been written by Tol
stoy during the Russian Revolu
tion, and "Small Tube, Please,"
j showing the effect on a small
town druggist of his TV commer
i cial counterpart. Other skits have
j adopted various themes, including
"Romeo and .Juliet" jazzed up and
I a satire on magazines.
