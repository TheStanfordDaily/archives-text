# First 'Axe Day' Will Feature Stunts, 'Bearial'
## 
### 
A new Stanford tradition may be started today with the inaugu
ration of "Axe Day," featuring Indians chasing bears, 1 lie "Bearial
Procession" and the distribution of "Beat Cal" buttons, as Big
Game Week rally activities officially begin.
Another Big Game innovation is the decision for living groups
to decorate their residences instead of making the floats which have
been paraded down University Avenue in the past. Eleven women's
residences and 20 me/s residences have filed for judging with the
ASSU, the results of I, which will be announced at half-time during
Big Game.
Judges of the house decorations will be Mrs. Donald Frecdman,
wife of the business editor of the Palo Alto Times; Hubert R.
Marshall, assistant professor of political science; William L. Cros
ten, professor of music; and Mrs. Jane Coonce, Assistant Dean of
Women.
"Axe Day" has been adopted by Cardinals Board to replace the
old Button Day and get the week's festivities off to a dramatic start
by placing more emphasis on the Stanford Axe, now unfortunately
locked up in Berkeley.
The day will begin with a Stanford Indian chasing a Cal' Bear
around Quad and the Main Library as people come out of 8 o'clock
classes.
The same stunt will be repeated between 9:50 and 10 a.m. in the
area of the Cellar entrance and the Quad. If the Golden Bear hasn't
been caught by this time he will be carrying his extra-point-gotten
Axe in a last effort to avoid capture.
The big event of the day will be "The Bearial Procession" to
start in front of Memorial Auditorium at 11:45 after the General
Biology lecture is dismissed.
Members of the Axe Society will carry the coffin containing "one
very sick bear." Trailing behind will be the pompon girls, the
cheerleaders, Rally Commission members and marchers. Leading
the whole line will be a New Orleans-style jazz band mourning the
death of the bear.

The procession will proceed from Memorial Auditorium along
Serra Street to History Corner. It will turn up the walkway past
the Main Library and Engienering Corner onto Lasuen Street, pick
ing up marchers along the way.
The "mourners" will pass around the Post Office and come back
to the lawn of Main Library. There the "Bearial Coffin will be laid
in state.
Members of the Stanford police will stop traffic as the proces
sion moves through intersections. An Axe Honor Guard will strnd
watch over the coffin from noon until 2 p.m.
Between 12:50 and 1:13 p.m. a collection of traditional Stanford
songs will be played on the Hoover Tower carillon.
At five minutes past two the bear will be "buried." The cheer
leaders will conduct a short service on the Library lawn and then
a procession will remove the coffin.
Also as part of Axe Day four large axe decorations will be hung
on the front of Main Library, from the balcony over the main stairs
inside the Library, on the facade of Memorial Auditorium facing
Hoover Tower, and on the Union Building below the ASSU rooms.
Included in Axe Day will be the passing out of red and white
" Beat Cal" buttons with an axe decoration. Twenty-five hundred
buttons will be given away at the Post Office, Cellar, Engineering
Corner, Main Library and at Bowman Alumni House during the
Alumni Homecoming Luncheon on Friday.
Originally Wednesday was planned solely as Button Day. But
Axe Society brought the enlarged day to Big Game Week chairmen
Steve Halsted and Connie King and it was approved by Cardinals
Board.
Announcements of Axe Day will be put on the blackboards of
all the larger lecture rooms on Quad.
Working out the arrangements for the day has required work
from the ASSU, Cardinals, the Stanford Police Department, the
Dean of Students' Office, Rally Commission, the Main Library
staff, cheerleaders and pompon girls and The Daily.

Members of the Axe Society will carry the coffin containing "one
very sick bear." Trailing behind will be the pompon girls, the
cheerleaders, Rally Commission members and marchers. Leading
the whole line will be a New Orleans-style jazz band mourning the
death of the bear.

The procession will proceed from Memorial Auditorium along
Serra Street to History Corner. It will turn up the walkway past
the Main Library and Engienering Corner onto Lasuen Street, pick
ing up marchers along the way.
The "mourners" will pass around the Post Office and come back
to the lawn of Main Library. There the "Bearial Coffin will be laid
in state.
Members of the Stanford police will stop traffic as the proces
sion moves through intersections. An Axe Honor Guard will strnd
watch over the coffin from noon until 2 p.m.
Between 12:50 and 1:13 p.m. a collection of traditional Stanford
songs will be played on the Hoover Tower carillon.
At five minutes past two the bear will be "buried." The cheer
leaders will conduct a short service on the Library lawn and then
a procession will remove the coffin.
Also as part of Axe Day four large axe decorations will be hung
on the front of Main Library, from the balcony over the main stairs
inside the Library, on the facade of Memorial Auditorium facing
Hoover Tower, and on the Union Building below the ASSU rooms.
Included in Axe Day will be the passing out of red and white
" Beat Cal" buttons with an axe decoration. Twenty-five hundred
buttons will be given away at the Post Office, Cellar, Engineering
Corner, Main Library and at Bowman Alumni House during the
Alumni Homecoming Luncheon on Friday.
Originally Wednesday was planned solely as Button Day. But
Axe Society brought the enlarged day to Big Game Week chairmen
Steve Halsted and Connie King and it was approved by Cardinals
Board.
Announcements of Axe Day will be put on the blackboards of
all the larger lecture rooms on Quad.
Working out the arrangements for the day has required work
from the ASSU, Cardinals, the Stanford Police Department, the
Dean of Students' Office, Rally Commission, the Main Library
staff, cheerleaders and pompon girls and The Daily.

A new Stanford tradition may be started today with the inaugu
ration of "Axe Day," featuring Indians chasing bears, 1 lie "Bearial
Procession" and the distribution of "Beat Cal" buttons, as Big
Game Week rally activities officially begin.
Another Big Game innovation is the decision for living groups
to decorate their residences instead of making the floats which have
been paraded down University Avenue in the past. Eleven women's
residences and 20 me/s residences have filed for judging with the
ASSU, the results of I, which will be announced at half-time during
Big Game.
Judges of the house decorations will be Mrs. Donald Frecdman,
wife of the business editor of the Palo Alto Times; Hubert R.
Marshall, assistant professor of political science; William L. Cros
ten, professor of music; and Mrs. Jane Coonce, Assistant Dean of
Women.
"Axe Day" has been adopted by Cardinals Board to replace the
old Button Day and get the week's festivities off to a dramatic start
by placing more emphasis on the Stanford Axe, now unfortunately
locked up in Berkeley.
The day will begin with a Stanford Indian chasing a Cal' Bear
around Quad and the Main Library as people come out of 8 o'clock
classes.
The same stunt will be repeated between 9:50 and 10 a.m. in the
area of the Cellar entrance and the Quad. If the Golden Bear hasn't
been caught by this time he will be carrying his extra-point-gotten
Axe in a last effort to avoid capture.
The big event of the day will be "The Bearial Procession" to
start in front of Memorial Auditorium at 11:45 after the General
Biology lecture is dismissed.
