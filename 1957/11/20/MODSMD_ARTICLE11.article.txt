# Honor Code Supplemented
## 
### 
The Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission unani
mously passed two motions Mon
day night that clarify the stu
dent's responsibility in regard I >
the Honor Code.
The first of the motion,
stresses the fact that mutual re
sponsibility may be carried out in
more than one way. The motion
reads, "Mutual responsibilily
may be carried out equally well
by discussing the observed viol.i
tion with the violator or by re
porting him to Judicial Council.
The student's choice of these two
methods is dependent on his in
terpretation of the situation."
The fact that it is just as im
portant to carry out the mutual
responsibility of the Honor Code
as it is to observe the personal
obligation is the crux of the sec
ond motion.
"A Stanford student has the
personal responsibility to uphold
honorable standards of conduel
in academic work and an equalh.
important mutual responsibilil y
to others to see that they uphold
these standards."
