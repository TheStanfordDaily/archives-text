# Tired of Dodging Bicycles

I\ A UNIVI'IiSJTY often overeonscious of its tra
ditions. one tradition seems to have been com
pletely forgotten 111 <' ono which savs bicycles
arc not ridden on Inner Quad.
This is one of the few Stanford traditions
with a good reason behind it. With the great
increase in two-wheeled traflie on campus, bi
cnclcs on Quad are becoming a definite menace.
.As one professor whose office faces the Quad
savs, "I can barei\ leave niv office without being
sideswiped by a bicycle.
Inner Quad was plannc I to he a serene sanc-
Inarv in the hearl of the campus, dominated
bv the svnibol of St nford's -pi rii ual life
Memorial Church. The current congestion is
Itardlv conducive to such an atmosphere.
We believe the Stanford campus could do
with a few areas of serenilv to cut (lie tensions
of a hard days slinking. We therefore propose
Ik the I niver.-il\ administration the following

measures for restoring tire tranquillil\ of Fnner
Quad:
• All but pedestrian IrafTie he prohibited
from Quad.
» I hose areas now* covered with gravel he
planted with lawns, in the manner of Memo
rial Court. A few good lawns to lounge < n are
something every college campus needs, and the
Main Library lawn is becoming a bit crowded
these days. Grass between the eoncret" waii,
would also help eliminate the Quads \rahian
market-place aspects.
® Installation of outdoor classroom facilities
he considered. Several professors who would
like to hold open-air classes have complained
that no suitable place is within walking dis
tance. A small class area with benches sur
rounded by trees on Inner Quad would he an
interesting revival of Aristotle's Lvceui.i svsleni
of education.
In anv case, we are tired of dodging hicvcles.
