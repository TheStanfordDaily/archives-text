# The 						Finish Line

A Hope and a Prayer
Well, lei's start hoping hoping that the Indians don't play like
they did Saturday against Oregon State. Actually, there isn't much
reason to believe that they'll he that bad again. The record for the
year does show seven good performances against just the one "flat"
showing, plus the llice game, where a superior team won.
The trouble at Corvailis may have been overconfidence on tin
pan of the Tribe. At dinner, for example, the attitude seemed to
be that the game w;is already won. At the airport after the game,
Coach Chuck acknowledged that 1 his might have been a contribut
ing factor.
At any rate, there should be no cause for overconfidence against
the Bears. What with Cal's record of having beaten the Cards nine
limes since the war, it's evident that Stanford doesn't exactly control
the series.
Corvailis is without a doubt one of the most isolated football
lowns in existence. When our DC OB landed there, it was reportedly
Uic first time in three years that a four-engine plane had landed at
Ihe local airport. And then it took a bus ride over a dirt road to
gel on the highway to town.
The lienton Hotel? Well, not exactly the Shamrock-Hilton, but
on the other hand, riot bad for a town of 18,000. The town itself was
a real live-wire place kind of like something you'd find in the
middle of the Mojave Desert. Seemed like a rather odd place to
locate Oregon Slate College and its beautiful campus.
One thing about the OSC campus though they're really gung-ho
on the school colors of orange and black (Halloween Among
ihe things painted in those inspiring colors wore road blockades,
street signs and fire hydrants.
While we were at OSC, we stopped in at Gill Coliseum to see the
Beavers' basket bail team working out. Luckily enough, the first
and second strings were scrimmaging each other. Didn't look very
good, either. In seven minutes of play, the two teams scored a total
of II points, mostly on free throws. The shooting was infrequent
and inaccurate. And as per usual, forward Dave Ganibee, the modest
man of PCC basketball, stood with hands on hips whenever a team
mate didn't feed him the ball for a glory shot.
Another word on basketball Kruno IJoin, the hook-shooting cen
ter from Washington, will lay out this year. It's not grade 1 rouble,
1 hough. He just wants to wait until the Huskies are again eligible
for NCAA playoff action. The other Husky ace, Doug Smart!, will
play both this year and next. Boin may be a bit overconfident about
Washington getting into the playoffs in '59. Seems to me that Stan
ford will have the entire '58 team back the following year with a
Jot of darned good men on it.
The Word from Smoglaiul
Still lots of comment wending its way up here from Smogland
after the Tribe's 35-7 victory over IJSC. From Sid Ziff's column in
ihe Mirror-News:
Of all the college teams we've seen this season in the Coliseum,
Stanford looked the best. Yes, even stronger than Michigan.
Also:
Trojan fans were very unhappy with their team in the Stanford
game and no amount of explanations' will soothe them. They were
prepared to forgive anything except sloppy, sandlot tackling.
Unfortunately, /iff had to mess up another good column with
1 his typically-Southlandish comment:
The horrible massacre loss to UCLA in 1954] is believed
to have influenced Stanford's position in the PCC clean-up cru
sade.
Here's another interesting tidbit from an M-N report on Bruin j
frosh coach Johnny Johnson:
Hut Johnson's the big hero around Westwood today. He beat
Stanford . . . and that's good enough for Red Sanders.
Speaking of Handers, I thought sure it was he in the Oregon State
dressing room after Saturday's game. Turned out it was Tommy
Prothro, the Beaver coach. He's a carbon copy of Sanders if there i
ever was one—guess he should be. having been indoctrinated while j
serving as the Westwood mentor's assistant.
And a word on Stanford from Sanders, as said at a Nov. 11 L.A. !
football writers' meeting: "If all hands are in shape and ready to
play, the best PCC Rose Bowl representative would be Stanford."
Well, too bad.
MEMO TO SPORTS ILLUSTRATED—After seeing your mid-fall
cover piece and story on All-American (?) Bobby Cox, and after a
glance at last week's cover statement. "Why Oklahoma Is Unbeat
able," 1 hope Stanford doesn't make your cover for a long time.
