# Opening, Skits Put Life in Dull Gaieties Show
## "Chamberpot Music' Is Hilarious; Good Costuming Clads Bad Talent 
### Steve Baffrey 
Ram' . I kvul unveiled a cleverly costumed and designed 1957 Gaie
ties last night, hut the show just failed to measure up to expecta
tions. 'I'm borrow an old child's saying, "when it was good it was
very, very good, but when it was bad it was horrid."
Hut for the comic: artistry of Mark Hammer, as both a performer

and a writer, the hilariously fun-j
ny Chamberpot Music sketch and I
a skillfully done opening number,
Caieties, directed by Serguey
Kondratieff, appears to be noth
ing bul a compilation of a few
funny lines developed into a host
of too-long skits.
Noel Turner's costuming is one
of tho production's few high
lights. Turner creations grace
the opener, the Calypso number,
Mardi Gras Magic, the fashion
number which opens the second
act. and the traditional red and
white finale. His ideas are un
usual, and make for attractive
viewing.
This year's Gaieties orchestra
is better than usual, but director
John Miller and his 24 - piece
group have a long way to go.
Perhaps by Friday night they
will get together with the rest
of the cast.
Opens With a Hang
No doubt the funniest portion
of the show, and one of the fun
niest of recent years, is "Cham
berpot Music" which stars Ro
berta Grant, Jan Wilcox, Stan
Throneberry, Bert Berns and
Stan Ibler. Setting operatic arias
against Stanford songs turns out
to bo the brightest spot of the
show. The four performers and j
their pianist carry it off well.
Although it drags in parts, Big
Game Gaieties opens with a
bang. From a laugh-getting over
ture, arranged by Bob Christian
sen, to tlie well-staged, fast-mov
ing "Two for the Price of One,"
written by Dick Lamb, the show
has class. But here it bogs down.
Barbara Feldman sings the
Dianne White original, "Line:
Forms to the Right," and neither I

I
j the tune nor the artist adds a bit
jto the show. "Rock-'n'-Romeo"
features Lair Parent, Geri Wil
der and Hammer and is a take
off on the old "FBI in Peace and
War" radio series. The sketch
has a few very entertaining lines.
"One Cigarette," another num
ber written by Lamb, fulfills
about the same purpose as "Line
to the Right" and isn't much bet
ter. The "original" number
smacks of a tune, "Three Cigar
ettes in an Ashtray," which made
its appearance on the pop music
circuit this summer. Claudia An
dreasen sings the number with a
fair amount of feeling but doesn't
appear to be the right person for
the job.
"Mardi Gras Magic"
Stan Throneberry is the fea
tured vocalist in the Calypso
"Mardi Gras Magic" piece and
does well in the role. The seg
ment is staged with very effec
tive lighting, but should end with
Stan's number. The chorus and
dancers detract from the effect.
Voodoo dancers Leanne Boc
cardo and Lair Parent dance
what seems to be the product of
a nightmare and didn't have
much point. Without much help
I from the orchestra it seemed like
they were improvising as they
went along, and luckily managed
to come out of it at the same time
the orchestra did.
Only Turner's costumes high
light "That Certain Look," the
fashion number. The introduc
tion to the number is pointless,
and the female chorus, beautiful
I as the girls were, sounded like
: the Glamourlovelies from last
year.
Minor Riot
Hammer's light shines bright
est in the "Tea for Schmidt"
! sketch, and the whole thing,
; though long, is a minor riot.
"Mannequin" is a ballet sup-
I posedly originated by Gene Carl-
I son, but comes from a rather old
! Mata and Hari idea featured on
the Sid Caesar TV show some
years past. It, 100, is pointless
and dull.
A goodnatured spoof on peri
| odicals, "Tuesday Evening Seri
ous," provides a good vehicle for
) John Jordan, Evelyn Dees and
j Louise Mali, and the three turn
in fine performances.
"'The Intellectual Thief" is a
clever number, ending in a
"Down with Peanuts" musical
theme. Miller wrote the music to
the ditty, and Barney Gillmor
supplied the words.
Gaieties deletes the rah-rah fi
nale this year and goes in for
subtler things. Bring back the
rah-rah.
Gaieties has some good spots
in it —worth seeing at $1 a clip.

Hut for the comic: artistry of Mark Hammer, as both a performer

a skillfully done opening number,

Kondratieff, appears to be noth
ing bul a compilation of a few
funny lines developed into a host
of too-long skits.
Noel Turner's costuming is one
of tho production's few high
lights. Turner creations grace
the opener, the Calypso number,
Mardi Gras Magic, the fashion
number which opens the second
act. and the traditional red and
white finale. His ideas are un
usual, and make for attractive
viewing.
This year's Gaieties orchestra
is better than usual, but director
John Miller and his 24 - piece
group have a long way to go.
Perhaps by Friday night they
will get together with the rest
of the cast.
Opens With a Hang
No doubt the funniest portion
of the show, and one of the fun
niest of recent years, is "Cham
berpot Music" which stars Ro
berta Grant, Jan Wilcox, Stan
Throneberry, Bert Berns and
Stan Ibler. Setting operatic arias
against Stanford songs turns out
to bo the brightest spot of the
show. The four performers and j
their pianist carry it off well.
Although it drags in parts, Big
Game Gaieties opens with a
bang. From a laugh-getting over
ture, arranged by Bob Christian
sen, to tlie well-staged, fast-mov
ing "Two for the Price of One,"
written by Dick Lamb, the show
has class. But here it bogs down.
Barbara Feldman sings the
Dianne White original, "Line:
Forms to the Right," and neither I

I
j the tune nor the artist adds a bit
jto the show. "Rock-'n'-Romeo"
features Lair Parent, Geri Wil
der and Hammer and is a take
off on the old "FBI in Peace and
War" radio series. The sketch
has a few very entertaining lines.
"One Cigarette," another num
ber written by Lamb, fulfills
about the same purpose as "Line
to the Right" and isn't much bet
ter. The "original" number
smacks of a tune, "Three Cigar
ettes in an Ashtray," which made
its appearance on the pop music
circuit this summer. Claudia An
dreasen sings the number with a
fair amount of feeling but doesn't
appear to be the right person for
the job.
"Mardi Gras Magic"
Stan Throneberry is the fea
tured vocalist in the Calypso
"Mardi Gras Magic" piece and
does well in the role. The seg
ment is staged with very effec
tive lighting, but should end with
Stan's number. The chorus and
dancers detract from the effect.

features Lair Parent, Geri Wil
der and Hammer and is a take
off on the old "FBI in Peace and
War" radio series. The sketch
has a few very entertaining lines.
"One Cigarette," another num
ber written by Lamb, fulfills
about the same purpose as "Line
to the Right" and isn't much bet
ter. The "original" number
smacks of a tune, "Three Cigar
ettes in an Ashtray," which made
its appearance on the pop music
circuit this summer. Claudia An
dreasen sings the number with a
fair amount of feeling but doesn't
appear to be the right person for
the job.
"Mardi Gras Magic"
Stan Throneberry is the fea
tured vocalist in the Calypso
"Mardi Gras Magic" piece and
does well in the role. The seg
ment is staged with very effec
tive lighting, but should end with
Stan's number. The chorus and
dancers detract from the effect.
Voodoo dancers Leanne Boc
cardo and Lair Parent dance
what seems to be the product of
a nightmare and didn't have
much point. Without much help
I from the orchestra it seemed like
they were improvising as they
went along, and luckily managed
to come out of it at the same time
the orchestra did.
Only Turner's costumes high
light "That Certain Look," the
fashion number. The introduc
tion to the number is pointless,
and the female chorus, beautiful
I as the girls were, sounded like
: the Glamourlovelies from last
year.
Minor Riot
Hammer's light shines bright
est in the "Tea for Schmidt"
! sketch, and the whole thing,
; though long, is a minor riot.
"Mannequin" is a ballet sup-
I posedly originated by Gene Carl-
I son, but comes from a rather old
! Mata and Hari idea featured on
the Sid Caesar TV show some
years past. It, 100, is pointless
and dull.
A goodnatured spoof on peri
| odicals, "Tuesday Evening Seri
ous," provides a good vehicle for
) John Jordan, Evelyn Dees and
j Louise Mali, and the three turn
in fine performances.
"'The Intellectual Thief" is a
clever number, ending in a
"Down with Peanuts" musical
theme. Miller wrote the music to
the ditty, and Barney Gillmor
supplied the words.
Gaieties deletes the rah-rah fi

subtler things. Bring back the
rah-rah.
Gaieties has some good spots
in it —worth seeing at $1 a clip.
Ram' . I kvul unveiled a cleverly costumed and designed 1957 Gaie
ties last night, hut the show just failed to measure up to expecta
tions. 'I'm borrow an old child's saying, "when it was good it was
very, very good, but when it was bad it was horrid."
Hut for the comic: artistry of Mark Hammer, as both a performer

and a writer, the hilariously fun-j
ny Chamberpot Music sketch and I
a skillfully done opening number,
Caieties, directed by Serguey
Kondratieff, appears to be noth
ing bul a compilation of a few
funny lines developed into a host
of too-long skits.
Noel Turner's costuming is one
of tho production's few high
lights. Turner creations grace
the opener, the Calypso number,
Mardi Gras Magic, the fashion
number which opens the second
act. and the traditional red and
white finale. His ideas are un
usual, and make for attractive
viewing.
This year's Gaieties orchestra
is better than usual, but director
John Miller and his 24 - piece
group have a long way to go.
Perhaps by Friday night they
will get together with the rest
of the cast.
Opens With a Hang
No doubt the funniest portion
of the show, and one of the fun
niest of recent years, is "Cham
berpot Music" which stars Ro
berta Grant, Jan Wilcox, Stan
Throneberry, Bert Berns and
Stan Ibler. Setting operatic arias
against Stanford songs turns out
to bo the brightest spot of the
show. The four performers and j
their pianist carry it off well.
Although it drags in parts, Big
Game Gaieties opens with a
bang. From a laugh-getting over
ture, arranged by Bob Christian
sen, to tlie well-staged, fast-mov
ing "Two for the Price of One,"
written by Dick Lamb, the show
has class. But here it bogs down.
