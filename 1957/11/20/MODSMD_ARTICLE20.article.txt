While most of the fuss is about the Big Game Saturday, the Stan-:
ford cross-country team will jump the gun by throe days and hold ,
its Big Meet with California today at 4 p.m. on the Stanford golf
course.
The flu is still playing havoc with Coarh Payton Jordan's squad. |

The status of three men, Ernie
Cunliffe, Bob Monzingo and Nor
man Lloyd, is slill questionable,
and Bob McGuire is slill not up
1o par.
Improvement Necessary
Jordan said thai if the Indians
run like they did at San Jose last
week, they'll be in for a licking,
lie noted that even if some of (he
flu cases are ready to run, the

rest of the team will still have 1o i
improve on its recent showing.
Stanford's task will be to split
the Cal one - two punch of Bob
Price and Don Foster. Maury
Graves and Keith Wallace rate
the best chance of dividing lhc>
pair.
Indian Harriers
The rest of the Stanford con
tingent will include Doug Martin, j
A 1 Ahumada, Larry Suelzle, Al
Salcedo and Irv Nolle.
