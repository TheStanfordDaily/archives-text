# BRIEF MEETING
## Legislature Appropriates Funds to Rally Com, Flicks 
### Wally Simpson, Editor 
In a meeting last night conspic
uous for its brevity as much as
anything else, ASSU Legislature
voted, among other things, a
budgetary increase of $50 to Ral
ly Corn's Rallies Budget.
This extra money, taken from
the ASSU Contingency Fund, is
earmarked for Friday night's
rally in San Francisco—will help
pay the expenses for a small
"Pep" band.
Legislature also agreed to
i transfer $186.84 from the Con
tingency Fund to the Special AS
SU CinemaScope Equipment Pur
chasing Fund. It seems the spe
cial Flicks price had been re
duced before the equipment had
j been fully paid for.
In other action, Legislature ap
proved By-law changes for Ram's
] Head, the Quad and The Daily.

These were all carried unani
mously.
Legislature, however, rejected
By-law changes for Political Un
ion on the grounds that the office
of the administrative assistant,
as created by the changes, would
conflict with that of the vice-pres
ident. The rejection was by a
9-3 vote.
The parliamentary group also
rejected the Arab Club constitu
tion by a 9-2 vote, even though
By-laws Committee, by a vote of
4-1, recommended its passage.
The majority feeling of Legis
lature was that the constitution
was too vague as to intent in a
number of places. They felt that
the difference between "asso
ciate" and "honorary" members
was not. spelled out properly. The
amendment provision was also
unclear, they felt.
