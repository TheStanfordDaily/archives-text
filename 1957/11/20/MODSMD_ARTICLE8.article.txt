# Chappie Cover Excels Content; Never-Say-Die Boys Kill Jokes
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
As the garish red and white
cover posters now cluttering the
columns around Quad indicate,
the never • say • die boys of the
Chappie aro once again braving
the light of day to force a few
weary witticisms down our
throats.
We wouldn't want you to think
we dislike the cover of the Chap
pie's Big Game edition on the
contrary, as is often the case, the
cover seems to be the only thing
in the magazine worth even a
passing glance.
This glance can be had for free
by looking into any campus trash
barrel this afternoon. But for
those with 35 cents to squander
and a few minutes of boredom
to kill, a couple of items on the
inside are worthy of note. Like
the Old Boy's Big Game Queen,

Barbara Heed (as the Old Boy
grows older, his taste in queens
is improving).
The Chappies have managed to
fill the rest of the magazine with
assorted advertisements, cartoons,
| tried-and-true jokes and even an
honest-to-goodness article prov
ing that their literary abilities
are not limited to writing car
toon captions.
The article "The Loamy
Crowd' is billed as "a study of
behavioristic tendencies of Stan
ford students at Big Game time"
i and is easily the best thing in the
| magazine (you'll have to read the
rest of the issue to understand
I what we mean >.
Its author, apparently a lugi
j live from a sociology course,
delves deep into the surface of
I traditions and how they grow.
I Example: "In selecting a seat for
; Big Game, Sehapultapee again
! follows the example of his grand

father and sits in the card sec
tion."
The point of all this is to prove
that what was good enough for
Schapultapec's grandfather is
good enough for him. However,
it does not necessarily follow
that what's good enough for the
Chappie is . . . well, we leave it
to you.
Other timeless items in the
issue include a bogus "Letter
Home" from "Poopsic" (endear
ing appellation used by Chappie
staffers as a nickname for their
editor), in which the Chappies
doggedly pursue their adolescent
preoccupation with (blush) SEX.
Really, lads, humorous articles
have been written on other sub
jects!
But as we said, the cover is
nice. Talk about the shrinking
; value of the dollar why we can
i remember when 35 cents used to
I buy . . .

The article "The Loamy
Crowd' is billed as "a study of
behavioristic tendencies of Stan
ford students at Big Game time"
i and is easily the best thing in the
| magazine (you'll have to read the
rest of the issue to understand
I what we mean >.
Its author, apparently a lugi
j live from a sociology course,
delves deep into the surface of
I traditions and how they grow.
I Example: "In selecting a seat for
; Big Game, Sehapultapee again
! follows the example of his grand

father and sits in the card sec
tion."
The point of all this is to prove
that what was good enough for
Schapultapec's grandfather is
good enough for him. However,
it does not necessarily follow
that what's good enough for the
Chappie is . . . well, we leave it
to you.
Other timeless items in the
issue include a bogus "Letter
Home" from "Poopsic" (endear
ing appellation used by Chappie
staffers as a nickname for their
editor), in which the Chappies
doggedly pursue their adolescent
preoccupation with (blush) SEX.
Really, lads, humorous articles
have been written on other sub
jects!
But as we said, the cover is
nice. Talk about the shrinking
; value of the dollar why we can
i remember when 35 cents used to
I buy . . .
As the garish red and white
cover posters now cluttering the
columns around Quad indicate,
the never • say • die boys of the
Chappie aro once again braving
the light of day to force a few
weary witticisms down our
throats.
We wouldn't want you to think
we dislike the cover of the Chap
pie's Big Game edition on the
contrary, as is often the case, the
cover seems to be the only thing
in the magazine worth even a
passing glance.
This glance can be had for free
by looking into any campus trash
barrel this afternoon. But for
those with 35 cents to squander
and a few minutes of boredom
to kill, a couple of items on the
inside are worthy of note. Like
the Old Boy's Big Game Queen,

Barbara Heed (as the Old Boy
grows older, his taste in queens
is improving).
The Chappies have managed to
fill the rest of the magazine with
assorted advertisements, cartoons,
| tried-and-true jokes and even an
honest-to-goodness article prov
ing that their literary abilities
are not limited to writing car
toon captions.
