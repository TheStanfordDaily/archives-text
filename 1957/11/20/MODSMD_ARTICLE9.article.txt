# Debaters Disagree On U.S. Leadership
## SU, Cambridge Teams Contend In Tuesday Series Discussion 
### 
"The United States leads where it wants to lead, and it wants I"
lead the world," was one of the concluding statements of the neg-<
live side (Stanford) in last night's Cambridge-Stanford debate at
Memorial Auditorium.
The two British debaters took the affirmative side of the resoln

tion, "Has the United States Ycl
to Prove Her Capacity for World
Leadership?" in another of the
Tuesday Evening Series.
Because the debate was not
judged, and the audience had lit
tle lime to poll, neither side v/as
declared victorious. Chairman
Thomas Andrew Bailey, Byrne j
Professor of American History at
Stanford, stated that tlie choice of i
winner was left to each member j
of the near-capacity audience.
U.S. Has Failed
Cambridge's Ritchie Fairbairn |
began the debate with three main j
statements: the U.S., as an in
strument for providing world law |
and order, has failed; if law and !
order could be preserved in the!
world, the U.S. would have to be |
the country to preserve it; and
the U.S. hasn't shown itself ca
pable of enforcing the law.
Martin Lester O'Shea of Stan
ford answered these statements
by pointing out the relativity of i
Fairbairn's statements, and by j
concluding that leadership is not j
equal to policemanship. He went
on to say that because the U.S. !
is exerting world leadership, it
has capacity for it.
The affirmative side again took
over, with numerous sarcastic re
marks aimed at the negative.
James Neil Creighton-Miller in
troduced the idea that no law is
of any use without sanctions, and
the U.S. is the only one who can
apply sanctions. But the U.S.
doesn't apply sanctions; she only J
gives broad hints as to what she
will do, and then backs down.
Granted, she accepts her share,
but not more than her share.
U.S. Produces Leaders
Stanford's Oscar Wood Moyle
concluded the presentation of the
argument by emphasizing what
the U.S. has done in the way of
producing leaders in various war
and peace-time movements, and
what she is continuing to pro
duce.
Each speaker was given five j
minutes in which to rebut his op- i
ponent's arguments. Miller sug
gested that '"America is not in- j
terested in being the leader of
the world, because if she wants
to lead, she must have a mes-1
sage." By this, he referred to the
similarity of the American Con
stitution to the United Nations
Charter, and concluded that the
terms of equality, purpose, etc.,
haven't been furthered by the!
U.S.
