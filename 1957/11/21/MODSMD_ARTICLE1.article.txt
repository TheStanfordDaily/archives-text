# Mahon: U.S. 'Seriously Behind Russ'
## Texas Demo Charges Bad Lag in Missiles; Denied by Pentagon 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — Repre
sentative Mahon (D-Tex.) charged
last night that the United States
is "seriously behind" Russia in de
veloping an intermediate range
ballistic missile, but a Pentagon
expert said, "I don't believe so."
The disagreement was voiced
after Mahon's House Appropria
tions subcommittee launched a
surprise inquiry into the U.S.
weapons program and spent the
day taking testimony behind clos
ed doors.
"We've Lagged"
"We h av e lagged behind the
Russians in the intermediate
range ballistic missile, and we've
got to come from behind and come
abreast as soon as we can," Mahon
told newsmen. His subcommittee
handles all the Defense Depart
ment's money requests.
While disagreeing with Mahon's
assessment of the IRBM situation,
William Holaday, the Defense De
partment's missiles director, said
it might be true of the 5,000-mile
intercontinental ballistic missile.
May Be Behind
"Based on what they [the Rus
sians] said, maybe we are behind
them on the ICBM," Holaday con
ceded. He spoke with newsmen
after testifying at the closed-door
hearing.
The IRBM, with a range of
from 700 to 1,500 miles, is a key
weapon in current military plan
ning. It is generally considered
to be more advanced than the
ICBM and could be used to advan
tage from U.S. bases abroad.
Another serious problem, Ma
hon said, is the perfection of an
"anti-missile missile" to defend
the United States against enemy
ICBM's.
