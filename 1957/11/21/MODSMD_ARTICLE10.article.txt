# Rooters May Mix At Saturday Game
## 
### 
Big Game rooting section will
bo mixed, announced the Board
of Directors of Rally Com yester
day.
The board's decision was a re
sult of the consensus of campus
opinion to allow a mixed section
especially and solely for Big j
Game, the board said. Many stu
dents have guests for the week
end and the accompanying par
ties. Unrestricted seating for
rooters eliminates many prob
lems.
Cal reports past success with
Big Game mixed rooting sections.
