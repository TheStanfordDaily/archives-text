## 
### 
Henry Morgan, a freshman, ap
parently suffered a fractured an
kle last evening when he fell 40
feet from the Big Game Bonfire
scaffold in the dry bed of Lake
Lagunita. Witnesses said the aeci- !
dent happened at 5:48 p.m. His
condition was reported by the
Palo Alto Hospital as satisfactory.
About 25 freshmen were work
ing on the scaffold when the acci
dent occurred, but no one was
below Morgan when he fell, Doug
Brown, general chairman for the i
Bonfire, declared.
"The top crossbar of the scaf-;
folding was nailed on only one |
en d," an eyewitness declared. I
"Henry reached for it, and it gave i
way under his weight."
First aid was administered im- j
mediately, wit h an improvised
splint already in place on Mor
gan's ankle when the ambulance
arrived five minutes after the ac
cident. His landing on a pile of
springy boards probably helped to
break his fall, witnesses stated.
The accident did not hold up the |
building progress of the Bonfire, J
as crossbars continued to be nail-1
ed to the poles frame in advance |
of the stuffing with kindling.
