# Gaieties Plays Tonight, Friday
## 
### 
Big Game Gaieties which play
ed to a packed house last night—
will continue with its all-student
material and cast, through tomor
row night. The show consists of
21 acts.
Music for the humorous produc
tion is supplied by a 24-piece or
chestra, under the direction of
John Miller. Choreography is by
Leanne Boccardo and Lair Parent.
A cast of 70, including soloists,
dancers and specialists, has been
helped in the production by stu
dents of various departments.
The traditional Big Game show
includes acts ranging from take
offs of Shakespeare's "Romeo and
Juliet" to the Tuesday Evening
Series — the series which began
with the University in 1891.
The British do not escape the
campus wit, nor does opera. Even
the corner drug store becomes
combined with the talked-about
TV commercials to form a short
skit.
The two big numbers of the
show, as considered by the cast,
are the opener and "Mardi Gras
Magic." Voodoo and calypso rhy
thms are featured in the latter
number.
