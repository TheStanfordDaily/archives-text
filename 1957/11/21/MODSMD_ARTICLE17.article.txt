# Whence Comes Paint Smeared Over Campus?
## 
### 
Additional "decorations" have
appeared on or near the campus—
but they are not part of the Home
coming preparation.
The entrance gates on Palm
Drive, traffic signs, Quad columns
and Hoover Tower all appear to
be coming down with the measles,
thanks to some bright-red paint.
The big mystery is why the
words "Cal" and "Bear" would be
applied 1o campus structures with
red rather than blue paint. Even
the word "Stanford" was smeared
on Hoover Tower.
Officer Bert Herring spotted
the first signs of vandalism while
on patrol about 2 a.m. yesterday.
Other paint smears were discov
ered after daybreak. So far, po
lice have no idea who applied the
paint.
The ASSU and ASUC recently
signed a "non-aggression" pact in
which both schools agreed that
their members will not vandalize
each other and that disciplinary
action will be taken should such
acts occur.
A Stanford police spokesman
noted that "people from San Jose
to San Francisco usually get into
the act at Big Game time; unless
you catch the people, you just
can't accuse anyone high school,
.junior college, or four-year college
students."
