His will, dated Jan. 12, 1945, and
a codicil, dated March IT. 1948.
were filed for probate in San Ma
teo Superior Court Tuesday by
Almon E. Roth, nominated as ex
ecutor.
A campus figure for 51 years,
McDonald died Nov. 4 at the age
of 73.
He left some 430 acres of virgin
timberland near La Honda and a
company he had operated which
supplies water to an adjoining
subdivision.
Egerton D. Lakin, executor's
attorney, said the exact amount
of the estate will not be known
until an appraisal is completed.
Four persons received a total of
$850. The remainder of his estate
was divided between the Univer
sity, which will get two-thirds,
and the Convalescent Home.
