## 
### 
BEVERLY HILLS (/P)â€” A sci
entist said last night that Russi i
is far ahead of the United States
in collecting and distributing vi
tal information to its scientists.
F. Finley Carter, director of
Stanford Research Institute, add
ed in an address prepared for :i
meeting of the National Security
Industrial Association:
"For years it has been common
knowledge in this country thrii
the Russians have an elaborately
organized effort to obtain the
proceedings of our technical
presses, and to rush this informa
tion to the Soviet All-Union Insti
tute of Scientific and Technical
Information.
"Here, information is ana
lyzed. abstracted, elaborate! y
cross-indexed and distributed to
appropriate scientific personnel.
This is no leisurely operation,
carried on in bureaucratic sur
roundings. It is a continuous
crash program. It has paid off
by making available to Russian
scientists a vast storehouse of
scientific information which they
can retrieve at will.
"We in the United States have
no such effective facility for col
lecting and disseminating scien
tific information. In fact, the
Russian agency is so thorough
that a member of our own Na
tional Science Foundation has
stated that the most efficient and
authoritative means for improv
ing United States coverage of sei
entificf happenings is to translate
directly from the Russian Ab
stract Journal dealing with a par
ticular science."
"We must give immediate ;i!
tention," Carter said, "to Ihe
problem of upgrading our own
storehouse of scientific informa
tion. We should proceed quickly
to establish a facility for storing
and retrieving technical litera
ture from all over the world. We
must break down barriers to
cross - communication and idea
stimulation inherent in our cum
bersomc and complex security
system."
