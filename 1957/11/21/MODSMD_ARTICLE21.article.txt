Sxially Regimented Women
Editor, The Daily:
;.:vi»ig experienced Stanford's liberal policies
male residents for the past two months, we
i ,<* concluded that Ihese liberties are entirely
t i i-ii because they are not accompanied by
i mi'. I] v liberal regulations governing other areas,

commonly accepted "University usage," not nee.

oiriaohood") regimented with mechanical reg

it ha> been our experience while escorting

preclude any opportunity they might have for

realize the University must protect its charges,
!,;it at a supposedly liberal institution these

amount of social freedom.
Apparently the underlying cause of the lack
oI ' ocial freedom here at Stanford is the nebulous
"Kii ldainental Standard." Granted that courteous

i i-ty, it -(."ins to us wholly impractical and un

'iould wield sufficient influence to set Stanford
siiidenl apart socially from their contemporaries

fiee .'-.ocial experiences generally epitomized by
"college life."
Il.ning duly taken our vows and having re

process of living as well as learning. We believe

EoitOi'. The Daily:
ilh (iisma; we hav< noted that there has been
j> po-ilive reaction to l)ave Egger's column con
< ei ning i he desirability of allowing those who are
. : !Iv able in possess liquor on campus. We feel
uit in the past the mistake Stanford students
have made in this admirable endeavor is their
i itiet.inec to make a sacrifice in order to attain
la ir ends. Since there are obviously segments
i i the I'Diversity community which do not exael
r eon.- i(I' ud< ii1 drinking to be our inalienable
11 hi, ue inn I demonstrate our willingness to

them by a mature contractual arrangement of
some sort.
Though Mr. Egger did not mention the fact,
on at least one of the eastern campuses he re
ferred to, the students i in this case nil male)
were offered the choice of having booze or auto
mobiles. Needless to say, one cannot find a car
on that campus today.
It is therefore with dedication of purpose thai
we wish io make a modest proposal. We fully
realize that ihe geographical location in which
we find ourselves here at the Farm makes trans
portation quite a problem and poses severe hard
ships in many cases. A move similar to the one
taken at ihe aforementioned eastern school would
necessitate great effort on the part of adminis
tration and students alike. Aside from the obvi
ous limitation of student movement, there would
doubtless be complicated bicycle parking arrange
ments and perhaps even the need for off-campus
storage of cars.
To relinquish such a necessity would bo ri
diculous.
So, looking around us. with the realization thai
some expiatory arrangement must be made, we
finally came up with a satisfactory solution. And
thus it is with some remorse, but also with firm
intent, we suggest, for the privilege of having
booze on campus, thai sacrifice be made of the
Stanford women.

Regulate, Don"! Exclude Bikes
Editor, The Daily:
The increase in the number of bicycles on cam
pus indicates the need and use for them. Inner
Quad is not only the center of campus activity
but also the most convenient path for getting
from one class to another or from one side of
campus to the other, for pedestrians as well as
bicyclers. If bicycles really are a great incon
venience to those who do not ride Ihem, then
ihey should be regulated, not excluded. I sug
gest prohibiting bicycles under the archways. If
a bicycler must go under the archway, he should
walk his bike.
Bicycles are, I believe, irrelevant to the subject
of a tranquil Inner Quad.
Bicyclers have their own problems, too. Riding
bicycles in the streets around campus is as great
a danger as walking in the streets, perhaps more
so. Since sidewalks are taboo for bicycles, yet
ihe need for a safe path is great, I suggest bi
cycle paths alongside sidewalks. European coun
tries use these with success. They should border
ihe main streets and certainly such highways as
the road Io College Terrace.
