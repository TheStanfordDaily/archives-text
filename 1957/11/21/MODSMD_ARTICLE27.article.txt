Although California's Golden Bears have only been
able )o win one of nine football games this season, there
is nn reason lo make I hern the underdogs in 1 lie (>oth
1 iig (iarne Sat in <iay.
Pete Elliott's < lub is hampered by an inability to put
logo!her a continuous performance. One moment the
Bears look like champs, the next moment like a milling
group i,l c(jnt used gridders, as their offensive or defen
sive abiiity suddenly faliers.
However, in the past two games the Bears have been
able lo put things together more consistently, especially
on offense. Last week the Bears met Washington in a
high scoring, free-for-all battle which would have been
won by Oal if they had been more accurate in the pass
ing department. As it was, the Bears lost. 35-27, as the
Huskies picked off-four passes intended for Blue and
Gold receivers. Cal also contributed four fumbles, two
of which Washington recovered.
Koinped in Second Halt
In the Oregon State game two weeks ago, the Bears
completely dominated the second half as they outscored
ihe Beavers, 19-0. The game went to OSC, however, as
the Beavers had rolled to a 21-0 half-time lead.
The Bears' lone victory came against IJSC, 12-0. In ad
dition to the Huskies and Beavers, Cal has dropped

games to Southern Methodist, Washington State, Michi
gan State, Navy, Oregon and UCLA.
But the Bears have been tough in defeat. Michigan
State, the nation's number one team, had a hard time
in winning, 19-0. With the exception of the Oregon
game, which went to the Ducks 24-(5, Cal has not lost
a PCC game by more than two touchdowns. The major
ity of the losses were even closer.
Basically, the Bears operate from the split-T. although
Elliott has introduced many variations into the Bears'
attack. Cal has even used the single-wing a few times
this year.
Alternates Squads
Elliott also uses a two-platoon type system, in that he
has two teams which he interchanges depending on how
ihe team on the field is progressing.
The Bears have a strong backfield and a rather weak
line. The only line position at which the team excels
is end. Against Washington, the Berkeley line couldn't
solve the cross-blocking which the Huskies employed,
and in the first half of the OSC game the Cal line was
consistently outcharged.
Best players for Cal in the line are ends Ron Wheat
croft and Mike White. Wheatcroft's injury will hurt
the Bears. Center 'Perry Jones and guard Frank Sally
have shown improvement.
The standout in the backfield is quarterback Joe
Kapp, who did the damage against Stanford last year.
Kapp is an excellent passer, a hard runner and a fine
ball-handler in general. Kapp proved his ability as a
passer in the OSC game and threw fairly well against

the Huskies last week. In the last two games Kapp has
thrown 2K times and completed 13 for 245 yards and
three touchdowns.
Kapp's replacement, Gabe Arrillaga, runs the Cal sec
ond unit and is a fair passer and runner, but lacks ex
perience.
Most improved player in the Bear backfield is speedy
left hall Ilank Olguin. who gave the Huskies tits all
day. Darrell Roberts, behind Olguin, is a fast runner
and shares punting and P.A.T. kicking duties with Kapp.
Two speedsters hold down the right half spot—Jack
Hart and Jack Yerman. Hart is a hard runner, while
Yerman, who performs on the Bear track leam, is dan
gerous on wide plays.
The weakest position in the backfield is fullback. Art
Forbes and John .Stewart share this position.
* npredcitabie
The Bears are as unpredictable defensively as they are
offensively. The Cal pass defense is fair, but the line
leaks like a sieve when the opposition sends runners
through.
Summing up: Cal may have a 1-8 record, but they
are a tough club nevertheless. They show great spirit
and determination to win, but they make costly mis
takes. They are an on-and-off team, and if they jell
against Stanford, it will be a long afternoon for Stan
ford fans. Cal will pass a great deal in the Big Game,
and Kapp can do great damage this way. The Bears'
great defensive disadvantage is their inability to stop
thrusts through the line. Outside of the Bears' first
two teams, reserves are weak.

Kapp is an excellent passer, a hard runner and a fine
ball-handler in general. Kapp proved his ability as a
passer in the OSC game and threw fairly well against

the Huskies last week. In the last two games Kapp has
thrown 2K times and completed 13 for 245 yards and
three touchdowns.
Kapp's replacement, Gabe Arrillaga, runs the Cal sec
ond unit and is a fair passer and runner, but lacks ex
perience.
Most improved player in the Bear backfield is speedy
left hall Ilank Olguin. who gave the Huskies tits all
day. Darrell Roberts, behind Olguin, is a fast runner
and shares punting and P.A.T. kicking duties with Kapp.
Two speedsters hold down the right half spot—Jack
Hart and Jack Yerman. Hart is a hard runner, while
Yerman, who performs on the Bear track leam, is dan
gerous on wide plays.
The weakest position in the backfield is fullback. Art
Forbes and John .Stewart share this position.
* npredcitabie
The Bears are as unpredictable defensively as they are
offensively. The Cal pass defense is fair, but the line
leaks like a sieve when the opposition sends runners
through.
Summing up: Cal may have a 1-8 record, but they
are a tough club nevertheless. They show great spirit
and determination to win, but they make costly mis
takes. They are an on-and-off team, and if they jell
against Stanford, it will be a long afternoon for Stan
ford fans. Cal will pass a great deal in the Big Game,
and Kapp can do great damage this way. The Bears'
great defensive disadvantage is their inability to stop
thrusts through the line. Outside of the Bears' first
two teams, reserves are weak.

Although California's Golden Bears have only been

is nn reason lo make I hern the underdogs in 1 lie (>oth

Pete Elliott's < lub is hampered by an inability to put
logo!her a continuous performance. One moment the
Bears look like champs, the next moment like a milling
group i,l c(jnt used gridders, as their offensive or defen
sive abiiity suddenly faliers.
However, in the past two games the Bears have been
able lo put things together more consistently, especially
on offense. Last week the Bears met Washington in a
high scoring, free-for-all battle which would have been
won by Oal if they had been more accurate in the pass
ing department. As it was, the Bears lost. 35-27, as the
Huskies picked off-four passes intended for Blue and
Gold receivers. Cal also contributed four fumbles, two
of which Washington recovered.
Koinped in Second Halt
In the Oregon State game two weeks ago, the Bears
completely dominated the second half as they outscored
ihe Beavers, 19-0. The game went to OSC, however, as
the Beavers had rolled to a 21-0 half-time lead.
The Bears' lone victory came against IJSC, 12-0. In ad
dition to the Huskies and Beavers, Cal has dropped

games to Southern Methodist, Washington State, Michi
gan State, Navy, Oregon and UCLA.
But the Bears have been tough in defeat. Michigan
State, the nation's number one team, had a hard time
in winning, 19-0. With the exception of the Oregon
game, which went to the Ducks 24-(5, Cal has not lost
a PCC game by more than two touchdowns. The major
ity of the losses were even closer.
Basically, the Bears operate from the split-T. although
Elliott has introduced many variations into the Bears'
attack. Cal has even used the single-wing a few times
this year.
Alternates Squads
Elliott also uses a two-platoon type system, in that he
has two teams which he interchanges depending on how
ihe team on the field is progressing.
The Bears have a strong backfield and a rather weak
line. The only line position at which the team excels
is end. Against Washington, the Berkeley line couldn't
solve the cross-blocking which the Huskies employed,
and in the first half of the OSC game the Cal line was
consistently outcharged.
Best players for Cal in the line are ends Ron Wheat
croft and Mike White. Wheatcroft's injury will hurt
the Bears. Center 'Perry Jones and guard Frank Sally
have shown improvement.

In the Oregon State game two weeks ago, the Bears
completely dominated the second half as they outscored
ihe Beavers, 19-0. The game went to OSC, however, as
the Beavers had rolled to a 21-0 half-time lead.
The Bears' lone victory came against IJSC, 12-0. In ad
dition to the Huskies and Beavers, Cal has dropped

games to Southern Methodist, Washington State, Michi
gan State, Navy, Oregon and UCLA.
But the Bears have been tough in defeat. Michigan
State, the nation's number one team, had a hard time
in winning, 19-0. With the exception of the Oregon
game, which went to the Ducks 24-(5, Cal has not lost
a PCC game by more than two touchdowns. The major
ity of the losses were even closer.
Basically, the Bears operate from the split-T. although
Elliott has introduced many variations into the Bears'
attack. Cal has even used the single-wing a few times
this year.
Alternates Squads
Elliott also uses a two-platoon type system, in that he
has two teams which he interchanges depending on how
ihe team on the field is progressing.
The Bears have a strong backfield and a rather weak
line. The only line position at which the team excels
is end. Against Washington, the Berkeley line couldn't
solve the cross-blocking which the Huskies employed,
and in the first half of the OSC game the Cal line was
consistently outcharged.
Best players for Cal in the line are ends Ron Wheat
croft and Mike White. Wheatcroft's injury will hurt
the Bears. Center 'Perry Jones and guard Frank Sally
have shown improvement.
The standout in the backfield is quarterback Joe
Kapp, who did the damage against Stanford last year.
Kapp is an excellent passer, a hard runner and a fine
ball-handler in general. Kapp proved his ability as a
passer in the OSC game and threw fairly well against

the Huskies last week. In the last two games Kapp has
thrown 2K times and completed 13 for 245 yards and
three touchdowns.
Kapp's replacement, Gabe Arrillaga, runs the Cal sec
ond unit and is a fair passer and runner, but lacks ex
perience.
Most improved player in the Bear backfield is speedy
left hall Ilank Olguin. who gave the Huskies tits all
day. Darrell Roberts, behind Olguin, is a fast runner
and shares punting and P.A.T. kicking duties with Kapp.
Two speedsters hold down the right half spot—Jack
Hart and Jack Yerman. Hart is a hard runner, while
Yerman, who performs on the Bear track leam, is dan
gerous on wide plays.
The weakest position in the backfield is fullback. Art
Forbes and John .Stewart share this position.
* npredcitabie
The Bears are as unpredictable defensively as they are
offensively. The Cal pass defense is fair, but the line
leaks like a sieve when the opposition sends runners
through.
Summing up: Cal may have a 1-8 record, but they
are a tough club nevertheless. They show great spirit
and determination to win, but they make costly mis
takes. They are an on-and-off team, and if they jell
against Stanford, it will be a long afternoon for Stan
ford fans. Cal will pass a great deal in the Big Game,
and Kapp can do great damage this way. The Bears'
great defensive disadvantage is their inability to stop
thrusts through the line. Outside of the Bears' first
two teams, reserves are weak.
