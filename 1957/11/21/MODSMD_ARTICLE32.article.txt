# Cal Whips Harriers, 25-30
## 
### 
Don Foster overhauled Stan
ford's Keith Wallace in a long
stretch battle to lead the Cali
fornia cross-country runners to a
tight 25-30 victory over the In
dians yesterday on the golf
I course.
Foster, who was seco n d
through most of the race, set a
| new course record of 21:21. Wal
lace was clocked in 21:2(5 to equal
' his own Stanford record and the
old course mark.
Stanford was in good shape
; through the first mile of the four
mile test, but then Cal's depth
[ began to toll as Maynard Orme,
I Clark Maddox and Roger Price
! all moved up.
Doug Martin ran one of his
| best races in taking third for the
I Cards with a 21:33 clocking. But
j perhaps the best showing was by
i Norman Lloyd, who came out of
J sick bay to place seventh for
i Stanford.
He'd been laid up for a week
, with the flu. but didn't let it both
er him as he staged a driving
J finish to best teammate Maury
I Graves.
I Graves was the principal dis
: appointment for Stanford. He
was an early leader, and still a
I close third at the mile and one
half post, but faltered on ihe mid
course hills and fell far back.
Larry Suelzle ran a good race
j in placing 10th for the Cards, and
. Warren Wood ran his best of ihe
season to come in 14th. A 1 Ahu
! mada, in 15th, was the seventh
| Indian.
The win gave Cal a 2-1 lead
, over Stanford in 1957 meets.
