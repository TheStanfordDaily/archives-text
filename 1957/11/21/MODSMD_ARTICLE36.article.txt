## Council Acquits Four On Drinking Violation 
### 
Charges against seven Stan
ford men of drunkenness, posses
sion of liquor, drinking and un
gentlemanly conduct at a campus
football game were recently in
vestigated by Men's Council.
Four of the defendants were ac
quitted.
Of the remaining three defend
ants, the Council decided that
only one (who had pleaded
guilty) had been drunk or objec
tionably boisterous. He was sus
pended from school until the end
of this quarter and placed on pro
bation until June.
One of the other two defend
ants had brought a liquor bottle
to the game and was found
guilty of drinking and possession
of liquor on campus. He was
placed on probation until June
and was assigned 20 hours of
work in the corporation yard (to
be completed by the end of win
ter quarter).
The third student was also
found guilty of drinking and pos
session of liquor on campus.
Since he had apparently not
brought any liquor to the game,
he was placed on probation until
the end of this quarter, and was
also required to complete, by the
end of winter quarter, 20 hours
of work in the corporation yard.
A $25 ticket for driving on In
ner Quad was recently appealed
to Men's Council by a Stanford
student. The student admitted
that he had been driving on In
ner Quad at night during the
last full moon, but appealed on
grounds of inconsistent enforce
ment.
The student testified that on
the night he was arrested he saw
a policeman, different than the
one who had ticketed him, talk
ing to the drivers of two other
cars on Inner Quad, but that nei
ther of these were given tickets.
The student was cited for driv
ing on Inner Quad with his lights
off. He testified that he had been

parked, and that he had driven
only a few feet before turning on
his lights.
The council decided that, al
though all students driving on
Quad at night under a full moon
are not treated consistently, and
although there is no consistently
enforced, written rule against
driving on Inner Quad except for
signs saying: '"Do not enter, ex
cept Saturdays and Sundays,"
students should be discouraged
from driving on Quad.
The Council turned the case
over to Dean of Men William
Craig in the hope that clear poli
cies regarding driving on Quad,
the establishment of fines and
ticketing would be developed.
