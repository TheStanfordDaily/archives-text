## Caucus Talk Stresses Major Party Decisions 
### Neal Rosenberg 
Dr. T. J. Kreps of the Business School spoke on "Democrats at
the Crossroads" at the Democratic Caucus of the Stanford Political
Union yesterday afternoon in Bowman Alumni House.
Dr. Kreps' talk concerned the four major decisions facing the
Democratic Party today.
"The Democratic Party has got to make up its mind if it is going

to be a national party with na- j
tional interests," stated Dr. Kreps.;
He explained that the party is !
composed to some degree of dissi-:
dent groups and that its success
will depend upon the same sort ]
of party unity as Franklin Roose-!
velt was able to inspire.
He also felt (hat the Northern !
Democrats would have to expel
the Southern Democrats from thoi
party if they expected I heir party
to become one of national rather
than sectional interests.
Several Crossroads
Foreign policy is a second cross- j
roads for the Democratic party, i
Dr. Kreps feels. He wonders if
the party will meet the challenge
and return to the Woodrow Wil
son-Cordell Hull programs of free
trade and support of the United
Nations or if it. will remain split
on these issues.
"In the domestic issues of labor
and civil rights the Democrats arc
at the crossroads," Dr. Kreps ex
plained.
Expressing a dislike for thej
II ou s e Un-American Activities |
Committee, tho professor stated I
that the party should seek to dis-!
solve that committee, for he feels i
that the amount of bad it has done \
far outweighs the good it has ac-1
complished. He also feels that the I
Democrats should take a firm I
stand against proposed "right-to- â– 
work" laws.
Challenge of Future
The last problem the Democrats
are up against, Dr. Kreps feels, is (
finding what is in the future. The
party must find an economic pro-1
gram which meets the challenge!
of the future, not the past, he ex-;
plained.
To illustrate this need, he point
ed out that during the last session
of Congress the Democrats were
just hunting for issues to help
draw the line between the two I
parties. He does not feel this pol
icy is right or that it will win
elections.
