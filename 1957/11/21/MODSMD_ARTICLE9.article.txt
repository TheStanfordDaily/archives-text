j dents.

tion to the band, will be the song

Gary Van Galder and Jack Doug
las, past varsity captains, alumni
president John R. White, Prince
Lightfoot, fireworks and the fi
nale—the Bonfire.
Stanford's Class of 1981 has
made all the arrangements for the
Bonfire.
Bear Bust
Following the fire, the senior
class will sponsor a "Bear Bust"
at Rossotti's until midnight. Set
ting the tempo will be Lew Ter
man's jazz band. Refreshments j
will include beer, hot dogs and
soft drinks.
The Big Game rally in San
Francisco will get under way to
morrow night at 10:30 instead of
9:30 as was previously announced.
This spontaneous rally will be in :
Union Square at the corner of
Post and Powell Streets.
Oil Donated
For tonight's Bonfire the Class !
of '61 has had no trouble in get-!
ting assistance. To make the fire
burn brighter, the Shell and Cook
oil companies have donated oil.
Pacific Gas & Electric Company i
drove in 50-foot utility poles to j
hold the piles of wood. Stanford 112
Police Department has donated ]
men to help guard the wood, and 1
a spotlight for the lake bed as j
well as a fire truck for the guards j
has been at the lake since Tues-1
day.
Men from Wilbur started guard
ing the fire Tuesday and will con
tinue to guard it until freshman
president Lee Gentry lights it to
night.
Oskie
Branner women are making the |
"Oskie" for the top of the com- j
bustible woodpile, and Rob lei
women served coffee to the cold I
and hungry guards last night at i
8:30 and 10:30.
Many of this year's precautions j

regarding the Bonfire are a result
of last year's experiences when j
the fire was set off prematurely. !
Early in the week a group ofj
Menlo College men tried unsuc
cessfully to set the fire by charg
ing the line of Stanford guards '
in a pickup truck.
As it turned out, the only thing '

destroyed by fire was the Menlo
students' pickup. Gasoline intend
ed for the woodpile was spilled on
the truck and was ignited when a
defending Stanford freshman
threw a flaming stick on it.
The woodpile itself went up in
smoke early Thursday morning,
apparently from an incendiary
bomb placed in it unbeknownst to
the guards. Needless to say, the
freshmen had a substantial new
woodpile in place by nightfall, so
that the Bonfire—almost as large
as the original — went off on
schedule.


BONFIRE TAKES SHAPE—Higher and higher
goes the woodpile for tonight's bonfire at Lake
Lagunita. The Pacific Gas and Electric- Com
pany drove in 50-foot utility poles to confine the

large supply of tinder gathered by the freshman
class. II was from this high "temporary build
ing" that freshman Henry Morgan fell 40 feet
yesterday suffering a possible fractured ankle.

BONFIRE TAKES SHAPE—Higher and higher
goes the woodpile for tonight's bonfire at Lake
Lagunita. The Pacific Gas and Electric- Com
pany drove in 50-foot utility poles to confine the

large supply of tinder gathered by the freshman
class. II was from this high "temporary build
ing" that freshman Henry Morgan fell 40 feet
yesterday suffering a possible fractured ankle.

The sparks will fly above Lagunita lakebed tonight as the annual
Big Game Bonfire crackles amidst the cheers of hundreds of stu
j dents.
Festivities will begin at 7 in front of Wilbur Hall as the Stanford
Band strikes up spirited marches while leading a parade toward La-

gunita. The rally in Lagunita will
begin at 7:30.
Featured in the rally, in addi
tion to the band, will be the song
and yell leaders, the Glee Club,
coach Chuck Taylor, co-captains
Gary Van Galder and Jack Doug
las, past varsity captains, alumni
president John R. White, Prince
Lightfoot, fireworks and the fi
nale—the Bonfire.
Stanford's Class of 1981 has
made all the arrangements for the
Bonfire.
Bear Bust
Following the fire, the senior
class will sponsor a "Bear Bust"
at Rossotti's until midnight. Set
ting the tempo will be Lew Ter
man's jazz band. Refreshments j
will include beer, hot dogs and
soft drinks.
The Big Game rally in San
Francisco will get under way to
morrow night at 10:30 instead of
9:30 as was previously announced.
This spontaneous rally will be in :
Union Square at the corner of
Post and Powell Streets.
Oil Donated
For tonight's Bonfire the Class !
of '61 has had no trouble in get-!
ting assistance. To make the fire
burn brighter, the Shell and Cook
oil companies have donated oil.
Pacific Gas & Electric Company i
drove in 50-foot utility poles to j
hold the piles of wood. Stanford 112
Police Department has donated ]
men to help guard the wood, and 1
a spotlight for the lake bed as j
well as a fire truck for the guards j
has been at the lake since Tues-1
day.
Men from Wilbur started guard
ing the fire Tuesday and will con
tinue to guard it until freshman
president Lee Gentry lights it to
night.
Oskie
Branner women are making the |
"Oskie" for the top of the com- j
bustible woodpile, and Rob lei
women served coffee to the cold I
and hungry guards last night at i
8:30 and 10:30.
Many of this year's precautions j

regarding the Bonfire are a result
of last year's experiences when j
the fire was set off prematurely. !
Early in the week a group ofj
Menlo College men tried unsuc
cessfully to set the fire by charg
ing the line of Stanford guards '
in a pickup truck.
As it turned out, the only thing '

destroyed by fire was the Menlo
students' pickup. Gasoline intend
ed for the woodpile was spilled on
the truck and was ignited when a
defending Stanford freshman
threw a flaming stick on it.
The woodpile itself went up in
smoke early Thursday morning,
apparently from an incendiary
bomb placed in it unbeknownst to
the guards. Needless to say, the
freshmen had a substantial new
woodpile in place by nightfall, so
that the Bonfire—almost as large
as the original — went off on
schedule.
