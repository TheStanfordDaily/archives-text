# '57 BIG GAME IS LAST FOR COACH CHUCK
## Indians One-TD Favorites, But.., 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
A final coaching victory for,
Chuck Taylor and repossession of
the Axe will be twin goals tomor
row w hen Stanford and California
meet in the Big Game.
More than 90.000 fans are ex
period to till Stanford Stadium for
the 1 :,30 p.m. kickoff.
For Taylor the game will mark
the finale of his seven-year coach
ing career at Stanford. It was
announced yesterday afternoon
that Taylor would move up to the
post of assistant director of ath
letics next February.
Stanford enters the 60th Big
(lame as a one-touchdown favo
rite. but anyone who has followed
the game knows that to name a
favorite is folly.
Why folly? Because it's the
Big (lame the one grime where
the record book goes down the
drain and where the impossible is
the commonplace.
There is probably a reasonable
basis for tin Indians' favoritism
if one is foolish enough to go on
the record. The Cards have won
five times against four losses this
year, w hile the Berkeley crew has
managed only one victory against
eight setbacks.
Stanford also holds the upper
hand in most of the statistics,
both team and individual. The In
dians have gained 07.") yards more
than the Bears; they've allowed
opponents 2(50 yards fewer than
Cal's foes.
Individually, Chuck Shea and
Jack Douglas rank above Cat's
best runners and passers.
But these facts won't mean a
thing along about 1:30 tomorrow
afternoon. Then they'll be .just 22
men on the field. And. in the tra
dition of Big Game, they'll be as
evenly matched as 22 men can be.
Taylor has announced a starting
lineup which includes 10 seniors.

Ile'll lead with Dick Stein and co
captain Gary Van Galder at ends;
Armand DeWeese and John Kidd
at tackles; John Clark and Noel
Robinson at guards; Russ Steele
at center; Jack Douglas at quar
ter back; Jeri McMillin and Jack
Taylor at halfbacks; and Chuck
Shea at fullback.
Steele is the only junior start
ing for the Tribe; the Indians
don't have any senior centers.
On paper, the game stacks up
as an offensive battle all the way.
Stanford has scored at least three
touchdowns in all but two games
this year. The Bears have shown
offensive spark in the last two
contests, getting 19 points in the
second half against Oregon State
and 27 last week against Wash
ington.
Both clubs have been spotty.
Stanford, for example, played 5G
minutes of great football against
Washington State and then blew
