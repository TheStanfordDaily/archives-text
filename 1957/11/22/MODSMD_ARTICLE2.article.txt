# '57 BIG GAME IS LAST FOR COACH CHUCK
## Indians One-TD Favorites, But.., 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
A final coaching victory for,
Chuck Taylor and repossession of
the Axe will be twin goals tomor
row w hen Stanford and California
meet in the Big Game.
More than 90.000 fans are ex
period to till Stanford Stadium for
the 1 :,30 p.m. kickoff.
For Taylor the game will mark
the finale of his seven-year coach
ing career at Stanford. It was
announced yesterday afternoon
that Taylor would move up to the
post of assistant director of ath
letics next February.
Stanford enters the 60th Big
(lame as a one-touchdown favo
rite. but anyone who has followed
the game knows that to name a
favorite is folly.
Why folly? Because it's the
Big (lame the one grime where
the record book goes down the
drain and where the impossible is
the commonplace.
There is probably a reasonable
basis for tin Indians' favoritism
if one is foolish enough to go on
the record. The Cards have won
five times against four losses this
year, w hile the Berkeley crew has
managed only one victory against
eight setbacks.
Stanford also holds the upper
hand in most of the statistics,
both team and individual. The In
dians have gained 07.") yards more
than the Bears; they've allowed
opponents 2(50 yards fewer than
Cal's foes.
Individually, Chuck Shea and
Jack Douglas rank above Cat's
best runners and passers.
But these facts won't mean a
thing along about 1:30 tomorrow
afternoon. Then they'll be .just 22
men on the field. And. in the tra
dition of Big Game, they'll be as
evenly matched as 22 men can be.
Taylor has announced a starting
lineup which includes 10 seniors.

Ile'll lead with Dick Stein and co
captain Gary Van Galder at ends;
Armand DeWeese and John Kidd
at tackles; John Clark and Noel
Robinson at guards; Russ Steele
at center; Jack Douglas at quar
ter back; Jeri McMillin and Jack
Taylor at halfbacks; and Chuck
Shea at fullback.
Steele is the only junior start
ing for the Tribe; the Indians
don't have any senior centers.
On paper, the game stacks up
as an offensive battle all the way.
Stanford has scored at least three
touchdowns in all but two games
this year. The Bears have shown
offensive spark in the last two
contests, getting 19 points in the
second half against Oregon State
and 27 last week against Wash
ington.
Both clubs have been spotty.
Stanford, for example, played 5G
minutes of great football against
Washington State and then blew
the game in the final four min
u IPS.
Cal generally has been a one
h.'tlf team. Early in the season
iliey made a habit of starting fast
and folding up in the later stages.
The secret of success for Cal
could be an aerial game. Stan
ford's pass defense has blown hoi
and cold usually cold. Against
i CI,A ihe Indian defenders were
a I their best. Against Oregon and
OSC they were at their poorest.
In Joe Kapp, coach Pete El
liott's Bears have a thrower who
could cause the Indians trouble.
Kapp was I ho big man for Cal
last year when they upset Stan
ford, 20-18.
Opponents of California have
seemed to achieve the greatest!

success on the ground. And Stan
ford has the runners who can
cause the Berkeley squad fits.
Chuck Shea, Jim Byrer, Jeri
, McMillin, Jack Taylor and Rick
McMillen all have done a yeoman
job this year. Sorely missed will
be A 1 Harrington, who broke his
1 jaw against Southern California
i after playing a vital role in Stan
ford fortunes through the first
seven games.
Injury-wise, the Indians are in
good shape, with the exception of
Harrington. John Thomas has re
ceived doctors' approval to play at
his center slot, after a bout with
I mononucleosis. Jack Taylor's
I strained leg muscles have re
sponded to treatment so that he's
ready to go all out. Troy Barbee,
bothered with knee troubles, is
! also ready to roll.

California's main problem in the
infirmary end of things is end
Ron Wheatcroft. He was hurt
against Washington and will prob
ably make only a token appear
a nee.
Sixteen Stanford men will be i
making the final appearances of
their grid careers. Fourteen are !
set to play, with only Harrington :
and Lou Valli out of action. Valli J
was hurt against Northwestern,
never rbturned to full strength
and so was operated on several I
weeks ago.
And for Chuck Taylor the game
will be graduation also. One win, I
one tie and four losses have come !
his way in ihe Big Game. Stan- i
ford is confident he will bow out ;
as Indian coach with two Big
Game victories to his credit.
