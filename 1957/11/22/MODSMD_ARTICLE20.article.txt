Stanford i !oa< •lies
CHUCK TAYLOR, Stanford
head football coach: Wo should
win. However, it will take the
best possible football to come out
on lop there is no easy way.
This has been a fine week of prac
tice, and I rhink our kids are
ready.
GFORGE LYNN, Stanford as
sistant football coach: 'litis Big
Game is like all the rest in the
fact that no prediction can bo
made. I think we are just as high
and ready as'Cal. This'is espe
cially true of the ,seniors.
PETE KMETOV1C, Stanford as
sistant football coach: The defen
sive play is what will decide the
game. As for a prediction, mine
would be: Cal ID, Stanford 27.
DUTCH FEIIR1NG, Stanford
assistant football coach: r don't
think either team should bo fa
vored. Anything can happen in
this game, which should see much
scoring. The team which makes
the fewest mistakes will win.
IIERM MEIKTKR, Stanford as
sistant football coach: If, we play
the ball that we are capable of,
we should win. Both teams will
ho high for this one, but 1 think
we have a few nunc weapons than
Cal. If Stanford is up the most
mentally, tlieu we will win.
KOlt t.HILOITI, Stanford as
sistant fool ball coach: I'.kIIi loams
are hungry lor a win; however,
I'll go along with our seniors. I
know they have the determina
tion and desire to finish their col
lege careers with ;i Hi;-, Game win
over Cal.
FETE ELLIOTT, California
head t'o/dball coach: in meeting
Stanford in the Big Game Satur
day, California will be facing one
of the best - balanced offensive
teams in the United Stales. The
Indians have an extremely versa
tile attack, led by Ihe passing ol
quarlerhaek .lackio 1 >«»u;■ 1 as and
I lie runnin.!: of fullback ('buck
Shea.
However, we also are confident
that the 19:>7 California team will
play up to the finest standards of
the I5ig Game. While wo are un
derdogs, we roeogni/.o that any
thing can happen in the Big Game
which, 1<» me, is the most unique
rivalry in college football. The 1 >ig
Game is without question one of
football's classic games, and wo at
California tin coaches and play
ers alike are proud t<,> bo a pari
of it.
ROD FRANZ, C il'jIWniu assist

is different from any other foot
ball contest in the nation. 1 nave
learned that you can seldom de
pend upon favorites; that the
oddsmakers are more often wrong
lhan right; that the unpredictable
usually prevails; and that, above
all, il is football at its finest play

ed by Iwo of< the greatest instit u-1
tions in the country.
BUCK McPHAIL, California as
sistant football coach: In my opin
ion, the California vs. Stanford
football game is very definitely
one of the great games played in
the nation today. As you know,
last Thursday evening all of the
California and Stanford coaches
were invited to attend Big Game
Night at t ho Bohemian Club. It
was truly significant that all of
the people feel a very keen in
terest and desire, and to me this
is what makes a real thrilling and
traditional football game.
,1 O II N RALSTON, California
assistant football coach: Having
been associated with Big Game
directly and indirectly for the past
10 years, I firmly believe this will
bo the equal of any for thrills, en
joyment and solid team play. The
game is always :i toss-up, and this
year is certainly no exception. Our
California team is ready to go all
out for this one, and 1 predict a
victory.

C IJRLY GRIEVE, sports editor,
San Francisco Examiner: Stan
ford looks like the winner, 21-20.
Yup, 1 he Injuns are going to kick
llnee PAT's. California's reserve
strength puts it up there close,
hut Chuck Shea's running is
something the Bears don't have.
HON SELBY, San Francisco Ex
aminer, former sports editor of
The Daily: Stanford by 7. Indian
offense too much lor sputlering
j Hears.
PRESCOTT SULLIVAN, San
I Francisco Fxiunincr: Stanford by
6 points. Cal is too much an ama
teur team to s t a n d a chance
against the 49ers' most productive
farm club (Albert, Stanley, Van
| 1 )ooche, Brodie, et a I.).
WILL C ONNOLLY, San Fran
cisco Chronicle: 1 am picking Cal
Shy one TD bechuse they have im
proved at the second half of last
two games. Maybe part of it is
inspired by Pete Elliott's plight.
DICK FRIENDLICH, San Fran
cisco Chronicle: I figure ii about
27-13 for our side [Stanford]. Aft
er all, I have to stick with the old
I Alma Mater. I think Stanford has
| too many good runnPrs. Cal is a
little too slow particularly in the
secondary. Cal doesn't have a
passing game as good as some
that the Indians have seen 1 his
season.

JACK IF DOUGLAS, co-captain
and quarterback: We all feel
ready for the game—it's a big one.
T o d a y's | yesterday's] practice
was the sharpest one of the sea
son.
GARY VAN GALDFR, co-cap
tain and end: We'll do our very
best to win it.
BOB PETERSON, guard: It
sure would be fitting to win it for
Chuck, to give him something to
remember us Cal is strong;
they've really been hurt by breaks
this year. It'll be a good game.
TROY BARBEE, tackle: Cal
will be fired up and will play their
best game. To beat"them we're
gonna have to play our best one.
They've beat themselves before,
but it's gonna take us to do it this
time.
,IFRI McMILLIN, halfback: We
are going to win it. 1 wish we had
A! [Harrington] with us. They're
good no doubt about it but we
will do it.
CHRIS BURFORD, end: Chuck
Taylor's loss is a disappointment.
We'll be keyed. I never underesti
mate Cal.
NOFL ROBINSON, guard: If
wo play our best game, it won't
he a contest. If we take quick
command, it's ours. Cal's multiple
offense is Iricky, but we'll be
more than ready for it.
ERIC PROTIVA, tackle: It'll

be one of the toughest games of
the year, and it's gonna take a
33-man effort to win it. We'll need
—and will be looking for—lots of
support from the rooters. We're
gonna do it.
JIM BYRER, fullback: I hope
we win it for him |Coach Taylor|.
The team is "up." The seniors'll
kill themselves if they have to.
808 NEWMAN, WSC quar
terback: I think Stanford has
a superior ball club, both offen
sively and defensively. The only
basis I have for this opinion is in
our games with the two schools,
but in playing us I felt Stanford
played much better ball than Cal.
Stanford has a better offensive
in both personnel and coaching.
Don Ellingsen [Washington end]
also expressed my opinion that
Stanford should win, so good luck.
JOEL FREIS, end: Cal's record
is not indicative of the competi
tion. Stanford has lots of ability
on the team and is waiting for an
all-out effort to trounce 'em. We'll
get lots of pleasure from it.
JOHN CLARK, guard: We'll be
"up" more than last year. They're
a good team, but we'll knock the
hell out of 'em. We proved we can
be beaten when we're down, but
we won't be this time.
DON DAWSON, guard: It'll be
a good contest; we're "up."

TROY BARBEE, tackle: Cal

NOFL ROBINSON, guard: If

more than ready for it.
ERIC PROTIVA, tackle: It'll

be one of the toughest games of

33-man effort to win it. We'll need

DICK FRIENDLICH, San Fran

27-13 for our side [Stanford]. Aft

little too slow particularly in the
secondary. Cal doesn't have a
passing game as good as some
that the Indians have seen 1 his

Chuck, to give him something to

they've really been hurt by breaks
this year. It'll be a good game.
TROY BARBEE, tackle: Cal
will be fired up and will play their

They've beat themselves before,

will do it.
CHRIS BURFORD, end: Chuck
Taylor's loss is a disappointment.
We'll be keyed. I never underesti

NOFL ROBINSON, guard: If
wo play our best game, it won't

offense is Iricky, but we'll be
more than ready for it.
ERIC PROTIVA, tackle: It'll

be one of the toughest games of
the year, and it's gonna take a
33-man effort to win it. We'll need
—and will be looking for—lots of
support from the rooters. We're
gonna do it.
JIM BYRER, fullback: I hope
we win it for him |Coach Taylor|.
The team is "up." The seniors'll
kill themselves if they have to.
808 NEWMAN, WSC quar

a superior ball club, both offen
sively and defensively. The only
basis I have for this opinion is in
our games with the two schools,
but in playing us I felt Stanford
played much better ball than Cal.
Stanford has a better offensive
in both personnel and coaching.
Don Ellingsen [Washington end]
also expressed my opinion that
Stanford should win, so good luck.
JOEL FREIS, end: Cal's record
is not indicative of the competi

on the team and is waiting for an
all-out effort to trounce 'em. We'll
get lots of pleasure from it.
JOHN CLARK, guard: We'll be

sively and defensively. The only
basis I have for this opinion is in
our games with the two schools,
but in playing us I felt Stanford
played much better ball than Cal.
Stanford has a better offensive
in both personnel and coaching.
Don Ellingsen [Washington end]
also expressed my opinion that
Stanford should win, so good luck.
JOEL FREIS, end: Cal's record
is not indicative of the competi
tion. Stanford has lots of ability
on the team and is waiting for an
all-out effort to trounce 'em. We'll
get lots of pleasure from it.
JOHN CLARK, guard: We'll be
"up" more than last year. They're
a good team, but we'll knock the
hell out of 'em. We proved we can
be beaten when we're down, but
we won't be this time.
DON DAWSON, guard: It'll be
a good contest; we're "up."

CHUCK TAYLOR, Stanford
head football coach: Wo should
win. However, it will take the
best possible football to come out
on lop there is no easy way.
This has been a fine week of prac

ready.
GFORGE LYNN, Stanford as
sistant football coach: 'litis Big
Game is like all the rest in the
fact that no prediction can bo
made. I think we are just as high
and ready as'Cal. This'is espe
cially true of the ,seniors.
PETE KMETOV1C, Stanford as
sistant football coach: The defen
sive play is what will decide the
game. As for a prediction, mine
would be: Cal ID, Stanford 27.
DUTCH FEIIR1NG, Stanford
assistant football coach: r don't
think either team should bo fa
vored. Anything can happen in
this game, which should see much
scoring. The team which makes
the fewest mistakes will win.
IIERM MEIKTKR, Stanford as
sistant football coach: If, we play
the ball that we are capable of,
we should win. Both teams will
ho high for this one, but 1 think
we have a few nunc weapons than
Cal. If Stanford is up the most
mentally, tlieu we will win.
KOlt t.HILOITI, Stanford as
sistant fool ball coach: I'.kIIi loams
are hungry lor a win; however,
I'll go along with our seniors. I
know they have the determina

over Cal.
FETE ELLIOTT, California
head t'o/dball coach: in meeting
Stanford in the Big Game Satur
day, California will be facing one
of the best - balanced offensive
teams in the United Stales. The
Indians have an extremely versa
tile attack, led by Ihe passing ol
quarlerhaek .lackio 1 >«»u;■ 1 as and
I lie runnin.!: of fullback ('buck

However, we also are confident
that the 19:>7 California team will
play up to the finest standards of
the I5ig Game. While wo are un

thing can happen in the Big Game
which, 1<» me, is the most unique
rivalry in college football. The 1 >ig
Game is without question one of
football's classic games, and wo at
California tin coaches and play

of it.
ROD FRANZ, C il'jIWniu assist

is different from any other foot

BUCK McPHAIL, California as
sistant football coach: In my opin
ion, the California vs. Stanford
football game is very definitely
one of the great games played in
the nation today. As you know,
last Thursday evening all of the
California and Stanford coaches
were invited to attend Big Game
Night at t ho Bohemian Club. It
was truly significant that all of
the people feel a very keen in

is what makes a real thrilling and
traditional football game.
,1 O II N RALSTON, California

directly and indirectly for the past
10 years, I firmly believe this will
bo the equal of any for thrills, en

something the Bears don't have.
HON SELBY, San Francisco Ex
aminer, former sports editor of
The Daily: Stanford by 7. Indian
offense too much lor sputlering

PRESCOTT SULLIVAN, San

6 points. Cal is too much an ama

against the 49ers' most productive

WILL C ONNOLLY, San Fran

DICK FRIENDLICH, San Fran

27-13 for our side [Stanford]. Aft

secondary. Cal doesn't have a
passing game as good as some
that the Indians have seen 1 his

Chuck, to give him something to
remember us Cal is strong;
they've really been hurt by breaks
this year. It'll be a good game.
TROY BARBEE, tackle: Cal
will be fired up and will play their
best game. To beat"them we're

They've beat themselves before,

We'll be keyed. I never underesti

NOFL ROBINSON, guard: If

offense is Iricky, but we'll be
more than ready for it.
ERIC PROTIVA, tackle: It'll

be one of the toughest games of

33-man effort to win it. We'll need
