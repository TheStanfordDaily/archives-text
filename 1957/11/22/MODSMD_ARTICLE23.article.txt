# NEATEST ROBBERY PRIOR TO BRINKS CASE
## The 						Axe: SU Spirit, Big Game, Immortal 21; Daring Men, Honored for Stealing Symbol! 
### David Egger 
Of all the symbols of tradilion
at Stanford University, Hie best
known and best loved is the Axo,
the Stanford Axe. The Axe is
Stanford spirit immortalized in
metal. The Axe is Big Game and
the Immortal Twenty,-one.
In April, 1930, 21 stalwart Stan
ford men crowned three years of
tedious planning with one of the
neatest robberies prior to the
Brinks Case. The Axe returned
to Stanford after an absence of
31 years. The whole Peninsula
went mad with excitement. San
Francisco newspapers headlined,
"AXE RETURNED." Thus the
Stanford Immortal Twenty-one
became heroes in a non - heroic
age.
The theft was executed with
audacity and dash thai would
have done credit to Odysseus and
crew. Under the lutelage of Don
Kropp, 1he2l waiterl and watched
for opportunity. They patrolled
1he Berkeley eam|;:t> foi a year,
noting the behavior and customs
of the' Califoj mans. W.:en the;
right time I i < mo, they knew
it, and :-j11 uel. • il ) > -litning.
On Their > boulders.
On ihe morning of April 3,
H939, three ears rolled out from
1hc Stanford Farm, headed for
Berkeley. In one ear, a rented
black Buiek roadster, sat the five
key men upon whose shoulders
rested success or failure.
Arl Miller can ied what ap
peared to he a camera: in reality
a box with an ink bottle Jens,
loaded not wilh film but with a
homemade tear gas bomb. On
his lap Warren Gage lovingly
cradled a container of flash pow
der. The men in the cars were
dressed in typical California fash
ion: dirty blue jeans, open shirts.
They knew thai 1hoir presence
would not be doieeted.
At Cal's Greek Theater, 1hc
Axe Rally was in progress. The
Axe, having been carefully re
moved from its bank vault under
armed guard, was carefully
guarded by several large careful
Cal men. No one was taking any
chances.
But the 21 knew that success
was to be I heirs. So confident
were they thai entering Berkeley
they had jeered at policemen,
hurling catcalls ant! obscene opi
1hots. But their California dis
guise led no one to suspect any
thing out of the ordinary.
Burning' Broom
Arriving, they .joined into the
enthusiasm of the rally. Big Har
old Avery, moved by the ceremo
nies, waved a burning broom as
the crowd intoned the California
hymn, but the plotters were not
undone.
Unnoticed the five left the ral
ly. Parking the- roadster in a stra
tegic position before Ihe First
Berkeley Branch of the Ameri
can Trust, they awaited the ar
rival of the Axe-bearing armored
car.
Everything wont according to
schedule: there was no tenseness,
only anticipation of the deed's
success.
The armored car, bearing driv
er, guard, Axe and Cal student
Norm Horner, pulled up before
1he bank. Horner had that day
assumed offiee as custodian of
1hc Axe. His tenure was to be
{short lived.
The Stanford "camera men"
drove back the crowd. "Smile for
the picture,' shouted Warren
Gage, pointing hi pseudo-camera
at the unwitting Berkeley boy.
Norm smiled and in a second
Howard Aver\ wrenched the Axe
from his hand.
Not in Sight
Enraged Califomians surged in
to forestall disaster, but POSH!
the flash powder ignited in their
faces. When f sight returned the
Axe wa nowhere to be seen.
Boh I 'Hill ■ iiirinv, talcing the
Axe from Avr , Iih ked i! neatly
underneath his shirl and walked
casually, disinterestedly back to
the car.
"The Axe is gone!" "They've
Stolen the Axe!" "Kill Stanford!"
went up cries from Ihe crowd.
"To the Campanile, let's organ
ize," shouted an enterprising

'Stanfordite, and the Berkeleyites
began to disperse in all direc
tions. By this time the Axe was
indeed gone, speeding at 80 miles
an hour back to its rightful
home. For its pains the mob re
ceived only Art Miller's deftly
tossed tear gas bomb. But all the
tears in Berkeley that day were
not chemical.
The Stanford Axe, first stolen
by Cal students on its maiden ap
pearance at a baseball game in
1899, had finally returned. And
unlike Cal's theft, Stanford won
back t he Axo without the nefari
ous aid of the weaker sex.
Brute Force
When Cal men stole the Axe in
'99, they did it by brute, unthink
ing force. Al the end of the game
which Stanford- lost — Cal's
Paul Castlethum yanked it out of
Cal l Iiayden's hands and ran. In
a scuffle, Stanford's hurdler,
Frank St rout, recovered the Axe
and headed out. But Jimmy Hop
per, ('nl's off season quarterback,
j threw a flying tackle and Stan-
Stanford students made a final
attempt to recover the Axo at I he
! Oakland ferry. Police were in
j structed to search everyone. But
I the Axe-bearing Cal student spot
led a girl he knew, purchased
! two tickets. Arm in arm the two
strode on board: the Axe con-1
j cealed somewhere about their :
j persons.
Hack on the Farm
With l he Axe back on the
Farm, students agreed that it
should remain here. The Immor
tal Twenty-one feared that open
display of the Axe might incite
riots, but they expressed the hope i
that it should be displayed to the j
student body at least once a year. J
The 21 voted unanimously that
the Axe should not be established
as a trophy for winning the Big
Game. The Daily's front-page ed
itorial pointed out 1hat it was
only common sense that we
should retain possession of 1he
Axe henceforth. After all, it's our
Axe.
But Cal would not have it. The
executive manager of Ihe UC
alumni organization vowed that
Cal would get back the Axe if it
took a hundred years. The Axe
disappeared again in 1933 and the
university administrations step
ped in to end the fun.
Big Game Symbol
The Axe, turning up once more,
I officially became the symbol of
1 Big Game victory. The nonag-
I gression pact between Cal and

Stanford was inaugurated be
tween the respective student bod
ies. It was the beginning of an
other great tradition.
What sort of men were the 21?
In 1955, the 25th anniversary of
the return of the Axe, James
Trimmingham, who piloted the

legendary Buick roadster, char
acterized them. He called them
"average loyal Stanford men,
who would rather play a lousing
game of touch tackle than attend
an extracurricular discussion ol"
a technical subject."
None of the group was a var

sity athlete, but "we were all ath
letes at heart." In recognition of
his achievement, each of th<> Im
mortal" Twenty-one was awarded
a varsity letter.
California has the Axe today.
But tomorrow may bring, a dif
ferent story.

homemade tear gas bomb. On
his lap Warren Gage lovingly
cradled a container of flash pow
der. The men in the cars were
dressed in typical California fash
ion: dirty blue jeans, open shirts.
They knew thai 1hoir presence
would not be doieeted.
At Cal's Greek Theater, 1hc
Axe Rally was in progress. The
Axe, having been carefully re
moved from its bank vault under
armed guard, was carefully
guarded by several large careful
Cal men. No one was taking any
chances.
But the 21 knew that success
was to be I heirs. So confident
were they thai entering Berkeley
they had jeered at policemen,
hurling catcalls ant! obscene opi
1hots. But their California dis
guise led no one to suspect any
thing out of the ordinary.
Burning' Broom
Arriving, they .joined into the
enthusiasm of the rally. Big Har
old Avery, moved by the ceremo
nies, waved a burning broom as
the crowd intoned the California
hymn, but the plotters were not
undone.
Unnoticed the five left the ral
ly. Parking the- roadster in a stra
tegic position before Ihe First
Berkeley Branch of the Ameri
can Trust, they awaited the ar
rival of the Axe-bearing armored
car.
Everything wont according to
schedule: there was no tenseness,
only anticipation of the deed's
success.
The armored car, bearing driv
er, guard, Axe and Cal student
Norm Horner, pulled up before
1he bank. Horner had that day
assumed offiee as custodian of
1hc Axe. His tenure was to be
{short lived.
The Stanford "camera men"
drove back the crowd. "Smile for
the picture,' shouted Warren
Gage, pointing hi pseudo-camera
at the unwitting Berkeley boy.
Norm smiled and in a second
Howard Aver\ wrenched the Axe
from his hand.
Not in Sight
Enraged Califomians surged in
to forestall disaster, but POSH!
the flash powder ignited in their
faces. When f sight returned the
Axe wa nowhere to be seen.
Boh I 'Hill ■ iiirinv, talcing the
Axe from Avr , Iih ked i! neatly
underneath his shirl and walked
casually, disinterestedly back to
the car.
"The Axe is gone!" "They've
Stolen the Axe!" "Kill Stanford!"
went up cries from Ihe crowd.
"To the Campanile, let's organ
ize," shouted an enterprising

'Stanfordite, and the Berkeleyites
began to disperse in all direc
tions. By this time the Axe was
indeed gone, speeding at 80 miles
an hour back to its rightful
home. For its pains the mob re
ceived only Art Miller's deftly
tossed tear gas bomb. But all the
tears in Berkeley that day were
not chemical.
The Stanford Axe, first stolen
by Cal students on its maiden ap
pearance at a baseball game in
1899, had finally returned. And
unlike Cal's theft, Stanford won
back t he Axo without the nefari
ous aid of the weaker sex.
Brute Force
When Cal men stole the Axe in
'99, they did it by brute, unthink
ing force. Al the end of the game
which Stanford- lost — Cal's
Paul Castlethum yanked it out of
Cal l Iiayden's hands and ran. In
a scuffle, Stanford's hurdler,
Frank St rout, recovered the Axe
and headed out. But Jimmy Hop
per, ('nl's off season quarterback,
j threw a flying tackle and Stan-
Stanford students made a final
attempt to recover the Axo at I he
! Oakland ferry. Police were in
j structed to search everyone. But
I the Axe-bearing Cal student spot
led a girl he knew, purchased
! two tickets. Arm in arm the two
strode on board: the Axe con-1
j cealed somewhere about their :
j persons.
Hack on the Farm
With l he Axe back on the
Farm, students agreed that it
should remain here. The Immor
tal Twenty-one feared that open
display of the Axe might incite
riots, but they expressed the hope i
that it should be displayed to the j
student body at least once a year. J
The 21 voted unanimously that
the Axe should not be established
as a trophy for winning the Big
Game. The Daily's front-page ed
itorial pointed out 1hat it was
only common sense that we
should retain possession of 1he
Axe henceforth. After all, it's our
Axe.
But Cal would not have it. The
executive manager of Ihe UC
alumni organization vowed that
Cal would get back the Axe if it
took a hundred years. The Axe
disappeared again in 1933 and the
university administrations step
ped in to end the fun.
Big Game Symbol
The Axe, turning up once more,
I officially became the symbol of
1 Big Game victory. The nonag-
I gression pact between Cal and

Stanford was inaugurated be
tween the respective student bod
ies. It was the beginning of an
other great tradition.
What sort of men were the 21?
In 1955, the 25th anniversary of
the return of the Axe, James
Trimmingham, who piloted the

legendary Buick roadster, char
acterized them. He called them
"average loyal Stanford men,
who would rather play a lousing
game of touch tackle than attend
an extracurricular discussion ol"
a technical subject."
None of the group was a var

sity athlete, but "we were all ath
letes at heart." In recognition of
his achievement, each of th<> Im
mortal" Twenty-one was awarded
a varsity letter.
California has the Axe today.
But tomorrow may bring, a dif
ferent story.


THE "IMMORTAL TWENTY ONE" STOLE AXE FROM BERKELEY BANK IN 1930
Of all the symbols of tradilion

went mad with excitement. San
Francisco newspapers headlined,
"AXE RETURNED." Thus the
Stanford Immortal Twenty-one
became heroes in a non - heroic

the picture,' shouted Warren
Gage, pointing hi pseudo-camera
at the unwitting Berkeley boy.
Norm smiled and in a second
Howard Aver\ wrenched the Axe
from his hand.
Not in Sight
Enraged Califomians surged in
to forestall disaster, but POSH!
the flash powder ignited in their
faces. When f sight returned the
Axe wa nowhere to be seen.
Boh I 'Hill ■ iiirinv, talcing the
Axe from Avr , Iih ked i! neatly
underneath his shirl and walked
casually, disinterestedly back to
the car.
"The Axe is gone!" "They've
Stolen the Axe!" "Kill Stanford!"
went up cries from Ihe crowd.
"To the Campanile, let's organ
ize," shouted an enterprising

'Stanfordite, and the Berkeleyites
began to disperse in all direc
tions. By this time the Axe was
indeed gone, speeding at 80 miles
an hour back to its rightful
home. For its pains the mob re
ceived only Art Miller's deftly
tossed tear gas bomb. But all the
tears in Berkeley that day were
not chemical.
The Stanford Axe, first stolen
by Cal students on its maiden ap
pearance at a baseball game in
1899, had finally returned. And
unlike Cal's theft, Stanford won
back t he Axo without the nefari
ous aid of the weaker sex.
Brute Force
When Cal men stole the Axe in
'99, they did it by brute, unthink
ing force. Al the end of the game
which Stanford- lost — Cal's
Paul Castlethum yanked it out of
Cal l Iiayden's hands and ran. In
a scuffle, Stanford's hurdler,
Frank St rout, recovered the Axe
and headed out. But Jimmy Hop
per, ('nl's off season quarterback,
j threw a flying tackle and Stan-
Stanford students made a final
attempt to recover the Axo at I he
! Oakland ferry. Police were in
j structed to search everyone. But
I the Axe-bearing Cal student spot
led a girl he knew, purchased
! two tickets. Arm in arm the two
strode on board: the Axe con-1
j cealed somewhere about their :
j persons.
Hack on the Farm
With l he Axe back on the
Farm, students agreed that it
should remain here. The Immor
tal Twenty-one feared that open
display of the Axe might incite
riots, but they expressed the hope i
that it should be displayed to the j
student body at least once a year. J
The 21 voted unanimously that
the Axe should not be established
as a trophy for winning the Big
Game. The Daily's front-page ed
itorial pointed out 1hat it was
only common sense that we
should retain possession of 1he
Axe henceforth. After all, it's our
Axe.
But Cal would not have it. The
executive manager of Ihe UC
alumni organization vowed that
Cal would get back the Axe if it
took a hundred years. The Axe
disappeared again in 1933 and the
university administrations step
ped in to end the fun.
Big Game Symbol
The Axe, turning up once more,
I officially became the symbol of
1 Big Game victory. The nonag-
I gression pact between Cal and

Stanford was inaugurated be
tween the respective student bod
ies. It was the beginning of an
other great tradition.
What sort of men were the 21?
In 1955, the 25th anniversary of
the return of the Axe, James
Trimmingham, who piloted the

legendary Buick roadster, char
acterized them. He called them
"average loyal Stanford men,
who would rather play a lousing
game of touch tackle than attend
an extracurricular discussion ol"
a technical subject."
None of the group was a var

sity athlete, but "we were all ath
letes at heart." In recognition of
his achievement, each of th<> Im
mortal" Twenty-one was awarded
a varsity letter.
California has the Axe today.
But tomorrow may bring, a dif
ferent story.


THE "IMMORTAL TWENTY ONE" STOLE AXE FROM BERKELEY BANK IN 1930
Of all the symbols of tradilion
at Stanford University, Hie best
known and best loved is the Axo,
the Stanford Axe. The Axe is
Stanford spirit immortalized in
metal. The Axe is Big Game and
the Immortal Twenty,-one.
In April, 1930, 21 stalwart Stan
ford men crowned three years of
tedious planning with one of the
neatest robberies prior to the
Brinks Case. The Axe returned
to Stanford after an absence of
31 years. The whole Peninsula
went mad with excitement. San
Francisco newspapers headlined,
"AXE RETURNED." Thus the
Stanford Immortal Twenty-one
became heroes in a non - heroic
age.
The theft was executed with
audacity and dash thai would
have done credit to Odysseus and
crew. Under the lutelage of Don
Kropp, 1he2l waiterl and watched

On ihe morning of April 3,
H939, three ears rolled out from
1hc Stanford Farm, headed for
Berkeley. In one ear, a rented
black Buiek roadster, sat the five
key men upon whose shoulders
rested success or failure.
Arl Miller can ied what ap
peared to he a camera: in reality
a box with an ink bottle Jens,
loaded not wilh film but with a
homemade tear gas bomb. On
his lap Warren Gage lovingly
cradled a container of flash pow
der. The men in the cars were
dressed in typical California fash
ion: dirty blue jeans, open shirts.
They knew thai 1hoir presence
would not be doieeted.
At Cal's Greek Theater, 1hc
Axe Rally was in progress. The
Axe, having been carefully re
moved from its bank vault under
armed guard, was carefully
guarded by several large careful
Cal men. No one was taking any
chances.
But the 21 knew that success
was to be I heirs. So confident
were they thai entering Berkeley
they had jeered at policemen,
hurling catcalls ant! obscene opi
1hots. But their California dis
guise led no one to suspect any
thing out of the ordinary.
Burning' Broom
Arriving, they .joined into the
enthusiasm of the rally. Big Har
old Avery, moved by the ceremo
nies, waved a burning broom as
the crowd intoned the California
hymn, but the plotters were not
undone.
Unnoticed the five left the ral
ly. Parking the- roadster in a stra
tegic position before Ihe First
Berkeley Branch of the Ameri
can Trust, they awaited the ar
rival of the Axe-bearing armored
car.
Everything wont according to
schedule: there was no tenseness,
only anticipation of the deed's
success.
The armored car, bearing driv
er, guard, Axe and Cal student
Norm Horner, pulled up before
1he bank. Horner had that day
assumed offiee as custodian of
1hc Axe. His tenure was to be
{short lived.

Frank St rout, recovered the Axe
and headed out. But Jimmy Hop

Stanford students made a final
attempt to recover the Axo at I he

Hack on the Farm
With l he Axe back on the
Farm, students agreed that it
should remain here. The Immor
tal Twenty-one feared that open
display of the Axe might incite
riots, but they expressed the hope i
that it should be displayed to the j
student body at least once a year. J
The 21 voted unanimously that
the Axe should not be established
as a trophy for winning the Big
Game. The Daily's front-page ed
itorial pointed out 1hat it was
only common sense that we
should retain possession of 1he
Axe henceforth. After all, it's our
Axe.
But Cal would not have it. The
executive manager of Ihe UC
alumni organization vowed that
Cal would get back the Axe if it
took a hundred years. The Axe
disappeared again in 1933 and the
university administrations step
ped in to end the fun.
Big Game Symbol
The Axe, turning up once more,
I officially became the symbol of

other great tradition.

In 1955, the 25th anniversary of
the return of the Axe, James
Trimmingham, who piloted the

legendary Buick roadster, char
acterized them. He called them
"average loyal Stanford men,
who would rather play a lousing
game of touch tackle than attend
an extracurricular discussion ol"
a technical subject."
None of the group was a var

sity athlete, but "we were all ath

THE "IMMORTAL TWENTY ONE" STOLE AXE FROM BERKELEY BANK IN 1930
Of all the symbols of tradilion
at Stanford University, Hie best
known and best loved is the Axo,
the Stanford Axe. The Axe is
Stanford spirit immortalized in
metal. The Axe is Big Game and
the Immortal Twenty,-one.
In April, 1930, 21 stalwart Stan
ford men crowned three years of
tedious planning with one of the
neatest robberies prior to the
Brinks Case. The Axe returned
to Stanford after an absence of
31 years. The whole Peninsula
went mad with excitement. San
Francisco newspapers headlined,
"AXE RETURNED." Thus the
Stanford Immortal Twenty-one
became heroes in a non - heroic
age.
The theft was executed with
audacity and dash thai would
have done credit to Odysseus and
crew. Under the lutelage of Don
Kropp, 1he2l waiterl and watched
for opportunity. They patrolled
1he Berkeley eam|;:t> foi a year,
noting the behavior and customs
of the' Califoj mans. W.:en the;
right time I i < mo, they knew
it, and :-j11 uel. • il ) > -litning.
On Their > boulders.
On ihe morning of April 3,
H939, three ears rolled out from
1hc Stanford Farm, headed for
Berkeley. In one ear, a rented
black Buiek roadster, sat the five
key men upon whose shoulders
rested success or failure.
Arl Miller can ied what ap
peared to he a camera: in reality
a box with an ink bottle Jens,
loaded not wilh film but with a
homemade tear gas bomb. On
his lap Warren Gage lovingly
cradled a container of flash pow
der. The men in the cars were
dressed in typical California fash
ion: dirty blue jeans, open shirts.
They knew thai 1hoir presence
would not be doieeted.
At Cal's Greek Theater, 1hc
Axe Rally was in progress. The
Axe, having been carefully re
moved from its bank vault under
armed guard, was carefully
guarded by several large careful
Cal men. No one was taking any
chances.
But the 21 knew that success
was to be I heirs. So confident
were they thai entering Berkeley
they had jeered at policemen,
hurling catcalls ant! obscene opi
1hots. But their California dis
guise led no one to suspect any
thing out of the ordinary.
Burning' Broom
Arriving, they .joined into the
enthusiasm of the rally. Big Har
old Avery, moved by the ceremo
nies, waved a burning broom as
the crowd intoned the California
hymn, but the plotters were not
undone.
Unnoticed the five left the ral
ly. Parking the- roadster in a stra
tegic position before Ihe First
Berkeley Branch of the Ameri
can Trust, they awaited the ar
rival of the Axe-bearing armored
car.
Everything wont according to
schedule: there was no tenseness,
only anticipation of the deed's
success.
The armored car, bearing driv
er, guard, Axe and Cal student
Norm Horner, pulled up before
1he bank. Horner had that day
assumed offiee as custodian of
1hc Axe. His tenure was to be
{short lived.
The Stanford "camera men"
drove back the crowd. "Smile for
the picture,' shouted Warren
Gage, pointing hi pseudo-camera
at the unwitting Berkeley boy.
Norm smiled and in a second
Howard Aver\ wrenched the Axe
from his hand.
Not in Sight
Enraged Califomians surged in
to forestall disaster, but POSH!
the flash powder ignited in their
faces. When f sight returned the
Axe wa nowhere to be seen.
Boh I 'Hill ■ iiirinv, talcing the
Axe from Avr , Iih ked i! neatly
underneath his shirl and walked
casually, disinterestedly back to
the car.
"The Axe is gone!" "They've
Stolen the Axe!" "Kill Stanford!"
went up cries from Ihe crowd.
"To the Campanile, let's organ
ize," shouted an enterprising

'Stanfordite, and the Berkeleyites
began to disperse in all direc
tions. By this time the Axe was
indeed gone, speeding at 80 miles
an hour back to its rightful
home. For its pains the mob re
ceived only Art Miller's deftly
tossed tear gas bomb. But all the
tears in Berkeley that day were
not chemical.
The Stanford Axe, first stolen
by Cal students on its maiden ap
pearance at a baseball game in
1899, had finally returned. And
unlike Cal's theft, Stanford won
back t he Axo without the nefari
ous aid of the weaker sex.
Brute Force
When Cal men stole the Axe in
'99, they did it by brute, unthink
ing force. Al the end of the game
which Stanford- lost — Cal's
Paul Castlethum yanked it out of
Cal l Iiayden's hands and ran. In
a scuffle, Stanford's hurdler,
Frank St rout, recovered the Axe
and headed out. But Jimmy Hop
