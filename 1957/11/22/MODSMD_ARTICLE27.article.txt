# Sam McDonald Spirit to Pervade 60th Big Game
## 
### 
If Sam McDonald has anything
to do with it . . . we'll win tomor
row.
Sam never missed seeing a Big
Game during his 50 years on The
Farm. When he was hospitalized
in 1955 for a leg infection, he
watched the proceedings by tele
vision from his hospital bed.
He was touched and surprised
when he suddenly realized during
half-time activities that the game
had been dedicated to him by the
students for whom he had done
so much.
You know the rest of the story.
In 1955 Stanford won the Big
Game, 19-0, for the first time in
nine years. It was the first win
in Stanford Stadium since the
"Vow Boys" did the job in 1935,
by a score of 13-0.
Tomorrow's half-time activities
have again been dedicated to Sam,
who died Nov. 3 of a heart ailment
after more than 50 years of serv
ice to Stanford, during which time
he served as director of buildings
and grounds.
The Band, will break with tradi
tion and will conclude half-time
activities by spelling out "Sam
McDonald" instead of finishing
with the Axe formation.
Even in death Sam didn't forget
his many friends here and at the
Stanford Convalescent Home. He
left his entire estate, valued at
$10,000. to the University and to
Con Home.
Now it's our turn. Let's take
this one for Sam!
