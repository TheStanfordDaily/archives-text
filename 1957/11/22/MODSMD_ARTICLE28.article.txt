# Corbus to Enter Football Hall of Fame
## Says No Change In Grid Players' Social Positions 
### John Anderson 
The position of the Stanford
football player in campus society
hasn't changed much in the past
25 years, according to two-time
All-American guard Bill Curbus.
Corbus will be admitted into
the National Football Hall of
Fame during half time of Big
Game, as a result of his outstand
ing performance on the '31, '32
and '33 Indian teams.
Recent magazine articles have
indicated that the football player
is no longer the great campus
hero that he was 25 years ago.
Corbus explained in an inter
view with The Daily that while he
was at Stanford the player was
never considered a gladiator.
"That [gladiator] would be the
worst type of complex. The play
er doesn't want that position," the
1932 student body president re
ported.
Most Minutes Played
Corbus, who is now connected
with the Atlantic & Pacific Tea
Company, holds the all-time Stan
ford record for the most minutes
played during a college career.
One hundred and eighty of
those minutes were played in
three Big Games. The Indians
had' a record of 1 win, 1 loss and
1 tic in that scries with the Golden
Bears.
Corbus also played 60 minutes
against Columbia in the 1933 Rose
Bowl game. Stanford rooters had
their disappointments then as well
as today, for the heavily*favored
Indians were upset by the Lions,
7-0, in a game that is still extolled
on the Columbia campus.
Under Warner
For two seasons, '31 and '32,
Corbus played under the coaching
of the late Glenn S. Warner.
"Pop? Well, he was just mar
velous," said Corbus. "We all
hated to see him go."
It was under Warner that t ho
Tribe originated the wing back,
which added a good deal of decep
tion and excitement to the game.
The 1933 team was coached by
C. E. (Tiny) Thornhill, who made
his debut as an Indian coach by
leading the Cards to a PCC title
and the Rose Bowl.
Corbus, who was graduated
magna cum laude, still keeps in
close contact with the University
and football by acting as a mem
ber of the S t a n 112 or d Athletic
Board. For several years he of
ficiated at college games, includ
ing two Rose Bowl contests, one
Cotton Bowl and one Sugar Bowl.
Keeps Close Watch
For every home game Corbus
makes the short trip fr/nn his
Mcnlo Park home to Stanford Sta
dium, where he can keep a close
tab on the Indian teams.
'"We have no reason to be
ashamed of this year's team." In
Corbus' eyes it is one of the best
balanced clubs that Stanford has
fielded. The Cards' performance
has established them as one of
the top teams on the coast.
As for extra points — well,
there's something that has just
happened. Corbus was a place
kicker for the Indians and said
that he missed a few "but the cir

cuinstances were never such that
it made any difference."
Actually Corbus' field goal
kicking was a high light of the
1933 season. A boot from the
eight-yard line beat UCLA 3-0,
and in the SC game it was two
field goals by Corbus that won
the game for the Indians 13-7.
When asked for a prediction
on this year's Big Game, Corbus
was a little hesitant.
"You know anything can hap
pen in the contest. If one looks 1
at the records it would seem that
Stanford will win," he speculated. 1
But the Big Game is one where j
records don't seem to hold much 1
water.
Corbus was certain of one
thing, that the game would be a
thriller.
IMay Just as Well
This brought the question of!
whether football today is as ex- j
citing and well played as the
game of 25 years ago.
He answered, "I suppose we i
former players would like to
think that the game isn't as tough
as before, but to be truthful foot- -
ball today is played every bit as
well.
"The fellows are just as active 1
and vigorous in playing as ever."

played during a college career.
One hundred and eighty of
those minutes were played in
three Big Games. The Indians
had' a record of 1 win, 1 loss and
1 tic in that scries with the Golden
Bears.
Corbus also played 60 minutes
against Columbia in the 1933 Rose
Bowl game. Stanford rooters had
their disappointments then as well
as today, for the heavily*favored
Indians were upset by the Lions,
7-0, in a game that is still extolled
on the Columbia campus.
Under Warner
For two seasons, '31 and '32,
Corbus played under the coaching
of the late Glenn S. Warner.
"Pop? Well, he was just mar
velous," said Corbus. "We all
hated to see him go."
It was under Warner that t ho
Tribe originated the wing back,
which added a good deal of decep
tion and excitement to the game.
The 1933 team was coached by
C. E. (Tiny) Thornhill, who made
his debut as an Indian coach by
leading the Cards to a PCC title
and the Rose Bowl.
Corbus, who was graduated
magna cum laude, still keeps in
close contact with the University
and football by acting as a mem
ber of the S t a n 112 or d Athletic
Board. For several years he of
ficiated at college games, includ
ing two Rose Bowl contests, one
Cotton Bowl and one Sugar Bowl.
Keeps Close Watch
For every home game Corbus
makes the short trip fr/nn his
Mcnlo Park home to Stanford Sta
dium, where he can keep a close
tab on the Indian teams.
'"We have no reason to be
ashamed of this year's team." In
Corbus' eyes it is one of the best
balanced clubs that Stanford has
fielded. The Cards' performance
has established them as one of
the top teams on the coast.
As for extra points — well,
there's something that has just
happened. Corbus was a place
kicker for the Indians and said
that he missed a few "but the cir

cuinstances were never such that
it made any difference."
Actually Corbus' field goal
kicking was a high light of the
1933 season. A boot from the
eight-yard line beat UCLA 3-0,
and in the SC game it was two
field goals by Corbus that won
the game for the Indians 13-7.
When asked for a prediction
on this year's Big Game, Corbus
was a little hesitant.
"You know anything can hap
pen in the contest. If one looks 1
at the records it would seem that
Stanford will win," he speculated. 1
But the Big Game is one where j
records don't seem to hold much 1
water.
Corbus was certain of one
thing, that the game would be a
thriller.
IMay Just as Well
This brought the question of!
whether football today is as ex- j
citing and well played as the
game of 25 years ago.
He answered, "I suppose we i
former players would like to
think that the game isn't as tough
as before, but to be truthful foot- -
ball today is played every bit as
well.
"The fellows are just as active 1
and vigorous in playing as ever."


BILL CORBUS—IN THE HALL OF FAME
The position of the Stanford
football player in campus society
hasn't changed much in the past
25 years, according to two-time
All-American guard Bill Curbus.
Corbus will be admitted into
the National Football Hall of
Fame during half time of Big
Game, as a result of his outstand
ing performance on the '31, '32
and '33 Indian teams.
Recent magazine articles have
indicated that the football player
is no longer the great campus
hero that he was 25 years ago.
Corbus explained in an inter
view with The Daily that while he
was at Stanford the player was
never considered a gladiator.
"That [gladiator] would be the
worst type of complex. The play
er doesn't want that position," the
1932 student body president re

C. E. (Tiny) Thornhill, who made
his debut as an Indian coach by
leading the Cards to a PCC title
and the Rose Bowl.
Corbus, who was graduated
magna cum laude, still keeps in
close contact with the University
and football by acting as a mem
ber of the S t a n 112 or d Athletic
Board. For several years he of
ficiated at college games, includ
ing two Rose Bowl contests, one
Cotton Bowl and one Sugar Bowl.
Keeps Close Watch
For every home game Corbus
makes the short trip fr/nn his
Mcnlo Park home to Stanford Sta
dium, where he can keep a close
tab on the Indian teams.
'"We have no reason to be
ashamed of this year's team." In
Corbus' eyes it is one of the best
balanced clubs that Stanford has
fielded. The Cards' performance
has established them as one of
the top teams on the coast.
As for extra points — well,
there's something that has just
happened. Corbus was a place
kicker for the Indians and said
that he missed a few "but the cir

cuinstances were never such that
it made any difference."
Actually Corbus' field goal
kicking was a high light of the
1933 season. A boot from the
eight-yard line beat UCLA 3-0,
and in the SC game it was two
field goals by Corbus that won
the game for the Indians 13-7.
When asked for a prediction
on this year's Big Game, Corbus
was a little hesitant.
"You know anything can hap
pen in the contest. If one looks 1
at the records it would seem that
Stanford will win," he speculated. 1
But the Big Game is one where j
records don't seem to hold much 1
water.
Corbus was certain of one
thing, that the game would be a
thriller.
IMay Just as Well
This brought the question of!
whether football today is as ex- j
citing and well played as the
game of 25 years ago.
He answered, "I suppose we i
former players would like to
think that the game isn't as tough
as before, but to be truthful foot- -
ball today is played every bit as
well.
"The fellows are just as active 1
and vigorous in playing as ever."


BILL CORBUS—IN THE HALL OF FAME
The position of the Stanford
football player in campus society
hasn't changed much in the past
25 years, according to two-time
All-American guard Bill Curbus.
Corbus will be admitted into
the National Football Hall of
Fame during half time of Big
Game, as a result of his outstand
ing performance on the '31, '32
and '33 Indian teams.
Recent magazine articles have
indicated that the football player
is no longer the great campus
hero that he was 25 years ago.
Corbus explained in an inter
view with The Daily that while he
was at Stanford the player was
never considered a gladiator.
"That [gladiator] would be the
worst type of complex. The play
er doesn't want that position," the
1932 student body president re
ported.
Most Minutes Played
Corbus, who is now connected
with the Atlantic & Pacific Tea
Company, holds the all-time Stan
ford record for the most minutes
played during a college career.
One hundred and eighty of
those minutes were played in
three Big Games. The Indians
had' a record of 1 win, 1 loss and
1 tic in that scries with the Golden
Bears.
Corbus also played 60 minutes
against Columbia in the 1933 Rose
Bowl game. Stanford rooters had
their disappointments then as well
as today, for the heavily*favored
Indians were upset by the Lions,
7-0, in a game that is still extolled
on the Columbia campus.
Under Warner
For two seasons, '31 and '32,
Corbus played under the coaching
of the late Glenn S. Warner.
"Pop? Well, he was just mar
velous," said Corbus. "We all
hated to see him go."
It was under Warner that t ho
Tribe originated the wing back,
which added a good deal of decep
tion and excitement to the game.
The 1933 team was coached by
C. E. (Tiny) Thornhill, who made
his debut as an Indian coach by
leading the Cards to a PCC title
and the Rose Bowl.
