more lhan a story tall, lying flat
on its back, neatly beheaded by
the Axe. Squashed under the bear

structed by Lagunita-Phi Delta
Theta was a massive Stanford In

mangy bear down the back.
Other winning decorations
have been a graveyard scene with
a big Indian ready to "Axe" Oski,
only never quite making it, de
signed by Kappa Alpha-Branner;
an intruding Golden Bear about
to get the heave-ho from an In
dian'warrior, built by Theta Xi

chine decorated with schools who
had fallen before the Indian Grid
