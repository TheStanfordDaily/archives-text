## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The man who's missed only one Big Came since 1025 pvedicts vic
tory for Stanford in the annual classic will) California Saiurday.
A1 Masters, Director of Athletics at Stanford, says, '"I think we're
going to win, but 1 won't make a prediction on a score or margin."
Masters came to Stanford as general manager of the Board of
Athletic Control in October, 1925, , ... r , . , _ ,

and became .athletic director when
the title was changed.
The only game Masters has
missed since assuming the reins
of Stanford athletics was the 1935
battle. He was in New York at
an Olympic meetinir, and so
missed the farewell Big Game of
the Vow Boys.
The Standout in 19-17
Of all the Indian-near games
he's seen, Masters ranks the 21
18 thriller of 1917 as the one
which stands out most in his
mind. That was the year a win
less Card team Jed the Bowl
bound Bears, 18-14, with only
four minutes to go. But then
came the intramural pass, and
Cal won.
Masters rates this year's squad
as a "good team. It's not Rose
Bowl caliber, but it's a better
team than last year's."
Big Came time is always one
of the busiest, of the year for
Masters and the athletic depart
ment. His biggest headache is in
the ticket distribulion.
All at Midlicld
"It's a real problem trying to
gel 90,000 people on the 50-yard
line." Stanford's allotment this
year is 30,()0n tickets, or 10 per
cent of the Stadium capacity.
Cal used to get Of) per cent to
just 35 for Stanford because of
their larger body of alumni. But
since Stanford has used Cal tick
ets the past three years, lite per
centages were shifted to 00 10
this fall.
There are always lots of ex
euses given by fans trying to get
hold of tickets at the last min
ute. The most common one, says
Masters, is that "we didn't re
ceive our application." Fortu
nately. Stanford has not s had to
turn down any ticket requests
the past two years, although peo
ple aren't always satisfied with
their seats in section A.
