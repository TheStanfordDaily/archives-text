# Oskie Cavorts In Baggy Blue For Cal Spirit
## 
### Betty Kantor 
Oskie, Cal's mascot, can bo
seen wearing baggy blue pants,
a yellow block sweater with a
big "C," and a huge plexiglass
bear head at ;ill Cal games and
rallies. I le's the one who is climb
ing up the goal posts, aping the
bancl or carrying off some Rally
Com girl.
The Oskie tradition at Cal be
gan in 19 Ki when some off cam
pus students arrived at the game
with a papier-mache bear head.
Someone saw the head, yelled
"Oskie" and Cal students have
been yelling "Oskie" ever since.
Instead of being one person all
the time, Oskie has now become
a Committee of Ten which keeps
Oskie's identity a secret by keep
ing a different member of the
committee in the bear costume at
all times.
No one knows which Oskie is
on the field at any given moment
often the Oskie who cavorts
during pre â€¢ game ceremonies is
not the same as the one who
takes the field during half-time.
Oskies have been known to bring
a date to the game, go out "for
hot dogs" at the half, return, hot
dogs in hand, after performing
for a few minutes on the field,
and no one ever suspects.
Qualifications are rigid for Os
kies. lyiemhcrs of the committee
must be about five feet four
inches and must have had some
previous gymnastic experience so
that they will be limber enough
to climb up goal posts and sturdy
enough to carry off band mem
bers with equanimity.
