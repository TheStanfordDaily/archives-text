Bloome told The Daily his com

Bloome saw no bitterness in
the rivalry between Cal and Stan

the goals for which they were set
j up. I think there is more of a ri-
I valry between Stanford and UC
LA. Our rivalry is a traditional
one, but the Stanford-UCLA ri

Cal has suffered from the same

Bloome saw no bitterness in
the rivalry between Cal and Stan

ties." he said, "and accomplish
the goals for which they were set

I valry between Stanford and UC
LA. Our rivalry is a traditional
one, but the Stanford-UCLA ri

Cal has suffered from the same
