## 
### Steve Baffrey 
"It is very possible that Big I
i Game will be the best game play
led on the coast all season," Don
Liebendorfer believes. "And what
[amazes me is the expected crowd.
The teams have a combined rec
ord of (i-12 'and we expect a vir
tual sell-out! It couldn't happen
I any where else but at Big Game." J
Liebendorfer is Stanford's ath- i
leties publicity director and holds
| the honor of being the first full- j
] time director of this sort in the!
I country. With the exception of a
45-montli period in the Navy, he
j has been at his job since 1924.
During the last half of his sen-j
ior year at Stanford, Liebendorfer i
I was editor of The Daily, and that !
spring he began to work part time 1
jat his present position. The Eng-1
lish-economics co-major soon dis
covered it was more than part
! time work, though.
"Maintaining the welfare and
good reputation of S t a nfo r d
teams and their coaches" is what
lie believes to be the paramount I
object of his work. "Some worry I
about the attendance gate," he j
says, "but I'd have to make that
! a secondary concern."
Speaking more about tomor- |
row's Big Game, he says, "Natu-'
rally, I pick Stanford, but you'
can't overlook the fact that com- j
parative records have to be dis-j
I carded. It's actually a very even
game, and those guys from Cal j
I play their best ball against us."
"Don," as he is known to all
who work with him, has duties'
! enough to keep him constantly on
the go. Among his many duties
| are the compilation and distribu-'

lion of the multitude ol' press no
tices. guides and booklets which
are provided throughout the year.
In addition to this, lie controls
the seating arrangements in tlie
Stanford Stadium press box and
precedes the Stanford team to the
site of all away games to set up
a Stanford information serv ice for
the local press.
