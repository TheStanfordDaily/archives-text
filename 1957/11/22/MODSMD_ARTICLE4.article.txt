## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Stanford's Coach Chuck Taylor
has resigned.
Taylor's resignation and sub
sequent appointment as Assist
ant Director of Atheltics was
made y ester d a y by President
Wallace Sterling following the
monthly meeting in San Francis
co of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees.
In making the announcement
Dr. Sterling said: "We have al
ways considered Chuck Taylor
Ihe ideal football coach. He com
bines great technical proficiency
with high character and the quali
ties of a fine teacher. We had
hoped to have his services as
head coach for many years lo
come, but he has decided to give
up coaching as a career.
"'We respect his decision and
count Stanford fortunate in be
ing able to keep him on the Farm

as assistant director of athletics."
Taylor's resignation of his foot
ball duties becomes effective on
P"eb. 1, 1958. No successor has
been named. Athletic Director A 1
Masters will seek a new coach
and recommend his appointment
to the President. There has not
even been a hint of the new head
coach from University authori
ties.
His seven years as head coach
mark the second longest period
that any one man has served in
this capacity. "Pop" Warner
coached Stanford teams for nine
years, from 1924 to 1932.
This is the second year in a row
that Resignations have marked
a Big Game. Last year California
coach Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf an
nounced the conclusion of his col
legiate coaching career practical
ly on the eve of Big Game.
W a 1 d or f' s resignat ion was
meant to have a psychological ef

fect on last year's game and was
conducted in an entirely different
manner from the 37-year-old red
head's.
Taylor would not comment on
his resignation at Stanford's tra
ditional "Burn the Bear" rally in
Lake Lagunita last night. In fact
he requested that no one else
make mention of it. Although he
would say only little about it.he
did iterate that he "wanted it to
have no effect on tomorrow's Big
Game."
Masters welcomed Taylor's ap
pointment. saying, "Much as we
will miss Chuck as a coach, he is
made to order for his new job and
will be a great help to our pro
gra m."
Earlier it had been speculated
that Taylor would replace Mas
ters in the lattor's position. Not
long ago Masters suffered a spell
of poor health which ended in a
serious operation. Masters took

this occasion to state that this
move is not a prelude to his own
retirement.
Taylor believes his promotion
"is an indication that intercolle
i giate competition goes full steam
ahead at Stanford. I have long
believed that Stanford represents
intercollegiate competition at its
best."
Speculation of Taylor's resig
, nation had been made some
weeks ago. The first definite pre
diction of it appeared in a sports
j column written by Sports Editor
Wait Gamage of the Palo Alto
Times on Nov. 8.
That weekend, in Los Angeles.
Taylor categorically denied his
intention to resign. The coach
has-stated that his decision to do
so was made in the last couple
of days.
News of the loss of their coach
after this season was given to the
team before they concluded prac
tice yesterday. The opinion of the
team was a unanimous, "It's too
bad he's leaving; we're losing a
great coach.
Sophomore quarterback S i d
Garber expressed the feelings <<\
the younger members of llv
squad: "Those of us who arc
sophomores and juniors feci a
though we have lost the opporhi
nity to play under a great leadc i
instructor and coach. We arc
truly sorry to see him go."
"You have to go a long way to
get as good a coach and gentle
man; it's hard to get both. Chuck
commands respect as a coach and
gentleman. I'm sorry Jo see him
resign." This was the eulogy paid
to Stanford's retiring coach by
Indian halfback Jeri McMillin.
Regardless of Taylor's desire
not to have the announcement af
feet play in the Big Game, hi
team is determined to "win il for
Chuck."

tion of assistant to Athletic Director Al Masters ih February. To
