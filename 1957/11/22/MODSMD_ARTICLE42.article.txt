# 'LIFE OF RILEY'
## Scouting Hard Way to See Game 
### Bill Milam 
How would you like to bo paid
to watch a football game every
week during the season? Do you
think it would bo "the life of
Riley"? Well, some people who
are paid to watch football consider
it hard work -they are the foot
ball scouts.
Such a scout is William "Dutch"

Fehring, Stanford's assistant foot
ball coach, who watches other
teams in addition lo'his coaching
I duties.
Fehring and his fellow scouts
have no sinecure. Not only do
I they watch football, they map it
| out and prepare almost a book on
:the scouted team. A normal Sat
: urday is quite a busy one in the
life of a football scout.

His work often begins weeks
j before the team being scouted
plays Stanford. Each PCC team
lis allowed to scout another three
times, taking the scout on lengthy
| trips.
Scouting missions, however, arc
! not pleasure jaunts; the scout has
j only binoculars and charts in his
suitcase. He sits in the press box
and writes more than the report

ers do. His book on the scouted
team may contain 15 or 20 pages
before he hands it in.
Mis first task is to map the of
fensive patterns and systems. lie
notes their primary formation and
the ones that are used less often.
Each running and each passing
play is diagramed.
Do Guards Pull?
The scout focuses his attention
during each running play on the
backs and guards. From these
men he can diagnose most plays.
If tiie guards are pulling, fre
quently one kind of defense will
be effective; if they are not pull
ing, another will work better.
On passing plays, the scout tries
to watch the protection that the
passer receives; the receivers sent
out, their patterns and their hab
its.
The defense of the scouted team
is observed minutely. The scout
diagrams each defense used. He
noli ; its weaknesses, its strength.
He sees what defense the team
uses against different offenses,
lie roles who can be trapped, who
is slow, who has good pursuit,
j and many other things.
The liittle Things
Into the scout's notes go many
jollier things not noticed by other
viewer:; of the game. The players'
j kicking game, spirit, habits, ten
dencies in certain situations and
other things are observed minute
ly by the scout.
The result is a chart of a foot
hall iiold with a list of the plays
run from everywhere on the field
against each of the scouted team's
I opponents. liy comparing the
scouted team's plays from each
part of the field against the de
dense s used by the opposing
teams, the coaches know pretty
| well what to expect in any situa
j lion.
Player Report; Made
A report is made on each of the
scouted team's players, including
their physical characteristics, hab
its. and strong and weak points.
The scout makes out a page
showing the tendencies of the
team to run to the right or left
when they are on one side of the
i field or the other. He draws a run
ning plan of their defense against
each offense they have faced. He
maps their kicking game, telling
how they get down the field and
whether it is wise to run punts
| back or not.
Everything goes into this re
port including how l'asl the wa
ter boy gets op ihe field! When
the scout hands in his home work
on the Sunday preceding the game
he probably knows more about
I the scouted team than its play
' ers do.

The scout makes out a page
showing the tendencies of the
team to run to the right or left
when they are on one side of the
i field or the other. He draws a run
ning plan of their defense against
each offense they have faced. He
maps their kicking game, telling
how they get down the field and
whether it is wise to run punts

How would you like to bo paid
to watch a football game every
week during the season? Do you
think it would bo "the life of
Riley"? Well, some people who
are paid to watch football consider
it hard work -they are the foot
ball scouts.
Such a scout is William "Dutch"

Fehring, Stanford's assistant foot
ball coach, who watches other
teams in addition lo'his coaching
I duties.
Fehring and his fellow scouts
have no sinecure. Not only do
I they watch football, they map it
| out and prepare almost a book on
:the scouted team. A normal Sat
: urday is quite a busy one in the
life of a football scout.

His work often begins weeks
j before the team being scouted
plays Stanford. Each PCC team
lis allowed to scout another three
times, taking the scout on lengthy
| trips.
Scouting missions, however, arc
! not pleasure jaunts; the scout has
j only binoculars and charts in his
suitcase. He sits in the press box
and writes more than the report

ers do. His book on the scouted
team may contain 15 or 20 pages
before he hands it in.
Mis first task is to map the of
fensive patterns and systems. lie
notes their primary formation and
the ones that are used less often.
Each running and each passing
play is diagramed.
Do Guards Pull?
The scout focuses his attention
during each running play on the
backs and guards. From these
men he can diagnose most plays.
If tiie guards are pulling, fre
quently one kind of defense will
be effective; if they are not pull
ing, another will work better.
On passing plays, the scout tries
to watch the protection that the
passer receives; the receivers sent
out, their patterns and their hab
its.
The defense of the scouted team
is observed minutely. The scout
diagrams each defense used. He
noli ; its weaknesses, its strength.
He sees what defense the team
uses against different offenses,
lie roles who can be trapped, who
is slow, who has good pursuit,
j and many other things.
The liittle Things
Into the scout's notes go many
jollier things not noticed by other
viewer:; of the game. The players'
j kicking game, spirit, habits, ten
dencies in certain situations and
other things are observed minute
ly by the scout.
The result is a chart of a foot
hall iiold with a list of the plays
run from everywhere on the field
against each of the scouted team's
I opponents. liy comparing the
scouted team's plays from each
part of the field against the de
dense s used by the opposing
teams, the coaches know pretty
| well what to expect in any situa
j lion.
