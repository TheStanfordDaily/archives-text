# LET'S EVEN THE SERIES
## Only Two Victories in 11 Years 
### 
Lot's even the series. Since 1892 the University
of California and Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity have been meeting on the football field
except for time out for world wars.
The series now stands with 23 victories for
Cal, 24 for the Indians and 10 ties.
The last Stanford victory was in 1955 when
ihe Cards blasted the Bears, 19-0, in Stanford
Stadium. That was the first Indian win since

1946. That year Stanford eased by Cal, 26-6, to
resume the Big Game after a layoff for the war.
Last year the favored Indians bowed to the
Bears. 20 18, at Berkeley, where it was the last
year for Cal's coach, Pappy Waldorf. >
In his seven years at Stanford Coach Chuck
Taylor has managed only one win over Cal
(1955) and one tie (1953). And in 11 years the
Cards have won only twice.
