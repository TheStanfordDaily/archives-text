# Elliott, Taylor Match Gridiron Talents
## Elliott Youngest Coach in Cal History 
### Glenn Dickey, The Daily Californian 
'I his year's Big Game will feature a brand-new California coaching staff—a young
staff that is rapidly aging as a result of Cal losses this season.
Head coach Pete Elliott, at 30, is the youngest head coach in California's history.
And Elliott brought with him probably the youngest over-all staff Cal has ever had.
Elliott's staff includes 32-year-old Dee Andros, his right-hand man; Buck McPhail,

27; Bill Taylor, only 23; Rod
Franz, 31; John Ralston, 29. and
the ' granddaddy" of the bunch,
Gene Stauber, who is 36.
There were high hopes at the
start of the year that Elliott, who
server! as assistant io Oklahoma's
Bud Wilkinson, would bring some
of Wilkinson's magic with.him to
Cal. Perhaps he did. but unfor
tunately he neglected to bring any
of Wilkinson's players with him.
Despite the Bears' record this
fall, however, Cal students still
strongly support Elliott. The won
loss record doesn't reflect it, but
the Bears have played some good
football this fall.
Elliott's emphasis on defense
has been responsible for molding
Cal into a strong defensive team
that has been able to hold such
titans as Michigan State and Navy
to three touchdowns.
Xplii-T Trouble
The installation of Elliott's split
T has caused some troubles, espe
cially in the opening games, be
cause «sI I he players' unfamiliar
ity with I he .system.
In later games, however, the
team has demonstrated a real
ability io move the ball' and run
the system the way it should be
run. The most notable example
• if this wrs I he second half of the
UCLA game.
1211 io 11 lias shown a willingness
to experiment thai makes for in
teresting football, too. Against
Washington Stale, for instance,
he even threw in some single
wing plays, with Hie versatile and
lalenled .loc Kapp running at tail
back. t
He's Personable
"Personable" is a much over
worked word, but it's exactly the
word thai comes to mind in talk
ing about Elliott. Everybody who
talks let him likes him. Even news
papermen who wish he would say
more al times have nothing but
kind things to say about him.
Staff-player relations have been
very good under Elliott, although
he has worked the team very hard
this year.
The main reason for the good
staff-player relations has been El
liott'.*; attitude toward the players.
For instance, after the UCLA
game, Elliott was almost in tears
because he wanted the team to
win not so much for himself as
for the players.
He praised his players after the
Navy game because they had con
tinued working hard in practice
although they hadn't won a game
at that point. As he pointed out,
it's easy to be "up" when you're
winning but very difficult to stay
up when you're losing.
So that's Pete Elliott. A helluva
nice guy and a good coach besides.
lie's not missing any angles,
either. Al last count he was hud
dling wilh his predecessor, Lynn
"Pappy" Waldorf, to get Pappy's
magic Bii; Game formula. i

'I his year's Big Game will feature a brand-new California coaching staff—a young
staff that is rapidly aging as a result of Cal losses this season.
Head coach Pete Elliott, at 30, is the youngest head coach in California's history.
And Elliott brought with him probably the youngest over-all staff Cal has ever had.
Elliott's staff includes 32-year-old Dee Andros, his right-hand man; Buck McPhail,

27; Bill Taylor, only 23; Rod
Franz, 31; John Ralston, 29. and
the ' granddaddy" of the bunch,
Gene Stauber, who is 36.
There were high hopes at the
start of the year that Elliott, who
server! as assistant io Oklahoma's
Bud Wilkinson, would bring some
of Wilkinson's magic with.him to
Cal. Perhaps he did. but unfor
tunately he neglected to bring any
of Wilkinson's players with him.
Despite the Bears' record this
fall, however, Cal students still
strongly support Elliott. The won
loss record doesn't reflect it, but
the Bears have played some good
football this fall.
