# First U.S. Use of Card Stunts in '23 Game When Expanding 'S' Was Introduced
## 
### Paola Gianturco 
At Big Game in 1923 Stanford
became the first university in the
United States to attempt card
stunts in the rooters' section. A
little blue "C" in a field of white
was hit by a jagged bolt, of red.
The "C" exploded in a cloud of
blue, and a red "S" flashed, grow
ing bigger and bigger. This was
the first, and set a precedent for
34 years of card pictures.
Stanford seemed to be first in
every way concerning bleacher
stunts. In fact, in 1905 they were
the first in the nation to per
form rooters' stunts during the
halves.
Stanford men wore reversible
red and white hats and sat in a
block, forming a red "S" on a
field of white. This idea was
originated by Thomas Jewell, a
civil engineer from Bur'oank who
was a grad student at Stanford
that year.
As early as 1899 Stanford root
ers' spirit was evident, as 300
men wore cardinal vests and
made up the front row of the
rooting section for Big Game.
Elaborate card designs have
been especially planned every
year for the California game. A
design contest, similar to the one
hold this fall Io plan a stunt, was
already a Rally Com annual
event in 192S.
In 1947 the first gold and silver
metallic cards were used. The
price of those was almost triple
I he cost of the regular dime card
board squares.
There is much thai goes on be
hind the scenes before a Stanford
card stunt may be performed.
First .the design idea must be
sketched. Then il is drawn on
graph paper according to the
number of seats in the section.
These jobs are handled by Jim
Hubert, who heads the Card
Stunt Art Committee.
Dick Stanford takes over from
there, with his Stamping and Or
ganizing Committee which writes
and checks rooters' instruction
sheets, marks, sorts and places
the cards under the bleachers
ready for use during the half.
This Saturday afternoon, 11
stunts will be performed, includ
ing the prize - winning design
from last week's contest. Twelve
colors will be used, and 24,000
cards are to be included in the
patterns. The final stunt will he
the traditional expanding ' S"
which has been used as a sign-off
for six years. II is the same "S"
which introduced the first card
stunts almost 35 years ago.

card stunt may be performed.
First .the design idea must be
sketched. Then il is drawn on
graph paper according to the
number of seats in the section.
These jobs are handled by Jim
Hubert, who heads the Card
Stunt Art Committee.
Dick Stanford takes over from
there, with his Stamping and Or
ganizing Committee which writes
and checks rooters' instruction
sheets, marks, sorts and places
the cards under the bleachers
ready for use during the half.
This Saturday afternoon, 11
stunts will be performed, includ
ing the prize - winning design
from last week's contest. Twelve
colors will be used, and 24,000
cards are to be included in the
patterns. The final stunt will he
the traditional expanding ' S"
which has been used as a sign-off
for six years. II is the same "S"
which introduced the first card
stunts almost 35 years ago.

At Big Game in 1923 Stanford
became the first university in the
United States to attempt card
stunts in the rooters' section. A
little blue "C" in a field of white
was hit by a jagged bolt, of red.
The "C" exploded in a cloud of
blue, and a red "S" flashed, grow
ing bigger and bigger. This was
the first, and set a precedent for
34 years of card pictures.
Stanford seemed to be first in
every way concerning bleacher
stunts. In fact, in 1905 they were
the first in the nation to per
form rooters' stunts during the
halves.
Stanford men wore reversible
red and white hats and sat in a
block, forming a red "S" on a
field of white. This idea was
originated by Thomas Jewell, a
civil engineer from Bur'oank who
was a grad student at Stanford
that year.
As early as 1899 Stanford root
ers' spirit was evident, as 300
men wore cardinal vests and
made up the front row of the
rooting section for Big Game.
Elaborate card designs have
been especially planned every
year for the California game. A
design contest, similar to the one
hold this fall Io plan a stunt, was
already a Rally Com annual
event in 192S.
In 1947 the first gold and silver
metallic cards were used. The
price of those was almost triple
I he cost of the regular dime card
board squares.
There is much thai goes on be
hind the scenes before a Stanford
card stunt may be performed.
