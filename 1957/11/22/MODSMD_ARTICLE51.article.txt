old Assembly Hall, now the Stanford Business School. According to

Quad accounts of that era, they
% |
were uproarious affairs, ending in i
a serpentine dance around the
Bonfire.
Enthusiasm must have lagged j
somewhere along the line, how
ever, for the Daily Palo Alto of
Big Game Week, 1920, published a j
plea from that year's head yell !
leader for rally attendance and |
support.
The '30's and '40's witnessed a
yearly procession beginning after
dinner at the top of the Row in
front of the Phi Gamma Delta
house and winding down through
campus to the Pavilion.
An honor guard marched first,
bearing the sequoia coffin in
which Oskie, Cal's mascot, would
be ceremoniously interred later at \
the rally.
