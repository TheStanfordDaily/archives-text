## Air Horn Blasts Recall '55 UCLA Episode 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
Whenever a blast from an air
horn pierces the air around cam
pus, students especially Alpha
Sigma Phi men are reminded of
the illustrious deed that gave the
UC'LA Air Horn, and Ihe Alpha
Sigma Phi house, a permanent
place among Stanford's football
I radii ions.
For it was al the 1955 Stanford-
UCLA game, on Oct. 15, thai the
horn was stolen from the Bruins,
only to be returned six days later
after a brief but immortal series
of events.
The story goes that Phi Delia
Thctan Tom Gregg, '57, after
tracking the air horn since 10
a.m. that day, managed to capture
il at the funnel entrance to the
stadium and raced across the field
to the stands.
There he handed it over to Bill
Lackey, '57. in the Alpha Sig sec
lion, and the horn began to
scream vigorously. Due to the
"slight protests" of the UCLA sec
lion, head cheer leader Jim Wal
ters pledged himself personally to
return the horn if the Bruins
would return the red-and-white
megaphone and the drum major's
baton that subsequently had been
taken.
But line to failure of UCLA to
return its loot, (lie born was lii
umphantly escorted out of the sta

dium and into the trunk of Lack
ey's car by a group of 40 or 50
students. A crowd from UCLA
soon formed around the car, but
Lackey escaped to the hills, say
ing on his return I hat he had
dumped Ihe horn t here.
But, somehow, the air horn
turned up at ihc Alpha Sig house,
where it was converted from its
original gold and blue to a bright
cardinal red and white. Also, a
silver pla'que was attached to the
tank, which read:
, Captured by Tom Gregg
Preserved by Alpha Sigma i'lil
for the
Students of Stanford University
Stanford â€”UCLA
1955
But the Bruins, on returning to
UCLA, ran tc> their dean, who de
manded the air horn. So. to avoid
future trouble, the horn was re
turned, freight prepaid, only six
flays after it had been captured
but still flaunting its brilliant new
color scheme.
So far as we know, the tank,
with the silver plaque, is now rest
ing in thr UCLA trophy room.
But the air horn you'll hear
ing at Big Game is not ihe origi
nal one, but a replica, purchased
two years ago and owned by the
Theta Xi house. But it will blow
just as loudly this Saturday as
did the UCLA horn that day in
1955.
