# Pompon Girls Are Colorful Addition To Cardinal Big Game Festivities
## 
### Sara Mogel 
Unless you are an avid football
fan, with eyes only for the men
on the field, you are probably
fully aware of the five lively girls
who are on their toes throughout
Who playing period of each game,
leading the rooters in their ef
forts to incite the team to victory.
After seeing these girls in their
ml-and-white outfits with their
enormous pompons, it would be
quite hard to imagine them wear
ing any other type of costume.
J Jul. until the last two years, Stan
ford's pompon girls had been re
(juired to wear the white pleated
skirts and white sweaters similar
to those worn at present by the
girls of the Rally Committee.

Fourteen years of tradition
! were against changing of costume
j and routines, but supporters of
I ho present ideas won the conflict
concerning these things. Before
this time the girls were not al
lowed to prance, kick, or turn as
they do now, and they waved only
the small red-and-white pompons
now waved by members of the
I girls' rooting section.
While these girls, with their
happy smiles, make song leading
appear easy, it has been discov
ered that this is not all play and
no work.
Thcv now practice on Saturday
mornings, for three hours Friday
afternoons and about six hours
during the rest of the week. They

compose all their own routines,
which can be adapted to all of the
songs. And the rumor has it that
they are planning a spectacular
number for Big Game.
For the more personal side of
the story, here are your 1957-58
pompon girls: Sonya Davison, Lu
ana Gough. Sandy Hogan. Connie
King and Margaret Mix. Two of
these girls are sophomores, the
others juniors.
Nursing Major
Luana Gough, sophomore from
Glendale, Calif., is a nursing ma
jor who lives at Florence Moore
this year. The other member of
the class of '60 is Sandy Hogan,
I who now lives at Lagunita. Sandy
! is interested in becoming a labo
; ratory technician. She, like all of
1 the other pompon girls, is from
; California — Sacramento, to be
exact. She developed her interest
; in song leading as a freshman last
year.
Of the juniors in the group,
one, Margaret Mix, lives at Flor
ence Moore and is a political sci
ence major f r o m Long Beach.
Sonya Davison, from Arcadia, i,s
living at Storey House this year,
and is an education major; and
and is an English major; and.
from Ross, is currently residing
at Lathrop.
Pompon
The word "pompon" which we
have attached to these girls who
•wave the crepe-paper balls in
front of the rooting section is de
fined as an ornamental ball of
silk or feathers for a woman's
costume. The word is also used
to mean a tuft or ball of wool
worn on the, front of a hat.
The word should not be con
fused with "pom-pom." This word
was given to an automatic ma
chine cannon using metallic am
munition fed from a hookerj belt
attached to the gun because of the
drumming sound produced by the
action.


SOMETHING BI<; IN STORK —A special sur
prise is in store for rooters'tomorrow 'ifternoon,
when the pompon girls, above, start "doing; their
.stuff." The girls have been planning the Rig*

Game entertainment for weeks. Back row, left

Pompon
The word "pompon" which we
have attached to these girls who
•wave the crepe-paper balls in
front of the rooting section is de
fined as an ornamental ball of
silk or feathers for a woman's
costume. The word is also used
to mean a tuft or ball of wool
worn on the, front of a hat.
The word should not be con
fused with "pom-pom." This word
was given to an automatic ma
chine cannon using metallic am
munition fed from a hookerj belt
attached to the gun because of the
drumming sound produced by the
action.

prise is in store for rooters'tomorrow 'ifternoon,

.stuff." The girls have been planning the Rig*

Game entertainment for weeks. Back row, left

Unless you are an avid football
fan, with eyes only for the men
on the field, you are probably
fully aware of the five lively girls
who are on their toes throughout
Who playing period of each game,
leading the rooters in their ef
forts to incite the team to victory.
After seeing these girls in their
ml-and-white outfits with their
enormous pompons, it would be
quite hard to imagine them wear
ing any other type of costume.
J Jul. until the last two years, Stan
ford's pompon girls had been re
(juired to wear the white pleated
skirts and white sweaters similar
to those worn at present by the
girls of the Rally Committee.

Fourteen years of tradition
! were against changing of costume
j and routines, but supporters of
I ho present ideas won the conflict
concerning these things. Before
this time the girls were not al
lowed to prance, kick, or turn as
they do now, and they waved only
the small red-and-white pompons
now waved by members of the
I girls' rooting section.
While these girls, with their
happy smiles, make song leading
appear easy, it has been discov
ered that this is not all play and
no work.
Thcv now practice on Saturday
mornings, for three hours Friday
afternoons and about six hours
during the rest of the week. They

compose all their own routines,
which can be adapted to all of the
songs. And the rumor has it that
they are planning a spectacular
number for Big Game.
For the more personal side of
the story, here are your 1957-58
pompon girls: Sonya Davison, Lu
ana Gough. Sandy Hogan. Connie
King and Margaret Mix. Two of
these girls are sophomores, the
others juniors.
Nursing Major
Luana Gough, sophomore from
Glendale, Calif., is a nursing ma
jor who lives at Florence Moore
this year. The other member of
the class of '60 is Sandy Hogan,
I who now lives at Lagunita. Sandy
! is interested in becoming a labo
; ratory technician. She, like all of
1 the other pompon girls, is from
; California — Sacramento, to be
exact. She developed her interest
; in song leading as a freshman last
year.
Of the juniors in the group,
one, Margaret Mix, lives at Flor
ence Moore and is a political sci
ence major f r o m Long Beach.
Sonya Davison, from Arcadia, i,s
living at Storey House this year,
and is an education major; and
