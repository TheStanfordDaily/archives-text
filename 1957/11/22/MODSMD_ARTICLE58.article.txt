From wooden bleachers to one
of the largest college stadiums in
the nation, Stanford Stadium has
grown with the University.
At the turn of the century, foot
.ball became a popular spectator
sport, and Stanford rooters, 1905
style, were jubilant at the con
struction of wooden bleachers
seating 14,500.
However, with the growth of
the football craze, it became evi
dent that even bleachers were not
adequate for the crowds surging
to the weekly games, and it was
realized that arrangements for a
greater number of* spectators
would have to be made.
At the old Palace Hotel in San
Francisco, in May 1921, the Stan
ford Board of Athletic Control re
vealed plans for construction of
a stadium with a seating capacity
of 60,000.
Professor C. B. Wing of the En
gineering Department became the

cliief designer of ihe project. He
planned the new stadium in the
earthquake-proof "earth bowl"
style and included a 220-yard
straightaway and an open end for
ventilation.
Financing, which initially came
to $210,000, was handled through
contributions from students and
alumni.
"It has remained for the sta
dium to bring the greatest re
sponse from sources heretofore
unmoved in appeals for Stanford
projects," stated an enthusiastic
rooter in a 1921 issue of the Stan
ford Illustrated Review.
Popularity of the project was
incfred evident as students con
tributed $15,000 during the first
few days of the fund-raising cam
paign.
The stadium, begun in the sum
mer of 1921. with Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur breaking the ground, was
completed in the record time of
. r j'/a months. Earth used to form

th e stadium embankment was
taken from a nearby site later
famous as the Sunken Diamond.
Big Game, 1921, was set for the
dedication ceremony.. Despite the
42-7 victory over Stanford by the
C a.l if orni a Rose Bowl-bound
"Wonder Team," students and
alumni alike felt that a great day
had come with the completion of
the new stadium.
The year 1925 found sheep graz
ing outside the stadium walls, in
an effort of the grounds depart
ment "to keep the grass neatly
trimmed a practice abandoned
with the increase of motor traffic!
That same year seats were add
ed at the open end of the stadium,
increasing the capacity to 70,000
and involving an additional $120,-
000 outlay. The year 1925 also
brought a Stanford victory over
California the first in 11 years.
Later additions in seating- have
bro*ught the capacity up to 90.000,
its present size.

From wooden bleachers to one
of the largest college stadiums in
the nation, Stanford Stadium has
grown with the University.
At the turn of the century, foot
.ball became a popular spectator
sport, and Stanford rooters, 1905
style, were jubilant at the con
struction of wooden bleachers
seating 14,500.
However, with the growth of
the football craze, it became evi
dent that even bleachers were not
adequate for the crowds surging
to the weekly games, and it was
realized that arrangements for a
greater number of* spectators
would have to be made.
At the old Palace Hotel in San
Francisco, in May 1921, the Stan
ford Board of Athletic Control re
vealed plans for construction of
a stadium with a seating capacity
of 60,000.
Professor C. B. Wing of the En
gineering Department became the

cliief designer of ihe project. He
planned the new stadium in the
earthquake-proof "earth bowl"
style and included a 220-yard
straightaway and an open end for
ventilation.
Financing, which initially came
to $210,000, was handled through
contributions from students and
alumni.
"It has remained for the sta
dium to bring the greatest re
sponse from sources heretofore
unmoved in appeals for Stanford
projects," stated an enthusiastic
rooter in a 1921 issue of the Stan
ford Illustrated Review.
Popularity of the project was
incfred evident as students con
tributed $15,000 during the first
few days of the fund-raising cam
paign.
The stadium, begun in the sum
mer of 1921. with Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur breaking the ground, was
completed in the record time of
. r j'/a months. Earth used to form

th e stadium embankment was
taken from a nearby site later
famous as the Sunken Diamond.
Big Game, 1921, was set for the
dedication ceremony.. Despite the
42-7 victory over Stanford by the
C a.l if orni a Rose Bowl-bound
"Wonder Team," students and
alumni alike felt that a great day
had come with the completion of
the new stadium.
The year 1925 found sheep graz
ing outside the stadium walls, in
an effort of the grounds depart
ment "to keep the grass neatly
trimmed a practice abandoned
with the increase of motor traffic!
That same year seats were add
ed at the open end of the stadium,
increasing the capacity to 70,000
and involving an additional $120,-
000 outlay. The year 1925 also
brought a Stanford victory over
California the first in 11 years.
Later additions in seating- have
bro*ught the capacity up to 90.000,
its present size.
