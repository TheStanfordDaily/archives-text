# Men's Glee Club to Join Band in Half-time Show Tomorrow
## 
### Pat Brenner 
"Come join tho band and give a cheer for Stanford Red!"
The Men's Glee Club is doing just that for tomorrow's Big Game
activities! This innovation, the brain child of band director Julius
Shuchat, will add the choral group to tho 100-man marching band
as they jointly depict the history of these United States through the

music of the various periods.
"I believe this will be the first
performance w here voices are
used with the band, at least in
PCC history," Shuchat declares.
The Stanford marchers will fol
low the California band for the
pre-game activities, and .both
bands will play the national an
them.
Making a break with tradition,
the Stanford Band will not con
clude these activities with the
forming of the Axe. but, following
that formation, will spell out the
name of Sam McDonald through
a cross, as a tribute to t he late
campus figure. With this forma
tion the crowd will be requested
to sing the Alma Mater.
Music History
During half time, the marching
100 will take fans on a panoramic
musical review of America's heri
tage through the music reminis
cent of each period. The band
will enter the field to the beat of
Indian tom-toms and will form the
outline of a church building. The
glee club will sing a hymn, depict
ing the early Pilgrims.
The marchers (hen.will swing
into a 1776 formation and will
play "Yankee Doodle," followed
by a Civil War theme executed
first by a Federal flag in the north
half of the field and a Confederate
banner in the south half. Playing
"The Battle Hymn of the Repub
lic," the band will then superim
pose on this formation a large
United States flag.
Western Migration
The period of Western migra
tion will bo depicted as the band
forms a covered wagon traveling
down the field as the glee club
sings "Oh, Susanna!" A helmet
and crossed rifles formation next
will denote the World War periods
to the tune of "Over There."
The Stanford Band will climax
its performance with a gigantic
map of the United States and the
rendering of "America, the Beau
tiful!"
Half-time stunts such as these
are planned well in advancc, cs

pecially for Big Game. The music
is arranged by the band director,
and practices and drills are in
serted before Big Game appear
ances at Stanford functions and
alumni parties.
The band, established early in
Stanford history, has risen from
the ranks of a small drill unit to
a full complement of 100 march
ing men. No drum majorettes or
b a to n twirlers are included at
Stanford, as had been the band's
custom throughout its history.
Shuchat has been band director
at Stanford since football was re
sumed after World War 11. He is
assisted by Ed Best, band man
ager, and Dave Korten, assistant
manager. John Parikratz is the
high-strutting drum major.
