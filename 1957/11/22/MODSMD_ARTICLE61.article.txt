"Why do supposedly intelligent
women still gaze down, enrap
tured, at some thug in football
clothes and say 'I do wish Tiny
would send in Bill—he sits in my
history section and he has the
cutest profile*?" asked Annalee
Whitmore in 1935.
Miss Whitmore also pondered
the "dizzy dame on your right
who chooses the moment when
the hon?e team is on the two-yard
line, third down, and Grayson
taking the ball on a line plunge,
to apply lipstick."
Gone are the days when a
fancy femme felt duty-bound to
attend games clad as for a tea
and leaving brains behind her,
said Miss Whitmore, but she
questioned the grid "savoir-faire"
of the female contingent at the
Big Game.
