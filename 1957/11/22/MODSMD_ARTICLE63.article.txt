## Prince Lightfoot Is Yurok Indian 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Many schools have mascots
who aren't the least authentic.
They wear masks for a time but
after the game or rally, that's it.
Stanford is lucky to be able to
claim a real, live, authentic In
dian as its symbol of good luck-—
| Piince Lightfoot.
Lightfoot first performed for
j Stanford in the 1951 Big Game
i Rally. At that time he was so
impressed by the school spirit and
good sportsmanship expressed by
the student body 1hat he offered
to be at the school's disposal in
the future.
The following year Ilally Com
j asked him to participate in the
rally preceding opening of 1he
football season; from then on he
was really in. Students entluisi
j astically acclaimed the value of
Prince Lightfoot as a mascot, and
I he began going to all the games,
even traveling.
lurok Dances
He has been, at most Stanford
games since, performing the ac
tual tribal dances lie learned as a
member of the Yurok tribe. His
dance rituals are authentic and
as close to the real thing as pos
sible with American march music.
; Each dance is appropriate to
that particular part of the game,
and dances include symbolizing
swiftness and power. The final
dance, always given with the
Alma Mater, symbolizes endur
ance.
Lightfoot's beautifully worked,
handmade Indian garb includes
furs of mink and ermine which
he himself trapped. Each design
on his leather costume has a sym
bolic meaning. For instance, dou
ble arrows mean good luck; brok
en arrows symbolize, peace.
Tim Williams
Prince Lightfoot is known to
his everyday acquaintances as
Tim Williams, a 33-year-old resi
dent of Kcntfield. In everyday
life, he is a longshoreman's clerk
and a long-time Stanford fan.
For 20 years Lightfoot lived
with his tribe in the Klamath
area in northern California, li
was here that he learned his
dances and the Indian customs of
his ancestors. It was also here
that he learned the history of his
family—of his great-grandfather,
who killed six white soldiers with
bow and arrow when they first
invaded the Yurok territory.
When Lightfoot was 20 lie left
the tribe to go to the University
of San Francisco. He has revisit
ed his old home every summer

since. 1-Ie is now eligible to be
come Chief Lightfoot in his tribe,
which numbers 33,000 members
in Del Norte County.
Lightfoot has completely volun
teered his services; ho pays all his
expenses. lie travels with the
team in semi-Indian garb consist
ing of headband with three feath
ers on the back and a beaded
collar.
Out-of-town Stanford fans al
ways look forward enthusiasti
cally to seeing Prince Lightfoot
again. When he went to the Rice
game he visited a children's hos
pital in Houston and did dances
for the youngsters dressed in his
red - and • white costume — Stan
ford's as well as his trade-mark.
Indeed, t h i s outfit publicizes
Stanford all over, even on busy
Eayshore on days of Stanford
games. For Prince Light foot, who
drives a bright red Mercury con
vertible, comes to games in full
regalia, galloping down Bayshore
with the top down. Have you ever
seen an Indian racing past you on
the highway? It's not an illusion,
really.
