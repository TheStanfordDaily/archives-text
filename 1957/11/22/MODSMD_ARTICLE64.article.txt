# 1951 Produces All-American, Coach of Year
## 
### 
All-American end Bill McColl
and quarterback Gary Kerkorian
—two of Stanford's most talented
players in recent seasons—were
on the losing side in their final
Big Game in 1951.
The Bears upset Stanford, 201,
to snap a nine-game win streak,
and then lilinois thrashed the
Cardinals, 40-7, in the Rose Bowl.
It was Coach Chuck Taylor's
first season as head coach and
the then 31-year-old mentor was
named Coach of the Year in the
process.
McColl and Kerkorian later
played professional football Mc-
Coll with the Chicago Bears and
Kerkorian with the Pittsburgh
Steelers and the Baltimore Colts.
Both are still professional men.
Kerkorian is a lawyer while Mc-
Coll is a physician.
Incidentally, Johnny Olszewski
played a big part in the Cal up
set and still makes his living as
a pro gridder, playing for the
Chicago Cardinals at fullback.
