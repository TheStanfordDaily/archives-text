# CAL FENCE PROVIDED 1902 LUMBER
## Bonfire Has Stormy History; Frosh Construct Annual Pyre 
### Morrie Hodges 
The Class of 1961 proved its or
ganization, spirit and initiative
when one of the oldest Stanford
traditions, the freshman Bonfire,
was set off last night at the La
gunita dry lake bed.
The task was greater for this
class than ever before, because
thoy were allowed to start col
lecting wood for the fire only the
day before the Big Game Rally.
In previous years, with the Bon
fire prepared up to two weeks
ahead of time, tradition has been
carried out in different ways, but
the spirit attending the rally has
remained the same.
Since 1902, the year of the first
freshman Bonfire, the frosh class
has showed its strength in light
ing the fire as its first cooperative
effort.
In 1902, five years after the
Axe was stolen by Cal, Stanford
retaliated by seizing the "Big C"
fence, a symbol as important to
the Bears as the Axe is to Ihe In
dians. This fence was burned on
the baseball field in one of the
first annual bonfires before the
Big Game of that year.
Serpentine
In all the early years of Big
Game rivalry, the rally has in
eluded an all-campus serpentine
through Quad to the site of the
fire. A 1922 Daily tells of a "mad
serpentine about the Bonfire, with
thousands of spectators looking
on," and the defiant roar "To hell
with the Gold and Blue!"
One of the first serpentines was
the result of great spirit following
the first games of strong rivalry
between Stanford and Cal. In 1905
tii e strongest feelings started
when Stanford had a new football
field and wanted to bo sure that
the Bears had no chance to do a
victory dance on. it.
The first known symbol burned
in the yearly fire was in 1918,
when a figure of a Californian in
Blue and Gold was fashioned and
hung at the top of the Bonfire.
Especially in the most recent
years there have been violent
raids by Cal men or impostors in
an attempt to start the Bonfire
before the rally. Previously this
was prevented by allowing stu
dents at the fire only if they had
red entrance tickets.
Formerly 200 Feet
Although fires have reached
heights of 200 feet, as in 1948, the
freshmen are to be commended
on last night's pyre of 50 feet,
because this is the first year they
have been given only one day to
prepare the fire.
This restriction was effected in
order to keep the time of guard
ing the Bonfire at a minimum
and to reduce the chances of it
being set off too soon.
Last year was only the second
year that the fire has been suc
cessfully started prematurely.
There were no raids by Cal, be
cause an official truce was de
clared.
However, the Class of 1960 was
attacked-by upperclass Stanford
officers, by football players and
by Menlo Park and Palo Alto stu
dents. The raids got out of hand,
and the Bonfire was almost called
off when an entire truck was de
stroyed.


HELL, FIRE ANI) BURNT BEAR—Since 185)8
Stanford students have been burning Oskie, the
Cal mascot, atop a carefully collected, protected

and then set aflame pile of wood. The Big Had
Bear has burned again — and Stanford hearts
were warmed.

the baseball field in one of the
first annual bonfires before the
Big Game of that year.
Serpentine
In all the early years of Big
Game rivalry, the rally has in
eluded an all-campus serpentine
through Quad to the site of the
fire. A 1922 Daily tells of a "mad
serpentine about the Bonfire, with
thousands of spectators looking
on," and the defiant roar "To hell
with the Gold and Blue!"
One of the first serpentines was
the result of great spirit following
the first games of strong rivalry
between Stanford and Cal. In 1905
tii e strongest feelings started
when Stanford had a new football
field and wanted to bo sure that
the Bears had no chance to do a
victory dance on. it.
The first known symbol burned
in the yearly fire was in 1918,
when a figure of a Californian in
Blue and Gold was fashioned and
hung at the top of the Bonfire.
Especially in the most recent
years there have been violent
raids by Cal men or impostors in
an attempt to start the Bonfire
before the rally. Previously this
was prevented by allowing stu
dents at the fire only if they had
red entrance tickets.
Formerly 200 Feet
Although fires have reached
heights of 200 feet, as in 1948, the
freshmen are to be commended
on last night's pyre of 50 feet,
because this is the first year they
have been given only one day to
prepare the fire.
This restriction was effected in
order to keep the time of guard
ing the Bonfire at a minimum
and to reduce the chances of it
being set off too soon.
Last year was only the second
year that the fire has been suc
cessfully started prematurely.
There were no raids by Cal, be
cause an official truce was de
clared.
However, the Class of 1960 was
attacked-by upperclass Stanford
officers, by football players and
by Menlo Park and Palo Alto stu
dents. The raids got out of hand,
and the Bonfire was almost called
off when an entire truck was de
stroyed.


HELL, FIRE ANI) BURNT BEAR—Since 185)8
Stanford students have been burning Oskie, the
Cal mascot, atop a carefully collected, protected

and then set aflame pile of wood. The Big Had
Bear has burned again — and Stanford hearts
were warmed.
The Class of 1961 proved its or
ganization, spirit and initiative
when one of the oldest Stanford
traditions, the freshman Bonfire,
was set off last night at the La
gunita dry lake bed.
The task was greater for this
class than ever before, because
thoy were allowed to start col
lecting wood for the fire only the
day before the Big Game Rally.
In previous years, with the Bon
fire prepared up to two weeks
ahead of time, tradition has been
carried out in different ways, but
the spirit attending the rally has
remained the same.
Since 1902, the year of the first
freshman Bonfire, the frosh class
has showed its strength in light
ing the fire as its first cooperative
effort.
In 1902, five years after the
Axe was stolen by Cal, Stanford
retaliated by seizing the "Big C"
fence, a symbol as important to
the Bears as the Axe is to Ihe In
dians. This fence was burned on
the baseball field in one of the
first annual bonfires before the
Big Game of that year.
