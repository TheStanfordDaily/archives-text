# THE
						AXE COMES HOME!
## Al's PAT's Give Taylor His Last Victory, 14-12 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs
| by Shea and McMillin brought
Stanford to the Bear five in 10
plays. But then the fumble favor
was returned as McMillin lost the
ball slanting over the right side
i of the Cal line.
A penalty against Joe Kapp for
; passing while he was beyond the
line of scrimmage nullified a 30-
1 yard gainer for the Bears seven


BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.
