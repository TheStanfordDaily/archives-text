# THE 						AXE COMES HOME!
## Al's PAT's Give Taylor His Last Victory, 14-12 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs
| by Shea and McMillin brought
Stanford to the Bear five in 10
plays. But then the fumble favor
was returned as McMillin lost the
ball slanting over the right side
i of the Cal line.
A penalty against Joe Kapp for
; passing while he was beyond the
line of scrimmage nullified a 30-
1 yard gainer for the Bears seven


BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

HE ALMOST GOT AWAY—Fori McMillin (42) fielded a punt on
his own eight-yard line and raced 51 yards up the left, sidelines
before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.

plays later, and the eventual los
ers were forced to punt.
On Stanford's first play after
ihe kick, Darrell Roberts made
like it was 1956 all over again.
The Cal halfback picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian
47 before he was stopped. Last
year, he had done virtually the
same thing on the last play of the
first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a
good one, and was hauled in by
McMillin on the Stanford eight.
He went from his light to his
left and fooled the Bear defend
ers with a fake reverse to Shea.
McMillin then whipped up the
left sideline behind a wall of
blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMil
lin was hit 51 yards later at Ber
keley's 41.
Seven Plays Later
Then: Shea for 5 and 15; Mc-
Millin for 3 and Shea for 3; end
of first quarter; Shea for 4;
Douglas on a sneak for 2; pass
over Stein's head in the end zone.

Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes
to his left. Proverb Jacobs is
shaken off; Terry Jones misses
the tackle; Kapp hits Shea head
on, but Shea plows through him;
Hank Olguin tries for the tackle,
and he's pulled into the end zone
by Shea as the Cards get their six
points.
Enter Harrington, and the sev
enth point goes on the score
board.
After the kickoff, the Bears got
to the Indian 37 before Jack Tay
lor batted down a fourth-flown
pass. Cal next got the ball on
their 20 following a Shea punt
(lie did the kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plaj's
later, the score was 7-0. The keys
were a 16-yarder by Jack Yerman,
12 (Hi a delay by Roberts, and a
23 - yard Gabe Arrillaga - to - Ron
Currie pass that put the ball on
the Stanford 3. Roberts got the
score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.
Freis and Taylor worked a nifty
maneuver designed to fox the Cal
end ,and it worked as number 80
broke through in lime to block

the kick with his hand.
Cal got close at the end of the
half, hut Hart dropped a pass
right in his arms at the Indian
four. They tried for a field goal
with 17 seconds left, but Max
Hale's attempt hit right on the
goal line.
\layl>e a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make
a rout of the thing. In 4:06, the
Cards moved 73 yards to another
seven points. The long • gainer
was a 16-yard keeper by Douglas
that bailed the Indians out of a
15-to-go situation. Douglas also
had the honor of scoring the final
Stanford touchdown of the year,
sneaking the three inches.
Enter Harrington again, and
another perfect kick put the Tay
lormen ahead by eight.
Nolhing too much happened
for the next 22 minutes, with the
; exception of a Stanford drive that
moved to the UC nine. Three
losses and two penalties killed it
fast, and Shea wound up punting
on fourth-and-40.
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found
itself on Stanford's 44 following
! an 11-yard-run by Hart and a 19-
yard pass from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three, j
i Kapp dropped way back to pass, j
; Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola I
all alone at the 15. Glagola eluded j
| Shea at ihe three, and suddenly |
i the game was plenty close. It :
didn't get any closer, though, as !
Protiva blocked the conversion j
| try.
California never did get their
hands on the ball again. An out
j side-kick attempt failed as the
i boot didn't go 10 yards, and the
| Tribe took over.
Still Moved
Ostensibly trying to just run
' out the remaining 3:22, the In
dians still moved relentlessly to
ward the goal. They got all the
way to the one as Douglas flipped i
to Stein on third-and-10.
By now. there were only 10 sec-1
onds left to play, and a good part |
of the 91,000 were surrounding |
. the playing field. Time out even j
i had to he called to keep the fans j
j from shaking down the goal
I posts.
Time in, and Douglas went into
J ihe line on a sneak. As he went .
forward, the fans swarmed all |
over the field. Finally, after a
j three - minute wait, the officials;
announced that Douglas was six
inches short of the .score. But
how could they know with the
mob on the field?
But 14-12 or 20-12 or 21-12, the'
result was the same: The Axe is 1
where it belongs.


HIS KICKING lill) IT —Al Harrington boots the first of two
PAT's that proved the winning margin in Stanford's- 14-12 Bifi
Game win over Cal Saturday. Harrington, who broke his jaw two
weeks ago, came off the bench, wired jaw and all, to do the hoot
ing. lie had learned just before the opening kickoff that he would
handle the conversion job.

The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs
| by Shea and McMillin brought
Stanford to the Bear five in 10
plays. But then the fumble favor
was returned as McMillin lost the
ball slanting over the right side
i of the Cal line.
A penalty against Joe Kapp for
; passing while he was beyond the
line of scrimmage nullified a 30-
1 yard gainer for the Bears seven


BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

HE ALMOST GOT AWAY—Fori McMillin (42) fielded a punt on
his own eight-yard line and raced 51 yards up the left, sidelines
before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.
—Daily Photo by Herb Warwick
plays later, and the eventual los
ers were forced to punt.
On Stanford's first play after
ihe kick, Darrell Roberts made
like it was 1956 all over again.
The Cal halfback picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian
47 before he was stopped. Last
year, he had done virtually the
same thing on the last play of the
first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a
good one, and was hauled in by
McMillin on the Stanford eight.
He went from his light to his
left and fooled the Bear defend
ers with a fake reverse to Shea.
McMillin then whipped up the
left sideline behind a wall of
blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMil
lin was hit 51 yards later at Ber
keley's 41.
Seven Plays Later
Then: Shea for 5 and 15; Mc-
Millin for 3 and Shea for 3; end
of first quarter; Shea for 4;
Douglas on a sneak for 2; pass
over Stein's head in the end zone.

Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes
to his left. Proverb Jacobs is
shaken off; Terry Jones misses
the tackle; Kapp hits Shea head
on, but Shea plows through him;
Hank Olguin tries for the tackle,
and he's pulled into the end zone
by Shea as the Cards get their six
points.
Enter Harrington, and the sev
enth point goes on the score
board.
After the kickoff, the Bears got
to the Indian 37 before Jack Tay
lor batted down a fourth-flown
pass. Cal next got the ball on
their 20 following a Shea punt
(lie did the kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plaj's
later, the score was 7-0. The keys
were a 16-yarder by Jack Yerman,
12 (Hi a delay by Roberts, and a
23 - yard Gabe Arrillaga - to - Ron
Currie pass that put the ball on
the Stanford 3. Roberts got the
score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.
Freis and Taylor worked a nifty
maneuver designed to fox the Cal
end ,and it worked as number 80
broke through in lime to block

the kick with his hand.
Cal got close at the end of the
half, hut Hart dropped a pass
right in his arms at the Indian
four. They tried for a field goal
with 17 seconds left, but Max
Hale's attempt hit right on the
goal line.
\layl>e a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make
a rout of the thing. In 4:06, the
Cards moved 73 yards to another
seven points. The long • gainer
was a 16-yard keeper by Douglas
that bailed the Indians out of a
15-to-go situation. Douglas also
had the honor of scoring the final
Stanford touchdown of the year,
sneaking the three inches.
Enter Harrington again, and
another perfect kick put the Tay
lormen ahead by eight.
Nolhing too much happened
for the next 22 minutes, with the
; exception of a Stanford drive that
moved to the UC nine. Three
losses and two penalties killed it
fast, and Shea wound up punting
on fourth-and-40.
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found
itself on Stanford's 44 following
! an 11-yard-run by Hart and a 19-
yard pass from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three, j
i Kapp dropped way back to pass, j
; Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola I
all alone at the 15. Glagola eluded j
| Shea at ihe three, and suddenly |
i the game was plenty close. It :
didn't get any closer, though, as !

score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.
Freis and Taylor worked a nifty
maneuver designed to fox the Cal
end ,and it worked as number 80
broke through in lime to block

the kick with his hand.
Cal got close at the end of the
half, hut Hart dropped a pass
right in his arms at the Indian
four. They tried for a field goal
with 17 seconds left, but Max
Hale's attempt hit right on the
goal line.
\layl>e a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make
a rout of the thing. In 4:06, the
Cards moved 73 yards to another
seven points. The long • gainer
was a 16-yard keeper by Douglas
that bailed the Indians out of a
15-to-go situation. Douglas also
had the honor of scoring the final
Stanford touchdown of the year,
sneaking the three inches.
Enter Harrington again, and
another perfect kick put the Tay
lormen ahead by eight.
Nolhing too much happened
for the next 22 minutes, with the
; exception of a Stanford drive that
moved to the UC nine. Three
losses and two penalties killed it
fast, and Shea wound up punting
on fourth-and-40.
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found
itself on Stanford's 44 following
! an 11-yard-run by Hart and a 19-
yard pass from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three, j
i Kapp dropped way back to pass, j
; Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola I
all alone at the 15. Glagola eluded j
| Shea at ihe three, and suddenly |
i the game was plenty close. It :
didn't get any closer, though, as !
Protiva blocked the conversion j
| try.
California never did get their
hands on the ball again. An out
j side-kick attempt failed as the
i boot didn't go 10 yards, and the
| Tribe took over.
Still Moved
Ostensibly trying to just run
' out the remaining 3:22, the In
dians still moved relentlessly to
ward the goal. They got all the
way to the one as Douglas flipped i
to Stein on third-and-10.
By now. there were only 10 sec-1
onds left to play, and a good part |
of the 91,000 were surrounding |
. the playing field. Time out even j
i had to he called to keep the fans j
j from shaking down the goal
I posts.
Time in, and Douglas went into
J ihe line on a sneak. As he went .
forward, the fans swarmed all |
over the field. Finally, after a
j three - minute wait, the officials;
announced that Douglas was six
inches short of the .score. But
how could they know with the
mob on the field?
But 14-12 or 20-12 or 21-12, the'
result was the same: The Axe is 1
where it belongs.

The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs
| by Shea and McMillin brought
Stanford to the Bear five in 10
plays. But then the fumble favor
was returned as McMillin lost the
ball slanting over the right side
i of the Cal line.
A penalty against Joe Kapp for
; passing while he was beyond the
line of scrimmage nullified a 30-
1 yard gainer for the Bears seven


BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

HE ALMOST GOT AWAY—Fori McMillin (42) fielded a punt on
his own eight-yard line and raced 51 yards up the left, sidelines
before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.
—Daily Photo by Herb Warwick
plays later, and the eventual los
ers were forced to punt.
On Stanford's first play after
ihe kick, Darrell Roberts made
like it was 1956 all over again.
The Cal halfback picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian
47 before he was stopped. Last
year, he had done virtually the
same thing on the last play of the
first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a
good one, and was hauled in by
McMillin on the Stanford eight.
He went from his light to his
left and fooled the Bear defend
ers with a fake reverse to Shea.
McMillin then whipped up the
left sideline behind a wall of
blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMil
lin was hit 51 yards later at Ber
keley's 41.
Seven Plays Later
Then: Shea for 5 and 15; Mc-
Millin for 3 and Shea for 3; end
of first quarter; Shea for 4;
Douglas on a sneak for 2; pass
over Stein's head in the end zone.

Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes
to his left. Proverb Jacobs is
shaken off; Terry Jones misses
the tackle; Kapp hits Shea head
on, but Shea plows through him;
Hank Olguin tries for the tackle,
and he's pulled into the end zone
by Shea as the Cards get their six
points.
Enter Harrington, and the sev
enth point goes on the score
board.
After the kickoff, the Bears got
to the Indian 37 before Jack Tay
lor batted down a fourth-flown
pass. Cal next got the ball on
their 20 following a Shea punt
(lie did the kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plaj's
later, the score was 7-0. The keys
were a 16-yarder by Jack Yerman,
12 (Hi a delay by Roberts, and a
23 - yard Gabe Arrillaga - to - Ron
Currie pass that put the ball on
the Stanford 3. Roberts got the
score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.

get a first down. The kick was a
good one, and was hauled in by
McMillin on the Stanford eight.
He went from his light to his
left and fooled the Bear defend
ers with a fake reverse to Shea.
McMillin then whipped up the
left sideline behind a wall of
blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMil
lin was hit 51 yards later at Ber
keley's 41.
Seven Plays Later
Then: Shea for 5 and 15; Mc-
Millin for 3 and Shea for 3; end
of first quarter; Shea for 4;
Douglas on a sneak for 2; pass
over Stein's head in the end zone.

Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes
to his left. Proverb Jacobs is
shaken off; Terry Jones misses
the tackle; Kapp hits Shea head
on, but Shea plows through him;
Hank Olguin tries for the tackle,
and he's pulled into the end zone
by Shea as the Cards get their six
points.
Enter Harrington, and the sev
enth point goes on the score
board.
After the kickoff, the Bears got
to the Indian 37 before Jack Tay
lor batted down a fourth-flown
pass. Cal next got the ball on
their 20 following a Shea punt
(lie did the kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plaj's
later, the score was 7-0. The keys
were a 16-yarder by Jack Yerman,
12 (Hi a delay by Roberts, and a
23 - yard Gabe Arrillaga - to - Ron
Currie pass that put the ball on
the Stanford 3. Roberts got the
score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.
Freis and Taylor worked a nifty
maneuver designed to fox the Cal
end ,and it worked as number 80
broke through in lime to block

the kick with his hand.
Cal got close at the end of the
half, hut Hart dropped a pass
right in his arms at the Indian
four. They tried for a field goal
with 17 seconds left, but Max
Hale's attempt hit right on the
goal line.
\layl>e a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make
a rout of the thing. In 4:06, the
Cards moved 73 yards to another
seven points. The long • gainer
was a 16-yard keeper by Douglas
that bailed the Indians out of a
15-to-go situation. Douglas also
had the honor of scoring the final
Stanford touchdown of the year,
sneaking the three inches.
Enter Harrington again, and
another perfect kick put the Tay
lormen ahead by eight.
Nolhing too much happened
for the next 22 minutes, with the
; exception of a Stanford drive that
moved to the UC nine. Three
losses and two penalties killed it
fast, and Shea wound up punting
on fourth-and-40.
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found
itself on Stanford's 44 following
! an 11-yard-run by Hart and a 19-
yard pass from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three, j
i Kapp dropped way back to pass, j
; Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola I
all alone at the 15. Glagola eluded j
| Shea at ihe three, and suddenly |
i the game was plenty close. It :
didn't get any closer, though, as !
Protiva blocked the conversion j
| try.
California never did get their
hands on the ball again. An out
j side-kick attempt failed as the
i boot didn't go 10 yards, and the
| Tribe took over.
Still Moved
Ostensibly trying to just run
' out the remaining 3:22, the In
dians still moved relentlessly to
ward the goal. They got all the
way to the one as Douglas flipped i
to Stein on third-and-10.
By now. there were only 10 sec-1
onds left to play, and a good part |
of the 91,000 were surrounding |
. the playing field. Time out even j
i had to he called to keep the fans j
j from shaking down the goal
I posts.
Time in, and Douglas went into
J ihe line on a sneak. As he went .
forward, the fans swarmed all |
over the field. Finally, after a
j three - minute wait, the officials;
announced that Douglas was six
inches short of the .score. But
how could they know with the
mob on the field?
But 14-12 or 20-12 or 21-12, the'
result was the same: The Axe is 1
where it belongs.


HIS KICKING lill) IT —Al Harrington boots the first of two
PAT's that proved the winning margin in Stanford's- 14-12 Bifi

weeks ago, came off the bench, wired jaw and all, to do the hoot

The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs
| by Shea and McMillin brought
Stanford to the Bear five in 10
plays. But then the fumble favor
was returned as McMillin lost the
ball slanting over the right side
i of the Cal line.
A penalty against Joe Kapp for
; passing while he was beyond the
line of scrimmage nullified a 30-
1 yard gainer for the Bears seven


BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

HE ALMOST GOT AWAY—Fori McMillin (42) fielded a punt on
his own eight-yard line and raced 51 yards up the left, sidelines
before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.

plays later, and the eventual los
ers were forced to punt.
On Stanford's first play after
ihe kick, Darrell Roberts made
like it was 1956 all over again.
The Cal halfback picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian
47 before he was stopped. Last
year, he had done virtually the
same thing on the last play of the
first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a

BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

HE ALMOST GOT AWAY—Fori McMillin (42) fielded a punt on
his own eight-yard line and raced 51 yards up the left, sidelines
before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.

plays later, and the eventual los
ers were forced to punt.
On Stanford's first play after
ihe kick, Darrell Roberts made
like it was 1956 all over again.
The Cal halfback picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian
47 before he was stopped. Last
year, he had done virtually the
same thing on the last play of the
first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a
good one, and was hauled in by
McMillin on the Stanford eight.
He went from his light to his
left and fooled the Bear defend
ers with a fake reverse to Shea.
McMillin then whipped up the
left sideline behind a wall of
blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMil
lin was hit 51 yards later at Ber
keley's 41.
Seven Plays Later
Then: Shea for 5 and 15; Mc-
Millin for 3 and Shea for 3; end
of first quarter; Shea for 4;
Douglas on a sneak for 2; pass
over Stein's head in the end zone.

Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes
to his left. Proverb Jacobs is
shaken off; Terry Jones misses
the tackle; Kapp hits Shea head
on, but Shea plows through him;
Hank Olguin tries for the tackle,
and he's pulled into the end zone
by Shea as the Cards get their six
points.
Enter Harrington, and the sev
enth point goes on the score
board.
After the kickoff, the Bears got
to the Indian 37 before Jack Tay
lor batted down a fourth-flown
pass. Cal next got the ball on
their 20 following a Shea punt
(lie did the kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plaj's
later, the score was 7-0. The keys
were a 16-yarder by Jack Yerman,
12 (Hi a delay by Roberts, and a
23 - yard Gabe Arrillaga - to - Ron
Currie pass that put the ball on
the Stanford 3. Roberts got the
score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.
Freis and Taylor worked a nifty
maneuver designed to fox the Cal
end ,and it worked as number 80
broke through in lime to block

the kick with his hand.
Cal got close at the end of the
half, hut Hart dropped a pass
right in his arms at the Indian
four. They tried for a field goal
with 17 seconds left, but Max
Hale's attempt hit right on the
goal line.
\layl>e a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make
a rout of the thing. In 4:06, the
Cards moved 73 yards to another
seven points. The long • gainer
was a 16-yard keeper by Douglas
that bailed the Indians out of a
15-to-go situation. Douglas also
had the honor of scoring the final
Stanford touchdown of the year,
sneaking the three inches.
Enter Harrington again, and
another perfect kick put the Tay
lormen ahead by eight.
Nolhing too much happened
for the next 22 minutes, with the
; exception of a Stanford drive that
moved to the UC nine. Three
losses and two penalties killed it
fast, and Shea wound up punting
on fourth-and-40.
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found
itself on Stanford's 44 following
! an 11-yard-run by Hart and a 19-
yard pass from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three, j
i Kapp dropped way back to pass, j
; Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola I
all alone at the 15. Glagola eluded j
| Shea at ihe three, and suddenly |
i the game was plenty close. It :
didn't get any closer, though, as !
Protiva blocked the conversion j
| try.
California never did get their
hands on the ball again. An out
j side-kick attempt failed as the
i boot didn't go 10 yards, and the
| Tribe took over.
Still Moved
Ostensibly trying to just run
' out the remaining 3:22, the In
dians still moved relentlessly to
ward the goal. They got all the
way to the one as Douglas flipped i
to Stein on third-and-10.
By now. there were only 10 sec-1
onds left to play, and a good part |
of the 91,000 were surrounding |
. the playing field. Time out even j
i had to he called to keep the fans j
j from shaking down the goal
I posts.
Time in, and Douglas went into
J ihe line on a sneak. As he went .
forward, the fans swarmed all |
over the field. Finally, after a
j three - minute wait, the officials;
announced that Douglas was six
inches short of the .score. But
how could they know with the
mob on the field?
But 14-12 or 20-12 or 21-12, the'
result was the same: The Axe is 1
where it belongs.


HIS KICKING lill) IT —Al Harrington boots the first of two
PAT's that proved the winning margin in Stanford's- 14-12 Bifi
Game win over Cal Saturday. Harrington, who broke his jaw two
weeks ago, came off the bench, wired jaw and all, to do the hoot

The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs

And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
rected his team's destiny all afternoon. Joel Freis, who blocked Cal's

first PAT try to provide half the
victory margin. Eric Protiva,
who blocked the second Berkeley
conversion attempt for the other
half. Bob Peterson, who oft-times
smashed the Bear quarterbacks
before they had taken a step back
from center. Jeri McMillin, who
went 54 minutes at two positions
and was number two ball-carrier
for Ihe Cards. Everybody else,
who did everything else as Stan
ford evened the all-time series
record with Cal al 25 wins for
each (cam, plus 10 tics.
Cards Were Favored
Stanford went into the game as
a one - touchdown favorite, but
you couldn't have proved it by
the way the game started. First,
Cal won the coin toss, handing
the Cards only their third set
back of the season in this depart
ment.
Then Jack Hart took the open
ing kickoff on his three and
steamed all the way up to the 42.
He appeared for a moment to be
away, but then Dick Stein caught
him from behind to prevent a
quick six.
Pete Elliott's team met Stan
ford's 5-4 defense with a go-go-go
offense that huddled for only a
| few seconds and just a couple of
i yards behind the line of scrim-
I mage.
Soon Fumbled
Whether or not the speed-up
tactics had anything to do with it,
the Bears moved quickly to the
Indian 36. A long pass labeled
touchdown went incomplete, and
i then Peterson pounced on a fum
ble by Hank Olguin at the Card
31.
A seven-yard pass to Gary Van
Galder sandwiched between runs
| by Shea and McMillin brought
Stanford to the Bear five in 10
plays. But then the fumble favor
was returned as McMillin lost the
ball slanting over the right side
i of the Cal line.
A penalty against Joe Kapp for
; passing while he was beyond the
line of scrimmage nullified a 30-
1 yard gainer for the Bears seven


BREAKING THE ICE —Indian fullback Chuck Shea opened the
scoring' in (lie fiOtli Big Game Saturday as lie bulled and dragged
Ills way nine yards to the Bear end zone. Terry Jones, Proverb
Jacobs, Bob Currie, Joe Kapp and Hank Olguin were among the

Cal men who had a shot at Shea and missed. The Card senior was
the leading ground-gainer of the game as he went for 155 yards
on 27 carries.

HE ALMOST GOT AWAY—Fori McMillin (42) fielded a punt on
his own eight-yard line and raced 51 yards up the left, sidelines
before he was finally collared by Art Forbes (32). The play started
Stanford on its/ first TD march.

plays later, and the eventual los
ers were forced to punt.
On Stanford's first play after
ihe kick, Darrell Roberts made
like it was 1956 all over again.
The Cal halfback picked off a
pass and rambled to the Indian
47 before he was stopped. Last
year, he had done virtually the
same thing on the last play of the
first half.
It didn't do much good, because
Cal had to punt before they could
get a first down. The kick was a
good one, and was hauled in by
McMillin on the Stanford eight.
He went from his light to his
left and fooled the Bear defend
ers with a fake reverse to Shea.
McMillin then whipped up the
left sideline behind a wall of
blockers. But a Cal man got
through the defense and McMil
lin was hit 51 yards later at Ber
keley's 41.
Seven Plays Later
Then: Shea for 5 and 15; Mc-
Millin for 3 and Shea for 3; end
of first quarter; Shea for 4;
Douglas on a sneak for 2; pass
over Stein's head in the end zone.

Second and nine: Shea takes
handoff from Douglas and goes
to his left. Proverb Jacobs is
shaken off; Terry Jones misses
the tackle; Kapp hits Shea head
on, but Shea plows through him;
Hank Olguin tries for the tackle,
and he's pulled into the end zone
by Shea as the Cards get their six
points.
Enter Harrington, and the sev
enth point goes on the score
board.
After the kickoff, the Bears got
to the Indian 37 before Jack Tay
lor batted down a fourth-flown
pass. Cal next got the ball on
their 20 following a Shea punt
(lie did the kicking, too).
Score Tightens
Eighty yards and 15 plaj's
later, the score was 7-0. The keys
were a 16-yarder by Jack Yerman,
12 (Hi a delay by Roberts, and a
23 - yard Gabe Arrillaga - to - Ron
Currie pass that put the ball on
the Stanford 3. Roberts got the
score over right tackle.
Then the conversion attempt.
Freis and Taylor worked a nifty
maneuver designed to fox the Cal
end ,and it worked as number 80
broke through in lime to block

the kick with his hand.
Cal got close at the end of the
half, hut Hart dropped a pass
right in his arms at the Indian
four. They tried for a field goal
with 17 seconds left, but Max
Hale's attempt hit right on the
goal line.
\layl>e a Rout
At the start of the second half,
Stanford appeared ready to make
a rout of the thing. In 4:06, the
Cards moved 73 yards to another
seven points. The long • gainer
was a 16-yard keeper by Douglas
that bailed the Indians out of a
15-to-go situation. Douglas also
had the honor of scoring the final
Stanford touchdown of the year,
sneaking the three inches.
Enter Harrington again, and
another perfect kick put the Tay
lormen ahead by eight.
Nolhing too much happened
for the next 22 minutes, with the
; exception of a Stanford drive that
moved to the UC nine. Three
losses and two penalties killed it
fast, and Shea wound up punting
on fourth-and-40.
Little Time Left
With less than four minutes to
play, the Berkeley crowd found
itself on Stanford's 44 following
! an 11-yard-run by Hart and a 19-
yard pass from Kapp to Hart.
After a buck went for three, j
i Kapp dropped way back to pass, j
; Protiva had him, but Kapp broke
loose and spotted Steve Glagola I
all alone at the 15. Glagola eluded j
| Shea at ihe three, and suddenly |
i the game was plenty close. It :
didn't get any closer, though, as !
Protiva blocked the conversion j
| try.
California never did get their
hands on the ball again. An out
j side-kick attempt failed as the
i boot didn't go 10 yards, and the
| Tribe took over.
Still Moved
Ostensibly trying to just run
' out the remaining 3:22, the In
dians still moved relentlessly to
ward the goal. They got all the
way to the one as Douglas flipped i
to Stein on third-and-10.
By now. there were only 10 sec-1
onds left to play, and a good part |
of the 91,000 were surrounding |
. the playing field. Time out even j
i had to he called to keep the fans j
j from shaking down the goal
I posts.
Time in, and Douglas went into
J ihe line on a sneak. As he went .
forward, the fans swarmed all |
over the field. Finally, after a
j three - minute wait, the officials;
announced that Douglas was six
inches short of the .score. But
how could they know with the
mob on the field?
But 14-12 or 20-12 or 21-12, the'
result was the same: The Axe is 1
where it belongs.


HIS KICKING lill) IT —Al Harrington boots the first of two
PAT's that proved the winning margin in Stanford's- 14-12 Bifi
Game win over Cal Saturday. Harrington, who broke his jaw two
weeks ago, came off the bench, wired jaw and all, to do the hoot
ing. lie had learned just before the opening kickoff that he would
handle the conversion job.

The Axe is home!
Surrounded by the melodrama of a coach's last
game and the heroism of an injured senior who
provided ihe winning points when he wasn't even
supposed to play, the Axe came hack to Stanford
as the Indians won the Big Game from California
before 91,000 fans here Saturday.
The score? Record hooks will show it us 1 1 -112. But so con
fused was the final play of ihe 60th Big Game that no one will
ever know whether the score was really 20-12, or might have
been 21-12.
There were 24 heroes for the victorious Tribe —the 23 men
who played and the man who saw his final game as a coach
Chuck Taylor. And beyond these two dozen was another corps
of Stanford people who played a part in the game —all the way
from the assistant coaches down to the waterbovs and back up
again through the rooting section, yell leaders, pompon girls
and band.
Hut the man to whom ihe victory must have meant the most
had to he Chuck Ta\lor. Two days earlier, the announcement
had been made that Taylor was moving up in athletic department
administration and would not be back to coach in 1958.
So it was his last game. And it was a game he'll never forget.
From the flip of the coin to the final chaos-surrounded play, it
was a good game; certainly not the best game ever played and
not the most thrilling; hut it was a Big Game, and that was enough.
On the field, the most obvious heroes were A 1 Harrington and
Chuck Shea.
If Harrington's story appealed in the movies, it would he re
jected as ridiculous. And maybe it does sound fantastic that the
man who was victim of a conversion defeat only three weeks ago
should return with his broken jaw wired together and kick the two
points that gave his team the victory over its traditional rival.
Then there was Shea—a rags to riches ballplayer if there ever
was one. Last year, he was the fumble-king of Stanford; a runner
who gave every fan the shivers when he carried the ball. Even this
fall, he was thought of so little that not a single official Stanford
picture was taken of him in action.
So where is he now? On the throne as the Pacific Coast Con
ference rushing champion; undoubtedly tho best fullback in the con
ference; and the proud holder of 153 yards he gained in Saturday's
Big Game.
And there are plenty more on the Stanford come-through list:
Jackie Douglas, who played 60 minutes, scored a touchdown, and di
