# Tickled to Death
## 
### 
Btf, Game is over: we won, and everybody is
tickled to death except the defeated minions
from across the bay and their supporters.
\\ hat a week last week was! And what a
climax to win a game on extra points \et!
Stanford still retains its claim as the exciting
and the unpredictable.
Kverything seemed to work out fine, and
most agree that il was a successful week. That
is, all except those minor students picked up
by the ABG during and after the Bear Bust
Thursday night.
The word is that Big Game Gaieties showed
a marked improvement after opening night.
We saw it Wednesday night and must admit
we were agreeably surprised and delighted at
the performance of the cast, orchestra and tech
nicians. Even the dig at The Daily as a com
plaining newspaper which received such great
audience reaction did not dismay us.
Not having attended the Bear Bust I because
of our massive Big Game edition), we cannot
report on that phase of Big Game \\ eek. But
we hear it was successful in attendance, unsuc
cessful so far as the weather and the ABC were
concerned.
The house decoration's were indeed colorful
and a pleasing sight to all. Sigma Clii's sweep
stakes-winning design was certainly worth see
ing. But for subtlety we like Stern I \ *s simple

banner, in rod and white: "T. S. Elliott" (T. S.
means "too sad," doesn't it?).
And, of course, the Bonfire and I lie rally
11"nâ€¢ 11 preceded it were excellent. The Class of
"61 is to he congratulated for its efforts in this
respect. Unfortunately, some juvenile jokers
tossed some water homhs onto the grandstand,
which was decidedly in poor taste.
Even with a chilly night, the turnout was suc
cessful and the fire was indeed heart-warming.
Associate General Secretary James Triolo's ac
count of the Axe history was well done and
evoked much hearty response from the 10.000-
plus audience. And a tribute to a hrave man,
(.;tl*s student body president Roger Samuelson,
for his handling of an obviously biased Stan
ford audience. The crack he made about dve
ing his hair was truly a master stroke.
Then, of course, there was the game with its
card stunts and the band's performance, both
of which were excellent. The only really bad
stunt was the one which had "Stanford"" in
block letters: the"V" and I " were indiscern
ible. The Men's Glee (Hub sounded very good.
But the happiest moment was when the gun
sounded at the end of the game, with the south
goal posts dropping simultaneously and the
whole stadium realizing that the Axe had re
turned again to its rightful home, marking the
end of another great football season.
