"Hp certainly played above what we had hoped ho would," said
University of California coach Pete Elliott of Stanford fullback
Chuck Shea following the Indians' 14-12 win over the Rears in the
60th annual Big Game.
"Shea has got a lot of running ability," the soft-spoken Bear coach

said. "He knows where the holes
are." Shea had ripped through j
California's line for 155 wards
and won the Pacific Coast Con-1
ference rushing championship in :
! the process.
The 30-year-old Elliott looked
no older than his players in his
brown suit and close • cropped i
blond hair. He peeled an orange j
and ate. politely answering the!
questions of a small group of
| reporters.
"It was our best GO minutes
I this season," he said. "I think
! that we played better in spots
I during the season, but I would
; have to .say that it was our best
i complete game."
Although Cal failed to stop the
ground - gobbling Shea and Co.,
, the Rears did hold down Stan
ford's aerial attack — partly be
cause of Indian quarterback
Jackie Douglas' bruised throwing
hand. Elliott, however, was quick
to say: "Stanford's running game
i is almost their No. 1 threat."
Elliott was particularly im
pressed with the play of Indian
guard Bob Peterson and end Gary
Van Galder. "I'm sure Peterson
has played well all season," he
said. "And Van Galder played
well." he continued. '"He did a
very fine job of blocking as well
as on defense."
Smiling sadly, he told the re
porters. "Chuck retires from tho
! point-after-touchdown woes and I
| pick them up." Two blocked con
version attempts and a missed
field goal had nullified a Bear tie
or victory. It was Cal's ninth loss
1 in 10 games.
Elliott talked to his 1.3 seniors
| individually after the game be
| fore holding the press session.
"You become awfully close on a
! football squad," he explained, "a
lot closer than most people."
"We'll have gained next season
| --1 certainly hope from experi-
I ence," he said. "Another spring
practice, another fall practice and
we'll be farther ahead individu
[ ally." Then he squared his jaw,
i "Cal can improve I'm banking
I on that belief."

i "Cal can improve I'm banking
I on that belief."
"Hp certainly played above what we had hoped ho would," said
University of California coach Pete Elliott of Stanford fullback
Chuck Shea following the Indians' 14-12 win over the Rears in the
60th annual Big Game.
"Shea has got a lot of running ability," the soft-spoken Bear coach

said. "He knows where the holes
are." Shea had ripped through j
California's line for 155 wards
and won the Pacific Coast Con-1
ference rushing championship in :
! the process.
The 30-year-old Elliott looked
no older than his players in his
brown suit and close • cropped i
blond hair. He peeled an orange j
and ate. politely answering the!
questions of a small group of
| reporters.
"It was our best GO minutes
I this season," he said. "I think
! that we played better in spots
I during the season, but I would
; have to .say that it was our best
i complete game."
Although Cal failed to stop the
ground - gobbling Shea and Co.,
, the Rears did hold down Stan
ford's aerial attack — partly be
cause of Indian quarterback
Jackie Douglas' bruised throwing
hand. Elliott, however, was quick
to say: "Stanford's running game
i is almost their No. 1 threat."
Elliott was particularly im
pressed with the play of Indian
guard Bob Peterson and end Gary
Van Galder. "I'm sure Peterson
has played well all season," he
said. "And Van Galder played
well." he continued. '"He did a
very fine job of blocking as well
as on defense."
Smiling sadly, he told the re
porters. "Chuck retires from tho
! point-after-touchdown woes and I
| pick them up." Two blocked con
version attempts and a missed
field goal had nullified a Bear tie
or victory. It was Cal's ninth loss
1 in 10 games.
Elliott talked to his 1.3 seniors
| individually after the game be
| fore holding the press session.
"You become awfully close on a
! football squad," he explained, "a
lot closer than most people."
"We'll have gained next season
| --1 certainly hope from experi-
I ence," he said. "Another spring
practice, another fall practice and
we'll be farther ahead individu
[ ally." Then he squared his jaw,
