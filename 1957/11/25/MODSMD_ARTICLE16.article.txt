# Bear Players Dejected After Loss to Cards
## 
### Bill Milam 
A sad University of California
football team gathered in the :
south dressing room Saturday
following a 14-12 loss to Stanford
in the Big Game.
They had equaled the Indians j
in touchdowns scored and yet had
lost the game by failing to con- j
vert after their two scoresâ€”an !
old Stanford trick.
And although the Bears had j
fought hard, they had no feeling i
of moral victory.
The extra points were not ;
missed because of technical er- i
rors, according to California j
quarterback Joe Kapp. Kapp felt ;
that the Indians "just came up j
with extra fine play at those
times."
Kapp called Indian quarterback '
Jackie Douglas "the best player j
on the field for Stanford." The j
0-2, 200-pound junior Cal signal-j
caller felt Stanford played about '
the same game as they had last
year. "They controlled the ball
more this year, however," Kapp J
pointed out.
The Bears clip-clopped through ;
the gravel pathway to the dress-j
ing room and shrugged off youth
ful autograph seekers. They ap
peared down-hearted, but there
| were no tears .shed.
End Steve Glagola, who caught
a 41-yard touchdown pass in the
| closing minutes of the fourth
quarter, was one of the happier i
Bears.
His catch was a masterpiece of
coincidence. '"The play was not
a set play," Glagola said. "I
blocked by man and then ran
down field to pick up a defensive
man. When I turned back toward
| the line, the ball was coming to
ward me."
The pitch put the Bears back
in the game with less than four
minutes to go in the final quar
ter, and as Glagola said, "the ball
hit me right in the bread basket.
I wanted the touchdown so bad I
could taste it."
There were no yells of '"Wait
' till next year" by the Bear play-
I ers, but a feeling of intense de
| sire for revenge pervaded the at
mosphere. The Bears will lose 13
; seniors, but a flock of experi
enced hands will return and the
next Big Game will be no picnic,
j either.
