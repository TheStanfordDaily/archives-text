# Victorious Tribe Happy, Quiet. Relieved
## 
### 
They were happy, all right, bul !
they weren't loud. They looked
like they were glad it was all
over, and in fact they were. In
fact, it was quiet enough to hear
an axe drop. if the trophy hadn't
been whisked oft to a bank some-1
where.
One got the impression that j
Stanford's tribe was silently!
counting its blessings, two of j
them. For the extra points which !
returned ihe Axe to The Farm |
are the same extra points that,!
earlier this season, caused a bit of j
heartache and headache.
Halfback A1 Harrington was
late getting to the dressing room, |
and when he appeared he had a i
lei around his neck, the gift ol j
some friends from Hawaii. "1 am
happy that we could win ii for ]
Chuck," he said.
It was Harrington who actually ,
booted the Indians to victory, but,
in his words, "we sure expected
to win by more than PAT's. In
| the process of kicking them, I
never thought they'd be what we'd
; win by.
Pre-Ganie Word
"I gQt the word that I'd be kick
■ ing right, after we got on the field.
1 wasn't at all worried about my
i jaw; 1 just wanted to kick." Ques
tioned about his future, Harring
ton mentioned pro ball. "I'd like
to go to pro tyall very, very much."
Jack Douglas' capsule analysis
of Cal's pass defending was a
post'game center of interest. "At
first they gave us the wide stuff,"
the quarterback said; "they were
i covering the receivers. Then 1hey
j came up closer, so the short stuff
was good."
His center plunge at the end of
' the game was a close one, he be-
J lieves. "No ref could have called
I it with that crowd in on us. I
might have made it; I don't know,
j 1 just couldn't say. It's not like
j we were just eating up time; we
i were going for that third touch
; down."
Shea's Best
Powering fullback Chuck Shea,
j seated on a bench with blood trick
ling down his nose, noted that "it
! was the best game I ever had.
; When I got hit on the head there.
! I was out for 10 seconds, it seems.
I didn't know where I was."
End Joel Freis was quick to
praise co-captain Douglas. "I think
i he again proved himself a real
fine leader," Freis noted.
Coach Dutch Fell ring was on
'hand to offer that, while it was
"not our best game, it'll certainly
; do. Defensively I'd say it was our
j best, but offensively we've had
1 much better."
Meister Pleased
Former California assistant
! coach Herm Meister, who watched
his first Big Game from the Stan
1 ford side, felt "very good, thank
I you," about beating his former
j school.
Coach Pelc Kmetovic thought
Stanford was "more than two
points better than Cal, but we
won, so I feel good. I always feel
good when we win a Big Game."
Saturday's field phone assign
in e n t was drawn by assistant
coach George Lynn. Asked how
the game looked to him, Lynn
answered: "I couldn't see much
i outstanding in the line. Shea
looked real good, but I guess they

all must have been good."
And thev were real champi

ons. Champions of Gamo. any
way.

Coach Dutch Fell ring was on
'hand to offer that, while it was
"not our best game, it'll certainly

Meister Pleased
Former California assistant
! coach Herm Meister, who watched
his first Big Game from the Stan
1 ford side, felt "very good, thank
I you," about beating his former
j school.
Coach Pelc Kmetovic thought
Stanford was "more than two
points better than Cal, but we
won, so I feel good. I always feel
good when we win a Big Game."
Saturday's field phone assign
in e n t was drawn by assistant
coach George Lynn. Asked how
the game looked to him, Lynn
answered: "I couldn't see much
i outstanding in the line. Shea
looked real good, but I guess they

all must have been good."
And thev were real champi

ons. Champions of Gamo. any
way.
They were happy, all right, bul !
they weren't loud. They looked
like they were glad it was all
over, and in fact they were. In
fact, it was quiet enough to hear
an axe drop. if the trophy hadn't
been whisked oft to a bank some-1
where.
One got the impression that j
Stanford's tribe was silently!
counting its blessings, two of j
them. For the extra points which !
returned ihe Axe to The Farm |
are the same extra points that,!
earlier this season, caused a bit of j
heartache and headache.
Halfback A1 Harrington was
late getting to the dressing room, |
and when he appeared he had a i
lei around his neck, the gift ol j
some friends from Hawaii. "1 am
happy that we could win ii for ]
Chuck," he said.
It was Harrington who actually ,
booted the Indians to victory, but,
in his words, "we sure expected
to win by more than PAT's. In
| the process of kicking them, I
never thought they'd be what we'd
; win by.

"I gQt the word that I'd be kick

1 wasn't at all worried about my
i jaw; 1 just wanted to kick." Ques
tioned about his future, Harring
ton mentioned pro ball. "I'd like
to go to pro tyall very, very much."
Jack Douglas' capsule analysis
of Cal's pass defending was a
post'game center of interest. "At
first they gave us the wide stuff,"
the quarterback said; "they were
i covering the receivers. Then 1hey
j came up closer, so the short stuff
was good."
His center plunge at the end of
' the game was a close one, he be-
J lieves. "No ref could have called
I it with that crowd in on us. I
might have made it; I don't know,
j 1 just couldn't say. It's not like
j we were just eating up time; we
i were going for that third touch
; down."
Shea's Best

j seated on a bench with blood trick
ling down his nose, noted that "it
! was the best game I ever had.
; When I got hit on the head there.

I didn't know where I was."
