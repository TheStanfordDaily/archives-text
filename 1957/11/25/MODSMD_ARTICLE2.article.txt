# RIOT AT ROSSOTTI'S
## Big Crowd Causes Bigger Rumors 
### Rich Brown Associate Editor 
Beginning with the Bonfire
Thursday night, there were a few
drinks, a few drunks, a few wild
stories—and by yesterday there
were sky-high rumors which had
Kossotti's "demolished" in the
wake of a gigantic super-riot.
Rudy's Alpine Inn was 'sup
posed to have been dismantled by
students who decided that since it
wouldn't be open much longer
they might as well tear it down
now.
And they said Cal students
swiped the truck on which Stan
ford yell leaders were perform
ing in San Francisco Friday
night.
Actually, there were some inci
dents between Thursday night
and Saturday afternoon—both on
the Peninsula and in San Fran
risco. But nothing <|uite like the
Paul Bunyan t?)les.
600 Students
When Some 600 students con
verged on the senior "Bear Bust"
at Kossotti's Thursday, the nippy
weather soon forced the whole
bunch to try to crowd into the
relatively small building.
"After being outside," one stu
dent remarked, "it seemed hot
and stuffy. We couldn't get the
windows open, so the only thing
to do was break them." Bottles
were hurled through two of the
glass panes.
The overflow crowd outside
broke quite a few bottles and a
few students reportedly put glass
under sheriff's cars as well as
letting air out through the valves.
Finding the crowd too large,
Kossotti's closed soon after 11
p.m. Those inside were allowed
to remain but new arrivals were
kept out by sheriff's deputies.
Even the ABC men were re

strained until they produced cre
dentials
As the ABC moved in, practi
cally everyone departed — and
went on to Rudy's and other
places. Later the ABC checked
those at Rudy's but reportedly
found no under-age students.
During the entire evening only
one person was arrested at Ros
sotti's. This student had resisted
the officers and was lodged in
jail overnight. He was released

on $10 hail the next morning.
One old Stanford grad was re
ported to have asked an ABC man
who was about to make an ar
rest, "'How do you sleep nights,
arresting college kids over Big
Game weekend?"
'"The whole cause of the mild
rowdyism was too many people
in too small a space." remarked
one member of the senior class.
Both the senior class and Ros
sotti's had hired sheriff's depu
ties to check ID's and to prevent
trouble in general. The Rossotti
management remarked that "We
don't intend to handle such a big
group again — unless the weath
er's nice enough for everyone
outside."
S.F. Rally
The San Francisco rally Friday
night went relatively smoothly,
although director of rallies Tom
Pike had to lock the cab of the
yell leaders' truck and drive it
away before a bunch of Cal men
took it over.
That incident, however, look
place after the yell leaders and
pompon girls had moved on. Cal
men were still on the truck as
Pike began moving it, its tires
slightly flattened after the valves
had been opened.
"In San Francisco it wasn't a
riot—just a fairly unruly crowd,"
reported one eyewitness. Some
2500 had gathered in Union
Square for the event. In one in

stance a juicy grapefruit came
sailing out of an upper-floor win
dow of the St. Francis Hotel.
"I saw the cops pick up one
guy wearing a suit and put him
in the paddy wagon," one student
reported. "But maybe they let
him out after they got him away
from the area."
Head cheerleader Ed Borden
kircher told The Daily he plans
to recommend to Cardinals the
abandonment of the San Fran
cisco rally. He believes that the
big rally should be Thursday
night on the campus and that the
spirit would better hold over un
til Saturday.
"Rallies are really for students,
not the alumni," he noted. "When
the yell leaders performed both
Thursday and Friday, we had
pretty much lost our voices by
Saturday."
< al Hooters Caught
Three Cal students were turned
over to the IJC judicial council
under terms of the SU-UC "non
aggression" pact. They had been
observer! with paint cans Wednes
day night.
Thursday night's bonfire was
not without incident. Witnesses
report several Stanford students
were beaten by high-school-age
hoodlums. A report that one Stan
ford student was blinded by the
hoodlums has not been confirmed,
however.

Thursday and Friday, we had

Saturday."
< al Hooters Caught
Three Cal students were turned
over to the IJC judicial council
under terms of the SU-UC "non
aggression" pact. They had been
observer! with paint cans Wednes
day night.
Thursday night's bonfire was
not without incident. Witnesses
report several Stanford students
were beaten by high-school-age
hoodlums. A report that one Stan
ford student was blinded by the
hoodlums has not been confirmed,
however.
Beginning with the Bonfire
Thursday night, there were a few
drinks, a few drunks, a few wild
stories—and by yesterday there
were sky-high rumors which had
Kossotti's "demolished" in the
wake of a gigantic super-riot.
Rudy's Alpine Inn was 'sup
posed to have been dismantled by
students who decided that since it
wouldn't be open much longer
they might as well tear it down
now.
And they said Cal students
swiped the truck on which Stan
ford yell leaders were perform
ing in San Francisco Friday
night.
Actually, there were some inci
dents between Thursday night
and Saturday afternoon—both on
the Peninsula and in San Fran
risco. But nothing <|uite like the
Paul Bunyan t?)les.
600 Students
When Some 600 students con
verged on the senior "Bear Bust"
at Kossotti's Thursday, the nippy
weather soon forced the whole
bunch to try to crowd into the
relatively small building.
"After being outside," one stu
dent remarked, "it seemed hot
and stuffy. We couldn't get the
windows open, so the only thing
to do was break them." Bottles
were hurled through two of the
glass panes.
The overflow crowd outside
broke quite a few bottles and a
few students reportedly put glass
under sheriff's cars as well as
letting air out through the valves.
Finding the crowd too large,
Kossotti's closed soon after 11
p.m. Those inside were allowed
to remain but new arrivals were
kept out by sheriff's deputies.
Even the ABC men were re

strained until they produced cre
dentials
As the ABC moved in, practi
cally everyone departed — and
went on to Rudy's and other
places. Later the ABC checked
those at Rudy's but reportedly
found no under-age students.
During the entire evening only
one person was arrested at Ros
sotti's. This student had resisted
the officers and was lodged in
jail overnight. He was released

on $10 hail the next morning.
One old Stanford grad was re
ported to have asked an ABC man
who was about to make an ar
rest, "'How do you sleep nights,
arresting college kids over Big
Game weekend?"
'"The whole cause of the mild
rowdyism was too many people
in too small a space." remarked
one member of the senior class.
Both the senior class and Ros
sotti's had hired sheriff's depu
ties to check ID's and to prevent
trouble in general. The Rossotti
management remarked that "We
don't intend to handle such a big
group again — unless the weath
er's nice enough for everyone
outside."
S.F. Rally
The San Francisco rally Friday
night went relatively smoothly,
although director of rallies Tom
Pike had to lock the cab of the
yell leaders' truck and drive it
away before a bunch of Cal men
took it over.
That incident, however, look
place after the yell leaders and
pompon girls had moved on. Cal
men were still on the truck as
Pike began moving it, its tires
slightly flattened after the valves
had been opened.
"In San Francisco it wasn't a
riot—just a fairly unruly crowd,"
reported one eyewitness. Some
2500 had gathered in Union
Square for the event. In one in

stance a juicy grapefruit came
sailing out of an upper-floor win
dow of the St. Francis Hotel.
"I saw the cops pick up one
guy wearing a suit and put him
in the paddy wagon," one student
reported. "But maybe they let
him out after they got him away
from the area."
Head cheerleader Ed Borden
kircher told The Daily he plans
to recommend to Cardinals the
abandonment of the San Fran
cisco rally. He believes that the
big rally should be Thursday
night on the campus and that the
spirit would better hold over un
til Saturday.
"Rallies are really for students,
not the alumni," he noted. "When
the yell leaders performed both
Thursday and Friday, we had
pretty much lost our voices by
Saturday."

guy wearing a suit and put him
in the paddy wagon," one student
reported. "But maybe they let
him out after they got him away
from the area."
Head cheerleader Ed Borden
kircher told The Daily he plans
to recommend to Cardinals the
abandonment of the San Fran
cisco rally. He believes that the
big rally should be Thursday
night on the campus and that the
spirit would better hold over un
til Saturday.
"Rallies are really for students,
not the alumni," he noted. "When
the yell leaders performed both
Thursday and Friday, we had
pretty much lost our voices by
Saturday."
< al Hooters Caught
Three Cal students were turned
over to the IJC judicial council
under terms of the SU-UC "non
aggression" pact. They had been
observer! with paint cans Wednes
day night.
Thursday night's bonfire was
not without incident. Witnesses
report several Stanford students
were beaten by high-school-age
hoodlums. A report that one Stan
ford student was blinded by the
hoodlums has not been confirmed,
however.
Beginning with the Bonfire
Thursday night, there were a few
drinks, a few drunks, a few wild
stories—and by yesterday there
were sky-high rumors which had
Kossotti's "demolished" in the
wake of a gigantic super-riot.
Rudy's Alpine Inn was 'sup
posed to have been dismantled by
students who decided that since it
wouldn't be open much longer
they might as well tear it down
now.
And they said Cal students
swiped the truck on which Stan
ford yell leaders were perform
ing in San Francisco Friday
night.
Actually, there were some inci
dents between Thursday night
and Saturday afternoon—both on
the Peninsula and in San Fran
risco. But nothing <|uite like the
Paul Bunyan t?)les.
600 Students
When Some 600 students con
verged on the senior "Bear Bust"
at Kossotti's Thursday, the nippy
weather soon forced the whole
bunch to try to crowd into the
relatively small building.
"After being outside," one stu
dent remarked, "it seemed hot
and stuffy. We couldn't get the
windows open, so the only thing
to do was break them." Bottles
were hurled through two of the
glass panes.
The overflow crowd outside
broke quite a few bottles and a
few students reportedly put glass
under sheriff's cars as well as
letting air out through the valves.
Finding the crowd too large,
Kossotti's closed soon after 11
p.m. Those inside were allowed
to remain but new arrivals were
kept out by sheriff's deputies.
Even the ABC men were re

strained until they produced cre
dentials
As the ABC moved in, practi
cally everyone departed — and
went on to Rudy's and other
places. Later the ABC checked
those at Rudy's but reportedly
found no under-age students.
During the entire evening only
one person was arrested at Ros
sotti's. This student had resisted
the officers and was lodged in
jail overnight. He was released

on $10 hail the next morning.
One old Stanford grad was re
ported to have asked an ABC man
who was about to make an ar
rest, "'How do you sleep nights,
arresting college kids over Big
Game weekend?"
'"The whole cause of the mild
rowdyism was too many people
in too small a space." remarked
one member of the senior class.
Both the senior class and Ros
sotti's had hired sheriff's depu
ties to check ID's and to prevent
trouble in general. The Rossotti
management remarked that "We
don't intend to handle such a big
group again — unless the weath
er's nice enough for everyone
outside."
S.F. Rally
The San Francisco rally Friday
night went relatively smoothly,
although director of rallies Tom
Pike had to lock the cab of the
yell leaders' truck and drive it
away before a bunch of Cal men
took it over.
That incident, however, look
place after the yell leaders and
pompon girls had moved on. Cal
men were still on the truck as
Pike began moving it, its tires
slightly flattened after the valves
had been opened.
"In San Francisco it wasn't a
riot—just a fairly unruly crowd,"
reported one eyewitness. Some
2500 had gathered in Union
Square for the event. In one in

stance a juicy grapefruit came
sailing out of an upper-floor win
dow of the St. Francis Hotel.
"I saw the cops pick up one
guy wearing a suit and put him
in the paddy wagon," one student
reported. "But maybe they let
him out after they got him away
from the area."
