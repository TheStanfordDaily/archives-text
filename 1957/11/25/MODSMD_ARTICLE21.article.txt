## Sequoia Offers Wide Variety 
### Betty Kantor 
'
Sequoia magazine, whose au
j tumn issue is on sale beginning
today, once again offers a wide
variety of ingredients to readers.
Some exciting new ideas are of
fered in Jack Cornwall's article,
on "Post - Modern Architecture."
Cornwall's theme is that a build
ing's main purpose is to provide
shelter. That purpose can only
be carried out if the building en
closes space in such a way that
men can relate themselves to it.
The ideas are explained bringing
in various periods in architec
ture. especially the modern.
Although Cornwall's prose is
on the academic side, Art Editor
Trudy King's illustrations of the
article add to the reader's under

standing and appreciation of i
Cornwall's point. This is the first I
time that illustrations of an ex- j
planatory nature have been usedj
in Sequoia, and the results are re
warding.
Susan Geary's first published
story delightfully captures the
spirit of childhood. Writing in the
first person, and using skillfully
the technique of dramatic irony,
Miss Geary tells how a brother
and sister avenge themselves on
their mother's suitor, who looked;
"like a hairy grey toad that whis
pered instead of croaked."
In Diane Rudin's poem, '"Still
the Wind." awarded the Irene
Hardy Poetry Prize, imagery is
vivid and diction clear and pre
cise, but the conversation, in at-;
tempting to bo simple, fails to
Jo Do Eds' "'Sure We Knew Cap- '

avoid prosaicness, a pitfall of
poems in a plain style.
For those who are impressed
with names, Marianne Moore's is
included in the issue, along with
a poem written "especially fori
Sequoia." In five lines Miss
Moore wishes she were a dragon. |
Celia Barker's "Sonnet" about
strangers on a train is a marvel
of compactness. The poem, win-!
ner of the Academy of American '
Poets Poetry Prize, is probably
the best Sequoia has printed.
Nicl Klein's analysis of the
stream - of - consciousness tech-j
nique, "Holes in tlve Stream," is i
a difficult subject well handled.;

py" is the type of short story one
expects to find in a college liter
ary magazine, and will cause as
much comment among lYeshman
girls as did last quarter's "Isaac
and Sonia."
Eleanor Ogden's editorial is one
of the high points of the maga
zine and proves that last quar
ter's editorial was not just a
whim. Sequoia editors have stop
ped talking shop and now have
something to say.
Miss Ogden takes up the fa
miliar problems of ihe intellec
tual vacuum and of conformity,
but she handles them in a unique
way.

Some exciting new ideas are of
fered in Jack Cornwall's article,
on "Post - Modern Architecture."
Cornwall's theme is that a build
ing's main purpose is to provide
shelter. That purpose can only
be carried out if the building en
closes space in such a way that
men can relate themselves to it.
The ideas are explained bringing
in various periods in architec
ture. especially the modern.
Although Cornwall's prose is
on the academic side, Art Editor
Trudy King's illustrations of the
article add to the reader's under

standing and appreciation of i
Cornwall's point. This is the first I
time that illustrations of an ex- j
planatory nature have been usedj
in Sequoia, and the results are re
warding.

Miss Geary tells how a brother
and sister avenge themselves on
their mother's suitor, who looked;
"like a hairy grey toad that whis
pered instead of croaked."
