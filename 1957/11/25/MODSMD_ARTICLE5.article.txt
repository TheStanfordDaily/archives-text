# NOT SINCE '40
## Cards Defeat All California PCC Teams 
### Frank Huntress 
For I lie first time in 17 years
Stanford defeated all three of the
other California universities in
the Pacific Coast Conference.
By out-PATing the Bears, 14-12,
the Indians took their third sea
son victory over a California
team. Earlier they defeated UC
LA. 20-6, and USC. 35-7.
The last time this feat was ac
complished, was during the 1040
season by the "Wow Boys," who
defeated Nebraska in the 1941
Rose Bowl.
More than 90,000 persons saw
the Big Red win the Axe back by
kicking all its extra points — a
feat which has cost it five games
in two years and two trips to the
Rose Bowl.
Other Shenanigans
The only other shenanigans
which took place resulted in the
disappearance of both of the uni
versities' banners. A Cal student
was caught by a student police
man after he had cut the Stan
ford banner down.
Ed Bordenkircher, displaying
his best talents as yell king this
year, rode into the game with his
assistants and pompon girls on
an old car. which almost creamed
a group of routy Cal rooters.
Bordenkircher led the section
in a spell honoring the Bears—
"TT - TUR - KK - KEY. TUR-KEY,
California, California."
Cal's mascot. Oskie. was greet
ed by an Indian rooter's banner:
"Oskie has no daddy."
Demonstrating they are the
best on the West Coast, Ihe Stan
ford Rand paid a pre-game trih- J
ute 1o the late Sam MrDonald by
spelling out his first name on the
field and placing a cross through
the center.
Card Half-time
At half-time the Card band, as- :
sisted by the Men's Glee Club. !
presented the "history and heri
tage of the United States." They
played a Thanksgiving hymn,
"Yankee Doodle," "Oh, Susanna,"
"Over There" and"America the
Beautiful."
Stanford's card stunts during 1
the half-time ceremonies also in
cluded a tribute to McDonald and
the winning stunt in this year's
contest. It depicted a golden bear
in a blue field followed by a gold i
Indian head.
All the stunts except the one
which spelled out "STANFORD"
were excellent. The "N" and "F"
in the one stunt were ragged and
indistinguishable. The stunts
closed with the usually well-per
formed, expanding "S."
Highlight of the Cal band's
performance was when members
of the band would release puffs
of smoke. Their most recogniz
able and best card stunt was the
one giving the half-lime score. II
couldn't have been better SI I 7,
Cal 6.
"Baby-Faced Assassin"
At half-time former Stanford
great, Rill Corbus, was admitted ;
officially into the National Foot
ball Hall of Fame. University
President Wallace Sterling made
the presentation to the two-year
All-American guard of 1932-33,
saying that Corbus was known
then as "the baby-faced assas
sin."
During the same ceremonies
Corbus, who had played two sea
sons under the late Pop Warner,
presented the University with a
memorial in the substance of a
drinking fountain outside Gate F
of the Stadium. He made tho
dedication on behalf of the Block
"S" Society.
Needless to say, both goal posts i
were razed to the ground. I
