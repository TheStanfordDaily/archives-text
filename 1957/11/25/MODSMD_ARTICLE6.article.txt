# Win Over Cal a High Spot, But Chuck's Glad It's Over
## Praises Current Club as Best Group Of Athletes in His Seven-Year Reign 
### Steve Baffrey 
II was his last game as head coach of the Indians, and"it. was one
of my most exciting games," Coach Chuck Taylor toid newsmen
after Saturday's 14-12 Big Game win. The usual smile was present
on the 37-year-old coach's face, but tiiis time it seemed to mean more

than it has in the past.
Taylor looked relieved relieved
the Axe had returned to Stan
ford, hnd relieved in Ihe greater
sense that his coaching career
was through. He will fill the post
semiofficially until a new coach i
is appointed.
Before he would consent to dis-!
j cuss his team's gamp, Taylor !
| wanted to go on record with a I
I tribute to Pete Elliott and Cal. "I j
I think a tremendous amount of ;
I credit should be given to Pete
j and his group for keeping up
j their fight and enthusiasm all
I year after losing so many. That's
the toughest thing a coach has to
do, and he did it well."
Best Mentally
But then he gladly turned to ;
discussing S t an 112 or d in these |
terms: "This is an unqualified I
statement. This team is the best !
group of athletes I have had here
in seven years. Not necessarily
in a physical sense, but in a men- !
tal way. We did not have one :
problem on the squad all year."
Somebody was bound to ask the
Stanford coach this one: "'Well,
Chuck, what do you think of |
PAT's now?" And he answered,
"I still think they should bo out-1
I lawed but I will say this -our i
win today was ironical but pleas
ant."
Taylor went on to arid that he
had decided to lei A 1 Harrington
kick the extras just before the
game. "It was one of the most!
melodramatic situations in all
football. Here's a guy who's been
criticized before for not kicking
I them, and he came through in the
I Big One with the only thing he
I could do." ,
Kapp Good
The coach then talked about
j passing, both Stanford's and
! Cal's. "I was worried all the time
| the ball was in the air toward the
' end of the game -in fact I'm wor
! rierl whenever the ball's in the
[ air. ] guess Kapp had a good day
in the air; I'd single him out as
one of their outstanding men."
And he went on to single out

that the game was over and that
guards Boh Peterson and Don
Manoukian as outstanding line
men for the Indians, and Jack
Douglas and Chuck Shea in the
backfield.
"'Douglas made some mistakes
out there," the coach said, "but
he is one of the most intelligent
quarterbacks I've had, consider
ing leadership and the other qual
ities a quarterback must have."
Thanks Staff
"And I want to thank my
coaching staff for what they've
done for me. Harmony on a
coaching staff is a very impor
tant thing, perhaps the most im
portant. My assistants were loyal
all the way; we never had a rift.
They are hard workers, too; in
fact, these guys are great."
There might have been more
questions asked, but by this time
literally swarms of people had
come in to congratulate the coach
on his last great victory, and he
remembered he hadn't congratu
lated his team yet.
