At Shamrock
This year's convention took
place in the Shamrock-llilton Ho
! tel. Houston, Tex. One of the high-
I lights was a speech by.former De
fense Secretary Charles E. Wilson
! in which he stressed the "people
! to-people" aspccts of foreign re
! lations.
Governments, he said, have fail
ed to communicate with each oth
er, and wars have resulted. Peo
ple themselves are not bound by
protocol or other hindrances from
getting together.
Wilson now heads a private
foundation which encourages peo
ple-to-people activities, such as
exchange student programs and
international bird-watching socie
ties.
Texans are still quite national
istic, so far as Texas is concerned.
; About the only place I saw the
Stars and Stripes was on the
Shamrock. Every other place ap
peared to fly only the Lone Star
! flag.
Ship Canal
One of our afternoons was
spent touring the Houston ship
canal. Houston is about 20 miles
inland from the Gulf of Mexico,
i Early in this century a channel
I was dredged which can accommo
date ocean-going vessels.
During the trip we stopped at
the battleship Texas, now a state
historic monument. The 45-year
-1 olrl ship houses, among other
items, a museum with pictures
land relics of the Texas merchant
i marine.
While Texas operated as an in
dependent republic (1836-45) it li
censed quite a few freight and
passenger vessels, both windjam
mer's and paddle-wheelers. These
ships continued to fly the Texas
1 flag for a decade after the state
| joined the Union.
Stanford Traditions
1 talked to a Minnesota man
j who had been at Stanford in the
1920's and had edited The Daily,
lie asked if the upperclassmen
still wore dirty cords and won
dered if certain other customs pcr-
I sisted. One might conclude that
' Farm traditions do change.
The weather was actually hot
and muggy, and it fell good to
alight from the train at the Paly
station and find a nice cool breeze.
The convention was really sober
no sofas got dumped out of the
: 15th floor, etc. I might add that
everyone was very friendly; it was
a real privilege to meet repre
i sentatives of so many large uni
versities.
