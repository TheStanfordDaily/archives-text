In he an increa.-ing problem the high-school
agc hoodlums.
Several Stanford -indents literally "had the
lar whipped out of them ;il Thursday nights
Koulire. One or two '"loughs would seJect a
student, heal him up so his lace was ;ill bloody,
leave him :tll<l find another victim. I liev would
repeat the process until they gol tired and
would then leave.
We must see I hat such occurrences do not
happen next scar. Several things can he done

to improve llic situation next vear: a couple of
surest ions are:
• Have more uniformed student police as
sisting I niversit) oflicers. The mere presence
of uniformed authorities in ;i crowd stops trou
ble before it starts.
• Finplov "collective sell-defense" methods.
All 100 often, other Stanlordiles stand h\ while
one of their members is beaten. If the closest
dozen people moved in at once to subdue the]
hoodlums, the toughies would not dare start I
a fight.
Once controlled hv Stanford students, the
hoodlums could then he marched straight to j
the authorities, w here proper action could
be taken. The same Stanford people should be
willing to testifv, if a court trial resulted.
We fervent K hope that, with a little aware
ness of this problem, Stanford will be able to j
continue its Hig Game functions without hav
ing its members clobbered.
