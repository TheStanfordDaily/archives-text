Vllowed to Drink
Editor, The Daily:
I am rather struck by the change of attitude
on the Stanford campus regarding drinking by
minors. Previously the student body was united
in its fight against the A.8.C.. and before that
1 he 8.0. E. The administration, while not openly
approving, certainly went to no great lengths to
disapprove. Now, however, members of the Stan
lord "family" are urged to report to the parents
of the "family" any violation of the state liquor
laws which they encounter.
But why should we obey such absurd laws?
Theoretically, laws are designed to protect rights
and liberties; but the liquor laws (prohibiting
drinking by minors), rather than protecting
l ights, violate individual freedom.
Throughout history, tyrants have enacted laws
which restrict individual freedom. However,
when these laws have run counter to social cus
i om or deep-seated desires, their chief effect has
boon to increase ihe number of criminals, not to
reduce the incidence of the act decreed illegal.
These laws are never revoked unless the people
affected resist actively. Frankly and openly dis
obeying the law is the only way it will ever be
brought to the attention of the lawmakers that
1 he law as it exists is unworkable.
Yet a university where theoretically the wind
of freedom blows has taken to punishing students
for the "crime" of drinking. The basis for this
punishment is the Fundamental Standard, which
until recently had governed only moral values.
Recently the. Judicial Council decided that, al
though drinking itself was not immoral (a con
descending admission*, breaking the law was. If
this decision is correct, then we do indeed live in
an immoral country one can scarcely draw a
breath without being liable to charges of con
spiring to attempt conspiracy or some other such
nebulous offense.
Perhaps it is lime for another change of policy.
There is no reason why Stanford students should
not be allowed to drink when they please.

Season Ticket benefits?
Editor, The Daily:
(Here's a copy of a letter I recently wrote to
the Athletic Department.)
The wonderful benefits associated with holding
orison tickets came to mo with a resounding thud
today when I received my Big Game ducats.
This year I have not minded being on Ihe 10-
yard line, because my seats were some 40 rows
up; hut these Big Game tickets are in tho deep
i orner ol the end'yone. and only three rows up.
Please understand me I know 1 don't deserve
a ><i\ard line seat on Al Master's [sic] lap, but

all this business of order early et al surely doesn't j
show up in these kinds of seats. For the price |
and early reservation I would rather have had a
room with T.V. in the Hotel President, and a hot i
toddy to ward off the misery (this might be
nearer the field than my present seats).
Once someone told me Big Game tickets were
not mailed until the previous week to prevent j
scalping. Frankly, I believe the reason is to keep
irate alumni from scalping you people, crying j
Foul! and demanding a refund.
The radio stated the Big Game was not a Sell- i
out [sic]. I would rather have a high row in the !
middle of the end zone than this subterranean i
deal in the corner.
Please cut the grass especially low in the vi- |
cinity of row FF so this devoted season licket j
holder will be able to see the Big Red when it gets j
into the extreme northern end of the stadium.

My son sends me The Daily, and I enjoy read
ing it to receive an impression of the University
which it represents.
The purpose of this letter is to comment on
your recent editorial. "Wisdom in Foreknowl- 1
edge." I think this piece is sound in thought and j
very well expressed. As editorials go, it is su- I
perior. Few in such magazines as Saturday Eve- 1
ning Post, Life, or Fortune are better.
Please accept my congratulations for your fine 1
work.

Editor, The Daily:
Your self-styled Brooks Atkinson managed to
show in only a few short paragraphs his com
plete lack of tact and sensitivity. Criticism is a
good thing when used with discrimination, but
Mr. Baffrey has failed to realize that Gaieties is
not a professional show and should not be judged
by professional standards. It is written and pro
duced by Stanford students, not only for the en
joyment of the student body but for the mem
bers of the cast as well.
A professional show has at least eight weeks
of rehearsal, eight hours a day before the show
opens; students obviously cannot afford to give
this much of their time. I feel that the results
they have obtained with the time and material I
available are outstanding.

up; hut these Big Game tickets are in tho deep
i orner ol the end'yone. and only three rows up.
Please understand me I know 1 don't deserve
a ><i\ard line seat on Al Master's [sic] lap, but

all this business of order early et al surely doesn't j
show up in these kinds of seats. For the price |
and early reservation I would rather have had a
room with T.V. in the Hotel President, and a hot i
toddy to ward off the misery (this might be
nearer the field than my present seats).
Once someone told me Big Game tickets were
not mailed until the previous week to prevent j
scalping. Frankly, I believe the reason is to keep
irate alumni from scalping you people, crying j
Foul! and demanding a refund.
The radio stated the Big Game was not a Sell- i
out [sic]. I would rather have a high row in the !
middle of the end zone than this subterranean i
deal in the corner.
Please cut the grass especially low in the vi- |
cinity of row FF so this devoted season licket j
holder will be able to see the Big Red when it gets j
into the extreme northern end of the stadium.

Your self-styled Brooks Atkinson managed to
show in only a few short paragraphs his com
plete lack of tact and sensitivity. Criticism is a
good thing when used with discrimination, but
Mr. Baffrey has failed to realize that Gaieties is
not a professional show and should not be judged
by professional standards. It is written and pro
duced by Stanford students, not only for the en
joyment of the student body but for the mem
bers of the cast as well.
A professional show has at least eight weeks
of rehearsal, eight hours a day before the show
opens; students obviously cannot afford to give
this much of their time. I feel that the results
they have obtained with the time and material I
available are outstanding.

Vllowed to Drink
Editor, The Daily:
I am rather struck by the change of attitude
on the Stanford campus regarding drinking by
minors. Previously the student body was united
in its fight against the A.8.C.. and before that
1 he 8.0. E. The administration, while not openly
approving, certainly went to no great lengths to
disapprove. Now, however, members of the Stan
lord "family" are urged to report to the parents
of the "family" any violation of the state liquor
laws which they encounter.
But why should we obey such absurd laws?
Theoretically, laws are designed to protect rights
and liberties; but the liquor laws (prohibiting
drinking by minors), rather than protecting
l ights, violate individual freedom.
Throughout history, tyrants have enacted laws
which restrict individual freedom. However,
when these laws have run counter to social cus
i om or deep-seated desires, their chief effect has
boon to increase ihe number of criminals, not to
reduce the incidence of the act decreed illegal.
These laws are never revoked unless the people
affected resist actively. Frankly and openly dis
obeying the law is the only way it will ever be
brought to the attention of the lawmakers that
1 he law as it exists is unworkable.
Yet a university where theoretically the wind
of freedom blows has taken to punishing students
for the "crime" of drinking. The basis for this
punishment is the Fundamental Standard, which
until recently had governed only moral values.
Recently the. Judicial Council decided that, al
though drinking itself was not immoral (a con
descending admission*, breaking the law was. If
this decision is correct, then we do indeed live in
an immoral country one can scarcely draw a
breath without being liable to charges of con
spiring to attempt conspiracy or some other such
nebulous offense.
Perhaps it is lime for another change of policy.
There is no reason why Stanford students should
not be allowed to drink when they please.

duced by Stanford students, not only for the en
joyment of the student body but for the mem
bers of the cast as well.
A professional show has at least eight weeks
of rehearsal, eight hours a day before the show
opens; students obviously cannot afford to give
this much of their time. I feel that the results
they have obtained with the time and material I
available are outstanding.

Vllowed to Drink
Editor, The Daily:
I am rather struck by the change of attitude
on the Stanford campus regarding drinking by
minors. Previously the student body was united
in its fight against the A.8.C.. and before that
1 he 8.0. E. The administration, while not openly
approving, certainly went to no great lengths to
disapprove. Now, however, members of the Stan
lord "family" are urged to report to the parents
of the "family" any violation of the state liquor
laws which they encounter.
But why should we obey such absurd laws?
Theoretically, laws are designed to protect rights
and liberties; but the liquor laws (prohibiting
drinking by minors), rather than protecting
l ights, violate individual freedom.
Throughout history, tyrants have enacted laws
which restrict individual freedom. However,
when these laws have run counter to social cus
i om or deep-seated desires, their chief effect has
boon to increase ihe number of criminals, not to
reduce the incidence of the act decreed illegal.
These laws are never revoked unless the people
affected resist actively. Frankly and openly dis
obeying the law is the only way it will ever be
brought to the attention of the lawmakers that
1 he law as it exists is unworkable.
Yet a university where theoretically the wind
of freedom blows has taken to punishing students
for the "crime" of drinking. The basis for this
punishment is the Fundamental Standard, which
until recently had governed only moral values.
Recently the. Judicial Council decided that, al
though drinking itself was not immoral (a con
descending admission*, breaking the law was. If
this decision is correct, then we do indeed live in
an immoral country one can scarcely draw a
breath without being liable to charges of con
spiring to attempt conspiracy or some other such
nebulous offense.
Perhaps it is lime for another change of policy.
There is no reason why Stanford students should
not be allowed to drink when they please.

Season Ticket benefits?
Editor, The Daily:
(Here's a copy of a letter I recently wrote to
the Athletic Department.)
The wonderful benefits associated with holding
orison tickets came to mo with a resounding thud
today when I received my Big Game ducats.
This year I have not minded being on Ihe 10-
yard line, because my seats were some 40 rows
up; hut these Big Game tickets are in tho deep
i orner ol the end'yone. and only three rows up.
Please understand me I know 1 don't deserve
a ><i\ard line seat on Al Master's [sic] lap, but

all this business of order early et al surely doesn't j
show up in these kinds of seats. For the price |
and early reservation I would rather have had a
room with T.V. in the Hotel President, and a hot i
toddy to ward off the misery (this might be
nearer the field than my present seats).
Once someone told me Big Game tickets were
not mailed until the previous week to prevent j
scalping. Frankly, I believe the reason is to keep
irate alumni from scalping you people, crying j
Foul! and demanding a refund.
The radio stated the Big Game was not a Sell- i
out [sic]. I would rather have a high row in the !
middle of the end zone than this subterranean i
deal in the corner.
Please cut the grass especially low in the vi- |
cinity of row FF so this devoted season licket j
holder will be able to see the Big Red when it gets j
into the extreme northern end of the stadium.

The purpose of this letter is to comment on

very well expressed. As editorials go, it is su- I

Please accept my congratulations for your fine 1
