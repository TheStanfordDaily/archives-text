There is an old saying thai "no man is indispensible. Rut the
University is going to have a hard time finding a football coach of
the caliber of Charles A. (Cluick) Taylor.
The 37-year-old gentleman-coach who predicted victory for his
team every weekend will be leaving the coaching profession, but not
Stanford. Beginning in February Coach Chuck will become assistant
to Athletic Director A 1 Masters.
Taylor was a "gentleman's coach" the ideal mentor with the
highest standards for Stanford. As President Wallace Sterling said.
"He combines great technical proficiency with high character and
the qualities of a fine teacher." II is most probable that his greatest
asset was not his technical "know how" but his administrative abil
ity meeting the alumni, public, press and, most important, the
players. And that is just what he'll be doing in his new post.
Taylor, himself, did not wish to continue in the capacity of a grid
coach. He did not like the pressure of the hectic, ulcer-paced life of
the grid coach. But in spite of these pressures, principally from the
PCC mess and the press, Taylor kept his composure. The post-game
press conferences were not fun for Chuck, especially after he had

lost a game. You only have had
to go to one of them and hear
Ihe "pointed and trite" questions
asked him. He hides well his dis
gust.
Probably his greatest reason
for quitting was that he did not
have enough time to spend with
his family. And when the oppor
tunity to become an administra
tor arose, Taylor grabbed it. Ster
ling said, "We eouijt Stanford
fortunate in being able to keep
him at Stanford."
Coach Chuck's seven-year rec
ord on the Farm stands at an im
pressive 40 victories, 29 defeats

and 2 ties. In his very first year as head varsity coach, lie won the
conference crown and the trip to Pasadena. Incidentally his fellow
coaches named him "Coach of the Year" in 1951. Only once in those
years has one of his teams finished worse than the pre season prog
nosticators had predicted. That was last year when he Indians were
favored to win the PCC and go to the Rose Bowl. On three other
occasions his teams fared better than they were supposed to in
1953 when they came within one point of the Rose Bowl, in 1955
when they finished with a C 5-3-1 record and this season when his
leam was supposed to have finished in sixth place.
Ilis coaching has produced colorful football. It is seldom that one
could say that a Taylor-coached Stanford team does not play excit
ing, wide-open football. He was one of the first college coaches to
adopt the "spread-T" or "wing-T" formation, used before almost
exclusively by the pros. Under his tutelage Coach Chuck has de
veloped at least four great T-quarterbacks- Clary Kerkorian, Bobby
Cunvtt, John Broriie and Jack Douglas. He has had a few capable
runners such as Bob IMalhias, lion Cook, Bill Tan*, Eon \alli and
< buck Shea.
It is hoped by the players, students and alumni that Ihe new
coach will continue-the same type of exciting, wide-open football.
And most fortunate is the fact that the "Chucker" is still on the
Farm.
The P.A.T. Summary
i The P.A.T. situation improved during the last three games. In
fact, the record was perfect nine for nine. Here is a breakdown of
the extra-point attempts this season:
San .lose Stale (46-7): Attempted 7. made 4; Harrington 1 for 2
(bad pass from center); Taylor 2 for 2; DeWeeso 1 for 1; and Daw
son 0 for 2 (both were wide).

(wide); DeWeese 1 for 1; Taylor 1 for 1; and Douglas 0 for 1 (wide).
liioe (7-34): Attempted 1, made 1; Bond 1 for 1.
Washington Stale (18-21): Attempted 3, made 0; Taylor 0 for 2
(one bad pass from center and one blocked); and Douglas () for 1
• attempted pass, one-yard gain).
Washington (21-14): Attempted 3, made 3; Harrington 3 for 3.
UCLA (20-6): Attempted 3. made 2; Harrington 2 for 2, Taylor
0 for 1 (wide).

Oregon State (14-24): Attempted 2, made 2; Taylor 2 for 2.
California (14-12): Attempted 2. made 2; Harrington 2 for 2.
This year's team out scored the 1956 team by one touchdown and
three extra points 33 TP's and 23 PAT'S for 227 points to 32 TD'S
and 20 PAT's for 213 points. Big Red's opponents, on the other hand,

"•/
There is an old saying thai "no man is indispensible. Rut the
University is going to have a hard time finding a football coach of
the caliber of Charles A. (Cluick) Taylor.
The 37-year-old gentleman-coach who predicted victory for his
team every weekend will be leaving the coaching profession, but not
Stanford. Beginning in February Coach Chuck will become assistant
to Athletic Director A 1 Masters.
Taylor was a "gentleman's coach" the ideal mentor with the
highest standards for Stanford. As President Wallace Sterling said.
"He combines great technical proficiency with high character and
the qualities of a fine teacher." II is most probable that his greatest
asset was not his technical "know how" but his administrative abil
ity meeting the alumni, public, press and, most important, the
players. And that is just what he'll be doing in his new post.
Taylor, himself, did not wish to continue in the capacity of a grid
coach. He did not like the pressure of the hectic, ulcer-paced life of
the grid coach. But in spite of these pressures, principally from the
PCC mess and the press, Taylor kept his composure. The post-game
press conferences were not fun for Chuck, especially after he had

lost a game. You only have had
to go to one of them and hear
Ihe "pointed and trite" questions
asked him. He hides well his dis
gust.
Probably his greatest reason
for quitting was that he did not
have enough time to spend with
his family. And when the oppor
tunity to become an administra
tor arose, Taylor grabbed it. Ster
ling said, "We eouijt Stanford
fortunate in being able to keep
him at Stanford."
Coach Chuck's seven-year rec
ord on the Farm stands at an im
pressive 40 victories, 29 defeats

and 2 ties. In his very first year as head varsity coach, lie won the
conference crown and the trip to Pasadena. Incidentally his fellow
coaches named him "Coach of the Year" in 1951. Only once in those
years has one of his teams finished worse than the pre season prog
nosticators had predicted. That was last year when he Indians were
favored to win the PCC and go to the Rose Bowl. On three other
occasions his teams fared better than they were supposed to in
1953 when they came within one point of the Rose Bowl, in 1955
when they finished with a C 5-3-1 record and this season when his
leam was supposed to have finished in sixth place.
Ilis coaching has produced colorful football. It is seldom that one
could say that a Taylor-coached Stanford team does not play excit
ing, wide-open football. He was one of the first college coaches to
adopt the "spread-T" or "wing-T" formation, used before almost
exclusively by the pros. Under his tutelage Coach Chuck has de
veloped at least four great T-quarterbacks- Clary Kerkorian, Bobby
Cunvtt, John Broriie and Jack Douglas. He has had a few capable
runners such as Bob IMalhias, lion Cook, Bill Tan*, Eon \alli and
< buck Shea.
It is hoped by the players, students and alumni that Ihe new
coach will continue-the same type of exciting, wide-open football.
And most fortunate is the fact that the "Chucker" is still on the
Farm.

for quitting was that he did not
have enough time to spend with
his family. And when the oppor
tunity to become an administra

ling said, "We eouijt Stanford
fortunate in being able to keep
him at Stanford."
Coach Chuck's seven-year rec
ord on the Farm stands at an im
pressive 40 victories, 29 defeats

and 2 ties. In his very first year as head varsity coach, lie won the
conference crown and the trip to Pasadena. Incidentally his fellow
coaches named him "Coach of the Year" in 1951. Only once in those
years has one of his teams finished worse than the pre season prog
nosticators had predicted. That was last year when he Indians were
favored to win the PCC and go to the Rose Bowl. On three other
occasions his teams fared better than they were supposed to in
1953 when they came within one point of the Rose Bowl, in 1955
when they finished with a C 5-3-1 record and this season when his
leam was supposed to have finished in sixth place.
Ilis coaching has produced colorful football. It is seldom that one
could say that a Taylor-coached Stanford team does not play excit
ing, wide-open football. He was one of the first college coaches to
adopt the "spread-T" or "wing-T" formation, used before almost
exclusively by the pros. Under his tutelage Coach Chuck has de
veloped at least four great T-quarterbacks- Clary Kerkorian, Bobby
Cunvtt, John Broriie and Jack Douglas. He has had a few capable
runners such as Bob IMalhias, lion Cook, Bill Tan*, Eon \alli and
< buck Shea.
It is hoped by the players, students and alumni that Ihe new
coach will continue-the same type of exciting, wide-open football.
And most fortunate is the fact that the "Chucker" is still on the
Farm.
The P.A.T. Summary
i The P.A.T. situation improved during the last three games. In
fact, the record was perfect nine for nine. Here is a breakdown of

There is an old saying thai "no man is indispensible. Rut the
University is going to have a hard time finding a football coach of
the caliber of Charles A. (Cluick) Taylor.
The 37-year-old gentleman-coach who predicted victory for his
team every weekend will be leaving the coaching profession, but not
Stanford. Beginning in February Coach Chuck will become assistant
to Athletic Director A 1 Masters.
Taylor was a "gentleman's coach" the ideal mentor with the
highest standards for Stanford. As President Wallace Sterling said.
"He combines great technical proficiency with high character and
the qualities of a fine teacher." II is most probable that his greatest
asset was not his technical "know how" but his administrative abil
ity meeting the alumni, public, press and, most important, the
players. And that is just what he'll be doing in his new post.
Taylor, himself, did not wish to continue in the capacity of a grid
coach. He did not like the pressure of the hectic, ulcer-paced life of
the grid coach. But in spite of these pressures, principally from the
PCC mess and the press, Taylor kept his composure. The post-game
press conferences were not fun for Chuck, especially after he had

lost a game. You only have had
to go to one of them and hear
Ihe "pointed and trite" questions
asked him. He hides well his dis
gust.
