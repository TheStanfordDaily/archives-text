# Basketball Hits Spotlight With Cards' Tallest Team
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford's tallest-ever basketball team moves into the Indian sports spotlight this week. With five
weeks of intensive indoor work under their belts. Coach Howie Dallmar's Cards find themselves now
only six days away from the season opener against College of Pacific, here Monday at 8 p.m. Although
his team has been picked to finish somewhere between sixth and eighth in next winter's Pacific Coast
Conference cage race, Dallmar predicts, "This team's going to win a lot of games."

Stanford enters the '57-58 sea
son in a paradoxical situation: al
though the team is the tallest
Dallmar has ever had. it also has
just one senior and he hasn't
begun full-fledged workouts yet.
Gary Van Galder is the one
fourth-year man who will he on
the squad, but he's late in report
ing because of football.
No Starting Seniors
Dallmar has named a three
junior, two - sophomore starting
lineup, but stressed that the five
"would have to be on the ball or
they'll get pushed out."
Two returning lettermen, Dick
Haga and John Pflueger, will
open at forwards for 1 the Tribe.
As sophomores last year, this
pair saw a great deal of action.
Each worked at forward part of
the time, but Haga, now 6-5, also
played some center and Pflueger
saw duty at guard.
Good Improvement
Neil Broekmeyer, 6-8 1 i center
up from the '56-'57 frosh team,
has been given ihe first • string
pivot spot. Dallmar cited Broek
meyer as the frosh showing the
greatest improvement from last
year.
In fall workouts, Broekmeyer
has begun to show the aggres
siveness which he lacked last
year. His jump shot, best of his
repertoire, has also gotten better
and better.
Paul Neumann returns to his
old starting post at guard for the
Indians. He is undoubtedly one
of the coolest and calmest play
ers ever to perform on the court,
and will probably be the floor
general for the Tribe.
Arrillaga at Guard
John Arrillaga will be Stan
ford's other starting guard. Ar
rillaga played a couple of fhosh
games here two years ago, and
then got very sick. He had to lay
out of school for two quarters.
As a result, he was ineligible to
play frosh ball last year, but
couldn't play varsity since he
wasn't a sophomore.
Arrillaga, at 6-3Va, and Neu
mann, 6-1 1 -, will give the Cards
plenty of height at the guard
spots —an item which Stanford
hasn't had too much of recently.
This starting five will average
G-414. Dallmar said even if a six
footer replaced Broekmeyer, it
would still be his tallest team.
