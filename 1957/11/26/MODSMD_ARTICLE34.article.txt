### Lyle Sachs 
Only eight teams remain in the
single elimination playoff for the j
intramural football champion
ship. Shysters is scheduled to j
meet Kappa Sig, DU will play
Deke, Stern 111 is matched with
Fiji, and Theta Xi will oppose Chi
Psi in quarter-final action.
One of the top games so far in
the playoff was Kappa Sig versus
Beta. Kappa Sig scored first with
a 25 â€¢ yard pass play from Bill
Hinchy to Lowell Carruth.
Immediately following the TD.
Beta took the ball on their 20-
yard line and with methodical
advancing .scored on a pass from
Tom Brown to Kurt Houser. A
successful after-point iry gave
Beta a 7-(5 half-time lead.
Kappa Sig regained the lead in
the closing minutes of the game
when Carruth intercepted a Beta
pass which set up a TD aerial
from Hinchy to Harding Roe on
the next play. An "alley oop"
pass to Tom Early gave Kappa
Sig their final point and the vic
tory, 13-7.
Stern 111, one of the strongest
running teams in the finals,
edged out ATO 6-0. ATO had pos
session of the ball throughout
most of the first half but strong
defensive play by Mike Thometz
and Jim Kisses enabled Stern to
stifle the ATO scoring attempts.
