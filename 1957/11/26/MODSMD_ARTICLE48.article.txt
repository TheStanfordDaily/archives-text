# A 						QUESTION OF MORALS
## Council Changes Stand on Law 
### Roger Folsom 
The Judicial Council has de
cided that a violation of law is not
necessarily a violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
Previously the Council had held
in several cases that if a student
broke liquor laws he automatical-
Ily violated the Standard, which
j states that "students are expected
to show both within and without
the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor
land the rights of others as is de*
I manded of good citizens."
These decisions were based on
the arguments that (1) laws are
to establish order, therefore if a
student breaks the law he violates
order and the Standard, and that
<2> the Standard refers to stu
dents as "good citizens," and good
I citizens may not break the law.
Moral Code
In reversing its decision, and
deciding that to break the law is
: not necessarily to violate the Fun
j damental Standard, Council mem
: hers argued that the Standard is
subjective — a personal moral
I code. Laws are not necessarily
I moral. California liquor laws es
j tablish 21 as the legal drinking
; age, yet this number is not more
i moral than any other.
I Also, some Council members be
| lieve that if a law is definitely
; immoral, good citizens may break
j that law.
The Council is primarily estab
lished to investigate violations of

the Fundamental Standard, but
this decision reducing the number
of Standard violations will not de
crease the Council's jurisdiction.
Breaking the Law
Minor students guilty of drink
ing, though they may not be
charged with a violation of the
Standard, are guilty of breaking
the law. The arresting agency
turns over such cases to the Uni
versity, which grants jurisdiction
to the Judicial Council.
Formerly the Council charged
such students with a violation of
the Standard. Under the new pol
icy it will charge such students
with breaking the law. Council
members expect that the severity
of penalties for similar offenses
will not change appreciably under
the new policy.
The Council agreed that, al
though whether a minor student
drinks may not be a moral ques
tion, whether he drinks excessive
ly or objectionably is.
All students judged guilty of

i excessive drinking will, as in the
past, be charged with a Funda
| mental Standard violation, in ad
' dition to a violation of state liquor
, laws. The Council itself decides
w h a t charges shall be pressed
: against each defendant.
In the past, some Council mem
bers (holding that ihe Standard is
I a moral code) had objected to
J finding students guilty on moral
grounds of actions which the
Council members ciid not person
ally consider immoral, though il
legal. With a new policy whereby
violations of the law need not al
ways be considered violations of
the Standard, the necessity of
convicting on moral grounds is
eliminated.
Some other Council members
feel that the Fundamental Stand
ard requires that when one stu
dent knows of a violation it is his
duty to corrcct the offender, and,
if the infraction is repeated, to
I report the matter to the Council.
! (Such third-person responsibility

is mentioned specifically in Fun
damental Standard and Honor j
booklets for the Honor Code but
not for the Standard.)
The Judicial Council is empow-1
ered by its constitution to hear all
cases involving violations of Uni-|
versity and ASSU regulations. It
makes its own rules of procedure,!
subject to approval by Legisla- j
ture. Its judicial decisions, made
by majority vote, are subject to j
review by the Dean of Students.

cially important cases. It sits sep

Judicial Council
The Judicial Council consists of j
the Men's and Women's Councils, ■
selected respectively by Stanford I
men and women. It sits as one j
body to hear Honor Code viola-1
tions, all violations involving both j
men and women, and other espe- ]
cially important cases. It sits sep
arately (as Men's or Women's |
Council) to hear other cases.
The Fundamental Standard and '
Honor Code Commission is not a !
judicial group. It does not try or j
investigate any violations.
The Judicial Council has de
cided that a violation of law is not
necessarily a violation of the Fun
damental Standard.
Previously the Council had held
in several cases that if a student
broke liquor laws he automatical-
Ily violated the Standard, which
j states that "students are expected
to show both within and without
the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor
land the rights of others as is de*
I manded of good citizens."
These decisions were based on
the arguments that (1) laws are
to establish order, therefore if a
student breaks the law he violates
order and the Standard, and that
<2> the Standard refers to stu
dents as "good citizens," and good
I citizens may not break the law.
Moral Code
In reversing its decision, and
deciding that to break the law is
: not necessarily to violate the Fun
j damental Standard, Council mem
: hers argued that the Standard is
subjective — a personal moral
I code. Laws are not necessarily
I moral. California liquor laws es
j tablish 21 as the legal drinking
; age, yet this number is not more
i moral than any other.
I Also, some Council members be
| lieve that if a law is definitely
; immoral, good citizens may break
j that law.
The Council is primarily estab
lished to investigate violations of

the Fundamental Standard, but

of Standard violations will not de

The Council agreed that, al
though whether a minor student
drinks may not be a moral ques

ly or objectionably is.
All students judged guilty of

i excessive drinking will, as in the
past, be charged with a Funda
| mental Standard violation, in ad
' dition to a violation of state liquor
, laws. The Council itself decides
w h a t charges shall be pressed

In the past, some Council mem
bers (holding that ihe Standard is

J finding students guilty on moral
grounds of actions which the
Council members ciid not person

violations of the law need not al

the Standard, the necessity of

| mental Standard violation, in ad
' dition to a violation of state liquor
, laws. The Council itself decides
w h a t charges shall be pressed
: against each defendant.
In the past, some Council mem
bers (holding that ihe Standard is
I a moral code) had objected to
J finding students guilty on moral
grounds of actions which the
Council members ciid not person
ally consider immoral, though il
legal. With a new policy whereby
violations of the law need not al
ways be considered violations of
the Standard, the necessity of
convicting on moral grounds is
eliminated.
Some other Council members
feel that the Fundamental Stand
ard requires that when one stu
dent knows of a violation it is his
duty to corrcct the offender, and,
if the infraction is repeated, to
I report the matter to the Council.
! (Such third-person responsibility

is mentioned specifically in Fun
damental Standard and Honor j
booklets for the Honor Code but
not for the Standard.)
The Judicial Council is empow-1
ered by its constitution to hear all
cases involving violations of Uni-|
versity and ASSU regulations. It
makes its own rules of procedure,!
subject to approval by Legisla- j
ture. Its judicial decisions, made
by majority vote, are subject to j
review by the Dean of Students.
Judicial Council
The Judicial Council consists of j
the Men's and Women's Councils, ■
selected respectively by Stanford I
men and women. It sits as one j
body to hear Honor Code viola-1
tions, all violations involving both j
men and women, and other espe- ]
cially important cases. It sits sep
arately (as Men's or Women's |
Council) to hear other cases.
The Fundamental Standard and '
Honor Code Commission is not a !
judicial group. It does not try or j
investigate any violations.
