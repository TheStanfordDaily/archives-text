# 1 Convicted, 2 Acquitted In Code Cases
## 
### 
One student was convicted of
violating the Honor Code and two
others were acquitted in recent
decisions by the Judicial Council.
The convicted s t u den t was
found guilty of copying an engi
neering exercise from another
student's notes. The defendant,
who was excused from attending
the class because of a conflict,
was allowed to turn in the exer
cise during the afternoon after
the class had already met that
morning.
Problem Solved
During ihe class hour the pro
fessor of Ihe course explainefl the
problem. The defendant borrowed
the notes of another class mem
ber. which contained the solution
to the exercise. The only paper
which had the correct solution
was the one turned in by the de
fendant.
However, the slurlent who had
t;iken down the notes had made a
few errors in copying the solu
tion to the exercise. These errors
were duplicated in the defend
ant's paper, although the paper
was not exactly the same as the
notes as a few extra explanatory
steps had been inserted between
several lines. The problem was
in three parts and the defendant
completed only the first part,
which was the only part in the
other student's notes.
Application Explained
The professor had handed out
a sheet at the beginning of the
quarter, explaining the applica
tion of the Honor Code to his class
assignments. The defendant tes
tified that he had copied the class
notes before he turned in the
problem, but that he had not used
them in working the exercise.
The Judicial Council set a pen
alty of two quarters' suspension,
effective immediately. This was
the defendant's second Honor
Code conviction.
The two other cases involved
alleged cheating during mathe
matics examinations. The stu
dents were acquitted of respec
tive charges of copying from a
textbook and obtaining informa
tion from another student's paper
during exams.
