# Biophysics Lab To Be Built on Science Quad
## $124,000 Building to House Research In One of Science's Newest Fields 
### 
Stanford's Science Quad soon will get a new $124,000 Biophysics
Laboratory for carrying on research in one of I lie newest fields of
science.
Building plans will be released for bidding today, it was announced
by Provost Frederick E. Terman. Construction should be underway

by the end of December and fin-1
ished by early summer, he esti
mated.
Administration <>112 the labora-j
tory will be multilateral, as is l
typical of this new field of study, j
Biophysics incorporates biology,
physics, medicine and electronics.
A national organization, the Bio
physical Society, was founded:
only this year.
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, head of
Stanford Medical School's Radiol
ogy Department, will direct the
new laboratory. It will be at-1
tachod administratively to the
W. W. Hansen Laboratories of
Physics, joining with the High
Energy Physics Laboratory and
the Microwave Laboratory.
A committee representing the
various University departments
with a stake in biophysical re
search (initially the School of
Medicine and the Physics Depart
ment) will govern the new facil
ity. The committee, in turn, will
be responsible to the University
Provost and the Dean of Stan-1
lord's Graduate Division.
Biophysical research projects j
at the outset will include X-ray
microscopy, radiation physics, ex
perimental high-energy electron
therapy of cancer, paramagnetic
resonance studies of free radicals,
cellular radiobiology and radia
tion chemistry.
Approximately 15 scientists,
some holding regular appoint
ments in other faculty depart
ments, will staff the facility in
the beginning. Once established,
the laboratory's activities and
staff will expand as rapidly as
funds permit in new collabora
tion with still other University
departments.
The laboratory, a two - story,
rectangular structure of concrete
block and wood frame construe-:
tion, will be connected to the Mi- i
erowave Laboratory by a covered
walkway. Provision for future
expansion is covered in the
plans.
Total floor area will be 6200
square feet. Three administra
tive offices and a conference
room will occupy part of the
ground floor. The remainder of
the building will contain labora
tories. laboratory offices and
rooms for cold storage, steriliza-j
tion, animals, instruments and X-;
ray equipment. Air conditioning. I
for close control of air content i
and temperature, is also planned.'

and temperature, is also planned.'
Stanford's Science Quad soon will get a new $124,000 Biophysics
Laboratory for carrying on research in one of I lie newest fields of
science.
Building plans will be released for bidding today, it was announced
by Provost Frederick E. Terman. Construction should be underway

by the end of December and fin-1
ished by early summer, he esti
mated.
Administration <>112 the labora-j
tory will be multilateral, as is l
typical of this new field of study, j
Biophysics incorporates biology,
physics, medicine and electronics.
A national organization, the Bio
physical Society, was founded:
only this year.
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, head of
Stanford Medical School's Radiol
ogy Department, will direct the
new laboratory. It will be at-1
tachod administratively to the
W. W. Hansen Laboratories of
Physics, joining with the High
Energy Physics Laboratory and
the Microwave Laboratory.
A committee representing the
various University departments
with a stake in biophysical re
search (initially the School of
Medicine and the Physics Depart
ment) will govern the new facil
ity. The committee, in turn, will
be responsible to the University
Provost and the Dean of Stan-1
lord's Graduate Division.
Biophysical research projects j
at the outset will include X-ray
microscopy, radiation physics, ex
perimental high-energy electron
therapy of cancer, paramagnetic
resonance studies of free radicals,
cellular radiobiology and radia
tion chemistry.
Approximately 15 scientists,
some holding regular appoint
ments in other faculty depart
ments, will staff the facility in
the beginning. Once established,
the laboratory's activities and
staff will expand as rapidly as
funds permit in new collabora
tion with still other University
departments.
The laboratory, a two - story,
rectangular structure of concrete
block and wood frame construe-:
tion, will be connected to the Mi- i
erowave Laboratory by a covered
walkway. Provision for future
expansion is covered in the
plans.
Total floor area will be 6200
square feet. Three administra
tive offices and a conference
room will occupy part of the
ground floor. The remainder of
the building will contain labora
tories. laboratory offices and
rooms for cold storage, steriliza-j
tion, animals, instruments and X-;
ray equipment. Air conditioning. I
for close control of air content i
and temperature, is also planned.'
