# Doctors Say President's ‘Stroke’ Is Not Serious
## Ike's Speaking Slightly Impeded 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — A team of
specialists confirmed last night
that President Eisenhower has
■suffered a blockage, or occlusion,
of a blood vessel leading to the
brain a condition generally de
scribed as a mild stroke.
But the specialists said, "He is
alert; his spirits are good."
The blockage "has produced a
slight difficulty in speaking," the
medical men said, adding:
"The difficulty in speaking has
improved over the period of Hie
last 24 hours and is now mani
fested only by a hesitancy in spy
ing certain difficult words.
Reasoning Unaffected
"Reading, writing and reason
ing are not affected.
"The Pres i d en t's physical
strength is normal.
"All attending physicians and
consultants arc agreed that the
President has not had another
heart attack and that the present
symptoms have no relation to his
previous heart attack of Sept. ?A,
1955."
Vice President Nixon, who spent
nearly nine hours at the White
House yesterday, said Eisenhower
is "fully capable" of making any
major decisions that come up.
And he expressed himself "com
pletely confident tho President
will return to his desk and resume
his responsibilities."
Nixon said yesterday there is no
thought of delegating presidential
powers to him or to anyone in the
Cabinet.
NATO Meeting
Repercussions from the Presi
dent's illness were swift:
1. The State Department an
nounced "it is to be assumed"
that Eisenhower will not be able
to attend the December meeting
of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization in Paris. There is a
possibility the conference may be
postponed.
If the decision is to hold a sum
mit session on schedule, officials
predicted last night that Vice
President Nixon will be designat
ed by Eisenhower to attend.
Market Breaks
2. A heavy selling wave hit the
stock market in New York, send
ing prices down as much as $6 a
share. All sorts of stocks were
hit.
3. Unofficial speculation arose
as to how the government's af
fairs—that is, those which are es
pecially in the President's prov
ince will be handled. In this con
nection. the doctors said:
"Although the present condition
is mild and is expected to be tran
sitory in nature, it will require a
period of rest and substantially
decreased activity estimated at
several weeks. . . .
"The outlook for complete re
covery within a reasonable period
of time is excellent."

President has not had another
heart attack and that the present
symptoms have no relation to his
previous heart attack of Sept. ?A,

And he expressed himself "com
pletely confident tho President

NATO Meeting
Repercussions from the Presi
dent's illness were swift:
1. The State Department an
nounced "it is to be assumed"
that Eisenhower will not be able
to attend the December meeting
of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization in Paris. There is a
possibility the conference may be
postponed.
If the decision is to hold a sum
mit session on schedule, officials
predicted last night that Vice
President Nixon will be designat
ed by Eisenhower to attend.

2. A heavy selling wave hit the
stock market in New York, send
ing prices down as much as $6 a
share. All sorts of stocks were
hit.
3. Unofficial speculation arose
as to how the government's af
fairs—that is, those which are es
pecially in the President's prov
ince will be handled. In this con
nection. the doctors said:
"Although the present condition
is mild and is expected to be tran
sitory in nature, it will require a
period of rest and substantially
decreased activity estimated at
several weeks. . . .
"The outlook for complete re
covery within a reasonable period
of time is excellent."
