WASHINGTON (A 3 )- The director of the American satellite pro
gram told Congress yesterday that unquestionably the United States
could have launched a satellite ahead of Russia. But he said he was
denied the top priority he asked for the project.
Dr. John P. Hagen testified he sought top priority in 1955. He also

said 1 his country suffered psycho-1
logical and political damage from j
failing to be first into space with 1
a man-made moon.
Senators investigating the satel
lite - missiles lag also heard Li. i
Gen. James Doolittle testify he
thinks the United States leads
Russia' in military strength at t he
moment, but that there is a real |
threat that the Soviets "will over
take us."
Already, said the retired gen-1
eral, Russia is out in front in bal-1
listic missiles, both intercontinen
tal and intermediate. And, he said, |
this nation is in "a time of crisis." i
While Ilagcn had indicated ear
lier that there has been no speed
up in plans to send up an Amcri- 1
can satellite, he said later that the 112
Pentagon missiles chief, William
M. Iloladay, approved a proce
dures short cut on July 15 which
should result in getting a satellite
into the air earlier.
Doolittle said under question
ing lie didn't think American in
telligence consistently had under* j
estimated Russian strength.
