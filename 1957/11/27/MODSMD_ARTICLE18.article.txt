# Tunisian Talks End In Ambiguity
## Cessation of British Arms Shipments Implied, Sources Say 
### 
PARIS C/P) Two solemn-raced
premiers yesterday wound up 13
hours of ponderous talks aimed
al ironing out British-French dif
ficulties over arms shipments to
Tunisia. While some wrinkles re
mained, a high French source sug
gested that France had scored al
least a partial victory.
The conference between young
Premier Felix Gaillard and Brit
Hin's Prime Minister Harold Mac
millan produced a vaguely-worded
communique that did not give a
black-and-white British promise
to halt arms shipments to the
neighbor of rebellious Algeria.
Far Beyond
But the French informant said
the talks went far beyond the
wording in the communique. lie
said the French do not expect the
British to ship any more arms t<)
Tunisia in the near future if al all.
"There is a difference between
what the British can do and what
they will do," he said.
Macmillan and Gaillard stood
almost stony-faced as the British
leader read ihe communique after
their talks. He had come to Paris
Monday in the hope of patching
up a troubled friendship.
The talks revolved around the
shipment on Nov. 14 and 15 of
arms to Tunisia by the United
States and Britain. Also discussed
was the effect a split in the thre"
allies would have on the solidarity
of NATO.
Frank Discussion
The communique noted that the
i two chiefs of government had a
"frank discussion" on the arms
deliveries and decided to "make
i arrangements designed to avoid
the recurrence of difficulties" sim
ilar to the violent outburst of
J French feelings.
Consultations, the communique
j said, are continuing on this sub
ject.
