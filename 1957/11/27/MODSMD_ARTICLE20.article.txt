### 
Oi vi.l. Mil h:\ikiions observed ill America,
the one which is projnddv the most American
i I lliinks<xi\ ill<£. Hallowed In a humbleness
ami a genuine gratitude, Thanksgiving em
bodies much that is {food in the American way
of lile.
ei the Thanksgiving-of today seems some
how not to com ev the same ideas as the
I hauks{fi\ iug <>l our forefathers. Perhaps this*
i- because the importance has been attached to
the turkev rather than to an expression of
■ latitude to the heavenlv Power who has en
riched our harvests.
i omorrow inanv of us will he home with our
families, gathered around a table covered with
tli ml- of deliciou- foods. Our mouths will
liter.ills water at the .-illl of such feasts, and
the en j>>'. men!,of the repasts w ill be high. Vet
we wonder just how many of us will offer a
prayer before partaking. Ami of those who

will offer that prayer, how many will be jusl
reciting a ritual rather than trills jli\ i 11ji thanks
to Heaven for their blessings?
l or we all have inneh to he thankful for. \\ e
should he thankful we live in a land of plenty;
that we have the opportunit\ to better our
selves through edueation. We should he thank
ful lliat we are at peace; that we exist under a
«lemocraev. And we should he thankful there
is a (jod in heaven to \\ hoin we ean <iive thanks.
Ihere are main families in America who
will not he turkev dinners tomorrow
because thev cannot afford them. Vet. |o the
shame of those of us who can afford them, it is
usuallv the poorer ones who are most genuine
iu their thanksgivin};.
Let us all celebrate Thanksgiving for what it
should he tomorrow. Let us enter that day
with .1 true humility and a sincere gratitude.
Some das it ma\ be 100 late to {rive thanks.
