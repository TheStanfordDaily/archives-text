Sffjuoia luli'or s Irresponsibility

Editor, Tho Daily:
The current issue of the Sequoia (Stanford's
Literary Magazine) features an editorial calcu
lated to sell magazines and promote controversy.
These are both laudable motives, but T would
like to discuss in some detail ihe irresponsibility
(if iho editor's comments. First, the subject of
Hie editorial, a suppressed graduate student, will
he recognized by many old Daily readers as the
incoherent Cato. a frequent contributor of letters
on surprisingly few subjects, mostly dealing with
inherent fascism and complacency in Stanford
iludents. This Cato's literary efforts were re
jected regularly by Sequoia while 1 was a staff
member-, because they were little more than ex
tended and confused magnifications of his Daily
letters, ditto his "suppressed leaflets." While the
Sequoia editor leads her readers to believe that
Cato-Bosmajian's leaflets were suppressed by the
"administration" for their leftist tendencies, the
simple fact is printed in the editorial, namely
1!:al Cato's advisey found these poorly thought
out. politically and socially inane leaflets incom
patible with study for a Ph.D. Certainly, they
were poor efforts.
At the time they ceased to appear, some stu
dents were talking with a professor, and one of
them suggested that it had been suppressed. He
snorted, and replied that no department would
object to any qualified or intellectually respec
table effort, and that if they had suggested that
he stop, Cato could have forced the issue, if he
had any intellectual ground to stand on. He was,
however, easily intimidated, and Non Grata dis
appeared. I offer, then, that Miss Ogden's analy
sis is misleading. It is especially misleading
because she apparently deliberately confuses the
circumstances of Cato's adviser's remark with
1 lie quoted "University policy." That this "Uni
versity policy" has little direct connection with
Cato-Bosmajian and Non Grata can be easily
shown.
First, the interview in which these quotes were
taken occurred this quarter, long after Non Gra
ta's demise. The spokesman, Dr. Glover, was
confronted with the facts in an interview, and
asked for his justification of the adviser's policy.
His remarks are so arranged by Miss Ogden as
to infer that he supported a summary silencing
of all such propaganda as Non Grata. I suggest
rather, that Dr. Glover was only supporting the
adviser's contention (which was only a sugges
tion) that 'such efforts were "irresponsible."
Perhaps Dr. Glover overstated the case; it was
after all nn.interview, not a press release, and his
function in the University is to support the fac
ulty. '
Miss Ogden infers a good deal from this small
event. First, she concludes that the University
(whoever they or that may be) is rigidly con
trolling ihe spontaneous expression of student
opinion. Second, she concludes that this particu
lar effort was summarily squelched. Mr. Bosma
jian seems easily squelched; he apparently was
unwilling to force the issue, if, indeed, disregard
ing a suggestion would have been forceful.
The editorial, then, seems irresponsible on
two counts: that it marries two time-separated
events, the interview and the demise of the un
lamented Non Grata, and then infers for the
reader that the University is rigidly controlling
opinion. Miss Ogden's opinion is too hasty, and
it will not be supported until a leaflet writer
appears who is on better intellectual ground than
Mr. Bosmajian, and who has the courage of his
convictions.
Sequoia editors have recently departed from
purely literary editorials on the subject of fic
tion ; Miss Ogden, however, is the first to flavor
an editorial with the devices of fiction itself.

ihe United States is within 50 years of being a

The United States does not need a new "gel

icy. Russia and the world respect our unflinch
ing' and unselfish devotion to the ideals of justice
and universal freedom which we preach to our
children. The U.S. does not need to make a real
effort, no matter what the cost in taxes, to pro
tect the future. Russia is simply not capable of
putting anything but a dog in a satellite. Good
Old American Ingenuity, competitive industry
and enlightened science will win out. ICBM and
satellites are not really vital to the future of
this country. What happened when a few Hun
garians called to us for six days in vain is really
not important to the future. Let us forget these
'trifles and be extremely'optimistic. Let us con
tinue to devote our finest minds and best efforts
to the really important problems, the problems
we know in our hearts are the vital ones. Now
and in years to come Stanford students should
concentrate on how to add more chrome to the
forward look, how to improve the nation's bridge
game and how to perfect color television. As
long as we students do nothing constructive
about Muttnik and Budapest, our children will
be able to watch the World Series on color tele
vision. Think of what that will mean to the
world.

Editor, The Daily;
The football season is over, and 1957's card
stunts are history. In general, I think this year's
stunts were something of which Stanford can be
proud. The stunts themselves were new and
novel, but it was student co-operation which
made those stunts go off well. For the most
part, the co-operation was excellent. Therefore,
on behalf of myself and Rally Commission I
would like to thank the rootirig section for their
part in making the stunts a success. Congratu
lations for a good job.

Editor, The Daily:
The statement by Michel Barret (The Daily,
Nov. 19) regarding the Anglo-American arms
shipment to Tunisia calls /or some comment.
Mr. Barret stales I hat France was not consulted
and ''did not know about" the shipment. How
ever, according to responsible American news
sources 'e.g.. Edward R. Murrow and Howard K.
Smith of CBS, and the New York Times of Sun
day, Nov. 17), this was not the case. On the
contrary, France was fully aware of the inten
tion of America and Britain to support Western
arms shipments to Tunisia, and moreover was
urged by tho two countries to supply the arms
herself. France was indeed willing to send arms,
but only on conditions unacceptable to the Bour
guiba government as infringing on Tunisian sov
ereignty. The Anglo-American decision was crys
tallized in the face of an offer by Egypt to sup
ply the arms. Of this final decision France was
informed also, although admittedly her reaction
was one of strong protest.
Mr. Barret raises a second point which is de
batable. This is his conviction that the arms sent
to Tunisia will be promptly relayed to the Al
gerian rebels to be used against French troops.
While this is admittedly out of the question, nev
ertheless there are reasons for believing that it
is not highly probable. For one thing, Washing
ton receiver! "the most explicit assurances" (The
New York Times, Nov. 17) that the arms were
considered nontransferable, to be used for defen
sive purposes only. It is of course hard to eval
uate such an agreement, but at least it is a mat
ler of record that this condition was made. Fur
thermore, Premier Bourguiba is generally re
garded as a responsible statesman who has
shown considerable concern in the. peaceful set
tlement of the Algerian war, and would there
fore seem unlikely to take an action calculated
to intensify and prolong the conflict.
The entire affair has been unfortunate, and
was inevitably bound to create French indigna
tion and understanding, at a Hfne when we can
ili afford further estrangement with our allies.
Nevertheless, it does not seem fair to suggest, as
Mr. Barret does, that Washington and London
acted with complete lack o'f sensitivity and fail
ure to foresee unpleasant consequences. This is
a complex and emotionally charged situation, in
which we almost certainly not without some re
luctance and regret took a course that seemed
to us to represent the lesser of two evils; and in
which France for her part surely cannot be held
wholly blameless.

The football season is over, and 1957's card
stunts are history. In general, I think this year's
stunts were something of which Stanford can be
proud. The stunts themselves were new and
novel, but it was student co-operation which
made those stunts go off well. For the most
part, the co-operation was excellent. Therefore,
on behalf of myself and Rally Commission I

The statement by Michel Barret (The Daily,
Nov. 19) regarding the Anglo-American arms
shipment to Tunisia calls /or some comment.
Mr. Barret stales I hat France was not consulted
and ''did not know about" the shipment. How
ever, according to responsible American news
sources 'e.g.. Edward R. Murrow and Howard K.
Smith of CBS, and the New York Times of Sun
day, Nov. 17), this was not the case. On the
contrary, France was fully aware of the inten
tion of America and Britain to support Western
arms shipments to Tunisia, and moreover was
urged by tho two countries to supply the arms
herself. France was indeed willing to send arms,
but only on conditions unacceptable to the Bour
guiba government as infringing on Tunisian sov
ereignty. The Anglo-American decision was crys
tallized in the face of an offer by Egypt to sup
ply the arms. Of this final decision France was
informed also, although admittedly her reaction
was one of strong protest.
Mr. Barret raises a second point which is de
batable. This is his conviction that the arms sent
to Tunisia will be promptly relayed to the Al
gerian rebels to be used against French troops.
While this is admittedly out of the question, nev
ertheless there are reasons for believing that it
is not highly probable. For one thing, Washing
ton receiver! "the most explicit assurances" (The
New York Times, Nov. 17) that the arms were
considered nontransferable, to be used for defen
sive purposes only. It is of course hard to eval
uate such an agreement, but at least it is a mat
ler of record that this condition was made. Fur
thermore, Premier Bourguiba is generally re
garded as a responsible statesman who has
shown considerable concern in the. peaceful set
tlement of the Algerian war, and would there
fore seem unlikely to take an action calculated
to intensify and prolong the conflict.
The entire affair has been unfortunate, and
was inevitably bound to create French indigna
tion and understanding, at a Hfne when we can
ili afford further estrangement with our allies.
Nevertheless, it does not seem fair to suggest, as
Mr. Barret does, that Washington and London
acted with complete lack o'f sensitivity and fail
ure to foresee unpleasant consequences. This is
a complex and emotionally charged situation, in
which we almost certainly not without some re
luctance and regret took a course that seemed
to us to represent the lesser of two evils; and in
which France for her part surely cannot be held
wholly blameless.

Sffjuoia luli'or s Irresponsibility

Editor, Tho Daily:
The current issue of the Sequoia (Stanford's
Literary Magazine) features an editorial calcu
lated to sell magazines and promote controversy.
These are both laudable motives, but T would
like to discuss in some detail ihe irresponsibility
(if iho editor's comments. First, the subject of
Hie editorial, a suppressed graduate student, will
he recognized by many old Daily readers as the
incoherent Cato. a frequent contributor of letters
on surprisingly few subjects, mostly dealing with
inherent fascism and complacency in Stanford
iludents. This Cato's literary efforts were re
jected regularly by Sequoia while 1 was a staff
member-, because they were little more than ex
tended and confused magnifications of his Daily
letters, ditto his "suppressed leaflets." While the
Sequoia editor leads her readers to believe that
Cato-Bosmajian's leaflets were suppressed by the
"administration" for their leftist tendencies, the
simple fact is printed in the editorial, namely
1!:al Cato's advisey found these poorly thought
out. politically and socially inane leaflets incom
patible with study for a Ph.D. Certainly, they
were poor efforts.
At the time they ceased to appear, some stu
dents were talking with a professor, and one of
them suggested that it had been suppressed. He
snorted, and replied that no department would
object to any qualified or intellectually respec
table effort, and that if they had suggested that
he stop, Cato could have forced the issue, if he
had any intellectual ground to stand on. He was,
however, easily intimidated, and Non Grata dis
appeared. I offer, then, that Miss Ogden's analy
sis is misleading. It is especially misleading
because she apparently deliberately confuses the
circumstances of Cato's adviser's remark with
1 lie quoted "University policy." That this "Uni
versity policy" has little direct connection with
Cato-Bosmajian and Non Grata can be easily
shown.
First, the interview in which these quotes were
taken occurred this quarter, long after Non Gra
ta's demise. The spokesman, Dr. Glover, was
confronted with the facts in an interview, and
asked for his justification of the adviser's policy.
His remarks are so arranged by Miss Ogden as
to infer that he supported a summary silencing
of all such propaganda as Non Grata. I suggest
rather, that Dr. Glover was only supporting the
adviser's contention (which was only a sugges
tion) that 'such efforts were "irresponsible."
Perhaps Dr. Glover overstated the case; it was
after all nn.interview, not a press release, and his
function in the University is to support the fac
ulty. '
Miss Ogden infers a good deal from this small
event. First, she concludes that the University
(whoever they or that may be) is rigidly con
trolling ihe spontaneous expression of student
opinion. Second, she concludes that this particu
lar effort was summarily squelched. Mr. Bosma
jian seems easily squelched; he apparently was
unwilling to force the issue, if, indeed, disregard
ing a suggestion would have been forceful.
The editorial, then, seems irresponsible on
two counts: that it marries two time-separated
events, the interview and the demise of the un
lamented Non Grata, and then infers for the
reader that the University is rigidly controlling
opinion. Miss Ogden's opinion is too hasty, and
it will not be supported until a leaflet writer
appears who is on better intellectual ground than
Mr. Bosmajian, and who has the courage of his
convictions.
Sequoia editors have recently departed from
purely literary editorials on the subject of fic
tion ; Miss Ogden, however, is the first to flavor
an editorial with the devices of fiction itself.

Sequoia editor leads her readers to believe that
Cato-Bosmajian's leaflets were suppressed by the
"administration" for their leftist tendencies, the
simple fact is printed in the editorial, namely
1!:al Cato's advisey found these poorly thought
out. politically and socially inane leaflets incom
patible with study for a Ph.D. Certainly, they
were poor efforts.
At the time they ceased to appear, some stu
dents were talking with a professor, and one of
them suggested that it had been suppressed. He
snorted, and replied that no department would
object to any qualified or intellectually respec
table effort, and that if they had suggested that
he stop, Cato could have forced the issue, if he
had any intellectual ground to stand on. He was,
however, easily intimidated, and Non Grata dis
appeared. I offer, then, that Miss Ogden's analy
sis is misleading. It is especially misleading
because she apparently deliberately confuses the
circumstances of Cato's adviser's remark with
1 lie quoted "University policy." That this "Uni
versity policy" has little direct connection with
Cato-Bosmajian and Non Grata can be easily
shown.
First, the interview in which these quotes were
taken occurred this quarter, long after Non Gra
ta's demise. The spokesman, Dr. Glover, was
confronted with the facts in an interview, and
asked for his justification of the adviser's policy.
His remarks are so arranged by Miss Ogden as
to infer that he supported a summary silencing
of all such propaganda as Non Grata. I suggest
rather, that Dr. Glover was only supporting the
adviser's contention (which was only a sugges
tion) that 'such efforts were "irresponsible."
Perhaps Dr. Glover overstated the case; it was
after all nn.interview, not a press release, and his
function in the University is to support the fac
ulty. '
Miss Ogden infers a good deal from this small
event. First, she concludes that the University
(whoever they or that may be) is rigidly con
trolling ihe spontaneous expression of student
opinion. Second, she concludes that this particu
lar effort was summarily squelched. Mr. Bosma
jian seems easily squelched; he apparently was
unwilling to force the issue, if, indeed, disregard
ing a suggestion would have been forceful.
The editorial, then, seems irresponsible on
two counts: that it marries two time-separated
events, the interview and the demise of the un
lamented Non Grata, and then infers for the
reader that the University is rigidly controlling
opinion. Miss Ogden's opinion is too hasty, and
it will not be supported until a leaflet writer
appears who is on better intellectual ground than
Mr. Bosmajian, and who has the courage of his
convictions.
Sequoia editors have recently departed from
purely literary editorials on the subject of fic
tion ; Miss Ogden, however, is the first to flavor
an editorial with the devices of fiction itself.

The football season is over, and 1957's card
stunts are history. In general, I think this year's
stunts were something of which Stanford can be
proud. The stunts themselves were new and
novel, but it was student co-operation which
made those stunts go off well. For the most
part, the co-operation was excellent. Therefore,
on behalf of myself and Rally Commission I

The statement by Michel Barret (The Daily,
Nov. 19) regarding the Anglo-American arms
shipment to Tunisia calls /or some comment.
Mr. Barret stales I hat France was not consulted
and ''did not know about" the shipment. How
ever, according to responsible American news
sources 'e.g.. Edward R. Murrow and Howard K.
Smith of CBS, and the New York Times of Sun
day, Nov. 17), this was not the case. On the
contrary, France was fully aware of the inten
tion of America and Britain to support Western
arms shipments to Tunisia, and moreover was
urged by tho two countries to supply the arms
herself. France was indeed willing to send arms,
but only on conditions unacceptable to the Bour
guiba government as infringing on Tunisian sov
ereignty. The Anglo-American decision was crys
tallized in the face of an offer by Egypt to sup
ply the arms. Of this final decision France was
informed also, although admittedly her reaction
was one of strong protest.
Mr. Barret raises a second point which is de
batable. This is his conviction that the arms sent
to Tunisia will be promptly relayed to the Al
gerian rebels to be used against French troops.
While this is admittedly out of the question, nev
ertheless there are reasons for believing that it
is not highly probable. For one thing, Washing
ton receiver! "the most explicit assurances" (The
New York Times, Nov. 17) that the arms were
considered nontransferable, to be used for defen
sive purposes only. It is of course hard to eval
uate such an agreement, but at least it is a mat
ler of record that this condition was made. Fur
thermore, Premier Bourguiba is generally re
garded as a responsible statesman who has
shown considerable concern in the. peaceful set
tlement of the Algerian war, and would there
fore seem unlikely to take an action calculated
to intensify and prolong the conflict.
The entire affair has been unfortunate, and
was inevitably bound to create French indigna
tion and understanding, at a Hfne when we can
ili afford further estrangement with our allies.
Nevertheless, it does not seem fair to suggest, as
Mr. Barret does, that Washington and London
acted with complete lack o'f sensitivity and fail
ure to foresee unpleasant consequences. This is
a complex and emotionally charged situation, in
which we almost certainly not without some re
luctance and regret took a course that seemed
to us to represent the lesser of two evils; and in
which France for her part surely cannot be held
wholly blameless.

The football season is over, and 1957's card
stunts are history. In general, I think this year's
stunts were something of which Stanford can be
proud. The stunts themselves were new and
novel, but it was student co-operation which
made those stunts go off well. For the most
part, the co-operation was excellent. Therefore,
on behalf of myself and Rally Commission I

The statement by Michel Barret (The Daily,
Nov. 19) regarding the Anglo-American arms
shipment to Tunisia calls /or some comment.
Mr. Barret stales I hat France was not consulted
and ''did not know about" the shipment. How
ever, according to responsible American news
sources 'e.g.. Edward R. Murrow and Howard K.
Smith of CBS, and the New York Times of Sun
day, Nov. 17), this was not the case. On the
contrary, France was fully aware of the inten
tion of America and Britain to support Western
arms shipments to Tunisia, and moreover was
urged by tho two countries to supply the arms
herself. France was indeed willing to send arms,
but only on conditions unacceptable to the Bour
guiba government as infringing on Tunisian sov
ereignty. The Anglo-American decision was crys
tallized in the face of an offer by Egypt to sup
ply the arms. Of this final decision France was
informed also, although admittedly her reaction
was one of strong protest.
Mr. Barret raises a second point which is de
batable. This is his conviction that the arms sent
to Tunisia will be promptly relayed to the Al
gerian rebels to be used against French troops.
While this is admittedly out of the question, nev
ertheless there are reasons for believing that it
is not highly probable. For one thing, Washing
ton receiver! "the most explicit assurances" (The
New York Times, Nov. 17) that the arms were
considered nontransferable, to be used for defen
sive purposes only. It is of course hard to eval
uate such an agreement, but at least it is a mat
ler of record that this condition was made. Fur
thermore, Premier Bourguiba is generally re
garded as a responsible statesman who has
shown considerable concern in the. peaceful set
tlement of the Algerian war, and would there
fore seem unlikely to take an action calculated
to intensify and prolong the conflict.
The entire affair has been unfortunate, and
was inevitably bound to create French indigna
tion and understanding, at a Hfne when we can
ili afford further estrangement with our allies.
Nevertheless, it does not seem fair to suggest, as
Mr. Barret does, that Washington and London
acted with complete lack o'f sensitivity and fail
ure to foresee unpleasant consequences. This is
a complex and emotionally charged situation, in
which we almost certainly not without some re
luctance and regret took a course that seemed
to us to represent the lesser of two evils; and in
which France for her part surely cannot be held
wholly blameless.

Sffjuoia luli'or s Irresponsibility

Editor, Tho Daily:
The current issue of the Sequoia (Stanford's
Literary Magazine) features an editorial calcu
lated to sell magazines and promote controversy.
These are both laudable motives, but T would
like to discuss in some detail ihe irresponsibility
(if iho editor's comments. First, the subject of
Hie editorial, a suppressed graduate student, will
he recognized by many old Daily readers as the
incoherent Cato. a frequent contributor of letters
on surprisingly few subjects, mostly dealing with
inherent fascism and complacency in Stanford
iludents. This Cato's literary efforts were re
jected regularly by Sequoia while 1 was a staff
member-, because they were little more than ex
tended and confused magnifications of his Daily
letters, ditto his "suppressed leaflets." While the
Sequoia editor leads her readers to believe that
Cato-Bosmajian's leaflets were suppressed by the
"administration" for their leftist tendencies, the
simple fact is printed in the editorial, namely
1!:al Cato's advisey found these poorly thought
out. politically and socially inane leaflets incom
patible with study for a Ph.D. Certainly, they
were poor efforts.
At the time they ceased to appear, some stu
dents were talking with a professor, and one of
them suggested that it had been suppressed. He
snorted, and replied that no department would
object to any qualified or intellectually respec
table effort, and that if they had suggested that
he stop, Cato could have forced the issue, if he
had any intellectual ground to stand on. He was,
however, easily intimidated, and Non Grata dis
appeared. I offer, then, that Miss Ogden's analy
sis is misleading. It is especially misleading
because she apparently deliberately confuses the
circumstances of Cato's adviser's remark with
1 lie quoted "University policy." That this "Uni
versity policy" has little direct connection with
Cato-Bosmajian and Non Grata can be easily
shown.
First, the interview in which these quotes were
taken occurred this quarter, long after Non Gra
ta's demise. The spokesman, Dr. Glover, was
confronted with the facts in an interview, and
asked for his justification of the adviser's policy.
His remarks are so arranged by Miss Ogden as
to infer that he supported a summary silencing
of all such propaganda as Non Grata. I suggest
rather, that Dr. Glover was only supporting the
adviser's contention (which was only a sugges
tion) that 'such efforts were "irresponsible."
Perhaps Dr. Glover overstated the case; it was
after all nn.interview, not a press release, and his
function in the University is to support the fac
ulty. '
Miss Ogden infers a good deal from this small
event. First, she concludes that the University
(whoever they or that may be) is rigidly con
trolling ihe spontaneous expression of student
opinion. Second, she concludes that this particu
lar effort was summarily squelched. Mr. Bosma
jian seems easily squelched; he apparently was
unwilling to force the issue, if, indeed, disregard
ing a suggestion would have been forceful.
The editorial, then, seems irresponsible on
two counts: that it marries two time-separated
events, the interview and the demise of the un
lamented Non Grata, and then infers for the
reader that the University is rigidly controlling
opinion. Miss Ogden's opinion is too hasty, and
it will not be supported until a leaflet writer
appears who is on better intellectual ground than
Mr. Bosmajian, and who has the courage of his
convictions.
Sequoia editors have recently departed from
purely literary editorials on the subject of fic
tion ; Miss Ogden, however, is the first to flavor
an editorial with the devices of fiction itself.

appeared. I offer, then, that Miss Ogden's analy
sis is misleading. It is especially misleading
because she apparently deliberately confuses the
circumstances of Cato's adviser's remark with
1 lie quoted "University policy." That this "Uni
versity policy" has little direct connection with
Cato-Bosmajian and Non Grata can be easily
shown.
First, the interview in which these quotes were
taken occurred this quarter, long after Non Gra
ta's demise. The spokesman, Dr. Glover, was
confronted with the facts in an interview, and
asked for his justification of the adviser's policy.
His remarks are so arranged by Miss Ogden as
to infer that he supported a summary silencing
of all such propaganda as Non Grata. I suggest
rather, that Dr. Glover was only supporting the
adviser's contention (which was only a sugges
tion) that 'such efforts were "irresponsible."
Perhaps Dr. Glover overstated the case; it was
after all nn.interview, not a press release, and his
function in the University is to support the fac
ulty. '
Miss Ogden infers a good deal from this small
event. First, she concludes that the University
(whoever they or that may be) is rigidly con
trolling ihe spontaneous expression of student
opinion. Second, she concludes that this particu
lar effort was summarily squelched. Mr. Bosma
jian seems easily squelched; he apparently was
unwilling to force the issue, if, indeed, disregard
ing a suggestion would have been forceful.
The editorial, then, seems irresponsible on
two counts: that it marries two time-separated
events, the interview and the demise of the un
lamented Non Grata, and then infers for the
reader that the University is rigidly controlling
opinion. Miss Ogden's opinion is too hasty, and
it will not be supported until a leaflet writer
appears who is on better intellectual ground than
Mr. Bosmajian, and who has the courage of his
convictions.
Sequoia editors have recently departed from
purely literary editorials on the subject of fic
tion ; Miss Ogden, however, is the first to flavor
an editorial with the devices of fiction itself.

ihe United States is within 50 years of being a

The United States does not need a new "gel

and universal freedom which we preach to our
children. The U.S. does not need to make a real
effort, no matter what the cost in taxes, to pro

putting anything but a dog in a satellite. Good
Old American Ingenuity, competitive industry
and enlightened science will win out. ICBM and
satellites are not really vital to the future of
this country. What happened when a few Hun

not important to the future. Let us forget these

tinue to devote our finest minds and best efforts
to the really important problems, the problems
we know in our hearts are the vital ones. Now
and in years to come Stanford students should
concentrate on how to add more chrome to the
forward look, how to improve the nation's bridge
game and how to perfect color television. As
long as we students do nothing constructive
about Muttnik and Budapest, our children will
be able to watch the World Series on color tele

Editor, The Daily;
The football season is over, and 1957's card
stunts are history. In general, I think this year's
stunts were something of which Stanford can be
proud. The stunts themselves were new and
novel, but it was student co-operation which
made those stunts go off well. For the most
part, the co-operation was excellent. Therefore,
on behalf of myself and Rally Commission I
would like to thank the rootirig section for their
part in making the stunts a success. Congratu
lations for a good job.

The statement by Michel Barret (The Daily,
Nov. 19) regarding the Anglo-American arms
shipment to Tunisia calls /or some comment.
Mr. Barret stales I hat France was not consulted
and ''did not know about" the shipment. How
ever, according to responsible American news
sources 'e.g.. Edward R. Murrow and Howard K.
Smith of CBS, and the New York Times of Sun
day, Nov. 17), this was not the case. On the
contrary, France was fully aware of the inten
tion of America and Britain to support Western
arms shipments to Tunisia, and moreover was
urged by tho two countries to supply the arms
herself. France was indeed willing to send arms,
but only on conditions unacceptable to the Bour
guiba government as infringing on Tunisian sov
ereignty. The Anglo-American decision was crys
tallized in the face of an offer by Egypt to sup
ply the arms. Of this final decision France was
informed also, although admittedly her reaction
was one of strong protest.
Mr. Barret raises a second point which is de
batable. This is his conviction that the arms sent
to Tunisia will be promptly relayed to the Al
gerian rebels to be used against French troops.
While this is admittedly out of the question, nev
ertheless there are reasons for believing that it
is not highly probable. For one thing, Washing
ton receiver! "the most explicit assurances" (The
New York Times, Nov. 17) that the arms were
considered nontransferable, to be used for defen
sive purposes only. It is of course hard to eval
uate such an agreement, but at least it is a mat
ler of record that this condition was made. Fur
thermore, Premier Bourguiba is generally re
garded as a responsible statesman who has
shown considerable concern in the. peaceful set
tlement of the Algerian war, and would there
fore seem unlikely to take an action calculated
to intensify and prolong the conflict.
The entire affair has been unfortunate, and
was inevitably bound to create French indigna
tion and understanding, at a Hfne when we can
ili afford further estrangement with our allies.
Nevertheless, it does not seem fair to suggest, as
Mr. Barret does, that Washington and London
acted with complete lack o'f sensitivity and fail
ure to foresee unpleasant consequences. This is
a complex and emotionally charged situation, in
which we almost certainly not without some re
luctance and regret took a course that seemed
to us to represent the lesser of two evils; and in
which France for her part surely cannot be held
wholly blameless.

Sffjuoia luli'or s Irresponsibility

Editor, Tho Daily:
The current issue of the Sequoia (Stanford's
Literary Magazine) features an editorial calcu
lated to sell magazines and promote controversy.
These are both laudable motives, but T would
like to discuss in some detail ihe irresponsibility
(if iho editor's comments. First, the subject of
Hie editorial, a suppressed graduate student, will
he recognized by many old Daily readers as the
incoherent Cato. a frequent contributor of letters
on surprisingly few subjects, mostly dealing with
inherent fascism and complacency in Stanford
iludents. This Cato's literary efforts were re
jected regularly by Sequoia while 1 was a staff
member-, because they were little more than ex
tended and confused magnifications of his Daily
letters, ditto his "suppressed leaflets." While the
Sequoia editor leads her readers to believe that
Cato-Bosmajian's leaflets were suppressed by the
"administration" for their leftist tendencies, the
simple fact is printed in the editorial, namely
1!:al Cato's advisey found these poorly thought
out. politically and socially inane leaflets incom
patible with study for a Ph.D. Certainly, they
were poor efforts.
At the time they ceased to appear, some stu
dents were talking with a professor, and one of
them suggested that it had been suppressed. He
snorted, and replied that no department would
object to any qualified or intellectually respec
table effort, and that if they had suggested that
he stop, Cato could have forced the issue, if he
had any intellectual ground to stand on. He was,
however, easily intimidated, and Non Grata dis
appeared. I offer, then, that Miss Ogden's analy
sis is misleading. It is especially misleading
because she apparently deliberately confuses the
circumstances of Cato's adviser's remark with
