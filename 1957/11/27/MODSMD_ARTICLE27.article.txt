# 'YOUNG SOCIALIST' WRITERS
## Socialists Bemoan Lack Of Farm Political Liberty 
### 
Two Bay Area correspondents for the "Young Socialist," student
run monthly Socialist newspaper, came to campus yesterday to in
vestigate student political activity and found Stanford "no exception
to the general pattern of repressing student democracy."
Jim Robertson and Boh Irish, both Cal students, write for the

three-month-old paper, which is
published in New York and al
ready boasts circulation in Can
ada, South America and England
as well as in the United States.
They found formal freedom of
expression at Stanford disap
pointing, "in comparison with
other universities of comparable
type and level."
Robertson saw the lack of the
right to distribute material on
campus particularly unfortunate
"especially in a university like
j this, which ranks academically
i with Harvard, Columbia and the
j University of Chicago."
Students Inhibited
He said the Stanford adminis
tration "'doesn't want students
to become involved in political
campaigning and creates a pro
hibitive, negative atmosphere
which inhibits student interest in
political matters."
He added, "In this century, stu
dents don't riot or seek to assas
sinate senators."
But Robertson said Stanford
political activity is much freer
than that of California state uni
versities.
However, he accounted for this
in part by the greater interest in
politics among state university
students and a "'direct propor
tion" aspect of administration
control "the more students are
interested in political activity, the
more the university administra
tion seeks to control them."
Irish, who attended yesterday's
YWCA luncheon discussion meet
ing. found students "beginning to
be interested in radical and so
cialist ideas." But he said "few
students are consciously Social
ists. although ihe logic of their
arguments is leading them that
way."
Newspapers I'urged
Irish saw The Daily as "one of
the most open elements in cam
pus life—a distinction Stanford
shares with other top-quality uni
versities."
He said the "most characteris
tic repression" of student free
dom on college campuses has
been the administration "purg
ing" of student newspaper edi
torial boards, such as the recent
purge of the UCLA Daily Bruin.

Two Bay Area correspondents for the "Young Socialist," student
run monthly Socialist newspaper, came to campus yesterday to in
vestigate student political activity and found Stanford "no exception
to the general pattern of repressing student democracy."
Jim Robertson and Boh Irish, both Cal students, write for the

three-month-old paper, which is
published in New York and al
ready boasts circulation in Can
ada, South America and England
as well as in the United States.
They found formal freedom of
expression at Stanford disap
pointing, "in comparison with
other universities of comparable
type and level."
Robertson saw the lack of the
right to distribute material on
campus particularly unfortunate
"especially in a university like
j this, which ranks academically
i with Harvard, Columbia and the
j University of Chicago."
Students Inhibited
He said the Stanford adminis
tration "'doesn't want students
to become involved in political
campaigning and creates a pro
hibitive, negative atmosphere
which inhibits student interest in
political matters."
He added, "In this century, stu
dents don't riot or seek to assas
sinate senators."
But Robertson said Stanford
political activity is much freer
than that of California state uni
versities.
However, he accounted for this
in part by the greater interest in
politics among state university
students and a "'direct propor
tion" aspect of administration
control "the more students are
interested in political activity, the
more the university administra
tion seeks to control them."
Irish, who attended yesterday's
YWCA luncheon discussion meet
ing. found students "beginning to
be interested in radical and so
cialist ideas." But he said "few
students are consciously Social
ists. although ihe logic of their
arguments is leading them that
way."
Newspapers I'urged
Irish saw The Daily as "one of
the most open elements in cam
pus life—a distinction Stanford
shares with other top-quality uni
versities."

tic repression" of student free
dom on college campuses has
