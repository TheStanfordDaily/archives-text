# Warren Wonka In Army News
## 
### 
One of Stanford's best-known
"students" has made news again,
this time in Kirch - Goens, Ger
many.
Warren G. Wonka turned up in
the Nov. 15 issue of the Third
Armored Division newspaper in
an article forwarded to The Daily
by Stanford alumni Richard J.
Meyer, '54.
The story concerns a mysteri
ous- automobile which had given
birth to a legend. It seems that
Kaiser Wilhelm ordered a car for
his son during World War I. but
the teen-aged prince never had a
chance to pick it up, as he fled to
Holland and ultimately into exile.
The car changcd hands frequent
ly, as the owners had nothing but
bad luck.
Eventually, so the article states,
"Pfc. Warren G. Wonka, Hqs. Co.,
CCA, took over the jinxed auto.
He tried to register the vehicle
with the provost marshal, but un
fortunately the vehicle did not
pass inspection, and its papers
were not approved. The car had
apparently reached the end of its
road.
"When Pfc. Wonka rotated back
lo the States last spring, the car
had disappeared. Until last week
nobody knew what had happened
to it; it had just gone.
"Last week the car appeared
suddenly in front of the CCA in
door range, but, true to form, dis
appeared before the wrecker ar
rived to tow it away. The next
day, however, it was finally taken
to the junk yard."
And so ends the story of the
legendary car. But our hero, War
ren G. Wonka, continues to live.
