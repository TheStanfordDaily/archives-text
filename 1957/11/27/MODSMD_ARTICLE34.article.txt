# Indian Sports Scene Shifts:
## C.O.P. Tigers, St. Mary's Gaels Are First Opponents for Cards 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Winter sports come into full bloom Monday and Tuesday nights as the Stanford Indians open the
1957-58 basketball season hef-e in the Pavilion. The first-night opponent will be College of Pacific,
with St. Mary's moving in for the Tuesday encounter. Both games will begin at 8.
Howie Dallmar's Indians go into both games with little or no knowledge of their opponents. Both
the Tigers and Gaels will be playing their openers, and so there may be plenly of surprises from all

throe clubs.
Monday's game will bo the first
of a 25-game schedule for the
Cards this season. After the St.
Mary's encounter they will lake
time out for Dead and Finals
weeks, then will pick up tempo
with six games in Iho next 10
days.
The Tribe's PCC schedule will
begin Jan. 3 in Moscow, Ida., and
will conclude March 8 against Or
egon. Sixteen of the 25 games will
be of the conference variety.
Stanford embarks on the season
with the youngest and tallest
team in the school's history. A
starling lineup of three juniors
and two sophs averages (5-1 1 and
shows promise of giving the In
dians one of their better clubs of
recent years.
Three Vcls
Three of the top six men from!
last year's team return to join the;
starting aggregation. Paul Neu
mann, Dick Ilaga and John Pflue
ger, all juniors, have each shown j
plenty of improvement from their
already good showings of last;
year.
Ilaga, at 6-5. has grown an inch
from last winter and so should be!
even better under the boards.
Pfluoger alternated at guard and 1
forward in *SG-'57, but has moved j
into the forward slot for this cam- |
paign.
Neumann, who showed great !
court promise even in his prep I
days at Newport High School, will ,
direct the Indian floor game from :
his guard position.
Jump Shot
Neumann will utilize both his I
excellent jump shot and good driv- j
ing abilities in helping Stanford
score. At the other guard spot, j
Dallmar will have John Arrillaga, !
brother of Cal's quarterback Gabe.
Arrillaga laid out of varsity
competition last winter, but shows i
promise of being one of Stanford's i
best-ever ball handlers.
The key to Stanford's hoop for-;
tunes may well lie at center. Neal !
Brockmeycr, a 6-Blt sophomore,!
has impressed Dallmar with his j
tremendous improvement fro m ;
last year and has nailed down the j
job. But Brockmeyer's problem'
may be inexperience.
"Learn by Playing"
Dallmar says, however: "Thej
sophs will just have to learn by I
playing. That's what we did with i
Haga, Pflueger and Neumann last
year, and they all came through." !
The Indians' present second
team also has three juniors and a i
pair of sophomores. Jerry Theu
sen and Phil Joujon-Roche. at 6-7
and 6-K resnectively, are the tall;
ones of the second squad. Doug ■
Warren and Kent Carter hold!
down the second-team guard posi
tions, w i th Jerry Rose joining
Thouson at forward.
A pair of footballers, Chris Bur
ford and Gary Van Galder, are < x
pectefl to help Stanford cage for-1
tunes as soon as I hoy get in shape
for basket bail.
Burford was a standout as a
frosh last year and is expected to
make a serious bid for the first
loam. Van Galder, a capable guard
all last season, will bo the team's
only senior.
