# THE 						Finish Line

Let's Keep it in the Family
So now the Stanford head football coaching job is vacant, and
everyone is getting into the act trying to guess who the job will go to.
An assistant? Ruck Shaw? Frankie Albert? Joe Ruetz? All these
have been mentioned, and some have already declined with thanks.
1 hope the University selects one of the present assistant coaches
as the new head coach. Here's why:
I would like to see .Stanford continue to use the Taylor offensive
system with its wide-open type of play. Stanford needs a wide-open
system; not just because it makes an interesting game, but because
ii is undoubtedly one of the few systems that can work with success
here. It's been pointed out time and time again that Stanford doesn't
get the pick of the high school grid crop by any means. As a result,
the Indians usually don't have the size and depth of many of their
opponents. So, Stanford has to resort to outsmarting the other team
and Stanford players have the intelligence to do it, provided they
are using a system that leaves room for brains and not just brawn.
The flanker-T setup of Taylor's has been proven over the past seven
years as a system that Stanford can use to hold its own.
If we decide that Stanfoid should keep its present system, then
it's only-logical that the man most qualified to teach it would be one
who has assisted Taylor with it.
George Lynn, Dutch Fehring, Pete Kmetovic, Ilerm Meister, Bob
Ghilotti they've all done a good job helping Taylor with the system.
Taylor himself has said so on numerous occasions.
Still talking about systems, Stanford certainly shouldn't go to the
split T. Granted it's the up-and-coming tiling in college football, lint
i where is it in use successfully? At the schools that have the best
players money can buy; at the schools that have the horses up front
who can push for three yards on every play and hope to hit pay dirt
before a penalty or fumble halts a drive.
To see what happens when there aren't the 250: pounders to work
the split T, we don't even have to look outside the PGC. This year
there were three new young coaches in the conference. All came up
through the split-T school of thinking, and all used it this .fall.
, So what happened? The three teams won a total of five games
and lost 24. And, at that, three of the five victories couldn't be
avoided the schools were playing each other.
Aside from the technical aspects of the split T, there have been
plenty of grumbles from the spectator angle. It's a cinch the games
wouldn't be as wide open and exciting, and Stanford students don't
want any part of them. Myre than one has remarked: "I won't go
and see them play if they.use the split T. It's the dullest thing I've
ever seen."
From the players' standpoint, there's plenty of sentiment toward
keeping the coaching job in the present family. The players don't
want to switch systems, and they're afraid that might happen if an
outsider took over. They'll feel a lot more secure, too, if a man who
has been with them for at least a year takes over the reins, rather
than one who doesn't know who's what.
Then, too, there's the question of what would happen to the
present staff if a new man came in. It's a fairly regular procedure
for a new coach to bring his own assistants. And the five Stanford
assistants have proven themselves too valuable to be let go.
Finally, there's traditioniin favor of moving up one of the present
staff. After all, Stanford always talks about ihe "Stanford family,"
so isn't this a good time to keep something in the family?
Time for Police Action
Saturday's Big Game ending proved the need for some sort of
changes or adjustments in the method of policing the crowd at foot
ball games.
As we pointed up in Monday's Daily, no one will ever know what
Ihe score really was because of the huge crowd that converged on
the players as the last play was run off. Either way Stanford won.
and so Cal has no comeback.
But what if it had been Cal on the Stanford one-yard line as the
game ended? 11 the game had hinged on that last chaos-surrounded
play, there would probably still be rioting going on in the stadium.
What it all boils down to is that some way must be found to keep
people off the fieldâ€”at least until the game is over. The student
police have tried using ropes this year, but haven't had much success
at it. Of course, the old llying-mare method will always handle a few
ol the invaders, but a few student police can't wrestle with a thousand
little kids.
Maybe the solution is some sort of temporary fence between the
stands and the field; maybe even a permanent barrier is needed, but
let's hwpe not.
At any rate, the powers-that-be should see to it that no game ever
comes as close as Saturday's to being undecided because of an unruly
crowd.
Another note on the hectic finish: There were 10 seconds to play
when Douglas hit the line. If he did score, the clock should have been
v.topped, probably with at least two or three seconds to go. Since the
P.A.T. does not use up game lime, there would have been time for a
kickoff. And what if the kickoff had been run back for a touchdown?
Hmmmmm. Maybe the score should actually have been 21-18 instead
of 14-12.
**
A FINAL WORD OF CONGRATULATIONS to Chuck Taylor
and his staff and to Hie entire Stanford football team for providing
some of the best and most exciting action we've ever seen. You may
not have been the most consistent, but. on a given day, you coulr\
beat anyone.
