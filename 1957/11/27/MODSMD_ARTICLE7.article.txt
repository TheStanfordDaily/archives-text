# Happy Finals!
## 
### 
THE END ArritOA< lIESâ€”Soon it will all be over but the study
ing, and since Hie Daily staff is forced to fake finals like everyone
else, we are throwing in the sponge to settle down to some serious
cramming. This will, therefore, be the last issue of The Stanford
Daily in 1957. Unless we all 112 lunk out. The Daily will resume pub
lishing Monday, Jan. (>, 11)58. Until then, we wish you a successful
finals week and a safe, sane and relaxed vacation!
