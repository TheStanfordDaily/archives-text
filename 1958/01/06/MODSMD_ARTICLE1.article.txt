# Stanford Will Begin Construction Of Housing for Married Students
## 
### 
Stanford will start construc
tion this year on the first $3 mil
lion phase of a married student
apartment program.
Wuester, Bernardi & Emmons,
San Francisco architects, have
been engaged as executive archi
tects for stage one, which will
provide 250 apartments in a proj
ect that is expected to number
eventually 1250 to 1500 living
units.
The new community will be lo
cated on 175 acres of Stanford
land southeast of the main aca
demic and residence hall area, ly
ing along Stanford Avenue from
El Camino Real to the new Pine
Hill faculty housing subdivision.
■ The initial units will be built
near the intersection of Eseon
dido Road and Stanford Avenue,
taking advantage of a large
wooded area. It is expected they
will be ready for occupancy with
the opening of the school year in
September, 1959.
Loan Application
The Housing and Home Fi
nance Agency has approved Stan
ford's preliminary application for
a $3 million loan. The final appli
cation, including architectural
studies, is being prepared. The
project is to be financially self
supporting.
"Our standard is to create a
stimulating, refreshing environ
ment which will give incentive to
cultural endeavor," said Eldridge
T. Spencer, director of Stanford
planning, who will be supervising
architect of the project.
Married students, who flocked
to Stanford and other campuses
following World War 11, are now
recognized as a permanent part
of the student population, accord
ing to Spencer.
"A survey shows that 1532. or
nearly one-fifth, of our students
are married," the architect de
clared. "Their children number
1579.
Housing Goal
"Stanford has had since its in
ception the goal of housing as
large a proportion of its student
body as possible. That is why,
under present conditions, an
apartment community must be
established."
He pointed out that the propor
tion of married students at Stan
ford and nationally has been ris
ing steadily in recent years and
some authorities expect it to
reach as much as 35 per cent
within the next 10 years.
Since 1945. the University has
had approximately 300 rental
apartments for married student
families at Stanford Village. Ap
plicants have always far out
stripped the number of units and,

by agreement with the City of
Mcnlo Park, Stanford is to vacate
the property by 1965.
The initial 250 units in the new
project will probably be divided
into 63 one-bedroom, 150 two-bed
room and 37 three - bedroom
apartments.
They are conceived of as a
series of one- and two-story gar
den - type apartments. Central
laundry facilities and off - street
parking will be provided. A small
canteen is the only shopping fa
cility under consideration.
As planning progresses, eco
nomics may dictate that build
ings of more than two stories be
provided for married students
without children in order to keep

rentals down, the supervising ar
chitect declared.
The new buildings will be sepa
rated from El Camino Real and
Stanford Avenue by 200-foot-wide
landscaped buffers or green belts.
The site consists principally of
level, open fields with some
stands of mature trees which
were part of the landscaping of
#he ranch estate of Peter Coutts.
Two houses erected by "The
Frenchman"—as Coutts has been
called by generations of Stanford
students—still stand. These are
not affected by the first stage of
the married students housing
project. Later they may be in
corporated into plans for a meet
ing and recreational center.

"Our aim is a community
which allows a high degree of
family privacy without limiting
neighboriiness," Spencer pointed
out. "We wish also to avoid regi
mentation and to keep mainte
nance costs low.
