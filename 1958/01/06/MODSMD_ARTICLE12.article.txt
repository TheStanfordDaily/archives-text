C. Steere, dean of the Graduate
Division.
The new department opened of
ficially Jan. 2. A successor to
Huff as assistant dean is yet to

"The department will work as a
sort of long-range planning of
fice for the individual student's
financial future," said H. Donald
Winbiglor, dean of students.
"To do this effectively, we are
centralizing functions which pre

viously have been administered
by the deans of men and women,
the Financial Awards office and
tho Placement Service."
Part of Huff's job will cover
promotion of more student jobs
on the campus. His department
will maintain a balance between
jobs for students who need them
to stay in school and those which
are open to all students.
"It's our aim," Huff said, "to
maintain student employment at
a high level so that those in
greatest need will have an equal
opportunity to complete their
Stanford education. We don't
want to lose one student because
of money troubles."
He will co-ordinate recruitment
by other campus agencies, includ
ing the Athletic Department, the
Corporation Yard, the library and
the dining halls.
There are -100 hashing jobs
available yearly through the cam
pus dining halls and living
groups and approximately 120

part-time library positions for
students. A smaller number of
seasonal jobs as guards at games
is available through the Athletic
Department.
An indication of the increased
need for student jobs is shown
by the annual report of the Place
ment Service. Nearly 4600 Stan
ford students registered for work
during the last school year, and
3233 jobs, full or part-time, were
filled by the service.
Both figures show an increase
of 1000 over the 1955-56 demand,
reported Mrs. Barbara D. Coch
ran, assistant director of the
Placement Service.
Beginning with tho fall term
next year, the University will
charge $285 a quarter for room
and board, a $35 increase over
tho current cost, and tuition will
go from $250 to $335 a quarter.
These boosts, tho first in several
years, were made necessary by
rising costs, University officials
said.
