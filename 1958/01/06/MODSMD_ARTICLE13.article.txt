Pea-soup Fog
The CHP said a pea-soup fog
obscured the road and apparently
hid the curve from the girls' vis
ion.
William DeMichelis, 19, driver
of the school bus, said he saw the
tiny car hurtling toward him as
the bus was traveling toward the
bridge in the opposite direction,
toward Gilroy.
He told the CHP he steered the
bus as far to the right as he could,
but the Volkswagen appeared to
swerve out of control and it col
lided broadside against the front
of the bus. The car caromed off,
the CHP said, and came to rest
along the side of the road.
Officers said the car's left side
was mashed half the distance to
the right side and the roof was
sprung open.
Crushed Inside Car
The two girls were crushed in
side the car with the ski equip
ment. Miss Clark was reported
to have died instantly in the col
lision and Miss Harker was
thrown clear and rushed to the
Wheeler Hospital in Gilroy. She
was pronounced dead a few min
utes later.
