# Back to the Grindstone
## 
### 
\ u:viio\ is ovi.it, and it's time to get our noses
hack In I he proverbial grindstone. A couple of
daxs of liappv reunion with classmates and
friends, then hack to the grim task of soaking
in some knowledge.
The "I'rofessor Snarfs" on campus are glee
f illl \ wringing their hands in anticipation of
.• 11«>I her crop of meek lambs w hose grade point
averages I hey can reduce. And the Registrar's
Office personnel with their boxes full of regis
hafion hooks will happily pass them out to the
woebegone students who have to wait in line
to fill ill em out.
\ es, vacation is over. Sorry, but that's the
wax it is. Tomorrow classes commence, and
fainpu> organizations x\ ill soon smother lis \\ith
all kinds of activities to take our minds away
from our studies.
Momentous things have occurred since The
Dailx discontinued publishing preceding Dead
\\ <-rk last quarter. Three universities have
dropped out of the Pacific ('oast Conference,
\\illi a fourth advocating a complete break
down i)f the conference. Stanford's announced
decision is to juM sit tight and see what
happens.
Three more Stanford students died from
Iraflie accidents during the period The Daily
was not publishing. That brought the traffic
death total to five within a two-month period.
I hie. is a shockingly large number, especially
when there had been none in the previous
three xears. It behooves us all to use extra
precaution in our driving. We will not like to
have to report a -ixlh fatality.
I>ut there were pleasant things occurring
during this period too. One of the most thrill

ing was the defeat the University of San Fran
cisco Dons suffered al the hands of I he Stanford
basketball team. \\ e were there and we were
dumbfounded, as were all the other spectators.
This may be the only defeat the Dons will
siider for the rest of the season. Our team
hasn't done so well since then, but you cer
tainly cannot take that one away from them.
Then, there was the East-West football game,
which saw three Indians doing a remarkable
job of football. Jack Douglas and Don Manou
kian did especially well, with Manoukian win
ning an award for the best lineman on the field.
Gary \ an (wilder was used only on defense, but
did a great job in preventing fast runners from
tlie Fast from turning the corners.
Good news to students who intend to marry
before finishing their collegiate careers is the
announcement of the construction of housing
units for married students. It will probahlx be
another year before the units are finished, hut
then many of those interested now may be back
next year.
The Daily staff is liappv to he back in busi
ness. and we hope we may serve our readers
well this quarter. We have some special ar
ticles planned which we hope will prove fruit
ful to all.
> t es, vacation is over and, to a certain extent,
we're glad. It gets a little tiresome loafing for
three weeks. Of course, we haven't seen our
•Trades yet, but . . .
Well, it's a new year and we've made all
kinds of resolutions we're sure to break within
the next two weeks, such as studying, giving up
the flicks, organizing our time, restricting our
time at Rossotti's, and the like. Oh, well—
Happy New V ear, everybody! Welcome back!
