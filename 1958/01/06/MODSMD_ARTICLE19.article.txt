## Moneyless Monday—Terrible Tuesday 
### 
"Checkbook to checkbook . . (gasp) is the
theme song for returnees to the Farm as winter
quarter registration gets under way this morn
ing. Yes, those jolly clerks are all set up in the
Pavilion just waiting for the moolah to roll in
over the counter. Ho ho ho ho . . . Happy new
year! Ho ho ho!
And after the agony of registration is over,
there's always the Stanford Gift Store to look
forward to they also have a few textbooks to
peddle, and if you're lucky, you may be abje to
:'(>! one of your required texts after camping in
line for an eon or two. . . .

After Moneyless Monday comes Terrible Tues

The good old Tuesday Evening Series will be
popping away again with a panel discussion on
"The Challenge of Sputniks." Same old time and
place Mem Aud at 7:30.

Not to be outdone by the Tuesday Series, the

held in the Little Theatre of Mem Hall and will

urday at 2 and 4 p.m.
The first big culture seminar of the winter sea

matics Department Joint Stanford-Berkeley Col
loquium will present Cal's Profesor Jacob Borsuk
for a lively discussion of "Intuitive Topology and
lis Problems." Pull up a tesseract and settle
flown with your nth dimensional knitting at 4

p.m. in Room 65 for a nice confusing talk.
An even more tantalizing subject will be of
fered at the same time in Room e57 of Cubber
ley when the Philosophy Department Colloquium
hosts Richard Bevan Braithwaite for a talk on
"Why One Moral Philosopher Is Interested in
Theory of Games." The talk will be concluded
with a very moral Frisbee contest in Stanford
Stadium with a running scholarly discussion on

All the potential Borgias on the campus will he
delighted to know that an interesting flick is on
tap at the 7:30 Thursday Film Series at Cubber

those with strong tummies and disliked guests.

Friday night the Stanford cagers will meet
dear old Washington Slate in a PCC basketball
tussle. It's "Brooger the Cougar" at 8 sharp.
Afternoon basketball comes to the Pavilion at
2 on Saturday when U. of Washington arrives
for a joust with the Indians. "Hustle the Huskies
to Hades" would be an appropriate cheer.

Sunday afternoon at 4 will find harpsichord
music tinkling and gurgling from the confines of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium when Profesor Putnam
Aldrich presents a recital.
For the less cultured and more boisterous of
temperament, the Sunday Evening Flicks will
offer the ideal time to foam at the mouth. And
goshgeewowgaspshriekzoom, it's JAYNE MANS
FIELD this week, kiddies, busting forth from the
scrcen with "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"
Who gives a damn about Rock Hunter what
will JAYNE do to the popeyed audience? Don't
miss this epic—7:30 p.m. Zowie!
