# Stanford Scholar Compares SU, Free University of Berlin
## 
### Ellen Mauer 
Ellen Matter, who is cnrrent
ly a senior in chemical engi
neering af Stanford, went to
Keriin in 1956-57 on the Berlin
Affiliation Scholarship. This
year the Free University of
Berlin has again offered a full
scholarship. Details and appli
cations may he obtained at the
AKSI! office. The deadline is
Jan. 20. The following article
deals with Miss Mailer's expe
riences in Berlin.
Berlin is a most exciting, vital
city. In my first clays there 1 he
came acquainted witli the Free
University of Berlin. The uni
versity does not issue an an
nouncement of courses similar to
the one we know at Stanford.
A student may purchase a
booklet in which the courses of
fered are listed. However, the
student would still have to con
sult lists posted on a large cen
tral bulletin board to find out
where and when the lectures
were being held.
No Periodical Exams
German students have no peri
odical exams and no book assign
ments. For most courses there is
no required textbook. In a one
unit history course the professor
issued a mimeographed list of
recommended books. I was
amazed to find 63 different books
listed.

i The Free University does not
publish a daily newspaper. For
current news one has to read the
bulletin boards posted in strate
gic places to find out what is
happening where. To do so thor
! oughly takes about an hour per
week of bulletin board reading.
As a whole German students in
Berlin are poor in comparison
with Stanford students. Almost
no one owns a car. Students are
dependent on public transporta
' tion.
Originality in Dates
What the German lacks in the
way of funds, he makes up in the
way of originality in his dates. I
can recall a most enjoyable after
noon picking wild cherries, with
which we later baked a cherry
pie.
Often a friend and I would get
on the subway and ride to a sta
tion where we had never before
gotten out, get off there, and ex
plore Berlin.
The Fiee University was organ
ized in 1848 to provide academic
freedom, after the original Uni
versity of Berlin, the Humboldt
University, was enveloped in the
Russian sector. It now has 10.000
students.
Stanford helped foster the new
university in its earlier years by
sending books, clothing, food and
money to students during the air
lift.
