# PCC Split, Coach Hunt, Upset Of USF Enliven Card Holidays
## Curtice Tops Present List Of Prospects 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
There's no new coach on the
Stanford football scene as yet,
but it. isn't because no one's
thinking about the situation. Ru
mors, attributions and names
have been flying left and right
throughout the holiday period.
And as time and conjecture
march on, the name of Jack Cur
lice seems 10 become more firmly
entrenched in the center of the
picture.
Curtice said last week that he
had been approached concerning
the head coaching job here. He
added that he was happy at Utah,
but would listen to offers.
No Decision Vet
From the local scene, all indi
cations remained that no decision
would be reached—or at least no
announcement made- until after
the NCAA meetings being held
this week in Philadelphia.
Athletic Director A 1 Masters,
now at the gatherings, said sev
eral weeks ago that he would be
looking over the field of coaches
while in Ihe Fast.
Cactus Jack's name grabbed
the lead in (he rumor derby fol
lowing his coaching triumph over
the Fast in the Shrine game, 27-
13. The West squad trained at
Stanford, so Indian officials had
the opportunity of observing Cur
tice in action in what amounted
to a special introductory trial
period.
Impressive Work
What ('ui tice did with a collec
tion of lesser-known players im
pressed and surprised football
experts, and presumably caused
ihe same reaction among the men
who will choose a new coach.
Curtice's club played a wide
open game much in the Stan
ford pattern -and the Ute coach
showed his adaptability by tak
ing full advantage of the pro
idles under which the game was
played.
Stanford isn't the only school
in the market for the personable
Curtice's services, either; Texas
A«feM, which has been getting
rejection notices from leading
coaches in almost every mail, re
portedly has contacted him about
both the coaching position and
the athletic directorship.
The rest of the legion of out
siders whose names made some*
body-orother's rumor list have
pretty much fallen by the way
side.
Other Candidates
Ruck Shaw, Frankie Albert
and Eddie Frdelat/. all bowed out
quickly with thanks. Rob Rlack
man, an SC man now compiling
a successful record at Dartmouth,
was said to be favored by .some
alums from the Southland. Rut
that was a month ago, and little
more has been heard about him.
And some of the rest who were
mentioned, like Deke Brackett of
UCLA, proved to be one-time
shots only.
Those whose status is most
questionable are the present
Stanford assistants. When Chuck
Taylor first resigned, the initial
speculation was that an assistant
would inherit the job.
Their names remained promi
nent for a couple of weeks, and
then weren't heard 1 much as more
and more outsiders came into the
picture.
Not ail Assistant
Then last Saturday, Walt Gam
age of the Palo Alto Times wrote
that he had authoritative infor
mation that the five had been
told they were not under consid
eration for the job. Gamage fur
ther said that they were all given
transportation to the N'CAA
meeting in order to look for new
jobs.
Masters and Taylor, being in
Philadelphia, weren't available
for comment on the article.
All things considered, it looks
like Curtice may be the man to
put your money on if you're bet
ting on who'll get the vacant of
fice in the BAC. Rut the situa
tion is still miles high in the air.


SWISH —John Arrillaga, sur
prising sophomore on Howie
Dallmar's Stanford cagers, hits
for two against Sail Jose. He
heat USF with a jump shot in
the final three seconds and tops'
Indian scorers thus far.
