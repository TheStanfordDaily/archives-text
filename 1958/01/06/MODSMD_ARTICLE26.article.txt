# Shrine Trophy To Manoukian; Douglas Shines
## 
### 
For the third year in a row a
Stanford player has won one
of the two outstanding player
awards in the annual Fast-West
Shrine game. This year it was
Don Manoukian, whose spectacu
lar line play on both offense and
defense gained him the Spaulding
Award as the game's outstanding
lineman.
Last year Stanford's John Rro
die won the Most Valuable Play
er Award and the year before
Joe Long received the lineman's
award.
Manoukian, who was a substi
tute selection to the West squad
when Robby Oliver of Baylor was
suddenly called home, led the sur
prisingly strong West line as it
oul charged and outplayed the
highly rated East line, which con
sited of such All-Americans as
Alex Karras of lowa and Lou Mi
chaels of Kentucky.
Another Stanfordite, quarter
back Jack Douglas, engineered
the West offense which rolled up
four touchdowns to the oppo
nents' two. Douglas also follows
a Stanford tradition for this
game by being the third Stanford
quarterback in the last seven
years to lead a victorious West
team. In this seven-year period
those three games were the only
victories for the West.
Rrodie led last year's West
team while it was Robby Garrett
who quarterbacked the club five
years ago. Playing with Manou
kian in the line was Stanford end
Gary Van Galder, whose fine de
fensive play was another impor
tant factor in the West's success.
