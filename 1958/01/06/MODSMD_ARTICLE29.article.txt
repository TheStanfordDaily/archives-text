# Rugged Start for Cagers; Bow to Lowly Idaho, WSC
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Coach Howie Dallmar's Stan
ford Indians have gotten off to a
rocky 0-2 start in 1958 Pacific
Coast Conference basketball play.
The Indians opened with a 67-59
loss to the Idaho Vandals on rFi
day night in Moscow, and then
dropped their second game to the
Washington State Cougars in
Pullman, 64-51, on Saturday.
Neither of the winners had been
figured to make a conference
showing.
Captain Gary Simmons led the
Vandals with 21 points while
sophomore John Arrillaga con
tinued his scoring efforts of late
with a 19 point effort for the los
ing cause. The Idaho fast-break
was too much for the Injuns to
cope with, however.
Vandals Lead
Throughout, the first half the
Vandals managed to maintain a
6- to 11-point lead. At the half the
score read 36-29. * Hard play dom
inated the second half with the
locals pulling to a 40-39 lead on
the strength of Paul Neumann's
three jump shots in a row.
The Vandals pulled away, how
ever, and the best the locals could
do was to tie the game at 41-41.
From this point on they drifted.
All night the Indians had trouble
getting under the basket to shoot;
and Arrillaga's compensation by
hitting the long shots was not
enough.
Defense Strategy
Idaho defended Stanford with
a /.one defense, but midway
through the game they put a man
on Arrillaga. Paul Neumann
dropped in 17 points in the game.
Washington Slate ran away
with the game the following
night in handing the Cards the

i loss. The Cougars played a con
trol game throughout, relying on
coach Jack Friel's use of the two
platoon theory.
Early in the game it appeared
as though the Indians would have
an easy time of it as they coolly
walked into an 8-1 lead. But the
Cougars would not hear of it and
immediately began to close the
gap and push for the lead. They
had it at halftime, 39-29.
Pulled Away
Also using the fast break ef
fectively, the Cougars rolled on
to greater things in the second
trace. Washington State pumped
in 55 per cent of their field shots;
Stanford hit 37 per cent with a

miserable 27 per rent in the sec
ond half. The teams were even
on the backboards, each with 40
pull-offs.
Dick Haga and Arrillaga were
botli high with 14 counters. Vet
eran Jim Ross and sophomore
John Maras led WSC with 21 and
17 points respectively.
Stanford will have a chance to
strike back at the Cougars when
' the two teams meet in the Pavil
■ ion netx Friday at 8 p.m. On Sat
urday Ihe locals will play host to
j the Washington Huskies in what
i is probably an 8 p.m. start.

a /.one defense, but midway
through the game they put a man
on Arrillaga. Paul Neumann
dropped in 17 points in the game.
Washington Slate ran away
with the game the following
night in handing the Cards the

i loss. The Cougars played a con
trol game throughout, relying on
coach Jack Friel's use of the two
platoon theory.
Early in the game it appeared
as though the Indians would have
an easy time of it as they coolly
walked into an 8-1 lead. But the
Cougars would not hear of it and
immediately began to close the
gap and push for the lead. They
had it at halftime, 39-29.
Pulled Away
Also using the fast break ef
fectively, the Cougars rolled on
to greater things in the second
trace. Washington State pumped
in 55 per cent of their field shots;
Stanford hit 37 per cent with a

miserable 27 per rent in the sec
ond half. The teams were even
on the backboards, each with 40
pull-offs.

botli high with 14 counters. Vet
eran Jim Ross and sophomore
John Maras led WSC with 21 and
17 points respectively.

Coach Howie Dallmar's Stan
ford Indians have gotten off to a
rocky 0-2 start in 1958 Pacific
Coast Conference basketball play.
The Indians opened with a 67-59
loss to the Idaho Vandals on rFi
day night in Moscow, and then
dropped their second game to the
Washington State Cougars in
Pullman, 64-51, on Saturday.
Neither of the winners had been
figured to make a conference
showing.
Captain Gary Simmons led the
Vandals with 21 points while
sophomore John Arrillaga con
tinued his scoring efforts of late
with a 19 point effort for the los
ing cause. The Idaho fast-break
was too much for the Injuns to
cope with, however.
Vandals Lead
Throughout, the first half the
Vandals managed to maintain a
6- to 11-point lead. At the half the
score read 36-29. * Hard play dom
inated the second half with the
locals pulling to a 40-39 lead on
the strength of Paul Neumann's
three jump shots in a row.
The Vandals pulled away, how
ever, and the best the locals could
do was to tie the game at 41-41.
From this point on they drifted.
All night the Indians had trouble
getting under the basket to shoot;
and Arrillaga's compensation by
hitting the long shots was not
enough.
