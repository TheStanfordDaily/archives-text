# Northwest Stays on SU Grid Slate
## 
### 
Stanford is still in the Pacific
Coast Conference, but how long
rhe Indians will stay there re
mains anyone's guess. One thing
is relatively certain, however
the Cards will play all of the
other present conference mem
bers (except Idahoi in football
through 1961.
This much became apparent
when conference grid slates were
released last week. Stanford was
the only one of the schools to
keep all the others on its sched
ule.
USC, UCLA and California,
which announced in December
thai they plan to withdraw from
the PCC, dropped all the North
west schools with the exception
of Washington as of 1960.
No Surprise
The news of Dec. 13 that the
Bears, Trojans and Bruins would
withdraw from the 42 â€¢ year - old
league came as no surprise to
those who had followed the re
cent turmoil among the nine loop
members.
What did come as a surprise
was Stanford's failure to also
withdraw from the circuit. Uni
versity officials met six days
after the triple withdrawal, but
voted to remain in the PCC pend
ing a further examination of the
group's situation.
President Wallace Sterling
said, "I do not know whether the
conference can survive. Whether
or not the conference survives,
there is unfinished business to be
done, in the doing of which Stan
ford feels an obligation to partici
pate."
Obligations
Among the obligations which
persuaded the Indians to remain,
at least temporarily, Sterling list
ed contracts with the Big Ten
and Rose Bowl Committee, ad
ministration of sports other than
football, selection of officials for
scheduled contests, the exchange
of eligibility information, and dis
position of the conference treas
ury.
Sterling repeated that Stanford
is opposed 1o a liberalized alh
letic code, which the conference
will discuss at its next meeting
in March.
No SI! Support
He noted that at a recent con
ference meeting, there was ac
tion which pointed 1o new finan
cial aid to athletes such provi

sions cannot he supported by
Stanford. He hopes to learn how
these actions will be affected by
the withdrawal notices at the
March meeting of the PCC.
Sterling added that the period

hot wren now and the time the
three schools leave ihe confer
ence will furnish a time for the
testing of new principles and pro
grams.
Hut whether this period would

last for long became a mailer of
doubt when Washington said if
would urge the PCC to dissolve
at the March meeting. The Hus
kies said they will quit the league
if it does not vote to disband.
