"The children of California shall
be our children."
That decision was made in
Rome, March 14, 1884. Leland and
Jane Stanford came a long way,
a very long way, since they set
out together in Albany, N.Y., 31
years before, 107 years ago.
A type of family council had
decided that Leland should have a
professional career, and so at the
age of 17 he left his farm home
to start his law training. At 21 he
returned to Albany and entered
the law offices of Wheaton, Doo
littie & Hadley to serve his three
year apprenticeship.
The adventuresome spirit that
eventually led him to become one
of the leaders of the West took
Stanford to Port Washington,
Wis., to set up his first law prac
tice in 1848.
Law Practice
In but four years he had built
a respectable law practice in the
promising frontier town as well
as becoming identified with poli
tics and civic affairs of the coun
ty. In 1850 he married Jane La
throp, daughter of an Albany mer
chant.
The disastrous Port Washing
ton fire of 1852 destroyed Leland's
office together with his valuable
law library—the best in that part
of the state.
The growth of California might
have been slower if it hadn't been
for that fire. These 9,000 Stanford
acres might have been nothing
but orange groves today.
Already Leland's five brothers
were in California. They had been
urging him to join them; he de
cided to go. Leaving his wife with
her parents in Albany, he started
for the Golden State.
Worth $250,000
His business ventures prosper
ed, and in 1855 he was able to
purchase the Sacramento store of
Stanford Brothers and go into
business for himself. He returned
to Albany for his wife. Five years
later they were worth a full quar
ter of a million dollars.
As in Port Washington, Stan
ford became active in Calfornia
and national politics. He was in
fluential in organizing the Repub
lican party in the state. He was
nominated for state treasurer in
1857 and for governor in 1859.
There was no chance of election
for either office, but the party
was making progress.
In 1860 he stumped the state
for Abraham Lincoln. Republican
electors were chosen by a slim
plurality. After the election the
Stanfords went to Washington,
D.C., for some time while he ad
vised the new administration in
regard to California affairs.
Elected Governor in 1861
Leland Stanford was nominated
a second time for governor in
1861 and this time was elected by
a strong majority of votes—and
with him the entire Republican
ticket.
This was the decisive political
battle which determined whether
California was to stay in the
Union, secede with the South or
form an independent republic.
Under Governor Stanford's tact
ful administration, California did
more than her share toward pre
serving the Union.
It was in the following year,
1862, that the Central Pacific
Railroad made its appearance.
Theodore Dehone Judah, rail
road engineer, first saw the possi
bilities of a railroad not just to
reach to the silver mines of the
Sierras, as he first intended, hut
to cross the great void to the At
lantic Coast.
On July 1, 1862, Judah succeed
ed in getting President Lincoln to
sign the act making the govern
ment sponsor of a railroad to be
built simultaneously from its two
ends—the 100 th meridian and the
Pacific coast.
The needed capital was supplied

by the Big Four — Huntington,
Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker.
Stewart Holbrook describes
them as "the men who could con
geal dreams into reality. They
recognized the value of speciali
zation and lost no time in assign
ing each other the duties to which
each seemed best fitted."
Charles Crocker weighed 250
pounds—mostly muscle developed
over many years as a farm hand,
sawmill laborer and blacksmith.
He had made his money in a Sac
ramento store and a freighting
outfit. He became the Big Four's
construction boss.
Stanford, with his political back
ground, was just the man to han
dle the manipulation of policies
and law and give speeches. He
became president of the Central

Pacific Company. It was Stanford
who assisted in driving in the
"Golden Spike" at Promontory,
Utah, on May 10, 1869, thus unit
ing the East and West.
Mark Hopkins, "a saver of
string, a blower-outer of lamps,"
was put in charge of the books of
the company. His calm, mild man
ner made him peacemaker of the
group also.
Collis Potter Huntington was
the Big Four dynamo. He was
the main financier of the quartet
and spent much of his time in
Washington, D.C., watching out
for the best interests of the Cen
tral Pacific.
As the railroad grew, and final
ly developed into the Southern
Pacific, so grew the fortunes of
the partners.

"The children of California shall
be our children."
That decision was made in
Rome, March 14, 1884. Leland and
Jane Stanford came a long way,
a very long way, since they set
out together in Albany, N.Y., 31
years before, 107 years ago.
A type of family council had
decided that Leland should have a
professional career, and so at the
age of 17 he left his farm home
to start his law training. At 21 he
returned to Albany and entered
the law offices of Wheaton, Doo
littie & Hadley to serve his three
year apprenticeship.
The adventuresome spirit that
eventually led him to become one
of the leaders of the West took
Stanford to Port Washington,
Wis., to set up his first law prac
tice in 1848.
Law Practice
In but four years he had built
a respectable law practice in the
promising frontier town as well
as becoming identified with poli
tics and civic affairs of the coun
ty. In 1850 he married Jane La
throp, daughter of an Albany mer
chant.
The disastrous Port Washing
ton fire of 1852 destroyed Leland's
office together with his valuable
law library—the best in that part
of the state.
The growth of California might
have been slower if it hadn't been
for that fire. These 9,000 Stanford
acres might have been nothing
but orange groves today.
Already Leland's five brothers
were in California. They had been
urging him to join them; he de
cided to go. Leaving his wife with
her parents in Albany, he started
for the Golden State.
Worth $250,000
His business ventures prosper
ed, and in 1855 he was able to
purchase the Sacramento store of
Stanford Brothers and go into
business for himself. He returned
to Albany for his wife. Five years
later they were worth a full quar
ter of a million dollars.
As in Port Washington, Stan
ford became active in Calfornia
and national politics. He was in
fluential in organizing the Repub
lican party in the state. He was
nominated for state treasurer in
1857 and for governor in 1859.
There was no chance of election
for either office, but the party
was making progress.
In 1860 he stumped the state
for Abraham Lincoln. Republican
electors were chosen by a slim
plurality. After the election the
Stanfords went to Washington,
D.C., for some time while he ad
vised the new administration in
regard to California affairs.
Elected Governor in 1861
Leland Stanford was nominated
a second time for governor in
1861 and this time was elected by
a strong majority of votes—and
with him the entire Republican
ticket.
This was the decisive political
battle which determined whether
California was to stay in the
Union, secede with the South or
form an independent republic.
Under Governor Stanford's tact
ful administration, California did
more than her share toward pre
serving the Union.
It was in the following year,
1862, that the Central Pacific
Railroad made its appearance.
Theodore Dehone Judah, rail
road engineer, first saw the possi
bilities of a railroad not just to
reach to the silver mines of the
Sierras, as he first intended, hut
to cross the great void to the At
lantic Coast.
On July 1, 1862, Judah succeed
ed in getting President Lincoln to
sign the act making the govern
ment sponsor of a railroad to be
built simultaneously from its two
ends—the 100 th meridian and the
Pacific coast.

There was no chance of election
for either office, but the party
was making progress.
In 1860 he stumped the state
for Abraham Lincoln. Republican
electors were chosen by a slim
plurality. After the election the
Stanfords went to Washington,
D.C., for some time while he ad
vised the new administration in
regard to California affairs.
Elected Governor in 1861
Leland Stanford was nominated
a second time for governor in
1861 and this time was elected by
a strong majority of votes—and
with him the entire Republican
ticket.
This was the decisive political
battle which determined whether
California was to stay in the
Union, secede with the South or
form an independent republic.
Under Governor Stanford's tact
ful administration, California did
more than her share toward pre
serving the Union.
It was in the following year,
1862, that the Central Pacific
Railroad made its appearance.
Theodore Dehone Judah, rail
road engineer, first saw the possi
bilities of a railroad not just to
reach to the silver mines of the
Sierras, as he first intended, hut
to cross the great void to the At
lantic Coast.
On July 1, 1862, Judah succeed
ed in getting President Lincoln to
sign the act making the govern
ment sponsor of a railroad to be
built simultaneously from its two
ends—the 100 th meridian and the
Pacific coast.
The needed capital was supplied

by the Big Four — Huntington,
Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker.
Stewart Holbrook describes
them as "the men who could con
geal dreams into reality. They
recognized the value of speciali
zation and lost no time in assign
ing each other the duties to which
each seemed best fitted."
Charles Crocker weighed 250
pounds—mostly muscle developed
over many years as a farm hand,
sawmill laborer and blacksmith.
He had made his money in a Sac
ramento store and a freighting
outfit. He became the Big Four's
construction boss.
Stanford, with his political back
ground, was just the man to han
dle the manipulation of policies
and law and give speeches. He
became president of the Central

Pacific Company. It was Stanford
who assisted in driving in the
"Golden Spike" at Promontory,
Utah, on May 10, 1869, thus unit
ing the East and West.
Mark Hopkins, "a saver of
string, a blower-outer of lamps,"
was put in charge of the books of
the company. His calm, mild man
ner made him peacemaker of the
group also.
Collis Potter Huntington was
the Big Four dynamo. He was
the main financier of the quartet
and spent much of his time in
Washington, D.C., watching out
for the best interests of the Cen
tral Pacific.
As the railroad grew, and final
ly developed into the Southern
Pacific, so grew the fortunes of
the partners.

"The children of California shall
be our children."
That decision was made in
Rome, March 14, 1884. Leland and
Jane Stanford came a long way,
a very long way, since they set
out together in Albany, N.Y., 31
years before, 107 years ago.
A type of family council had
decided that Leland should have a
professional career, and so at the
age of 17 he left his farm home
to start his law training. At 21 he
returned to Albany and entered
the law offices of Wheaton, Doo
littie & Hadley to serve his three
year apprenticeship.
The adventuresome spirit that
eventually led him to become one
of the leaders of the West took
Stanford to Port Washington,
Wis., to set up his first law prac
tice in 1848.
Law Practice
In but four years he had built
a respectable law practice in the
promising frontier town as well
as becoming identified with poli
tics and civic affairs of the coun
ty. In 1850 he married Jane La
throp, daughter of an Albany mer
chant.
The disastrous Port Washing
ton fire of 1852 destroyed Leland's
office together with his valuable
law library—the best in that part
of the state.
The growth of California might
have been slower if it hadn't been
for that fire. These 9,000 Stanford
acres might have been nothing
but orange groves today.
Already Leland's five brothers
were in California. They had been
urging him to join them; he de
cided to go. Leaving his wife with
her parents in Albany, he started
for the Golden State.
Worth $250,000
His business ventures prosper
ed, and in 1855 he was able to
purchase the Sacramento store of
Stanford Brothers and go into
business for himself. He returned
to Albany for his wife. Five years
later they were worth a full quar
ter of a million dollars.
As in Port Washington, Stan
ford became active in Calfornia
and national politics. He was in
fluential in organizing the Repub
lican party in the state. He was
nominated for state treasurer in
1857 and for governor in 1859.
