### Barbara Hicks 
(Editor's note: This is (Ik*
first in ai series <>1° three ar
tides presenting tlie right-to
work issue, as it may affect the
1958 California political cam
paign. Today's article gives the
history and an explanation of
the controversy; the second will
give the views of Stanford pro
fessors of business, economics
and political science; and the
third will discuss the possibility
of passage of the bill and sum
marize other aspects of the
issue.

What is the "right-to-work"?
This is a question puzzling
many a Californian with an elec
tion conning up in which this
promises to be a key issue.

The controversy, which was
shifted into (he public eye when
(Senator William F. Knowland an
i nounced his candidacy for the Re
publican nomination for gover
nor of California, has cooled
down somewhat, since (he with
drawal of Governor Goodwin J.
Knight from the gubernatorial
race in order to seek the Repub
lican senatorial nomination.
But the announced Democratic
nomination seeker, Atty. Gen.
Edmund G. Brown, has taken a
stand similar to Knight's in op
posing any right-to-work legisla
tion. 11 Knowland and Brown
win (he nominations of their re
spective parties, the issue is like
ly again to be spotlighted, as
Knowland has said he would sign

I a right-to-work bill if it were fair |
and equitable.
The term "right-to-work" has
i been defined in several ways by I
several groups. Those supporting >
right-to-work legislation define it ,
as meaning the right of employ
ees to choose whether or not they
want to join a union, or the pro
hibition of the union shop.
A discussion of right-to-work
laws involves three terms:
• Union shop — All workers
must join the union, at least to
the extent of paying dues, within
a specified time.
• Closed shop — only union
members may be hired.
• Open shop — Workers are
given the choice of joining or
staying out of the union.

The closed shop has already
been outlawed by the Taft-Hart
ley Act of 1917. The union shop
is permitted by the Taft-Hartley
Act, but is outlawed by right-to
work laws.
Opponents of the right-to-work
laws claim their basic function is
to destroy the unions by under
mining their strength. Others arc
asking if the right to work means
the right to employment at all
times, hence eliminating unem
ployment insurance and placing
the responsibility upon the gov
ernment to find everyone a job
who wants one.
Nineteen states have passed
right-to-work legislation, mostly
Southern states, none of them as
industrialized as California. Four

California counties, mainly agri
cultural areas, have also insti
tuted right-to-work laws.
However, on the statewide
level, in 1944, the California vot
ers defeated an initiative meas
ure to outlaw the union shop by
some half million votes, 1,893,589
to 1,304,418. Since then several
right-to-work bills have been in
troduced in the State Legislature,
but none of them has been ap
proved.
Knight, in his 1954 campaign,
pledged that he would veto a
right-to-work bill should the Leg
islature pass it. The Governor
was backed by the AFL's State
Federation of Labor.
"The union shop is now the law

ji)f tin* land in California," Knight
said in his campaign. He added
I that if California were to get a
right-to-work law "there would
be a tremendous upheaval and a
| tremendous depression."
With Knight out of the picture,
Knowland will have to face
Brown, if both are nominated,
j who takes a stand similar to
Knight's, adding that "no law
embodying such a proposal has
| any realistic chance of passing
j the State Legislature."
Knowland, in coming out in
favor of right-to-work legislation,
said he believes every American
is entitled to seek and retain em
ployment without the "prerequi
sites of holding labor union mem
bership."

many a Californian with an elec
tion conning up in which this
promises to be a key issue.

The controversy, which was
shifted into (he public eye when
(Senator William F. Knowland an
i nounced his candidacy for the Re
publican nomination for gover
nor of California, has cooled
down somewhat, since (he with
drawal of Governor Goodwin J.
Knight from the gubernatorial
race in order to seek the Repub
lican senatorial nomination.
But the announced Democratic
nomination seeker, Atty. Gen.
Edmund G. Brown, has taken a
stand similar to Knight's in op
posing any right-to-work legisla
tion. 11 Knowland and Brown
win (he nominations of their re
spective parties, the issue is like
ly again to be spotlighted, as
Knowland has said he would sign

I a right-to-work bill if it were fair |
and equitable.
The term "right-to-work" has
i been defined in several ways by I
several groups. Those supporting >
right-to-work legislation define it ,
as meaning the right of employ
ees to choose whether or not they
want to join a union, or the pro
hibition of the union shop.
A discussion of right-to-work
laws involves three terms:
• Union shop — All workers
must join the union, at least to
the extent of paying dues, within
a specified time.
• Closed shop — only union
members may be hired.
• Open shop — Workers are
given the choice of joining or
staying out of the union.

The closed shop has already
been outlawed by the Taft-Hart
ley Act of 1917. The union shop
is permitted by the Taft-Hartley
Act, but is outlawed by right-to
work laws.
Opponents of the right-to-work
laws claim their basic function is
to destroy the unions by under
mining their strength. Others arc
asking if the right to work means
the right to employment at all
times, hence eliminating unem
ployment insurance and placing
the responsibility upon the gov
ernment to find everyone a job
who wants one.
Nineteen states have passed
right-to-work legislation, mostly
Southern states, none of them as
industrialized as California. Four

California counties, mainly agri
cultural areas, have also insti
tuted right-to-work laws.
However, on the statewide
level, in 1944, the California vot
ers defeated an initiative meas
ure to outlaw the union shop by
some half million votes, 1,893,589
to 1,304,418. Since then several
right-to-work bills have been in
troduced in the State Legislature,
but none of them has been ap
proved.
Knight, in his 1954 campaign,
pledged that he would veto a
right-to-work bill should the Leg
islature pass it. The Governor
was backed by the AFL's State
Federation of Labor.
"The union shop is now the law

ji)f tin* land in California," Knight
said in his campaign. He added
I that if California were to get a
right-to-work law "there would
be a tremendous upheaval and a
| tremendous depression."
With Knight out of the picture,
Knowland will have to face
Brown, if both are nominated,
j who takes a stand similar to
Knight's, adding that "no law
embodying such a proposal has
| any realistic chance of passing
j the State Legislature."
Knowland, in coming out in
favor of right-to-work legislation,
said he believes every American
is entitled to seek and retain em
ployment without the "prerequi
sites of holding labor union mem
bership."

posing any right-to-work legisla
tion. 11 Knowland and Brown
win (he nominations of their re
spective parties, the issue is like
ly again to be spotlighted, as
Knowland has said he would sign

I a right-to-work bill if it were fair |
and equitable.
The term "right-to-work" has
i been defined in several ways by I
several groups. Those supporting >
right-to-work legislation define it ,
as meaning the right of employ
ees to choose whether or not they
want to join a union, or the pro
hibition of the union shop.
A discussion of right-to-work
laws involves three terms:
• Union shop — All workers
must join the union, at least to
the extent of paying dues, within
a specified time.
• Closed shop — only union
members may be hired.
• Open shop — Workers are
given the choice of joining or
staying out of the union.

The closed shop has already
been outlawed by the Taft-Hart
ley Act of 1917. The union shop
is permitted by the Taft-Hartley
Act, but is outlawed by right-to
work laws.
Opponents of the right-to-work
laws claim their basic function is
to destroy the unions by under
mining their strength. Others arc
asking if the right to work means
the right to employment at all
times, hence eliminating unem
ployment insurance and placing
the responsibility upon the gov
ernment to find everyone a job
who wants one.
Nineteen states have passed
right-to-work legislation, mostly
Southern states, none of them as
industrialized as California. Four

California counties, mainly agri
cultural areas, have also insti
tuted right-to-work laws.
However, on the statewide
level, in 1944, the California vot
ers defeated an initiative meas
ure to outlaw the union shop by
some half million votes, 1,893,589
to 1,304,418. Since then several
right-to-work bills have been in
troduced in the State Legislature,
but none of them has been ap
proved.
Knight, in his 1954 campaign,
pledged that he would veto a
right-to-work bill should the Leg
islature pass it. The Governor
was backed by the AFL's State
Federation of Labor.
"The union shop is now the law

ji)f tin* land in California," Knight
said in his campaign. He added
I that if California were to get a
right-to-work law "there would
be a tremendous upheaval and a
| tremendous depression."
With Knight out of the picture,
Knowland will have to face
Brown, if both are nominated,
j who takes a stand similar to
Knight's, adding that "no law
embodying such a proposal has
| any realistic chance of passing
j the State Legislature."
Knowland, in coming out in
favor of right-to-work legislation,
said he believes every American
is entitled to seek and retain em
ployment without the "prerequi
sites of holding labor union mem
bership."
