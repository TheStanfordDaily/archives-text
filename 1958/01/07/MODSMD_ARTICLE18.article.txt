# Right to Work?
## 
### 
\ s ingenious imi:c:r. of legislation has been
making the rounds of stale legislatures for the
jki-I few years. Known popularly as "right to
work legislation, this group of proposed laws
has achieved much support from business con
cerns and much opposition from organized
labor. Senator know land is advocating "right
lo work*' legislation as the cornerstone of his
campaign for governor of California.
11 is maintained bv backers of right-to-work
laws that every person has the inherent right
lo work where he so chooses. I hey also main
lain that every employer has the inherent right
lo emploN or lo discharge whomsoever he so
chooses. Il is also claimed by them that passage
of lliesc laws will not impair the good that has
been accomplished by organized labor.
\ctnally. if these laws are passed il will mean
that an employee cannot be compelled lo join
the. union thai has a collective bargaining
agreement with the company for which he
works. Whether he joins a union or not is
entirely up to him.
()n the face of it, this seems like a good
idea. W liv should someone be forced to join
an organization he does not waul to join? \\ by
should he have to pay dues to an organization
I fiat did not gel his job for him in the first
place?
i nions are based upon collective security.
Tin \ exist on the principle "All for one and
one for all. without which there could not be
security. Now, one defective girder might not
cause a structure lo collapse, but enough of
I hem will. \ pertinent question at this point
would be. "Does an employee have the right
In exisl in hi* employment outside of the so
eiet\ of employees?'"'
The < i\il War decided that no state may of
ilself secede from the Union. Theoretically, no
nation ma\ exist that works to the detriment
of the I nitcd Nations. No man may claim the
privileges under the Constitution of the United

States unless he be a citizen of this country.
In fact, no man can exist without being a citizen
of some country, except as the result of wars,
territorial changes and similar violent causes.
Man must exist in his society, lie may rise
to a higher society, or sink to a lower one, but
exist in some society he must. When a man is
a tradesman, he must exist in the society of his
fellow tradesmen. He cannot go it alone., Man
is a social animal. He can move vertically on
his own initiative, but he cannot move hori
zontally without disrupting the society, within
which he is living.
Unions have been a far greater force for good
than for evil. Much of the high standard of
living enjoyed by the laboring man must be
attributed to the fact that unions existed to
insure and to protect that standard.
There is little doubt as to the ultimate goal
that advocators of "right to work" laws seek.
That is, the eventual breakdown of American
labor unions. Those who want to see the return
of the labor wars of the past should by all
means support "right to work" laws. 'The labor
ing man who has enjoyed the benefits of col
lective security will not calmly sit back and
watch that very collective security drop from
underneath him.
If it is true that labor unions are too power
ful and are becoming a destructive factor in
the American economy, then by all means we
should provide curbs, lint one does not stop
the destructiveness of a rampaging river by
removing it or separating it into individual
droplets. Instead, one channels it into the right,
course: one builds dams to control the force,
providing at the same time more usefulness in
the form of electrical energy and irrigation
water.
"Kight to work" laws are, in fact, "right to
destroy unions" laws. Let us not be fooled by
tricky labels. Recognize right-to-work laws for
what they are. and act accordingly.
