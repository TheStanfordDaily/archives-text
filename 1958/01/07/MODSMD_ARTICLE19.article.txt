# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Editor, The Daily:
The Quad is engaging in monopolistic prac
tices in conjunction with the company which it
has contracted to take portraits. It would seem
tail for students who have previously had their
pictures in tho Quad to have an option either to
."el a new pose for this year or to use a snap
hoi taken in a former year. Yet this is not the

case. Although a small fee is charged for getting
negatives from the photograph studio's files, the
Quad's policy makes it necessary to have a new
pose at a higher fee. This seems manifestly un
fair, and I should like to recommend reconsider
ation of this policy, since it allows the photo
graph studio to make a .rather high profit at
students' expense. Miehael Haas
