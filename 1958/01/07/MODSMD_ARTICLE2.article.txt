# New Reg Mark Set Yesterday; 7650 Check In
## Final Total Predicted Over 8000 858 Increase Over Last Year; 
### 
A one-day record of 76.30 per
sons checked out registration
books and poured into the Pavil
ion to register yesterday, accord
ing to Registrar Harvey Hall.
The number is an increase of 858
over last year.
Students were lined up about
15 deep at the payment and
checkout stands until 1:30. After
that time registration books were
not issued. By 5 p.m. the Pavilion
was practically deserted and the
litter left by more than 7000 stu
dents was being cleaned up in
preparation for the Reg Dance
last night.
The total was the largest for a
single eight - hour day in Stan
ford's history, according to Hall,
j Moving registration day back to
Monday made the difference, he
said. Last year, when registra
tion was held on Thursday, Jan.
3. about 1000 late registrations
had been picked up by Monday.
Full Classes
"Classes can start on the first
day of instruction this year,"
Hall pointed out, "with the feel
ing that practically all of the stu
dents are there."
A total of 5688 men checked
! out books, an increase of 541
over the first day of last year.
The number of women increased
317, a total of 1002. This places
the ratio of men to women at
2.00.
A final registration figure of
"a little over 8000" is predicted
by Hall. The figure is about 3nu
lower than autumn quarter.
Robert O. Houghton, assistant
comptroller, said 7321 persons
paid their registration fee at the
Pavilion. Hall's figure also in
cludes medical students register
ing in San Francisco, so the num
ber not completing registration
today is small, he said.
Kightcen Cashiers
Eighteen cashiers' w in d o w s
were used, and the number as
signed to various types of pay
ment is balanced to keep an even
flow throughout the flay. Hough
ton said. Lines at the "checks in
exact amount of tuition" win
dows move quickly, about 10 stu
dents every five minutes, he
said, so a long line doesn't mean
a long wait.
At the cash windows, which
also handle checks in excess of
tuition, the lines move more slow
ly. Here it takes about 15 min
utes for 10 persons to move
through.
Although a large number of
checks are taken, the cash re-
I ceipts and payments nearly bal
ance. Houghton said.
For the cashiers, it was a busy
day. Nancy Gardner, a senior
working for the second time, said
she was much more rushed than
last quarter when registration
was spread over two days. Ex
cept for lunch, she said, she was
busy all the time until about 1:45.
After Midnight
More than 30 students worked
until after midnight last night al
phabetizing the nine registration
cards for delivery to offices this
morning.
Students registering late may
pick up books in the Registrar's
Information Office, Room 111-A.
Tuition payments may be made
at the Cashier's Office in Eneina
Hall. A late registration fee of
$2 will ho charged today and to
morrow. Thursday, Friday and
Monday the fine will be $5; there
after. $10.
Books not turned in on the day
I checked out are subject to a $2
I fine, or $10 if kept out over a
week.
