Fifty talented high school sci

will spend a summer of study at i
I Stanford through a $2X,700 Shell

Due to an increase in the Shell
I grant, five more teachers will be
able to participate in the program
this summer. So popular has the
Stanford Shell program become
since its inauguration in 1956 with
30 fellows that thousands of appli
cants have to be turned away, ac
cording to Paul DeHart Hurd, as
sociate professor of education.
