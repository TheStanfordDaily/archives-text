# Indians Heady for WSC, Huskies After Day of Rest
## 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
The "No Workout" sign was i
hung out at Enema Cym yester
day as Howie Dallmar's basket
ball club took the day off follow
ing three strenuous weeks of j
play.
Dallmar, after an extremely |
disappointing weekend in the
Northwest, will today begin his j
drive to get the team ready for
weekend tilts with Washington
State and Washington in Stan
lord Pavilion.
There's little doubt 1 hat the 8
p.m. Friday battle against the
Cougars will be a rugged one for
the inexperienced locals.
Lots of Poise
Jack Friel's WSC squad dis
played lots of poise in their 13-
point win over the Indians Sat
urday in Pullman. It'll probably
lake more than a change of
court scenery to close that gap
lor the Tribe.
Dallmar noted that WSC had
n't looked nearly that good in
any of their previous games, and
so tin 1 big question would be j
whether the Cougars were just i
lucky or actually hitting their j
iruc stride.
The Indians will open with the
same five men who started last
weekend Chris Burford and
Dick llaga at the forwards, Neal
Brockmeyer at center, and John
Arrillaga and newly-elected cap- |
tain Paul Neumann at guards.
Luck of Experience
With Neumann and llaga jun
iors and the other three just j
sophomores, the lack of experi- i
once of the Tribesmen is appar- i
ent. And to top that, the top re
serves, Mike Tipton and Jerry !
Theusen, are also just second
year men.
Though this quintet will start, |
D a 11 m a r apprehensively ob- t
served that most of the time he
has had to shift Haga to center j
and bring in another forward as |
Brockmeyer runs into trouble.
More bad news in the experi- j
ence department came with the
word that senior Gary Van Gal
der is out for at least two more
weeks.
He came out of the Shrine foot-1

ball game with charley horse
trouble, and is on crutches. By
the time two weeks have gone by,
there will hardly be time for Van
Galder to get in shape before the
season is over. He'd been counted
on as at least a steadying factor
for the sometimes-jittery Cards.
Failure to obtain a sponsor for
the planned series of PCC basket
bal ltelecasts has resulted in the
rescheduling of Saturday's Wash
ington State game for 8 p.m.
The contest was first slated for
2 p.m. when it was thought that
it would be seen up and down the
coast. But word came last week
that no one would pick up the
tab, hence the time change.

Haga's shot while Spartans Eddie Diaz (22) and Don Rye (5) and

contest to the visitors, 66-59.

sophomores, the lack of experi- i
once of the Tribesmen is appar- i
ent. And to top that, the top re
serves, Mike Tipton and Jerry !
Theusen, are also just second
year men.
Though this quintet will start, |
D a 11 m a r apprehensively ob- t
served that most of the time he
has had to shift Haga to center j
and bring in another forward as |
Brockmeyer runs into trouble.
More bad news in the experi- j
ence department came with the
word that senior Gary Van Gal
der is out for at least two more
weeks.
He came out of the Shrine foot-1

ball game with charley horse
trouble, and is on crutches. By
the time two weeks have gone by,
there will hardly be time for Van
Galder to get in shape before the
season is over. He'd been counted
on as at least a steadying factor
for the sometimes-jittery Cards.
Failure to obtain a sponsor for
the planned series of PCC basket
bal ltelecasts has resulted in the
rescheduling of Saturday's Wash
ington State game for 8 p.m.
The contest was first slated for
2 p.m. when it was thought that
it would be seen up and down the
coast. But word came last week
that no one would pick up the
tab, hence the time change.


JUMP SHOT —San Jose center Bob Larson tries to block Dick
Haga's shot while Spartans Eddie Diaz (22) and Don Rye (5) and
Stanford's John Arrillaga watch. The Indians dropped the Dec. 14
contest to the visitors, 66-59.
The "No Workout" sign was i
hung out at Enema Cym yester
day as Howie Dallmar's basket
ball club took the day off follow
ing three strenuous weeks of j
play.
Dallmar, after an extremely |
disappointing weekend in the
Northwest, will today begin his j
drive to get the team ready for
weekend tilts with Washington
State and Washington in Stan
lord Pavilion.
There's little doubt 1 hat the 8
p.m. Friday battle against the
Cougars will be a rugged one for
the inexperienced locals.
Lots of Poise
Jack Friel's WSC squad dis
played lots of poise in their 13-
point win over the Indians Sat
urday in Pullman. It'll probably
lake more than a change of
court scenery to close that gap
lor the Tribe.
Dallmar noted that WSC had
n't looked nearly that good in
any of their previous games, and
so tin 1 big question would be j
whether the Cougars were just i
lucky or actually hitting their j
iruc stride.
The Indians will open with the
same five men who started last
weekend Chris Burford and
Dick llaga at the forwards, Neal
Brockmeyer at center, and John
Arrillaga and newly-elected cap- |
tain Paul Neumann at guards.
Luck of Experience
With Neumann and llaga jun
iors and the other three just j
sophomores, the lack of experi- i
once of the Tribesmen is appar- i
