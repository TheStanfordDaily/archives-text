night stand at the Palace, the
Cards dropped a 67-45 encounter
to the Santa Clara Broncos. Al
though they were in the lead, 20-
19, after 15 minutes of play, the

rest of the game and continually
lost ground to the Broncs.

gave the locals a 25 per cent mark,
while Santa Clara hit almost twice
as much with 27 of 55 for 49 per
cent. Bronco sophomore forward
Frank Sobrero was leading scorer
with 16 points. Neumann led the
locals with five goals and two
gratis tosses for 12 total points.
Haga was second with 10, and Ar
rillaga and Thuesen tied with six
each.

the Indians took to the road, head
ing for Salt Lake City for a Dec.
20 tussle against the University of
Utah Utes, from which they walk
ed away the losers, 65-49.
A well balanced and coordinated
Utah squad of regulars and re
serves dominated the game, with
the Indians never in contention in
the second half.
Utah center Pearl Pollard was
star of the night on the back
boards, with forward Deyle Con
die leading the Utah parade with
11 points. Arrillaga and Doug
Warren each had 11 for Stanford.
Cards Win in Denver
The scene shifted to Denver and
to the Indians' favor the next
night with a 77-70 win over the
University of Denver. Arrillaga
again was high-pointer with 20

counts. The Indians trailed by 10

in the closing minutes and were
beaten in the last minute by the
University of Colorado and four
straight free throws, 61-58.
A close game all the way found
the Buffaloes leading, 29-25, at
half time. Early in the second
stanza the Dallmar men pulled
into a sizable lead which they
couldn't keep under the strain of
a Colorado full court press.
Guard Gerry Schroeder, whose
four free throws decided the
game, matched teammate John
Musiano for 16 points and game
honor's. Neumann was tops for

tle in the second half to draw
within 2 points of the Cards going
