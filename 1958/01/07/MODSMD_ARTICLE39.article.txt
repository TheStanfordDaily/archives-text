## Student Describes Politics In East-West Berlin Conflict 
### Ellen Mauer 
Editor's Note: Ellen Mauer,
currently a senior here in
chemical engineering, went to
Berlin last year on the Berlin
Affiliation Scholarship. This
year the Free University of
Berlin will again offer a full
scholarship. Details and appli
cations may be obtained at the
ASSU office. The deadline is
Jan. 20. Following is the last
article dealing with Miss Mail
er's experiences in Berlin.

Because of its political location
in the middle of the Russian zone
of Germany, Berlin feels every
move made in the sphere of inter
national politics much more in

tensely than almost any other
place in the world.
Shortly after my arrival in
Berlin in the fall of i956, the Hun
garian uprisings broke out. These
uprisings were especially close to
the hearts of Berliners, who
themselves had experienced up
risings in 1953. Their impact was
immediately felt in the intensi
fied controls on the traffic be
tween East and West Berlin and
between East and West Germany.
In front of the city hall of West
Berlin a Hungarian memorial
service attended by thousands
was held. At the close of the ac
tivities, the Freedom Bell, which
had been presented by the people
of the United States to the city
of Berlin several years ago,
pealed.
Complicated Currency
In Berlin there are two types
of currency, West Marks and
East Marks. The rules governing
the exchange of currency are
complicated. In West Berlin free
exchange shops exist, where the
rate of exchange is approximate
ly four East Marks equal one
West Mark. In East Berlin West
Marks are almost unobtainable.
East Marks for West Marks are
obtainable at a rate of one East
Mark for - one West Mark.
An East German earns approx
imately as much in East Marks
as a worker in the West does in
West Marks. In spite of the fact
I hat an East German has to pay
four times as much for items
bought in West Berlin as a West
Berliner does, relative to his
earning capacity, many East Ber
liners come to West Berlin to
purchase items that either are
unobtainable in the East or are
of such a poor quality that they
simply are not worth purchasing
in the East.
Food Rationing
East Germany still has food
rationing, while in the West food
is obtainable in abundance and
rationing ceased several years
ago. In East Berlin it is a com
mon sight to see goods on display
which arc labeled "Sold." The
purchaser is unable to take them
home, because the store cannot
obtain a fresh stock of goods to
replace those sold. Only after the
new stock arrives is the purchas
er actually in possession of his
new goods.
Officially one cannot buy any
thing in East Berlin without an
East Berlin identification card,
which is issued by the East Ger
man government. However, in
the few remaining privately
owned stores, a West Berliner
can purchase items without an
East ID card, as the shopkeepers
do not like the controls imposed
upon their activities. However,
both the storekeeper and the cus
tomers run the risk of being ar
rested when such illegal pur
chases are made.
Illegal Trade
One may ask why East Berlin
ers don't buy items and sell them
to West Berliners. On small items
they wouldn't earn enough to
make doing so worth while.
Large purchases, for example a
camera, are listed on their ID
cards. Once they have a camera
listed 011 their ID card, they can
not purchase another one. Fur
ther. the East Berlin police may
call at their home at any time
without warning to check if they
still have the camera. If the pur
chaser is unable to produce the
camera, he may be sent to jail for
illegal selling of the camera or
some similar charge.
