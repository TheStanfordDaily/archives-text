# Russian Rocket Carrying Man Soars 186 Miles Up
## Man Parachuted Back To Earth, Sources Say; Moscow Officials Silent 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) — Soviet Russia
| has shot a man-carrying rocket
186 miles into the air and the man
parachuted back to earth, reliable
! sourecs said last night.
If true, it may be an even more
dramatic scientific achievement
than the launchings of Sputnik I
and the dog-carrying Sputnik II
I last fall.
But there was no official an
nouncement whatever concern
ing this venture. It was reported
to have taken place a day or two
after New Year's.
The official silence—in view of
the rumors sweeping Moscow—
led to some speculation that all
did not go as it should, that the
| manned rocket experiment may
j not have been a total success.
West Answers
Western reaction varied. Pro
fessor A. C. B. Lovell, a noted
British scientist, said: "It is just
fantastic. I wonder if it is true."
Another Briton, Dr Olin Eggen,
said the feat — if confirmed -
would be a logical step toward
launching a manned earth satel
j lite.
In Washington Dr. Fred Whip
ple, head of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, ex
pressed no surprise, but declined
comment.
Difficulties, including abrupt
temperature changes, are many.
But the informants' story was
that the Russians fired the man
ned rockel up 300 kilometers
186.41 miles from wintry Soviet
soil through the 70 • below• zero
cold of the stratosphere and well
into the blistering heat of the
ionosphere, a vast ocpati of elec
tricity whose reflecting layers
bounce radio waves back to the
earth.
Parachutist ?
They did not specify whether
Hie parachutist went all the way
tip and how he succeeded in get
ting down.
Months ago, however, Russian
scientists sent up dogs to a lesser
height. The dogs were released
and parachuted lo safety, appar
ently unharmed.
Observers speculated that the
rocket man was released from
the rockel in a pressurized con
tainer equipped so he could sur
vive at great altitudes and break
free of it to jump with his 'chute
at the right stage.
Not a Satellite
This rocket was not in the sat
ellite class. It never came close
to the height necessary to start
circling the earth. Sputnik I, the
184-pound sphere launched Oct.
! 4, reached a maximum altitude
| of 560 miles. Sputnik II, the half
ton rocket that joined it in space
a month later, was reported to
! have gone up to 1056 miles.
In Los Angeles, Dr. John L.
Barnes, president of Systems
Corporation of America, said that
the United States soon will have
a man up higher than that re
ported by the .Russian sources
and in a more sophisticated ve
hicle.
