# 'New Matters' To Be Studied
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”New era mat
ters from missiles to tranquiliz
ers will be the target of congres
sional inquiries this year.
But more ordinary questions
like taxes and the cost of a home
mortgage aren't going to be over
looked either.
A survey of House and Senate
committees yesterdays h owe <1
dozens of investigations are
planned for the new session of
Congress which opened yester
day.
Some of the inquiries may
never come about. But others
are sure to take their place as cir
cumstances demand. The force
of politics, seldom absent, will
become more pronounced as the
legislators get closer to the No
vember elections.
