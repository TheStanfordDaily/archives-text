# $1,370,000 MORE
## Ike Asks Extra funds For Missile Program 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —Plans to channel an extra $1,370,000,000 into
missiles and air defenses, starting immediately, were presented to
Congress yesterday by President Eisenhower.
The chief executive asked for $1,260,000,000 in new money. About
$119 million of it is to be spent before June 30. pushing defense ex-

penditures into the neighborhood
of $38,900,000,000 for this fiscal
year.
Eisenhower also asked Con
gress to approve the transfer of
$110 million, in Defense Depart
ment funds already appropriated,
to the missile and related pro
grams as an additional shot-in
the-arm.
He proposed to use $10 million
of transfer funds to start the
Wheels turning in the govern
ment's newly created Space
Agency, which will deal with sat
ellites, anti-missile missiles and
space vehicles.
All these emergency measures
went in the direction of meeting
Congressional criticism of the
way in which the administration
has responded to Russia's space
age challenge. They were pre
sented a few hours after Con
gress convened for its new ses
sion.
National security in the missile
age was the principal subject dis
cussed when the Senate's Demo
crats and Republicans caucused
separately during the day.
Addressing th c Democratic
senators, Majority Leader Lyn
don B. Johnson of Texas said.
"The peril of the hour is obvi
ous."
"There is something more im
portant than any ultimate weap
on," he declared. "That is the
ultimate position the position of
total control over earth that lies
somewhere out in space.
"Whoever gains that ultimate
position gains . . . total control
over the earth, for the purposes
of tyranny or the service of free
dom . . ."
