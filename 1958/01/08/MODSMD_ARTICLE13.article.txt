# Stanford Scientists Announce Important Nuclear Discovery
## 
### 
A discovery of "immense im
portance" concerning one of the
small particles which make up
the heart of many atoms was re
vealed by a team of Stanford re
searchers at a Conference on
Nuclear Sizes held on campus
Dec. 17-19.
The new information may lead
to important changes in current
nuclear theory.
Working under physics profes
sor Robert Hofstadter, the scien
tists used the Stanford linear ac
celerator to find that the tiny
neutron, which has up to now
been thought only a "point," is
considerably larger.
The announcement of the dis
covery came at a conference at
tended by approximately 250
leading physicists from the Unit
ed States and abroad.
The Stanford scientists' re
search shows that in one charac
teristic at least, the neutron is as
big as one of the largest par
ticles, the proton.
They measured the so-called
"magnetic cloud" about the neu
tron, using a beam of electrons

aimed at deuterons (made up of
one proton and one neutron). The
neutron is electrically neutral,
while Ihe proton has a positive
charge.
Up to now scientists thought
Ihe neutron had no magnetic
field or size because it has no
charge. Magnetically it was con
sidered only a point too small to
measure. Why it has a magnetic
shape without the charge is still
to be explained.
Dr. I. I. Rabi of Columbia Uni
versity, a Nobel Prize winner in
physics who attended the confer
ence, called the Stanford work
"of immense importance."
Rabi suggested that the re
search may lead to an under
standing of what holds the nu
cleus together, which is one of
the key mysteries of modern
physics.
According to present nuclear
theory, the forces of attraction
between the particles in the nu
cleus are so great they should
demolish the particles when they
come together. Scientists still
need to find out how the particles

survive when I hey come together.
The researchers estimate the
average radius of the magnetic
cloud of a nucleus is about 10
thousand billionths of an inch, or
approximately the same as that
of a proton. The shape is also
simliar to a proton's.
The figure was obtained by
analyzing the light given off by
electrons entering a special
chamber (Cerenkov counter) af
ter striking the neutrons.
The cloud is not evenly spread
out but is denser in the middle.
Hofstadter said that at present
ho cannot tell the nature of the
material which makes up the
mass at the center of the particle.
However. Rabi said that now
at least the neutron and other
particles appear to resemble the
spiral nebulas in outer space,
dense in the center and thinning
out near the edges.
Working with Hofstadter were
Bernard R. Chambers and Franz
Bumiller of Stanford's Hansen
Laboratories, Mason Yearian, a
graduate student, and R. W. Mc-
Allister.

The researchers estimate the
average radius of the magnetic
cloud of a nucleus is about 10
thousand billionths of an inch, or
approximately the same as that
of a proton. The shape is also
simliar to a proton's.
The figure was obtained by
analyzing the light given off by
electrons entering a special
chamber (Cerenkov counter) af
ter striking the neutrons.
The cloud is not evenly spread
out but is denser in the middle.
Hofstadter said that at present
ho cannot tell the nature of the
material which makes up the
mass at the center of the particle.
However. Rabi said that now
at least the neutron and other
particles appear to resemble the
spiral nebulas in outer space,
dense in the center and thinning
out near the edges.
Working with Hofstadter were
Bernard R. Chambers and Franz
Bumiller of Stanford's Hansen
Laboratories, Mason Yearian, a
graduate student, and R. W. Mc-
Allister.
A discovery of "immense im
portance" concerning one of the
small particles which make up
the heart of many atoms was re
vealed by a team of Stanford re
searchers at a Conference on
Nuclear Sizes held on campus
Dec. 17-19.
The new information may lead
to important changes in current
nuclear theory.
Working under physics profes
sor Robert Hofstadter, the scien
tists used the Stanford linear ac
celerator to find that the tiny
neutron, which has up to now
been thought only a "point," is
considerably larger.
The announcement of the dis
covery came at a conference at
tended by approximately 250
leading physicists from the Unit
ed States and abroad.
The Stanford scientists' re
search shows that in one charac
teristic at least, the neutron is as
big as one of the largest par
ticles, the proton.
They measured the so-called
"magnetic cloud" about the neu
tron, using a beam of electrons

aimed at deuterons (made up of
one proton and one neutron). The
neutron is electrically neutral,
while Ihe proton has a positive
charge.
Up to now scientists thought
Ihe neutron had no magnetic
field or size because it has no
charge. Magnetically it was con
sidered only a point too small to
measure. Why it has a magnetic
shape without the charge is still
to be explained.
Dr. I. I. Rabi of Columbia Uni
versity, a Nobel Prize winner in
physics who attended the confer
ence, called the Stanford work
"of immense importance."
Rabi suggested that the re
search may lead to an under
standing of what holds the nu
cleus together, which is one of
the key mysteries of modern
physics.
According to present nuclear
theory, the forces of attraction
between the particles in the nu
cleus are so great they should
demolish the particles when they
come together. Scientists still
need to find out how the particles

survive when I hey come together.
