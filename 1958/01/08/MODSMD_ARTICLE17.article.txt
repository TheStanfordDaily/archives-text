# "Challenge of Sputnik" Topic Of Tuesday Series Discussion
## 'No Longer Sure U.S. Is Superior In Science,' Says Dean Terman 
### Steve Freidberg 
A reappraisal of the United States was the object of the first
winter quarter Tuesday Evening Series last night. A panel composed
of three Stanford scientists discussed "The Challenge of Sputnik"
and how the recent Russian scientific coups affect the United States.
The panel was composed of Ronald N. Bracewcll, associate pro
fessor of electrical engineering; Wolfgang K. H. Panovsky, professor
of physics; and Nicholas J. Hoff, professor of aeronautical engineer-

ing. Frederick E. Terman, Uni
versity provost and dean of the
School of Engineering, led the
discussion.
"Wo are no longer sure the
United States is superior in sci
ence," dean Terman said. "It is
necessary that we lake another
look at ourselves and see exactly
where we stand."
Professor Panofsky, who had
spent some time in Russia, told
of the Russian position in science.
He said that the belief the Rus
sians have only recently done
work in this field is false.
Something to Show
"Russia has had much produc
tion in several areas for a long
time, particularly mathematics,
theoretical physics and applied
mechanics," he related. "However,
they don't make their work
known until they have something
to show."
The United States must worry
about its long-range scientific pro
gram and not overconcentrate on
short-range projects, he warned.
"We are doing well right now in
basic science, but we must keep
up in this."
Professor Bracewell explained
briefly why Sputnik stays up and
told what must be done to get
it up and what problems arise.
He also described some of the sci
entific knowledge which is being
obtained from the man-made sat
ellite.
First lonosphere Transmitter
"The action of Sputnik shows
there is five times more air at
that height than was formerly be
lieved. Also, this was the first
time a controlled transmitter had
been above the ionosphere, and
the information gained from it
can be used in improving radio
communication. In addition, radi
ation from the sun could be ob
served more closely than before."
The military and political ef
fects of the satellite were revealed
by professor Hoff. He indicated
that the damage to American pres
tige did not come from the firing
of Sputnik but from the conclu
sions drawn by people of other
countries about this country's po
sition in the missile race. When
they saw the satellite circling the
earth, they assumed Russia was
ahead of the U.S. and believed the
Russian claims as to the success
ful firing of an intercontinental
ballistics missile, he said.
Somewhat Behind Russia
"In my mind, we are somewhat
behind Russia," he commented.
"This Jag is not caused by an ab
sence of knowledge, but is a re
sult of a difference in effort and
a lack of understanding among
management, scientists and engi
neers. When this situation is clear
ed up, the U.S. will make progress
much faster."
All three men agreed that the
United States is capable of keep
ing up with Russia in this race
and that this country has the sci
entific knowledge needed. The
greatest needs, they concurred in,
are the coordination of efforts
and closer cooperation among
those working on missiles.
