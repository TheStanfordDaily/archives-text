It AI'PF.ARS I lie Russians have done il again.
Man lias pierced the stratosphere (though Mos
cow officially (lenits it ), and the man who did it
was wearing the uniform of the Hammer and
Sickle instead of the Stars and Stripes.
All this doesn't prove much except that an
other hole in the armor of American vanity has
hern made. Ivan has scored another first.
We remember the times past when Russians
claimed (and most falsely) to he the discov
erers or the inventors of practically everything.
\\ e Americans were quick to interpret this to
mean that the Russians would probably never
accomplish a '"first" in any thing. \\ e were
shocked: not only shocked, but dismayed.
I toes this mean Russian science and tech
nology have overtaken American, and threaten
to leave our technology in the wake of her
own? Certainly not!
Not unless we re prepared to acknowledge
thai the atmosphere surrounding Russian scien
tific research is more conducive to rapid prog
ress than the atmosphere surrounding our own
research. And, of course, no true American
would dream of such an admission.
Why don't we gel off our high horses and
face facts! We are tired of the American su
periority complex — the "Tni an American:
c/'ir<>. I'm better than yon" attitude that galls
so many of our allies.
(!erlairily we are richer as a nation than other
peoples hut superior? \\ e are no more su
perior to others than one grain of sand is to
another. Unless, of course, we are determined
to commit the fallacy of correlating material
wealth with superiority.
\\ hat has happened to the inventive genius
of the American people? Has it all been chan

neled into just production know-how? Is this
why Russia appears to have overtaken 'lie
United States?
\\ e cannot believe this. \\ e refuse to believe
this. If il he true that America has lost her
leadership in the field of invention and dis
covery of new and better things to benefit man
kind—-and leadership has nothing to do with
superiority —then the fault must lie in the
refusal by Americans to sacrifice to the re
sponsibilities that go with leadership.
These responsibilities demand a continual
awareness of that leadership and a continual
striving to maintain it. Foremost among the
methods of maintaining leadership is increas
ing knowledge and education. That we are
where we are todav can be attributed to the
superiority of the American system of educa
tion as a whole in comparison with other edu
cational systems.
Having attained this superior system of edu
cation, we, unfortunately, seem to have stopped
there and let others pass us by. We are allow
ing our leadership to slip awav from us by
being noncommittal toward education. And we
are doing this mainly because improvement of
(»ur educational system might hurl our pocket
books, our misconceived notions of states' rights
and our prejudices.
Let us stop resting upon our past laurels and
past greatness. Instead, let us continually strive
to reach greater heights in accomplishments.
And let us, by all means, regain what leader
ship we have lost by looking to our educational
system and improving it where it can and must
be improved.
A leader must be wise, and the surest road
to wisdom is through knowledge.
