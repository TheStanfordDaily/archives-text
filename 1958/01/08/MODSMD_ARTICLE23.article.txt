Misrepresentative Editorial
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's denunciation of the "right-to
work" movement The Daily took the liberty of
engaging in a series of misrepresentations which
seem entirely inappropriate in a newspaper
pledged to the fair presentation of whichever
side of a controversial issue it may support.
The editorial made a dangerous comparison
of a state's secession from the Union, a nation's
membership in the United Nations, and U.S. citi
zenship to a worker's relationship with labor
unions. The point which the editor attempts to
prove by this parallel is that an individual work
er does not have the right to exist outside of the
"society of employees."
This comparison which the Daily editor has
drawn between government and labor unions at
tributes the coercive powers of a government to
labor unions, which are private organizations. In
attempting to prove that labor unions should
have such coercive powers the editor has not
named one other private organization in the
United States which has such powers. I do not
believe that he can name one, aside from perhaps
the American Bar Association, which is author
ized by the government for licensing purposes.
The editor states that tradesmen exist as a
part of the society of their fellow workers and
"cannot go it alone." This is a very old argu
ment and has been often used by dictators in
defense of the total supremacy of the state over
the individual and his rights. In California it is
all but impossible for a truck driver to earn a
living without joining the Teamsters' Union. If
he happens to be opposed to corruption it makes
no difference, lie is forced either to violate his
freedom of conscience and support corruption
or to change his occupation.

It is not enough to say that government regu
lations, or "curbs" as the Daily editor puts it,
can by themselves solve this problem. The only
real solution is to directly attack the cause and
legislate against the system—the union shop
which forces the worker to support a private or
ganization with whose policies he may not agree.
If a worker is opposed to corruption or violence,
or if because of his religious convictions he can
not join a union, he should not be forced to do so.
The editor charges that proponents of right
to-work legislation are out to destroy labor un
ions and that under such laws the worker will
watch "collective security drop from underneath
him." I do not believe that the editor can pro
duce any evidence to support this impetuous as
sertion. The fact of the matter is that unions,
such as the railroad unions, which have in the
past operated without the union shop have been
among the most highly organized and successful
unions in the country. In the states which have
adopted right-to-work laws the unions have been
more effective in obtaining higher wages and
shorter hours since the adoption of these laws
than have unions in states which allow the
union shop.
The editor claims that the passage of right-to
work laws will mean the return of the "labor
wars of the past." Yet, according to the Depart
ment of Labor, labor strife has decreased signifi
cantly in right-to-work states since the passage
of the laws. Labor strife remains much greater
in states which do not have such laws. The rea
son for this occurrence is that one of the princi
pal causes of labor strife, the union shop itself,
has been abolished.
It cannot be denied that ihcre exist sound ar
guments against right-to-work laws; however, T
believe the Daily editor has allowed his enthu
siasm to obscure a fair presentation of them.

the American Bar Association, which is author
ized by the government for licensing purposes.
The editor states that tradesmen exist as a
part of the society of their fellow workers and
"cannot go it alone." This is a very old argu
ment and has been often used by dictators in
defense of the total supremacy of the state over
the individual and his rights. In California it is
all but impossible for a truck driver to earn a
living without joining the Teamsters' Union. If
he happens to be opposed to corruption it makes
no difference, lie is forced either to violate his
freedom of conscience and support corruption
or to change his occupation.

It is not enough to say that government regu
lations, or "curbs" as the Daily editor puts it,
can by themselves solve this problem. The only
real solution is to directly attack the cause and
legislate against the system—the union shop
which forces the worker to support a private or
ganization with whose policies he may not agree.
If a worker is opposed to corruption or violence,
or if because of his religious convictions he can
not join a union, he should not be forced to do so.
The editor charges that proponents of right
to-work legislation are out to destroy labor un
ions and that under such laws the worker will
watch "collective security drop from underneath
him." I do not believe that the editor can pro
duce any evidence to support this impetuous as
sertion. The fact of the matter is that unions,
such as the railroad unions, which have in the
past operated without the union shop have been
among the most highly organized and successful
unions in the country. In the states which have
adopted right-to-work laws the unions have been
more effective in obtaining higher wages and
shorter hours since the adoption of these laws
than have unions in states which allow the
union shop.
The editor claims that the passage of right-to
work laws will mean the return of the "labor
wars of the past." Yet, according to the Depart
ment of Labor, labor strife has decreased signifi
cantly in right-to-work states since the passage
of the laws. Labor strife remains much greater
in states which do not have such laws. The rea
son for this occurrence is that one of the princi
pal causes of labor strife, the union shop itself,
has been abolished.
It cannot be denied that ihcre exist sound ar
guments against right-to-work laws; however, T
believe the Daily editor has allowed his enthu
siasm to obscure a fair presentation of them.

Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's denunciation of the "right-to
work" movement The Daily took the liberty of
engaging in a series of misrepresentations which
seem entirely inappropriate in a newspaper
pledged to the fair presentation of whichever
side of a controversial issue it may support.
The editorial made a dangerous comparison
of a state's secession from the Union, a nation's
membership in the United Nations, and U.S. citi
zenship to a worker's relationship with labor
unions. The point which the editor attempts to
prove by this parallel is that an individual work
er does not have the right to exist outside of the
"society of employees."
This comparison which the Daily editor has
drawn between government and labor unions at
tributes the coercive powers of a government to
labor unions, which are private organizations. In
attempting to prove that labor unions should
have such coercive powers the editor has not
named one other private organization in the
United States which has such powers. I do not
believe that he can name one, aside from perhaps
the American Bar Association, which is author
