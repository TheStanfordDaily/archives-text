The pros and cons of the pro
posed right •to - work legislation
are many, and a sampling of
Stanford business, economic. l and
political science professors were
questioned as to the conse
quences of such a law.
That right-to-work laws would
have little effect in California
was the most common view ex
pressed by the professors can
vassed.
Professors Hubert R. Marshall
(political science), John P. Trox
ell (industrial management),
Marvin E. Ro/en and Ronald Hil
ton (economics) generally agreed
that the passage of a right-to
work law in California would not
hurt the strong, well-organized
unions.
As Professor Marshall pointed
out, "Industrial management re
alizes that the union is on its
side and uses the union to avoid
wildcat strikes and to provide an
instrument of collective bargain
ing."
There is more responsible labor
union leadership if it c-.-.n be sure
it has the support of all the work
ers. The union can play its role
best where it does not have to
worry about undercurrents of
unrest caused by non-union mem
bers "in an open shop situation."
Professor Ro/. en concurred,
adding that employers want good
relations with their employees,
and if it takes the union to form
these relations, they will put up
with it and, in fact, welcome it.
"The marginal effect of a right
to - work law would be small,"
saifl Professor Hilton. "Those
unions which are already strong
may lose a few members, but in
general will retain (heir strength.
Such unions as the locomotive en
gineers. for instance, will remain
solid in order to retain their iden
tity as a highly skilled group."
Troxell agreed with Hilton's
view on the already strong un
ions, but added that the small
union might be hurt. However,
he noted in many of these areas,
the union has little chance of lie
coming strong anyway.
The industrial management

professor explained that the ru
ral associations mainly favor the
right-to-work laws, while the city
groups do not, and he pointed to
those states passing the laws as
mainly agricultural areas.
Professor Cornelius P. Cotter
(political sciencei, however, felt
the proposed legislation would
have a definite impact on the
California economic situation.
Disagreeing with hi s col
leagues, he said, "Though it may
be claimed the strong unions
won't he hurt much, as long as
they may be hurt at all they will
fight such legislation. The possi
bility of strikes and turmoil re
sulting from the passage of a
right-to-work bill is very real and
could have a disastrous result on
the economic outlook for the
state."
