# THERE'S AN ENGINEER'S WORLD at WESTERN ELECTRIC
## 
### 
As the world's largest manufacturer
-/jl. of communications equipment our
continued progress depends greatly on
our engineers. They have a key role in
the production of some 50,000 types of
apparatus and component parts that
Western Electric makes in a given year.
<§> To our engineers falls the monu
mental task of developing manufactur
ing operations and of planning the
installation of telephone central office
equipment across the nation. They de
vise the new machines, tools and meth
ods needed to do our job. They also
shoulder the major responsibilities in
carrying out the defense contracts the
government has asked us to take over
major projects like the Nike guided mis
sile system and the Distant Early Warn
ing (DEW) Line.
© In the course of their technical work,
engineers participate in such broad
managerial functions as production,
merchandising, installation, and many
others. What's more, we have a record
of promotions from within. It's not sur
prising, therefore, that fifty-five percent
ol the college graduates in our upper
levels of management have engineering
degrees.
© Naturally we do everything possible
to encourage and speed the professional
development of our engineers. Just re
cently, for example, we inaugurated a
lull-time off-the-job Graduate Engineer
ing Training Program at special train
ing centers, a program with few paral
lels in American industry.
0 The new engineer moves into the
first phase of this program, Introduc
tion to Western Electric Engineering,
four to six months after he joins us and
devotes nine weeks of study to such
technical subjects as communications
systems, military electronic systems,
product design principles. He takes part
in the second phase, General Develop
ment, after the first year on the job. In
this phase he devotes nine weeks to
courses in human relations, semantics,
engineering statistics, electronics, meas
urements and instrumentation, systems
circuit analysis. The third phase, Ad
vanced Development (4 weeks per
year), is available to selected engineers
and is geared to the individual to help
develop his creative engineering abili
ties; goes deeply into such subjects as
magnetics, computer applications, elec
tronic switching, radar fundamentals,
feedback control systems and technical
paper writing.
• Besides this company-wide program,
a number of our divisions offer indivi

dual engineering courses in their own
specialties. We also sponsor a Tuition
Refund Plan for out-of-hours study at
nearby colleges. Open to all employees,
this plan helps our engineers study for
advanced degrees at Company expense.
• Truly there's an engineer's world

here at Western Electric . . . one in
which engineers in every field of spe
cialization can expect to grow.
