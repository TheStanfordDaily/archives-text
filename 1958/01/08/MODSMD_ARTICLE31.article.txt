Hack to llie Wow Hoys
The imminent passing away of the Pacific Coast Conference has
forced many sports sentimentalists into believing Ihat no more great
football will ever be played here on the Coast; that the great eras j
are gone forever. Fai be it from me to say whether or not this will !
be true.
Many of these sentimentalists now often speak of the good old j
days of yore, recounting some of the historic moments of the past.
Although the Conference breakup did not prompt it, a new book has
appeared in the midst of all this thinking. The game-by-game story
ol Stanford's historic 1910 football season is called "The Wow Boys."
The book, released by Exposition Press and available in the Book- '
store, was written by Cyclone Covey, a history grad from Stanford
and reportedly "a long-time fixture" here on The Daily. Covey,
reports Don IJehendorfer, is one of Stanford's most enthusiastic fans.
The 1940 Wow Hoys amazed him, as they did most everyone else.
From personal accounts, movies, newspaper reports and many
other sources, Covey has compiled an exciting history of that season, j
His book is more than a history, though; it is a literary movie, filled |

with all the action and excitement
surrounding a team the nation
will never forget.
It is also a thorough analysis of i
the team, each game, the then-new
T formation, former coach Clark
Shauffhnessy's personality an d
methods, and the Coast football
picture in '40.
"The Wow Boys" contains com- t
mentary, photos and diagrams
which are mainly on the technical
plane. It is not the type of book i
I'd advise the girls to read it j
they're looking for a football ro
mance.
But it is the type of book that
anyone, male or female, who is
interested in Stanford football his
tory, or football history in gen- ,
era!, should take a look at. It is !
thoroughly enjoyable, from play
to play, game to game, and cover
to cover. »
As a refresher, to those of you
who don't know much about the
Wow Boys, here are a few facts:

This was the team that introduced the modern T into college ball; the
team coached by Shaughnessy, with stars Chuck Taylor, Frank ie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Standlee, to name
just the most prominent, in the lineup. This was also the team that
was picked to go nowhere, but which swept through a pertect season
and into the Rose Bowl and out, without a blemish. And it's all in
this book.
Stanford on Television
The Christmas-New Year's vacation was the time for Stanford
sports personalities to make appearances on national and local tele
vision. Managed to catch Al Harrington on CBS's "To Tell the Truth."
Al picked up some handsome cash for not looking like himself and
put on some great entertainment with his sword dance specialty.
Just about a week after his first appearance, Al showed up on
screens again -this time on Art Baker's "You Asked for It" program
again doing the dance which has gained him acclaim.
My boss and Daily sports editor, Dick Barnes (who will like being
called a Stanford sports personality), was a guest on a West Coast
TV show known as "7(5 Sports Club." Theme of the show was "Physi
cal Fitness," and people spent the half hour doing sit-ups and push
ups. I thought for a minute he was going to lift a typewriter up and
down, but actually he was there to do the usual good job of inter
viewing this time Dick Daugherty of the L.A. Rams.
Seems that athletic director Al Masters has told the five coaching
assistants that the job of head coach will not go to any of them.
Walt Gainage reports in the Palo Alto Times that the quintet took off
for the Philadelphia coaches' conference to look for new posts, with
the University footing the bill. 'Tis too bad, in a way, that we may
not have their services next year they are capable men.
No new rumors on the situation, but it looks like ole Cactus Jack
Curtice of Utah will remain the top choice of the current list. Jack
is reportedly wavering between the lucrative Texas A&M olfer and
one from The Farm —and probably from a few other places too. The
philosopher-coach sure made a name for himself with his West team
in the December Shrine tilt . . . and with a Stanford-type atmos
phere, too.
Southland sentiment seems to favor Curtice for the job here.
A headline in the L.A. Times after the Shrine game built him up
well: "Curtice Molds Unknowns; Directs to Triumph." Somebody
down there reported that Stanford should hire him right away and
get a package deal with quarterback Jackie Douglas as one of his
assistants. It's worth thinking about —but not for too long.
While it isn't customary for sports writers to give out "orchids,"
maybe we should devise a blanket of roses or something and throw it
over both Douglas and Don Manoukian for performances of late.
Manouk pulled in the Spalding Trophy in the Shrine game as the out
standing lineman. Douglas did well in that fracas and was yesterday
named to the Ail-American tennis squad.
Speaking of the Wow Boys (above), UCLA coach Red Sanders, on
a television program in Los Angeles with sportscaster Tom Harmon,
credited the performance of Stanford's 1940 team and the ones 10
follow as the reason that many college squads in the country have
not shifted from the T.
Got to credit the 49ers for going as far as they did this year, but
I couldn't understand why so many people were disappointed when
they lost the championship . . . especially if any of these people are
also Stanford fans.
Just a note: Broadcasts of Stanford's varsity games are available
on both KCBS and our own KZSU, but the local station is the only
one with a full play-by-play of all freshman games. They figure it's
good policy to follow the varsity stars of tomorrow in action today.
Game time for the frosh on KZSU is .1:55 for the 6 p.m. starts, or five
minutes before any other start.

thoroughly enjoyable, from play

to cover. »
As a refresher, to those of you
who don't know much about the
Wow Boys, here are a few facts:

This was the team that introduced the modern T into college ball; the
team coached by Shaughnessy, with stars Chuck Taylor, Frank ie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Standlee, to name
just the most prominent, in the lineup. This was also the team that
was picked to go nowhere, but which swept through a pertect season
and into the Rose Bowl and out, without a blemish. And it's all in
this book.
Stanford on Television
The Christmas-New Year's vacation was the time for Stanford
sports personalities to make appearances on national and local tele
vision. Managed to catch Al Harrington on CBS's "To Tell the Truth."
Al picked up some handsome cash for not looking like himself and
put on some great entertainment with his sword dance specialty.
Just about a week after his first appearance, Al showed up on
screens again -this time on Art Baker's "You Asked for It" program
again doing the dance which has gained him acclaim.
My boss and Daily sports editor, Dick Barnes (who will like being
called a Stanford sports personality), was a guest on a West Coast
TV show known as "7(5 Sports Club." Theme of the show was "Physi
cal Fitness," and people spent the half hour doing sit-ups and push
ups. I thought for a minute he was going to lift a typewriter up and
down, but actually he was there to do the usual good job of inter
viewing this time Dick Daugherty of the L.A. Rams.
Seems that athletic director Al Masters has told the five coaching
assistants that the job of head coach will not go to any of them.
Walt Gainage reports in the Palo Alto Times that the quintet took off
for the Philadelphia coaches' conference to look for new posts, with
the University footing the bill. 'Tis too bad, in a way, that we may
not have their services next year they are capable men.
No new rumors on the situation, but it looks like ole Cactus Jack
Curtice of Utah will remain the top choice of the current list. Jack
is reportedly wavering between the lucrative Texas A&M olfer and
one from The Farm —and probably from a few other places too. The
philosopher-coach sure made a name for himself with his West team
in the December Shrine tilt . . . and with a Stanford-type atmos
phere, too.
Southland sentiment seems to favor Curtice for the job here.
A headline in the L.A. Times after the Shrine game built him up
well: "Curtice Molds Unknowns; Directs to Triumph." Somebody
down there reported that Stanford should hire him right away and
get a package deal with quarterback Jackie Douglas as one of his
assistants. It's worth thinking about —but not for too long.
While it isn't customary for sports writers to give out "orchids,"
maybe we should devise a blanket of roses or something and throw it
over both Douglas and Don Manoukian for performances of late.
Manouk pulled in the Spalding Trophy in the Shrine game as the out
standing lineman. Douglas did well in that fracas and was yesterday
named to the Ail-American tennis squad.
Speaking of the Wow Boys (above), UCLA coach Red Sanders, on
a television program in Los Angeles with sportscaster Tom Harmon,
credited the performance of Stanford's 1940 team and the ones 10
follow as the reason that many college squads in the country have
not shifted from the T.
Got to credit the 49ers for going as far as they did this year, but
I couldn't understand why so many people were disappointed when
they lost the championship . . . especially if any of these people are
also Stanford fans.
Just a note: Broadcasts of Stanford's varsity games are available
on both KCBS and our own KZSU, but the local station is the only
one with a full play-by-play of all freshman games. They figure it's
good policy to follow the varsity stars of tomorrow in action today.
Game time for the frosh on KZSU is .1:55 for the 6 p.m. starts, or five
minutes before any other start.

Hack to llie Wow Hoys
The imminent passing away of the Pacific Coast Conference has
forced many sports sentimentalists into believing Ihat no more great
football will ever be played here on the Coast; that the great eras j
are gone forever. Fai be it from me to say whether or not this will !
be true.
Many of these sentimentalists now often speak of the good old j
days of yore, recounting some of the historic moments of the past.
Although the Conference breakup did not prompt it, a new book has
appeared in the midst of all this thinking. The game-by-game story
ol Stanford's historic 1910 football season is called "The Wow Boys."
The book, released by Exposition Press and available in the Book- '
store, was written by Cyclone Covey, a history grad from Stanford
and reportedly "a long-time fixture" here on The Daily. Covey,
reports Don IJehendorfer, is one of Stanford's most enthusiastic fans.
The 1940 Wow Hoys amazed him, as they did most everyone else.
From personal accounts, movies, newspaper reports and many
other sources, Covey has compiled an exciting history of that season, j
His book is more than a history, though; it is a literary movie, filled |

with all the action and excitement
surrounding a team the nation
will never forget.
It is also a thorough analysis of i
the team, each game, the then-new
T formation, former coach Clark
Shauffhnessy's personality an d
methods, and the Coast football
picture in '40.
"The Wow Boys" contains com- t
mentary, photos and diagrams
which are mainly on the technical
plane. It is not the type of book i
I'd advise the girls to read it j
they're looking for a football ro
mance.

maybe we should devise a blanket of roses or something and throw it

Manouk pulled in the Spalding Trophy in the Shrine game as the out

named to the Ail-American tennis squad.
Speaking of the Wow Boys (above), UCLA coach Red Sanders, on

Hack to llie Wow Hoys
The imminent passing away of the Pacific Coast Conference has
forced many sports sentimentalists into believing Ihat no more great
football will ever be played here on the Coast; that the great eras j
are gone forever. Fai be it from me to say whether or not this will !
be true.
Many of these sentimentalists now often speak of the good old j
days of yore, recounting some of the historic moments of the past.
Although the Conference breakup did not prompt it, a new book has
appeared in the midst of all this thinking. The game-by-game story
ol Stanford's historic 1910 football season is called "The Wow Boys."
The book, released by Exposition Press and available in the Book- '
store, was written by Cyclone Covey, a history grad from Stanford
and reportedly "a long-time fixture" here on The Daily. Covey,
reports Don IJehendorfer, is one of Stanford's most enthusiastic fans.
The 1940 Wow Hoys amazed him, as they did most everyone else.
From personal accounts, movies, newspaper reports and many
other sources, Covey has compiled an exciting history of that season, j
His book is more than a history, though; it is a literary movie, filled |

with all the action and excitement
surrounding a team the nation
will never forget.
It is also a thorough analysis of i
the team, each game, the then-new
T formation, former coach Clark
Shauffhnessy's personality an d
methods, and the Coast football
picture in '40.
"The Wow Boys" contains com- t
mentary, photos and diagrams
which are mainly on the technical
plane. It is not the type of book i
I'd advise the girls to read it j
they're looking for a football ro
mance.
But it is the type of book that
anyone, male or female, who is
interested in Stanford football his
tory, or football history in gen- ,
era!, should take a look at. It is !
thoroughly enjoyable, from play
to play, game to game, and cover
to cover. »
As a refresher, to those of you
who don't know much about the
Wow Boys, here are a few facts:

This was the team that introduced the modern T into college ball; the
team coached by Shaughnessy, with stars Chuck Taylor, Frank ie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Standlee, to name
just the most prominent, in the lineup. This was also the team that
was picked to go nowhere, but which swept through a pertect season
and into the Rose Bowl and out, without a blemish. And it's all in
this book.
Stanford on Television
The Christmas-New Year's vacation was the time for Stanford
sports personalities to make appearances on national and local tele
vision. Managed to catch Al Harrington on CBS's "To Tell the Truth."
Al picked up some handsome cash for not looking like himself and
put on some great entertainment with his sword dance specialty.
Just about a week after his first appearance, Al showed up on
screens again -this time on Art Baker's "You Asked for It" program
again doing the dance which has gained him acclaim.
My boss and Daily sports editor, Dick Barnes (who will like being
called a Stanford sports personality), was a guest on a West Coast
TV show known as "7(5 Sports Club." Theme of the show was "Physi
cal Fitness," and people spent the half hour doing sit-ups and push
ups. I thought for a minute he was going to lift a typewriter up and
down, but actually he was there to do the usual good job of inter

Got to credit the 49ers for going as far as they did this year, but
I couldn't understand why so many people were disappointed when
they lost the championship . . . especially if any of these people are
also Stanford fans.
Just a note: Broadcasts of Stanford's varsity games are available
on both KCBS and our own KZSU, but the local station is the only
one with a full play-by-play of all freshman games. They figure it's
good policy to follow the varsity stars of tomorrow in action today.
Game time for the frosh on KZSU is .1:55 for the 6 p.m. starts, or five
minutes before any other start.

Hack to llie Wow Hoys
The imminent passing away of the Pacific Coast Conference has
forced many sports sentimentalists into believing Ihat no more great
football will ever be played here on the Coast; that the great eras j
are gone forever. Fai be it from me to say whether or not this will !
be true.
Many of these sentimentalists now often speak of the good old j
days of yore, recounting some of the historic moments of the past.
Although the Conference breakup did not prompt it, a new book has
appeared in the midst of all this thinking. The game-by-game story
ol Stanford's historic 1910 football season is called "The Wow Boys."
The book, released by Exposition Press and available in the Book- '
store, was written by Cyclone Covey, a history grad from Stanford
and reportedly "a long-time fixture" here on The Daily. Covey,
reports Don IJehendorfer, is one of Stanford's most enthusiastic fans.
The 1940 Wow Hoys amazed him, as they did most everyone else.
From personal accounts, movies, newspaper reports and many
other sources, Covey has compiled an exciting history of that season, j
His book is more than a history, though; it is a literary movie, filled |

with all the action and excitement
surrounding a team the nation
will never forget.
It is also a thorough analysis of i
the team, each game, the then-new
T formation, former coach Clark
Shauffhnessy's personality an d
methods, and the Coast football
picture in '40.
"The Wow Boys" contains com- t
mentary, photos and diagrams
which are mainly on the technical
plane. It is not the type of book i
I'd advise the girls to read it j
they're looking for a football ro
mance.
But it is the type of book that
anyone, male or female, who is
interested in Stanford football his
tory, or football history in gen- ,
era!, should take a look at. It is !
thoroughly enjoyable, from play
to play, game to game, and cover
to cover. »
As a refresher, to those of you
who don't know much about the
Wow Boys, here are a few facts:

This was the team that introduced the modern T into college ball; the
team coached by Shaughnessy, with stars Chuck Taylor, Frank ie
Albert, Pete Kmetovic, Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Standlee, to name
just the most prominent, in the lineup. This was also the team that
was picked to go nowhere, but which swept through a pertect season
and into the Rose Bowl and out, without a blemish. And it's all in
this book.
Stanford on Television
The Christmas-New Year's vacation was the time for Stanford
sports personalities to make appearances on national and local tele
vision. Managed to catch Al Harrington on CBS's "To Tell the Truth."
Al picked up some handsome cash for not looking like himself and
put on some great entertainment with his sword dance specialty.
Just about a week after his first appearance, Al showed up on
screens again -this time on Art Baker's "You Asked for It" program
again doing the dance which has gained him acclaim.
My boss and Daily sports editor, Dick Barnes (who will like being
called a Stanford sports personality), was a guest on a West Coast
TV show known as "7(5 Sports Club." Theme of the show was "Physi
cal Fitness," and people spent the half hour doing sit-ups and push
ups. I thought for a minute he was going to lift a typewriter up and
down, but actually he was there to do the usual good job of inter
viewing this time Dick Daugherty of the L.A. Rams.
Seems that athletic director Al Masters has told the five coaching
assistants that the job of head coach will not go to any of them.
Walt Gainage reports in the Palo Alto Times that the quintet took off
for the Philadelphia coaches' conference to look for new posts, with
the University footing the bill. 'Tis too bad, in a way, that we may
not have their services next year they are capable men.
No new rumors on the situation, but it looks like ole Cactus Jack
Curtice of Utah will remain the top choice of the current list. Jack
is reportedly wavering between the lucrative Texas A&M olfer and
one from The Farm —and probably from a few other places too. The
philosopher-coach sure made a name for himself with his West team
in the December Shrine tilt . . . and with a Stanford-type atmos
phere, too.
Southland sentiment seems to favor Curtice for the job here.
A headline in the L.A. Times after the Shrine game built him up
well: "Curtice Molds Unknowns; Directs to Triumph." Somebody
down there reported that Stanford should hire him right away and
get a package deal with quarterback Jackie Douglas as one of his
assistants. It's worth thinking about —but not for too long.
While it isn't customary for sports writers to give out "orchids,"
maybe we should devise a blanket of roses or something and throw it
over both Douglas and Don Manoukian for performances of late.
Manouk pulled in the Spalding Trophy in the Shrine game as the out
standing lineman. Douglas did well in that fracas and was yesterday
named to the Ail-American tennis squad.
Speaking of the Wow Boys (above), UCLA coach Red Sanders, on
a television program in Los Angeles with sportscaster Tom Harmon,
credited the performance of Stanford's 1940 team and the ones 10
follow as the reason that many college squads in the country have
not shifted from the T.
Got to credit the 49ers for going as far as they did this year, but
I couldn't understand why so many people were disappointed when
they lost the championship . . . especially if any of these people are
also Stanford fans.
Just a note: Broadcasts of Stanford's varsity games are available
on both KCBS and our own KZSU, but the local station is the only
one with a full play-by-play of all freshman games. They figure it's
good policy to follow the varsity stars of tomorrow in action today.
Game time for the frosh on KZSU is .1:55 for the 6 p.m. starts, or five
minutes before any other start.
