# No Room For Loss Saturday
## 
### 
The Washington Husky team
that was supposed to be a prime
threat in the Pacific Coast Con
ference basketball race now finds
itself in the position of having to
beat Stanford Saturday or else
forfeit any illusions they may
have had about taking the title.
The Huskies went to 0-2 in
Coast action Monday night as
they were outpointed by surpris
ing Southern California, 60-54, in
Seattle. Previously, the Washing
ton contingent had been whipped
handily by California.
Washington won't be the only
team in the game that needs a
win to stay alive. Howie Dall
mar's Indians are likewise 0-2,
but they really looked bad in
blowing a pair to Idaho and WSC,
picked as the two worst clubs in
the league.
Smart Comes Through
Although the Huskies have not
looked good in their league open
ers, their top man, Doug Smart,
has been living up to his reputa
tion as possibly the best big man
in the PCC.
He poured another 2(5 points
through the nets Monday night
to raise his season's scoring aver
age to slightly over 20 points.
The Washington problem is 1 hat
Smart is the only man who is
even in the double figures in
scoring.
Top Rehounder
Washington's 0- 7, 230 - pound
junior is not only the top point
maker, but also paces the Husky
squad in accuracy and rebound
ing. He's hit well over 40 per
cent from the floor, and is aver
aging in the neighborhood of 13
rebounds per game.
While his 40 per cent figure is
good by most standards, it does
n't begin to compare with his
1956-57 mark of 55.1 per cent.
Last season, he was also the only
unanimous choice on the all-PCC
team as picked by circuit coaches,
and was also a third-string All-
American.
Boin Missing
Smart's running male of last
season, big Bruno Boin, won't be
in the Husky line-up Saturday or
any other night this season. He
decided to lay out a year and in
stead play next season, when
Washington will again be eligible
for NCAA tournament play.
Tippy Dye's team has some of
the same inexperience problems
as Stanford, though to not as
great a degree. Two sophs, for
wards Al Murphy and Earle Ir
vine, are in the starting combine.
But unlike the Cards, there are
a pair of seniors in the backcourt
to settle the team Bill Stady and
Dick Crews.
