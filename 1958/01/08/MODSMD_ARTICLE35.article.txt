# Latest Difficulty for Walter: Pasadenans Find Legal Barrier

PASADENA (JP) â€” Efforts of
Walter O'Malley's homeless
Dodgers to get the Pasadena
Rose Bowl as a temporary haven
ran head-on yesterday into a new
legal snarl.
Notice of intent to file an ini
tiative measure to prevent the
Rose Bowl being used for private
profit was given by a group of
citizens who want to keep the
Dodgers out. The notice was
served on the Recreation and
Park Board by Lee Paul, an at
torney representing a taxpayers'
group.
Paul said a 1923 contract pro
vides that the stadium may not
! be used by a profit-making or-
I ganization.
O'Malley's assistant, Richard
Walsh, conferred with Pasadena
city officials on legal angles in
volved in the possible use of the
100.000-seat Rose Bowl, while his
engineers continued ses si on s
| with the city engineers on how

the stadium could be converted
into a baseball park.
O'Malley, who once planned to
use the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum until his $10,000,000
stadium in Chavez Ravine was
completed in 1960, has run into
big drawbacks.
Converting the Coliseum or the
Rose Bowl for baseball purposes
would be very costly. The Dodg
ers may be forced to use the field
they bought from the Chicago
Cubs, 22,000-seat Wrigley Field in
Los Angeles.
"The situation is getting ridicu
lous," an O'Malley aide comment
ed yesterday,"and what the so
lution is I frankly don't know."
