# Arrillaga Leads in Indian Point Derby
## Sophomore Hits At 14.7; Haga Controls Boards 
### 
Five of Stan fords' first seven
men are sophomores, so it's no
surprise that a second-year man
is leading the Indians in scoring.
The number one man is John Ar
rillaga, 6-3 1 - guard who has
poured points through the basket
at a 14,7-points-per-game rate.
Pre - season evaluations said
that Arrillaga would be a valu
able man for Stanford, but he's
coming through at a clip even
better than was predicted for
him.
Arrillaga has scored his points
from the floor at a rate of better
than 12 per game, and has hit on
41.2 per cent of his shots. And
his 21 for 29 in the free throw
department gives him a 72.4 per
cent rating in this department.
The Indians' most accurate
shooter is soph Jerry Thuesen,
whose 20-for-43 represents an ex
cellent 46.5 shooting average.
Thuesen has also hit at an 82.6
rate from the free throw line.
The Cards as a team have a
very good 73.6 free throw accu
racy mark.
Dick Haga is a distant leader in
the important rebounding depart

ment for Stanford. He's pulled
down 91 in 11 games an average
of 8.4 per outing. Ne:d Brock -
meyer, with .">2, is the second
man.
Paul Neumann stands second
in the scoring race with an 11.9
average, but he holds the dubious
distinction of leading the per
sonal foul rankings with *10.
Despite the high total, he's
only fouled out of one game. One
happy note about the stats ev
erybody who's played has scored
for the Tribe.
