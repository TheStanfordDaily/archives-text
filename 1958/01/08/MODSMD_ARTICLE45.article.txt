# NO-CONTACT RULE RELAXED
## Changed Rushing Plan Will Begin in February 
### Jack Winkler 
Stanford initiates a new plan
for fraternity and eating club
rushing this year that pushes for
mal rush week back into spring
quarter, schedules introductory
open houses for winter quarter
and makes significant changes in
the no-contact rule.
This is the first step in the
gradual postponing of rushing
until the beginning of the sopho
more year.
The plan calls for four frater
nity and club open houses on
Feb. 10, Feb. 18, Feb. 27 and
March 7 or 10. The 24 fraternities
and the 700 plus men in the
freshman class will both be di
vided inlo four groups and a ro
tation system worked out so that
one group of rushees goes to a
different set of houses each
night. Each freshman will have
an opportunity to make a com
plete tour of tlie houses before
the beginning of rush week.
Formal rush week will have
only four open houses instead of
the usual five, on April 3, 4, 5
and 6, with no allotments of
houses or rushees. As usual the
eating clubs will have the option
of scheduling open houses prior
to the fraternity dates.
These will be followed by the
customary week of invitation
parties with pledge card signing
on April 11.
At the Interfraternity Council
meeting on Oct. 7 last quarter,
the 24 house presidents voted to
ease the no-contact rule to allow
more normal social relations be
tween freshmen and affiliated
men.
This year fraternity and club
men are allowed to talk to pros
pective pledges on Quad. How
ever. no freshman is allowed in
fraternity houses or clubs and no
affiliated man is allowed in Wil
bur. There is still no contact per
mitted off campus and freshmen
cannot attend club or house par
ties.
"We hope this will ease the
unnatural atmosphere about
rushing and lead to more normal
relations between affiliated men
and freshmen," said IFC Rushing
Chairman John Kidd when the
new rule was passed.
The University came to the

IPC last spring with grievances
about the great pressures put on
freshmen during rushing and the
consequent effect on grades. The
new regulations are the IFC's at
tempt to meet the problem.
