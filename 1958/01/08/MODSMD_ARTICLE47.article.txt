# Pelican 'Eggs' Objectionable?
## 
### 
The Ã¼biquitous c en so r s hi p
problem of the University of Cal
ifornia Pelican, Berkeley "hu
mor" magazine, came into the
limelight again last week.
In response to complaints,
"presumably from some member
of the administration," a meeting
of the Cal Publications Board
was held Friday to discuss the
magazine's December issue.
"The board met," the Daily
California!! reported, "discussed
the 'objectionable' parts, decided
they were not so objectionable
after all."
Board Chairman Jay Bardwell,
who is also editor of the "Mon
arch of the College Dailies," is
sued the following statement af
ter the meeting:
"The editor of the Pelican is
not going to be suspended. He is
not going to be fired. Wo did not
even speak harshly to him."
According to Bardwell, the fol
lowing factors were taken into
consideration when the issue was
discussed: (1) the jokes came
from other campus humor maga
zines, (21 a special advisory com
mittee of Pub Board, set up after
the last Pelican controversy, had
reviewed the magazine before
publication and had not objected
and (3) no students had com
plained.
Bardwell concluded, "In short,
we have decided that a humor
magazine could not be 'cleaned
up' too much more and still sell."
