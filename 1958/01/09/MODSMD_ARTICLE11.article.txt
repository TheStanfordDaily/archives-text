# Tonight's Discussions To Open Today and Tomorrow' Series
## Administration to Reveal Future Plans and Policies 
### 
Stanford's future plans and new policies will be revealed to stu
dents tonight as freshmen gather in their dormitories to hear the
first of the 1958 Stanford Today and Tomorrow series.
Faculty members and administrators directly concerned with Uni
versity plans will lead this year's series of informative discussions
on the plans and progress of the University.
Begun six years ago with the purpose of making better informed
alumni of Stanford students, the program has grown to the point of
being available to all Stanford students. Each Thursday of this
month Stanford Today and Tomorrow programs will be held at vari
ous living groups on campus.
"Stanford --Today and Tomorrow" is now a committee of stu
dents, faculty and administrators. Committee members are deter
mined by tryouts. Since the first series, topics have been broadened
to include such questions as enrollment, admissions, fraternities, tui
tion and athletics.
Students Ask
Student participation by asking questions and offering sugges
tions has been one of the most valuable contributions of the pro
gram. Student suggestions from past discussion groups have been
heeded in planning such things as Florence Moore dormitory, the
new Stern wing, academic requirements and the new Union.
"The objectives of the ST&T program from the student's point of
view are to give him an opportunity to hear and get to know key
University academic personnel in the informal atmosphere of the
living groups, and an opportunity to ask questions, the answers to
which are not readily obtainable in published form," said program
chairman Jim Sobieski.
Each program is especially geared to encourage student ques
tions.
Tonight's speakers include Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler
at Branner, and Summer Quarter Director Dr. E. H. Brooks with
Associate General Secretary James Triolo at Roble.

Speakers addressing all men students at Wilbur include Dean
Craig, Arroyo; General Secretary David Jacobson, Cedro; and Assist
ant to the President Kenneth Cuthbertson, Madera.
