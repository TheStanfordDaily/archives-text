## Student Aid Office Moves Into Own Room Next Week 
### 
The newly-created Office of Financial Aids—Stanford's method !•<
prevent students from leaving because of money troubles—will open
next week in Room 102-G, upstairs in the Dean of Students' office.
The office formally came into existence Jan. 2 with Robert P. Huff,
assistant dean of men, as its director. A new assistant dean is yet

to be named.
"The purpose of the Financial
Aids Office is to co-ordinate the
University's financial assistant'
to students," Huff explained. For
merly, he added, the responsibil
ity of financial aid was handled
by several relatively unrelated
offices.
Eventually the Financial Aids
Office will combine the adminis
tration of loans, grants in aid, un
dergraduate scholarships and stu
dent employment.
Most Functions
When the office opens next,
week it will have all of these
functions except that of student
employment, which is currently
a part of the Placement Service.
Student employment will he in
cluded as soon as the Financial
Awards Office moves into perma
nent quarters. (Room 102-Ci is
only temporary.)
The other functions — grants,
loans and scholarships —up to
now have been handled by the of
fices of the dean of men and dean
of women as well as the old Fi
nancial Awards office.
Scholarships are based on scho
lastic achievement and need while
grants are based almost entirely
on need; they serve as emergency
financial aid to keep a student in
school.
"Our new office hopes to make
possible 'package' arrangements
such as those now in use at some
Eastern colleges," Huff said.
"Package" plans are combina
tions, for example, a scholarship,
a hashing job and a long-term
loan.
Aid for 20 Per Cent
Huff noted that at present
about 20 per cent of the students
receive some form of aid other
than from their families.
Approixmately 30 per cent of
the tuition increase to he in ef
fect next year will be used for
scholarships and other forms of
aid, Huff said.
Next year's $335 - per • quartet
tuition will still supply only about
half of the funds needed to run
the University.
