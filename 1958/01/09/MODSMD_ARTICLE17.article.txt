# Ike Prepares State Message
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — Amid
clamor in Congress about the na
tion's defenses, President Eisen
hower worked yesterday on a
State of the Union message that
could be as crucial as any in U.S.
history.
The annual presidential report,
to be delivered in person today,
will be the focus of greater-than
usual attention because of a wide
spread belief that the country is
imperiled by Russia's scientific
military advances.
All signs indicated the Presi
dent would strive to assure the
free world that the U.S. defense
position is not nearly as bad as
some critics picture it, and that
all needed steps will be taken to
win the race with the Soviets.
The great argument on the sub
ject continued meanwhile, and
was typified by these contrasting
views:
• Vice • President Nixon de
clared it is "unmitigated non
sense" to say that the United
States is weaker than the Soviet
Union.
• Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin,
sticking to his decision to quit,
said the Army is rapidly deterio
rating and "1 can't get anything
done" on certain proposals to
strengthen it.
In delivering his message Ei
senhower will speak for perhaps
4.") minutes, beginning at 6:30
a.m. PST. His address will be tel
evised and broadcast by all the
major networks. The Senate and
House will meet jointly to hear
him.
