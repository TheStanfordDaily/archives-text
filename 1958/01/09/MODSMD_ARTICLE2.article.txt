# 'Batch' Botching To Be Replaced
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute has
undertaken the research and de
velopment phase of an automatic
commercial laundry. The project,
sponsored by the Ail-American
Research Foundation of Portland.
Ore., is directed toward replacing
present "batch" washing methods
by a continuous automatic process
in which items are washed and
dried individually and in sequence.
The new process will be design
ed so that it may be used with
existing sorting facilities and iron
ing machines. It is believed that
an automatic laundry will achieve
greater efficiency as well as bet
ter quality and control over pres
ent systems.
The Ail-American R c s e a r c h
Foundation is a nation-wide or
ganization of commercial laundry
owners interested in the develop
ment of improved methods of
laundering.
Under the supervision of the
Institute's engineering research
division, the project also Involves
the efforts of SRI chemists and
physicists.
