# TV Code for Commercials

### 
Tei.F.VISION is :i medium of entertainment thai
has found wide ratine since its inception ahont
10 years ago. I llroughout the years program
ing has steadily improved.
Unfortunately. this is not the case willi telc
\ ision advertising.
Some of the commercials that literally throw
themselves al people are ghastly, to say the
least. Thev insult people's intelligence, they
offend our sensibilities, and the product thus
advertised is consciouslv relegated bv us to the
bottom of the li-l of available articles in that
field.
\\e\e noticed, after watching the '"late late"
allows for a few nights during vacation, that
everv station announces, just before signing off,
that it subscribes to the television code of good
practice in its programing.
This is all well and good. T\ has set up a
voluntary code, similar to that established in
the movie industry. Some of the rules thev
follow seem lo us rather infantile, such as that
on low-cut dresses, but, all in all, there are
logical reasons for following the rules they
have sel up themselves.
Hut what about commercials? Aren't the
stations themselves to be held accountable for
the monstrosities Madison Avenue has dished
up for tin* public?

Let's take, for example, a common commer
cial seen praeticallv every dav hv TV viewers
an advertisement for (llorets chewing gum. A
while-frocked lab technician displays an instru
ment designed for the Armv Chemical Warfare
Service. It is reputed lo detect odors.
The technician places the sensitive pari of
the instrument over a beaker of raw onion
juice. Not until the beaker is tightly covered
does the needle on the indicator move up into
the "danger" zone.
Then the technician removes the sensitive
part from the beaker in order to add the in
gredients of ('.lorets to the onion juice. But
even when removed from the beaker, the
needle does not fall below the "danger" zone.
In fact, not until the beaker is tightly covered
again does the needle drop to the safety zone.
Now, we realize that not too much can be
done to improve some commercials, but a good
part of the present T\ commercials can obvi
ously be improved upon. The responsibility for
seeing that commercials are up to certain stand
ards belongs to I lie television industry.
The industry already subscribes to a code for
programing: why not subscribe to one for com
mercials?

everv station announces, just before signing off,
that it subscribes to the television code of good
practice in its programing.
This is all well and good. T\ has set up a
voluntary code, similar to that established in
the movie industry. Some of the rules thev
follow seem lo us rather infantile, such as that
on low-cut dresses, but, all in all, there are
logical reasons for following the rules they
have sel up themselves.
Hut what about commercials? Aren't the
stations themselves to be held accountable for
the monstrosities Madison Avenue has dished
up for tin* public?

Let's take, for example, a common commer
cial seen praeticallv every dav hv TV viewers
an advertisement for (llorets chewing gum. A
while-frocked lab technician displays an instru
ment designed for the Armv Chemical Warfare
Service. It is reputed lo detect odors.
The technician places the sensitive pari of
the instrument over a beaker of raw onion
juice. Not until the beaker is tightly covered
does the needle on the indicator move up into
the "danger" zone.
Then the technician removes the sensitive
part from the beaker in order to add the in
gredients of ('.lorets to the onion juice. But
even when removed from the beaker, the
needle does not fall below the "danger" zone.
In fact, not until the beaker is tightly covered
again does the needle drop to the safety zone.
Now, we realize that not too much can be
done to improve some commercials, but a good
part of the present T\ commercials can obvi
ously be improved upon. The responsibility for
seeing that commercials are up to certain stand
ards belongs to I lie television industry.
The industry already subscribes to a code for
programing: why not subscribe to one for com
mercials?
Tei.F.VISION is :i medium of entertainment thai

10 years ago. I llroughout the years program

Unfortunately. this is not the case willi telc

Some of the commercials that literally throw
themselves al people are ghastly, to say the
least. Thev insult people's intelligence, they
offend our sensibilities, and the product thus
advertised is consciouslv relegated bv us to the
bottom of the li-l of available articles in that
field.
