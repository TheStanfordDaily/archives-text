# RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS
## Labor Issue Discussed 
### Barbara Hicks 
Editor's Not* 4 : Today's article j
concludes a series of three pre
senting the right-to-work issue.

The possibility of the passage |
of a right-to-work law in Califor
j nia was discounted by Stanford j
professors John P. Troxell (in
dustrial management i and Mar-1
vin E. Rozen <economicsi, bull
Professor Hubert P. Marshall j
takes the opposite stand.
The recent labor scandals were |
j termed by Marshall as an impor-1
| tant aspect in considering the!
possibility of passage.
"The scandal will be high in
the minds of the voters,"he said,
"and is likely to turn them to
! anything which is against the
j unions. The steady increase in
the cost of living, which some
blame on union actions, will also
have an effect on the voting, in
; fluencing voters to pass right-to
-1 work legislation."
Too Industrialized
Rozen felt the voters will have
i forgotten most of the scandal by
the time the issue comes to a
I vote and the state is too indus
i trialized to allow for passage of
I such a bill.
"There is a large enough ele
ment of organized labor in this

state to deter the passage," added
Troxell. "The legislators will not
want to incur the wrath of the
unions by passing right-to-work
legislation."
The question of (he constitu
tionality of a slate right-to-work
law is answered in the Taft-Hart
ley Act of 1947. Article SA3 of
the act prohibits the closed shop,
but permits the union shop. How
ever, Article 148 gives state law
precedence, so if the states wish
to pass legislation, as 19 have
chosen to do, allowance has been
made by the Taft-Hartley Act.
Another Stanford economics
professor, while commenting
that he had no opinions about the
California issue in particular,
posed some points to consider on
right-to-work laws in general.
Freedom of Choice
The major question is, he said:
Is the union serving a useful pur
pose? If not, let's get rid of
them. But if they are an asset,
for instance in providing old-age
benefits, and insisting on safety
regulations, why injure them?
There will always be those
who will go along with the union
while it is establishing, he con
tinued, but once it is strong will,
if permitted by an open shop,
leave, thinking they are no long
er needed in the union. They
then reap the benefits the union
may provide, without contribut
ing to its support.
The point of freedom of choice
in union membership might be
compared to other aspects of
freedom, the professor went on,
such as the right to support the

government and pay taxes. If ev
eryone has his choice of whether j
or not to pay taxes, those who
do feel the obligation will he sup- 1
porting those who do not and I
who are still getting the benefits!
of government.
A boost for the opponents of
right •to • work legislation was i
given in 1954 by James P. Mitch
ell, Secretary of Labor at the
time. Mitchell attacked "right-to
work laws as "wreck laws" not
designed to provide work, but
rather to destroy unions, a prem
ise used in current arguments
against such proposed legisla
tion.
C. J. Haggerty secretary-treas
urer of the State Federation of
Labor, said he doesn't feel there
is any great likelihood that Cali
fornia will adopt a right-to-work
law. However, the State Federa
tion has authorized the spending
of up to $1 million, if needed, to
fight such legislation.
(The Stanford professor of
economics quoted in yesterday's i
right to-work article was George j
Hilton, not Ronald Hilton.)
