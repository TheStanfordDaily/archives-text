# Transfer of Heat Subject for Grant
## 
### 
Heat transfer in relation to
power generation from nuclear
fission, with its ramifications in
the chemical and pet r oleum
I fields, is the subject of a fellow
| ship grant by Yuba Consolidated
! Industries, Inc.
The firm has allocated $4500
annually for three years to be
awarded to a graduate student
I on a year-round basis in heat
i transfer fields that are of inter
est both to the University and to
Yuba Consolidated. Yuba recent
ly established a Research and De
velopment Center at Benicia,
Calif., to conduct research into
j these fields.
The fellowship program will be
j under the direction of George
i Leppert, associate professor of
j mechanical engineering, who di-
I rects Stanford's nuclear engi
| neering studies.
Dr. Leppert, while at Argonne
National Laboratory, helped de
sign the reactor engine for the
atomic submarine Nautilus dur
ing 1950-53.
