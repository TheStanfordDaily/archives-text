# Code Violation Rates Penalty
## 
### 
Men's Council recently sen
tenced a math student convicted
of an Honor Code violation to an
F in his mathematics course and
suspension for winter quarter.
The defendant's instructor tes
: lified that, when he returned at
the end of a midterm examina
tion to collect the papers, he saw
the defendant looking at another
i student's paper. When he grad
ed them, he noticed that both stu
dents had the same wrong an
swer to a particular problem, and
that the defendant's answer did
i not follow at all logically from
his original steps. The student
whose paper allegedly had been
; observed got the wrong answer
logically because he began with
i the wrong formula.
I The defendant pleaded inno
cent, stating that intermediate
steps, which would have shown
his answer to have followed logi
cally from his first steps, had
[ been done on scratch paper. The
j instructor testified that the class
' had been told not to use any
scratch paper, but to do all com
putations in blue books to be
handed in.
