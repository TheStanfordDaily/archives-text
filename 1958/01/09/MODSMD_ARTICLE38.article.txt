# Stats Show Why Indians Are Trailers
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference team
statistics released today show
why Stanford is at the bottom in
league basketball play with its
sad 0-2 record.
/
The best the Cards have done
in any of the six departments in
which figures are kept is fifth in
field goal percentages. The rest
of the stats give the Indians three
sevenths, an eighth and a cellar
dwelling ninth place.
Howie Dallmar's troupe has
managed to hit at a fairly respec
table .366 mark from the floor in
its two PCC outings. But in total
scoring, they're seventh with 55
points per game.
Free throw percentage gives
Stanford another seventh at .625.
There's trouble on the boards,
too, as the Tribe is getting just
45.8 per cent of the rebounds.
Defense is the saddest section
of allâ€” the Cards are second to
last in total defense and dead
last in field goal defense as the
opponents have scored on a red
hot 45.1 per cent of their shots.
Individually, -the -situation is
not quite so bleak. Dick Haga
stands third in field goal accu
racy with 8 for 16. and Paul Neu
mann is second in free throw av
erages with 8 out of 9 good.
Haga's near the top in rebound
ing, also, with 21 in two games.
Arrillaga Leads'
In PCC total scoring, it's John
Arrillaga who's pacing the Cards.
He stands only eighth in the con
ference, but his 16.5 average is
just three points less than the
leader, Doug Smart of Washing
ton.
Paul Neumann, with an 11-
point average, and Haga, with a
10-point mark, are the only In
dians in double figures for con
ference play.
Closely trailing Smart in the
race for individual honors is Ken
Nanson of Oregon State, who has
posted an 18.5 average thus far.
Jim Ross of WSC is third at 18.0,
and Ben Rogers of UCLA is
fourth with a 17.5 average.
Dave Gambee of OSC. Monte
Gonzales of USC. and Gary Me-
Ewen of Idaho are all tied for
fifth with 17.0 averages, barely
ahead of the Indians' Arrillaga.
Connie Burke of the Bruins
tops the loop in field goal accu
racy with a 53.3 per cent mark,
and Nanson is tops in free throws
with 11 for 12.
Chris Burford, with a 5.0 point
average, and Arrillaga, with a
39.5 shooting average, gain the
only other mentions for Stanford
in the stats.
