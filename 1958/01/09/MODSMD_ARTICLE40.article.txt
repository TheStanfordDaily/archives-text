## WSC Sports New Balance; Friel Won't Go Overboard 
### 
Jack Friel, in his final year as
basketball coach at Washington |
State, isn't going overboard for
the Cougars' chances over the j
full 16-game Pacific Coast Con
ference route, but
He says WSC isn't going to be
a soft touch for anybody if Jim i
Ross, John Maras, Bill Galbraith
and Dick Axelson continue their,
four-way scoring battle.
"We still don't have the back-1
board power to be real contend-1
ers, but you can't count these.
kids out when they come up with |
an effort like they did Saturday i
a g a in s t Stanford," F r ie 1 ex- j
claimed.
.478 Mark
WSC shot at an even .500 clip;
in the first half Saturday night i
against the Indians and wound
up the game with a good .478'
mark for the entire 40 minutes. |
"That's about what we'll have
to shoot to win against the big, '
strong clubs," Friel says. "But, '
who knows, maybe these kids |
can keep it up."
The tight scoring race that has j
pleased Friel so much finds the
four Cougars all in the double
figures.
It all adds up to a real switch |
for WSC, which has featured a i
single big scorer each of the last !
four seasons. This year, though. ]
the Cougars are showing a bal
anced attack that has been miss
ing for some time up at Pullman.
As of now, the leader in scor

ing for the PCC games is little
Ross. The 5-8 guard has flipped
in 37 points in ihe two games.
Maras, a big soph center, has 29
points while Galbraith and Axel
son are tied with 25.
Over the full 12-game span,
Ross has picked up 150 digits to
lead the club. The Cougars have
averaged 62.6 points in each of
their outings.
Stanford, of course, has al
ready had a dose of Cougar med
icine as it dropped a 61-51 deci
sion in the second game of the
conference season.
Time for Revenge
But the chance to even the
slate at 1-1 will come tomorrow
when the Cougars are in the
â€¢Stanford Pavilion for a return
go. Cage experts estimate that
the differences of home court ad
vantage average out to about 10
points, but 1 hat still leaves the
Cards three points short.
Tickets for the Cougar tilt are
available at the BAC. Student
body card holders get free admis
sion, but must still have a ticket.
General admission seats are
$1.50. Ducats are also available
for the Washington game Satur
day night. Game time both
nights is 8 o'clock.
Maras, with 122 rebounds, is
the top Cougar in the rebounding
department. Galbraith and Axel
son are the other chief threats
with 97 and 82 grabs respectively.
