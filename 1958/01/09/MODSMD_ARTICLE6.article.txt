# Union Shop Prohibition Submitted

### 
SACRAMENTO {IP)â€”Right-to
work, a key issue in Senator Wil
liam F. Knowland's campaign for
the California governorship, for
mally entered the state's 1958
election battles yesterday.
Proponents of a law to outlaw
the union shop submitted an ini
tiative measure to the State At
torney General's office for a bal
lot title.
The backers of the proposed
amendment to the state constitu
tion must now collect signatures
of 322,429 registered voters to
qualify it for the November bal
lot.
Union Democracy
Samuel Holmes, San Francisco
attorney who presented the meas
ure, said he was acting for How
ard B. Wyatt of Los Angeles,
whom he described as a Team
sters Union member and execu
tive secretary of "The Citizens
Committee for Democracy in La
bor Unions."
Asked if Knowland had any
connection with the measure,
Holmes said:
"Not to my knowledge."
There was no immediate com
ment from top labor leaders, who
contend right-to-work laws arc
camouflage for union busting.
Members Organize
Holmes distributed a press re
lease quoting Wyatt that, the citi
zens committee was "organized
by union members who have be
come disgusted and aroused by
the extent of corruption existing
within the union movement."
In brief, the proposed initiative
would prohibit labor-management
contracts requiring a worker to
join a union within a specified
time as a condition of holding his
job.
Holmes said the Wyatt commit
tee suggested the initiative be
titled "a measure to establish and
provied a means of enforcing the
principles of voluntary union
ism."
