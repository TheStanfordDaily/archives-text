The drive will continue through

to give "For Better and for WUS."
Proceeds from the Winter Drive
will go to World University Serv
ice, and the campaign will not Ix?
combined with other drives, as
was done last year when proceeds
were divided between the Red
Cross, the Community Chest and
WUS. A separate drive has al

Community Chest.
Torney also announced that the
"Penny Mile" and solicitation
booths on Quad would be discon
