# State of Union Speech Issues Call for Action
## President Requests Missile Step-up, Extension of Trade and Aid to Allies 
### 
WASHINGTON (/!') President Eisenhower proclaimed yesterday
a program of "safety through strength" and issued to the American
people and an applauding Congress a confident, ringing "call for
action."
This was the essence of Eisenhower's answer, in his annual State

of the Union message to Congress,
to what lie acknowledged are real,
growing, space-age dangers from
a Communist imperialism "wag
ing total cold war."
Eisenhower set forth an eight
point program and summoned the
country and Congress to rally be
hind it with sacrifices and under
standing. Many Democratic lead
ers promptly lined up with Re
publicans in expressions of sup
port and praise.
The President c a II e d for a
stepped -up missiles program, a
shakoup in the Pentagon to hall
harmful rivalries and greater eco
nomic aid to countries facing a
"m a s si v e economic offensive"
from the Kremlin.
Turn Toward IVace
And, by-passing Soviet leaders
completely, the Chief Executive
appealed directly and dramatical
ly to the Russian people to help
the world "turn the corner" to
ward lasting peace.
Eisenhower conceded that "most
of us" failed to anticipate the
"psychological impact upon the
world of the launching of the first
earth satellite" by Russia. He said
the consensus is that at the mo
ment America probably is "some
what behind the Soviets in some
areas of long-range ballistic mis
sile development."
"But," he added, "it is my con
viction. based on close study of
all relevant intelligence, with the
best information that Ihe scien
tists can bring me, that if we
make the necessary effort we will
have the missiles in the needed
quantity and in time to sustain
and strengthen the deterrent pow
er of our increasingly efficient
bombers."
Applause
His audience of senators and
House members gave him a round
of applause for that — and also
when he told them that, while the
nation has made gratifying prog
ress on missiles, "we must still do
more."
This was considered one of the
most important messages Eisen
hower ever delivered to Congress.
Critics there have demanded
stronger leadership and a greater
sense of urgency by the adminis
tration in meeting the challenge
of Soviet advances in space.
Eisenhower had put an excep
tional amount of work, thought
and polishing into his effort. The
manuscript from which he spoke
showed penciled evidence of nu
merous revisions, up to the last
minute.
"The world must stop the pres
ent plunge toward more and more
destructive weapons of war, and
turn the corner that will start our
steps firmly on the path toward
lasting peace."

And, by-passing Soviet leaders
completely, the Chief Executive
appealed directly and dramatical
ly to the Russian people to help
the world "turn the corner" to
ward lasting peace.
Eisenhower conceded that "most
of us" failed to anticipate the
"psychological impact upon the
world of the launching of the first
earth satellite" by Russia. He said
the consensus is that at the mo
ment America probably is "some
what behind the Soviets in some
areas of long-range ballistic mis
sile development."
"But," he added, "it is my con
viction. based on close study of
all relevant intelligence, with the
best information that Ihe scien
tists can bring me, that if we
make the necessary effort we will
have the missiles in the needed
quantity and in time to sustain
and strengthen the deterrent pow
er of our increasingly efficient
bombers."
Applause
His audience of senators and
House members gave him a round
of applause for that — and also
when he told them that, while the
nation has made gratifying prog

more."
This was considered one of the
most important messages Eisen
hower ever delivered to Congress.
Critics there have demanded
stronger leadership and a greater
sense of urgency by the adminis

of Soviet advances in space.
