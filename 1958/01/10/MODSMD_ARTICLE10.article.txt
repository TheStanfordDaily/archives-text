# Progress Comes to Old Encina; Landmark to Have Face Lifted
## Encina Soon to Be Office Structure 
### Rich Drown Associate Editor 
The lights in I ho now darkened
Encina Hall will once again burn
brightly, but never again—bar
ring unforeseen events will the
proud old edifice resound to the
merriment that takes place in a
college dormitory.
For yesterday the University
announced plans for a $1,350,000
rebuilding job which will trans
form the venerable structure into
modern offices and administra
tive headquarters. Work is sched
uled to begin in June and will
probably be finished by Septem
ber, 10:59.
From the outside, Stanford's
first, men's dormitory will con
tinue to appear as it has since its
opening in 1891. But a virtually
new structure will be sandwiched
in between the staunch sandstone
walls.
Those going to the new second-,
third- and fourth floor offices will
be able to use an elevator. The
fifth-floor attic, now containing
rooms, will be used for utilities
such as air conditioning.
Emergency Housing
The wings will not be included
in the forthcoming renovation.
Pending a later time when they
can be remodeled at an estimated
cost of $1.8 million, they will be
used for storage or emergency
housing.
Encina's conversion to office
space will free Inner and Outer
Quads for more academic space,
as the General Secretary's Of
fice, Planning Office, Placement
Service, News and Publication
Service and Food Research Insti
tute more into the former dorm.
Sixty-six years of colorful his
tory carved into wood and plaster
will soon be chopped away as
workmen rip out walls and pos
sibly floors. But the memories
will live forever.
It was from a room in Encina
that Herbert Hoover, member of
Stanford's pioneer class of 1895,
could gaze out at the land now
occupied by the tower named in
his honor.
First Inhabitants
"A Salem |Ore. | boy — Fred
Williams—and I moved into En
cina Hall . . . the week before its
opening and were proudly its
first inhabitants," the former
chief executive writes in his
memoirs..
Among other political, literary
and sports figures to occupy En
cina's spacious rooms were Good
win J. Knight, Maxwell Ander
son. John Steinbeck and Bob Ma
thias. Ex - President Benjamin
Harrison lived in an Encina suite
while he taught at Stanford.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, '96, Stan
ford's third president, became a
friend of Hoover's while both
lived in Encina. Later Wilbur
served as Secretary of the Inte
rior in President Hoover's cabi
net.
When men first moved into En
cina, which was modeled after
one of the Stanfords' favorite ho
tels in the Austrian Alps, the
electrical and hot-water systems
had not been completed.
"They issued us one candle
apiece every evening," D. H. Fry,
'95, of Palo Alto, recalls. "We'd


HISTORIC ENCINA HALL, WITH RESIDENTS OF THE CLASS OF 1895
save the candles carefully so we
could have enough to read by."
Mrs. Stanford believed that the
candles were safer than kerosene
lamps.
The main • floor clubroom
served as the dining room until
Encina Commons dining hall was
built in 1922. Originally a large
number of Chinese servants add
ed to Encina's hotel atmosphere.
During its many years of serv
ice Encina saw its number of wa
ter - bombings, battles with fire
hoses and other undergraduate
capers.
But it has survived. Even the
1906 earthquake did no lasting
harm. In that disaster two chim
neys crashed through the roof
and ended in the basement. One
student was killed and three were
injured.
During World War II the U.S.
Army took over Encina to house
men it was sending to Stanford
for special training. The 1943-45
era was one of 10:30 "lights out"
and 5:50 a.m. reveille.
New dorms have come. Encina
went into retirement Jan. 3, 1956,
as the last of its regular men res
idents left for Stern Hall.
But you can't keep a good dorm
vacant—not Encijia. So in the au
tumn of 1956 some 100 women,
awaiting completion of Moore
Hall, filed down the hallowed
hall and into the historic rooms,
which had been appropriately
decorated by the "Immortal Six"
from Stern Hall.
Encina's metamorphosis will be
under the direction of Eldridge T.
Spencer.

men it was sending to Stanford
for special training. The 1943-45
era was one of 10:30 "lights out"
and 5:50 a.m. reveille.
New dorms have come. Encina
went into retirement Jan. 3, 1956,
as the last of its regular men res
idents left for Stern Hall.
But you can't keep a good dorm
vacant—not Encijia. So in the au
tumn of 1956 some 100 women,
awaiting completion of Moore
Hall, filed down the hallowed
hall and into the historic rooms,
which had been appropriately
decorated by the "Immortal Six"
from Stern Hall.
Encina's metamorphosis will be
under the direction of Eldridge T.
Spencer.
The lights in I ho now darkened
Encina Hall will once again burn
brightly, but never again—bar
ring unforeseen events will the
proud old edifice resound to the
merriment that takes place in a
college dormitory.
For yesterday the University
announced plans for a $1,350,000
rebuilding job which will trans
form the venerable structure into
modern offices and administra
tive headquarters. Work is sched
uled to begin in June and will
probably be finished by Septem
ber, 10:59.
From the outside, Stanford's
first, men's dormitory will con
tinue to appear as it has since its
opening in 1891. But a virtually
new structure will be sandwiched
in between the staunch sandstone
walls.
Those going to the new second-,
third- and fourth floor offices will
be able to use an elevator. The
fifth-floor attic, now containing
rooms, will be used for utilities
such as air conditioning.
Emergency Housing
The wings will not be included
in the forthcoming renovation.
Pending a later time when they
can be remodeled at an estimated
cost of $1.8 million, they will be
used for storage or emergency
housing.
Encina's conversion to office
space will free Inner and Outer
Quads for more academic space,

fice, Planning Office, Placement
Service, News and Publication
Service and Food Research Insti

Sixty-six years of colorful his
tory carved into wood and plaster
will soon be chopped away as
workmen rip out walls and pos
sibly floors. But the memories
will live forever.
It was from a room in Encina
that Herbert Hoover, member of
Stanford's pioneer class of 1895,
could gaze out at the land now
occupied by the tower named in
his honor.
First Inhabitants
"A Salem |Ore. | boy — Fred
Williams—and I moved into En
cina Hall . . . the week before its
opening and were proudly its
first inhabitants," the former
chief executive writes in his
memoirs..
Among other political, literary
and sports figures to occupy En
cina's spacious rooms were Good
win J. Knight, Maxwell Ander
son. John Steinbeck and Bob Ma
thias. Ex - President Benjamin
Harrison lived in an Encina suite
while he taught at Stanford.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, '96, Stan
ford's third president, became a
friend of Hoover's while both
lived in Encina. Later Wilbur
served as Secretary of the Inte
rior in President Hoover's cabi
net.
When men first moved into En
cina, which was modeled after
one of the Stanfords' favorite ho
tels in the Austrian Alps, the
electrical and hot-water systems
had not been completed.
"They issued us one candle
apiece every evening," D. H. Fry,
'95, of Palo Alto, recalls. "We'd

could have enough to read by."
Mrs. Stanford believed that the
candles were safer than kerosene
lamps.
The main • floor clubroom
served as the dining room until

During its many years of serv

hoses and other undergraduate
capers.
But it has survived. Even the
1906 earthquake did no lasting
harm. In that disaster two chim

Mrs. Stanford believed that the
candles were safer than kerosene
lamps.
The main • floor clubroom
served as the dining room until
Encina Commons dining hall was
built in 1922. Originally a large
number of Chinese servants add
ed to Encina's hotel atmosphere.
During its many years of serv
ice Encina saw its number of wa
ter - bombings, battles with fire
hoses and other undergraduate
capers.
But it has survived. Even the
1906 earthquake did no lasting
harm. In that disaster two chim
neys crashed through the roof
and ended in the basement. One
student was killed and three were
injured.
During World War II the U.S.
Army took over Encina to house
men it was sending to Stanford
for special training. The 1943-45
era was one of 10:30 "lights out"
and 5:50 a.m. reveille.
New dorms have come. Encina
went into retirement Jan. 3, 1956,
as the last of its regular men res
idents left for Stern Hall.
But you can't keep a good dorm
vacant—not Encijia. So in the au
tumn of 1956 some 100 women,
awaiting completion of Moore
Hall, filed down the hallowed
hall and into the historic rooms,
which had been appropriately
decorated by the "Immortal Six"
from Stern Hall.
Encina's metamorphosis will be
under the direction of Eldridge T.
Spencer.
The lights in I ho now darkened
Encina Hall will once again burn
brightly, but never again—bar
ring unforeseen events will the
proud old edifice resound to the
merriment that takes place in a
college dormitory.
For yesterday the University
announced plans for a $1,350,000
rebuilding job which will trans
form the venerable structure into
modern offices and administra
tive headquarters. Work is sched
uled to begin in June and will
probably be finished by Septem
ber, 10:59.
From the outside, Stanford's
first, men's dormitory will con
tinue to appear as it has since its
opening in 1891. But a virtually
new structure will be sandwiched
in between the staunch sandstone
walls.
Those going to the new second-,
third- and fourth floor offices will
be able to use an elevator. The
fifth-floor attic, now containing
rooms, will be used for utilities
such as air conditioning.
Emergency Housing
The wings will not be included
in the forthcoming renovation.
Pending a later time when they
can be remodeled at an estimated
cost of $1.8 million, they will be
used for storage or emergency
housing.
Encina's conversion to office
space will free Inner and Outer
Quads for more academic space,

Service and Food Research Insti

Sixty-six years of colorful his
tory carved into wood and plaster
will soon be chopped away as
workmen rip out walls and pos
sibly floors. But the memories
will live forever.
It was from a room in Encina
that Herbert Hoover, member of
Stanford's pioneer class of 1895,
could gaze out at the land now
occupied by the tower named in
his honor.
First Inhabitants
"A Salem |Ore. | boy — Fred
Williams—and I moved into En
cina Hall . . . the week before its
opening and were proudly its
first inhabitants," the former
chief executive writes in his
memoirs..
Among other political, literary
and sports figures to occupy En
cina's spacious rooms were Good
win J. Knight, Maxwell Ander
son. John Steinbeck and Bob Ma
thias. Ex - President Benjamin
Harrison lived in an Encina suite
while he taught at Stanford.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, '96, Stan
ford's third president, became a
friend of Hoover's while both
lived in Encina. Later Wilbur
served as Secretary of the Inte
rior in President Hoover's cabi
net.
When men first moved into En
cina, which was modeled after
one of the Stanfords' favorite ho
tels in the Austrian Alps, the
electrical and hot-water systems
had not been completed.
"They issued us one candle
apiece every evening," D. H. Fry,
'95, of Palo Alto, recalls. "We'd
