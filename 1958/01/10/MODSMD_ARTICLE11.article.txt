# Horses, Cows—Even Autos-Also Inhabited Encina Hall
## 
### 
Encina Hall, soon to become an
office and administrative build
ing. has been described as "the
cradle of some of the nation's
great intellects."
But at the same time it was a
cradle of riotous tumult that
would put many a Wild West
movie to shame.
Perhaps the old dormitory got
off to a bad start as far as beha
vior is concerned. Its first direc
tor was a former English butler.
What this man knew about polite
society of Victorian England did
not help him understand ener
getic, irresponsible youth
One group of Encina residents
—this was long after the butler
had thrown up his hands in des
pair and left- apparently wanted
to practice dismantling and reas
sembling old automobiles.
They carried the car parts up
four flights of stairs, put them
together and soon went chug
chugging merrily up and down
the hall. By the time the "taxi
service" was terminated, one wall
had been bashed in and several
fellows were in plenty of hot
water.
Other stories concern the lead
ing of horses and cows into the
stately structure. One story
true or not has it that a cow was
fed so much hay that it couldn't
squeeze through the door to get
out.
Then, so the tale goes, it had to
be shot and carried out in various
sizes of steaks, roasts, loins and

other table items.
Some old grads tell of a time
when a fire hose was wound
when a fire hose was wound
among the slats in the banister
of the stairway. The water was
turned on but a kink occurred in
the hose. The result: an "explo
sion" which sent slats flying all
over.
Not all antics were bad, though.
During the 1906 earthquake one
frightened lad ran to the window,
gave a leap—and discovered he
was, or had been, on the fourth
floor. He grabbed the eaves and
hung there until retrieved by
classmates.
