## 
### 
Early next month 03 Stanford
students will learn that tliey will
be the first to attend "Stanford in
Germany." Stanford's new branch
in Stuttgart. The group, composed
of 30 women and 33 men, is cur
rently being selected from 107 ap
plicants for the program, accord
ing to dean of students 11. Donald
Winbigler.
Winbiglor last night addressed
a group of freshman girls at
Bran tier Ilall as part of the 1958
"Stanford Today and Tomorrow"
program. Deviating slightly from
the usual series procedure of giv
ing a brief talk on Stanford's
plans, the clean began by posing
30 interesting questions, from
which the audience derived their
own.
The question "Mow will the in
creased tuitions be distributed?"
was uppermost in the girls'
minds. Winbigler explained that
primarily the increase will be used
to increase faculty salaries and in
crease student aid. He said that
in the past seven years salaries
have increased by as much as GO

per cent, but, in order to maintain
a high-standard faculty, the Uni
versity hopes to increase salaries
by as much as 100 per cent during
the next seven years.
The University wants to hold
undergraduate enrollment at its
present level, stated Winbigler.
"Pressures are great for an in
crease. and enrollment may have
to be increased in time, but we
don't want to unless we can pro
vide facilities," he added.
The question of the new Stu
dent Union and Activities Center
was also of interest to the group.
Stanford now has one million dol
lars in the Union fund. Plans
have been completed, and the fin
ished center will cost about two
million dollars. The dean describ
ed the proposed center and hinted
that it might be feasible to begin
it soon with the money already
put aside for the project.
"When will tuition be increased
again?" asked one curious fresh
man. Winbigler said he could
foresee no increase for at least
five years.

undergraduate enrollment at its
present level, stated Winbigler.
"Pressures are great for an in
crease. and enrollment may have
to be increased in time, but we
don't want to unless we can pro
vide facilities," he added.
The question of the new Stu
dent Union and Activities Center
was also of interest to the group.
Stanford now has one million dol
lars in the Union fund. Plans
have been completed, and the fin
ished center will cost about two
million dollars. The dean describ
ed the proposed center and hinted
that it might be feasible to begin
it soon with the money already
put aside for the project.
"When will tuition be increased
again?" asked one curious fresh
man. Winbigler said he could
foresee no increase for at least
five years.

"I'ressures Are Great"
Early next month 03 Stanford
students will learn that tliey will
be the first to attend "Stanford in
Germany." Stanford's new branch
in Stuttgart. The group, composed
of 30 women and 33 men, is cur
rently being selected from 107 ap
plicants for the program, accord
ing to dean of students 11. Donald
Winbigler.
Winbiglor last night addressed
a group of freshman girls at
Bran tier Ilall as part of the 1958
"Stanford Today and Tomorrow"
program. Deviating slightly from
the usual series procedure of giv
ing a brief talk on Stanford's
plans, the clean began by posing
30 interesting questions, from
which the audience derived their
own.
The question "Mow will the in
creased tuitions be distributed?"
was uppermost in the girls'
minds. Winbigler explained that
primarily the increase will be used
to increase faculty salaries and in
crease student aid. He said that
in the past seven years salaries
have increased by as much as GO

per cent, but, in order to maintain
a high-standard faculty, the Uni
versity hopes to increase salaries
by as much as 100 per cent during
the next seven years.
The University wants to hold
undergraduate enrollment at its
present level, stated Winbigler.
