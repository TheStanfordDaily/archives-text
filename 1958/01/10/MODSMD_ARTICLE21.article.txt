# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—By Barbara Hicks
## Face Inflation Prospect 
### 
"This may be Ihe year that this country must
romp to grips with the problem of inflation or
face the prospect of it running away with our
economy. Indications also point to this year's
business falling below the standards set by busi
ness volume last year." So says University of
Southern California Dean of the School of Com
merce Lawrence C. Lock lev. In the columns of
the Daily Trojan, Dr. Lockley adds, "unemploy
ment is on the increase, and may mount to up
ward of seven million. . . . Christmas business
was not as good as we had hoped. . . . The recep
tion of the 1958 model cars by the public has not
yet been joyous. . . . The stock market is show
ing weakness. . . . Manufacturers' inventories
are up. but sales are down." All this for a happy
new year.

"Rumor has it that some of us are discarding
our proper modesty and saying unkind words to
the Los Angeles sportswriters and the PCC 'bolt
ers'," says Jack Wilson in the Oregon Daily Em
erald. "Actually, no caustic comments from this
coiner are called for. Oregon's moral victory in
the Hose Bowl speaks for itself. That victory
tells the whole nation, if people are willing 1o
look beneath the surface, that it isn't under-the
table money and million-dollar athletic programs
lhat make a great football leam. . . . The pity
is that for the California schools the object les
son came too late. And, regardless of how many
people see how many California victories in the
years ahead, those players and those schools will

be much the poorer for it.
Two Japanese student publications reached the I
Daily exchange files this week. One, the Haku
mon Herald, a newspaper published by the Eng- j
lish-Speaking Society of Chuo University in To- ;
kvo, is observing its first anniversary. The edi- !
tors note that the Herald has succeeded despite!
doubts on the English language ability of Chuo I
students. "Students today are requested to have
a good knowledge of English since English is an
international language and is instrumental in ob
taining foreign knowledge," (The reader will
recall Professor Anatole Mazour's similar com
ments in Wednesday's Daily regarding the Rus
sian language.)

The second Japanese student publication is ti
tled Japanese Student and is published by the
Student Information Federation. Among the nu
merous articles in the 30-page mimeographed
edition is one which begins, "There can be little
doubt of the serious purpose, the earnest endeav
or, of almost every Japanese student, something
one all too often misses in American students.
Nor is there any doubt but that the student here
is as well-meaning, as idealistic and devoted as
any in the world. At times he may appear naive
or all too serious, which gives rise to the feeling,
false in my own experience, that he lacks a sense
of humor. The latter is very difficult, but all the
more necessary to one so hard-working as the I
average Japanese student."
