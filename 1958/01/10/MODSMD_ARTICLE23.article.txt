| Trusteeship Council of the Unit
! ed Nations for the United King

and the purpose of European of
ficials there is to prepare the Af
| rican people so that the transfor
mation to local governments can
j be accomplished smoothly.
He explained that the relation
| ship between Africans and Euro

! these people stay — as people
j working and living there." He
[ added that Africans will still de

roads and other public works.
The job of the Trusteeship

He said it had been 18 years since
he had visited California and he
