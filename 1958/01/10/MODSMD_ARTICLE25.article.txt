Iliisky-nik Launching Plans
Tho University of Washing-ton does not want to be known as a
school that is behind tho times. So- in order to assure all readers
of the 1957-58 basketball press book that the Huskies weren't letting
the Russians get ahead of them, a report was prepared by Tippy Dye
concerning his efforts "to launch Washington's satellite, with a live
Husky mascot aboard, high into the Pacific Coast Conference stratos
phere dining the 1 J)i>S 1.G.8.Y. (International Geo-Basketball Year)."
The report is a clever piece of work filled with allusions to good
ol' Sputnik, such as:
"Gentlemen, although we lack some rocket power we had
anticipated . . . there does remain a slim possibility that the
'Ifusky-nik' will be fired as far into space as those satellites
launched by other institutions in the conference during the 1958
1.G.8.Y.
"We had hoped that our Husky—like his distant cousin—could
reign above all other satellites. Our plan was to launch the
'Husky-nik* into its proposed orbit by successively firing twin
rockets which were proved in 2(> exhaustive tests during the 1957
1.G.8.Y. . . .
"The second (Doug Smart) rocket was 6-7 in length, weighed
2MO pounds. Developed by Prof. Robert Tate of Garfield High,
Seattle, its rated firing power in 1957 was -194 points, 329 re
bounds. . . .
"However, the Boin rocket (number one) will not be used
during the present Geo-Basketball Year. The cause is not me
chanical in nature, but rather is related to the theorem that a
rocket has but three firing phases. The Boin rocket has had two
phases expended.
"IK final firing opportunity will be used in 1959 in an attempt
fo launch the 'Husky-nik' farther into space than any past
satellite' at the University. . . .
"Briefly, I would assess the strength of our 'Husky-nik'
I luisly:
"FIRING POWKR —Better balanced; perhaps greatest in total
effect since 1953. . . .
"GRKATKST CONCERN —Because of high altitude expected
from IJCLA, Oregon State, California and USC satellite's, our
Bom-less Husky, come March («. may be as dead as his foreign
cousin.

lie Even Col llie Free Tickets
Celling a bigger break than the one Don Manoukian got prior to
the Shrine game would be a rugged task for anybody. Problems arose
for Jack Curtice and the West squad when a tackle from the South-

west was called home because of
an auto accident in which his wife
was injured. Curtice and his staff
look a qui e k look and spied
Manouk right on campus here,
where ihe West team was train
ing.
They contacted Manouk and
go! his acceptance just before din
ner lime, so lie filed right into the
dining hall and got ihe free meal.
And then, to top it off, compli
mentary tickets were passed out
a few minutes later, so he latched
onto those too.
Of course, that didn't really
top things off the peak didn't
come until tHe East-West game,
when the Reno senior played the
best game of his career and came
off the field as the winner of the
Outstanding Lineman Award, out
fighting All-Americans Lou Mi
chaels and Alex Harms all the
way.
Stanford sports are getting a

bigger and bigger play on the air
waves. Latest show to center on Indian activities is Boh Murphy's
"Stanford Spotlight." Bob, a Tribe baseballer from about five years
back, talks about the Cards every Saturday morning at 10:45 on
IvIBK, the Palo Alto and San Francisco station that's at 1220 kc.
lie's been on about a month now and has interviewed John Brodie,
Jack Douglas, Chuck Taylor and Walt Carnage on the 15-minute
show. Tomorrow's guest is cage coach Howie Dallniar. They'll talk
about Indian prospects, old vs. new styles on the court, and the effect
of the latest rules changes.
Speaking of rules changes, seems like the recent alterations in
clude what must be the stupidest rule of all time. Referees or some
other officials must have trouble counting higher than five, because
the new college laws specify that no uniform number may end in a
digit higher than five. All the players who wore numbers such as 17
or 28 last year should feel proud; their numbers have been perma
nently retired by a goofy rule.
What, Poor Diplomacy?
Some people over at Cal may not be as red-hot for the idea of
snubbing the Northwest as the Berkeleyites would like to have us
think. One individual—Al Moss, a Daily Californian sports column
ist is really hot under the collar about Cal refusing to schedule
Oregon, Oregon State or Washington State in 1961 and 1962 football
games.
Moss's main point is that "it isn't dropping those three teams . . .
I'rom the schedule that hurts. It's the obvious snub that went with it.
That was very poor diplomacy on the part of the University."
.Moss also refers to Fd Pauley's (regent chairman) plan for more
intersectionals as. "in a word, baloney!" And the same phrase fits
the Berkeley plan to schedule only teams with similar academic
levels:
"If Washington and USC come any closer to Cal's academic
standards than those slighted individuals, we would be very sur
prised—USC's new plan notwithstanding. It has been known for
a long time that the Trojans, for instance, clean up on athletes
who haven't the grades to get into this University."
Blasting of the plan for big intersectionals continues:
".Money is not, or should not he, as big a consideration as it
seems. For one thing, the University already schedules three big
intersectionals. For another thing, long trips and guarantees
cost money too.
"And for one more thing, if intersectionals are so damned
appealing, why don't we get rid of Washington—a tanker that
hasn't drawn flies at Berkeley in recent years —and thus have
one more open date?" *
Knd of blast from Cal.
