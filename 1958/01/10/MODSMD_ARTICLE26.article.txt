# Indians Host WSC, Huskies in PCC Home Openers
## Up and Down Tribe After 1st Loop Win 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford's elevator Indians will try to push the
! "Up" button two nights in a row when they tangle
! with a pair of teams from Washington tonight and
tomorrow at the Pavilion.
The up-and-down basket bailers will play their
second straight game against Washington State
tonight at 8 o'clock, and return to the floor 21
hours later against Tippy Dye's University of
Washington quintet.
Even in Workouts
Not content with containing their high and low
antics to game action, the Cards have gone pretty
spotty in workouts. In reply to queries about this
week's practices, coach Howie Dallmar said,
"They're up and down, just like in games."
Stanford will not be at full strength for the
! games. Paul Neumann and Jerry Thuesen are
both down with the flu, and will see only limited
action if. indeed, they play at all. As a result, the
i starting line-up as announced by Dallmar will
have Dick 1-laga and John Arrillaga at forwards,
Neal Brockmeyer at center, Chris Burford at one
guard and Doug Warren at the other in place of
N'eumann.
Haga for Rehounriings
In a nutshell, I-laga provides the chief rebound
ing strength, with Brockmeyer also furnishing
height; Arrillaga will now be counted on for the
greater share of the scoring, with Warren helping
in the baekcourt and floor phases of the game.
Burford is the most aggressive of the lot.
This week's pair of attractions- the first PCC
home games for the Indians this year won't have
, just one topsy-turvy team in them.
The Cougars and Huskies both are sporting all
sorts of question marks, so both contests shape up
as capable of going either way, and by anywhere
from a one- to 20-point margin.
One \\ in
In six conference games, the three clubs have
won a total of one and that was unavoidable,

[ since the Cougars were playing
ilie Indians. As things presently
stand, the Huskies and Slanford
are tied for the cellar with 0-2
marks, while WSC is tangled in
the middle of the pack with a 1-1
record.
Stanford knows what task it
has cut out for 1 itself againsl Jack
Friel's club tonight. Washington
State didn't have the least hit of
trouble after the 10-minute mark
last Saturday as they walked all |
I over the inexperienced Stanfords, i
64-51.
Throwing out Ihe 8-1 lead!
which the Tribe picked up in the i
first couple of minutes, il be- j
comes apparent how domina-nt j
the Cougars were once they gol j
rolling.
Clever Dribbler
Most of the damage, particu
larly when the game reached the
stalling stages, was done by Jim
Ross. Standing .just 5-8, Ross is i
a master of ball handling and
doubles as a standout scorer.
The big question mark about
the Cougars is whether or not
they can play back to their show-1
ings of last weekend. The night I
before beating the Tribe, they
| were victims to a two-point loss
| at the hands of USC, the confer-1
I ence leader.
But before that. WSC didn't j
look any too outstanding. Their
j worst showing was against Utah,
| which whipped them 70-48. Of
! course, Stanford was bombed by i
j the Utes also, 65-49.
Fooling Experts
If WSC does win again, they
! will be well on the road toward
1 fooling the experts who predicted
| they would finish eighth in an ad
! mittedly tight PCC race.
All-Coast ace Doug Smart will
j be the man to watch Saturday
| when the Huskies move in. He
[ leads the PCC in scoring with a
19.5 average and is probably the
best big man in the conference.
Washington's problems have j
j been with the other four men on !
the floor. None of them has i
scored more than eight points,
and the team is a whole is shoot
ing at a less than 30 per cent rate.
Same Line-up
Despite the two losses last
weekend, Dye still plans to stick
| with the five men who have start
led recent games: forwards A 1
Murphy and Earle Irvine, center j
Smart and guards Bill Stady and j
Dick Crews.

Stanford will not be at full strength for the
! games. Paul Neumann and Jerry Thuesen are
both down with the flu, and will see only limited
action if. indeed, they play at all. As a result, the
i starting line-up as announced by Dallmar will
have Dick 1-laga and John Arrillaga at forwards,
Neal Brockmeyer at center, Chris Burford at one
guard and Doug Warren at the other in place of
N'eumann.
Haga for Rehounriings
In a nutshell, I-laga provides the chief rebound
ing strength, with Brockmeyer also furnishing
height; Arrillaga will now be counted on for the
greater share of the scoring, with Warren helping
in the baekcourt and floor phases of the game.
Burford is the most aggressive of the lot.
This week's pair of attractions- the first PCC
home games for the Indians this year won't have
, just one topsy-turvy team in them.
The Cougars and Huskies both are sporting all
sorts of question marks, so both contests shape up
as capable of going either way, and by anywhere
from a one- to 20-point margin.
One \\ in
In six conference games, the three clubs have
won a total of one and that was unavoidable,

[ since the Cougars were playing
ilie Indians. As things presently
stand, the Huskies and Slanford
are tied for the cellar with 0-2
marks, while WSC is tangled in
the middle of the pack with a 1-1
record.
Stanford knows what task it
has cut out for 1 itself againsl Jack
Friel's club tonight. Washington
State didn't have the least hit of
trouble after the 10-minute mark
last Saturday as they walked all |
I over the inexperienced Stanfords, i
64-51.
Throwing out Ihe 8-1 lead!
which the Tribe picked up in the i
first couple of minutes, il be- j
comes apparent how domina-nt j
the Cougars were once they gol j
rolling.
Clever Dribbler
Most of the damage, particu
larly when the game reached the
stalling stages, was done by Jim
Ross. Standing .just 5-8, Ross is i
a master of ball handling and
doubles as a standout scorer.
The big question mark about
the Cougars is whether or not
they can play back to their show-1
ings of last weekend. The night I
before beating the Tribe, they
| were victims to a two-point loss
| at the hands of USC, the confer-1
I ence leader.
But before that. WSC didn't j
look any too outstanding. Their
j worst showing was against Utah,
| which whipped them 70-48. Of
! course, Stanford was bombed by i
j the Utes also, 65-49.
Fooling Experts
If WSC does win again, they
! will be well on the road toward
1 fooling the experts who predicted
| they would finish eighth in an ad
! mittedly tight PCC race.
All-Coast ace Doug Smart will
j be the man to watch Saturday
| when the Huskies move in. He
[ leads the PCC in scoring with a
19.5 average and is probably the
best big man in the conference.
Washington's problems have j
j been with the other four men on !
the floor. None of them has i
scored more than eight points,
and the team is a whole is shoot
ing at a less than 30 per cent rate.
Same Line-up
Despite the two losses last
weekend, Dye still plans to stick
| with the five men who have start
led recent games: forwards A 1
Murphy and Earle Irvine, center j
Smart and guards Bill Stady and j
Dick Crews.

in the baekcourt and floor phases of the game.
Burford is the most aggressive of the lot.
This week's pair of attractions- the first PCC
home games for the Indians this year won't have
, just one topsy-turvy team in them.
The Cougars and Huskies both are sporting all
sorts of question marks, so both contests shape up
as capable of going either way, and by anywhere
from a one- to 20-point margin.
One \\ in
In six conference games, the three clubs have
won a total of one and that was unavoidable,

[ since the Cougars were playing
ilie Indians. As things presently
stand, the Huskies and Slanford
are tied for the cellar with 0-2
marks, while WSC is tangled in
the middle of the pack with a 1-1
record.
Stanford knows what task it
has cut out for 1 itself againsl Jack
Friel's club tonight. Washington
State didn't have the least hit of
trouble after the 10-minute mark
last Saturday as they walked all |
I over the inexperienced Stanfords, i
64-51.
Throwing out Ihe 8-1 lead!
which the Tribe picked up in the i
first couple of minutes, il be- j
comes apparent how domina-nt j
the Cougars were once they gol j
rolling.
Clever Dribbler
Most of the damage, particu
larly when the game reached the
stalling stages, was done by Jim
Ross. Standing .just 5-8, Ross is i
a master of ball handling and
doubles as a standout scorer.
The big question mark about
the Cougars is whether or not
they can play back to their show-1
ings of last weekend. The night I
before beating the Tribe, they
| were victims to a two-point loss
| at the hands of USC, the confer-1
I ence leader.
But before that. WSC didn't j
look any too outstanding. Their
j worst showing was against Utah,
| which whipped them 70-48. Of
! course, Stanford was bombed by i
j the Utes also, 65-49.
Fooling Experts
If WSC does win again, they
! will be well on the road toward
1 fooling the experts who predicted
| they would finish eighth in an ad
! mittedly tight PCC race.
All-Coast ace Doug Smart will
j be the man to watch Saturday
| when the Huskies move in. He
[ leads the PCC in scoring with a
19.5 average and is probably the
best big man in the conference.
Washington's problems have j
j been with the other four men on !
the floor. None of them has i
scored more than eight points,
and the team is a whole is shoot
ing at a less than 30 per cent rate.
Same Line-up
Despite the two losses last
weekend, Dye still plans to stick
| with the five men who have start
led recent games: forwards A 1
Murphy and Earle Irvine, center j
Smart and guards Bill Stady and j
Dick Crews.


DICK HAG A —TOP BOARD .MAN
Stanford's elevator Indians will try to push the
! "Up" button two nights in a row when they tangle
! with a pair of teams from Washington tonight and
tomorrow at the Pavilion.
The up-and-down basket bailers will play their
second straight game against Washington State
tonight at 8 o'clock, and return to the floor 21
hours later against Tippy Dye's University of
Washington quintet.
Even in Workouts
Not content with containing their high and low
antics to game action, the Cards have gone pretty
spotty in workouts. In reply to queries about this
week's practices, coach Howie Dallmar said,
"They're up and down, just like in games."
Stanford will not be at full strength for the
! games. Paul Neumann and Jerry Thuesen are
both down with the flu, and will see only limited
action if. indeed, they play at all. As a result, the
i starting line-up as announced by Dallmar will
have Dick 1-laga and John Arrillaga at forwards,
Neal Brockmeyer at center, Chris Burford at one
guard and Doug Warren at the other in place of
N'eumann.
Haga for Rehounriings
In a nutshell, I-laga provides the chief rebound
ing strength, with Brockmeyer also furnishing
height; Arrillaga will now be counted on for the
greater share of the scoring, with Warren helping
in the baekcourt and floor phases of the game.
