# STANFORD'S HISTORY
## Senator Could 'Manage' $5 Million To Preserve Past and Build Future

Editor's Note: This is the
second of a series on the his
tory of Stanford University.
Tile first article appeared in
Monday's Daily. Today's chro
nology deals with the founding
of the University and the be
ginnings of many of today's
most famous institutions and
traditions.

Lcland Stanford's fortune grew
by leaps and bounds as a result
of his railroad partnership with
Collis Potter Huntington, Mark
Hopkins and Charles Crocker.
Stanford spent a good portion
of his money on his farm at Palo
Alto. The couple's only child, Lc
land Jr., loved the times at the
farm.
At 15 the boy could speak
French as fluently as English,
and on the family's two visits to
Europe he made many valuable
contacts. He was fond of collect
ing and had ideas of founding a
museum at San Francisco later.
in May 1883 the family left New
York for their second European
voyage. Neither Mr. nor Mrs.
Stanford had been well, and the
l lip was advised by their physi
cian.
Lcland Became III
They traveled the continent and
spent Christmas at Vienna. The
boy felt slightly ill in Athens,
worse in Naples, and by the time
they reached Ilome his condition
had "become somewhat alarm
ing."
They pushed on to Florence,
Italy, where the trouble was diag
nosed as typhoid fever. The dis
ease took its natural course, and
in three weeks the crisis seemed
to have passed.
The doctor congratulated the
parents on the favorable outcome.
The next day there was a sharp
relapse. The following morning,
March 13, 1884, Leland Jr. died.
"Service of Humanity".
The grief-ridden parents turned
lo thoughts of a memorial for
their son as a relief from sorrow.
They sought a memorial "through
which the wealth and devotion to
have been lavished on their son
might be dedicated to the service
of humanity."
Stanford awoke from a troubled
sleep the morning after the death
of their son with these words on
his lips: "The children of Califor
nia shall be our children."
And so Leland Stanford Junior
University was born.
When the Stanford family fi
nally returned to the United

States in May of 1884, they had
not yet decided upon a memorial
to their son. It lay among the
founding of a university, estab
lishing scholarships and building
a museum in San Francisco.
They remained in the East on
railroad business and visited vari
ous educational institutions, in
cluding Cornell, Yale, Harvard
and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
It was Harvard president
Charles W. Eliot who finally set
tled their minds on building a uni
versity. He told them it should
not be attempted with an endow
ment smaller than $3 million.
After an appreciable interval,
Stanford said with a smile, "Well,
Jane, we could manage that,
couldn't we?" And Mrs. Stanford
nodded.
Monument to Son
Eliot felt that Stanford not only
wanted to build a monument to
his dead son but also do some
thing which would interest his
wife for the rest of her life and
give her solid satisfaction. He be
lieved that the latter was strong
est in him.
Now that the decision was
made, many things had to be
done. The first necessity was ac
complished on Stanford's 61st
birthday, March 9, 1885. On this
date the governor of California
signed a statute known as the En
dowment Act which authorized
the founding of institutions on
trust funds such as Stanford had
in mind.
Founded Nov. 11, 1885
The grant of endowment estab
lishing the University, providing
its endowment, defining its scope
and organizations, and naming its
trustees and formulating their
powers and duties was executed
Nov. 11, ISBS. Three days later
the trustees named in the grant
gathered at the San Francisco
home of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford and received the deed of trust
in a simple ceremony.
Two provisions of the charter
were unique and exceptional: (1)
the reservation of the grantors,
during their lives or the life of
either of them, of the right to
alter, amend or modify the terms
and conditions of the grant in re
spect to the nature, object and
purposes of the institution and
the powers and duties of the trus
tees, and (2) the reservation to
the grantors, during their lives, i
of the right to exercise all the j
functions, powers and duties of
the trustees.
Frederick Law Olmsted was se- I

lected as landscape architect. In
1886 the part of the Palo Alto
farm where young Leland Jr. had
liked to roam on horseback was
chosen as the site for the Univer
sity.
Apparently it was Olmsted who
proposed the quadrangular ar
rangement with the connecting
arcades. He recommended six one
story structures in three standard
sizes to accommodate the first 600
students. His plan provided for
erection of a second system of
buildings should the institution's
growth demand it.
Beautiful Architecture
Charles Allerton Coolidge of
Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge was
given the task of drawing the ac
tual plans. The result we see each
day.
President White of Cornell, a
devoted student of architecture,
called the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architec
ture in America. It was the first
atlempt anywhere to adapt mis
sion architecture — the natural
outgrowth of the Moorish and
Romanesque to educational use.
The buildings constructed by
Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge, and
with which the University opened,
were those of Inner Quad (except
the church), Encina Hall and the
three small engineering buildings.
May 14, 1887. was a momentous
day for Mr. and Mrs. Stanford.
This was the day chosen for the
ceremony of the laying of the
cornerstone of the monument for
their son—the day on which this
son would have been 19. Con
struction began within a month.
