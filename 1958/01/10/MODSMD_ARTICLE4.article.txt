# Top-Level Meet Asked By Bulganin
## Note to Eisenhower, 19 Leaders Follows 'Union' Message 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I*) - Soviet
Premier Nikolai Bulganin under
took to steal President Eisenhow
er's State of the Union thunder
yesterday by sending the Presi
dent a massive 38-page message
calling for an East-West summit
conference to discuss major
world issues.
The note to the President was
one of 19 delivered to Atlantic
Treaty and Warsaw Pact coun
tries by Soviet ambassadors im
mediately after the President
completed his State of the Union
message to Congress.
Diplomatic Offensive
This broadscale diplomatic of
fensive was announced by Mos
cow Radio and suggested that
Bulganin was asking a top level
conference of at least 20 nations.
The carefully timed maneuver
demonstrated the kind of fast po
litical-propaganda footwork by
the Soviet government which
many of America's allies wish the
United States would show on oc
casion. European leaders have
been critical of what they con
ceive to be a lack of boldness and
imagination in U.S. tactics in
dealing with Russia.
Policy Viewed
It appeared certain that the
foreign policy aspects of Eisen
hower's State of the Union mes
sage to Congress yesterday
would be read abroad from this
point of view.
The impression among diplo
mats here was that while the
President outlined a solid pro
gram of allied co-operation and
strongly emphasized his dedica
tion to the goal of a disarmament
agreement with the Soviet Un
ion. he advanced no bold or imagi
natively new idea.
