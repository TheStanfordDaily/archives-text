# Harpsichord Recital by Prof. Aldrich
## Baroque Composers Featured in Concert By Music Professor 
### Terry Rentz 
A receptive, near-capacity audi
ence in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday afternoon brought Put
nam Aldrich hack for two en
cores at his harpsichord recital
of Baroque music.
Aldrich, professor of music at
Stanford, has performed with the
San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra and is well known for his abil
ity to play the harpsichord, an in
strument which is gradually be
coming rarely played.
Aldrich was received so well
that, after the conclusion of his
recital, he played a lullaby and
another selection by the French
composer Couperin.
His performance was generally
vibrant and yet quietly contem
plative, and gave ample evidence
of his refined technical skill.
The Baroque period, which ex
tended from about 1580 to 17.10,
was characterized by a preocupa
tion with the abstract and univer
sal qualities of music. Perhaps
the most famous composer of
this period was Johann Sebastian
Bach.
Kccitul Conclusion
Aldrich concluded his recital
with the Concerto in the Italian
Style, by that composer.
Among the other selections
played by Aldrich were Cha
conne, by Chambonnieres; Varia
tions on "Est-ce Mars?" by Swce
linck; the suite "Uranie," by Jo
hann Fischer; and Sonata in C
Major, by Pergolesi. Chambon
nieres, court musician to Louis
XIV at Versailles, was the found
er of the school of composers for
the harpsichord. He established
the French style of keyboard mu
sic, which was imitated by Fisch
er, Bach and other German com
posers, especially in their key
board suites.
The chaconne was derived from
a circle dance in which each coup
le in turn left the circle and
danced a duo in the center. This
pattern is reflected in the music
by a recurring refrain that alter
nates with an indefinite number
of "couplets."
Sweelinck, of Amsterdam, was
the chief exponent of the new
style of keyboard composition
that emerged in northern Europe
about a century before the birth
of Bach. \
French Song
The French song beginning
"Est-ce Mars ou est-ce Venus que
je vois?" (Is it Mars or is it Venus
that I see?) was presumably so
familiar to his public that he did
not bother to set it forth exactly
as it was sung. There are actu
ally eight variations in the com
position, but some of them are so
closely merged that it is hard to
tell where one ends and the next
begins.
Pergolesi is best known as the
composer of comic operas such as
"La Serva Padrona." Even in his
compositions for instruments, the
spirit of the opera buffa is pres
ent in the liveliness and humor of
the music. In the C Major So
nata. short phrases are bandied
about among the various regis
ters of the harpsichord like frag
ments of a dialogue.
