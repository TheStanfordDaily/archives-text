# Scholarship to Japan Offered
## 
### 
Keio University in Tokyo, Ja
pan, offers its second annual
scholarship to promote Japanese-
American cultural exchange.
The scholarship consists of a
year's room, board and inciden
tals at Keio and an invitation to
attend the International Student
Conference in Japan with all ex
penses paid as a representative of
the United States. The conference
begins in mid-July, lasts two
weeks and will provide a chance
to travel through Japan and meet
Japanese and other Asian stu
dents.
Only students who have stud
ied Japanese at least one year are
eligible. The scholar must supply
his own transportation to and
from Japan and plan to return to
Stanford after one year. He will
be expected to spend most of his
time furthering cultural ex
change rather than in academic
pursuits.
Byron Marshall, who is at Keio
this year, received the first schol
arship. His letters describe his
life there as being exciting with
discussions, social gatherings,
and being entertained in private
homes.
Application blanks for the
award are available in the ASSU
office. The deadline for applica
tion is Jan. 17. and interviews will
be held on that day. For further
information, students may con
tact Jim Bowditch at PA 6-0194
