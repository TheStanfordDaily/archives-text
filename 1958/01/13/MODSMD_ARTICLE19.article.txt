# Ike's Message Opens Door to Summit Talks
## Presidential Message to Bulganin Rejects Prior Russian Proposals 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —President Eisenhower told Soviet Premier
Nikolai Bulganin in a personal message yesterday that "I am ready"
to attend an East-West summit conference on condition that it is
carefully prepared and shows "good hope" of promoting world
peace.
At the same time Eisenhower proposed to the Soviet Premier :i

sweeping series of agreements at
this "decisive moment in history"
to renounce outer space warfare,
abandon use of the veto in the
United Nations over peaceful set
tlement of disputes, and call off
nuclear weapons tests "indefinite
ly" under a program to stop mak
ing nuclear weapons.
President Rejects
But the President rejected by
clear implication Bulganin's re
cent call for a summit conference
by early April. And he brushed
aside as unnecessary or inade
quate half a dozen recent Bui*
ganin proposals including an East
West nonaggression pact, an
agreement not to use force in the
Middle East, and creation of a
zone free of nuclear weapons in
West Germany and central Eu
rope.
Moscow Told
The President set forth his
views and proposals in a 4,000-
word message which ambassador
Llewellyn Thompson delivered 1o
the Soviet Foreign Office in Mos
cow late yesterday.
To diplomats it appeared that,
in spite of the obvious deadlock
on how a summit conference
should be arranged and the Eisen
ho we r • Bulganin stalemate on
great basic issues, the President's
letter advanced the prospects for
a summit meeting, possibly some
time later this year.
Meanwhile in London, there was
growing support in Britain's press
and from some of its political
leaders for a summit conference
with the Russians.
Gaitskell
Labor party leader Hugh Gaits
kell said, "Support for the con
ference does not mean that we
must sign on the dotted line to
everything the Russians have pro
posed, but surely we can agree to
discuss their proposals."
The Conservative Sunday Dis
patch splashed a story from its
correspondent in the United States
saying Secretary of State Dulles
has backed down, and predicting
President Eisenhower will send
Bulganin a message holding open
the door for a new summit con
ference. This the President did.
Found Wanting
However, President Eisenhow
er's reply to Moscow's summit
meeting proposal was weighed
and found wanting by much of
the British press today.
"There was no answering chal
lenge. No inspiration," com
plained the conservative Daily
Mail.
The Laborite Daily Herald as
serted that U.S. Secretary of
State Dulles, "with his eternal
'no, no, no,' is becoming as great
a menace to peace as was Mr. Mo
lotov in the first years after the
war."
The independent Daily Express
said the British public "will not
be satisfied by declarations that
the Russians must first of all
demonstrate a sincere desire for
peace."
"The Russians have said over
and over again that peace is. in
fact, their desire," the Express
commented. "That repeated as
sertion should be taken at its
face value until new facts prove
it false."

agreement not to use force in the
Middle East, and creation of a
zone free of nuclear weapons in
West Germany and central Eu
rope.
Moscow Told
The President set forth his
views and proposals in a 4,000-
word message which ambassador
Llewellyn Thompson delivered 1o
the Soviet Foreign Office in Mos
cow late yesterday.
To diplomats it appeared that,
in spite of the obvious deadlock
on how a summit conference
should be arranged and the Eisen
ho we r • Bulganin stalemate on
great basic issues, the President's
letter advanced the prospects for
a summit meeting, possibly some
time later this year.
Meanwhile in London, there was
growing support in Britain's press
and from some of its political
leaders for a summit conference
with the Russians.
Gaitskell
Labor party leader Hugh Gaits
kell said, "Support for the con
ference does not mean that we
must sign on the dotted line to
everything the Russians have pro
posed, but surely we can agree to
discuss their proposals."
The Conservative Sunday Dis
patch splashed a story from its
correspondent in the United States
saying Secretary of State Dulles
has backed down, and predicting
President Eisenhower will send
Bulganin a message holding open
the door for a new summit con
ference. This the President did.
Found Wanting
However, President Eisenhow
er's reply to Moscow's summit
meeting proposal was weighed
and found wanting by much of
the British press today.
"There was no answering chal
lenge. No inspiration," com
plained the conservative Daily
Mail.
The Laborite Daily Herald as
serted that U.S. Secretary of
State Dulles, "with his eternal
'no, no, no,' is becoming as great
a menace to peace as was Mr. Mo
lotov in the first years after the
war."
The independent Daily Express
said the British public "will not
be satisfied by declarations that
the Russians must first of all
demonstrate a sincere desire for
peace."
"The Russians have said over
and over again that peace is. in
fact, their desire," the Express
commented. "That repeated as
sertion should be taken at its
face value until new facts prove
it false."
WASHINGTON (/P) —President Eisenhower told Soviet Premier
Nikolai Bulganin in a personal message yesterday that "I am ready"
to attend an East-West summit conference on condition that it is
carefully prepared and shows "good hope" of promoting world
peace.
At the same time Eisenhower proposed to the Soviet Premier :i

sweeping series of agreements at
this "decisive moment in history"
to renounce outer space warfare,
abandon use of the veto in the
United Nations over peaceful set
tlement of disputes, and call off
nuclear weapons tests "indefinite
ly" under a program to stop mak
ing nuclear weapons.
President Rejects
But the President rejected by
clear implication Bulganin's re
cent call for a summit conference
by early April. And he brushed
