# Weapons Will Take Priority In Spending
## Army, Navy Demands For Funds Precede Budget to Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 1 ) Strong
Army and Navy demands for
hundreds of millions of extra dol
lars for advanced weapons faced
senators even before President
Eisenhower's budget requests
reached Congress.
The President's budget mes
sage will be presented to Con
gress today. It is expected to
call for spending about $74 bil
lion in the fiscal year that begins
next July 1. Of this amount, de
fense outlays are expected to ap
proach $40 billion.
However, some top officers are
demanding hundreds of millions
of extra dollars for Army missiles
and Navy nuclear submarines.
Witnesses
These calls came in closed-door
testimony that has been released
by the Senate Preparedness Sub
committee. The witnesses were
Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin, Army
research director who is retiring,
and Rear Adm. Hyman G. Rick
over, Navy nuclear expert.
Gavin told senators he "misled
Congress" last year by support
ing a request for $372 million for
Army research and development,
lie said he really needed nearly
$200 million more.
Rickover, credited with devel
oping the world's first successful
atomic submarine for the Navy,
testified that 19 nuclear undersea
craft now operating or author
ized are not enough.
Soviet Strength
Also in Washington, Represen
tative Joseph W. Martin Jr. (PL-
Mass.) said yesterday that "Amer
ica today is stronger than the So
viets in the missile field."
He spoke "as one who has had
information available that would
make me make this statement."
In a television interview filmed
wit h Representative Keating ( R-
N.Y.), for upstate New York sta
tions. Martin said the reason the
Russians were able to launch an
earth satellite first was "because
they stole the secrets from the
United States that gave them
that advantage."
Martin did not elaborate on
this. Charges have been made
that the Rosenberg atom spy ring
gave U.S. space secrets to Russia
in 1947-48. Julius and Ethel Ro
senberg were executed on espio
nage charges in 1953.
Martin branded as probably po
litically inspired the allegations
that the Eisenhower administra
tion lacks a sense of urgency in
the cold war.
