# California Political Scene
## 
### 
California Democrats have endorsed their
candidates for high offices in the elections
which will he held this year.
Perhaps it is a little early to comment spe
cifically upon the choices the Fresno conven
tion of Democratic clubs made, but the en
dorsed candidates are certainly no strangers
to the political scene in California.
The choice of Edmund C. I Pat I Brown as
the party's candidate for governor is no sur
prise. He was unopposed. Even at this stage
we anticipate a rugged and determined battle
for the governor's chair in November. There
is no doubt that it will not he a runaway for
the Republican candidate.
Senator William E. Knowland is the front
running candidate for the Republicans. Having
removed his strongest opponent, present in
cumhcnt Coodwin J. Knight, through behiild-
I lie-scenes political inaneuverings, the senior
U.S. senator from California should not have
any trouble heading his party's ticket in No
\ ember.
Therefore, it seems it will be pretty much
a choice between Brown and Knowland. The
interesting aspect of this race is that for the

fir.-t lime since the 19-42 race between Cuthbert
Olsen and Karl Warren tin* election will even
be close. More interesting than that is the pros
pect of a Democrat winning the governorship
for the first time since 1938.
Hut Brown can do it. Even as well known as
Knowland is in California, he does not have
the personal popularity of Brown. He is even
radically disliked h\ many Californians and
by many from his own party since Knight was
forced out of the race for governor.
It will be rather nice to look forward to a
Democratic governor. We rather liked the
\\ arren regime and we indulgently tolerated
the Knight regime, but we look with horror
upon the prospect of a Knowland regime. How
ever much personal integrit\ Knowland may
have, and this we dispute not at all. his ideas,
his plans, his congressional record none of
these things endear him to us. Instead, we are
appalled by them.
We extend to Pat Brown and to Congressman
('.lair Engle, winner of the Democratic endorse
ment for U.S. senator, the best of luck in their
coming campaigns. \\ know they will live up
to the best traditions of the Democratic party.

to the political scene in California.
The choice of Edmund C. I Pat I Brown as
the party's candidate for governor is no sur
prise. He was unopposed. Even at this stage
we anticipate a rugged and determined battle
for the governor's chair in November. There
is no doubt that it will not he a runaway for
the Republican candidate.
Senator William E. Knowland is the front
running candidate for the Republicans. Having
removed his strongest opponent, present in
cumhcnt Coodwin J. Knight, through behiild-
I lie-scenes political inaneuverings, the senior
U.S. senator from California should not have
any trouble heading his party's ticket in No
\ ember.
Therefore, it seems it will be pretty much
a choice between Brown and Knowland. The
interesting aspect of this race is that for the

fir.-t lime since the 19-42 race between Cuthbert
Olsen and Karl Warren tin* election will even
be close. More interesting than that is the pros
pect of a Democrat winning the governorship
for the first time since 1938.
Hut Brown can do it. Even as well known as
Knowland is in California, he does not have
the personal popularity of Brown. He is even
radically disliked h\ many Californians and
by many from his own party since Knight was
forced out of the race for governor.
It will be rather nice to look forward to a
Democratic governor. We rather liked the
\\ arren regime and we indulgently tolerated
the Knight regime, but we look with horror
upon the prospect of a Knowland regime. How
ever much personal integrit\ Knowland may
have, and this we dispute not at all. his ideas,
his plans, his congressional record none of
these things endear him to us. Instead, we are
appalled by them.
We extend to Pat Brown and to Congressman
('.lair Engle, winner of the Democratic endorse
ment for U.S. senator, the best of luck in their
coming campaigns. \\ know they will live up
to the best traditions of the Democratic party.
California Democrats have endorsed their
candidates for high offices in the elections
which will he held this year.
Perhaps it is a little early to comment spe
cifically upon the choices the Fresno conven
tion of Democratic clubs made, but the en
dorsed candidates are certainly no strangers
to the political scene in California.
