# THIS WEEK ON QUAD—By Dave Quarles
## More Important Diversions 
### 
Now that the novelty of going to class, books,
etc. has worn off, it's time to turn our attention
to more important diversions. This week the ad
ministration has really outdone itself in provid
ing exotic entertainment for the discriminating,

Just what do faculty women do in their many
hours of leisure? Don't miss the answer to this
question and other lurid details in a daring ex
pose presented by the Faculty Women's Club en
titled "Hobby Show." The "Show" goes on the
road at 2 p.m. today in the upper lounge, Wom
en's Clubhouse.
The faculty women may have interesting hob
bies, but they can't compare with what our grad
students learn in their spare time. Louis C.
Pakiser, graduate student, will spin yarns about
"Caldera like Stuctures in Mono Basin and Long
Valley, California" and other tales at 4 p.m.
today in Room 320, Geology Corner. Don't miss
this session.
All neurotics (this means YOIJ) can get the
low-down from T. H. Bullock of UCLA at 4:115
p.m. in Room 430, Jordan Hall, when he dis
cusses "The Integrative Action of the Nervous
System at the Neuronal Level." Students, fac
ulty and visitors welcome tea and miltowns dis
pensed at the door.
"Europe The Emerging Third Power: Phe
nomenon and Portent" will be unraveled by Karl
Brandt, associate director, Food Research Insti
tute, on The Tuesday Evening Series. This por
tentously esoteric phenomenon will become crys
tally exoteric when Brandt takes the stage at
7:30 in Mem And.
In answer to pleas from Messerschmitt and
Volkswagen owners with curvature of the spine,
S. D. Drell of the Physics Dept. has agreed to
solve all problems when he discusses "Quantum
Electrodynamics at Small Distances" in Room
Mil, physics lecture hall. We understand that the
general gist of the talk is that if your quantity
of quanta is too large you need a bigger convey
ance. Details at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
Double-header attraction at the Research Club
of SU's meeting at 8 p.m. Wednesday in Bowman

Alumni House. Malcolm Goldstein will discuss
"Lynn Riggs, American Playwright" while Leon
ard F. Fuller will fascinate with "Radio Engi
neering before the Vacuum Tube." Couldn't have
picked a better combination ourselves.

Sometimes we wonder if the Math Department
isn't made up of a bunch of jokers. This time
they claim that Newton S. Hawley will elaborate
on "Some Topics in the Theory of Riemann Sur
faces." We recommend all readers to go to Room
104, "Sequoial" Hall, Thursday at 3:15 p.m. and
see if the department isn't pulling our leg.
The Chem Dept., however, doesn't fool around.
They have really penetrated the basic underlying
problem of modern civilization, and Henry Wise
of the Stanford Research Institute will suggest
a solution to this problem when he presents
"Droplet Combustion" in Room 20, Chemistry
Building, at 4:15 p.m.
Film Series will present "Orpheus, 1949" (a re
make of the Greek version I at 7:30 p.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium.

The faculty is planning a bash at 8:30 p.m.
Friday in the upper lounge, Women's Clubhouse.
Sorry, "Faculty, staff and guests (ONLYi are
welcome."
For six bits you can hear Daniel Schorr, CBS
correspondent in Moscow, speak Saturday on
"Can Russia Hold Her Satellites?" Our candid
opinion is no, she does too good a job throwing
them around in the air. At any rate, tickets for
the 7:30 p.m. lecture in Dink Aud can be pur
chased for 75 cents (roughly three rubles) at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium box office.

A chamber music concert, prepared by Sandor
Salgo, will bo presented by the Music Dept. at
4 p.m. Sunday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
public is invited.
Last week it was JAYNE for the boys. This
week the girls can learn \tho dubious details of
"The Bachelor Party." Added attraction: two
cartoons. Twenty cents, 7:30, Mem Aud.

Sorry, "Faculty, staff and guests (ONLYi are

For six bits you can hear Daniel Schorr, CBS
correspondent in Moscow, speak Saturday on
"Can Russia Hold Her Satellites?" Our candid
opinion is no, she does too good a job throwing
them around in the air. At any rate, tickets for
the 7:30 p.m. lecture in Dink Aud can be pur
chased for 75 cents (roughly three rubles) at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium box office.

"The Bachelor Party." Added attraction: two
cartoons. Twenty cents, 7:30, Mem Aud.
Now that the novelty of going to class, books,

Just what do faculty women do in their many
hours of leisure? Don't miss the answer to this
question and other lurid details in a daring ex
pose presented by the Faculty Women's Club en
titled "Hobby Show." The "Show" goes on the
road at 2 p.m. today in the upper lounge, Wom
en's Clubhouse.
The faculty women may have interesting hob
bies, but they can't compare with what our grad
students learn in their spare time. Louis C.
Pakiser, graduate student, will spin yarns about
"Caldera like Stuctures in Mono Basin and Long
Valley, California" and other tales at 4 p.m.
today in Room 320, Geology Corner. Don't miss
this session.
All neurotics (this means YOIJ) can get the
low-down from T. H. Bullock of UCLA at 4:115
p.m. in Room 430, Jordan Hall, when he dis
cusses "The Integrative Action of the Nervous
System at the Neuronal Level." Students, fac
ulty and visitors welcome tea and miltowns dis
pensed at the door.
"Europe The Emerging Third Power: Phe
nomenon and Portent" will be unraveled by Karl
Brandt, associate director, Food Research Insti
tute, on The Tuesday Evening Series. This por
tentously esoteric phenomenon will become crys
tally exoteric when Brandt takes the stage at
7:30 in Mem And.
In answer to pleas from Messerschmitt and
Volkswagen owners with curvature of the spine,
S. D. Drell of the Physics Dept. has agreed to
solve all problems when he discusses "Quantum
Electrodynamics at Small Distances" in Room
Mil, physics lecture hall. We understand that the
general gist of the talk is that if your quantity
of quanta is too large you need a bigger convey
ance. Details at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
Double-header attraction at the Research Club
of SU's meeting at 8 p.m. Wednesday in Bowman

Alumni House. Malcolm Goldstein will discuss
"Lynn Riggs, American Playwright" while Leon
ard F. Fuller will fascinate with "Radio Engi
neering before the Vacuum Tube." Couldn't have
picked a better combination ourselves.

Sometimes we wonder if the Math Department
isn't made up of a bunch of jokers. This time
they claim that Newton S. Hawley will elaborate
on "Some Topics in the Theory of Riemann Sur
faces." We recommend all readers to go to Room
104, "Sequoial" Hall, Thursday at 3:15 p.m. and
see if the department isn't pulling our leg.
The Chem Dept., however, doesn't fool around.
They have really penetrated the basic underlying
problem of modern civilization, and Henry Wise
of the Stanford Research Institute will suggest
a solution to this problem when he presents
"Droplet Combustion" in Room 20, Chemistry
Building, at 4:15 p.m.
Film Series will present "Orpheus, 1949" (a re
make of the Greek version I at 7:30 p.m. in Cub
