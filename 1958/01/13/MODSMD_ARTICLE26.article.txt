Opening the winter quarter se
ries of political discussions, (he
Political Union will host J. Brack
en Lee, former governor of Utah
and chairman of "For America,"
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium.
Lee, first elected governor of
Utah on the Republican ticket in
1948, was re-elected in 1952. The
1948 election broke a 24-year grip
that Democrats had held on the
gubernatorial position.
Lee campaigned on a pledge of
instituting honesty, efficiency
and economy in government, and
after his election proceeded to in
stitute a clean - up campaign in
the state.
Most Efficient
On Feb. 18, 1955, the Deseret
News-Telegram of Salt Lake City
said: ". . . no governor of recent
memory has operated the state
house more efficiently or more
openly for public inspection.

There has been no breath of scan
dal in any state department in his
two terms."
However, Lee created a contro
versy when he refused to pay in
come tax and subsequently be
came chairman of "For America,"
an organization advocating the
repeal of the 16th Amendment.
Lee, a native of Price, Utah,
was born Jan. 7, 1899. He served
in the 21st Infantry of the U.S.
Army in World War 1 and was
honorably discharged as a second
lieutenant in 1919.
Six Terms
After the war he entered the
insurance and real estate busi
ness. 1-Ie served six successive
terms as mayor of Price. He was
a candidate for the House of Rep
resentatives in 1942 but lost by
269 votes. In 1944 he was the
GOP nominee for governor and
was defeated in a court-contested
election by 1056 votes.
One of his sons, James Bracken
Lee, is a graduate student here.
