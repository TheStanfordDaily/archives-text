# Indian Cagers Gain Split With Northwest Invaders
## Cards Outlast Pesky WSC, 58-53; Smart Paces Huskies' 60-54 Win 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
There's still room for more improvement by tho sophomore-laden
Stanford basketballers as they begin preparations today for Satur
day and Monday games against powerful California and Oregon
State. But it was evident that the Cards had picked up a lot during
the past week as they clipped Washington State 58-53 before drop
ping a 60-54 decision to Washington in weekend Pacific Coast Con
ference action in the Stanford Pavilion.
The split brought the Indians' 1958 PCC record to 1-3 and enabled
them to climb from the cellar into a three-way tie for sixth in the
nine-team circuit. Deadlocked with Howie Dallmar's men are the
two guests of Friday and Saturday, the Cougars and Huskies.
The variable factor in the two games was the presence of the
outstanding big man. WSC had no such individual, so the Indians
could grab their full share of rebounds and control to a satisfactory
degree the play in close.
But Washington faced no such lack. They had big Doug Smart,
rated by most as the best player in the conference. And Smart didn't
do anything to damage his reputation. Although playing on a bad

leg that restricted his maneuverability under the basket, Smart was
the big man under the boards.
Dick Haga did a fairly good job of covering Smart but he still
could hook over Haga's outstretched arms, usually with success.
Had he not missed three cripples late in the game, Smart might have
finished play with 25 points instead of the 19 he got.
Indian followers were relieved when Paul Neumann shook his
attack of the flu sufficiently to get into the Saturday game. The
Tribe captain missed the Cougar battle, but came back strong with
1G points against Washington plus a great job under the defensive
boards.
A really bright spot of the weekend play, particularly Friday, was
the performance of the second unit. A nine-point Tribe lead had dis
integrated to just four midway through the second half against WSC
when Dallmar put the new club in. They responded with a rally
that widened the gap to 15 points in six minutes and put the game
on ice.
So now it's on to tougher competition in the next week as the
locals travel to Berkeley Friday night, have Saturday off, and return
to the Pavilion Monday to meet Dave Gambee and company.
