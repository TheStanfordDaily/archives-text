# Second Unit Repels Late Cougar Rally
## 
### 
The early going was tight
against Washington State, but
after Stanford took a 12-10 lead
the Cougars could never again get
hack in the lead.
Four points by Dick Haga and
three by C'hris Burford moved
Howie Dallmar's aggregation into
a 7-' l lead. WSC tied the issue at
10-10 on a close-in shot by center
.John Marias, but a driving lay-up
by Burford put the Indians ahead
for keeps.
John Arrillaga and Burford
each followed up a field goal with
a free throw, and halfway
through the initial period it was
Stanford on top, 18-12.
Lead Lengthens
The gap widened further to 28-
15 on a pair of jump shots by
Doug Warren and two-pointers by
Haga, Burford and Jerry Thuesen.
Jim Ross and Dick Axelson kept
ihe Cougars even the rest of the
first half, but WSC left the floor
on the short end of a 35-24 count.
The second half started like a
funeral procession. Neither club
hit the scoreboard for 2:25, but
finally Warren tanked a jumper
and a 13-point edge. Both clubs
remained cold, and Stanford could
not score for another 4:05, when
Burford scored from the free
throw line.
It was yet another 1:15 before
the next Indian point, but by that
time the Cougars of Jack Friel
had pulled to within seven points
at 39-32.
At Last
Arrillaga broke the field goal
ice for the Stanford."? and kept the
seven - point lead temporarily.
Three more Cougar hits from the
floor against a charity toss and a
field goal by Burford brought the
score to a tight 44-40, with 9:35
left on the scoreboard clock.
At this point Dallmar took the
big chance and inserted his second
unit Mike Tipton, John Pflueger,
Thuesen, Jerry Rose and John
Stahler. It worked.
Tipton hit on a driving hook
from the left and added another
point as he was fouled on the play.
Then he drove in nearly identical
fashion and scored again.
Three for Thuesen
Thuesen scored once each from
the floor and free-throw line, and
if was 52-40. WSC finally got a
lone point off the second-liners,
but it didn't mean anything as
Thuesen and Tipton each sank a
pair of free throws.
The magic wore off a bit in the
remaining three minutes as the
Cougars poured through five
straight field goals in a vain ef
fort to catch up.
A minute remained when Tip
ton drove through for the clinch
er two points and the 58-53 win.
High man for the Cards was the
surprising Burford with 14 points.
Warren had 10.
Early in preseason workouts,
Dallmar had predicted that Bur
ford would crack into the start
ing line-up when he had time to
adjust from football. After see
ing only a moderate amount of
action in previous games, Bur
ford this time stayed in plenty,
and began to realize his potential
with an aggressive performance.
Warren, too, was something of
a surprise as he subbed for the
flu - stricken Neumann, and
pumped through jump shots at
crucial points.
