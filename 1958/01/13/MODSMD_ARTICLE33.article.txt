played Lowell throughout the tilt
and used second- and third-string
players after the intermission.
Layoff Hurts

to the floor after a five-week lay
off and just couldn't seem to
come alive.
Stanford woke up in the sec
ond half with teamwork and ac
curacy, outclassing the tiring
Lincolnites 34-28 by the third
stanza. The final quarter was

even using substitutes, was able
to stretch the margin to 50-36.

rebounds, snagging 42 to the
preps' 23.

Saturday night Stanford looked
like a real ball club. Center Bob
Whclan, 6-10, grabbed rebounds
right and left, and Bowling and

Turner sent in his reserves, Mike

Erlin, Tony Moisio, Steve Rey
nard. Tv Roberts and Mark Sisk,
