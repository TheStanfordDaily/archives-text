# Washington Gets, Keeps Early Lead
## 
### 
If basketball games ran just 10
minutes long, Stanford would own
a victory over Washington. The
Cards were on top of the invaders
throughout the first half of the
first half, then relinquished the
lead for the rest of the game.
Paul Neumann opened the scor-
I ing 45 seconds into the game with
! ;i field goal from the side, and
! then Dick Haga hit from 15 feet
! out for a 4-0 lead. Bill Stady broke
the scoring iee for Tippy Dye's
team at the two-minute mark
with a deuce.
Stanford gained the biggest lead
it was to enjoy as Neumann drove
through for a lay-in, was fouled
on the play and sunk the charity
toss for a 7-2 margin.
Smart Hits
Doug Smart proceeded to score
six of the next nine Washington
points and pulled the Huskies to
within a point of the lead after
9:45 of the first half.
The Indians held off Washing
ton for another minute, but Dick
Crews hit a 23-foot set shot to give
the Northerners the edge, 17-16.
Smart took over again and sand
wiched three field goals around
five Stanford points. Jerry Thue
sen scored on a short jumper to
narrow the gap to 25-27, but
Washington pulled away again to
a 36-29 half-time margin.
A brief Stanford rally centered
around a jump shot by Haga, and
ivvo field goals by substitute Mike
Tipton pulled the Indians to with
in one point at 44-43, and Neu
mann was at the free-throw line
for one shot.
Here Washington took time out,
; and it must have completely calm-
I ed them down. Neumann missed
his shot, the Huskies reeled off
seven straight points, and that
was the game.
Mistakes
Three bad passes by the Cards,
a missed dunk by Brockmeyer and
Tipton's fouling up of a fast break
sealed the Indians' fate. The Hus
j kies were content to play it slow
j the remainder of the way and held
at least a seven-point lead until
Brockmeyer's tip-in registered the
final score of 60-54.
Neumann's 16 points were high
for the Indians, and John Arril-
I laga was second high with 10.

Smart took over again and sand
wiched three field goals around
five Stanford points. Jerry Thue

A brief Stanford rally centered
around a jump shot by Haga, and
ivvo field goals by substitute Mike
Tipton pulled the Indians to with
in one point at 44-43, and Neu
mann was at the free-throw line
for one shot.
Here Washington took time out,
; and it must have completely calm-
I ed them down. Neumann missed
his shot, the Huskies reeled off

was the game.
Mistakes
Three bad passes by the Cards,
a missed dunk by Brockmeyer and
Tipton's fouling up of a fast break
sealed the Indians' fate. The Hus
j kies were content to play it slow
j the remainder of the way and held
at least a seven-point lead until
Brockmeyer's tip-in registered the
final score of 60-54.
Neumann's 16 points were high
for the Indians, and John Arril-
I laga was second high with 10.
If basketball games ran just 10
minutes long, Stanford would own
a victory over Washington. The
Cards were on top of the invaders
throughout the first half of the
first half, then relinquished the
lead for the rest of the game.
Paul Neumann opened the scor-
I ing 45 seconds into the game with
! ;i field goal from the side, and
! then Dick Haga hit from 15 feet
! out for a 4-0 lead. Bill Stady broke
the scoring iee for Tippy Dye's
team at the two-minute mark
with a deuce.
Stanford gained the biggest lead
it was to enjoy as Neumann drove
through for a lay-in, was fouled
on the play and sunk the charity
toss for a 7-2 margin.
