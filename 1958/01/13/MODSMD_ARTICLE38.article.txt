### Camille Petersen 
Five hundred fifty-nine stu
dents were registered at the Uni
versity its first two years . . .
majors were registered in all of
the 19 departments.
Critics complained about the
academic standards of the institu
tion. saying that those who could
not get into the state university
went to Stanford.
Two years later, 1893, the story
goes that a young Harvard jun
ior inquired about attending
Stanford. He had never been out
of N'cw England and thought get
ling away might be advantageous
to him.
"Go West"
"When he mentioned this idea
to one of his professors the reply
was 'Well, the institution has no
past and is not likely to have a
future.' But when he went to
Harvard's Dean Briggs, the latter
jumped right out of his chair.
Go,' he said. 'Go by all means—
.ven if you have to walk!' "
The Tuesday Series had its be
ginning with the University. It
was called t ho Tuesday Evening
Lectures and was put on by the
staff. It died out in 1902 but was
restored later under the presi
dency of Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Morning Chapel
Voluntary morning chapel serv
ices and regular Sunday services
were established at the begin
ning. The latter began Oct. 4,
1891, with the Rev. Robert Mac
kenzie of San Francisco as
preacher. The present Memorial
Church was completed in 1903.
One of the most important ac

quisitions during the first year
was the Hopkins Seaside Labora
tory, the present Hopkins Marine
Laboratory, at Pacific Grove.
The Post Office also made an
early appearance on the Stanford
campus. It was first established
in May 1593, in a small wooden
building on the site of the future
Memorial Church. In 1900 the
Past Office moved into its new
building on Lasuen Street where
it is today.
Construction of the Outer
Quadrangle was expected to be
gin in 1893, but the sudden death
of Senator Stanford on June 21,
1893, caused curtailment, of ex
pansion. One of the first build
ings to be erected after the finan
cial difficulties were passed in
1898 was the chemistry building.
Class buildings were not the
only ones under construction
about the turn of the century.
After 1900 the hills behind the
campus became dotted with fac
ulty homes.
