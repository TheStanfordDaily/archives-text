### 
FRESNO (/P) —California Democrats yesterday wound up endorse
ment of candidates in the state's June 3 primary after censuring all
state legislators who voted against outlawing racial discrimination
in employment.
Delegates to the California Democratic Council also denounced

"right • to - work" legislation and
the labor policy of Senator Wil
lim F. Knowland (R-Calif.), can
didate for the Republican guber
natorial nomination. In addition,
they approved a watered-down
resolution favoring trade with
Red China.
Concluding a 1hrce-day, pre
primary endorsing convention,
the council approved Bert A.
Betts, San Diego accountant, for
the party's nomination for state
treasurer and Henry Lopez, Los
Angeles attorney, for the secre
tary of state nomination.
Endorsements voted earlier by
the council were: for governor,
Attorney General Edmund G.
Brown; for U.S. senator, Repre
sentative Clair Engle of Red
Bluff; for attorney general, Su

Censure Discrimination
The censure move over racial
discrimination came early yester
day in the adoption of a platform
when some 1700 delegates were
asked to approve a civil rights
resolution endorsing fair employ
ment practices legislation.
FEP advocates, demanding
stronger language, submitted an
amendment to condemn and cen
sure each assemblyman and sena
tor, Democrat and Republican
alike, who did not support FEP
in the last session of the Legis
lature.
The amendment won easily on
a voice vote.
Knowland Hit
Another resolution, one of 10
platform planks adopted, assailed
"right - to - work" legislation to
outlaw the union shop and Know
land's stand on labor.
Knowland has said he would
sign a "fair and equitable" right
to-work bill if he were elected
and the Legislature sent one to
him.
The carefully worded Red
China resolution, designed to pac
ify delegates who favor a firm
stand for trade with the Chinese
Communists, called for opening
of "channels of communication
and trade" with Asia, including
mainland China.
Resolutions
Other resolutions urged:
That the United States take the
lead in international talks to re
lax the cold war and to bring
about "disarmament" adequately
monitored, including as a first
step the cessation of nuclear test
ing.
Federal and state aid to educa
tion.
A solution to the stale's north
south water rights dispute.
A national health insurance
program, but "not of socialized
medicine."

ment of candidates in the state's June 3 primary after censuring all

in employment.
Delegates to the California Democratic Council also denounced

"right • to - work" legislation and

Censure Discrimination
The censure move over racial
discrimination came early yester
day in the adoption of a platform
when some 1700 delegates were
asked to approve a civil rights
resolution endorsing fair employ
ment practices legislation.
FEP advocates, demanding
stronger language, submitted an
amendment to condemn and cen
sure each assemblyman and sena
tor, Democrat and Republican
alike, who did not support FEP
in the last session of the Legis
lature.
The amendment won easily on
a voice vote.
Knowland Hit
Another resolution, one of 10
platform planks adopted, assailed
"right - to - work" legislation to
outlaw the union shop and Know
land's stand on labor.
Knowland has said he would
sign a "fair and equitable" right
to-work bill if he were elected
and the Legislature sent one to
him.
The carefully worded Red
China resolution, designed to pac
ify delegates who favor a firm
stand for trade with the Chinese
Communists, called for opening

and trade" with Asia, including
mainland China.
