# Discussions To Examine U.S. Policies
## Roy Kepler Will Lead First Seminar Group; Two Others to Follow 
### Marilyn Moore 
Tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse is the first
meeting of a new seminar under
the guidance of Roy Kepler, own
er of Kepler's Books & Magazines
store. Topic of the seminar, which
will continue on Jan. 20 and 27,
is "Alternatives to Contemporary
American Foreign Policy."
This group will use as a basis
the pamphlet published by the
American Friends Service Socie
ty entitled "Speak Truth to Pow
er." "This pamphlet features a
proposal to change our foreign
policy to a nonviolent one/," says
Kepler. "We will discuss if this
idea is plausible and the possibili
ties of it."
A second seminar with the same
topic will begin this Thursday eve
ning, also at the Women's Club
house at 8 p.m and will also run
for three consecutive weeks. Lead
er of the group will be professor
Mulford Sibley of the Political
Science department. This group
will present a "critical examina
tion of contemporary politics in
the light of some fundamental
problems of peace," according to
Professor Sibley.
"The Economic Development of
Underdeveloped Countries" is the
topic of a third seminar, also to
begin this Thursday in the club
house. Dr. Eugene Staley, chief
economist of the Stanford Re
search Institute, will lead it.
"As the title indicates, we will
be discussing the situation of un
derdeveloped countries, a group
ing which includes more than two
thirds of the world's population.
These countries, mainly located in
Asia, Africa and Latin America,
are now showing a very different
attitude from that of previous
decades. Our group will discuss
this awakening—this 'revolution
of rising expectations' — and its
implications for the future of the
people of the United States also,"
says Dr. Staley.
