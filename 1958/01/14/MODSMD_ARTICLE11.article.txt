tage Fund is under the leadership
of Buzz McCoy and will be as
sisted by James S. Triolo and
Jack Shepherd.
$12,500 Goal
The solicitors have set $12,500
as their goal.
Prospective donors are mer
chants in the Palo Alto area who
recognize the need for the kind
of leaders the Fund is expected to
help and who will also appreciate
the prestige of contributing to the
project. Shepherd said.
Recipients of the scholarships
will be able to personally thank
the donors of their scholarships,
which will be grants-in-aid based
on personal contact, he said.
The first meeting of this year's
