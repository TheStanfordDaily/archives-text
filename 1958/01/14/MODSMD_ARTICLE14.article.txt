# INCOME TAX IS TOPIC
## J. Bracken Lee Will Speak Before Poli Union Tomorrow 
### 
"The income tax is making us a dishonest people. Will we repeat
the mistakes of France?"
So said J. Bracken Lee, chairman of "For America"and former
governor of Utah, in an article in Human Events, Oct. 19, 1957.
Lee, who will speak tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley Audito-

rium in the first Political Union
meeting of winter quarter, is ad
vocating the repeal of the income
tax amendment (the Sixteenth)
to the Constitution.
In his Human Events article,
Lee pointed out that "Among
modern Western nations, France
has become a symbol of instabil
ity, insolvency and corruption.
An analysis of the troubles that
beset this once-proud land should
serve as a warning to all Ameri
cans: for il demonstrates clearly
that the U.S. is going down the
same road that France has trav
eled."
French Fate
Lee claims the demoralization
of French politics and asks, "Is
the United Stales headed for the
same kind of demoralization that
has afflicted France?"
The former governor blames
big spending and big taxes as the
causes for this demoralization,
pointing to examples of tax-dodg
ing.
The basic element of the suc
cess of the American form of
government has been limited gov
ernment. Lee adds, and limited
government is possible only
when there is a constitutional
inviolable limitation upon the
amount of money the govern
ment can take from the people.
Advocates Repeal
It is on this basis lhat Lee and j
the organization which he rep
resents, For America, are advo
cating the repeal of the Sixteenth
Amendment. He favors a com
plete repeal of the tax law and
continues:
"This measure, if enacted into
law by the insistence of Ameri
cans opposed to national dishon
esty, would go far to alter our
present course for the hot let'. (If
(he federal government should
ever need greater revenues than
can lie provided by federal taxes,
Congress can be given the power
to require the states to make up i
the, deficit lhe* allocation to be
made in proportion to per capita
income.)"
