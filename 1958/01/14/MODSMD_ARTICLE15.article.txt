# Grant Awarded Stanford for Polio Research
## 
### 
The March of Dimes has award
ed Stanford University a $42,613
grant for research studies on the
structure of polio viruses.
Carlton E. Sehwerdt, associate
professor of medical microbiology,
is to direct the research project,
which will try to determine how
the virus produces more of its
kind, in addition to analyzing the
virus structure.
The research procedure calls
for the culturing of the virus in
living ceils where they live and
reproduce. The cells are ruptured
at intervals during their growth
to check on their progress.
Dr. Sehwerdt then plans to iso
late the mature virus particles,
plus any other particles, purify
them and make them into a con
centrate. The particles are ana
lyzed in the attempt to obtain
clues as to their structure and
growth.
