# Women's Regulations
## 
### 
Thk i.ETTF.R in the column below entitled "1(1
I.ale Minutps" points up a situation that is
indeed perplexing to Stanford males.
The whole rigamarole of women's housing
and social regulations is as mystifying to men
as Kinstein's theory of relativity is to the av
erage Australian aborigine. The truth of the
matter is that we see 110 sense to the system,
no valid reason for its existence.
\ et to the average female there is nothing
strange about the regulations. Their purpose
is ver\ clear-cut and the reasoning behind the
system is verv logical. After all, it was con
ceived bv female minds.
We have often given much thought to the
women's regulations. But by 110 stretch of the
imagination could we justify them. Perhaps
our mistake is comparing women's regulations
to men's. After all, are we not social equals,
men and women? The women themselves do
not seem to think so; tlie\ are the ones who
have regulated themselves. They certainly can't
blame this on men.
Be that as it may, the system exists, and. once
instituted, it is meant to be followed. Perhaps
it is better for a freshman woman to arrive

after lockout time on the first night of tin*
quarter than to stay in a motel. We males
might lliink so. But obviousk the women who
wrote the regulations did not.
There are many inequalities between men
and women on campus. Men who live in dor
mitories have their sheets, pillowcases and
towels supplied by the University and laun
dered free of charge. But Stanford undergrad
uate women have to supply these things them
selves and have to see to their laundering also,
a great added expense. This is probably the
fault of the University administration and not
of the women themselves. But certainly the
women should protest this unequal treatment.
\lÂ»>n can also store things like bicycles, boxes
and bedding over the summer on University
propertv. Not so women.
These are but a few examples of the differ
ences between men and women on the Stanford
campus. Perhaps it would be best for us males
to remember that women's regulations are
desired bv women, and it is not our place to
question whv a woman wants what she wants.
Women were created to want things, and men
were created to supplv them.
