10 Late Minutes
Editor. The Daily:
The women's dormitory regulations have long
perplexed me, but I recently discovered the most
asinine of all. On Jan. 5, I drove 600 miles with
three of my friends. If it had not been for two
unexpected delays ridiculously slow restaurant
service and over a hundred miles of inland fog
we would have arrived here shortly after 10.
When I realized that we would be late, I had
one of my friends call Roble. She was not al
lowed to sign out over the phone for 1:30. When
we left the fog on Paeheeo Pass, I guessed that
we would arrive between 12:10 and 12:20. I
would not give Pacheco any more Stanford lives.
I drove as fast as I safely could, but we were
late. In order to avoid penalty, my friend asked
me to drop her off at a motel. I thought that the
University would prefer to have her sleep on
campus, I was wrong; she summarily received
10 "late minutes." The system reigns in spite of
its purpose. ,
Delays in long trips are sometimes unavoid
able. Women should be able to check in after
vacations at any hour, with impunity. It seems
to me that the AWS could suggest a more reason
able procedure.

It is reported in The Daily that early next
month 63 Stanford students will learn that they
will he the first to attend "Stanford in Ger- |
many" in Stuttgart. Who will these 63 be? Mil- i
ton Mayer in his book "They Thought They Were
Free" gives us some evidence pertaining to the
method used to select individuals taking part in
"exchange programs." He reports, "The Ameri
can 'exchange programs' for German students,
professors, journalists and public officials had
been screened from the start, to bring only pro-
American Germans to America. Now after 1948
the candidates were asked what they thought
of the remilitarization of their country." Those
selected for the "exchange" were and are natu-j
rally for remilitarization.
The question that arises in this writer's mind
is, "What is the value of 'exchanging' people who
are screened to determine if they are pro-Ameri- I
can or pro-German or pro-anything?" Let us
not delude ourselves into thinking that the "ex-i
change" of back-slappers is contributing to the
exchange of unrestricted ideas, freely expressed
thoughts, or uncensored knowledge. Loyalty i
checks, security restrictions and thought screen- j
ing, no matter what the reasons be for their in-j
stitution, are not very conducive to the free ex
change of ideas. Or are we really interested in !
the free exchange of "foreign" ideas and ideolo- j
gies?

Editor's 1 Note: Your reference from Mayer
pertains only to Germans coming to the United
States, not to Americans going to Germany.
It would be well for you to show proof that
Stanford intends to "screen" its prospective
students before casting unfair innuendos. Stir
up trouble where trouble needs to be stirred
up; don't try to resurrect ghosts where there
are no ghos'ts to resurrect.

The women's dormitory regulations have long
perplexed me, but I recently discovered the most
asinine of all. On Jan. 5, I drove 600 miles with
three of my friends. If it had not been for two
unexpected delays ridiculously slow restaurant
service and over a hundred miles of inland fog
we would have arrived here shortly after 10.
When I realized that we would be late, I had
one of my friends call Roble. She was not al
lowed to sign out over the phone for 1:30. When
we left the fog on Paeheeo Pass, I guessed that
we would arrive between 12:10 and 12:20. I
would not give Pacheco any more Stanford lives.
I drove as fast as I safely could, but we were
late. In order to avoid penalty, my friend asked
me to drop her off at a motel. I thought that the
University would prefer to have her sleep on
campus, I was wrong; she summarily received
10 "late minutes." The system reigns in spite of
its purpose. ,
Delays in long trips are sometimes unavoid
able. Women should be able to check in after
vacations at any hour, with impunity. It seems
to me that the AWS could suggest a more reason
able procedure.

When I realized that we would be late, I had
one of my friends call Roble. She was not al
lowed to sign out over the phone for 1:30. When
we left the fog on Paeheeo Pass, I guessed that
we would arrive between 12:10 and 12:20. I
would not give Pacheco any more Stanford lives.
I drove as fast as I safely could, but we were
late. In order to avoid penalty, my friend asked
me to drop her off at a motel. I thought that the
University would prefer to have her sleep on
campus, I was wrong; she summarily received
10 "late minutes." The system reigns in spite of
its purpose. ,
Delays in long trips are sometimes unavoid
able. Women should be able to check in after
vacations at any hour, with impunity. It seems
to me that the AWS could suggest a more reason
able procedure.

Screening of Students
Editor, The Daily:
It is reported in The Daily that early next
month 63 Stanford students will learn that they
will he the first to attend "Stanford in Ger- |
many" in Stuttgart. Who will these 63 be? Mil- i
ton Mayer in his book "They Thought They Were
Free" gives us some evidence pertaining to the
method used to select individuals taking part in
"exchange programs." He reports, "The Ameri
can 'exchange programs' for German students,
professors, journalists and public officials had
been screened from the start, to bring only pro-
American Germans to America. Now after 1948
the candidates were asked what they thought
of the remilitarization of their country." Those
selected for the "exchange" were and are natu-j
rally for remilitarization.
The question that arises in this writer's mind
is, "What is the value of 'exchanging' people who
are screened to determine if they are pro-Ameri- I
can or pro-German or pro-anything?" Let us
not delude ourselves into thinking that the "ex-i
change" of back-slappers is contributing to the
exchange of unrestricted ideas, freely expressed
thoughts, or uncensored knowledge. Loyalty i
checks, security restrictions and thought screen- j
ing, no matter what the reasons be for their in-j
stitution, are not very conducive to the free ex
change of ideas. Or are we really interested in !
the free exchange of "foreign" ideas and ideolo- j
gies?

Editor's 1 Note: Your reference from Mayer
pertains only to Germans coming to the United
States, not to Americans going to Germany.
It would be well for you to show proof that
Stanford intends to "screen" its prospective
students before casting unfair innuendos. Stir
up trouble where trouble needs to be stirred
up; don't try to resurrect ghosts where there
are no ghos'ts to resurrect.
