Editor's Note: This is one of
a series of articles dealing with
the history of Stanford Uni
versity. Today's article deals
with the construction of Memo
rial Church and other campus
buildings. The next article of
the series will describe Mrs.
Stanford's* worries over the ra
tio problem.

As faculty homes dotted the
surrounding area, the turn of the
century saw the first building of
! the Outer Quad go up and con-
I struction of Memorial Church
! begin, the financing guaranteed
by Mrs. Stanford's gift of her
jewels.
Yes, the University which was
| "not likely to have a future" was
J growing in all respects. The
: school's first library, located in
; one of the larger buildings of the
i Inner Quad which was later oecu
! pied by the Law School, had a
' shelf capacity of 18,000 volumes.
A mere 3000 volumes stocked
these shelves opening day. Five
thousand more were accumulated
i during the first year.
The Thomas Welton Stanford
Library was the first building to
he erected in the Outer Quadran-
I gle. The cornerstone was laid
j Nov. 2, 1898, after the final set
j tlement of Senator Stanford's es
tate. It was completed in Janu
ary, 1900, and 250 students trans
ferred the 45,000-volume library
| to its new quarters in an hour
and a quarter. (This did not in
clude the Law Library which was
housed elsewhere.) The present
building was completed in 1919,
I and the University libraries now
! contain about one million three
hundred thousand catalogued
I books and other items and ap
proximately two million uncata
logued.
Church the Center
Mrs. Stanford's biggest dream
was the construction of Memo
| rial Church, to be the center of
the University. In 1899 she trans-
I ferred her jewel collection to the
! Board of Trustees in order to as
| sure its construction .The church
I was completed during her life-
I time without the use of the jew
j els. Mrs. Stanford then request
| ed the Trustees in 1905, "upon
j selling the jewels, to establish
I the Jewel Fund, 'the income
i therefrom to be used exclusively
for the purchase of books and
i other publications'."
Accordingly $500,000 was set
' aside for this purpose. It made
i available immediately and con
; tinuously about $20,000 annually.
Two years later. 1910, a Jewel
i Fund bookplate was designed by
K. H. Blashfield.
Plans for Church
Firms from Boston, San Fran-
I cisco. New York and Venice pro
i vided the plans for the architec
ture. stained glass windows and

mosaics of Memorial Church.
The original plans for the
church were drawn by Shepley,
Rutan and Coolidge and project
ed a Moorish-Romanesque build- !
ing. Clinton Day of San Fran- !
eisco was finally chosen to carry '
out the modified plans of the
Boston firm. Construction began
in 1899, and the church was dedi- j
cated on Jan. 25, 1903.
The 19 windows were all de- !
signed and executed by Frederick
Lamb of F. and J. Lamb, New
York. The windows depicted
scenes in the life of Christ and
were transcribed from the works
of modern painters.
Mosaics from Venice
Full plans for the arranging of
mosaics in the church and in the
gable were placed in the hands
of M. Salviati of A. Salviati and
Company Studios, Venice, Italy.
Mrs. Stanford made the arrange
ments when in Venice in 1900.
Salviati traveled to the United
States in February, 1903, and
June. 1904, for approval of de
signs. In 1904 M. Lorenzo Zam
pato was brought from Venice to
place the mosaics. The work was
completed in 1906.
The more elaborate mosaics
represented scenes from ihe Old
Testament and were taken from
medieval paintings.
Chaplain Selected
Dr. Herbert Newton, rector of
All Souls' Church, New York, was
selected as pastor. He resigned
at the end of the semester and
not until 1905 was his successor
selected. The Trustees finally
settled the problem by dropping
the position of pastor and giving
all his duties to the chaplain, the
Rev. David Charles Gardner.
Gardner held the position until ;
he retired in 1936.
The Stanford Union was con- i
structed following the proposal
of Herbert Hoover, class of '95.
