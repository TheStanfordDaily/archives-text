# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
(*ood Heavens—A lioosl from 1,.A.

Ho, an amazing development! A Stanford athlete is actually get
ting a boost from the press of the Southland < Los Angeles to you
out-of staters). Braven Dyer, a cohort of Paul Zimmerman, Dick
llyland, Sid /iff and all those other people who don't like us up here,
comes out in his 1..A. Times Sports Parade with a memo to Pete
Ko/.clle, general manager of the 1..A. Rams:
"Now that Norman Van Brocklin lias gone to the pits [In* re
cently announced his retirement from pro football], how about
giving Stanford's -lackic Douglas a trial a! that all-important
quartcrhack job for your 1958 club?
"But what can you lose by giving Douglas a trial? Nothing,
except perhaps a thousand smackers as a homis for signing, if
you can get him in the draft. And if he comes through, that'll he
the cheapest thousand Dan Beeves or Ld Pauley or Hal Seley ever
spent."
Dyer, who was a commentator on the national telecast of the
Shrine game, points out what a good job the Indian ace did in leading

the West to its win last month.
And ho adds that the facts that
Douglas is a local hoy (from
Santa Monica) and is hot copy
won't hurt the gate in the least
little hit. And it's no secret that
the pro owners are in the busi
ness to make money. Finally,
Dyer got Ihe opinion of a man
who's been in the news around
here lately:
"Cactus Jack Curtice, coach
of the winners, told me he nev
er coached a more co-operative
player than Douglas, which in
dicates that the young man
knows how to follow orders
. . . which might be a point to
renuneher when talking about
Van Brooklin's successor."
Sounds like a good idea from
tht' Itams' standpoint they'd he
getting themselves a darned good
quarterback. One catch though
Jackie may not play pro ball.
Tennis is beckoning, and it's a
(inch he could do darned well
there, too.

After all, look at Harry MacKay. lie did a spectacular job in
Davis Cup play, but had previously been one of Douglas' favorite
victims. So Australia and Davis Cup lime are certainly far from
an improbability for Stanford's number one netter and footballer.
Well, I ime will tell.
Il< to of the Rooting Section
Fvor stop to think whal a football player thinks about moling?;
Here's a poor guy who beats his brains out every Saturday and j
doesn't get to do any yelling, except maybe a little bit if he's on !
the bench. So when floes his chance come to be vociferous? Or
does he care? Or would he feel like a fool if he yelled his head off? '
There's one sophomore gridster who doesn't mind letting everyone
know ihat he's making up for lost time in the yelling department 1
al basketball games. He was behind the press row at the YVSC
game, and it was a panic to listen to him. There were a few there
who didn't know this individual who were actually becoming con
cerned for his health (not physical health, either). But he meant j
well, and maybe with a few more like him the l'a\iliou would turn
into a real madhouse during theose usually-close battles.
Speaking of the weekend's basketball action, ihe final 1:15 of
the Washington game was a real laugh riot. Seems that some of
the men on the floor thought the clock was moving toward 0 minutes
left when actually it was only headed toward the 1 -minute mark.
Anyway, they got shot-happy and the tempo of the game greatly
speeded up. The crowd caugh on, and kept yelling "Shoot, shoot!"
everj time either team got twithin 25 feet of the basket.
Under the crowd's influence and not bothering to look at the
clock, the bewildered ten kept flinging up wild 25-footers all over
the place. Through it all. Howie Dallmar and Tippy Dye were vainly
trying to get their men to look at the clock. Not much luck, though, i
" And further speaking of the Washington game, what in the world
happened at the free throw line? The Cards converted only 11 of 22 j
attempts, a far cry from the season average of 75.S per cent which
they carried into the fray. To give you an idea of how good that
75.8 is, the Indians were third in the nation in free throw percent
ages.

Top-notch sports clinics are on tap for Stanford on Feb. 1 and 8.
On the Ist, Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain will run an all-day track
clinic. The morning program will consist of lectures and discussions
by and among high school coaches and athletes.
Then, in the afternoon the more than 300 expected guests will j
move onto Angell Field to see the techniques exhibited as Jordan's
varsity and frosh squads run through an intra-squad meet. A unique
feature of the clinic will be a special section where the prep athletes
get together to toll the coaches what they expect of them.
The following week, the new San Francisco Giants will drop over ;
Iri the Sunken Diamond for a joint baseball clinic for northern Cali-'
fornia prep and college coaches. Dutch Fell ring will emcee the pro- i
gram, with the Giants* faculty including manager Bill Kigney, farm
director Carl llubhell, outfielder Hank Saner, coach Merman Franks,
four scouts and, last but not least nor definite, Willie Mays.

Top-notch sports clinics are on tap for Stanford on Feb. 1 and 8.
On the Ist, Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain will run an all-day track
clinic. The morning program will consist of lectures and discussions
by and among high school coaches and athletes.
Then, in the afternoon the more than 300 expected guests will j
move onto Angell Field to see the techniques exhibited as Jordan's
varsity and frosh squads run through an intra-squad meet. A unique
feature of the clinic will be a special section where the prep athletes
get together to toll the coaches what they expect of them.
The following week, the new San Francisco Giants will drop over ;
Iri the Sunken Diamond for a joint baseball clinic for northern Cali-'

A Good Idea But a Catch
(*ood Heavens—A lioosl from 1,.A.

Ho, an amazing development! A Stanford athlete is actually get
ting a boost from the press of the Southland < Los Angeles to you
out-of staters). Braven Dyer, a cohort of Paul Zimmerman, Dick
llyland, Sid /iff and all those other people who don't like us up here,
comes out in his 1..A. Times Sports Parade with a memo to Pete
Ko/.clle, general manager of the 1..A. Rams:
"Now that Norman Van Brocklin lias gone to the pits [In* re
cently announced his retirement from pro football], how about
giving Stanford's -lackic Douglas a trial a! that all-important
quartcrhack job for your 1958 club?
"But what can you lose by giving Douglas a trial? Nothing,
except perhaps a thousand smackers as a homis for signing, if
you can get him in the draft. And if he comes through, that'll he
the cheapest thousand Dan Beeves or Ld Pauley or Hal Seley ever
spent."
Dyer, who was a commentator on the national telecast of the
Shrine game, points out what a good job the Indian ace did in leading

the West to its win last month.
And ho adds that the facts that
Douglas is a local hoy (from
Santa Monica) and is hot copy
won't hurt the gate in the least
little hit. And it's no secret that
the pro owners are in the busi
ness to make money. Finally,
Dyer got Ihe opinion of a man
who's been in the news around
here lately:
"Cactus Jack Curtice, coach
of the winners, told me he nev
er coached a more co-operative
player than Douglas, which in
dicates that the young man
knows how to follow orders
. . . which might be a point to
renuneher when talking about
Van Brooklin's successor."
Sounds like a good idea from
tht' Itams' standpoint they'd he
getting themselves a darned good
quarterback. One catch though
Jackie may not play pro ball.
Tennis is beckoning, and it's a
(inch he could do darned well
there, too.

After all, look at Harry MacKay. lie did a spectacular job in
Davis Cup play, but had previously been one of Douglas' favorite
victims. So Australia and Davis Cup lime are certainly far from
an improbability for Stanford's number one netter and footballer.
Well, I ime will tell.

game, and it was a panic to listen to him. There were a few there

Speaking of the weekend's basketball action, ihe final 1:15 of

Anyway, they got shot-happy and the tempo of the game greatly
speeded up. The crowd caugh on, and kept yelling "Shoot, shoot!"

Top-notch sports clinics are on tap for Stanford on Feb. 1 and 8.
On the Ist, Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain will run an all-day track
clinic. The morning program will consist of lectures and discussions
by and among high school coaches and athletes.
Then, in the afternoon the more than 300 expected guests will j
move onto Angell Field to see the techniques exhibited as Jordan's
varsity and frosh squads run through an intra-squad meet. A unique
feature of the clinic will be a special section where the prep athletes
get together to toll the coaches what they expect of them.
The following week, the new San Francisco Giants will drop over ;
Iri the Sunken Diamond for a joint baseball clinic for northern Cali-'
fornia prep and college coaches. Dutch Fell ring will emcee the pro- i
gram, with the Giants* faculty including manager Bill Kigney, farm
director Carl llubhell, outfielder Hank Saner, coach Merman Franks,
four scouts and, last but not least nor definite, Willie Mays.



JACK DOUGLAS
A Good Idea But a Catch
(*ood Heavens—A lioosl from 1,.A.

Ho, an amazing development! A Stanford athlete is actually get
ting a boost from the press of the Southland < Los Angeles to you
out-of staters). Braven Dyer, a cohort of Paul Zimmerman, Dick
llyland, Sid /iff and all those other people who don't like us up here,
comes out in his 1..A. Times Sports Parade with a memo to Pete
Ko/.clle, general manager of the 1..A. Rams:
"Now that Norman Van Brocklin lias gone to the pits [In* re
cently announced his retirement from pro football], how about
giving Stanford's -lackic Douglas a trial a! that all-important
quartcrhack job for your 1958 club?
"But what can you lose by giving Douglas a trial? Nothing,
except perhaps a thousand smackers as a homis for signing, if
you can get him in the draft. And if he comes through, that'll he
the cheapest thousand Dan Beeves or Ld Pauley or Hal Seley ever
spent."
Dyer, who was a commentator on the national telecast of the
Shrine game, points out what a good job the Indian ace did in leading

the West to its win last month.
And ho adds that the facts that
Douglas is a local hoy (from
Santa Monica) and is hot copy
won't hurt the gate in the least
little hit. And it's no secret that
the pro owners are in the busi
ness to make money. Finally,
Dyer got Ihe opinion of a man
who's been in the news around
here lately:
"Cactus Jack Curtice, coach
of the winners, told me he nev
er coached a more co-operative
player than Douglas, which in
dicates that the young man
knows how to follow orders
. . . which might be a point to
renuneher when talking about
Van Brooklin's successor."
Sounds like a good idea from
tht' Itams' standpoint they'd he
getting themselves a darned good
quarterback. One catch though
Jackie may not play pro ball.
Tennis is beckoning, and it's a
(inch he could do darned well
there, too.

After all, look at Harry MacKay. lie did a spectacular job in
Davis Cup play, but had previously been one of Douglas' favorite
victims. So Australia and Davis Cup lime are certainly far from
an improbability for Stanford's number one netter and footballer.
Well, I ime will tell.
