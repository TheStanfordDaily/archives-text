# Cards Meet Cal Friday, OSC Monday
## 
### 
Coach Howie Dallmar and his
Stanford Indians have a some
what weird schedule ahead of
them in the next week. The squad
will work out through Thursday
for their Friday night game with
the California Golden Bears in
Berkeley, then lay off Saturday
and pick up again on Sunday in
preparation for the Oregon State
invaders, who will be in the Stan
ford Pavilion at 8 p.m. Monday.
Last week end the Indians split
a two-game series with the Wash
ington schools, topping VVSC and
losing to Washington. Dallmar
thought his team "played well, al
though they made mistakes.
Some Good Shots
"I thought they got off some
good shots," the coach noted, "and
our rebounding improved which
helped us to get off more shots
than we previously have. We out
rebounded Washington State, in
fact."
In 112 u r th e r comment on his
team's performances last week
end, Dallmar went on to note that
Stanford had made 68 field goal
attempts against the Cougars and
62 against Tippy Dye's Huskies.
Captain Paul Neumann broke
away from his influenza ailment
and into the starting lineup last
Saturday night, and the Stanford
coach was glad he was back. Chris
Burford, who scored 14 points and
was Friday's high-point man. will
remain in the starting five with
Neumann, Neal Brockmeyer, John
Arrillaga and Dick Ilaga.
Subs in Action
"Doug Warren, Jerry Thuesen
and Mike Tipton will see plenty
of action," Dallmar said. Thuesen
is just coming out of a flu attack,
Warren played well in Neumann's
place Friday, and Tipton turned
in a stellar performance in pacing
the second unit over the week end.
In preparing for the upcoming
games, Dallmar said his squad
would not specifically concentrate
on tactics to be used against the
opposition, but would do a little
hit of this type of work each day,
stressing possibilities for the Cali
fornia tilt early in the week.
Good Defensive Club
"Cal is a good defensive club,"
Dallmar says,"and we will have
to try to overcome their defensive
press. I've seen them onceâ€”
against USF.
"I have great respect for their
guards Allan Buch and Earl Rob
inson and center Don Mcintosh.
They substitute freely at the for
wards until they find a combina
tion that works for them."
