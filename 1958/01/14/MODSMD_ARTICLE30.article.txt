# It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Curtice
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
An official announcement at 2 p.m. Thursday is expected to say
that Jack Curtice has been named the new Stanford football coach.
The release will follow an afternoon Board of Trustees meeting
in San Francisco. At that time, the Trustees are expected to vote
approval of the recommendation of Curtice as it will probably lie
presented to them by tin* Stanford Athletic Hoard.
The Athletic Board was originally slated to meet Jan. 17, one
day after the Trustees' monthly meeting. It is- reported from re
liable sources, however, that the Board will complete a telegraphic
vote today on whether or not to recommend Curtice. In liy lit of
developments of the past two weeks, no opposition is expected to
the move.
If the Board does vote approval of Curtice, his name will be
presented to the Trustees Thursday, and it is anticipated that they
will quickly give their affirmation to the hiring of Curtice.
It is considered highly unlikely that the Athletic Board could he
voting on any other individual(s) except Curtice. He has been the
leading candidate for the .job ever since the Shrine game in late
December.
Boh Blackmail of Dartmouth found favor in some quarters, par
ticularly Southern California, last week, hut he took himself out
of the picture over the weekend with an announcement that he
wished to he withdrawn from consideration for the job.
The Daily tried to contact Curtice yesterday afternoon at the
University of Utah, hut he was reportedly in Florida, lie was
expected to return to his home at Salt Lake City this afternoon.
