# Taylor Likes New PAT Rule
## 
### 
J
Football's point after touch
down got a good going over yes
: terday, and former Stanford head
i coach Chuck Taylor "likes it." The
j rules committee of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
has voted to give two points for
j conversions scored by passing and
j running and one point for those
| scored by a kick.
Taylor, who has long been in
| favor of abolishing the extra
| point, feels the new ruling is "bet
: ter than the old one and will give
a chance to look into the point
after situation. I feel it'll add
color to the game and will cer
; tainly produce a change from the
| spectator angle.
"It's going to pose problems for
a lot of coaches, I'll say." Taylor
feels that something in the way
of abolishing the PAT may still

| arise, but not for a while.
The change is the first in foot-
Iball scoring since 1906. Along
I with the new point system came
the announcement that conversion
; attempts will start from the 3-
yard line instead of the 2.
