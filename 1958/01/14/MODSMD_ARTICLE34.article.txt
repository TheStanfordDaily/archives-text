Chi Psi captured the intramural
football championship the last
week of autumn quarter, nipping
I DU 6-0. The Ciii Psi's, led by
Dave Casper, scored the lone
touchdown from 10 yards out
with just three minutes remain
ing. A good fake by end Les Hop
kins allowed halfback Tony White
free rein to catch a short Casper
pass and out race three DU men
as he angled into the end /one.
DU fought right back, but their
j scoring drive was stifled when
| White intercepted a pass. Chi Psi
almost scored again after the in
j terception. A 20-yard pass to Hop
: kins was caught less than a yard
outside the end zone and thus did
not count.
Up to the Chi Psi score, it was
DU's ball game. Their defensive
, line of Buz Honsaker, John Bark
j hurst, Gary Johnson and Bob An
j drews was charging hard and giv
! ing the Chi Psi offense little time
j to jell. But they were inside the
j Chi Psi 30-yard line three times
without making good.
Bob Wallace, DU quarterback,
| hit end Harry Hall and his other
receivers well and also picked up
good gains on runs. However, in
side their 30, the Chi Psi defen
sives econdary contained the DU
j team.

I son got under way last night as

| year, are rated high among the
i 108 entries, but are expected to be
given a battle in their quest to
! repeal, the litle from Dolts, Betas,
Kappa Sigs ;tnd AKL's.

I from autumn quarter except for

arc set to meet in a playoff. Point
lotals show that Kappa Sig is the
leader in all-school competition,
with 98 points.
Beta Biz, in second place with
i 01, is followed closely by DU with
j 88. Close behind in fourth and
fifth places are Chi Psi (811 and

free rein to catch a short Casper
pass and out race three DU men
as he angled into the end /one.

almost scored again after the in
j terception. A 20-yard pass to Hop
: kins was caught less than a yard
outside the end zone and thus did
not count.
Up to the Chi Psi score, it was
DU's ball game. Their defensive
, line of Buz Honsaker, John Bark
j hurst, Gary Johnson and Bob An
