A tiny, leather-bound book con
taining musty memories of a lit
erary-minded Victorian lady was
recently acquired by the Library's
Bender Room and is a recent gift
of Mrs. Myrl Jorgensen Northway
of San Francisco.
The little volume is the memory
book of Mrs. Isabella Jane Tow
ers, an Englishwoman, who sent
it to leading authors and poets of
Ihe Romantic period in England
Charles Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Wil
liam Ilazlitt and others- for their
personal inscriptions.
It contains notes, sketches, top
ical comment in the form of news
paper clippings, poems and com
plimentary passages to Mrs. Tow
ers written between 1827 and 1859.
Ilazlitt, after perusing some of
the other entries, wrote her:
"Hang those fellows, the poets,
say I. They are always getting
the start on us poor prosers on
the most precious situations . . ."
Mrs. Northway donated the
book, valued at $700, to Stanford
as a memorial to her father, the
late Judge Henry Garfield Jor
gensen, class of '06.
