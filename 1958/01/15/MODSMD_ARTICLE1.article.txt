# Phone Building In Last Stages Of Completion
## 
### 
The new telephone exchange
building, across from the Cellar,
is now nearing completion, ac
cording to Pole Allen, head of the
Stanford News and Publication
Service. The building was origi
nally scheduled to be finished this
month.
It will be some time before the
exchange is used, as there is much
heavy equipment that has to be
installed, Allen said.
The exchange will be used for
academic and administrative tele
phones only and will replace the
old exchange, now located in a
back corner of the business school
building. There is some possibil
ity that residence phones will be
connected to the new exchange
this summer, he added.
The old switchboard has been
up to capacity for several years
and has been supplemented by
several small switchboards in the
administrative area, which will
be eliminated. Also, direct out
side lines which many offices now
have are to be canceled.
The cost of the new exchange
is $80,000, which includes both the
building and the equipment. There
are 26.30 feet of floor space, two
thirds of which is underground
and which will contain the heavy
equipment. The ground floor has
switchboard space for five opera
tors.
The central location of the new
exchange minimizes the mileage
rate the telephone company
charges and will make the service
cheaper, Allen concluded.
