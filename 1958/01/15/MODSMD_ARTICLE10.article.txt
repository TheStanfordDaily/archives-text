# Brandt Praises European Pact As Momentous Step in History
## Alliance of Countries in Field of Customs Duties Endorsed as Politically Significant 
### 
An appraisal, with wholehearted endorsement, of the European
Economic Community was given by Karl Brandt, associate director
of the Food Research Institute, last night in Memorial Auditorium
at the Tuesday Evening Series.
Speaking on "Europeâ€”The Emerging Third Power," Brandt out-

linen tne oaeKgrouna 01 tne alli
ance of France, Germany, Italy,
Belgium, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands in the field of cus
toms duties.
The six countries began a pro
gram of merging their economic
markets on Jan. 1 of this year.
Brandt explained that they also
have plans to organize a common
atomic energy market.
"This is a new, momentous
phase of European history," the
economist said. "While the Mes
sina Treaty, signed in 1954, is
mainly for economic purposes, it
has political significance. By
transferring part of its power to
make economic decisions, each
country has abandoned part of
its sovereignty."
Monetary System
The treaty also provides for
the eventual organization of a
common monetary system and
the free convertibility of the cur
rencies of the six member na
tions. This will allow labor as
well as capital to move freely
within the area.
"While complete free trade
will not spring up overnight, the
impact will be felt immediately,"
Brandt said.
"Europe must solve its social
and economic problems in order
to remain free, and it must be
politically and militarily united."
The economist pointed out that
businessmen are fearing a pos
sible depression in the coming
year. He said that, the six nations
involved in the European Eco
nomic Community are committed
to liberalize trade which is what
the situation demands, rather
than to use restrictions.
Now Frontiers
"The free market opens new
112 ron I iors for Europe," said
Brandt. "Young people can meet
with other young people and can
find opportunities in all fields."
The six countries have more to
gain by a limited program such
as that of the customs duties
than by a wild goose chase for
the whole unification of Europe
at once.
The nations are under compul
sion to put their resources into
use for common advantage. They
are looking for security and the
advantages of the United States
are a great incentive, Brandt
said.
