## Utah Coach Expects Definite Word On Stanford Grid Job by Thursday 
### Dick Barnes. Sports Editor 
Jack Curtice told The Daily yesterday that he will decide sometime
before tomorrow whether or not he will accept the job as head Stan
ford football coach—if it is offered.
The expected formal offer will come tomorrow following a Board
of Trustees meeting in San Francisco.
Curtice told The Daily in an exclusive telephonic interview from

Salt Lake City that he hadn t yet
reached a decision. He said he ex
pected to talk to Chuck Taylor,
Stanford assistant athletic direc
tor-to-be, last night, and that they
would go over the situation from ,
both sides.
The Utah coach said he would j
make his decision after talking
with Taylor and ironing out spe
cific details. "There are things we
both would like," Curtice added,
and so it is expected that the de
gree of compromise will frame
the basis for his final action.
The Daily contacted Taylor
yesterday about 4:15, a few min
utes after talking with Curtice.
Will Call Today
Taylor stated then that he did
not expect to call Curtice last

night. He said, "I expect to get
in touch with Curtice Wednesday
night."
Taylor added that the Board of
Athletic Control has now sched
uled a meeting for today, at which
time they will decide upon a rec
ommendation for a new coach.
When asked if it. were definite
that the board would settle on a
candidate. Taylor replied, "Oh,
yes." He said he could not answer
the question of whether the board
would consider any names other
than Curtice.
Were to Meet Friday
Original plans called for the
board to meet Friday, one day
after the monthly University trus
tees' meeting. Reliable sources
first indicated a telegraphic vote
would be held yesterday, and then
finally it was decided to hold the

Chuck Taylor said late last
night that he would definitely
not. talk to Jack Curt-ice until
after today's meeting of the
Stanford Athletic Board.


"CACTUS JACK" CURTICE
To Reach Decision Today

regular meeting today. Taylor ex
pected most of the board mem
bers to be present.
Meanwhile, a report circulated
by the Associated Press said that
Curtice would he appointed and
with a three-year contract calling
for an annual salary of $15,000.
The release quoted "a source close
to the school."
The AP said Curtice wouldn't
decide until Friday -contrary to
what he told The Daily.

The wire service, again attrib
j uting statements to its "source,"
said "an understanding was reach-1
I ed at the NCAA meeting in Phila
delphia for Curtice to get a ihree
year contract and bring in either
two or three assistant coaches.!
Two of Taylor's staff presumably |
would be dropped and two or
three remain."
Talked with Taylor
The Daily first asked Curtice if
he had received a firm offer from
Stanford. He answered: "I don't
know if you'd call it final. I've
talked to Chuck and others there,
but I'd guess the formal offer
would come through the trustees."
He went on to say: "Chuck has
more dope on it. I hardly know
what to tell you for any publica
j tion, due to the fact we still have
; to go over both sides."
I One thing was definite Curtice
expects to receive definite notice]
, on Thursday.
The 49-year-old mentor said: "I
am not interested in offers from
other schools. Texas A&M wanted
to bring me down there to look it
over, but I told them I'd just be j
| wasting their time and mine."
Stanford Praised
He complimented Stanford by
(noting that it was the one place
he would consider moving to. The
"fine traditions and excellent edu
j cation" are aspects of the Univer-
I sity that appeal to Curtice.
His philosophy of football, he 1
remarked, is that "the kids have

fun." He feels Stanford and Utah
both conduct their programs with i
this in mind.
If Curtice does come to Stan
ford, dissatisfaction with his job
at Utah will definitely not be one
of the reasons. He mentioned such
advantages as tenure and a full
professorship that he has gained
at the Salt Lake City school.
Curtice mentioned that he was
in this area during the war, and
that he had been at Stanford with
the West Shrine team for the
past two years. The school, he
said, "has always been one of the
institutions I've been most im

i pressed with."
In regard !o assistants should
he come here, Curtice said: "Off
hand, we've chatted about it, but
with nothing final or definite.
We'd probably want some of those
there and bring some from here
too."
Curtice returned to Salt Lake
City only yesterday afternoon. He
had been in Florida for a meeting
of the NCAA rules committee and
before that was in Philadelphia at
the couches' meeting.
How was ho, after all the hus
tling around?
"I'm just crawling."
