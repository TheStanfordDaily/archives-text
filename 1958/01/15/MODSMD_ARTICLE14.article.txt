# Nan Merriman To Be Featured At Symphony
## 
### Margot Zeiss 
Tonight's program for the San
Francisco Symphony will feature
Nan Merriman, mezzo - soprano,
who will replace Victoria de los
Angeles. Miss de los Angeles will
not perform as scheduled because
of the death of her father, in
Spain, the symphony management
announced yesterday.
Orchestral Works
The program also includes two
orchestral works- Symphony No.
4 in C Minor, the "Tragic Sympho
ny," by Franz Schubert, and "Es
pana," a rhapsody by Alexis Cha
brier.
Miss Merriman will sing "When
I Am Laid in Earth," the poignant
aria from Purcell's opera "Dido
and Aeneas." She will also sing
"Violette," by Scarlatti, and "Oh!
Had I Jubal's Eyes," from Han
del's oratorio "Joshua." Miss Mer
riman will give the first complete
performance in San Francisco of
Falla's beautiful "El Amor Bru.jo."
"Dreamy and Improvident"
II has been said there was no
more dreamy, improvident and
impractical composer in all the
history of music, with the possi
ble exception of Mozart, than
Franz Schubert, lie was born in
Vienna in ITD7 and composed the
"Tragic Symphony" during his j
20th year. His inexhaustible and
almost incredible gift for melody
is shown in the enchanting themes
of this symphony.
It is hoped that tonight's pro
gram will be, as it promises, more
enjoyable and easier 1o listen to
than Yehudi Menuhin's perform
ance of Bela Bartok's "Concerto
for Violin and Orchestra," which
seemed to be a mere technical ex
ercise selected to show off Men
uhin's virtuosity.
