## 
### 
"We face two alternatives in
(he existing world situation," said
Dr. Albert Baez, visiting professor
of physics from Redlands Univei
sit.y and speaker at the Y Political
Affairs Discussion Group yestei
day noon.
"With the intensified spiraling
of nuclear weapon production, sci
entists can promise us world an
nihilation," Baez stated. There
maining alternative, which lie
feels has not been adequately ex
plored by the United States, is a
search for constructive means to
immediately halt nuclear test:;.
A declaration to the Soviet Un
ion that we would test no more
bombs unless they did would re
suit in a tremendous boost in the
U.S.'s moral prestige, Baez main
tained, and he feels that. now is
the optimum time for reaping tlv
propagandist advantages of such
a first move.
Associated with UNESCO
through a technical assistance
program in Iraq, Baez believes in
the organization's means to peace
through science, education a id
culture, citing work camps in for
eign countries as programs which
effect important cultural ex
changes.
The possibility of a student ex
change between Stanford and a
Soviet university was brought up
by the Y group, as were proposals
for exchanging letters and other
information with students in uni
versities there.
The topic will be continued next
Tuesday at the Y, when Dr. Bas
kara Rao of the World University
Service will speak at noon lunch.
