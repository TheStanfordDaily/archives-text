# Governor Lee and Taxes
## 
### 
Today we are honored with a visit by the Hon
orable J. Bracken Lee, former governor of
Utah.
Here man who has always boon out
spoken in his beliefs. For this we admire him.
for there is much truth in the words ho has
thus far spoken and will no doubt speak to
night.
But we cannot wholly agree with him. e
cannot do this because he represents lor us the
ultimate in nationalistic thinking as opposed
to idealistic thinking.
Lee represents, and is chairman of, For
America. This is an ultra-patriotic group that
seeks the advance of America at the expense
of tin 1 rest of the world. Thov would not admit
this in so manv words, but by not accenting the
community of man they would uphold the
narrower community of just Americans.
Lee is strongly outspoken in his condemna
tion of the United Nations as an organization
from which the United States should withdraw.
Mis main objection seems to rest in the fact
that the United States sits at the same table
with the Soviet Union in an equaliU of nations,
when the Soviet people obviously do not have
the same equality of freedom as the American
people do. Lee forgets that should the United
States withdraw from the family of nations,
this would in no way help to raise the Russian
people to the same level of freedom, but might
instead worsen their lot.
He has charged that the United Nations is
always compromising to the Kussian viewpoint.
Since the United States is one of the two top
leaders of the United Nations, this apparently
means that the United States is compromising
her own ideals.
If, to gain peace in the world, the United
States is forced to compromise in some areas,
then we believe that the United States should
do so by all means, for there is practically
nothing that is more horrible than war.

Loo is woll known for refusing to pay his
inooine taxes on the grounds that this money
was being used for foreign aid purposes.
\\ helher this is a valid reason for not paving
income taxes is a point we will not try to
discuss.
Hut we must admit that to a certain extent
Lee is on the right track on the question of j
foreign economic assistance. Many, and we j
among them, believe that more can he done
to stem Soviet advance by the use of cultural j
collaboration and through the fostering of j
mutual understanding. This method can he â€¢
reciprocal, and a sense of mutuality and obli- |
gation can he huilt up. Economic assistance is i
too often just a donor-recipient relationship.
But where economic aid is necessary to pre
vent hunger and loss of life among a certain
group of peoples in the world, then we believe
that aid should he given, oven if those peoples
are in countries wherein the governments fol
low the Communistic lino.
Loo advocates a novel form for gathering of!
funds to support the federal government. Con
gress, he says, can he given the authority to
procure money from the states on the basis of I
per-capita incomes. The states would ho given
the responsibility of raising the money in what
ever form they chose.
It seems to us that whichever way one looks!
at it.the individual is going to he hit just as
hard one way as another, and Leo's way of
doing it seems more roundabout and would
increase the amount of bookkeeping and gen
eral bureaucracy, which would defeat the
whole purpose.
But, whatever we think of Lee and his posi
tion, it would be valuable for us, as students, |
to hear his position so that we may have a
fuller understanding of the arguments for*
either side. To gain knowledge is our greatest
aim.
