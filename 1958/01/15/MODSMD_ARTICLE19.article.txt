Democratic Garbage
Editor, The Daily:.
.lust who do you think you are? You have re
peatedly used the editorial columns of The Daily,
ihe students' paper, as a vehicle for expressing
your personal views. Monday was the last straw.
Merely because you are naive and stupid enough
to he led inlo supporting a person of such du
bious character as Pat Brown is no reason to
corrupt ihe editorial columns with such tripe.
The place for such insane drivel is in a by-lined
column so that we may determine who this fool
is. Or do you lack the courage of your convic
tions and desire to hide behind editorial ano
nymity? The editorial columns of a newspaper
are supposed to reflect the views of its support
ers or be completely unbiased. You have pre
viously stated that you desired to take the for
mer stand. If so. then when did you take your
last poll to determine how many Democrats and
Republicans there are on campus? If you can
show that the Democrats are in the majority,
then sueh trash as appeared Monday might be
justified. However, no such evidence has been
advanced.
To state that you wish Brown and Engle the

"best of luck" is a serious breach of the'trust
placed in you by the students of this University.
To people outside the campus, The Daily repre
sents the views of the student body. Therefore,
you cannot support (or wish luck to) anyone
without first determining if such is the will of
your sponsors, the Stanford students. Merely
because you personally happen to like Brown is
no reason to force these views on the students
by placing them in The Daily's editorial columns.
Last spring, The Daily won a vote of confi
dence from the students on the promise (among
others) of keeping the paper on a level express
ing the views of the students. Monday's garbage
is not in keeping with that promise. Don't forget
that a new referendum can take place at any
time and you can lose as easily as you won last
time. Where would that leave you? Now go
back to your dingy little office and think before
you do something as ridiculous as you did Mon
day. We don't give a hoot whom you do or don't
like. .lack Rolls
Editor's Note: According to Webster's New
International Dictionary, uii editorial is "an
article published as an expression of the views

in control of the paper."
