# Memorial Church to Hold Week of Prayer Program
## Daily Prayer for Christian Unity To Be Offered by Guest Pastors 
### Marilyn Moore

ing the most famous artists of
Europe to create works for Euro
pean churches.
Non-sectarian Church
"That Stanford should take
part in the Week of Prayer is
doubly fitting," said the Rev.
Robert M. Minto, University
chaplain. "It is appropriate be
cause we have a non-sectarian
church promoting unity and un
derstanding, and also because the
final day, Jan. 25, coincides with
the 55th anniversary of the dedi
cation of the Memorial Church."
The week will be observed at
the 10 a.m. prayer service every
day and the 9 a.m. communion
service on Sunday. The form

Spiritual Experiences
The Week of Prayer can lead
to new spiritual experiences. The
following portion of an account
of a unique pilgrimage made by
members of SS Alban and Ser
gius to Denmark during this
week in 1955 tells of one such ex
perience:
"In one of the principal streets
of Copenhagen there are three
churches: Lutheran, Russian Or-
Ihodox and Roman Catholic, and
at the end of the street the An
glican Church, and five minutes
away a Swedish Lutheran
Church. Led by the president of
the parish, Pastor Borregaard,
the pilgrimage began in the Lu
theran Church, where a psalm
was sung and prayers were given.
Point of Pilgrimage
"From there we went to the
Russian Church for another
short office, next we crossed ihe
street to the Roman Catholic
Church where the credo was said
and a chorale sung. This was per
haps the culminating point of the
pilgrimage, for it was the first
time such a thing had happened
here. In the Anglican Church
prayers for unity were said, and
when the pilgrims approached
the Swedish church for the last
brief service the bells were rung.
This originally appeared in the
French religious magazine, Ireni
kon."
"We would like to urge all
Stanford students and faculty to
participate in tlit? Wpek of Play
er," said Minto.

the pilgrimage began in the Lu
theran Church, where a psalm
was sung and prayers were given.
Point of Pilgrimage
"From there we went to the
Russian Church for another
short office, next we crossed ihe
street to the Roman Catholic
Church where the credo was said
and a chorale sung. This was per
haps the culminating point of the
pilgrimage, for it was the first
time such a thing had happened
here. In the Anglican Church
prayers for unity were said, and
when the pilgrims approached
the Swedish church for the last
brief service the bells were rung.
This originally appeared in the
French religious magazine, Ireni
kon."
"We would like to urge all
Stanford students and faculty to
participate in tlit? Wpek of Play
er," said Minto.
Memorial Church will be ob
serving a very special week from
Jan. 18 to 25, the Week of Prayer
for Christian Unity. This week is
sponsored by the World Council
of Churches, and Roman Catho
lic, Greek Orthodox and Protes
tant churches throughout the
world will join together in pray
ing for unity.
The origins of Ihe Week of
Prayer are traced to a French

realized the need of a bond be
tween different religions. This
priest is also noted for persuad
ing the most famous artists of
Europe to create works for Euro
pean churches.
Non-sectarian Church
"That Stanford should take
part in the Week of Prayer is
doubly fitting," said the Rev.
Robert M. Minto, University
chaplain. "It is appropriate be
cause we have a non-sectarian
church promoting unity and un
derstanding, and also because the
final day, Jan. 25, coincides with
the 55th anniversary of the dedi
cation of the Memorial Church."
The week will be observed at
the 10 a.m. prayer service every
day and the 9 a.m. communion
service on Sunday. The form

"In one of the principal streets
of Copenhagen there are three

Ihodox and Roman Catholic, and
at the end of the street the An
