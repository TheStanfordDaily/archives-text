Where the Paper's Not So Worn
Posted on the sports bulletin hoard here in the Daily shack is a
reference list of Stanford's athletic coaches, their sports and phone
numbers. In order it reads: A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics;
Charles A. "Chuck" Taylor, Head Football Coach; and so on down
Ihe list.
Pretty near the top, though, one finds the names of coaches of
Stanford's most publicized athletic teams and around these the
paper seems a little thinner where members of the staff have worn
it down by tracing their fingers from the names, through titles and
across to phone numbers.
Hut also on this list are the names of coaches of the less popular
(or, at leasl, less publicized) sports. In order that the list should not
wear out at the top before the bottom even gets used, I drew my
finger across the sheet, placing calls to the numbers I found and
came up with the following information which might otherwise have
not found its way into these pages.
While Stanford's football, basketball, track and baseball teams
seem to draw Ihe greatest percentage of interest, it's a good thing
for us to bring to mind that Stanford also has wrestling and gymnas
tics, tennis, swimming and fencing teams. The following is what's
new with them.
WRESTLING Coach Wes Ruff reports that Stanford wrestlers I
will he in action at Santa Clara tonight. The matches are set to start
Ihere at 7:30. On Saturday the Stanford squad will take part in an !
unusual four-school meet at San Jose. Besides the locals, S:m Jose I
Slate, Santa Clara and Cal will compete. It is set up as three differ- j
ent dual meets, with Indian grapplers set to go at 10 a.m. and 1 and
4 p.m.
Ruff says Saturday's outing will be a rugged one this early in |
Ihe season with each man having to wrestle two bouts. "But," he j
adds, "all the schools are in the same boat so I guess it won't be too
bad." On the 31st of the month San Diego State, one of the coast
wrestling powerhouses, will be in Encina Gym for a 7:30 p.m. set
of matches.
The wrestling coach named Pete Barnhei/el, John Upton, George
Smith, George Ong, Keith McFarland, Bill Dudman, Roger and Bruce
Ldelson, Karl llufbauer, Mike Munick, Larry Meyers and Jim New
ton as members of the squad who will see considerable action this
year.
An experimental meet will be held here on Feb. 8 which is ex
pected to draw representatives from nine colleges. II will be a Frosh
Invitational Meet which, if successful, will probably be repeated in
ihe future.
GYMNASTICS (also Ruff's domain). The local squad will meet
the Olympic Club (away) on Jan. 31, then will be at home to take on
ihe San Jose State Spartans on Feb. 19. Team captain Ron Pjllsbury
was injured last year and will be lost to the squad this year at his |
highbar position. He will, however, he able to serve with the team
as the leading rope climber. Ruff figures his mainstays at present j
tf) he Dale Beernink, Frank Christiansen and Bill Abernatby.
TENNIS Coach Bob Renker reports that the team has been
working out when weather permitted, and that top man Jack Doug
las has been on the court. He expects his team to he a better one j
than represented Stanford last year, one with more depth.
"""Tennis play starts next month against the Olympic and Cal tennis ]
clubs. Members of the squad have played their round robin games)
to determine rankings but these haven't been computed yet. Renker
expecst that Douglas, Gil White, Brooks Rawlingv and Dave Nelson
are pretty safe with about 10 other members of the squad pretty even
at present.
Lowell Caruth and Bob Bowden, back from last year, and Jim
Jeffries and Robin Hilgeman, up from the '57 frosh squad, figure to
bolster Stanford expectations. Renker also reports that the Northern
California Intercollegiate Tournament will be held at Stanford this j
year during the last week of February, the first time they've ever I
been held on these college courts.
Fencers Swinging into Action
FENCING —Two meets are coming up this weekend for the In
dian fencing group. On Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Encina Gym the newer
members of the group will take on Balboa High School. Then, on
Saturday, California will be here for a 2 p.m. match. These matches
are between three-man teams in foil competition. Coach Elwyn
Bugge will probably go with Hungarian fencer and saber champ
George Domolky, John Gates and John Daniels.
Fifteen to 20 advanced fencers are vying for positions on the
squad. On the 24th another match here will be against Lincoln High
School. Around the end of March the Western Intercollegiate Cham- |
pionships will be held here on campus.
SWIMMING—Tom Haynie begins news of the swimming world
with the notice that there will be a varsity and freshman team meet
ing at 4 p.m. tomorrow at the pool, then goes on to note that the
squads are holding daily workouts- further noting that he expects
all the guys to report for these.
It'll be a while before the aquamen get into competitive action j
as their first go is set for March 1 at San Jose State, an AAU open
championship meet.
Letter winners returning include 1500-meter freestyle champion
Robin Moore, butterfly man Winston Black, freestyle sprinters Treat
Cafferata and Dennis Stimson, Hank Fourcade and Wayne Meld.
