# TONIGHT'S POLI UNION SPEAKER
## Foreign Aid, Taxation to Be Subject of J. Bracken Lee 
### 
Refusal to pay income tax and refusal lo proclaim United Nations
Day have focused the nation's political spotlight on tonight's Politi
cal Union speaker.
J. Bracken Lee, chairman of For America and former governor of
Utah, will speak on "Foreign Aid and Taxation" at 7:30 in Dinkel

spiel Auditorium.
In 1954, Lee, I lien governor of
Utah, refused to proclaim United
Nations Day, instead naming Oct.
24 as United Slates Day. When
queried by a Stanford student,
Lee responded as follows. .
"I think it is worth observing
that you and others are able to
object to my action just as vo
ciferously as you wish to. This
same situation would not apply,
however, if you resided in the
Soviet Union which is no respec
er of freedom of speech, freedom
of religion and the other free
doms we enjoy. Despite this,
however, the Soviet Union is a
member of the United Nations
and holds the power of veto in
the Security Council.
"UN Effort a Disgrace"
. . The United Nations effort
in Korea, from my standpoint,
was nothing less than a disgrace.
... I think that Korea is typical
of the compromising nature of
the United Nations and unfortu
nately most of the compromises
have been made to appease the
Communist nations.
". . . When reference to God
was omitted from the UN Char
ter. it was simply a gesture to
ward Russia, and I think a most
ill-advised one.
"... I might add that the fact
that college and university news
papers are pro-UN is not so much
a tribute to the thinking of these
schools as it is a compliment, to
the effective propaagnda behind
the United Nations."
Income Tax Repeal
Lee, as chairman of For Amer
ica, is advocating the repeal of
the Income Tax (16tht Amend
ment and refused to pay federal
taxes because part of it would go
to foreign aid.
The former governor claims
that income tax is a demoralizing
influence on the American people
and says that "the outright re
peal of the 16th Amendment
would not only raise the moral
standards of Americans, but of
the entire world, and would bring
a rebirth of freedom in the hearts
and minds of people everywhere."
Studrnt Talk
Kilburn MacMurraugh, presi
dent of the Political Union, said
that Lee's talk will be followed by
a student talk by Peter Grothe
and then questions from the
floor.
The resolution "Foreign aid
has not achieved its objectives"
will be informally debated and a
vote will be called on the reso
lution.
MacMurraugh added that new
members should sign member
ship lists which will be available
in the lobby of Dinkelspicl Audi
torium.

In 1954, Lee, I lien governor of
Utah, refused to proclaim United
Nations Day, instead naming Oct.
24 as United Slates Day. When
queried by a Stanford student,
Lee responded as follows. .
"I think it is worth observing
that you and others are able to
object to my action just as vo
ciferously as you wish to. This
same situation would not apply,
however, if you resided in the
Soviet Union which is no respec
er of freedom of speech, freedom
of religion and the other free
doms we enjoy. Despite this,
however, the Soviet Union is a
member of the United Nations
and holds the power of veto in
the Security Council.
"UN Effort a Disgrace"
. . The United Nations effort
in Korea, from my standpoint,
was nothing less than a disgrace.
... I think that Korea is typical
of the compromising nature of
the United Nations and unfortu
nately most of the compromises
have been made to appease the
Communist nations.
". . . When reference to God
was omitted from the UN Char
ter. it was simply a gesture to
ward Russia, and I think a most
ill-advised one.
"... I might add that the fact
that college and university news
papers are pro-UN is not so much
a tribute to the thinking of these
schools as it is a compliment, to
the effective propaagnda behind
the United Nations."
Income Tax Repeal
Lee, as chairman of For Amer
ica, is advocating the repeal of
the Income Tax (16tht Amend
ment and refused to pay federal
taxes because part of it would go
to foreign aid.
The former governor claims
that income tax is a demoralizing
influence on the American people
and says that "the outright re
peal of the 16th Amendment
would not only raise the moral
standards of Americans, but of
the entire world, and would bring
a rebirth of freedom in the hearts
and minds of people everywhere."
Studrnt Talk
Kilburn MacMurraugh, presi
dent of the Political Union, said
that Lee's talk will be followed by
a student talk by Peter Grothe
and then questions from the
floor.
The resolution "Foreign aid
has not achieved its objectives"
will be informally debated and a
vote will be called on the reso
lution.
MacMurraugh added that new
members should sign member
ship lists which will be available
in the lobby of Dinkelspicl Audi
torium.
