# Defensive Ability, Spirit California's Strong Points
## 
### John Schwarz 
Editor's Note: Daily sports writer John Schwarz scouted Cali
fornia when they played in the Holiday Festival semi-finals at
Madison Square Garden in New York. The Bears heat Dayton,
tiO-55, in that same, hut Inst in the finals to Temple. The following

is the first of a two-part report
on Cal as they looked in the
Dayton game. Stanford plays
the Bears Friday night at Ber
keley.
A lack of experienced players
plus a below-par shooting aver
age mixed with a great deal of
spirit and defensive know-how
seemed to be the distinguishing
features of the California Bear
basketball team as it played
against the Dayton Flyers last
month in the Holiday Festival at
Madison Square Garden.
California, having been out
played for 38 of the 40 minutes of
the regulation game, suddenly
came to life in the last two min
utes, tied the score and then went
on to win the game in overtime.
This perhaps is a good indica
tion of the type of club the 1957-
58 Bears are. As individuals no
member of the team is rated too
highly, hut as a unit California
ranks among the best in the PCC
and perhaps will wind up as one
of the best in the country.
Robinson Returns
From the starting five of last
year's PCC championship team
only guard Earl Robinson is back
this year. The loss of All-Ameri
can forward Larry Friend and 0-8
center Duane Asplund has defi
nitely hurt Cal.
Forward Don Mcintosh, who
was a starter last year until he
was injured, might have been a
replacement for Friend, but when
Pete Newell. Cal coach, found he
had no adequate center for this
year's squad, he had to move Mc
intosh into the center slot.
At center the lanky 6-6er is al
most completely out of place. He
is always drifting out of the pivot
to all parts of the floor to take
jump shots arid one-handers. On
offense he never appears to know
whether he is playing center or
forward.
Strong Rebounder
The one attribute that Mcintosh
posessses which he contributes to
the team is his strong rebounding
off the defensive boards. On de
fense he is perfectly at home in
the post and is a game scrapper,
managing to grab a large major
ity of the team's rebounds.
At forwards Newell has been
using Bob Dalton, Jack Grout and
George Sterling, all up from last
year's JV squad, and also Earle
Schneider, leading scorer on last
year's freshman squad. All four
of these boys lack sufficient ex
perience, which shows up prima
rily in their rather sloppy shoot
ing and lack of court savvy.
