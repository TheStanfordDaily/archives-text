# DAMSELS, DEVIL-W AGONS AND DAMAGES
## Early University Problems Included Decreasing Ratio, Athletic Failures 
### Camille Petersen 
Editor's Note: This 1 is a continuation of the present series of
features concerning the history of Stanford University. Today's
article deals with Mrs. Stanford's worries over the ratio "problem"
and the damage to the campus from the 1906 earthquake.

Women, women everywhere—Vassar 11, here we come.
By 1899 this was one of Mrs. Stanford's biggest worries. It seems
that the first year I here were 33 women to every 10 men and in 1895
the ratio had zoomed to 51 women to 100 men. She dreaded the
prospect that in 20 years Stanford would be "the Vassar of the Pa
cific Coast."
The increasing number of women on campus was blamed for the
athletic failures of the Stanford teams. It was said that there were
"so many women women so attractive that too many men turned

to 'queening' rather than to hard
athletic practice for the glory of
the Alma Mater."
In 1899 the 500 limit for women
was set. It wasn't until 1933 that
this gave way to a percentage
basis which corresponded to the
registration figures of 1899.
The Carnot (now Joffrei Medal
was established in 1904 by Baron
Pierre de Coubertin. The medal
was to be awarded annually for
"individual excellence in public
speaking" in a debate between
; Stanford and California students
on some subject of French his
i tory and politics.
Today students worry about
parking space—in 1899 students
worried about being allowed to
bring automobiles, or "devil wag
ons" as they were called, on cam
! pus. They were banned from the
grounds, but in 1905 they were
permitted for football games.
Until 1903 grades were given as
j "excellent," "lazy," passed." etc.
After this time the present sys
tem of A, B, C, D and F was put
into use.
First Bawl-out
The condensed scholarship rec
ord of each student appeared in
the Directory of Officers and Stu
dents (fondly known as the Bawl
out thereafter) in October, 1901.
Its purpose was to provide the
students with an accurate record
of their standing in the Univer
sity and also give them an incen
tive to work for better scholar
ship status.
At 5:12 a.m.. April 18, 1906, all
was well on the Stanford campus
—at 5:14 the interior of Memorial
Church was wrecked, the unfin
ished library and gymnasium,
Memorial Arch were completely
wrecked; and Agassi/, had exe
cuted a swan dive from his perch
on Outer Quad into the concrete.
The earthquake struck at 5:13
a.m. and the first great shock
lasted 47 seconds. Only two men
were killed, both by falling chim
neys. Much minor damage was
! done to the buildings. Restora-
J tion cost about $650,000.

that the first year I here were 33 women to every 10 men and in 1895
the ratio had zoomed to 51 women to 100 men. She dreaded the
prospect that in 20 years Stanford would be "the Vassar of the Pa
cific Coast."
The increasing number of women on campus was blamed for the
athletic failures of the Stanford teams. It was said that there were
"so many women women so attractive that too many men turned

to 'queening' rather than to hard
athletic practice for the glory of
the Alma Mater."
In 1899 the 500 limit for women
was set. It wasn't until 1933 that
this gave way to a percentage
basis which corresponded to the
registration figures of 1899.
