The chosen scholar will have a
chance to live in a Japanese home
and he welcomed by many of ihe
people. Marshall wrote soon after
his arrival at his new home in
Yokohama: "... I was met by a
bewildering number of welcomers.
. . . The second day entailed the
formal reception-dinner with pho
tographs, flowers and speeches.
Sources of Amusement
"The Odas are extremely kind
and have taken me into the fam
ily. My height and shoe size have
proved a never-ending source of
amusement to them. ... It helps
to put us on a more familiar
basis."
The scholar who is sent to Keio
this year will bo invited to attend
the International Student Confer
once in Japan with all expenses
paid, to represent, the United
States as Marshall did last sum
mer.
lie writes of some of the advan
tages the conference offers: "The
student conference had the advan
tage of allowing me to meet and
talk with several hundred Japan
ese students in various cities.
These were picked mostly on their
English language ability and in
terest in international affairs. Sev
eral have asked to correspond
with me."
Cultural Ties
The conference has a main pur
pose of strengthening Japanese-
American cultural ties! and the
student sent to Keio is expected
to spend most of his time in cul
tural, rather than academic, pur
suits.
The time Marshall spends study
ing is limited, as he wrote at the
beginning of his classes in Japan:
"I have limited myself to six
courses, each of which meet once
a week for a period of two hours.
. . . The social activities expected
of me are time-consuming."
Further evidence of his work in
furthering our relationship is
shown by his "One of the groups
with whom I will be spending a
great deal of time is the English
Speaking Society. . . . We may
well be able to use its services in
strengthening the ties between
the two student bodies."
Language Barrier
The scholar who goes to Keio
is expected to have studied Jap
anese at least one year. The lan
guage is still a barrier to Mar
shall.
In writing of the Keio Festival,
he admits "I managed, with the
help of four Keio band members,
to give something faintly resem
bling 'Come Join the Band' on a
borrowed baritone horn, hut I'm
afraid my Japanese speech must
have been incomprehensible, al
though no one was impolite
enough to mention it."
Application blanks for the
award of the scholarship are avail
able at the ASSU office, and the
deadline for application and inter
views will be this Friday. For
further information students may

tals, hut the recipient must pro
vide his own transportation to and
from Japan and agree to return
after one year there.
The chosen scholar will have a
chance to live in a Japanese home
and he welcomed by many of ihe
people. Marshall wrote soon after
his arrival at his new home in
Yokohama: "... I was met by a
bewildering number of welcomers.
. . . The second day entailed the
formal reception-dinner with pho
tographs, flowers and speeches.
Sources of Amusement
"The Odas are extremely kind
and have taken me into the fam
ily. My height and shoe size have
proved a never-ending source of
amusement to them. ... It helps
to put us on a more familiar
basis."
The scholar who is sent to Keio
this year will bo invited to attend
the International Student Confer
once in Japan with all expenses
paid, to represent, the United
States as Marshall did last sum
mer.
lie writes of some of the advan
tages the conference offers: "The
student conference had the advan
tage of allowing me to meet and
talk with several hundred Japan
ese students in various cities.
These were picked mostly on their
English language ability and in
terest in international affairs. Sev
eral have asked to correspond
with me."
Cultural Ties
The conference has a main pur
pose of strengthening Japanese-
American cultural ties! and the
student sent to Keio is expected
to spend most of his time in cul
tural, rather than academic, pur
suits.
The time Marshall spends study
ing is limited, as he wrote at the
beginning of his classes in Japan:
"I have limited myself to six
courses, each of which meet once
a week for a period of two hours.
. . . The social activities expected
of me are time-consuming."
Further evidence of his work in
furthering our relationship is
shown by his "One of the groups
with whom I will be spending a
great deal of time is the English
Speaking Society. . . . We may
well be able to use its services in
strengthening the ties between
the two student bodies."
Language Barrier
The scholar who goes to Keio
is expected to have studied Jap
anese at least one year. The lan
guage is still a barrier to Mar
shall.
In writing of the Keio Festival,
he admits "I managed, with the
help of four Keio band members,
to give something faintly resem
bling 'Come Join the Band' on a
borrowed baritone horn, hut I'm
afraid my Japanese speech must
have been incomprehensible, al
though no one was impolite
enough to mention it."
Application blanks for the
award of the scholarship are avail
able at the ASSU office, and the
deadline for application and inter
views will be this Friday. For
