# Final Word On Curtice Due Today
## Salary, Contract Yet Unannounced By Athletic Dept. 
### Dick Barnes 
Jack Curtice is as good as in as
the new Stanford football coach
following yesterday's recommen
dation by the Stanford Athletic
Board thai he bo hired.
The Hoard's report will go be
fore the University Hoard of
Trustees early this afternoon.
Official announcement of Cur
lice's hiring is expected at about
2 p.m.
The announced results of yes
terday's noon meeting of the Ath
letic Hoard were a surprise to no
one. Assistant Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor speaking with The
Daily about the meeting, would
offer no details about the Board's
action.
Salary a. Secret.
Such items as salary, length of
contract and consideration of oth
er names were not released.
Taylor also said he would have
nothing to say aboul any possible
telephone conversations with
Curtice before the Trustees meet.
When The Daily contacted Cur
tice Tuesday, he said he expected
to talk with Taylor sometime be
fore Thursday, and at that time
would either leave his name un
der consideration or withdraw
from the race.
Taylor, however, stated that
there would be nothing further
said before the Trustees' an
nouncement.
Job Vacant Two Months
Assuming the Trustees ap
prove Curtice, and there is no ap
parent reason why they won't,
the announcement will culminate
nearly two months fcif speculation
which began when Taylor quit
the post Nov. 21.
Curtice's name was not men
tioned prominently in the early
stages of rumor-circulating. In
mid-December he suddenly gained
prominence. After he directed
the West to victory in the Shrine
game. Curtice assumed a position
far ahead of any other candidate.
Stanford was not the only
school bidding for his services.
Texas A&M also sent out feelers
to Curtice, but he declined their
invitation to visit College Station
because of basic differences in
football philosophy between him
self and the Aggies.
