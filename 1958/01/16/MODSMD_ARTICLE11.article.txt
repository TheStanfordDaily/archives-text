## Living Groups Compete For 'Faculty Hashers' 
### 
How would you like to have
some of your favorite Stanford
Professors hash for you at dinner
on January 30? That's it . . .
the prize for the living group
that collects the most per person
in this year's Winter Drive that
opens next Monday noon, and the
professors promise the students
a lively time.
Faculty members that will par
ticipate this year include: Albert
V. Baez of the Physics Depart
ment, Alexander Miller of the
Humanities Department, Henry
Blauth of the German Depart
ment, Rixford K. Snyder, Direc
tor of Admissions, John L. Moth
orshead of the Philosophy Depart
ment, Christine Ricker, Director
of University Dining Halls, Rob

lain and Don E. Fehrenbacher of

ing to Mike Praetorius, student

Tip for WUS
Reverend Minto, who took part
in such a project several years
ago said. "We all enjoyed it and
the students got better service
than they ordinarily do." He
added, "On one occasion they left,
a tip." He said this wasn't really
necessary and mentioned that the
tip went to WUS, of course.
It is rumored that one group
will have singing waiters. It
seems Professor Baez thinks a
little singing would cheer up the
students who will be starting mid
terms about that time.
Living groups will bo divided
into three parts. A group of four
professors will hash for the win
tiers in each division. Men's Row
and the Eating Clubs will com
pete together; Women's How, Un
ion and Iho houses of Moore will
form the second division; and
Lagunita, Branner and Roble with
each wing or casa eompcting
separately will compose the third
division.
Student speakers will address
house meetings Monday night and
answer the students' questions
about (ho World University Sorv

ice. Solicitations will continue
throughout next week in the liv
ing groups and there will be no
on-campus activities this year.
President Eisenhower had this
to say about the work of the
World University Service:
"Your program for students
around the world merits the sup
port of all who believe in the con
structive power of education.
Organizations like yours are as
sisting in the development of fu
ture builders of civilization in
spired by a belief in freedom and
justice for mankind."

Tip for WUS
Reverend Minto, who took part
in such a project several years
ago said. "We all enjoyed it and
the students got better service
than they ordinarily do." He
added, "On one occasion they left,
a tip." He said this wasn't really
necessary and mentioned that the
tip went to WUS, of course.
It is rumored that one group
will have singing waiters. It
seems Professor Baez thinks a
little singing would cheer up the
students who will be starting mid
terms about that time.
Living groups will bo divided
into three parts. A group of four
professors will hash for the win
tiers in each division. Men's Row
and the Eating Clubs will com
pete together; Women's How, Un

Lagunita, Branner and Roble with
each wing or casa eompcting
separately will compose the third
division.
Student speakers will address
house meetings Monday night and
answer the students' questions
about (ho World University Sorv

ice. Solicitations will continue
throughout next week in the liv
ing groups and there will be no
on-campus activities this year.

structive power of education.
Organizations like yours are as
sisting in the development of fu
ture builders of civilization in
spired by a belief in freedom and
justice for mankind."
