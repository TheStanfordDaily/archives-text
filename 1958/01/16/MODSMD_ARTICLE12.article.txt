### 
Today's unemployment could
make Democrats strong in the
coming elections, according to
John Harvey Bunzel, assistant
professor of political science.
Bunzel, discussing "Democrats
in Ihc Coming Elections" at yes
terday's Political Union Demo
cratic Caucus, also said that Gov
ernor G. Mermen Williams of
Michigan is the best Democratic
presidential prospect.
Bunzel said that present unem
ployment is of more personal in
terest to voters than foreign pol
icy where President Eisenhower
has the voters' confidence.
Bunzel explained, that in recent
Lube 11 public opinion polls there
was little disturbance over Sput
nik, hut that in the lower classes
there was concern over un
employment. lie said that for
eign policy is a vague issue which
is not in contact with the poor.
Bunzel thinks that Williams is
a vote-getter extraordinary be
cause he is smart, a Phi Beta
Kappa from Princeton, hut is not
an intellectual who talks above
the voters.
Outlining Democratic political
strategy, Bunzel said that teh
support of scientists would be
valuable because their practical
ity outweighs their "intellectual
appearance" before the voters.
He also said that if several lib
eral governors banded together
and made policy statements they
could put Senate Majority Leader
Lyndon Johnson of Texas on the
defensive.
Concerning Democratic pros
pects in California, Bunzel said
that California is conservative
because it is prosperous. lie said
that this conservatism may be
difficult for Democrats to appeal
to, but problems as violent as
race riots may come to California
in five years or so.
