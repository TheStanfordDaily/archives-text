# Men's Council To Try Three In Vandal Case
## Paly, Menlo Polite Turn Trio Over After Wild Spree of Destruction 
### 
Throe Stanford students face possible heavy penalties from Men's
Council as the result of a wild spree of vandalism Tuesday night in
Meulo Park and Palo Alto.
The men, one 18 and two 10, wanted to prove they could out
wit the local police, and led them on a merry chase until they were

cornered chopping down a section
of fence near the Lucky Market
on Charming in the Edgewood
Plaza.
Police Officer Reybert A. Reeee
and Reserve Officer Antone Am
drews spotted the youths while
on a routine patrol and took them
in tow to the police station.
Ready Confession
There the three admitted ev
erything.
The "everything" included
stealing four "police zone" park
ing signs from the curb almost
immediately in front of the Palo
Alto Police Department and chop
ping down a 35-mph sign on Em
barcadero Road and Bayshore
Highway.
The last escapade was per
formed while a California High
way Patrol car was parked only a
few feet away.
Still not satisfied with their
derring-do, the trio stole a gar
bage can from the Walter Hays
School in Palo Alto, into which
t hey piled their ill - gotten tro
phies.
Down with Signs
After that they drove indis
criminately around Menlo Park
and Palo Alto, chopping down or
unscrewing a half-dozen other'
stop signs, speed limit signs and
reflectorized warning signs.
Most of the loot had been re
moved to the men's apartment in
Menlo Park by the time police of
ficers caught up with them.
The only explanation they had
to offer was to see "whether we
could get away with it," accord
ing to police.
The men were quoted as being
particularly gleeful about their
successful theft of the four "po
lice zone" signs from under the
noses of the police department.
They left a fifth sign intact,
they said, "because it made the
joke even better."
Joke Backfired
The joke was on the students
this morning when they were
forced to put back all the signs
they had removed instead of at
tending classes. They worked
first on restoring the "police
zone" signs.
Police Chief William A. Hyde
was asked by a local newspaper
whether the police department
customarily disposed of its evi
dence so swiftly.
"In this case," Hydie was quo!
Ed, "it was considered a matter
of public safety to get those signs
back in place."
Needless to say, police officials
did not go along with the joke.
They threatened to charge the
trio with petty theft and mali
eious mischief.
But final charges were finally
called off and the men were
turned over to campus aulhori
ties for disciplinary action.
Dean of Men William G. Craig
met yesterday with police offi
eials and will meet today with
the chairman of Men's Council to
determine what action to take.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of
students, .said men have gone on
such sprees in the area before
but that the unique feature of
this case was "the form it took"
more than the fact of the esca
pade itself.

Council as the result of a wild spree of vandalism Tuesday night in
Meulo Park and Palo Alto.
The men, one 18 and two 10, wanted to prove they could out
wit the local police, and led them on a merry chase until they were

cornered chopping down a section
of fence near the Lucky Market
on Charming in the Edgewood
Plaza.
Police Officer Reybert A. Reeee
and Reserve Officer Antone Am
drews spotted the youths while
on a routine patrol and took them
in tow to the police station.
Ready Confession
There the three admitted ev
erything.
The "everything" included
stealing four "police zone" park
ing signs from the curb almost
immediately in front of the Palo
Alto Police Department and chop
ping down a 35-mph sign on Em
barcadero Road and Bayshore
Highway.
The last escapade was per
formed while a California High
way Patrol car was parked only a
few feet away.
Still not satisfied with their
derring-do, the trio stole a gar
bage can from the Walter Hays
School in Palo Alto, into which
t hey piled their ill - gotten tro
phies.
Down with Signs
After that they drove indis
criminately around Menlo Park
and Palo Alto, chopping down or
unscrewing a half-dozen other'
stop signs, speed limit signs and
reflectorized warning signs.
Most of the loot had been re
moved to the men's apartment in
Menlo Park by the time police of
ficers caught up with them.
The only explanation they had
to offer was to see "whether we
could get away with it," accord
ing to police.
The men were quoted as being
particularly gleeful about their
successful theft of the four "po
lice zone" signs from under the
noses of the police department.
They left a fifth sign intact,
they said, "because it made the
joke even better."
Joke Backfired
The joke was on the students
this morning when they were
forced to put back all the signs
they had removed instead of at
tending classes. They worked
first on restoring the "police
zone" signs.
Police Chief William A. Hyde
was asked by a local newspaper
whether the police department
customarily disposed of its evi
dence so swiftly.
"In this case," Hydie was quo!
Ed, "it was considered a matter
of public safety to get those signs
back in place."
Needless to say, police officials
did not go along with the joke.
They threatened to charge the
trio with petty theft and mali
eious mischief.
But final charges were finally
called off and the men were
turned over to campus aulhori
ties for disciplinary action.
Dean of Men William G. Craig
met yesterday with police offi
eials and will meet today with
the chairman of Men's Council to
determine what action to take.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of
students, .said men have gone on
such sprees in the area before
but that the unique feature of
this case was "the form it took"
more than the fact of the esca
pade itself.
