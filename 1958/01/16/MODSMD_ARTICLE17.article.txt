# Code, Standard Suspects Tried; Two Convicted
## One Hales Reprimand; Another Acquitted By Student Councils 
### 
In accordance with the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor
Code, Men's Council and the Ju
dicial Council took action recently
in two cases of violations by Stan
ford men.
Men's Council convicted two
students and acquitted a third ac
cused of a Fundamental Standard
Violation involving the petty theft
of an automobile ski rack.
The group was returning to
campus one evening, when they
noticed a parked car with a ski
rack on top. They testified that
they had been drinking.
One of the two students con
victed suggested removing the
rack; the other convicted student
stopped the car while the first
student got out and took the rack.
Non-interference
The occupant of the other ear
got out, but apparently did little
to stop the Stanford students.
He was not a student, but had
been visiting a friend on campus,
and was sleeping in his car. He
told police that he had not resisted
the Stanford students because of
their size.
After driving away with the
rack, the Stanford students went
home, attracting the attention of
the police en route. The police
reported the matter to the Dean
of Men, who subsequently turned
it over to Men's Council.
The acquitted student testified
that he had not participated al
though he had been present. Coun
cil accepted his testimony and
plea of not guilty.
Corp Yard Hours
The student who had removed
the rack received a penalty of 15
corporation yard hours, to be
worked by the end of this quarter.
The other convicted student re
ceived a penalty of 10 hours.
In action involving a possible
Honor Code violation. Judicial
Council acquit led a man suspected
of cheating while making up a
final examination during service
in the Army.
The student had left school sev
eral years ago to go into the serv
ice, necessarily taking five incom
pletes. While in the Army he ar
ranged with his professor to
make up one of his incompletes
by taking the final exain, which
he had missed, by mail.
Very Higrh "A"
The professor sent him an ex
amination which had been used
several years before, so that there
would be a basis of comparison.
The student received a very high
"A" on the exam.
The professor suspected an
Honor Code violation, because the
man had been doing C or D work
in the course before.
In a letter written to the pro
fessor and enclosed in the com
pleted exam, the student stated
that he had taken two hours and
twenty minutes for the two-hour
exam, and that he had "scanned"
it quickly when he first got it.
He studied for one and one-half
weeks before taking it.
Half of the exam was "open
book." and half "closed book."
The man did almost equally well
on both halves, though "scanning"
would not have helped him much
for the "open book" portion.
Council Decision
Council decided that the stu
dent's understanding of the ma
terial, as indicated by the "open
book" exam, was excellent.
He had testified that he studied
with a student from Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology,
and a student from Stanford
while in the Army.
On the basis of the questions,
Council decided that the student
could not have learned much of
value in scanning the exam, and
that since the Honor Code forbids
"giving or receiving unpermitted
aid," he was not guilty of a viola
tion.

got out, but apparently did little
to stop the Stanford students.
He was not a student, but had
been visiting a friend on campus,
and was sleeping in his car. He
told police that he had not resisted
the Stanford students because of
their size.
After driving away with the
rack, the Stanford students went
home, attracting the attention of
the police en route. The police
reported the matter to the Dean
of Men, who subsequently turned
it over to Men's Council.
The acquitted student testified
that he had not participated al
though he had been present. Coun
cil accepted his testimony and
plea of not guilty.
Corp Yard Hours
The student who had removed
the rack received a penalty of 15
corporation yard hours, to be
worked by the end of this quarter.
The other convicted student re
ceived a penalty of 10 hours.
In action involving a possible
Honor Code violation. Judicial
Council acquit led a man suspected
of cheating while making up a
final examination during service
in the Army.
The student had left school sev
eral years ago to go into the serv
ice, necessarily taking five incom
pletes. While in the Army he ar
ranged with his professor to
make up one of his incompletes
by taking the final exain, which
he had missed, by mail.
Very Higrh "A"
The professor sent him an ex
amination which had been used
several years before, so that there
would be a basis of comparison.
The student received a very high
"A" on the exam.
The professor suspected an
Honor Code violation, because the
man had been doing C or D work
in the course before.
In a letter written to the pro
fessor and enclosed in the com
pleted exam, the student stated
that he had taken two hours and
twenty minutes for the two-hour
exam, and that he had "scanned"
it quickly when he first got it.
He studied for one and one-half
weeks before taking it.
Half of the exam was "open
book." and half "closed book."
The man did almost equally well
on both halves, though "scanning"
would not have helped him much
for the "open book" portion.
Council Decision
Council decided that the stu
dent's understanding of the ma
terial, as indicated by the "open
book" exam, was excellent.
He had testified that he studied
with a student from Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology,
and a student from Stanford
while in the Army.
On the basis of the questions,
Council decided that the student
could not have learned much of
value in scanning the exam, and
that since the Honor Code forbids
"giving or receiving unpermitted
aid," he was not guilty of a viola
tion.
In accordance with the Funda
mental Standard and the Honor

in two cases of violations by Stan

Men's Council convicted two
students and acquitted a third ac

Violation involving the petty theft
of an automobile ski rack.
The group was returning to
campus one evening, when they
noticed a parked car with a ski

they had been drinking.
One of the two students con
