# A 						Newspaper's Role
## 
### 
Thi.rk to be some misconception on the
part of some students as to what constitutes a
student operated newspaper on university
campuses.
The purpose of such a publication is quite
clear: to disseminate news to the campus at
large about primarily local happenings and
secondarily, nationally and internationally sig
nificant events.
15ut a campus newspaper lias a much more
comprehensive responsibility to its readers. It
must also instruct, entertain and—of great im
portance —it must act as an investigative body
as a means for protecting students' interests.
A newspaper is divided into six categories,
one of which is advertising which need not be
discussed here. The other five are news, fea
ture, sports, column and editorial.
The purpose of the news section is self
evident. News stories must be as objective as it
is possible lor them to be. The prominence of
a story as far as position on the page, length
and thoroughness of coverage depends upon the
skill of both the writer of the storv and the ex
perience and judging ability of the news editor.
I he news editor learns how to evaluate the
worth of a story through the experience of
working lip through the staff. He is also advised
in his work by the Associate Editor who has
final authority.
Features are stories that have no definite news
value, but are usuallv either entertaining or in
structing. The writer of a feature is allowed
to inject more of his own personality into his

writing. His stories are usually by-lined also.
The category of sports differs little from that
of news and features, hut the style of sports writ
ing: is usually more colorful and pure objectivity
is often sacrificed to create more interest. Sports
writing contains its own type of column which
is quite similar to the regular column.
Column writers have much more freedom in
writing than news or feature writers. The first
person is often used iu columns and the personal
opinion of the writer is allowed to hold free
rein, within certain bounds, of course.
Editorials are reserved to members of the edi
torial board and reflect the personal opinions
of the editor. Though often written by persons
other than the editor, the opinions expressed
are to be assumed to coincide with those of the
editor.
Editorials are not required to be ob jective at
all. nor are they required to reflect the opinion
of the readers. The pronoun "we" is used rather
than "I purely because it is journalistic usage.
Such use does not mean the editorial speaks
for the stall, the editorial board nor the readers.
Editorials are also not restricted to any set of
topics but should he timely. They are meant to
advise or instruct, and sometimes to entertain.
Often thev do none of these things, but not all
editorials can be first class productions.
Often they luirt people's feelings and some
times they are warmly appreciated. But which
ever way they are received, it is far better to
have a paper with an editorial section than to
have one without.
