"Los Miserables"
". . . Among modern Western nations, France
has become a symbol of instability, insolvency
and corruption. . .
". . . Is the United States headed for the same
kind of demoralization that has afflictcd
France?" (Stanford Daily, Jan. 14.)
No, the United States will never go so far
down. It takes many years of humor, French
cooking and "cabarets" to fall to this advanced
state of corruption and decadence! . . . Alas,
pretty soon, instead of enjoying the "gay Paris,"
American people will have to he satisfied with
strip-teases in San Francisco. . . . For French
people will without doubt commit suicide in an
immense barrel of wine.

"Income Tax Is Topic" . . . Yes, but let us
take the opportunity to talk about poor France.

Oiiarlerlv Statement 011 Sex
Editor, The Daily:
Term having opened, it seems fit for me to
make my Quarterly Statement on Sex. The
business of registration inevitably arouses senti
ments on this delicate issue. Having registered
as Jayne Mansfield or Pee Wee O'Neill IV, on a
dozen or more cards, one is impertinently faced
with the question of one's SEX. Should one
repIy—SOMETIMES, REPRESSED or UNDE
CIDED? Are we intended to answer this ques
tion imaginatively, is it an official channel for
self-expression or is it designed to force upon us
an intelligent encounter, classification and dis
missal of those libidinal energies to be subli
mated upon payment of tuition fees?

"Los Miserables"
". . . Among modern Western nations, France
has become a symbol of instability, insolvency
and corruption. . .
". . . Is the United States headed for the same
kind of demoralization that has afflictcd
France?" (Stanford Daily, Jan. 14.)
No, the United States will never go so far
down. It takes many years of humor, French
cooking and "cabarets" to fall to this advanced
state of corruption and decadence! . . . Alas,
pretty soon, instead of enjoying the "gay Paris,"
American people will have to he satisfied with
strip-teases in San Francisco. . . . For French
people will without doubt commit suicide in an
immense barrel of wine.

"Income Tax Is Topic" . . . Yes, but let us
take the opportunity to talk about poor France.

Oiiarlerlv Statement 011 Sex
Editor, The Daily:
Term having opened, it seems fit for me to
make my Quarterly Statement on Sex. The
business of registration inevitably arouses senti
ments on this delicate issue. Having registered
as Jayne Mansfield or Pee Wee O'Neill IV, on a
dozen or more cards, one is impertinently faced
with the question of one's SEX. Should one
repIy—SOMETIMES, REPRESSED or UNDE
CIDED? Are we intended to answer this ques
tion imaginatively, is it an official channel for
self-expression or is it designed to force upon us
an intelligent encounter, classification and dis
missal of those libidinal energies to be subli
mated upon payment of tuition fees?
