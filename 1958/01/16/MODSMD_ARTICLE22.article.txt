"What is it?"
This question has doubtless
come into the mind of many a
Florence Moore resident as she
walked along a path leading from
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to Moore
Hall.
As a public service to its read
ers The Daily presents the story
behind the miniature swamp and
mountain range in this area.
The swamp, as of yesterday af
ternoon, measured approximately
70 feet long and 20 feet wide at
its extremities. Its depth varied
from four to six inches at its
deepest points.
The muddy shores are dotted
with various species of weeds and
bright yellow mustard flowers.
Due south from this picturesque
mosquito breeding ground is a
mound of earth, rising to a tow
ering height of 12 feet above
gwtund level at its summit.
Majestic Peak
On the north slope of this
majestic peak are six and one
half bags filled with high-grade
gravel and two more empty bags
which presumably also contained
some of the same substance.
The lowland area between the
mountain and the swamp is dot
ted with numerous small pud
files, criss-crossed with the tracks
of wheeled vehicles arid covered
with uprooted survey stakes and
ground cover of dubious ancestry
(weeds).
Probable theories regarding
the uses of this area may have
included: an ROTO obstacle
course; a survey class practice
ground; a horticultural experi
mentation area.
But the Corporation Yard and
the University Planning Office"
have a simple explanation for
this campus eyesore.
Surplus Dirt
Dirk C. Schroder, University
grounds foreman, explained lhat
the earthen mound was simply a
pile of surplus dirt salvaged from
the construction of Florence
Moore Hall, and that as fill or
topsoil was needed, it would be
reduced to ground level.
He had no answer to the query
regarding future plans for the
swamp area.
Plans for- this area are far in
the future as revealed by the Uni
versity Planning Office. As soon
as Tresidder Memorial and the
new student offices are construct
ed, it is to be integrated into a
large parking area for the "stu
dent activities complex."
So will perish the mudhole and
the mountain. Time marches on,
and soon the sleepy lagoon and
the lofty mountain will be re
duced to just another parking
area.

large parking area for the "stu
dent activities complex."
So will perish the mudhole and
the mountain. Time marches on,
and soon the sleepy lagoon and
the lofty mountain will be re
duced to just another parking
area.
"What is it?"
This question has doubtless
come into the mind of many a
Florence Moore resident as she
walked along a path leading from
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to Moore
Hall.
As a public service to its read
ers The Daily presents the story
behind the miniature swamp and
mountain range in this area.
The swamp, as of yesterday af
ternoon, measured approximately
70 feet long and 20 feet wide at
its extremities. Its depth varied
from four to six inches at its
deepest points.
The muddy shores are dotted
with various species of weeds and
bright yellow mustard flowers.
Due south from this picturesque
mosquito breeding ground is a
mound of earth, rising to a tow
ering height of 12 feet above
gwtund level at its summit.
Majestic Peak
On the north slope of this
majestic peak are six and one
half bags filled with high-grade
gravel and two more empty bags
which presumably also contained
some of the same substance.
The lowland area between the
mountain and the swamp is dot
ted with numerous small pud
files, criss-crossed with the tracks
of wheeled vehicles arid covered
with uprooted survey stakes and
ground cover of dubious ancestry
(weeds).
Probable theories regarding
the uses of this area may have
included: an ROTO obstacle
course; a survey class practice
ground; a horticultural experi
mentation area.
But the Corporation Yard and
the University Planning Office"
have a simple explanation for
this campus eyesore.
Surplus Dirt
Dirk C. Schroder, University
grounds foreman, explained lhat
the earthen mound was simply a
pile of surplus dirt salvaged from
the construction of Florence
Moore Hall, and that as fill or
topsoil was needed, it would be
reduced to ground level.
He had no answer to the query
regarding future plans for the
swamp area.
Plans for- this area are far in
the future as revealed by the Uni
versity Planning Office. As soon
as Tresidder Memorial and the
new student offices are construct
ed, it is to be integrated into a
large parking area for the "stu
dent activities complex."
So will perish the mudhole and

and soon the sleepy lagoon and
