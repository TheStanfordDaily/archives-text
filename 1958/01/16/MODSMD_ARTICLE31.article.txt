# Daily Scouts California; Varsity, Frosh Prepare
## Robinson, Kapp Fail to Meet Expectations 
### John Schwarz Sieve Baffrey 
Editor's Note: Daily sports
writer went to Now York for
The Daily to scout California
in the semi finals of the Holi
day Festival al Madison Square
Garden. This is Hie second and
final part of his report.

P,y using four players at the
two forward posts Conch Newell
keeps two fresh forwards in the
game almost all the time. He
usually starts Dalton and Sterling
with Schneider and Grout stand
ing by to fill in.
If any of iho four candidates
could prove himself consistently
adequate, Newell would be will
ing to abandon his two platoon
ing; bui so far there hasn't been
a standout.
Of the four, Schneider is the
most promising, although Newell
has ranked him fourth man of the
quartet. In the second half of the
season, after these four forwards
get more experience Cal should be
a lot tougher, for this is by far
the weakest spot on the team and J
ii has held Cal back from realiz
ing her potential so far this year.
Top Guards
In A 1 Buch and Robinson, Cal'
has one of the best guard combi
nations in the country. Robinson,
who was ranked among the stars !
of the PCC in Iho pro-season re
ports, oddly enough finds himself
as No. 2 guard on the team, be
hind Buch.
Buch, second string on last
year's squad, has definitely boon
the spark plug who has kept Cal!
going this year. Flo sets up most !
of the plays, calms the more in
experienced players and plays a I
hustling game from beginning to
end.
Against Dayton it was Buch |
who stole the ball three times in
(he bust few minutes to score J
easy lay-ups, and it was also he j
who made two foul shots with less I
than a minute to play which knot •
led up the score and allowed Call
to go on to win the game in over-1
time.
Eastern Style
Buch uses an over-the-head two- j
hand sot shot, which is a rather
odd sight to most Westerners who I
;ire used to seeing exclusive use |
of the one-hand shot. Buch learn-1
ed and developed this weapon as I
a high school player in Brooklyn, i
Ho not only shoots this two-!
bander from all over the court i
but also shoots his fouls the same
way.
Robinson, the other starting j
guard, has had his troubles so far
this season. It appeared in the!
Dayton game that the Bear cap
lain was pressing too hard. Per-;
haps, being the old pro of the
club, Robinson felt it was his per
sonal task to carry the team. He
threw the ball away on many oc
casions with sloppy passes, and j
he struggled to got shots off that j
quite often completely missed the
rim.
It was this type of play that j
forced Newell to bench Robinson j
somewhere near the end of the
first half of the season. Even;
though Robinson has not yet
reached the peak he attained last
year, he still is a very dangerous
player—one who might cause
quite a lot of trouble for the op
position.
Jump Shot Best
His jump shot, which is his best
offensive weapon, is still one of
the best around; and as a hustler
and a morale builder Robinson
has always ranked at the top.
On the bench Cal has the famil
iar Joe Kapp. Kapp, who came to
Cal primarily as a basketball play
er, became a pleasant surprise on
the football team.
It is.probably this football play
ing, though, that has hurt Kapp's j
basketball chances. His having to ;
report late for pre-soason practice
has bothered his shooting eye
quilo a bit, and throughout most
of last season and part of this one
he has not been able to shed his
football shoes.
He's a rugged rebounder who
can play either guard or forward, I
and his tremendous natural ath- \
leti<- ability and spirit are very j
evident in his play. The biggest !
thing holding back Kapp is this j
failure to develop a consistent
shooting percentage.
Among the other reserves on 1

the squad are John Fitzpatriek.
who has filled in fairly well for
Robinson on many occasions this
season, and Daryl Imhoff, big re
serve center.
The most impressive feature of
the Cal s q u a d is undoubtedly
team unity; especially on defense,
but on offense as well. There
never appears to be one scoring
star who is continually fed; it's
always "Work the ball to the man
with the best shot."
On defense everyone on the
starting five, including the inex
perienced forwards, shines in
Cal's extremely efficient switch
ing man to man. The squad, since
it works so well as a unit, has de
veloped a great deal of team spir
it, and most probably that spirit
will be just about double when
Stanford meets Cal Friday night
at Berkeley.

Stanford's Indians shift inio high gear in the preparations depart
ment today with eyes toward both the California game tomorrow
night in Berkeley and the Oregon State contest slated for the Pa
vilioti 011 Monday.
Although the local quintet will go through a light workout or

I Sunday in preparation for OSC,
the major part of their readying
I for the two games will bo com
! pleted this afternoon. And they'll
i be doing it all without the serv-
I ices of starting forward Chris
Burford.
Burford is suffering from ton
sillitis and will bo a doubtful
starter in Friday night's hassle.
I Dallmar expects Doug Warren to
I open in Burfnrd's place.
Bears Favored
The Indian menlor expects the
game to bo a close one oven
though the locals are currently
sot 10 points below the Golden
I Boars. "II will take overall im
provement and consistency in or
der to lake Cal," ho said.
This week the squad has
worked on methods to overcome
the successful California press
and defensive prowess which con
| tained Washington State so well
last week, lotting them sink only
32 points.
Offensive work toward gaining
more polish and "working toward
the bettor shot" were also on the
locals' docket.
Arrillaga Leads 1
Sophomore John Arrillaga con
tinues to load the Stanford scor
ing parade according to statistics
released yesterday. His totals in
clude 69 field goals and 25 free
throws for 1(5.3 points. Captain
Paul Neumann (117) and Dick
| Haga (113) follow in that order,
j Neumann is only one-tenth of
a percentage point behind Arril
laga's 38.5 field goal mark. Ar
! rillaga's average-points-per-game
mark is 13.6, Neumann's stands
at 12.2 and Haga is 8.7.
Haga loads the team in Iho ro
"b«Vinding department wil+j 105
snares from the backboards. Six
eight center Neal Brockmeyor
follows the leader wilh 60.
Besides the starters, Dallmar
will bo counting heavily on the
services of Mike Tipton, Jerry
; Thuesen and John Stabler in the
j games coming up.
