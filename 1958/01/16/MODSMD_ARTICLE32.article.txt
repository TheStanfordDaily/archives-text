# PCC Statistics Indicate Many Card Weak Spots
## 
### 
Stanford's problems in this year's PCC basketball race might be
traced to the Cards' poor rebounding and shooting percentages.
The Indians, according to the latest PCC statistics sheet, find
themselves seventh in rebounding with a percentage of .'172 and in
the same spot in field gonl percentage with a .333 average.

The only department in which
ihc Indian five is rated in 1 ho
upper half of the league is free
ill row percentage. The Indians,
who at one lime this year led the
FCC and were third in the coun
try in this department, fell to
third in the PCC with a .676 aver
age.
The Indians' standings in other
departments are fifth in total de
fense with a 61.0 average, fifth
in total scoring with a 55.5 aver
age, and last in field goal defense
with a .435 percentage.
Another interesting fact includ
ed in the statistics was the out
standing defense average held by
the California Bears. The Berke
ley ites have allowed only 43.51
points per game.
Should Cal continue at this j
pace, it would he the best per- |
formanee in the conference since
another California team allowed
a 42.3 point average in 1948.
Fortunately for the rest of the;
league, the Bears are last in total
scoring with a 49.0 average, and
next to last in shooting average |
with a poor .289 percentage.
