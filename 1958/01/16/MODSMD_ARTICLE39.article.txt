## 
### 
Firs) stringers are scheduled
to go all the way Friday night
when Stanford's yearlings meet
Ihe California Cubs at Berkeley
in what promises to he one of I lie
host freshman tilts of Ihe year.
Last weekend Stanford easily
defeated high school teams on the
strength of their second and third
teams. Tomorrow night the story
is likely to be quite different.
California dropped a three-point
decision to the St. Marys fresh
men, a team which handed the
Papooses their sole defeat this
year that by 15 points.
Papoose Coach Bill Turner re
gards ihe Cubs as "the top Frosh
team in this area."
High-scoring guard Eric Sehultz
(6-4 ) and lanky (6-G) center Stan
Morrison backbone Cal's well
balanced quintet.
Coach Turner yesterday opti
mistically declared, "The boys
haven't had a good shooting night
even though they boast a 4-1
record.
"They're about due, and I'd like
to see a good contest with Cal
that means two or three of the
fellows hitting consistently."
