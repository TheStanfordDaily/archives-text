## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P> President
Eisenhower said yesterday he
would rather go in for red ink
than hold his budget in balance
by boosting taxes at this lime.
The man who has been proud
of his record of maintaining a
balanced budget appeared to ac
cept the idea thai the one he sent
Congress Monday tnay be tipped
into the red.
In that event, and if income is
down, he said, "Then it would
seem to me it would be a bad time
to raise taxes, because you want
the economy to . . . have a lit lie
needle; a needle, rather than a
check rein on if."
Up until business slacked off
and defense spending went up in
the wake of Soviet Sputniks, Ei
senhower's budget for this year
was being kept in balance for
the third year in a row. Now it
looks as if it will show a $400
million deficit next June 30.
For the new fiscal year start
ing July 1, Eisenhower is predict
ing a half - billion - dollar surplus
and banking on his advisers to
be right on predictions that busi
ness soon will swing up again
and tax receipts along with it.
But there are some indications
that Congress may not want to
economize on some items as
much as Eisenhower does and
may try to increase military
spending more.
