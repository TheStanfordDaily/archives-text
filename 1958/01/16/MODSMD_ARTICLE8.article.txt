## Ex-Utah Governor Claims Taxation Unconstitutional 
### Barbara Hicks 
Denouncing the income lax and
foreign akl. J. Bracken Lee,
chairman of For America and
former governor of Utah, spoke
to a small but receptive audience
at the Political Union meeting
last in DinkclspicJ Audito
rium.
Contending that government
spending for foreign aid is un
constitutional, immoral and dis
honest, the former governor said
the government is destroying the
backbone of the nation, the work
er, by stealing money from him.
While people are looking up at.
the sky fearing Sputnik, the gov
ernment is picking their pockets,
said Lee, and hence causing a
program of inflation.
"If you give the government
too much money, it will find a
way to spend it," Lee said. Mon
ey brings power and anyone is
likely to abuse power, the For
America chairman continued.
Abuse of Power
In order to stop the abuse of
power by the federal government
we must limit that government,
he went on.
Lee pointed to New Deal legis
lation, some of which was decided
unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court, but this legislation was
defended as "best for the people,"
he said.
"If government is given the
power to decide what is 'best for
the people,' no longer do you
have any right to question in
court the constitutionality of any
law passed by Congress as it will
be defended on this basis," Lee
said.
"Giving this power to Congress
today may seem fine, but it will
be turned against you in the fu
ture," according to the speaker.
"That's what happened to the
16th Amendment which was origi
nally designed to tax the rich.
Now 83 per cent of the tax is paid
by those earning under $6000 a
year. •
No Constitution
"My opinion is that you have
no Constitution at all if unlimited
power is given to Congress on
the basis of "general welfare,"
Lee said.
"I contend that there is no dif
ference between an all-powerful
central government in Washing
ton and an all-powerful central
government in Moscow. Bureauc
racy is an immoral thing, leading
to the destruction of the Ameri
can people."
Citing the Hoover Commission
Report as one way to economize
in government, the former gov
ernor contended that the federal
government could be run for one
half its present cost, "hurting
only those who shouldn't be in
the government anyway."
Lee continued that, we are
courting trouble with our army
scattered all over the globe and
noted "the more we put into the
farm program the worse it gets."
Slop Spending
"There is no way to stop spend
ing in government except to take
the money away," Lee said, which
he proposes to do by repealing
the Income Tax (16th) Amend
ment.
"When the people have the
money back in their hands, the
people will again he running the
government, instead of the gov
ernment running them," the
speaker said.
Pete Grot he, graduate student
in political science and former
Daily sports editor, presented an
alternative point of view, saying:
"To do away with the income
lax is to render the government
inoperable."

Slop Spending
"There is no way to stop spend
ing in government except to take
the money away," Lee said, which
he proposes to do by repealing
the Income Tax (16th) Amend
ment.
"When the people have the
money back in their hands, the
people will again he running the
government, instead of the gov
ernment running them," the
speaker said.
Pete Grot he, graduate student
in political science and former
Daily sports editor, presented an
alternative point of view, saying:
"To do away with the income
lax is to render the government
inoperable."
Denouncing the income lax and
foreign akl. J. Bracken Lee,
chairman of For America and
former governor of Utah, spoke
to a small but receptive audience
at the Political Union meeting
last in DinkclspicJ Audito
rium.
Contending that government
spending for foreign aid is un
constitutional, immoral and dis
honest, the former governor said
the government is destroying the
backbone of the nation, the work
er, by stealing money from him.
While people are looking up at.
the sky fearing Sputnik, the gov
ernment is picking their pockets,
said Lee, and hence causing a
program of inflation.
"If you give the government
too much money, it will find a
way to spend it," Lee said. Mon
ey brings power and anyone is
likely to abuse power, the For
America chairman continued.
Abuse of Power
In order to stop the abuse of
power by the federal government
we must limit that government,
he went on.
Lee pointed to New Deal legis
lation, some of which was decided
unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court, but this legislation was
defended as "best for the people,"
he said.
"If government is given the
power to decide what is 'best for
the people,' no longer do you
have any right to question in
court the constitutionality of any
law passed by Congress as it will
be defended on this basis," Lee
said.
"Giving this power to Congress
today may seem fine, but it will
be turned against you in the fu
ture," according to the speaker.
"That's what happened to the
16th Amendment which was origi
nally designed to tax the rich.
Now 83 per cent of the tax is paid
by those earning under $6000 a
year. •
No Constitution
"My opinion is that you have
no Constitution at all if unlimited
power is given to Congress on
the basis of "general welfare,"
Lee said.
"I contend that there is no dif
ference between an all-powerful
central government in Washing
ton and an all-powerful central
government in Moscow. Bureauc
racy is an immoral thing, leading
to the destruction of the Ameri
can people."
Citing the Hoover Commission
Report as one way to economize
in government, the former gov
ernor contended that the federal
government could be run for one
half its present cost, "hurting
only those who shouldn't be in
the government anyway."
Lee continued that, we are
courting trouble with our army
scattered all over the globe and
noted "the more we put into the
