job in 1938, and took over as head
man in 1940. He won two con
ference titles before leaving for
the Navy. -
Curtice returned to coach Texas
Western in the Border Confer
ence, and directed his teams to a
pair of national rushing titles. He
is believed to be the only coach
in the country to have coached
teams to NCAA titles in both
rushing and passing.
Stanford's new coach is in his
fifth year as a member of the
NCAA football rules committee,
and is a trustee of the American
Football Coaches Association.
53-Day-Old Hunt
Yesterday's statement brings
to an end the hunt which began
53 days ago with the announce
ment of Taylor's resignation. The
feeling ever since the Shrine game
in late December has been that
Curtice was the man for the job.
His name hold a big lead in the
rumor derby throughout the past
throe weeks, although occasion;'!
challengers would pop up and
then fade out again.
Things began to take definite
shape early this week with the

announcement that the Athletic
Board would name a candidate
before yesterday's Trustees meet
ing.
Prediction
When this became known, The
Daily wrote on Tuesday that
Curtice would be officially named
at 2 p.m. yesterday, a prediction
that proved accurate to the min
ute.
It was definite that he would
take the job three hours earlier,
however, when he announced his
resignation as Utah coach and
athletic director.
Curtice becomes the 22nd head
coach in Stanford football history,
but only the sixth since 1924.
