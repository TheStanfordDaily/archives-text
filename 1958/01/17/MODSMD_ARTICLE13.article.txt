# Professor Calls for Policy Of Non-violent Resistance
## Sibley Says Complete Disarmament Solution for American 'Militarism' 
### Stew Toy, Associate Editor 
Visiting Professor Mulford Sibley yesterday called for a program
of "non-violent resistance" as the "only possible" foreign policy for
modern America, in a Bowman Alumni House talk sponsored by the
Institute of International Relations.
Sibley, a professor of political science at the University of Minne-

sota, said the United States has
based its foreign policy since
World War II on "negotiation
through strength," or a military
build-up to give us "breathing
space" for talks with the Soviet
Union.
He showed the history of the
post-War Soviet-American con
flict as being based on mutual
fear. The United States, he said,
emerged from World War II as
the world's dominant power, and,
like all great powers, immediate
ly began to fear the loss of that
power.
The result, Sibley said, has
been a "Utopian and unrealistic
foreign policy based on militar
ism."
I.atcst Evidence
Latest evidence of American
reliance on military strength is
the current Sputnik and missile
scare, he said. "We're talking
about missiles as we would about
bread for starving people. That
to me is shocking. America's im
plicit faith in military might is
her main fault."
Sibley called for complete dis
armament as the only solution
to American "militarism." lie
pointed out that critics of dis
armament have no basis for judg
ment because "no major power
has ever Iried a serious disarma
ment policy." He distinguished
between disarmament and the
various pre-World War II agree
ments, calling Ihe latter "arms
limiting agreements."
"Only Course"
Sibley suggested a "three
pronged policy" based on "non
violent resistance" as America's
only possible course:
Complete disarmament. The
United States must disarm uni
laterally if necessary.
Foreign economic aid. America
can best accomplish her goal of
winning Ihe world's neutral coun
tries by keeping her promise to
develop the world economically.
Orientation of the American
people toward disarmament. This
could be accomplished by con
vincing the "elite." "The masses
of mankind are passive. They fol
low their leaders."
