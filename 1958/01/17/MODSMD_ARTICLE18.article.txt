# Welcome, Jack Curtice
## 
### 
We heartily applaud the appointment of J ark
Curtice as head Stanford football coach. e
further praise the University for acquiring a
man who is not just a football coach for win
ning's sake, but who teaches the game with an
eye toward helping the men who play it.
Jack Curtice's football philosophy is a
simple one —"Let the kids have fun." It may
he short in words, but it is long on meaning.
There are too many schools in the country
where football isn't played for fun anymore;
it's played to win and make money. The care
isn't whether or not the players are getting
anything out of it, it's whether or not they're
killing themselves to make a few bucks for
university.
This isn't to say we shouldn't play to win at
Stanford. After all, who ever played to lose?
It's just that there are various ways to play to
win, and we think the Curtice method, like the
Taylor method, is the right one.
If anyone might still have doubts about
Curtice's ideas on pressure football, the fact
that he took the Stanford job but told Texas

A&M he didn't care to go there to look over
the situation should serve to dispel these
doubts.
Curtice's ideas on football lie in exactly
with those of l)r. Wallace Sterling, who is all
for football —in its proper place. Curtice, in
a phone interview with The Daily yesterday,
said "1 hope athletics is in its proportion
at Stanford."
Among the most encouraging aspects of the
hiring is the fact that Curtice is a roach on his
way up. Some of the candidates mentioned
were men who had already reached a peak;
others seemed to have not really gotten started;
but Curtice has a good deal of experience be
hind him on his steady climb up the coaching
ladder.
Finally, Stanford has also gotten a man who,
unlike some coaches, has the highest of personal
reputations. The entire Curtice family should
be a credit to the Stanford scene.
Best of luck to you, Coach Jack, for the
coming seasons at Stanford.

Curtice's ideas on pressure football, the fact
that he took the Stanford job but told Texas

A&M he didn't care to go there to look over
the situation should serve to dispel these
doubts.
Curtice's ideas on football lie in exactly
with those of l)r. Wallace Sterling, who is all
for football —in its proper place. Curtice, in
a phone interview with The Daily yesterday,
said "1 hope athletics is in its proportion
at Stanford."
Among the most encouraging aspects of the
hiring is the fact that Curtice is a roach on his
way up. Some of the candidates mentioned
were men who had already reached a peak;
others seemed to have not really gotten started;
but Curtice has a good deal of experience be
hind him on his steady climb up the coaching
ladder.
Finally, Stanford has also gotten a man who,
unlike some coaches, has the highest of personal
reputations. The entire Curtice family should
be a credit to the Stanford scene.
Best of luck to you, Coach Jack, for the
coming seasons at Stanford.
We heartily applaud the appointment of J ark
Curtice as head Stanford football coach. e
further praise the University for acquiring a
man who is not just a football coach for win
ning's sake, but who teaches the game with an
eye toward helping the men who play it.
Jack Curtice's football philosophy is a
simple one —"Let the kids have fun." It may
he short in words, but it is long on meaning.
There are too many schools in the country
where football isn't played for fun anymore;
it's played to win and make money. The care
isn't whether or not the players are getting
anything out of it, it's whether or not they're
killing themselves to make a few bucks for
university.
This isn't to say we shouldn't play to win at
Stanford. After all, who ever played to lose?
It's just that there are various ways to play to
win, and we think the Curtice method, like the
Taylor method, is the right one.
If anyone might still have doubts about
Curtice's ideas on pressure football, the fact
that he took the Stanford job but told Texas

A&M he didn't care to go there to look over
the situation should serve to dispel these
doubts.
