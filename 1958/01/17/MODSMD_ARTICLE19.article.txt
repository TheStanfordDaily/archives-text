## USC Debates 'Lady Godiva Issue 
### Barbara Hicks 
It's comedy time at the University of South
ern California according to a report in the SC
Daily Trojan. At a recent meeting of the USC
Senate, Commerce President Wally Graner pro
posed having songleaders who are proficient ma
jorettes. Dan Cassidy countered this proposal
with "Having a girl majorette leading the band
would be like having Lady Godiva ride out on
the horse instead of Tommy Trojan." Graner's
answer: "Lady Godiva might be an improve
ment." Maybe so.

The Cornell Daily Sun thinks that 1957 will go
down in history as the year that the people fi
nally woke up to the state of American educa
tion and that 1958 may be the year they did
something about it. The Sun praises the recent
Administration plan of $1 billion for scholarships
and fellowships. Though disturbed by the em
phasis on training for science and mathematics,
the Sun thinks the move indicates a promising
start. The writers do not feel that the ultimate
aim of education is the protection and security of
the United States, but that once the proper scope
of aid is determined, the government may go
on to cure constructively the ills that this coun
try is now facing.

"Lack of security produced by the cold war
and a good religious climate have brought an
upsurge in religious interest at Kansas Univer
sity," the columns of the Daily Kansan declared

recently. "The reason for this greater interest
is that people can go to church, take religious
courses and talk about religion and nobody feels
you're a sissy or sentimental," says the dean of
the KU School of Religion. "Also there isn't any
doubt that conditions of life today are such that
the foundations of life are knocked from under
us and we are looking for some kind of security."

"An unidentified man, about 30 years old, en
tered Susan Campbell frosh women's dorm re
cently wearing only a pair of shoes," reports the
University of Oregon Daily Emerald. "No dorm
residents were harmed by the man." First Lady
Godiva; now this.

"The social restrictions common here are al
most unheard of in England, where the univer
sity exercises little or no control over any but
the academic phases of the student's life," the
Illinois Institute of Technology News says.
"Some of the features of campus life which are
lacking include such things as: campus cops,
curfew restrictions for girls, compulsory chape
roning and registration of social events. The
stand of the university regarding the consump
tion of alcoholic beverages is clarified if one
considers that students often meet the deans at
a 'sherry party'." The News acknowledges, how
ever, that the heavy work loads and lack of funds
hamper a student's social life, and the emphasis
lies on cultural pursuits.
