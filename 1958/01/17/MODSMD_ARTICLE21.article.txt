# Dixieland Wins Approval at Class Program
## Enthusiastic Crowd Hears Turk Murphy, 'Fatha' Hines at Show 
### Margot Zeiss 
Turk Murphy, "Fatha" Hines
and a new blues singer, Barbara
Dane, drew a large, enthusiastic
crowd yesterday in Memorial
Auditorium at the .junior class'
first Dixieland Jamboree.
Turk Murphy's band consists
of the regulation Dixieland in
struments—cornet, piano, banjo,
drums, clarinet and Turk himself
doubling on a baritone and his
famous trombone, with the added
and unexpected attraction of a
tuba.
The Murphy seven won the
heart of the audience right at the
beginning by playing a hot Dixie
land version of "Come Join the
Band." He was followed by Earl
"Fatha" Hines who was intro
duced by the Emcee of the show,
Charlie Stern, a disk jockey from
KROW.
"Fatha" Hines, an old hand at
nightclub jazz as rendered on a
piano, introduced the rest of his
combo—"Pop" Foster, who just
celebrated his 65th birthday, on
the bass and Earl Wat kins on
drums. Interspersing music with
chatter, Hines played several ex
cellent numbers. Included was
"Fine and Dandy" played in
typical Hines style, and a new
and unusual arrangement of
"Moonlight in Vermont." "Pop"
Foster took the lead in a snappy
version of "The World is Waiting
for the Sunrise."
Barbara Dane, who sang with
both the Murphy and Hines
groups, was rather startlingly
dressed in a blue sack dress and
sported a Caroline Jones haircut.
Miss Dane, surprisingly enough
the mother of three children
(eldest age eight), is an old
fashioned blues singer along the
stentorian, Pearl Bailey style.
"Fatha" Hines has recently re
turned from a tour of Scandi
navia, Europe and England, and
is planning a State Department
sponsored tour of Japan, China
and Thailand. In a talk backstage,
Hines told several funny stories
about his European trip and es
pecially his experiences in Eng
land.
It seems as though the pro
verbial English "spot of tea"
proved his downfall. Hines' bus
drivers would drive for several
hours and then feel the pressing
need of tea and crumpets, so
Hines and his boys would spend
45 minutes quaffing tea.
"The English don't believe much
in heat," Hines related. "In one
hotel it was so cold that I kept
the hot water in the bath room
running and heated the room by
steam. One morning I came in to
discover that the plaster was fall
ing off the walls. I of course im
mediately called the manager and
requested another room on the
grounds that the one I occupied
was a mess."

was a mess."
Turk Murphy, "Fatha" Hines
and a new blues singer, Barbara
Dane, drew a large, enthusiastic
crowd yesterday in Memorial
Auditorium at the .junior class'
first Dixieland Jamboree.
Turk Murphy's band consists
of the regulation Dixieland in
struments—cornet, piano, banjo,
drums, clarinet and Turk himself
doubling on a baritone and his
famous trombone, with the added
and unexpected attraction of a
tuba.
The Murphy seven won the
heart of the audience right at the
beginning by playing a hot Dixie
land version of "Come Join the
Band." He was followed by Earl
"Fatha" Hines who was intro
duced by the Emcee of the show,
Charlie Stern, a disk jockey from
KROW.
"Fatha" Hines, an old hand at
nightclub jazz as rendered on a
piano, introduced the rest of his
combo—"Pop" Foster, who just
celebrated his 65th birthday, on
the bass and Earl Wat kins on
drums. Interspersing music with
chatter, Hines played several ex
cellent numbers. Included was
"Fine and Dandy" played in
typical Hines style, and a new
and unusual arrangement of
"Moonlight in Vermont." "Pop"
Foster took the lead in a snappy
version of "The World is Waiting
for the Sunrise."
Barbara Dane, who sang with
both the Murphy and Hines
groups, was rather startlingly
dressed in a blue sack dress and
sported a Caroline Jones haircut.
Miss Dane, surprisingly enough
the mother of three children
(eldest age eight), is an old
fashioned blues singer along the
stentorian, Pearl Bailey style.
"Fatha" Hines has recently re
turned from a tour of Scandi
navia, Europe and England, and
is planning a State Department
sponsored tour of Japan, China
and Thailand. In a talk backstage,
Hines told several funny stories
about his European trip and es
pecially his experiences in Eng
land.
It seems as though the pro
verbial English "spot of tea"
proved his downfall. Hines' bus
drivers would drive for several
hours and then feel the pressing
need of tea and crumpets, so
Hines and his boys would spend
45 minutes quaffing tea.
"The English don't believe much
in heat," Hines related. "In one
hotel it was so cold that I kept
the hot water in the bath room
running and heated the room by
steam. One morning I came in to
discover that the plaster was fall
ing off the walls. I of course im
mediately called the manager and
requested another room on the
grounds that the one I occupied
was a mess."
