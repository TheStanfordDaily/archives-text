A Good Man domes to Stanford
Stanford, thank goodness, is not in the same boat as Texas A&M.
Without a lot of internal bickering and stacks of rejection slips, the
school went out and got itself a good football coach. Jack Curtice's
record and background are contained elsewhere in The Daily; they're
strong recommendations for his appointment and are indicative of
continued success in his new position.
Early in the hunt for a new coach, this column contained an opin
ion that Stanford might do well to move one of the present assistant
coaches up to head coach. Two principal reasons were given for
that opinion:
1. Chuck Taylor's assistants are valuable football men, and could
do ihe University service by remaining on the football staff.
2. Retaining one of the present staff as head coach would insure
Stanford's continuing to play wide-open football—the brand of foot
ball with which they have had the most success and, because of re
cruiting and entrance problems, would most likely continue to be
successful.
A third reason, the "Let's keep it in the family" idea, served prin
cipally to tie in the first and second specific reasons given for the
promoting of one of the assistants.
Within a short time after Chuck Taylor resigned as head coach,
it began to become apparent that an assistant would not get the job,
if for no other reason than that he would probably have been ap
pointed almost coincidentally with Taylor's resignation. So, the
search moved into the outside world.
At the risk of sounding like a bandwagon jumper-oner, we never
theless can honestly say that as soon as we saw the job Curtice did
with the West Shrine team, we were convinced he would merit
strong consideration and was probably the man for the position.
After a few days back on campus, we became convinced he'd get
the job if he wanted it. lie wanted it, and he's got it, and Stanford
has a good man.
We're in for Exciting Football
Now, hovv does Curtice's appointment stack up against Iho rea
sons which were stated here for appointing one of the assistants?
In regard to the second, Stanford's retention of wide-open foot
ball, we're in good shape. Curtice's Utah teams played the passing
game, and were particularly successful with it this year with Lee
Grosscup at the helm. Maybe the flankers will be spaced differently
and maybe the good ol' 39-Power-Reverse-Pass won't come out of the
mothballs, but the Indians will play interesting football.
Now, in regard to the assistants staying at Stanford. Nothing is
official as yet, but it looks as though some will stay, others will
leave. When we talked with Curtice Monday, he said he'd probably
like to keep some of the assistants now here and also bring some of
his own. He repeated this desire again yesterday when we phoned
him at Salt Lake City.
So, it looks as though reason number one for lipping an assistant
will be fulfilled to the degree that some of the staff remains. Of
course, with a new coach coming in, there can be no disputing the
fact that he should have free rein in choosing his aides. It's only
natural that a man should have the right to pick those who shall
serve under him. We have no doubt that the men Curtice brings to
Stanford will be as much a credit to the University and factor toward
giving Stanford good football as were those who will leave.
One aspect of the hiring of Curtice strikes us as quite unusual,
and probably a first in the field of coach hunting. It wasn't inten
tional. of course, but Stanford may well be the first school to get
a coach on a free home trial basis before making up its mind.
Naturally it wasn't the University's idea that Curtice come on
the campus to coach the West Shrine team in December, but it did
furnish a splendid opportunity for Stanford authorities to watch
their new coach in action.
One more thought—Rally Com will have to get their printing
press out and put a new page in their song and yell books. Should
read something like this:
