# Stanford, Bear Cagers Tangle Tonight
## Warren or Thuesen to Go If Burford Is Not Ready 
### Steve Baffrey 
Approximately 500 students, the basketball band and the usual
number of pompon girls and yell leaders will follow the Stanford
Indians to Berkeley tonight when they tangle with the California
Bears in the Cal Men's Gymnasium at 8.
Coach Howie Dallmar reported yesterday that forward Chris Bur-

ford, sidelined on Wednesday
with an apparent attack of tonsil
it is, may he able to start tonight.
Burford worked out with the
squad yesterday.
Otherwise, the Indians are in
fine shape for the game. Yester
day, after viewing films of the
games played last weekend, they
went through a light one-hour
practice session.
While Burford is questionable,
and Doug Warren or Jerry Theu
sen may open in his place, the
other regulars, Paul Neumann,
John Arrillaga, Neal Brockmeyor
and Dick Haga, will start as
usual.
At a quick glance the game
shapes up to be a contest between
a highly-rated Cal defense and a
doubtful Stanford offense or a
match between the teams' leading
scorers, Cal guard Earl Robinson
and Stanford forward John Ar
rillaga.
The Cal senior, who stands (M,
is playing his third year of varsity
ball for the Bears and tops the
squad with 119 points in 12 games
and a 9.9 average. Arrillaga
leads the Indians with 1(13 coun
ters, averaging 13.6.
Offensive Work
From California, however, comes
the report that the Bears have
been working on their offensive
game all week in hope of topping
the locals in this department.
Although his squad has gained
acclaim for its defensive abilities,
head coach Pete Newell has
pointed out that the Bears hit on
only 31 per cent of their shots
against Washington last weekend
in downing the Huskies 49-42.
Against Washington State last
Saturday they hit even less, 27
per cent, but again shined in the
defensive department, limiting
the Cougars to 32 points while
dumping in 47.
This week the emphasis has
been on "getting the ball into the
hole. A team doesn't usually win
hitting on the per centages we've
had. Our defensive play has
forced us to operate this way. but
this defense can't last forever.
Or Else
"It's clear that we'll have to
shoot better in the future or else
get knocked off. The only game
we've actually hit well in was the
Washington game (played in
Seattle and won by Call." Last
year at I his time the defending
Pacific Coast Champions were
popping in shots at a 40 per cenl
clip.
The Bears' season record stands
at 7-5 contrasted to the Indians'
6-7. In Conference play the Bears
are 3-1 with two wins over Wash
ington, and one over Washing
ton State. In their conference
opener Ihey lost to Oregon State
in Corvallis.

In pre-eonferenco games Call
fornia topped San Jose State and
St. Mary's (the latter in double
overtime) and lost to USF, Kan
sas Stale and Kansas before going
on to the Holiday Festival Tour
nament in New York. There they
beat N.Y.IJ. in the opening round,
came from behind in the final
minutes to tie and beat Dayton
60-55 in overtime in the semi- 1
finals, and dropped their final
round encounter to Temple by ten
points.
Mutual Opponents
Against mutual opponents the
Indians have topped St. Mary's in
regulation time, beaten USF in
the final seconds, lost to San Jose
State, and split with Washington
State, and lost to Washington.
This weekend could be an im
portant one for the Bears who
still have hopes of reconquering
their PCC title. Sports fans in
Berkeley are eyeing the Bears'
weekend games against Stanford
and Oregon State as cues to Bear
expectancy for the rest of the
season. Oregon State plays here
on Monday night.

DOUG WARREN—MAY REPLACE BURFORD
Approximately 500 students, the basketball band and the usual
number of pompon girls and yell leaders will follow the Stanford
Indians to Berkeley tonight when they tangle with the California
Bears in the Cal Men's Gymnasium at 8.
Coach Howie Dallmar reported yesterday that forward Chris Bur-

ford, sidelined on Wednesday
with an apparent attack of tonsil
it is, may he able to start tonight.
Burford worked out with the
squad yesterday.
Otherwise, the Indians are in
fine shape for the game. Yester
day, after viewing films of the
games played last weekend, they
went through a light one-hour
practice session.
While Burford is questionable,
and Doug Warren or Jerry Theu
sen may open in his place, the
other regulars, Paul Neumann,
John Arrillaga, Neal Brockmeyor
and Dick Haga, will start as
usual.
At a quick glance the game
shapes up to be a contest between
a highly-rated Cal defense and a
doubtful Stanford offense or a
match between the teams' leading
scorers, Cal guard Earl Robinson
and Stanford forward John Ar
rillaga.
The Cal senior, who stands (M,
is playing his third year of varsity
ball for the Bears and tops the
squad with 119 points in 12 games
and a 9.9 average. Arrillaga
leads the Indians with 1(13 coun
ters, averaging 13.6.
Offensive Work
From California, however, comes
the report that the Bears have
been working on their offensive
game all week in hope of topping
the locals in this department.
Although his squad has gained
acclaim for its defensive abilities,
head coach Pete Newell has
pointed out that the Bears hit on
only 31 per cent of their shots
against Washington last weekend
in downing the Huskies 49-42.
Against Washington State last
Saturday they hit even less, 27
per cent, but again shined in the
defensive department, limiting
the Cougars to 32 points while
dumping in 47.
This week the emphasis has
been on "getting the ball into the
hole. A team doesn't usually win
hitting on the per centages we've
had. Our defensive play has
forced us to operate this way. but
this defense can't last forever.
Or Else
"It's clear that we'll have to
shoot better in the future or else
get knocked off. The only game
we've actually hit well in was the
Washington game (played in
Seattle and won by Call." Last
year at I his time the defending
Pacific Coast Champions were
popping in shots at a 40 per cenl
clip.
The Bears' season record stands
at 7-5 contrasted to the Indians'
6-7. In Conference play the Bears
are 3-1 with two wins over Wash
ington, and one over Washing
ton State. In their conference
opener Ihey lost to Oregon State
in Corvallis.

In pre-eonferenco games Call
fornia topped San Jose State and
St. Mary's (the latter in double
overtime) and lost to USF, Kan
sas Stale and Kansas before going
on to the Holiday Festival Tour
nament in New York. There they
beat N.Y.IJ. in the opening round,
came from behind in the final
minutes to tie and beat Dayton
60-55 in overtime in the semi- 1
finals, and dropped their final
round encounter to Temple by ten
points.

DOUG WARREN—MAY REPLACE BURFORD
Approximately 500 students, the basketball band and the usual
number of pompon girls and yell leaders will follow the Stanford
Indians to Berkeley tonight when they tangle with the California
Bears in the Cal Men's Gymnasium at 8.
Coach Howie Dallmar reported yesterday that forward Chris Bur-

ford, sidelined on Wednesday
with an apparent attack of tonsil
it is, may he able to start tonight.
Burford worked out with the
squad yesterday.
Otherwise, the Indians are in
fine shape for the game. Yester
day, after viewing films of the
games played last weekend, they
went through a light one-hour
practice session.
While Burford is questionable,
and Doug Warren or Jerry Theu
sen may open in his place, the
other regulars, Paul Neumann,
John Arrillaga, Neal Brockmeyor
and Dick Haga, will start as
usual.
At a quick glance the game
shapes up to be a contest between
a highly-rated Cal defense and a
doubtful Stanford offense or a
match between the teams' leading
scorers, Cal guard Earl Robinson
and Stanford forward John Ar
rillaga.
The Cal senior, who stands (M,
is playing his third year of varsity
ball for the Bears and tops the
squad with 119 points in 12 games
and a 9.9 average. Arrillaga
leads the Indians with 1(13 coun
ters, averaging 13.6.
Offensive Work
From California, however, comes
the report that the Bears have
been working on their offensive
game all week in hope of topping
the locals in this department.
Although his squad has gained
acclaim for its defensive abilities,
head coach Pete Newell has
pointed out that the Bears hit on
only 31 per cent of their shots
against Washington last weekend
in downing the Huskies 49-42.
Against Washington State last
Saturday they hit even less, 27
per cent, but again shined in the
defensive department, limiting
the Cougars to 32 points while
dumping in 47.
This week the emphasis has
been on "getting the ball into the
hole. A team doesn't usually win
hitting on the per centages we've
had. Our defensive play has
forced us to operate this way. but
this defense can't last forever.
Or Else
"It's clear that we'll have to
shoot better in the future or else
get knocked off. The only game
we've actually hit well in was the
Washington game (played in
Seattle and won by Call." Last
year at I his time the defending
Pacific Coast Champions were
popping in shots at a 40 per cenl
clip.
The Bears' season record stands
at 7-5 contrasted to the Indians'
6-7. In Conference play the Bears
are 3-1 with two wins over Wash
ington, and one over Washing
ton State. In their conference
opener Ihey lost to Oregon State
in Corvallis.

In pre-eonferenco games Call
fornia topped San Jose State and
St. Mary's (the latter in double
overtime) and lost to USF, Kan
sas Stale and Kansas before going
on to the Holiday Festival Tour
nament in New York. There they
beat N.Y.IJ. in the opening round,
came from behind in the final
minutes to tie and beat Dayton
60-55 in overtime in the semi- 1
finals, and dropped their final
round encounter to Temple by ten
points.
