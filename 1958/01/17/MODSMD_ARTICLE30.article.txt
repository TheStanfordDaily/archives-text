# Frosh Tangle With Strong Cal Bearcubs in Prelim
## 
### 
Stanford frosh basketballers
face their toughest opponents
this season when they will pull
every trick out of the bag to at
tempt to nip Cal tonight on the
Cubs' floor at 5:55.
"We have to play better than
we have in any other game to
win tonight," Papoose coach Bill
Turner exclaimed, "but we are
capable of it. The win will only
come, however, frorr; at least two
of the boys hitting consistently
and from a team effort."
Cal Taller
Cal's starting five averages
about one inch taller than the
Papooses and has built up a fine
record clobbering San Jose Jun
ior College, 72-49. and the Univer
sity of San Francisco, 56-35, last
weekend. Six-foot-six center Stan
Morrison is one of the outstand
ing players in the area and tall
six-four guard Earl Schultz is the
definite spark of the Cub quin
tet, averaging over 18 points per
game.
Trouble for Papooses
Newly elected team captain,
guard Bub Bowling, with an 11.2
points per game average and hav
ing grabbed 11 per cent of the
team's rebounds this season, will
backbone Stanford. Hard-playing
Tom Norland with a 7-point aver
age will take up the other guard
position.
Bowling and Norland, at 5-ll 1 /L'
and 6-2 respectively, will have a
hard time with Schultz as Cal
uses the "double block" and takes
him into Ihe post quite often.
Lanky Papoose center' Bob Whe
lan, topping the Cutis' Morrison
by four incites, will see more ac
tion tonight than in recent
games. Forwards Bruce Ander
son and Gary Estabrook, averag
ing 13 per cent and 16.5 per cent
of the squad's rebounding respec
tively, complete the line-up.
Stanford's Bud Mat'hiesen, Bill
Martin, Morgan Metcalf and A 1
Simila will definitely be on the
hardwood tonight in the tilt.
The Papooses have consistent
ly out-rebounded opponents in
compiling their 4 1 record. The
only team that defeated Stanford
in both the scoring and rebound
ing column was St. Mary's the
school that just edged out Cal by
3 points. In furthering this line

of thinking, Coach Turner voiced
the old adage, "You've got to re
hound to win ball games."
Cubs Favored
Cal is a slight favorite and will
hp out to live up to expectations.
"We really want to win this one
and will be in there fighting all
the way," expounded Turner.

points per game average and hav
ing grabbed 11 per cent of the
team's rebounds this season, will
backbone Stanford. Hard-playing
Tom Norland with a 7-point aver
age will take up the other guard
position.
Bowling and Norland, at 5-ll 1 /L'
and 6-2 respectively, will have a
hard time with Schultz as Cal
uses the "double block" and takes
him into Ihe post quite often.
Lanky Papoose center' Bob Whe
lan, topping the Cutis' Morrison
by four incites, will see more ac
tion tonight than in recent
games. Forwards Bruce Ander
son and Gary Estabrook, averag
ing 13 per cent and 16.5 per cent
of the squad's rebounding respec
tively, complete the line-up.
Stanford's Bud Mat'hiesen, Bill
Martin, Morgan Metcalf and A 1
Simila will definitely be on the
hardwood tonight in the tilt.
The Papooses have consistent
ly out-rebounded opponents in
compiling their 4 1 record. The
only team that defeated Stanford
in both the scoring and rebound
ing column was St. Mary's the
school that just edged out Cal by
3 points. In furthering this line

of thinking, Coach Turner voiced
the old adage, "You've got to re
hound to win ball games."
Cubs Favored
Cal is a slight favorite and will
hp out to live up to expectations.
"We really want to win this one
and will be in there fighting all
the way," expounded Turner.
Admission to the game is in
cluded in the SO-cent varsity tick
et.
Stanford frosh basketballers
face their toughest opponents
this season when they will pull
every trick out of the bag to at
tempt to nip Cal tonight on the
Cubs' floor at 5:55.
"We have to play better than
we have in any other game to
win tonight," Papoose coach Bill
Turner exclaimed, "but we are
capable of it. The win will only
come, however, frorr; at least two
of the boys hitting consistently
and from a team effort."
Cal Taller
Cal's starting five averages
about one inch taller than the
Papooses and has built up a fine
record clobbering San Jose Jun
ior College, 72-49. and the Univer
sity of San Francisco, 56-35, last
weekend. Six-foot-six center Stan
Morrison is one of the outstand
ing players in the area and tall
six-four guard Earl Schultz is the
definite spark of the Cub quin
tet, averaging over 18 points per
game.
Trouble for Papooses
