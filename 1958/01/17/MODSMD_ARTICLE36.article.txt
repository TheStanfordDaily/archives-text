# Yearbook Appeals For New Photogs
## 
### 
Photographers are needed by
the 1938 Quad.
Inexperienced but interested
people are encouraged to apply;
the Quad staff will train them.
Also, freshman and sophomore
students are reminded that work
on the publication will earn
group activity credit for them.
Equipment and film are supplied
entirely by the Quad.
The Quad office has announced
that students who have received
bills for the 1958 Quads should
make arrangements to pay for
them prior to Jan. 31.
