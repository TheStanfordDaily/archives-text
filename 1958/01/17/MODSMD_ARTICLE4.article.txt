tee predicts a substantially larger

planned. •
Highlighting the Drive activi

With Winter Drive just a few days off and as displays went up
in tlie lobby of the Main Library telling the story of the beneficiary
uf next week's drive, World University Service, 11. Donald Winbigler,
Dean of Students, had this message for the students of Stanford:
"The Autumn Quarter Drive for the Community Chest was one
—— of the most successful in recent

years. With a minimum of pub
licity, the committee in charge
organized the drive effectively
and students responded in a grat
ifying way.
'The Winter Quarter Drive
will be devoted to the World Uni
versity Service which is an emi
nent example of what students do
for students throughout the
world. WUS is essentially an or
ganization of students from 38
countries of the free world. Stan
ford students have contributed
generously to international un
derstanding and welfare, and I
am confident that this record will
be continued."
