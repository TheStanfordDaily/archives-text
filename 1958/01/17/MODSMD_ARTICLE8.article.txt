# Curtice Gets Five-Year Contract As New Indian Football Coach
## Final Decision to Accept Offer Made Late Wednesday Night 
### 
Respect for Stanford and the opportunity to associate with Chuck
Taylor were the principal reasons Jack Curtice decided to come to
Stanford, he told The Daily yesterday.
Stanford's new coach, speaking by telephone from Salt Lake City
30 minutes after his appointment, said the fine policy of Stanford
in both education and athletics helped him finally reach his decision.
Curtice said he "felt kindly toward early offers. They were very

kind to me." He made up his
mind Wednesday night that he
would come to Stanford, but ad
ded, "I could have withdrawn any
time before noon."
Curtice was a mixture of en
thusiasm for the challenge of the
new job and slight apprehension
about the moving of his family
and making of new friends in the
Bay Area. He's ready to come,
though, and commented:
"Hut, as Alexander said when
he came to the Rubicon, 'The die
is cast.' So you see," he went on,
You're getting a historian as well
as a football coach."
Challenge of Job
Reactions of his wife and two
sons were that "They're happy
wherever I go. They're enthused
about the challenge of the job."
Curtice will come to Stanford
by March 1, but his family won't
be here until about June 1.
Curtice expressed several hopes
about his new position and about
Stanford: "I hope athletics are in
their right proportion. ... I only
hope I can do a decent job. ... I
hope for the respect of the fac
ulty and students."
In touching on his ideas of the
place and purpose of football,
Curtice said, "Winning is a great,
a wonderful thing, but sometimes
defeat is what helps mould men."
Mutual Satisfaction
Curtice stated that the terms
he received in his five-year con
tract were "to our mutual satis
faction." He laughingly said that
ever since his 11 a.m. resignation
from the Utah job, "All I've been
is on the phone."
As far as assistants are con
cerned, Curtice remarked that
nothing has been decided as yet.
He said he'll not begin plans for
spring practice or start to look at
Stanford movies or charts until
he comes here.
"I have lots of work to do
here," he said, and added that
since spring practice doesn't be
gin until May, he'll have two
months to prepare for it.
The Daily also talked with
Curtice about the new PAT rule,
giving two points to conversions
made by running or passing.
He was greatly in favor of the
change, chiefly for the added in
terest it will give to a usually
dull play. When told that PAT's
were far from dull at Stanford
the last two years, Curtice
laughed and observed that "May-
I be it'll bounce a little differently
; out there now."
There's one respect in which
Curtice will feel at home- he'll
still be with a Tribe. His Utah
team was called the Redskins, a
I close relative to Stanford Indians.

their right proportion. ... I only
hope I can do a decent job. ... I
hope for the respect of the fac
ulty and students."
In touching on his ideas of the
place and purpose of football,
Curtice said, "Winning is a great,
a wonderful thing, but sometimes
defeat is what helps mould men."
Mutual Satisfaction
Curtice stated that the terms
he received in his five-year con
tract were "to our mutual satis
faction." He laughingly said that
ever since his 11 a.m. resignation
from the Utah job, "All I've been
is on the phone."
As far as assistants are con
cerned, Curtice remarked that
nothing has been decided as yet.
He said he'll not begin plans for
spring practice or start to look at
Stanford movies or charts until
he comes here.
"I have lots of work to do
here," he said, and added that
since spring practice doesn't be
gin until May, he'll have two
months to prepare for it.
The Daily also talked with
Curtice about the new PAT rule,
giving two points to conversions
made by running or passing.
He was greatly in favor of the
change, chiefly for the added in
terest it will give to a usually
dull play. When told that PAT's
were far from dull at Stanford
the last two years, Curtice
laughed and observed that "May-
I be it'll bounce a little differently
; out there now."
There's one respect in which
Curtice will feel at home- he'll
still be with a Tribe. His Utah
team was called the Redskins, a
I close relative to Stanford Indians.
Respect for Stanford and the opportunity to associate with Chuck
Taylor were the principal reasons Jack Curtice decided to come to
Stanford, he told The Daily yesterday.
Stanford's new coach, speaking by telephone from Salt Lake City
30 minutes after his appointment, said the fine policy of Stanford
in both education and athletics helped him finally reach his decision.
Curtice said he "felt kindly toward early offers. They were very

kind to me." He made up his
mind Wednesday night that he
would come to Stanford, but ad
ded, "I could have withdrawn any
time before noon."
Curtice was a mixture of en
thusiasm for the challenge of the
new job and slight apprehension
about the moving of his family
and making of new friends in the
Bay Area. He's ready to come,
though, and commented:
"Hut, as Alexander said when
he came to the Rubicon, 'The die
is cast.' So you see," he went on,
You're getting a historian as well
as a football coach."
Challenge of Job
Reactions of his wife and two
sons were that "They're happy
wherever I go. They're enthused
about the challenge of the job."
Curtice will come to Stanford
by March 1, but his family won't
be here until about June 1.
Curtice expressed several hopes
about his new position and about
Stanford: "I hope athletics are in
their right proportion. ... I only
hope I can do a decent job. ... I
hope for the respect of the fac
ulty and students."
