# Winter Drive Kickoff at Noon For Better and for WUS Theme
## Living Group Competition to Highlight Annual Week of Fund-Raising Events 
### 
Determined to work for "Better and for WUS," several hundred
students will launch Stanford's annual Winter Drive at noon today.
Throughout the week they will speak to student groups answering
questions about the World University Service and make the solicita
tions for funds.
A band composed of the Esquires, a freshman group, will play at

Engineering Corner to make the
loon opening official.
Drives Committee announced a
contest for the freshman men of
Wilbur Hall to supplement the
contest for the other living
groups. The floor in Wilbur that
donates the most per capita will
have its beds made by a Branner
corridor.
The floor that collects the least
per person will be asked to give
a party for a corridor from Bran
ner.
I'rof Hashers
The rest of the campus has
been divided into three groups
and four professors will hash the
dinner meal on Jan. 30 for the
winners in each division.
The returns from the drive will
be recorded on a graph in front
of Union as well as at the various
living groups.
But what is WUS and what
does it do? According to Keith
Torney, Drives Committee chair
man, WUS is an organization
composed entirely of students
that aims to help other students
in countries throughout the free
world.
He emphasized that by helping
through WUS we are actually
helping ourselves —we are
strengthening the free world by
providing aid to students so that
they may continue their educa
tion.
The program of the World Uni
versity Service is divided into
four basic parts:
• Student housing. WUS has
built student housing in many
countries and just recently com
pleted dormitories in Cairo and
Jerusalem. They help to allevi
ate problems like the one that
exists in Calcutta today where
3000 university students are lit
erally homeless, studying under
street lamps and sleeping on the
sidewalks.
WUS Program
• Sthdent health. WUS has
sponsored many programs to aid
the health of students and has
built health clinics in many coun
tries including Japan and India.
• Educational equipment. The
World University Service has
provided such things as text
books and laboratory equipment.
Conditions still exist like that at
the University of Mysore, where
(500 students depend on five text
books.
• Emergency relief. The best
example of the work of WUS in
this field is the way it responded
to the Hungarian crisis, relocat
ing thousands of student refu
gees and providing them with
scholarships and other necessi
ties to get them started again.
Last Year
Last year Stanford received
more aid from WUS in the form
of scholarships than Stanford
students contributed to the pro
gram. This isn't usually the case,
however, but Drives Committee
hopes to raise considerably more
WUS in last year's Winter Drive.
Dr. Bhaskara Rao, an Indian
student here on campus for the
start of the Drive, gave students
yesterday a first-hand account of
what WUS has been doing and
answered their questions. He
will speak at the "Y" luncheon
tomorrow.
Students have been asked by
the ASSU office to make their
contribution checks payable to
the Stanford Relief Fund.


YVUS IN JAPAN —Inada Noborito, a World Uni
versity Service TB sanatorium on the outskirts
of Tokyo, affords Japanese students up-to-date
facilities for eare and treatment of tuberculosis.

Although Tli is no longer a dread word in Amer
ican universities, it is the scourge of Japan's
students. Inuda Noborito was built by student
funds, predominantly American and Japanese.
