# Unilateral Disarmament
## 
### 
A Prevalent feature of modern warn seems
lo be that they are preceeded by periods of
disarmament schemes and proposed arms
limiting agreements. The call to disarm, caused
by the fear of an international arms buildup,
has come almost to be a harbinger of war.
Mnlford Sibley, a visiting professor of po
litical science from the University of Minne
sota, repeated this call in an IIR talk last
Thursday. He complained that the United
States, while officially desirous of world-wide
disarmament, continues its all-out military
competition with the Soviet Union. America's
leaders feel the need for military superiority
to give them "breathing space" for future dis
armament negotiations. But sustained military
superiority requires a constant buildup, and
when these eventual negotiations will take
place is anybody's guess.
So America finds herself in a vicious circle,
which will be ended, according to past ex
perience, only by a showdown ol military
streng th—a Third W or Id War.
But Professor Sibley proposes another way
of ending the circle: unilateral disarmament,
coupled with a program of (iliandi-like "non
violent resistance." lie claims that ii the
United States disarms completely and devotes
her energies to world economic development,
the psychological effect on the world's masses
will greatly lessen the risk of war. He gave
as an example of his belief the tosein of the
Hungarian Revolution — suppressing Russian
soldiers who often refused to fire 011 the passive
mobs of Budapest.
However, Sibley also said that the orienta
tion of the American people toward disarma
ment can be accomplished by convincing our
society's elite, because "the masses of mankind
are passive. They follow their leaders."
ft. ieems to us that Sibley is contradicting
himself. American disarmament would doubt
less have a great psychological effect on the
world's masses— those same masses who are
"passive" and "follow their leaders." Perhaps
a large percentage of the Russian army would,

as it did in Budapest, refuse lo fire on non
violent Americans. Hut ihe ruin of Budapest
is none the less complete, Cor all the conscience
of a handful of soldiers. American disarma
ment might even have its good effects on
Khrushchev, although we douht it; and if he
should renounce his power, we are sure that
another more ruthless strongman would he
ready to take over.
All that the Kremlin needs is a few pilots,
bombardiers and missile-men to destroy com
pletely a passively-resistant hut defenseless
New York or Washington or San Francisco.
Sibley will probably recognize in us the same
fear that has lead to the current arms race be
tween the United States and Russia. And we
would have to plead guilty—after all, we've
been brought up with it. We agree with him
that American militarism is creating the con
stant risk of war. But we would rather take
that risk than subscribe to bis unilateral dis
armament plan, which we feel would be sure
suicide. Wouldn't a war, which America might
have a small chance of winning, be better than
leaving ourselves unprotected against a Russia
pledged to world domination?
We recall the words of one political writer,
who said:
"There are not lacking men of prominence
and influence . . . who would strip the country
of its defense in order to prove the purity of
its own motives! This amazing attitude re
minds one of the fate of the Delaware Indians,
who were evilly inspired by their worst ene
mies, the Iroquois, to disarm and become the
mediator in the quarrels and wars of the In
dian Nations. The result, as should clearly
have been foreseen, was the utter ruin of the
Delaware Nation."
Naturally, none of us would welcome a war;
the prospect of possible complete annihilation
is staggering. Hut Sibley's suggestion is worse.
World-wide disarmament is to us the only
answer. To this end, we hope America's lead
ers will soon be able to convince ihemselves
that they have achieved the "breathing space"
for negotiation that they have been looking for.
