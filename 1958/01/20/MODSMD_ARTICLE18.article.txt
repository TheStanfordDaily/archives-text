# THIS WEEK ON QUAD
## Nondescript 'Humor' Magazine 
### Dave Quarles 
Unfortunately, we find this week is character
ized by such low points as today's discussion of
rigor mortis in salmon and Wednesday's disposal
of a nondescript "humor" magazine put out by
some pretty nondescript Stanford students. Our
readers needn't despair, for attendance at the
salmon party is not compulsory, and with a bit
of agility one can avoid the propositions of those
sidewalk vendors of dull wit.

Getting the week off to an unpleasant start,
the Department of Biological Sciences Seminar
will present O. H. Robertson and his "Study of
the Nature of the Post-Spawning Death of the
Pacific Salmon" in Room 430, Jordan Hall, today.
The 4:15 p.m. dissection will be preceded by tea,
and salmon croquets will be served after the
show.

The Tuesday Evening Series is really going in
formal. This week they are releasing Hughson
F. Moonev's torrid lales of wine, women and song
in a program deceptively titled "Songs, Singers
and Society Since 1890," a lecture with commen
tary and records. Recordings of such little
known ballad singers as A. E. Neuman, W. Won
ka, L. Stanford and H. Stroud will be played at
7:30 in Mem Aud.

ments of Spins and Moments of Radioactive Nu
clei by Atomic Beams" Wednesday. Head your
beam toward Room 101, Physics Lecture Hall,
and spin over about 4 p.m.
ATTENTION! The Math Department will pre
sent R. DeVogelaere in "Solution of Systems of
Linear Equations by Over-Relaxation" Wednes
day at 4:15 p.m. in Room 75, Math Building. We
would like to congratulate the Math Department
for finally discovering the key to good study
habits—over-relaxation. We Stanford students
deeply appreciate this justification of the ap
proach to education we have been practicing lo
these many years.
On the boards Wednesday afternoon in the
Lititle Theater. Mem Aud. will be "Scenes in the
Commedia dell'Arte Tradition," directed by Jean
Ackermann, grad student. Curtain at 4:15.

versify, will solve the enigmas of "Holomorphic
Functions on an Analytic Subset" in Room 104,

Don t miss Benjamin Linsky, Air Pollution
Control Officer, Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District, when he attempts "Some Techniques
Employed in the Measurement and Control of At
mospheric Pollution, or (specifically) "How to
Clear the Air." Linsky's boys certainly were out
to dinner Friday night when that pea-souper de
scended. Anyway, maybe Linsky will dear some
of the dust and cobwebs out of Room 20 of the
Chem Building at 4:15 p.m. Thursday.
The Graduate History Honor Society will pre
sent Crane Brinton from Harvard and his "Some
Afterthoughts on the Anatomy of Revolution" at
4:15 p.m. in the lower lounge of the Women's

for you.
Rounding out the day, the Film Series is pre
senting a spectacular at 4:15 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
in Cub Aud. The thing was filmed on location in
the famous Stanford Quad. It's called "Asphalt

Friday the Music Department will lift the cur
tain on Paul Draper, dancer, at 8:30 p.m. in Din

strate.
