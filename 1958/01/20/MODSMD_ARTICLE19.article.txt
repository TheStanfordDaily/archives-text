Overly Sensitive Newspaper
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's [Wednesday's! issue of The
Daily there appeared a letter which in general
described your support of the Democratic can
didates in California's coming elections as "in
sane drivel" and "garbage," and which in par
ticular called Pat Brown's character "dubious."
That the fellow who wrote it is politically im

mature is not surprising. That lie lacks the
courtesy to he sensible lo the feelings of Ihe
students here who are Democrats is likewise not
surprising. What is curious is that you should
defer to the printing of such a letter. A news
paper can become overly sensitive to the opin
ions of its readers; and it seems to me to do so
when it prints the letters of name-callers, just as
much as when it prints the letters of cranks.
