# 'Y' DISCUSSION GROUP
## Alexander Miller Views Harvard Religious Tone 
### 
Dr. Alexander Miller, on sabbatical leave autumn quarter to lec
ture at Harvard University, brought back his impressions of the
religious climate there to the "Y" .Religious Discussion Group last
Thursday noon.
"The theological fulcrum is shifting," he said, in that the Divinity

School is being closely integrated
into the functioning of the whole
school system. Its faculty and
such men as university professor
Paul Tillieh are vitally interested
in the interchange of cultural
ideas and questions within the
university as a whole, not just
within their particular schools.
"They are definitely not, -show
ever, dogmatic Trinitarians," Mil
ler said. "It is not the strongly
orthodox (Biblical) men who
have the most to say about the
cultural questions within a uni
versity."
On the other hand, the men in
the Stanford faculty who sub
scribe to a "general Christian
background" know their faith in
tellectually, Miller stated, but
"do not regard it as a living op
tion." They think of themselves
as Humanists, he feels, and do
not recognize a vital connection
between their faitli and the cul
tural life of the university.
In comparing the student bod
ies, Miller stated that "among
Stanford students there is a gen
eral amiability about matters of
piety, rather than the extremes
of doubt or conviction which are
to be found more readily at Har
vard.
