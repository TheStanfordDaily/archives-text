## Gambee-Led Northerners Boast 12-2 Season Mark 
### Steve Baffrey 
Anthony T. "Slats" Gill and his Oregon State Beavers pull into
town today for an 8 p.m. go against the Stanford Indians in the
Pavilion.
Paced by All-Coast forward Dave Cambee, the Reavers bring an
impressive 12-2 record with them into tonight's game. On Saturday

they were set back for the first
'ime in Conference play by the
California Bears in Berkeley.
Earlier, in the opening game of
the PCC. season the Beavers
tripped the Bears in Corvallis, 55-
13. On Saturday they couldn't
match their earlier play and fell
by the 10-point wayside, 61 51.
Bur ford Okay
Trainer Connie Jarvis reports
that starting forward Chris Bur
ford, who played only the first
four and last five minutes of Fri
day night's game, apparently still !
not al full strength after his j
tonsilitis attack last week, should |
be up to playing ihe full game. ,
Another question in the Stan
ford camp, though, is forward !
Jerry Thuesen. Thuesen injured
his knee in practice last Thurs- j
day night and an infection re
sulting from Ibis kepi him oiil of
action on Friday.
Coach Howie Dallmar sent the
Indians through a film and polish
workout yesterday without Theu
sen or forward John Arrillaga.
The latter, reports Jarvis, was
just tired and sat the session out.
The Stanford trainer feels the rest j
"is probably better for him." He
will no doubt open against ihe 1
Beavers tonight.
Compared Against Cal
Stanford seems to have the
comparative edge when they and
the Beavers are viewed in their
performances against California
last weekend. But in the long run
the Beavers' victory over the
Bears on Jan. 3 upsets the pic
ture.
Last weekend neither squad
could top the Bears, both being
hurt by California's defense.
Looking at shooting percentages
the Indians seemed to do better
against the Bears than the Beav
ers, hitting a 43 per cent mark
while scoring the most points
against the Blue and Gold that
any team has done in defeat be
fore Saturday. Oregon State hit
only 32 per cent.
A possible significant factor in
the game will be the shooting
from the free throw line. At one
point this season the Indians
were third in the nation in this
department, but poor showings
against both Washington and
California have sent the Indians
plummeting out of the national ;
charts.
Going Down
Against Washington the In
dians hit only 14 out of 22, and ;
against the Bears they missed j
more than they made, grabbing
off only seven in 15 tries. The
Beavers' free throw mark stands
around .710 with 196 buckets in
296 tries.
Oregon State has only lost two
games this season, one of them in
Conference play. In pre-season
tussles the Beavers dumped Ore
gon, Portland (twice), Seattle,
Gonzaga, Indiana, Yale and Utah.!
Their other loss was a 67-77 over- j
timer at the hands of lowa.
Gambee teams with Ken Nan
son at the forwards. Nanson is the I
second highest scored with 169 i
points. He stands 6-0, weighs 175
The Beaver center is Wayne Moss
who tops Indian center Neal
Brockmeyer by an inch at 6-9.
Oregon's guards are Lee Har
man and Jim Anderson. The two !
are the Beavers' third and fourth 1
scorers in that order. Harman at !
6-0 weighs 190 pounds; Anderson
is the smallest man on Hie team, 1
standing 5-9 and weighing in at
only 155.

Bur ford Okay
Trainer Connie Jarvis reports
that starting forward Chris Bur
ford, who played only the first
four and last five minutes of Fri
day night's game, apparently still !
not al full strength after his j
tonsilitis attack last week, should |
be up to playing ihe full game. ,
Another question in the Stan
ford camp, though, is forward !
Jerry Thuesen. Thuesen injured
his knee in practice last Thurs- j
day night and an infection re
sulting from Ibis kepi him oiil of
action on Friday.
Coach Howie Dallmar sent the
Indians through a film and polish
workout yesterday without Theu
sen or forward John Arrillaga.
The latter, reports Jarvis, was
just tired and sat the session out.
The Stanford trainer feels the rest j
"is probably better for him." He
will no doubt open against ihe 1
Beavers tonight.
Compared Against Cal
Stanford seems to have the
comparative edge when they and
the Beavers are viewed in their
performances against California
last weekend. But in the long run
the Beavers' victory over the
Bears on Jan. 3 upsets the pic
ture.
Last weekend neither squad
could top the Bears, both being
hurt by California's defense.
Looking at shooting percentages
the Indians seemed to do better
against the Bears than the Beav
ers, hitting a 43 per cent mark
while scoring the most points
against the Blue and Gold that
any team has done in defeat be
fore Saturday. Oregon State hit
only 32 per cent.
A possible significant factor in
the game will be the shooting
from the free throw line. At one
point this season the Indians
were third in the nation in this
department, but poor showings
against both Washington and
California have sent the Indians
plummeting out of the national ;
charts.
Going Down
Against Washington the In
dians hit only 14 out of 22, and ;
against the Bears they missed j
more than they made, grabbing
off only seven in 15 tries. The
Beavers' free throw mark stands
around .710 with 196 buckets in
296 tries.
Oregon State has only lost two
games this season, one of them in
Conference play. In pre-season
tussles the Beavers dumped Ore
gon, Portland (twice), Seattle,
Gonzaga, Indiana, Yale and Utah.!
Their other loss was a 67-77 over- j
timer at the hands of lowa.

the PCC. season the Beavers
tripped the Bears in Corvallis, 55-
13. On Saturday they couldn't
match their earlier play and fell
by the 10-point wayside, 61 51.
Bur ford Okay
Trainer Connie Jarvis reports
that starting forward Chris Bur
ford, who played only the first
four and last five minutes of Fri
day night's game, apparently still !
not al full strength after his j
tonsilitis attack last week, should |
be up to playing ihe full game. ,
Another question in the Stan
ford camp, though, is forward !
Jerry Thuesen. Thuesen injured
his knee in practice last Thurs- j
day night and an infection re
sulting from Ibis kepi him oiil of
action on Friday.
Coach Howie Dallmar sent the
Indians through a film and polish
workout yesterday without Theu
sen or forward John Arrillaga.
The latter, reports Jarvis, was
just tired and sat the session out.
The Stanford trainer feels the rest j
"is probably better for him." He
will no doubt open against ihe 1
Beavers tonight.
Compared Against Cal
Stanford seems to have the
comparative edge when they and
the Beavers are viewed in their
performances against California
last weekend. But in the long run
the Beavers' victory over the
Bears on Jan. 3 upsets the pic
ture.
Last weekend neither squad
could top the Bears, both being
hurt by California's defense.
Looking at shooting percentages
the Indians seemed to do better
against the Bears than the Beav
ers, hitting a 43 per cent mark
while scoring the most points
against the Blue and Gold that
any team has done in defeat be
fore Saturday. Oregon State hit
only 32 per cent.
A possible significant factor in
the game will be the shooting
from the free throw line. At one
point this season the Indians
were third in the nation in this
department, but poor showings
against both Washington and
California have sent the Indians
plummeting out of the national ;
charts.
Going Down
Against Washington the In
dians hit only 14 out of 22, and ;
against the Bears they missed j
more than they made, grabbing
off only seven in 15 tries. The
Beavers' free throw mark stands
around .710 with 196 buckets in
296 tries.
Oregon State has only lost two
games this season, one of them in
Conference play. In pre-season
tussles the Beavers dumped Ore
gon, Portland (twice), Seattle,
Gonzaga, Indiana, Yale and Utah.!
Their other loss was a 67-77 over- j
timer at the hands of lowa.
Gambee teams with Ken Nan
son at the forwards. Nanson is the I
second highest scored with 169 i
points. He stands 6-0, weighs 175
The Beaver center is Wayne Moss
who tops Indian center Neal
Brockmeyer by an inch at 6-9.
Oregon's guards are Lee Har
man and Jim Anderson. The two !
are the Beavers' third and fourth 1
scorers in that order. Harman at !
6-0 weighs 190 pounds; Anderson
is the smallest man on Hie team, 1
standing 5-9 and weighing in at
only 155.
Admission to tonight's game is i
free bui tickets must be secured
at the BAC in advance.
