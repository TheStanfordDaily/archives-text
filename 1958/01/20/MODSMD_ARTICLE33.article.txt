## 
### 
Coach Pete Kmetovic took ad
vantage of the situation and gave
45 Tribe ruggers game experi
ence as Stanford won an easy
10-3 rugby victory over ihe Pen
insula Ramblers Saturday after
noon.
Dave Scholtz and Hap Easter
did a good job moving the In
dians from their important scrum
half spot. The rugby scrum-half
corresponds with American foot
ball's quarterback in that he initi
ates most of the offensive thrusts.
Honeywell Scores
Stanford struck early as Jim
Honeywell, from his left-wing po
sition. received the end pass of a
lateral series, ran straight toward
the Ramblers fullback, and then
with a good fake cut to the center
of the field to complete a 15-yard
try. Kyrk Reid converted to make
the score 5-0.
Dennis Cutshaw set up the sec
ond score with a well executed
35-yard broken field run, lateral
ing to John Clark who took the
ball-5 yards for a try. Reid again
converted to make the score 10-0
after eight minutes of play.
Seconds Can't Score
Then the second string went
into aelion for the remainder of
the half. This unil was unable to
penetrate the Rambler goal line.
The second half saw the third
string and other subs in action
except for the last few minutes
when some of the first string re
turned to action. The Ramblers
were able to score against this
last unit when an Indian fullback
ran a ball into his own end /one
causing a scrum in front of Ihe
end zone. A Rambler back bulled
the ball over for the try, but the
conversion attempt was off to the
left, so the game ended 10-3.
