# Hot Bear Shooting, Strong Defense Rip Cards, 60-45
## 
### 
California's Golden Bears I
worked on offense last week and
it worked for them on Friday
night when they downed Ihe Stan
ford Indians 60-45 in Berkeley.
But it wasn't only offensive tac
tics that turned the Injuns back;
that California defense played a
big part, too.
Up to Friday night's game the
Bears had been hitting between
25 and 30 percent of their field
goal attempts. Against the In
dians I hey pumped in a healthy
40 per cent of 63 shots. In cold,
hard figures the locals did better,
grabbing a 43 per cent mark,
ill the Cal defense held them to
only 44 shots and this is what
hurt.
Stanford got off to a rocky
i start, almost five minutes gone
by before they dumped their first
points through ihe Cal hoop.
When John Arrillaga finally
started the local scoring ball roll
ing the Indians were already 10
points behind.
Burford Out
By the time they did finally
I score Stanford had lost the serv
; ices of starter Chris Burford.
Tonsillitis bolhered him earlier in
j tlie week and he evidently hadn't
regained full slrength by Friday.
Indian shooters had trouble
! finding the range in Ihe early
j minutes of the opening stanza
and to top this off they were hav
i ing trouble keeping the ball under
I control.
Throughout Ihe first half the
i Indians couldn't draw closer 1o
(ihe Bears than five poinls which
| they did on a couple of occassions.
At the half, 1 hough, they were
eight points down, 32-24. First
half statistics gave a preview of
things to come.
The Indians out-shot Ihe Bears
on percentage 48-44, but only got
off 23 shots to Cal's .'42.
Surprise Zone
Late in the opening round, coach
Howie Dallmar threw a zone de
fense against the Bears and it
took the Blue and Gold a little
while to overcome it. But this
was nothing compared to what
ihe Cal defense would later do to
the Indians.
Moving with considerable speed
and accuracy the Indians began
I to chase the Bears in the opening
j minutes of the second period,
j Moving up to the 2S-32 mark the
Indians were the closest they'd
been since Cal held a 4-0 lead.
Then they closed the gap to 29-

32, and exchanges of points I
brought il to 33-35, but then the
roof fell in.
Stanford added only two free j
throws to its score in Ihe next 9
minutes while the Bears frolicked
for 20 big counters. When Mike
Tipton finally broke Ihe field goal
ice the Indians were too far be
hind to hope. The score at this
point was 54-37.
Arrillaga paced the Indians with i
his 12-point effort, and pleased
the crowd with his long jump
shots. Captain Paul Neumann
followed with 9.
