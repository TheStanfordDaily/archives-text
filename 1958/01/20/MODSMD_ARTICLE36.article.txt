# No Word Yet On Assistants
## 
### 
With all the speculation about
Stanford's football coaching va
cancy now dispelled by the ap
pointment of Jack Curtice as the i
new head man, Indian grid talk |
has switched to the problem of
assistants.
Curtice is due to start work at
Stanford March 1, so it is as-'
sumed that his staff, or at least;
the greater share of it, will be:
filled bv that date.
He has said that nothing defi- j
nite has been decidedâ€”that he
hasn't had much lime to think j
about aides as yet. Curtice did
say that it was likely that some
of ihe present Stanford assistants
would remain and that some of
his staff from Utah might come
also.
From the Stanford end, there!
is of course nothing any more
definite. Curtice will have freet
rein in picking his men, except
that the University will have to j
give final approval.
