### Steve Freidberg 
Escaping to West Berlin on a
New Year's Eve, hitchhiking
around Europe and coming to the
United States have all been events
in the interesting life of Bob
Gottwald, who is an ASSU For
eign Scholar from Germany.
Bob is also participating in an
! exchange program between Stan
ford and the Free University of
| West Berlin, which is sponsored
by the Berlin Affiliation Com
! mil tee at Stanford and a similar
! committee in Berlin.
Fled to West
Until Dec. 31, 19.32, he lived in
East Germany; but as the Rus
, sians considered his family capi
i talistie and would not let him go
j to school, he was forced to flee to
! West Berlin to get an education.
"If 1 stayed in East Germany,
my only choices were to join the
People's Army, become a mem
ber of the Communist Party, or
get a job in a uranium mine," he
| said.
He emphasized that this is a
two-way exchange and that there
! are now two Stanford students,
Linda Murrell and Ken Keylie,
studying at Berlin University. In
j addition,- he said that any student
interested in participating in the
exchange next year should pick
up an application form at the
ASSU office and return it there
by Jan. 20.
History
At Stanford, Bob is working to
ward his doctorate degree in
j modern history which he hopes to
I obtain from the Free University
of Berlin in about two years.
Presently, he is doing research
at Hoover Institute for a disser
tation on Gustav Stresemann, a
â€¢ leading figure of the Weimar pe
riod. He hopes eventually to go
into teaching or publishing work,
both of which he says are diffi
cult occupations to enter in Ger
j many because of the great com
| petition in these fields.
Between 1950 and 1932, he did
his apprenticeship in book-selling
in East Germany and continued
with that work during the sum
mer in West Berlin.
Philosophy and sociology are
two other fields which attract
him.
"A publisher must know about
public and scientific affairs in ad
dition to knowing about busi
ness," Bob said, explaining these
interests .
Likes Travel
He likes modern art and enjoys
listening to both classical music
'and jazz. Traveling also occupies

much of his free time, and he has
been to many European coun
tries.
In connection with the German
Club, Bob is directing a play by
Bert Brecht, "Scenes of Furcht
und Elend des 3 Reiches," which
shows living conditions under a
totalitarian state. This play will
be presented Feb. 19, at the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
There are three main reasons
why Bob wanted to come to the
United States. One of these is.
of course, to work on his disser
tation; and he chose Stanford
mainly because of the Hoover In
stitution which is very helpful in
his subject.
A second reason was that he
wanted to know something more
about the United States than is
presented in the newspapers and
movies and to correct any false
pictures he may have formed
about this country.
Stereotype's
"One of the stereotypes I had
in mind was that, in the U.S., stu
dents don't work very hard. On
the contrary, I was much im
pressed by the amount of work
Stanford students do."
He added that he was a little
dubious about the large number
of extracurricular activities many
students participate in. "There
seems to be a certain social pres
sure that to be recognized as a
good student, one has to be in
many activities. I have the im
pression that these activities
sometimes take more time than
they should and are harmful to
students. However, a certain
number of activities are good and
necessary."
A third reason he wanted to
come to this country was to give
the American people some idea of
