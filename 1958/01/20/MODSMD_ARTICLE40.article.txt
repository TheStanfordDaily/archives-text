what Germany is like and what
some of its problems are.
Adenauer
According to him. one of the
major problems at the present
is finding a successor for Konrad
Adenauer, now Chancellor of
West Germany.
"Adenauer is the outstanding
German since the war and is
greatly responsible for the repu
tation West Germany now has,"
he commented. "It will be very
difficult to find a man to replace
him."
Reunification of East and West
Germany has been a major issue
since the war, Bob mentioned.
"We realize that it is not within
our power to get reunification.
This depends on the Four Pow
ers.
"The real danger is that each
day Ihe present situation contin
ues, people become used to it and
do not worry about it any long
er."
