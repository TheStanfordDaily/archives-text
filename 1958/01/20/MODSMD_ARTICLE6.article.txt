## Satellites Safe for Now, Predicts Correspondent

"Can Russia Hold Her Satel
lites?"
Today and in the near future
-"Yes." Forever and for a long
period of time—"No,"
Daniel Schorr, Columbia Broad
casting Company's correspondent
to Moscow, thus predicted the fu
ture of Russia's satellites to a
Saturday evening audience at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Statements, forecasts and in
terpretations of Russia's past,
present and future made by the
celebrated journalist were based
on his contacts with Khrushchev,
Bulganin, Molotov and other top
Communists, and investigations
into Soviet politics and economics
during his two-year assignment
to Moscow during 1956 and 1937.
Stalin's Death
Stalin's death in 1953 began a
governmental re-evaluation cam
paign which emerged in a new
policy concerning "one of Iho
many roads to Socialism," he said.
Top leaders relaxed Moscow's
control over satellite states, to
give them more freedom and inde
pendence when they realized thai
"economy by compulsion was
showing diminishing returns."
Ruthless policing powers were
relaxed and the small, under
developed statellites were given
"their heads" to work out eco
nomic problems, according to the
individual problems of each.
Stalin's concept and plan for the
satellite stales of making each in
to a "little Russia," was substi
tutcd for a new policy of Jiberali

/at ion under which economic im
provement would be the intended
result, and Communism's over-all
power would be increased.
Economic Plans
If each country were to develop
its own economic features in con
centrated efforts, and in turn rely
on its fellow-satellites for re
sources which it lacked, an inter
dependence would develop and a
stronger Communist world would
result, he explained.
"But this didn't work."
Instead came the October Events
in Poland in 1956.
Then came Hungary a few
weeks later.
Blame for those unforeseen
events was laid chiefly on Khru
shchev, since this plan of relaxa
tion had been his idea.
Malenkov, on the other hand,
advocated extensive economic im
provements in Ihe satellites be
fore relaxing Russia's hold.
Hungary Hesult
"As a result of Hungary, this
period was probably the weakest
part of Khrushchev's career since
Stalin," Schorr said. And then
Pdalenkov and Molotov disap
peared from the picture and
Khrushchev was forced to accept
a partial reversal of his satellite
policies.
A satellite crackdown resulted
and strict political control, as well
las increased economic aid was
: forced on the satellite peoples,
whose "too healthy" appetite for
freedom had become dangerous.
Russia's reversal to its former
position of complete control over
the Communist world was
achieved with amazing swiftness.
And this was due to two events,
which proved extremely advan
tageous to the situation:
• Red China's reluctance to
rise up and show her real force,
because of Russia's .effective sup
pression of the Hungarian revolt.
• The well-timed and exploited
appearance of Sputniks I and 11
to the world's awed people.
But, as Schorr explained, the
present picture is not so bleak as
it may appear on the surface:
• The pressure for freedom in
the satellites is very strong, and
will not he suppressed so thor
oughly in the minds of the people
as were the physical suppressions
in Poland, he said.
• Marshall Tito, Yugoslavia's
influential riddle, is still a major
obstacle in Khruschev's path, in
spite of Khrushchev's intensive
"wooing," Schorr said.
• The economic importance of
the satellites is now much less
than Russia desires. More money
is going into those nations than is
coming out.
Withdrawal
Another of Russia's tactics, of
extreme interest to the Western
nations, is her interest in possible
withdrawal of either the United
States or Russia from the present
cold war.
"She has been putting out feel
ers concerning disengagement,"
Schorr said, "and this interesting
prospect is something we ought
to begin to think about."

lites?"

period was probably the weakest
part of Khrushchev's career since
Stalin," Schorr said. And then
Pdalenkov and Molotov disap
peared from the picture and
Khrushchev was forced to accept
a partial reversal of his satellite
policies.
A satellite crackdown resulted
and strict political control, as well
las increased economic aid was
: forced on the satellite peoples,
whose "too healthy" appetite for
freedom had become dangerous.
Russia's reversal to its former
position of complete control over
the Communist world was
achieved with amazing swiftness.
And this was due to two events,
which proved extremely advan
tageous to the situation:
• Red China's reluctance to
rise up and show her real force,
because of Russia's .effective sup
pression of the Hungarian revolt.
• The well-timed and exploited
appearance of Sputniks I and 11
to the world's awed people.
But, as Schorr explained, the
present picture is not so bleak as
it may appear on the surface:
• The pressure for freedom in
the satellites is very strong, and
will not he suppressed so thor
oughly in the minds of the people
as were the physical suppressions
in Poland, he said.
• Marshall Tito, Yugoslavia's
influential riddle, is still a major
obstacle in Khruschev's path, in
spite of Khrushchev's intensive
"wooing," Schorr said.
• The economic importance of
the satellites is now much less
than Russia desires. More money
is going into those nations than is
coming out.
Withdrawal
Another of Russia's tactics, of
extreme interest to the Western
nations, is her interest in possible
withdrawal of either the United
States or Russia from the present
cold war.
"She has been putting out feel
ers concerning disengagement,"
Schorr said, "and this interesting
prospect is something we ought
to begin to think about."
"Can Russia Hold Her Satel
lites?"
Today and in the near future
-"Yes." Forever and for a long
period of time—"No,"
Daniel Schorr, Columbia Broad
casting Company's correspondent
to Moscow, thus predicted the fu
ture of Russia's satellites to a
Saturday evening audience at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Statements, forecasts and in
terpretations of Russia's past,
present and future made by the
celebrated journalist were based
on his contacts with Khrushchev,
Bulganin, Molotov and other top
Communists, and investigations
into Soviet politics and economics
during his two-year assignment
to Moscow during 1956 and 1937.
Stalin's Death
Stalin's death in 1953 began a
governmental re-evaluation cam
paign which emerged in a new
policy concerning "one of Iho
many roads to Socialism," he said.
Top leaders relaxed Moscow's
control over satellite states, to
give them more freedom and inde
pendence when they realized thai
"economy by compulsion was
showing diminishing returns."
Ruthless policing powers were
relaxed and the small, under
developed statellites were given
"their heads" to work out eco
nomic problems, according to the
individual problems of each.
Stalin's concept and plan for the
satellite stales of making each in
to a "little Russia," was substi
tutcd for a new policy of Jiberali

/at ion under which economic im
provement would be the intended
result, and Communism's over-all
power would be increased.
Economic Plans
If each country were to develop
its own economic features in con
centrated efforts, and in turn rely
on its fellow-satellites for re
sources which it lacked, an inter
dependence would develop and a
stronger Communist world would
result, he explained.
"But this didn't work."
Instead came the October Events
in Poland in 1956.
Then came Hungary a few
weeks later.
Blame for those unforeseen
events was laid chiefly on Khru
shchev, since this plan of relaxa
tion had been his idea.
Malenkov, on the other hand,
advocated extensive economic im
provements in Ihe satellites be
fore relaxing Russia's hold.

on his contacts with Khrushchev,
Bulganin, Molotov and other top
Communists, and investigations
into Soviet politics and economics
during his two-year assignment
to Moscow during 1956 and 1937.
Stalin's Death
Stalin's death in 1953 began a
governmental re-evaluation cam
paign which emerged in a new
policy concerning "one of Iho
many roads to Socialism," he said.
Top leaders relaxed Moscow's
control over satellite states, to
give them more freedom and inde
pendence when they realized thai
"economy by compulsion was
showing diminishing returns."
Ruthless policing powers were
relaxed and the small, under
developed statellites were given
"their heads" to work out eco
nomic problems, according to the
individual problems of each.
Stalin's concept and plan for the
satellite stales of making each in
to a "little Russia," was substi
tutcd for a new policy of Jiberali

/at ion under which economic im
provement would be the intended
result, and Communism's over-all
power would be increased.
Economic Plans
If each country were to develop
its own economic features in con
centrated efforts, and in turn rely
on its fellow-satellites for re
sources which it lacked, an inter
dependence would develop and a
stronger Communist world would
result, he explained.
"But this didn't work."
Instead came the October Events
in Poland in 1956.
Then came Hungary a few
weeks later.
Blame for those unforeseen
events was laid chiefly on Khru
shchev, since this plan of relaxa
tion had been his idea.
Malenkov, on the other hand,
advocated extensive economic im
provements in Ihe satellites be
fore relaxing Russia's hold.
Hungary Hesult
"As a result of Hungary, this
period was probably the weakest
part of Khrushchev's career since
Stalin," Schorr said. And then
Pdalenkov and Molotov disap
peared from the picture and
Khrushchev was forced to accept
a partial reversal of his satellite
policies.
A satellite crackdown resulted
and strict political control, as well
las increased economic aid was
: forced on the satellite peoples,
whose "too healthy" appetite for
freedom had become dangerous.
Russia's reversal to its former
position of complete control over
the Communist world was
achieved with amazing swiftness.
And this was due to two events,
which proved extremely advan
tageous to the situation:
• Red China's reluctance to
rise up and show her real force,
because of Russia's .effective sup
pression of the Hungarian revolt.
• The well-timed and exploited
appearance of Sputniks I and 11
to the world's awed people.
But, as Schorr explained, the
present picture is not so bleak as
it may appear on the surface:
• The pressure for freedom in
the satellites is very strong, and
will not he suppressed so thor
oughly in the minds of the people
as were the physical suppressions
in Poland, he said.
• Marshall Tito, Yugoslavia's
influential riddle, is still a major
obstacle in Khruschev's path, in
spite of Khrushchev's intensive
"wooing," Schorr said.
• The economic importance of
the satellites is now much less
than Russia desires. More money
is going into those nations than is
coming out.
Withdrawal
Another of Russia's tactics, of
extreme interest to the Western
nations, is her interest in possible
withdrawal of either the United
States or Russia from the present
cold war.
"She has been putting out feel
ers concerning disengagement,"
Schorr said, "and this interesting
prospect is something we ought
to begin to think about."
"Can Russia Hold Her Satel
lites?"
Today and in the near future
-"Yes." Forever and for a long
period of time—"No,"
Daniel Schorr, Columbia Broad
casting Company's correspondent
to Moscow, thus predicted the fu
ture of Russia's satellites to a
Saturday evening audience at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
