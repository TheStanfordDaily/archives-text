# Band Stuck In the Mud
## 
### 
The game was ready to be
gin. The California Straw Hat
basketball band had played a
Stanford song . . . but from
the section reserved for the
Red Vested Stanford band
came no sound. In fact the sec
tion was nearly empty.
The night had been foggy.
The ground had been soggy.
The band had gotten stuck in
the mud.
While attempting to back
onto the road from the band
house, the Greyhound bus the
group was riding sank deep,
deep into a hole. Try as they
could, they couldn't get out.
Let it never be said that
there wasn't Stanford music at
the game . . . for two hand
sters" who had driven to the
game, playing baritone and
trombone, played ducts for the
crowd.
