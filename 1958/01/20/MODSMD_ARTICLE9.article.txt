San Francisco's Mayor George
Christopher addressed a "School
of Politics" held Saturday at
Rickey's. The event was spon
sored by Stanford Area, San Ma
teo and Santa Clara Young Re
publicans.
Christopher, currently running
with Governor Goodwin Knight
for the Republican nomination
for U.S Senator from California,
spoke on "Winning the Non-Re
publican Vote in '58"
"Republicans need to take Ihe
offensive, not the defensive," he
emphasized. "We need to point
out to everyone that there was no
'deal' between Knowland and
Knight."
In appealing to Democrats who
want cood government, the San
Francisco mayor outlined state
Republican policies as: decency
and honesty in government; pro
tecting the welfare of all Demo
crats, Republicans, labor, man
agement; not engaging in extrav
agances; protecting free institu
tions, namely free enterprise.
It is the people in the last anal
ysis who determine what kind of
government they will have, the
mayor said. "No empire includ
ing the Greek, Roman and others
was ever defeated from with
out," Christopher noted.
