# THE
						FARM, THE WILL AND BOOZE
## Dry Campus Not Created By Mrs. Stanford's Will 
### Dave Quarles 
Over the years many myths have attached them
selves to Mrs. Stanford's Will, but one of the most
persistent has been that of the alcohol situation on
campus. Bacchanalian students, looking for a
scapegoat for their misery, have consistently
blamed Mrs. Stanford for a dry campus.
Tracing Stanford's alcoholic history, The Daily
came up with some colorful details. However, in
all fairness, Mrs. Stanford must be absolved from
guilt. The fact is that all actions concerning Stan
ford and the bottle have come from state law and
trustee action.
Although Mr. and Mrs. Stanford lobbied in the
early years of the University for a prohibition
law and succeeded in having one put on the books,
prohibition on campus did not become effective
until after a motion was passed by the trustees in
February, 1908.
Of course, the further complications of age
limit for buying and consuming liquor off campus
were the results of state laws legislated after the
repeal of national prohibition.
Much more interesting than the quashing of the
alcohol myth are the actual facts leading up to
the trustees' decision in 1908. it is this short his
tory, from the opening of the University in 1891 to
the 1908 edict, which will be retold in this and the
following installment.

A freshman, not realizing the truth in his words,
wrote to his home town newspaper shortly after 1
the opening of the Universiy:
"There seems to be but one thing which may
prove a drawback to student life here, and that
is the proximity of Menlo Park and Mayfield
|South Palo Alto|, where the saloon and billiard
hall figure prominently."
It was, in fact, the example of the saloons in
Menlo Park and Mayfield which prompted Sena
tor Stanford to make his town of Palo Alto per
petually dry through a reversion clause in the
property deed.
Original Provision Threatened Palo Alio
He provided that if liquor were ever dispensed
on any land in the town of Palo Alto included in
the original land grant to Timothy Hopkins, the
land would revert to the University.
Senator Stanford was determined to have a dry
campus, and he and Mrs. Stanford sponsored a
rule excluding liquor from the dorms and infer
entially from fraternity houses which might be
built in the future. However, the ruling was
winked at by the students and the administration.
This determination is shown in a letter to Timo
thy Hopkins about a proposed railroad station in
Palo Alto. Senator Stanford wrote, "I think I
should object to a depot of any kind if whiskey
could be sold near it, as the location is so close
to my university."
"Mayfield Habit" Was Early Tradition
Out of deference to the founders, early devotees
of the bottle confined their rites to a hallowed back
room in a tavern in Mayfield. "Mayfield Road"
and "Mayfield habit" were early additions to the
Stanford vocabulary.
Although liquor problems were far from their
peak in 1900, in February of that year Sequoia
sounded the first warning rumble of the storm
that was to come. Commenting on an unfortunate
incident in the City the night of the Big Game,
Sequoia moralized:
"The freshman who has never before known in
toxication, who knows barely the taste of liquor,

must 'enthuse' that night and advertise to the city
his drunkenness."
As tradition became entrenched, liquor prob
lems increased yearly.. By the end of 1900 Dr.
David Starr Jordan, the University's first presi
dent, recognized that the frequency of liquor on
campus was mushrooming. And although many
students were "coming in drunk through the win
dows |of Encina| to sleep with their boots on,"
Dr. Jordan was having a hard time catching them.
Two prominent alumni of the "Pioneer Class"
wanted to nip the liquor problem in the bud by
establishing a "Princeton Inn" outside the Palo
Alto city limits. The "Inn" would control the sale
of liquor and not tolerate drunkenness. However,
with the disapproval of the administration, the
plan was dropped.
In 1903 Mayfield went dry and "Mayfield Road"
became "Menlo Road." However, Menlo did not
cater to Stanford students and the shift to liquor
on campus was made.
Finally, in 190(3, there was a shake-up in the
Committee on Student Affairs which made the
student body think all pressure was removed, and
to quote Stanford historian Orrin Leslie Elliott:
"The 'booze' element took advantage of the op
portunity, and the beer wagon procession, nightly
orgies, drunken parades, noisy outbreaks of vul
garity and worse presently proclaimed a 'wide
open' Stanford."
