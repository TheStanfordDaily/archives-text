# Labor Party Urges West to Summit Talks
## 
### 
LONDON (/P) Prime Minister
Macmillan s Conservative govern
ment faces renewed demands for
a prompt summit meeting of the
Western powers with the Soviet
Union.
Pressure for such a meeting is
expected to develop soon after
Parliament reconvenes today af
ter its Christmas recess. Already
cries for summit talks are echo
ing in a wide segment of the
British Laborites, among opposi
tion Laborites and more quietly
even among some Conservatives.
West Can Accept
A belief has developed in Labor
ranks that the West can accept
the Soviet proposals for a meet
ing of the leaders of the great
powers and even beat the Krem
lin at the propaganda game if
the Russians want to play that
way.
Those who take this view be
lieve the West loses ground in
the propaganda battle by stand
ing pat and insisting on condi
tions before agreeing to summit
talks.
Labor Opinion
One influential segment of la
bor opinion runs this way: If
such a conference comes to no
immediate solutions, "Let's over
trump — let's suggest a second
summit conference — let's keep
the thing going."
In other words, if all the Rus
sians are after is propaganda the
first conference will expose their
position and a second conference
would hammer the point home to
the whole world.
President Eisenhower and Mac
millan have left the door open to
Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulga
nin's call for summit talks. But
both Western leaders have
stressed that the cause of world
peace might be damaged by sum
mit talks which failed.
