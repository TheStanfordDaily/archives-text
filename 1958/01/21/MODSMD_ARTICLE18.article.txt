# Music to Be Topic For 'Series' Talk
## 
### 
liughson F. Mooney, instructor
in history, will discuss the theory
that music reflects the era in
which it is popular at the Tues
day Evening Series at 7:30 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
He will sample musical tastes
from 1906 to the present day,
skipping the World War II years,
because he feels that no song
characteristic of the period
emerged long enough to gain a
permanent spot in the nation's
repertoire.
