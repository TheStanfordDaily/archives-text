# Convicted Reds Released by Appeals Court
## Decision Says Court Reduced Smith Act To 'Virtual Shambles 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (JP) Eleven
persons convicted of Communist
activities in violation of the Smith
Aet were freed yesterday by a
U.S. Court of Appeals decision
which said that act had been re
duced to a "virtual shambles" by
the Supreme Court.
The 11 included Joe Hall, right
hand man in Hawaii of Harry
Bridges, the West Coast longshore
boss.
Hall, who has figured in labor
troubles with Hawaii's multi-mil
lion dollar sugar and pineapple
industries, said in Honolulu on
hearing of the decision he "al
ways had confidence that the
higher court would reverse the
convictions."
Acted Reluctantly
But yesterday's decision, affect
ing seven convicted in Honolulu
and four in Seattle, was so worded
as to make clear the court acted
reluctantly.
Judge Richard IL Chambers
wrote that the Supreme Court de
cision of last June "leaves the
Smith Act, as to any further
prosecution under it, a virtual
shambles."
Two other judges concurred in
reversal of the convictions. But
they expressed as "unnecessary to
the decision" Judge Chamber's
comment about the effect of the
Supreme Court on future prosecu
tions under the Smith Act.
On Membership
Last June, the Supreme Court
ruled that mere membership in
the Communist Party was not suf
ficient ground for Smith Act con
victions. The decision said
"preaching abstractly" was not <i
crime under the act.
The decision was based on the
conviction of 14 persons, including
Oleta O'Connor Yates, in Califor
nia and freed five of the 14. The
federal government then asked
dismissal of charges against the
other nine.
In Honolulu yesterday, Louis B.
Blissard, U.S. attorney, said he
agreed wholeheartedly with Judge
Chambers that the "Yates deci
sion leaves the Smith Act, as to
further prosecution under it, a vir
tual shambles." Judge Chambers'
court previously had upheld the
Yates case convictions.
Among those ordered freed
with Hall in the Hawaii case were
Charles K. Fujimoto, former
chairman of the Communist Par
ty in the islands, and his wile,
Aileen, a member of the party's
executive board.

hearing of the decision he "al
ways had confidence that the
higher court would reverse the
convictions."
Acted Reluctantly
But yesterday's decision, affect
ing seven convicted in Honolulu
and four in Seattle, was so worded
as to make clear the court acted
reluctantly.
Judge Richard IL Chambers
wrote that the Supreme Court de
cision of last June "leaves the
Smith Act, as to any further
prosecution under it, a virtual
shambles."
Two other judges concurred in
reversal of the convictions. But
they expressed as "unnecessary to
the decision" Judge Chamber's
comment about the effect of the
Supreme Court on future prosecu
tions under the Smith Act.
On Membership
Last June, the Supreme Court
ruled that mere membership in
the Communist Party was not suf
ficient ground for Smith Act con
victions. The decision said
"preaching abstractly" was not <i
crime under the act.
The decision was based on the
conviction of 14 persons, including
Oleta O'Connor Yates, in Califor
nia and freed five of the 14. The
federal government then asked
dismissal of charges against the
other nine.
In Honolulu yesterday, Louis B.
Blissard, U.S. attorney, said he
agreed wholeheartedly with Judge
Chambers that the "Yates deci
sion leaves the Smith Act, as to
further prosecution under it, a vir
tual shambles." Judge Chambers'
court previously had upheld the
Yates case convictions.
Among those ordered freed
with Hall in the Hawaii case were
Charles K. Fujimoto, former
chairman of the Communist Par
ty in the islands, and his wile,
Aileen, a member of the party's
executive board.
SAN FRANCISCO (JP) Eleven
persons convicted of Communist
activities in violation of the Smith
Aet were freed yesterday by a
U.S. Court of Appeals decision
which said that act had been re
duced to a "virtual shambles" by
the Supreme Court.
The 11 included Joe Hall, right
hand man in Hawaii of Harry
Bridges, the West Coast longshore
boss.
Hall, who has figured in labor
troubles with Hawaii's multi-mil
lion dollar sugar and pineapple
industries, said in Honolulu on
hearing of the decision he "al
ways had confidence that the
higher court would reverse the
convictions."
