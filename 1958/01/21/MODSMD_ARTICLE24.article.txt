# That 'Mysterious' Will
## 
### 
Yf.sterday The Daily started publishing tliat
mysterious document, Mrs. Stanford's Will.
'Needless to say, 11 it* first installment and the
one which appears today reveal nothing about
keeping boo/e from the clutching hands of
Stanford students, prevention of all attempts
for a gasping undergraduate to light a cig
arette between classes and the maintenance of
campus roads resembling an antitank course so
that all students are forced to drive at 7 m.p.h.
None of these and other myths appear in the
Will. Mrs. Stanford's Will is merely a state
ment of how Mrs. Stanford wanted her prop
erty divided up after her passing—in other
words, just what most persons would expect
to find in a will.
The document which contains some provis
ions tliat Leland and Jane Lathrop Stanford
wished to see instituted at the University is
the Founding Grant. These provisions are not
particularly relevant to the life of present-day
Stanford students, either. The Daily will ex
amine the Founding Grunt when the current
series on Mrs. Stanford's Will is completed.
Well then, why is the Daily publishing the
\\ ill in its entirety?
The first reason is to squelch some of the
rumors concerning the \\ ill which periodically
sweep the campus.

A second and more important reason is to
give everyone a chance to read the document
and to see how harmless il is. Many students
have taken the Will for granted when some
controversial matter conies up. Instead of seek
ing a satisfactory solution to such problems as,
say, drinking on the campus, someone always
says something like: "What can we do about
it? It's in Mrs. Stanford's Will, and that's
that." The publication of the Will undoubtedly
will complicate things a hit: people will have
to think out solutions to problems that they
can no longer brush off on some mysterious,
all-powerfu I document.
In addition, we've done some research con
cerning the origin of some of the rumors and
regulations attributed to the \\ ill. The truth
about these traditional Stanford taboos will
be published in a series of articles which will
accompany the \\ ill. The first article deals
with past University problem's on the liquor
question, and starts today on page one.
Incidentally, a few persons are wondering
where we unearthed Mrs. Stanford's Will. The
original document is in San Jose; our source
was none other than the Daily Palo Alto for
March 6, 1905, where the Will was published
following Mrs. Stanford's death.

question, and starts today on page one.
Incidentally, a few persons are wondering
where we unearthed Mrs. Stanford's Will. The
original document is in San Jose; our source
was none other than the Daily Palo Alto for
March 6, 1905, where the Will was published
following Mrs. Stanford's death.
Yf.sterday The Daily started publishing tliat
mysterious document, Mrs. Stanford's Will.
'Needless to say, 11 it* first installment and the
one which appears today reveal nothing about
keeping boo/e from the clutching hands of
Stanford students, prevention of all attempts
for a gasping undergraduate to light a cig
arette between classes and the maintenance of
campus roads resembling an antitank course so
that all students are forced to drive at 7 m.p.h.
None of these and other myths appear in the
Will. Mrs. Stanford's Will is merely a state
ment of how Mrs. Stanford wanted her prop
erty divided up after her passing—in other
words, just what most persons would expect
to find in a will.
The document which contains some provis
ions tliat Leland and Jane Lathrop Stanford
wished to see instituted at the University is
the Founding Grant. These provisions are not
particularly relevant to the life of present-day
Stanford students, either. The Daily will ex
amine the Founding Grunt when the current
series on Mrs. Stanford's Will is completed.
Well then, why is the Daily publishing the
\\ ill in its entirety?
The first reason is to squelch some of the
rumors concerning the \\ ill which periodically
sweep the campus.

A second and more important reason is to
give everyone a chance to read the document
and to see how harmless il is. Many students
have taken the Will for granted when some
controversial matter conies up. Instead of seek
ing a satisfactory solution to such problems as,
say, drinking on the campus, someone always
says something like: "What can we do about
it? It's in Mrs. Stanford's Will, and that's
that." The publication of the Will undoubtedly
will complicate things a hit: people will have
to think out solutions to problems that they
can no longer brush off on some mysterious,
all-powerfu I document.
In addition, we've done some research con
cerning the origin of some of the rumors and
regulations attributed to the \\ ill. The truth
about these traditional Stanford taboos will
be published in a series of articles which will
accompany the \\ ill. The first article deals
with past University problem's on the liquor
question, and starts today on page one.
