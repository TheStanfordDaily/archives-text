Unfortunate Error
Editor, The Daily:
Normally one is prepared to let Daily reports
take their course, but I must correct the account
of my "Report on Harvard" which appeared to
day.
I am reported to have said that "It is not the
strongly orthodox (Biblical i men who have the
most to say about the cultural questions within
a university." Take out the "not" and you have
it, though the phraseology it not mine. What I
trie 1 to say is that it is Biblical and classical
Christianity (whether or not it is "dogmatically
Trinitarian") which appears to contribute most
usefully to the cultural debate.

Editor, The Daily:
In The Daily of Monday, Jan. 20, under the
heading "For Better and for WUS," the following
contest was reported: "The floor in Wilbur that
donates the most per capita will have its beds
made by a Branner corridor." The girls of Bran
ner have earned our commendations for being
such good sports. They deserve something in
return.
We of Crothers Memorial are not in such con
stant intimate contact with the girls of Branner
as are the Wilbur men. (We are just out of me
dium size telescope range.) By tradition fresh
man girls are not among the acquaintances of
graduate engineers. Nevertheless, we do not be
lieve in discrimination. To us all Stanford worn

en are crated [sir] equally. We do not wish to ,
permit our unfamiliarity with these Indian maid
ens to stem our enthusiasm for the WUS drive
Therefore, by popular demand, a sign-up list
will be posted in Cro Mem for volunteers to make
the beds of the corridor in Branner which do
nates the most per capita. As you know, the
study habits of engineers are peculiar because of
the heavy load, and we do our best work late ir
the evening. Therefore, with regard to the bed
of the girls of Branner, we would prefer to mak
them between the hours of 11 p.m. and midnight
For further details, we ask the social chair
women of Branner to place a note in the mail
box of Room 420, Crothers Memorial. Our hopr
is that: the example of unselfish giving by the
girls of Branner will help promote this WUS
drive.

Salary terms were not disclosed, but a Salt

graduate engineers. Nevertheless, we do not be
lieve in discrimination. To us all Stanford worn

en are crated [sir] equally. We do not wish to ,
permit our unfamiliarity with these Indian maid
ens to stem our enthusiasm for the WUS drive
Therefore, by popular demand, a sign-up list
will be posted in Cro Mem for volunteers to make
the beds of the corridor in Branner which do
nates the most per capita. As you know, the
study habits of engineers are peculiar because of
the heavy load, and we do our best work late ir
the evening. Therefore, with regard to the bed
of the girls of Branner, we would prefer to mak
them between the hours of 11 p.m. and midnight
For further details, we ask the social chair
women of Branner to place a note in the mail
box of Room 420, Crothers Memorial. Our hopr
is that: the example of unselfish giving by the
girls of Branner will help promote this WUS
drive.

Normally one is prepared to let Daily reports
take their course, but I must correct the account
of my "Report on Harvard" which appeared to
day.
I am reported to have said that "It is not the
strongly orthodox (Biblical i men who have the
most to say about the cultural questions within
a university." Take out the "not" and you have
it, though the phraseology it not mine. What I
trie 1 to say is that it is Biblical and classical
Christianity (whether or not it is "dogmatically
Trinitarian") which appears to contribute most
usefully to the cultural debate.

In The Daily of Monday, Jan. 20, under the

donates the most per capita will have its beds
made by a Branner corridor." The girls of Bran

such good sports. They deserve something in
return.
We of Crothers Memorial are not in such con

as are the Wilbur men. (We are just out of me
dium size telescope range.) By tradition fresh
man girls are not among the acquaintances of
graduate engineers. Nevertheless, we do not be
