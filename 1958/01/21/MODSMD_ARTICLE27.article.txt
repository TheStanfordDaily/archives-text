# Statue Falls, But Stanford Rolls On

ford Junior University was
rocking and rolling in last Wed
nesday's feature in the scries
on Stanford history. Today we
see the University's rapid re
covery from the 1906 temblor
and the turning of attention to
the vineyard.)

When campus residents were
tossed out of bed on the morning
of April IS, 1906, they encoun
tered an eerie sight. Masses of
steam—reminiscent of a volcano
—were rising from Engineering
Corner while a fine bluish dust
mixed with steam from broken
lines in Memorial Church and
Memorial Arch.
Agassiz, the pompous statue
atop a ledge of Ihe Zoology Build
ing, now Jordan Hall, had ef
fected a dive from his perch, only
to find someone had let the wa
ter out of the pool—at least that's
the way hi 4 appeared to specta
tors!

to say, I'm still alive! Good-bye
if the earth swallows us up. . . ."
Agassiz was up to his should
ers in concrete—his legs in the
air and hand held out gracefully.
This sight amidst the ruins made
even the most sober laugh—and
one fellow went up and shook
hands with him.
Aid Sent
Faculty and students joined
with townspeople to send aid to
stricken San Francisco. The
quake came on Wednesday, and
by Sunday nearly all students
were on the way home.
What to do with the 190G grad
uating class was a' problem. 11
was settled by voting degrees to
all those up in their studies at
the time of the quake and having
the others take examinations in
: September. Commencement was
j held Sept. 15.
It didn't take Nature to add ex
citement to the campus., Things
got off to a right jolly start —
with the girls turning down the
boys' invitation to a dance at En
cina the first week of school. A
note was sent to the effect that
the "young ladies preferred not
to dance at this early date and
on the slight acquaintance."
The boys retaliated with a note
saying they would not be able to
receive them.
Common Sense
One male expressed his opinion
in a letter to a chum: "... 1 think
the girls showed good common
horse sense. Don't you? I would
n't want my sister to dance with
some of the fellows here under
any circumstances."
A favorite spot frequented by
the students was the Stanford
vineyard. Finally a mounted
watchman was put on guard dur
ing the night.
One young man, after a raid
on the vineyard, burst into a
room by mistake—il belonged to
a professor. There he sat with
another professor with a "big
newspaperful of grapes of the
vineyard color and they were
munching away as calmly as
though they had bought them
from Brocchi, the fruit man at
Mayfield."

It didn't take Nature to add ex
citement to the campus., Things
got off to a right jolly start —
with the girls turning down the
boys' invitation to a dance at En
cina the first week of school. A
note was sent to the effect that
the "young ladies preferred not
to dance at this early date and
on the slight acquaintance."
The boys retaliated with a note
saying they would not be able to
receive them.
Common Sense
One male expressed his opinion
in a letter to a chum: "... 1 think
the girls showed good common
horse sense. Don't you? I would
n't want my sister to dance with
some of the fellows here under
any circumstances."
A favorite spot frequented by
the students was the Stanford
vineyard. Finally a mounted
watchman was put on guard dur
ing the night.
One young man, after a raid
on the vineyard, burst into a
room by mistake—il belonged to
a professor. There he sat with
another professor with a "big
newspaperful of grapes of the
vineyard color and they were
munching away as calmly as
though they had bought them
from Brocchi, the fruit man at
Mayfield."

covery from the 1906 temblor
and the turning of attention to
the vineyard.)

When campus residents were
tossed out of bed on the morning
of April IS, 1906, they encoun

steam—reminiscent of a volcano
—were rising from Engineering
Corner while a fine bluish dust
mixed with steam from broken
lines in Memorial Church and
Memorial Arch.
Agassiz, the pompous statue
atop a ledge of Ihe Zoology Build

Agassiz was up to his should

This sight amidst the ruins made
even the most sober laugh—and
