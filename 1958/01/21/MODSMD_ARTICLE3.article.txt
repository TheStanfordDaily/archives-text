## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€”Military experts have told Congress the Unit
ed States could sustain an initial surprise attack by the Soviet Union
and still recover sufficiently to annihilate Russia.
The experts believe this country is ahead of Russia in the over all
missile field and can come pretty close to sending a rocket to the

moon by the end of 1938 if Con
gress is willing to put up enough
money.
These and other views were giv
en lo the House Appropriations
Committee last week during
closed-door hearings on the ad
ministration's $1,260,000,000 emer
gency program to speed up mis
sile work and spread out bases
for retaliatory strikes by long
range planes carrying hydrogen
bombs.
Senator Johnson
At another closed session Inst
week, Sen. Johnson of Texas, the
Senate's Democratic leader, was
disclosed lo have suggested that
Congress may have to take the
initiative from the White House to
build up U.S. Air and missile
power.
A censored account of proceed
ings before the Senate Prepared
ness Subcommittee last Thursday
recorded Johnson as saying at one
point: "I would say the executive
lias as yet not proposed any in
crease . .. We may have to initiate
it here."
Public Testimony
The House Appropriations group
made its testimony public as it
called a meeting for today to act
formally on President Eisenhow
er's request for additional defense
funds. Indications were that the
committee would approve the re
quest without major change and
might even recommcnd more
money.
Included in the funds, for the
fiscal year ending June 30, are
296 million dollars to expedite
construction of three atomic sub
marines capable of filing from
under water the 1,500-mile range
Polaris missile.
Representative Mahon < D.-
Tex, i, chairman of the 13-man
subcommittee that considered the
money request, said its major
purpose was "to buy valuable
time, in the areas where time is
essential . . . ."
