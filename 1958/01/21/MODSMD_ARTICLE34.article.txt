## 
### Steve Baffrey 
A not-quite-full house found plenty to yell about last night as the
Stanford Indians fell to the Oregon State Beavers 68-59 in the Stan
ford Pavilion, with the Indians threatening throughout ihe second
half and a number of officiating calls resting on the borderline.
Beaver forwards Daw Gambee and Ken Nanson tied for the

: night's top point honors with 1!»
| counters apiece in pacing the
! Staters to the win. Stanford sub
i Mike Tipton, playing the last 12
: minutes of the game, turned in
one of this year's finest perform
ances to lead the Indians with 13.
Control was the key word in
the Oregon State win, offensively
and defensively. Slats Gill and
Ins company managed to keep
the Indians far enough away
from the basket on ol'l'ense, a rid
the basketball on defense to come
away with their nine-point mar
gin.
Stanford was able to match the
visitors almost point-for-point in
the early minutes of the game,!
managing to grab 3-2 and 7-0
leads up to three minutes in, but
when the Beavers took the lead
i at 8-7 it was "we're ahead" all the
| way for them.
(8 Points Behind
j Stanford battled gamely, though,
despite their inability to keep
I their hands on the ball enough of
the lime; 18 points separated the
! two squads at halftime, an indi
cation n| Oregon State's superior
play throughout, the opening half.
Coach Ifowie Dallmar's Indians
came back 1o put a scare into the
Beavers in the second half. Stan
ford did better' on the boards, Dick
Haga managing to keep Gambee
I somewhat in check, and Neat
Brockmeyer watcher Beaver cen
ter Gary Goble more closely.
Through ten minutes in Ihe sec-;
ond half Stanford had out scored
the visitors 17-11 and then the;
locals shifted into high gear. In
closing the gap to only seven:
| points, 54-47, Stanford put a cover
on their basket for four minutes
! before Gambee finally broke the
ice with a pair of free throws.
Nanson Finishes Up
Nanson stepped in for the Stat
ers at this point and proceeded to
sew it up for them, scoring nine
of the remaining 11 points which
OSC put through the hoop.
The Indians counted with ten

j more but time and the Beavers
were too much for- them. It was
100 large an assignment and they
were 100 long gelling hot.
Close officiating produced a
total of 40 fold calls with four
players forced out of the game on
this account. OSC lost Jim Ander
son and Gambee while Paul New
mann and Brockmeyer left the
game for Stanford.
Beaver shooters hit 25 of 52
field goals for a 48.1 per cent
mark while the besl the Indians
could do was 17 out of 40 for
36.9.
