# THE
						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
Curtice Arrival = Hig-Time Football
Down in Los Angeles, from whence eminates most of the specula
tion concerning what will happen in the way of new conferences, the
hiring of -luck Curth e by Stanford has provided another dish of food
for thought.
Paul Zimmerman, in his Pos Angeles Times' "Sportscrlpts"
column, devoted 22 inches of copy to wondering out loud what
Curtice's coming to Stanford might or might not mean.
Here, in tlie main, is what Zimmerman thinks about the situation:
There seems to be a fairly obvious I'act about Jack Curtice
signing to couch Stanford's football team for the next five years.
. . . He must have known when tie left Utah for The Farm that
the Indians intend to play in the same league with California,
Southern California unci UCPA, although Ihe adminis'iation has
not announced its hi tent ions.
It isn't likely that Curtice would leave the Skyline Conference
to join Stanford with Ihe remnants of the Pacific ( oast group, be
cause they hardly will have a higher standing when Ihe breakup
comes.
There would he no point in kissing k f 'Oil i»y a salary of
$15,000 jilus $1)000 worth of radio and television opportunities at
Sail 1 <ake it Stanford plans to downgrade its brand of football . . .
The circumstances (Shrine coaching job at Stanford; Ins Ciali
team leading the nation in passing; scaring the daylights out of
Army) were on bis side and he took advantage of them. Prom that
time on everyone knew lie could have the coaching job (here if
be wanted it.
P.S.: That lie did points the direction in which Stanford's loot
hall future is going.

So, them wo have another reason as to why someone thinks
Stan lord will go along with USC, UCLA, and Cu). Actually, it's not
as it' there were a lot of people thinking Stanford isn't going to stick
with the other three California-schools. Nothing official has been

said, of course, but President
Wallace Sterling's firm statement
that "Stanford will and should
continue vigorously to participate
in intercollegiate athletics,"
doesn't leave much room for play
ing a cle-emphasized program with
what'll be left of the PCC. Sched
uling of games with the Bears,
Kruins, and Trojans for 196.1-62
also makes it pretty clear that
ihese schools aren't going to fall
by the wayside as Card oppon
ents.
When we talked with Curtice
before he had been officially
hired, he said he'd talked the PCC
situation over with Stanford au
thorities, but that he had no in
side word on what was going to
happen. Which of course makes
sense, because who does know
what'll bo the final result?
Speaking of Curtice, he'll be
at Stanford next Monday and
Tuesday to make his first ap-

pearanoe as the new head coach. There'll be the expected rounds of
press conferences, meetings with officials, and a stop at the E'ALO
Club's Million Dollar Banquet. In addition, and of special interest
to Stanford students will be a 4:15 get-together in Mem Aud on
Tuesday where Curtice will say a few words to the student body.
Chuck Taylor said yesterday that it's a tentative appearance right
now, but will be held if interest is shown. Taylor promised it'll be
nothing lengthy, formal, or rah-rah just an opportunity to hear a
few words from a new Stanford mentor who has quite a reputation
as an entertaining talker.
And, back to Curtice again, this time with the full story of the
"summer camp" part of his reported salary (a report which is not
official). The rumor mills have placed the figure at $17,000 per year,
plus $2000 for a summer camp job.
The camp will be the Stanford Coaching Camp, brought onto the
campus for the first time. In previous years, a similar camp was
conducted in Palo Alto by Taylor as a private enterprise. The Uni
versity liked the idea, so have taken over .the program with Taylor
as its administrative head.
Boys attending the sessions will probably live in Toyon, with
meals at the eating clubs or some other cafeteria facility on campus.
Howie Dallmar, Dutch Fehring, Payton Jordan, and Tom Haynie are
among the members of the Stanford coaching staff who will work
on the summer program, and Curtice, too, will have the opportunity
to serve on the camp staff.
A RANDOM THOUGHT—Last night's game with OSC was the
first Monday PCC game the Indians have played in a long, long time.
Don Liebendorfer couldn't remember when the last one was. Howie
Dallmar thought it might have been in the conference playoffs in
1942.
OMEN OF THINGS TO COME? Four of the past five Stanford
football coaches, Pop Warner, Tiny Thornhill, Clark Shaughncssy,
and Chuck Taylor, took Stanford to I ho Rose Bowl in their first year
on the job.
