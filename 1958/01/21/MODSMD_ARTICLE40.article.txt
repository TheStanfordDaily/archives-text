Neumann (No. 25, 170 lbs.,
i 6-1, 19 -year -old junior from
Costa Mesa) was touted before
last season opened as the best
young prospect the Indians had
had in a number of years, and
he has justified this statement.
Placing second in scoring on
the squad last year, he was also
rated as fifth in the conference
in field goal percentage. He
does everything well and has
good poise. Major: psychology.

Tipton (No. 23, 165 lbs., 6-2%,
19-year-old sophomore from
Casper, Wyo. i was second high
scorer for the freshman team a
year ago. A stylish shooter, he
has a good eye, but is about
average in other departments.
He is very eager to learn, how
ever, and should have a good
basketball future. His accu
racy from the floor may prove
very helpful to the squad this
year. Major: economics.
