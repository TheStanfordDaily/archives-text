# MORAL VICTORY
## Closing Spurt Falls Shy; Frosh Lose to OC, 70-67 
### Alan Miller 
Stanford's Papooses came with
in two points of the San Fran
cisco Olympic Club AAIJ five last
night in the closing seconds of the
game but lost the ball, fouled, and
slipped under for a 70-67 final
count.
Played on the local hardwood,
this was definitely the best per
formance of the squad this sea
son. Stanford basketball coach Eiill
Turner exclaimed, "The boys
really looked good. Everyone did
their best and they played like a
real team."
Little gua r d Bub Bowling
sparked the locals with his driv
ing spirit, excellent ball handling,
and consistently accurate long
jump shots.
Papooses Break Ice
Stanford scored first in the
tilt and took an early lead as
coach Carl Minetti's Winged O's
looked unorganized. But midway
in the half the Club pulled ahead
with Ron Tomsic, former Stan
ford man, doing most of the scor
ing in the sea-saw battle that fol
lowed. As the buzzer went off
ihe Papooses were on the low end
of a 35-37 score. Tall Bruce An-1
derson and Bob Whelan helped
the locals outrebound their op
ponents 28-18. Stanford sunk 37
per cent of its first half shots to
Ihe Club's 32 per cent.
The past college stars pulled
further ahead in the second half
and at one time Stanford was 11
points behind. For a while it ap
peared that'the locals were going
to have a second half slump like
they did against Cal Friday night.
But this wasn't the story. The lo
cals came alive, scored 10 points
in less than 4 minutes and short
ened the margin to 69-64 with two
minutes and four seconds remain
ing in the contest.
Margin Narrows
Instead of freezing the ball, at
this point Olympic star Ken Weg
ner dribbled into the key where
he fouled a Stanford player. The

Papooses made the first shot,
missed the second but lipped it
in for a three. The margin was
only 69-67 now. The City quintet
missed their next shot attempt
and Stanford grabbed ihe re
bound to immediately call time
with only 45 seconds remaining.
Bowling then tried to get down
court but lost the ball. In the
frantic frenzy to try to regain
possession, Stanford fouled their
opponents, only to have them
score the charity shot.
Moral Win
This was an obvious moral vic
tory for the yearlings as the
Olympic Club is composed of past
Coast All-Stars who are taller,
heavier, older, and more expe
rienced though perhaps not go
ing all out until tournament time.
Bowling led the night's scor
ing with 19, his highest in a single
game. Tom Norland hit 16, Gary
Estabrook 11, and Morgan Met
caff 8.
Tomsic grapped 15 for the AAIT
five. Wegner had 14, Russ Lawler
12, and Ted Romanoff, 10.
