## Eisenhower Gives Talk at GOP Dinner 
### 
CHICAGO (/P)—President Eisen
hower, launching the 1958 drive
for a GOP Congress, told the na
tion last night America's security
has been "markedly strength
ened" during his five years in of
fice."
In an address at a $100-a-plate
party dinner and for a coast-to
coast television-radio audience,
the President pledged his adminis
tration "will keep tlie nation's de
fense strong" to deal with the
Soviet threat.
Sixth Year
And Eisenhower, who started
his sixth yeai' as President yes
terday, called for election in No
vember of a GOP "team of all
stars" in culmination of the party
drive to take over control of Con
gress from the Democrats.
But even while the President
was taking issue with the Demo
crats who contend America's de
fenses are becoming weaker un
der his administration, Eisenhow
er insisted the matter of Unit,ed
States security—and differences
over it—must be kept out of poli
tics. Eisenhower, speaking in Chi
cago's International Amphithea
ter, where he was nominated in
1952; put it this way:
First Objective
"Our first objective—security
and a just peace—is not a par
tisan or political matter. Ameri
cans must never and will never
let the issue of security and peace
become a pawn in anyone's po
litical chess game."
Meanwhile, the President's
chief aide, Sherman Adams, in
addressing another GOP dinner
rally in Minneapolis was accusing
the Democrats of "politicking
with national defense."
Adams—who often does the po
litical slugging while Eisenhower
stands aloof —asserted the Demo
crats ought to know better and
added:
"As a matter of fact, they
ought to be called strictly to ac
count by the American people for
using this subject as party glue.
I'll simply say this: We Republi
cans greet the opposition on this
battlefield with as much anticipa
tion as any other they can con
jure up."
