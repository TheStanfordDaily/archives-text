# Rules Changed In WUS Contest
## 
### 
As Winter Drive entered its
second day. Drives Committee
announced a change in the con
test for Wilbur freshmen.
The floor that collects the most
per person will have a floor of
Branner women make their beds,
and the floor in Wilbur that col
lects the second highest amount
per capita will make the beds of
the winners in Branner.
The commit tec thought this
more of an honor than a booby
prize.
