I hereby direct and it is my will that each and all of the bequests

in whole or in part, at the discretion and option of my executors,
be paid partly in such bonds and partly in money, each bond of the
par value of one thousand dollars being taken and considered as the
equivalent in value of one thousand dollars in money, and bonds
of the par value of five hundred dollars as tho equivalent in value

Junior University, and I now feel .justified in enlarging, as I have
done in this will, my bequests to my relatives and friends and differ
