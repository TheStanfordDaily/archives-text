# Give to WUS
## 
### 
For better or for worse this is the campaign
slogan of tliis year's \\ inter Drive for the
World University Service.
In addition to an overly cute slogan, the
campaign includes such stunts as a jazz hand at
Engineering Corner, freshman men and fresh
man women getting slightly confused as to
whose bed they're making and prominent fac
ulty members hashing lor splashing) dinners
in the prize-winning residences.
If students need to have charity appeals
masked in the guise of undergraduate funâ€”
we have no objections as long as the gimmicks
work and the students do contribute. But let's
remember that the World University Service
is doing a serious job, and an important one.
It provides for student housing and health
programs in under-developed countries. In Cal
cutta 3,000 university students today study
under street lamps and sleep on sidewalks.
At the I niversity of Mysore, 600 students
must depend on five textbooks. WUS sends
new books and laboratory equipment to these
areas.
Perhaps the most dramatic recent illustra
tion of the organization's work was the re
location and rehabilitation of thousands of
student refugees and leaders in the Hungarian

uprising. Hundreds of scholarships were pro
vided and government red tape was snapped to
get these students admitted to universities
throughout the free world.
And despite this obvious need, Stanford
last year received more aid from WUS in the
form of scholarships than Stanford students
contributed to the program. Does this mean
we're too stingy, too indifferent or too broke
to help brothers across the sea?
Too broke? Not judging by the Friday
afternoon crowds at Rossotti's. Too indiffer
ent? IVrhaps, or maybe we just don't realize
or. to use an old cliche, "stop to count our
blessings."
Too stingy? No, we don't believe Stanford
students are. We know we are capable of
sympathizing with the hundreds of thousands
of young people like ourselves who are work
ing to educate themselves and their nations.
The 20-year-old student sleeping under that
street light in Calcutta is a future leader of
his country. Let's remember that and stretch
a hand around the world to build good will
while we can.
We can all afford to contribute a little
something to the cause of peace and the ban
ishment of ignorance and prejudices from the
globe.
