## Print Violators' Names 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
What is the purpose of The Daily's policy of
not printing the names of Stanford students who
tr>~~'e v"h the law? Students who break the
lav. ' r commit Honor Code violations should be
given the publicity they deserve. Stanford stu
dents are supposedly mature enough to know
right from wrong, and if a student chooses to do
wrong, he should not be protected from the con
sequences of publicity. The customary policy of
keeping secret the names of children who pos
sibly might not realize they are doing wrong
when they break a law is fine, but Stanford stu
dents are not children. Perhaps if the names of
those, involved in law-breaking or Honor Code
violations were printed in Daily articles, there
would be fewer such incidents.

Editor's Nolo: If is a University policy not
to release the names of those who are charged
or even convicted of Honor Code or Funda
mental Standard violations. The Daily is al
lowed to cover these stories and to send a re
porter to Judicial Council hearings of cases —
with the strict provision that no names b<»
printed. This is one policy we must adhere to,
whether we like it or not.
