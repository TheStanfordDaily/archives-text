the liquor problem on campus.)

"If we happen to be playing
|football| on the Stanford field
then it is that the amber fluid
runs red. Fraternity houses are
opened wide to fittingly celebrate
the occasion, bottles and heads
are cracked, kegs are fauceted,
and the froth gurgles forth in
beauteous melody, later to be dis
placed by the ribald and obscene
songs of the cultured and edu
cated drinkers."
This was an anonymous writ
er's comment on Stanford's "wide
open" campus of 1906-08. Besides
a descriptive pen, the writer
showed a certain amount of clair
voyance when he went on to say.
"Unless something is done pretty
soon . . . something is going to
drop pretty hard."
Believing the general carous
ing and drunkenness to be a
threat to the community, Dr. R.
L. Wilbur headed a group of cam
pus residents who intended to do
something about the situation.
Dead Drunk
The group was about to take
action when on Feb. 5, 1908,
things came to a head. A drunk
student returning from Menlo
entered the wrong house in Palo
Alto. He was mistaken for a
burglar and was shot to death.
Immediately the trustees went
into action and passed a resolu
tion naming drunkenness as
grounds for suspension. A new
Committee on Student Affairs
was appointed, but an unfortu
nate choice was made in naming
Professor Arthur B. Clark chair
man.
Professor Clark had been may
or of Mayficld (now South Palo
Alto) and was responsible for
"cleaning up" the town. Needless
to say, he was not popular with
the student body.
A proclamation of the trustees
on March 12, 1908, in connection
with the liquor problem brought
on one of Stanford's most famous
parades.
The demonstrators, many of
whom were in the condition for
which they could now be legally
suspended, paraded to the Clark

house and demanded a statement
from Clark. Mrs. Clark informed
the mob that her husband was
not at home, whereupon (accord
ing to some accounts) insults
were freely hurled at Mrs. Clark.
Dissatisfied, the paraders
moved on. They returned to the
center of the campus and dis
rupted the library with demon
strations. Finally the procession
ended in Memorial Court where
the proclamation was burned in
effigy.
In the scramble that followed
the outbreak, the Committee on
Student Affairs was able to lay
hands on only 12 slow-footed par
ticipants. The "12" (second only
to the "Immortal 21") were im
mediately suspended.
Racking their brains, student
body leaders finally settled on a
plan of action, and a petition ad
mitting participation in the pa
rade and demanding equal treat
ment or reinstatement was circu
lated. The "247" signers took
iheir place in Stanford history.
Participants Penalized
Amidst wild outcries, the com
mittee methodically heard the
story of each signer. After the
inquest the committee doled out
sentences ranging from dismis
sal to added units required for
graduation to suspension of 41
seniors for two months.
Many demanded a mass walk

out. However, a walkout petition
failed to set the required signers
and in several days it was re
called and burned.
Agitation continued through
out the spring of 1908 and prom
inent alumni over the state gave
varying opinions. Despite criti
cism hurled at it, the Committee
on Student Affairs remained
firm, and over the summer the
trustees took further action to
enforce prohibition in future
leases to student clubs on cam
pus.
Students Subdued
Dr. Jordan, overjoyed at the
outcome of many years' strife,
wrote, "The general tone of ev
erything relating to student af
fairs has been raised since the
beery conviviality ceased to be a
part of student tradition."
Orrin Elliott, surveying Stan
ford's liquor history back in 1933,
wrote, "Dr. Jordan was overjubi
lant, as was his temperament and
as later history would unfortu
nately disclose."

Parting the vapors which
shroud the Will, one clearly sees
that Stanford's dryness cannot be
attributed to Mrs. Stanford. Al
though the myth is squashed, the
problem remains, and it is inter
esting to note that Elliott's ob
servation of 23 years ago is still
applicable.
