# Suppress Contrary Views?
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Several days ago, in response to your editorial
endorsing "Pat" Brown for the governorship,
one of the more reactionary members of this
rather conservative student body expressed him
self on the subject of the duty owed the students
by a campus newspaper. His opinion was, in
brief, that the newspaper should in its editorial
views reflect the majority opinion prevalent
among the students. The price for not so doing
seems to be the closing down of the newspaper.
The reasons why a campus newspaper should
reflect the majority campus opinion are hard to
discover. Is it because the reputation of the cam
pus is judged, at least in part, by the kind of
newspaper it has? Perhaps. And since the ma
jority of New Yorkers disagree with (indeed, if
they have any understanding of) the New York
Times, it follows that the Times should be closed
unless its opinions fall more in line with those
of the great majority, staring vacantly at their
own TV sets.
Or does the clear • thinking letter - writer in
question fear that his ideas will gain no circula
tion outside the narrow confines of his own circle
unless contrary views are suppressed?
