When Maestro Enrique Jorda lowered his baton on the last note
of last week's concert, the audience knew that they had just heard
an evening ol' magnificent music, unequaled in this area for many
years.
The third and fourth movements of Franz Schubert's Tragic Sym
phony were sensational, and under Jorda's dynamic conducting the
string section soared as it it had wings.
Nan Merriman gave an excellent step-in performance, and re
ceived a large ovation when she swept onto the stage gowned in
crimson velvet.
Merriman's aria from Cosi Fan Tutti, the tragi-comic opera in
which Mozart exposes the fickleness of women, was a perfect ve
hicle for her supple, liquid voice. Its gay melodies and complicated
form are typical of Mozart's vocal music which is known for its
property of separating the men from the boys—music-wise, that is.
Manuel de Falla wrote El Amor Brujo for a Spanish ballerina
who also sang, as was the custom. Last week's performance was
this suite's first playing in San Francisco. It is known chiefly as the
ballet containing the Ritual Fire Dance, and is performed only too
seldom in its entirety. It. has a haunting beauty which is inde
scribable and was so well played that it was a surprise no one
jumped on his seat after the ending's triumphant blaze and shouted,
"Play it again."
Alexis Chabricr's suite "Espaha" is played with one of the fullest
orchestras in music annals. Its closely interwoven melodies reflect
the character of Spanish folk songs and make use of an amazing
variety of instruments. The lilting themes of "Espana" ended last
week's program with a great flourish.
Tonight's concert will feature Rudolf Serkin, pianist, as guest
ariist. Serkin last played with the Symphony in February 1956, to
a capacity audience. He is renowned for the power and precision of
his technique and the brilliance of his interpretation. The Now
York llerald-Tr ibune has called him "the greatest living pianist."
First on the program tonight is Mozart's "Notturno in 1) Major
for Four Orchestras" which is written for four orchestras, each com
posed of 2 violins, a viola, bass and two horns. This notturno is
unique because tho tetra-orchestra form gives it a triple echo effect.
Mozart's music of this notturno type was often written to be per
formed at open air concerts, which accounts for the prominent place
given to wind instruments and the martial flavor of several of its
themes.
San Francisco's premier of Wallingford Riegger's Symphony No.
3 will bring us one of the more inspiring in today's "modern sym
phony" genre.
Tonight's finale will be provided by Serkin's performance with
the orchestra in Brahms Concerto No. 1 in D Minor. Brahms restored
the spacious, lofty design of Hie classical masters and combined it
with romantic texture of his concerto. His solo portions are made
prodigiously difficult because of the intrinsic nature of the music,
and Serkin will be made to sweat although he will be given no op
portunities for stunt flying.
The D Minor concerto was Brahm's first major symphonic work
and underwent several transformations before it was first played
in Hanover, January, 1859, where it met with great hissing, a diffi
cult start for Brahms, who was not yet 26.
instrumental requiem, one of Brahm's most hushed and reverent

considerably influenced by the attempted suicide of his good friend,
Robert Schumann. The initial theme bears a family resemblence
to Schumann's opening in his Violin Concerto, and the adagio is an

When Maestro Enrique Jorda lowered his baton on the last note
of last week's concert, the audience knew that they had just heard
an evening ol' magnificent music, unequaled in this area for many
years.
The third and fourth movements of Franz Schubert's Tragic Sym
phony were sensational, and under Jorda's dynamic conducting the
string section soared as it it had wings.
Nan Merriman gave an excellent step-in performance, and re
ceived a large ovation when she swept onto the stage gowned in
crimson velvet.
Merriman's aria from Cosi Fan Tutti, the tragi-comic opera in
which Mozart exposes the fickleness of women, was a perfect ve
hicle for her supple, liquid voice. Its gay melodies and complicated
form are typical of Mozart's vocal music which is known for its
property of separating the men from the boys—music-wise, that is.
Manuel de Falla wrote El Amor Brujo for a Spanish ballerina
who also sang, as was the custom. Last week's performance was
this suite's first playing in San Francisco. It is known chiefly as the
ballet containing the Ritual Fire Dance, and is performed only too
seldom in its entirety. It. has a haunting beauty which is inde
scribable and was so well played that it was a surprise no one
jumped on his seat after the ending's triumphant blaze and shouted,
"Play it again."
Alexis Chabricr's suite "Espaha" is played with one of the fullest
orchestras in music annals. Its closely interwoven melodies reflect
the character of Spanish folk songs and make use of an amazing
variety of instruments. The lilting themes of "Espana" ended last
week's program with a great flourish.
Tonight's concert will feature Rudolf Serkin, pianist, as guest
ariist. Serkin last played with the Symphony in February 1956, to
a capacity audience. He is renowned for the power and precision of
his technique and the brilliance of his interpretation. The Now
York llerald-Tr ibune has called him "the greatest living pianist."
First on the program tonight is Mozart's "Notturno in 1) Major
for Four Orchestras" which is written for four orchestras, each com
posed of 2 violins, a viola, bass and two horns. This notturno is
unique because tho tetra-orchestra form gives it a triple echo effect.
Mozart's music of this notturno type was often written to be per
formed at open air concerts, which accounts for the prominent place
given to wind instruments and the martial flavor of several of its
themes.
San Francisco's premier of Wallingford Riegger's Symphony No.
3 will bring us one of the more inspiring in today's "modern sym
phony" genre.
Tonight's finale will be provided by Serkin's performance with
the orchestra in Brahms Concerto No. 1 in D Minor. Brahms restored
the spacious, lofty design of Hie classical masters and combined it
with romantic texture of his concerto. His solo portions are made
prodigiously difficult because of the intrinsic nature of the music,
and Serkin will be made to sweat although he will be given no op
portunities for stunt flying.
The D Minor concerto was Brahm's first major symphonic work
