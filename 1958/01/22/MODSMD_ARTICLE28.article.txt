Maybe Longer than Five
It seems everybody has said all they have to say about Jack
Curtice for a while, but not having been in on the initial round of
comments I'm going to keep the subject open for at least another
day.
It is a eomforlable feeling to have Curtice on as head coach. Time
after time it's been noted lhat he plays and likes the kind of ball we
like; he thinks the kind of football-minded thoughts we also like to
think. While his contract may only read for five years, barring his
personal desire to leave the scene at that time, I feel that Curtice
and Stanford are beginning an association that will last a good deal
longer.
A MAX OF GOOD COPY—l've never heard of a sports writer
who couldn't turn out plenty of copy after talking to Curtice. He's
a man known as a philosopher and humorist as well as a coach.
Don't mean to insinuate that he's a joker, but he has pulled off
seme corkers since contact with the local press and himself began.
A couple of these memorables transpired between Curtice and
Daily Sports Editor Dirk Barnes. Informed after the trustees' an
nouncement of his hiring that Stanford seemed to be happy to have
him aboard Curtice quipped, "I only hope you'll be happy a year from
now."
In commenting on having made the decision to come here the
night before the announcement was made, he added, "I could have
withdrawn anytime before noon (Thursday)." And then ho went on,
"But, as Alexander said when he came to the Rubicon, 'The die is
cast.' So you see, you're getting a historian as well as a football
coach."
Curtice's planned meeting with the student body should be a
memorable occasion for all concerned. It's my personal wish that
because he is very concerned with doing the best he can for Stanford,
as many of us thai can should show up for lhat talk.
And while we're on this Curtice pilch let's explore a little more
Someone speculated lhat maybe the "Cactus" would go now lhat Jack
is at Stanford. "It'll always be 'Cactus'," lie said in Salt Lake City
last week. Good for you, 1 like it.
But, for those who would have it changed, or modified, these
proposals:
1 Moved the BAC, lock, stock and shoulder pads down the road
a piece into the Cactus Gardens where all will be ok again.
2 With his consent we could always change it to Eucalyptus .lack
to keep ii in local setting. Or Redwood .lack, Sequoia Jack. . . .
3 And maybe I his is the best alternative to Cactus: Farmer John
('urt ice?
MOST INANE COMMENT: There certainly has been a lot said
about the Utalian moving west, but the least appropriate of them
all was voiced by a fair Indian maiden: "He doesn't even look like a
football coach." And what do football coaches look like?
Roo I y-Too ty-Too t-Too I
TWO WHO BLEW —Couldn't help but chuckle over reading that
the Band got hopelessly cought in the mud in trying to make it to
ihe Cal game m Berkeley last Friday night. Felt sorry for them as
they really did want 1o get into competition with the straw-hat affair
across the bay, but mud has spoiled many a good intention.
Things looked bleak up in Men's Gym with an entire section being
held empty for the boys while only two of them showed up. But
these two had the courage to carry out their assignment and play
for the Stanford pompon girls, and even made the entire Berkeley
band wait for them while they did. By names they were Dave Korten
and Curt Russell.
ONE SUBJECT LEADS TO ANOTHER—That whole band de
serves some mention fop the job they've done at basketball games
this year. More is in the offing, I understand, in the way of variety.
We may not win from opponents on the court, but we pretty well
manage to beat 'em in the music department. And this is a pretty
tough statement to make when you consider that only San Jose State
has brought a band to the Pavilion, and the Indian musicians were
on vacation at the time.
LOTS OF EXCITEMENT — One of the two communications
groups that work after dark on this campus was up in arms the other
night after the OSC game, pestered by out-of-town and -state calls
asking for the score. Guess the national gambling syndicates don't
rest on Monday nights as long as there's a chance to make money.
What a lot of fuss over a fairly common occurrence. Wonder how
much money changed hands from the game? I'll bet on Stanford
for tremendously exciting games, at times, but not always as a
winner.
LOXG TIME, XO SCORE—Bet it would he a good psychology ex
periment to test the amount of frustration a team experiences when
it just can't seem to score no matter how many shots they take. And
this year's frosh squad would have proved a good subject during
the tussle with Cal frosh last Friday night. The Papooses took 20
shots at the hoop during one point in the game and couldn't make a
point. Success came on the 21st;.

But, for those who would have it changed, or modified, these
proposals:
1 Moved the BAC, lock, stock and shoulder pads down the road
a piece into the Cactus Gardens where all will be ok again.
2 With his consent we could always change it to Eucalyptus .lack

MOST INANE COMMENT: There certainly has been a lot said
about the Utalian moving west, but the least appropriate of them
all was voiced by a fair Indian maiden: "He doesn't even look like a

TWO WHO BLEW —Couldn't help but chuckle over reading that
the Band got hopelessly cought in the mud in trying to make it to
ihe Cal game m Berkeley last Friday night. Felt sorry for them as
they really did want 1o get into competition with the straw-hat affair
across the bay, but mud has spoiled many a good intention.
Things looked bleak up in Men's Gym with an entire section being
held empty for the boys while only two of them showed up. But
these two had the courage to carry out their assignment and play
for the Stanford pompon girls, and even made the entire Berkeley
band wait for them while they did. By names they were Dave Korten
and Curt Russell.
ONE SUBJECT LEADS TO ANOTHER—That whole band de
serves some mention fop the job they've done at basketball games
this year. More is in the offing, I understand, in the way of variety.
We may not win from opponents on the court, but we pretty well
manage to beat 'em in the music department. And this is a pretty
tough statement to make when you consider that only San Jose State
has brought a band to the Pavilion, and the Indian musicians were
on vacation at the time.
LOTS OF EXCITEMENT — One of the two communications
groups that work after dark on this campus was up in arms the other
night after the OSC game, pestered by out-of-town and -state calls
asking for the score. Guess the national gambling syndicates don't
rest on Monday nights as long as there's a chance to make money.
What a lot of fuss over a fairly common occurrence. Wonder how
much money changed hands from the game? I'll bet on Stanford
for tremendously exciting games, at times, but not always as a
winner.
LOXG TIME, XO SCORE—Bet it would he a good psychology ex
periment to test the amount of frustration a team experiences when
it just can't seem to score no matter how many shots they take. And
this year's frosh squad would have proved a good subject during
the tussle with Cal frosh last Friday night. The Papooses took 20
shots at the hoop during one point in the game and couldn't make a
point. Success came on the 21st;.
Maybe Longer than Five
It seems everybody has said all they have to say about Jack
Curtice for a while, but not having been in on the initial round of
comments I'm going to keep the subject open for at least another
day.
It is a eomforlable feeling to have Curtice on as head coach. Time
after time it's been noted lhat he plays and likes the kind of ball we
like; he thinks the kind of football-minded thoughts we also like to
think. While his contract may only read for five years, barring his
personal desire to leave the scene at that time, I feel that Curtice
and Stanford are beginning an association that will last a good deal
longer.
A MAX OF GOOD COPY—l've never heard of a sports writer
who couldn't turn out plenty of copy after talking to Curtice. He's
a man known as a philosopher and humorist as well as a coach.
Don't mean to insinuate that he's a joker, but he has pulled off
seme corkers since contact with the local press and himself began.
A couple of these memorables transpired between Curtice and
Daily Sports Editor Dirk Barnes. Informed after the trustees' an
nouncement of his hiring that Stanford seemed to be happy to have
him aboard Curtice quipped, "I only hope you'll be happy a year from
now."
In commenting on having made the decision to come here the
night before the announcement was made, he added, "I could have
withdrawn anytime before noon (Thursday)." And then ho went on,
"But, as Alexander said when he came to the Rubicon, 'The die is
cast.' So you see, you're getting a historian as well as a football
coach."
Curtice's planned meeting with the student body should be a
memorable occasion for all concerned. It's my personal wish that
because he is very concerned with doing the best he can for Stanford,
as many of us thai can should show up for lhat talk.
And while we're on this Curtice pilch let's explore a little more

asking for the score. Guess the national gambling syndicates don't
rest on Monday nights as long as there's a chance to make money.
What a lot of fuss over a fairly common occurrence. Wonder how
much money changed hands from the game? I'll bet on Stanford
for tremendously exciting games, at times, but not always as a
winner.
LOXG TIME, XO SCORE—Bet it would he a good psychology ex
periment to test the amount of frustration a team experiences when
it just can't seem to score no matter how many shots they take. And
this year's frosh squad would have proved a good subject during
the tussle with Cal frosh last Friday night. The Papooses took 20
shots at the hoop during one point in the game and couldn't make a
point. Success came on the 21st;.
Maybe Longer than Five
It seems everybody has said all they have to say about Jack
Curtice for a while, but not having been in on the initial round of
comments I'm going to keep the subject open for at least another
day.
It is a eomforlable feeling to have Curtice on as head coach. Time
after time it's been noted lhat he plays and likes the kind of ball we
like; he thinks the kind of football-minded thoughts we also like to
think. While his contract may only read for five years, barring his
personal desire to leave the scene at that time, I feel that Curtice
and Stanford are beginning an association that will last a good deal
longer.
A MAX OF GOOD COPY—l've never heard of a sports writer
who couldn't turn out plenty of copy after talking to Curtice. He's
a man known as a philosopher and humorist as well as a coach.
Don't mean to insinuate that he's a joker, but he has pulled off
seme corkers since contact with the local press and himself began.
A couple of these memorables transpired between Curtice and
Daily Sports Editor Dirk Barnes. Informed after the trustees' an
nouncement of his hiring that Stanford seemed to be happy to have
him aboard Curtice quipped, "I only hope you'll be happy a year from
now."
In commenting on having made the decision to come here the
night before the announcement was made, he added, "I could have
withdrawn anytime before noon (Thursday)." And then ho went on,
"But, as Alexander said when he came to the Rubicon, 'The die is
cast.' So you see, you're getting a historian as well as a football
coach."
Curtice's planned meeting with the student body should be a
memorable occasion for all concerned. It's my personal wish that
because he is very concerned with doing the best he can for Stanford,
as many of us thai can should show up for lhat talk.
And while we're on this Curtice pilch let's explore a little more
Someone speculated lhat maybe the "Cactus" would go now lhat Jack
is at Stanford. "It'll always be 'Cactus'," lie said in Salt Lake City
last week. Good for you, 1 like it.
But, for those who would have it changed, or modified, these
proposals:
1 Moved the BAC, lock, stock and shoulder pads down the road
a piece into the Cactus Gardens where all will be ok again.
2 With his consent we could always change it to Eucalyptus .lack
to keep ii in local setting. Or Redwood .lack, Sequoia Jack. . . .
3 And maybe I his is the best alternative to Cactus: Farmer John
('urt ice?
MOST INANE COMMENT: There certainly has been a lot said
about the Utalian moving west, but the least appropriate of them
all was voiced by a fair Indian maiden: "He doesn't even look like a
football coach." And what do football coaches look like?

TWO WHO BLEW —Couldn't help but chuckle over reading that
the Band got hopelessly cought in the mud in trying to make it to
ihe Cal game m Berkeley last Friday night. Felt sorry for them as
they really did want 1o get into competition with the straw-hat affair
across the bay, but mud has spoiled many a good intention.
Things looked bleak up in Men's Gym with an entire section being
held empty for the boys while only two of them showed up. But
these two had the courage to carry out their assignment and play
for the Stanford pompon girls, and even made the entire Berkeley
band wait for them while they did. By names they were Dave Korten
and Curt Russell.
ONE SUBJECT LEADS TO ANOTHER—That whole band de
serves some mention fop the job they've done at basketball games
this year. More is in the offing, I understand, in the way of variety.
We may not win from opponents on the court, but we pretty well
manage to beat 'em in the music department. And this is a pretty
tough statement to make when you consider that only San Jose State
has brought a band to the Pavilion, and the Indian musicians were
on vacation at the time.
