# Card Capers Take Break
## Semester Tests Leave Stanford With No Games 
### 
S t a 111' o r (1 basketball players
won't bo taking any final exams
this week, but they won't be play
ing any ball, either. A lull in the
Cards' schedule, brought about
by semester finals at other
schools in the PCC, leaves the
Indians with no encounters until
Jan. 31, when they begin a three
game swing through the North
west.
As a result of the break, Coach
Howie Dallmar has decided to
give his troupe a few days off.
They've been told to just forget
about basketball until Friday or
Monday, when they'll down
to brass tacks in anticipation of
games with Washington, Oregon
State and Oregon.
Dallmar said yesterday that he
expects to stick with the altera
tion in the stalling line-up which
was introduced against Oregon
State--John Stabler opening at
guard.

At the start of the season,
Stabler was expected to play pr i
marily for the junior varsity, lie
wasn't even called out for camera
day in December.
Stabler got into action against
Washington and Washington
State, allhough he didn't dent the
scoring column. Hut his big
chance came in the California
game Friday.
lie didn't start, but came in
during the first half when the In
dians switched to a zone defense.
It was St aider's job to harass the
man with ihe ball, and he did
just that. Cal finally solved the
zone problem and began to hit
from the outside, but Stabler had
put himself on the first five.
D a 1 1 m a r kept him there
against the Beavers, and Stabler
turned in a good enough per
formance that he'll probably be
on the floor a week from Friday
when the Stanl'ords journey to
Edmuhdson Pavilion.

Dallmar said yesterday that in
some respects he'd like to give
his club a strenuous series of
workouts this week, but that it
might do more harm than good.
When the Indians get back into
action, they'll be embarking on
the final 10-game phase of the
season. Although the Cards have
slipped into the PCC cellar with
a 1-5 record, they'll have plenty
of opportunity to improve on that
mark since all 10 encounters are
conference affairs.
Following next weekend's
three-game road trip, the Tribe
will return to Stanford for five
of their final seven games. They
will host USC, California, Idaho,
UCLA and Oregon.
The only other road battles will
be in Long Beach, against the
Bruins and Trojans.
