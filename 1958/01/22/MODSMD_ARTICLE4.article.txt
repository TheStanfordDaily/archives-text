# 4 Honor Code Violators Admit Mistake; Receive 'Fâ€™ in Course
## 
### 
Four students, who admitted
"panicking" on a test and resort
ing to a group effort to pass it,
were sentenced to an "F" in the
course after they voluntarily
turned themselves in to their pro
fessor.
The professor turned the case
over to Judicial Council which ac
ceptcd their guilty pleas and gave
them a suspended suspension for
winter quarter.
Should any of the defendants:
be convicted of a Fundamental
Standard or Honor Code violation
during the quarter, he would im
mediately be suspended from the
University, the Council said.
The Council considered the vio
lation of working as a group to
complete Ihc test serious enough
to warrant suspension.
However, because the students

had realized the seriousness of
their mistake almost immediately
after committing it, and had co
operated with Council, the suspen
sion was suspended.
Chairman Gordon Tinker, in ex
plaining the reasoning behind the
verdict, said, "Suspensions are
given when the Council feels the
individual involved has not
learned the seriousness of cheat
ing and needs to get away from
the campus community for a pe
riod to consider his mistake.
"When an individual shows the
Council, as did these four stu
dents, that he has realized his mis
take, and would not consider re
peating it, then the Council feels
this individual is an asset to the
campus community and suspen
sion therefore is not in order."
