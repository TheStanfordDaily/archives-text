# No Need to Travel to Bank; Donate Blood by Mobile Unit
## 
### Mike Seal 
The Peninsula Blood Bank, lo
cated at 1791 El Camino in San
Mateo, is the main blood donating
center for the Bay Area.
A non-profit organization, it
serves Palo Alto Hospital, Se
quoia Hospital in Redwood City,
and Communty and Mills' Hos
pitals in San Mateo.
It is mainly used by former
patients who wish to replace the
blood they have received while in !
these hospitals, thereby receiving
credit for it. The bank gives j
former patients up to six months j
to replace this blood. However.!
replacement is not mandatory.
Donating blood at Peninsula j
Blood Bank is not limited only to J
patients who have received trans- j
fusions at the above hospitals.
Anyone may give, but no money j
is paid for blood. The bank, which
use to pay $25 a pint, gave up this
practise three years ago.
To help former patients and
other prospective donors who find
it inconvenient to travel to the
bank, the blood bank also sends
out mobile units several times a
month.

up in the near future, and inter
ested people can find these units
from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Friday at
Menlo Park Recreation Center
and at these same times v < on

Tuesday at Saint Mark's Church,
600 Colorado St., in Palo Alto.
For other dates when the mo
bile units will be sent out, their
locations, and also for further in
formal inn interested persons can
call either the bank or the local
hospitals. The number of the bank
is OX 7-4034.
Blood donors must be at least
18 years old.
