# Stanford Wins First Big Game, But Loses Axe for Thirty Years
## 
### Camille Petersen 
More color of the campus life
was present in the Frenchman,
Paulin Caperon, better known as
Peter Coutts. Many fables about
this man were spread and came
down through the years. (His
true history was printed in the
Daily last year, Jan. 18, 1957).
The senior plate, in front of
Memorial Church, was the idea of
the class of '96, much to the re
gret of the Pioneer Class who
failed to think of it. The first
plate was laid by the originating
class and in due time earlier
classes added their plates. Rec
ords and mementoes of the class
are buried under the respective
plates.
Ninety-six was quite the year
for new ideas. In the fall, Will
Irvin produced the slogan "Give
'em the axe." Little did he know
that this idea would become such
a part of the University—and
bring undying fame to "the im
mortal 21."
The axe itself appeared in tho
spring of 1899; was stolen; and
finally retrieved in 1930. In this
year it was made the trophy to
be held by the winner of the
annual Big Game.
The first football game be
tween Stanford and California
was held on March 2, 1892. Stan
ford won 14 to 10. Of the first
seven games, Stanford managed
a 4-win, 3-tie record. The follow
ing is one of the typical songs
California composed to spur on
its team to victory:
"The funny, funny, funny,
tunny, funny, Stanford craze,
That dazzled many people with
its bin financial blaze;
If they will come to Ilaight
Street, Thanksgiving ninety
four,
We will show them that the
glitter of that glamour is no
more."
It didn't help California a bit.
Other early organizations on
campus were a band and orches
tra and several vocal groups.
Dramatic clubs such as Ram's
Head, Sword and Sandals, Skulls
and Snakes, and the Masquers
also appeared before 1900.
No organization quite beat the
campus newspaper into exist
ence though . . . the first issue
appeared the opening day in 1891.
It was first called the "Palo Alto"
then "The Sequoia," "Daily Palo
Alto," and finally simply "The

Daily."
The "Quad'' was started in 1893
by the Pioneer Class wilh the
"Chaparral" following in 1899.
The "Alumnus." the forerunner of
the "Stanford Review," also was
published for the first time in
1899.
Some traditions started early
in the University's history, others

| didn't appear for some time.
Many things were informal, done
differently than on other camp
uses.
One of these different things
was commencement. Until 190(5
there was no academic dress
worn. After this time more and
more color appeared on Com
mencement Day.

Ninety-six was quite the year
for new ideas. In the fall, Will
Irvin produced the slogan "Give
'em the axe." Little did he know
that this idea would become such
a part of the University—and
bring undying fame to "the im
mortal 21."
The axe itself appeared in tho
spring of 1899; was stolen; and
finally retrieved in 1930. In this
year it was made the trophy to
be held by the winner of the
annual Big Game.
The first football game be
tween Stanford and California
was held on March 2, 1892. Stan
ford won 14 to 10. Of the first
seven games, Stanford managed
a 4-win, 3-tie record. The follow
ing is one of the typical songs
California composed to spur on
its team to victory:
"The funny, funny, funny,
tunny, funny, Stanford craze,
That dazzled many people with
its bin financial blaze;
If they will come to Ilaight
Street, Thanksgiving ninety
four,
We will show them that the
glitter of that glamour is no
more."
It didn't help California a bit.
Other early organizations on
campus were a band and orches
tra and several vocal groups.
Dramatic clubs such as Ram's
Head, Sword and Sandals, Skulls
and Snakes, and the Masquers
also appeared before 1900.
No organization quite beat the
campus newspaper into exist
ence though . . . the first issue
appeared the opening day in 1891.
It was first called the "Palo Alto"
then "The Sequoia," "Daily Palo
Alto," and finally simply "The

Daily."
The "Quad'' was started in 1893
by the Pioneer Class wilh the
"Chaparral" following in 1899.
The "Alumnus." the forerunner of
the "Stanford Review," also was
published for the first time in
1899.
Some traditions started early
in the University's history, others

| didn't appear for some time.
Many things were informal, done
differently than on other camp
uses.
One of these different things
was commencement. Until 190(5
there was no academic dress
worn. After this time more and
more color appeared on Com
mencement Day.

More color of the campus life
was present in the Frenchman,
Paulin Caperon, better known as
Peter Coutts. Many fables about
this man were spread and came
down through the years. (His
true history was printed in the
Daily last year, Jan. 18, 1957).
The senior plate, in front of
Memorial Church, was the idea of
the class of '96, much to the re
gret of the Pioneer Class who
failed to think of it. The first
plate was laid by the originating
class and in due time earlier
classes added their plates. Rec
ords and mementoes of the class
are buried under the respective
plates.
