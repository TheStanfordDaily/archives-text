# TUESDAY SERIES
## Era's Feelings Expressed by Popular Music 
### Barbara Hicks 
American music reflects the
feelings of the age, Hughson F.
Mooney, instructor in history,
demonstrated to the Tuesday
Evening Series audience last night
in Memorial Auditorium.
Mooney traced the character
istics of songs from 1890 to 1957;
from "Silver Threads Among the
Gold" to "Rock-a-Billy."
The speaker, with the aid of se
lections from his collection of
popular records, called current
hits "Billy Graham and Grandma
Moses set to music."
Warm in its naivete, exuberant,
folksy, simple and direct Mooney
said today's music is a result of
re intensified love of country and
is disinclined to change, reflect
ing what some have termed the
"year of the cautious young man."
In contrast to this, the music
of the early 20th century revealed
the restlessness of the people and
a tendency toward intellectual and
artistic revolt. The most popular
dance titles of the period were
influenced by Darwin's discussion
of animals, with such names as
the "Baboon Baby Glide."
Mooney delved into his collec
tion for a recording by Nick Lu
cas, the original crooner of the
'20's. Bing Crosby and his imita
tors exemplified the "era of the
common man" in the later 1930'5.
The speaker played a Will Os
borne recording of "The Last
Round-up" as typical of the feel
ings of the early 30's, the depres
sion days. Grace Hayes singing
"My Lover" was an example of
the frustration of women who had
plunged into the business world
during the 20's.
