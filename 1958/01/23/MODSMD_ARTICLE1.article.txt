# Lockheed Laboratories Test 'Hot-Shot' Tunnel
## 
### 
The Lockheed Palo Alto devel
opment laboratories on Hanover
Street in the Stanford Industrial
Park are the scene of the devel
opment of the fastest and hottest
wind tunnel in use in private in
dustry.
The tunnel generates speeds
up to 1."5,000 mph and tempera
lures (if 18,000 degrees Fahren
heit.

The so-called "hot-shot" tunnel
will be used to speed up develop
ment of the Navy's ballistic mis
sile, Polaris, according to Dr.
Louis N. Ridenour, research spe
cialist on the project.
The tunnel, two feet in diame
ter and 14 feet long, will be ready
to test Polaris nose cones by
early spring, Ridenour said.
The tremendous heat and force
of the blast air against the nose
cone will be similar to that en
countered in a hypersonic flight
through the earth's atmosphere,
he explained.
A holt of 20 million kilowatts
of electricity will fire a small
chamber of highly compressed
air at one end of the tunnel, heat
ing it instantly to 18,000 degrees.
This is 6.000 degrees hotter than
the surface of the sun.
The superheated air will ex
plode through a diaphragm and
hit the test missile at the other
end of the tube, the blast taking
only one thousandth of a second.
The firing time will be limited

jto 1/251h of a second to prevent
i the tunnel from melting, Dr. Ri
denour said. During that infini
j tesimal instant, however, the
: power that triggers the "hot
shot" is about 1,000 times the
peak power demand of a city the
size of Palo Alto.
High-speed electronic cameras
will photograph the experiment
i through windows in the tunnel.
