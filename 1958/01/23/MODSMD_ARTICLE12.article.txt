## Missiles Are Discussed At Caucus 
### Jack Clumeck 
An enlightening discussion of
tactical guided missiles, and in
particular the surface-to-air Nike,
was held yesterday by the Repub
lican Caucus of the Political Un
ion.
Led by Lieutenant Philip E.
Ramsey, Army ROTC graduate
from Kansas State and informa
tion officer for Bay Area N'ike
installations, the meeting served
to familiarize the members with
the history, past and present, of
the missile.
Lieutenant Ramsey traced mis
sile history from the pioneer Chi
nese "firesticks" through the
German missile research and de
velopment prior to and during
World War 11, and brought his
report up to date with facts about
the U.S. Army's missile develop
ment program and the use of
missiles in the field today.
Nike Deadly
The Army officer emphasized
the significance and importance
of the Nike anti-aircraft missile,
which "can track and destroy any
aircraft in existence in the world
today." The Nike, Lieutenant
Ramsey hastened to add, is ca
pable of destroying any airplane,
even those still "on drawing
boards."
The lieutenant then outlined
the procedure for detection, iden
tification and destruction of en
emy aircraft approaching the Pa
cific coast of the United States.
A "bogie" is spotted on the radar
screen of an off-shore picket ship
or specially designed radar air
craft. The information is then
sent to the Aircraft and Warning
Center on the top of Mt. Tamal
pais in Marin County, where the
location and direction is dissemi
nated.
Scramble
If the unknown aircraft is
scheduled to appear in the area
at this time, the procedure ends
here. But if for some reason it
has not been anticipated, a
"scramble" is sent to an airbase
where fighter interceptors are
sent to visually identify the bo
gie. Upon identifying the un
known plane as friendly, the proc
ess will end.
But if the plane turns out to
be hostile, the jet interceptors
will attempt to shoot it (or them)
down. If the attacking planets)
gets through the fighters, the
surface -to - air Nikes come into
play. Their ground radar "locks
on" the target, and a missile is
sent up at supersonic speeds
(classified) and is guided to the
enemy aircraft by another radar
set coupled to a computer.
Area Safe
The Nike is almost 100 per cent
efficient, and thus the planes
stand little chance of depositing
their bomb load on the Bay Area
or any other Nike-protected area.
The lieutenant added that the
San Francisco area is ringed by
11 Nike installations, extending
"from San Rafael to Newark."
In other business, the caucus
elected Tom Kranz as chairman
and Mike Williamson as vice
chairman.

or specially designed radar air
craft. The information is then
sent to the Aircraft and Warning
Center on the top of Mt. Tamal
pais in Marin County, where the
location and direction is dissemi
nated.
Scramble
If the unknown aircraft is
scheduled to appear in the area
at this time, the procedure ends
here. But if for some reason it
has not been anticipated, a
"scramble" is sent to an airbase
where fighter interceptors are
sent to visually identify the bo
gie. Upon identifying the un
known plane as friendly, the proc
ess will end.
But if the plane turns out to
be hostile, the jet interceptors
will attempt to shoot it (or them)
down. If the attacking planets)
gets through the fighters, the
surface -to - air Nikes come into
play. Their ground radar "locks
on" the target, and a missile is
sent up at supersonic speeds
(classified) and is guided to the
enemy aircraft by another radar
set coupled to a computer.
Area Safe
The Nike is almost 100 per cent
efficient, and thus the planes
stand little chance of depositing
their bomb load on the Bay Area
or any other Nike-protected area.
The lieutenant added that the
San Francisco area is ringed by
11 Nike installations, extending
"from San Rafael to Newark."
In other business, the caucus
elected Tom Kranz as chairman
and Mike Williamson as vice
chairman.
An enlightening discussion of
tactical guided missiles, and in
particular the surface-to-air Nike,
was held yesterday by the Repub
lican Caucus of the Political Un
ion.
Led by Lieutenant Philip E.
Ramsey, Army ROTC graduate
from Kansas State and informa
tion officer for Bay Area N'ike
installations, the meeting served
to familiarize the members with
the history, past and present, of
the missile.
Lieutenant Ramsey traced mis
sile history from the pioneer Chi
nese "firesticks" through the
German missile research and de
velopment prior to and during
World War 11, and brought his
report up to date with facts about
the U.S. Army's missile develop
ment program and the use of
missiles in the field today.
Nike Deadly
The Army officer emphasized
the significance and importance
of the Nike anti-aircraft missile,
which "can track and destroy any
aircraft in existence in the world
today." The Nike, Lieutenant
Ramsey hastened to add, is ca
pable of destroying any airplane,
even those still "on drawing
boards."
The lieutenant then outlined
the procedure for detection, iden
tification and destruction of en
emy aircraft approaching the Pa
cific coast of the United States.
A "bogie" is spotted on the radar
screen of an off-shore picket ship
or specially designed radar air
craft. The information is then
sent to the Aircraft and Warning
Center on the top of Mt. Tamal
pais in Marin County, where the
location and direction is dissemi
nated.
