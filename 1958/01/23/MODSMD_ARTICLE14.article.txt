with their plan formulated, they
returned to California where
Stanford prepared the Endow
ment Act, passed by Ihc Califor
nia Legislature to protect endow
ments granted to institutions.
The act allows for people wish
ing to promote public welfare by
founding, endowing and having
maintained, in California institu
tions of learning or intellectual
pursuits, to designate exactly
how their endowment is to be
spent, and to delegate authority
to trustees to supervise in the ex
ecuting of the endowment.
This act was passed by the Leg
islature on March 9. 188.">, and in
November of that same year
Senator Stanford and his col
leagues had drawn up a founding
grant for the Lcland Stanford
Junior University.
The nature, object and pur
poses of the institution were es
tablished as follows:
Its nature, that of a University
with such seminaries of learning
as shall make it of the highest
grade, including mechanical insti
tutes, museums, galleries of art.
laboratories and conservatories,
together with all things necess
ary for the study of agriculture
in all its branches, and for me

chanical training, and the stud
ies and exercises directed to the
cultivation and enlargement of
the mind.
Its object, to qualify students
for personal success and direct
usefulness in life.
While first revealing plans for
the University, Senator Stanford
said, "I design that the amplest
provision shall he made for all
the branches of what is known as
a liberal education, and every fa
cility given for the prosecution
of all professional studies.
"But the astronomer can't ex
plore the heavens without bread
and butter, and it is my hope that
the university may afford to both
sexes an opportunity for techni
cal education which will enable
every student to earn a living
and something more than a liv
ing.
"The machine shops are to be
used as educators, not money
makers. Every useful art is to
be taught: the arts of making
shoes and clothes, of printing,
carving, telegraphy, stenography, j
no less but rather more than the
arts of music, and painting and
sculpture, for which every ad
vantage that money can buy will
be given.

November of that same year
Senator Stanford and his col
leagues had drawn up a founding
grant for the Lcland Stanford
Junior University.
The nature, object and pur

be taught: the arts of making
shoes and clothes, of printing,
carving, telegraphy, stenography, j

vantage that money can buy will
be given.
