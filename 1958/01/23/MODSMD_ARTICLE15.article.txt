# Congress Request Denied to View 2 Defense Reports
## Ike Tells Committee to Draw Own Conclusions From Facts 
### 
WASHINGTON (/Pi President Eisenhower refused yesterday Id
give Congress a look at two secret reports on the national defense 1
situation. He said a Congressional committee lias access to the same
information and implied they could draw their own conclusions
from it.
A Senate Preparedness Subcommittee headed by Senator Johnson

(D.-Tex.) has been trying for
several weeks to get reports by
Dr. James li. Killian, the Presi
dent's scientific adviser, and the
Gaither committee.
Both are said to be sharply crit
ical of the present defense effort.
There have been published stories
that the Gaither report, drawn up
by a Presidential panel appointed
last spring, portrays the United
States as facing the gravest dan
ger in its history.
But James C. Hagerty, White
House press secretary, has said
the report does not depict this
country in a position of military
weakness "at this time."
Eisenhower wrote Johnson yes
terday,"I have concluded that I
cannot properly furnish these
reports to the Congress or release
them for publication."
The President told Johnson,
the Senate's Democratic leader,
that "Throughout our history,
the President has withheld infor
mation whenever he found that
what was sought was confiden
tial or that its disclosure would
jeopardize the nation's safety or
the proper functioning of our
government."
"Only by preserving the confi
dential nature of such advice,"
the President said, "is it possible
to assemble such groups or for
the President to avail himself of
such advice."
He told Johnson the informa
tion given Killian and the Gai
ther committee "is essentially the
same information which has been
and is available to Congressional
committees studying the same
problems."
"On the basis of these facts,"
the President wrote, "the panels
drew their own conclusions and
made recommendations which I
have been weighing along with
recommendations of other advis
ers within and without the gov
ernment."
