## 
### 
LUMBERTON, N.C. </P) — The
Rev. James Cole, Carolinas Ku
Klux Klan leader, took the first
step today in what appeared to be
a fight against facing North Caro
lina charges of inciting a riot.
The South Carolina preacher
posted $1000 bond at his home
town of Marion, S.C. It appeared
that an extradition hearing would
be necessary to get him back here
for trial on charges stemming
from Saturday night's battle be
tween Klansmen and Lumbee In
dians near Maxton.
A Klan rally headed by Cole
broke up before it started, and
gathering Klansmen were dis
persed by Indian gunfire.
The Indians said they broke up
the rally because it was being held
as a warning against race mixing
and after two cross-burnings on
Indian property the same week.
Meanwhile, a second Klansman
drew a suspended 60-day sentence
and a $60 fine at Maxton before 1
an Indian judge for carrying a
concealed weapon and for public
drunkenness.
Assistant Recorders Court
Judge Lacy Manor quietly lectur
ed James G. Martin of Reidsville,
N.C., as he gave him a 60-day sus
pended sentence and fined him $60
and court costs.
Martin—along with the South
Carolina preacher, Cole still
faces a charge of inciting to a
riot in connection with the Max
ton rally.
At Marion, the 33-year-old Free
Will Baptist preacher posted $1000
bond in fighting extradition to
North Carolina to face trial.
