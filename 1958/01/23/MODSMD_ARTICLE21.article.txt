# Ku Klux Klan Humiliated
## 
### 
To \ nation' so accustomed lo hearing reports
of terrorizing by members (if the Ku Klux
Man, the recent week-end report* from Rohe
>ii County, Morili Carolina, are indeed re
freshing.
It seems that Klansmen near Maxton, N.C.,
i ill** at I of terrorizing others, became terrorized
themselves while trying to hold a night rally.
Led by lh»- Rev. James Cole, a Free W ill
Kaptist preacher, the Klaiisinen of the area had
lil Iwo burning crosses —not to frighten Ne
groes, hut to frighten Indiana of the American
variety instead, lhere are 30.000 Indians in
Robeson County.
One of the crosses was lit in front of the
home of an Indian woman who was dating a
"white" man. The other was in front of the
home of an Indian family who had "moved
into a white neighborhood.Needless to say,
the Indians did not hike this sitting down.
Hearing of a prospective Klan rally in the
neighborhood, the Indians determined to put
a stop to the nonsense going on in Robeson
County. Hundreds of them, fully armed with
shotguns, rifles and pistols, waited near the
field where the rallv Was going to be held.
Tin •ir numbers increased as they waited. Then
the hooded men arrived, set up their loud
speaker system and prepared lo commence
tlx Mr rally.
The Indians then moved into the area, de
manding the Kev. Cole. When there was no
response from the Klansmen, the Indiana shot
out the lights and proceeded lo rip the night
with blasts from their guns. After nearly one

half hour of ibis, county sheriff's men arrived
on the scene, dispersing the crowds with tear
gas. The Klansmen were protectively herded
away from ibe area.
Later the Indians hung the Kev. Cole in
effigy in front of the police station in nearby
Pembroke, seat of the Indian conununih.
The interesting aspect about ibis whole af
fair is that the Klansmen are being charged
with "inciting to riot." The only thing done
to the Indians was the confiscation of their
arms.
The Kev. Cole fled to his home in South
Carolina, citing abuses by the sheriff against
the First and the Fourteenth amendments. He
charged that the Klansmen's constitutional
rights had been violated.
These are interesting charges from a man
who has helped so much lo violate Ihe rights
of minorities in the South. Now that the tables
were turned on him, he immediately runs to
the Constitution for aid.
We are disposed lo give the Indians of Kobe
son County, N.C., a vote of confidence and a
hearty applaud for their efforts to handle these
bigots in the only efficacious manner.
The sheriff of I fiat county, Malcolm MeClcod,
should also be congratulated for charging the
Klansmen instead of the Indians. The whole
situation is humorous from beginning to end,
but we suspect very much that Klansmen will
think twice before using their terrorist methods
against American Indians.
Three cheers for the American Indians of
Robeson County, North Carolina!
