"Aged Considerably"
Editor, The Daily:
In your Monday issue there appeared a letter
which saddened me greatly. As 1 read it, a lump
came to my throat and I was deeply touched. In
all humility 1 wish to extend to Mr. Vincent E.
Whelan my most humble apology for offending
his sensitive Democratic soul. Over the weekend
1 have "aged" considerably and can now share
Mr. Whelan's implied belief that Pat Brown's
character is not "dubious" —it is most certainly
nondescript. Such revelation comes with the in
sight of political maturity.
I hope your wrists were appropriately slapped
too, Dear Editor, for allowing a heathen Republi
can to speak his heresy through your pages.
Oh, well, you can't win t.hern all.
Thank you for the spanking, Papa Whelan.
Jack Rolls
Editor's Note: Obviously, the aging* process
you used over the weekend was intended for
alcoholic beverages, not for living creatures.
There is little as distasteful to a discerning
person as chemically treated, rapidly aged
wine.
19ers at Stanford?
Editor, The Daily:
Why not let the San Francisco 49ers play some
of their games next season in the Stanford Sta
dium?

Hashers' Day
Editor, The Daily:
Unheralded, stands one set of individuals on
our campus, toiling away in the morning, toiling
away in the middle of the day, and toiling away
in the evening, helping in the long chain that
produces the lifeblood of our existence here at
Stanford, namely, food.
He is none other lhan the Branner hasher. This
person can be seen slaving away throughout the
whole autumn quarter, the whole winter quarter
and even the whole spring quarter, striving in
the struggle to bring the Branner woman what
she wants, what she needs and what she craves,
namely, food served with the good breeding and
efficiency that only the Branner hasher knows
how to do.
Individual hashers may come, and individual
hashers may go, but the faces of these people are
really always the same, and the head held high,
and the bearing proud, remains eternally un
changed. Yes, from early in the morning, when
he or she first stumbles to the food counter in
order to grab a morsel of food before going on
duty, until that evening, when the dinner dishes
have finally been cleared, and he has finally
hung up his white jacket on the name-tagged
coat-hanger he knows so well, and she has put
away her yellow apron, the Branner hasher
stands as the symbol of service.
It is indeed but a little diesappointing to find
that the hasher is not accorded all the respect
and honor that he deserves. 1 therefore think
that, not only should the general attitude bo
changed radically, but we should set apart a spe
cial day to honor the hasher, and the Branner
hasher in particular, who constitutes the roy
alty in hashing. Thursday, January 23, that, is
to say, today, seems to me in every respect to
be the perfect day for such a tribute, and I think
that today we should, all of us, give an im
promptu raising of the hat to the hasher, as well
as doing anything else that we can to help the
hasher. I know that I am representing the intel
leetual and emotional temper of this University
when 1 set apart this day for such a tribute.
This proposal has been humbly and thought
fully submitted.

Incredible Naivete
Editor, The Daily:
The popularization of "Nikita" or, as better
known by those millions around him, "The
Butcher of Ukraine," was almost supported by

Mr. Schorr's sentimental tales on Khrushchev's
visit to Lenin's home.
When the other fellow, "Dolfi," visited Napo
leon's tomb in the Dome des Invalides in Paris,
1940, the similarly sentimental stories and pic
tures on the meeting of those "semi-gods" did
not affect that way the American public because
the conquering of six defenseless nations threat
ened the rest of the world. Will we start con
sidering "Nikita" as a new and more dangerous
conqueror before experiencing a new and terrible
Pearl Harbor?
If Mr. Schorr was supposed to orientate the
States concerning the Soviets, and if he was con
sidered as a successful one—there is no more
question on the reason of the ineffectiveness of
the U.S. foreign policy. Restated: The satellites
are liabilities for the Soviets since the Hungarian
revolution. This naivete is almost incredible, e.g.,
the Hungarian heavy industry, the bauxite and
the uranium mines are producing their goods al
most completely, and in the case of the uranium
ore, exactly [onlyJ for the Soviets. The quanti
ties are not negligible even in world-wide as
pects. The Soviets would send crops and cotton
in exchange.
The standard of living in Hungary—accord
ing to the newest—is about one-third or one
fourth of that of before World War II.
The difference is the Soviet "support."

On Unilateral Disarmament
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial "Unilateral Disarmament" is un
fortunately not so penetrating an explanation of
Professor Sibley's views as one could wish.
The politics of pacifism go to the root of the
matter by seeking to eradicate the causes of war
(instead of developing means to bring aggres
sion to a speedy end). There are two major
causes of war, namely, personal egoism and cov
etousness, plus the desire to achieve a tangible
(usually economic) objective. Since America pur
portedly has waged war without malevolent j
leaders, to eliminate the possibility of reaching!
an objective is more fundamental to abolishing j
war. Accordingly, there are three ways to make |
these objectives unobtainable: first, by destroy-i
ing economically desirable capital before it "is
taken by an enemy; secondly, by proscribing ar
maments; thirdly, by educating skilled personnel
to be nonviolently unco-operative to invaders.
Professor Sibley proposes the latter two tech
niques; current American policy threatens the
l'irst via "massive retaliation." Yet if capital
punishment does not deter crime, will massive
retaliation deter war?
In the editorial are several omissions of fact.
Not all Hungarian revolutionists fought nonvio
lently; this is why Budapest was damaged. What
objective would be gained by Russia's razing "de
fenseless" American cities? Presumably, there
could be none, so the hypothetical situation is
nonsense. In modern world war, "victory" is not
obtainable; ;i 11 participants commit suicide. Non
violent resistance does not leave men "defense
less." More modern examples of nonviolent re
sistance can be cited than that of the mythical
|?| Delaware Indians. The list of successes of
the last 15 years is impressive: Norway, India,
Tibet, Birmingham, Alabama; and now, South
Africa and Colombia.
Those who cannot imagine the psychological
effect of unilateral disarmament upon the Rus
sians and their subject peoples are urged to pic
ture what would happen if Russia disarmed uni
laterally. America would be demoralized.
There is one difficulty in Professor Sibley's
logic. His elitism lends itself to a difficult situ
ation: What if Sovietists executed the elite,!
while masses were propagandized by lucrative |
incentives in the U.S.? The result would be that
nonviolent resistance conspirators would vanish, j
In sum, most of us are plagued with inconsist
encies in any attitude toward war. Apathy to
ward this problem is the current "solution" al
Stanford. Professor Sibley is to be commended
for provoking thought.
