# ASIAN EDUCATION SEEDS
## Courses Should Give Cultural, Practical Knowledge: Dr. Rao 
### Rita Robison 
"Democratization of education
does not mean that everyone is
entitled to a bad education," stated
Dr. Baskara Rao at the "Y" Po
litical Affairs Luncheon Tuesday.
The subject of Dr. Rao's infor
mal talk was "What Kind of Edu
cation Is Most Vital to the Asian
People?"
Discretion in selection of edu
cational framework must lie exer
cised, continued the noted Indian
educator, for "education has to be
an implementation of people's
ideas."
The average Asian student has
been responsible for the independ
ence of his country, and with the
success of this revolution comes
added desire for better living con
ditions, a more highly industrial
ized society, wider range of op
portunities- and what Dr. Rao re

fers lo as a "revolution of human
expectation."
Asian education must first
make students realize their own
culture and background, giving
them a personal identity and sense;
of loyalties, allegiances and un
derstanding.
This, explained Dr. Rao, will
load to a bridge of culture be
tween the educated and the un
educated within each country and
then within nations, on an inter
national basis.
"Homespun philosophy" and
"folksy knowledge" were two ex
pressions Dr. Rao used to explain
the intellectual attitude in tho
more remote villages of India.
Throughout Asia, adult education
classes are being conducted as
well as pro-college and college-'
level instruction.
Gandhi instituted the "basic ed
ucation" system in Indian villages, :
which is fundamentally a craft or i
trade school education.
"Basic education is probably ;i
very important solution to eduea-j
tional adjustment that India and
other Asian countries have to
make at this lime," suggested the
doet or.
The so c i a I welfare state is I
emerging as t he most popular in I
the Asian countries, he continued. I
and combines government plan
ning and the nationalistic concept

which is called the "People's
Plan."
New engineers, technicians and
scientists are needed for this, and
many Asian students endeavor to
&o abroad lo study. But, added
Dr. Rao, they should ask them
selves it the education they will
receive abroad will be suitable and
adaptable to the work they'll want
to do when they return to their
native areas.
Over- and under-specialization
are equally disturbing problems
arising from studies abroad, Dr.
Rao claimed.
The prevailing "spirit of sacri
fice," that of taking less than they
want in educational programs for
the time being, has resulted in the
present Asian programs of prac
tical education, "with roots in tJie
cultural and spiritual background
of each country."
