; ancj a special summer program i
j for Western and Midwestern high
school malhemalies teachers is
! being offered by Stanford.
| The announcement was made
today jointly hy the University
and the General Electric Com-j
pany, which is providing a grant
j from its Educational and Chari- I
I table Fund.
The second annual program
j will offer three graduate - level
courses, specially designed for
high school teachers by the Uni
| versity's Mathematics Depart-j
j ment, and a series of talks by GE |
| personnel on the company's use i
i of mathematics in research, en-'
gineering and manufacturing.
New this year is a course titled
| "Mathematical Methods in Sci
ence." This will show the rela
| tionship of high school mathe
i matics to physical problems and
'how it is applied to their solu
tion.
"A principal objective of the
program," said Paul W. Berg, as-!
sistant professor of mathematics!
and program director, "is to aid j
the GE fellows in stimulating
their students' interest in mathe
matics. We feel that last year's
program was particularly suc
cessful in this respect."
All expenses, including trans
portation to and from the Uni
versity, tuition, room and board,
are covered.
