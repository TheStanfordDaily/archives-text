# Humanities Series Will Be Televised
## 
### 
John W. Dodds, professor of
English and director of special
programs in the humanities, will
begin a new series of readings on
KQED, the Bay Area's educational
TV station, tomorrow at 9:30 p.m.
Dodds, who recently concluded
a series called "The Measure of
Man," will entitle his new series
"Meant for Reading." Each tele
cast will attempt to blend phi
losophy and literature around a
central theme, such as love, war,
freedom, or morality.
Tomorrow night's program will
center around a discussion of free
dom. Dodds' commentary will
draw from the works of John Mil
ton and Stephen Vincent Benet,
interspersed with a few sonnets
to illustrate his meanings. "Meant
for Reading" will be seen "live"
on KQED and will be filmed for
later distribution on a national
seale.
The professor, a specialist on
the Victorian era of literature, has
been at Stanford since 1937. He
holds a doctorate in literature
from Yale and has written biog
raphies of Thomas Soul heme and
William Thackeray and critical
st udics.
