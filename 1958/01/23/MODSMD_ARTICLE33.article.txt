# NCAA Won't Allow These Things
## 
### 

Coxing one of the Stanford crew's shells is soph
omore Euana Gougli. Just one catch, though—
NCAA rules specify male coxswains. The oars
men are really sorry about this turn of events,
hut it's resulted in their having to put out a call
for more coxswains, and a few managers, too.
Both the l'rosh ami varsity need coxes, and the
varsity needs managers. Coxes should weigh no
more than 135 poundsi They not only guide and
steer the shells, but also help tht oarsmen im
prove their rowing ability. Managers draw the

pleasant task of driving coach Lou Lindsey's
motor launch, arid also help maintain crew
equipment. Experience is not a prerequisite for
either coxes or managers. Those interested
should report t<» the crew boat house in Redwood
City llarhor (on Harbor Boulevard just off Bay
shore Freeway) between 4 and 6 p.m. any Mon
day through Friday, or call Handy Jones al
Toyon 24!). Full grade-point or activity credit is
given to all crew personnel.
