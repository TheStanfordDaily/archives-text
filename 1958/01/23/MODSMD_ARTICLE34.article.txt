# Douglas Key Man in Optimistic Outlook for Stanford Netmen
## 
### John Schwarz 
With the entire team back from
i last year, all the prospects for
| this year's Stanford varsity ten
-1 nis team appear to be highly op
timistic. Leading the returning
lettermen is Jackie Douglas, first
man on last year's team and a
member of the NCAA All-Ameri
j can squad.
Douglas, a fine competitor and
1 hard worker, is the likely pros
pect to be first man again this
; year. Coach Bob Renker feels
I that Douglas is much further
j along now than he was at this
! time last season.
With the opening match a
i month away, Douglas is the only
man who seems to have assured
! himself of his position. Brooks
Rawlins, second man last year, is
a strong candidate for that posi
i lion again this year, but Rawlins
| has been stricken with a case of
mononucleosis and will be out for
| a short while.
Dave Nelson and Gil White, let
termen from last year's squad,
are almost certain to be anions

the top six. Just where each of j
these two will he placed depends i
on the outcome of intra-squad I
matches being played off.
Up from last year's freshman i
team are Jim Jeffries and Robin
Hilgeman. Both these men have
looked very impressive in pre- i
season drills, and either one has j
a strong chance of climbing to !
one of the top spots.
Rounding out the list of topi
contenders is Lowell Carruth, I
who with a season of varsity!
competition behind him appears j
to be a greatly improved player.'
