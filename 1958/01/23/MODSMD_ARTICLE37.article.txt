â€”Jim Myers of lowa State was
named head football coach and
athletic director of Texas A&M

turnabout.

said that Myers' salary will be
$15,000 a year plus a rent - free
house under a four-year contract
effective Jan. 23.
Undoubtedly responsible for
helping Myers make up his mind

newspaper, the Battalion. He
masterminded an 80 - foot tele
gram carrying 2229 signatures
which was sent to Myers.
Myers is a single-wing football
