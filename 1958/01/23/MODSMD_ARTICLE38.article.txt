(This is the final installment of tlio> complete text of Mrs. Stan
ford's Will.)
XXV
Of the large estate committed to the hands of my husband and
myself I have made what I consider the widest and most just dispo
sition, and the disposition most in accordance with the cherished
wishes long entertained by my husband and myself, and I shall
greatly deplore any attempt to disturb it; and if any devisee or legatee
under the above-written will, or any person who, if I died intestate,
would be entitled to any part of my estate, should either directly
or indirectly attempt to oppose or set aside the probate of this will,
or to impair, invalidate or set aside its provisions, or to set aside
01 avoid, or to have declared void, null or ineffectual any transfer
or grant made or attempted to be made by my husband or myself to
said trustees of said university, then and in that case I give and
bequeath to such person or persons the sum of one hundred ($100)
dollars, and no more, in lieu of any other share or interest under the
will or 1 in my estate; and I expressly declare and provide that to
take any part directly or indirectly in such an attempt shall be held
and conclusively deemed to be an election by the person or persons
doing so to take the said one hundred ($100) dollars, and no more,

in lieu of all interest in my estate, and all the rest of the interest
that would otherwise have gone to such person or persons by devise
or inheritance shall pass under the residuary clause of the said will.
XXVI
I hereby revoke all former wills by me at any time made.
XXVII
I wish thus publicly to acknowledge my great gratitude to an all
wise, loving Heavenly Father for His sustaining grace through the
past ten years of bereavement, trial and disappointments. In all I
have leaned hard on this Great Comforter and found rest and peace.
I have no doubt about a future life beyond this: a fair land where
no more tears will be shed and no more partings had.
To this, my last will and testament, I have on this 28th day of
July, A.D. 1903, in the city and county of San Francisco, State of
California, set my hand and seal in triplicate.
JANE LATHROP STANFORD.
