# Men's Council Places Three On Probation
## 
### 
Three Stanford students who
were arrested in Palo Alto one
week ago last Tuesday night
while collecting traffic signs were
placed on probation until June
and sentenced to 20 hours of work
each in the Corporation Yard by
Men's Council recently.
The students originally set out
to steal a garbage can for their
apartment. After taking one from
a Menlo Park school, they decided
to collect several traffic signs be
cause, as one student testified,
"we didn't feel much like study
ing."
After removing one sign from
a rather "easy" location, the stu
dents continued taking other signs
because they were "looking for
more excitement than we were
getting," and"it was a big lark
at the time."
No! Drinking
The students testified they had
not been drinking, and the police
report did not mention any liquor.
The students apparently were
not planning to keep the signs as
a display, as they testified that
they "didn't know what we were
going to do with them."
The students we r e arrested
while trying to chop down a sign
near the corner of Embarcadero
and Bayshore, with a California
Highway Patrol car 100 yards
away < not nearby, as reported in
Thursday's Daily). In order to
i escape detection, one of the de
fendants let out the other two de
fendants near the sign. While they
were preparing to chop it down,
an officer approached and asked
them what they were doing. The
defendants dropped their hatchet
and told the officer they were
"just horsing around," but he had
seen the hatchet. By the time the
third student drove back in his
car, all had been confessed.
Serious Actions
The three students testified that
they did not realize the serious
ness of their actions at the time,
until the Palo Alto police told
them that if anyone had been kill
ed at an intersection where they
had removed a stop sign, they
would have been prosecuted for
manslaughter. One student testi
fied that their actions were "not
immoral, but quite imprudent."
In addition to the Council pen
alties, the students have paid $30
to replace signs in Menlo Park
and will have to also pay the city
of Palo Alto for some new signs.

After removing one sign from
a rather "easy" location, the stu
dents continued taking other signs
because they were "looking for
more excitement than we were
getting," and"it was a big lark
at the time."
No! Drinking
The students testified they had
not been drinking, and the police
report did not mention any liquor.
The students apparently were
not planning to keep the signs as
a display, as they testified that
they "didn't know what we were
going to do with them."
The students we r e arrested
while trying to chop down a sign
near the corner of Embarcadero
and Bayshore, with a California
Highway Patrol car 100 yards
away < not nearby, as reported in
Thursday's Daily). In order to
i escape detection, one of the de
fendants let out the other two de
fendants near the sign. While they
were preparing to chop it down,
an officer approached and asked
them what they were doing. The
defendants dropped their hatchet
and told the officer they were
"just horsing around," but he had
seen the hatchet. By the time the
third student drove back in his
car, all had been confessed.
Serious Actions
The three students testified that
they did not realize the serious
ness of their actions at the time,
until the Palo Alto police told
them that if anyone had been kill
ed at an intersection where they
had removed a stop sign, they
would have been prosecuted for
manslaughter. One student testi
fied that their actions were "not
immoral, but quite imprudent."
In addition to the Council pen
alties, the students have paid $30
to replace signs in Menlo Park
and will have to also pay the city
of Palo Alto for some new signs.
Three Stanford students who
were arrested in Palo Alto one
week ago last Tuesday night
while collecting traffic signs were
placed on probation until June
and sentenced to 20 hours of work
each in the Corporation Yard by
Men's Council recently.
The students originally set out
to steal a garbage can for their
apartment. After taking one from
a Menlo Park school, they decided
to collect several traffic signs be
cause, as one student testified,
"we didn't feel much like study
ing."
