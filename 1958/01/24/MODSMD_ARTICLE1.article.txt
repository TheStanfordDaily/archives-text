# ST&T Talk at Stillman House
## Sterling Discusses Expenses: No Profit, No Loss Operation 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Increases in tuition and board and room topped the numerous sub
jects discussed by University President Wallace Sterling who last
night spoke at Stillman House as part of the 1958 Stanford Today
and Tomorrow series.
Sterling explained the reasons for tuition increase, such as improv-

ing faculty salaries and the rising
cost of living, and then went on
to explain how the University op
erates its "no profit —no loss"
room and board policy.
When residences are built, they
are theoretically to last 50 years.
Were the University to invest the
money spent for the buildings on
securities, it would collect a cer
tain amount of interest. By build
ing with it. no interest is obtained.
However, running on a five-year
plan, the University charges
enough to profit the first two
years, enough to break even I lie
third, and loses the fourth. Thus,
the no profit—no loss.
"There is a move in progress
among the 'Ivy League' schools to
charge tuition equal to the cost of
a student's education," said Ster
ling. At this time, even with the
tuition increase, a Stanford stu
dent pays only one-half the full
price of his education. The Uni
versity is fighting the new pro
posal of the Eastern colleges to
any degree that it would force
Stanford to join it..
Next discussed was the "Stan
ford in Stuttgart" program. "This
experiment should indicate how
students would react 1o a similar
program in France, Spain, or It
aly," said Sterling. Currently
these countries fire being investi
gated for facilities which would
make possible two more such
branches of Stanford in Europe.
"Is the mortality rate of full
professors high?" asked one of
the audience, which was composed
of Stillman women and members
of the SAE fraternity. By "mor
tality," he explained he meant loss
of the professor to the University
through bettor offers by industry.
Sterling explained that by the
time men reach the position of
full professors they usually pre
fer to remain with the University.
He added that business is mostly
after the younger men — those
working toward professorships,
j lie commented that in all of his
! 15 years of looking for new fac
j ulty members he has "never
i known it to be so difficult to gel
1 top-flight people" as now.
University plans for fraternity
1 housing arc currently being work
;od out and sites have been se
j looted, according to Sterling. "It
' is hoped that by 1960 two of the
| four-unit houses will be built," he
j added.
To build the 275 living units for
married students, the University
is borrowing $3 million from the
U.S. government. The buildings
will bo one and two stories, of
different sizes and colors. Mason
ry and stucco will predominate on
the first story, while redwood sec
ond stories and shale roofs will
| top them off. "Rent will be ap
| proximately between $75 and $90,"
' concluded Sterling.
