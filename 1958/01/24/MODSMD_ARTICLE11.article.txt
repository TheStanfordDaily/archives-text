"Stanford girls arc very nice," a distinguished British woman
anthropologist who specializes in African education said yesterday.
Dr. Margaret Read has been spending the last four days at Stan
ford giving lectures and attending seminars in her first West Coast
appearance.
Wednesday, she spoke on "Education and Cultural Traditions in
\frica," and yesterday afternoon she talked about "Child Training
n African Societies." She was guest of honor at a reception given
after the Thursday lecture.
Dr. Read holds the title of Commander of the British Empire, an
honor which is seldom obtained by women.
She plans to stay at Stanford until Sunday, when she will leave
for UCLA to spend a week and then go to the University of Cali
fornia in Berkeley for four days.
"My first visit to California has been wonderful," she said, "espe-

daily since it began at Stanford.
The invitation to come here
was extended by Professor Felix
Keesing of the Anthropology De
partment, an old friend, after she
wrote offering her services. She
intends to visit with Professor
George Spindler, also of the An
thropology Department, and
Dean Philip Rhinelander, a cous
in of some friends of hers.
She is officially appearing un
der the auspices of the School of
Education, the Intercultural Edu
cation Society, and the Anthro
pology Club.
The Stanford School of Anthro
pology is highly thought of in an
thropological circles, she said,
this reputation being due in great
part to the fine work Professor
Kppsinr" has done. She also men-

tioned that a symposium on anthropology was held at Stanford three
years ago and was attended by many experts.
The Stanford campus impressed her very much. '"It is really
marvelous." She has been living in Florence Moore Hall and having
a wonderful time, she said.
This newspaper even received a few rare praises. "I have been
reading The Stanford Daily every day since I arrived, and I have
particularly enjoyed the articles about Mrs. Stanford's will," Dr.
Read commented.
