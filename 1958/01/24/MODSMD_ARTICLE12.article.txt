# Harvard Prof Relates Ideas On Revolution
## 
### 
Crane Brinton, professor of
history at Harvard University,
yesterday afternoon in the Wom
en's Clubhouse revealed his after
thoughts on his book "The Anat
omy of Revolution" to members
of the sponsoring Phi Alpha
Theta.
Having graduated from Har
vard and Oxford and having be
come a Rhodes scholar, Brinton
tried to find a pattern in revolu
tions, and uses the American,
FZnglish, French and Russian rev
olutions as the basis of his study.
Prosperity
.Running through most of his
new ideas on the subject of revo
lution is his firm belief that all
revolutions occur in societies
where economies are on an "up
swing," and where the people are
not suffering physically.
Since this is present in all his
studies of revolutions, and since
it is unlikely that people will re
volt unless they have the energy
for it, revolution will not occur
unless the society is increasing
economically.
1917 Ended
This theory is the main basis
for Brinton's firm belief that the
Russian revolution is over. "The
spark is gone out of Russia," and
her former revolutionists can
now be compared to the Daugh
ters of the American Revolution
who follow ritual but have no in
tention of actually revolting.
Although Brinton did not in
tend to attack economic aid to
foreign countries, he did warn
the people to use caution in giv
ing aid, because - it could lead to
revolution. Further reason for
this in the idea that "you can't
buy off people who hate us be
cause we arc prosperous" backed
up t lie statement.
Courage Needed
Wishing he had stressed in his
hook a second idea, that it takes
a certain kind of moral courage
lo revolt, Brinton had a chance to
go into it in more detail. People
of a country must feel that what
they flo is legitimate and be sure
that their morals are right.
A more subtle symptom which
Brinton thought to be necessarily
present in revolution was the de
sertion of the intellectuals, the
freethinkers, from the govern
ment. Its subtlety comes from
difficulty in determining what is
normal and what is free thought.

Courage Needed
Wishing he had stressed in his
hook a second idea, that it takes
a certain kind of moral courage
lo revolt, Brinton had a chance to
go into it in more detail. People
of a country must feel that what
they flo is legitimate and be sure
that their morals are right.
A more subtle symptom which
Brinton thought to be necessarily
present in revolution was the de
sertion of the intellectuals, the
freethinkers, from the govern
ment. Its subtlety comes from
difficulty in determining what is
normal and what is free thought.
Crane Brinton, professor of
history at Harvard University,
yesterday afternoon in the Wom
en's Clubhouse revealed his after
thoughts on his book "The Anat
omy of Revolution" to members
of the sponsoring Phi Alpha
Theta.
Having graduated from Har
vard and Oxford and having be
come a Rhodes scholar, Brinton
tried to find a pattern in revolu
tions, and uses the American,
FZnglish, French and Russian rev
olutions as the basis of his study.
Prosperity
.Running through most of his
new ideas on the subject of revo
lution is his firm belief that all
revolutions occur in societies
where economies are on an "up
swing," and where the people are
not suffering physically.
Since this is present in all his
studies of revolutions, and since
it is unlikely that people will re
volt unless they have the energy
for it, revolution will not occur
unless the society is increasing
economically.
1917 Ended
This theory is the main basis
for Brinton's firm belief that the
Russian revolution is over. "The
spark is gone out of Russia," and
her former revolutionists can
now be compared to the Daugh
ters of the American Revolution
who follow ritual but have no in
tention of actually revolting.
Although Brinton did not in
tend to attack economic aid to
foreign countries, he did warn
the people to use caution in giv
ing aid, because - it could lead to
revolution. Further reason for
this in the idea that "you can't
buy off people who hate us be
cause we arc prosperous" backed
up t lie statement.
