Even Stanford cops have
hearts (sometimes).
On Wednesday the '54 Chevy
of a poor Farm student stopped
and refused to budge. The hap
less owner pushed his car into
an alley and left a note on the
windshield explaining his pre
dicament.
Then came the cop. He glanc
ed at the "no parking" signs and
whipped out a little book. The
officer's pencil scratched away.
Bystanders gathered.
The cop gave one more look
at the crowd and the note on
the windshield. Then he became
"our hero" as lie crunched the
ticket into Ins pocket and drove
away.
