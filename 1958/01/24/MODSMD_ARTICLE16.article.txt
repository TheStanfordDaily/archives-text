# LASSU Postpones Resolution on PCC Strife Temporarily
## Vote of Confidence Given Poli Union As Budget Okayed 
### Rich Brown Associate Editor 
In a three-hour session which
produced much smoke but no
fire, ASSU Legislature last night
refused to commit itself to any
resolution concerning the Asso
ciated Students' stand toward the
strife - ridden Pacific Coast Con
ference.
The debate followed an hour
long off-the-record discussion of
the PCC by Rixford K. Snyder,
Stanford's faculty representative
and president of that organiza
tion.
As soon as Snyder left the Law
School Moot Court room, scene
of the meeting, Daily Editor Wal
ly Simpson read a proposed reso
lution. The debate which followed
centered on the theme that Legis
lature members did not at pres
ent have enough information on
Stanford's relation to PCC to
state any definite opinion.
After voting down motions to
pass, then kill and finally to refer
the matter to committee, Legis
lature decided to postpone it tem
porarily until members can ob
tain student opinion in house
meetings Monday night.
Legislature removed any stig
ma placed on Political Union by
okaying a $574 budget and giving
a vote of confidence. Last spring
LASSU had withheld most of
Poli Union's budget for what it
felt was poor administration.
Dormitory social chairmen will
soon have some handbooks, as
Legislature appropriated $250 to
print 1000 copies.
The student governing body
gave its approval to changes' in
by-laws or constitutions of the
following organizations: Insti
tute for Aeronautical Sciences,
Quad, Daily.
Clubs which failed to gain Leg
islature approval of their by-law
amendments or constitutions
were Stanford Anthropological
Society, DeMolay Club, Stanford
Investment Club and Women's
Recreation Association.
Ellen Bernstraueh was ap
proved as Legislature representa
tive from Education School Coun
cil. Guest ASSU foreign scholars
last night were Hemlata Deen
Dayal of India and Birgit Brock-
