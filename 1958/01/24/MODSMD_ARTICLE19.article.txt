# Symbol of Values
## 
### 
This Sunday we commemorate five decades
pins five years of service by Memorial Church
to the Stanford community.
It is indeed fitting that Memorial Church
stands as the center of our campus—as a con
stant reminder that there is a purpose beyond
just day-to-day existence. The fact that our
universe was planned is obvious to all who open
their eyes.
From its beginning in 1903, Memorial Churcli
was intended to be a fundamental part of the
University, an impressive symbol of non-sec
tarian religious unity and of moral and spirit
ual values which enrich education.

Be cause of differences of opinion regarding
the plans and desires of our Creator, public
universities have tended to leave religion up
to churches in the surrounding areas.
But we at Stanford are free to admit the
existence of our Creator, even if we disagree
on llie exact nature of the universe.
Memorial Church survived its worst test in
1906 when the earthquake struck. But—per
haps symbolically—the church arose from its
slate of destruction and stands today stronger
than before. As an added note, we are happy
that our Church is now visible day and night,
with the recent addition of floodlights.
