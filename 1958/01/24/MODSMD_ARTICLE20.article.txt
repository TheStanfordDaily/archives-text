Sound, Thoughtful Summary
Editor, The Daily:
Because of the fact my son. Tim, is a freshman
at Stanford, I have been a subscriber of The
Stanford Daily. I herewith compliment you on
the "right to work" editorial in your Jan. 7, 1958,
issue. We represent a number of corporations
who are consistently being plucked by the pro
moters of this type of legislation. Yours was a
sound, thoughtful summary of the opposition
to this type of legislation and well written to
boot.

Duel at Sunrise
Editor, The Daily:
Please inform Mr. Rolls that I will meet him
in the middle of Quad at sunrise on Tuesday
morning of next week. I am calling on that "non
descript" character, Mr. Edmund (Pat) Brown to
bo my second; so perhaps it will be appropriate
that Mr. Rolls enlist the services of Mr. William
("Formosa Bill") Knowland. One would be hard
pressed, certainly, to think of another public fig
ure who so readily brings to mind the martial
politicians of ancient Rome like Cato and Marius.
Mr. Rolls, as is customary, may have the
choice of weapons, provided, however, he does
rot c'oose the pen. The thought of being clubbed
f o death is less than appealing.

Persnickety Old Busybody
Editor, The Daily:
Mrs. Loomis should receive recognition for her

letter in Wednesday's Daily remarking that the
names of all Honor Code violators be published.
We nominate you, Mrs. Loomis, for Stanford's
Most Persnickety Old Busybody. Of what value
would printing the names be, other than to give
you and your nosy friends something to talk
about over the back fence while you are hanging
up the wash or watering the flowers?

Encyclopedia Salesmen
Editor, The Daily:
During the past few months, some "super
salesmen" representing Encyclopedia Americana
have been working in the area. In their sales
effort, they have contacted several married off
campus Stanford students. Their method of gain
ing entrance into the home is always through a
telephone call. The salesman implies that, in
order to increase his sales volume, he will be
willing to place a set of the encyclopedia in your
home, at no cost to you, if you will help with his
sales program. This is a complete falsehood.
Their whole sales approach is very carefully
thought out and practiced. As a result, many
Stanford students have been "taken in" already.
So that others will not suffer this "how could I
have been so stupid?" feeling, I would like to
give this word of caution. Unless you want to
buy a set of Encyclopedia Americana for from
$300 to $375, don't even bother talking to the
salesman.
