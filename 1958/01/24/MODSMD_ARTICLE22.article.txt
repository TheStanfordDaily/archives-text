(Editor's note: This is (he last
article in a series of two con
cerning the basic provisions of
the Founding Grant.)

Following the statement of the
purpose of the new University,
the founding grant allows for the
number and designation of the
trustees.
Before revealing the grant, Sen.
Leland Stanford gathered togeth
er many of his influential friends.
He then read the grant and asked
them all if they would like to
serve as the 24 trustees mentioned
at great length in it. All present
accepted the invitation and elected
Judge Lorenzo Sawyer as chair
man. H. C. Nash was appointed
secretary pro tem.
The first Board of Trustees was
composed of men representing
many varying occupations. Includ
ed were Charles Goodall, of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Co.; Al
fred L. Tubbs, a St. Helena mer
chant; Charles F. Crocker, vice
president of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Co.; Henry L. Dodge, ex
superintendent of the United
States Mint; and Josiah Stanford,
viticulturist from Warm Springs.
It is within the power of the 24
trustees to manage and control
Stanford and its trust property,
to grant scholarships, to make all
laws deemed necessary by them,
to appoint a University president,
and to employ faculty and affix
the salaries of both faculty and
administrators.
President's Duties
The University president's du
ties are to prescribe the duties of
the professors and teachers, to re
move professors and teachers at
will, to prescribe and enforce the
course of study and the mode and
manner of teaching, and to con
trol the educational part of the
University to the.,extent that he
may justly be responsible for the
course of study.
Within two years from the ac
ceptance of the founding grant,
the trustees were to have planned
the physical layout of the Univer
sity, remembering that "extensive
and expensive buildings do not
make a university; that it depends
for its success rather upon the
character and attainments of its
faculty."
Section X of the grant provides
that scholarships be given to de
serving students and that there
would be "given at the University,
by its ablest professors, courses
of lectures upon the science of
government and upon law, medi
cine, mechanics and other arts and
sciences, which shall be free to the
post-graduates of the Colleges of
the University. . . ."
Unique Obligations
The Stanford founding grant
provided for two unique obliga
tions:
• The grantors, Sen. and Mrs.
Stanford, would be able to alter
the grant during their lifetimes.
They would continually have a say
in maintenance and management.
• Both grantors would be con
sidered trustees, capable of exer
cising the powers of trustees, as
long as they both lived.

After the grant had been no
tarized, Senator Stanford address
ed the trustees and outlined fur
ther plans. He foresaw that "a
handsome income will he derived
from the rental of desirable resi
dences to parents and others who
will choose the place [Palo Alto]
as a residence on account of its
social, intellectual and climatic ad
vantages.
"Of course, the trustees will see
to it that no objectionable people
are allowed to reside upon the
estate, and that no drinking sa
loons shall ever be opened upon
any part of the premises."
Sectarianism Prohibited
Sectarianism was prohibited by
the articles of endowment, but
they directed the teaching of an
all-wise, benevolent God and that
the soul is immortal. It was Sena
tor Stanford's desire that a church
be built, where professors of vari

ous religious denominations would
be able to deliver discourses "not
sectarian in character."
"We deem it of the first impor
tance that the education of both
sexes shall be equally full and
complete, varied only as nature
dictates," said Senator Stanford.
Thus, all rights, political and oth
erwise, are equal to both sexes.
By the deed of trust given by
the Stanfords, 83,200 acres of land
were donated for the University.
At this time both Sen. and Mrs.
Stanford drew up their wills, pro
viding for the carrying out of
plans concerning the University.
When first hearing of the insti
tution, many Americans believed
that "it will be THE educational
center that will obviate the neces
sity which now compels the am
bitious students of this country to
go to Europe to complete their
education."
