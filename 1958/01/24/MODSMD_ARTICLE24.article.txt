# THE 						Finish Line

Just Plain Terrible
If I never see officiating as bad as that of last Monday, it'll still
be too soon. I'm certainly not trying to blame Stanford's loss on the
lousy rolling, because Oregon State did have the superior team. I
can't even accuse the men in stripes of giving just one team a raw
deal, because they blundered and bungled against both clubs.
The only thing consistent about the calls was that they were bad.
Dave (jainbee, in particular, was getting away with murder under
the boards. And he also had a field day camping in the key under
the offensive basket for more than the legitimate three seconds.
There was also plenty of heavy body blocking, particularly in
the mid-court area, which escaped the whistle. Some of it didn't
affect play, so perhaps shouldn't have been called, but there was an
awful lot involving the man with the ball that should have been.
There were also a few peculiar calls on charging. Paul Neumann
was a victim twice, although he was a clear violator on a third occa
sion.
Even the out-of-bounds calls were bad. There was more than one
occasion where the team that hit the ball out got the privilege of
putting it back in play. And to top things off, a Stanford player
who wanted to call "Time Out" had to practically yell in the offi
cial's ear before the clock was stopped.
It really is too bad that these poorly-worked games have to come
along so often, because generally speaking, the PCC refs do an ac
ceptable job.
And now back to Stanford's favorite sports subject of the past
.few weeks, our new football coach, Jack Curtice this time to talk
about his opinions on goal posts. You know: those wooden things

thai conversions sometimes go
through.
Curtice is in his fifili and final
year as a member of the NCAA
football rules committee, so ho
was in on all the talk about mov
ing the college goal posts up to
the goal line, where the pro posts
are. The proposal to imitate the
play - for ■ pay alignment came
from the Ivy league, and was
based on an attempt to put more
of the foot back in football by
making field goals more attrac
tive.
Curtice opposed the sugges
tion, chiefly because of the added
danger situation which is created
by having the post bases within
Iwo yards of the goal line. Can't

say that we don't agree with him on that count, after seeing several
of the pros get racked up by running full-tilt into the heavily-padded
posts.
To help get the field goal up to a popular level in college ranks,
however, Curtice came up with an alternate plan which will be used
in several games on an experimental basis next season.
Basically, the plan involves widening the goal posts to a degree
such that any kick which would be good through pro posts would
also be good through the college variety. To determine the width
of posts on the end zone line, it would be necessary to construct an
isoceles triangle with the bases of pro posts as two corners and the
mid point of the eight-yard line (from where the average PAT is
kicked) as ihe third point. Then by extending the equal sides of
this triangle and finding where they intersect the end zone line, the
base points for Curtice posts would be established.
Well, it sounds complicated, but on paper it's really pretty simple.
There's no question that the idea would boost the percentage of suc
cessful PAT's and field goals, since kicks which are now high enough
but are wide by a small margin would go through the Curtice posts.
If this rule were combined with the new one-or-two PAT rule, the
conversion situation would take on even more of a strategic tone
since the one point would be almost a sure thing.
Personally, I think I'll wait and see how the new PAT rule works
out before making up my mind as to whether or not I want to see
wider goal posts.
Attention, Bob Nicolet
While we're on this PAT kick, there were a few remarks that
came over the AP wire this week concerned with the lost art of drop
kicking. Fritz Crisler, outgoing chairman of the NCAA Football
Rules Committee and the principal exponent of the two-point rule,
thinks the new legislation will help revive the drop-kick. Crisler
says:
"Imaginative coaches who seek to take full advantage of the
rule will return to the almost abandoned drop kick. If would add
to the deception of the PAT play. While the place-kick is faster,
the drop kick would free the ball-holder for blocking and running.
I'm sure a study of the drop-kicking technique would perfect and
speed it up to make it a dangerous play. From a short punt for
mation or the single wing, it would keep the defense guessing."
It's true that the ball has been slenderized for passing since the
days of the great drop-kickers, but Crisler doesn't think that would
be much of a handicap.
Bob—Are you listening?
Texas A&M finally has gotten itself a coach, after 51 days of
making their university the laughing stock of the nation (or at least
battling for the title with Los Angeles civic officials). I'm just glad
that it was the Aggies' coach hunt and not Stanford's that was Ihe
subject of a recent Chronicle headline, "Why Do Coaches Back
Away from Texas Aggie Job?" Just shows to go ya what coopera
tion and efficiency, or lack of them, can or can't do.
