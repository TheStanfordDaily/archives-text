# Tribe Rugby Has Star-Studded Past
## 
### Elbert Liden 
Rugby has played an important part
on the athletic scene at Stanford since
the turn of the century. In fact, rugby
replaced varsity football in the years
1906-1017. Then, with football back on
the fall schedule, rugby was switched to
the winter and spring quarters, where it
remained until it was dropped after the
spring of 1910.
While all the sports writers were going
wild witli superlatives about the perform
ances of the Wow Doys, rugby again
made an important entrance to The
Farm. In fact, the star broken-field run
ner of the Wow Boys was also the star
of the ruggers. The runner—none jother
than the present rugby coach, Pete
Kmetovic.
Coached in 1040
Kmetovic, while still a graduate stu
dent, coached his first rugby leam at
Stanford in 1946. Then he went back to
the pro football wars with the Philadel
phia Eagles, and Chuck Taylor took over
the team from 1017 to 1050. Taylor had

not played the game at Stanford, but
eagerly learned the rules and did a good
job as coach.
Then in 1951 Kmetovic took over the
job of head rugby coach, which he still
holds. Kmetovie's record as coach during
these recent years, along with his playing
record, should earn him the title of Stan
ford's "Mr. Rugby." There have been
many memorable events on the rugby
field since Kmetovic took over the coach
ing reins. He has compiled probably the
best percentage coaching record at
Stanford.
Outstanding Ruggers
Some excellent athletes have graced
the rugby fields. The list would include
such names as Kmetovic, Lathom, Marty
Feldman, Ron Cook, Vince Jones, Gordy
Jones, A 1 Kirkland, Gordy Rice, Jack Bo
net ti, Norm Manougian, Dorsey Atkin
son, Paul Wiggin, Dick Jones, and Jack
Lewis.
Atkinson is probably the best place
kicker and all-around kicker who has
played rugby here, while Cook and Kmet
ovic have been the best runners pro

duce?!. Wiggin, and previous to him Dick
Jones, set a tradition with their ability
to grab the ball on line-outs.
Vince Jones won international fame for
himself by playing rugby at Oxford while
a Rhodes scholar and being the only
American ever to start the Oxford-Cam
bridge game. While at Stanford in 1056,
big 230-pound Vince displayed his versa
tility by switching from break to scrum
half when his services were needed at
that important position. Kirkland's play
remains the model of how the fullback
position should be played.
This Year's Club
This year's team is made up of the fol
lowing players: hookers, Don Peters, Bill
Palmer; front rank, Noel Robinson, Kyrk
Reid, Pete Swanson, John Thomas, Neil
Laughlin; second rank, Eric Protiva, Phil
Toorvald, Phil Rit7.au, Don Watson; lock,
Phil Burkland,. Cap Ingham; breakaway,
Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson, John Clark,
Dick Takaki; scrum half, Dave Scholz,
Ilap Easter; first five, Tom McManus,
Bob Parks; second live, Jim Honeywell,
Fred Prince; center three, Dennis Cut-

Shaw, Bob Paterson; wing, Trcv Grimm,
John Butler, Wayne Frick, A 1 Napoleon;
and fullback, Sid Garber, El Liden.
Reid does the important job of kicking
conversions and penalty kicks, with Liden
backing him up when he is not in the
game. Protiva keeps up the "Jones-Wig
gin" tradition and is the receiver on al
most all the line-outs. Scholz, backed up
by Easter, directs the team from his
quarterback position, called the scrum
half in rugby, and such backs as McMan
us. Honeywell, Cutshaw, Grimm and But
ler keep the attack on the offensive.
Everyone I'un.v
Garber and Liden take care of most of
the punting from the fullback position,
but the whole hackfield and even the
scrum punt.
Yet the heart of this year's team is the
scrum, who, just like the football line
men, do most of the work and get the
least headlines. It is impossible to signal
out a single scrum member, since every
player in the Stanford scrum this year is
very capable and a good tackier with a
lot of hustle.


TRIBE READY—Pete Kmeto
vic (above) will send his Stan
ford Ruggers against the Penin
sula Ramblers tomorrow at 2:.'io
p.m. The Cards beat the liam
iders, 10-3, last week.

Garber and Liden take care of most of
the punting from the fullback position,
but the whole hackfield and even the
scrum punt.
Yet the heart of this year's team is the
scrum, who, just like the football line
men, do most of the work and get the
least headlines. It is impossible to signal
out a single scrum member, since every
player in the Stanford scrum this year is
very capable and a good tackier with a
lot of hustle.

Rugby has played an important part
on the athletic scene at Stanford since
the turn of the century. In fact, rugby
replaced varsity football in the years
1906-1017. Then, with football back on
the fall schedule, rugby was switched to
the winter and spring quarters, where it
remained until it was dropped after the
spring of 1910.
While all the sports writers were going
wild witli superlatives about the perform
ances of the Wow Doys, rugby again
made an important entrance to The
Farm. In fact, the star broken-field run
ner of the Wow Boys was also the star
of the ruggers. The runner—none jother
than the present rugby coach, Pete
Kmetovic.
Coached in 1040
Kmetovic, while still a graduate stu
dent, coached his first rugby leam at
Stanford in 1946. Then he went back to
the pro football wars with the Philadel
phia Eagles, and Chuck Taylor took over
the team from 1017 to 1050. Taylor had

not played the game at Stanford, but
eagerly learned the rules and did a good
job as coach.
Then in 1951 Kmetovic took over the
job of head rugby coach, which he still
holds. Kmetovie's record as coach during
these recent years, along with his playing
record, should earn him the title of Stan
ford's "Mr. Rugby." There have been
many memorable events on the rugby
field since Kmetovic took over the coach
ing reins. He has compiled probably the
best percentage coaching record at
Stanford.
Outstanding Ruggers
Some excellent athletes have graced
the rugby fields. The list would include
such names as Kmetovic, Lathom, Marty
Feldman, Ron Cook, Vince Jones, Gordy
Jones, A 1 Kirkland, Gordy Rice, Jack Bo
net ti, Norm Manougian, Dorsey Atkin
son, Paul Wiggin, Dick Jones, and Jack
Lewis.
Atkinson is probably the best place
kicker and all-around kicker who has
played rugby here, while Cook and Kmet
ovic have been the best runners pro

duce?!. Wiggin, and previous to him Dick
Jones, set a tradition with their ability
to grab the ball on line-outs.
Vince Jones won international fame for
himself by playing rugby at Oxford while
a Rhodes scholar and being the only
American ever to start the Oxford-Cam
bridge game. While at Stanford in 1056,
big 230-pound Vince displayed his versa
tility by switching from break to scrum
half when his services were needed at
that important position. Kirkland's play
remains the model of how the fullback
position should be played.
This Year's Club
This year's team is made up of the fol
lowing players: hookers, Don Peters, Bill
Palmer; front rank, Noel Robinson, Kyrk
Reid, Pete Swanson, John Thomas, Neil
Laughlin; second rank, Eric Protiva, Phil
Toorvald, Phil Rit7.au, Don Watson; lock,
Phil Burkland,. Cap Ingham; breakaway,
Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson, John Clark,
Dick Takaki; scrum half, Dave Scholz,
Ilap Easter; first five, Tom McManus,
Bob Parks; second live, Jim Honeywell,
Fred Prince; center three, Dennis Cut-

Shaw, Bob Paterson; wing, Trcv Grimm,
John Butler, Wayne Frick, A 1 Napoleon;
and fullback, Sid Garber, El Liden.
Reid does the important job of kicking
conversions and penalty kicks, with Liden
backing him up when he is not in the
game. Protiva keeps up the "Jones-Wig
gin" tradition and is the receiver on al
most all the line-outs. Scholz, backed up
by Easter, directs the team from his
quarterback position, called the scrum
half in rugby, and such backs as McMan
us. Honeywell, Cutshaw, Grimm and But

Reid does the important job of kicking
conversions and penalty kicks, with Liden
backing him up when he is not in the
game. Protiva keeps up the "Jones-Wig
gin" tradition and is the receiver on al
most all the line-outs. Scholz, backed up
by Easter, directs the team from his
quarterback position, called the scrum
half in rugby, and such backs as McMan
us. Honeywell, Cutshaw, Grimm and But
ler keep the attack on the offensive.
Everyone I'un.v
Garber and Liden take care of most of
the punting from the fullback position,
but the whole hackfield and even the
scrum punt.
Yet the heart of this year's team is the
scrum, who, just like the football line
men, do most of the work and get the
least headlines. It is impossible to signal
out a single scrum member, since every
player in the Stanford scrum this year is
very capable and a good tackier with a
lot of hustle.


TRIBE READY—Pete Kmeto

Rugby has played an important part
on the athletic scene at Stanford since
the turn of the century. In fact, rugby
replaced varsity football in the years
1906-1017. Then, with football back on
the fall schedule, rugby was switched to
the winter and spring quarters, where it
remained until it was dropped after the
spring of 1910.
While all the sports writers were going
wild witli superlatives about the perform
ances of the Wow Doys, rugby again
made an important entrance to The
Farm. In fact, the star broken-field run
ner of the Wow Boys was also the star
of the ruggers. The runner—none jother
than the present rugby coach, Pete
Kmetovic.
Coached in 1040
Kmetovic, while still a graduate stu
dent, coached his first rugby leam at
Stanford in 1946. Then he went back to
the pro football wars with the Philadel
phia Eagles, and Chuck Taylor took over
the team from 1017 to 1050. Taylor had

not played the game at Stanford, but
eagerly learned the rules and did a good
job as coach.
Then in 1951 Kmetovic took over the
job of head rugby coach, which he still
holds. Kmetovie's record as coach during
these recent years, along with his playing
record, should earn him the title of Stan
ford's "Mr. Rugby." There have been
many memorable events on the rugby
field since Kmetovic took over the coach
ing reins. He has compiled probably the
best percentage coaching record at
Stanford.
Outstanding Ruggers
Some excellent athletes have graced
the rugby fields. The list would include
such names as Kmetovic, Lathom, Marty
Feldman, Ron Cook, Vince Jones, Gordy
Jones, A 1 Kirkland, Gordy Rice, Jack Bo
net ti, Norm Manougian, Dorsey Atkin
son, Paul Wiggin, Dick Jones, and Jack
Lewis.
Atkinson is probably the best place
kicker and all-around kicker who has
played rugby here, while Cook and Kmet
ovic have been the best runners pro

duce?!. Wiggin, and previous to him Dick
Jones, set a tradition with their ability
to grab the ball on line-outs.
Vince Jones won international fame for
himself by playing rugby at Oxford while
a Rhodes scholar and being the only
American ever to start the Oxford-Cam
bridge game. While at Stanford in 1056,
big 230-pound Vince displayed his versa
tility by switching from break to scrum
half when his services were needed at
that important position. Kirkland's play
remains the model of how the fullback
position should be played.
This Year's Club
This year's team is made up of the fol
lowing players: hookers, Don Peters, Bill
Palmer; front rank, Noel Robinson, Kyrk
Reid, Pete Swanson, John Thomas, Neil
Laughlin; second rank, Eric Protiva, Phil
Toorvald, Phil Rit7.au, Don Watson; lock,
