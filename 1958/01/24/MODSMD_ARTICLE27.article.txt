## 
### Jerry Wisot 
Anticipating an active season,
the frosh baseball team began its
winter workouts earlier this
week with general conditioning
exercises. These will be contin
ued for two more weeks, then, on
Feb. 3, Ihey will move out onto
the diamond for actual practice
under the direction of their new
coach Mickey Holzman.
The first game in their Ifi-game
schedule will take place on April
3, during the first week of spring
quarter. Up to that time they
will Work out about three times
per week.
Good Schedule
Under what Holzman terms "a
good schedule," the Papooses will
meet the freshmen from Califor
nia, San Jose State and Santa
Clara twice each, traveling on
three occasions and playing the
other three engagements at
home. Besides these, they will
play 10 high school teams from
this area, including Fresno, Sa
cred Heart, Jefferson and Bellar
mine.
.The majority of their games
will be played on the frosh dia
mond on Wednesdays and Satur
days although they will have the
use of the Sunken Diamond for
four games. Except for three
morning games, the frosh will
play in the afternoon.
Sees Good Season
Holzman stated that although
it is impossible to say at the pres
ent time how the team will turn
out, there is no reason why they
should not have a good season.
He mentioned the names of sev
eral prospects out of the 33 boys
that have turned out: Earl Rus
sell, Bill Jensen, Dave Carter,
Jerry Hicks and Terry Linder
man, pitchers; Lee Moeneh, Eric
Blitz, Dick Peterson and Hal
Schutzman, infielders; John Hurl
but and Bob Garrett's twin broth
ers Jim and John, outfielders;
and John Simmons, catcher.
Graduating himself from Stan
ford last year with a master's de
gree, Holzman coached the JV's
here last year while completing
his schooling. During autumn
quarter he was in the service at
Fort Sam Houston where he
coached football and basketball
and played baseball.
