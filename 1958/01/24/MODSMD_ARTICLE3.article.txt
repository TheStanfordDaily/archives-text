# Angry Mobs Bring Havoc In Venezuela
## Dictator Flees Capital; Military-Civilian Junta Restores Government 
### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (A*) â€”
Dictator Perez Jimenez fell yes
terday and fled into exile. Angry
crowds besieged secret police
headquarters and 60 bodies were
reported found in the building
after a 10-hour fight.
More than 100 persons previ
ously had been reported slain
since a general strike and upris
ing that began Tuesday.
The siege ended at 3 p.m., 10
hours after the crowd had gath
ered on the news that Perez Jime
nez had fled to asylum in the
Dominican Republic.
Perrtn, Too
His friend, ex-dictator Juan D.
Peron of Argentina, was reported
fleeing by car for Colombia to
seek new refuge.
Caracas exploded with a wild
celebration at dawn, as soon as it
became known that P6rez Jime
nez, ruler for 10 years, had gone.
A new five-man military junta
was sworn in but a civilian pa
triotic junta, which had led the
revolt, had some doubts whether
freedom actually had come.
Two Civilians
Late in the day the junta al
tered its all-military character by
announcing the addition of two
civilians, and sought to placate
civilian rebels by declaring its
intention of holding free elec
tions and restoring constitutional
liberties. But it set no dates.
The first act of the ruling junta
was to announce that political
prisoners held on "unjust
charges" had been freed from
Obispo Prison and the modern
Carcel Modelo.
Ten Years
The decade of power of stout
ish, 43-year-old Perez Jimenez
was terminated at midnight when
the military chiefs informed him
he had lost the support of the
armed forces.
Civilian rebels who had pro
claimed a general strike Tuesday
and fought pitched battles in the
streets Wednesday finally won
the support of some of the young
er military leaders.
But the all-military junta that
was sworn in included three who
have stood high in the service of
the ousted president.
The two civilians added later
were Eugenio Mendoza, a leading
industrialist and financier, and
Blaz Lamberti, an engineer and
professor at Central University.
