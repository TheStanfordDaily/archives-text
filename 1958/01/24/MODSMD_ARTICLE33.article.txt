Smart vs. Gambee
The OSC â€¢ Washington series
figures to be a corker, especially

Smart and Gambee are cur

with- 20.4 and 17.0 averages
respectively. Smart is also sec
ond in rebounding, but there he
trails Gambee, the PCC pace-set
ter.

Oregon State, by winning both
games, can pull into a first-place
tie with idle California and UC
LA. Each of the three would
then have 5-1 records,
Idaho, the surprise team of the
loop along with the Bears, can
creep to within a half-game of
the lead if they can whip Oregon.
The Vandals are currently 4-2.
