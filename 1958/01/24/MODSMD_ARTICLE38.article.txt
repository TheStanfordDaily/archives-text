### Marilyn Moore 
This Sunday, Jan. 26, is the
commemoration of the 55th anni
versary of the dedication of the
Stanford Memorial Church.
Commemorating the 55th anni
versary service this Sunday is
the communion service at 9 a.m.
conducted by the Rev. Robert M.
Minto, the church service at 11
a.m. with Dr. Seymour Smith of
Yale University as guest preach
er. and an organ concert at 4 p.m.
by Herbert Nanney, University
organist, assisted by the church
choir.
This church, the first large uni
versity church ever built in the
United States, has always played
a prominent part in the life of
Stanford. The provision for such
a nonsectarian church to be lo
cated at the center of the campus
was set forth in the Founding
Grant by Senator and Mrs. Lc
land Stanford.
As Mrs. Stanford said to Dr.
John Casper Branner, president
emeritus of the University, "And
as the moral and spiritual life is
more important than the life of
our bodies, so moral and spiritual
instruction is more important to
young people than instruction of
any other kind.
"That is why I think the church
should be the heart and center of
this university. I am aware of
the fact that complaint has been
made that the church was put
where the library ought to be.
That view can be defended on
some grounds, I know, for I have
heard it so defended, but on the
highest possible grounds there is
nothing so important to the young
men and young women who come
here as the instruction they
should get from that pulpit. And
that is why I said that while my
heart is in the university my soul
is in the church."
The construction, which began

in 1899. was closely observed by
Mrs. Stanford, for this building
was to be the memorial to her
husband and an expression of her
great devotion to the university.
Dedicated In 1903
Dedication services took place
on Sunday, Jan. 25, 1903, at 11
a.m. and 3 p.m. The Rev. David
Charles Gardner, chaplain, and
several ministers from San Fran
cisco and Oakland took part. Said
Dr. Gardner, "To these principles
and to this work we solemnly
dedicate, we consecrate, we set
apart this Memorial Church. It
has been built in love. Not to
teach a theological system, not to
develop a sort, but to minister to
the higher life of the university.
I believe you will learn to esteem
it very highly in love for its
work's sake."
A special issue of the univer
sity newspaper, The Daily Palo
Alto, was published that day in
honor of the "building that today
is dedicated to the glory of God
and the uses of religion." The
paper featured photographs of
the church and described in de
tail the architecture, the builders,
the notable educators present at
the dedication, the organ and the
stained-glass windows.
Damaged by Earthquake
Heavily damaged by the earth
quake in April, 1906, the church
was restored without the great
tower and reopened in October,
1913.
The Fiftieth Anniversary Serv
ice was celebrated in 1953, and
the order of worship included the
same anthems and scripture les
sons as the original dedication
services. A special concert of sa
cred music was given in the af
ternoon.
