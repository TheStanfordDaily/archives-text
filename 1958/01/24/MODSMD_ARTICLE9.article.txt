# Dodds Initiates Reading Series Tonight on TV
## 
### 
Tonight at 9:30, John D.
Dodds, professor of English and
director of special programs in
the humanities, begins his new
series of readings on KQED, the
Bay Area's educational TV sta
tion, Channel 9.
The profesor, who recently con
cluded a series called "The Meas
ure of Man," has entitled his new
series "Meant for Reading." Each
telecast will attempt to blend phi
losophy and literature around
some central theme, such as war,
love, freedom or morality.
Tonight's initial program will
focus on a discussion of freedom.
Dodds' commentary will draw
from the works of John Milton
and Stephen Vincent Bcnet, inter
spersed with a few sonnets to
illustrate his meanings. "Meant
for Reading" will bo seen "live"
on KQED and will be filmed for
later distribution on a national
scale.
The professor's program is one
of a growing number of educa
tional programs appearing now
throughout the country. This is
the first of two Stanford pro
grams this weekend. The com
bined Speech Association and the
Speech and Drama Department
will sponsor a discussion on KP
IX this Sunday.
Dodds, a specialist on the Vic
torian era of literature, has been
at Stanford since 1937. Ho holds
a doctorate in literature from
Yale and has written biographies
of Thomas Southerne and Wil
liam Thackeray in addition to a
number of critical studies.
