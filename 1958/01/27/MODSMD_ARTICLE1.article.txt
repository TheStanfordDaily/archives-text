# Farm Architecture Shuns 'Old Ivy' Style Buildings
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
Visitors from the East on campus lor the first
time may be heard to comment on the remarkable
architecture and planning so unlike most of the
eastern schools. A combination of California mis
sion style and Romanesque, it is strangely dis
similar to the ivy-covered, "beneath-the-elms" plan
of Harvard or Yale.
But if one were 1o travel to Italy or Spain, or
other Mediterranean countries, he might see
styles and arrangements reflecting the Stanford
campus. And this was the plan of Stanford's land
planner, Frederick Law Olmsted, when he sent
his associates to Mediterranean areas to study the
plan of living there, thinking that those styles
would be more adaptable to California living than
the plans of the eastern colleges.
In his own words, spoken in 1886: "If we are
to look for types of buildings and arrangements
suitable lo the climate of California, it . . . will be
in those founded by the . . . men of Syria, Greece,
Italy and Spain. . . . This cannot come from any
stately beauty of the buildings, any picturesque
ness in the manner of their disposition, or any
gardening or landscape appendages. They must
have scholarly dignity, musl not be ostentatiously
costly and must be unobtrusively incidental to a
manifestly useful purpose."
Olmsted laid out the original University plan
in 1887, in consultation with Sen. Leland Stanford.
The idea of a quadrangle with buildings around it
was Olmsted's idea, derived from his studies of
Italian and Spanish town plazas. According to
Jack Lyriri of the Planning Office, "if Senator
Stanford had gotten a less understanding man,
the whole University might have become a trans
planted Ivy League college."

Olmsted, however, having planned Yosemite
National Park and New York city's Central Park,
laid out the main arboretum with a keynote on
naturalness. This is illustrated today as well by
the football stadium and Frost Amphitheater.
Considered "very successful bits of architecture"
by the Planning Office, they become a real part
of the University by blending into the campus.
It was the senator's dream that the main arbo
retum be a "library of trees," including every
kind of tree in the world that would grow in this
area. But due to his death, and Mrs. Stanford's
legal problems that followed, the dream was lost
—at least for the foreseeable future.
The arboretum was planned to be, and is, func
tional as well as beautiful. It is believe that it
acts as a giant sponge, absorbing water which
percolates underground, eventually reaching the
wells from which the campus gets its drinking
water.
The reason for grass not being planted in the
Inner Quad is that Olmsted, understanding the
reason for the quadrangle, foresaw the continual
crossing and crisscrossing of students. Since grass
is hard to care for much more so with perpetual
footsteps he planned for the shrubbery to be
clustered in groups just as we know it today.
Another ingenious plan of his was the depress
ing of the flower and shrubbery beds at ihe Stan
ford end of Palm Drive. Olmsted's original plan
called for solid beds of shrubbery on a height
even with (he road, but somehow this plan was
never fully carried out.
Director of planning Eldridge T. Spencer, who
has been at Stanford since 1945, has extended
Olmsted's concepts into a master plan of inter
locking roads and buildings, according to Lynd,

and is developing a theory of planning around the
existing buildings and grounds.
And in the future "the core of the University
is intended to become a series of pedestrianways,"
Lynd continued, "with roads penetrating into, but
not through, the pedestrian core." This was also
the idea of Olmsted's original plan—a main road
way going around the campus, with smaller roads
going in and others leading out, but none leading
through.
The quickest way to get around the campus,
then, will be via this peripheral roadway, leaving
Lasuen and other present automotive roads avail
able only to pedestrians and bicyclists. Lynd
pointed out that the plan essentially takes the
existing landscaping and buildings and, with a
minimum of effort, creates among them a
pleasant place to walk and ride.
This interlocking and fitting together of the
parts of the University would be ideally a way to
make a whole city into a park. The campus would
consist of varying degrees of park certainly, but.
one would, or should, never feel that one is in an
"industrial section"- as Lynd phrases it, "a com
bination of rural and urban mixed," keeping Ihe
quality by which ihe grounds were originally
called The Farm, while at the same time expand
ing, as Ihe purpose is not to discourage growth.
Many speculations have been made about the
elliptical shape of the road pattern in front of
Memorial Court. One of the most interesting is
the theory that after the coach-and-four drove up
to let passengers off, the horses would need a
drive to cool off.
Another unanswered question concerns the
axis of the University, which is approximately

17 degrees away from true north. Governor's
Avenue, which led past the Stanfords' home on
the present Convalescent Home site, is due north
and-south; therefore why should the other be
slightly off-balance?
One theory has it that because the magnet it-
North Pole differs from the true north, the con
structing engineers set up the University plan on
a magnetic north axis, as this made their work
easier.
And if Olmsted's master plan had been specifi
cally followed, all students would now be living
in little cottages (such as Guthrie House*, sur
rounding the Quad. Due to the economy of mass
feeding, and Mrs. Stanford's preference for more
important buildings, Encina was built for men
students and a similar building (called Roblei,
near the Chemistry building, was built for the
women students. It wasn't until the advent of
fraternities and sororities that smaller residences
were built.
The newer buildings, such as Wilbur and Stern,
although this is not noticeable from the view of
the passer-by, are set up on the same over-all
Quad plan as the old, original quadrangle and
kept on the court design. This will also be true
of ihc now Student Activities area, though the
buildings themselves will not be arranged at rigid
right angles to each other.
As the University expands, it is intended that
roads, buildings and landscape will each in turn
blend in with the campus scheme and California
style. Lynd concluded by emphasizing that "the
whole University should continue to be more im
portant than its parts, just as Olmsted originally
planned it."

of ihc now Student Activities area, though the

roads, buildings and landscape will each in turn
blend in with the campus scheme and California
style. Lynd concluded by emphasizing that "the

planned it."


Till; QUAD WAS PURPOSELY NOT PLANTED WITH GRASS
Visitors from the East on campus lor the first
time may be heard to comment on the remarkable
architecture and planning so unlike most of the
eastern schools. A combination of California mis
sion style and Romanesque, it is strangely dis
similar to the ivy-covered, "beneath-the-elms" plan
of Harvard or Yale.
But if one were 1o travel to Italy or Spain, or
other Mediterranean countries, he might see
styles and arrangements reflecting the Stanford
campus. And this was the plan of Stanford's land
planner, Frederick Law Olmsted, when he sent
his associates to Mediterranean areas to study the
plan of living there, thinking that those styles
would be more adaptable to California living than
the plans of the eastern colleges.
In his own words, spoken in 1886: "If we are
to look for types of buildings and arrangements
suitable lo the climate of California, it . . . will be
in those founded by the . . . men of Syria, Greece,
Italy and Spain. . . . This cannot come from any
stately beauty of the buildings, any picturesque
ness in the manner of their disposition, or any
gardening or landscape appendages. They must
have scholarly dignity, musl not be ostentatiously
costly and must be unobtrusively incidental to a
manifestly useful purpose."
Olmsted laid out the original University plan
in 1887, in consultation with Sen. Leland Stanford.
The idea of a quadrangle with buildings around it
was Olmsted's idea, derived from his studies of
Italian and Spanish town plazas. According to
Jack Lyriri of the Planning Office, "if Senator
Stanford had gotten a less understanding man,
the whole University might have become a trans
planted Ivy League college."

Olmsted, however, having planned Yosemite
National Park and New York city's Central Park,
laid out the main arboretum with a keynote on
naturalness. This is illustrated today as well by
the football stadium and Frost Amphitheater.
Considered "very successful bits of architecture"
by the Planning Office, they become a real part
of the University by blending into the campus.
It was the senator's dream that the main arbo
retum be a "library of trees," including every
kind of tree in the world that would grow in this
area. But due to his death, and Mrs. Stanford's
legal problems that followed, the dream was lost
—at least for the foreseeable future.
The arboretum was planned to be, and is, func
tional as well as beautiful. It is believe that it
acts as a giant sponge, absorbing water which
percolates underground, eventually reaching the
wells from which the campus gets its drinking
water.
The reason for grass not being planted in the
Inner Quad is that Olmsted, understanding the
reason for the quadrangle, foresaw the continual
crossing and crisscrossing of students. Since grass
is hard to care for much more so with perpetual
footsteps he planned for the shrubbery to be
clustered in groups just as we know it today.
Another ingenious plan of his was the depress
ing of the flower and shrubbery beds at ihe Stan
ford end of Palm Drive. Olmsted's original plan
called for solid beds of shrubbery on a height
even with (he road, but somehow this plan was
never fully carried out.
Director of planning Eldridge T. Spencer, who
has been at Stanford since 1945, has extended
Olmsted's concepts into a master plan of inter
locking roads and buildings, according to Lynd,

and is developing a theory of planning around the
existing buildings and grounds.
And in the future "the core of the University
is intended to become a series of pedestrianways,"
Lynd continued, "with roads penetrating into, but
not through, the pedestrian core." This was also
the idea of Olmsted's original plan—a main road
way going around the campus, with smaller roads
going in and others leading out, but none leading
through.
The quickest way to get around the campus,
then, will be via this peripheral roadway, leaving
Lasuen and other present automotive roads avail
able only to pedestrians and bicyclists. Lynd
pointed out that the plan essentially takes the
existing landscaping and buildings and, with a
minimum of effort, creates among them a
pleasant place to walk and ride.
This interlocking and fitting together of the
parts of the University would be ideally a way to
make a whole city into a park. The campus would
consist of varying degrees of park certainly, but.
one would, or should, never feel that one is in an
"industrial section"- as Lynd phrases it, "a com
bination of rural and urban mixed," keeping Ihe
quality by which ihe grounds were originally
called The Farm, while at the same time expand
ing, as Ihe purpose is not to discourage growth.
Many speculations have been made about the
elliptical shape of the road pattern in front of
Memorial Court. One of the most interesting is
the theory that after the coach-and-four drove up
to let passengers off, the horses would need a
drive to cool off.
Another unanswered question concerns the
axis of the University, which is approximately

17 degrees away from true north. Governor's
Avenue, which led past the Stanfords' home on
the present Convalescent Home site, is due north
and-south; therefore why should the other be
slightly off-balance?
One theory has it that because the magnet it-
North Pole differs from the true north, the con
structing engineers set up the University plan on
a magnetic north axis, as this made their work
easier.
And if Olmsted's master plan had been specifi
cally followed, all students would now be living
in little cottages (such as Guthrie House*, sur
rounding the Quad. Due to the economy of mass
feeding, and Mrs. Stanford's preference for more
important buildings, Encina was built for men
students and a similar building (called Roblei,
near the Chemistry building, was built for the
women students. It wasn't until the advent of
fraternities and sororities that smaller residences
were built.
The newer buildings, such as Wilbur and Stern,
although this is not noticeable from the view of
the passer-by, are set up on the same over-all
Quad plan as the old, original quadrangle and
kept on the court design. This will also be true
of ihc now Student Activities area, though the
buildings themselves will not be arranged at rigid
right angles to each other.
As the University expands, it is intended that

students and a similar building (called Roblei,
near the Chemistry building, was built for the
women students. It wasn't until the advent of
fraternities and sororities that smaller residences
were built.
The newer buildings, such as Wilbur and Stern,
although this is not noticeable from the view of
the passer-by, are set up on the same over-all
Quad plan as the old, original quadrangle and
kept on the court design. This will also be true
of ihc now Student Activities area, though the
buildings themselves will not be arranged at rigid
right angles to each other.
As the University expands, it is intended that
roads, buildings and landscape will each in turn
blend in with the campus scheme and California
style. Lynd concluded by emphasizing that "the
whole University should continue to be more im
portant than its parts, just as Olmsted originally
planned it."


Till; QUAD WAS PURPOSELY NOT PLANTED WITH GRASS
Visitors from the East on campus lor the first
time may be heard to comment on the remarkable
architecture and planning so unlike most of the
eastern schools. A combination of California mis
sion style and Romanesque, it is strangely dis
similar to the ivy-covered, "beneath-the-elms" plan
of Harvard or Yale.
But if one were 1o travel to Italy or Spain, or
other Mediterranean countries, he might see
styles and arrangements reflecting the Stanford
campus. And this was the plan of Stanford's land
planner, Frederick Law Olmsted, when he sent
his associates to Mediterranean areas to study the
plan of living there, thinking that those styles
would be more adaptable to California living than
the plans of the eastern colleges.
In his own words, spoken in 1886: "If we are
to look for types of buildings and arrangements
suitable lo the climate of California, it . . . will be
in those founded by the . . . men of Syria, Greece,
Italy and Spain. . . . This cannot come from any
stately beauty of the buildings, any picturesque
ness in the manner of their disposition, or any
gardening or landscape appendages. They must
have scholarly dignity, musl not be ostentatiously
costly and must be unobtrusively incidental to a
manifestly useful purpose."
Olmsted laid out the original University plan
in 1887, in consultation with Sen. Leland Stanford.
The idea of a quadrangle with buildings around it
was Olmsted's idea, derived from his studies of
Italian and Spanish town plazas. According to
Jack Lyriri of the Planning Office, "if Senator
Stanford had gotten a less understanding man,
the whole University might have become a trans
planted Ivy League college."

Olmsted, however, having planned Yosemite
National Park and New York city's Central Park,
laid out the main arboretum with a keynote on
naturalness. This is illustrated today as well by
the football stadium and Frost Amphitheater.
Considered "very successful bits of architecture"
by the Planning Office, they become a real part
of the University by blending into the campus.
It was the senator's dream that the main arbo
retum be a "library of trees," including every
kind of tree in the world that would grow in this
area. But due to his death, and Mrs. Stanford's
legal problems that followed, the dream was lost
—at least for the foreseeable future.
The arboretum was planned to be, and is, func
tional as well as beautiful. It is believe that it
acts as a giant sponge, absorbing water which
percolates underground, eventually reaching the
wells from which the campus gets its drinking
water.
The reason for grass not being planted in the
Inner Quad is that Olmsted, understanding the
reason for the quadrangle, foresaw the continual
crossing and crisscrossing of students. Since grass
is hard to care for much more so with perpetual
footsteps he planned for the shrubbery to be
clustered in groups just as we know it today.
Another ingenious plan of his was the depress
ing of the flower and shrubbery beds at ihe Stan
ford end of Palm Drive. Olmsted's original plan
called for solid beds of shrubbery on a height
even with (he road, but somehow this plan was
never fully carried out.
Director of planning Eldridge T. Spencer, who
has been at Stanford since 1945, has extended
Olmsted's concepts into a master plan of inter
locking roads and buildings, according to Lynd,

and is developing a theory of planning around the
existing buildings and grounds.
And in the future "the core of the University
is intended to become a series of pedestrianways,"
Lynd continued, "with roads penetrating into, but
not through, the pedestrian core." This was also
the idea of Olmsted's original plan—a main road
way going around the campus, with smaller roads
going in and others leading out, but none leading
through.
The quickest way to get around the campus,
then, will be via this peripheral roadway, leaving
Lasuen and other present automotive roads avail
able only to pedestrians and bicyclists. Lynd
pointed out that the plan essentially takes the
existing landscaping and buildings and, with a
minimum of effort, creates among them a
pleasant place to walk and ride.
This interlocking and fitting together of the
parts of the University would be ideally a way to
make a whole city into a park. The campus would
consist of varying degrees of park certainly, but.
one would, or should, never feel that one is in an
"industrial section"- as Lynd phrases it, "a com
bination of rural and urban mixed," keeping Ihe
quality by which ihe grounds were originally
called The Farm, while at the same time expand
ing, as Ihe purpose is not to discourage growth.
Many speculations have been made about the
elliptical shape of the road pattern in front of
Memorial Court. One of the most interesting is
the theory that after the coach-and-four drove up
to let passengers off, the horses would need a
drive to cool off.
Another unanswered question concerns the
axis of the University, which is approximately

17 degrees away from true north. Governor's
Avenue, which led past the Stanfords' home on
the present Convalescent Home site, is due north
and-south; therefore why should the other be
slightly off-balance?
One theory has it that because the magnet it-
North Pole differs from the true north, the con
structing engineers set up the University plan on
a magnetic north axis, as this made their work
easier.
And if Olmsted's master plan had been specifi
cally followed, all students would now be living
in little cottages (such as Guthrie House*, sur
rounding the Quad. Due to the economy of mass
feeding, and Mrs. Stanford's preference for more
important buildings, Encina was built for men
students and a similar building (called Roblei,
near the Chemistry building, was built for the
women students. It wasn't until the advent of
fraternities and sororities that smaller residences

North Pole differs from the true north, the con
structing engineers set up the University plan on
a magnetic north axis, as this made their work
easier.
And if Olmsted's master plan had been specifi
cally followed, all students would now be living
in little cottages (such as Guthrie House*, sur
rounding the Quad. Due to the economy of mass
feeding, and Mrs. Stanford's preference for more
important buildings, Encina was built for men
students and a similar building (called Roblei,
near the Chemistry building, was built for the
women students. It wasn't until the advent of
fraternities and sororities that smaller residences
were built.
The newer buildings, such as Wilbur and Stern,
although this is not noticeable from the view of
the passer-by, are set up on the same over-all
Quad plan as the old, original quadrangle and
kept on the court design. This will also be true
of ihc now Student Activities area, though the
buildings themselves will not be arranged at rigid
right angles to each other.
As the University expands, it is intended that
roads, buildings and landscape will each in turn
blend in with the campus scheme and California
style. Lynd concluded by emphasizing that "the
whole University should continue to be more im
portant than its parts, just as Olmsted originally
planned it."


Till; QUAD WAS PURPOSELY NOT PLANTED WITH GRASS
Visitors from the East on campus lor the first
time may be heard to comment on the remarkable
architecture and planning so unlike most of the
eastern schools. A combination of California mis
sion style and Romanesque, it is strangely dis
similar to the ivy-covered, "beneath-the-elms" plan
of Harvard or Yale.
But if one were 1o travel to Italy or Spain, or
other Mediterranean countries, he might see
styles and arrangements reflecting the Stanford
campus. And this was the plan of Stanford's land
planner, Frederick Law Olmsted, when he sent
his associates to Mediterranean areas to study the
plan of living there, thinking that those styles
would be more adaptable to California living than
the plans of the eastern colleges.
In his own words, spoken in 1886: "If we are
to look for types of buildings and arrangements
suitable lo the climate of California, it . . . will be
in those founded by the . . . men of Syria, Greece,
Italy and Spain. . . . This cannot come from any
stately beauty of the buildings, any picturesque
ness in the manner of their disposition, or any
gardening or landscape appendages. They must
have scholarly dignity, musl not be ostentatiously
costly and must be unobtrusively incidental to a
manifestly useful purpose."
Olmsted laid out the original University plan
in 1887, in consultation with Sen. Leland Stanford.
The idea of a quadrangle with buildings around it
was Olmsted's idea, derived from his studies of
Italian and Spanish town plazas. According to
Jack Lyriri of the Planning Office, "if Senator
Stanford had gotten a less understanding man,
the whole University might have become a trans
planted Ivy League college."

Olmsted, however, having planned Yosemite
National Park and New York city's Central Park,
laid out the main arboretum with a keynote on
naturalness. This is illustrated today as well by
the football stadium and Frost Amphitheater.
Considered "very successful bits of architecture"
by the Planning Office, they become a real part
of the University by blending into the campus.
It was the senator's dream that the main arbo
retum be a "library of trees," including every
kind of tree in the world that would grow in this
area. But due to his death, and Mrs. Stanford's
legal problems that followed, the dream was lost
—at least for the foreseeable future.
The arboretum was planned to be, and is, func
tional as well as beautiful. It is believe that it
acts as a giant sponge, absorbing water which
percolates underground, eventually reaching the
wells from which the campus gets its drinking
water.
The reason for grass not being planted in the
Inner Quad is that Olmsted, understanding the
reason for the quadrangle, foresaw the continual
crossing and crisscrossing of students. Since grass
is hard to care for much more so with perpetual
footsteps he planned for the shrubbery to be
clustered in groups just as we know it today.
Another ingenious plan of his was the depress
ing of the flower and shrubbery beds at ihe Stan
ford end of Palm Drive. Olmsted's original plan
called for solid beds of shrubbery on a height
even with (he road, but somehow this plan was
never fully carried out.
Director of planning Eldridge T. Spencer, who
has been at Stanford since 1945, has extended
Olmsted's concepts into a master plan of inter
locking roads and buildings, according to Lynd,

and is developing a theory of planning around the
existing buildings and grounds.
And in the future "the core of the University
is intended to become a series of pedestrianways,"
Lynd continued, "with roads penetrating into, but
not through, the pedestrian core." This was also
the idea of Olmsted's original plan—a main road
way going around the campus, with smaller roads
going in and others leading out, but none leading
through.
The quickest way to get around the campus,
then, will be via this peripheral roadway, leaving
Lasuen and other present automotive roads avail
able only to pedestrians and bicyclists. Lynd
pointed out that the plan essentially takes the
existing landscaping and buildings and, with a
minimum of effort, creates among them a
pleasant place to walk and ride.
This interlocking and fitting together of the
parts of the University would be ideally a way to
make a whole city into a park. The campus would
consist of varying degrees of park certainly, but.
one would, or should, never feel that one is in an
"industrial section"- as Lynd phrases it, "a com
bination of rural and urban mixed," keeping Ihe
quality by which ihe grounds were originally
called The Farm, while at the same time expand
ing, as Ihe purpose is not to discourage growth.
Many speculations have been made about the
elliptical shape of the road pattern in front of
Memorial Court. One of the most interesting is
the theory that after the coach-and-four drove up
to let passengers off, the horses would need a
drive to cool off.
Another unanswered question concerns the
axis of the University, which is approximately

17 degrees away from true north. Governor's
Avenue, which led past the Stanfords' home on
the present Convalescent Home site, is due north
and-south; therefore why should the other be
slightly off-balance?
One theory has it that because the magnet it-
North Pole differs from the true north, the con
structing engineers set up the University plan on
a magnetic north axis, as this made their work
easier.
