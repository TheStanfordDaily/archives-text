# Hungarian Revolt Film Will Be Shown Tonight
## 
### 
A documentary film on the Hungarian Revolution will he to
night at 8:30 in Cubberley Auditorium. The film is composed of
snatches of movies taken by Hungarian, American and other for
eign photographers. The voices broadcasting the SOS messages
at the end are authentic.
A Hungarian student wrote the following account of the film:
"If we want to describe what is happening on the Red side of the
world, we might say that some irresponsible, power-willing people
run full-scale experiments on economics, sociology, endurance of
human durability, patience.
"This vivisection of the people of Russia and Poland bore its
harvest of hatred: the insulted human dignity found its way of
retaliation in Berlin 1953, Poznan 1956 and Hungary 1936.
"Reporters, nameless heroes of that spontaneous fight, took
pictures of the events. You will recognize the U.S. Embassy's
Plymouth out of which some of the pictures were taken. Some of
the photo-reporters were actually wounded."
Former students of the University of Budapest will be present
to answer questions after the showing of the film.
