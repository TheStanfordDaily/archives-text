### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” Ambassa
dor Llewellyn Thompson came
home from Moscow yesterday to
arrange talks between the Unit
ed States and Russia. He said he
does not seem to have made any
progress so far.
Thompson will report to Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary
of State Dulles.
His return coincided with ar
rival of evidence that Russia not
only is standing firm on all its
oft - rejected proposals for East-
West negotiations but may in

fact bo hardening its position
and raising its terms.
Communist Party boss Nikita
Khrushchev said Russia would
discuss Eisenhower's recent pro
posal to Premier Nikolai Bulga
nin for a ban on outer space
weapons and warfare only if the
Western powers agreed to all of
Russia's major disarmament de
mands.
These include dismantling U.S.
military bases abroad, the reduc
tion of foreign forces in Germany
and other European countries, an
immediate ban on nuclear weap
ons as well as the testing of such
weapons and the creation of an
atom-free zone in Central Europe.
