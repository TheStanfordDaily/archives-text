broad section of the northern
Midwest. And a new rain pattern
spread through the Southeast.

Rocky Mountains, dumping snow
and rain over the plateau area
and pushing scattered showers
into New Mexico.

five persons dead and one miss
ing, drove five families from
their homes, caused a train dc
railment, snarled highway travel
and knocked down several power
lines.

wet pavement near Santa Rosa.
