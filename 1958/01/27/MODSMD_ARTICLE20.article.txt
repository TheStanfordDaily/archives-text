# Storm Sweeps Nation; Gales Lash Bay Area
## 5 Die, 1 Missing. Families Routed In Local Storm 
### Compiled from the Associated Press 
The San Francisco Bay Area
was hard hit over the weekend by
a storm which was part of a na
tionwide series of downpours,
snowfalls and gales.
A four-day-old storm poured
more snow and rain on large
areas of New York and tho New
England states. The Pacific Coast
had a third straight day of soak
ing rains. New snow fell over a
broad section of the northern
Midwest. And a new rain pattern
spread through the Southeast.
Winds of gale strength also
lashed the West Coast as the
storm rolled eastward to the
Rocky Mountains, dumping snow
and rain over the plateau area
and pushing scattered showers
into New Mexico.
In the Day Area, the storm left
five persons dead and one miss
ing, drove five families from
their homes, caused a train dc
railment, snarled highway travel
and knocked down several power
lines.
The dead were:
Calvin Sassarini, 45, Sonoma
County elementary school super
intendent, whose auto skidded on
wet pavement near Santa Rosa.
Alvin Brandt, 67, Berkeley, and
James Bristow, 31, Treasure I ;
land, killed in a five-car smashup
in pouring rain on the San Fran
cisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
Martin del Toro, 60, Crockett,
and Jose O. Moreno, 52, who
failed to see an oncoming train
through the driving rain and
were run down afoot at Crocket 1.
Missing was a 12-year-old Boy
Scout, Dennis Wurschmidt <>l
Willows, who became lost during
a blizzard in the Grindstone Can
yon area of Mendocino National
Forest 130 miles north of San
Francisco.
Four persons were injured in
the Bay Bridge smashup when a
San Francisco-hound car crossed
the center line and was hit by an
other. Three other cars crashed
into the wreckage.
Forty homes wore caught in
swirling flood waters from Rosa
Creek in the Granton Park area
of Kentfield, Marin County, 18
miles north of San Francisco.
Water rose so high that five fam
ilies had to be taken out by boat
Saturday night. They were re
turned home as the water re
ceded yesterday.
In San Mateo County, the sher
if's office reported that the
Coast Highway, State Route No.
1, was made dangerous but pas
sable by a slide near Mussel
Rook. A previous slide near West
lake in suburban San Francisco
was cleared for traffic Saturday
just before the new storm broke.
The storm, accompanied by 35-
mile-an-hour winds, left 2.60
inches of Rain at Hamilton Air
Force Base in Marin County, 1.47
inches at Red Bluff in the Sacra
mento Valley, 1.30 inches at
Santa Rose and an inch at San
Francisco Airport in San Mateo
County.

was hard hit over the weekend by
a storm which was part of a na
tionwide series of downpours,
snowfalls and gales.
A four-day-old storm poured
more snow and rain on large
areas of New York and tho New
England states. The Pacific Coast
had a third straight day of soak
ing rains. New snow fell over a
broad section of the northern
Midwest. And a new rain pattern
spread through the Southeast.
Winds of gale strength also
lashed the West Coast as the
storm rolled eastward to the
Rocky Mountains, dumping snow
and rain over the plateau area
and pushing scattered showers
into New Mexico.
In the Day Area, the storm left
five persons dead and one miss
ing, drove five families from
their homes, caused a train dc
railment, snarled highway travel
and knocked down several power
lines.
The dead were:
Calvin Sassarini, 45, Sonoma
County elementary school super
intendent, whose auto skidded on
wet pavement near Santa Rosa.
Alvin Brandt, 67, Berkeley, and
James Bristow, 31, Treasure I ;
land, killed in a five-car smashup
in pouring rain on the San Fran
cisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
Martin del Toro, 60, Crockett,
and Jose O. Moreno, 52, who
failed to see an oncoming train
through the driving rain and
were run down afoot at Crocket 1.
Missing was a 12-year-old Boy
Scout, Dennis Wurschmidt <>l
Willows, who became lost during
a blizzard in the Grindstone Can
yon area of Mendocino National
Forest 130 miles north of San
Francisco.
Four persons were injured in
the Bay Bridge smashup when a
San Francisco-hound car crossed
the center line and was hit by an
other. Three other cars crashed
into the wreckage.
Forty homes wore caught in
swirling flood waters from Rosa
Creek in the Granton Park area
of Kentfield, Marin County, 18
miles north of San Francisco.
Water rose so high that five fam
ilies had to be taken out by boat
Saturday night. They were re
turned home as the water re
ceded yesterday.
In San Mateo County, the sher
if's office reported that the
Coast Highway, State Route No.
1, was made dangerous but pas
sable by a slide near Mussel
Rook. A previous slide near West
lake in suburban San Francisco
was cleared for traffic Saturday
just before the new storm broke.
The storm, accompanied by 35-
mile-an-hour winds, left 2.60
inches of Rain at Hamilton Air
Force Base in Marin County, 1.47
inches at Red Bluff in the Sacra
mento Valley, 1.30 inches at
Santa Rose and an inch at San
Francisco Airport in San Mateo
