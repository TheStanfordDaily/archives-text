# Stanford Postmark
## 
### 
Although there is a post office branch known
as "Stanford, California,'" the chances are that
the letters yon mai! home arrive at their desti
nation proclaiming "Palo Alto, Calif."
We note this tendency with regret, for, al
though a postmark is nothing of earth-shaking
importance, it does have some sentimental
value to ns of the Stanford community.
It was about a year ago that the Stanford
post ofliee—as an economy measure —stopped
canceling out-of-town mail. (Letters mailed

here for campus addresses are still processed
locally.) One of the Stanford postmarking
machines was moved to the South Palo Alto
post office branch, with the intention of chan
neling all campus mail through it.
Hut good intentions sometimes don't got car
ried out —at least in the case of campus mail
hearing the name "Stanford." \\ c hope our
friends in the post office will get out the old
Stanford postmarking machine again and really
put it to use.
