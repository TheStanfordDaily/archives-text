# THIS WEEK ON QUAD
## St. Bernards in the Stacks 
### Dave Quarles 
We understand that beginning this week the
main libe will have two pure-blooded St. Ber
nards in its employ. It seems that the freshmen
have been assigned research papers and are get
ting hopelessly lost in the wilds of the stacks.
Friday we met one freshman staggering out of
tlie 480.36G4250b - 483.66M6950s row with two
days' growth on his chin and babbling Greek.
Those who want to contribute to the upkeep of
the St. Bernards may leave money at the main
desk in the libe.
Although we hate to dwell on nondescript mat
ters, we must uphold our reputation for accurate
prediction. The Chappie failed to appear as
scheduled last Wednesday because of a lack of
mediocre material. This Wednesday the mag
will come forth chock full of elephantine enter
tainment for everyone.

The aborigines will be in native costume in the
Women's Gym tonight when the Stanford Folk
Dancers start their ceremonies at 8.

Bruce Stewart, cinematographer, is scheduled
to give an illustrated lecture entitled "Everyday
and Holiday in Sweden" for the Tuesday Evening
Series. We have been told that every day is
pretty much of a holiday in Sweden. See for
yourself at 7:30 in Mem Aud.

Gollygeegoodygumdrop! The Physics Depart
ment will present "Magnetohydrodynamics" by
Rolf Landshoff of the Lockheed Aircraft Corpo
ration Wednesday in Room 101, Physics Lecture
Hall. Besides 'Magnetohydrodynamics," there
will be a brief discussion of "Antidisestablish
mentarianism."
In the "At Long Last" Department will be the
program at 4:15 p.m. Wednesday in the Little
Theater, Mem Aud. Anatole Mazour, professor
of history, intends to discuss "Theater in Russia
Today" with special emphasis on how the Rus
sians manage those heavy iron curtains.
Chappie Day, so they say.

Professor Leon Ehrenpreis of Brandeis Uni
versity is going to bring out into the open the
scourge of American youth when he frankly dis
cusses "Some New Methods in the Solution of
Cauchy's Problem." Cauchy, as you probably
know, was a Cal student who contracted the
problem while on vacation last summer in Tan

ganyika. Since then Cauchy's Problem has
spread like wildfire to every campus in the U.S.
As a public service, Professor Ehrenpreis will
appear at 3:15 p.m. Thursday to discuss the prob
lem in Room 104, Sequoia Hall. REMEMBER:
Cauchy Caught It, You Can Too!
The Department of Pharmacology Seminar
will present at 4 p.m. Thursday, in the Pharma
cology Conference Room, B. Volcani and"The
Dead Sea—Bacteria, Salt and Civilization." The
Dead Sea may have us beat for civilization, but
it surely can't top Lake Lag bacterially speaking.
We always knew the good old Chemistry De
partment was sympathetic to student problems.
If you have any test-taking troubles the Chem
people want you to be sure to come at 4:15 p.m.
Thursday to .Room 20, Chemistry Building, when
Scott Lynn discusses "Studies in Gas Absorp
tion."
Film Series in Cub Aud at 4:15 p.m. and 7:30
p.m. with "Umberto D." Membership cards for
the matinee performances are on sale at Mem
Aud box office.
At 8:15 p.m. Thursday the curtain goes up on
the Stanford Players' presentation of "He Who
Gets Slapped" or "Failure in the Cactus Gar
dens." Tickets for the Mem Aud performance are
going at $1.50 and $1 in the Mem Aud box office.

and $1.25.
Make the decision before 7:30 to see "Decision
Before Dawn" at the Flicks Sunday night. It's a
very unusual World War II movie and well
worth the 20 cents. An R.R. (beep-beep) cartoon
is the added attraction for the Mem Aud per
formance.

We understand that beginning this week the
main libe will have two pure-blooded St. Ber
nards in its employ. It seems that the freshmen
have been assigned research papers and are get

Friday we met one freshman staggering out of
tlie 480.36G4250b - 483.66M6950s row with two
days' growth on his chin and babbling Greek.
Those who want to contribute to the upkeep of
the St. Bernards may leave money at the main
desk in the libe.
Although we hate to dwell on nondescript mat
ters, we must uphold our reputation for accurate
prediction. The Chappie failed to appear as
scheduled last Wednesday because of a lack of
mediocre material. This Wednesday the mag
will come forth chock full of elephantine enter
tainment for everyone.

Professor Leon Ehrenpreis of Brandeis Uni
versity is going to bring out into the open the
scourge of American youth when he frankly dis
cusses "Some New Methods in the Solution of
Cauchy's Problem." Cauchy, as you probably

We always knew the good old Chemistry De
partment was sympathetic to student problems.
If you have any test-taking troubles the Chem
people want you to be sure to come at 4:15 p.m.

is the added attraction for the Mem Aud per
