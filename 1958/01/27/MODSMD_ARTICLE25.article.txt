# IN ADOPTED FAMILY
## 'Experiment in International Living Builds Better World, Offers Travel 
### Rita Robison 
Every day it becomes more evi
dent that peoples of the world
must learn to live together within
a framework of cooperation and
understanding. The Experiment in
International Living has for 25
years provided the building ma
terials for this "better world" as
well as offering a unique adven
ture in overseas travel.
Those who take a part in "The
Experiment," as it is called, are
able to see their selected country
through the eyes of its people by
"adopting" one of its families and
living and traveling with them.
The two most important ele
ments in the program are the
group and the family overseas.
Groups are kept small about
10 members each—and members
come from every state in the
Union. The director of the group's
activities is a leader of proved
ability and experience.
The Experiment believes that
"people learn to live together by
living together," and the family
overseas is a way of really getting
inside another country and learn
ing how the people of that coun
try live, work and think.
Efforts are made to place each
Experimenter in a home where
there are other young people of
similar age and interests. Con
tacts are often made between the
traveling student and the family
abroad before the student ever
leaves the United States.
It is especially valuable to the
student to get to know his "fam
ily" naturally and well. Approxi
mately three to four weeks are
spent with this family, taking 40-
mile bicycle tours, two-day moun
tain-climbing excursions into the
Austrian Alps (for example, up
the Grossvenediger —second high
est peak in thai region—with an
overnight stop in a quaint moun
tain hut called Lienzerclolomiten

kirschbaumeralmeralms c h nt z •
haus).
A student's travels might take
him to the lovely city of Vienna,
to romantic Venice, or glib Dub
lin, Hol'brauhaus-Munich, or bus
tling Rotterdam, to mention just
a few.
People question the name "Ex
perimenters" which is applied to
program participants. The answer
is that each has an experience
which is all his own, and no one
knows—until he has tried it- if
he has the understanding needed
to turn strangers into friends.
Twenty-three Stanford students
participated in The Experiment
last year, visiting such countries
as Austria, Britain, Chile, Ger
many, Franc e, Italy, Norway,
Mexico, Spain and Switzerland.
Other countries one may visit
are Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Holland, India, Japan, Nigeria, Po
land, Sweden and Yugoslavia.
Students are carefully selected
on a basis of personal merit re
gardless of race, color or religion.
Recommendations may come from

professors, employers, other asso
ciates and former Experimenters.
Candidates, except for the spe
cial adult group, must be between
16 and 30 years of age.
The Experiment in Internation
al Living is a nonprofit organiza
tion founded in 1932 by Donald B.
Watt. An independent organiza
tion, it is supported financially by
members' fees, foundation grants
and contributions.
With offices in 20 countries, The
Experiment has its U.S. headquar
ters in Putney, Vt. Applications
may be secured from The Experi
ment, 3 W. Carrillo St., Santa Bar
bara, Calif.
This year the program will send
800 Experimenters abroad and
will bring more than half that
number to American shores.

Those who take a part in "The
Experiment," as it is called, are
able to see their selected country
through the eyes of its people by
"adopting" one of its families and
living and traveling with them.
The two most important ele
ments in the program are the
group and the family overseas.
Groups are kept small about
10 members each—and members
come from every state in the
Union. The director of the group's
activities is a leader of proved
ability and experience.
The Experiment believes that
"people learn to live together by
living together," and the family
overseas is a way of really getting
inside another country and learn
ing how the people of that coun
try live, work and think.
Efforts are made to place each
Experimenter in a home where
there are other young people of
similar age and interests. Con
tacts are often made between the
traveling student and the family
abroad before the student ever
leaves the United States.
It is especially valuable to the
student to get to know his "fam
ily" naturally and well. Approxi
mately three to four weeks are
spent with this family, taking 40-
mile bicycle tours, two-day moun
tain-climbing excursions into the
Austrian Alps (for example, up
the Grossvenediger —second high
est peak in thai region—with an
overnight stop in a quaint moun
tain hut called Lienzerclolomiten

kirschbaumeralmeralms c h nt z •
haus).
A student's travels might take
him to the lovely city of Vienna,
to romantic Venice, or glib Dub
lin, Hol'brauhaus-Munich, or bus
tling Rotterdam, to mention just
a few.
People question the name "Ex
perimenters" which is applied to
program participants. The answer
is that each has an experience
which is all his own, and no one
knows—until he has tried it- if
he has the understanding needed
to turn strangers into friends.
Twenty-three Stanford students
participated in The Experiment
last year, visiting such countries
as Austria, Britain, Chile, Ger
many, Franc e, Italy, Norway,
Mexico, Spain and Switzerland.
Other countries one may visit
are Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Holland, India, Japan, Nigeria, Po
land, Sweden and Yugoslavia.
Students are carefully selected
on a basis of personal merit re
gardless of race, color or religion.
Recommendations may come from

professors, employers, other asso
ciates and former Experimenters.
Candidates, except for the spe
cial adult group, must be between
16 and 30 years of age.
The Experiment in Internation
al Living is a nonprofit organiza
tion founded in 1932 by Donald B.
Watt. An independent organiza
tion, it is supported financially by
members' fees, foundation grants
and contributions.
With offices in 20 countries, The
Experiment has its U.S. headquar
ters in Putney, Vt. Applications
may be secured from The Experi
ment, 3 W. Carrillo St., Santa Bar

This year the program will send
800 Experimenters abroad and
will bring more than half that
number to American shores.
