# TRIUMPH, 12-5
## Ruggers Score Repeat Win Over Peninsula Ramblers 
### 
The Stanford ruggers again mastered the Peninsula Ramblers of
Palo Alto Saturday, 12-5. It was a repeat performance for the In
dians, for they had beaten the same Rambler team, 10-3, the previous
week.
Stanford did not look as sharp, especially in the serum, as they

had looked the week before, part
ly because ihe Ramblers' team
work improved and partly because
of strong winds.
Kyrk Heid started the scoring
for Stanford with a 35-yard pen
alty kick into the ever - present

again with a try which came when
a scrum member fell on a loose

Reid's conversion attempt was
low and wide to the left, and Stan
ford led, 6-0, after six minutes of
play.

added another penalty kick just
before the half ended, to make the
score 9-0.
About 10 minutes into the sec
