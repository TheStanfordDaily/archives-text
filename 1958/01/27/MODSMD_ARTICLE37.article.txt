# Stanford Basketballers Return to Play
## Launch Three-Game Stint In Northwest Friday Night 
### 
Howie Dallmar's basket bailors
ready themselves this week for a
tough three-game invasion of the
Northwest. The Indians are out
to better their eighth-place stand
ing in the PCC.
After a week's layoff caused by
semester tests at other confer
ence schools, Stanford resumes
play against Washington Friday
night. The Huskies had little
trouble in beating the Cards two
weeks ago on the Indian court.
Husky Advantage
This weekend Washington will
have the advantage of the home
court—l3,ooo-soat Edmuston Pa
vilion where the Huskies con
tained rugged OSC, 45-42, last
Saturday.
Doug Smart is still the big gun
for Tippy Dye's squad, having a
two-game performance of 41
points against Oregon State.
Following Friday's game in Se
attle, the Indians travel to Cor
vallis for a Saturday night battle
with OSC. In their games with
Washington, the Beavers still
seemed to be 1 the off and-on club
they were when they made their
swing into the Bay Area two
weekends ago.
To Be Watched
Big Dave Gambee will still be
Ihe man for Sanford to watch.
He scored 19 against the Indians
two weeks ago and had a 20-point
performance against Washington
on Friday. However, he did sink
to 11 in the Saturday game.
The Beavers are now in fourth
place behind Cal, UCLA and
Idaho.
Stanford plays its final game
of the Northwest campaign on
Monday against the University of
Oregon in Eugene. This could be
Ti "high"- tfeOrifltf T a*ffa!r as the
Ducks allowed their opponents
12(> points and scored 139 points
in their weekend split with WSC
and Idaho.

The Indians may have thoir
hands full in containing Oregon's
Charlie Franklin who had a 3f>-
point effort against Idaho.
Stanford practiced only one
day last week as Dallmar
thought the layoff would do the
team more good than a solid
wook of drill. The rest was wel
comed after the hard work the
Indians have been going through
following their short Christmas
vacation.
Practice will resume today in
preparation for ihe five-day road
trip, the longest of the PCC sea
son for the Cards. After the
three-game series up north the
Indians will he home for one
week and then they travel to the
Southland for the last away se
ries of the season.
