WASHINGTON (/P)—The first
attempt ever made in this coun
try to bring order out of chaos
in the field of scientific literature
will get under way in Philadel
phia Wednesday.
This is the problem:
Masses of literature dealing
with every field of basic and ap
plied science roll off the presses
every month.
Less than 30 per cent of it is
inde x e d and abstracted, and
about 10 per cent of this is dupli
cation.
This has long been a source of
worry to American scientists.
Little was done, however, until
the Russians fired their first
earth • circling satellite into the
skies last October.
That brought on a new sense
of urgency. G. Miles Conrad, di
rector of Biological Abstracts, ad
vocating a "confederation" of all
existing scientific abstracting and
indexing services, got the Na
tional Science Foundation to un
derwrite the three-flay convention
which opens in Philadelphia Wed
nesday.
