# THE 						FORWARD LOOK
## Design, Cover Will Be New, But It's Still the Same Quad 
### Diana Smith 
The forward-looking approach of the 1958 Quad —characterized by
such innovations as senior portraits in color—will find embodiment
in a yearbook whose make-up will remain essentially the same as
in former years but whose design will be significantly different,
according to editor Mike Roemer.
Maroon and silver form the cover scheme. A silver metal plate

overlay depicting the new Dinkel
spiel Auditorium will be em
bossed into the book's cover. This
process has been employed exten
sively in industrial printing but is
a new approach in yearbook pub
lication.
Theme of the '58 Quad is "The
University Fosters Progress." In
a 10-page color introductory sec
tion the theme is illustrated in
four areas: academics, activities,
living groups and athletics. Con
centrating on the overall exposi
tion of the theme in an introduc
tory section rather than spread
ing over the book increases unity
J and meaning of the book.
Color Portraits
Color is also featured in the
senior portrait section. The Stan
-1 ford Quad is the first yearbook
| in the country to use color por-
I traits, and Stanford is the only

university to do so this year.
Major 'division pages follow
the same structural design as the
cover and the title page, two par
tially interlocking rectangles
which form a background either
for art or for the section's head
ing.
Last quarter the Quad pur
chased a telephoto lens which the
staff has been using exclusively
for sports shots and also at some
dances, including the freshman
Jolly-up. The results are rumored
to be nothing less than spectacu
lar!
Quad Queens
Men's living groups this year
have been asked to nominate one
candidate for Quad queens from
each of the four classes. A board
of Quad staff members will make
the final selection of two queens
from each class., They will bo
photographed professionally and
the name of the living group
nominating Ihem will appear on
the page with their picture.
At the end of this quarter or
the beginning of next a display of
the cover and color sections will
be shown at the Bookstore. But
for the rest of the bigger and bet
ter 1958 Quad, most students will
have to wait until the books are
distributed at the end of spring
quarter.
