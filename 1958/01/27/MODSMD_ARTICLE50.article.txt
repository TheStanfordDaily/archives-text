# Federal Contract Awarded to SRI

### 
The Federal Reserve Banks
have engaged Stanford Research
Institute to prepare operational
performance specifications for
the further mechanization of
their check handling operations.
The system to be proposed by
the Institute regards the use of
the Magnetic Ink Character Rec
ognition as the Common Machine
Language for the automatic proc
essing of checks. The Federal
Reserve Banks hope that the
work now being undertaken will
add impetus to the American
Bankers Association's program
in the field.
