ic congressional leaders are re
ported to have agreed to hold
their fire for 60 days to give Pres
ident. Eisenhower and Secretary
of Defense McElroy a chance to
come up with a Defense reorgani
zation plan.
The informal agreement appar
ently means there is likely to be
no concerted Dcmoorntic effort to
increase in 1 he Senate Eisenhow
er's request for $1,2(50,000,000 in
emergency Defense funds to meet
I he challenge of Russian missile
and satellite advances. Increases
may be sought later when the reg

ular Defense budget is considered.
