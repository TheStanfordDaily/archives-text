# Student Justice: Do the Innocent Have a Chance?
## Letter to The Editor 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
A number of the freshmen this year seem
somewhat bewildered by the Honor Code and
what behavior is expected of them. I propose to
give them an explanation. Unfortunately, this is
no idealistic explanation and so may lack theo
retical interest to some; however, it does happen
to be true.
It is due to the Honor Code that we "are al
lowed to take a break from an examination at
any time," to quote the booklet on the subject
(page 2). Naturally, it is subject to interpreta
tion. A current interpretation is: "The student
is free to leave the room at any time . . (ibid.,
page 5).
The Judicial Council is empowered with trying
suspected Honor Code violations. The Judicial
Council is an investigating body. Just ask a mem
ber and he will say so. Let us observe the way
the Judicial Council handles a case brought be
fore it.
Naturally, you are notified quickly and cour
teously when you are accused of a violation. In
stead of receiving your grade, you receive a letter
saying you have been involved in a possible Honor
Code violation. Unfortunately, you are not told
what it is, and are unable to find out either by
letter or phone. When you return to school three
months later (since nothing could be done over
the summer, and this took place spring quarter),
you find even the dean cannot toll you the accu
sation he doesn't know, since such matters are
entirely student-run. However, you are assured
that the council will contact you in the next two
days.
About two weeks later a member of the Ju

dicial Council does call you and, neglecting to tell
you the charge, informs you someone will call on
you to explain the procedure. From this person
you finally succeed in finding out something of
the cause of all the trouble. It seems you and a
friend went out for a cigarette break 2,"> minutes
after the beginning of an examâ€”when the in
structor had requested you not to leave before
half an hour. You still don't understand what the
Honor Code violation is, or what the exact charge
is, but, telling you once again that the Judicial
Council is an investigating body, the girl leaves.
When you arrive for your trial, the first ques
tion you are asked is, "Do you plead guilty or not
guilty?" If you ask, "Guilty of what?" the an
swer, naturally enough, is, "Guilty of an Honor
Code violation." You don't happen to be guilty
of one, so you say so. This is something of a
mistake, because now you will never be able to
learn the exact charge.
The trial proceeds. You are grilled periodically
and left to wait long intervals, for a total of over
three hours. The council is trying eight cases
that night -concurrently. The council wants to
know at what exact time you took the cigarette
break and during the evening mentions three
different times that your accuser has named. Of
course, you never see your accuser. In trials of
this sort the defendant is not allowed to know by
whom he is accused, or of what he is accused.
After all, this is not being run according to the
U.S. Constitution and laws. Somehow Stanford
students arc exempted from the righls forced on
them by the United States. The practices of other
countries arc much more convenient for all con
cerned.
The council further wants to know how many

pages were in the test, how many parts, and simi
lar important information. The council is an in
vestigating body. So be sure to remember such
important information about your tests for at
least three months. It should be easy for the in
telligent Stanford students. The rest of the time
the council spends in saying: "Don't you want to
change your plea? We know you're guilty. It will
be much easier for you if you change your plea."
Finally, conclusive proof is found that you are
guilty. Your accuser, with three months and
three hours to refresh his memory, has suddenly
remembered that when you returned from your
break you returned to page 1 of your exam and
began writing hastily. You are sentenced to an
"F" in the course, thereby being returned to
lower division.
You may find this a trifle upsetting, since you
are innocent, and point out to the council that
you have never been accused specifically; you
have not been told of what you are guilty; re
turning to the first page of the test has no bearing
on whether you took a break against tho instruc
tor's orders; your accuser named three times
when you supposedly took the break; it is strange
that when he is so uncertain of the time (though,
since this was apparently the cause of the accu
sation, one might expect him to remember it), he
has, after three months (and three hours) sud
denly remembered on which page of your test
you were working.
The council calmly informs you that this is all
inconsequential information. It seems they natu
rally take the word of the accuser over that of
the defendant, because they assume that the ac
cuser would have no reason to lie, while the de

fondant would. This is a truly democratic or
ganization; its members are elected.
The person who informed you of procedure
neglected to tell you the inconsequential informa
tion that you should bring witnesses to the trial.
She was too busy telling you that the Judicial
Council is an investigating body. Somewhat dis
turbed, you do a little investigating of your own,
and learn some more inconsequential information.
The investigating body never contacted your
professor. Although he had made the two tests
available, no one had compared them. The pro
fessor points out that, while you and your friend
had the same numerical score, the questions you
missed were entirely different. Furthermore, he
never said you could not take a break at any time.
Naturally, you would want to return to the first
page, since there was more than one part of the
exam on that page. Other members of the class,
however, are sure you did not return to the first
page anyway.
Of course, the Judicial Council does not operate
in this fashion in all cases. Your friend who took
the cigarette break with you, who did exactly as
you did and with whom you supposedly cheated
(at. least, if you cheated you must have gotten
your answers from her), is not found guilty. She
is merely given a warning not to behave suspi
ciously in the future.
With the new evidence you have gathered, the
investigating body is forced to reopen the case
and reverse their decision. You're very lucky
they even apologize, sort of. They say they're
sorry but it's one of those unavoidable things.
And that should convince you they are indeed a
democratic, investigating body, as they say.
