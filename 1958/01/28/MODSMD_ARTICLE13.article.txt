# Ike Asks Federal Aid For Education Step-up
## President Wants One Billion Dollars States' Co-operation in 4-Year Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —President Eisenhower yesterday gave Con
gress his plan for a four-year crash program of federal aid to educa
tion. He asked prompt enactment "in the essential interest of na
tional security."
The science-slanted blueprint, designed to spur U.S. technology in

its race against Russia, would
cost about $1,600,000,000 spread
over the next four years. The
federal government would pick
up one billion dollars of the bill,
states and local communities the
remainder.
Three times the President re
ferred to the "emergency" situa
tion. And he told Congress at
one point: "This is a temporary
program and should not be con
sidered as a permanent federal
responsibility."
Strengthen Science
Eisenhower's plan was first an
nounced in detail last Dec. 30 by
Marion B. Folsom, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Basically it calls for federal aid
to the various states for strength
ening the teaching of science and
mathematics, and federal schol
arships to bright students.
"Our immediate national secu
rity aims — to continue to
strengthen our armed forces and
improve the weapons at their
command—can be furthered," Ei
senhower said yesterday, "only
by the efforts of individuals
whose training is already far ad
vanced. But if we are to main
tain our position of leadership,
we must see to it that today's
young people are prepared to
contribute the maximum to our
future progress."
Hough Sledding
.Republicans on Capitol Hill
praised the program as "very
heartening," "effective" an d
"sound and sensible." But there
wore indications, too, that the
plan might be in for rough sled
ding.
Senator Kennedy (D.-Mass.)
Sunday criticized it for failure to
include anything for school con
struction. Kennedy said he would
introduce legislation this week
calling for federal expenditure of
about $300 million a year for five
years to relieve the schoolroom
shortage.
