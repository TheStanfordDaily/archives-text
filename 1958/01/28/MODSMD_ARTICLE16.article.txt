# Confidential Grade Averages
## 
### 
A DESIRE on the part of many students was
finally realized this year when the University
discontinued publishing grade-point averages
in the Directory, better known as the "Bawl
out.
For years it had been argued that injustice
was done when any person —just by plunking
down 50 cents —could obtain information about
other students which was really none of his
bu; ii:ess. For one year during the mid-1940's
the grade averages were omitted, but they were
reinstated the following year.
But no sooner had the averages been lelt out
c;f the Directory again than work was begun on
a "confidential Bawlout" to be distributed to
faculty members. We are told that the purpose
of this restricted directory is to help students'
advisers.
We only hope that this is the sole use to
which this booklet is put. As an aid to helping
a student plan his future course ol study, the
grades could lie invaluable; as a determiner ol

fill lire grades, ihi* confidential Bawlout could
|je mighty unjust.
The natural inclination lor a reader trying
to pore through 60 blue hooks might he to give
up at his task, look up the students' previous
records and arrive at his own grades by a very
simple —hut extremely unfair —method.
We think it is only good ethics on the part
of faculty and readers that students he graded
for the work tlu#y do in, a particular course, not
on what they'veidjone in previous classes. There
have been many cases where students "goof off"
in their freshman year and then suddenly wake
up to realities. And'thereVire some who become
lazv as seniors. In either case, grades should he
based on the work in a particular class only.
We trust that anyone who has the responsi
bility of grading w ill feel honor-hound to grade
the students fairly. And perhaps, once the
grades have been recorded, he might check to
see how his rating compared to grades in other
classes. Hut grade-point averages should not he
consulted before deciding a grade.
