# ON OTHER CAMPUSES—
## Duke Students Throw Out Honor Code 
### Barbara Hicks 
There's 1o ho no honor system at Duke Uni
versity. Students there defeated a proposed
honor system ballot by a three-to-one margin in
one part of the campus and a narrow margin in
another. The questions presented: Are you in
favor of the proposed system of academic re
sponsibility and would you be in favor of any
type of honor system? The freshman class was
the only one favoring the proposals, while sopho
mores favored the second question. Juniors and
seniors gave a resounding "No" vote on both
questions.

The University of Washington is in mourning.
Their handsome Husky mascot, Ski, lives no
more. According to the UW Daily, "She came of
illustrious parentage. Her father was lead-dog
for Admiral Byrd on one of those treks into his
private ice-box and her mother was her father's
sister. This classic indiscretion gave her an aris
tocratic bearing coupled with unpredictable pas
sion common to such liaisons." She was 13 years
old.

The Oregon Daily Emerald, which has been
attacking the Interfraternity Council for its re

fusal to defer rushing, had this item in its Think
Department: "A junior man recently walked
into the Interfraternity Council office in Stu
dent Affairs and asked to sign up for winter
term rush—wearing a pledge pin he said he had
received during Christmas vacation." Also in the
Daily Emerald's Footnotes: "Educational movies
are, it seems, getting more interesting all the
time. On the 'Educational' movie list: "The Pri
vate Life of Henry Vlll.' "
"Charlie Brown said yesterday that his father
thought that Charlie might be able to run for
President," the Cornell Daily Sun editorialized
recently. "We would like to list our support
for him right now, in the belief that Mr. Brown
could do no worse for American education than
the present incumbent, and might, indeed, do a
lot better. . . . For example, we feel sure that
Mr. Brown would recognize the needs of school
construction. Eisenhower, in contrast, is more
concerned with getting students out of the over
crowded schools and giving them all sorts of
scholarships to go to overcrowded colleges."

Scientists: "Odd, evil geniuses, unable to have

The University of Washington is in mourning.
Their handsome Husky mascot, Ski, lives no
more. According to the UW Daily, "She came of
illustrious parentage. Her father was lead-dog
for Admiral Byrd on one of those treks into his
private ice-box and her mother was her father's
sister. This classic indiscretion gave her an aris
tocratic bearing coupled with unpredictable pas
sion common to such liaisons." She was 13 years
old.

The Oregon Daily Emerald, which has been
attacking the Interfraternity Council for its re

fusal to defer rushing, had this item in its Think
Department: "A junior man recently walked
into the Interfraternity Council office in Stu
dent Affairs and asked to sign up for winter
term rush—wearing a pledge pin he said he had
received during Christmas vacation." Also in the
Daily Emerald's Footnotes: "Educational movies
are, it seems, getting more interesting all the
time. On the 'Educational' movie list: "The Pri
vate Life of Henry Vlll.' "
"Charlie Brown said yesterday that his father
thought that Charlie might be able to run for
President," the Cornell Daily Sun editorialized
recently. "We would like to list our support
for him right now, in the belief that Mr. Brown
could do no worse for American education than
the present incumbent, and might, indeed, do a
lot better. . . . For example, we feel sure that
Mr. Brown would recognize the needs of school
construction. Eisenhower, in contrast, is more
concerned with getting students out of the over
crowded schools and giving them all sorts of
scholarships to go to overcrowded colleges."

Scientists: "Odd, evil geniuses, unable to have
a normal home life and impractical in everyday
affairs"? This is the attitude of high school stu
dents, according to a recent poll conducted by
the Purdue opinion panel of Purdue University.
Some held the unflattering conception of scien
tists as "willing to sacrifice the welfare of others
for their own interests, unpatriotic, irreligious
and mentally unstable."
There's 1o ho no honor system at Duke Uni
versity. Students there defeated a proposed
honor system ballot by a three-to-one margin in
one part of the campus and a narrow margin in
another. The questions presented: Are you in
favor of the proposed system of academic re
sponsibility and would you be in favor of any
type of honor system? The freshman class was
the only one favoring the proposals, while sopho
mores favored the second question. Juniors and
seniors gave a resounding "No" vote on both
questions.
