Objectionable Piece of Writing
Editor, The Daily:
Friday's editorial concerning Memorial Church
was the most objectionable piece of writing we
have seen in this paper. It was a combination of
'• ry thought and poor taste.
*V<? : o r.ot mind your expressing the opinion
1 'he building, Stanford's leading tourist at
i eminds one of a higher purpose of exist
?n if it reminds us of something quite
• V. But then you support this opinion by
lg, "The fact that our universe is planned
oui to all who open their eyes." And THIS
nv. in the newspaper of what is said to be an
v, ituiion of higher learning! It is not the asser
' on's incorrectness which disturbs us, but its in
tellectual immaturity.
Memorial Church is next claimed to be "an im
pressive symbol of non-sectarian religious unity."
This i3 simply religious provincialism. The unity
to which you refer is Christian Protestant "unity"
—which is not unity in any sense.
"But we at Stanford," you say, contrasting us
with public universities, "are free to admit the
existence of our Creator." Are those at public
universities not free to do so? This is an interest
ing accusation of unconstitutional suppression of
freedom, but we suspect that one cannot assume
that you would agree with the implications of
your own statement. That one cannot so assume
is evidence of the complete lack of careful
thought in the editorial.
The editorial column is for the expression of
thoughts by those who have something to say,
and NOT for a display of the failure of a univer
sity education to teach one person how to think.

Editor's Note: We welcome opinions from
our readers, whether they he in praise of or
opposed to our point of view. Both letters to
the editor and editorials reflect opinion. We
might add that it is subjective with those read
ing editorials and letters whether the writer
had "something' to say." We have thought some
letters didn't have much to say—but stJll we
published them. Although you may disagree
with an editorial, we maintain our right to
print it, just as you have a right to send us
letters In disagreement.
Extremely Poor Value
Editor, The Daily:
Oh, come on now! It is not obvious to all who
open their eyes that the universe was planned.
Memorial Church is not "an impressive symbol
of non-sectarian religious unity"; it is Episco

palian in both ceremony and membership. It does
not make us more free "to admit the existence of
our Creator" because we have a church on cam
pus instead of in Palo Alto.
Despite yourself, you said one true thing. You
said it was perhaps symbolic the way the church
rose .from the destruction of the earthquake. I
agree! And the most symbolic Ihing is that seven
million dollars was spent on its reconstruction,
ten million on the remainder of the University,
so that today we have the most ornate church in
the West; a library fit for Menlo J.C.; the lowest
paid instructors of any university in our stand
ing; a Bookstore so inadequate that some classes
now deal exclusively with independent book
stores; course cancellations due to lack of funds;
ad nauseam.
Seven million dollars at a conservative 4 per
cent would total $280,000 yearly, a sum of $14,-
280,000 since 1906. Perhaps, though, you had a
different kind of symbolism in mind when you
entitled the editorial "Symbol of Values." We
have gotten extremely poor value from this
symbol.

Masterpiece of Subtle Wit
Editor, The Daily:
The last sentence of Friday's editorial was a
masterpiece of subtle if unintentional wit. In
advertently, however, it was preceded by some
rather presumptuous, though incorrect, remarks.
You have often defended your right to main
tain opinions not necessarily reflecting those of
the student body—a right with which we agree.
However, this is not a license for sloppy thinking
or immature approach. Need we inform you that
many of the world's most eminent thinkers have
NOT found evidence for a planned universe mere
ly by opening their eyes?
Concerning the symbolic properties of Memo
rial Church, we would like to inquire as to how
many Stanford students walk by it each day and
exclaim: "Aha! There IS a purpose beyond just
day-to-day existence!"
In alluding to the restrictions in public univer
sities, you have overlooked a fundamental prin
ciple of American democracy the separation of
church and state. The ironic fact is that this
false nonsectarianism of Stanford's nonsectarian
PROTESTANT church is used as a justification
for prohibiting Jewish, Catholic, Islamic, or any
other religious group from meeting on campus
for any purpose connected with religion. This is
called "insuring that Memorial Church will lie
the center of Stanford religious life." Such a situ
ation is not to be found on the campuses of public
universities, and rightly so.
