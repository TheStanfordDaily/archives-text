# The 						Daily Probes Abuses In Stanford's Judicial Setup

Editor's Nob*: This is the first of two articles dealing" with the
fairness of student justice. Today's article discusses alleged abuses
in Hie present system.

"The legal rules of evidence, as applied in courts of law, shall
have no application to matters before this Council."
So say the rules of procedure of Men's Council.
Stanford's judicial councils do not operate under the usual con
stitutional and legal guarantees of courtroom procedure. The councils
consider themselves investigative bodies, rather than courts.
The Judicial Council, which tries Honor Code violations, operates
somewhat like a grand jury. Its hearings are secret; it admits hear
say evidence; it permits the retrial of those judged innocent; it does
not allow the accused to know exactly what his accusers have said
against him. He does not even know who his accusers are.
With such a system -which goes against the grain ot centuries of
Anglo-Saxon legal tradition and even violates the U.S. Constitution—
it is little wonder that many have complained bitterly against the
apparent unfairness of student justice.
Council members answer that theirs is an investigative role and
should not therefore be limited by usual court procedures. However,
investigative bodies do not decide guilt or innocence, nor do they
hand out penalties.
And Judicial Council penalties are serious enough. On one occa
sion the council suspended an ROTC student, causing him to lose his
commission, his tuition and room-and-board money for the quarter,
and, perhaps more important, his self-respect.
Even if one could be positive that all council decisions are just
and the council itself is often divided—the situation could still be
dangerous. Unless judicial procedures are as safe as possible, the
fact that a past judicial group has done a "good job" does not remove
the possibility that the innocent may be found guilty in the future.

The Constitution Ignored

One legal principle, deemed since the days of the Magna Charta
as one of the most sacred bulwarks of liberty under the common law,
is the right of an accused to be confronted by witnesses against him.
This principle is included in the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Con
stitution. which provides, among other things, that the accused shall
have the right to a speedy public trial, to be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation, and to be confronted with the witnesses
against him (see the Letter to the Editor, page 1, for relevant com
ments on an Honor Code case).
The Men's Council procedural code states that the defendant must
have the right to cross-examine witnesses. But the council ignores
this, as it does many other clauses in the code. According to the
ASSU constitution, the judicial councils make their own procedures,
subject to approval by the Legislature. The Men's Council code of
procedure is not dated, and no one knows when, if ever, it was ap
proved by a Legislature.
Women's and Judicial Councils apparently operate with no written
codes of procedure at all.
The Judicial Council prevents the accused from cross-examining
witnesses by keeping them from testifying in each other's presence.
The witness testifies or a statement by him is read to the council.
He leaves; the accused enters, and is told approximately of the
charges against him. The accused then testifies, leaves, and the
council reaches a verdict and, if necessary, decides on a penalty.
The defendant has no guarantees that the council has told him
everything the witness said - he may be convicted on evidence lie
doesn't even know exists.
Administration opinion is divided as to whether students should
face their accusers. Dean of Men William Craig, who reviews all
Men's Council cases, told The Daily: "I can't see any way that it
would hurt to have the accused face the accuscr."
Identification Fears
Craig noted that in Honor Code cases the witness is supposed to
discuss the violation with the violator, before turning the latter in,
in an attempt to get the violator to report himself. If all accusers and
witnesses did this, it wouldn't make much difference if they faced
each other in a hearing or not, as far as the witnesses' fears of iden
tification are concerned.
Dean of students 11. Donald Winbigler believes that the number
of violations reported to the councils would drop considerably if the
witness knew he would face the defendant in the hearing. He strongly
opposes permitting the defendant to hear firsthand the evidence
against him.
Gordon Tinker, chairman of Men's Council, agrees with Winbigler
on this issue.
Another time-honored principle of English common law, incorpo
rated in the U.S. Constitution and ignored by Stanford judicial coun
cils. is the notion that a person may not be tried and acquitted and
then retried on the same charge.
At Stanford, placing a student in "double jeopardy" is completely

acceptable, according to Tinker:
"Now evidence is always grounds
for retrial, regardless of the out
come of the first trial." On sev
eral occasions students have been
acquitted of an offense and then,
as many as two or three months
later, have been retried and found
guilty.
Whether or not the "no double
jeopardy" principle should be ap
plied to Stanford student justice,
it has been argued that if normal
legal procedures for the gather
ing of evidence and cross-exami
nation of witnesses were used in
council hearings, the necessity
for a retrial would disappear
since all pertinent evidence
would more than likely have been
presented at the original trial.
But attack*-- on and defenses of
the present . stem are not baser
on ihe morality or advisability of
the various Anglo-Saxon concepts
per se, hut on inherent differ
eneos between the character of
Stanford law enforcement and
that of the "outside world."

WOMEN'S COUNCIL IN ACTION
Myrna Kelley, Mary Mettler, I'hyllis Turner, Sally Ilandall,

Editor's Nob*: This is the first of two articles dealing" with the
fairness of student justice. Today's article discusses alleged abuses
in Hie present system.

"The legal rules of evidence, as applied in courts of law, shall
have no application to matters before this Council."
So say the rules of procedure of Men's Council.
Stanford's judicial councils do not operate under the usual con
stitutional and legal guarantees of courtroom procedure. The councils
consider themselves investigative bodies, rather than courts.
The Judicial Council, which tries Honor Code violations, operates
somewhat like a grand jury. Its hearings are secret; it admits hear
say evidence; it permits the retrial of those judged innocent; it does
not allow the accused to know exactly what his accusers have said
against him. He does not even know who his accusers are.
With such a system -which goes against the grain ot centuries of
Anglo-Saxon legal tradition and even violates the U.S. Constitution—
it is little wonder that many have complained bitterly against the
apparent unfairness of student justice.
Council members answer that theirs is an investigative role and
should not therefore be limited by usual court procedures. However,
investigative bodies do not decide guilt or innocence, nor do they
hand out penalties.
And Judicial Council penalties are serious enough. On one occa
sion the council suspended an ROTC student, causing him to lose his
commission, his tuition and room-and-board money for the quarter,
and, perhaps more important, his self-respect.
Even if one could be positive that all council decisions are just
and the council itself is often divided—the situation could still be
dangerous. Unless judicial procedures are as safe as possible, the
fact that a past judicial group has done a "good job" does not remove
the possibility that the innocent may be found guilty in the future.

The Constitution Ignored

One legal principle, deemed since the days of the Magna Charta
as one of the most sacred bulwarks of liberty under the common law,
is the right of an accused to be confronted by witnesses against him.
This principle is included in the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Con
stitution. which provides, among other things, that the accused shall
have the right to a speedy public trial, to be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation, and to be confronted with the witnesses
against him (see the Letter to the Editor, page 1, for relevant com
ments on an Honor Code case).
The Men's Council procedural code states that the defendant must
have the right to cross-examine witnesses. But the council ignores
this, as it does many other clauses in the code. According to the
ASSU constitution, the judicial councils make their own procedures,
subject to approval by the Legislature. The Men's Council code of
procedure is not dated, and no one knows when, if ever, it was ap
proved by a Legislature.
Women's and Judicial Councils apparently operate with no written
codes of procedure at all.
The Judicial Council prevents the accused from cross-examining
witnesses by keeping them from testifying in each other's presence.
The witness testifies or a statement by him is read to the council.
He leaves; the accused enters, and is told approximately of the
charges against him. The accused then testifies, leaves, and the
council reaches a verdict and, if necessary, decides on a penalty.
The defendant has no guarantees that the council has told him
everything the witness said - he may be convicted on evidence lie
doesn't even know exists.
Administration opinion is divided as to whether students should
face their accusers. Dean of Men William Craig, who reviews all
Men's Council cases, told The Daily: "I can't see any way that it
would hurt to have the accused face the accuscr."
Identification Fears
Craig noted that in Honor Code cases the witness is supposed to
discuss the violation with the violator, before turning the latter in,
in an attempt to get the violator to report himself. If all accusers and

fact that a past judicial group has done a "good job" does not remove
the possibility that the innocent may be found guilty in the future.

The Constitution Ignored

One legal principle, deemed since the days of the Magna Charta
as one of the most sacred bulwarks of liberty under the common law,
is the right of an accused to be confronted by witnesses against him.
This principle is included in the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Con
stitution. which provides, among other things, that the accused shall
have the right to a speedy public trial, to be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation, and to be confronted with the witnesses
against him (see the Letter to the Editor, page 1, for relevant com
ments on an Honor Code case).
The Men's Council procedural code states that the defendant must
have the right to cross-examine witnesses. But the council ignores
this, as it does many other clauses in the code. According to the
ASSU constitution, the judicial councils make their own procedures,
subject to approval by the Legislature. The Men's Council code of
procedure is not dated, and no one knows when, if ever, it was ap
proved by a Legislature.
Women's and Judicial Councils apparently operate with no written
codes of procedure at all.
The Judicial Council prevents the accused from cross-examining
witnesses by keeping them from testifying in each other's presence.
The witness testifies or a statement by him is read to the council.
He leaves; the accused enters, and is told approximately of the
charges against him. The accused then testifies, leaves, and the
council reaches a verdict and, if necessary, decides on a penalty.
The defendant has no guarantees that the council has told him
everything the witness said - he may be convicted on evidence lie
doesn't even know exists.
Administration opinion is divided as to whether students should
face their accusers. Dean of Men William Craig, who reviews all
Men's Council cases, told The Daily: "I can't see any way that it
would hurt to have the accused face the accuscr."
Identification Fears
Craig noted that in Honor Code cases the witness is supposed to
discuss the violation with the violator, before turning the latter in,
in an attempt to get the violator to report himself. If all accusers and
witnesses did this, it wouldn't make much difference if they faced
each other in a hearing or not, as far as the witnesses' fears of iden
tification are concerned.
Dean of students 11. Donald Winbigler believes that the number
of violations reported to the councils would drop considerably if the
witness knew he would face the defendant in the hearing. He strongly
opposes permitting the defendant to hear firsthand the evidence
against him.
Gordon Tinker, chairman of Men's Council, agrees with Winbigler
on this issue.
Another time-honored principle of English common law, incorpo
rated in the U.S. Constitution and ignored by Stanford judicial coun
cils. is the notion that a person may not be tried and acquitted and
then retried on the same charge.
At Stanford, placing a student in "double jeopardy" is completely

acceptable, according to Tinker:
"Now evidence is always grounds
for retrial, regardless of the out
come of the first trial." On sev
eral occasions students have been
acquitted of an offense and then,
as many as two or three months
later, have been retried and found
guilty.
Whether or not the "no double
jeopardy" principle should be ap
plied to Stanford student justice,
it has been argued that if normal
legal procedures for the gather
ing of evidence and cross-exami
nation of witnesses were used in
council hearings, the necessity
for a retrial would disappear
since all pertinent evidence
would more than likely have been
presented at the original trial.

So say the rules of procedure of Men's Council.
Stanford's judicial councils do not operate under the usual con
stitutional and legal guarantees of courtroom procedure. The councils
consider themselves investigative bodies, rather than courts.
The Judicial Council, which tries Honor Code violations, operates
somewhat like a grand jury. Its hearings are secret; it admits hear
say evidence; it permits the retrial of those judged innocent; it does
not allow the accused to know exactly what his accusers have said
against him. He does not even know who his accusers are.
With such a system -which goes against the grain ot centuries of
Anglo-Saxon legal tradition and even violates the U.S. Constitution—
it is little wonder that many have complained bitterly against the
apparent unfairness of student justice.
Council members answer that theirs is an investigative role and
should not therefore be limited by usual court procedures. However,
investigative bodies do not decide guilt or innocence, nor do they
hand out penalties.
And Judicial Council penalties are serious enough. On one occa
sion the council suspended an ROTC student, causing him to lose his
commission, his tuition and room-and-board money for the quarter,
and, perhaps more important, his self-respect.
Even if one could be positive that all council decisions are just
