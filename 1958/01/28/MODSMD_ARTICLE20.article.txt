## Debate Teams Seek Laurels Despite Trials 
### Sutter Gardanier 
Consistently losing luggage,
running into influenza epidemics,
or having colleagues find they
have collapsed lungs just before
the big event are typical of the ex
periences of the debate team, one
of ihe unheralded groups on the
campus.
The Stanford debate team is
under the direction of the Speech
Association with Nancy Snookal,
association's president, and Dan
Kremer, debate captain.
"Here on the campus the team
is broken up into 17 two-man de
bating teams," said Mike Willem
sen, publicity chairman, explain
ing its organization here on cam
pus. "Each team is ranked from
1 to 17, positions being determin
ed by challenge debates, inter
squad tournaments and the mem
bers' showing at intercollegiate
debates. Stanford has a go o d
team, having won about 70 per
cent of its debates."
Three at Once
The members of the debate
team are preparing for three al
most simultaneous events a
Portland town meeting for indi
vidual speakers, plus one at Stock
ton for lower division debate
teams and one at College of the
Pacific for upper division teams.
Stanford's schedule includes 45
colleges, the farthest away being
Cambridge. The team has been
invited to Harvard, which they
had to turn down because of lack
of funds.
Willemsen explained: "In April
there is the debate contest for Ari
zona, California, Utah and Ne
vada in which three teams will be
chosen to represent this part of
the country in the national cham
pionships at West Point.
"This year Ihe national topic is
right-to-work laws. Every contest
which Stanford debale teams are
in will be over these laws, except
for a few special debates. The de
baters must have a good knowl
edge of the subject, because they
usually don't know whether they
will take the affirmative or the
negalive side of the question until
just before the tournament."
Judges for the intercollegiate
tournaments are usually speech
instructors from a third college
or a member of the faculty of the
school sponsoring the event.
SU Winners
Last term in the western states
tournament at Pepperdine College
in Los Angeles, in which 60 col
leges participated, Stanford had

nalist in lower division oratory.
Jack Rolls won the lower division
oratory contest and was a finalist
in extemporaneous speaking.

present time consists of Hal (bif
