A few minutes of time should pay plenty of dividends this after
noon if you use this time to go and listen to Jack Curtice in Cubbor
ley Auditorium at 1:15. The man l'rom Kentucky, by way of Utah,
will be paying his first visit to Stanford since being named head foot
ball coach here, and will spend part of his brief stay in saying a few
words t<> the student body.
Some football coaches refuse to say anything; others can't do
much on the platform. Happily for Stanford, Curtice fits neither
<> 1 these descriptions. He's in constant demand on the banquet cir
cuit, and he's well known for his Kentucky philosophy and sense of
humor.
Hon I„iel>endorfer says that Curtice can go on for hours and hours
with his backlog of yarns and talcs. Stanford's athletic publicity
director and the new coach were in the Navy together during World
Win' II, so Liehendorfer had plenty of chances to hear all the stories, j
This afternoon's program won't go on for hours or anything like
inat. It'll be brief, informal and designed with the intention of in
terested Stanford fans getting a personal look at the new leader of
football on the Farm.
Everyone on iho Stanford athletic scene is anticipating a good
turnout this afternoon to help Curtice off to a good start in what is
hoped will be ;i long and successful stay at Stanford. Virtually every
one I've talked to is very well pleased that Stanford secured the
services of Curtice. Let's show him we're with him from the start. |
IN •os al Stanford? A Good Question
Rumors have begun to circulate around the Bay Area again about
the possibility of the 49ers playing in Stanford Stadium. Both sides
denied that they had talked about negotiations for this. Still, the;
rumor in itself brings up a question with many pros and cons.
From a purely selfish standpoint, I'd love to see the 49ers play in I
Stanford Stadium. What would I have to lose, except maybe three
hours of studying on Sundays? I think it'd be great to go to Stan-1
ford games on Saturday and pro games on Sunday, and a lot of'
people I've talked to agree with this.
But to move away from the personal interests, let's see what
some of the arguments from the University standpoint and from the
4tiers angle might be.
The big objection from some quarters would be that there should
riot be professional athletic events taking place on Stanford grounds, j
There seems to be a sort of tradition against pros on campus, but
then on the other hand, how much more professional are the 49ers I
than some of the opponents Stanford meets?
There's a financial problem which also bears consideration. It'sj
generally agreed that some people who come to Stanford games
come merely because it's the most convenient game to attend, yet
is still good football. If the 49ers also played here, a portion of this
group would probably go to the pro games and not come on Satur
days. Thus, Stanford income decreases. To counteract this the Uni
versity would be receiving rent from the 49ers, and it is probable that
total income would be higher than present income received from
Stanford games alone. The added income, however, does not take
into account the loss of prestige brought on by decreased attendance
at Stanford games, nor the tax laws.
From I he 49ers standpoint, Stanford Stadium would offer 31,000
more seats than they now have at Ke/ar—and judging by the last
four games of the 1957 season, these 31,000 spots could have been
filled with ease. There are lots of parking places here, too, a far
different situation from that at Kezar. One disadvantage, though
Stanford is more than 30 miles south of San Francisco, and some
of the hard-core fandom in the city might object to the long trek, j
and show thir objections by not coming.
There are lots more sides to the question than those mentioned,
but these yive an idea of what must be considered if the University i
and 49ers ever do negotiate. Personally, again, I hope the pros play |
hero eventually.

IN •os al Stanford? A Good Question
Rumors have begun to circulate around the Bay Area again about
the possibility of the 49ers playing in Stanford Stadium. Both sides
denied that they had talked about negotiations for this. Still, the;
rumor in itself brings up a question with many pros and cons.
From a purely selfish standpoint, I'd love to see the 49ers play in I
Stanford Stadium. What would I have to lose, except maybe three
hours of studying on Sundays? I think it'd be great to go to Stan-1
ford games on Saturday and pro games on Sunday, and a lot of'
people I've talked to agree with this.
But to move away from the personal interests, let's see what
some of the arguments from the University standpoint and from the
4tiers angle might be.
The big objection from some quarters would be that there should
riot be professional athletic events taking place on Stanford grounds, j
There seems to be a sort of tradition against pros on campus, but
then on the other hand, how much more professional are the 49ers I
than some of the opponents Stanford meets?
There's a financial problem which also bears consideration. It'sj
generally agreed that some people who come to Stanford games
come merely because it's the most convenient game to attend, yet
is still good football. If the 49ers also played here, a portion of this
group would probably go to the pro games and not come on Satur
days. Thus, Stanford income decreases. To counteract this the Uni
versity would be receiving rent from the 49ers, and it is probable that
total income would be higher than present income received from
Stanford games alone. The added income, however, does not take
into account the loss of prestige brought on by decreased attendance
at Stanford games, nor the tax laws.
From I he 49ers standpoint, Stanford Stadium would offer 31,000
more seats than they now have at Ke/ar—and judging by the last
four games of the 1957 season, these 31,000 spots could have been
filled with ease. There are lots of parking places here, too, a far
different situation from that at Kezar. One disadvantage, though
Stanford is more than 30 miles south of San Francisco, and some
of the hard-core fandom in the city might object to the long trek, j
and show thir objections by not coming.
There are lots more sides to the question than those mentioned,
but these yive an idea of what must be considered if the University i
and 49ers ever do negotiate. Personally, again, I hope the pros play |

lion to Invest l ime Wisely
A few minutes of time should pay plenty of dividends this after
noon if you use this time to go and listen to Jack Curtice in Cubbor
ley Auditorium at 1:15. The man l'rom Kentucky, by way of Utah,
will be paying his first visit to Stanford since being named head foot
ball coach here, and will spend part of his brief stay in saying a few
words t<> the student body.
Some football coaches refuse to say anything; others can't do
much on the platform. Happily for Stanford, Curtice fits neither
<> 1 these descriptions. He's in constant demand on the banquet cir
cuit, and he's well known for his Kentucky philosophy and sense of
humor.
Hon I„iel>endorfer says that Curtice can go on for hours and hours
with his backlog of yarns and talcs. Stanford's athletic publicity
director and the new coach were in the Navy together during World
Win' II, so Liehendorfer had plenty of chances to hear all the stories, j
This afternoon's program won't go on for hours or anything like
inat. It'll be brief, informal and designed with the intention of in
terested Stanford fans getting a personal look at the new leader of
football on the Farm.
Everyone on iho Stanford athletic scene is anticipating a good
turnout this afternoon to help Curtice off to a good start in what is
hoped will be ;i long and successful stay at Stanford. Virtually every
one I've talked to is very well pleased that Stanford secured the
services of Curtice. Let's show him we're with him from the start. |
IN •os al Stanford? A Good Question
Rumors have begun to circulate around the Bay Area again about
the possibility of the 49ers playing in Stanford Stadium. Both sides
denied that they had talked about negotiations for this. Still, the;
rumor in itself brings up a question with many pros and cons.
From a purely selfish standpoint, I'd love to see the 49ers play in I
Stanford Stadium. What would I have to lose, except maybe three
hours of studying on Sundays? I think it'd be great to go to Stan-1
ford games on Saturday and pro games on Sunday, and a lot of'
people I've talked to agree with this.
But to move away from the personal interests, let's see what
some of the arguments from the University standpoint and from the
4tiers angle might be.
The big objection from some quarters would be that there should
riot be professional athletic events taking place on Stanford grounds, j
There seems to be a sort of tradition against pros on campus, but
then on the other hand, how much more professional are the 49ers I
than some of the opponents Stanford meets?
There's a financial problem which also bears consideration. It'sj
generally agreed that some people who come to Stanford games
come merely because it's the most convenient game to attend, yet
is still good football. If the 49ers also played here, a portion of this
group would probably go to the pro games and not come on Satur
days. Thus, Stanford income decreases. To counteract this the Uni
versity would be receiving rent from the 49ers, and it is probable that
total income would be higher than present income received from
Stanford games alone. The added income, however, does not take
into account the loss of prestige brought on by decreased attendance
at Stanford games, nor the tax laws.
From I he 49ers standpoint, Stanford Stadium would offer 31,000
more seats than they now have at Ke/ar—and judging by the last
four games of the 1957 season, these 31,000 spots could have been
filled with ease. There are lots of parking places here, too, a far
different situation from that at Kezar. One disadvantage, though
Stanford is more than 30 miles south of San Francisco, and some
of the hard-core fandom in the city might object to the long trek, j
and show thir objections by not coming.
There are lots more sides to the question than those mentioned,
but these yive an idea of what must be considered if the University i
and 49ers ever do negotiate. Personally, again, I hope the pros play |
hero eventually.
