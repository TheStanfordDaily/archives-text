### Lyle Sachs 
A relatively small AKL team,
sparked by the play of center Bill
Lawrence, edged out Theta Chi
last week by the slim margin of
27-25. AKL, with Burt Kufus, Bill
Corbus, Ed Bordenkircher and
Jack Abbott rounding out the
team, gained the lead from the
very first and maintained it all
the way. Lawrence was high-point
man for the winners with 11. Bor
denkircher followed with 8, and
guard Chuck I nee of Theta Chi
hit for 7.
The DU I ping-pong team beat |
Breakers II in the first round of
the tournament. Bob Wallace and
Roger Smith played the singles
matches, and Ben Dorman and
Steve Halsted combined to play
the doubles.
