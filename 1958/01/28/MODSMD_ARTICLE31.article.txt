athlete, having been a regular
on the 1956 and 1957 football
learns and a letterman in bas
ketball Ihc same years. He has
been counted on because of his
experience but an injury in ihe
East - West fool ball game has
hindered his playing. It is
doubtful if he will see action.

Weersing (No. 53, 185 lbs.,
G-4 1 â€¢>, 18 - year - old sophomore

worker with plenty of desire.
Needs lots of experience, which
he may get with the Braves this
season. Eventually, he should
be a strong man off the boards.
He is not a great scorer, but his
marksmanship is improving.
Probably a year away as far as
varsity competition goes. Ma
jor: mechanical engineering.
