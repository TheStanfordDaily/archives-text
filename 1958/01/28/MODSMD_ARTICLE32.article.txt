# CAGERS READY FOR ROAD
## Starting Berths Up for Grabs 
### John Schwarz 
The Stanford cagers began regulai workouts again yesterday after
a lay-off of almost a week.
The highlight of the week's opening practice was the intense com
petition for starting spots for this weekend's games against Oregon
State, Washington and the University of Oregon.
Almost all the positions on |

the starting five are up for grabs.
Howie Dallmar, who is still doing
a lot of experimenting with the
many juniors and sophomores on
the squad, has left his final deci
sion of starters up to the results
of this week's drills.
It is conceivable that practi
cally any member of the 14-man
; traveling squad could get a start
j ing nod if he looked impressive
i enough in this week's practice
j sessions.
A great many of the players
have looked very good in streaks
, this year, but so far there has
; been very little c on si s t en c y
I among the eight or ten shifting
t regulars.
This inconsistency of play
along with many defeats of late
has caused Coach Dallmar to
| keep trying new combinations
and new players. P erh ap s
through this shifting he can
i come up with a winning combi
nation this weekend.
Top Scorers
Certain starting positions
might depend a great deal on de
fensive skills for this weekend
Stanford will see three of the
conference's leading scorers.
At Washington they will meet
up with Doug Smart, currently
the league's number two scorer.
At Oregon State is Dave Gambee,
defending PCC scoring champ
and number three in the race so
I far this season.
On Monday night at Oregon
the Cards will have to reckon
with Charlie Franklin who put in
35 points in one game just last
weekend.
All Are Well
As of this moment all the play
ers on the traveling squad are in
J good health and will travel.
If the many young and inex
j perienced Indians begin to de
; velop into their potentials, Stan
! ford might very well become the
spoiler of the league. After this
weekend the Cards have two
games left with UCLA, one with
I Cal and one with Idaho.
