# Stanford Oarsmen Start Drills; Outlook Up for Varsity, Frosh
## 
### 
Stanford varsity and freshman
crews opened spirited winter quar
ter drills last Wednesday after
noon in Redwood City Harbor.
Varsity coach Lou Lindsey and
freshman mentor Phil Waters
were both pleased with the turn
out and size of their squads.
Lindsey commented: "The spir
it of the varsity oarsmen on the
water this week indicates that
they may have a good chance to
capture the Pacific Coast rowing
championship and place high in
the Intercollegiate Rowing Regat
ta at Syracuse, New York."

Waters is looking to a very
strong freshman team, with more
height and power than in previous
years.
Varsity boatings will be chosen
shortly by coach Lindsey, who
hopes to be able to retain the
same units throughout the season.
This should result in better tim
ing and teamwork than in the past
where changes were made up to
a week before a race.
The varsity has scheduled races
with California, Washington, Or
egon State, IJSC, UCLA, Wiscon
sin and the University of British
Columbia.
