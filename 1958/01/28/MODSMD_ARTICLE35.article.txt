### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P)- Califor
nia basketball coach Pete Newell,
whose Bears are tied for the Pa
cific Coast Conference lead, said
yesterday the title race can't he
judged until after Feb. 8 at the
earliest.
California meets UCLA and
USC on Feb. 7 and 8, respectively.
The Uclans are tied with the Bears
at 5-1 in the conference race.
"And don't overlook Idaho,"
Newell warned the Northern Cali
fornia Basketball Writers and
Broadcasters Assn. "They beat
USC down south and gave UCLA
a real battle even without their
good sophomore John Liveious."
California hasn't practiced since
beating Oregon State 10 days ago,
but returns to the hardwood to
morrow to prepare for a game
against Santa Clara at Berkeley
Saturday afternoon.
The writers chose Bob Larson,

a 6-5 forward from San Jose State,
as the player of the week after
he turned in a ;;reat showing
against Fresno Sift.e last Tues
day, when he scored 19 points and
grabbed 20 rebounds. San Jose
won, 68-58.
USF coach Phil Woolpert re
ported that St. Mary's had turned
down a proposal to move their
two games with the Dons to the
Cow Palace.
USF is now 3-0 in the West
Coast Athletic Conference and St,
Mary's is 2-0. Their meetings on
Feb. 11 and 25 will just about
decide the championship.
"Jim Weaver |St. Mary's coach]
said that because the Gaels had
only seven games in their own
gym." Woolpert explained, "he did
not think it fair to move another
game from the campus, which is
understandable. So we'll keep our
home game at Ke/.ar Pavilion."
