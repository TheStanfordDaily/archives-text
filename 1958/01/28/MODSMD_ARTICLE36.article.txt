A SCHOOL AWAY FROM SCHOOL
Students majoring in science, like all other American
students, have a wild yearning for culture, hut, alas,
when a student is after a degree in engineering or math
or like that, he simply floes not have time to take all (he
liberal arts courses his heart pines for.
And what is being done about, this unhappy situation?
I'll tell you what: Enlightened corporations everywhere
are setting up on-the-job liberal arts programs tor the
newly employed science graduate—courses designed to
broaden his cultural base —for the enlightened corpora

valuable employee.
Take, for example, Lambswool Sigafoos.
A week after his graduation, Lambswool reported to
Mr. Femur, the personnel director of an enlightened cor
poration engaged in the manufacture of cotter pins and
wing nuts. "How do you do?" said Lambswool. "1 m
Lambswool Sigafoos and I've come to work."
"Sit down," said Mr. Femur, chuckling kindly. "Have
a Marlboro."
"Thank you," said Lambswool. "1 like Marlboros.
1 like their filter and their flavor."
"Me too," said Mr. l emur, blinking humanely. "And I
like their Hip-top box. When ray flip-top box of Marlboros
is empty, 1 use it to keep fish hooks in."
"Know what I do when my flip-top box of Marlboros
in empty?" asked Lambswool.
"What?" said Mr. Femur, sniggering graciously.
"1 buy some more Marlboros," said Lambswool.
"A sound idea," said Mr. Femur, vibrating fetchingly.
"But enough chit-chat. Come along to the campus."
"Campus?" said Lambswool, puzzled. "But I ve come
to work. Take me to my drawing board."
"This is an enlightened corporation," said Mr. l emur,
yodelling viciously. "First you must get your cultural
base broadened."
Mr. Femur took Lambswool to the training campus,
which looked like any other campus. 11 had ivy-covered
buildings, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, a
stadium, a deer park, and a moat. Lambswool was given

From these fundamentals, Lambswool progressed slowly

end they were rewarded, for when Lambswool finished,
he could plav a clavier, compose a triolet, parse a sentence,
and identify the birthstone for every month of the year.
His lengthy schooling finally over, Lambswool was
assigned to an important executive position where he
served with immense distinction. . . . Not, however, for
long, because one week later he reached retirement age.
Today, still spry, he lives in St. Petersburg, Florida,
where he supplements his jiension by parsing sentences
