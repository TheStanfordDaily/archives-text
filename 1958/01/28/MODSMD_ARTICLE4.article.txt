# Frosh PJ Dance Scheduled Feb. 15
## 
### 
One of the first chances that
freshmen will have to use their
new class cards will be the Fresh
man Class Pajama Dance on Feb.
15. Admission to the party will
be free to all freshman class card
holders. The party is being held
in place of the Wilbur dance
originally scheduled for Feb. 20.
Class cards will entitle the
holders to reductions in the
prices of many other class of '61
functions both this year and in
the next three years, events such
as their Sophomore Cotillion,
Junior Prom and Senior Ball.
Freshman class cards are still
on sale in the dormitories and
will be sold at the Civ lecture on
Monday Members of the Fresh
man Excom are selling cards also.
