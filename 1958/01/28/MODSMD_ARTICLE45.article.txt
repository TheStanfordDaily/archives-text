# STUDENTS SUPPORT
## Ski Team Hopes Rocket 
### Morrie Hodges 
Endless slopes of white and a
crisp winter air send feelings of
exhilaration through would-be or
expert skiers alike and the Ski
Club seeks to direct the enthu
siasm of snow-bunnies toward its
annual winter outings.
Major function of the Ski Club
is to support the ski teams. At a
recent Excom meeting, team cap
tain Bart Hooley, his leg injured
on a ski trip disabling him for
Ihe rest of the season, said he
was confident "that the men's
team has better material and en
thusiasm and will undoubtedly
make a better showing than it
did last year."
Hooley's optimism is centered
on three varsity returning mem
bers of the team and freshman
Roger Crist, who was rated 10th
in national junior competition
last year.
Up to eight men compete on

, the team in four events â€”jump-
I ing, cross-country, slalom and
| downhill. The best three out of
four entries in each of the events
are counted in the meets, which
last three or four days.
The average member of Hoo
leys' team has had about 10 years
of skiing experience with two or
three years in competition. The
members also train down here
three days a week doing exer
cises to develop technique for
jumping and cross-country, and
to develop suppleness for down
hill and slalom racing.
Margi Meyer is captain of the
women's team. Women's team
members were modeling the new,
matching black parkas with
striped Ivy League lining they
have made.
Team members are expecting
the women to "place above all
competition," according to Hoo
i ley. At a recent meet at Dormer

Ski Ranch, the women took first,
second and third places.
Three freshman women skiers
contribute to the high regard for
the women's team also. Jeri Vix
skied in the nationals three times
as a junior, and last year placed
10th in combined and downhill
skiing. She holds the title of the
second top girl skier in California
and Nevada.
Sheila Mac Donald was in the
junior nationals last year, and
has placed first in several tourna
ments. As a member of the Cas
cade Ski Club, she was coached
by Pepi Gabl, the coach of the
American team of the F. 1.5., an
international federation of skiers.
With the Cascade team, she
toured the country entering ski
meets.
Sherry Tettemer is the third
outstanding new team member,
and she too has placed in divi
sional and state meets.
