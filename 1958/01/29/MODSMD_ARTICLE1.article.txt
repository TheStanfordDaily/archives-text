# The 						Critics Answered: Why Student Justice is Fair
## Winbigler Gives Present Judicial System Approval 
### Roger Folsom Stew Toy 
■Editor's Note;: This is the last of hvo articles dealing with Ilu*
fairness of student justice. Ia today's article the present University
judicial system is defended.

"The test of a judicial system," says Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler, "is its effectiveness. And I am positive that, in the eight
years I have been at Stanford, no innocent student has been found
guilty by any of the student judicial councils."
What guarantees do students have that accusations of Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard violations will be judged fairly? Cer
tainly not the legal guarantees granted by the U.S. Constitution and
by courtroom procedure.
But Winbigler says "courtroom judicial processes and the legal
rules for gathering evidence should not and could not be used at
Stanford." He feels that student justice cannot be compared with
that of the rest of society. Stanford's situation as a close-knit group
makes its law-enforcement needs an unusual case.
Winbigler says the "integrity" of the students on the councils,
along with certain assumptions inherent in the philosophy of campus
justice, are tlie basis for its workability and fairness. Council mem
bers, conscious of their responsibility, go to "extremes" to assume
every defendant innocent.
This important assumption stems from a more basic one—that
Stanford students are honest and are of the highest moral character.
This, then, is the same assumption upon which the Fundamental
Standard itself is based. Its acceptance leads to another unique
feature of the campus legal system: the accuser is assumed to be
disinterested and therefore telling the truth. Thus one reason for
following courtroom procedures for gathering evidence and cross
examination of witnesses (to ascertain the truthfulness of witnesses)
is theoretically eliminated at Stanford.
In addition to these "moral guarantees," students accused of vio
lations are protected by certain more tangible guarantees. One of
these is the fact that all Honor Code and Fundamental Standard con
victions must be reviewed by the appropriate dean.
Since 1950, when Winbigler became dean of students, he has asked
Judicial Council to review its decisions five times. Three times the
council reaffirmed its original decision. Twice it changed its mind.
Another right of the defendant is to disqualify any council mem
ber from hearing his case—provided that the remaining council mem
bers vote to permit this. If the disqualification prevents a quorum,
the full council hears the case and the disqualification does not take
effoct. (A quorum consists of four of the five Men's or Women's
Council members and eight of the 10 Judicial Council members.)
The Judicial Councils operate in complete secrecy, except for re
ports in The Daily, which are censored by the council chairman with
an eye to eliminating detail which could identify either the defendant
or the witnesses.
No case is ever mentioned rfn official transcripts. When a student
is suspended from school, his

transcript merely indicates that
he left of his own accord. Some
times a defendant's parents arc
notified.
The innocent may feel his
interests would he protected by
an open trial that the Judicial
Councils would have to operate
fairly if their procedures and
decisions were subject to open
discussion by the student body.
But, in Winbigler's opinion,
secrecy "is in the best interests
of I he defendant." 1 112 guilty, after
he has paid his penalty the de

fendant need not worry that his mistake will follow him the rest of
his life. Winbiglcr assumes that secrecy will not injure the innocent,
because the innocent will be acquitted.
Dean of Men William Craig says he "can't see why the defendant
shouldn't be able to 'open the court.'" lie pointed out. however, that
few students would like to have their mistakes aired in public. He
agreed, with Winbigler, that secrecy is for the benefit of the de
fendant, not the witness.
C hairman Gordon linker of Men's Council is opposed to giving
the defendant the right if) a public trial. He said that if the defendant
could waive secrecy the number of cases reported to the councils
would drop sharply.
If Winbigler's "test of a judicial system" by its effectiveness is
valid, it would seem from the evidence that Stanford's present setup
assures that justice is served eventually in all cases.

A member of Legislature has
requested that all persons fried
by any student Judicial Council,
whether convicted or acquitted,
be present at a meeting tomor
row at 10:, SO a.m. in Durand
House to discuss possible
changes in the current proce
dure of Stanford's judicial sys

tainly not the legal guarantees granted by the U.S. Constitution and
by courtroom procedure.
But Winbigler says "courtroom judicial processes and the legal
rules for gathering evidence should not and could not be used at
Stanford." He feels that student justice cannot be compared with
that of the rest of society. Stanford's situation as a close-knit group
makes its law-enforcement needs an unusual case.
Winbigler says the "integrity" of the students on the councils,
along with certain assumptions inherent in the philosophy of campus
justice, are tlie basis for its workability and fairness. Council mem
bers, conscious of their responsibility, go to "extremes" to assume
every defendant innocent.
This important assumption stems from a more basic one—that
Stanford students are honest and are of the highest moral character.
This, then, is the same assumption upon which the Fundamental
Standard itself is based. Its acceptance leads to another unique
feature of the campus legal system: the accuser is assumed to be
disinterested and therefore telling the truth. Thus one reason for
following courtroom procedures for gathering evidence and cross
examination of witnesses (to ascertain the truthfulness of witnesses)
is theoretically eliminated at Stanford.
In addition to these "moral guarantees," students accused of vio
lations are protected by certain more tangible guarantees. One of
these is the fact that all Honor Code and Fundamental Standard con
victions must be reviewed by the appropriate dean.
Since 1950, when Winbigler became dean of students, he has asked
Judicial Council to review its decisions five times. Three times the
council reaffirmed its original decision. Twice it changed its mind.
Another right of the defendant is to disqualify any council mem
ber from hearing his case—provided that the remaining council mem
bers vote to permit this. If the disqualification prevents a quorum,
the full council hears the case and the disqualification does not take
effoct. (A quorum consists of four of the five Men's or Women's
Council members and eight of the 10 Judicial Council members.)
The Judicial Councils operate in complete secrecy, except for re
ports in The Daily, which are censored by the council chairman with
an eye to eliminating detail which could identify either the defendant
or the witnesses.
No case is ever mentioned rfn official transcripts. When a student
is suspended from school, his

transcript merely indicates that
he left of his own accord. Some
times a defendant's parents arc
notified.
The innocent may feel his
interests would he protected by
an open trial that the Judicial
Councils would have to operate
fairly if their procedures and
decisions were subject to open
discussion by the student body.
But, in Winbigler's opinion,
secrecy "is in the best interests
of I he defendant." 1 112 guilty, after
he has paid his penalty the de

fendant need not worry that his mistake will follow him the rest of

Dean of Men William Craig says he "can't see why the defendant
shouldn't be able to 'open the court.'" lie pointed out. however, that

fendant, not the witness.

Stanford students are honest and are of the highest moral character.
This, then, is the same assumption upon which the Fundamental
Standard itself is based. Its acceptance leads to another unique

disinterested and therefore telling the truth. Thus one reason for
following courtroom procedures for gathering evidence and cross
examination of witnesses (to ascertain the truthfulness of witnesses)

In addition to these "moral guarantees," students accused of vio

judicial system is defended.

"The test of a judicial system," says Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler, "is its effectiveness. And I am positive that, in the eight
years I have been at Stanford, no innocent student has been found
guilty by any of the student judicial councils."
What guarantees do students have that accusations of Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard violations will be judged fairly? Cer
tainly not the legal guarantees granted by the U.S. Constitution and
by courtroom procedure.
But Winbigler says "courtroom judicial processes and the legal
rules for gathering evidence should not and could not be used at
Stanford." He feels that student justice cannot be compared with
that of the rest of society. Stanford's situation as a close-knit group
makes its law-enforcement needs an unusual case.
