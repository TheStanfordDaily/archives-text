# Senate Committee Authorizes Extra Half Billion for Defense
## Appropriations Committee May OK Another 1½ Billion 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) One Senate committee voted to authorize an
extra $549 million for defense yesterday. Another one talked of rais
ing the $1,410,000,000 total in the emergency missile-defense money
bill.
Both measures have already passed the house. The speed with

which they are moving along of
fered a new demonstration of
Congressional willingness to
spend to meet challenges of the
space age.
The 549 millions in the author
ization are also included in the
larger money bill. Congress au
thorizes projects before actually
providing the money in separate
appropriations bills.
Major Items
Major items in the $549 million
bill, which was approved by the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, are:
• $29,670,000 for the semi-au
tomatic ground environment sys
tem SAGE, for electronic detec
tion of approaching aircraft and
mechanical brain guidance for
missiles.
• $189,000,000 for a ballistic
missiles detection system.
• $112,400,000 for ballistic mis
siles bases.
• $194,000,000 for dispersal of
Strategic Air Command bases.
When the bill left the House it
carried specific directions on
which SAC bases would be af
fected. The Senate committee
changed this to give the Defense
Department authority to review
the directions laid down in the
House bill.
Boosting 1 Appropriations
The talk of boosting the $1,410,-
000,000 missile-defense appropria
tion arose in the Senate Appro
priations Committee, where Sec
retary of Defense McElroy was a
witness yesterday.
McElroy reported the sugges
tions without giving any imme
diate reply to them, other than to
say capable people had different
views on what is most urgently
needed.
The secretary's prepared testi
mony for the committee hearing,
which was behind closed doors,
was released to newsmen.
Advance Action
lie referred to the bill, con
taining $1,260,000,000 in new
money plus transfer authority
on $150,000,000 in old funds, as
an advance action on the defense
program for the fiscal year be
ginning next July.
The bill carrics nearly a bil
lion dollars for the Air Force,
with heavy emphasis on work to
speed missile development.
In another defense develop
ment yesterday, Senator Russell
chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said
he doubts that President Eisen
hower's new $39,800,000,000 de
fense budget provides enough
"strength in being."
