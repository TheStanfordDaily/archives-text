# A 						Dangerous Practice
## 
### 
One of the more disturbing aspects of Stan
ford's judicial system, as brought out by Bar
bara Beckwith's letter yesterday, was the fact
that the student is unaware of precisely what
charges have been made against him.
Consequently he has little chance to defend
himself and is certainly placed at a disadvan
tage in refuting testimony he has never heard.
This is dangerous and unfortunate for the
individual student who faces a Judicial Council
accusation. But far more dangerous is the fact
that every student at Stanford is faced with a
situation in which assumptions have been made
about him, without his knowledge, by persons
unfit and untrained for the job.
Each year resident assistants ali over campus
file personality reports on the students in their
dorm or house. They are supposedly qualified
to do so by virtue of having lived among the
students as one of them.
In reality, the I?. A.—technically a member
of the Administration- is unqualified to make
out such reports. Only trained counselors have
1 lie qualifications lo look at a student's be
havior and judge the personality or motivations
that governed these specific acts.
This is assuming the l{.A. knows ihe indi
\idual well enough to be able to pick out spe
cific incidents showing "emot ion id immaturity,"
"poor attitudes," or the other questions he is
required lo answer.
Far more often, I he R.A., who is responsible
for up to 5(1 students, knows oidy a lew of I hem
well enough to write any kind of report. His
social contacts with the rest of the students in
the dorm are largely limited to those whose
rooms adjoin his own.
Few of tis would presume to say we know
intimately all the students who occupy rooms
above or below us or far down the hall from us.
Resident assistants, with the best will in the
world, are no more versatile in juggling their
schedules. They cannot spend sufficient time
with each student to understand him and his
problems well enough to write s'uch reports.
We are bothered by the '"hush-hush" that
has accompanied this custom. Most of the stu
dents are unaware that they have been reported
on from the moment they came to the Univer
sity as freshmen, when their sponsors began
the reports which could add up to a dangerous
total against them in later years.

But even knowing about the reports does the
individual student no good when the contents
of the reports are concealed from him and
when he has no opportunity to explain or
refute their contents.
The natural question that comes to mind is:
hat is the purpose of these reports? To what
use are they put?
Administration officials will say there is no
real "purpose" for the repents; that they never
go beyond the University; that they are used
simply to evaluate the type of students that
Stanford attracts.
But: if there is no real purpose, why bother?
If the reports are used for research purposes,
why not use qualified personality counselors
with standardized personality tests, rather than
subjective opinion? Only a trained analyst can
detach himself from any personal feeling
toward an individual well enough lo judge that
individual objectively.
As for going beyond the confines of this Uni
versity, the very existence of such files is a
temptation to faculty and Administration when
a student requests references to be sent to other
schools or to prospective employers. It would
be so easy to "refresh" one's memory by con
sulting the reports.
We are bothered by the way the reports are
obtained. \\ e consider il an invasion of privacy
when H.A.'s check our rooms in our absence
lo determine personal habits, or neatness, or
cleanliness.
The cleanest room ordinarily could be in
temporary disarray due lo midterms, papers,
or many other factors at that particular time
the R.A. chose to check.
Worst of all, perhaps, are the measurements
which the R.A. must use lo arrive at his de
cision.
Lacking adequate knowledge of his students'
habits, he must judge hy such strictly super
ficial signs as participation in house activities
and other social interests. The deeper intellec
tual and personal qualities which this Univer
sity is supposedly trying lo develop in us are
hidden from such a cursory personality ap
praisal.
There is 100 much conformity in the world
already. The purpose of a university is not to
further such tendencies by this kind of subtle
pressure.

The natural question that comes to mind is:
hat is the purpose of these reports? To what
use are they put?
Administration officials will say there is no
real "purpose" for the repents; that they never
go beyond the University; that they are used
simply to evaluate the type of students that
Stanford attracts.
But: if there is no real purpose, why bother?
If the reports are used for research purposes,
why not use qualified personality counselors
with standardized personality tests, rather than
subjective opinion? Only a trained analyst can
detach himself from any personal feeling
toward an individual well enough lo judge that
individual objectively.
As for going beyond the confines of this Uni
versity, the very existence of such files is a
temptation to faculty and Administration when
a student requests references to be sent to other
schools or to prospective employers. It would
be so easy to "refresh" one's memory by con
sulting the reports.
We are bothered by the way the reports are
obtained. \\ e consider il an invasion of privacy

lo determine personal habits, or neatness, or
cleanliness.
The cleanest room ordinarily could be in
temporary disarray due lo midterms, papers,
or many other factors at that particular time
the R.A. chose to check.
Worst of all, perhaps, are the measurements
which the R.A. must use lo arrive at his de
cision.
Lacking adequate knowledge of his students'
habits, he must judge hy such strictly super
ficial signs as participation in house activities
and other social interests. The deeper intellec
tual and personal qualities which this Univer

There is 100 much conformity in the world

One of the more disturbing aspects of Stan
ford's judicial system, as brought out by Bar
bara Beckwith's letter yesterday, was the fact
that the student is unaware of precisely what
charges have been made against him.
Consequently he has little chance to defend
himself and is certainly placed at a disadvan
tage in refuting testimony he has never heard.
This is dangerous and unfortunate for the
individual student who faces a Judicial Council
accusation. But far more dangerous is the fact
that every student at Stanford is faced with a
situation in which assumptions have been made
about him, without his knowledge, by persons
unfit and untrained for the job.
Each year resident assistants ali over campus
file personality reports on the students in their
dorm or house. They are supposedly qualified
to do so by virtue of having lived among the
students as one of them.
In reality, the I?. A.—technically a member

Resident assistants, with the best will in the

himself and is certainly placed at a disadvan
tage in refuting testimony he has never heard.
This is dangerous and unfortunate for the
individual student who faces a Judicial Council
accusation. But far more dangerous is the fact
that every student at Stanford is faced with a
situation in which assumptions have been made
about him, without his knowledge, by persons
unfit and untrained for the job.
Each year resident assistants ali over campus
file personality reports on the students in their
dorm or house. They are supposedly qualified
to do so by virtue of having lived among the
students as one of them.
In reality, the I?. A.—technically a member
of the Administration- is unqualified to make
out such reports. Only trained counselors have
1 lie qualifications lo look at a student's be
havior and judge the personality or motivations
that governed these specific acts.
This is assuming the l{.A. knows ihe indi
\idual well enough to be able to pick out spe
cific incidents showing "emot ion id immaturity,"
"poor attitudes," or the other questions he is
required lo answer.
Far more often, I he R.A., who is responsible
for up to 5(1 students, knows oidy a lew of I hem
well enough to write any kind of report. His
social contacts with the rest of the students in
the dorm are largely limited to those whose
rooms adjoin his own.
Few of tis would presume to say we know
intimately all the students who occupy rooms
above or below us or far down the hall from us.
Resident assistants, with the best will in the
world, are no more versatile in juggling their
schedules. They cannot spend sufficient time
with each student to understand him and his
problems well enough to write s'uch reports.
We are bothered by the '"hush-hush" that
has accompanied this custom. Most of the stu
dents are unaware that they have been reported
on from the moment they came to the Univer
sity as freshmen, when their sponsors began
the reports which could add up to a dangerous
total against them in later years.

But even knowing about the reports does the
individual student no good when the contents
of the reports are concealed from him and
when he has no opportunity to explain or
refute their contents.
The natural question that comes to mind is:
hat is the purpose of these reports? To what
use are they put?
Administration officials will say there is no
real "purpose" for the repents; that they never
go beyond the University; that they are used
simply to evaluate the type of students that
Stanford attracts.
But: if there is no real purpose, why bother?
If the reports are used for research purposes,
why not use qualified personality counselors
with standardized personality tests, rather than
subjective opinion? Only a trained analyst can
detach himself from any personal feeling
toward an individual well enough lo judge that
individual objectively.
As for going beyond the confines of this Uni
versity, the very existence of such files is a
temptation to faculty and Administration when
a student requests references to be sent to other
schools or to prospective employers. It would
be so easy to "refresh" one's memory by con
sulting the reports.
We are bothered by the way the reports are
obtained. \\ e consider il an invasion of privacy
when H.A.'s check our rooms in our absence
lo determine personal habits, or neatness, or
cleanliness.
The cleanest room ordinarily could be in
temporary disarray due lo midterms, papers,
or many other factors at that particular time
the R.A. chose to check.
Worst of all, perhaps, are the measurements
which the R.A. must use lo arrive at his de
cision.
Lacking adequate knowledge of his students'
habits, he must judge hy such strictly super
ficial signs as participation in house activities
and other social interests. The deeper intellec
tual and personal qualities which this Univer
sity is supposedly trying lo develop in us are
hidden from such a cursory personality ap
praisal.
There is 100 much conformity in the world
already. The purpose of a university is not to
further such tendencies by this kind of subtle
pressure.
One of the more disturbing aspects of Stan
ford's judicial system, as brought out by Bar
bara Beckwith's letter yesterday, was the fact
that the student is unaware of precisely what
charges have been made against him.
Consequently he has little chance to defend
himself and is certainly placed at a disadvan
tage in refuting testimony he has never heard.
