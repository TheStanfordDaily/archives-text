# Constitution Exempts Stanford; Amendments Assure No Taxes
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
"You'll never see the day when
one of your boys will ever lift a
finger in your defense!" were the
words which instigated the move
eventually exempting private
schools a.nd churches in Califor
nia from taxation.
Uttered by C. P. Huntington, an
executive of Central Pacific Rail
road, to Mrs. Leland Stanford as
he told her of his presuming to
name a director of the railroad to
a position theretofore filled by a
Stanford representative, these
words so greatly hurt the Univer
sity co-founder that she sought
consolation from one of her
"boys," George E. Crothers.
Crothers, feeling an obligation
to do something which would con
vince Mrs. Stanford that ihe stu
dents, faculty and alumni were
really back of her, suggested that
these three groups hold a mass
meeting with the purpose of se
curing an exemption of University
property from taxation.
Many Amendments
Thus resulted a campaign that
added many amendments to the
state constitution, including one
specifically naming Stanford Uni
versity.'
Palo Alto Assemblyman Mal
colm introduced a bill in the legis
lature to the effect that, as all
public schools were exempt from
taxation, so should Stanford Uni
versity. However, it became so
complicated that it. ended with
Stanford being the only school to

which the proposed law could ever
apply!
This was defeated, and in 1898
interested people formed a "Stan
ford University Tax Exemption
Club," which stimulated interest
in a state campaign to pass a tax
exemption law.
Public Approval
Finally a suitable amendment
was passed by the legislature, and
the only problem remaining was
to have it made into a law by the
unanimous approval of the Cali
fornia public.
Because Stanford held land
throughout California, some coun
ties thought the exemption would
be unfair. However, by enlisting
support of newspapers and fra
ternal organizations throughout
the state, the law passed with
137,667 positive to 67,737 negative
votes.
(Following this, churches
throughout the state united to put
a law through the legislature ex
empting from s tale taxes all
church moneys and property.)
The amendment reads: . . All
property held in trust for the
founding, maintenance or benefit
of Stanford University or any de
partment thereof may be exempt
ed by special act from slale taxa
tion; and all similar property may
be exempted; . . . provided, that
residents of California shall be
charged no fees for tuition unless
such fees be authorized by act of
the Legislature."

This latter part was authorized
by the stale government in 19()0.
The addition reads: "The trustees
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity may charge residents and
nonresidents of this state such
fees for tuition as are necessary
for the administration of the af
fairs of the University."
Thus empowering the Board of
Trustees with more duties, the
legislature, in section 10, article
<), specifically granted the trustees
with the authority to manage
Stanford's endowment and main
tenance.
And so Huntington's angry
words had the result of furnish
ing California politicians with is
sues to last a couple of years and
served to amend the constitution,
mold the students, faculty and
alumni together, and insure the
founding grant against any mis
takes.

to have it made into a law by the
unanimous approval of the Cali
fornia public.
Because Stanford held land
throughout California, some coun
ties thought the exemption would
be unfair. However, by enlisting
support of newspapers and fra
ternal organizations throughout
the state, the law passed with
137,667 positive to 67,737 negative
votes.
(Following this, churches
throughout the state united to put
a law through the legislature ex
empting from s tale taxes all
church moneys and property.)
The amendment reads: . . All
property held in trust for the
founding, maintenance or benefit
of Stanford University or any de
partment thereof may be exempt
ed by special act from slale taxa
tion; and all similar property may
be exempted; . . . provided, that
residents of California shall be
charged no fees for tuition unless
such fees be authorized by act of
the Legislature."

This latter part was authorized
by the stale government in 19()0.
The addition reads: "The trustees
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity may charge residents and
nonresidents of this state such
fees for tuition as are necessary
for the administration of the af
fairs of the University."
Thus empowering the Board of
Trustees with more duties, the
legislature, in section 10, article
<), specifically granted the trustees
with the authority to manage
Stanford's endowment and main
tenance.
And so Huntington's angry
words had the result of furnish
ing California politicians with is
sues to last a couple of years and
served to amend the constitution,
mold the students, faculty and
alumni together, and insure the
founding grant against any mis
takes.
"You'll never see the day when
one of your boys will ever lift a
finger in your defense!" were the
words which instigated the move
eventually exempting private
schools a.nd churches in Califor
nia from taxation.
Uttered by C. P. Huntington, an
executive of Central Pacific Rail
road, to Mrs. Leland Stanford as
he told her of his presuming to
name a director of the railroad to
a position theretofore filled by a
Stanford representative, these
words so greatly hurt the Univer
sity co-founder that she sought
consolation from one of her
"boys," George E. Crothers.
Crothers, feeling an obligation
to do something which would con
vince Mrs. Stanford that ihe stu
dents, faculty and alumni were
really back of her, suggested that
these three groups hold a mass
meeting with the purpose of se
curing an exemption of University
property from taxation.
Many Amendments
Thus resulted a campaign that
added many amendments to the
state constitution, including one
specifically naming Stanford Uni
versity.'
Palo Alto Assemblyman Mal
colm introduced a bill in the legis
lature to the effect that, as all
public schools were exempt from
taxation, so should Stanford Uni
versity. However, it became so
complicated that it. ended with
Stanford being the only school to

which the proposed law could ever
apply!
This was defeated, and in 1898
interested people formed a "Stan
ford University Tax Exemption
Club," which stimulated interest
in a state campaign to pass a tax
exemption law.
Public Approval
Finally a suitable amendment
was passed by the legislature, and
the only problem remaining was
to have it made into a law by the
unanimous approval of the Cali
fornia public.
