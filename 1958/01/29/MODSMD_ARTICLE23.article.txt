A few words to the wise from
Ihe campus police to all those
who walk, r ide or drive on Stan
ford grounds (that should include
about everyone):
• Backing into parking spaces
is strictly illegal, according to
Chief Gordon Davis. Recent be
havior indicates that there are nu
merous Stanford drivers who are
unaware of this.
• Borrowing a bicycle without
first asking permission of the
owner is likely to result in the
loss of a friend and an appear
ance before Judicial Council.
• Borrowing an auto without
securing permission of the owner
may result in imprisonment,
should the Peninsula police stop
the driver of a vehicle which the
owner repo r t e d missing (not
knowing that one of his friends
borrowed it).
Should intentional theft not bo
Ihe case, a reprimand will never
theless be forthcoming from the
campus police. When a vehicle is
reported missing, a stolen car re
port is given the Peninsula police.
• False alarms are not held in
high esteem.
