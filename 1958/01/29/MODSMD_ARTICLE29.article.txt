### Steve Baffrey 
Stanford's new head football
coach, Jack Curtice, proved to his
first Stanford audience yesterday
that advance stories calling him a
humorist were all truth, no exag
gera I ion.
The new coach was ushered in
with a rousing ovation from stu
dents who nearly filled Cubberloy
Auditorium for the first chance
to see and hear him.
"I see you don't have much to
do this afternoon," he greeted his j
audience, "and I'm glad you came
to spend it with me." In an almost
effortless manner, Curtice went
on to entertain his new supporters '
in his 25-minute talk.
In his famous Kentucky drawl,
Curtice told of his reasons for ac- j
cepting the Stanford football po- i
sit ion, his hopes while here, and i
some of his other philosophies, j
both serious and humorous.
Athletic Tradition
"I came to Stanford," he said,
"because I have, si nce a very |
young man, respected Stanford |
University for its academic stand-;
aids and its great athletic tradi
tion.
"Another reason I am here," he j
told the group, "is N because of j
Stanford's balanced athletic pro-j
gram. This is a most important 1
reason. Any boy who doesn't come j
to a university for academic rea- i
sons first does not have the cor
rect goal in mind.
Quality Not Quantify
"We will always try to produce
teams we can be proud of. teams
which can be congratulated, even
if they lose, for having played a
goorl game. We will seek quality
rather than quantity in our ath-j
letic endeavors."
Speaking more on this topic, j
Curtice said: "This is a tough;
conference we're inâ€”or are we in I
one? I suppose this is a hypo
thetical question."
The 48-year-old mentor noted
lhat he regretted the fact that
only 10 per cent of the male popu
lation of Ihe United States ever
competes in organized athletics.
"I wish it were possible for 100

per cent of them to compete-," he
said.
Hack on the subject of Stanford,
Curtice told the group, "1 hope
you fool the great pride in this
university that I do." Earlier hr
commented on the "togetherness
and stick-to it iveness" that ho
found hero. "Why just the other
day,"he said, "I got a telegram
from some alumni saying they
were with me, 'win or tie.'"
One Finger or Two?
Early in lib talk Curtice made'
reference to the new extra-poinl j
situation with the remark that
"now, after scoring a touchdown,
you can turn to the stands and
find out what the group wants by;
holding up one finger or two."
Famous Curtice anecdotes ap
peared throughout his speech, al
ways drawing laughter from the
crowd. "I only hope I can make
you laugh this way a year from
now," he said in closing. "Remem
ber right now I'm undefeated."
