When the Stanford eagers step!
onto the floor at lOdinundson Pa- i
vilion, Seattle, Friday night, they
can expect to find a steadily, im
proving University of Washing
ton squad ready and wailing for
them.
The Huskies, who started the
season losing their opening three
games, have begun to come alive
in their last few games. Last
weekend the Washington men
pulled a surprise upset over the
Oregon State Beavers, holding
OSC's Dave Gambec to only 11 j
points.
In their first meeting this year
at the Stanford Pavilion, Wash
ington pulled to a quick lead and
managed to hold off a late Stan
ford rally to win the game. 60-54. i
Doug Smart, the 6-7 Husky star,
tossed in 19 that night to take
high point honors.
Smart Is Key
Captain Paul Neumann had
probably his best night of the
season that evening when he
scored 16 points in a losing ef
fort.
The whole Washington offense
centers around Smart who this
year has averaged approximately
20 points per game. Smart is
one of the league's best rebound
ers and has a shooting average
of 45 per cent.
The tall, junior pre-med stu
dent from Seattle has developed
a very neat hook shot since he

has been under the instruction of
Tippy Dye, U. of Washington
coach.
llook Shot
This hook shot along with his
reverse lay-up, which he shoots
with his back to the basket, are
Smart's best offensive weapons.
II Stanford can contain Smart's
scoring punch, Washington will
be hurting.
The Huskies' next high e s t
scorer is averaging a mere six
points per game.
Teaming with Smart in the
Huskies' starting lineup are (>•(!
forward Jim Greer, 61 sopho
more forward A 1 Murphy, 6-2
guard John Tuft and 5-11 guard
Dick Crews.
Of these other four starters,
the leading scorer is Crews who
is averaging six points per game.
Murphy, who began the season
as a second-stringer, has devel
oped into a ver.y strong rebound
er and, along with Smart, gives
Washington a lot of strength off
the boards.
A Stanford win over Washing
ton would definitely be an indica
tion that the Cards were begin
ning to live up to their potential.
Huskies Among ISest
Washington has shown over its
last few games that it can play as
well" as the best in the PCC. In
addition, the Huskies arc almost
unbeatable on their home floor.
Any team conquering them there
can consider it quite a victory.
Coach Tippy Dye, since coming
to Washington in 1950, has com
piled a record of 132 wins to only
59 losses. He is mainly noted for
his development of excellent de
fensive teams and of good pivot
men.
This year's Husky team is no
exception, having allowed their
opponents less than 55 points per
game.
