### 
ANKARA, Turkey (/P) — The
Baghdad Pact allies yesterday es
tablished a combined military
planning staff. This could serve
as the forerunner to a NATO-type
unified command in the Middle
East.
The five-nation alliance, with
U.S. backing, announced that the
enlarged combined staff will take
the place of the present planning
organization.
Informed sources said the move
is a step toward tying together
more closely the loose military
organization of the anti-Commu
nist alliance. The decision was
taken at a secret session of the
Pact's council of ministers.
Earlier the Baghdad powers—
Britain, Iran, Iraq, Turkey and
Pakistan- approved a long - term
plan for establishing a strategic
system of highways, airfields,
ports and radio communications
from the Aegean to the Arabian
Sea.
The United States is not a full
Pact member, but U.S. Secretary
of Stale Dulles is attending as an
observer.
