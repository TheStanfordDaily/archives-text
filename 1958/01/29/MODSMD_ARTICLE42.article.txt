# LAND MYTH
## Stanfords Willed 3 Estates; Paly Farm to Be Kept Intact 
### Dave Quarles 
The common interpretation of
Stanford's land holdings is sum
med up in the phrase "It's in the
Will." Each year the freshmen
are told that Mrs. Stanford is the
cause of all the University's prob
lems because her will contains
the provision that no land can be
sold.
Through the publication of the
Will. The Daily exploded this the
ory conclusively. However, the
real facts concerning Stanford's
acres have yet to be brought for
ward.
Three farms of approximately
82,200 acres total were given to
the University in the original
Founding Grant of 1885. These
lands were turned over to the 24
trustees with the single provision
that only the Palo Alto Farm was
to be kept intact.
"Absolute Dominion"
Although the Stanfords handed
over the land with all "appurte
nances thereunto," thov did not
give the trustees complete power.
Both Senator and Mrs. Stanford
reserved the "right to absolute

dominion" over the property
until their deaths.
An early publication of the
Founding Grant provides a sup
plement with rather glowing de
scriptions of the three farms,
Stanford's Gridley Farm, Stan
ford's Vina Farm, and the Palo
Alto Farm.
Sounding like a pre-reg speech,
the pamphlet exults:
"The great estate of Palo Alto
with its magnificent distances,
beautiful scenery, fruitful soil,
rich productive powers, and ex
cellent location forms one of the
finest private properties in the
United Stales."
7200 Acres
S en a to r Stanford purchased
the first 800 acres of the Farm
in 1876 and eventually acquired
a total of 7200 acres.
The Senator, strongly addicted
to organization, had his Palo
Alto estate divided into a "Trot
ting Horse Department," a "Run
ning Horse Department," a
"Farming Department," and fi
nally a "House and Grounds De
partment."
The Farm boasted, among oth
er things, a carrot field of 60
acres and a pasture where "the
favored horses of young Leland
are exempted from further la
bor."
Horses Were Specially
Horses were the specialty of
the Farm, and although the au
thor of l he pamphlet does not go
into detail, he comments that "a
system, peculiar to Governor
Stanford, is used in training the
young animals."
Another hobby of Governor
Stanford's was growing trees. He
used 299 acres of the Palo Alto
estate for this pastime, and it was
his desire to have every known
species of tree that would grow
on the Farm. In one year the
Governor planted 12,000 trees.
What vvilh horses and trees the
annual cost of the Palo Alto
Farm was in the neighborhood of
$225,000 a year. However, $10,-
ono of that total was made every
year on the vineyards.
The Vina Farm was originally
a Spanish land grant in Butte
and Tehama counties to Peter
Lassen, an early Danish settler
in California.
The year 1882 saw 1000 acres
of the Vina Farm set to vine
yards of "the finest varieties of
wine, raisin and table grapes"
along with grafts especially im
ported from Europe by Governor
Stanford.
