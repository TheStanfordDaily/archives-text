# MORE INDEPENDENT STUDY
## History, Psychology Depts. Institute Honors Program 
### 
A new Independent Studies
Program lias been instituted by
the history and psychology de
partments for undergraduates.
The emphasis of these pro
grams is for more advanced read
ing and research in individual in
terest areas.
Dr. Carl Brand, history profes
sor, stressed the accelerated read
ing done by former independent
programs. "This will give the
student a depth of knowledge,
though this program is not to
take the place of the General
Studies Plan."
Dr. Brand continued, "Most
American students don't read
enough outside of their general
texts. This program is intense,
but not above the able Stanford
student."
Requirements for admission to
the Honors Program include the
following:
• B average in history and
normally the same in the Univer
sity.
• Completion of the basic sem
inar.
• Sponsorship by a member of
the department.
• Departmental approval and
application in time to be consid
ered.
Students should apply before
spring of their junior year. The
Weter Scholarship is available to
students enrolled in the Honors
program.

The students selected will eon
duct their own seminars with the
assistance of a graduate student.
The program will include re
search, reading, discussions and
an Honors thesis. These will be
graded at the completion of the
program.
Students interested in this plan
for their junior and senior years
should register at the depart
ment during spring quarter.
