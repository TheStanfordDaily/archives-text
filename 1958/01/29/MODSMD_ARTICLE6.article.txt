# U.S. Rebukes Khrushchev 'Distortions'
## 'Twisted Views' Show Dangers of Hushing Summit Conference 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—'The Unit
ed States yesterday accused So
viet party leader Nikita Khru
shchev of distorting American
policy. It said his twisted views
show the danger of rushing into
a summit conference with the
Russians.
State Department press chief
Lincoln White administered a
roughly worded rebuke when ask
ed for comment on Khrushchev's
remarks at a Minsk farmers' rally
Wednesday and a Moscow cock
tail party Monday night.
Khrushchev pictured the United
States as an aggressor who would
"like to keep the whQle world in a
state of fear." He called for a
summit conference at which lead
ers would tackle "simple things"
first- as a diner starts off with
hors d'oeuvres.
"Distorted View"
White told his news conference:
"Mr. Khrushchev's distorted view
of U.S. policies and motivations
and of the policies and motiva
tions of some of our allies empha
sized the difficulties which would
beset a short, unprepared meeting
of heads of government such as
the Soviet government has pro
posed."
White said the United States is
still pushing the idea laid down
by President Eisenhower in a Jan.
12 letter to Soviet premier Nikolai
Bulganin. This called for talks at
lower levels and possibly a for
eign ministers' meeting before
hand to prepare any summit con
ference and assure it of some suc
cess.
Soviets Chided
The U.S. spokesman chided the
Soviets for not replying to Eisen
hower's letter. He said pointedly,
"We presume the Soviet Union
will reply to the serious proposal,"
and lie added:
"We cannot believe that the
Minsk speech of the first sccre-
I a ry of the Soviet Communist
party or indeed his remarks at
the cocktail party last night are
intended as an adequate reply."
