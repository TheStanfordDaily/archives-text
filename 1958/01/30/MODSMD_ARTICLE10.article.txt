# Loyd Wright Calls for Loyally, Tells Needed Security Changes
## 
### 
A renaissance of loyalties was called for last night by Loyd Wright,
chairman of the Commission on Government Security, at the Politi
cal Union in the Education Building.
Wright said that too many feel that government security is the
responsibility solely of the government, but the people as a whole

must be aware of the problems
and dangers involved in the safe
ty of the nation.
The speaker noted that the
commission which he chairs was
given the mandate to protect
against subversive activities and
to recommend appropriate secu
rity requirements, preserving ba
sic individual rights.
"The present security system
was o r ganize d piecemeal,"
Wright said, "as the need arose.
We are trying to develop a uni
form security system.
"In our investigation and rec
ommendations we had to be care
ful of the freedom of individuals,
but. there is one freedom no
American can claim: the freedom
to imperil the freedom of all
other Americans."
Attacking the publication of
defense information, such as the
location of radar bases in Canada,
Wright also noted that the secu
rity concepts may change from
time to time, and information
that might be released at one
time might not be released at an
other.
The basic recommendation of
the Commission's report is ihe
prohibition of unauthorized dis
closure of information vital to
national defense.
The Commission report also
recommends fingerprinting for
all going in and out of the coun
try; the extension of clearance
to the legislative and judicial
branches; wiretapping with cer
tain restrictions; and giving hear
ings to involved parties before
they are placed on a subversive
list, instead of afterward as is
now the practice.
