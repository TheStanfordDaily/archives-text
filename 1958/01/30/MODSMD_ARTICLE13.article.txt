# POLI VISION:
## 'Communists Strive to Rule Organizations' 
### 
Communists arc continuously
working to lake over American
organizations, Stuart Richardson
Ward, executive secretary of the
Commonwealth Club of Califor
nia, told the Independent Caucus
of the Political Union yesterday
afternoon in Bowman Alumni
House.
"If the Communists aren't try
ing to get into your organization,
you should be insulted," Ward
said, citing examples of Commu
nist infiltration for the purpose of
taking over treasuries.
The Communists will try to get
control by working "their fool
heads off" and earn promotions,
he said.
"They also use the diamond
seating plan to control meetings,"
said Ward. "They will start a
chain of applause to support their
own speaker, and they will debate
a boring topic until everyone
leaves and they form the core for
important business."
Ward said that Communists say
their "free speech" is suppressed,
but noted that he has had no trou
ble getting a "leftist" to speak on
one of his radio programs, where
as a loyal American hesitates to
do so.
"I cannot support the theory
that millions of lives can be sacri
ficed, as the Communists did in
the Ukraine in 1933, when more
than three million people died at
Hie command of a few.
"A minority has a right to ex
press its opinion and to seek sup
port through the Australian ballot
system, but minority rule, as it is
through Communism, is wrong."
