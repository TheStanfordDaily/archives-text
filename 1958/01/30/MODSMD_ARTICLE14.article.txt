Secretary of State Dulles today
pledged an additional $10 million,
contingent upon congressional ap
proval, to improve communica
tions in the strategic Middle East
area covered by the Baghdad Pact
nations.
He coupled the pledge with a
warning that some austerity

the free world to meet the Soviet
Union's mounting economic offen
sive in the Middle East and else
where.
Shortly after Dulles spoke here,
the Soviet Union and Egypt signed
an economic pact which Presi
dent Nasser said would meet all
his country's needs for industrial
development. Moscow has also ex
tended economic aid to Egypt's
close ally Syria. Egypt is bitterly
opposed to the Baghdad Pact,
which Moscow has also de
nounced.
The United States had previ
ously pledged $8 million to build
telecommunications links in this
Middle East area, where a tele
phone call from Baghdad to Teh
ran must now be routed by way

The U.S. announcement came as

Baghdad Pact and the American
observer team headed by Dulles
ended the major part of their
work here.
