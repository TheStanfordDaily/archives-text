# Efficient Student Justice
## 
### 
T. 111 (â€¢: firm mi .if i that a just student govern
ment can he assured only by an informed and
watchful student body, The Daily has attempt
ed iu a series of two articles to raise the ques
tion of whether Stanford's student judicial sys
tem contains adequate guarantees for the pro
tection of the innocent.
Our sole aim in doing so has been to provoke
t-ulent thought and comment on the system,
nd to that end we have tried to he as impartial
and objective as was possible with such a con
troversial subject. We have tried to give all
the opinions, pro and con, as presented to us
]a Dean Winbigler, Dean ( raig, members of
ti " judical councils, and students who have
hi 1 tried for Honor (.ode or fundamental
Standard violations.
We are not advocating the overthrow of stu
dent justice. We are not suggesting that the
Administration take a more active hand in ju
dicial proceedings. And we certainly are not
attacking the council members personally. Iu
our dealings with them we have come to have
the highest respect for the personal integrity
of the members til Men's and Women s Coun
cils, under chairmen Cordon I inker and Myrna
kelley. We know they do not take their enor
mous responsibilities lightly, and we do not
en\ y them their jobs.
Our own conclusion after this investigation
is this: We agree with Dean W inbigler that the
lest of a judicial system is its effectiveness, and
we are willing to lake his word for it that no
innocent person has been found guilty since he
has been at Stanford. However, past perform
ance is not a sufficient guarantee for the future.
Dean Winbigler feels that the present and
past council members have been honest, fair
and conscious of the importance of their deci
sions. Again, we agree. But to put our confi
dence in a government of men instead of in one
of laws does not seem to us the wisest policy.
It may work now, but what of the future? A
government based on personalities is unstable,

as has been shown hv some of the Sonlli Ameri
can dictatorships.
Kven if we assume that tlie innocent are ami
always will he acquitted eventually, it's this
eventually that bothers us. Mail) have com
plained about the possibility of double jeop
ardy under the present system. Whether moral
ly wrong or not, there seems to us to he no
reason for it. With a few changes in council
procedures, the need for retrials could he elim
inated.
Our main complaint, then, about the admin
istration of student justice is its inefficiency.
We propose the following changes, aimed at
improving, if not the effectiveness of student
justice, at least its efficiency:
1) The accused to have the right to face his
accuser and hear all testimony firsthand. As
Dean Craig has pointed out, if the accuser lived
up to his responsibility by encouraging the vio
lator to report himself, lie could have no logical
objection to facing the violator iu a hearing.
2) The accused be permitted to cross-exam
ine his accuser. Iu this way the accuracy of the
latter's testimony could be more easily ascer
tained.
.'{) All hearings be open to the public, at the
request of the accused. I lie accused should he
the one to decide whether secrecy is iu his best
interests or not.
A proposed change in the ASSU bylaws has
already been prepared for submission to Legis
lature tonight containing these and other rec
ommendations. We hope 1110 members of the
judicial councils and of Legislature will accept
our recommendations in the constructive spirit
iu which they are offered.
We are sure that they will, after the comment
of Women's Council chairman Kelley, who told
us she was "glad to see" The Daily's current
series because it would "help inform the stu
dent body." Miss Kelley also said she is "not
necessarily in favor of the present judicial sys
tem." We hope others will approach the sub
ject with as open a mind.
