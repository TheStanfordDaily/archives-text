? i) L I5ig Griii" in Sacramento
Editor, The Daily:
J have been extremely distressed to read many
of the comments by letter writers in response to
your editorial endorsing "Pat" Brown for Gover
nor of the State. For my part, there can be no
objection raised as to the ethics of your support
ing a candidate. I would be disappointed if The
Daily did not have somp views and opinions on
the current political situation. I feel that a col
lege newspaper not only has the right but also
the duty to express those views and opinions
which it has on its editorial page.
Though I endorse your stand that your views
can and should be expressed, I fail to sympathize
with those views. As a registered Democrat, I
cannot overlook the all too obvious fact that Pat
Brown is but another of the current political phe
nomenon: the "nice guy," let's have a talk over
the back fence," golf playing, and, sadly, rather
f mpty-headed individuals, the supreme example
of which resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C. After six years of the admin
istration of one of these individuals, I should
think The Daily would take extreme care before
endorsing a person of similar intellectual quali
ties.
Perhaps The Daily is acquainted with "Pat's"
history as the District Attorney for San Fran
cisco. After winning election on a promise for
a "more active D.A.," "Pat" made two appear
ances in court. Both of these appearances lasted
a very shott time. "Pat." proved to be a very
funny fellow, so funny that he was laughed out
of court on both occasions. Needless to say,
"Pat" never showed his face in a courtroom
during the tenure of his office.
As a Democrat, I should like to see a Demo
crat win the office of Governor, but a man of
"Pat" Brown's caliber cannot win my vote. I
have had enough of the "big grin" in Washing
ton. Let's not have another one in California.

Editor, The Daily:
An open letter to R. Bryce Anderson:
So, my woolworthy opponent, we meet again
on the bullshooting field of battle! I am ex
pounding this literary classic as a direct reply to
your letter to Hie editor of the dippy which ap
peared in the Nov. 5, 1957, issue of 1he afore
mentioned rag.
H is incomprhensible that a Stanford student
(I use the term loosely) would lower himself to
such juvenile dribble let alone submitting it for
publication. 1 can understand, therefore, lhat
if you, in a moment of weakness, had written
such a letter you would try to disguise the au
thorship of it.
it is in regard to your feeble attempt to shift
responsibility for this unworthy article and keep
FOLKS from WAGGIN' their tongues that I
w.ite, In the future, please either sign your
first name, Rudolf, since that is the one you
normally use, or else think up a nom-de-plume
which will not be confused with actual persons.
If you don't follow this advice I fear that you
will BRE]W up trouble for yourslf, only to find
that you cannot STIR it.
in SHORT, were we not old friends, the close
similarity between your middle name and mine
might have riled me up like a PEPSI, and fired

I
me up like a COKE so that for a PENNY I would
gladly have sent you a loaded CIGAR.
To be FRANK with you, this JAZZ has got to
go! People will start BARFING if you write
any more of that nonsense and will begin to
wonder how MEN so LOW get into Stanford.
Consider yourself chastised and forewarned
that I see RED when reading such dribble. Re
member, I shall return.

Passive Resistance No Panacea
Editor, The Daily:
There are no doubt some things to be said for
passive resistance; and, by now, they have been
said. Of course, passive resistance has by no
means been truly successful in many places
where the poorly-informed think it to have been;
e.g., Norway was liberated by military defeat of
the Nazi armies, and India received its independ
ence when Sir Winston's empire-minded govern
ment was replaced by one of a Labor Party long
committed to India's independence. It will not
do to interpret as a triumph for passive resist
ance every increase in freedom which comes
about in a country in which some peaceful folk
happen to have been lying on railway tracks.
There is, too, an important fact regarding the
movements' success which makes its universal
usefulness as a tool for the oppressed quite
doubtful, to say the least: viz., that it requires
weakness on the part of the "oppressor." Eng
land was very weak after World War II, to lake
a notable example. Against determined, well
supported and equipped fanatics, passive resist
ance can in general only increase the amount of
food available to the average surviving citizen of
the country.
Passive resistance, then, for all the appeal il
may have to the peaceful or draft-eligible, is by
no means a panacea, even where it is appropri
ate; still, as the last resort of an oppressed peo
ple, it may well accomplish considerable, and be
preferable to co-operation or inaction.
But that is just the point. One does not recom
mend that last resort of the oppressed, who hope
that their oppressors' hearts will be softened, to
an independent nation, not only well able to de
fend itself but also possessing such arms as to
deter any attack on it by the enemy. There is
such a thing as making action appropriate lo the
situation. And, as should be apparent lo anyone
(except those who try too hard to be more dis
cerning than their fellows, or to appear so), for 1
a strong and well-defended land to casl its arms
away and throw itself upon the mercy of a sys
tem opposed to all thai it believes in is hardly
wise.

$6,000,000 Error
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter published in The Daily, Tuesday,
Jan. 2S, Ladd Wheeler stated that the cost of re
building Memorial Church after the earthquake
was $7,000,000. His claim that I he money would
have done more good as an investment may be
true, but the figures he used to support his argu
ment are not. According to Eliot's "Stanford Uni
versity: The First 25 Years," the restoration of
Memorial Church cost, about $650,000. I'm sur
prised that your writers with such a penchant for
Stanford history failed to nolice an error of over
$6,000,000.

$6,000,000 Error
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter published in The Daily, Tuesday,
Jan. 2S, Ladd Wheeler stated that the cost of re
building Memorial Church after the earthquake
was $7,000,000. His claim that I he money would
have done more good as an investment may be
true, but the figures he used to support his argu
ment are not. According to Eliot's "Stanford Uni
versity: The First 25 Years," the restoration of
Memorial Church cost, about $650,000. I'm sur
prised that your writers with such a penchant for
Stanford history failed to nolice an error of over
$6,000,000.

Editor, The Daily:
J have been extremely distressed to read many
of the comments by letter writers in response to
your editorial endorsing "Pat" Brown for Gover
nor of the State. For my part, there can be no
objection raised as to the ethics of your support
ing a candidate. I would be disappointed if The
Daily did not have somp views and opinions on
the current political situation. I feel that a col
lege newspaper not only has the right but also
the duty to express those views and opinions
which it has on its editorial page.
Though I endorse your stand that your views
can and should be expressed, I fail to sympathize
with those views. As a registered Democrat, I
cannot overlook the all too obvious fact that Pat
Brown is but another of the current political phe
nomenon: the "nice guy," let's have a talk over
the back fence," golf playing, and, sadly, rather
f mpty-headed individuals, the supreme example
of which resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C. After six years of the admin
istration of one of these individuals, I should
think The Daily would take extreme care before
endorsing a person of similar intellectual quali
ties.
Perhaps The Daily is acquainted with "Pat's"
history as the District Attorney for San Fran
cisco. After winning election on a promise for
a "more active D.A.," "Pat" made two appear
ances in court. Both of these appearances lasted
a very shott time. "Pat." proved to be a very
funny fellow, so funny that he was laughed out
of court on both occasions. Needless to say,
"Pat" never showed his face in a courtroom
during the tenure of his office.
As a Democrat, I should like to see a Demo
crat win the office of Governor, but a man of
"Pat" Brown's caliber cannot win my vote. I
have had enough of the "big grin" in Washing
ton. Let's not have another one in California.

Passive Resistance No Panacea
Editor, The Daily:
There are no doubt some things to be said for
passive resistance; and, by now, they have been
said. Of course, passive resistance has by no
means been truly successful in many places
where the poorly-informed think it to have been;
e.g., Norway was liberated by military defeat of
the Nazi armies, and India received its independ
ence when Sir Winston's empire-minded govern
ment was replaced by one of a Labor Party long
committed to India's independence. It will not
do to interpret as a triumph for passive resist
ance every increase in freedom which comes
about in a country in which some peaceful folk
happen to have been lying on railway tracks.
There is, too, an important fact regarding the
movements' success which makes its universal
usefulness as a tool for the oppressed quite
doubtful, to say the least: viz., that it requires
weakness on the part of the "oppressor." Eng
land was very weak after World War II, to lake
a notable example. Against determined, well
supported and equipped fanatics, passive resist
ance can in general only increase the amount of
food available to the average surviving citizen of
the country.
Passive resistance, then, for all the appeal il
may have to the peaceful or draft-eligible, is by
no means a panacea, even where it is appropri
ate; still, as the last resort of an oppressed peo
ple, it may well accomplish considerable, and be
preferable to co-operation or inaction.
But that is just the point. One does not recom
mend that last resort of the oppressed, who hope
that their oppressors' hearts will be softened, to
an independent nation, not only well able to de
fend itself but also possessing such arms as to
deter any attack on it by the enemy. There is

said. Of course, passive resistance has by no
means been truly successful in many places
where the poorly-informed think it to have been;
e.g., Norway was liberated by military defeat of
the Nazi armies, and India received its independ
ence when Sir Winston's empire-minded govern
ment was replaced by one of a Labor Party long
committed to India's independence. It will not
do to interpret as a triumph for passive resist
ance every increase in freedom which comes
about in a country in which some peaceful folk
happen to have been lying on railway tracks.
There is, too, an important fact regarding the
movements' success which makes its universal
usefulness as a tool for the oppressed quite
doubtful, to say the least: viz., that it requires
weakness on the part of the "oppressor." Eng
land was very weak after World War II, to lake
a notable example. Against determined, well
supported and equipped fanatics, passive resist
ance can in general only increase the amount of
food available to the average surviving citizen of
the country.
Passive resistance, then, for all the appeal il
may have to the peaceful or draft-eligible, is by
no means a panacea, even where it is appropri
ate; still, as the last resort of an oppressed peo
ple, it may well accomplish considerable, and be
preferable to co-operation or inaction.
But that is just the point. One does not recom
mend that last resort of the oppressed, who hope
that their oppressors' hearts will be softened, to
an independent nation, not only well able to de
fend itself but also possessing such arms as to
deter any attack on it by the enemy. There is
such a thing as making action appropriate lo the
situation. And, as should be apparent lo anyone
(except those who try too hard to be more dis
cerning than their fellows, or to appear so), for 1
a strong and well-defended land to casl its arms
away and throw itself upon the mercy of a sys
tem opposed to all thai it believes in is hardly

$6,000,000 Error
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter published in The Daily, Tuesday,
Jan. 2S, Ladd Wheeler stated that the cost of re
building Memorial Church after the earthquake
was $7,000,000. His claim that I he money would
have done more good as an investment may be
true, but the figures he used to support his argu
ment are not. According to Eliot's "Stanford Uni
versity: The First 25 Years," the restoration of
Memorial Church cost, about $650,000. I'm sur
prised that your writers with such a penchant for
Stanford history failed to nolice an error of over
$6,000,000.

J have been extremely distressed to read many
of the comments by letter writers in response to
your editorial endorsing "Pat" Brown for Gover
nor of the State. For my part, there can be no
objection raised as to the ethics of your support
ing a candidate. I would be disappointed if The
Daily did not have somp views and opinions on
the current political situation. I feel that a col
lege newspaper not only has the right but also
the duty to express those views and opinions
which it has on its editorial page.
Though I endorse your stand that your views
can and should be expressed, I fail to sympathize
with those views. As a registered Democrat, I
cannot overlook the all too obvious fact that Pat
Brown is but another of the current political phe
nomenon: the "nice guy," let's have a talk over
the back fence," golf playing, and, sadly, rather
f mpty-headed individuals, the supreme example
of which resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C. After six years of the admin
istration of one of these individuals, I should
think The Daily would take extreme care before
endorsing a person of similar intellectual quali
ties.
Perhaps The Daily is acquainted with "Pat's"
history as the District Attorney for San Fran
cisco. After winning election on a promise for
a "more active D.A.," "Pat" made two appear
ances in court. Both of these appearances lasted
a very shott time. "Pat." proved to be a very
funny fellow, so funny that he was laughed out
of court on both occasions. Needless to say,
"Pat" never showed his face in a courtroom
during the tenure of his office.
As a Democrat, I should like to see a Demo
crat win the office of Governor, but a man of
"Pat" Brown's caliber cannot win my vote. I
have had enough of the "big grin" in Washing
ton. Let's not have another one in California.

Passive Resistance No Panacea
Editor, The Daily:
There are no doubt some things to be said for
passive resistance; and, by now, they have been
said. Of course, passive resistance has by no
means been truly successful in many places
where the poorly-informed think it to have been;
e.g., Norway was liberated by military defeat of
the Nazi armies, and India received its independ
ence when Sir Winston's empire-minded govern
ment was replaced by one of a Labor Party long
committed to India's independence. It will not
do to interpret as a triumph for passive resist
ance every increase in freedom which comes
about in a country in which some peaceful folk
happen to have been lying on railway tracks.
There is, too, an important fact regarding the
movements' success which makes its universal
usefulness as a tool for the oppressed quite
doubtful, to say the least: viz., that it requires
weakness on the part of the "oppressor." Eng
land was very weak after World War II, to lake
a notable example. Against determined, well
supported and equipped fanatics, passive resist
ance can in general only increase the amount of
food available to the average surviving citizen of
the country.
Passive resistance, then, for all the appeal il
may have to the peaceful or draft-eligible, is by
no means a panacea, even where it is appropri
ate; still, as the last resort of an oppressed peo
ple, it may well accomplish considerable, and be
preferable to co-operation or inaction.
But that is just the point. One does not recom
mend that last resort of the oppressed, who hope
that their oppressors' hearts will be softened, to
an independent nation, not only well able to de
fend itself but also possessing such arms as to
deter any attack on it by the enemy. There is
such a thing as making action appropriate lo the
situation. And, as should be apparent lo anyone
(except those who try too hard to be more dis
cerning than their fellows, or to appear so), for 1
a strong and well-defended land to casl its arms
away and throw itself upon the mercy of a sys
tem opposed to all thai it believes in is hardly
wise.

$6,000,000 Error
Editor, The Daily:
In a letter published in The Daily, Tuesday,
Jan. 2S, Ladd Wheeler stated that the cost of re
building Memorial Church after the earthquake
was $7,000,000. His claim that I he money would
have done more good as an investment may be
true, but the figures he used to support his argu
ment are not. According to Eliot's "Stanford Uni
versity: The First 25 Years," the restoration of
Memorial Church cost, about $650,000. I'm sur
prised that your writers with such a penchant for
Stanford history failed to nolice an error of over
$6,000,000.

Editor, The Daily:
J have been extremely distressed to read many
of the comments by letter writers in response to
your editorial endorsing "Pat" Brown for Gover
nor of the State. For my part, there can be no
objection raised as to the ethics of your support
ing a candidate. I would be disappointed if The
Daily did not have somp views and opinions on
the current political situation. I feel that a col
lege newspaper not only has the right but also
the duty to express those views and opinions
which it has on its editorial page.
Though I endorse your stand that your views
can and should be expressed, I fail to sympathize
with those views. As a registered Democrat, I
cannot overlook the all too obvious fact that Pat
Brown is but another of the current political phe
nomenon: the "nice guy," let's have a talk over
the back fence," golf playing, and, sadly, rather
f mpty-headed individuals, the supreme example
of which resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C. After six years of the admin
istration of one of these individuals, I should
think The Daily would take extreme care before
endorsing a person of similar intellectual quali
ties.
Perhaps The Daily is acquainted with "Pat's"
history as the District Attorney for San Fran
cisco. After winning election on a promise for
a "more active D.A.," "Pat" made two appear
ances in court. Both of these appearances lasted
a very shott time. "Pat." proved to be a very
funny fellow, so funny that he was laughed out
of court on both occasions. Needless to say,
"Pat" never showed his face in a courtroom
during the tenure of his office.
As a Democrat, I should like to see a Demo
crat win the office of Governor, but a man of
"Pat" Brown's caliber cannot win my vote. I
have had enough of the "big grin" in Washing
ton. Let's not have another one in California.
