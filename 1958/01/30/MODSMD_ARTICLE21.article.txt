A Hurdle to Master
Yesterday proved it! This columnist has either a good or had
sense of humor, it really doesn't matter, bul whatever' it is he's going
to have to get over it to ever get a sensible story out of Stanford's
now Head Football Coach -lack Curtice. As said earlier, Curtice is a
Man of Good Copy ... if you can stop laughing long enough to take
notes.
And what makes the situation even worse is that Curtice is
spurred on by a good laugh and can always come up with another
good story to add. If this is the case then it looks like post-game
conferences in the coaching room next fall are going to go on a good
long while.
Let's face it, though, many of Curtice's comments are corny,
many of them old, but you've got to give him credit for being able
lo weave them into the right place at the right time, lie's a great
story teller and for this and many more reasons he's going to be
a great favorite around these parts. We are with you, Jack, to quote
you, "Win or tie" ... or even lose, I'm sure.
Among the Curtice-isms that came out of Tuesday's meeling was
this choice item about coaches having to be respectable and pleas
ing. "You have to be able to please everyone. For the president you
have to have ideals; for the alumni you have to win; for the athletic
group on the council you have to have organization. . .
The new coach is also a master at the "chop" which should make
him all the more welcome here where such verbalisms are many and
varied. Sports Editor Dick Barnes reports this cut lrom Tuesday
evening's PALO Club Million Dollar Banquet (a million dollars'
worth of athletic talent, that is, not of steaks and drinks).
At the press conference preceding the banquet a lull came in
the questioning and Hal Moore, national racing broadcaster, spoke,
"I hope you don't mind me asking you a question; I probably should
n't be here, but . . ." He got no further; Curtice quipped back, friend
ly though, "Well, why don't you leave, then?" And they all laughed.
LOOKS LIKE I WAS WRONG Seemed to me that one of the
most unusual comments to come out of Curtice's acceptance of Ihe
Stanford job was the one from a young Indian maiden, "He doesn't
.*ven look like a coach." Well, after Tuesday's talk I heard it from a
number' of sources. Such things as "You'd never think he was a
football coach if you met him on the street," or "He looks more like
a professor than a football coach."
But the best of this series of comments was this one; "He'd be
a great prof; I'd sure like to take a course from him." Well, to who
ever said that, the answer is a definite YOU CAN! Try the following
courses: Education 171c—Football Curriculum and Instruction—2
units, spring quarter (next year) and Education 173a—Football Of
ficiating 1 unit, this autumn.
Unmentioned, But Appreciated
Tn trying to include news of some minor sports that don't get
regular day-to-day publicity some time ago, I managed to get to
wrestling, but completely overlooked Stanford's Wrestling Coach
Don Damuth. Wes Ruff is the University's Director of Wrestling,
but Don is doing the actual coaching.
This is Damuth's third year on the coaching staff; he's a grad
student now. The teams, both frosh and varsity, the Athletic Depart
ment and Director Ruff are pleased, happy and thankful to have
Damuth's services.
Don started wrestling while in high school on Long Island. From
there he went on to captain Yale's 1954 freshman team and to par
ticipate in National AAU meets that year. He transferred here as
a sophomore, losing a year of eligibility, and was injured in one of
the first matches in his junior year. From there he went on to take
over the coaching reins.
"He has a profound knowledge of wrestling and his loss to us
as a competitor was our gain as a coach," Wrestling Director Rufi
says."The team and I certainly appreciate what he has done for us."
Congratulations on the work you have done, Don, and forgive the
unintentional slight.

Tn trying to include news of some minor sports that don't get
regular day-to-day publicity some time ago, I managed to get to
wrestling, but completely overlooked Stanford's Wrestling Coach
Don Damuth. Wes Ruff is the University's Director of Wrestling,
but Don is doing the actual coaching.
This is Damuth's third year on the coaching staff; he's a grad
student now. The teams, both frosh and varsity, the Athletic Depart
ment and Director Ruff are pleased, happy and thankful to have
Damuth's services.
Don started wrestling while in high school on Long Island. From
there he went on to captain Yale's 1954 freshman team and to par
ticipate in National AAU meets that year. He transferred here as
a sophomore, losing a year of eligibility, and was injured in one of
the first matches in his junior year. From there he went on to take
over the coaching reins.
"He has a profound knowledge of wrestling and his loss to us
as a competitor was our gain as a coach," Wrestling Director Rufi
says."The team and I certainly appreciate what he has done for us."
Congratulations on the work you have done, Don, and forgive the
unintentional slight.

A Hurdle to Master
Yesterday proved it! This columnist has either a good or had
sense of humor, it really doesn't matter, bul whatever' it is he's going
to have to get over it to ever get a sensible story out of Stanford's
now Head Football Coach -lack Curtice. As said earlier, Curtice is a
Man of Good Copy ... if you can stop laughing long enough to take
notes.
And what makes the situation even worse is that Curtice is
spurred on by a good laugh and can always come up with another
good story to add. If this is the case then it looks like post-game
conferences in the coaching room next fall are going to go on a good
long while.
Let's face it, though, many of Curtice's comments are corny,
many of them old, but you've got to give him credit for being able
lo weave them into the right place at the right time, lie's a great
story teller and for this and many more reasons he's going to be
a great favorite around these parts. We are with you, Jack, to quote
you, "Win or tie" ... or even lose, I'm sure.
Among the Curtice-isms that came out of Tuesday's meeling was
this choice item about coaches having to be respectable and pleas
ing. "You have to be able to please everyone. For the president you
have to have ideals; for the alumni you have to win; for the athletic
group on the council you have to have organization. . .
The new coach is also a master at the "chop" which should make
him all the more welcome here where such verbalisms are many and
varied. Sports Editor Dick Barnes reports this cut lrom Tuesday
evening's PALO Club Million Dollar Banquet (a million dollars'
worth of athletic talent, that is, not of steaks and drinks).
At the press conference preceding the banquet a lull came in
the questioning and Hal Moore, national racing broadcaster, spoke,
"I hope you don't mind me asking you a question; I probably should
n't be here, but . . ." He got no further; Curtice quipped back, friend
ly though, "Well, why don't you leave, then?" And they all laughed.
LOOKS LIKE I WAS WRONG Seemed to me that one of the
most unusual comments to come out of Curtice's acceptance of Ihe
Stanford job was the one from a young Indian maiden, "He doesn't
.*ven look like a coach." Well, after Tuesday's talk I heard it from a
number' of sources. Such things as "You'd never think he was a
football coach if you met him on the street," or "He looks more like
a professor than a football coach."
But the best of this series of comments was this one; "He'd be
a great prof; I'd sure like to take a course from him." Well, to who
ever said that, the answer is a definite YOU CAN! Try the following
courses: Education 171c—Football Curriculum and Instruction—2
units, spring quarter (next year) and Education 173a—Football Of

"I hope you don't mind me asking you a question; I probably should
n't be here, but . . ." He got no further; Curtice quipped back, friend
ly though, "Well, why don't you leave, then?" And they all laughed.
LOOKS LIKE I WAS WRONG Seemed to me that one of the
most unusual comments to come out of Curtice's acceptance of Ihe
Stanford job was the one from a young Indian maiden, "He doesn't
.*ven look like a coach." Well, after Tuesday's talk I heard it from a
number' of sources. Such things as "You'd never think he was a
football coach if you met him on the street," or "He looks more like
a professor than a football coach."
But the best of this series of comments was this one; "He'd be
a great prof; I'd sure like to take a course from him." Well, to who
ever said that, the answer is a definite YOU CAN! Try the following
courses: Education 171c—Football Curriculum and Instruction—2
units, spring quarter (next year) and Education 173a—Football Of
ficiating 1 unit, this autumn.
Unmentioned, But Appreciated
Tn trying to include news of some minor sports that don't get
regular day-to-day publicity some time ago, I managed to get to
wrestling, but completely overlooked Stanford's Wrestling Coach
Don Damuth. Wes Ruff is the University's Director of Wrestling,
but Don is doing the actual coaching.
This is Damuth's third year on the coaching staff; he's a grad
student now. The teams, both frosh and varsity, the Athletic Depart
ment and Director Ruff are pleased, happy and thankful to have
Damuth's services.
Don started wrestling while in high school on Long Island. From
there he went on to captain Yale's 1954 freshman team and to par
ticipate in National AAU meets that year. He transferred here as
a sophomore, losing a year of eligibility, and was injured in one of
the first matches in his junior year. From there he went on to take
over the coaching reins.
"He has a profound knowledge of wrestling and his loss to us
as a competitor was our gain as a coach," Wrestling Director Rufi
says."The team and I certainly appreciate what he has done for us."
Congratulations on the work you have done, Don, and forgive the
unintentional slight.

A Hurdle to Master
Yesterday proved it! This columnist has either a good or had
sense of humor, it really doesn't matter, bul whatever' it is he's going
to have to get over it to ever get a sensible story out of Stanford's
now Head Football Coach -lack Curtice. As said earlier, Curtice is a
Man of Good Copy ... if you can stop laughing long enough to take
notes.
And what makes the situation even worse is that Curtice is
spurred on by a good laugh and can always come up with another
good story to add. If this is the case then it looks like post-game
conferences in the coaching room next fall are going to go on a good
long while.
Let's face it, though, many of Curtice's comments are corny,
many of them old, but you've got to give him credit for being able
lo weave them into the right place at the right time, lie's a great
story teller and for this and many more reasons he's going to be
a great favorite around these parts. We are with you, Jack, to quote
you, "Win or tie" ... or even lose, I'm sure.
Among the Curtice-isms that came out of Tuesday's meeling was
this choice item about coaches having to be respectable and pleas
ing. "You have to be able to please everyone. For the president you
have to have ideals; for the alumni you have to win; for the athletic
group on the council you have to have organization. . .
The new coach is also a master at the "chop" which should make
him all the more welcome here where such verbalisms are many and
varied. Sports Editor Dick Barnes reports this cut lrom Tuesday
evening's PALO Club Million Dollar Banquet (a million dollars'
worth of athletic talent, that is, not of steaks and drinks).
At the press conference preceding the banquet a lull came in
the questioning and Hal Moore, national racing broadcaster, spoke,
"I hope you don't mind me asking you a question; I probably should
n't be here, but . . ." He got no further; Curtice quipped back, friend
ly though, "Well, why don't you leave, then?" And they all laughed.
