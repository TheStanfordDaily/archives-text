# Indians Seek Upset
## 
### John Anderson 
Stanford's hoopsters will run
into an experienced, well-bal
anced and determined bunch of
Oregon State Beavers this Satur
day night, but tlie Cards could
put OSC's title hopes into a tail
spin.
The last time Stanford saw ac
tion on the basketball court was
against the Orangemen in a game
which the Beavers won by the
safe margin of 68-59. However,
the Indians improved consider
ably in the second half of that
battle, outscoring the northerners
by nine points.
Apparently Coach Howie Dall
mar was pleased with that sec
ond-half performance, for he an
nounced no changes in the Stan
ford attack for this weekend's
game in Gill Coliseum.
Good Second Half
"We played a good second pe
riod against them down here; if
we can put two halves like that
together then we should do all
right," Dallmar reported.
Stanford's success in the last
stanza was due primarily to for
ward Dick Haga's guarding of
big Dave Gambee. The big prob
lem during most of the encounter
was in stopping the combination
of Gambee's close-in play and the
dead-eye outside shooting of Ken
Nanson, Lee Harmon and Jim
Anderson.
This same combination will
give the Indians Ihe most trouble
this Saturday according to Dall

mar. Of course, the Beavers' re
bounding is always a problem.
Add to this the convenience of
playing on the home court and
one can see the problem that
Stanford will have in stopping
Slats Gill's eagemen.
Give Schools Trouble
The Beavers' high shooting
percentage has given all confer
ence schools trouble. They arc
currently in second place in field
goal accuracy with a .374 aver
age in spite of a poor showing
against Washington last week
end.
Stanford will be seeing its first
action in two weeks this week
end. But Oregon State played a
two-game, home-and-home series
with Washington-last Friday and
Saturday. Ih the first clash, be
hind the 20-point interference of
Gambee, the Beavers piled up an
81-58 victory. The next night the
Huskies were able to bottle up
Gambee to post a 49-42 upset.
Oregon State is still in the
thick of the conference race.
They are in fourth place, trailing
Cal. UCLA and Idaho, but the
Beavers have lost only two
games and the season is only half
over.
Following the game at Corval
lis, the Indians will have a one
day layover until their Monday
night tilt against Oregon in Eu
gene. This will conclude the
three-game road trip which starts
Friday night against Washington
in Seattle.
