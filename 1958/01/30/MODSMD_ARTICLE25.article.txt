## 
### Jerry Wisot 
Stanford's boxing squad, following an autumn quarter of sparring
and shadow boxing, currently finds itself in the midst of its regular
season.
The 1958 slate includes two dual matches with both California and
Santa Clara.
On Jan. 10 the Indians dropped their opening match to the Rears at

Berkeley. They will go against
Santa Clara here on Feb. 13, meet
Cal here on Feb. 20 and then
round out their season with a
final match against Santa Clara
Feb. 20. All home matches are
held in the Pavilion.
Seek Fundamentals
Ray L un ny, who has been
coaching the boxers hero for the
past 10 years, emphasized that
most of the men on the squad are
juniors and sophomores who have
joined the squad to work on the
fundamentals of boxing rather
than to prepare for a career as
professionals.
He noted, however, that Stan
ford has turned out many excel
lent men in this sport, including
Bob Baldocehi, who won the Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate cham
pionship in 1953.
Also included were several of
Stanford's past football heroes-
Norm Manoogian, Emery Mitchell
and Bob Burkie.
One Returning
One man, Ty Miller, has return
ed to the team from last year's
squad. Lunny mentioned also that
sophomore heavyweight Trev
Grimm scored a second-round
knockout in the Cal match to pro
vide Stanford's only win.

pounders Dave Firth and Bob
Raney, 165-pounders Bill Vaugh
ey, Dick Bolen and George Simp
son, 147-pounders Roger Gertme
nian and Steve Gregg, 139-pound
