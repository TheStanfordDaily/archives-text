# Stan Musial Signs $100,000 Contract
## 
### 
Stan Musial yesterday signed
his 1958 contract for $100,000,
enough to make even bossman
Gussie Busch flub a line.
Stan The Man, who won his
seventh batting crown at .351
last season, became the highest
player in National League his
tory after his $20,000 raise by the
St. Louis Cardinals.
Only Ted Williams of the Bos
ton Red Sox will make more in
1958.
