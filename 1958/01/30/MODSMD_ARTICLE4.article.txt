# Wind, Rain Nix Satellite Try
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/P)
Winds up to 140 miles an hour,
liberally laced with rain, washed
out the Army's chances of
launching the Jupitcr-C satellite
rocket yesterday.
But today is another day. The
Army is known to be primer! for
its venture into space. Likely
only a few hours of better weath
er would he needed to bring
about an all-out launching try.
The Weather Bureau forecast
was for partly cloudy skies to
day, with lighter winds.
The terrific gales that wiped
out any hope of a launching yes
terday wore in the upper alti
tudes.
A six-foot-thick lube of metal
more than 70 feet long, such as
the Jupitcr-C, could be sheared
apart by such winds.
At the very least, the rocket
might be buffeted so far out of
the altitude it must maintain
in order to put its satellite aloft
â€”that its departure from course
could not be corrected.
Even down on the ground,
gusts were whipping past the
launching tower at 20-30 miles an
hour. Subjected to such wind
forces before it could attain any
momentum at all, the unsup
ported rocket might be unable to
withstand them.
Also serious were drainage
problems in the rain-swept
launching area.
