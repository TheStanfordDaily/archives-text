## Position on Evidence, Penalties, Confidential Proceedings Clarified 
### Judicial Council Members JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROCEDURE CLARIFIED 
(editor's Nolc: Judicial Council, "in an attempt to clarify some
of <lie misunderstandings prevalent on campus concerning the
Judicial Council and its procedure," has submitted to The Daily an
explanation of its current rules of procedure. Following 1 is the
second installment, clarifying the rules which were printed yes
terday.

Yesterday's Daily published the complete rules of procedure under
which Judicial Council operates. We feel, however, that, a further
explanation should be made concerning certain misconceptions aris
ing from rumor, erroneous information and incomplete reporting.
Confidential Nature of Cases
Judicial Council cases arc kept confidential solely for the protec
tion of those involved, regardless of their guilt or innocence. Some
students advocate that hearings bo held publicly. We wonder how
many would care to have their names printed in prominent local news
papers as being involved in a Fundamental Standard or Honor Code
case. All too often, a person's innocence would be forgotten; the fact
that he was involved would remain clearly in people's minds. Those
convicted of violations would find it difficult to return to the Stanford
community with the facts of their case public knowledge. As it now
stands, approximately 74 per cent of students suspended for violations
have returned to the University and unobtrusively resumed their
st udies.
Evidence
Cases are brought to the attention of Judicial Council by three
methods: 1 > a student reports himself; 2) a student reports another
student; and 3) a faculty member reports a student. In the first case
investigation to prove guilt is unnecessary. In the latter two cases
as much evidence as possible is accumulated through talks with fac
ulty members involved, statements from the accused, the accuser,
their suggested witnesses and material evidence. Defendants are
always given a chance to explain conflicting evidence. When con
flicting evidence cannot be resolved, the decision is in favor of the
defendant. Hearsay evidence and rumor carry no weight in Council
decisions. Council considers one case at a time, not "eight cases—
concurrently."
Penalties
In penalizing those found guilty. Council is influenced by the
seriousness of the violation and the degree of cooperation shown by
the defendant. Second convictions are always considered more seri
ous; consequently the penalties are heavier. (With reference to the
ROTC student mentioned in Tuesday's Daily, his suspension was the
result of a second Honor Code conviction. This second suspension
made it impossible for him to graduate in five years. He thereby
deprived himself of his commission.)
Council decisions, being recommendations to the Dean, are not
final until they are approved by him. Therefore, if he refers a case
back to us for further study, it is considered a continuation of the
original trial, not a retrial. Double jeopardy—i.e., a second trial for
a person originally found innocent whose case has been given the
final word of approval by the appropriate Dean—cannot occur under
the present judicial system. No Stanford student has ever been
"acquitted of an offense and then, as many as two or three months
later, been retried and found guilty."
It has been said that our judicial system breaks down because it
is a government of men and not of laws. However, the Judicial Coun
cil rules of procedure, as printed in yesterday's Daily, prove that
Council proceedings are r uled by laws, not by personal whims and
prejudices.
