# 'He Who Gets Slapped' A Hit
## 
### Camille Petersen 
William Davis dominated the
scenes in the Stanford Players'
presentation of "He Who Gets
Slapped" which opened at Memo
rial Audilorlum last night.
Davis, as Maneini, played the
role of the impoverished noble
man scheming to marry his
daughter Consuela (Jane Schi
melpfenig) to a wealthy baron,
with a certain dash and conveyed
his understanding of the part to
the audience with ease.
Second in command in major
roles was Robert Dietle, Dielle
portrays the aristocrat who gives
up his life of luxury and joins
the circus as a clown, known as
Me Who Gets Slapped He for
short. From his first words, his
voice holds I he attention of Ihc
audience. While on the whole
convincing in Hie part, he some
limes seems to force the action.
One of Dietle's outstanding
scenes is when he first describes
the birth of Venus to Consuela,
telling her ho is describing her
birth. The changing moods of
this scene are convincingly well
done.
Miss Schimelpfenig gives a

freshness to Iho otherwise some
what heavy play in her role of
Consuela, the bareback rider with,
whom He falls in love.
James Freiburger does an cx
eellent job in his role as Papa
Briquet, manager of the circus.
His movements and speech come
with ease and never give the au
dience the uncomfortable feeling
that he is slipping out of charac
ter.
Evelyn Dees turns in a vary
ing realistic performance of 7A
nida, wife of the manager, who
falls in love with Bezano, the
bare-back rider.
As usual Robert Lehrer seems
to enjoy his role, and does a pood
job wiih the lines provided by
the playwright for Baron Re
gnard, the rich older man Con
sucla's father has selected to
marry his daughter.
Lair Parent as the head clown,
Jackson, also is most enjoyable,
right down to the sun on the seat
of his pants.
Costumes and lighting by Ed
Chavez and Paul Landry respec
tively are very well done.
Settings were designed by
Sterling Huntley.

marry his daughter.
Lair Parent as the head clown,
Jackson, also is most enjoyable,
right down to the sun on the seat
of his pants.
Costumes and lighting by Ed
Chavez and Paul Landry respec
tively are very well done.
Settings were designed by
Sterling Huntley.

William Davis dominated the
scenes in the Stanford Players'
presentation of "He Who Gets
Slapped" which opened at Memo
rial Audilorlum last night.
Davis, as Maneini, played the
role of the impoverished noble
man scheming to marry his
daughter Consuela (Jane Schi
melpfenig) to a wealthy baron,
with a certain dash and conveyed
his understanding of the part to
the audience with ease.
Second in command in major
roles was Robert Dietle, Dielle
portrays the aristocrat who gives
up his life of luxury and joins
the circus as a clown, known as
Me Who Gets Slapped He for
short. From his first words, his
voice holds I he attention of Ihc
audience. While on the whole
convincing in Hie part, he some
limes seems to force the action.
One of Dietle's outstanding
scenes is when he first describes
the birth of Venus to Consuela,
telling her ho is describing her
birth. The changing moods of
this scene are convincingly well
done.
Miss Schimelpfenig gives a

freshness to Iho otherwise some
what heavy play in her role of
Consuela, the bareback rider with,
whom He falls in love.
James Freiburger does an cx
eellent job in his role as Papa
Briquet, manager of the circus.
His movements and speech come
with ease and never give the au
dience the uncomfortable feeling
that he is slipping out of charac
ter.
Evelyn Dees turns in a vary
ing realistic performance of 7A
nida, wife of the manager, who
falls in love with Bezano, the
bare-back rider.
As usual Robert Lehrer seems
to enjoy his role, and does a pood
job wiih the lines provided by
the playwright for Baron Re
gnard, the rich older man Con
sucla's father has selected to
marry his daughter.
Lair Parent as the head clown,
Jackson, also is most enjoyable,
right down to the sun on the seat
