# LASSAU Will Probe Judicial Processes
## Approves President Sterling's Statements on SU Athletic Policy 
### Rich Brown, Associate Editor 
ASSU Legislature last night took double-barreled action by setting
up a committee to investigate the Judicial Council rules of procedure
and passing a resolution concurring with University policy in regard
to the Pacific Coast Conference.
After debating proposed amendments to Judicial Council's rules of

procedure and finally referring
that matter to committee, Legis
lature passed a motion by Daily
Editor Wally Simpson to set up
the investigatory committee.
Members of the committee are
ASSU President Jim Messingcr,
Men's Council chairman Gordon
Tinker, Women's Council chair
man Myrna Kelley, and Legisla
ture members Pat Doherty, Don
Crocker, Eric Smith and Jan Ar
thur.
Rules Buried
Crocker, the Law School repre
sentative to LASSU, was named
chairman of the committee. In
addition to investigating the pro
cedures rules, the committee
plans to study relevant letters
published in The Daily.
During earlier discussion Men's
Council chairman Tinker noted
that his council's rules of proce
dure had been "buried in the
files" until only recently, when
they were rediscovered.
Some confusion resulted, he
said, because two copies — both
undated—were found which dif
fered slightly. Tinker empha
sized, however, that none of the
procedural rules had been vio
lated during the time the rule
pamphlets were unknown.
Approves Announcement
Regarding PCC, Legislature
voted to approve President Ster
ling's announcement of Dec. 13
and to concur with the Board of

man Myrna Kelley, and Legisla
ture members Pat Doherty, Don
Crocker, Eric Smith and Jan Ar
thur.
Rules Buried
Crocker, the Law School repre
sentative to LASSU, was named
chairman of the committee. In
addition to investigating the pro
cedures rules, the committee
plans to study relevant letters
published in The Daily.
During earlier discussion Men's
Council chairman Tinker noted
that his council's rules of proce
dure had been "buried in the
files" until only recently, when
they were rediscovered.
Some confusion resulted, he
said, because two copies — both
undated—were found which dif
fered slightly. Tinker empha
sized, however, that none of the
procedural rules had been vio
lated during the time the rule
pamphlets were unknown.
