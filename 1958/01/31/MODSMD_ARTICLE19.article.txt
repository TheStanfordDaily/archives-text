As THF. I AST issuf. of Volume 132 goes 1« press,
1, as editor, would like to address a few public
remarks to my successor.
It is indeed a rewarding experience, Stew, to
be editor of this college newspaper. It is a
time-consuming job, it is true. Hut you will
consider your time as having been well spent.
More important, however, is that being editor
is assuming great responsibility.
You will be responsible to your readers, to
your University, your staff—and especially to
yourself. The Daily will in no small measure
reflect yourself, your opinions and your phi
losophy.
1 do not step down without the assurance
that you will carry out your responsibilities.
And the stall' would not have elected you had
they also not had the same trust. The office and
desk are now yours. 1 wish you the best success
in your endeavors.

Now 1 would like to say a few words to the
staff of Volume 1.32. ou've been a good staff,
a wonderful staff. on have come through in
every crisis and every emergency. We've not
missed a deadline.
You have a new editor now. If you put forth
as much effort for him as you did for me, The
Stanford Daily will continue to he a good
paper. After all, it is you who put Ihe paper
out.
To our readers 1 would like to give my
appreciation for the interest you have shown
in The Daily by your letters and your com
ments. Yon have shown a remarkable amount
of patience with us. We've tried to please as
many of you as we could. Unfortunately, we
couldn't please all of you. Hut you've been a
great audience, nevertheless.
Well, Stew, The Daily is in your hands now.
Guide it well.
