Student-Run Star Chamber
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily is to he complimented for bringing
our student-run Star Chamber out into the open.
Evidently, some people fail to realize that if our
student "courts" are to have as much power as
I hoy do, then we should he entitled to all the prac
ticable rights that the American legal system pro
vides. These include Ihe right of the accused to
face his accuser, unanimous vote to be required
for conviction, and that the court not make up its
mind until all the facts are in. It certainly also
includes the basic principle thai a finding of inno
cent is final.
As you indicate, the Judicial Council operates
as a pseudo grand jury. But I never until now
have heard of a grand jury which could try a
case—this is or was a Star Chamber.
Students should not have the power to throw
their contemporaries out cf here unless they give
them the rights given us in this country. Unless
our parodies on courts immediately revamp their
procedures, a referendum should be started to
devoid them of power.
The basic fault is that Ihe privacy which was
supposed to protect has resulted in sloppiness and
unfairness. If all trials were public, we might get
a chance to see what our vaunted courts call
justice.

Proposed Procedural Changes
Editor, The Daily:
Dean Winbigler is quoted in Wednesday's Daily
as saying the present judicial system is effective;
ibat he is positive no innocent student has been
found guilty in the last eight years. This is per
haps an inaccurate quotation, for surely he is
aware that an innocent person was found guilty
in the case described in my previous letter early
this fall [printed Tuesday], He is no doubt think
ing of the later reversal of this decision. I say
that if the present system were effective, the
original decision would have been correct.
As a student, I feel I am in a better position to
judge how close-knit the Stanford student body is
Ihan is Dean Winbigler. I say that it is no more
close-knit than Main Street, U.S.A., and that I
would not care to be judged by Main Street and
Mrs. Grundy under the system operative at Stan
ford.
I propose the following procedure to help in
sure that no more cases be handled as was the
one I described:
1) When a person is first contacted, the council
must notify him specifically and in full detail of
the reason why, so that he may have time to
gather evidence. An accused person should have
as much time for this as does the accuser. The
council should further tell him that he may
gather evidence to present at the trial.
2) Hearsay evidence shall not be admitted.
3) In a trial the accused must again be told the
specific charge and the exact evidence against
him. Preferably he should face the accuser. (This
is not incompatible with a secret trial.) If not,
he should be given a word-for-word transcription
of the evidence and be allowed to cross-examine
witnesses. The accuser cannot be assumed to be
completely disinterested, even though he should
try to be.
4) A trial shall be open if the defendant so
requests. The dean and council members say
secrecy protects the innocent, but who has a
better right to decide his best interests than the
person on trial? Stanford students are supposed
ly mature and capable of making valid decisions
for themselves. This, in fact, must be a premise
of the Honor Code, Why should one keep up the
larce of hiding the identity of people tried during
the trial when a present Women's Council mem
ber has told her roommate - who has told others
the name of the person involved in the case I
described?
5) Council members must make no statements
concerning a person's possible guilt or innocence
except in giving the verdict. It is difficult to be
lieve council members are going to extremes to
assume every defendant is innocent when (hey
make statements such as, "We know you're
guilty."
It is quite possible these measures would re
duce the number of people accused of Honor Code
violations. I consider it also quite possible this
would prove to be a good thing.
Barlwira Reek with
Editor's Note: Judicial Council only recom
mends. Officially, a case is not closet! until re
viewed by the dean. The case of the person
described in your letter was referred back to
the council by the dean —thus she was never
"officially" found guilty.

Basic Changes Called For
Editor, The Daily:
When the judicial fairness story first appeared,
I was afraid the issue would be allowed to just
blow over, with none of the necessary basic
changes in our justice system being made. Now
that official approval of the present situation has
been given by Dean Winbigler, and the criticism
of the system has been "answered," the danger
from apathy is very great. This letter is not for
the sake of argument, but to show that the sys
tem's defenders have not answered the criticism
at all, and that basic changes are called for.
Dean Winbigler mentions the "integrity" of the
councils. 1 don't question this, but the fairness
of their decisions depends also on their good judg
ment, which certainly is not perfect. Surely the
dean would not contend that ihe judgment of the
councils is so perfect that defendants need not he
allowed to answer every detail of the testimony
of witnesses against him.
The same applies to the integrity of the "dis
interested" informers. The main purpose of cross
examination of witnesses is not to "ascertain the
truthfulness of witnesses" that is, to determine
their honesty—but to determine the accuracy of
their testimony and to ascertain which testimony
they are sure is accurate and which appeared to
be so. This can only be made certain when the
accused can face his accuser.
How can the dean ignore the thousands upon
thousands of court cases in which two or more
witnesses have honestly been "certain" of contra
dictory "facts"? The reason these flaws have
been found is that all possible witnesses have
been called on (as was not the case in the example
in Tuesday's Daily) and have been exposed to
cross-examination (which is never the case under
our present system). I remind Dean Winbigler
that Stanford is not unique in assuming that wit
nesses tell the truth ("Do you swear to tell . . ."
.etc.); we are unique only in assuming that testi
mony by those witnesses is perfect and should be
accepted at face value.
Until a defendant is proven guilty by conclusive
evidence, he is innocent and his testimony is as
valid as his accuser's. He was closer to the scene
and knows more accurately what happened, and
is a darn sight more interested in how the case
comes out. His testimony should be given the
benefit of any existing doubt. This does not mean
that a plea of "not guilty" would bring automatic
acquittal—it only means that proof, subject to
answer from the accused, would be required for
conviction.
"Secrecy will not injure the innocent, because
the innocent will be acquitted." This assumes
that the system is perfect, to prove the system's
perfection. Dean Winbigler presumes to know
the defendant's interests belter than the defend
ant does. Does he doubt the "integrity" of the
councils (which he so forcefully asserted) so
much that he fears they would give in to pres
sures (which should not be forthcoming from a
group with all that integrity) from the student
body if the trials were public? If not, then why
not let the defendant have an open court if he
feels it is necessary for his fair treatment? Dean
Craig seems to see the flaw in his colleague's
reasoning, but is unwilling to press his views on
the point.
Chairman Tinker seems to be afraid that the
number of cases reported would drop if things
were public. Where did the integrity that insures
honest testimony go— the same integrity on which
the Fundamental Standard and the Honor Code
are based? Did it go to the same place that the
integrity of Dean Winbigler's councils went when
he considered making those proceedings public
which defendants desire to have so?
My criticism is not directed principally at Dean
Winbigler, but at the inertia to which he is con
tributing that can prevent the active reform that
is called for. If I am ever brought to trial (and
1 might be; the girl referred to in Tuesday's Daily
sounded just as innocent as I), I want a fair trial,
not a kangaroo court that will tell a girl, "Please
confess; we know you're guilty," and then, when
a little legitimate evidence is forced on them, find
her innocent.

A Detailed Answer
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily and many members of the student
body are fond of making reference to "due proc
ess of law," "democracy," "constitutional guar
antees," etc. This brings to mind a problem that
exists here at Stanford.
The primary means of communicat ion and pub
licity for students is,The Daily. There is only one
Stanford Daily, and if you want to write a letter
to the students you can't very well send it to the
"Paly" Times. Under this system the only means
of answering an accusation or a misquote is

through the very persons who originally made
Ihe accusation or misquote. This seems to indi
cate a lack of student justice. Even if they don't
change the wording of a letter to the editor, I hey
still choose the heading, the placement and the
time when Ihey will print the letter-.
The Daily is fully aware of the agreement by
Ihe Council to confidence in all cases, and thai
the letter they printed on the first page of Tues
day's paper cannot be answered in the same man
ner in which it was written, because this would
involve violation of that confidence. Further, Ihe
editors would he wise to check the accuracy of
such a letter, and when they find that Ihe person
who wrote il received her information second
hand. and was not actually in on the case, they
might consider leaving it in the letters-to-the
editor column.
The appearance of the letter in conjunction
with a prejudiced article, under libelous head
lines, calls for a clarification hy the Council. This
is an attempt to put the Council on the defensive.
It puts it in the unfair position thai it has no
guarantee how the answer will be placed or what
the headlines will be, and it cannot give specific
examples or go into details without revealing con
fidential material.
I'm not saying Ihe Council is completely with
out fault or that students don't have the right lo
question its policy. By all means, I'm in favor of
questions and discussion, and maybe someone has
a constructive idea. Whal I do object to is Ihe
method of accusation used.
I would like to clarify a few points and give
some reasons for present policy.
In one paragraph of his article, Roger Folsom
stated thai the Council suspended an ROTC stu
dent, causing him to lose his commission. The
defendanl in question was appearing before the
Council for the third time. In the first case he
was acquitted due to his misunderstanding of the
application of the Honor Code in the class. In Ihe
second case, in a different class, he was found
guilty of collaboration on homework which in
cluded an Honor Code statement. lie was given
an F and suspended for one quarter. Last fall Ihe
student was back in school and was turned in
again, from another class (by the instructor), on
a charge similar to the second case. He was
found guilty and was suspended for two quarters.
By standards of past Councils and of other
schools this was extreme leniency. Roger Folsom
was aware of this and still wrote the article in
such a manner that il appealed to the student
body that the Council was crucifying defendants.
I would like to know how Ihe Council is to blame
if a student with this record loses-his self-respect.
The letter written by Barbara Beckwith was
written about a case which took place while 1 was
chairman of Men's Council. I think I can make
some factual statements based on my presence
at the trial:

The letter written over the summer was from
the Dean's office. The Dean referred the case to
the Council and did know what was involved.
The Council was not trying eight cases concur
rently and has never done so. Frequently more
than one case will he tried in one evening in order
lo leave some evenings for Council members to
study, but these are not concurrent.
The accuser did not suddenly remember any
facts at the time of the trial. The testimony was
based on two written statements made at the end
of spring quarter, immediately following the
final, and turned over to the instructor.
Before the case took place I contacted the pro
fessor and requested the tests in question. The
instructor seemed unable to find them and told
me he didn't know where they were. It later
turned out thai there was a misunderstanding
whether the test was the lab final or the lecture
final. The correct rests were obtained later, and
the Council reversed ils decision on the basis of
this evidence before a recommendation was sub
mitted to the Dean; therefore the case had not
been closed.
There were some misunderstandings in this
case, and the Council was aware of this. No mat
ter what system we use, there will be this possi
bility, but that does not mean the Council is
wholly responsible for the misunderstanding.
There were many aspects of the case Barbara
refers to that I would like to discuss which would
explain a lot of things to the student body, but
they would reflect on other persons involved.
The names of witnesses are kepi secret because
there have been occasions when defendants did
find out who (heir accuser was and resorted to
gangster tactics. Open trials would simplify the
job ill the Council in a number of ways. For one
thing, they wouldn't gel as many cases. I think
th«' studenl body would be better off if they knew
more about some of the cases and the persons
involved, but I also think a defendant has the
right to realize his mistake, accept his punish
ment and become a better person through ihe
experience without getting a public smear on his
record. The cases which the student body would
learn the most from would never be made public
if the option were with the defendant.
People should consider all sides to this ques
tion. A number of suggestions I have heard
might be put into effect on a trial basis. Perhaps
different rules should be set up for Honor Code
cases and Fundamental Standard cases, or more
distinction between cases handled by Men's Coun
cil and Women's Council. The important thing
to remember is that the members of the Councils
have seen many different types of cases and are
aware ol' many things that a defendant will leave
out when he presents his case to a roommate.
