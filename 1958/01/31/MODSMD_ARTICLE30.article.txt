# THE Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
humor at llie Banquet
A fow random quotes from the really funny PALO ('lull's Mil
lion Dollar Banquet which I had llie privilege to attend Tuesday
night at Rickey's:
Don Manoukian, Hie Indians' rough-tough guard and most valu
able lineman in the Shrine game, was introduced as "tin* Peninsula's
most educated bartender." Seems that Don's 1 working up El ('amino
at the Stein Room. Manouk came right hack with a fow stories of
his own, and got one of the night's biggest hands from the fjOO sports
fans present.
From Waller Mails, S.F. Giants publicity man: "Willi Hie players
Taylor left lor him, .lack Curtice'll have to be funny."
From Cal coach Pete Elliott: "The extra point's been real dull —
except for Chuck and nit*. I'll go for the kick when we're ahead and
the two points when we're behind."
From Curtice, when introduced to Elliott: "There's no one finer
than Pete. I knew him and his underhand methods on the golf
course."
Elliott to Curtice: "Why did you leave Utah with Crosscup still
around?"
Curtice: "I've been asking myself and I can't give an answer yet."
Curtice got in one on Manoukian, too. Says the new head man,
"I sent my assistants, Sam Boyd and Tommy Prothro, out looking
for another tackle for our Shrine team, and then I bumped into
Mariouk. I asked Taylor it he could count to ten without taking off

his shoes, and Taylor said, 'He's'
OK.' So I say to Manouk, 'Would
you like to play with us?' And
he says 'When do we cat?' Then
fin* next day in practice, Ma
nook's pulling on( on some run
it ing plays and I ask Boyd how
In* likes the way Manouk runs.
And Boyd says, 'He ain't run
ning, he's rolling.'
Another Curtieism on how his
West team won the Shrine game:
"You • read all about those All-
American hoys from the Mast,
hut then some of my country
hoys get out there on that field
and they figure they ain't no dif
ferent."
One of the night's biggest huz
zahs came when Oregon State
assistant coach Dick Twenge said
with a straight face (almost) that
"Joe Francis, like our other play
ers, came I<> Oregon State for its
fine educational opportunities."
Francis was on hand to receive
the Pop Warner Award as the

West Coast's outstanding senior of the 1957 grid season.
Most of the Stanford football staff was at the affair, plus Howie
Dallmar, Payton Jordan, Bud Finger, Dutch Fehring in his capacity
as baseball coach, and Don Liebendorfer. Pete Knietovic got intro
duced as the man who told Clark Shaughnessy that Frankie Albert
was left-handed.
. . . and al the Press Conference
There were plenty of choice comments at the pre-banquet press
conference, too. Question to Curtice: "Have you ever considered
quitting? Answer: "Yes, for 27 years."
About the "Cactus Jack" tag which has followed him here, Cur
tice said it's pretty much of a myth. "Some Utah fellow invented it
when I came from Texas. I've been called that much more out here
than I ever was- at Utah."
Curtice said Jack, Jr., a high school junior now, might stay in
Salt Lake City for his senior year of prep football. "He's captain
elect of his team, and 1 wouldn't want to take that away from him,"
said Dad.
Add on the son—he wanted to come to Stanford a year ago. but
now that Pop's the coach, he might change his mind.
* n H
MISCELLANEOUS—What happened to Stanford in the pro foot
ball draft? Nobody, but nobody, got tapped . . . and counting the
November rounds, 361 players were named. Some, like Chuck Shea,
weren't interested; and Jackie Douglas has shown leanings toward
tennis. But wasn't anyboy else thought of? . . . Speaking of tennis,
ex-Indian Jack Frost walked off with the Miami Invitational title
last Sunday. He's been touring the Florida circuit, and been knock
ing off a good share of players seeded above him.



THE NEW HEAD MAN
He "Persuaded" Manouk
