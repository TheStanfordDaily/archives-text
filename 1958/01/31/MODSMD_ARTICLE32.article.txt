On to Corvullis
Saturday evening Ihe Indians
move on to Corvallis, Ore., where
they'll meet one of Ihe league's
strong contenders Ihe Oregon
State Beavers . The Heavers have
had their ups and downs lately,
but they're still using Ihe same
starting lineup of Dave Gambee,

Gary Coble, Kon Nan.son, Jim An
derson anfl Leo Harman that trim
med the Cards ai Stanford Pa
vilion just 11 days ago.
Alter a day of rest on Sunday,
the Stanford hoopsters make the
short trip to Eugene, where on
Monday night they play the errat
ic University of Oregon Ducks.
The Webfoots are led by scoring
ace Charlie Franklin, who ap
pears to have the same typo of
hot and cold streaks thai his team
has.
The games 1 h is week end should
tfive coach Howie Dallmar and all
Stanford followers a good indica
tion of who is and who isn't going
to be playing regularly the rest
of t he season.
Maybe Ne\< Year
Dallmar has been nursing along
this year's team in hopes that the
experience gained by the younger
members of the squad will put
Stanford at the top next year.
If any of these sophomores and
juniors arc going to develop, they
should begin to show more defi
nite signs of it fairly soon.
Mike Tipton, John Stabler, Neal
Brockmeyer, Chris Burford, Jerry
Thuesen and John Arrillaga are
the sophomores who appear to be
at the crossroads. Each member
of this group has had his mo
ments of looking great, but un
fortunately they haven't been
often enough.
The leading junior basketeers—
Paul Neumann, Dick Haga, Doug
Warren and John Pi'lueger— have
shown in most cases some im
provement over last year, but
they still haven't nearly fulfilled
their potentials.
Tipton <o SluH
Stanford will probably start the
Washington game with Haga at
center, Neumann and Tipton at
guards, Arrillaga at one forward
and either Burford or Thuesen at
the other.
But if any of these starters does
not look impressive, he'll proba
bly find himself on the bench
come start of Saturday's game.
Dallmar expects to use all the
members of the squad at some
time during the three-game trip.
All of the tilts will be radioed
back to the campus via KCBS,
beginning at 8 p.m. each night.
