# Ruggers Host OC Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Pete Kmetovic's Stanford rug
gers will host the Olympic Club
tomorrow at 2 p.m. on the Indian
rugby field. The Cards will be
looking for their third straight
victory of the season.
The Peninsula Ramblers were
the victims both times the Tribe
has played this year, falling 10-3
and 12-5. The Winged-O fields a
rugged club each year and is ex
pected to give Kmetovic's squad
a strong battle.
