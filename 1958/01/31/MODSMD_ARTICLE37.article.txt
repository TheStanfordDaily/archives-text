## 
### 
A pair of teams about which
coach Dick Clegg frankly "knows
nothing" will invade the Pavilion
tonight and tomorrow for games
with the Stanford Braves.
The junior varsity will be in the
unfamiliar spot of playing in the
8 p.m. feature game each night
first against San Jose State's JV
squad and then against Hamilton
Air Force Base.
Clegg said he Heard that Hamil
ton fell to the Olympic Club by
(> points, but that he has been
unable to come up with any in
formation at all about San Jose.
As a result, he'll be playing
both games pretty much by ear,

waiting to see just what the op
ponents have to offer. Clegg
named a starting lineup of Phil
Joujon-Roche at center, Jim Weer
sing and Bob Bletcher at forwards
and Tom Crawford and Mason
Byles at guards.
