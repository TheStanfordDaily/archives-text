# 'Hoo-oo Hoo-oo' Went the Owl; 'Bang-Bang' Went the Gun
## Owl Finds Temporary Refuge in Mem Church; Tears Out Acoustical Insulation, Nests in Dome 
### Jack Winkler 
Many people go to Memorial Church to pray, sing or meditate, but
there is only one man who has ever fired a gun inside Mrs. Stan
ford's spiritual center.
His name is Roy Walley and he is the only man who can say he
has hunted an owl inside the church with a .22-caliber rifle and killed

it with one shot.
"It was around 1928," said Wal
ley, "and I was working in the
carpentry shop of the Corpora
tion Yard. There was an owl that
had made his nest high up in tlie
dome over the altar and had been
bothering the chaplain for some
time.
"Ho was tearing out the acous
tical insulation around the dome.
His favorite spot was right above
the President's seat and every
day there was a pile of dust in
the pew."
Chaplain David C. Gardner
called the Corp Yard and three
men, including Walley. came over
wilh an extension ladder to chase
the owl around. And it was most
ly chase, for whenever the men
got near the owl he flew away.
"I don't care if you have to
shoot him," said the irate chap
lain; "just get him out of here."
"One of the men went back to
Palo Alto to get his .22 rifle and
when he came back I was selected
to do the shooting because I was
the youngest. I was about 28 at
the time." said Walley.
"1 chased him up into the bal
cony of the right transept. I
crawled up to within 10 feet of
him and hit him with the first
shot. He just stood still for a few
seconds, then he fell down on my
arm. All in all, it took up a
couple of hours to get him."
Besides being the only man to
shoot a gun in Memorial Church,
Walley has had other interesting
connections with Stanford. He
worked off and on for the Uni
versity for 27 years in the Cor
poration Yard, Board of Athletic
Control and Engineer's office.
He left Stanford shortly after
the shooting to attend Polytech
nic College in Oakland and re
turned to help lay out Frost Am
phitheater and the extensive
steam pipe system in 1936.
Sam McDonald, who died last
autumn, left all his personal pos
sessions to Walley and Mike Pre
visalich, two of his close friends
in the Grounds Department.
Walley now lives in Los Altos
and works for the Navy Engi
neers in San Francisco.

shot. He just stood still for a few
seconds, then he fell down on my
arm. All in all, it took up a
couple of hours to get him."
Besides being the only man to
shoot a gun in Memorial Church,
Walley has had other interesting
connections with Stanford. He
worked off and on for the Uni
versity for 27 years in the Cor
poration Yard, Board of Athletic
Control and Engineer's office.
He left Stanford shortly after
the shooting to attend Polytech
nic College in Oakland and re
turned to help lay out Frost Am
phitheater and the extensive
steam pipe system in 1936.
Sam McDonald, who died last
autumn, left all his personal pos
sessions to Walley and Mike Pre
visalich, two of his close friends
in the Grounds Department.
Walley now lives in Los Altos
and works for the Navy Engi
neers in San Francisco.
Many people go to Memorial Church to pray, sing or meditate, but
there is only one man who has ever fired a gun inside Mrs. Stan
ford's spiritual center.
His name is Roy Walley and he is the only man who can say he
has hunted an owl inside the church with a .22-caliber rifle and killed

it with one shot.
"It was around 1928," said Wal
ley, "and I was working in the
carpentry shop of the Corpora
tion Yard. There was an owl that
had made his nest high up in tlie
dome over the altar and had been
bothering the chaplain for some
time.
"Ho was tearing out the acous
tical insulation around the dome.
His favorite spot was right above
the President's seat and every
day there was a pile of dust in
the pew."
Chaplain David C. Gardner
called the Corp Yard and three
men, including Walley. came over
wilh an extension ladder to chase
the owl around. And it was most
ly chase, for whenever the men
got near the owl he flew away.
"I don't care if you have to
shoot him," said the irate chap
lain; "just get him out of here."
"One of the men went back to
Palo Alto to get his .22 rifle and
when he came back I was selected
to do the shooting because I was
the youngest. I was about 28 at
the time." said Walley.
"1 chased him up into the bal
cony of the right transept. I
crawled up to within 10 feet of
him and hit him with the first
shot. He just stood still for a few
seconds, then he fell down on my
arm. All in all, it took up a
couple of hours to get him."
