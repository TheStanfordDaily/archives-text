# Senate Authorizes Bill For New Missile Bases
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (A 3 )â€”The Senate yesterday rushed through a bill
authorizing $549,570,000 for space age defense bases. Senator Jack
son (D.-Wash.) declared. "The American people should realize this
is only the beginning of a very large defense authorization program."
The legislation would permit an immediate start on new launching

sites for ballistic missiles, great
er dispersal facilities for planes
of the Strategic Air Command
and similar construction proj
ects.
Coming up behind the authori
zation bill is an emergency $1,-
410,000,000 defense appropriation
measure. This will provide the
actual money for the construc
tion work as well as funds for a
bigger missile program and more
atomic submarines.
The $549,570,000 bill, passed by
voice vote, now goes back to the
House, which passed it several
weeks ago, for action on several
changes made by the Senate. The
amount of money authorized is
not in dispute.
S c n a to r Stcnnis (D.-Miss.),
floor manager for the bill, criti
ciszed the locations planned for
some of the bases because he said
they were close to large popula
tions or industrial areas. He said
one proposed base already is "a
vital strategic target" and that
adding an SAC squadron there
woul be "doubling the attractive
ness of the installation as a tar
get."
