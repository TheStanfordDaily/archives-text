of determining personality in ad

ri e t y of people," Brooks com
mented.
When questioned regarding
preferences of admission, he said
that, "things being equal, pref

No Increase
Brooks foresees no differences
in admission requirements, nor
any increase in undergraduate en

items considered by prospective
faculty members," said Brooks.
The latter two are more than sat
