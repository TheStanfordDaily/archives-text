### John Anderson 
Astounding froe throw accuracy, effective bottling up of tho OSC
offense, and the superb play of five ironmcn arc what did it Stan
ford G'J, Oregon State 57.
The Indians sank 33 of 11 attempts from the gift lino and that was
tho big scoring difference for tlie evening as (lie Beavers out-scored

Stanford in the field goal depart
ment 23 to 18.
Forward Jerry Thuesen led
Stanford's free throw barrage
wilh 12 gifters, Paul Neumann
followed with 10 and Dick Haga
had 7. Thirty-three of the In
dians' 09 points came via the free
throw line.
Harmon Out
Oregon State played the game
without the services of star
guard Lee Harmon, but a factor
which hurt the Beavers even
more was tight Indian defense.
Haga did an especially effec
tive job in defensing Gambee.
The All FCC forward was held to
seven points in the first half,
three of these coming as free
throws.
Gambee started hitting in the
second half and was instrumental
in cutting the Stanford lead of 17
points down to eight. However,
by this time it was too late to
turn the tide.
Nanson Consistent
The only OSC player who
scored consistently throughout
the game was Ken Nanson who
totaled 20. Gambee was high with
23.
The starting lineup of Neu
mann and Warren at guards,
Haga at center and Theusen and
Arrillaga at forwards, played
most of the game. Staler replaced
Warren with four minutes left
and Burford came in for Neu
mann with nine seconds remain
ing.
High for Stanford were Neu
mann and Thuesen with 18 points
each. Arrillaga had 14 and Haga
counted 13.
Close First Half
The tilt was close throughout
the first half with Stanford's lead
ranging around four points. OSC
cut it down to one with seconds
remaining, but Theusen's bucket
from 15 feet out gave the Indians
a 30-27 half-time lead.
The Cards moved further out
in front in the second period
mainly through the shooting of
Arillaga. Stanford's leading
scorer seemed to regain his early
season form in scoring 13 points
in the second half.
It was Dad's Day at Corvallis
but the papas had little to cheer
about except for Oregon State's
only lead at 1-0. Haga and Neu
mann countered with gift shots
to give the Indians a 2-1 lead,
which they never relinquished.
Stay Ahead
Nanson brought the Beavers to
within one point on a lay-up to
make it 8-7, but Thuesen plunked
in two free throws to put Ihe In
dians in front by three. This was
the general trend of first-half
play. If Stanford couldn't make
the two-pointers, they were saved
by gift tosses.
Free throws by Thuesen, Ar
rillaga and Neumann and two
long jump shots by Neumann
gave the Cards their biggest lead
at 27-21. However, two quick
buckets by Nanson and a free
throw by Gambee closed the gap
to one. Then Thuesen hit for two
with 10 seconds remaining.
Oregon State switched from a
man-to-man to a /one defense in
