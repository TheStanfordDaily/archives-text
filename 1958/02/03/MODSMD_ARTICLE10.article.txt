Nixon
Vice-President Nixon, obvious
ly happy about the successful or
biting of an American satellite,
yesterday urged Soviet Russia
and other nations to join the
United States in "international
control of outer space."
"Working together for peace,
the Russian and American peo
ple will accomplish far more for
themselves and the world than
they would in a race for military
supremacy in outer space," Nixon
said in an interview.
Jackson
Senator Jackson (D. - Wash.)
said yesterday the United States
should be able to follow up its
successful launching of the first
made-in-U.S.A. earth satellite by
firing a rocket to the moon in a
few months.
However, U.S. scientists had
more immediate plans to try put
ting a second free world baby
moon into orbit. Even as the
Armys' Explorer satellite began
paying scientific dividends with
its automatic radio reports, both
the Army and the Navy looked
ahead to new launching attempts.
It was learned that the Navy's
satellite-carrying Vanguard rock
et is standing fully assembled in
its launching tower at Cape Ca
naveral, Fla., from where the Ex
plorer sped into space Friday
night.
