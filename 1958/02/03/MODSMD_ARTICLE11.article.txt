# Power Failure Blacks Campus, Portola Valley
## 
### 
Parts of the campus anrl areas to the west were without elec
trical power for about an hour last night when a Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. main line went out.
The failure cut off lights and appliances at (>:. r )3 p.m. Service
was finally restored to the campus 58 minutes later, at 7:31 p.m.
Quad and dormitory areas served by the University wore af
fected, but pr ivate residential areas of the campus, including Row
houses, continued receiving power.
Westriflge, Ladera, Alpine and Portola Valley areas also were
without power for 1 periods of 39 minutes to over an hour. Palo
Alto and Mcnlo Park were not affected.
The failure occurred in a 12,000-volt main line from Redwood
City, probably where it runs near Alpine Road, according to K. W.
Van Gundy, Peninsula district manager for the PG&E.
Exact cause of the failure had not been determined late last
night, The line runs through trees, and it is possible that strong
winds blew one tree down, breaking the line, Van Gundy said.
When the break occurred, an automatic trip-out cut power
from the line. After 1 PG&F crews determined where the break
occurred and where the affected areas were, they were able to
reroute power over- other- lines.
Service in the area immediately around the break had not been
restored by I) p.m.
Students stayed in long lines at Memorial Auditorium walling
to buy tickets for the Sunday Flicks.
Candles appeared in windows of a few dormitory rooms. At
The Daily, work on today's paper continued by flashlight.
Police and fire department communications were not affected.
Police radio communications, handled by the Palo Alto police and
.lust as electric power came on again, a fire alarm was turned
in from Wilbur' Ila 11. Pumper, ladder and squad trucks responded
to the alarm, which proved to he false as was one received from
Stern Hall about two minutes later.
