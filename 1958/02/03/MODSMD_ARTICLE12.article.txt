##

stolen bicycles was discussed last

tal Standard and Honor Code

"Borrowing" bicycles, either for
short trips or else for long periods
of time, is a great problem on
campus, the commission said.
The situation is complicated
when members of living groups
have agreements that everyone
can use everyone else's bicycle.
On occasion, students use nearby
bicycles without asking owners.
Violation of Standard
The commission originally mov
ed that "unauthorized use of bi
cycles is a violation of the Funda
mental Standard."
After considering that the un
authorized use of any personal
property is a violation of the
Standard, the commission passed
the following:
"Every person anrl organization
has the right to use his property
without the infringement of oth
ers. We believe that this principle
is in harmony with our concept of
the reasonable Stanford student
and therefore is an adequate ex
p r e s si on of the Fundamental
Standard."

The commission also made some
recommendations regarding the

that difficulties have arisen in 1 iv
ing groups with regard to house
wide use of available bicycles. We
suggest distinctive bicycle mark
ings so that members may deter
mine which bicycles are theirs and
which are not.
2 "The primary responsibility
of the user 1 is to make sure that
he has the authorization of the
owner.
"When there is not a meet
ing of the minds of the owner and
the user, the logical determination
of authorization rests with the
owner."
