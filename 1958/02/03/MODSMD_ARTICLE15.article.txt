# SRI's 'Big Dish' Antenna First in U.S. to Spot Moon

### Rosalie Richards 
Stanford Research Institute was first in the nation to make a
radio fix on the U.S. satellite "Explorer," carrying a payload of 30.8
pounds and orbiting around the globe every 113 minutes. Techni
cians spotted it with their "big dish" antenna. The Stanford Radio
Propagation Laboratory also reported picking up the signals.
Roy N. Griffin, director of the "Operation Moonwatch" team iri

Los Altos, said the satellite is so
small that "I doubt ii will ever be
seen with the naked eye, except
perhaps under the most ideal con
ditions."
If this occurs, it will be visible
only when the sun's rays reflect
off the metal "skin."
The steady whist le, which is be
ing transmitted on two frequen
cies, is difficult, though possible,
to receive. One transmitter is op
erating on 108.03 megacycles and
is expected to be operating for
two to three weeks. The other,
weaker signal is on 108 megacy
cles and should keep going for
two to three months. However,
only extremely sensitive receivers
will be able to pick up this latter
signal.
Planned Deliberately
Prof. O. G. Villard Jr. of the
Stanford Radio Propagation Labo
ratory believes that the selection
of a higher and more sensitive
radio frequency than the Rus
sians' Sputniks was planned de
liberately.
The wave lengths selected for
use by the Explorer will be less
affected by the upper atmosphere.
This will permit the United Slates
to gather more information on
cosmic rays and meteors.
Sputniks may collect more in
formation on the ionosphere, a re
gion from 50 to 250 miles above
the earth.
70 Per Cent Higher
Dr. Ronald Bracewell, also with
the Stanford Radio Propagation
Laboratory, noted that the Ex
plorer orbit is about 70 per cent
higher than the Sputniks, but he
pointed out that the Explorer has
about a 20 per cent variation from
the circular orbit.
The Sputniks depart 5 and 10
per cent from a true circle.
Bracewell believes this may
mean either that the Explorer
"wasn't aimed too well" or that
the satellite has a better chance
of remaining in the sky longer,
since it is at a higher altitude than
the Sputniks. He felt that it was
"not possible to say anything
about the lifetime of the satellite
at this time."
Eccentric Satellite
Bracewell said the most inter
esting aspect of the Explorer is its
behavior. "It is in orbit of higher
energy and is behaving much
more eccentrically, more ellipti
cally, than the other two." refer
ring to the satellite's climbs and
dips, which range between 200 and
2000 miles.
Bracewell explained that "there
are two possibilities for this: first,
that we aimed at a circular orbit,
in which any departure would be
inaccuracy; or, on the other hand,
if we were more concerned in get
ting the satellite up at any cost
and this might well have been the
caseâ€”we counteracted the need
for precision by giving it speed."
