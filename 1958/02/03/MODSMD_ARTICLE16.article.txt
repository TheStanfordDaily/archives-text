# Parity Party Poops
## 
### 
Stanford men, inciled by a
power failure and a cry of "On to
Branner," staged a parity raid
last night which brought hack
memories of a similar incident a
year ago.
Shortly before 7, lights wont
out in all the university dormito
ries, and Wilbur freshmen,
joined by a few upperclassmen,
poured out of their dormitories
and ran across the street to eel
a few souvenirs oT the night from
Branner women.
Sloshing over muddy lawns
and hurling taunts at faces peer
ing out from behind curtains,
i hey met meager success as some
brave frosh women tossed out
two unmentionables. An attempt
to rush the doors was stopped by
Wilbur sponsors and resident ad
visors, and the crowd retreated
leaving two broken Branner win
lows as the only damage.
The mob then directed their en
ergy toward cars driving in front
of Branner, particularly small
sports cars which could be picked
up. A strip of chrome from a
passing car was acquired by
some freshman as a trophy of his
prowess.
A combination of disorganiza
tion. power restoration and pre
cipitation finally dispersed the
celebrators. and the estimated IOC)
students returned to their rooms,
ready to study, provided with
some exciting news to write
home.
