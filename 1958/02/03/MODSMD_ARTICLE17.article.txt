# RUSSIAN PIANIST
## Gilels Gives Monumental Concert 
### Diana Smith 
When Russian pianist Emil Gi
lels made his San Francisco de
but at the War Memorial Opera
House Friday night, a capacity
audience was treated to an artis
tic experience beyond usual con
cert fare.
Opening with five Scarlatti so
natas, numbers 422, 449, 486, 256
and 395, Gilels gave immediate
assurance of near-perfect tech
nique. Each phrase received just
the dynamic emphasis proper to
its musical context. Gilel's pre
cision of touch and interpreta
tion showed to better advantage
in numbers 422, 486 and 395 than
in the more contemplative Sona
tas 449 and 256.
Gilels rendered a more monu
mental and less impassioned Bee
thoven Sonata Op. 57 ("Appas
sionata") than the interpretation
given it by most pianists.
Brilliant and Talented
When Gilels reaches full emo
tional and musical maturity his
Beethoven movement: Andante
con moto may achieve the seren
ity of full understanding, sur
passing its present mere quie
tude. Gilels is a brilliant, talent
ed and definitely first-rate pian
ist, but perhaps not yet a great
artist.
After intermission Gilels
played Debussy's Images, Series
No. 1: "Reflets dans I'eau,"
''Horn mage a Rameau" and
"Movement." He did not yield to
the temptation in Debussy t<>
lose sight of the whole piece in
executing particular passages.
His performance combined conti
nuity with dexterity.
Primeval Intensity
The recital concluded with
Stravinsky's special piano ar
rangement of his "Petrouchka,"
a vehicle well suited to Gilel's
talents. He played with almost:
primeval intensity and with full
understanding of Stravinsky's
particular kind of vision. Repeat
edly Gilels raised his forte yet.

Gilels received overwhelming

Gilels rendered a more monu
mental and less impassioned Bee
thoven Sonata Op. 57 ("Appas
sionata") than the interpretation
given it by most pianists.
Brilliant and Talented
When Gilels reaches full emo
tional and musical maturity his
Beethoven movement: Andante
con moto may achieve the seren
ity of full understanding, sur
passing its present mere quie
tude. Gilels is a brilliant, talent
ed and definitely first-rate pian
ist, but perhaps not yet a great
artist.
After intermission Gilels
played Debussy's Images, Series
No. 1: "Reflets dans I'eau,"
''Horn mage a Rameau" and
"Movement." He did not yield to
the temptation in Debussy t<>
lose sight of the whole piece in
executing particular passages.
His performance combined conti
nuity with dexterity.
Primeval Intensity
The recital concluded with
Stravinsky's special piano ar
rangement of his "Petrouchka,"
a vehicle well suited to Gilel's
talents. He played with almost:
primeval intensity and with full
understanding of Stravinsky's
particular kind of vision. Repeat

Gilels received overwhelming
acceptance in a standing ovation.
When Russian pianist Emil Gi

but at the War Memorial Opera
House Friday night, a capacity
audience was treated to an artis
tic experience beyond usual con
cert fare.
Opening with five Scarlatti so
natas, numbers 422, 449, 486, 256
and 395, Gilels gave immediate
assurance of near-perfect tech
nique. Each phrase received just
the dynamic emphasis proper to
its musical context. Gilel's pre
cision of touch and interpreta
tion showed to better advantage
in numbers 422, 486 and 395 than
in the more contemplative Sona
tas 449 and 256.
