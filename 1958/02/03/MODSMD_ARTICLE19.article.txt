# We Aim to Please
## 
### 
Tradition on Tin' Daily lias it that a new editor
writes his first editorial on his goals for the
volume, the moral obligations of a student
newspaper to its readers, and the ideals and
policies ol the paper in general.
However, we would like to think that suoh a
statement of policy is unnecessary (not to men
tion dull reading). We believe the policy of a
newspaper should not lie set down in so many
words. For one thing, we're reticent to set our
selves high, philosophical goals which we
would probably be unable to attain. That's the
way it usually turns out with such goals.

At any rate, we prefer the more realistic
course of letting our readers decide our policy.
A stated policy which is not adhered to, and
which is not reflected in our columns, is worth
less. Vie therefore leave it up to our readers
to determine what we stand for, and we hope
they will approve of it.
For the next four months our policy will he
expressed constantly, in all our articles and edi
torials, in a much more tangible form than it
could he here. And we'll "strive to please you
everv day. " 1
