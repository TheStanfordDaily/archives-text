# Seniors Launch Heritage Drive
## 
### 
The Class of '58 launches its
Heritage Fund drive today as fi()
seniors begin canvassing Palo
Alto area merchants for contribu
t ions.
The goal of the drive is $12,500,
to be used to provide full-tuition
scholarships for 12 outstanding
freshmen.
The Heritage Fund scholar
ships are being given in place of
the traditional class gift, accord
ing to drive co-chairmen Buzz
McCoy and Margo Lovendale.
The Heritage Fund was begun
by the Class of '5!) when they de
cided that scholarships would be
more worthwhile contributions to
the University than the tradition
al gifts. Support by local mer
chants has helped graduating
classes support the scholarship
fund.
