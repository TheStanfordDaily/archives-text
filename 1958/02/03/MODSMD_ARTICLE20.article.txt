Daily Complimented
Editor, The Daily:
1 want to compliment you and your staff for
what I consider to be a fine job. I am very much
in favor of the recent coverage of Stanford news,
such as the Stanford history series, the "expose"
of Mrs. Stanford's will and Ihe discussion of the
Honor Code administration .
It is much to your credit thai you are taking
the extra time to do the research necessary to
publish this sort of truly Stanford news, instead
of relying heavily on the wire service to fill the
paper with news which may easily be found else
where. I, for one, am very much in favor of this,
and sincerely hope that the staff of the new
volume will continue this policy.

To Restore llie Stanford Postmark
Editor, The Daily:
The news of the change of Ihe Stanford post
mark iscended upon me like a thunderclap.
Meddling with such a beloved tradition can only
be construed as a flagrant blow against the pres
tige of our Stanford community. II is an inde
cent measure perpetrated, no doubt, by a frus
trated mailman recently demoted from the main
Palo Alto office for stealing stamps from govern
ment pensions. This anarchist wreaks his re
venge on the world by changing our postmark.
Of course, my first concern was for my family.
How would they bear up under the news? What
would be their leaetion upon receiving a letter
postmarked Palo Alto? Not knowing the area,
perhaps they would assume that I, in a fit of
despair, had usurped Stanford for some Spanish
community, and with their Victorian candor visu
alize me eating tacos to the strains of a gypsy
guitar. Perhaps, with their Edwardian utility,
they would assume that I had never gone to Stan
ford at all and had squandered their tuition
money on baccarat and dog tracks.
The point is: Should we allow such a vicious
attack upon the very heart of our community, the
postmark, go with merely a maudlin murmur of
protest such as found in your inarticulate edi
torial of the 27th? Let us face this situation like
determined citizens. Let us use the most effective
weapon at hand. Community, don't pick up your
mail! Within days the effect upon our post office
should be noticeable even to a passer-by. Its stout
Romanesque walls will bulge from the dam of
correspondence. The mail always comes through,
but if it fails to come out, the results should be
remarkable. With this course of action, I hazard
that within days we shall see our many family
letters sped on their way with that proud post
mark "Stanford, Calif."
Having indicated the proper platform, and
having, hopefully, brought you from the depths
of your sentimental muddle, I remain
Jarvis Pugh
Editor's Note: There are far more interest
ing things to do to the strains of a gypsy guitar
than eating tacos.
'Overdone and Farfetched'
Editor, The Daily:
I am one of those bewildered freshmen to
whom Barbara Beckwith referred in her letter.
Prior to her "informative" letter I thought I
understood the Honor Code, but now I am not so
sure. It had always seemed to me that if a person
were honest to himself he would behave accord
ing to the ideals set by this Honor Code. I don't
feel that Barbara Beckwith is giving an honest,
unbiased account of this case. Of course, being
the defendant in such an "unfortunate" situation
would make an objective resume difficult—she
was the defendant, wasn't she? If not, she ob
viously got her information from someone closely
involved and quite bitter. Or maybe she was
hiding under a desk?
I don't know much about the Judicial Council,
hut from what I do know it seems to me that such
sarcastic cuts are a little overdone and farfetched.
Could It be that this letter is being used simply
to stir up the students? I have had quite a bit
of journalistic experience —as a matter of fact,
it's my major and I don't recall any policies that

advocate running letters to Iho editor on the front
page especially with such sensational headlines.
Incidentally, I seem to recall being in Iho Daily
Shack when this letter came in at the beginning
of last quarter. Why wasn't ii printed then?
The "abuses" cited by The Daily in its "probe"
Tuesday seem very tragic, 100. Perhaps they
wouldn't seem that way if the violations as well
as the penalties were told. How may students
know how serious that poor, deprived ROTC stu
dent's violations were? II seems to me that a
little objective writing on the subject would be
much more informative than a reporter's "sins
of omission." Sensationalism was fine in the
penny press of the 1830's; it sold the papers. You
have no need to sell The Daily; Stanford fees
should entitle the students to unbiased reporting.
Maybe The Daily should start upholding the
Honor Code ideals by printing the whole truth in
its probes.
I would sincerely appreciate knowing how Bar
bara Beckwith's letter and the series run by The
Daily can clear up Ihe Honor Code for me or
anyone else. If someone seriously believed these
articles, he might lose his respect for a group
that is one of the strong points of Stanford's
policy of trusting student judgment.

'Prefer the Comfort of My Bod'
Editor, The Daily:
Well now! Mr. Whalen appears !o bo emulating
the behavior of that venerable old rooster Harry
((Jive 'Em Hell) Truman. He desires to crow and
strut at dawn now. Being a peaceful soul by
nature, Mr. Whalen's call to arms shocks me.
However, I am forced to concede that the nature
of the challenge is unique. The usual form for
such amenities is a snarled "I'm gonna getcha
after school, buddy!" But: really, Papa Whalen.
why do you want to pick on li'l immature me?
And to think that, you need the help of Pat
(Brutus) Brown to do it.
Well, you go right ahead and crow. Papa; I
prefer the comfort of my bed at that. hour. Don't
let me spoil your fun, though. You and Patty
have a ball. Watch your blood pressure and re
member: "The pen is mightier than the sword."

'Mem Mail'
Editor, The Daily:
Feeling ourselves an extremely integral part
of the great Stanford family, we wish to express
our support of and admiration for your editorial
of Jan. 27, 1958, concerning a revival of the Stan
ford spirit in the United States Post Office De
patrment. Think of the increased efficiency of
these loyal public servants when they are once
again imbued with the great Stanford spirit
which is such a vitalizing force in our commu
nity. Picture these modern Mercuries standing
side by side, loyally stamping every letter with
the name STANFORD in cardinal red.
To give further evidence of this spirit at work
within our postal system, the following changes
might be appropriate:
1. A reorganization of the Stanford postal
service under the name of Mem Mail.
2. A sub-classification of the members of Ihe
proposed Mem Mail according to their designated
duties as follows:
a) The truck drivers as the Cardinal Couriers;
b) The sorters as Ihe Indian Intermediaries;
el The deliverers as the Civil Service Cyclists;
d) The stampers as the Stamp Stamp Com;
e) The special delivery messengers as the Red
Hot Runners.
3. We propose a modest change in uniform:
cardinal red with while sneakers.
4. We propose that the Railway Express ex
tend their services by means of a spur laid from
Palo Alto to a roundhouse in the Cactus Car
dens; and that all cars carrying Stanford mail be
painted with the words "Farm Freight" on a
background of rolling foothills rising higher.
Many thanks for allowing us to express our
heartfelt convict ions.
