Letter to the editor of the University of British Columbia IJbyssey i
in protest of I lie local humor magazine Pique:
"Dear Editor:
"After toeing through the latest edition of Pique, we would like
to suggest that the next edition lie published in roll form, to facilitate
the use for which we feel that it was originally Intended."
(bourse in (Iryslal-Gazing
The Holy Names College Collegian at Spokane, Wash., had ;i
rough time of ii recently. The Collegian carried three big stories of
coming even Is. Two were of future important speeches and the third
was on the debut of the college's symphony orchestra.
Rut the next issue reported that one speaker had to come a week
early, Ihe second sent a replacement, and the orchestra decided mem
bers weren't ready for a concert and canceled their appearance.
"Reporters take courses in tracking down facts," sighed Collegian
editors. "Should they add crystal gazing to their curriculum?"

Commenting on the paying of salaries to student officials after
the University of New Mexico student council turned down a pro
posal to pay the student-body vice-president $30 a month, UNM Lobo
editor commented, "Love might make the world go around, but gold
and silver are the lubrication that eliminates the squeaks."
He disagreed that "prestige" should be the only remuneration fori
students who work hard on campus projects, adding, "The lasl time j
a Lobo editor was looked up to, he was hanging in effigy."
A Social OtMliall
"A rock was thrown into the near placid pool of education lasl
week by Or. Orr Roberts, director of the CU high altitude observa
tory," editors of the Colorado Stale University Collegian said re
cently. "Or. Roberts declared that soft subjects, such as- courses in
education, psychology and life adjustment should be dropped from
the curriculum.
"He said also that the football team was unnecessary. Or. Rob
erts agreed that at present the best students intellectually are also
leaders in extra-curricular activities, but went further to say that
these activities are worthless wastes of their talents.
"When asked if we were going to produce oddballs with all this
emphasis on intellect and none on adjustment, he said that he cared
little if we produced oddballs as long as someone could think crea
tively.
"Or. Roberts sounds somewhat like an oddball seeking compan
ionship; a thinker, yet a misfit in our society. True, there is room
for such thinkers. We need them, but to cater to this minority to
the exclusion of the large percentage of students seems undemo
cratic and a bit ridiculous."
