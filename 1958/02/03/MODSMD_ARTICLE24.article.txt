# Indians Meet Web foots Tonight
## Eugene Contest Ends NW Swing; Cards Favored 
### 
If comparative scores mean any
thing, Stanford will boat Oregon
I>y 32 points tonight when (he two
flubs tangle in Hugene. Hut they
rlon't, so basketball experts have
rated the I'CC battle as a near
even affair.
Jlovvie Dallmar's Indians will lÂ«
playing their third game in lorn
nights on th e i r rugged swinj'
through the Northwest, so the
great amount of traveling could
have an adverse effect on the
Tribe.
Hut counteracting this will be
the impetus the Cards will still be
riding after their 0!)-.77 shocker
over Oregon State Saturday.
OKC Tops Oregon
While Stanford played its best
game of the PCC season in whip
ping the Beavers, Oregon played
one of its poorest, especially in
the first half, as it tumbled to
OSC on Friday, 82-02.
In the disastrous first 20 min
utes of play, the Ducks could
garner only 21 points, while the
Heavers nearly doubled that total
with 40 of their own.
Charlie Franklin, the big man
all season for the Ducks, didn't let
his teammates' slump bother him
as he hit for 22 points in the loss.
Watch Franklin
Franklin will be the man Stan
ford must watch tonight if the
Indians are to gain their second
straight win. He's averaged near
ly 18 points in each of the seven
conference games he's played,
with 127 points on the books.
Franklin's big night of the cam
paign was against Idaho a week
ago when he poured 35 points
Ihrough Ihe nets. But it's obvious

that he can't carry the entire load
for Steve Belko's club, because the
Ducks lost despite the 35.
The Ducks show superiority
over the Cards in two depart
ments of play rebounding and
scoring average. They've been
tallying (J 1.7 points per game com
pared to 57 for Stanford.
Rebounding Gap
Tn rebounding, there's a much
greater difference. The Ducks
have been pulling off 51 per cent
of the unsuccessful shots, while
the Cards are the worst in the
PCC wiih a mediocre 44 per cent
pull-down mark.
After Franklin, the Oregon in- ;
dividual scoring potential drops
several notches. Charlie Rask and
Ilal Duffy each have point aver-1
ages in the 10's; Dale Ilerron is J
hitting at a 7.3 clip, and then it's
down to Burl Kuykendall with a
modest 5.7 average.
Same Starters
Dallmar is expected to go with
the same lineup which played al
most the entire OSC game Dick
Ilaga at center, Jerry Thuesen
and John Arrillaga at forwards,
and Paul Neumann and Doug I
Warren at guards.
Dallmar settled on this combi- I
nation after a night of experi-1
mentation at Washington. If Sat
urday's results are a fair indica- j
tion, this combo could be the one
for which the Indians have search- i
ed all season.
