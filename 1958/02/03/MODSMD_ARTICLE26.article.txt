# Olympics Defeat Gymnastics Team
## 
### 
Stanford's gymnastics team
found itself on the short end of a
51-30 score after its meeting with
the Olympic Club squad Friday
night, but members of the Indian
squad flirt come away with a few:
honors.
Bill Abernathy led the locals
with an eight-point effort, gaining
five for a first place in tumbling
and three for a second mention on
the trampoline. Dale Beernink of !
the SU club walked off with a
blue ribbon on the side horse,
and Frank Christensen took one
for his top effort on the trampo
line.
