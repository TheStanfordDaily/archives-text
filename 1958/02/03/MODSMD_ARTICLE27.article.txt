# Frosh Split Weekend Series; Top San Jose, Lose to ECC
## 
### Alan Miller 
Stanford's Papoose quintet did
not quite come up to expectations
last weekend, and split their two
home basketball tilts. Friday
night the locals dumped the San
Jose State frosh, 59-55, but were
squeezed out, 6(5-62, by East Con
tra Costa Junior College on Sat
urday.
Bob Whelan, 6-10 Stanford cen
ter, played his best game of the
season against the baby Spartans.
Whelan hit for 15 and was con
stantly pulling down rebounds for
Stanford, who, teamwise, out-re
bounded San Jose 2 to 1.
Stanford forward Bruce Ander-1
son made two of his best showings
over the week end. He tied Whe
lan for high-point honors against
San Jose with 15 and then tied
with Bub Bowling and Tom Nord
land for top spot against Contra
Costa with 12,
Slow Start
Against the much smaller San
Jose squad the Papooses started
out slow, couldn't seem to click
and had only a slim 32-27 half
time lead.
In the second half the contest (
continued to be a seesaw battle.:
At times play got quite rough and
many fouls were called on both
squads. With four minutes re
maining and Stanford on top witii '
a 57-51 margin, the San Jose year
lings made a strong bid to tie the
score. But the clock was against j
them and Stanford came out vie
torious, 59-55.
Forward Cliff Barrett led San
Jose wit h 13. Teammate John
Midler sank 12 and Leon Donahue
had nine.
Saturday night was a different

story. The Papooses were defi
nitely not up to par. Throughout
the first half it was neck and
neck. Neither team posted over a
three-point lead at any time, even
though Stanford controlled the
backboards, 28-10.
The score similarly shifted back
and forth well into the second
half. With eight and one-half min
utes remaining, East Contra Costa
pulled ahead, 56-55, and kept in
front until the finish.
Stanford's defense seemed to
fall apart and they couldn't sink
their shots either. At one time
the JC's held a 10-point lead.
Every Trick
After Nordland fouled out, the
locals pulled every trick out of the
bag to try to nip Contra Costa,
but the ball-handling of Bill Roun
saville, Don Plumb and Bill Brown
was too much. As the final buzzer
sounded, Stanford's Whelan drop
perl in a charity shot for a 66-62
final.
Rounsaville took scoring honors
with 21. Brown grabbed 16 and
Walsh had 13.
Stanford coach Bill Turner
bluntly stated after Saturday's
game: "They just out-hustled us.
We've gol to play better ball if
we're going to beat the Braves
and Menlo JC next week."
