# Hospital Bed Move Planned
## 
### 
A plan to move all bed patients
from Stanford-Lane Hospital in
San Francisco as soon as practi
cable has been announced by pres
ident Wallace Sterling.
This action follows a recommen
dation made by the hospital's
board of governors following a
survey of the Lane building which
was made to deter mine whether it
could meet the more rigid hospital
structural requirements recently
adopted by the state.
This survey indicated there are
undue earthquake hazards in
housing bed patients in the build
ing. President Sterling said that
engineering studies had shown it
economically infeasiblc to rein
force the 64-year-old structure,
which, with the present Stanford
Medical School building, will prob
ably be demolished after the move
to campus. Both buildings will
continue to be used for other med
ical purposes on a temporary
basis.
The transfer of Stanford-Lane
Hospital beds will be planned bv
a committee composed of both pri
vate and teaching physicians, to
gether with representatives of
other internal groups having a
primary interest in the matter.
The committee's objective will
be to carry out the transfer with
the least possible disruption to the
teaching program or to private
medical care. Probable alterna
tives facing them will be to con
solidate all beds in Stanford Hos
pital or to locate suitable space
outside the present buildings.
However, no curtailment of pri
vate or clinic services at Stanford
Hospital is anticipated as a result
of the move.
