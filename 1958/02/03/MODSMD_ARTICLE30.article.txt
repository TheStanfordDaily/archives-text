## 
### John Schwarz 
Led by Doug Smart, Bill Stady and Earl Irvine, Iho Washington
Huskies rolled over the Stanford Indians Friday night, 09-85.
Afier only 2u seconds of play, Washington's Doug Smart threw in
the opening basket and from then on Stanford remained perma
nently behind.
Smart, who was the game's high scorer, thrilled the 0500 fans at

Kdmundson Pavilion with numer
ous book shots and backhand lay
ups. He gathered in the grand
total of 29 points on nine field
goals and 11 free throws to help
up his 21-point average.
New Scoring Ace
To supplement Smart's fine
performance, Washington found
a new scoring ace in Bill Stady.
Stady, who previous to Friday's
game had been averaging a mere
six points per game, broke loose
for 21 and added the finishing
touches to any hopes Stanford
might have had of winning.
Stady performed the remark
able feat of scoring on his first
seven shots from the floor and
wont on to sink eight for 11 in
accumulating his 21 total.
The whole Washington team
had hands in the first stanza
and left the floor at halftime
leading 38-20 after having hit on
the phenomenal mark of 50 per
cent of their shots.
Early Lead
The Huskies jumped off to an
early 13-5 lead in the first seven
minutes of play and remained
from seven to nine points ahead
of the Indian until right near the
end of the first half.
With a minute and 30 seconds
to go in the half, and his team
leading by nine points, Washing
ton's Earl Irvine threw in three
quick baskets on sensational left
handed hook shots. Fortunately
for Stanford, Haga and Thuesen
put in one-handers between Ir
vine's scores to keep Stanford
from completely collapsing.
Throughout most of the second
half the Huskies were content to
just keep pace with the Indians
and maintain their 11-point lead.
Finally, with five minutes left in
the game, John Pflueger and
Doug Warren scored on two
straight jump shots for the Cards
to make the score 61-54.
Smart Widens Gap
Three minutes later the Indians
had pulled within five points of
the Huskies only to have Doug
Smart score two successive bas
kets to sew up the victory for
Washington.
The most optimistic feature of
the game from Stanford's point
of view was the excellent play
of juniors Dick Haga and Paul
Neumann. Neumann and Haga,

who were predicted to lead the
Indians' attack this year and who
were having trouble finding Ihe
range consistently before Fri
day's game, suddenly came to life
and scored 35 points between
I hem.
Kxcellcnt Game
Ilaga, playing an excellent
game at both forward and cen
ter, scored 17 points. Neumann,
going into the game, was second
in the conference in free throws
and hit eight for eighl to take
over the number one spot. He
also hit on five good shots from
the floor to give him a total of
IS points for the night.
