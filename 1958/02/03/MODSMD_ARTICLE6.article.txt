## Skill, Sensitivity Are Blended In Francescatti Performance 
### Bob Christiansen 
Yesterday afternoon's concert by violinist Zino Francescatti, ac
companied by Artur Balsam, was an interesting blend of technical
proficiency and sensitive interpretation. The first half of the pro
gram consisted of works from the Baroque and Classic periods, with
the last half providing the usual complement of Romanticism.

The concert opened on a high
level with Beethoven's "Sonata in
G, Op. 30, No. 3." Both Frances
catti and Balsam played with a
fine sense of ensemble and did not
yield to the temptation to parade
about solo abilities at the expense
of the composition as a whole.
Verve and understanding were
key ideas, especially in the con
tredanse-like rondo.
A Common Flaw
The Sarabande and Bouree, each
with its double, from the "Partita
in B Minor for Violin Alone," by
J. S. Bach, came off less well.
Francescatti displayed fine tone
and technique, but at the expense
of the basic rhythms of the
dances. He yielded to the flaw
most common in performances of
the Bach Partiteâ€”the tendency to
view the compositions as fantasia
rather than as specific dances.
The "Concerto in D, K. 218," by
Mozart, was well played, but with
a slight tendency to romanticize
the gallant character of the melo
dies. However, this is not a seri
ous flaw. The Andante was prob
ably the best played. Balsam sup
plied an excellent accompaniment
in lieu of the orchestral one pro
vided by Mozart.
intensely Romantic
The second half of the concert
opened with Saint-Sacns' intense
ly romantic "Introduction and
Rondo Capriccioso, Op. 28." Here
Francescatti displayed to excel
lent advantage the fine tone and
glowing technique on which his
reputation is so justly based. The
Rondo is almost a combination of
a rondo and theme and variations.
Each time the subject recurs it
is cither varied or, most common
ly, embellished. The increasing
difficulty of these embellishments
offered no barrier to Francescatti.
