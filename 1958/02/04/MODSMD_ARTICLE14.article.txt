# Bulganin Offers Discussion on Space Control with Eisenhower
## Third Letter to President Seeks Summit Conference 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) Premier Bulganin, in his latest letter to President
Eisenhower, offers to discuss tho control of outer space, the Soviet
government disclosed yesterday.
But the offer is wrapped up in a package, including abolition of
nuclear weapons and reduction of armed forcesâ€”in a form that pre

viously proved unacceptable to
the United States.
Bulganin also seeks to meet
United States objections to an
East-West summit conference by
proposing an agenda and by ac
cepting the idea of preparatory
talks through normal diplomatic
channels.
Eisenhower already has ruled
out nearly every one of Bulga
nin's nine agenda points, and Bui
ganin's acceptance of the idea of
preparatory talks seemed based
on the West's agreeing first of all
to call the summit conference.
Third Letter
Bulganin's 17-page letter to tho
President was delivered at the
White House Sunday. It was his
third letter to the President since
Dec. 10, and was a reply to one
from the President on Jan. 12 in
which the President suggested
the need at this "decisive moment
in history" for control of outer
space.
The contents were made public
at a news conference by the So
viet Foreign Ministry spokes
man, Leonid F. Ilyichev. The
text was broadcast by Moscow
Radio.
Caught by Surprise
Its publication apparently
caught the U.S. Embassy here by
surprise. Eisenhower was just
beginning a study of a transla
tion of the note in Washington
when the contents were released
here.
Bulganin's offer to discuss
outer space was delivered while
the U.S. satellite Explorer was in
its first 48 hours of orbit around
the earth.
Bulganin said it is impossible
to consider the outer space ques
tion except "as a part of the gen
eral problem of banning nuclear
and rocket weapons."
Ready to Discuss
The Soviet, he added, is ready
to discuss such problems as the
control of intercontinental mis
siles "if the Western powers show
a willingness to come to an agree
ment on prohibiting atomic and
nuclear weapons and the banning
of their tests and the dismantling
of military bases on foreign ter
ritory."
"There is no doubt that in such
a situation an agreement on the
use of outer space only for peace
ful purposes would meet no ob
stacles," he wrote.
