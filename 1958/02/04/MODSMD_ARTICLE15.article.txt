# Clubs Veto Rush Grades
## 
### 
Stanford eating clubs voted 5
to 2 yesterday not to require all
rushces to have a 2.0 grade av
erage in order to pledge.
AI 1 freshmen, regardless of
their grade point average, will be
invited to all open houses at the
clubs and will be eligible for
pledging.
Each club voted in a referen
dum whether or not to require
the grade qualification for rush
ces, and their presidents voted in
an Interclub Council meeting as
directed by their clubs.
Interclub Council president Jim
Stewart estimated that of 300 club
j members 200 voter! not to require
; the 2.0 average.
The matter had linen debated
for some time. Club men argued
that to require the grade point av
erage would bo unnecessary, ac
cording to Stewart, since grade
averages of clubs as a whole are
always above the all-men's aver
age, and Toyon Mall which hous
es most club men has the high
est academic rating of men's liv
ing groups on campus.
With rushing this year, Stan
ford's fraternities have begun a
policy of requiring a 2.0 average
for all rushces. Although all the
freshman men will be invited to
fraternity open houses this quar
ter, during spring quarter invita
tions will be issued only to men
with 2.0 or higher averages.
