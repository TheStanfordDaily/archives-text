# Red Note on Conference Inadequate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—The
White House called on Russia
yesterday for more information,
beyond the present proposals of
Premier Bulganin, to assure that
a summit conference would offer
good hope of advancing the cause
of world peace and justice.
This came at the close of a day
in which President. Eisenhower
studied Sunday's 17-page letter
setting forth the latest Soviet po
sition on a top level East-West
conference.
Late Statement
The statement was issued late
in the day after Eisenhower had
left his office, gone to the White
House proper, and conferred by
telephone with Secretary of State
Dulles, who is at home with a
cold.
Newsmen had been told thai
"the lid was on" for the day
that nothing further would be
forthcoming from the Presiden
tial office. Then they were told
a few minutes later that the sig
nals were off.
Bulganin ('ailed Repetitious
A formal White House state
ment was then produced, saying:
"The latest Bulganin note con
sists of a repetition of Soviet pro
posals previously made and a
negative attitude toward Presi
dent Eisenhower's eight propo
sals put forward in his letter of
Jan. 12. The Soviet note is being
further considered.
"It is, however, already appar
ent that further clarification of
the Soviet position will be neces
sary before—to use President Ei
sensower's words of Jan. 12 —'it
can be ascertained that such a top
level meeting would, in fact, hold
good hope of advancing the cause
of peace and justice in the
world.'"
