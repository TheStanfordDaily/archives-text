# OREGON, 61-49
## No Repeat Performance As Tour Ends in Defeat 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford came back from a 17-point first haif, but then wilted
before the onslaught of Hal Duffy and Charlie Franklin as Oregon
mowed the Tribe under, 61-49, last night in Eugene.
Howie Dallmar's Cards, playing their third game in four nights,
were ahead of the Ducks by a point midway through the second

half. Then Franklin scored nine
points for Oregon, and the issue
was decided as the winners moved
to a 10-point lead with only 1:45
left in the contest.
The first half was among the
most futile in years for tho Stan
ford offense. The Cards got just
20 shots* could make only six of
them and found themselves down
by a 25-17 count after the first 20-
minute period of play.
Dallmar must have found a
chink in the Duck armor, and this
coupled with a hot streak by the
Indian shooters served to move
Stanford into a 30-29 lead. The
Cards hit on six of their first
seven shots from the floor in the
second half as they narrowed the
gap.
But poor shooting caught up
with the invaders again as shots
sailed over the basket or fell short
onto the front rim. Oregon was
getting the lion's share of the re
bounds also, and so Stanford
found itself seldom getting more
than one shot at the basket.
Defense Weakens
The Indian defensive unit did
an adequate job in the first half
as they held the Ducks to only 25
points. The northerners hit on 10
of their 27 attempts, with Chuck
Rask bagging his first four.
In the second half, however, the
defense couldn't keep up with
Franklin or Duffy, and neither
could the Indian scorers. Duffy
wound up as high-point man with
18 markers, including eight field
goals. Franklin hit for 17. scoring
primarily on well-executed lay-ins.
Dick Haga pulled clown the
high-point honors for the losers as
he dumped in five field goals and
four free throws. Doug Warren
and Jerry Thuesen also tallied in
Ihe double figures, with 11 and 10
points respectively.
A Sad 2-7
The loss dropped Ihe Indians'
PCC record lo a sad 2-7 and dump
ed them a half-notch closer to
cellar-dwelling Washington State.
Oregon, now wilh a 3-5 mark, is
deadlocked for sixth with Wash
ington.
Dallmar opened with the same
starting lineup that had shocked
Oregon State Saturday, but Ihe
quintet of John Arrillaga, Thue
scn, Ilaga, Warren and Paul Neu
mann didn't measure up to their
previous performance.
Neumann was hampered with
four fouls much of the way and
could only pet four points. Arrll
laga's shot.- fell shuri much of ilio
time as lie hit for seven. The
other three players did all right,
hut the bench could contribute
only three points all by Kent
Carter despite getting in a fair
amount of playing time,
( los«- at First
Stanford stayed with the Ducks
through ill** initial phases of the
first half and was ahead, 13-12,
with just nine minutes to go be
fore intermission.
Hut then came seven pointless
minutes, and <hegon had 10 of the
12 points by which it eventually
won.

Indian shooters served to move
Stanford into a 30-29 lead. The
Cards hit on six of their first
seven shots from the floor in the
second half as they narrowed the
gap.
But poor shooting caught up
with the invaders again as shots
sailed over the basket or fell short
onto the front rim. Oregon was
getting the lion's share of the re
bounds also, and so Stanford
found itself seldom getting more
than one shot at the basket.
Defense Weakens
The Indian defensive unit did
an adequate job in the first half
as they held the Ducks to only 25
points. The northerners hit on 10
of their 27 attempts, with Chuck
Rask bagging his first four.
In the second half, however, the
defense couldn't keep up with
Franklin or Duffy, and neither
could the Indian scorers. Duffy
wound up as high-point man with
18 markers, including eight field
goals. Franklin hit for 17. scoring
primarily on well-executed lay-ins.
Dick Haga pulled clown the
high-point honors for the losers as
he dumped in five field goals and
four free throws. Doug Warren
and Jerry Thuesen also tallied in
Ihe double figures, with 11 and 10
points respectively.
A Sad 2-7

Stanford came back from a 17-point first haif, but then wilted
before the onslaught of Hal Duffy and Charlie Franklin as Oregon
mowed the Tribe under, 61-49, last night in Eugene.
Howie Dallmar's Cards, playing their third game in four nights,
were ahead of the Ducks by a point midway through the second

half. Then Franklin scored nine
points for Oregon, and the issue
was decided as the winners moved
to a 10-point lead with only 1:45
left in the contest.
The first half was among the
most futile in years for tho Stan
ford offense. The Cards got just
20 shots* could make only six of
them and found themselves down
by a 25-17 count after the first 20-
minute period of play.
Dallmar must have found a
chink in the Duck armor, and this
coupled with a hot streak by the
Indian shooters served to move
Stanford into a 30-29 lead. The
Cards hit on six of their first
seven shots from the floor in the
second half as they narrowed the
gap.
But poor shooting caught up
with the invaders again as shots
sailed over the basket or fell short
onto the front rim. Oregon was
getting the lion's share of the re
bounds also, and so Stanford
found itself seldom getting more
than one shot at the basket.
Defense Weakens
The Indian defensive unit did
an adequate job in the first half
as they held the Ducks to only 25
points. The northerners hit on 10
of their 27 attempts, with Chuck
Rask bagging his first four.
In the second half, however, the
defense couldn't keep up with
Franklin or Duffy, and neither
could the Indian scorers. Duffy
wound up as high-point man with
18 markers, including eight field
goals. Franklin hit for 17. scoring
primarily on well-executed lay-ins.
Dick Haga pulled clown the
