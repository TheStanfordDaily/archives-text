# 'Made in U.S.A.'

John Foster Dui.i.f.s said gleefully yesterday
lliat the launching of the American satellite
Explorer proves "the United States can do any
thing it puts its mind to." 1
We are glad to see Mr. Dulles in such a happy
mood, for a change. We are also glad to see a
"Made-in-Ameriea" satellite orbiting around
the earth. Its instruments may record valuable
data on the nature of our atmospheres â€”infor-
mation which ma) help us all live richer, fuller,
more mechanized lives.
But why has a 30.8-pound 6-foot lube circling
around in space suddenly solved all the world s
problems? An Associated Press dispatch from
London savs that "an easing of international
tension was clearly evident in the capitals of
western Europe yesterday. The psychological
impact of the U.S. satellite Explorer was re
markable. British newspapers and others were
predicting that the stage was now set for sum
mit talks with the Russians in the near future.
More important was the restoration of respect
for U.S. know-how by allies whose long admi
ration sank after the Soviet Union launched
two Sputniks last fall."
\\ e fail to see how the Explorer could restore
anyone's faith in American "know-how," when

satellite chief Werner Von Braun said after the
Explorer's launching that the United States is
now five years behind the Soviet Union in
missile development.
The Explorer's 30.8 pounds, compared with
Sputnik IPs 1000-pound-plus payload, seems to
support this statement.
But even if the United Slates could match
Russian satellites pound for pound, what would
this prove? Perhaps that America and Russia
were at long last capable of destroying each
other simultaneously.
Granted, the satellites themselves may have
nothing to do with power for destruction. But
the official gloating, at least on this side of the
Atlantic, has been caused by the power of the
rocket which put the satellite where il is, and
not by any scientific knowledge which may
come from it. After all, a missile which can
launch a satellite could certainly reach Moscow.
And this from an Administration dedicated
to world peace.
We have all been warned often enough not
to be lulled into a false sense of security. We
will not be. On the contrary, we feel much
more insecure now than ever before.
