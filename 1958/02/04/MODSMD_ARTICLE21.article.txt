# Flo Mo Freeway
## 
### 
WOMEN al Florence Moore Hall must he quick
on their feel it's a miracle that no one has
been picked olf trying lo cross the miniature
Bay shore Freewav in front of the hall.
The "freeway" is none other than Campus
Drive. Kver since Campus Drive was opened
to traffic, cars have been zipping by at every
speed imaginable. Florence Moore residents
dread the thought of having to eross the speed
way on their win lo and from classes.
One aspect of the speed problem is the ab
sence of speed-limit signs on Campus Drive in
llic Florence Moore area. Jusl how fast can
one drive, anyway?
The speed limit on Campus Drive where it
swings past \\ ilbur is 3."> miles per hour â€”a safe
speed for that part of the road. But this speed
limit is excessive for the part of Campus Drive
in residential areas.
The speed limit for other campus streets in
residential areas is 20 mph. This limit should
also apply to Campus Drive and should be defi
nitely established by installing speed-limit signs
which are badly needed to prevent possible
accidents in the Florence Moore area, where
pedestrian traffic is exceptionally heavy.
Another device which would regulate traffic

in 1 lie same area is u clearly marked crosswalk
willi posted slop-signs lo enable Florence Moore
residents lo walk lo elasses vvillionl dodging
avitoiuohiles. This type of safely device lias
been introduced successfully on Santa Teresa
Street lo accommodate students living at La
gunita.
Still another dangerous aspect of Campus
Drive is tlie excessive amount of traffic, Cam
pi is Drive is I lie most convenient route from I lie
west part of I lie campus lo Ma\field Avenue
and Foothill Road.
A great many olf - campus students were
forced to slarl using Campus Drive to reach
Foothill Road when Los Arholes Road was
closed last quarter. Again, we believe that I lie
closing of Los Arboles was a mistake. II Los
Arboles were reopened, much of the traffic
along Campus Drive would he reduced.
It's clear that something must he done about
the Campus Drive problem. Five Stanford stu
dents were killed in traffic accidents during
autumn quarter, and, although none of these
accidents occurred on Campus Drive, it is
ridiculous to maintain a serious safety hazard
iu our own backyard.
