L Resf of Possible Worlds*
Editor, The Daily:
Your insidious campaign against the Honor Code is noticed in
these quarters. You can't 100 l us by running an apology and a dif
ferent picture.
We realize that one picture is worth many words. Your picture
of "The Judicial [Men's] Council in Action" in Wednesday's issue
was not a mistake but a calculated effort to destroy our faith in the
beloved Honor Code.
You cannot sway our belief in the men who judge Honor Code
violators by printing an obviously phony picture of them in unbe
coming poses.
We are aware that next you will begin to imply in your columns
that men who would allow such a picture to be taken, even if for
their own amusement, are not grown up enough to judge the fate
of others.
Nor will we pay attention to your mouthing of such pious slogans
as: "justice, the right: to face one's accuser, trial by one's peers," and
others. We know that those meaningless phrases, which you claim
are the basis of the Anglo-Saxon judicial system, are forced on the
weaker nations by the masses. Here we keep the peasants in their
place.
We call on you now, before it is too late, to recant your sins and
be absolved. Admit that this is the best of all possible worlds. Admit
that the system always prevails and that you were wrong but now
see the light.
11 you fail to do this now, Room 101 and Ihe Judicial Council will
be waiting for you.

There will be 15 minutes of HATE instead of the usual five, so
bring your own noose and learn the new Hate Yells.

'To Help the Student'
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily has provided a real service in the last two issues [Jan:
28 and 291 by reporting and editorializing on two matters of impor
tance to students, the judicial process at Stanford and the Resident
Assistant program. Both programs, obviously misunderstood, need
clarification. Debate and discussion of these two programs may well
result in some constructive criticism and improvements in both.
My remarks refer to your editorial entitled "A Dangerous Prac
tice." One of the responsibilities of the RA is to make written re
ports .quarterly on all students who are on the academic deficiency
list. End of the year reports are written on all students with obser
vations on his study habits, academic progress, social-cultural inter
ests, and leadership achievement. (Leadership is not limited to ac
tivities, but includes academic leadership.) These reports are not
"personality reports." The "custom" is not "hush-hush" but the re
ports are confidential. They are used by the Dean of Students' staff
as aids in counseling those students who request our services. We
see an average of 16 students a day in our offices for a wide variety
of matters. Where academic problems are involved, the RA reports
are invaluable.
Stanford enjoys a reputation for knowing its students well. This
is one of the values of a private university and we hope to maintain
it. In addition to the counseling assistance given by us, the RA re
ports provide information helpful in reassuring parents who consult
us on the academic progress of their students. The only reason for
tlie existence of the RA reports is to help the student. Certainly the
inference that they are used against the student is without basis in
fact.
RA's are carefully selected, mature, graduate students. Training
sessions conducted early in the year satisfy us lhat they are compe
tent to handle this responsibility in a professional manner. When
they do not know the student well enough to make significant obser
vations they are encouraged to say so. Your editorial assumes that
RA's judge students on "strictly superficial signs." In actual prac
tice, he is encouraged to identify the gifted student so that he may
be urged to greater advancement, to protect the rights of the minor
ity opinion in the living groups, and to develop respect among the
group for the individual.
Finally, it should be pointed out that we are all continually being
"evaluated," and we do not always have the privilege of selecting
those individuals, nor the time, nor the circumstances for the evalu
ation. The RA program should not be considered a "danger" to
Stanford students, but a distinct service which allows us as student
advisers to obtain evaluations from interested, intelligent people on
a consistent basis. In my opinion, abuses of the student individual
rights in the RA program are editorial spooks. But there is a definite
advantage in having them raised if my comments have been clear
enough to increase the general understanding of the purposes and
uses of the RA program. Keep on writing this inquiring and contro
versial type of editorial. If one of the marks of a great university is
the intellectual ferment about, intelligent controversy is one of the
best symptoms!

History Honors Program
Editor, The Daily:
The account in this morning's Daily [Jan. 29] of the new Honors
Program in History was rather garbled. It is not correct to say that
"students selected will conduct their own seminars with the assist
ance of a graduate student." All phases of the program will be under
the guidance of members of the Department.
For details of the plan interested students should consult a mem
ber of the History Department.

Spotlight oil Hope
Editor, The Daily:
. . . and, speaking of our church, one thing that bothers me, and
which I can't help seeing day and night ("thanks" to the help of
those dear spotlights): why does HOPE have to look so . . . HOPE
LESS?
Just asking,
Olympia Karageorges
