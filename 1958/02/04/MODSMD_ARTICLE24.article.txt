A safety play in bridge is a
means fit protection against a had
break. The idea is to insure your
contract at the expense of possi
ble over I ricks.
Here's an example of a safely
play in Ibis hand from a rubber
bridge game at San Francisco's
Somerton Bridge Club:
Dealer South, neither side vul
nerable.

3 A Pass 2No Trump Pass
Pass Pass 3No Trump Pass
The bidding is straightforward,
perhaps a trifle optimistic; but in
rubber biidge all the percentages '
favor bidding borderline games.
The opening lead of the i> of
diamonds was won by the ace.
Declarer now led the !> of spades,
West played the 10, and West was!
allowed to hold the trick.
It declarer wins this trick, and
spades break I 1, he can take only
three spade tricks; but by ducking
this lead he assures himself of his
contract unless spades break 5-0.
And if spades break !VU he prob
ably won't make this hand any
way.
Declarer won the diamond re
turn with his queen and cashed
his five spades and two high clubs
to make his contract.
On this hand, declarer's fine
play was rewarded; for, despite
spades breaking 4-1, declarer
brought home his contract.
