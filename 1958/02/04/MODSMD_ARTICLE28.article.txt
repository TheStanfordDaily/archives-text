Mental attitude has boon a problem in Stanford sports on and
off for a long time. J J oor showings by Indian loams have frequently
been blamed on the fart that the athletes didn't have the right out
look that perhaps they didn't much rare about whether or not they
won or did the best they could.
The mental problem is cropping up again on the Farm this time
in track, ( oucli Payton Jordan is concerned about bis team because,
for the most part, the individuals aren't setting their goals high
enough.
Jordan says, "We're a lot belter off than we were hisl year, but
so is everybody else, and we're still behind all the rest. The compc
tition all over the world is getting' stronger and stronger.
"Our gnys arc satisfied just to run one race. They'll run 15 110's ;
and Sio !i2o's in workonts, and then be scared to run more than one
race on Saturday."
Then, too, there's the matter of marks men who could run 4:10
are thinking it terms of 4:15; wcightmen who could put the shot
55 feet look at the 53-foot mark in awe.- These are only examples, but :
are typical of what's going on out on Angell Field.
Jordan says that progress in some areas has resulted in marks
by high schoolers thai could give Stanford runners a battle. Norman
Lloyd's 9:39.8 two-mile was a fairly good effort, for example, but a
couple of Paly High runners named John Northway and George Linn
could be light with him.
Despite the goal-seeking problems, Jordan looks for the team to
improve in the next few weeks and come through with a fairly good i
season. He's scheduled another intra-squad meet for Feb. 15, and '
expects that to provide tangible evidence of improvement.
Jordan and frosh track coach Floyd Strain were also busy Satur- ;
day with a track clinic that attracted several hundred coaches and
athletes from N'orthern California. The lectures and film clips on
each event were well received, and highly informative to any student
of track.
He's Popular in L.A.
Jack Curtice made his first appearance in Los Angeles last Wed
nesday, and judging from newspaper reports filtering up from J
Smogland, he was given a good reception by the press down there. ;
Word of the "Eucalyptus Jack" nickname has even spread as far!
as Sid Ziff's Mirror-News column. My colleague. Steve Baffrey, in- i
troduced the monicker in his "Grandstand View" column more as '
a humorous reference to the "Cactus Jack" tag than anything else.!
Well, now it seems that everyone took Steve seriously.
First Walt G a mage picked it up for the Paly Times, and then the
nickname even made headlines in the Chronicle. Now it's in L.A.
arid has earmarks of sticking. Can't say it's any more dignified than
"Cactus Jack," but at least it's local.
While on the subject of Curtice, the date for naming assistants
must be drawing near. When he was here last week, the new head
man said his aides would probably be picked in ten days. Friday is
the lenth day since that estimate, so news should be.coming soon.
Speculation still centers about present assistants Herm Meister,
Pete Knietovic and Dutch Fehiing; Utah frosh coach Andy Segale; [
and possibly a defensive specialist from the Southeastern Confer-!
ence.
If the past is any indication, once the staff is picked, it'll be to
gether for a long time. In his 27 years of coaching, Curtice has never
let an assistant go. He's never been let go himself, either.
Probably one of the key reasons that Curtice and his staffs have
stuck together for long periods is that he makes sure all his aides are
congenial before lie hires them. Curtice says,"I want them to all get
along well."
One more interesting fact on Curtice that hasn't received any
attention: he's currently serving on the NCAA football safety com
mittee, a new group that will make recommendations designed to
make lor a safer game. They'll work primarily with equipment |
manufacturers and the rules committee.
LOOKING AHEAD That's what Floyd Strain is doing. On his '
track office desk is a small inflated feline called a "Tiny Tiger."
Seems that there's an axe in its head because it symbolizes what j<
.Stanford hopes 1o do to the Occidental Tigers come their spring meet
at Oxy.

Then, too, there's the matter of marks men who could run 4:10

Jordan says that progress in some areas has resulted in marks
by high schoolers thai could give Stanford runners a battle. Norman
Lloyd's 9:39.8 two-mile was a fairly good effort, for example, but a
couple of Paly High runners named John Northway and George Linn
could be light with him.
Despite the goal-seeking problems, Jordan looks for the team to
improve in the next few weeks and come through with a fairly good i
season. He's scheduled another intra-squad meet for Feb. 15, and '
expects that to provide tangible evidence of improvement.
Jordan and frosh track coach Floyd Strain were also busy Satur- ;
day with a track clinic that attracted several hundred coaches and
athletes from N'orthern California. The lectures and film clips on
each event were well received, and highly informative to any student
of track.
He's Popular in L.A.
Jack Curtice made his first appearance in Los Angeles last Wed
nesday, and judging from newspaper reports filtering up from J
Smogland, he was given a good reception by the press down there. ;
Word of the "Eucalyptus Jack" nickname has even spread as far!
as Sid Ziff's Mirror-News column. My colleague. Steve Baffrey, in- i
troduced the monicker in his "Grandstand View" column more as '
a humorous reference to the "Cactus Jack" tag than anything else.!
Well, now it seems that everyone took Steve seriously.
First Walt G a mage picked it up for the Paly Times, and then the
nickname even made headlines in the Chronicle. Now it's in L.A.
arid has earmarks of sticking. Can't say it's any more dignified than
"Cactus Jack," but at least it's local.
While on the subject of Curtice, the date for naming assistants
must be drawing near. When he was here last week, the new head
man said his aides would probably be picked in ten days. Friday is
the lenth day since that estimate, so news should be.coming soon.
Speculation still centers about present assistants Herm Meister,
Pete Knietovic and Dutch Fehiing; Utah frosh coach Andy Segale; [
and possibly a defensive specialist from the Southeastern Confer-!
ence.
If the past is any indication, once the staff is picked, it'll be to
gether for a long time. In his 27 years of coaching, Curtice has never
let an assistant go. He's never been let go himself, either.
Probably one of the key reasons that Curtice and his staffs have
stuck together for long periods is that he makes sure all his aides are
congenial before lie hires them. Curtice says,"I want them to all get
along well."
One more interesting fact on Curtice that hasn't received any
attention: he's currently serving on the NCAA football safety com
mittee, a new group that will make recommendations designed to
make lor a safer game. They'll work primarily with equipment |
manufacturers and the rules committee.
LOOKING AHEAD That's what Floyd Strain is doing. On his '
track office desk is a small inflated feline called a "Tiny Tiger."
Seems that there's an axe in its head because it symbolizes what j<
.Stanford hopes 1o do to the Occidental Tigers come their spring meet

couple of Paly High runners named John Northway and George Linn
could be light with him.
Despite the goal-seeking problems, Jordan looks for the team to
improve in the next few weeks and come through with a fairly good i
season. He's scheduled another intra-squad meet for Feb. 15, and '
expects that to provide tangible evidence of improvement.
Jordan and frosh track coach Floyd Strain were also busy Satur- ;
day with a track clinic that attracted several hundred coaches and
athletes from N'orthern California. The lectures and film clips on
each event were well received, and highly informative to any student
of track.
He's Popular in L.A.
Jack Curtice made his first appearance in Los Angeles last Wed
nesday, and judging from newspaper reports filtering up from J
Smogland, he was given a good reception by the press down there. ;
Word of the "Eucalyptus Jack" nickname has even spread as far!
as Sid Ziff's Mirror-News column. My colleague. Steve Baffrey, in- i
troduced the monicker in his "Grandstand View" column more as '
a humorous reference to the "Cactus Jack" tag than anything else.!
Well, now it seems that everyone took Steve seriously.
First Walt G a mage picked it up for the Paly Times, and then the
nickname even made headlines in the Chronicle. Now it's in L.A.
arid has earmarks of sticking. Can't say it's any more dignified than
"Cactus Jack," but at least it's local.
While on the subject of Curtice, the date for naming assistants
must be drawing near. When he was here last week, the new head
man said his aides would probably be picked in ten days. Friday is
the lenth day since that estimate, so news should be.coming soon.
Speculation still centers about present assistants Herm Meister,
Pete Knietovic and Dutch Fehiing; Utah frosh coach Andy Segale; [
and possibly a defensive specialist from the Southeastern Confer-!
ence.
If the past is any indication, once the staff is picked, it'll be to
gether for a long time. In his 27 years of coaching, Curtice has never
let an assistant go. He's never been let go himself, either.
Probably one of the key reasons that Curtice and his staffs have
stuck together for long periods is that he makes sure all his aides are
congenial before lie hires them. Curtice says,"I want them to all get
along well."
One more interesting fact on Curtice that hasn't received any
attention: he's currently serving on the NCAA football safety com
mittee, a new group that will make recommendations designed to
make lor a safer game. They'll work primarily with equipment |
manufacturers and the rules committee.
LOOKING AHEAD That's what Floyd Strain is doing. On his '
track office desk is a small inflated feline called a "Tiny Tiger."
Seems that there's an axe in its head because it symbolizes what j<
.Stanford hopes 1o do to the Occidental Tigers come their spring meet
at Oxy.

Mental attitude has boon a problem in Stanford sports on and
off for a long time. J J oor showings by Indian loams have frequently
been blamed on the fart that the athletes didn't have the right out
look that perhaps they didn't much rare about whether or not they
won or did the best they could.
The mental problem is cropping up again on the Farm this time
in track, ( oucli Payton Jordan is concerned about bis team because,
for the most part, the individuals aren't setting their goals high
enough.
Jordan says, "We're a lot belter off than we were hisl year, but
so is everybody else, and we're still behind all the rest. The compc
tition all over the world is getting' stronger and stronger.
"Our gnys arc satisfied just to run one race. They'll run 15 110's ;
and Sio !i2o's in workonts, and then be scared to run more than one
race on Saturday."
Then, too, there's the matter of marks men who could run 4:10
are thinking it terms of 4:15; wcightmen who could put the shot
55 feet look at the 53-foot mark in awe.- These are only examples, but :
are typical of what's going on out on Angell Field.
