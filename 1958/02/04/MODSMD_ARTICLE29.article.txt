# Crucial Pits Cal vs. UCLA
## 
### 
California and UCLA, currently
tied for the PCC basketball lead,
meet this Saturday in Los An
geles for the most important clash
of the weekend.
On Friday the Bears travel to
the southland, where they will
first play fifth-place USC. The
same night the Bruins play host
to Washington State, who found
themselves in the cellar after
Stanford's upset of Oregon State
last Saturday.
Cal and UCLA have identical
conference records of 5 and 1.
Their season totals are nearly as
even, with Berkeley sporting a
10-5 win-loss record while the
southlanders have garnered an 11-
5 count.
This will be the first meeting
of the two teams, who play the
second game of their home-and
home series at Berkeley Feb. 2S.
