Purpose Stated
Purpose of the winter open
houses, IFC rushing chairman
John Kidd said, is to give the
freshmen a chance to look at ev
ery fraternity on campus before
the pressure of pledging starts
next quarter. No pins may be of
fered at this time.
Freshmen will be limited to the
group of houses to which they are
assigned. They may not visit
houses in other groups. They have
an opportunity to go to each of
the six houses in their group on
one, and only one, night of winter
quarter.
For the next three winter open
houses the Wilbur houses will be
rotated among the groups of fra
ternities. The other dates are
Feb. 18 and 27 and March 6.
Rushees Restricted
Rushees are not allowed in fra
ternity houses at any time this
quarter other than during open
houses. The no-contact rule was
lifted this year so fraternity men
and rushees may meet and have
normal social relationships with
each other on campus.
The IFC Rushing Handbook is
now being printed by the Press
and will be distributed to fresh
men tomorrow afternoon. It con
tains pictures and descriptions of
all houses, cost estimates, open
liou.se dates and rushing schedule
for spring quarter.
