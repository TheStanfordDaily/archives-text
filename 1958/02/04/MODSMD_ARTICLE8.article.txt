# Plans Start On Satellite Of 700 Lbs.
## 
### 
WASHINGT O N (Jp)_'The
Army is considering a proposal
by its satellite scientists to send
up before the end of this year an
elaborately instrumented moon
let, weighing as much as 700
pounds.
It would be designed to gather
detailed data for the eventual
building of a true space station.
This would be No. 4 of the
Army satellites, following the
launching some time between
now and April of a second Ex
plorer and a third, 300-pound TV
equipped reconnaissance vehicle.
Permission Asked
It was learned yesterday that
Dr. Wehrner von Braun, Ma.j.
Gen. John B. Medaris and others
asked the Army, soon after the
successful launching of Explorer
I, for permission to start putting
together the biggest American
satellite.
The scientists told the Army
this could be done by using the
basic Redstone rocket model
which pushed Explorer I aloft
with an 83,000-pound thrust. How
ever. some changes, probably in
cluding fuel, would be made in
the Redstone rocket, plus addi
tional solid fuel power for the ex
tra power stages.
Five-Stage Rocket
The latter changes might in
clude adding still another solid
fuel rocket cluster to make the
launching vehicle for Explorer
IV a five-stage assembly.
Boosting of the power for the
Redstone would be adequate to
get a satellite weighing between
500 and 700 pounds up to the 150-
300 - mile minimum orbital alti
tude. But the heavy weight would
need more push to get the satel
lite up to the 18,000-mile-per-hour
speed needed to counterbalance
gravity by centrifugal force.
Explorer IV would carry the
cameras and television recording
equipment of the reconnaissance
version of Explorer 111, plus
equipment for minute and elabo
rate electronic, photographic and
other data which will be needed
as scientists begin to draw build
ing plans for a space station.
