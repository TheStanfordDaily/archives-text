"American students and Indian
students have a great deal in
common," said Gogavnihari Lai
lubhai Mehta yesterday while
making his second visit to the
Stanford campus.
Mehta, India's gracious ambas
sador to the United States, told
The Daily that he believes a
friendly, hospitable and generous
character is common to students
of both nations.

Ambassador Mchta spent early
yesterday morning touring the
Stanford Research Institute. Im
pressed with SRl's Indian eco
nomic research, Mchta termed
work "very impressive and use
ful."
After a late morning confer
once with President Sterling,
Mehta met almost all of Stan
ford's 23 Indian students in the
Union for an informal talk.
He noted that there are at
present 2600 Indian students in
the United States. Over the past
five years he has visited over 80
educational institutions, talking
with Indian and American stu
dents.
When asked if he noticed any
significant differences between
the conduct of Indian students
and that of American students,
he smiled and said of American
scholars, "I only know what I
read in the newspapers."
As for educational advance
ments in India, Ambassador Meh
ta noted that there are now be
tween 25 and 35 universities in j
India. "Although there have
been great strides in literacy and |
technical education, our advance-1
ment has been on all fronts." i
Singer Marian Anderson s re-1
cent trip to India was mentioned,
and Mehta remarked that she
had made "a tremendous impres
sion" on the people.
Before leaving reporters and
photographers, Ambassador Meh
ta told what happened during his
last visit to Stanford.
"When I came in 1953 I went |
to see a football match, or what |
you call a 'game,' with President |

Sterling. When I left at the half
UCLA was ahead, and President
Sterling said the 'Indians' had no
chance of winning.
"I heard on the radio later that
Stanford won and immediately
sent a telegram to President Ster
ling saying, 'Indians brought luck
to Indians.' "
Ambassador Mehta's Stanford
visit is part of his fourth tour of
the Bay Area. He intends to re
turn to Washington soon.
