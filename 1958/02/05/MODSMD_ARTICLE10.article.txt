# Speaker Says Western Ideas of China Obsolete
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
How little the West knows
about Communist China today
was the most significant impres
sion Felix Greene, former British
Broadcasting Corporation corre
spondent, derived from a recent
visit to the Chinese mainland, he
last night told a near - capacity
Tuesday Evening Series audience.
Greene emphasized that the
picture most Westerners have of
China today is obsolete. The
China he saw last year on a five
and one-half week tour is an en
tirely different China from that
of Chiang Kai-shek.
"Streets' Were Clean"
Traveling unrestricted, he man
aged to see hospitals, schools and
factories. "I didn't see an ill-fed
child in the whole time I was
there," he explained. "Streets
were clean, there were no beg
gars and children looked lively."
"The New China has nothing to
hide," was one phrase Greene
heard throughout his trip. And
for him, it didn't. lie was allowed
to travel anywhere—with the ex
ception of Tibet. One time he vis
ited the Chinese army while on
maneuvers.
"There were 8000 tents, with
six men to a tent," he explained.
"I have never seen a smarter,
more disciplined group of men in
my life. Artillery was in superb
order, and the trucks were in
good shape."
"Appeal to Reason"
It was here that Greene first
observed tho government's now
policy of "appeal to reason." "If
a soldier made a mistake, he
wasn't disciplined, but was given
a long explanation by the offi
cer,"he said.
Throughout China, this same
"appeal" was used by those in
command.

Of the awakening of this vastly
populated country, Greene asked,
"What of human cost? Is this
the same thing we saw in Italy
with Mussolini when 'trains met
time schedules for the first
time'?"
Asking the people what they
thought of the new government,
Greene learned that the govern
ment has tried to avoid all ex
cesses of authoritarianism. "The
West makes an error if it tries to
identify Communism in Russia
with that in China," said Greene.
The problems, listed by him, are
radically different.
"1. Too much has been under
taken in too little time with too
few resources. He thinks there
will soon be cutbacks in efforts
to industrialize.
"2. Lack of money. In order to
have surplus food to export, peas
ants will have to turn over the
land given them in 1951 by
the government for collectivized
farming. Will they give up land?
620 Million People
"3. How to keep intellectuals
reasonably contented. No govern
ment in China can last without
its scholars. The people are more
sophisticated about this matter
than the Russians think.
"4. Population. There are now
620 million people in China, over
one-quarter of the world's popu
lation. Population increases at
the rate of 1500 per hour! Thus,
production must increase."
These then are the problems
of China, the details of which
Greene feels the West knows
hardly anything. "In order to
know what policies to use, the
West should get information, but
the United States won't send
newsmen in, and Britain isn't in
terested enough. We should get
he facts," concluded Greene.

factories. "I didn't see an ill-fed
child in the whole time I was
there," he explained. "Streets
were clean, there were no beg
gars and children looked lively."
"The New China has nothing to
hide," was one phrase Greene
heard throughout his trip. And
for him, it didn't. lie was allowed
to travel anywhere—with the ex
ception of Tibet. One time he vis
ited the Chinese army while on
maneuvers.
"There were 8000 tents, with
six men to a tent," he explained.
"I have never seen a smarter,
more disciplined group of men in
my life. Artillery was in superb
order, and the trucks were in
good shape."
"Appeal to Reason"
It was here that Greene first
observed tho government's now
policy of "appeal to reason." "If
a soldier made a mistake, he
wasn't disciplined, but was given
a long explanation by the offi
cer,"he said.
Throughout China, this same
"appeal" was used by those in
command.

Of the awakening of this vastly
populated country, Greene asked,
"What of human cost? Is this
the same thing we saw in Italy
with Mussolini when 'trains met
time schedules for the first
time'?"
Asking the people what they
thought of the new government,
Greene learned that the govern
ment has tried to avoid all ex
cesses of authoritarianism. "The
West makes an error if it tries to
identify Communism in Russia
with that in China," said Greene.
The problems, listed by him, are
radically different.
"1. Too much has been under
taken in too little time with too
few resources. He thinks there
will soon be cutbacks in efforts
to industrialize.
"2. Lack of money. In order to
have surplus food to export, peas
ants will have to turn over the
land given them in 1951 by
the government for collectivized
farming. Will they give up land?
620 Million People
"3. How to keep intellectuals
reasonably contented. No govern
ment in China can last without
its scholars. The people are more
sophisticated about this matter
than the Russians think.
"4. Population. There are now
620 million people in China, over
one-quarter of the world's popu
lation. Population increases at
the rate of 1500 per hour! Thus,
production must increase."
These then are the problems
of China, the details of which
Greene feels the West knows
hardly anything. "In order to
know what policies to use, the
West should get information, but
the United States won't send
newsmen in, and Britain isn't in
terested enough. We should get
he facts," concluded Greene.

about Communist China today
was the most significant impres
sion Felix Greene, former British
