## Committee Gives McElroy Limited Missile Authority 
### 
WASHINGTON (/!*> The Defense Department gained ground in
the fight for control of space age projects yesterday when a Senate-
House committee voted to give Secretary of Defense McElroy limited
authority in the field.
The development came a short lime after it was disclosed that

President Eisenhower has or
dered a special survey to deter
mine which branch of the gov
ernment should be entrusted with
the nation's vital space program.
There has been considerable sen
timent for putting it under a ci
vilian agency.
Working on a compromise ver
sion of a $549,670,000 defense au
thorization bill, the Senate-House
Conference Committee agreed to
give the Secretary of Defense an
thority to develop missiles and
other advanced weapons systems
through any agency he desires to
set up.
The Secretary alsoÂ« would be
empowered, for one year from
the effective date of the act, to
work on "such advance space
projects as may be assigned by
the President." This could in
clude satellite projects.
Approval of both the House
and Senate is required before the
bill can go to the President.
There is a likelihood of sharp de
bate on the question in both
chambers.
The proposed compromise au
thorizes the Secretary of Defense
to take full control "in the field
of basic and applied research and
development pertaining to weap
ons systems and military require
ments."
In the past, actual development
work has been handled by the
various military services rather
than at the top defense depart
ment level.
