# Conformity On Campus Discussed
## 
### Rita Robison 
"The American youth never has
the freedom to completely fail
himself. When he has to make a
decision which entails possible
failure, he is afraid to."
This statement occurred during
the Political Affairs Discussion
Group at the "Y" yesterday noon,
which tackled the topic "College
Student — Conformer or Bohe
mian?"
In order to guide the discussion,
Marilyn Tower presented two case
histories of actual campus person
alities (real names withheld):
M.R.S. Degree
The first one was "Cynthia"-
good-looking, intelligent, conform
ist and primarily concerned with
obtaining her M.R.S. degree.
The second personality was
"Claire"—wealthy, Bohemian, at
tractive and intellectual. .
Aim of the discussion was to
determine how representative of
the whole campus crowd these
two types are.
It was suggested that college
students are consistently "pseudo
liberal"— meaning they profess
liberality because they feel thai
it is expected of them and of their
educated background. Their liber
alism is insincere to the extent
that it is not well thought out.
College Liberalism
College liberalism is a question
of degree, of relativity to Ihe in
dividuals concerned, suggested
members of the Discussion Group.
Some professed Socialists drive
$1000 sports cars; some support
ers of non-segregation have no
personal relations of any k in d
with members of minority groups,
they noted.
This deviation from expressed
convictions and actual situations
may be the result of lack of con
victions. University and college
administrators have commented
in the past that most college stu
dents do not have a "cause" when
they enter school, and nearly as
large a percentage leave without
any stronger convictions t ha n
they had before.
Success Assured
The explanation may be that
college students are afraid to
champion a cause that is likely to
fail, the group agreed. Conform
ity generally assures one of at
least partial -success.
The conformities found on cam
puses may well be due to our
basic education in social adjust
ment. Primary schooling pro
grams emphasize "being like, and
liked by, the rest of the children."
The non-conformists, or "Bohe
mians," who constitute a goodly
portion of campus society, may be
in reality those who rebel against
everything and everybody.

with members of minority groups,
they noted.
This deviation from expressed
convictions and actual situations
may be the result of lack of con
victions. University and college
administrators have commented
in the past that most college stu
dents do not have a "cause" when
they enter school, and nearly as
large a percentage leave without
any stronger convictions t ha n
they had before.
Success Assured
The explanation may be that
college students are afraid to
champion a cause that is likely to
fail, the group agreed. Conform
ity generally assures one of at
least partial -success.
The conformities found on cam
puses may well be due to our
basic education in social adjust
ment. Primary schooling pro
grams emphasize "being like, and
liked by, the rest of the children."
The non-conformists, or "Bohe
mians," who constitute a goodly
portion of campus society, may be
in reality those who rebel against
everything and everybody.
"The American youth never has
the freedom to completely fail
himself. When he has to make a
decision which entails possible
failure, he is afraid to."
This statement occurred during
the Political Affairs Discussion
Group at the "Y" yesterday noon,
which tackled the topic "College
Student — Conformer or Bohe
mian?"
In order to guide the discussion,
Marilyn Tower presented two case
histories of actual campus person
alities (real names withheld):
M.R.S. Degree
The first one was "Cynthia"-
good-looking, intelligent, conform
ist and primarily concerned with
obtaining her M.R.S. degree.
The second personality was
"Claire"—wealthy, Bohemian, at
tractive and intellectual. .
Aim of the discussion was to
determine how representative of
the whole campus crowd these
two types are.
It was suggested that college
students are consistently "pseudo
liberal"— meaning they profess
liberality because they feel thai
it is expected of them and of their
educated background. Their liber
alism is insincere to the extent
that it is not well thought out.
College Liberalism
College liberalism is a question
of degree, of relativity to Ihe in
dividuals concerned, suggested
members of the Discussion Group.
Some professed Socialists drive
$1000 sports cars; some support
ers of non-segregation have no
personal relations of any k in d
with members of minority groups,
they noted.
