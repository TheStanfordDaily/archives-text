# To the Old Boy
## 
### 
\o\V THAT the Old Fool of the Chappie has
"lost bis bead " in the editorial columns of
today's issue and offered four filth-free pages
of bis March magazine to the admittedly su
perior writers of the Daily stall for writing a
parody of the Chappie, we cannot let this ofler
go unanswered.
We must admit that we were reluctant at first
to accept the challenge. After all, doing an
effective parody of the Chappie is no small
task. Every issue of that beloved magazine is
as effective a parody on itself as we can
imagine.
Furthermore, we realized that the Old Boy's
prime motive in making the offer was his real
ization that his own staff is so lazy and so
grossly inefficient that he would probably have
four empty pages staring him in the face come
deadline time next month, and he was loath to
face the ignominy of repeating this month's
fiasco of tardiness.
Hence, the Sedentary One's offer was a call

for help from tin* Daily staff.
Ah we sat in our office staring at the un
precedented slime and slander which fill the
pages of today's Chappie, we were faced with
a moral decision: should we come to the aid of
a fellow publication ahout to sink into oblivion
from want of material, or should we let the
Ancient One rot away amid 11 is paste-ups and
dog-eared joke hooks'/ After the pernicious
and unwarranted attack on The Peninsula's
Only Morning Newspaper in today's issue, we
were not feeling favorabh disposed toward tlie
Doddering Dissolute.
But that old journalistic klaxon-call finally
got the better of us, and we accept the offer. \\ e
may be making a mistake, but why not let the
Chappie die after a final, phoenix-like burst of
brilliance? After that, the Old Boy can fill up
bis own columns and take the consequences like
a man. So. just this once, we agree, and we will
out-Chappie the Chappie or turn in our press
cards.

as effective a parody on itself as we can
imagine.
Furthermore, we realized that the Old Boy's
prime motive in making the offer was his real
ization that his own staff is so lazy and so
grossly inefficient that he would probably have
four empty pages staring him in the face come
deadline time next month, and he was loath to
face the ignominy of repeating this month's
fiasco of tardiness.
Hence, the Sedentary One's offer was a call

for help from tin* Daily staff.
Ah we sat in our office staring at the un
precedented slime and slander which fill the
pages of today's Chappie, we were faced with
a moral decision: should we come to the aid of
a fellow publication ahout to sink into oblivion
from want of material, or should we let the
Ancient One rot away amid 11 is paste-ups and
dog-eared joke hooks'/ After the pernicious
and unwarranted attack on The Peninsula's
Only Morning Newspaper in today's issue, we
were not feeling favorabh disposed toward tlie
Doddering Dissolute.
But that old journalistic klaxon-call finally
got the better of us, and we accept the offer. \\ e
may be making a mistake, but why not let the
Chappie die after a final, phoenix-like burst of
brilliance? After that, the Old Boy can fill up
bis own columns and take the consequences like
a man. So. just this once, we agree, and we will
out-Chappie the Chappie or turn in our press
cards.
