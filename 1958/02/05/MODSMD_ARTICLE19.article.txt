'Try llit' Pelican'
Editor, The Daily:
Word has reached us here at the fun capitol
of the world, the Pelican Building, that the Cha
parral has been slightly slothful in making its
appearance. Too bad.
As a matter of fact, just the other day a friend
said to me, he said: Sakes! That Chaparral is
just too tardy!
I replied: You mighl try the Pelican. It's fully
packed, you know.
Friend: Yes. I tittered so over the last issue.
I: Alas!
Friend: I get so upset if things don't happen
on schedule.
I: Well, let me give you the bird. Pelican that
is.
... I don't want to sound mercenary, I just
want to show you the kind of guys you're deal
ing with.

I merely wish to take the opportunity to re
mark that contrary to the opinion expressed
in the Daily article, Giles |Emil Gilels] is with
out doubt a very great artist. His playing pro
jects the power and beauty which is unique pri
marily to Slavic performers, it is only the great
artist that makes Scarlatti so vividly precise one
minute and Beethoven such an invigorating expe
rience the next.

Editor, The Daily:
As a foreign student from France T was very
surprised to find last Friday the "Cosmo Club"

serving as a seat for political propaganda. I do
not want to deny the rights of such a powerful
weapon; after all it is a force which makes up
for many weaknesses. But it seems to me that
1here are only certain places for it, and that, the
"Cosmo Club" is not quite the right one.
Good propaganda should be served with taste
and discretion. But these, nowadays, are quali
ties hard to find even among the most decadent
societies. Nevertheless, none of us (I hope) thinks
of the next "French Coffee Hour" as a good occa
sion for distributing books and pamphlets de
fending the cause of our so-called "Colonialism."
But maybe we are wrong. Maybe only old (and
decadent) nations make a difference between
what we call "politics" and "customs."

Editor, The Daily:
Is Mr. Tinker's attitude toward defendants in
dicated by his gesture in the picture of Men's
Council Wednesday?
It seems to me that his gesture is in very bad
taste. Not only do people judge your paper, but
they judge the University and its students by
your paper, and if this is the type of thing that
you want to print, the judgment will fall.
Granted, the picture was meant to be funny,
but it is not the place of a campus newspaper to
hunt the gutter for humor; not even the Chappie
does that—much.
If this gesture indicates the attitude of the
Council, we all might as well either plead guilty
or revise the judicial system.

weapon; after all it is a force which makes up
for many weaknesses. But it seems to me that
1here are only certain places for it, and that, the
"Cosmo Club" is not quite the right one.
Good propaganda should be served with taste
and discretion. But these, nowadays, are quali
ties hard to find even among the most decadent
societies. Nevertheless, none of us (I hope) thinks
of the next "French Coffee Hour" as a good occa
sion for distributing books and pamphlets de
fending the cause of our so-called "Colonialism."
But maybe we are wrong. Maybe only old (and
decadent) nations make a difference between
what we call "politics" and "customs."

Is Mr. Tinker's attitude toward defendants in
dicated by his gesture in the picture of Men's
Council Wednesday?
It seems to me that his gesture is in very bad
taste. Not only do people judge your paper, but
they judge the University and its students by
your paper, and if this is the type of thing that
you want to print, the judgment will fall.
Granted, the picture was meant to be funny,
but it is not the place of a campus newspaper to
hunt the gutter for humor; not even the Chappie
does that—much.
If this gesture indicates the attitude of the
Council, we all might as well either plead guilty
or revise the judicial system.

Editor, The Daily:
Word has reached us here at the fun capitol
of the world, the Pelican Building, that the Cha
parral has been slightly slothful in making its
appearance. Too bad.
As a matter of fact, just the other day a friend
said to me, he said: Sakes! That Chaparral is
just too tardy!
I replied: You mighl try the Pelican. It's fully
packed, you know.
Friend: Yes. I tittered so over the last issue.
I: Alas!
Friend: I get so upset if things don't happen
on schedule.
I: Well, let me give you the bird. Pelican that
is.
... I don't want to sound mercenary, I just
want to show you the kind of guys you're deal
