# Tonight at the Symphony
## 
### Margot Zeiss 
After a fortunate one - week
break that gave us lime to study
fur our midterms, the San Fran
cisco Symphony concerts will re
sume tonight. Naoum Blinder,
who retired last season after 25
brilliant years as the symphony's
concertmaster, returns as guest
soloist in Beethoven's "Concerto
for Violin and Orchestra in D
Major."
It seems a paradox that Ihe 19th
century's greatest violin concertos
were written by pianists, but the
D-major concerto which Beetho
ven composed during the richest
and most prolific period of his
career is de rigueur in the violin
concerto repertoire.
Weird Premiere
This concerto was composed for
a violinist named Clement, who
was a peculiar combination of mu
sician, virtuoso and circus clown.
Stories have it that Clement play
ed the premiere of this exacting
concerto reading it by sight.
After the first movement he ap
parently felt the audience in need
of some comic relief, because he
played them one of his own so

natas on one string with the vio
lin lurned upside down. The pro
gram resumed with the last two
movements of the concerto, and a
Viennese reviewer, nothing daunt
ed, granted Beethoven's -score its
remarkable vitality and reported
that its beautiful passages were
warmly received by the audience.
Two First Performances
Tonight's program also features
the first performance in America
of "Funeral March" for the last
scene of Hamlet from "Tristia
Trystich," by Hector Berlioz. (To
quote Tom Lehrer, "Zees I know
from no/.ink.") Enrique Jorda is
fond of programing little 'selec
tions like this which are some
times good and sometimes well,
we can only hope.
Another first performance is
"Serenade No. 2 in A," by Jo
hannes Brahms, which will be
given its premiere in San Fran
cisco tonight. Brahms, perhaps
the most graceful of the Roman
tics, puts all the purity and power
of his themes into this serenade.
Mussorgsky-philes will be pleas
ed to hear that "A Night on the

Bare Mountain" is on the program
for tonight.
Take-Note Department
Has anyone else observed that
even the greatest of maestros has
a little of the ham in him? Jorda
takes his bows handsome and
smiling without the least suspi
cion of spectacles on his nose. But
somehow, between the time that
he turns around and the moment
when he lifts his baton, the glass
es make their appearance. We've
never been able to catch him in
the act of putting them on. hut
the question of where he hides
them is an intriguing one.
Of particular interest is the
symphony's oboe soloist. Not only
is he a consummate artist, hut he
applies himself to his instrument
with a red-faced ardor that is not
often seen among soloists, even in
the double-reed category.

never been able to catch him in
the act of putting them on. hut
the question of where he hides
them is an intriguing one.
Of particular interest is the
symphony's oboe soloist. Not only
is he a consummate artist, hut he
applies himself to his instrument
with a red-faced ardor that is not
often seen among soloists, even in
the double-reed category.
After a fortunate one - week
break that gave us lime to study
fur our midterms, the San Fran
cisco Symphony concerts will re
sume tonight. Naoum Blinder,
who retired last season after 25
brilliant years as the symphony's
concertmaster, returns as guest
soloist in Beethoven's "Concerto
for Violin and Orchestra in D
Major."
It seems a paradox that Ihe 19th
century's greatest violin concertos
were written by pianists, but the
D-major concerto which Beetho
ven composed during the richest
and most prolific period of his
career is de rigueur in the violin
concerto repertoire.
Weird Premiere
This concerto was composed for
a violinist named Clement, who
was a peculiar combination of mu
sician, virtuoso and circus clown.
Stories have it that Clement play
ed the premiere of this exacting
concerto reading it by sight.
After the first movement he ap
parently felt the audience in need
of some comic relief, because he
played them one of his own so

natas on one string with the vio
lin lurned upside down. The pro
gram resumed with the last two
movements of the concerto, and a
Viennese reviewer, nothing daunt
ed, granted Beethoven's -score its
remarkable vitality and reported
that its beautiful passages were
warmly received by the audience.
Two First Performances
Tonight's program also features
the first performance in America
of "Funeral March" for the last
scene of Hamlet from "Tristia
Trystich," by Hector Berlioz. (To
quote Tom Lehrer, "Zees I know
from no/.ink.") Enrique Jorda is
fond of programing little 'selec
tions like this which are some
times good and sometimes well,
we can only hope.
Another first performance is
"Serenade No. 2 in A," by Jo
hannes Brahms, which will be
given its premiere in San Fran
cisco tonight. Brahms, perhaps
the most graceful of the Roman
tics, puts all the purity and power
of his themes into this serenade.
Mussorgsky-philes will be pleas
ed to hear that "A Night on the

Bare Mountain" is on the program
for tonight.
Take-Note Department
Has anyone else observed that
even the greatest of maestros has
a little of the ham in him? Jorda
takes his bows handsome and
smiling without the least suspi
cion of spectacles on his nose. But
somehow, between the time that
he turns around and the moment
when he lifts his baton, the glass
es make their appearance. We've
never been able to catch him in
