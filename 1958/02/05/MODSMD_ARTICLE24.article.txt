# USUALLY IN TOP TEN
## Haynie Forecasts PCC Crown for Swimmers 
### Jerry Wisot 
Anticipating a highly sucrossful
season, the Stanford varsity swim
ming team is continuing its win
ler workouts to prepare for Die
final meet opener with San Jose
Stale on March 6. Under the di
rection of coach Tom Haynie, the
('arris hope to continue their domi
nation of Pacific Coast Confer
ence swimming.
Consistently rated as one of the
top 10 teams in the nation, it may
he said that the Stanford mermen
can hold their own against any
team in the nation in a dual meet.
With Ilaynie's guidance they have
won the PCC championship in 12
out of the past 13 seasons and
have lost but three dual meets in
the last five years, one of them to
the Pan-American swim team.
Their unusual strength is espe
cially demonstrated in the fact
that the Coast Conference is sec
ond to none in the nation as con
ferences go. holding as many na
tional records as any other inter
collegiate league.
Should Win
"Generally speaking," s t a t e d
Haynie, "there is no reason why
our squad should not win the con
ference championship again this
year, as well as go undefeated in
dual meet competition. The Uni
versity of Southern California will
perhaps be the strongest opponent

wo will face, and it is possible that
they could beat us, but this is not
expected. California will repre
sent the only other .rough com
petition."
Besides meeting USC, Cal and
San Jose State, the Indian tankers
are scheduled to meet Fullerton,
Long Beach, Cal Poly, COP and
UCLA in dual meets. Also plan
ned are the NCAA meet in Ann
Arbor, Mich., March 27-21); the
AAU meet being held 1he last
week of April in New Haven,
Conn., and the Southern Pacific
Coast Conference championships
at Berkeley, May 22-24.
Steady Drills
At the present time the squad
is working out continuously once
a day, with some of ihe members
putting in two daily periods. The
drills are split into two afternoon
sessions each, one from 3:15 to
4:30 and the second from 4:30 to
5:45. The average workout in
cludes about two miles per day.
Robin Moore, the world's record
holder in the 100-yard freestyle
and the intercollegiate record
holder in both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events, figures to be the
strongest man on the team. Back
ing him up in these events will be
Tom Peterson, Denny Stimson,
Treat Cafferata and Hank For
cade.
The squad is also very strong in
the backstroke, with Wayne Mehl
and Bruce Hamilton in this event.
Bill Fuller, Tom Peterson and
Gary Weaver, a top Australian
import, also show much ability at
the orthodox breaststroke. Enter
ed in the butterfly are Timmy
Timken, Johnson Gibes and Win
ston Black, team captain. The In
dians also possess a very fine
diver—perhaps one of the best in
the conference —in Bob Kahn.
High in NCAA
So far as national competition
goes. Haynie expects the team to
be well up in the finals of the
NCAA meet. He is fairly sure at
this date that Stanford's repre
sentation will include at least the
four-man medley relay and the
sprinting of Moore.
As an additional comment, he
expressed the desire to see more
Stanford students out to watch
the meets, when possible. "After
all," he said, "the competition in
swimming meets is usually quite
exciting, and it is my opinion that
most students would enjoy watch
ing the boys in their respective
events."

Besides meeting USC, Cal and
San Jose State, the Indian tankers
are scheduled to meet Fullerton,
Long Beach, Cal Poly, COP and
UCLA in dual meets. Also plan
ned are the NCAA meet in Ann
Arbor, Mich., March 27-21); the
AAU meet being held 1he last
week of April in New Haven,
Conn., and the Southern Pacific
Coast Conference championships
at Berkeley, May 22-24.
Steady Drills
At the present time the squad
is working out continuously once
a day, with some of ihe members
putting in two daily periods. The
drills are split into two afternoon
sessions each, one from 3:15 to
4:30 and the second from 4:30 to
5:45. The average workout in
cludes about two miles per day.
Robin Moore, the world's record
holder in the 100-yard freestyle
and the intercollegiate record
holder in both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events, figures to be the
strongest man on the team. Back
ing him up in these events will be
Tom Peterson, Denny Stimson,
Treat Cafferata and Hank For
cade.
The squad is also very strong in
the backstroke, with Wayne Mehl
and Bruce Hamilton in this event.
Bill Fuller, Tom Peterson and
Gary Weaver, a top Australian
import, also show much ability at
the orthodox breaststroke. Enter
ed in the butterfly are Timmy
Timken, Johnson Gibes and Win
ston Black, team captain. The In
dians also possess a very fine
diver—perhaps one of the best in
the conference —in Bob Kahn.
High in NCAA
So far as national competition
goes. Haynie expects the team to
be well up in the finals of the
NCAA meet. He is fairly sure at
this date that Stanford's repre
sentation will include at least the
four-man medley relay and the
sprinting of Moore.
As an additional comment, he
expressed the desire to see more
Stanford students out to watch
the meets, when possible. "After
all," he said, "the competition in
swimming meets is usually quite
exciting, and it is my opinion that
most students would enjoy watch
ing the boys in their respective
events."

With Ilaynie's guidance they have

"Generally speaking," s t a t e d

our squad should not win the con

dians also possess a very fine
diver—perhaps one of the best in
the conference —in Bob Kahn.
High in NCAA
So far as national competition
goes. Haynie expects the team to
be well up in the finals of the
NCAA meet. He is fairly sure at
this date that Stanford's repre
sentation will include at least the
four-man medley relay and the
sprinting of Moore.
As an additional comment, he
expressed the desire to see more
Stanford students out to watch
the meets, when possible. "After
all," he said, "the competition in
swimming meets is usually quite
exciting, and it is my opinion that
most students would enjoy watch
ing the boys in their respective
events."
