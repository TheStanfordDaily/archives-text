There's "not a new thing at all" to report in the Stanford assist
ant font hall coaching' situation.
Athletic publicity director l)on Liebendorfer told The Daily yes
terday that the present hope was that Jack Curtice's new staff
would be completed within a couple of weeks.
"Mos.'l of it is in Curtice's hands," Liebendorfer said, "and as
soon as he makes his decision, it should go through." It is expected
that Stanford officials will quickly approve Curtice's selections
once they are made.
Liebendorfer stressed that Stanford is not pushing' Curtice at
all, since, of course, it wants' him to survey the field thoroughly
and secure those who he leels will be the best possible aides.
