# BEST GAME VS. BEAVERS
## Cards Rest After Travel 
### 
Howie Dallmar is giving his
Stanford basket bailers another
rest period this week, following
tlie Cards' rugged three-game
swing through the Northwest. A
few men will return to the floor
Friday, but the bulk of the team
won't resume drills until Monday.
Stanford meets Southern Cali
fornia here a week from Friday,
then has a rematch with Cal the
following Monday, also here.
Dallmar reported yesterday that
his Indians played their best game
of the year Saturday when they
ripped heavily - favored Oregon
State, G9-. r >T.
Only Three Errors
The Cards made but three mis
takes against the Beavers and
played "a little better" than in
their surprising 50-49 victory over
the University of San Francisco in
1 )ecember.
"I was satisfied with all the
games," Dallmar said. He had
high praise for the five men who
started against Oregon and Ore
gon State Paul Neumann, Doug
Warren, Dick Haga, Jerry Thue
sen and John Arrillaga.
He expects those live and Mike
Tipton, who injured an ankle
against Washington Friday, to see
the bulk of the action during the
final seven games of the season.
Hurl by Smart
"Our defense played fairly well
and we were getting good shots
off against Washington," Dallmar
said, "but we were hurl by Smart
and then Irvine going in and hit
ting on four straight hooks."
Haga drew the job of guarding
Smart, but picked up three fouls
in the first 10 minutes, so Neu
mann had to move into the defen
sive post.
Almost the same situation pre
vailed against Oregon when Neu
mann picked up four fouls guard
ing Charlie Franklin. Franklin,
after being held to only three
points in the first half, then broke
loose with nine straight and broke
Stanford's back.
Nine RH's for Arrillaga
Dallmar was pleased with Arril
laga's work, particularly against
OSC. He pulled down nine re

boundsâ€”his l>est backboard show
ing of the season.
Thuesen also came in for lots
of praise and was the source of
some amazement. He had been
tiring easily but lasted all the way
against the Beavers, with no no
ticeable letdown.
Looking ahead, Dallmar said the
Indians will have to work on ball
control and going for the percent
age shots, chiefly because Stan

ford figures to have board prob
lems against all the teams left on
the schedule.
It was just that type of ball
control that helped so much
against Oregon State. At times
the Cards held the ball for as
long as a minute and one-half be
fore taking the good shot. It paid
off as OSC fouled often and let
Stanford score 33 charity points.
