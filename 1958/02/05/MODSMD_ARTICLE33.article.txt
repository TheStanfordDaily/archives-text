BE IT EVER SO HUMBLE
Today lot us apply t.lio hot. white light, of sustained thinking to
the greatest sin si o problem besetting American colleges. 1 refer,
of course, to homesickness.
It is enough to rend the heart, walking along a campus at
night and listening to entire dormitories sobbing themselves to
sleep. And in the morning when the poor, lorn students rise
from their tear-stained pallets and refuse their breakfasts and
shamble off to class, their lips trembling, their eyelids gritty,
it is enough to turn the bones to aspic.
What can be done to overcome homesickness? Well sir, the
obvious solution is for the student to put his home on rollers
and bring it to college with him. This, however, presents three
serious problems:
1) It. is likely to play hob with your wine cellar; many wines,
as we all know, will not travel.

2) There is the matter of getting your house through the
Holland Tunnel, which lias :i clearance of only M feet,, 8 inches.
This, of course, is ample for ranch houses, hut quite impossible
for Cape Cods, Georgians, and Saltboxes, and I, for one, think
it would be a flagrant injustice to deny higher education to
students from Cape Cod, Georgia, and Salt box.
3) There is the question of public utilities. Your house—
and, of course, all the other houses in your town—has wires
leading to the municipal power plant, pipes leading to the mu
nicipal water supply and gas main. So you will find when you
start rolling your house to college that you are, willv-nilly,
dragging all the other houses in town with you. This will result
in gross population shifts and will make the Bureau of the
Census cross as bears.
No, I'm afraid that taking your house to college is not feasi
ble. The thing to do, then, is to make your campus lodgings as
close a replica of your home as possible.
Adorn your quarters with familiar objects, things that will
constantly remind you of home. Your brother Sam, for instance.
Or your citizenship papers. Or a carton of Marlboros.
There is nothing like Marlboros, dear friends, to make you
feel completely at home. They're so easy, so friendly, so wel
come, so likable. The filter is great. The flavor is marvelous. The
Flip-Top Box is wonderful. The tattoo is optional.
I )ecorating your diggings with familiar objects is an excellent
remedy for homesickness, but it is not without its hazards.
Take, for instance, the case of Tignor Sigafoos and Kstabrook
Haunch who were assigned to share a room last fall in the
freshman dorm.
Tignor, an ice-skating addict from Minnesota, brought with
him 44 barrels over which he had jumped the previous winter
to win the Minnesota Jumping-Over-Barrels Championship.
Kstabrook, a history major from Massachusetts, brought
Plymouth Hock.
Well sir, there was simply not enough room for 44 barrels and
Plymouth Bock too. Tignor and Kstabrook fell into such a vio
lent quarrel that the entire dorm was kcnt awake for twelve
ilavs and twelve nights. Finally the Dean of Men was called in
to adjudicate the dispute, lie listened carefully to both sides of
the argument, then took Tignor nnd Kstabrook and pierced their
ears and sold them to gypsies. «■ m.-,* m«» si.uim.B

And now nil /# quiet in the dorm, nnd everyone sits in
pence nnd smokes his Marlboros, whose makers bring you
