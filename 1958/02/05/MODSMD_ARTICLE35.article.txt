### 
Professor A. C. Redfield, sen
ior oeeanographer emeritus at
Woods Hole, Mass., laboratory,
will give the Sigma Xi lecture to
morrow at 8 p.m. in the main lec
ture hall of the new Physics
building.
Dr. Redfield will present his
theory that the Antarctic Ocean
is an outer sea into which the
Atlantic, Pacific and Indian
oceans empty like rivers.
The former professor of physi
ology and chairman of biology at
Harvard University holds that
water in the Atlantic and other
oceans follow the same flow pat
tern as that found in river basins,
the Mediterranean Sea and the
fjords of Norway a surface flow
tending seaward while a deeper,
cooler current flows back to re
place it.
