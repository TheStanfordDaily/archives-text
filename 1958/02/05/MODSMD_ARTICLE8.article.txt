# Explorer Says: 'Fine Weather'
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/!') The first
American visitor to .space has
messaged home: Staying longer.
Come on up. Weather fine.
That's the report from earth
bound scientists listening to the
humming radio voice of the satel
lite "Explorer."
The Explorer has given them
early information on the three
things it was sent into orbit to
observe: cosmic rays, meteorites,
and the temperature of sunlight
and earth-shadow.
From these first reports scien
tists know that the cosmic weath
er has been calm. They also know
that Explorer will be aloft for
many a stormy day in space as
well.
Less Than 2 Hours
The orbit of Explorer has now
been pegged as 230 miles from
the earth at its closest and 1600
miles from the earth at its most
distant point. Average traveling
time in this path is a little less
than 1 hour and 55 minutes.
Scientists also believe that Ex
plorer may stay in space some 10
years at the most, several years
at the least.
Long before its death, Explor
er's batteries will fade and it will
lose its radio link with the earth.
Cosmic Climate
One of the first things it sig
naled scientists at California In
stitute of Technology and Van
guard headquarters was about the
cosmic climate.
Outside in the sun the Explor
er's skin was heated to 572 de
grees Fahrenheitâ€”hot enough to
fry a living being. But don't get
the idea that the Explorer is mov
ing through a sea of flame. Noth
ing is further from the truth.
In fact, the space that Explorer
knows is well below freezing.
Explorer's skin gets hot only in
the face of the sun. It's a much
hotter sunshine than we know on
earth because there is no atmos
phere to absorb its most violent
heat.
The Explorer's skin, so hot in
the sunshine, is 212 degrees below
zero Fahrenheit in the shadow of
the earth.
