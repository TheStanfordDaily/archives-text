# Navy Vanguard Dud Explained By Air Force
## First Stage Breaks in Two; IGY Program Badly Delayed 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (A') The Air Force said yesterday that
irregularities in (tie engine control system caused the Vanguard
satellite-bearing test vehicle to break apart shortly after its launch
ing early yesterday.
The irregularities occurred in the engine control system of the

first stage of the three-stage
Navy vehicle.
It came 57 seconds after the
launching of the rocket. Within
three seconds the irregularities
had deflected the missile so far to
the right that it broke in two.
The Navy disappointed in its
second failure to get a satellite
aloft plans to delve deeper into
just what went wrong before try
ing a third shot.
The Air Force said in a pre
pared announcement transmitted
to it here by the Naval Research
Laboratory that parts of the
wreckage have been recovered
offshore.
The loss of the Vanguard was
a sharp setback to Navy hopes to
put a series of small satellites
into orbit during the Internation
al Geophysical Year. That pro
gram already is considerably be
hind schedule.
Navy Report
The Naval Reseaarch Labora
tory preliminary report on the
Vanguard launching said:
"The Vanguard rocket test ve
hicle launched this morning at
Cape Canaveral was the second
of the four three - stage rocket
test vehicles in the Vanguard
program. . . .
. "Our telemetry records show
that between 57 and 60 seconds
after takeoff, small irregularities
occurred in the first stage engine
control system."
The report concluded by say
ing that "Project Vanguard has
two more test vehicles before the
satellite launching vehicles are
scheduled."
Launching* Set
The last paragraph of the an
nouncement meant two more test
vehicles are scheduled to be
launched before the main event
the attempt to loft a vehicle car
rying the full-sized satellite.
Officials said parts of the rock
et which failed yesterday had
fallen in grassy areas near the
launching site. They said these
parts were being recovered for
study. They said they did not
know whether divers woirid be
sent down to probe for rocket
parts which fell into the ocean.
It was not clear whether fail
ure of the first two Vanguardsâ€”
on Dec. 6 and again early this
morning would delay the Navy's
effort to launch a fully instru
mented earth satellite in March.
Some delay seemed possible, al
though yesterday's announce
ment emphasized that plans still
were firm to make the attempt
as soon as practicable.
