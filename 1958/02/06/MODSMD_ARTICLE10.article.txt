## Anti-Red Cabinet Demanded 
### 
TOKYO C/P)—Indonesian rebels
have placed before President Su
karno the names of the hand
picked cabinet which they want
appointed to shut the door on
Communism, a high Japanese
source said yesterday.
The source said the demands
were given Sukarno in Tokyo by
one of three rebel leaders who
slipped into Japan more than a
week ago.
The rebels want former Vice-
President Mohammed Hatta to
replace Premier D.juanda, it was
reported. Hatta and Sukarno,
leaders of the revolt against the
Dutch after World War II, are
the two most popular men in In
donesia. Hut Sukarno, dynamic
and shrewd, is more popular than
the quiet Hatta. Hatta resigned
as vice-president 14 months ago
in protest to Sukarno's guided
democracy program. He is a con
servative and staunchly anti-Com
munist.
The rebels have said their de
mands for a cleanup in the Indo
nesian government may be an
swered by a military attack on
their strongholds in the repub
lic's outer islands.
The outer islands have been in
a state of quiet rebellion over the
past year.
In Jakarta, meanwhile, an In
dosian foreign office spokesman
said the government was not con
cerned about the latest develop
ments in the rebels' war of
nerves.
