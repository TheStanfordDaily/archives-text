# ‘Co-Existence' Given As Goal for Polish Policy In Ambassador's Speech
## Russo-German Tensions Caused Serious Problems 
### Leo Krulitz 
"Poland's foreign policy can be'summed up in 'one word coexist
ence," said Ambassador Jer/.y Michalowski, Poland's permanent
member to the United Nations, in a speech yesterday.
A crowd that swelled Bowman Alumni House heard the ambassa
dor explain Poland's recent proposal for disarmament in the United

Nations.
Ambassad or Michalowski,
speaking with a pleasing accent,
explained that he would read his
speech because of language diffi
culties, and proceeded to neatly
outline the factors that were re
sponsible for Polish foreign pol
icy.
He explained that the basis of
their foreign policy was the so
cial and economic conditions of
the country.
• First, he said, Poland is a so
socialistic country and this is an
influencing factor on their policy.
• Second, the geographic posi
tion of Poland between Germany
and Russia created tensions that
their foreign policy had to deal
with.
• Third, the economic situation
of Poland is an extremely impor
tant consideration. Poland, he ex
plained, was economically back
ward before the Second World
War. "Our aim following the war
was to raise our standard of liv
ing as fast as possible. We admit
that we committed errors, but our
standard of living is now five
times as high as it was before
1939.
• The last important factor
that influences their foreign pol
icy, he said, is the national char
acteristics of the country —the
traditions, religion and culture as
well as the lessons their past his
tory has taught them.
Task Begins
"In 1956 we started a task of
reconstruction and the success of
our task requires better interna
tional relations and an easing of
tensions in the world. In one
word, we are for coexistence.
Your President meant the same
thing, I believe, when he said
thei'e is no substitute for peace."
He went on, "The root of inter
national evil is the arms race.
The most important goal of our
foreign policy is to stop this."
He illustrated the extent of
wasteful spending for aims dra
matically when he said that $85
billion would be spent on arms
in the world this year and added
that $4 million had been spent on
arms while he had been speaking.
He had been speaking only 15
minutes.
Ambassador Michalowski then
proceeded to outline Poland's
plan to stop the arms race.
Kapticki Plan
"The Rapucki Plan," named for
its Polish originator, is designed
to reduce the dangers of nuclear
war. We will introduce in our
country a ban to stop production
and stockpiling of arms if the two
German countries will do the
same. This would also mean a
withdrawing of troops from both
countries. It would produce an
area of reduced armaments in
the center of Europe between the
two opposing sides.
The ambassador said. "The
merits of the plan as we see them
are that it is easy, realistic and
practical. It is possible to carry
it out without sacrifice on cither
part." He said that after the first
step had been taken it would be
much easier to take the second.
Working Control
He was confident that a work
ing control of the area could be
negotiated. The ambassador an
swered other criticisms aimed at
the plan and in response to a
question he said Russia was in
full support of the plan as it
stands now.
The ambassador was aecompa
nied by his wife and returned to
San Francisco immediately after
the address. While on campus he
met President Sterling and visit
ed the Hoover Institution.
The speech was s p on sore d
jointly by the Political Union, the
Political Affiliations Committee
of the lIR and the Office for For
eign Visitors. The talk will be
broadcast over KZSU Monday at
9:05 p.m.
