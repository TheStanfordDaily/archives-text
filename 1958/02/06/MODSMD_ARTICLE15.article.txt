# Organic Life in Ocean Explained by Currents
## 
### 
The extent of organic life in the oeean is dependent upon nutrient
chemicals. Concentrations of chemicals in the world oceans are de
termined by a world-wide system of currents which cause the Atlan
tic, Pacific and Indian Oceans to exchange water with the Antarctic
Ocean.
Harvard oceanographer Dr. A. C. Redfield outlined these theories

last night during a Sigma Xi lec
ture in the Physics building.
"Major differences in the
ocean's fertility," he said, "are
caused by surface and deep cur
rents which move in opposite di
rections."
Nutrients become concentrated
in oceans where fertile river ba
sins empty into the sea. River
and sea water flows out to the
open ocean, while a countcr-cur
rent of seawater flows in toward
the river mouth to replace it.
Where evaporation is heavy, as
in the tropics, the circulation pat
tern is reversed. Waler lost to
the atmosphere is replaced by
inflow at the surface, while the
water concentrated by exapora
tion sinks.
In the Atlantic, deep water
forms when the surface water
cools and sinks near Greenland.
It then moves southward, while a
surface movement takes warm
water northward.
Conversely, Redfield said, the

Pacific and Indian oceans pro
duce cold deep water in the south
ern ocean, which flows north,
while a surface current of warm
er water flows toward the Ant
arctic.
Concentrations of chemicals in
crease in direct proportion from
zero at the surface, while oxygen
decreases in proportion as the
nutrient salts increase, he con
tinued. These ratios apply to all
the world's oceans.
