# Eisenhower Gives News Conference
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) -President
Eisenhower, plagued by a cold,
yesterday briefed newsmen on
current government policies.
In spite of his huskiness, the
President kept going for the full
half hour he allots to news con
ferences -touching on such varied
subjects as satellites, a summit
conference with Russia, a bit of
politics, and the status of such
White House aides as Sherman
Adams and Harold Stassen.
The Chief Executive didn't com
ment, nor was he asked to, on the
Navy's second failure, early yes
terday, to get a Vanguard satel
lite into orbit.
He said that through his sci
ence adviser, Dr. James R. Killian
Jr., he is getting fine scientists to
give the nation "a program of
outer space achievement" in the
scientific field.
As for the possibility of sending
a rocket to the moon and back
within 10 years, the President
said he—and he thought the sci
entists—would be the last to pre
dict a definite time schedule.
The "defense space business,"
he said, will be pushed in the
Pentagon.
Eisenhower said "we are work
ing very hard" to see whether
there is a possible approach to
some kind of heads-of-state-s meet
ing in pursuit of peace.
But he said he sees no fact to
warrant a conclusion that recent
exchanges of letters with Soviet
Premier Nikolai Bulganin have
advanced prospects of better un
derstanding or increased the like
lihood of a fruitful summit con
ference.
The Russians, he said, just say
"nyct" —no— to almost all the
points he suggests for discussion.
There is no use going to a sum
mit conference at which "you
would just be glaring at each
other across the table," the Presi
dent said.
