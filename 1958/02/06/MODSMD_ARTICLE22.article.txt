Editor's Nolo: Walter Lippmann's "Today
and Tomorrow" column, from the New York
Herald Tribune, will appear Tuesdays and
Thursdays in The Daily.
The American satellite Explorer has made us
all I'eel better, having given tangible proof that
the science of rocketry is known in this country
and that our experts possess the art of making
and guiding rockets. The event has confirmed the
testimony of those who have been saying Ihat the
Russians have a considerable lead but that we are
in the race.
Explorer is, therefore, a good popular antidote
to the panicky view that we are in mortal danger.
But it doe; not wash out the main portent, of
Sputnik—which is not that the Russians launched
a satellite first, and that their satellite is very
much bigger and heavier than Explorer. The
main poittai is that, starting at the end of World
War II with their country devastated and their
technology far more primitive than our own, the
Russians have achieved a rate of scientific and
technological development which is faster than
our own. What they did with the Sputniks shows
not merely that they have mastered a particular
specialty but that they have generated a tremen
dous momentum in the physical sciences and
their application.
Though Explorer is in the sky, there is no
reason to think that the comparative rate of de
velopment is now back in balance, much less that
it is in our favor. We are still the bigger and the
stronger. But they are still moving forward the
faster.
There is, therefore, much for us to do, and as
I see it we must move forward simultaneously
along three broad paths. The first is that we have
to find out how to make the government much
better able than it is now to take and to carry out
long-range decisions. There is little doubt that
American progress in missiles has been retarded
by bureaucratic confusion, presided over by po
litical appointees who did not understand the
issues they were supposed to decide.
Undoubtedly, this requires a reorganization in
the Pentagon. But the trouble will not be cured
in the Pentagon alone. The White House and the
relevant committees of Congress have at least an
equal responsibility.
The second path we must take is even broader.
It is the transformation of American education,
which on the average and by and large is de

clining in quality as the quantity of those to be
educated grows larger and larger. Our schools
and colleges are overwhelmed by the growth of
the population they are supposed to educate, and
they are under enormous pvessure—for the most
part irresistible to lower their intellectual stand
ards. There is an ominous tendency in American
education to teach more and more students less
and less of the great disciplines which form an
educated man.
It is in this, more than in the ups and downs
in the military balance of power, that there lies
the deepest danger to our American society. We
can most surely defend ourselves against con
quest or domination. What we have to worry
about is that with ihe declining level of educa
tion. with the vulgarization of the cultural stand
ards in our mass society, we shall become a big
but second-rate people fat, Philistine and self
indulgent.
The third path on which we must travel is to
learn to adjust our minds to the hard facts of
life—particularly to the fact that our Western
society, of which we are the strongest member,
is no longer paramount, is now only an equal,
among the great societies of the globe.
Britain and France have had to learn in this
generation what Sweden and Spain learned in
earlier days—that they are no longer the main
centers of power and influence for all mankind.
At the end of World War II for a few short years
the United States was the paramount center of
power and influence in the world. Our conception
of our role, as we have formed it in the post-war
years, has had as its fundamental premise the
paramountey of the Western society led by the
United States. This was a fact. But it was
transitory.
The post-war era is ending, and the great
reality to which we have now to adjust our think
ing is that we are an equal but not a paramount
power. This is the reality with which Mr. Dulles
has not yet come to terms. Because of that,
American and Western policy is, though tough
on the outside in the language it uses, unrealistic
and wishful -indeed wistful- on the inside.
But time is passing, and time will tell, and the
realities of the structure of power in the world
are forcing Mr. Dulles to go where he does not
want to go, to meetings which he does not want
on questions to which our obsolescent policies
provide us with no safe and satisfactory answers.

want to go, to meetings which he does not want
on questions to which our obsolescent policies
provide us with no safe and satisfactory answers.

The American satellite Explorer has made us
all I'eel better, having given tangible proof that
the science of rocketry is known in this country
and that our experts possess the art of making
and guiding rockets. The event has confirmed the
testimony of those who have been saying Ihat the
Russians have a considerable lead but that we are
in the race.
Explorer is, therefore, a good popular antidote
to the panicky view that we are in mortal danger.
But it doe; not wash out the main portent, of
Sputnik—which is not that the Russians launched
a satellite first, and that their satellite is very
much bigger and heavier than Explorer. The
main poittai is that, starting at the end of World
War II with their country devastated and their
technology far more primitive than our own, the
Russians have achieved a rate of scientific and
technological development which is faster than
our own. What they did with the Sputniks shows
not merely that they have mastered a particular
specialty but that they have generated a tremen
dous momentum in the physical sciences and
their application.
Though Explorer is in the sky, there is no
reason to think that the comparative rate of de
velopment is now back in balance, much less that
it is in our favor. We are still the bigger and the
stronger. But they are still moving forward the
faster.
There is, therefore, much for us to do, and as
I see it we must move forward simultaneously
along three broad paths. The first is that we have
to find out how to make the government much
better able than it is now to take and to carry out
long-range decisions. There is little doubt that
American progress in missiles has been retarded
by bureaucratic confusion, presided over by po
litical appointees who did not understand the
issues they were supposed to decide.
Undoubtedly, this requires a reorganization in
the Pentagon. But the trouble will not be cured
in the Pentagon alone. The White House and the
relevant committees of Congress have at least an
equal responsibility.
The second path we must take is even broader.
It is the transformation of American education,
which on the average and by and large is de

clining in quality as the quantity of those to be
educated grows larger and larger. Our schools
and colleges are overwhelmed by the growth of
the population they are supposed to educate, and
they are under enormous pvessure—for the most
part irresistible to lower their intellectual stand
ards. There is an ominous tendency in American
education to teach more and more students less
and less of the great disciplines which form an
educated man.
It is in this, more than in the ups and downs
in the military balance of power, that there lies
the deepest danger to our American society. We
can most surely defend ourselves against con
quest or domination. What we have to worry
about is that with ihe declining level of educa
tion. with the vulgarization of the cultural stand
ards in our mass society, we shall become a big
but second-rate people fat, Philistine and self
indulgent.
The third path on which we must travel is to
learn to adjust our minds to the hard facts of
life—particularly to the fact that our Western
society, of which we are the strongest member,
is no longer paramount, is now only an equal,
among the great societies of the globe.
Britain and France have had to learn in this
generation what Sweden and Spain learned in
earlier days—that they are no longer the main
centers of power and influence for all mankind.
At the end of World War II for a few short years
the United States was the paramount center of
power and influence in the world. Our conception
of our role, as we have formed it in the post-war
years, has had as its fundamental premise the
paramountey of the Western society led by the
United States. This was a fact. But it was
transitory.
The post-war era is ending, and the great
reality to which we have now to adjust our think
ing is that we are an equal but not a paramount
power. This is the reality with which Mr. Dulles
has not yet come to terms. Because of that,
American and Western policy is, though tough
on the outside in the language it uses, unrealistic
and wishful -indeed wistful- on the inside.
But time is passing, and time will tell, and the
realities of the structure of power in the world
are forcing Mr. Dulles to go where he does not
want to go, to meetings which he does not want
on questions to which our obsolescent policies

on the outside in the language it uses, unrealistic
and wishful -indeed wistful- on the inside.
But time is passing, and time will tell, and the
realities of the structure of power in the world
are forcing Mr. Dulles to go where he does not
want to go, to meetings which he does not want
on questions to which our obsolescent policies
provide us with no safe and satisfactory answers.

The American satellite Explorer has made us
all I'eel better, having given tangible proof that
the science of rocketry is known in this country
and that our experts possess the art of making
and guiding rockets. The event has confirmed the
testimony of those who have been saying Ihat the
Russians have a considerable lead but that we are
in the race.
Explorer is, therefore, a good popular antidote
to the panicky view that we are in mortal danger.
But it doe; not wash out the main portent, of
Sputnik—which is not that the Russians launched
a satellite first, and that their satellite is very
much bigger and heavier than Explorer. The
main poittai is that, starting at the end of World
War II with their country devastated and their
technology far more primitive than our own, the
Russians have achieved a rate of scientific and
technological development which is faster than
our own. What they did with the Sputniks shows
not merely that they have mastered a particular
specialty but that they have generated a tremen
dous momentum in the physical sciences and
their application.
Though Explorer is in the sky, there is no
reason to think that the comparative rate of de
velopment is now back in balance, much less that
it is in our favor. We are still the bigger and the
stronger. But they are still moving forward the
faster.
There is, therefore, much for us to do, and as
I see it we must move forward simultaneously
along three broad paths. The first is that we have
to find out how to make the government much
better able than it is now to take and to carry out
long-range decisions. There is little doubt that
American progress in missiles has been retarded
by bureaucratic confusion, presided over by po
litical appointees who did not understand the
issues they were supposed to decide.
Undoubtedly, this requires a reorganization in
the Pentagon. But the trouble will not be cured
in the Pentagon alone. The White House and the
relevant committees of Congress have at least an
equal responsibility.
The second path we must take is even broader.
It is the transformation of American education,
which on the average and by and large is de

clining in quality as the quantity of those to be
educated grows larger and larger. Our schools
and colleges are overwhelmed by the growth of
the population they are supposed to educate, and
they are under enormous pvessure—for the most
part irresistible to lower their intellectual stand
ards. There is an ominous tendency in American
education to teach more and more students less
and less of the great disciplines which form an
educated man.
It is in this, more than in the ups and downs
in the military balance of power, that there lies
the deepest danger to our American society. We
can most surely defend ourselves against con
quest or domination. What we have to worry
about is that with ihe declining level of educa
tion. with the vulgarization of the cultural stand
ards in our mass society, we shall become a big
but second-rate people fat, Philistine and self
indulgent.
The third path on which we must travel is to
learn to adjust our minds to the hard facts of
life—particularly to the fact that our Western
society, of which we are the strongest member,
is no longer paramount, is now only an equal,
among the great societies of the globe.
Britain and France have had to learn in this
generation what Sweden and Spain learned in
earlier days—that they are no longer the main
centers of power and influence for all mankind.
At the end of World War II for a few short years
the United States was the paramount center of
power and influence in the world. Our conception
of our role, as we have formed it in the post-war
years, has had as its fundamental premise the
paramountey of the Western society led by the
United States. This was a fact. But it was
transitory.
The post-war era is ending, and the great
reality to which we have now to adjust our think
ing is that we are an equal but not a paramount
power. This is the reality with which Mr. Dulles
has not yet come to terms. Because of that,
American and Western policy is, though tough
on the outside in the language it uses, unrealistic
and wishful -indeed wistful- on the inside.
But time is passing, and time will tell, and the
