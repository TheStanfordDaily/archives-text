The Daily investigation of

councils and their problems led
to the first question: "What do
you think of tlie judicial coun
cils 1 and their procedures?"
Kill Dittman, Theta Helta C'lii,
'59 — "Whenever you have stu
dents acting as judges as their
secondary job you are going to
get trouble. The people on the
Council are here primarily as stu
dents and they cannot do a com
plete job in their role as judges."
Joan Winnek, Roble, '(>1 Look

the editorializing is. That's how
The Daily slants Hie facts about
the Judicial Council."
George Fischer, Toyon, '59 "T
think the people who like to
judge others at Stanford are suf
fering from a Jesus complex, and
I don't think 1 would like to go
before them."
Diane Theis, Paloinu, '5H "It
could stand some revision, but
the principle is good. I'd rather
see students do it than the fac
ulty."
Dexter Roberts, Stern, Gradu
ate "I think it could use some I
more definite rules and working
regulat ions."
Cliff Terry, off-campus, '(51
"I'd say the Council should he
run more like an ordinary, re
spectable court. The pretense

cil's very existence."
Lucy Herbert, Roble, '61 — "It's
a good thing The Daily is publish
ing things about Judicial Council.
Few of us knew anything about
it before."
Fran Monson, Union, '60 — "I
think Dean Winbigler's state-
ment was one of the funniest
things I have ever read. The
Council operates like a kangaroo
court."
Orrin Petersen, off - campus,
'59 — "Certain parts I don't like.
I think the defendant should be
able to have an open trial if he
wants to."
Chuck Hoye, Wilbur, '61 — "All
I know about Judicial Council is
what I read in The Daily and the
only things I read were the cap
tions under the pictures."
Pat Taylor, Faisan, '60 — "If
that first lelter (by Barbara Beck

It looked like just that, however.
I do think Judicial Council is
more human than a regular
