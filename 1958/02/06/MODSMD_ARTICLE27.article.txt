### Steve Baffrey 
Lady With a Gripe
There's a woman staff member here on campus who has a gripe
1o air. And it isn't as though this is a passing thing, either. She's
been bothered by it for a long time, I understand, and she thinks
everybody should give it a thought or two. And in approaching this
columnist she happened upon someone of similar, though not quite
as strong, feelings.
IN A NUTSHELL Maybe we can sum up her feelings in this: "The
Stanford basketball team deserves to win bill the Stanford student
body doesn't deserve a winning team." Fairly potent words, I'll ad
mit, but she's able to back 'em up.
"We're off on tlie same routine this year," she says, "as we were
last season. We love the pep band, we love the delightful pompon
girls, BIIT we also love our basketball team —WIN or LOSE. And
I think it's about time we began to show some appreciation and or
ganized support for tbeni."
YELL LEADERS OR DANCING MASTERS Our yell leaders aren't
really yell leaders, she feels. They're dancing masters who keep time
for the song girls and the band. Maybe we should even call them
dancing girls' attendants.
"Don't get me wrong, though—tin* song girls are very colorful,
they do an excellent job, and they're a lot of fun to watch. Also,
there's nothing like tin* pep band to pep the place up, but I think
we forget that there's nothing like yells- to pep up a team. I think
we should have all of these —in proportion."
Although she's at many more games than she sits home for and
she's at the frosh games, too our lady with the beef says you can
never hear a Stanford yell on the radio, but you can always hear the
visitors'. And she wants it pointed out that there weren't any yell
leaders at the dead week games last quarter.
"I realize it was dead week but still we could have had someone
there, I I'eel."
Also, she says, it's hard to hear the yell leaders the few times
they do yell. Let's get out the megaphones, is her cry. The public,
she feels, and she doesn't mean the student body, bid the actual,
paying public, will yell (and loudly) if only they could hear the
white sweatered.
'"Why Mot Slay Home?''
"If the student body doesn't want to yell, why don't they stay
home? If you're going to go to a game—go to support the team. If
you go to see the song and the band —then make arrangements
to hire a ball for them and set up a show; don't do it at the I'avilion."
Hut basically the staff member feels that everything is out of
proportion. We don't need six big rahs with every name three for
the team and for individual players. We need new yells, more and
of a different kind. . . .
"Above all, we actually need a co ordinator. This should he some
one who decides when to dance, when to play, and when to yell. And
he should keep these in the right perspective."
A SAI) STATE Three thoughts finish it up: (1) The band had to
lead a yell at the last game. (2) We manage one yell a game for
Coach Howie Dallmar but she feels Howie can remember when,
while playing for the Indians, the yells in any two-game series
equaled all those that will be given this season. (3) If there isn't a
real yell leader around we can always adopt a former one, now Asso
ciate General Secretary Jim Triolo.
FINISHED? My two cents at last. She's right, in a way. Maybe
we could use some more yells, and some of a different kind. Most
of all, though, we need a desire to yell, and some organization at
games. But remember this is Stanford, spelled A-P-A-T-H-V.

you go to see the song and the band —then make arrangements
to hire a ball for them and set up a show; don't do it at the I'avilion."
Hut basically the staff member feels that everything is out of
proportion. We don't need six big rahs with every name three for
the team and for individual players. We need new yells, more and
of a different kind. . . .
"Above all, we actually need a co ordinator. This should he some
one who decides when to dance, when to play, and when to yell. And
he should keep these in the right perspective."

lead a yell at the last game. (2) We manage one yell a game for
Coach Howie Dallmar but she feels Howie can remember when,

equaled all those that will be given this season. (3) If there isn't a
real yell leader around we can always adopt a former one, now Asso

FINISHED? My two cents at last. She's right, in a way. Maybe
we could use some more yells, and some of a different kind. Most
of all, though, we need a desire to yell, and some organization at
games. But remember this is Stanford, spelled A-P-A-T-H-V.

Lady With a Gripe
There's a woman staff member here on campus who has a gripe
1o air. And it isn't as though this is a passing thing, either. She's
been bothered by it for a long time, I understand, and she thinks
everybody should give it a thought or two. And in approaching this
columnist she happened upon someone of similar, though not quite
as strong, feelings.
IN A NUTSHELL Maybe we can sum up her feelings in this: "The
Stanford basketball team deserves to win bill the Stanford student
body doesn't deserve a winning team." Fairly potent words, I'll ad
mit, but she's able to back 'em up.
"We're off on tlie same routine this year," she says, "as we were
last season. We love the pep band, we love the delightful pompon
girls, BIIT we also love our basketball team —WIN or LOSE. And
I think it's about time we began to show some appreciation and or
ganized support for tbeni."
YELL LEADERS OR DANCING MASTERS Our yell leaders aren't
really yell leaders, she feels. They're dancing masters who keep time
for the song girls and the band. Maybe we should even call them
dancing girls' attendants.
"Don't get me wrong, though—tin* song girls are very colorful,
they do an excellent job, and they're a lot of fun to watch. Also,
there's nothing like tin* pep band to pep the place up, but I think
we forget that there's nothing like yells- to pep up a team. I think
we should have all of these —in proportion."
Although she's at many more games than she sits home for and
she's at the frosh games, too our lady with the beef says you can
never hear a Stanford yell on the radio, but you can always hear the
visitors'. And she wants it pointed out that there weren't any yell
leaders at the dead week games last quarter.
"I realize it was dead week but still we could have had someone
there, I I'eel."
Also, she says, it's hard to hear the yell leaders the few times
they do yell. Let's get out the megaphones, is her cry. The public,
she feels, and she doesn't mean the student body, bid the actual,
paying public, will yell (and loudly) if only they could hear the
white sweatered.

columnist she happened upon someone of similar, though not quite
as strong, feelings.
IN A NUTSHELL Maybe we can sum up her feelings in this: "The
Stanford basketball team deserves to win bill the Stanford student
body doesn't deserve a winning team." Fairly potent words, I'll ad
mit, but she's able to back 'em up.
"We're off on tlie same routine this year," she says, "as we were
last season. We love the pep band, we love the delightful pompon
girls, BIIT we also love our basketball team —WIN or LOSE. And
I think it's about time we began to show some appreciation and or
ganized support for tbeni."
YELL LEADERS OR DANCING MASTERS Our yell leaders aren't
really yell leaders, she feels. They're dancing masters who keep time
for the song girls and the band. Maybe we should even call them
dancing girls' attendants.
"Don't get me wrong, though—tin* song girls are very colorful,
they do an excellent job, and they're a lot of fun to watch. Also,
there's nothing like tin* pep band to pep the place up, but I think
we forget that there's nothing like yells- to pep up a team. I think
we should have all of these —in proportion."
Although she's at many more games than she sits home for and
she's at the frosh games, too our lady with the beef says you can
never hear a Stanford yell on the radio, but you can always hear the
visitors'. And she wants it pointed out that there weren't any yell
leaders at the dead week games last quarter.
"I realize it was dead week but still we could have had someone
there, I I'eel."
Also, she says, it's hard to hear the yell leaders the few times
they do yell. Let's get out the megaphones, is her cry. The public,
she feels, and she doesn't mean the student body, bid the actual,
paying public, will yell (and loudly) if only they could hear the
white sweatered.
'"Why Mot Slay Home?''
"If the student body doesn't want to yell, why don't they stay
home? If you're going to go to a game—go to support the team. If
you go to see the song and the band —then make arrangements
to hire a ball for them and set up a show; don't do it at the I'avilion."
Hut basically the staff member feels that everything is out of
proportion. We don't need six big rahs with every name three for
the team and for individual players. We need new yells, more and
of a different kind. . . .
"Above all, we actually need a co ordinator. This should he some
one who decides when to dance, when to play, and when to yell. And
he should keep these in the right perspective."
A SAI) STATE Three thoughts finish it up: (1) The band had to
lead a yell at the last game. (2) We manage one yell a game for
Coach Howie Dallmar but she feels Howie can remember when,
while playing for the Indians, the yells in any two-game series
equaled all those that will be given this season. (3) If there isn't a
real yell leader around we can always adopt a former one, now Asso
ciate General Secretary Jim Triolo.
FINISHED? My two cents at last. She's right, in a way. Maybe
we could use some more yells, and some of a different kind. Most
of all, though, we need a desire to yell, and some organization at
games. But remember this is Stanford, spelled A-P-A-T-H-V.

Lady With a Gripe
There's a woman staff member here on campus who has a gripe
1o air. And it isn't as though this is a passing thing, either. She's
been bothered by it for a long time, I understand, and she thinks
everybody should give it a thought or two. And in approaching this
columnist she happened upon someone of similar, though not quite
as strong, feelings.
