A new kind of X-ray micro
scope, a "mierofluoroscope" that
will let scientists directly observe
and measure growth within liv
ing cells, was announced yester
day by its developer, Dr. Howard
H. Pattee Jr., acting director of
Stanford's X-ray Research Labo
ratory.
"The mierofluoroscope is just
like a medical fluoroscopc," Pat
tee said, "except that everything
has been sealed down 2000 times
in si/e. Everything, thai is, but
the X-rays it uses, which arc 100
times longer than usual."
The mierofluoroscope can see
details somewhere between a
hundredth and a thousandth of
the human cell's visible size.
