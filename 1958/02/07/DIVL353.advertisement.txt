Plan your career with a company that has a "young man's"
viewpoint. On-the-job training, good pay and subsidiary bene
fits. Librascope, Inc., develops analog and digital computers
and controls for both industrial and military applications.
Fields of concentration include servo mechanisms, transistor
applications, electro-mechanical systems and optical devices.

Kepler's Kwik Kourse No. 10
OVERCOMING THE RUSSIAN MENACE
Or
Abnormal Psychology 125 G
1. RUSSIA SENDS UP SATELLITE No. 1 —
They are obviously trying to frighten U.S.
and to belittle U.S. in the eyes of the world.
They built this only for warlike purposes—
hot and cold. Besides, we could have done
the same a year ago except for those darned
interservice rivalries!
2. RUSSIA SENDS UP SATELLITE No. 2—
Their inhumanity is made manifest: they
doomed a dog in this experiment. Anyway,
we have some men ready to go into space
just as soon as those nasty interservice
rivalries are overcome.
3. U.S. NAVY SENDS UP VANGUARD—
Ooops!
4. U.S. ARMY SENDS UP SATELLITE No. 3—
A magnificent scientific achievement and
contribution to the welfare of all mankind.
Moreover, our satellite, while somewhat
smaller than Russia,s orbits HIGHER and
packs more scientific instruments into less
space, illustrating the superiority of capi
talist science over communist science.
So all you students read more paperbound books, apply yourselves,
overcome the menace of totalitarian know-how, read more of Kepler's
books . . .
And we'll all live happily ever after, building Bigger and Better mis
siles, satellites and space ships to deter aggressive, subversive, creeping,
crunching Soviet threats, Sputniks, or whatniks.
Just keep reading them books! Support free enterprise!
You'll find them just a missile's throw from the campus at
