## Accepts Present Procedures Pending Future Investigation 
### Barbara Hicks, Staff Editor 
ASSU Legislature defeated proposed amendments to the Judicial
Council's rules of procedure last night, and accepted the Council's
current rules temporarily, pending further investigation.
The investigating committee will meet Monday to review proce
dures and will make recommendations to the Legislature.

Don Crocker, Law School rep
resentative, and chairman of the
committee, in urging the defeat
of the proposals, pointed out that
the purpose of punishments
handed down by Judicial Council
is educational, not punitive.
"If the accused is allowed to
face his accuser, bullying tech
niques may result. By protecting
the accuser, we are encouraging
personal responsibility," Crocker
said.
The commiffee recommended,
however, that the present major
ity votetbe changed to two-thirds
in determining the guilt of a de
fendant, with a majority vote of
the Council deciding the penalty.
Review Case
"If new evidence is found, the
case should be subject to review,"
Crocker emphasized, adding that
the double jeopardy aspect is
concerned only with criminal
trials, "and this is not a criminal
trial."
Defending the proposals, Rob
ert Guild contended that the pur
pose of the trial is to protect the
defendant, who is innocent unlil
proven guilty, not to protect the
accuser. Guild claimed the de
fendant should have the right to
a public trial and to confront his
accuser.
No New Jury
Gordon Tinker, chairman of
the Judicial Council, countered
the proposal for a unanimous
vote by noting, "As we cannot
call a new jury as is done in
criminal trials where a unani
mous vote cannot be obtained, all
decisions not reached by iho
Council will be made by the
Dean. The students wouldn't
want that."
