# Heavens Fall In Main Libe

### 
A piece from Sputnik? The
Explorer? The sky falling in?
These were the first thoughts
of students yesterday after
noon in the Humanities Room
of the Main Library as pieces
of glass came tinkling down to
the floor in the wake of a loud
crash.
Sputnik collectors were out
of luck, though. The commo
tion was caused merely by
some object being projected
against one of the small win
dow panes. No injuries oc
curred.
