# Accomplice to Discrimination?
## 
### 
Among the many blanks one is required to fill
out at the Stanford Placement Service is a yel
low personal-record card for use in their office.
Supposedly, this card does not circulate and is
not sent out to prospective employers.
We are glad to know this—because down in
tlie lower right-hand corner of that form is a
question which disturbs us deeply.
Along with the usual questions on education,
work experience, goals, height and weight, and
other personal data is a small blank labeled
simply "Church "
Such a question, whatever its purpose, ap
pears to us to run eounter to University poliey.
The University does not include questions on
race or religion on its admission forms.
Religion is asked in the registration book,
but this is after the student has been admitted
to the University and is for the use of chaplains
and campus religious groups in contacting in
terested students.
On the other hand, this question on the

Placement Serviee forms eould he used as a
basis for discrimination by business organiza
tions.
It is no secret that many business firms con
tinue to discriminate on the basis of race and
religion. This is unfortunate. It is no surprise
that they would be interested iu having this
question answered fur them before interview
ing prospeetive employees.
Whether or not this is so. we hope the Place
ment Serviee does not allow itself to be used
as an aid to employer polieies of discrimi
nation.
We believe these employers should be forced
to go to the trouble of doing their own dis
criminating, if they consider this "necessary"
to preserve their "standards'* or "morale."'
We do not believe any Stanford organization
would be a party to this sort of thing. And
still we wonder. Why is this question included
on blanks that could influence the course of a
student's whole life?
