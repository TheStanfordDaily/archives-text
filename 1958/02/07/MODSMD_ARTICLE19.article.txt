The government of Basutoland (Africa) has
been alarmed at the high incidence of illicit liq
uor consumption by university students.
The Minister of Education, Arts and Sciences
piloted a University Students' Liquor Bill
through Parliament, dwelling at length on the
evils of illicit liquor consumption. He stressed
that racketeers charged the students twice the
amount paid at a pub.
It was necessary, therefore, to enact a law
enabling students to obtain liquor at retail
prices.

The University of Washington at Seattle is the
proud possessor of the first live squid to he suc
cessfully transplanted from its native habitat to
the university.
Squids being little known commodities, a few
pertinent facts are given to tho interested stu

purple shade very rapidly. The animals are quile
intelligent and are interesting to watch, as they
are able to move their eyes and follow the mo
tions of people near them.
Their brains are comparable in magnitude to
those of a "large ling cod."
Clever kids, squids.

The University of Washington at Seattle is the

Squids being little known commodities, a few
