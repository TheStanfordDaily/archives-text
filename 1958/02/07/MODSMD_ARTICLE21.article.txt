# $1.3 Million Student Aid Funds Prove Inadequate
## 
### Bob Goggin 
Scholarship funds at Stanford
have grown to more than $1.3 mil
lion, but are still not adequate to
meet the needs of students.
The need for scholarships did
not always exist at Stanford. Be
fore 1919 there was no tuition, and
few capable students were re
stricted from attending because of
financial need. This is probably
the reason that neither of the
Stanlords' wills provides for
scholarships.
However, Mrs. Stanford estab
lished the first scholarship in 1900,
while she was still alive. It was
called the "Leland Stanford Jr.
Scholarship," and it provided $300
for cost of living and books. In
1900 it paid the room and board
of a student at Encina for the
whole academic year and bought
his books. Today this same-schol
arship provides little more than
tuition cost for one quarter.
The second scholarship, estab
lished in 1914, was the W. J. Dick
ey scholarship fund to "aid young
men from Fresno County, pref
erably Fresno City, to make their
way through Stanford Universi
ty." His $10,000 endowment pro
vides an income of $400 a year for
scholarships.
Individuals Contribute
After the '20's many new schol
arships from gifts and endow
ments were established, mostly
from individuals. In time the Uni
versity trustees established Uni
versity scholarships, and both the
state and federal governments
now give scholarship grants to
Stanford.
Greatest growth in the number
of scholarships has taken place in
the last 10 years. This academic
year 638 undergraduates received
scholarship awards.
A comparison of graduate schol
arships in 1950 and 1957 demon
strates the tremendous increase.
In 1950 only 53 graduate awards
were given, but this year 405 stu
dents received scholarships.
Following is a breakdown of
those contributing scholarships:
University $134,875
Government grants .... 173.217
Gifts:
Business 264,016
Foundations 260,316
Individuals 189,454
Endowments 325,047
$1,346,925
Most, individual scholarship
funds are not established by Stan
ford graduates but by people who
become friends of the University
through contact with its students
or with Hie principles and stand
ards for which it stands. Many
are memorials made by families
of former Stanford students who
have died or were killed in World
Wars I or 11.
The $1.3 million given for stu
dent aid was spent on:

Undergraduate scholar
ships $506,679
Graduate scholarships .. 130,425
Both graduate and
undergraduate 184,12.")
Fellowships 426,232
Grants-in-aid 98,834
Despite this staggering sum,
funds are still inadequate. Only
one out of five entering students
who qualify actually receive
awards.
405 Graduate Awards
Of those requesting entrance to
this year's freshman class, 1733
applied for scholarships, but only
114 were available. In the gradu
ate school 1511 students applied
for the 405 awards given.
The majority of scholarships
are held by students who have
been at Stanford at least one year.
The number of students on schol
arship in each class ranges from
100 to 150 students.
Awarding of scholarships is
handled by the Committee on Fi
nancial Awards. This is a group
of faculty members appointed by
the president and under the chair
manship of dean William Steere.
Working with the committee,
and under its direct control, is the
Financial Aids Office. It functions
as a liaison between applicant and
committee.
This office gives out applica
tions, processes them and corre
sponds with the applicants. It dis
burses the scholarships and fel
lowships in the form of personal
checks on registration day and
aids students who want to con

tart their donors, if they are still
living.
Most student*; rail or write their
donors, and some groups, such as
the George Gamble Scholars, get
together and take their donors to
dinner once each year.
At the head of the Financial
Aids Office is Robert P. Huff as
director of financial aids a new
position recently established to
cordinate all financial aid for un
dergraduates.
Mrs. Olivia Byler is in charge
of undergraduate aid and has been
here for 22 years. When she re
placed her predecessor who had
held the position for 14 years
she remarked, "How could anyone
stay that long?"
Restrictions
Among specific restrictions or
recommendations to be followed
in awarding some of these schol
arships are geographical area, de
partment, kind of student, or
phans, Eagle Scouts, sports, and
descendants of members of Mu
chapter, Gamma Phi P>eta so
rority.
Most unusual and amusing is
the fellowship which must never
be given to any student who has
attended the University of Cali
fornia.
Any scholarship funds received
by the University since February
1957 are "free of restrictions as to
creed, and any restrictions as to
race or nationality are stated only
in terms of the donors' prefer
ence."

At the head of the Financial
Aids Office is Robert P. Huff as
director of financial aids a new
position recently established to
cordinate all financial aid for un
dergraduates.
Mrs. Olivia Byler is in charge
of undergraduate aid and has been
here for 22 years. When she re
placed her predecessor who had
held the position for 14 years
she remarked, "How could anyone
stay that long?"
Restrictions
Among specific restrictions or
recommendations to be followed
in awarding some of these schol
arships are geographical area, de
partment, kind of student, or
phans, Eagle Scouts, sports, and
descendants of members of Mu
chapter, Gamma Phi P>eta so
rority.
Most unusual and amusing is
the fellowship which must never
be given to any student who has
attended the University of Cali
fornia.
Any scholarship funds received
by the University since February
1957 are "free of restrictions as to
creed, and any restrictions as to
race or nationality are stated only
in terms of the donors' prefer
ence."
Scholarship funds at Stanford
have grown to more than $1.3 mil
lion, but are still not adequate to
meet the needs of students.
The need for scholarships did
not always exist at Stanford. Be
fore 1919 there was no tuition, and
few capable students were re
stricted from attending because of
financial need. This is probably
the reason that neither of the
Stanlords' wills provides for
scholarships.
However, Mrs. Stanford estab
lished the first scholarship in 1900,
while she was still alive. It was
called the "Leland Stanford Jr.
Scholarship," and it provided $300
for cost of living and books. In
1900 it paid the room and board
of a student at Encina for the
whole academic year and bought
his books. Today this same-schol
arship provides little more than
tuition cost for one quarter.
The second scholarship, estab
lished in 1914, was the W. J. Dick
ey scholarship fund to "aid young
men from Fresno County, pref
erably Fresno City, to make their
way through Stanford Universi
ty." His $10,000 endowment pro
vides an income of $400 a year for
scholarships.
Individuals Contribute
After the '20's many new schol
arships from gifts and endow
ments were established, mostly
from individuals. In time the Uni
versity trustees established Uni
versity scholarships, and both the
state and federal governments
now give scholarship grants to
Stanford.
Greatest growth in the number
of scholarships has taken place in
the last 10 years. This academic
year 638 undergraduates received
scholarship awards.
A comparison of graduate schol
arships in 1950 and 1957 demon
strates the tremendous increase.
In 1950 only 53 graduate awards
were given, but this year 405 stu
dents received scholarships.
Following is a breakdown of
those contributing scholarships:
University $134,875
Government grants .... 173.217
Gifts:
Business 264,016
Foundations 260,316
Individuals 189,454
Endowments 325,047
$1,346,925
Most, individual scholarship
funds are not established by Stan
ford graduates but by people who
become friends of the University
through contact with its students
or with Hie principles and stand
ards for which it stands. Many
are memorials made by families
of former Stanford students who
have died or were killed in World
Wars I or 11.
The $1.3 million given for stu
dent aid was spent on:

Undergraduate scholar
ships $506,679
Graduate scholarships .. 130,425
Both graduate and
undergraduate 184,12.")
Fellowships 426,232
Grants-in-aid 98,834
Despite this staggering sum,
funds are still inadequate. Only
one out of five entering students
who qualify actually receive
awards.
405 Graduate Awards
Of those requesting entrance to
this year's freshman class, 1733
applied for scholarships, but only
114 were available. In the gradu
ate school 1511 students applied
for the 405 awards given.
The majority of scholarships
are held by students who have
been at Stanford at least one year.
The number of students on schol
arship in each class ranges from
100 to 150 students.
Awarding of scholarships is
handled by the Committee on Fi
nancial Awards. This is a group
of faculty members appointed by
the president and under the chair
manship of dean William Steere.
Working with the committee,
and under its direct control, is the
Financial Aids Office. It functions
as a liaison between applicant and
committee.
This office gives out applica
tions, processes them and corre
sponds with the applicants. It dis
burses the scholarships and fel
lowships in the form of personal
checks on registration day and
aids students who want to con

tart their donors, if they are still
living.
Most student*; rail or write their
donors, and some groups, such as
the George Gamble Scholars, get
together and take their donors to
dinner once each year.

ate school 1511 students applied
for the 405 awards given.
The majority of scholarships
are held by students who have
been at Stanford at least one year.
The number of students on schol
arship in each class ranges from
100 to 150 students.
Awarding of scholarships is
handled by the Committee on Fi
nancial Awards. This is a group
of faculty members appointed by
the president and under the chair
manship of dean William Steere.
Working with the committee,
and under its direct control, is the
Financial Aids Office. It functions
as a liaison between applicant and
committee.
This office gives out applica
tions, processes them and corre
sponds with the applicants. It dis
burses the scholarships and fel
lowships in the form of personal
checks on registration day and
aids students who want to con

tart their donors, if they are still
living.
Most student*; rail or write their
donors, and some groups, such as
the George Gamble Scholars, get
together and take their donors to
dinner once each year.
At the head of the Financial
Aids Office is Robert P. Huff as
director of financial aids a new
position recently established to
cordinate all financial aid for un
dergraduates.
Mrs. Olivia Byler is in charge
of undergraduate aid and has been
here for 22 years. When she re
placed her predecessor who had
held the position for 14 years
she remarked, "How could anyone
stay that long?"
Restrictions
Among specific restrictions or
recommendations to be followed
in awarding some of these schol
arships are geographical area, de
partment, kind of student, or
phans, Eagle Scouts, sports, and
descendants of members of Mu
chapter, Gamma Phi P>eta so
rority.
Most unusual and amusing is
the fellowship which must never
be given to any student who has
attended the University of Cali
fornia.
Any scholarship funds received
by the University since February
1957 are "free of restrictions as to
creed, and any restrictions as to
race or nationality are stated only
in terms of the donors' prefer
ence."
Scholarship funds at Stanford
have grown to more than $1.3 mil
lion, but are still not adequate to
meet the needs of students.
The need for scholarships did
not always exist at Stanford. Be
fore 1919 there was no tuition, and
few capable students were re
stricted from attending because of
financial need. This is probably
the reason that neither of the
Stanlords' wills provides for
scholarships.
However, Mrs. Stanford estab
lished the first scholarship in 1900,
while she was still alive. It was
called the "Leland Stanford Jr.
Scholarship," and it provided $300
for cost of living and books. In
1900 it paid the room and board
of a student at Encina for the
whole academic year and bought
his books. Today this same-schol
arship provides little more than
tuition cost for one quarter.
The second scholarship, estab
lished in 1914, was the W. J. Dick
ey scholarship fund to "aid young
men from Fresno County, pref
erably Fresno City, to make their
way through Stanford Universi
ty." His $10,000 endowment pro
vides an income of $400 a year for
scholarships.
Individuals Contribute
After the '20's many new schol
arships from gifts and endow
ments were established, mostly
from individuals. In time the Uni
versity trustees established Uni
versity scholarships, and both the
state and federal governments
now give scholarship grants to
Stanford.
Greatest growth in the number
of scholarships has taken place in
the last 10 years. This academic
year 638 undergraduates received
scholarship awards.
A comparison of graduate schol
arships in 1950 and 1957 demon
strates the tremendous increase.
In 1950 only 53 graduate awards
were given, but this year 405 stu
dents received scholarships.
Following is a breakdown of
those contributing scholarships:
University $134,875
Government grants .... 173.217
Gifts:
Business 264,016
Foundations 260,316
Individuals 189,454
Endowments 325,047
$1,346,925
Most, individual scholarship
funds are not established by Stan
ford graduates but by people who
become friends of the University
through contact with its students
or with Hie principles and stand
ards for which it stands. Many
are memorials made by families
of former Stanford students who
have died or were killed in World
Wars I or 11.
