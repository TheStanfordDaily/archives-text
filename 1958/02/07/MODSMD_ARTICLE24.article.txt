# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
A (*oo<l I ooMmII Man Departs
Stanford and fool ball will loso a pood man when George Lynn
moves into Ihe insurance business in the very near future. Lynn was
one of the mosl valuable of the Stanford corps of assistants during
his seven ycai here with his wealth of technical knowledge about
the game.
George was also one of the really "nice guys" in the coaching
field. K.isy to find and easy to talk to, it's a pleasure to associate
with him.
George has taken ;i long time since November, in fact in reach
ing a derision about whether or not to continue in coaching. As far
as family life is concerned, he was probably wise to leave the field.
There's no more hectic existence than a coach's, especially in season.
As far as football goes, though, he'll be missed. Best of luck, George,
and we'll be looking lor you .'it Stanford games.
Howie Dallmar's Indian eagers may not be enjoying the best sea
son a Stanford team has ever had, but they've pulled off a pair of
upsets in games where no one ever gave them a chance. In Decem
ber, it was Stanford 50, I\SF 19. And just last week, Stanford 09,
Oregon State 57.
USF is ranked as high as third in the nation, and OSC was knock
ing on the door <>| the top ten before they were shocked by the In
dians and Washington. At any rate, it's interesting to note how
Dallmar compares the two clubs, and how he-guided his Indians to
victory over each.
(Jetting a fair comparison on the two is a bit difficult, because
OSC was hurt by the loss of l.ee llarinan, says Dallmar. Harnian
was 1he guard who killed the Cards when OSC romped to victory
flown here a couple of weeks ago. But taking Harman's loss inlo
consideration, Dallmar concludes, "I think USF is a little hit
stronger."
Stanford used almost the same method to beat each of the lop
heavy favorites hold on to the ball and wait for a shot. In both
games, this tactic paid off as the Cards drew fouls and then made
the most of their free-throw opportunities. At Corvallis, they hit
on 33 of 41 charity tosses, despite missing four in the closing mo
ments of play. Against USF, Stanford made all but its last free toss
of the game.
As far as the slow-down is concerned, it's true that Ihey did have
an easier time of it against OSC, simply because they were ahead
of the Beavers all the way. Against USF, Stanford led at just two
points- 1-0 and 50-49.
Dallmar says his club will try this same game-shortening strategy
Ihe rest of the season.
All Sorts of Other Things
There aren't any varsity basketball games on this weekend, but
there're a few other sports events on campus which figure to be
pretty interesting. This afternoon at 2:30, Stanford fans can take
a look at the man who's probably the second-best tennis player in
the world, Lew Hoad. He'll be working in preparation for his forth
coming matches with Pancho Gon/ales at the Cow Palace and other
spots all over the United States. Iload has been giving Gonzales fits
in Australia recently, and might wind up the number one player by
the time their 100-match tour ends.
Tonight and tomorrow, there's wrestling. At 7:30 p.m., Cal comes
to the local mats, and then all day tomorrow there's a frosh invita-

tional which will become an an
nual affair if there's sufficient
interest.

This afternoon's big eventâ€”
rugby. UCLA vs. Stanford, and
I if it's anything like last year's
I thriller, it'll be well worth a
1 couple hours of time. In '.77, Rick
MciYlillin was the hero as his last
minute try beat the Brnins. To
night in the Pavilion, it's civil
war time as the Braves meet the
Papooses in the round ball sport.
Dick Clcgg, the Braves' mentor,
will try to beat the club he
coached last season. And finally,
for the baseball fan, there's a
I clinic tomorrow sponsored by
Stanford and the S.F. Giants,
j Lots of big names will be on hand
for the lectures and demonstra
tions, which'll lasl all day.
DON'T FEEL BAD DKPT.
i That's how the varsity cagers
j should look at their 17-point per
formance in the first half against
Oregon. Just recall a game of
the 30's, when the Olympic Club
held Stanford scoreless for a half.
UNLIKELY NAME DEPT.
Who'd ever think that Bob Booz
;er woidd be in good enough
I shape to outseore Wilt the Stilt
by seven and lead his Kansas
State team to a victory over
Chamberlain and Kansas.
