# Card-Bruin Rugby Tilt May Hinge on Kicking
## Lineups 
### 
Stanford will go into action!
against the UCLA ruggers at 3:30 i
this afternoon on the Indian rugby j
field, located behind the Sunken
Diamond.
The scrums and backfields of
the two teams are evenly matched,
which may make the foot all-im
portant. The Tribe's Kyrk Reid
will have to have his toe in tip-top
shape to match the kicking of
John Dowse and Steve Gertsman
of the Bruins.
Vet from Down Under
Dowse is a two-year veteran
from Australia who does every
thing from his first-five position.

man proved his kicking ability
during the past football season
when he booted a 35-yard field
goal against Illinois.
The game could well develop
into a contest of punting as it did
two years ago when UCLA last
visited Stanford. That year A 1
Kirkland booted for the Indians.
This time the Cards' Trev Grimm
should be able to hold his own
with Bert Frescura since he's been
improving each week.
Won First Two
After winning its first two

games of the year against the
Peninsula Ramblers, Stanford had
tr o u b1 e getting the line-outs
against the big Olympic Club
scrum. As a result, the Indians
had to settle for a tie. Nonethe
less, John Clark did a great job
in the scrum for Pete Kmetovic's
club.
Eric Protiva will have his job
cut out for him today if he is to
keep up the "Jones-Wiggin" tra
dition of gelling the ball on line
outs. Ile'll be battling the heav
iest man on last fall's Bruin var
sity football team, 230-pound Tom
Avery.
Jim Honeywell, who has scored
the most tries of any Indian this
year, and Sid Garber, who's play
ed well at wing, will both be in
the starting backfield for Stan
ford.
Speed and Know-How
Joining them will be Tom Mc-
Manus and Dennis Curshaw, both
of whom have displayed tremen
dous speed and know-how all year.
They've looked particularly well
with Dave Scholz feeding them
the ball from his scrum-half posi
tion.
The backfield will be helped
with the appearance of Jack Tay
lor. He'll be getting his first start
since suffering a bad shoulder in
jury. Taylor has been a star brok
en-field runner since 1934, when
he gained a starting berth as a
freshman.

Stanford will go into action!
against the UCLA ruggers at 3:30 i
this afternoon on the Indian rugby j
field, located behind the Sunken
Diamond.
The scrums and backfields of
the two teams are evenly matched,
which may make the foot all-im
portant. The Tribe's Kyrk Reid
will have to have his toe in tip-top
shape to match the kicking of
John Dowse and Steve Gertsman
of the Bruins.
Vet from Down Under
Dowse is a two-year veteran
from Australia who does every
thing from his first-five position.

when he booted a 35-yard field
goal against Illinois.
The game could well develop
into a contest of punting as it did
two years ago when UCLA last

This time the Cards' Trev Grimm
should be able to hold his own
with Bert Frescura since he's been
improving each week.
Won First Two
After winning its first two

games of the year against the
Peninsula Ramblers, Stanford had
tr o u b1 e getting the line-outs
against the big Olympic Club
scrum. As a result, the Indians
had to settle for a tie. Nonethe
less, John Clark did a great job
in the scrum for Pete Kmetovic's
club.
Eric Protiva will have his job
cut out for him today if he is to
keep up the "Jones-Wiggin" tra
dition of gelling the ball on line
outs. Ile'll be battling the heav
iest man on last fall's Bruin var

Jim Honeywell, who has scored
the most tries of any Indian this
year, and Sid Garber, who's play
ed well at wing, will both be in
the starting backfield for Stan
ford.
Speed and Know-How
Joining them will be Tom Mc-
Manus and Dennis Curshaw, both
of whom have displayed tremen

They've looked particularly well
with Dave Scholz feeding them
the ball from his scrum-half posi
