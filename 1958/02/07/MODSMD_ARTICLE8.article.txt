### Jack Clumeck 
In yesterday'-s political talk at
the weekly meeting of the lIR.
Roeslan Baboe, Indonesian consul
at San Francisco, presented a com
prehensive, up-to-the-minute dis
cussion of the tense and clouded
situation in his home country.
Considering first the political
situation in Indonesia today, the
consul stated that the parliament,
composed of 260 members elected
in 1955, is roughly split among
four major groups. The largest
groups are the Indonesian Nation
alist and Moslem parties, each
with 57 members. In third place
are the Orthodox Moslems, with
43 votes. The Communist party
at present has 39 members.
Guided Democracy?
With reference to a question
about "guided democracy" in In
donesia. the consul replied that
the "parliament has not perform
ed its duty as expected; the people
want strong leadership."
Referring to current economic
and political problems, he contin
ued that the people must "work
together for mutual assistance to
solve these problems."
The rest of Baboe's talk cen
tered around the current Dutch-
Indonesian situation. He first con
sidered Indonesian territorial ex
pansion from the home islands
into Dutch West New Guinea.
The consul's argument in favor
! of Indonesia's annexation of West
| New Guinea is based on his state

ment that his country does not
"w ant to expand its territory.
West New Guinea is our terri
tory; we just want it back."
He substantiated this point by
citing several instances where the
area in question was considered
an integral part of the Nether
lands East Indies. Netherlands
East Indies was superseded in
1945 by Ihe United States of Indo
nesia. He ended this argument by
the statement that Indonesia sim
ply wants to "keep our rights."
Nationalization?
In connection with the "Dutch,
Go Home!" movement in Indo
nesia, Baboe emphasized Ihe fact
I hat "all Dutch holdings are still
Dutch property; they are simply
under the supervision of the Indo
nesian government." Although
outwardly the expropriation of
Dutch property, the profits are
still going to the owners.
The Indonesian consul stressed
the fact that this "is not national
ization." When nationalization did
take place, as cited by the exam
ples of a bank and a gas company,
Baboe stated that there was "com
pensation"; the corporations wore
"purchased when nationalized."
In conclusion, Baboe closed with
two remarks which apparently re
flected the philosophy of his coun
try: Indonesia is striving for "nor
malization in all sectors politi
cally, socially, economically with
Ihe Dutch. Now is Ihe time for us
lo take Ihe initiative."
