# CONDUCTOR SALGO REVIVES PERFORMANCE
## Stanford Symphony's Poor Beginning Improves Greatly After Intermission 
### Elna Rodenhouse 
"Be careful the second night is
a had one in the theater," said
conductor Sandor Salgo to his or
chestra before their performance
yesterday afternoon.
The members laughed to them
selves, reminiscent of the smaller
than - usual audience's warm re
ception of the same numbers last
Friday night. Then the orchestra
proceeded, during the first half of
yesterday's concert, to make their
conductor's prediction come true.

The first half of the concert
featured Verdi's "Overture to La
Forza del Destino" and Beetho
ven's "Concerto for Violin and Or
chestra in D Major," with Concert
mistress Gloria Vial as soloist.
The Verdi is rather melodra
matic in composition and was
played that way, with just a touch
of Mantovani when the strings
forgot to watch and straggled as
much as a beat behind. The "fan
tastic points of coincidence and
accident" as performed by the or
chestra were forgotten by a re
ceptive audience as they excelled
in creating the emotional effects
desired by the composer.
Continues Unperturbed
Miss Vial, who turned in an ex
cellent performance Friday night,
couldn't quite equal it yesterday.
She bore bravely the occasional
wrong notes coming from the
background and didn't even wince
visibly when she herself hit a few
sour notes.
On the first cadenza especially
she turned in a powerful combina
tion of runs, quiet melody and
double stops —as the two- and
three-note chords on the violin arc
called.
The second movement showed
off Mis-s Vial's command of the
difficult ranges of the violin to
perfection as she wandered me
lodically and quietly through the
theme.
Creates Lightness
The third movement, a rondo,
was a happy expression of mas
tery of the violin. Miss Vial didn't
disappoint her audience when she
led the orchestra into creating the
light effect in so many of Beetho
ven's quick movements.
The second half of the concert
featured Franck's "Symphony in
D Minor." The difference between
the first and second parts was re
markable. The first movement
found director Salgo leading his
orchestra into unexpected emo
tional depths with the varying
shades of dynamics.
The second movement's theme
was first introduced by the harps
and then was found by the Kng
li-sh horn and played very well by
Betty Cawthron, a senior at Men
lo-Atherton II ig h School. The
theme, under conductor Salgo'.s
guidance, wound in and out of
nearly every section in the or

chestra. holding the audience
spellbound.
The third movement is a modi
fied sonata and was played capti
vatingly by an orchestra which
was now bent on giving a really
good performance.
Conductor Salgo's leadership of
the group was one of the big fac
tors of the group's revival in the
second half. The dynamic leader
showed hc*vv much complete con
trol of the orchestra can change a
poor performance into a very
good one.

" —the Second Night Is a Had One in the Theater"
"Be careful the second night is
a had one in the theater," said
conductor Sandor Salgo to his or
chestra before their performance
yesterday afternoon.
The members laughed to them
selves, reminiscent of the smaller
than - usual audience's warm re
ception of the same numbers last
Friday night. Then the orchestra
proceeded, during the first half of
yesterday's concert, to make their
conductor's prediction come true.

The first half of the concert
featured Verdi's "Overture to La
Forza del Destino" and Beetho
ven's "Concerto for Violin and Or
chestra in D Major," with Concert
mistress Gloria Vial as soloist.
The Verdi is rather melodra
matic in composition and was
played that way, with just a touch
of Mantovani when the strings
forgot to watch and straggled as
much as a beat behind. The "fan
tastic points of coincidence and
accident" as performed by the or
chestra were forgotten by a re
ceptive audience as they excelled
in creating the emotional effects
desired by the composer.
Continues Unperturbed
Miss Vial, who turned in an ex
cellent performance Friday night,
couldn't quite equal it yesterday.
She bore bravely the occasional
wrong notes coming from the
background and didn't even wince
visibly when she herself hit a few
sour notes.
On the first cadenza especially
she turned in a powerful combina
tion of runs, quiet melody and
double stops —as the two- and
three-note chords on the violin arc
called.
The second movement showed
off Mis-s Vial's command of the
difficult ranges of the violin to
perfection as she wandered me
lodically and quietly through the
theme.
Creates Lightness
The third movement, a rondo,
was a happy expression of mas
tery of the violin. Miss Vial didn't
disappoint her audience when she
led the orchestra into creating the
light effect in so many of Beetho
ven's quick movements.
The second half of the concert
featured Franck's "Symphony in
D Minor." The difference between
the first and second parts was re
markable. The first movement
found director Salgo leading his
orchestra into unexpected emo
tional depths with the varying
shades of dynamics.
The second movement's theme
was first introduced by the harps
and then was found by the Kng
li-sh horn and played very well by
Betty Cawthron, a senior at Men
lo-Atherton II ig h School. The
theme, under conductor Salgo'.s
guidance, wound in and out of
nearly every section in the or

chestra. holding the audience
spellbound.
The third movement is a modi
fied sonata and was played capti
vatingly by an orchestra which
was now bent on giving a really
good performance.
Conductor Salgo's leadership of
the group was one of the big fac
tors of the group's revival in the
second half. The dynamic leader
showed hc*vv much complete con
trol of the orchestra can change a
poor performance into a very
good one.
