# Vengeance in Tunisia
## 
### 
Saturday's "vengeance raid" in Tunisia, in
which 25 French planes bombed a liny vill age
which had reportedly been harboring Algerian
rebels, was one of the most shocking examples
to date of French policy in North Africa.
An estimated 100 persons were killed and
scores injured in an attack which the French
government regards as "a local military inci
dent." This incident, so far as the French are
concerned, was as local and as internal a prob
lem as an uprising in Bordeaux, or Lyons, or
any other provincial center would he; for, even
though Tunisia has been freed from French
political domination, it, along with Algeria and
Morocco, is by divine irmch.
French national morale cannot sustain I Ik*
loss of France's North African empire. France s
economic grip on Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco
has been evidenced by her unwillingness lo
allow their participation in the newly-formed
European Common Market. Northwest Africa
is a French sphere of influence, in the fine old
19th-century tradition.
The situation in Tunisia is similar to that in
Red China during the Korean War. Algerian
rebels hide out in Tunisia and 111; ike raids
across the border, as Chinese planes did in
Korea from their bases in China. The I nited
Nations wisely decided not to spread the
Korean war into another country. So has
France, theoreticallv; for North Africa is '"one
and indivisible"' and French.
It is unfortunate that France chose North
Africa as a means of bolstering her national
pride, for her interests are in violent conflict
with the emerging nationalism in that area,

and the world trend indicates which side will
win.
French North African policy has been un
realistic in the extreme. Instead o( admitting
I lie futility of the political and military silua
tion. and accepting a face-saving and economi
cally valuable commonwealth arrangement
with the North African countries, France has
insisted on an all-out and fruitless military
ellort which may lose her the economic advan
tages she wants as well as her political power.
Franee cannot win her war vvilli Algeria.
Mul she ran save her economic influence in
North Africa. When the French freed Tunisia
and Morocco, they predicted that those coun
tries could not subsist without French aid.'l hey
proved lo he right. French economic influence
is jusl as great there now as il was before Tii
nisian and Moroccan independence. By carry
ing the Algerian war to I unisia, Trance may
endanger her economic hold on all of North
Africa.
'The North African situation abounds with
comparisons to the folly of other countries.
France is like England, whose never-say-die
attitude ended all British influence in Ireland.
She is also like Italy, who, in the first part of
this centurv, had to decide on being either the
smallest of the great powers or the largest of
the small powers. Italy took the former course
in World War II and lost.
France is no longer a great power, and her
political outlook must adjust itself accordingly.
But she can be one of the most prosperous and
influential of the "middle-sized powers, if she
will only wake up lo reality.

Saturday's "vengeance raid" in Tunisia, in
which 25 French planes bombed a liny vill age
which had reportedly been harboring Algerian
rebels, was one of the most shocking examples
to date of French policy in North Africa.
An estimated 100 persons were killed and
scores injured in an attack which the French
government regards as "a local military inci
dent." This incident, so far as the French are
concerned, was as local and as internal a prob
lem as an uprising in Bordeaux, or Lyons, or
any other provincial center would he; for, even
though Tunisia has been freed from French
political domination, it, along with Algeria and
Morocco, is by divine irmch.
