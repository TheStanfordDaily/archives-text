W A Depressing Atmosphere'
Editor, The Daily:
It is my understanding that about 700 gradu
ate students, of which I am one, dine at Encina
Commons. If they feel as I do, and a number of
them have so indicated, there is a situation in
the Commons that calls for collection.
This matter does not concern tlie menu, which
is, I think, well chosen and well prepared. Nor
does it concern the service of the meals. Tt has
to do only with the physical plant.
These students, presumably the more "aware"
individuals, to judge by their status in life, eat
in rooms over which the armed forces might face
mutiny. They are vast rooms with very bare
walls, dismally painted and fitted out. A depress
ing atmosphere indeed in which to eat three
meals a day, seven days a week, etc., however
well prepared and served. Hardly conducive to
cheerful and optimistic attitudes on the part of
the intellectual leaders of tomorrow.
I wonder if other Encina diners have any sug
gestons for a remedy? Personally, 1 would like
to see the students of the Architecture Depart
ment make some studies on how to brighten the
place up inexpensively. Make a good project.

Then perhaps the art students would hang some
of their work on the vast walls. If a little money
and some scrap materials were gathered, per
haps some electrical engineers would install a
music system rock & roll, folk songs, chamber
music, whatever.
Having no idea of how to begin organizing such
an enterprise on this campus, I resort to The
Daily and iis readers. Help!

No Propaganda
Editor, The Daily:
As president of the Stanford Arab Club, I
would like to write this answer to Jean Louis
Germain.
1 want to say thai Iho club hadn't any political
propaganda, if you had seen the publications
yon would be assured about that, but it seems to
rne you didn't.
All the publications, I picked by myself from
embassies in San Francisco, were about economy,
projects, travel magazines . . . etc., not a single
political one.
So as you must have seen, our propaganda was
not political.
