in the midyear period. But before
Congress adjourns the situation
will have to be reviewed."
Humphrey, who said he regards

backlog of reclamation projects
and public works which can be
used for I tie purpose of combating

ing tab on a number of projects
that have been approved by the
Army engineers, authorized by
