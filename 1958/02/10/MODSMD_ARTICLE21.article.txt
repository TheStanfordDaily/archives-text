This movie, adapted by Marcel
Pagnol from Alphonse Daudet's
stories "Les Let ties demon moil
lin," offers a whimsical and often
hilarious trilogy of exposing hu
man weakness at its most lovable
level.
The three stories are tradition
al Provence folktales, which Dau
det. gathered and sent back to
Paris from his windmill in the
"Midi" of France. The stories are
traditionally based on fact. They
show the subtle combination of
dry humor and human compas
sion, gruffness and drollery that
is so characteristic of the Proven
cal, a personality unique in this
world of commonplaces.
The first story concerns a me
dieval priest who has conquered
all his sins but that of gluttony.
His altar boy has lost to the devil
playing cards, and the devil gets

to inhabit his body as a reward.
With this eerie fact as a take- j
off point, the story unwinds to !
find the devil in the body of the
altar boy templing the poor
priest with savory descriptions of I
the food being cooked in the
kitchens below the church.
The second story, "Reverend
Father Gaucher's Elixir," deli
cately handles the question of
whether to do the lesser evil to
produce Ihe greater good.
Through the death of a lowly
brother's Aunt Begonia, a most
unreligious woman, the order ob
tains the secret to Tante Bego
nia's home-brew cordial. This li
queur is transformed into a gen
eral cure-all in the mind of the
head father, and the monastery
commences to turn il out by the
case for sale to "apothecaries."
The grand conflict is reached
when Pere Gaucher, who alone
has a delicate enough palate to
tell when the recipe is fulfilled in

each batch, discovers that he is
j becoming a drunkard.
The story climaxes with all the
brothers gathered in the chapel
saying the prayers by the found
ler of the order, which include
! plenary indulgence, while Pere
Gaucher is in the "laboratory,"
roaring drunk, singing the evil
songs that Tante Begonia taught
him when he toddled at her knee.
The final talc of the trilogy
deals with the fact that suspicion
and pride only too often separate
us from the goodness and love
that lie within our fellow men.
The plot concerns an old man
who indulges in suspicious and
pitiful tactics to cover up the fact
that competing powered mills
have outmoded his beloved wind
driven mill. This story, about
Daudet's favorite subject- wind
mills, shows Daudet at his most
delicate and heart-moving peak,
and the way in which the mys
tery is solved renews one's faith
in the human race.
