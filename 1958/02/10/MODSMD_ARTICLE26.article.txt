# Tribe Ruggers Tie Bruins, 3-3
## 
### 
Stanford's ruggers wore hold lo a 3-3 tic by tho Bruins of UCLA
on Friday afternoon in a tough match on the muddy rugby field.
Although both teams displayed speedy backfields, the scrums
halted all ground movements short of tho end zone. As a result,
place kicks from tho toes of Jack Dowse of UCLA and Kyrk K.oid

(jf Stanford accounted for all the
scoring.
UCLA started out strong as
they controlled almost all the
scrums in the first half through
-the efforts of hooker Torn Hall.
They drew first blood late in the
half on Dowse's kick which was
good for 25 yards from a slight
angle.
Helpful Hurklaiul
Phil Burkland was especially
helpful to Stanford during this
half as he intercepted numerous
passes from the Bruins' lateral
series.
The Indians struck back and
tied up the game after three min
utes of the second half on Reid's
kick which was good for 30 yards
at a bad angle. Stanford kept
tapping at the end zone door Ihe
rest of the afternoon but erratic
passes and bad angles on penalty

j kicks proved to be Stanford's
i ruin.
Several players stood out for
each team in this hard â€¢ fought
match. Indians Tom McManus,
Trev Grimm, Dave Scholz and
John Clark matched the fired-up
J play of Chuck Hollaway, Jack
: Dowse, Tom Avery and Dave Pe
j terson of UCLA.
Grimm saved the day for Stan
ford many times with open field
tackles of the fast Bruin backs.
Chuck Hollaway was the most
frequent victim of these tackles
as he used his tremendous speed
to break into the open only to
run into the waiting arms of
Grimm.
Scholz' Best Game
Dave Scholz had his best game
of the year from his scrum half
or quarterback position. Scholz
showed his tremendous knowl
edge of the game by using the
pop kick at the right moment,
knowing when to pass and when
to run or eat the ball.
Tom McManus and John Clark
several times used their speed to
break loose for sizeable gains.
McManus used the pop kick to
advantage to combat the kicking
arsenal of Dowse who displayed
all types of kicks.
Stanford's record now stands
at two wins and two ties. The
ruggers did a good job in holding
UCLA to a tie as the Bruins
brought a good team to the
Farm. This same team beat a
stellar squad from the Olympic
Club of San Francisco on Satur
day by a big margin, and 1110
Olympic Club had previously hold
Stanford to a tie.
