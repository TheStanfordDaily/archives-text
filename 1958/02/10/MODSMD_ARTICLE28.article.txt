## Half-Game Separates Four Clubs 
### Associated Press 
Passing the halfway point, it's
still anybody's rare for the Pa
cific Coast Conference basketball
championship.
Well, maybe not anybody's.
Washington State, Stanford and
Oregon appear out of the running.
Hut the other six members are
still in contention, with Ihe top
four only a half-game apart.
Southern California's Trojans
made the biggest -strides over the
week end, knocking California out
of a tie for the lead Friday night,
58-48, and moving themselves to
within lay-up distance of the top
by downing Washington State, 54-
49, Saturday.
Pete Newell's poised California
Bears bounced right back, how
ever, and shot down the high-fly
ing UCLA lkuins Saturday night,
61-58, to get back their share of
first place.
It's now UCLA and Cal with 6-2
records, USC and Oregon State
at 6-3, Idaho— after a disastrous
week end- 5-4, and fast-closing
Washington 4-5. Oregon State and
Idaho play tonight.
Top game on tap for the coming
week end is the USC-Cal rematch,
set for Saturday night at Berke-

ley. Among the other leaders. Or
egon State draws a bye and UCLA
makes the rugged three-game
road trip into the Northwest.
The Trojans, with their flock of
sophomores getting more experi
enced all the time, looked impres
sive in the week-end action. They
outsteadied the ball - controlling
Bears Friday and disclosed a rug
ged defense and strong shooting
in their conquest of the Cougars.
UCLA, ragged in a 72-64 win
over Washington State Friday,
started off on the wrong foot
against the Bears and never could
catch up Saturday. With Earl
Robinson, Don Mcintosh and Al
Buch scoring steadily off beauti
fully set-up plays, Cal moved to a
14-point lead before the Bruins
finally got untracked halfway
through the final period. But then
it was too late.
Idaho's misfortunes began Fri
day when they were ice cold from
the floor and lost, 56-49, to Wash
ington. The next night they rack
ed up 75 points and found it was
not enough against red-hot Char
lie Franklin and his Oregon team
mates. Franklin tanked 35 points
in the Webfoots' 82-75 victory.

Southern California's Trojans
made the biggest -strides over the
week end, knocking California out
of a tie for the lead Friday night,
58-48, and moving themselves to
