split in the four remaining lilts
in their 20-8 loss to the Golden
Bears.
Bruce Edelson, lfi? - pounder,
went the limit in deeisioning his
man, and Edelson seemed to have
the advantage most of the way
through it. Damuth called his
performance "a very thorough
job."
Heavyweight Karl Huffhauer
took Stanford's only pin of the
evening, shouldering his man at
2:40 of the first period. "It was
n't really a contest," Damuth not
ed. "Karl was decidedly supe
rior."

Coach Don Damuth's Stanford
varsity wrestlers tried their best
Friday night but eouldn't plow
the California grapplers under
the Eneina Gym mats. After giv
ing away four weight classes,
half the scheduled card, the
Cards bounced back to t;ike a
split in the four remaining lilts
in their 20-8 loss to the Golden
Bears.
Bruce Edelson, lfi? - pounder,
went the limit in deeisioning his
man, and Edelson seemed to have
the advantage most of the way
through it. Damuth called his
performance "a very thorough
job."
Heavyweight Karl Huffhauer
took Stanford's only pin of the
evening, shouldering his man at
2:40 of the first period. "It was
n't really a contest," Damuth not
ed. "Karl was decidedly supe
rior."
Bill Dudman was decisioned by
Cal's Dick Cureton in their 157-
pound match and Stanford's Rog
er Edelson was pinned in the 177-
pound division.
The Farm's crop of freshman
wrestlers did ;ill right for them
selves ;it their six-school invita
tional meet held in the Pavilion
on Saturday. The Card mat year
lings walked away winners of the
meet with 38 total points. Other
participating schools placed in
the following order: San Jose JC,
27; Modesto JC, 19; San Jose
State, 17; Cal Poly and Cal, 10.
Two members of the local
squad walked off with first
places in the tourney. Art Spie
gel, whose showings were report
edly the most colorful of the
meet, grabbed a blue ribbon in
the heavyweight division while
Larry Meyers walked off with
one in the 177-pound class.
Other Stanford men who placed
in the meet include Pete Barn
hisel, second among the 147-
pounders; Dick Denney, a second
at 167 pounds; and Dan Garrett,
fourth, 157 pounds.
The locals did exceptionally
well in taking the meet as they
have been hampered like their
varsity brothers in being unable
to put men in all divisions. In
this meet Stanford went unrepre
sented in the 123-, 130- and 137-
pound classes.
