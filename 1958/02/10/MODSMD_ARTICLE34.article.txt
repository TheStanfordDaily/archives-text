# Papoosens Split Two-Game Weekend; Win Over JV's, Lose to Menlo Oaks
## 
### Alan Miller 
Stanford's Papooses upset their
superiors, the Stanford Braves, 69-
62, Friday night in the Pavilion,
but were trounced. 55-50, by the
Menlo Park Junior College var
sity Saturday night on the Oaks'
floor.
Playing their best game since
the Olympic Club feat, the year
lings dominated play throughout
Friday night's tilt. The Braves
broke the ice with the first score,
but the freshmen, with a phe
nomenal 50 per cent shooting av
erage, took the lead in the first
half and at one time held a 12-
point advantage.
The frosh were working like a
team, with 6-10 center Bob Whe-,
lan controlling the backboards
and dropping the shots down.
Realizing they were in quite a
jam, the Braves poured on the
fuel but could only climb back to
a 37-32 deficit at intermission.
Neck and Neck
The second half was a neck-and
neck ball game all the way, al
though the Braves seemed to suf
fer a lack of teamwork. Kent
Carter, JV season high scorer,
and Tom Crawford, much im
proved in the offensive ranks, did
most ni' the Braves' shooting,
while Phil Joujon-Roche grabbed
the rebounds.
Still both teams were hitting
consistently. The JV's made a
flourish in the closing minutes,
but it wasn't enough, as they
went down in defeat to the fresh
men, 69-62.
Crawford led the evening's scor
ing with 17, while Carter had 13
and Joujon-Roche 9. For the frosh
Whelan topped with 16, Bub Bow
ling knocked in 15, Tom Nord
land did his best yet with 14 and
Gary Estabrook sank 10.
A Different. Club
Saturday night the frosh looked
like a different ball club. Nothing
worked. Partially hampered by
the Oaks' cracker-box gym. no one
could drop in their shots, ball
handling was poor and the Pa
pooses seemed to lack their usual
"drive."
Stanford scored first and held
th.* lead five minutes into the half.
Then they lost their lead, never to
regain it the entire evening. Bow
ling's passing wasn't up to par,
and Estabrook couldn't connect
on his long shots. Menlo's Jim
Wood and Dick West lake kept
sinking their shots from under
the basket and past Stanford's
Whelan. Half-time score was 31-
22, Menlo.

In the second half Stanford got j
hot and narrowed the distance to j
35-38 five minutes into the stanza. I
There seemed to lie a curse on j
making those three needed points, j
Every time the Papooses scored,
Menlo came back with two more.
Six Minutes to Go
With six minutes still remain
ing, Stanford caught up to a -4T- IS
score but still seemed to have that
jinx on them. With four minutes
left and the frosh five lagging, I
50-48, the Oaks pulled a freeze
which proved yearlings' doom.
The remaining time was con
sumed by Menlo playing five-cor
nereed catch, and in attempting j
to steal the ball Stanford fouled
them constantly. In the final sec
onds, with the frosh in possession,

Nordland sank a 30-foot jump
shot for the 55-50 count.
Whelan tapped in a record 20
for the evening, while Bowling
dropped in 9 in the Papooses' sec
ond spot.

Six Minutes to Go
With six minutes still remain
ing, Stanford caught up to a -4T- IS
score but still seemed to have that
jinx on them. With four minutes
left and the frosh five lagging, I
50-48, the Oaks pulled a freeze
which proved yearlings' doom.
The remaining time was con
sumed by Menlo playing five-cor
nereed catch, and in attempting j
to steal the ball Stanford fouled
them constantly. In the final sec
onds, with the frosh in possession,

Nordland sank a 30-foot jump
shot for the 55-50 count.
Whelan tapped in a record 20
for the evening, while Bowling
dropped in 9 in the Papooses' sec

Stanford's Papooses upset their
superiors, the Stanford Braves, 69-
62, Friday night in the Pavilion,
but were trounced. 55-50, by the
Menlo Park Junior College var
sity Saturday night on the Oaks'
floor.
Playing their best game since
the Olympic Club feat, the year
lings dominated play throughout
Friday night's tilt. The Braves
broke the ice with the first score,
but the freshmen, with a phe
nomenal 50 per cent shooting av
erage, took the lead in the first
half and at one time held a 12-
point advantage.
The frosh were working like a
team, with 6-10 center Bob Whe-,
lan controlling the backboards
and dropping the shots down.
Realizing they were in quite a
jam, the Braves poured on the
fuel but could only climb back to
a 37-32 deficit at intermission.
Neck and Neck
The second half was a neck-and
neck ball game all the way, al
though the Braves seemed to suf
fer a lack of teamwork. Kent
Carter, JV season high scorer,
and Tom Crawford, much im
proved in the offensive ranks, did
most ni' the Braves' shooting,
while Phil Joujon-Roche grabbed
the rebounds.
Still both teams were hitting
consistently. The JV's made a
flourish in the closing minutes,
but it wasn't enough, as they
went down in defeat to the fresh
men, 69-62.
Crawford led the evening's scor
ing with 17, while Carter had 13
and Joujon-Roche 9. For the frosh
Whelan topped with 16, Bub Bow
ling knocked in 15, Tom Nord
land did his best yet with 14 and
Gary Estabrook sank 10.
A Different. Club
Saturday night the frosh looked
like a different ball club. Nothing
worked. Partially hampered by
the Oaks' cracker-box gym. no one
could drop in their shots, ball
handling was poor and the Pa
pooses seemed to lack their usual
"drive."
Stanford scored first and held
th.* lead five minutes into the half.
Then they lost their lead, never to
regain it the entire evening. Bow
ling's passing wasn't up to par,
and Estabrook couldn't connect
on his long shots. Menlo's Jim
Wood and Dick West lake kept
sinking their shots from under
the basket and past Stanford's
Whelan. Half-time score was 31-
22, Menlo.
