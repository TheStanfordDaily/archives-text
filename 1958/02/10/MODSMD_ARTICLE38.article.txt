# Modernized Magic Pays for an Education

The gentleman who has suc
cessfully launched "Sputniks" for
the past 10 years is Dick Zimmer
man, a junior civil engineering
major from Santa Barbara who
has found that orbiting a satellite
or working his way through Stan
ford is made somewhat simpler
With a little magic.
And as for his engineering, he
says, "Magic has probably done
a good deal more for C.E. than
C.E. has ever done for magic!"
Starting out with a little Gil
bert magic set when he was three
years old, Zimmerman started
taking magic seriously when he
was 14. "There is a right way
and a wrong way to do magic,"
he says, so "I started taking les
sons from one of the outstanding
magicians on the Pacific coast,
Senor Maldo."
Won Zamlock Award
"Senor Maldo taught me the
fine points of presentation, not
actual tricks," Zimmerman con
tinues. "and it was probably his
training which enabled me to re
ceive the first Zamloch Award
three years ago at the Pacific
Coast Association of Magicians
and Society of American Magi
cians Conference."
Zamloch was one of the great
magicians at the turn of the eon
tury, and his son Carl established
this trophy for the first time the
year Zimmerman won it.
Zimmerman has since been a
judge to help select winners of
the award, who must be under 21.
Modernizes Magic
Two years ago he attended the
Magicians Conference in Seattle,
winning the trophy of originality
for the entire convention of 300
or more professional or "just for
pleasure" magicians. "Voodoo
Rings" dancing along a rope
caught the convention's fancy.
Since then, Zimmerman has
been thinking along more origi
nal lines, declining to use the
elaborate props which character
ized magicians of 100 years ago.
"Everything else changes with
the times, and magic should too,"
he grins. "I'm trying to bring
magic up to date."

Zimmerman stresses that mag
ic has much more potential than
most people think. As Senor
Maldo told him, magic is an ex
cellent stepping stone to other
things.
Besides being good simple en
tertainmentâ€”anil to entertain is
the primary aim of every magi
cian, Zimmerman says magic
has psychological, sociological
and educational values. Magic
has been successfully employed
for demonstration purposes
among adults as well as children.
"Children are entertained, of
course, while the visual benefits
of the demonstration promote
comprehension," suggests Zim
merman. The same is true in ad
vertising on an adult level.
One of Zimmerman's good
friends is a famous magician,
Rob Haskell, who has retired
from the professional field, and
who now uses his magic back-

I ground to handle advertising for
! Pacific Gas and Electric.
Zimmerman often asks him
self, "Am I doing magic to work
my way through college, or am I
going to college to do magic?"
He has put on shows for various
fraternities and eating clubs on
cnmpus, and for different organi
zations in the Bay Area, finding
college audiences very good ones.
For his own relaxation, for
"magic is hard work, really,"
Zimmerman plays piano ragtime.
He doesn't play for money, but
"to amuse myself and anyone
else who wants to listen," he says
with a smile.
Those who have enjoyed some
of Dick Zimmerman's wizardry
and performed some magic them
selves, with his help, readily ac
knowledge that there is a new,
subtle interpretation of an old
timer in the entertainment field.
