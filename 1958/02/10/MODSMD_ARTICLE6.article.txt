# TUNISIA
## Attack May Cause Split With West 
### 
TUNIS (VP) - Angry Tunisians
ye s t e rd a y called the French
bombing of its frontier an act of
war. An authoritative newspaper
hinted at a break with the West.
President Hab ib Bourguiba,
considered a good friend of the
United States, demanded the
French pull the last troops out
of Tunisia and give up the vital
NATO naval base at Bi/.crte.
Tunisian officials said the
hour - long bombing Saturday
killed 78 persons and wounded 84
in the town of Sakiet Sidi Yous
sef, near the Algerian frontier.
25 Planes
A Swedish Red Cross official
who watched from the town's
outskirts as the 25 French war
planes attacked called it a "hor
rible sight."
The French said the attack was
a local military incident aimed at
wiping out a nest of Algerian reb
els&varassing French troops and
planes from a Tunisian sanctu
ary. They insisted they had sent
a warning in advance of the at
tack.
A spokesman for French com
manders in neighboring Algeria
told reporters in Algiers that
French troops will pursue Alge
rian rebel bands into Tunisia if
necessary to destroy them.
Dulles Comments
In Washington, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles called
in Ambassador Herve Alphand to
express the United States' con
cern about the situation.
The State Department said the
United States government "is
profoundly disturbed" by reports
received.
In Cairo the Secretary-General
of the Arab League said he cabled
United Nations Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold asking him
to interfere in what he called
"French aggressive acts," al
though Tunisia is not an Arab
League member.
Bourguiba, in a statement is
sued Saturday, said that "after
this raid it appears very difficult
that any sort of co-operation can
still exist between France and
Tunisia."
Recall Ambassador
The Tunisian government or
dered the recall of its ambassa
dor to Paris and demanded the
withdrawal of the 25,000 French
troops still based in the country.
In the meantime, it forbade all
circulation of French troops with
out Tunisian permission.
The bombing was the most se
rious clash yet between France
and its former protectorate and
it climaxed a rising tide of border
violence generated by the Alge
rian war and French charges that
Tunisia is aiding and abetting the
rebels.
In the same border area, a rebel
band killed 15 French soldiers
and kidnaped four others last
night in an ambush. The French
charged that the kidnaped men
were dragged into Tunisia.

hinted at a break with the West.
President Hab ib Bourguiba,
considered a good friend of the
United States, demanded the
French pull the last troops out
of Tunisia and give up the vital
NATO naval base at Bi/.crte.
Tunisian officials said the
hour - long bombing Saturday
killed 78 persons and wounded 84
in the town of Sakiet Sidi Yous
sef, near the Algerian frontier.
25 Planes
A Swedish Red Cross official
who watched from the town's
outskirts as the 25 French war
planes attacked called it a "hor
rible sight."
The French said the attack was
a local military incident aimed at
wiping out a nest of Algerian reb
els&varassing French troops and
planes from a Tunisian sanctu
ary. They insisted they had sent
a warning in advance of the at
tack.
A spokesman for French com
manders in neighboring Algeria
told reporters in Algiers that
French troops will pursue Alge
rian rebel bands into Tunisia if
necessary to destroy them.
Dulles Comments
In Washington, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles called
in Ambassador Herve Alphand to
express the United States' con
cern about the situation.
The State Department said the
United States government "is
profoundly disturbed" by reports
received.
In Cairo the Secretary-General
of the Arab League said he cabled
United Nations Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold asking him
to interfere in what he called
"French aggressive acts," al
though Tunisia is not an Arab
League member.
Bourguiba, in a statement is
sued Saturday, said that "after
this raid it appears very difficult
that any sort of co-operation can
still exist between France and
Tunisia."
Recall Ambassador
The Tunisian government or
dered the recall of its ambassa
dor to Paris and demanded the
withdrawal of the 25,000 French
troops still based in the country.
In the meantime, it forbade all
circulation of French troops with
out Tunisian permission.
The bombing was the most se
rious clash yet between France
and its former protectorate and
it climaxed a rising tide of border
violence generated by the Alge
rian war and French charges that
Tunisia is aiding and abetting the
rebels.
In the same border area, a rebel
band killed 15 French soldiers
and kidnaped four others last
night in an ambush. The French
charged that the kidnaped men
were dragged into Tunisia.
