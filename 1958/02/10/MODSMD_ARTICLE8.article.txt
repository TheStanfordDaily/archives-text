All houses will hold reception parties from 7:1.1 to 9:1,1 p.m.
Freshman men and the fraternities have both been divided into

four groups, with one section of
rushees assigned (o each group
of houses. Rushees will have two
hours to visit six fraternities.
The groups of freshmen will
wear different color name tags
and will not he allowed to visit
houses other than those to which
lhey are assigned. Fraternities
are not permitted to offer pins or
dive invitations to closed rushing
parties tonight.

Three to Come
The next introductory open
house will be a week from tomor
row night, Tuesday, Feb. 18. At
that time the groups will be
switched so that freshmen will
be able to visit other houses. The
third and fourth nights will be
Thursday, Feb. 27, and Thursday,
March 6.
This is the first year for the
introductory open houses. Last
year, Dean of Men William G.
Craig announced that formal
rush week would be moved back
to spring quarter. The four win
ter parties were instituted to cor
rect one of the major faults of
past rushing procedure â€” fresh
men could not get around to
enough houses in the time avail
able during formal rush week to
make an adequate comparison of
the fraternities.
To See More
The rotation system was adopt
ed to give each freshman the op
portunity to see every fraternity
on campus before the pressure of
rush week begins. Two hours is
allotted for the inspection of six
houses, or roughly 20 minutes
apiece, if a rushee wishes to go
to all the fraternities in his
group.
The revision of the no-contact
rule this year allows affiliated
men and rushees to talk over
questions of mutual interest at
any time on Quad.
