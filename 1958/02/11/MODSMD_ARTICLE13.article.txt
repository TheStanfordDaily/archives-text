# Iraq, Jordan Federation Predicted in Near Future
## Saudi Arabian Monarchy May Join New Merger 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (A 3 ) —The Hashemite Arab kingdoms of Iraq and
Jordan seemod headed last night for federation in a move which
would take the Iraqi regime out of the Western-oriented Baghdad
Pact.
Official sources in Amman, predicting this, indicated a strong pos-

sibility that a federation of the
two kingdoms might be joined by
the Saudi Arabian monarchy.
This would create in the turbu
lent Middle East a situation in
which two separate and possibly
rival Arab federations would face
one another.
The prediction came in the
midst of strong Egyptian-Syrian
propaganda for a general Arab
federation under the leadership
of Egypt, now joined with Syria
in the United Arab Republic.
Beginning of End
Eederation with Iraq likely
foreshadows the beginning of the
end of Jordan's existence as a na
tional entity.
In federation with Iraq it
would he dominated by Baghdad.
Such federation, too, would be
counter to Egyptian-Syrian ambi
tions for the future of Jordan,
which Damascus and Cairo view
as a historical part of Syria.
Faisal, accompanied by a reti
nue of high Iraqi government of
ficials, is due today in Amman to
parley with Hussein on the fu
ture of the two Hashemite coun
tries in the light of the Egyptian-
Syrian union, which has pro
duced strong pressures against
the two regimes demanding an
outward show of all-Arab unity.
Present Reconeiliation
Official Jordanian soruces sug
gested the possibility that King
Saud of Saudi Arabia would join
in the new federation later on.
Saud's family once considered it
self the blood enemy of the Hash
emites, whom the late Ibn Saud
drove out of the Hejaz in the
Arabian Peninsula. But the exi
gencies of the Arab East's turbu
lent politics in the past two years
have produced a sort of recon
ciliation between the two fami
lies, which eventually saw King
Saud supporting Hussein against
Egyptian-Syrian pressures.
Iraq, said the informants, may
take certain necessary steps to
permit the entry of Saudi Arabia
into a new Arab East Federation.
The sources declined to elaborate
on just what these steps might
be, but they said they "would not
be astonished" to see Iraq with
draw from the Baghdad Pact.

AMMAN, Jordan (A 3 ) —The Hashemite Arab kingdoms of Iraq and
Jordan seemod headed last night for federation in a move which
would take the Iraqi regime out of the Western-oriented Baghdad
Pact.
Official sources in Amman, predicting this, indicated a strong pos-

sibility that a federation of the
two kingdoms might be joined by
the Saudi Arabian monarchy.
This would create in the turbu
lent Middle East a situation in
which two separate and possibly
rival Arab federations would face
one another.
The prediction came in the
midst of strong Egyptian-Syrian
propaganda for a general Arab
federation under the leadership
of Egypt, now joined with Syria
in the United Arab Republic.
Beginning of End
Eederation with Iraq likely
foreshadows the beginning of the
end of Jordan's existence as a na
tional entity.
In federation with Iraq it
would he dominated by Baghdad.
Such federation, too, would be
counter to Egyptian-Syrian ambi
tions for the future of Jordan,
which Damascus and Cairo view
as a historical part of Syria.
Faisal, accompanied by a reti
nue of high Iraqi government of
ficials, is due today in Amman to
parley with Hussein on the fu
ture of the two Hashemite coun
tries in the light of the Egyptian-
Syrian union, which has pro
duced strong pressures against
the two regimes demanding an
outward show of all-Arab unity.
Present Reconeiliation
Official Jordanian soruces sug
gested the possibility that King
Saud of Saudi Arabia would join
in the new federation later on.
Saud's family once considered it
self the blood enemy of the Hash
emites, whom the late Ibn Saud
drove out of the Hejaz in the
Arabian Peninsula. But the exi
gencies of the Arab East's turbu
lent politics in the past two years
have produced a sort of recon
ciliation between the two fami
lies, which eventually saw King
Saud supporting Hussein against
Egyptian-Syrian pressures.
Iraq, said the informants, may
take certain necessary steps to
permit the entry of Saudi Arabia
into a new Arab East Federation.
The sources declined to elaborate
on just what these steps might
be, but they said they "would not
be astonished" to see Iraq with
draw from the Baghdad Pact.
