# $250,000 for 'Clean Shirt'
## 
### 
The Southland might not like it,
but Stanford is due to get a
$250,000 bequest from a man who
was glad to see the Indians come
out of the "PCC mess with a clean
shirt."
Davis S. Jacobsen, University
general secretary, has revealed
the terms of the will of an anony
mous southern Californian in an
article for the Stanford Review.
Unless terms of the will are
changed by the donor, Stanford
will be able to use the money for
any purpose it pleases, including
furthering of athletics.
Although the donor will not re
veal his name, it is known that he
is not a Stanford alumnus. He
wrote to Stanford inquiring about
bequests and made the provision
in his will after being contacted
by a University representative.
Jacobsen said that when ho
asked the man why he was leav
ing Stanford the money, he re
plied. "1 have long planned to help
some college; 1 have been a foot
ball fan, and the factor that tipped
Iho scales for Stanford was that
the school came out of the PCC
mess with a clean shirt."
