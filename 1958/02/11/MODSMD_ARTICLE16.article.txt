# Expert Says Arab Unity Anti-USSR
##

The point and purpose of the
Egyptian • Syrian unity was "to
keep Syria out from under undue
influence by the USSR," Mrs.
Mrs. Christina Phelps Harris
said last night in a telephone in
terview with The Daily.
When asked to comment on the
proposed merger between Iraq
and Jordan, the Hoover Institute
expert on the Middle East said
there is certainly quite a way to
go before the merger becomes
fact. "Arab unity has been the
desire of the peoples of all the
Arab states since the 19th een
rtury, and the desire has increased
since the Second World War."
The merger is being proposed
by governments of the two king
doms, the kings of of which are
second cousins. But, she said,
there is no certainty that the peo
ple will go for the merger if it is
a unity contrived by govern
ments alone and if Jordan is
thereby dragged into joining the
Baghdad Pact.
< lose Relationship
According to Mrs. Harris, the
people of Jordan, especially, de
sire a closer relationship with the
people of Egypt and Syria, and
King Hussein's position since
1956 has been rather shaky.
Elaborating further on the
Egyptian - Syrian merger, Mrs.
Harris said the very fact that
Moscow has given neither nation
a pat-on-the-back for merging is
very significant in that this
shows that the merger was ac
tually an attempt—and a rather
successful one—to weaken the in
fluence of Russia in both coun
tries.
A communication from Cairo
has said that the Communist
parties in the Middle East gen
erally have been instructed to
oppose the Egypt-Syria merger.
Parties Dissolved
Mrs. Harris said that the leader
of the Communists in Syria, Kha
lid Bagdash, and his family are
reported to have gone to Russia
and that Syria has dissolved all
political parties at the insistence
of Nasser prior to the forthcom
ing elections for a single parlia
ment for both countries.
Lebanon, she feels, might very
well join Syria and Egypt in their
union. The Lebanese and Syrians
have close ties. Lebanon has al
ways been the most friendly of
the Arab sates to the West.
Unity with Syria and Egypt, Leb
anon might feel, would be of ben
efit to the West. However, Mrs.
Harris believes that Lebanon's in
ternationally respected states
man, Dr. Charles Malik, will try
to keep Lebanon'from this union
if he thinks Western public opin
ion is too strongly against such
a move.
