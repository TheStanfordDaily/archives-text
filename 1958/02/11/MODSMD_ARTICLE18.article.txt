# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## The
						Talking War 
### Walter Lippmann 
The exchange of letters and speeches which is
now going on between Moscow and the Western
capitals is showing, as one studies it closely, that
ihere is a military and political stalemate not
likely to be broken soon or easily.
In the Soviet statements there is nothing, so far
as I can see, to suggest that they think they have,
or are on the way to having, decisive military
superiority. There is much to support the view
of Mr. Alien \V. Dulles that "they recognize that
nuclear war at. this time would result in devas
tating damage to them."
No doubt the Soviet utterances are mostly
propaganda. But it is pacifist propaganda, and
thiit is not the kind which a government, intend
ing to make war, would dare to use among its
own people. The Soviet talk about peace is meant,
of course, to soften up the West. But, unlike
Hitler's propaganda, for example, it is not de
signed to toughen up the people at home. Quite
the contrary. It is the kind of propaganda that
must soften them up too.
The over-all effect of the talking war is to sup
port the conclusion that there is a stalemate aris
ing from a balance of terror.
Enmeshed in the military stalemate Ihere is a
political stalemate. It is at once accurate and
significant, I believe, to say that each side wants
the other side to go home; that each side wants
disengagement by the other side without dis
engagement for itself. Fundamentally, what the
West wants is that the Russians and their Chi
nese allies should go home and renounce their
present spheres of influence. What Moscow wants
is that the Americans should go home, renounc
ing their sphere of influence from Japan and
Okinawa to the frontier of West Germany.
There is a stalemate because there is not in
sight any willingness on the momentous issue of
disengagement to give as well as to take. That
is why in the existing situation there is no pros
pect of a negotiated settlement at the summit or
anywhere else. The situation is likely to last
until, in the course of time, it is eroded by events.

In this stalemate the Western position is that
our objectives are the reunification of Germany
and the liberation of eastern Europe; these ob
jectives are to be achieved by the withdrawal of
the Red forces to the Soviet Union, while the

NATO forces remain where they are. No serious
person can believe that this is a negolialing posi
tion. It is, in fact, a policy of stalemate in a
divided anil occupied Europe.
The Soviet position is the same as ours —only
in reverse. They want us to evacuate our armies
and dismantle our foreign bases throughout the
world, while they retain their dominance iu east
ern Germany and eastern Europe. This, obviously
enough, is also a policy of stalemate and not in
any sense a policy of negotiation.
The question, then, is why each side has a
policy that is not negotiable. The answer is that
both sifies prefer the existing stalemate to the
alternative, which would l>e mutual disengage
ment.
A reading of Khrushchev's recent speeech al
Minsk, and of many passages in the Kulganip.
letters, makes it plain that Moscow is very anx
ious indeed about the satellite empire and pro
foundly concerned to keep a grip on it. The satel
lite empire might very well blow up if the Red
army were withdrawn.
On our side of the Iron Curtain there is a cor
responding anxiety that if the Continent were
evacuated by the Russians and by ourselves, the
NATO alliance would soon disintegrate. For that
reason the official view is: better the Red army
on the Elbe than the American army out of
Europe.
There is, on both sides, the unspoken belief
that the threat and pressure of the other side are
necessary to the morale of its own side.
In 1 his stalemate both alliances are captives,
unable to negotiate on the main issue of dis
engagement. IIow long is the stalemate likely to
endure? The question cannot be answered con
cretely and definitely. But we can suppose, I
believe, that the stalemate will last until it is
broken either by a decisive turn in German in
terior politics or by a great upheaval in eastern
Europe or, what is not improbable, by the two
occurring together.
What is sure and clear is that neither Mr.
Krushchev in Moscow nor Secretary Dulles in
Washington is likely to be able to break the stale
mate.
