The True Picture
Editor, The Daily:
Your article [editorial] "Vengeance in Tunisia"
war, a very interesting one. It gives really the
true, exact picture of North Africa and how they
suffered and still are.
A very good comment.

Jungle of Primeval Passion
Editor, The Daily:
I would explain to you the secret of an excitinp,
lusty and adventurous life such as is rarely
visited upon the pale-faced, bookish youth of
today.
We have but to yield to the flatteries of our
urgent analysts. What transports! . . . What de

light each morning to strip off one's randy-striped
PJ's ami beneath that white expanse of chest, or
in-expanse (every thesis should contain a new
word), feel the exotic promptings of a raging
.jungle of primeval passion, colossal destruction
and serpent-like desire for our eashmered women!
. . . How long shall this sweatshirt and washpant
civilisation contain us? . . . Quo usque tandem
abutere patientia nostra? ... Ah, ravening wolves
and foul beasts destroy me. yet freely I commit
myself to the yea-saying of a scavenger's break
fast of orange juice and Wheaties . . . and, going
out happily to slaughter my friends and loved
ones, sing to the naked night (i.e., day), im
ploring
Freud and Jung help me play and
Teach others to live this way . . .
