# Bridge

### Don Krauss 
Down in Texas, bridge is a
real bidder's game. Practically
the only excuse a Texan needs to
make a bid is 13 cards. So if a
Texan is dealt a lew high cards
or a hand with a long suit, just
try and get the bid! And if a
Texan has a two-suit hand, it's
just a question of which of his
suits he'll play the hand in!
When this hand was played, I
was North and my partner was a
not too timid lady from Texas.
When sshe bid \ hearts, T fell a
little ill, and the thunderous
double by West didn't make me
feel any better. I suppose I
should have had more confidence
in my partner, but she has a
habit of making winning bids
against me and losing l<ids as my
partner.
Dealer West; neither side vul
nerable.

The bidding:
West North S.iist South
I NT. Pass 3 N.T. I V
Double Pass Pass Pass
Actually her hid on this hand
was very sound, and I'm not just
playing results She knew by tin*
opponents' bidding thai they bad
between 2b and .'io high card

points, at least 2G because Ihey
had contracted for game and at
most 30 because they made no
Iry at bidding a slam. Therefore
she knew her partner had l>e
tween 5 and 9 points.
If her partner had ihese points
in the right places, namely in
diamonds and hearts, she should
make 4 hearts. For example, give
her partner just 7 points, the
king of hearts and the king-jack
of diamonds, and <1 hearts is a
cinch.
The opening lead of the king of
diamonds gave her the contract.
The ace won in dummy, and a
â–  trump was led, declarer paying
the It) and the king winning. The
diamond jack was led, and the
queen won. The jack of hearts
lost 1o the ace. A club was led,
she trumped it, drew Ihe last
trump with the heart queen,
played out her diamonds and con
ceded a spade at the end. Four
hearts doubled, making four!
It's true that without a dia
mond lead by West, she can't
make the contract. But the oppo
nents have nine sure tricks in 3
No Trump, and she would be
down one doubled, for a very
good sacrifice.
I'm not advocating wild dives
into games with only . r > points
but don't just woodeuly count
points, and make your bid. Use
sume imagination, and be opti
mistic! Visuali/e certain cards in
your partner's hand that will en
able you to make your bid. You'll
be wrong sometimes! But if you
are never set, you're not bidding
enouj'h. Winning bridge players
are bidders.
