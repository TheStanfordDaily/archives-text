# Junior Mathematics Major Performs Carillon Music Atop Hoover Tower
## 
### Jack Clumeck 
As the carillon atop Hoover
Tower peels out its songs, the
story of its past, present and fu
ture is unfolded daily before the
campus.
Its music is handled by one par
ticular person, the University
carillonneur, John Mullen.
Mullen, a Stern Hall junior
from San Francisco and a mathe
matics major, began his interest
in the carillon as a freshman. A
musically inclined person, he had
previously played the organ and
the piano.
He was advised to correspond
with James R. Lawson, former
Stanford carillonneur and now
carillonneur at the Rockefeller
Memorial Chapel of the Univer
sity of Chicago.
Lawson, as a gift to the Univer
sity, offered Mullen a period of
instruction on the Chicago caril
Jon if he could somehow get to
Illinois. A fin a 11 c i ;i I hurdle
blocked the way at this juncture,
but then fate stepped in and took
;i hand in the proceedings.

KCBS presented a contest, spon
sored by America n Airlines,
which had as its prize a round
trip flight and a week's stay at
iIn 1 Sheraton Blackstone Hotel in
Chicago.
The challenge was to write, in
one hundred words or less, ' Why
1 want to go to Chicago" as the
guest of the airline. Mullen wrote
that he wanted to go to learn to
play the IxMls, and fortunately
was declared the winner.
In the summer of 1956, Mullen
spent six weeks of study under
Lawson.
Mullen explained the manual
operation of the three - octave
Stanford carillon as striking with
a clenched hand "broomsticks,"
arranged in order as a piano key
board. The Hoover Institution
bells are played manually every
Sunday at 10:45 a.m. in conjunc

i tion with services at Memorial
1 Church, at 12:15 p.m. on Sundays
| in concert, and in special concerts
on holidays.
The carillon is played automati
cally, at noon and i> p.m. daily,
| by machinery, "like a giant-size
! music bo.\," as described by Mill
; ion. Pegs, to activate the bell
j ringing mechanism, are strategi
[ caliy placed on a drum, so large
that "a person can climb inside."
Then hammers hit the outside of
1 the bells, as contrasted to manual
! playing, in which clappers hit the
: inside of the bells.
The inscription on ihe largest
bell of the Stanford carillon is as
I applicable today and for the fu
ture as it was when the bell was
cast in Belgium: "Fro pace sono,"
"I ring for peace."

As the carillon atop Hoover
Tower peels out its songs, the
story of its past, present and fu
ture is unfolded daily before the
campus.
Its music is handled by one par
ticular person, the University
carillonneur, John Mullen.
Mullen, a Stern Hall junior
from San Francisco and a mathe
matics major, began his interest
in the carillon as a freshman. A
musically inclined person, he had
previously played the organ and
the piano.
He was advised to correspond
with James R. Lawson, former
Stanford carillonneur and now
carillonneur at the Rockefeller
Memorial Chapel of the Univer
sity of Chicago.
Lawson, as a gift to the Univer
sity, offered Mullen a period of
instruction on the Chicago caril
Jon if he could somehow get to
Illinois. A fin a 11 c i ;i I hurdle
blocked the way at this juncture,
but then fate stepped in and took

KCBS presented a contest, spon
sored by America n Airlines,
which had as its prize a round
trip flight and a week's stay at
iIn 1 Sheraton Blackstone Hotel in
Chicago.
The challenge was to write, in
one hundred words or less, ' Why
1 want to go to Chicago" as the
guest of the airline. Mullen wrote
that he wanted to go to learn to
play the IxMls, and fortunately
was declared the winner.
In the summer of 1956, Mullen
spent six weeks of study under
Lawson.
Mullen explained the manual
operation of the three - octave
Stanford carillon as striking with
a clenched hand "broomsticks,"
arranged in order as a piano key
