# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
A (Coincidence, of (Course
When a college recruits an athlete, it naturally wants to he sure
he'll he able to last through four years of the tough study grind. For
this reason, it's not uncommon to find a school sending one of its
proteges to prep school or junior college so that he can bring up his
grades and stand a better chance of remaining until he graduates.
Fortunately, this trend hasn't yel reached the point where a college
spots a hot prospect and then moves him to a high school in its area
in order to keep a watchful eye on him or has it?
It seems that there's a prep basketball phenom who's been All-
City in Los Angeles for four years, plus a few All-Oilier Things the
past two seasons. Name of this 6-11 V-> star from .Jefferson High is
Kill (The Hill) McGIII.
Because of the large number of mid year graduates in L.A., the
high school cage season runs from November until January; thus,
it's all over for this year. So now what happens, but McGill turns
up at Polytechnic High in San Francisco ready and rarin' to get in
Ihe city playoffs if Academic Athletic Association officials will let
him.
Accompanying Mcdll's flight to the North is the report that he'll
go to California next year, or possibly spend a year at CCSF before
lit' moves across the Bay. And to add to this, word has come from a
Cul student (admitatedly, the rumor possibilities are great) that by
some stroke of good fortune, McGiH's mother and father both just
happened to secure new jobs in Ihe Kay area in order thai Kill could
move up here during the semester break.
Naturally, I here's an excellent possibility thai all these coinciding
developments happened by mere chance. Bui then, too, maybe there
was Just a shade of a helping hand from ivte Newell and company.
tt tt tt
When the average college fan thinks of his learn traveling to a
distant locale for a game, he envisions plush hotel accommodations,
the finest in food, and motorcycle escorts all over town. Doubtless
this impression comes from football, where it is true that top-flight
teams do enjoy good, though brief, irips. Hut what happens in other
spoils, particularly Ihe so-called minor ones?
A good example was furnished over the weekend, when UCLA
came to Stanford to meet the Indian ruggers. The Hrnins didn't stay
at Rickey's; they weren't at the President or even at a motel. No,
they split up into twos and threes and stayed at various Stanford
fraternity houses. It was a unique arrangement, all right, but at
least il shows that there's a shade of amateurism left in college
spoils.
One more tiling we didn't hear of any brawls between the ath
letes of two schools which are supposed to be so far from funda
mental agreement as to the place of sports in a university. Could
be thai Ihe players get along better than the policy makers.
Douglas Aims for the Top
Tt isn't very often that a pro tennis player meets an amateur in
an exhibition; and of course Ihe pros and amateurs don't get to
gether at all in tournaments. So, tlie tune-up meeting between .lack
Douglas and Lew Ifoad here Friday furnished some interesting food
for thought.
The last big-name battle between the two divisions was about
four years ago when Pancho Segura, representing the play-for-pay
boys, trounced Ken Kosewall, (5-1, <5-0. Rosewall was on his way up
then, and went on to become the world's top amateur before he, too,
decided to play for cash.
Friday, Hoad didn't score any such clean sweep, as he led Doug
las <5-2, 6*B, 4-4, before darkness halted further play. Granted, Hoad
wasn't going all out—he naturally wouldn't in a warm-up match.
Still, for Douglas to stay that close to him and get in as many good
shots as he did indicates that the Stanford senior is well on his way
to the top of the tennis ladder.
Now that he doesn't have to worry about football, Douglas can
work on strengthening his serve and the other phases of his game
so as to be ready by the time the NCAA meet rolls around in June.
At any rate, the outlook is encouraging for the man who beat
every one of the PCC's top players in 1957.
tt tt tt
CONGRATULATIONS to Dutch Fehring and the S.F. Giants for
their successful baseball clinic Saturday. Rain forced the outdoor
phase of the program into Cubberley, but it didn't keep more than
500 high school coaches from filling the place.

ANNE (Jl AST UNABLE TO TOUR
Smiling Anne Quast, darling of every gallery, is missing from
Florida tourneys Ibis year because of study at the University of
Washington.
This strikes a note of incongruity, because Anne was taking a
Stanford Poli Sci 1 mid-term just four days ago. Oh, well, at least
Stanford and Washington are in the same conference (or are they?).

distant locale for a game, he envisions plush hotel accommodations,
the finest in food, and motorcycle escorts all over town. Doubtless
this impression comes from football, where it is true that top-flight
teams do enjoy good, though brief, irips. Hut what happens in other
spoils, particularly Ihe so-called minor ones?
A good example was furnished over the weekend, when UCLA
came to Stanford to meet the Indian ruggers. The Hrnins didn't stay
at Rickey's; they weren't at the President or even at a motel. No,
they split up into twos and threes and stayed at various Stanford
fraternity houses. It was a unique arrangement, all right, but at
least il shows that there's a shade of amateurism left in college
spoils.
One more tiling we didn't hear of any brawls between the ath
letes of two schools which are supposed to be so far from funda
mental agreement as to the place of sports in a university. Could
be thai Ihe players get along better than the policy makers.
Douglas Aims for the Top
Tt isn't very often that a pro tennis player meets an amateur in
an exhibition; and of course Ihe pros and amateurs don't get to
gether at all in tournaments. So, tlie tune-up meeting between .lack
Douglas and Lew Ifoad here Friday furnished some interesting food
for thought.
The last big-name battle between the two divisions was about
four years ago when Pancho Segura, representing the play-for-pay
boys, trounced Ken Kosewall, (5-1, <5-0. Rosewall was on his way up
then, and went on to become the world's top amateur before he, too,
decided to play for cash.
Friday, Hoad didn't score any such clean sweep, as he led Doug
las <5-2, 6*B, 4-4, before darkness halted further play. Granted, Hoad
wasn't going all out—he naturally wouldn't in a warm-up match.
Still, for Douglas to stay that close to him and get in as many good
shots as he did indicates that the Stanford senior is well on his way
to the top of the tennis ladder.
Now that he doesn't have to worry about football, Douglas can
work on strengthening his serve and the other phases of his game
so as to be ready by the time the NCAA meet rolls around in June.
At any rate, the outlook is encouraging for the man who beat
every one of the PCC's top players in 1957.
tt tt tt
CONGRATULATIONS to Dutch Fehring and the S.F. Giants for
their successful baseball clinic Saturday. Rain forced the outdoor
phase of the program into Cubberley, but it didn't keep more than
500 high school coaches from filling the place.

ANNE (Jl AST UNABLE TO TOUR
Smiling Anne Quast, darling of every gallery, is missing from
Florida tourneys Ibis year because of study at the University of
Washington.
This strikes a note of incongruity, because Anne was taking a
Stanford Poli Sci 1 mid-term just four days ago. Oh, well, at least
Stanford and Washington are in the same conference (or are they?).

A (Coincidence, of (Course
When a college recruits an athlete, it naturally wants to he sure
he'll he able to last through four years of the tough study grind. For
this reason, it's not uncommon to find a school sending one of its
proteges to prep school or junior college so that he can bring up his
grades and stand a better chance of remaining until he graduates.
Fortunately, this trend hasn't yel reached the point where a college
spots a hot prospect and then moves him to a high school in its area
in order to keep a watchful eye on him or has it?
It seems that there's a prep basketball phenom who's been All-
City in Los Angeles for four years, plus a few All-Oilier Things the
past two seasons. Name of this 6-11 V-> star from .Jefferson High is
Kill (The Hill) McGIII.
Because of the large number of mid year graduates in L.A., the
high school cage season runs from November until January; thus,
it's all over for this year. So now what happens, but McGill turns
up at Polytechnic High in San Francisco ready and rarin' to get in
Ihe city playoffs if Academic Athletic Association officials will let
him.
Accompanying Mcdll's flight to the North is the report that he'll
go to California next year, or possibly spend a year at CCSF before
lit' moves across the Bay. And to add to this, word has come from a
Cul student (admitatedly, the rumor possibilities are great) that by
some stroke of good fortune, McGiH's mother and father both just
happened to secure new jobs in Ihe Kay area in order thai Kill could
move up here during the semester break.
Naturally, I here's an excellent possibility thai all these coinciding
developments happened by mere chance. Bui then, too, maybe there
was Just a shade of a helping hand from ivte Newell and company.

Still, for Douglas to stay that close to him and get in as many good
shots as he did indicates that the Stanford senior is well on his way
to the top of the tennis ladder.
Now that he doesn't have to worry about football, Douglas can
work on strengthening his serve and the other phases of his game
so as to be ready by the time the NCAA meet rolls around in June.
At any rate, the outlook is encouraging for the man who beat
every one of the PCC's top players in 1957.

CONGRATULATIONS to Dutch Fehring and the S.F. Giants for

phase of the program into Cubberley, but it didn't keep more than
500 high school coaches from filling the place.

a weekly golf newsmagazine:
ANNE (Jl AST UNABLE TO TOUR
Smiling Anne Quast, darling of every gallery, is missing from
Florida tourneys Ibis year because of study at the University of
Washington.
This strikes a note of incongruity, because Anne was taking a
Stanford Poli Sci 1 mid-term just four days ago. Oh, well, at least
Stanford and Washington are in the same conference (or are they?).

A (Coincidence, of (Course
When a college recruits an athlete, it naturally wants to he sure
he'll he able to last through four years of the tough study grind. For
this reason, it's not uncommon to find a school sending one of its
proteges to prep school or junior college so that he can bring up his
grades and stand a better chance of remaining until he graduates.
Fortunately, this trend hasn't yel reached the point where a college
spots a hot prospect and then moves him to a high school in its area
in order to keep a watchful eye on him or has it?
It seems that there's a prep basketball phenom who's been All-
City in Los Angeles for four years, plus a few All-Oilier Things the
past two seasons. Name of this 6-11 V-> star from .Jefferson High is
Kill (The Hill) McGIII.
Because of the large number of mid year graduates in L.A., the
high school cage season runs from November until January; thus,
it's all over for this year. So now what happens, but McGill turns
up at Polytechnic High in San Francisco ready and rarin' to get in
Ihe city playoffs if Academic Athletic Association officials will let
him.
Accompanying Mcdll's flight to the North is the report that he'll
go to California next year, or possibly spend a year at CCSF before
lit' moves across the Bay. And to add to this, word has come from a
Cul student (admitatedly, the rumor possibilities are great) that by
some stroke of good fortune, McGiH's mother and father both just
happened to secure new jobs in Ihe Kay area in order thai Kill could
move up here during the semester break.
Naturally, I here's an excellent possibility thai all these coinciding
developments happened by mere chance. Bui then, too, maybe there
was Just a shade of a helping hand from ivte Newell and company.

When the average college fan thinks of his learn traveling to a
distant locale for a game, he envisions plush hotel accommodations,
the finest in food, and motorcycle escorts all over town. Doubtless
this impression comes from football, where it is true that top-flight
teams do enjoy good, though brief, irips. Hut what happens in other
spoils, particularly Ihe so-called minor ones?
A good example was furnished over the weekend, when UCLA
came to Stanford to meet the Indian ruggers. The Hrnins didn't stay
at Rickey's; they weren't at the President or even at a motel. No,
they split up into twos and threes and stayed at various Stanford
fraternity houses. It was a unique arrangement, all right, but at
least il shows that there's a shade of amateurism left in college
spoils.
One more tiling we didn't hear of any brawls between the ath
letes of two schools which are supposed to be so far from funda
mental agreement as to the place of sports in a university. Could
be thai Ihe players get along better than the policy makers.
Douglas Aims for the Top
Tt isn't very often that a pro tennis player meets an amateur in
an exhibition; and of course Ihe pros and amateurs don't get to
gether at all in tournaments. So, tlie tune-up meeting between .lack
Douglas and Lew Ifoad here Friday furnished some interesting food
for thought.
The last big-name battle between the two divisions was about
four years ago when Pancho Segura, representing the play-for-pay
boys, trounced Ken Kosewall, (5-1, <5-0. Rosewall was on his way up
then, and went on to become the world's top amateur before he, too,
decided to play for cash.
Friday, Hoad didn't score any such clean sweep, as he led Doug
las <5-2, 6*B, 4-4, before darkness halted further play. Granted, Hoad
wasn't going all out—he naturally wouldn't in a warm-up match.
