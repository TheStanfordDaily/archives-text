THE PLEDGE YOU SAVE
MAY BE YOUR OWN
Today's column is directed at those young female undergradu
ates wlio have recently pledged sororities and a re worried, poor
lambs, that they won't make good. Following is a list of simple
instructions which, if faithfully observed, will positively guaran
tee that you will be a mad success as a sorority girl.
First, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The house
mother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You must treat
her with respect. When you wish to speak to her, address her as
"Mother Sigafoos" or "Ma'am." In no circumstances must you
say, "Hey, fat lady."
Second, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on the
front porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and shows
a want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.
Third, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing
meals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your cook
goes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied and
nourishing. The least you can do is show your appreciation.
Don't just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with delight,
"What delicious pork jowls!" or "What a yummy soupbone!"
or "What scrumptious fish heads!" or "What clear water!"
Fourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance reflects
not just on yourself but on the whole house. It was well enough
before you joined a sorority to lounge around campus in your
old middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now you must take
great pains to dress in a manner which excites admiring com
ments from all who observe you. A few years ago, for example,
there was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk at the Univer
sity of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her .sorors.

Camille hit- on the ingenious notion of suiting her garb to
the class slip was attending. For instance, to English Lit he
wore a buskin and jerkin. 'J o (Serman slip worp lederhosen and
carried a stein of pilsener. To I 1 ]con slip wore 120 yards of ticker
tape. Her shiningest hour came one day when she dressed as a
white mouse for I'svch Lab. Not only her Chi Omega sisters,
but. the entire student body wpnt, into deep mournirur when she
was killed by the janitor's cat.
Finally, let. us take up the most important topic of all. I
refer, of course, to dating.
As we have seen, the way you dress reflects on your --orority,
but the met) you date reflect even more. Be absolutely certain
that your date is an acceptable fellow. Don't beat about the
bush; ask him point-blank, "Are you an acceptable fellow?"
I'riless he replies, "Yeah, hey," send him packing.
Hut don't just, take his word that he is acceptable. Inspect
him closely. Are his fingernails clean? Is his black Ic.-ilhcr jacket
freshly oiled? Is his ukulele in tune? Does he carry public
liability insurance? And, most significant of all, docs he smoke
Marlboros?
If he's a Marlboro man, you know he's a lot of man. You
know he has taste and discernment, wit and wisdom, character
and sapience, decency and warmth, presence and poise, talent
and grit, filter and flavor. You will bp proud of him, your sorority
will bp proud of him, the makers of Marlboro will bp proud of
him, and I will be paid for this column. c m*. MM.si.ui.nM
