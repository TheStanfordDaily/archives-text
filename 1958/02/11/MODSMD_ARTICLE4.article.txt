garian crisis, nonetheless we can
not condone this French action
against an independent Tunisia."
Eisenhower conferred with Sec
retary of State Dulles on the ques
tion of getting a report. G. Lewis
Jones, U.S. ambassador to Tu
nisia, has been authorized to makr
an inspection of the bombed vil
lage.
"France, by such short-sighted
action, will likely not only rally

alienate public opinion around
the world."
