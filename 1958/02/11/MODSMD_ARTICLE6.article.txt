## New Civil Rights Bill Introduced 
### 
WASHINGTON (A 3 )--A biparti
san group of 16 senators intro
duced a new civil rights bill in the
Senate yesterday. It may touch
off a new North-South fight over
racial issues.
Congress struggled for months
during the last session before
passing the first civil rights legis
lation in 82 years.
The Eisenhower Administration
has said it won't sponsor new
legislation this year, but Attorney
General Rogers has indicated the
President would sign a bill re
storing provisions knocked out of
last year's measure.
The new bill, backed by 10
Northern Democrats and six
Northern Republicans, is designed
to encourage racial integration of
schools. It would compel compli
ance with Supreme Court rulings
in that field, if necessary.
Another' provision would arm
the Attorney General with author
ity to seek federal court injunc
tions for the protection of civil
rights generally. This was one of
the provisions cut out of last
year's legislation.
Senator Douglas (D-Ill.), one of
the bill's leading supporters, held
a news conference to outline the
aims of his group.
"Wc are not going to jockey for
party advantage," he said. "Wc
are going to push for enactment
of the bill."
Senator Javits (R-N.Y.), sitting
beside Douglas, said he was "here
as living evidence of the biparti
sanship." He added he feels that
the civil rights bill is needed to
improve domestic conditions and
strengthen the nation's position in
international relations.
