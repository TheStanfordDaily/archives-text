## Judicial Petitions Circulated 
### 
Two Stanford students are cir
culating petitions asking the AS
SU Legislature to amend certain
Judicial Council by-laws.
The students, Dave Davidson
and Bob Guild, are hoping to get
411 signatures, five per cent of
the student body, before Thurs
day night so they may present
their proposition to the meeting
of LASSU.
The amendments state:
A. No trial may be held unless
the accused has been presented
with the specific charges against
him, in writing and in advance.
B. The accused shall have the
right to hear and see all testi
mony and evidence against him,
U> question all witnesses against
hirn, and to have a public trial if
he desires. The accused shall
never be compelled to be a wit
ness against himself.
C. The accused shall have a
compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor and may
have assistance in his defense.
According to Guild, LASSU has
two choices if the necessary num
ber of signatures are obtained. It
may adopt the changes or call a
special election before the end of
the quarter.
Last Thursday night, LASSU
voted down amendments similar
to those on the petitions. The re
jected amendments called for
unanimity for conviction, which
is not included in the new pro
posals.
A form similar to the petitions
will appear in an advertisement
in The Daily tomorrow and
Thursday, and Guild has request
ed that all who agree with it
should tear it out and sign it.
Someone will be around the liv
ing groups to collect the forms,
he said.
