## Syria Forfeits Freedoms For Union With Egypt 
### Barbara Intra Bachman 
The union of Egypt and Syria, 1
Republic, may have come as a sur;
cent Western democracies, but act
result of two years of negotiation
well as a result of their political .

which resulted in the United Aral)
prise to many of the more compla
ually it was the long-contemplated
s between the two Arab states, as
and economic climate.
Dr. George Lenczowski, last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
speaker and an authority on the
Middle East, delivered a concise
and factual account of the Middle
East's recent history, politics and
economic conditions in light of the
current news prominence of the
Arab nations.
In the past year and a half, the
Middle East has claimed the ma
jor portion of international in
terest:
1. Egyptian-Israeli crisis.
2. Nationalization of Iranian oil.
'i. Egyptian-Syrian union.
And, a« Dr. Lenczowski describ
ed, the above events are direct re
sults of the dual revolution with
which the Arab states are pres
ently involved. Externally, the
Middle Eastern nations are des
perately seeking freedom from
foreign intervention. Internally,
they are battling with emerging
social forces which demand secu
rity, strength and autonomy.
Negotiating 2 Years
For two years Egyptians and
Syrians have been negotiating for
a union, with both countries, espe
cially Syria's masses, enthusiasti
cally supporting the proposal.
The new Arab republic has ef
fected only very small changes in
Egypt. But in Syria great transi
tions are being made. Egypt has
become used to a dictatorial gov
ernment, in the form of Nasser,
while Syria has been practicing
democratic-oriented politics.
Syria's government functioned
under elected governmental offi
cials, the leadership of well-or
ganized political parties and free
dom of the press. All of these
things, as Dr. Lcnczowski pointed
out, would seem to be very cher
ished traditions.
Give Up Democracy
But evidently the Syrians think
otherwise. They are willing to
give up these democratic institu-
I tions in order to fulfill Nasser's
j demands and unite with Egypt in
i a republic.
This union, with its Nasser-dom
; inated government, is reported to
' be of a transitional nature only.
; Reliable sources say it is expected
i to last approximately four years,
j Lcnczowski said.
Yet the question remains, he
i stressed, why the Syrians volun
tarily and fairly enthusiastically
have consented to give up their
freedoms.
The question was answered last
night in two words: Arab nation
i alism.
This is a phenomena that is
deeply rooted in the peoples of
the Middle Eastern states. It i* a
product of their cultural, religious
and political past.

current news prominence of the
Arab nations.
In the past year and a half, the
Middle East has claimed the ma
jor portion of international in
terest:
1. Egyptian-Israeli crisis.
2. Nationalization of Iranian oil.
'i. Egyptian-Syrian union.
And, a« Dr. Lenczowski describ
ed, the above events are direct re
sults of the dual revolution with
which the Arab states are pres
ently involved. Externally, the
Middle Eastern nations are des
perately seeking freedom from
foreign intervention. Internally,
they are battling with emerging
social forces which demand secu
rity, strength and autonomy.
Negotiating 2 Years
For two years Egyptians and
Syrians have been negotiating for
a union, with both countries, espe
cially Syria's masses, enthusiasti
cally supporting the proposal.
The new Arab republic has ef
fected only very small changes in
Egypt. But in Syria great transi
tions are being made. Egypt has
become used to a dictatorial gov
ernment, in the form of Nasser,
while Syria has been practicing
democratic-oriented politics.
Syria's government functioned
under elected governmental offi
cials, the leadership of well-or
ganized political parties and free
dom of the press. All of these
things, as Dr. Lcnczowski pointed
out, would seem to be very cher
ished traditions.
Give Up Democracy
But evidently the Syrians think
otherwise. They are willing to
give up these democratic institu-
I tions in order to fulfill Nasser's
j demands and unite with Egypt in
i a republic.
This union, with its Nasser-dom
; inated government, is reported to
' be of a transitional nature only.
; Reliable sources say it is expected
i to last approximately four years,
j Lcnczowski said.
Yet the question remains, he
i stressed, why the Syrians volun
tarily and fairly enthusiastically
have consented to give up their
freedoms.
The question was answered last
night in two words: Arab nation
i alism.
This is a phenomena that is
deeply rooted in the peoples of
the Middle Eastern states. It i* a
product of their cultural, religious
and political past.
The union of Egypt and Syria, 1
Republic, may have come as a sur;
cent Western democracies, but act
result of two years of negotiation
well as a result of their political .

which resulted in the United Aral)
prise to many of the more compla
ually it was the long-contemplated
s between the two Arab states, as
and economic climate.
Dr. George Lenczowski, last
