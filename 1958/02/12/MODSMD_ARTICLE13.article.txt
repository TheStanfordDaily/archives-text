# Jordan-Iraq Negotiations Prompted by Syrian Pact
## Kings Conferring to Answer New Federation's Challenge 
### 
U
AMMAN, Jordan (/I 1 ) Kings Hussein of Jordan and Faisal 11 of
Iraq went into a huddle yesterday amid indications they will an
nounce shortly federation of their countries to meet the challenge
of the new Egyptian-Syrian union.
Informed sources said plans for merger of the two Hashemite

kingdoms, both aligned with the
West, already have been largely
worked out. They said the formal
announcement may come today
or tomorrow.
The big questions seemed to be
whether King Saud of Saudi Ara
bia would join Hussein and Fai
sal, and whether Iraq would with
draw from the pro-Western Bagh
dad Pact.
Saud has refused to join unless
Iraq leaves the pact, official
sources said. Jordanian officials
are reported trying to persuade
the Iraqis to withdraw.
Iraq is the only Arab country
in the American-supported alli
ance, which includes Turkey,
Iran, Pakistan and Britain. Iraq's
withdrawal would meet the ob
jections of Arabs who contend
the Baghdad Pact has interfered
with Arab unity.
Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia
all have been Western-oriented in
contrast with Syria and Egypt,
which receive economic and mili
tary aid from the Soviet Union.
Faisal arrived by air with For
eign Minister Burhaneddin Bash
ayan, Finance Minister N'adim
Bajehji, Justice Minister Abdul
Rasoul El Khalisi, Cabinet Chief
Abdullah Baker and military ad
visers.
One official said formal talks
between the young kings, which
will begin this morning, may be
completed by ihe end of the day.
Federal union of oil-rich Iraq
and Jordan, which is dependent
upon foreign subsidies, has been
a topic of serious discussion for
years. The two governments
were considering a merger as
early as 1951, when negotiations
were disrupted by the assassina
tion of Jordan's King Abdullah.
