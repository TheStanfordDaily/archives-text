# Chou En-lai Reorganizes Government
## 
### 
HONG KONG (/P) â€” Premier
Chou En-lai of Rod China stopped
down from the office of foreign
minister and his close associate,
Vice-Premier Chen Yi, took his
place. Chou remained on as pre
mier with his high standing in
the government apparently as
firm as ever.
Peiping radio said the change
was recommended by Chou him
self as part of a shakeup in min
istries aimed at streamlining the
Communist machinery for the
start of the nations' second five
year plan.
Westerners here felt the move
frees Chou to concentrate on in
ternal problems and to bolster his
position within the Communist
Party. At this stage, foreign af
fairs take a back scat to the
mighty task of making backward
China an industrial power.
All of Chou's recommendations
for reorganization of the many
government ministries were ap
proved by the Chinese Peoples'
Congress as it wound up its ses
sion. The Congress also approved
measures for the five-year plan,
including a 1958 budget.
