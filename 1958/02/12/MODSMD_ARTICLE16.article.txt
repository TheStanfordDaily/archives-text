# WORKHORSE' FIRED
## Redstone Test May Reveal New Secrets 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/!')
A fire-belching Redstone ballistic
missile — the workhorse of the
American space weapon arsenal
blasted off its firing pad here
last night.
The Redstone, first-stage back
bone of the Jupiter-C rocket thnt
hurled the first U.S. satellite into
orbit around the earth Jan. 31,
roared up into a black, overcast
Florida sky at 7:52 p.m. (EST).
Its test flight out over the At
lantic Ocean may yield much in
formation vital to America in her
effort to beat Russia to a solution
of the secrets of outer space.
Basically, the Redstone is a 200-
mile ballistic missile — a simple,
dependable, long - range artillery
weapon that could be set up, aim
ed and fired by GI Joe in the field.
It is so far advanced, the Army
claims, that it can be placed in
the hands of its troops by mid
summer.
Redstone's Exotic Bole
The furious public demand for
an American earth satellite to
match the Russian Sputniks cast
the Redstone in a more exotic role
and made it the free world's most
famous space rocket. It was
thrust into duty as the first stage
of the makeshift Jupiter-C, which
performed so brilliantly in launch
ing the Explorer satellite, now
circling the world.
And in the near future the
Army hopes to employ the Red
stone again to fire bigger moon ;
which will pave the way to man
ned space stations that could keep
a constant military watch on the
world.
Space Station Race
Experts say America must hur
ry if it is to beat Russia in estab
lishing such all-important obser
vation bases in space.
For the launching of Explorer
the Redstone's fuel tanks were en
larged. taking up the area nor
mally reserved for its warhead,
and a secret fuel called "Hidyne"
was substituted. This fuel gave it
an initial thrust of 83,000 pounds.
