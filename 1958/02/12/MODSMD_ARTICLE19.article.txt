# Judicial Council Petition
## 
### 
Tin: ASSU Legislature saw fit last week to vote
clown proposed amendments to the section of
the bylaws dealing with the judicial councils
and their procedure. The amendments, pre
sented to Legislature as the result of a Daily
inquiry into council procedures, would, in our
opinion, eliminate many of the councils' ineffi
cient and awkward methods of gathering evi
dence and trying cases, and would provide stu
dents with concrete guarantees against possible
miscarriages of justice.
In accordance with the right given us by the
ASSU constitution, a petition is being circu
lated today and tomorrow in living groups
calling for student support of tlie defeated
amendments.
Tlie proposals, as listed on the petition, are
as follows:
1) No trial may be held unless the accused
has been presented with the specific charges
against him, in writing and in advance.
2) The accused shall have the. right to hear
and see all testimony and evidence presented

against him, to question all witnesses against
him, and to have a public trial if In- desires.
The accused shall never be compelled to In- a
U'itness against himself.
3) The accused shall have a compulsory
process for obtaining witnesses in his favor
[ i.e., the right to subpoena witnesses], and may
have assistance in liis defense.
It' 5 per cent of the student body—4ll stu
dents—sign the petition, Legislature will have
the choice of adopting the amendments or of
submitting them to a student referendum be
fore the end of the quarter.
We hope the necessary number of students
will sign the petition. The rights contained in
its provisions are basic to any democracy, and
their adoption would certainlv improve the
eftieienev of campus justice. Since Legislature
does not agree, all of us have the right and the
opportunity to express our opinions. We hope
that rifiht will be exercised. If nothing else,
the success of the petition will permit further
discussion and study of what has come to be an
extremely controversial subject.

It' 5 per cent of the student body—4ll stu
dents—sign the petition, Legislature will have
the choice of adopting the amendments or of
submitting them to a student referendum be

We hope the necessary number of students
will sign the petition. The rights contained in
its provisions are basic to any democracy, and
their adoption would certainlv improve the
eftieienev of campus justice. Since Legislature
does not agree, all of us have the right and the
opportunity to express our opinions. We hope
that rifiht will be exercised. If nothing else,
the success of the petition will permit further
discussion and study of what has come to be an
extremely controversial subject.
