Lack of Musical Understanding
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily has always been very co
operative in giving adequate publicity to musical
performances on campus. With its policy of
keeping the students informed about campus
events, The Daily has attempted to review these
musical performances whenever possible.
Unfortunately, the students who write these
reviews often lack the background necessary to
do an effective job. The review in Monday's
Daily of the orchestra concerts was an outstand
ing illustration of poor taste, lack of musical
understanding and plain false statements.
The reviewer, Miss Rodenhouse, as an orches
tra member, should never have been asked to re
view a concert in which she was performing.
She was not in a position to give an objective ac
count of the performance. She seemed to feel
obligated to criticize negatively as much of the
concert as she could; in so doing, she said many
things which are not true.
In the beginning of the article, she quoted Mr.
Salgo out of context. She should have realized
that what a conductor says to his orchestra be
fore a concert should be heard only by that or
chestra. What he said was not a prediction, but
rather a mild reminder that we should not be
overconfident because of the success of our pre
vious concert.
Contrary to Miss Rodenhouse's opinion, the
orchestra and the soloist performed even more
successfully at Sunday afternoon's concert. If
she doubts this, I invite her to listen to the tape
recordings of both concerts. By doing so, I'm
sure she will discover how wrong she was in say
in t that the strings . . straggled as much as
t beat behind."
I agree with Miss Rodenhouse that Miss Vial
turned in an excellent performance on Friday
evening, one which was surpassed on Sunday.
I have heard many concert violinists, and I have

yot to hear one who did not . . hit a few sour
notes." The statement that the soloist . . did
n't even wince visibly . . because of "sour
notes" has no place in a critique. I am a violinist
myself, and therefore, I think, better qualified
to .judge Miss Vial's performance lhan Miss Ilo
denhouse is. Miss Vial played very musically;
she has a warm, full tone which was well suited
to the Beethoven concerto; her intonation was
practically flawless; her interpretation of the
work was restrained and yet showed an under
standing and maturity which one might expect
from artists who are much older and better
known. Any review of 1 his concert should have
at least mentioned these things.
As a point of interest to Miss Rodenhouse, only
two-note chords on the violin are called double
stops; three-note chords are triple-stops.
Miss Rodenhouse says that the theme in the
second movement of the Franck ". . . wound in
and out of nearly every section in the orchestra,
holding the audience spellbound." I wonder how
she observed this when she was sitting on stage,
a full 30 or 40 feet from the audience, with the
stage lights shining in her eyes. In criticizing
the last movement of the Franck, Miss Roden
house misquoted the description of the structure
of the movement from her program notes. It is
a modified sonata form, not a "modified sonata."
Anyone who has ever laken Music I would know
that a single movement could not possibly be a
"modified sonata."
I do not mean to imply that the symphony
concerts were flawless; they were not. There
were many things which a reviewer might legiti
mately criticize; but Miss Rodenhouse did not
mention any of them. If The Daily cannot find
someone with more experience or a betler knowl
edge of music to write its reviews, it would |be J
better to omit the review completely than to
have another like the one in Monday's Daily.
