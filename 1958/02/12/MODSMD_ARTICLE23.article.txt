Naoum Blinder was given a tre
mendous ovation when he return

D Major," he recovered himself
and performed the delicate em
broidery of Ihe cadenzas and ihe
theme ornamentations in a dy

li seems that the San Francisco
Opera has joined the "Met" in
censuring Maria Callas for her
failure to appear as contracted.
She has disappointed audiences in
New York and San Francisco as
well as walking out on a perform
ance in Rome.
Temperamental prima donnas
have disappeared in this day and
age of world t o u r s and close
scheduling, and Callas will soon
find all doors closed to her if she
continues in her inconsiderate
ways. However, it is heart-warm

yesteryear.
