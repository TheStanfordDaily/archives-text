### Camille Petersen 
"Major Barbara," George Ber
nard Shaw's comic satire on so
ciety's accepted moral standards,
opened with vigor last week end
at the Encore Theater, in San
Francisco. Outsanding performer
of the evening was Craig Hamp
ton as Andrew Undershaft. indus
trialist. »
Hampton, for all practical pur
poses, "becomes" the millionaire
cannon • maker Shaw created to
express his views, to wit: "The
greatest of our evils, and the
worst of our crimes, is poverty,
and our first duty, to which every
other consideration should be sac
rificed, is not to be poor. . . ."
Though Hampton presents the
character on a grand scale of mo
tion and expression, the role does
not suffer from the exaggeration
which plagues the part of Lady
Britomar Undershaft, played by
Winnifred Parker.
She delivers the majority of her
lines well. The part of the society-

conscious woman call s for an
amount of canned movements, but
at times Mrs. Parker accentuates
them too much. On a regular
stage this is sometimes necessary,
but in the centralized circle-round
staging at the Encore it tends to
stilt the action.
The title role of Ma.j. Barbara
Undershaft of the Salvation Army
is played by Jean Grosvenor. Miss
Grosvenor gives a convincing por
trayal of the young woman bent
on saving souls from "Bodger's
Whiskey and other evils," only to
find that, in truth, it was these
moneyed men who supported the
Army.
The well-handled portrayals of
Shaw's colorful characters found
in the Salvation Army shelter
should bring swells of laughter
and a feeling of understanding
from anv audience.
