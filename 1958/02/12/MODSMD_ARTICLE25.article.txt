# 'hot house' for growing crystals! ...from plum-size up to 8-in. diameter, largest ever grown
## 
### 
This, the world's longest line of crystal "pullers," is
typical of advanced engineering-in-action in which
you are invited to share at Texas Instruments ...
largest producer of silicon transistors and a major
source for germanium transistors as well as silicon
diodes and rectifiers ... with many engineering
"firsts" in semiconductors.
At Tf, you will push out beyond existing limitations
— in research, development, design, and manufacture
— into new concepts and new products ... into vital
fields such as electronics, semiconductor behavior,
infrared optics, missile control, high speed data reduc
tion, and many others. This pioneering approach has
been so successful that Texas Instruments has grown
20-fold in the last 10 years to a current $70 million
volume ... a growth accelerated by recognition of
individual achievement... a growth you can share.
