### Steve Baffrey 
Watson of (lincinnati
AN UNDERHAND LOOK Contrary to the notices in our sterling
humor magazine, The Stanford Chaparral, it is not my fortune to
know the possessor of the University record for either the best time
recorded in running a length of steam tunnel or for in-front-of-the
library flagpole-climbing. But that glossy-paged epistle was instru
mental in providing an idea, that of searching for Stanford person
alities who have made their athletic marks in the world "outside"
the campus, the Pacific (oast Conference, and the intramural
leagues.
One sports personality whose mark has been made outside the
Stanford sports world is a member of the Cincinnati Reds organiza
tion of the National Baseball League. Sophomore Steve Watson
came to Stanford expecting to play ball with the Indians but then
came the Reds and their contract.
Uuntler his three-year guaranteed commitment Steve, who is at
Stanford only during autumn and winter quarters, currently is pitch
ing for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. In his first
season with the Rainiers last summer Wats-on worked only in relief
"when tlie games were so far gone it seemed safe enough to put me
in for a work-out."
He saw. service in "six or seven games, about 35 innings" and
managed to get tagged for only one loss, but "didn't win any either."
He expects that his crucial season is going to be the one coming up.
"r'in/<i»inu4i iu u.t>nL nil fhe IllOlltld

so I expect I'll work a lot more
this summer and maybe next
summer, it' I do okay, I'll {jet a
major league tryout."
Watson's been pitching for a
long time. I lis selection, in the
spring of 195G, as a Utah All-
American was the culmination of
a very successful high school ca
reer. In his senior year Watson
came through with an impressive
KM record averaging IS strike
outs a game, even getting as high
as 20 one time out.
"But in my sophomore and jun
ior years I didn't do as well," he
notes, adding, "We didn't have a
good team. I'd strike out 17 or so
and still lose —it was-frustrating."
CLASSIC EXAMPLE — Watson
is one of a very few pitchers who
make the coveted No. 4 spot in a
batting order. A long ball hitter,
the Sail Laker averaged a sharp
.100 through high school and
slugged at a .r»B2 clip.

And it isn't only baseball in
which Watson has made a name for himself. Me was viewed favor
ably as a football candidate by Chuck Taylor and staff here at Stan
l'onl and by -lack Curtice and Co. at Utah, to mention a few. He
was a IJtali All-State halfback for two years and posted a (5.5 yards
per-carry mark as a junior and an even better one as a senior, "but
our team was so good no one noticed me."
Summer semi-pro ball has been a stamping ground for Watson,
100. "I broke into semi-pro when I was 1(5," he remembers. In his
first game he chalked up 14 strike-outs, a four-hitter and a win.
"The semi-pros don't play too many games, though, so you don't
get much chance to work," he complains.
Academically the pitcher is looking forward toward a career in
psychiatry and is a pre-med major, lie racked up a score of aca
demic achievements while in school and is holding a substantial
average among the Stanfordiles.
Brodie, Quasi, Zeiss and A 1
AND OTHERS (some of whom we know) It's been a year since
John Brodie quarterbaeked the Stanford eleven and pushed himself
into the national collegiate passing limelight, but he's now a football
pro (4f)ers, you know) and is registered here this quarter.
And, of course, bashful Anne Quast whose stature in the ladies'
golf world is not to be scoffed at. A long shot might even include

a young female transfer from
I'urdue, Margot Zeiss by name,
who, although she seems more
inclined to the symphonic - intel
lectual point of view, is a sail
boater of renown back in the Pur
due area, and also rides and
jumps a mean horse, if that's the
way you'd say it.
Maybe you won't call it athletic
(until you try it some time) but
there's always Al Harrington's
sword dancing. Al is appealing
here and there in the Bay Area
"working his way through col
lege."
SPORTS SHORTS — I expect
Stanford will beat USC Friday
night; the Stanford band, that is.
Should walk all over the Trojans'
traveling aggregation of musi
cians. Did last year down South
anyway. But wouldn't be a bit
surprised if Howie Dallmar's In
dians came through in a slight
manner of upset. That's the kind
of ball they like to play. With the
race so tight, it's about to be
busted open and as long as it ap
pears 'too remote for the Indians
to make the top, they might as
well open it up so that, somebody
can get a good hold on it.
