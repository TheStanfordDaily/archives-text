# 10-8 MARK
## Trojans Feature Balance 
### 
Balance without tho presence
of any one individual star is the;
story behind tho 1957-58 USC bas
ketball team that will invade
Stanford Pavilion Friday to bat
tle the Indians.
This all-around team effective
ness has carried Forrest Two
good's club to a 10-8 season rec
ord, including six wins and three
defeats in Pacific Coast Confer
ence play.
Jim Pugh, a senior forward
from Inglewood, is the top Tro
jan in the scoring department al
though boasting only a 12.3
points-per-game average.
Deadeye
Pugh has been very effective
from the field, hitting on 41.7 per
cent of his shots. He came into
his own near the end of last year,
and hasn't stopped since. Pugh
could be especially dangerous
against the Tribe because of his
excellent speed.
The man who's come through
precisely as hoped is big Jim
Hanna, Troy's sophomore center.
He's been bucketing better than
11 points each time out. Hanna
has used his 6-7 frame effectively
on the boards, pulling off 171 re
bounds in 18 games.
Back-Court Combo
Jack Mount and Monte Gon/a
le.s form an effective back-court !
combination for ihe Trojans, j
Gonzales, only a junior, is the I
other SC man in the double fig
ures scoringwise with a It).8 av
erage.
His chief weakness has been at !
the free-lhrow line, where he's 1
managed to score on only 34 of
65 foul shots. Mount is hilling at
just a 7.6 average, but he's been
ihe deadeye from the floor wilh
an excellent '11.8 per cent shoot-!
ing mark.
Phil Dye is Ihe fifth man on
the floor for Ihe invaders. Like
Pugh, he sports a 11.7 mark in
field goal accuracy. His strong
est poinl is rebounding, where J
he's second only to Hanna.
Strong Bench
Jim White, Jerry Pimm, John-,
ny Werhas, Mike Fryer, Pill
Bloom and Steve Kemp all help
give Ihe Trojans one of ihe PCC's
strongest benches. It's this deplh
that is causing Tribe coach How
ie Dallmar one of his biggesl
headaches as he prepares for the
Southlanders.
But for a pair of lasl-minulo
losses to' UCLA, the Trojans 1
might be commandingly ahead in
Ihe Coast race. Two weeks ago,
(he Bruins first won 52-51, then
pulled out an 80-75 overtime lii
umph.

headaches as he prepares for the
Southlanders.
But for a pair of lasl-minulo
losses to' UCLA, the Trojans 1
might be commandingly ahead in

of any one individual star is the;
story behind tho 1957-58 USC bas

This all-around team effective
ness has carried Forrest Two
good's club to a 10-8 season rec
ord, including six wins and three
defeats in Pacific Coast Confer

Jim Pugh, a senior forward
from Inglewood, is the top Tro
jan in the scoring department al
though boasting only a 12.3
points-per-game average.
Deadeye
Pugh has been very effective
from the field, hitting on 41.7 per
cent of his shots. He came into
his own near the end of last year,
and hasn't stopped since. Pugh
could be especially dangerous
against the Tribe because of his
excellent speed.
The man who's come through
precisely as hoped is big Jim
Hanna, Troy's sophomore center.
He's been bucketing better than
11 points each time out. Hanna
has used his 6-7 frame effectively
on the boards, pulling off 171 re
bounds in 18 games.

the free-lhrow line, where he's 1
