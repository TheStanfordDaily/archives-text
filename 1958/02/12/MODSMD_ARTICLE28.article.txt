# Haga, Thuesen, PCC Leaders
## 
### 
Stanford's Dick Haga and Jerry Thuesen have taken the lead in
two PCC shooting divisions according to the latest conference statis
tics.
Haga h;is scored on 34 of his 70 field goal attempts for a 48.7 per
cent shooting m;>rk and has taken the lead away from Idaho's Hal

Damiano.
Thuesen, who has scored on
the phenomenal total of 20 out of
22 foul shots for 91.9 per cent,
is many percentage points ahead
of runner-up Don Mcintosh of
California.
Haga, the strong Stanford cen
ter, is also ranked highly in sev
eral other individual departments
besides field goal percentage. He
has hit on 32 of 43 four shot at
tempts for a .745 average and
ranks in the number nine spot in
the conference.
Haga's .119 percentage in re
bounds places him in the league's
number five position, and his 11.1
point average is also among the
conference's best.
Thuesen's 14 of 16 foul shots
against Oregon State two weeks
ago helped push him up into the
conference lead.
Five spots below Thuesen in
free throws is Stanford's Paul
Neumann with an .813 percent
age. Captain Neumann's eight
free throws for eight attempts
against Washington is still the
league's outstanding perform
ance to date.
