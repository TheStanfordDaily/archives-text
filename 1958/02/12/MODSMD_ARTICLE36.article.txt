# Persuasion Produced Pioneer Prexy

Senator Leland Stanford and
his wife met David Starr Jordan
for the first time on March 22,
1891. Within 10 minutes after
their meeting, the offer involving
the presidency of the University
was made.
Jordan had been recommended
by the presidents of Cornell and
Johns Hopkins. He was 40 and
had been a member of the pioneer
class of Cornell. Now he was to
be a pioneer once again—the head
pioneer.
All the money he could use was
promised Jordan as he set out to
select a staff. The University was
scheduled to open its doors in
October, IS9I. Stanford wanted no
"dead stock"—ornamental or idle
professors.
Jordan figured that 15 profes
sors or instructors would be suf
ficient. He felt he could stretch
the number by not counting the

librarian, registrar, or foreman of
the woodworking shop as "teach
ers."
The first person to receive an
offer of a professorship was Dr.
John Casper Branner. On March
23, 1891, the day Jordan officially
accepted the presidency of the
University, he wrote Branner that
he expected to nominate him for
the chair of geology. Branner later
became the second president of
the University.
As it became apparent that the
enrollment was going to exceed
the expected 250, Jordan set out
to add to the staff. When he fin
ished, the staff was not exactly
"balanced," but it was a go o d
working body and put Stanford
alongside leading universities of

the country with staff and equip
ment adequate to the work it was
undertaking to do.
From far and near they came
for dedication of the University
on Oct. 1, 1891.
"It is our hope," Stanford said,
"that the young women and the
young men who graduate from
Palo Alio shall be not only schol
ars but shall have a sound, practi
cal idea of commonplace, every
day matters; a self-reliance that
will fit them, in case of emergen
cy, to earn their own livelihood in
a humble as well as an exalted
sphere. . . .
"You, students, are the most
important factor in the Univer
sity. It is for your benefit that it
has been established."
