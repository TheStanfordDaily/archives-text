# Christopher Calls Knight 'Labor Slave'
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (/P) Mayor
George Christopher of San Fran
cisco charged yesterday that Gov
ernor Knight, his opponent for
the Republican nomination for
U.S. senator, is "a slave of a very
small group of labor leaders."
The mayor, in a talk at Town
Hall, said evidence of this was
Governor Knight's appointment of
Harry Finks, vice president of the
California State AFL, to the state
Personnel Board.
"Finks is the only one in the
California delegation who voted
against Vice President Nixon at
the 1956 Republican convention,"
said Christopher.
The San Francisco mayor de
nied. however, as he has before,
that Knight switched'from the
governor race to the senatorial
race because of any "deal." He
said, however, he recognizes that
such reports persist, commenting:
"It would be a terrible thing
now if either Mr. Knight or I
withdrew. Alm os t everybody
would believe we had participated
in another deal."
Christopher said he is not for
the "right to work" laws "as they
are being interpreted at the pres
ent time."
