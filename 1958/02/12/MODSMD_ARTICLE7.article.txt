# 'MINIMIZE IMPACT'
## Tunis Asks U.S. Censure Of Bombing 
### 
WASHINGTON (/IV Secretary
of State Dulles reported yesterday
that Tunisia has requested Ameri
can support in a move to denounce
France before the United Nations
for bombing a Tunisian border
village last Saturday.
Dulles said it would be "pre
mature" to decide whether to back
any such complaint, because Tu
nisia was vague about what the
UN might do.
He appealed to both sides to
"minimize the impact" of the
bombing and seek to develop close
and friendly relations of the kind
he believes necessary between
North Africa and western Europe.
"Middle Course"
Dulles talked about the French-
Tunisian crisis at a news confer
ence, where he carefully sought to
steer a middle course, in keeping
with past policy.
He hinted, however, he might
favor international discussion of
the quarrel unless the French
took quick steps to calm the situ
ation.
Dulles spoke out an hour after
French Ambassador Herve Al
phand called at the State Depart
ment to advise that his govern
ment is considering paying an in
demnity to the faiJiilies of the 78
persons killed and 84 wounded in
the bombing assault.
At the same time, Tunisian am
bassador Mongi Slim in New York
sounded out other nations in an
effort to obtain support for a pro
test to the UN Security Council.
Newsmen Answered
Dulles made these other main
points in answering newsmen's
questions:
1. The earth satellite launched
by the United States has "re-estab
lished the prestige" of America
abroad and reassured friendly na
tions about U.S. capabilities in the
outer-space race with the Soviets.
2. The present Indonesian gov
ernment, headed by President Su
karno, "does not entirely satisfy
large segments of the population"
who are opposed to a Communist
dominated government. Dulles did
not specifically call Sukarno's re
gime Red-dominated, but implied
that the "guided democracy" it
was seeking to install was contra
ry to the host interests of all
Indonesia.
3. The United States will shut
down its embassy in Syria and
keep its top diplomatic represen
tation in Cairo, if Egypt and Syria
follow through with plans to
merge into a single Arab nation.
A consulate general's office would
be maintained in Damascus, how
ever. The union would mean that
Syria would have to give up its
ambassador to Washington and
the UN, in Dulles' view.

He appealed to both sides to
"minimize the impact" of the
bombing and seek to develop close
and friendly relations of the kind
he believes necessary between
North Africa and western Europe.
"Middle Course"
Dulles talked about the French-
Tunisian crisis at a news confer
ence, where he carefully sought to
steer a middle course, in keeping
with past policy.
He hinted, however, he might
favor international discussion of
the quarrel unless the French
took quick steps to calm the situ
ation.
Dulles spoke out an hour after
French Ambassador Herve Al
phand called at the State Depart
ment to advise that his govern
ment is considering paying an in
demnity to the faiJiilies of the 78
persons killed and 84 wounded in
the bombing assault.
At the same time, Tunisian am
bassador Mongi Slim in New York
sounded out other nations in an
effort to obtain support for a pro
test to the UN Security Council.
Newsmen Answered
Dulles made these other main
points in answering newsmen's
questions:
1. The earth satellite launched
by the United States has "re-estab
lished the prestige" of America
abroad and reassured friendly na
tions about U.S. capabilities in the
outer-space race with the Soviets.
2. The present Indonesian gov
ernment, headed by President Su
karno, "does not entirely satisfy
large segments of the population"
who are opposed to a Communist
dominated government. Dulles did
not specifically call Sukarno's re
gime Red-dominated, but implied
that the "guided democracy" it
was seeking to install was contra
ry to the host interests of all
Indonesia.
3. The United States will shut
down its embassy in Syria and
keep its top diplomatic represen
tation in Cairo, if Egypt and Syria
follow through with plans to
merge into a single Arab nation.
A consulate general's office would
be maintained in Damascus, how
ever. The union would mean that
Syria would have to give up its
ambassador to Washington and
the UN, in Dulles' view.
WASHINGTON (/IV Secretary
of State Dulles reported yesterday
that Tunisia has requested Ameri
can support in a move to denounce
France before the United Nations
for bombing a Tunisian border
village last Saturday.
Dulles said it would be "pre
mature" to decide whether to back
any such complaint, because Tu
nisia was vague about what the
UN might do.
