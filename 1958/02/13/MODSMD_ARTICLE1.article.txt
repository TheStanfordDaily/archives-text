# Plays Appear 'Briskly Paced'
## 
### Pat Brenner 
Professional liming and briskly paced movement outweighed Iho
few weak performances in al least two of the three short plays pre
sented last night at the first of four productions of the 1938 Win
ter One-Acts. Performances will be given nightly through Saturday;
curtain time is 8:15.
The technical crew and actors vied for top honors in the entertain-

ing experimental drama "Game,"
j by Timothy Welch. A wealth of
; ingenious stage devices created
; an impressionistic effect, and the
cast flashed across the stage as
• if having the time of their lives.
With the exception of the cock
tail party scene, which bogged
down in the middle, the move
ment was brisk, lively and at
times marvelously funny.
Professional Production
Tim Ward, as Gay Repartee,
Doug Johnson as his brother
Roger and Carl Hillenbrand as
Freddy gave remarkably polished
performances, even on rare mo
ments when the play lagged, but
never lost the feeling for their
pa its. Under- the careful direc
tion of Richard C. Lamb, the en
tire cast moved for the most part
j with professional,precision.
The second play. "Don't Call
; Us," by William C. West, was
dominated by Celia Howard and
Ken Purcell, who conflict as a
dreamy, ambitious wife and a
harsh realist. Miss Howard was
brilliant in her role, and Purcell
I was dynamic as the hard - facts
mechanic. The short, taut social
j drama, well directed by Edward
| S. Crane, was marred only by the
two-dimensional emoting by Jack
I Ncssel, who was at best uncon
vincing.
A Few Flaws
The one possible exception to
•a successfully entertaining eve
ning was the opener, "Strawberry
Compote," by Charles Barclay
Goldsmith. A slow-moving com
edy, it had chances for bright
lines, but unfortunately everyone
said exactly what was expected.
The play was not a total loss,
thanks to two lovable bears, a
lively performance by Robert
Lehrer as a peanut vender, and
an ending written and directed
with more control than is found
in the remainder of the play.
