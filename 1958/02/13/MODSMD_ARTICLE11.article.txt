# Iraq, Jordan Plan Union
## 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (/P) Kings
Hussein of Jordan and Faisal II
of Iraq will retain their thrones
when their countries unite under
a single flag and foreign policy
within the next 24 hours, authori
tative sources said last night.
Hussein and Faisal, 22-year-old
Hashemite cousins, plan to sign
the proclamation today.
The two Arab kingdoms report
edly will share single foreign, de
fense and economic ministries, as
well as one army.
There will be one parliament
for the two countries, but each
also will have its own legislative
body.
One result of the Jordan-Iraq
merger may be to take Iraq out
of the anti-Communist Baghdad
Pact, which also includes Britain,
Pakistan, Turkey and Iran. But
the union of the two pro-Western
kingdoms is expected to counter
some of the appeal which the new
United Arab Republic (Syria and
Egypt) has for Arab nationalists.
