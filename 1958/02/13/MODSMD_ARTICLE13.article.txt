## Open Shop Discussed By Stuckey

Voluntary unionist Thorn a %
Stuckey told the Political Union
Republican caucus that the pri
mary gain of the currently pro
posed right-to-work laws would bo
employees' freedom of choice in
joining unions, and emphasized
that most of the present contro
versy over the laws stems from
mutual misunderstanding of em
ployers and employees.
Said Stuckey, field representa
tive of the California Employers
Association, to yesterday after
noon's meeting at Bowman Alum
ni House, "We are not trying to
break unions." He pointed out
that almost all employers and em
ployees agree on the importance
of unions.
"Union bosses are the ones that
are mainly worried about this
thing," he said, "because it would
reduce their power."
Many employers do not oppose
union shop contracts; many, how
ever, go to great lengths to avoid
unionism. All too many reluctant
employers are intimidated by
threats of union picketing for
union shop contracts. Such pick
eting is usually, quite effective.
Once an employer does have a
union shop contract, he would
often rather submit to union prac
tices and demands rather than en
gage in costly disputes. When a
union has a union-shop contract,
it can coerce its members into
measures that they often lack the
knowledge to combat by legal
means.
Stuckey showed the group a
copy of a current i>etttion for the
right-to-work laws. Questions fol
lowed his talk, which dealt mainly
with the case for democratic prac
tices in unions.
