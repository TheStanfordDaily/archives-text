Northern Ireland Forgotten
Editor, The Daily:
In your editorial "Vengeance in Tunisia" you
refer to the termination of all British influence
in Ireland. Whfle it is perfectly clear to me what
you mean, I should like to draw attention to the
fact that the reference is, in the strict sense, in
accurate. So far as I am aware, I am a subject
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. It would have been more ap
propriate to speak of Southern [sic] Ireland.

Our apologies to the British subjects of
Northern Ireland. —Editor.
Placement Service Progress
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is written in regard to the Eriday
editorial entitled "Accomplice to Discrimina
tion?"
The only information we request in the Place
ment Service is that which is necessary or help
ful in filling employers' requests. As The Daily
pointed out, this information is kept in confi
dence.
There is a blank in our form for "Church" be
cause much of our work is in teacher placement
and whether a person were Protestant or Catho
lic could become significant in filling an order
from a sectarian-supported school.
In looking back at Placement Service forms
for teachers, 30 years ago, applicants were asked
to designate whether they smoked, danced,
played cards, or used alcohol.
I believe we have come a long way.

Daily Mast Change
Editor, The Daily:
We notice that the new volume of The Daily
has a new mast head. There appears to be little
difference in the banner "The Stanford, Daily,"
but "Associated Students of Stanford University"
has been eliminated in favor of "The Peninsula's
Only Morning Newspaper." What's the reason,
if any, behind the change? Is The Daily ashamed
of being associated with its publisher, the Stan
ford student body? Or could it be that it is now
all too obvious that The Daily no longer repre
sents the student body? Or did it ever? Or will
it ever?

Pride or shame in its publisher has nothing
to do with The Daily's flag underline change.
The Associated Students are given due credit
in the page 2 masthead, which is the normal
practice of all city newspapers and of the vast
majority of college papers" (witness The Daily
Californian, whose flag proclaims it the "Mon
arch of the College Dailies").
The Daily has broken with a two-year tradi
tion to return to the 64-year tradition of an
"Associated Students" - less flag. The ASSIJ
underline was adopted in 1956 for aesthetic
reasons only. The fact that The Daily is the
Peninsula's only morning newspaper is unique;
that it is published by the Associated Students
is not. The change in the flag in no way af
fects The Daily's relationship to the ASSIJ or
its "representation" of the student body. —Edi-

Some Are Worried
Editor, The Daily:
Serious explanation (inasmuch as I type with
one finger only) of Jungle of Primeval Passion
—since some are worried. Very briefly, my point
is that the competitive structure of Western so
ciety which has for its practical purposes the
end-goal of success for all its members, in reality
requires that some succeed at the expense of
others. The frustration-aggression complex upon
which so much breath is spent arises within this
social structure. Treatment of individual psycho
logical structures is merely symptomatic. What
is required is a sociological analysis that will go
to the roots of the contradictions of bourgeois
society. Meantime, the analysts serve an excel
lent ideological function in locating the source of
the conflict in some state of nature latent before
entrance into the cultural process, and activated
in the case that the individual fails to adjust to
his gecond, i.e. social, nature.
My point is that it adds insult to injury to
persuade the undersized, underfed starvelings of
our Skid Rows that they were once (and could
be again, given a healthy outlook), club-swinging
he-men; while at the same time it flatters the
imagination of our pale-faced, pinch-shouldered
clerks that their wild natures are also being
caged by this same social process. Or again, if
we are looking for the sublimations of the jungle
in, say, the Jardin des Tuileries, we do better to
look at life in the "sewers of Paris" than upon
some exotic South Sea island, however accessible
to Student Tours. All this, though in general it
is not my desire to oppress readers with the
meaning of my remarks.

False Alarm Fines
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford has now descended 1o the level of the
medieval Catholic Church. The outrageous
"fines" charged freshman men for fire alarms,
broken windows and light fixtures compare fa
vorably with the debilitating taxes and fees of
the medieval Church. Although there may be
some remotely possible explanation for paying
$5 for a window pane, $7 for a broken lamp
bowl, I find it impossible to explain away a $350
fee for a false fire alarm. Last quarter's rate of
$100 vtfas a bit exorbitant, but Ibis time the
grasping, money-loving attitude of Stanford IT.
has really gone too far. The false alarm for
which Wilbur Hall is now being bled occurred
during the latest frosh fiasco the recent panty
raid. It is uncertain if freshmen actually set off
the alarm; at any rate they are collectively re
sponsible for it. But $350 for one fire truck ride
from Corp Yard to Wilbur-absurd!
Why the sudden increase in fine of 250 per cent
over last quarter's ruinous extortion? This ques
tion is being asked by all freshmen at Wilbur,
and the answer we get is really hilarious. In all
seriousness we are told that ihe "profits" go to
some obscure scholarship fund. Get that char
ily. Why not charge Wilbur a round sum; some
thing like $2000, for instance? Think of all the
glorious humanitcirianism forced on innocent
students who can do nothing but laugh at the
whole thing. And what of the depraved idiot who
set the thing off? If he lives at Wilbur he pays
50 cents for a ringside seat at one of the most
ridiculous situations possible.
