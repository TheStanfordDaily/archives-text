# Campus Opinion

### Jack Winkler 
Changes in the rushing pro-]
gram, as well as the problems of
host integrating studentsj into
the campus situation, have raised i
questions regarding the Univer
sity policy ol' isolating freshmen ;
in their own dormitories.
This problem is also related to
thf condition in Lagunita— which
is almost exclusively a sopho
more dormitory.
This week The Daily asked the
students for their opinions on
this controversial issue. The fol-1
lowing are a random sampling of
student ideas:
Dave Newell, Wilbur, '(>l—"lt
is better ihe first year to have
people studying and learning to
gether in their own group than
with others who are already set
in iheir ways."
Eleanor Ogden, Union, '58
"Integrated living is very worth
while. I'm terribly opposed to
sophomores being put in separate J
dorms; freshman dorms are sti
fling experiences because every
one has the same problems and
dues lIk 1 same things."
Joelle Bunting, Lagunita, '(>0
"In the present arrangement
freshmen get to meet members
of their own class, which is very
valuable. The other three classes
would benefit from a greater
mixing of ages."
Carol Moscrip, Rol>l«>, '61 "I
think freshman dorms segregate
ihe freshmen into a coddling so
cial cradle that coaxes them not
to break the safe menial and so
cial limitations of high schood."
Marilyn Thompson, Lagunita,
'60 —"All classes except the fresh
men should be mixed. The frosh

I have special problems of adjust
ment which can best be handled
| among themselves."
Janet Helms, Koble, '61—"I be
lieve the freshman dorms are a
good idea as we get to know each
other so well. The sponsors save
us from complete 'segregation.'
After the freshman year a vari
ety of outlooks and experiences
is more valuable."
John Schwartz, off-campus, '60
—"1 think it's a darn good idea
to mix classes in dorms. Now, a
guy who pledges a fraternity
never has a good chance to meet
upperclassmen who aren't in his
fraternity."
Mike Oman, Wilbur, '61 —"I
think the freshmen should all live
together'. It gives I hem an oppor
tunity to get to know others in
Iheir class and promotes a sense
of unity."
Judy Kadushiu, Union, '60—"T
think that freshmen living with
upperclassmen will mature more
quickly. By experience they will
| adjust to their surroundings. Up
i perclassmen will be able to be
come acquainted with other
courses offered by the Univer
sity."
Karlmra Paisley, Lagunita, '60
"Freshmen make friends eas
ier when they are with their own
class. The sponsors will give
them Ihe benefit of upperclass
experiences. The other classes
should be more evenly inte
grated."
Steve Foster, Wilbur, '61 —
"Freshmen should all live togeth
i er. They're all going through the
same thing and they can work it
I out together."
