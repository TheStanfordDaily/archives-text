Defense—defense—defense!
That's what's put Pete Newell's
California basketball team whore
it i« now, and it's the thing that
will cause Stanford plenty of trou
ble when the two teams square
off in the Pavilion Monday at
8 p.m.
Of eour.se, the Indians fare
more immediate problems when
they tangle with Southern Cali

pennant-contending Rears would

A casual observer, doesn't have
to look any further than the
Bears' team statistics to see just
how much defense is emphasized
at Berkeley.
Cal has only Iwo men in double
figures in the scoring column,
and they're averaging just 10/1 j
and 10.2 point-s each.
Fourth in U.S.
But in the matter of limiting
opponents Cal finds itself in the
No. 4 spot nationally and a dis
tant leader in the PCC.
En route to their 11-6 record
this year, ihe Bears have been
yielding just 53.7 digits to each i
opponent. And in Conference ac
tion Cal has an average more
than 5 points under that.
When Cal trounced Stanford,
00-45, several weeks ago, the key
defensive factors were their col
lapsing on the inside men and
iheir harassing of the guards,
even in the back-court.
The maneuver worked particu

| larly well in the second half when
Stanford failed to score a field
goal during one 9-minute period,
j This futile stretch broke up Ihe
game after the Cards had gamely
pulled to within 2 points of the
Bears.
Senior guard and captain Earl
Robinson is probably the key man
in the tight defensive setup. He's
a master at unnerving opponents,
land he stole the ball more than
once in the last court Big Game.
Early in the season Robinson
was having his troubles. Saddled
with the team leadership, he ap
j peared to be pressing too hard
and was guilty of many basic
I errors.

Weak from Floor
Robinson-ha-sn't been too strong
in Ihe scoring department, with
; less than 10 points each time out
and less than a l-for-3 average
from the floor.
Top man in scoring for the
Bears has been 6-6 center Don
Mcintosh, who boasts the 10.4
mark. He's also the rewound
j leader, with 121 pull-downs. j
Al Buch is the No. 2 man in I
scoring and is probably the most
unorthodox shooter of the lot. In!
the East he'd be right in style,
but Buch's two-hand, overhead set j
shots are a novelty in the PCC.

Quick Shooter
He's adept at getting off the
quick shot, first giving the im
pression he'll pass, and then flip
ping a long two-hander. Buch is
plenty accurate, too, as his 42.1
•shooting percentage will testify.
Cal drops a notch in class after
the top three, although forwards.
Bob Dalton, Jack Grout and j
George Sterling have done a cred- j
itable job and have shown im-1
provement in recent weeks.
