# TUNISIAN CRISIS
## NATO May Enter Into Controversy 
### 
TUNIS (/P) Tunisia demanded
yesterday the evacuation of all
French forces as the price of re
storing French-Tunisian friend
ship. The government under
scored its demand with a display
of increased hostility, including
firing on a French patrol boat
at Bizerte.
But the French showed no
signs of bowing to Tunisian de
mands.
In Paris the French were re
liably reported ready to seek to
have all French bases in Tunisia
brought directly under command
of the North Atlantic Treaty Al
liance. Then Bourguiba would
have to deal with the 15-nation
military force of the NATO alli
ance.
Although Tunisia is not a mem
ber of the alliance, she is friendly
to the West. She has received
both financial and military, aid
from NATO's biggest member
the United States.
In Washington, the State De
partment again expressed serious
concern over the five-day-old dip
lomatic crisis and volunteered to
"assist in every way we can."
In keeping with this goal,
American diplomats were report
ed urging the Tunisians to stop
short of demanding international
condomnation of France for the
bombing attack. Such a censure
move could be expected to bring
a bitter French reply, further set
ting hack prospects for direct dip
lomatic talks between the two
countries.
The State Department avoided
disclosing at a news conference
what the U.S. stand would be in
any UN consideration. Tunisia
has appealed for American back
ing.
