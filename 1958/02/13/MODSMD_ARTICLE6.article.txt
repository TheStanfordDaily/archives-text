# NO GROANING
## Ward Says World Not Fellowship 
### Dave Quarles 
A positive attitudr* of unity and
a mow approach were Hip methods
suggested by Barbara Ward in
her discussion of "The Unity of
the Free World" yesterday after
noon in Memorial Auditorium.
Miss Ward, noted British au
thor and economist, expressed her
belief that, although there is a
world-wide community of destruc
tion and aspiration, the world "re
mains more or less a jungle and
not a fellowship of human be
ings."
Basic Needs
"Fixed law, backed by inde
pendent judicial institutions that
prohibit all private vengeance,
and the opportunity for individ
uals to advance economically are
the two basic needs of a peaceful
world community," Miss Ward
said.
The free world has been sty
mied in the application of these
two principles to world problems
by its lack of conviction in the
efficacy of a unified, long-term
foreign policy.
As an example, Miss Ward said,
"many people in the free world
think the answer to present inter
national problems would tie the
disappearance of Khrushchev.
However, the solution is much
deeper than this."
Evolves Solution
Trying to evolve her own solu
tion. Miss Ward went straight to
the knotty problem of the dis
engagement of forces and the res
olution of the "brinkish" atmos
phere in Germany.
Her answer is the withdrawal
of all national troops and the sub
stitution of a small UN police
force which would serve as a trip
wire for permanent American and
British NATO commitments.
The obvious long-range exten
sion of this plan would be the
eventual dissolution of all nation
al forces everywhere and the es
tablishment of one international
armed force which would prohibit
"private vengeance of any one
country."
Difficult Step
Miss Ward acknowledged that
"this is a difficult step to make,
for our nationalistic feelings re
ject the idea, but our reason can
only accept it."
As for the second principle, the
economic "welfare principle," .she
believes a concentrated effort to
build a consistent overseas devel
opment program is essential.
"Instead of groaning every year
over economic aid," she said, "we
of the free world should lake joy
in seeing new lands being born,
knowing that by promoting the
'welfare principle' we are promot
ing a civilized world community."
Miss Ward concluded: "In the
long run, the free world will heal
Communism by having a better
and greater goal than simply rid
ding itself of Khrushchev. We
must work together to see that
this goal is achieved."

The obvious long-range exten
sion of this plan would be the
eventual dissolution of all nation
al forces everywhere and the es
tablishment of one international
armed force which would prohibit
"private vengeance of any one
country."
Difficult Step
Miss Ward acknowledged that
"this is a difficult step to make,
for our nationalistic feelings re
ject the idea, but our reason can
only accept it."
As for the second principle, the
economic "welfare principle," .she
believes a concentrated effort to
build a consistent overseas devel
opment program is essential.
"Instead of groaning every year
over economic aid," she said, "we
of the free world should lake joy
in seeing new lands being born,
knowing that by promoting the
'welfare principle' we are promot
ing a civilized world community."
Miss Ward concluded: "In the
long run, the free world will heal
Communism by having a better
and greater goal than simply rid
ding itself of Khrushchev. We
must work together to see that
this goal is achieved."
A positive attitudr* of unity and
a mow approach were Hip methods
suggested by Barbara Ward in
her discussion of "The Unity of
the Free World" yesterday after
noon in Memorial Auditorium.
Miss Ward, noted British au
thor and economist, expressed her
belief that, although there is a
world-wide community of destruc
tion and aspiration, the world "re
mains more or less a jungle and
not a fellowship of human be
ings."
Basic Needs
"Fixed law, backed by inde
pendent judicial institutions that
prohibit all private vengeance,
and the opportunity for individ
uals to advance economically are
the two basic needs of a peaceful
world community," Miss Ward
said.
The free world has been sty
mied in the application of these
two principles to world problems
by its lack of conviction in the
efficacy of a unified, long-term
foreign policy.
As an example, Miss Ward said,
"many people in the free world
think the answer to present inter
national problems would tie the
disappearance of Khrushchev.
However, the solution is much
deeper than this."
Evolves Solution
Trying to evolve her own solu
tion. Miss Ward went straight to
the knotty problem of the dis
engagement of forces and the res
olution of the "brinkish" atmos
phere in Germany.
Her answer is the withdrawal
of all national troops and the sub
stitution of a small UN police
force which would serve as a trip
wire for permanent American and
British NATO commitments.
