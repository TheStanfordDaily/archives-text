### Jinx Adams 
Walter Williams, U.S. Under
secretary of Comcmrcc and guest
speaker of the Political Union,
said last night that the United
States is in "some kind of reces
sion but it is not the severe kind
such as that of 1929-1932."
ile cited as the reasons for the
taperingoff process I lie cutting
down . of federal spending or
"budget fever," (he lightening of
credit, the curtailment of new
plant and factory construction
and the overstocked situation of
businesses as shown in recent in
ventories. He went on to say,
however, that these situations arc
steadily being relieved and that
he agreed with President • Eisen
hower's statement that we have
"strong reason to believe that
we're at the turning point."
He advised that Americans be
come aware of our system of
free enterprise and discharge
their responsibilities toward it.
He used as an example the natu
ral rhythms of our economy and
the panic that can result from an
uninformed public. He stated that
"You can't expect government to
redress the mistakes that hu
mans make."
The National Bureau of Eco
nomic Research has been making
a study of five recessions but no
other has been more carefully
charted than the present one.
''Just as people develop a person

ality after they arc old, so do re
cessions," lie said. By interpret
ing I he results of these studies
the government will be able to
hotter understand the habits of
recessions.
