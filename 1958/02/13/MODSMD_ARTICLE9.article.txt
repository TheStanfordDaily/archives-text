# Craig Tells New Stern Program
## 
### Leo Krulitz 
Dean of Men William G. Craig
outlined a new housing program
for Stern Hall and independent
men.
The program ealls for a divi
sion of Stern Hall into eight indi
vidual houses, each with its own
administration and its own dining
hall, effective next fall.
Names have been chosen for
the wings and they are. from
Wing I to VIII: Holladay, Fre
mont, Larkin, Lassen, Donner,
Serra, Muir and Burbank.
Dean Craig said, "The two new
wings now under construction
provide facilities for a faculty
resident. An additional faculty
resident will be appointed and
housed in the apartment present
ly occupied by the director.
"Mrs. Henderson, who is known
and loved by generations of Stern
men. will retire this year." Man
agcment of the hall will be han
dled under the new system by a
part-time director and the Resi
dent Advisers.
(Jap Narrows
Ho said the purpose of the far
ulty residents is to help foster a
better relationship between the

faculty community and the stu
dent community. It is hoped that
the gap that exists between the
two can be narrowed and that a
natural, informal relationship be
tween faculty and students will
result.
In regard to the individual din
ing halls for each house, Craig
said, "It is my understanding that
the students want it this way. If
this is the case, then it will go
into effect."
He added. "Individual dining
halls can make it possible for the
student to identify more closely
with a group if this is what he
wants. He wouldn't be restricted
to eating in his housels dining
hall, however, if he chose to eat
with friends in other houses in
Stern."
Off-Campus Men
Dean Craig also suggested that
students living off -campus atid
eating now at Stern might be
come "eating members" of the in
dividual houses. He ndded. "There
is value in this house system and
group living; individual dining
halls for each group can play an
important part in strengthening
j this program."
| He said the program will go

into effect autumn quarter and
added that the undergraduate
program in the Village would be
added at that time with the ex
ception of juniors and seniors
who might want to live there.
With the increasing size of
Stern, Dean Craig explained, the
house system is a way of break
ing student governing units into
manageable size and at the same
time it provides the members of
Stern with an opportunity to
identify with an individual house
organization of their own choos
ing.
Cites Advantages
'"Some of the advantages," he
went on, "are the following:
• An opportunity for members
of the faculty to have closer, in
formal association with students
in the dining rooms, lounges and
student rooms where the stu
dents' ideas will he quickened,
challenged and tested.
• An intellectual and friendly
atmosphere conducive to high
scholastic interest and achieve
ment.
• Stimulation of interest in
cultural activities by the devel
opment of house libraries, the In

treduction of art objects into res
donees and the encouragement of
good music.
• An environment conducive
to good citizenship, a varied so
cial program and an opportunity
for adequate recreation outlets.
• A place where tutoring is
available and academic advice is
given."
Select Neighbors
The program will also give the
student a chance to choose the
group with which he will asso
ciate. This is one of the main dif
ferences between this living sys
tem and the eating clubs and fra
ternities. Freshmen can visit
Stern at any time they wish.
Dean Craig concluded: "Most
students want to belong to a liv
ing group. To belong to a group
doesn't necessarily mean a sacri
fice of a person's individuality.
In any house system, the minor
ity should be protected from any
violation of individual freedoms.
The individual has a right to
make his own decisions in regard
to social fees, required attendance
and this sort of thing. On the
other hand, a person has respon
sibilities to any group with which
he affiliates."
