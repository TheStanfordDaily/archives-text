A petition for revision of Judi
cial Council procedures was pre
sented before Legislature last
night.
The petition was signed l>y 497
persons, 86 more than the re
quired 411 signatures for consid
eration, and Legislature referred
it to the Elections Committee for
checking of signatures.
Because of the University holi
day for Washington's Birthday
next week, Legislature will not
meet, but discussion of the pro
posal will take place Feb. 27, in
accordance with the 15-day re
quirement for consideration of
petitions.
Main Objection
Speaking in favor of the
changes, Robert Guild countered
the main objection — the social
pressure caused by a public trial
- by saying that Stanford stu
dents do not deserve to have an
honor code if they can't stand up
to pressure.
On the opposing side, Pat Do
herty, business school represen
tative, pointed out that the com
mittee to review Judicial Council
procedures found weaknesses
which were presented to the
Council and have been incorpor
ated in a revised system.
Doherty said that because of
the emotional nature of the issue
he would not like to see it
brought before the students as a
whole.
LASSU Choice
Legislature has the choice of
passing the changes asked in the
petition, or calling a student ref
erendum which, according to
President Jim Messinger, would
be held early in March.

voting the $177.62 to the Tresid
