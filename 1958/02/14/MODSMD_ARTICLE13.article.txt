# PREPARED FOR WAR
## Tunisians Want French to Leave 
### 
TUNIS (/P) President Habib Bourguiba declared yesterday, "We
are ready to make war for Bizerte." But he held open the door to
mediation by the United States of Tunisia's quarrel with France.
The president also suggested in a broadcast to his tense nation
that, while he is determined 15,000 French troops stationed in Tunisia

must go, the big French naval
base at Bizerte still might be used
by the North Atlantic Treaty
powers.
Garrisons Blocked
That base and French army gar
risons are blockaded. Jittery Tu
nisian civilians and national
guardsmen, patrolling with light
arms, manned road blocks to pre
vent the movement of French
troops. They threatened to fire
on any French ships attempting
to enter or leave Bizerte.
Bourguiba's blue eyes flashed
as he spoke on the crisis brought
on by a French air raid on the
frontier village of Sakiet Si d i
Youssef.
Tunisia put the toll at 68 men,
women and children killed, 84
wounded and 10 not accounted for.
Algerian Rebels
The French said the raid was
to punish Algerian rebels who had
fiied on French planes from their
border hideouts in Tunisia. But
several diplomats, including U.S.
ambassador G. Lewis Jones, are
reported to have confirmed that
there were heavy civilian casual
ties.
Using international reaction to
the bombing as a springboard,
Bourguiba has been trying once
again to force withdrawal of
French troops who remained in
the country when France recog
nized Tunisian independence near
ly two years ago.
"We are ready to go to war if
French ships force their way in
to or out of Bizerte," he declared
in his broadcast.
"Today I am President of the
republic, but. if it is necessary, I
would be the first to take to the
brush with the freedom fighters."
