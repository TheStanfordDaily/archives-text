# Satellite Charting Station Established at Stanford
## University Scientists Begin To Track Sputniks' Courses 
### 
University scientists are setting up a satellite research station to
chart paths of new Sputniks.
The station, which is located in a meadow near the athletic fields
just off Campus Drive, will be equipped with 20- and 40-megacycle
receivers and recorders.
The equipment will be used to gather data for the University's

studies of the ionosphere and up
per atmosphere. Although ready
to go into instant action, the sta
tion is not yet fully completed.
The project is sponsored by the
International Geophysical Year
Program with eight other sta
tions being readied throughout
the United States. Graduate stu
dents of the Radio Propagation
Laboratory will man the facili
ties under the direction of Pro
fessors O. G. Villard Jr., Ronald
N. Bracewell and Allen M. Peter
son.
Scientists Surprised
Sputniks I and II surprised sci
entists by transmitting signals
on the 20- and 40-megacycle fre
quencies. IGY tracking stations
were equipped to receive only the
agreed - upon 108 - megacycle sig
nals, like those from the U.S. sat
ellite "Explorer."
At Stanford, as elsewhere, ra
dio researchers dropped other
projects and feverishly scrounged
appropriate equipment to catch
the first Sputnik signals.
Emergency action enabled
them to plot orbits and gather
valuable scientific information
from the Russian satellites that
otherwise would have been lost.
The information is useful in re
search projects here and at other
laboratories, the Stanford group
said. But its collection under
present makeshift conditions has
been unnecessarily costly in time
and equipment.
To Talk Back
Yesterday the Associated Press
reported that America's second
satellite will be able to talk back
whenever its makers want it to.
It will carry a radio which will
receive signals to turn its high
power transmitter on and off at
will.
There will be, however, no ef
fort to keep information radioed
by the satellite from Russia or
from any other country.

reported that America's second
satellite will be able to talk back
whenever its makers want it to.
It will carry a radio which will
receive signals to turn its high
power transmitter on and off at
will.
There will be, however, no ef
fort to keep information radioed
by the satellite from Russia or
from any other country.
University scientists are setting up a satellite research station to
chart paths of new Sputniks.
The station, which is located in a meadow near the athletic fields
just off Campus Drive, will be equipped with 20- and 40-megacycle
receivers and recorders.
The equipment will be used to gather data for the University's

studies of the ionosphere and up
per atmosphere. Although ready
to go into instant action, the sta
tion is not yet fully completed.
The project is sponsored by the
International Geophysical Year
Program with eight other sta
tions being readied throughout
the United States. Graduate stu
dents of the Radio Propagation
Laboratory will man the facili
ties under the direction of Pro
fessors O. G. Villard Jr., Ronald
N. Bracewell and Allen M. Peter
son.
Scientists Surprised
Sputniks I and II surprised sci
entists by transmitting signals
on the 20- and 40-megacycle fre
quencies. IGY tracking stations
were equipped to receive only the
agreed - upon 108 - megacycle sig
nals, like those from the U.S. sat
ellite "Explorer."
At Stanford, as elsewhere, ra
dio researchers dropped other
projects and feverishly scrounged
appropriate equipment to catch
the first Sputnik signals.
Emergency action enabled
them to plot orbits and gather
valuable scientific information
from the Russian satellites that
otherwise would have been lost.
The information is useful in re
search projects here and at other
laboratories, the Stanford group
said. But its collection under
present makeshift conditions has
been unnecessarily costly in time
and equipment.
To Talk Back
Yesterday the Associated Press
reported that America's second
satellite will be able to talk back
whenever its makers want it to.
It will carry a radio which will
receive signals to turn its high
power transmitter on and off at
will.
There will be, however, no ef
fort to keep information radioed
by the satellite from Russia or
from any other country.
