Rushing at Stern
Editor, The Daily:
Only a million years ago the arduous rour.se of
evolution was electrified by the birth of a new
and wonderful animal. This creature was en
dowed with the fearful capacity to acquire knowl
edge and to become an individual. Stanford Uni
versity. founded some years later, was established
to accommodate this animal and to encourage his
fearful propensities. Yet there are some among
us today who would deny the very basis of our
existence; they would seek to Immerse our indi
vidualities in a bloody pool of conformity and
group "spirit," detouring us from our natural
goals.
Last week one man stood against the crowd,
attempting to deny the thesis that personality is
a mere fluctuation in human behavior. He is
Charles Haworth. He was outvoted, 5 to 1, by
Stern Council on this issue. He opposed turning
Stern Hall into a collection ol' eight amorphous
fraternity houses (hitherto known as "wings").
The issue was simple. In a few weeks Stern is
supposed to have open houses for freshmen; a
handbook is to be distributed to these freshmen
propagandizing some sort of vague Gung-ho
character of each wing of Stern. Presumably,
new residents of Stern could pick their wing,
blend their individualities with a monolithic mass
of floormates and wingmates, making psychologi
cal "adjustment" as painless as possible. It is
•said that absurdity knows no bounds; in this in
stance it is true.
Next year a no-contact rule may apply to Slern
men; we may possibly have special amulets 1o
bestow upon our beauteous fiancees ("pinning,"
so-called); ultragregarious men from ramshackle
fraternity houses will change their residences to
Slern to enjoy more modern living conditions.
Thus, rushing at Stern appears a mockery. In
opposition to this nonsense, we hereby affix our
signatures.

Frosh Environment 4 Unnatural 9
Editor, The Daily:
I was surprised that one of the freshmen polled
in yesterday's column on rushing ["Campus Opin
ion"] felt that sponsors saved freshmen from
feeling segregated from upperclassmen.
I know myself well enough to realize that if I
were a sponsor 1 would have a patronizing atti
tude toward my charges. I would feel responsible,
not just for their well-being, but for their healthy
adjustment. Consequently, I would talk little of
my life as an upperclassman; rather, my efforts
to make my corridor happy would consist of sac
charine assurances that their group was having
the most fun, was the closest friends and there
fore should not feel thai their first college year
lacked anything. I probably would not hate my
self for this behavior, since there is a certain
dignity in knowing that the dean's office con
siders you indispensable.
Fmshman year is not a bridge between high
school and college. It is college. When someone
applies for college he expects to act as an adult.
Once there, if he is treated as an adult by his pro
fessors, as in the independent Civ sections, he will

respond to the new demands well and feel proud
of it. Is a freshman treated as an adult in the
freshman dorms? Or is he coddled into retaining
high school attitudes and made to feel that this
is the normal process in college?
Upperclassmen are perhaps hesitant to live in
a house that is two-thirds freshmen, or to room
with one. Although their fears are probably
based on how freshmen are led to act in Roble,
Branner, or Wilbur, they are real fears and must
be taken into account when integrated housing
is discussed.
Also, freshmen DO have special problems, since
the work is hard even coming from a good school,
and one's first exams are steps into the unknown.
But there is a solution to these difficulties.
What I propose is an experiment to take some
of the unnaturalness out of the freshman year.
The measures are based on using existing facili
ties and on devices already in existence on a small
scale.
Summer quarter freshmen live in Lagunita
with upperclassmen, but are together in one easa
unit. Stanford has four such subdivided dormi
tories— Stern, Wilbur, Lagunita and Florence
Moore. In such dorms, houses of freshmen could
be sandwiched between those of mixed upper
classmen. In those with a common dining room,
freshmen could meet upperclassmen at meals.
A by-product of the system would be this: Sur
rounded by nonchalant seniors, freshmen would
be less inclined to mass hysteria at exam time,
and those who wanted to could study in peace.
Sponsors could still be used, or else what is
called the "big sister" ("big sibling?") approach,
as is in effect in Union this quarter. The latter
would have three advantages: [First,] the fresh
man would get a welcoming letter before she
arrived from an individual whom she would know
was interested in her, as well as impersonal
forms; this is lacking in the present setup. [Sec
ond.] big sisters would be chosen from the neigh
boring casa of the dorm so that, collectively, the
freshmen would know many upperclassmen and
their friends in their own environment. Third,
the burden put upon each person chosen to help
freshmen would be less; and many people who
choose not to try out for sponsoring, but who are
interested in helping, will not feel that to partici
pate i;; to push one's life out of shape for two
quarters. The sponsor' system is formidably
strange to the sponsor as well as the freshman.
Not only are there all the new faces to learn in a
freshman dorm, but one $.uist get used to t heir
acting young and to one's role of being responsi
ble for- such a large number' of people.
It would be easy to try out these proposals next
year in one dorm say, Lagunita—and then judge,
on the basis of fact, whether or not there were
features of it which could be used in improving
the pr esent situation. I hope it can be considered.

Real Atneriean Music
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that a good way to celebrate
George Washington's birthday (Feb. 22) is to go
to hear- some real American music. Most people
get tired of juke boxes and radio, and some come
to the conclusion that Americans just aren't mu
sical. All these doubting Thomases ought 1o go
to the folk music concert at the Palo Alto Com
munity Center on Washington's Birthday (8:30
in the evening). They will hear what you rarely
can hear on the radio — songs of our country,
played and sung well.
