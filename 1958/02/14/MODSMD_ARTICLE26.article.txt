# ONLY THE BEST
## Faculty Is Hand-Picked 
### Steve Freidberg 
Most Stanford students realize
the high standards used to select
members of the student body, but
few of them know about the care
ful and rigorous means of mak
ing faculty appointments.
Stanford spends much time and
money to assure that its faculty
will continue to be of high quality
and that the University will up
hold the good academic reputa
tion it has all over the country.
The search for members of the
teaching staff is usually conduct
ed at the departmental level. A
dean, knowing the needs of his
department and the funds which
are available, makes a survey of
possible applicants. This survey
is usually carried on in two dif
ferent ways, depending on the
importance of the position to be
filled.
Junior Faculty
In case a junior faculty mem
ber such as an instructor is need
ed, the dean writes to graduate
schools which are particularly
good in the required field and
gets information about young
men in the school who might be
suitable.
In addition, there are several
men from Stanford who spend
much time traveling around the
country and interviewing pros
pective candidates. From these
two sources, the dean will, often
after consultation with a commit
tee in his department, make his
selection.
If a senior member .such as an
associate or full professor is de
sired, the methods are somewhat
different. The head of a depart
ment is constantly in contact
with the heads of similar depart
ments in top-notch schools all
over the country.
Selection
He knows about men who have
distinguished themselves in the
field, having met them at confer
ences, read about some of their
work, or 1 obtained opinions about
them from informed sources.
Also, he may select a man in his
department to be promoted to fill
the position. Again, the dean usu
ally confers with other profes
sors in his department before
making the final choice.
After' he has decided, he dis
cusses his selection with one or
more members of (he Advisory
Board. The Advisory Board is
composed of seven professors, one
from each of the departmental

groups, and must review recom
mendations for all appointments,
promotions and dismissals, along
with other executive acts of gen
eral importance. The dean is care
fully questioned about the qualifi
cations of his selection and is also
asked who else was considered
for the opening.
The entire Advisory Board then
makes its recommendation, which
is forwarded to the President for
approval or disapproval. If he en
dorses the decision, it is sent to
the Board of Trustees, which must
give final approval of the appoint
ment.
Department Committee
A slightly different procedure
is used if an extremely important
position such as the head of a de
partment is being filled. A com
mittee composed of professors in
the department and from other
departments in the University will
review the candidates. Occasion
ally, as was the case in the selec
tion of the Medical School dean,
men from outside the University
are asked to sit on the committee.
Candidates are brought to Stan
ford to be interviewed, and the
committee spends many hours re
viewing their qualifications. Its
recommendation is sent to the
Advisory Board and then follows
the same procedure as for other
appointments.
Qualifications
In choosing faculty members,
many things are taken into con
sideration. There is no well-de
fined list of qualifications a can
didate must have, but his ability
is regarded in respect to the posi
tion to be filled.
A younger man is judged by
his achievements in college and
graduate school and by recom
mendations of his professors. An

■ older man is considered in light
of his proven leaching capability
and past achievements in re
search and writing. Such things
as altitude toward students and
ability to work with other faculty
members along with emotional
j stability and family relationships
are also included in making the
.selection.
Competition among universi
ties for outstanding faculty is
very great as a result of the in
creasing need for more and bet
ter teachers. It has become a
problem of most universities, in
cluding Stanford, to find enough
good teachers to keep up academ
ic standards.

tion of the Medical School dean,
men from outside the University
are asked to sit on the committee.
Candidates are brought to Stan
ford to be interviewed, and the
committee spends many hours re
viewing their qualifications. Its
recommendation is sent to the
Advisory Board and then follows
the same procedure as for other
appointments.
Qualifications
In choosing faculty members,
many things are taken into con
sideration. There is no well-de
fined list of qualifications a can
didate must have, but his ability
is regarded in respect to the posi
tion to be filled.
A younger man is judged by
his achievements in college and
graduate school and by recom
mendations of his professors. An

■ older man is considered in light
of his proven leaching capability
and past achievements in re
search and writing. Such things
as altitude toward students and
ability to work with other faculty
members along with emotional
j stability and family relationships
are also included in making the
.selection.
Competition among universi
ties for outstanding faculty is
very great as a result of the in
creasing need for more and bet
ter teachers. It has become a
problem of most universities, in
cluding Stanford, to find enough
good teachers to keep up academ
ic standards.
Most Stanford students realize
the high standards used to select
members of the student body, but
few of them know about the care
ful and rigorous means of mak
ing faculty appointments.
Stanford spends much time and
money to assure that its faculty
will continue to be of high quality
and that the University will up
hold the good academic reputa
tion it has all over the country.
The search for members of the
teaching staff is usually conduct
ed at the departmental level. A
dean, knowing the needs of his
department and the funds which
are available, makes a survey of
possible applicants. This survey
is usually carried on in two dif
ferent ways, depending on the
importance of the position to be
filled.
Junior Faculty
In case a junior faculty mem
ber such as an instructor is need
ed, the dean writes to graduate
schools which are particularly
good in the required field and
gets information about young
men in the school who might be
suitable.
In addition, there are several
men from Stanford who spend
much time traveling around the
country and interviewing pros
pective candidates. From these
two sources, the dean will, often
after consultation with a commit
tee in his department, make his
selection.
If a senior member .such as an
associate or full professor is de
sired, the methods are somewhat
different. The head of a depart
ment is constantly in contact
with the heads of similar depart
ments in top-notch schools all
over the country.
Selection
He knows about men who have
distinguished themselves in the
field, having met them at confer
ences, read about some of their
work, or 1 obtained opinions about
them from informed sources.
Also, he may select a man in his
department to be promoted to fill
the position. Again, the dean usu
ally confers with other profes
sors in his department before
making the final choice.
After' he has decided, he dis
cusses his selection with one or
more members of (he Advisory
Board. The Advisory Board is
composed of seven professors, one
from each of the departmental

groups, and must review recom
mendations for all appointments,
promotions and dismissals, along
with other executive acts of gen
eral importance. The dean is care
fully questioned about the qualifi
cations of his selection and is also
asked who else was considered
for the opening.
The entire Advisory Board then
makes its recommendation, which
is forwarded to the President for
approval or disapproval. If he en
dorses the decision, it is sent to
the Board of Trustees, which must
give final approval of the appoint
ment.
Department Committee
A slightly different procedure
is used if an extremely important
position such as the head of a de
partment is being filled. A com
mittee composed of professors in
the department and from other
departments in the University will
review the candidates. Occasion

Also, he may select a man in his
department to be promoted to fill
the position. Again, the dean usu
ally confers with other profes
sors in his department before
making the final choice.
After' he has decided, he dis
cusses his selection with one or
more members of (he Advisory
Board. The Advisory Board is
composed of seven professors, one
from each of the departmental

groups, and must review recom
mendations for all appointments,
promotions and dismissals, along
with other executive acts of gen
eral importance. The dean is care
fully questioned about the qualifi
cations of his selection and is also
asked who else was considered
for the opening.
The entire Advisory Board then
makes its recommendation, which
is forwarded to the President for
approval or disapproval. If he en
dorses the decision, it is sent to
the Board of Trustees, which must
give final approval of the appoint
ment.
Department Committee
A slightly different procedure
is used if an extremely important
position such as the head of a de
partment is being filled. A com
mittee composed of professors in
the department and from other
departments in the University will
review the candidates. Occasion
ally, as was the case in the selec
tion of the Medical School dean,
men from outside the University
are asked to sit on the committee.
Candidates are brought to Stan
ford to be interviewed, and the
committee spends many hours re
viewing their qualifications. Its
recommendation is sent to the
Advisory Board and then follows
the same procedure as for other
appointments.
Qualifications
In choosing faculty members,
many things are taken into con
sideration. There is no well-de
fined list of qualifications a can
didate must have, but his ability
is regarded in respect to the posi
tion to be filled.
A younger man is judged by
his achievements in college and
graduate school and by recom
mendations of his professors. An

■ older man is considered in light
of his proven leaching capability
and past achievements in re
search and writing. Such things
as altitude toward students and
ability to work with other faculty
members along with emotional
j stability and family relationships
are also included in making the
.selection.
Competition among universi
ties for outstanding faculty is
very great as a result of the in
creasing need for more and bet
ter teachers. It has become a
problem of most universities, in
cluding Stanford, to find enough
good teachers to keep up academ
ic standards.
Most Stanford students realize
the high standards used to select
members of the student body, but
few of them know about the care
ful and rigorous means of mak
ing faculty appointments.
Stanford spends much time and
money to assure that its faculty
will continue to be of high quality
and that the University will up
hold the good academic reputa
tion it has all over the country.
The search for members of the
teaching staff is usually conduct
ed at the departmental level. A
dean, knowing the needs of his
department and the funds which
are available, makes a survey of
possible applicants. This survey
is usually carried on in two dif
ferent ways, depending on the
importance of the position to be
filled.
Junior Faculty
In case a junior faculty mem
ber such as an instructor is need
ed, the dean writes to graduate
schools which are particularly
good in the required field and
gets information about young
men in the school who might be
suitable.
In addition, there are several
men from Stanford who spend
much time traveling around the
country and interviewing pros
pective candidates. From these
two sources, the dean will, often
after consultation with a commit
tee in his department, make his
selection.
If a senior member .such as an
associate or full professor is de
sired, the methods are somewhat
different. The head of a depart
ment is constantly in contact
with the heads of similar depart
ments in top-notch schools all
over the country.
Selection
He knows about men who have
distinguished themselves in the
field, having met them at confer
ences, read about some of their
work, or 1 obtained opinions about
them from informed sources.
Also, he may select a man in his
department to be promoted to fill
the position. Again, the dean usu
ally confers with other profes
sors in his department before
making the final choice.
After' he has decided, he dis
cusses his selection with one or
