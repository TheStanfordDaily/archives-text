# THE 						Finish Line
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Assistant from Pro Ranks?
Only a few more days (6) to go before we'll know for sure and
for certain who the new football assistants are going to be. That's
when the Board of Trustees will give final approval to the choices
as submitted by head coach .lack Curtice.
The latest scuttlebutt says that Wayne Hansen, a veteran of
eight years of linebacking with the Chicago Bears, will come to
Stanford to be Curtice's' defensive specialist. Hansen, now 29, went
to the Bears after playing for Curtice when the pair was at Texas
Western,
From all indications, the only other newcomer will be ihe present
lltali freshman coach, Andy Everest. Everest was believed to have
boon Curtice's personal choice to succeed him at Utah, and almost
had the job. But then University officials decided to slow down and
look around a bit. They came up with UCLA assistant Kay Nagel,
leaving Everest by the wayside. So, he'll come with Curtice.
When Curtice was first hired, it looked as though only two of
the present staff would remain. Now, however 1 , Curtice will probably
have the services of four Herm Meister, Bob Ghiiotti, Fete Kmeto
vie and Dutch Fehring.
Fehring may be only a part-time assistant, and possibly a fre
quent scout of other teams, but he'll still be here as head baseball
coach, of course.
The only question of .jurisdiction now remaining seems to be
whether Everest or Ghiiotti will handle the Papooses.
If the two assistants from the outside are both here by March 1,
the date Curtice will begin work, that will leave him about a month
and a half to lay plans for spring practice. The drills will end May
24, with the starting date backed up 20 working days from then.
One fairly sure thing is that a good amount of the 20 days of
workouts will be spent on reaction drills. Curtice much prefers
speed and agility over si/e, and wants to bring out those points as
much as possible.
One advantage he'll have over most new coaches is that his play
ers will already lie familiar with his system. Basically, his spread-T
is the same as Chuck Taylor's, with only a few minor differences
that shouldn't be. difficult to teach.
Curtice's "philosophy" of an offense is certainly simple—"You
have to be in a position for a run or pass on every play; not like the
split-T where it's virtually all running."
Better the Standards, Or
Payton Jordan, who's working hard to get his track and field men
up with the rest of the West, isn't going to be bothered carrying a
bunch of dead wood that won't do the squad any good.
He's set up an equitable series of standards which will determine
who stays on the team and who turns in his gear. The feeling is that
there have been too many men who are content to be second- or third
best in their event with a lousy mark, yet expect to share in all the
glory.
The marks are by no means difficult—not for an athlete who
figures to do anything when the going gets tough. Still, unless a
few individuals shape up, the Stanford representation in a few events
is going to be pretty slim.
Sprinters will be expected to hit 10.3 and 22.8; one- and two-lap
men must equal or better 51.0 and 1:58; distance runners should
hit 4:30 and 9:55; and hurdlers will have to get down to 15.5 and
21.8.
In Ihe field, it'll be 5-11 in the high jump, 12-6 in the pole vault.
23 feet in the broad jump, and 190, 140 and 47 in the weights. Cer
tainly there's nothing superhuman here—a respectable high schooler
wouldn't have any trouble bettering those marks in his event.
Nonetheless, there might be a lot of uniforms turned in for good
after the next intra-squad meet on Feb. 22.

ONE MORE PROBLEM When most fans think of the problems
Stanford has in getting top athletes, the difficulties mentioned are
the high tuition, the good grades one needs to get in, and the fact
that there isn't a free ride policy as there is at most schools.
One more problem reared its head last week freshmen can enter
only in autumn quarter. At most schools, first-year students can
begin at the semester break, but here the entire frosh class starts
together.
I'm definitely in favor of the system as it works at Stanford, but
I'm a little disappointed that we lost Dennis Shay because of it.
Shay was All-City quarterback at Poly High in S.F. last fall, and
rated one of the city's best QB's ever. He was apparently sewed up
for Stanford, and even had a talk with Jack Curtice when the latter
was here a couple of weeks ago.
But Shay graduated in mid-year, and all of a sudden started won
dering what he'd do with himself between now and September. Well
he found himself something to do between now and June, at any
rate he's going to Cal.

One advantage he'll have over most new coaches is that his play
ers will already lie familiar with his system. Basically, his spread-T
is the same as Chuck Taylor's, with only a few minor differences
that shouldn't be. difficult to teach.
Curtice's "philosophy" of an offense is certainly simple—"You
have to be in a position for a run or pass on every play; not like the
split-T where it's virtually all running."
Better the Standards, Or
Payton Jordan, who's working hard to get his track and field men
up with the rest of the West, isn't going to be bothered carrying a
bunch of dead wood that won't do the squad any good.
He's set up an equitable series of standards which will determine
who stays on the team and who turns in his gear. The feeling is that
there have been too many men who are content to be second- or third
best in their event with a lousy mark, yet expect to share in all the
glory.
The marks are by no means difficult—not for an athlete who
figures to do anything when the going gets tough. Still, unless a
few individuals shape up, the Stanford representation in a few events
is going to be pretty slim.
Sprinters will be expected to hit 10.3 and 22.8; one- and two-lap
men must equal or better 51.0 and 1:58; distance runners should
hit 4:30 and 9:55; and hurdlers will have to get down to 15.5 and
21.8.
In Ihe field, it'll be 5-11 in the high jump, 12-6 in the pole vault.
23 feet in the broad jump, and 190, 140 and 47 in the weights. Cer
tainly there's nothing superhuman here—a respectable high schooler
wouldn't have any trouble bettering those marks in his event.
Nonetheless, there might be a lot of uniforms turned in for good
after the next intra-squad meet on Feb. 22.

ONE MORE PROBLEM When most fans think of the problems
Stanford has in getting top athletes, the difficulties mentioned are
the high tuition, the good grades one needs to get in, and the fact
that there isn't a free ride policy as there is at most schools.
One more problem reared its head last week freshmen can enter
only in autumn quarter. At most schools, first-year students can
begin at the semester break, but here the entire frosh class starts
together.
I'm definitely in favor of the system as it works at Stanford, but
I'm a little disappointed that we lost Dennis Shay because of it.
Shay was All-City quarterback at Poly High in S.F. last fall, and
rated one of the city's best QB's ever. He was apparently sewed up
for Stanford, and even had a talk with Jack Curtice when the latter
was here a couple of weeks ago.
But Shay graduated in mid-year, and all of a sudden started won
dering what he'd do with himself between now and September. Well
he found himself something to do between now and June, at any
rate he's going to Cal.

Assistant from Pro Ranks?
Only a few more days (6) to go before we'll know for sure and
for certain who the new football assistants are going to be. That's
when the Board of Trustees will give final approval to the choices
as submitted by head coach .lack Curtice.
The latest scuttlebutt says that Wayne Hansen, a veteran of
eight years of linebacking with the Chicago Bears, will come to
Stanford to be Curtice's' defensive specialist. Hansen, now 29, went
to the Bears after playing for Curtice when the pair was at Texas
Western,
From all indications, the only other newcomer will be ihe present
lltali freshman coach, Andy Everest. Everest was believed to have
boon Curtice's personal choice to succeed him at Utah, and almost
had the job. But then University officials decided to slow down and
look around a bit. They came up with UCLA assistant Kay Nagel,
leaving Everest by the wayside. So, he'll come with Curtice.
When Curtice was first hired, it looked as though only two of
the present staff would remain. Now, however 1 , Curtice will probably
have the services of four Herm Meister, Bob Ghiiotti, Fete Kmeto
vie and Dutch Fehring.
Fehring may be only a part-time assistant, and possibly a fre
quent scout of other teams, but he'll still be here as head baseball
coach, of course.
The only question of .jurisdiction now remaining seems to be
whether Everest or Ghiiotti will handle the Papooses.
If the two assistants from the outside are both here by March 1,
the date Curtice will begin work, that will leave him about a month
and a half to lay plans for spring practice. The drills will end May
24, with the starting date backed up 20 working days from then.
One fairly sure thing is that a good amount of the 20 days of
workouts will be spent on reaction drills. Curtice much prefers
speed and agility over si/e, and wants to bring out those points as
much as possible.

ONE MORE PROBLEM When most fans think of the problems
Stanford has in getting top athletes, the difficulties mentioned are
the high tuition, the good grades one needs to get in, and the fact
that there isn't a free ride policy as there is at most schools.
One more problem reared its head last week freshmen can enter
only in autumn quarter. At most schools, first-year students can
begin at the semester break, but here the entire frosh class starts
together.
I'm definitely in favor of the system as it works at Stanford, but
I'm a little disappointed that we lost Dennis Shay because of it.
Shay was All-City quarterback at Poly High in S.F. last fall, and
rated one of the city's best QB's ever. He was apparently sewed up
for Stanford, and even had a talk with Jack Curtice when the latter
was here a couple of weeks ago.
But Shay graduated in mid-year, and all of a sudden started won
dering what he'd do with himself between now and September. Well
he found himself something to do between now and June, at any
rate he's going to Cal.

Assistant from Pro Ranks?
Only a few more days (6) to go before we'll know for sure and
for certain who the new football assistants are going to be. That's
when the Board of Trustees will give final approval to the choices
as submitted by head coach .lack Curtice.
The latest scuttlebutt says that Wayne Hansen, a veteran of
eight years of linebacking with the Chicago Bears, will come to
Stanford to be Curtice's' defensive specialist. Hansen, now 29, went
to the Bears after playing for Curtice when the pair was at Texas
Western,
From all indications, the only other newcomer will be ihe present
lltali freshman coach, Andy Everest. Everest was believed to have
boon Curtice's personal choice to succeed him at Utah, and almost
had the job. But then University officials decided to slow down and
look around a bit. They came up with UCLA assistant Kay Nagel,
leaving Everest by the wayside. So, he'll come with Curtice.
When Curtice was first hired, it looked as though only two of
the present staff would remain. Now, however 1 , Curtice will probably
have the services of four Herm Meister, Bob Ghiiotti, Fete Kmeto
vie and Dutch Fehring.
Fehring may be only a part-time assistant, and possibly a fre
quent scout of other teams, but he'll still be here as head baseball
coach, of course.
The only question of .jurisdiction now remaining seems to be
whether Everest or Ghiiotti will handle the Papooses.
If the two assistants from the outside are both here by March 1,
the date Curtice will begin work, that will leave him about a month
and a half to lay plans for spring practice. The drills will end May
24, with the starting date backed up 20 working days from then.
One fairly sure thing is that a good amount of the 20 days of
workouts will be spent on reaction drills. Curtice much prefers
speed and agility over si/e, and wants to bring out those points as
much as possible.
One advantage he'll have over most new coaches is that his play
ers will already lie familiar with his system. Basically, his spread-T
is the same as Chuck Taylor's, with only a few minor differences
that shouldn't be. difficult to teach.
Curtice's "philosophy" of an offense is certainly simple—"You
have to be in a position for a run or pass on every play; not like the
split-T where it's virtually all running."
Better the Standards, Or
Payton Jordan, who's working hard to get his track and field men
up with the rest of the West, isn't going to be bothered carrying a
bunch of dead wood that won't do the squad any good.
He's set up an equitable series of standards which will determine
who stays on the team and who turns in his gear. The feeling is that
there have been too many men who are content to be second- or third
best in their event with a lousy mark, yet expect to share in all the
glory.
The marks are by no means difficult—not for an athlete who
figures to do anything when the going gets tough. Still, unless a
few individuals shape up, the Stanford representation in a few events
is going to be pretty slim.
Sprinters will be expected to hit 10.3 and 22.8; one- and two-lap
men must equal or better 51.0 and 1:58; distance runners should
hit 4:30 and 9:55; and hurdlers will have to get down to 15.5 and
21.8.
In Ihe field, it'll be 5-11 in the high jump, 12-6 in the pole vault.
23 feet in the broad jump, and 190, 140 and 47 in the weights. Cer
tainly there's nothing superhuman here—a respectable high schooler
wouldn't have any trouble bettering those marks in his event.
Nonetheless, there might be a lot of uniforms turned in for good
after the next intra-squad meet on Feb. 22.
