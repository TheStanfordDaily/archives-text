Did you ever try to dance a polka or a ma mho
in wooden shoes? Well, this Saturday American
and foreign students will be doing just that
when the ASSU foreign scholars present "Dutch
Day" at the International Center. All students
have been invited to the festivities, which will
attempt to recapture the spirit of old Holland,

beginning at 8 p.m. Wooden shoes will be pro
vided, according to Dutch students' Evert Beers
and John Veltman. The two are shown above
displaying the rows of wooden shoes which are
kept outside on the stairs in a traditional Dutch
home.
