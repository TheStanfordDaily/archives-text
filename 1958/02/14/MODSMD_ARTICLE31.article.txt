# Cards Host Red-Hot SC Cagers
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Left willi littlo besides the spoiler role to play, the Stanford Indians will return to the local courts
tonight at 8 when they tangle with red-hot Southern California.,
The Cards return to the Pavilion after a 21-day absence, during which they ran their eighth-place
Pacific Coast Conference record to 2-7.
The Trojans, meanwhile, have climbed right back into title contention. Their solid 58-18 victory
over California last Friday gave Iho Trojans a big lift after they had lost a pair of last-minute decisions

to UCLA in their previous series.
Forrest Twogood's club finds
itself just a half-game out of first
place with a 6-3 record. Califor
nia and UCLA are tied for the top
spot with 6-2 marks.
If Stanford is to win, they'll
have to play a ball control game
and go for the sure shot. With
big Jim Hanna leading the re
bound parade, the Cards don't
figure to exercise much back
board control against the invad
ers.
It Can Work
That Howie Dallmar can suc
cessfully work a wait-for-the-shot
offense has been demonstrated
on two occasions this year when
Stanford beat USF, 50-49, and
when they topped Oregon State,
G9-57.
Dallmar is expected to go with
the same line-up that beat Ore
gon State and started against
Oregon in the most recent Stan
ford series.
Haga to Center
That would put Jerry Thuesen
and John Arrillaga at forwards,
Dick Haga at center, and Doug
Warren and captain Paul Neu
mann at guards.
The sixth man on the Stanford
squad, Mike Tipton, is a very
doubtful participant tonight. He
sprained his ankle against Wash

! ington two weeks ago, then rein
! jured it in a workout Monday.
Tipton, however, will suit up
for the game and see how his
ankle behaves in the pre-game
warm-ups. If it's OK, he'll be
available for use. If not, he'll
wait and see how it is for the
game against California Monday.
Three in Twin Figures
The Stanford scoring punch is
j expected to come from the three
| Cards who are averaging in
double figures Haga, Arrillaga
and Neumann. Haga, the PCC's
leading percentage shooter from
the floor, has scored an even 100
points for an 11.1 average, while
Arrillaga and Neumann are hit
ting at 10.8 and 10.6 respectively.
USC also has three men in the
two-digit range Jim Pugh, Jim
Hanna and Monte Gonzales- and
like Stanford's trio, they're all
pretty close to ihe 11-point mark.
Both clubs will also meet Cali
fornia over the four - day PCC

weekend. USC will go to Berke
ley tomorrow night, and then the
Bears will come here Monday.
