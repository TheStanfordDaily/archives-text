### 
Dr. Leonard I. Schiff, professor'
of physics, will appear before the
research subcommittee of the
Joint Committee on Atomic En
ergy today in Washington, D.C.,
to describe Stanford's plan for - a
two-mile-long atom smasher.
The University is seeking fed
oral funds to support the project.
The plan calls building the
new accelerator between the Stan
ford golf course and a point
south of the quarry on Page Mill
Road. The machine will be ca
pable of whipping electrons to en
ergies of from 2.) to 43 billion
electron volts.
