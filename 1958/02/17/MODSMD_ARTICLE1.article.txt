# Mrs. Roosevelt Urges U.S. 'Wake Up and Go to Work'
## 
### Dave Quarles 
"We are going to have to learn
to live together [with the Commu
nists]; and, whether we like it or
not, we had better get busy."
Mr*. Eleanor Roosevelt, in her
discussion of "Russia—the Coun
try and the People as I Saw
Them," Friday afternoon in Me
morial Auditorium, emphasized
that, as Russia is the showcase for
what compulsion can accomplish,
so the United States must be a
betler showcase for what freedom
can achieve.
"We must let the undecided
countries see in the showcase of
freedom that life really is happier
than under Communism," Mrs.
Roosevelt said.
Take Step
One of I he most important steps
toward this goal is showing equal
interest in all of our citizens, re
gardless of color, race and creed,
she said. "This is most important
when one realizes that at least
two-thirds of the world population
have colored skin."
In answer to a question after
her lecture, Mrs. Roosevelt said
she saw absolutely no racial dis
crimination while in Russia.
One must reali/.e what life was
like in czarist Russia, Mrs. Roose
velt pointed out. The masses lived
in huts and tilled someone else's
land. There was absolutely no
freedom and little economic secu
rity. The country was only 10 per
cent literate.
"There is no more freedom to
day than there was under the
czars," she said. "But it is hard to
find 10 per cent who arc illiterate.
There i« a certain amount of eco
nomic security for everyone, and
many own a little bit of land.
"Two wars have set Russia
back, but. in spite of difficulties,
she has become industrialized and
the second strongest nation in the
world—her people are proud of
these accomplishments."
Educational Strides
Some of Russia's greatest
strides have been made in educa
tion, Mrs. Roosevelt explained.
Under the Russian system, in his
seventh year a child takes tests
for ability, aptitude and under
standing of basic Marxism.
"If he passes the test, he is al
lowed to go on to higher educa
tion," she said. "If the family
cannot afford to continue the
child's education, the state pays
for it."
Scientists and engineers get
higher living allowances and pos
sess the added security that any
thing they discover will serve
Communist purposes.
Useful Propaganda
All college-age students speak
fluently at least two other lan
guages besides their own. "This is
extremely useful for propaganda
purposes, because it is very flat
tering for a foreigner to speak
your language."
Mrs. Roosevelt concluded by
saying her only fear was that our
lack of knowledge and understand
ing which has caused apathy in
the past would continue.
"As leaders of the free world,
we have to care what happens to
other peoples, or Communism will
continue to chew off little bites.
We must summon the vision, cour
age and imagination to wake up
now and go to work."

morial Auditorium, emphasized
that, as Russia is the showcase for
what compulsion can accomplish,
so the United States must be a
betler showcase for what freedom
can achieve.
"We must let the undecided
countries see in the showcase of
freedom that life really is happier
than under Communism," Mrs.
Roosevelt said.
Take Step
One of I he most important steps
toward this goal is showing equal
interest in all of our citizens, re
gardless of color, race and creed,
she said. "This is most important
when one realizes that at least
two-thirds of the world population
have colored skin."
In answer to a question after
her lecture, Mrs. Roosevelt said
she saw absolutely no racial dis
crimination while in Russia.
One must reali/.e what life was
like in czarist Russia, Mrs. Roose
velt pointed out. The masses lived
in huts and tilled someone else's
land. There was absolutely no
freedom and little economic secu
rity. The country was only 10 per
cent literate.
"There is no more freedom to
day than there was under the
czars," she said. "But it is hard to
find 10 per cent who arc illiterate.
There i« a certain amount of eco
nomic security for everyone, and
many own a little bit of land.
"Two wars have set Russia
back, but. in spite of difficulties,
she has become industrialized and
the second strongest nation in the
world—her people are proud of
these accomplishments."
Educational Strides
Some of Russia's greatest
strides have been made in educa
tion, Mrs. Roosevelt explained.
Under the Russian system, in his
seventh year a child takes tests
for ability, aptitude and under
standing of basic Marxism.
"If he passes the test, he is al
lowed to go on to higher educa
tion," she said. "If the family
cannot afford to continue the
child's education, the state pays
for it."
Scientists and engineers get
higher living allowances and pos
sess the added security that any
thing they discover will serve
Communist purposes.
Useful Propaganda
All college-age students speak
fluently at least two other lan
guages besides their own. "This is
extremely useful for propaganda
purposes, because it is very flat
tering for a foreigner to speak
your language."
Mrs. Roosevelt concluded by
saying her only fear was that our
lack of knowledge and understand
ing which has caused apathy in
the past would continue.
"As leaders of the free world,
we have to care what happens to
other peoples, or Communism will
continue to chew off little bites.
We must summon the vision, cour
age and imagination to wake up
now and go to work."
