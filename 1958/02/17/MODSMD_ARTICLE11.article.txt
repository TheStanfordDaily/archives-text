# Indian Bishop Recommends Educational Ties with East
## 
### Steve Freidberg 
A great interest in the younger
generation and a heartfelt wish
to see Christian students from
Asia educated in America arc
foremost in the thoughts of Bish
op Ra.jah B. Manikam of the Ta
mil Lutheran Church in South
India.
Bishop Manikam visited Stan
ford from Friday until this
morning and expressed the hope
that the young Christian people
of India might come to a school
like this.
Sunday morning he spoke at
Memorial Church on the "Mis
sionary Creed," and in the eve
ning he discussed the "Christian
Mission in India Today" at Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
He is this year's Fosdick Visit
ing Professor at the Union Theo
logical Seminary in New York
City and spent last semester
teaching classes there. During
the second part of his year in the
United States he intends to travel
over the country lecturing at uni
versities and seminaries. He will
visit several other cities on the
West Coast before going back to
the Fast.
The Fosdick program, he ex
plained, was established at Union
Seminary in honor of the late
Harry Emerson Fosdick, a well
known preacher, and is now in

its fourth year. One person from
anywhere in the world is selected
annually to come to Union to
study and teach.
A great disappointment to
Bishop Manikam is that so few
Christian students from India
arc brought to the United States
to be educated in the universities.
"This is an immense contribu
tion that Stanford can make to
the churches of Asia," he said.
"Trained indigenous leadership is
necessary for the progress of the
church there."

I Jo mentioned thai Union Semi
nary brings 2o younger church
men each year to learn skills and
techniques and to take these back
to others in their own countries.
"They enrich the student life at
Union, and they are also bene
fited by their training. I should
like to see this done by more uni
versities."
15 ish op Manikam suggested
that a'Christian organization at
Stanford might want to bring an
Indian student to study here as
have organizations in other uni
versities.
"It is important that universi
ties on the West Coast, being so
close to Asia, have more contact
with the Eastern world on the
highest level. The student body
needs to know more about mod
ern India, and the Indian student
benefits from what he learns
here."
"Another way a student organi
zation might help," Bishop Mani
kam added, "is by sending a
Christian Indian student through
college in his own country if it is
not possible to bring him here.
It costs only $20(1 for a year of
college in India, and the student
gets an education he otherwise
would not have. This is some
thing concrete and helpful; it is
real, practical Christianity."
