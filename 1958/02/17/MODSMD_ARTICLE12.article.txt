viewpoint, his ambition and
goals, you will find old prejudices
disappear.
"You'll find that we are all one
family made strong and great by
the very differences that so many
times divide us as individuals and
groups. You'll learn to accept or
reject a person strictly on his
merits as a human being and not
because he happens to be differ
ent from you."
