## 
### 
JAKARTA (A*) —President Su
karno returned yesterday from
his long tour abroad with a dec
laration that Indonesia remains
united. Ho publicly ignored the
establishment of a rebel govern
ment in Central Sumatra which
others fear may lead to war.
"When I left this country 10
days ago," Sukarno told a wel
come-home crowd on his arrival
from Tokyo, "I called on the en
tire people of Indonesia to keep
unity of the Indonesian people.
When I return, I find this still
exists. I am really moved by all
this."
One of Sukarno's top lieuten
ants, Deputy Premier Hardi, said
the situation is serious.
May Become Civil War
"I am convinced that if a satis
factory settlement is not reached
with regard to the dissatisfaction
of the Central Sumatran people,
the situation may become explo
sive and turn into what may be
called a civil war," Hardi said.
The military chief of staff,
Maj. Gen. Abdul Harts Nasution,
called the rebel loaders traitors
and ordered their arrest.
The army intelligence chief, I,t.
Col. Sukendrit, said Indonesian
military forces are proceeding
with caution. But he added:
"As far as we are concerned
we want to avoid violence or use
of military force. But if it is
found necessary and if the situ
ation demands it, then we must
most reluctantly make use of
force."
Rebel Aim
The rebel aim is to throw out
Premier Djuanda and force Su
karno to ditch his "guided de
mocracy" program that left the
government open to Communist,
influence. The rebels accused
Djuanda of corruption.
Rebel leaders —military and ci
vilian — have said all along the
central government would launch
an attack if they set up their own
government. The Padang rebel
radio on Sumatra broadcast air
raid instructions to the Suma
trans and the rebel premier, Dr.
Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, said
his regime faces "difficulties and
dangers."

with regard to the dissatisfaction
of the Central Sumatran people,
the situation may become explo
sive and turn into what may be
called a civil war," Hardi said.
The military chief of staff,
Maj. Gen. Abdul Harts Nasution,
called the rebel loaders traitors
and ordered their arrest.
The army intelligence chief, I,t.
Col. Sukendrit, said Indonesian
military forces are proceeding
with caution. But he added:
"As far as we are concerned
we want to avoid violence or use
of military force. But if it is
found necessary and if the situ
ation demands it, then we must
most reluctantly make use of
force."
Rebel Aim
The rebel aim is to throw out
Premier Djuanda and force Su
karno to ditch his "guided de
mocracy" program that left the
government open to Communist,
influence. The rebels accused
Djuanda of corruption.
Rebel leaders —military and ci
vilian — have said all along the
central government would launch
an attack if they set up their own
government. The Padang rebel
radio on Sumatra broadcast air
raid instructions to the Suma
trans and the rebel premier, Dr.
Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, said
his regime faces "difficulties and
dangers."


PRESIDENT SUKARNO
Opposes Indonesian Rebels
JAKARTA (A*) —President Su
karno returned yesterday from
his long tour abroad with a dec
laration that Indonesia remains
united. Ho publicly ignored the
establishment of a rebel govern
ment in Central Sumatra which
others fear may lead to war.
"When I left this country 10
days ago," Sukarno told a wel
come-home crowd on his arrival
from Tokyo, "I called on the en
tire people of Indonesia to keep
unity of the Indonesian people.
When I return, I find this still
exists. I am really moved by all
this."
One of Sukarno's top lieuten
ants, Deputy Premier Hardi, said
the situation is serious.
May Become Civil War
"I am convinced that if a satis
factory settlement is not reached
with regard to the dissatisfaction
of the Central Sumatran people,
the situation may become explo
sive and turn into what may be
called a civil war," Hardi said.
The military chief of staff,
Maj. Gen. Abdul Harts Nasution,
called the rebel loaders traitors
and ordered their arrest.
The army intelligence chief, I,t.
Col. Sukendrit, said Indonesian
military forces are proceeding
