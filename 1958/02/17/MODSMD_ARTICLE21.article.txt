# Responsibilities of Brotherhood

### 
Sim.cial weeks set aside for the observance of
principles and platitudes usually go unnoticed,
except for a pleasantly-worded declaration by
the President and I lie mouthings of a few llaj£-
waving groups. World Cat \\ eek came and
went last fall, and our lives weren't much
changed by it. National Eat-More-Artichokes
\\ eek may he a nice idea, but we never liked
artichokes much anyway.
lint this week has been set aside as Brother
hood Week, and its significance, particularly
for America in 1958, is more than a passing one.
The position of the United States as a world
leader may well he decided this year —and, if it
is, it will not he decided by the number or size
of the Explorers launched, nor by the strength
of our military position. ()ur \\ ester 11 allies are
stuck with us, simply because there's no one
else to join against the threat of the Soviet
I nion, and further military advances on our
pari will not change the present balance of
power.
Il is to the neutral and underdeveloped coun
tries of Asia and Africa that we must look for

the creation of a more dynamic balance of
power. And the "power" in the balance is one
of ideologies, for the Asian peoples will not
support us for our military strength alone.
This is the realm in which the principles of
brotherhood) as exemplified by the various ac
tivities of the Y\\ CA and other campus groups
this week, should be considered.
"'Be Nice to Your Neighbor" is a nice slogan
—it is saneationed by the Bible, by democracy
and by virtually every precept and principle
of soeietv. Its practice is hard, but its rewards
are essential to our survival. Our actions toward
minority groups at home are noticed abroad
and capitalized on by the Soviet bloc. I'ravda
carried only a small mention of Eisenhower's
re-election last year, but it gave top play to the
Little Hock episode.
Brotherhood, of course, should be an end in
itself. Ihit the businessman personality of
America seems to demand a practical reason
for its ideologies. Our very existence as a free
and democratic country should he* a strong
enough reason.
