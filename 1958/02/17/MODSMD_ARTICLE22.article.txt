A Fino Is Not a Hilt
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the Wilbur Excom, I nm aware
of some of the reasons behind the Dean's change
in policy regarding false fire alarms at Wilbur.
Due to the closeness of the houses at Wilbur,
il was felt that putting the responsibility on all
Wilbur residents would be more fair than just
holding one house responsible. Again with the
idea of impressing responsibility, it was felt that
an individual fine to each man would be more
effective than a bill to the house which could be
paid out of the house social fund. These thoughts
were presented to the Dean by a group of stu
dents from Wilbur, and he, in turn, met with the
Wilbur Exrom to get the opinion of the leaders
of all eight houses. It was with the Excom's
recommendations in mind that the Dean's policy
was changed.
The fine was changed from $100 from Ihe house
involved to 50 cents per man for all Wilbur resi
dents. The total increase is irrelevant inasmuch
as this is a FINE, and not a bill for the fire de
partment's services. Mr. Schou's protest in Thurs
day's Daily is comparable to protesting a $10
speeding ticket on the grounds that it doesn't
cost the policeman $10 to stop the offender and
write the picket.
Mr. Schou would have found, upon checking.
Ihat, contrary to trying merely to raise more
money, the Dean canceled the fines owed for two
false alarms last quarter in order to give the new
plan a fair start. Mr. Schou is also erroneous in
his assumption that the money goes "to some
obscure scholarship fund." The money has been
set aside for major lounge improvements at Wil
bur which will benefit all Wilbur residents.
It is unfortunate that this plan had to be put
into effect before it had been explained to Wilbur
residents. I hope, however, that this presentation

of the facts will allow the subject to be viewed
in a truer light.

Mature Enough to Change?
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the matter of the Judicial Council
rules is before the students, it is time to sit back
and analyze the possible effects of the proposed
amendments.
While, for obvious reasons, I did not say so
when I was passing it around, it seems surprising
and a little disappointing—but true —that most of
those to whom I have talked have let themselves
be -so carried away with flag-waving and "demo
cratic rights" that they have not considered the
other side of this question. There is another side,
and a very important one.
These amendments, if adopted, will cause a
very basic change in our present judicial system
and Honor Code operation. They will show the
Stanford students exactly how much they want
an honor system, and what an honor system
entails. If social pressure is directed toward the
accusers, they may find themselves in a very un
fortunate position, and this possibility must be
seriously considered. Assuming that students
here are mature and responsible, this pressure
would not be a factor--but are they mature and
responsible?
The proposed changes will have the effect of
bringing the council out into the open, along with
our system of law enforcement, and will demon
strate whether students here are capable of as
suming the responsibilities of a real honor system
and of respecting those who do enforce it. Per
sonally, I tend to think they are. I hope that all
the students will consider this question, and that
Ihe matter, when it comes to a vote, will be de
cided either way by a thinking and an informed
electorate. Robert C. Guild
