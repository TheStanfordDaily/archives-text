### Dennis Gorman 
Editor's- Note: Dennis Gor
man, a student: in the Law
School and a graduate of Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy* will be writing u column
on student life at Stanford,
"The Compleat Apathetic,"
weekly in The Daily.
I recently asked an old hand
editor why lie went into the news
paper business. He answered, "I
felt I had something to say and
I needed a way to say it." flood
answer. A man with a purpose
who did something about it.
Rather makes him out a sort of
a hero.
Rut probably not all editors
are heroes, only'those with uni
versity papers and a few others.
Having never really thrashed
the matter out with any univer
sity newspaper editors, I attach
hero status to them unilaterally
upon consideration of the troub
les they must face. All tin 1 com
mercial editor has to worry about
is getting people to read his pa
per.
Rut think of the student editor!
He must, of course, get people to
read his paper. He must also, to
earn hero status, report the news
in a manner consistent with the
aims of the university.
So when this editor says to a
staff writer, "You! Write me 12
inches about Life at Stanford,"
my heart goes out to him. What
a chance that editor is taking!
What if the writer doesn't feel
like writing in a manner consist
ent with the aims of the univer
sity?
Which gets us directly to the
point of this column. I am sup
posed to write about Life at
Stanford, independent of any
guidance, summarizing the sub
ject neatly in 12 inches.
Life at Stanford is great. Most
of us don't have to worry about
things like how to make the
monthly payments or how to han
dle Junior's little ego. We are
supposed to be concerned pri*
marily with acquiring an educa
tion, a pleasant enough task, al
though demanding at times. The
old Ivory tower.

Hut hold it! There is some
thing lurking about thai is bad.
Let us examine a typical student.
Is he a hero like our editor?
There he stands: Ivy haircut, Ivy
Uaeks, Ivy shirt, charcoal sweat
er, with a nice line of patter,
slightly superior smile, cool.
Ask him about his major, why
don't you? Does fire come into
his eyes? Now ask him about
last weekend's romp with the
blonde. I contend this lad is not
a hero. lie can't be one because
le has no purpose. And 1 further
contend that this is a failing
prevalent in this University. Its
students do not seem to have ;i
purpose.
It may appear that I advocate
that everyone become a newspa
per editor. No. There would be
100 many editors. What I have
said is just a rehash of the famil
iar Stanford "apathy" line.
What do I advocate as a rem
edy? Transferring to the East?
No, I guess not. although that
might be a solution. Grin and
bear it? Yep. Until someone
comes up with a purpose pill or
there is a big depression. Or the
students are required to work out
in the world for a couple of years
before college. Or academic
standards are raised. Or maybe
we could all hold hands, close our
eyes and wish real hard.
When the great day comes and
every student has a purpose, can
you imagine the epidemic of
stimulitis that would sweep tlie
campus! People would read in
the library. And il would stay
open until the late show. Some
students might even stay in on
Saturday night to study. Our
typical student, when asked about
his major, would back us into a
corner.
