# Cal Ledgers To See Red
## 
### 
While Stanford usually claims
red as its color, this time the Uni
versity of California gets a touch
i)f it. But not out of choice.
It seems the Associated Stu
ilenls of IJC will probably go into
ilic red to ihc tune of $112,000
luring the 19f>7-58 academic year.
ASIJC, unlike Stanford, also
operates the bookstore and cafe
teria and conducts athletic
events.
