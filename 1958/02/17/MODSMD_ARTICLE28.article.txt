# League-Leading California Looks for Big Game Sweep
## 
### 
Lightning isn't supposed to strike twice in the same place, lint the
Stanford basket bailers will iry for a repeat flash tonight in the Pa
vilion when they host California in the season's second cage Big
flame.
The first holt came Friday night when the underdog Indians rose

I up to thrash title-contending US(\
57-14. Stanford's defeat of the
Frojans helped C'al greatly in the
j conference race, so the Indians
would like nothing better than to
negate that assistance by knock
ing off the Bears.
Stanford didn't have much luck
with Cal the last time out, losing
I (10-45. A nine-minute stretch in
the second half during which the
Cards couldn't pick up a field goal
proved to be the killing factor in
| I hat game at Berkeley.
Look at Lust Year
Still, the Indians shouldn't be
I swayed by that showing in look
ing at tonight's game. Last year
Cal won the teams' first battle by
an identical 15-point margin. But
came the rematch, and the Bears
had to go all the way to overtime
before ekeing out a 3-point vic
tory.
Stanford hopes for victory will
again ride on the same plans
which have carried the Cards to
upsets over USF, OSC and USC
go for the good shot and play
| tight on defense.
Tribe Starters
Jerry Thuesen and John Arril
; laga will go at forwards for the
! Indians, with Dick Haga at center.
! Captain Paul Neumann will be at
; one guard slot, with Doug Warren
or Mike Tipton at the other.
Cal's method of winning games
j rests on a stubborn defense that
is fourth in the nation in the latest
NCAA statistics. Earl Robinson
plays the principal presser role
for the Bears and does his job to
perfection.
Against the Indians last time,
Robinson accounted for a good
many of the Stanford floor mis
takes that cost them a chance at
winning.
Offensive Threats
Center Don Mcintosh, a good
man in close, and A 1 Buch, a dead
; eye guard, are the biggest Cal
threats on offense. The Bears are
: effective at working the ball in to
Mcintosh, but if they can't do that
Buch usually keeps them in con
tention with his quick two-hand
overhead set shot.
Title-wise, Cal has much more
at stake tonight. The Bears' 7-2
mark currently leads the PCC, but
they have only a half-game bulge
on UCLA and Oregon State. A
win for Cal would give them a
solid full-game lead in the tight
race. A Stanford victory would be
tallied as No. 4 in the major-upset
column for 1957-58.
