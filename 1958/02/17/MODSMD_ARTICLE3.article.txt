# Chorus Lacks Audience Contact; Chorale Shines
## 
### Margot Zeiss 
Running the program gamut from A to Z, the Stanford Chorus
steadily improved during its Friday performance in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
Yesterday's repeat concert was a degree better, but throughout
the Chorus showed an appalling lack of audience contact.

The opening number, choruses
from Handel's "L'Allegro." fea
tured a spirited duet piano ac
companiment with Helen Janzen
and David Williams at the key
board. The piece was well suited
to the abilities of the Chorus,
which did true justice to Han
del's sparkling themes and the
lyrical text by John Milton.
David Williams, the accompa
nist, turned in a flawless per
formance throughout the concert.
His accompaniment was the one
really professional note, and
stood out in bold relief against
the rest of the performers who
had a tendency to straggle on and
off stage and whisper when they
were not singing.
Ileal Enthusiasm
One bright spot in the evening
was the Stanford Chorale singing
"Balletti a cinque voci" by Gio
vanni Gastoldi. The Chorale
shone with real enthusiasm for
the balletti and alone showed any
fervor or love of singing. Some
how this group was able to break
through the iron curtain created
by their holdrng music up in
front of their faces, and they
communicated their love for sing
ing to the audience. The Chorus
as a whole just stood and sang,
wilh no sparkle or change of ex
pression.
Unequal to its difficulties and
unable to gloss over the inherent
flaws in the music, the Chorus
straggled its way through two
choruses from A Requiem by
Hector Berlioz. The pianissimo
parts brought out the good tone
and integrated blend of voices in
the Chorus, but the male voices
seemed unable to enter a phrase
together and shouted their way
through the forte passages.
Cloud of Gloom
The Berlioz number was the
cloud of gloom, and once past it.
ilv 1 Chorus gained in assurance
and artistry.
Contemporary selections in
cluded "To Music" by Paul Nel
son, who is now on a fellowship
in Vienna, "Madrigals for Wom
en's Voices" by Thomas Bever
idge, and the first performance
of "Tourist Time" by Kirk Me
chem, who was in the audience.

idge, and the first performance
of "Tourist Time" by Kirk Me
chem, who was in the audience.
Running the program gamut from A to Z, the Stanford Chorus
steadily improved during its Friday performance in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
Yesterday's repeat concert was a degree better, but throughout
the Chorus showed an appalling lack of audience contact.

The opening number, choruses
from Handel's "L'Allegro." fea
tured a spirited duet piano ac
companiment with Helen Janzen
and David Williams at the key
board. The piece was well suited
to the abilities of the Chorus,
which did true justice to Han
del's sparkling themes and the
lyrical text by John Milton.
David Williams, the accompa
nist, turned in a flawless per
formance throughout the concert.
His accompaniment was the one
really professional note, and
stood out in bold relief against
the rest of the performers who
had a tendency to straggle on and
off stage and whisper when they
were not singing.
Ileal Enthusiasm
One bright spot in the evening
was the Stanford Chorale singing
"Balletti a cinque voci" by Gio
vanni Gastoldi. The Chorale
shone with real enthusiasm for
the balletti and alone showed any
fervor or love of singing. Some
how this group was able to break
through the iron curtain created
by their holdrng music up in
front of their faces, and they
communicated their love for sing
ing to the audience. The Chorus
as a whole just stood and sang,
wilh no sparkle or change of ex
pression.
Unequal to its difficulties and
unable to gloss over the inherent
flaws in the music, the Chorus
straggled its way through two
choruses from A Requiem by
Hector Berlioz. The pianissimo
parts brought out the good tone
and integrated blend of voices in
the Chorus, but the male voices
seemed unable to enter a phrase
together and shouted their way
through the forte passages.
Cloud of Gloom
The Berlioz number was the
cloud of gloom, and once past it.
ilv 1 Chorus gained in assurance
and artistry.
Contemporary selections in
cluded "To Music" by Paul Nel
son, who is now on a fellowship
in Vienna, "Madrigals for Wom
en's Voices" by Thomas Bever
idge, and the first performance
of "Tourist Time" by Kirk Me
chem, who was in the audience.
