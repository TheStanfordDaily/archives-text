# Frosh Seek Revenge in Cal Battle
## 
### Alan Miller 
After losing a tight contest to
Marin JC, 63-57, here Friday eve
ning, Stanford's frosh cagemen
will try to gain revenge against a
powerhouse California live in the
Pavilion tonight at 0.
Boasting a 7-3 record, the Cubs
will be a tough club to beat. They
dumped the Papooses, 01-53, last
month behind the sharp shooting
of key guard Earl Schultz.
In Friday's contest, Marin .jump
ed off to an early lead, once hav
ing the locals down 11-0. Slanloiti
recommitered, however, and came
fighting back. With an amazing
52 per cent shooting average
sparked by center Bob Whelan
who sank 12 in the first half, i!
looked like the yearlings had the
game under control.
Second-Half Flop
As has been the story in past
games, the second half proved the
Papooses' downfall. With the half
barely under way, something hap
pened. The frosh cagers just could
not get the ball through the hoop,
hitting a poor 24 per cent. Mean
while. Marin's Dick and Don John
son dominated the ball game,
dropping in shots right and left.
YVhelan topped the yearlings
with 18, Bub Bowling had 13,
Bruce Anderson 11 and Tom Nord
land 9 points.
Another Thriller
Tonight's contest should be an
other thriller. Schultz is Cal's real
threat, now averaging over 19
points per game. Center Stan Mor
rison and forward Dave Stafford
also hurt Stanford considerably in
the last game and are again sure
to cause trouble. Jump shot artist
guard Ed Peirson and leading re
bounder forward Ned Averback
complete Cal's starting contin
gent.
Starting for the locals will be
Bowling and Morgan Met calf at
guards. Whelan at center and An
derson and Gary Estabrook at for
wards.
