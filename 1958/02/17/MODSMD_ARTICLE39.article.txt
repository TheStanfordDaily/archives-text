# What's it like to be with IBM?
## 
### 
First of all, what does an Applied Science Representa-
tive do? In John Jackson's own words, "I work
constantly with key executives of the many and varied
customers served by IBM in the territory for which I
am responsible, advising them on the use of their
electronic data processing machines. I consult with
these customers, analyze their scientific and technical
problems for solution with IBM machines. Occasion-
ally, I write papers and give talks and demonstrations
on electronic computing. All in all, it's pretty fascinating
..." In other words, he is a full-fledged computing
expert, a consultant. . . and a very important person
in this coming age of automation through electronics.

During the throe years that John Jackson has spent
with IBM as an Applied Science Representative, he
has guided innumerable customers to new and better

ways of doing things
with electronic com
puters. For example, a
leading aircraft manu-

that they couldn't afford to wait that long, so they
called on IBM. After consultation with top executives,
John Jackson helped to map out a computer program
that saved the organization over 100 days of pencil
chewing arithmetic. Later, for this same company, he
organized the establishment of computer systems for
aircraft performance predictions and for data reduc
tion of wind tunnel tests. At the same time, he worked
with this company's own employees, training them m
the use of IBM equipment. He remains in touch with
this customer to assist with new studies and problems
as they develop.

A new field for the mathematician—lßM computers
Why did John Jackson decide to join IBM? Today,
he is exercising his mathematical know-how in a field
that was practically unheard of ten years ago. Even
now, this kind of work may be news to you. It was to
him a few years bark when he was an undergraduate
at the University of Colorado. At that time, he was

Mathematician John B. Jackson, like many other
mathematicians, engineers and physicists, came to
IBM directly from graduate school. Today, an Applied
Science Representative, he reviews his progress and
tells how he uses his math background in a new field.

considering mathematical research. But he liked the
excitement and diversification of business and indus
try, and he wanted to use his mathematical background
in that area. It was not until he was interviewed by

IBM that he became
aware of this new field
for mathematicians. A
few mont hs later, he be
gan his career as an Ap
plied Science trainee.
John Jackson has pro
gressed rapidly since
he joined the Company.
He's now the Wash
ington representative
operating with one of
IBM's key Divisions,

Military Products, in the Washington, D. C., office.
With his wife Katherine, daughter Lisa, and John, Jr.,
he enjoys life in the nation's capital.

Interesting and chal
lenging responsibilities,
plus the knowledge that
he is making a sub
stantial contribution in
a rapidly expanding
area of IBM that ia
important to the Com
pany and to the nation,
assure John Jackson
that he is moving along
a road of real future
opportunities. . ■<****
