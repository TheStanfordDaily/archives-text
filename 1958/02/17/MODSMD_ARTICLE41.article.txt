# Still in Room 322-Plus $86,700

### Doug Willis 
In September, 1937, freshman
Bruce Jessup moved into Room
322 of Encina Hall and promptly
mixed, mingled and integrated
into the Stanford family. A
couple of years later Jessup was
elected student body president,
and in 1941 he graduated from
the School of Economics.
Today Dr. Bruce Jessup is back
in Room 322 of Encina Hall! No
—he didn't forget anything—it is
an $86,700 grant from the Rosen
berg Foundation of San Fran
cisco that has brought him back
to Stanford and given him an
office in Encina.
The new Stanford Medical Cen
ter will play its part in the study.
The pediatric wing of the build
ing will be completed by Septem
ber, 1959, and Dr. Jessup will
give practical application to his
ideas in the new facilities.
"The Stanford area — from
about San Mateo to San Jose and
the fringe of the East Bay"—said
Jesup, "is an ideal place for the
study of child health. It has a
sizeable population, but it is not
too large for a comprehensive
survey. It has a good variety of
people, and there are a number
of transients, who have the most
pediatric problems.
"The coming of the Medical
School to the area and the ad
vantages of working with a pri
vate institution also make the
study feasible."
Jessup explained (hat the pe
culiar advantages of the area
were among the reasons that

made the Rosenberg Foundation
decide to support the project. The
idea of the survey came from the
construction of the new Medical
School and the pediatric progress
already made in the area.
Jessup cited the Stanford Con
valescent Home and the large
number of pediatricians in Palo
Alto among other advantages of
the area.
Outstanding work by various
Stanford departments was also
credited with helping to attract
the grant from the Rosenberg
Foundation. The Psychology De
partment, School of Education
and Speech and Hearing Clinic
have all done outstanding child
health work, and Dr. Robert
Sears, professor of psychology
and education, recently published

i a book titled "Patterns of Child |
j birth."
Child health care, according to
Dr. Jessup, has a new role in so
ciety. The job of today's pedia
trician is not just the diagnosis
of medical problems, but includes
co-operation with parents,
schools, child guidance organiza
tions, retarded children programs
and public and private institu
tions interested in healthy, well
adjusted children.
The pediatrician's training,
therefore, must relate medicine
to the humanities and the social
sciences.
The Stanford Medical School
already recognizes this need and j
requires each student to take five
units of non • medical subjects
' each quarter.

In addition to developing ideas
for the Stanford teaching pro
gram, Dr. Jessup hopes to help
co-ordinate ideas for better
teaching on all levels. Other
goals of the program are to de
velop possibilities for more de
tailed research and develop a sur
vey of the needs of the area.
Jessup. a practicing pediatri
cian at the Palo Alto Clinic, be
gan work on Jan. 1. For the first
nine or 10 months of his study
he will spend most of his time
visiting other communities to ob
serve child health programs in
action.
He has already been to Van
couver, 8.C., and communities in
the Pacific Northwest, and he
will go to Washington, D.C., and
tour the East Coast soon.
