# Tribe Scores 3rd Upset; Wallops Trojans, 57-44
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
There was only one logical method by which Stanford could beat
Southern California, and so that's the one Howie Dallmar's club used
to trim the Trojans, 57-44, Friday in Stanford Pavilion.
The Indians played it close to the vest on offense, playing for the
one good shot or the easy set-up; and they hounded Troy on defense

so effectively that the invaders
could score only 9 points in the
final 15 minutes of play.
Thus, for the third time this
year, Stanford pulled off a major
uj>set by successfully executing
I he tactics for which they are best
suited.
First it was San Francisco, then
Oregon State and now USG who
have fallen victims to hot Indian
shooting and error-inducing defen
sive play.
Troy Outrebounded
Other than the score, the most
surprising aspect of Stanford's
third PCC victory was the In
dians' out rebounding of the big
ger and heavier Trojans. Dick
Haga, with 10 pulldowns, helped
the Cards come out on top. 33-32.
And it was Ilaga who threw in
17 points to take the evening's
scoring honors. Jerry Thuesen,
flipping in long set shots at the
crucial moments, wasn't far be
hind with 15 points.
In the early stages of the game
it looked as though the Trojans'
superior size would prove deci
sive. Big Jim Hanna, the 6-7, 235-
pound center, was muscling in ef
fectively under the boards, and
Jim Pugh and Jim White were
also using their size to good ad
vantage.
Accurate shooting from both
the floor and the free-throw line
helped the Indians stay within 1
lo 3 points for the first eight min
utes, and then the first of two
dams broke.
Paul Neumann hit a 15-foot
jump shot; then he and 1 laga sank

four free throws between them,
and Stanford had a 21-IS lead.
Three more points by Haga and a
crisp 20-footer by John Arrillaga
! widened the gap to 26-1K with just
j 4minutes to play in the first
| half.
The Trojans managed a brief
i comeback, but made up only 3
| points before intermission. The
i two teams left the floor with the
I scoreboard reading 28-23.
Move to Within 2
White personally accounted for
USC's first 7 points ol the second
half, and when Stanford could get
only singleton field goals by Doug
Warren and Thuesen, the gap had
narrowed to 3230.
Stanford's shooting began to
! falter ;t bit, and Forrest Two
good's squad took full advantage
of the situation to finally grab the
lead again. Pugh's 15-l'ooter did it,
leaving the score 37-35 with less
than 15 minutes to play.
At this point Dailmar put his
complete confidence in the bench
and inserted the second team.

The maneuver couldn't h av e
worked better. The second unit
stayed in for close to four min
utes, spent most of their time
stalling, and left the floor still
just 2 points behind.
Stanford quickly tied the game
as Arrillaga dumped in a lay-up
after a great pass from Neumann.
The second dam broke as the In
dians widened their lead to 47-39
before USC could score again, put
ling t lie game on ice.
A succession of set up plays and
sloppy floor maneuvers by the
Trojans used up Uie rest of the
time. By buzzer time the Indians
were pretty much running wild
and USC was thoroughly disor
ganized.
The victory didn't give Stanford
much more than the satisfaction
of knocking Troy out of conten
tion for the rCO crown. The
Cards are still just 3-7. although
they could better their eighth
place standing by a couple of
notches with a few more perform
ances like Friday's.

Trojans used up Uie rest of the
time. By buzzer time the Indians
were pretty much running wild
and USC was thoroughly disor

The victory didn't give Stanford
much more than the satisfaction
of knocking Troy out of conten

Cards are still just 3-7. although
they could better their eighth
place standing by a couple of
notches with a few more perform

There was only one logical method by which Stanford could beat
Southern California, and so that's the one Howie Dallmar's club used
to trim the Trojans, 57-44, Friday in Stanford Pavilion.
The Indians played it close to the vest on offense, playing for the
one good shot or the easy set-up; and they hounded Troy on defense

so effectively that the invaders
could score only 9 points in the
final 15 minutes of play.
Thus, for the third time this
year, Stanford pulled off a major
uj>set by successfully executing
I he tactics for which they are best
suited.
First it was San Francisco, then
Oregon State and now USG who

shooting and error-inducing defen

Troy Outrebounded
Other than the score, the most
surprising aspect of Stanford's

Haga, with 10 pulldowns, helped
the Cards come out on top. 33-32.
And it was Ilaga who threw in
17 points to take the evening's
scoring honors. Jerry Thuesen,
flipping in long set shots at the
crucial moments, wasn't far be

In the early stages of the game
it looked as though the Trojans'
superior size would prove deci

Jim Pugh and Jim White were
also using their size to good ad
vantage.
Accurate shooting from both
the floor and the free-throw line
helped the Indians stay within 1

Paul Neumann hit a 15-foot

Stanford's shooting began to

At this point Dailmar put his

just 2 points behind.
Stanford quickly tied the game
as Arrillaga dumped in a lay-up
after a great pass from Neumann.
The second dam broke as the In
dians widened their lead to 47-39
before USC could score again, put
ling t lie game on ice.
A succession of set up plays and
sloppy floor maneuvers by the
Trojans used up Uie rest of the
time. By buzzer time the Indians
were pretty much running wild
and USC was thoroughly disor
ganized.
The victory didn't give Stanford
much more than the satisfaction
of knocking Troy out of conten
tion for the rCO crown. The
Cards are still just 3-7. although
they could better their eighth
place standing by a couple of
notches with a few more perform
ances like Friday's.
There was only one logical method by which Stanford could beat
Southern California, and so that's the one Howie Dallmar's club used
to trim the Trojans, 57-44, Friday in Stanford Pavilion.
The Indians played it close to the vest on offense, playing for the
one good shot or the easy set-up; and they hounded Troy on defense

so effectively that the invaders
could score only 9 points in the
final 15 minutes of play.
Thus, for the third time this
year, Stanford pulled off a major
uj>set by successfully executing
I he tactics for which they are best
suited.
First it was San Francisco, then
Oregon State and now USG who
have fallen victims to hot Indian
shooting and error-inducing defen
sive play.
Troy Outrebounded
Other than the score, the most
surprising aspect of Stanford's
third PCC victory was the In
dians' out rebounding of the big
ger and heavier Trojans. Dick
Haga, with 10 pulldowns, helped
the Cards come out on top. 33-32.
And it was Ilaga who threw in
17 points to take the evening's
scoring honors. Jerry Thuesen,
flipping in long set shots at the
crucial moments, wasn't far be
hind with 15 points.
In the early stages of the game
it looked as though the Trojans'
superior size would prove deci
sive. Big Jim Hanna, the 6-7, 235-
pound center, was muscling in ef
fectively under the boards, and
Jim Pugh and Jim White were
also using their size to good ad
vantage.
Accurate shooting from both
the floor and the free-throw line
helped the Indians stay within 1
lo 3 points for the first eight min
utes, and then the first of two
dams broke.
Paul Neumann hit a 15-foot
jump shot; then he and 1 laga sank

four free throws between them,
and Stanford had a 21-IS lead.
Three more points by Haga and a
crisp 20-footer by John Arrillaga
! widened the gap to 26-1K with just
j 4minutes to play in the first
| half.
The Trojans managed a brief
i comeback, but made up only 3
| points before intermission. The
i two teams left the floor with the
I scoreboard reading 28-23.
Move to Within 2
White personally accounted for
USC's first 7 points ol the second
half, and when Stanford could get
only singleton field goals by Doug
Warren and Thuesen, the gap had
narrowed to 3230.
Stanford's shooting began to
! falter ;t bit, and Forrest Two
good's squad took full advantage
of the situation to finally grab the
lead again. Pugh's 15-l'ooter did it,
leaving the score 37-35 with less
than 15 minutes to play.
At this point Dailmar put his
complete confidence in the bench
and inserted the second team.

The maneuver couldn't h av e
worked better. The second unit
stayed in for close to four min
utes, spent most of their time
stalling, and left the floor still
just 2 points behind.
