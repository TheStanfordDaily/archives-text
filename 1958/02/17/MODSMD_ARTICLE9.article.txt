# Tribe Scores 3rd Upset; Wallops Trojans, 57-44
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
There was only one logical method by which Stanford could beat
Southern California, and so that's the one Howie Dallmar's club used
to trim the Trojans, 57-44, Friday in Stanford Pavilion.
The Indians played it close to the vest on offense, playing for the
one good shot or the easy set-up; and they hounded Troy on defense

so effectively that the invaders
could score only 9 points in the
final 15 minutes of play.
Thus, for the third time this
year, Stanford pulled off a major
uj>set by successfully executing
I he tactics for which they are best
suited.
First it was San Francisco, then
Oregon State and now USG who
have fallen victims to hot Indian
shooting and error-inducing defen
sive play.
Troy Outrebounded
Other than the score, the most
surprising aspect of Stanford's
third PCC victory was the In
dians' out rebounding of the big
ger and heavier Trojans. Dick
Haga, with 10 pulldowns, helped
the Cards come out on top. 33-32.
And it was Ilaga who threw in
17 points to take the evening's
scoring honors. Jerry Thuesen,
flipping in long set shots at the
crucial moments, wasn't far be
hind with 15 points.
In the early stages of the game
it looked as though the Trojans'
superior size would prove deci
sive. Big Jim Hanna, the 6-7, 235-
pound center, was muscling in ef
fectively under the boards, and
Jim Pugh and Jim White were
also using their size to good ad
vantage.
