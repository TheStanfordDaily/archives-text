Ihe fact that tlie territory iu ques
tion was under the administration
of the Netherlands East Indies,
which were superseded in 1950 by
the United States of Indonesia.
Well informed and "interested"
in Netherlands-Indonesia rela
tions, Dr. van Roi.jen represented
his country before the UN Secu
rity Council during their discus
sion of the Indonesian dispute in
194 K.
He headed Ihe Netherlands dele
gation to the preliminary confer
ence on Indonesian independence
at Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1949. In
Ihe same year, he served as vice
chairman of the Dutch delegation
to the round-table conference at
The Hague for settlement of the
Indonesian dispute. Dr. van Roi
.jen has served as his country's
ambassador to the United Slates
since 1950.
Concluding his evaluation of I lie
Indonesian dispute, he stater! that
ihe Netherlands has offered to
take the matter before Ihe Inter
national Court of Justice. The In
donesian government "refused"
this course.
He called attention to the fact
that the United Nations "ha-s not
recognized" Indonesia's conten

lions in the lerritorial question
and has not once in four years
given Hie necessary two-thirds
voir to bring the matter before
Ihe General Assembly.
Considering another subject, Dr.
van Roi.jen emphasized the im
portance of the newly-formed Eu
ropean Market Community, aim
ed at "the economic unification of
Europe." Members of this agree
ment, which became active Jan. 1,
are The Netherlands. Belgium.
Luxembourg, France, Italy and
West Germany.
The agreement provides for a
common market in western Eu
rope, tapping a pool of 1(55 million
people. The ambassador contend
er! that without this pact the mem
her countries would "he backward
and underdeveloped in 25 years.
They unite to survive."
The purpose of the pact is to
"eliminate tariffs duties and oth
er impediments to trade among
the countries. The economies, pur
chasing powers and standards of
living will rise as cooperation de
velops." Dr. van Roi.jen concluded
his explanation with the state
ment that "the European Market
Community will strengthen the
Western free world."
