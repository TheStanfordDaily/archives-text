## 
### 
A Stanford shutterbug recently
hit the jackpot by having one of
his photos published in Life mag
azine.
Bill Blankenburg, graduate stu
dent in communications, was the
one who clicked the shutter for
the photo entitled "Bubble Troub
le in the Choir," which appeared
under "Miscellany" on page 100
of the Feb. 10 issue.
Six robed choir girls were de
picted inside a church; the eye
catching feature was one of the
sweeties who was quite proficient
in the use of bubble gum.
Blankenburg originally took
the photo for the Los Altos Town
Crier, on which he works part
time. Previously he has had pic
tures published in Better Homes
and Gardens and several profes
sional journals. He is a Univer
sity of South Dakota graduate.
A Stanford alumnus, Philip
Ward Burton, A. 13. '44, M.A. '46,
now a professor at Syracuse
University, was the author of an
article in This Week magazine
(Feb. 91 on why women should
not attend college.
