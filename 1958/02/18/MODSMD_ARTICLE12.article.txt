A would-be Wyatt Earp in
the person of Stanford senior
Raymond Williamson acciden
tally shot himself Sunday af
ternoon while "practicing a fast
draw."
His trigger-finger was faster
than his wrist action, and the
.22-ealiber revolver apparently
discharged before it had cleared
the holster.
Attendants at the Palo Alto
Hospital said that the bullet
lodged in the right thigh just
above the knee. Surgery was
performed to remove it and
Williamson was reportedly do
doing "just fine."
