and Misery of the Third Reich"
and portrays scenes from the
lives of the German people living
during Adolf Hitler's rise to pow
er and conquest.
Brecht was a German writer
who typified the younger genera
tion of the 1920'5. He was strongly
opposed to Hitler's regime and be
came No. 5 on the Nazi murder
list.
He escaped Germany and lived
near Monterey for a period, but
returned to Germany after the
war, where he became an active
Communist until his death in
1956.
His writing differs from that of
other exiles in that it is neither
bitter nor a mere continuation <>112
his former work. Rather than
showing the high points and cri
ses, he shows the background and
details of the lives he portrays.
The production consists of six
scenes and will be done in German
by members of the German club
The play is under the direction of
Rol) Gottwald, who is a graduate
student studying at Stanford un
