# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## To Grasp the Nettle 
### Walter Lippmann 
The Prime Minister, M. Gaillard, has accepted
full responsibility on behalf of the French gov
ernment for the bombing of the Tunisian border
town. He expressed regret that civilians were
killed. But he insisted that the bombing was an
act of "legitimate defense," and that his govern
ment "does not recognize culpability in this af
fair."
This closes the door to what might have been
a way out of the affair —namely to disavow the
violence caused by the local commanders, and
to give assurances that their actions will not
be repeated.
Had this door not been closed, Ihere would
have been some hope not too much hope but
some—that the French-Tunisian conflict could
have been limited to local actions along the bor
der, with the two governments in Paris and
Tunis not immediately and directly involved.
There is not much hope of that now, and we
have a conflict between France and Tunisia
which is spreading to all the critical points—
such as the naval base at Ri/erte where their
national interests meet.
* * *
This makes our own position very difficult
indeed. For we are caught in a bad squeeze.
France is our oldest ally ami it is now the key
stone of our strategic position in Kurope. Tu
nisia is a new friend. But it is of all the Arab
countries the most genuinely interested in re
maining within the Western world. If we can
not find a way to work harmoniously with Tu
nisia under the government of >1. Bourguiba,
the prospects are dark indeed of a good rela
tionship between North Africa and the West
ern world.
Our policy, as Mr. Dulles described it in his
press conference on Tuesday, is in substance to
muddle through, and to pray that neither side

will ask us to lake a decisive position. Mr. Dulles
is hard pressed and entitled to play for time. It
i* understandable that he should hope that he
can in North Africa continue to muddle through.
•» * to
For the alternative to muddling through is
difficult and dangerous 1 , considering the tem
per which now exists in Paris and in the A rah
world. But it looks very much as if the diffi
cult course, though dangerous, may neverthe
less be safer than the policy of muddling
through a conflict which is becoming so bitter
and so irreconcilable. The alternative course
would be to lake the line that the Algerian
war is a danger to the peace of the world, and
that all suitable diplomatic measures must be
taken to mediate and to compose the Algerian
war.
This will bo a very unpopular position in many
quarters in France for the United Slates to lake.
But, as the North African conflict spreads, will
it really be possible for this country to remain
strictly neutral and uninvolved? M. Gaillard's
government is heading into great trouble, and
as the conflict deepens and spreads, it will seem
more and more intolerable that a professed ally
like the United Stales should also be a professed
neutral in the tragic business in which France
is involved.
« * «
Probably the wisest and the safest thing to
do is to grasp the nettle firmly, and to say
firmly and clearly that the time has- come to
negotiate a political settlement in North Af
rica. Far from this being an action unfriendly
to France, it may well be a signal act of friend
ship to open the door through which the French
nation would go, were it free of internal en
tanglements which prevent il from acting in
its own highest interest.

This makes our own position very difficult
indeed. For we are caught in a bad squeeze.
France is our oldest ally ami it is now the key
stone of our strategic position in Kurope. Tu
nisia is a new friend. But it is of all the Arab
countries the most genuinely interested in re
maining within the Western world. If we can
not find a way to work harmoniously with Tu
nisia under the government of >1. Bourguiba,
the prospects are dark indeed of a good rela
tionship between North Africa and the West

Our policy, as Mr. Dulles described it in his
press conference on Tuesday, is in substance to
muddle through, and to pray that neither side

will ask us to lake a decisive position. Mr. Dulles
is hard pressed and entitled to play for time. It
i* understandable that he should hope that he
can in North Africa continue to muddle through.

For the alternative to muddling through is
difficult and dangerous 1 , considering the tem
per which now exists in Paris and in the A rah
world. But it looks very much as if the diffi
cult course, though dangerous, may neverthe
less be safer than the policy of muddling
through a conflict which is becoming so bitter
and so irreconcilable. The alternative course
would be to lake the line that the Algerian
war is a danger to the peace of the world, and
that all suitable diplomatic measures must be
taken to mediate and to compose the Algerian
war.
This will bo a very unpopular position in many
quarters in France for the United Slates to lake.
But, as the North African conflict spreads, will
it really be possible for this country to remain
strictly neutral and uninvolved? M. Gaillard's
government is heading into great trouble, and
as the conflict deepens and spreads, it will seem
more and more intolerable that a professed ally
like the United Stales should also be a professed
neutral in the tragic business in which France
is involved.

Probably the wisest and the safest thing to
do is to grasp the nettle firmly, and to say
firmly and clearly that the time has- come to
negotiate a political settlement in North Af

ship to open the door through which the French
nation would go, were it free of internal en

The Prime Minister, M. Gaillard, has accepted
full responsibility on behalf of the French gov
ernment for the bombing of the Tunisian border
town. He expressed regret that civilians were
killed. But he insisted that the bombing was an
act of "legitimate defense," and that his govern
ment "does not recognize culpability in this af
fair."
This closes the door to what might have been
a way out of the affair —namely to disavow the
violence caused by the local commanders, and
to give assurances that their actions will not
be repeated.
Had this door not been closed, Ihere would
have been some hope not too much hope but
some—that the French-Tunisian conflict could
have been limited to local actions along the bor
der, with the two governments in Paris and
Tunis not immediately and directly involved.
There is not much hope of that now, and we
have a conflict between France and Tunisia
which is spreading to all the critical points—
such as the naval base at Ri/erte where their
national interests meet.
