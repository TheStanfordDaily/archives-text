Service to Frcslirncti
Editor, The Daily:
The letter which appeared in Friday's Daily
signed by nine Stern men presents a somewhat
distorted view of what is being sought at Stern,
and deserves some clarification.
The goal of the present house system at Stern
is not to convert the wings into "eight amorphous
fraternity houses," as was stated in the letter.
Nor is it to force a person into a mass of con
formity where his individuality becomes lost.
Perhaps this is what might appear to the casual
observer, but it is not so.
What we seek in the program is a system
whereby the individual will find more favorable
conditions in which to assert his individuality.
Under the old system, a person was lost in a mass
and found it difficult to rise. This, we feel, will be
counteracted by the house system, which places
one in a smaller, independent group, thereby
making it easier to participate in activities and
make one's voice heard.
Yes, a handbook will be published soon, and
open houses will be held but not for "rushing"
purposes. Rather, they will serve to give the
freshman a look into the aspects of an independ
ent's life and help him to see more than two sides
to his future at Stanford. We look upon this as
an informative service to the freshmen nothing
more.

Mr. Haas and his friends seem 1o he misin
formed concerning the house system. To rectify
this, I invite Ihem to see me in my room (4021
any evening they choose, and I will attempt to
dispel any misconceptions ihey may have.

Not So Sophisticated?
Editor, The Daily:
Somewhat belatedly, I would like to comment
on the fine Stanford Symphony concerts last
week end. I was so thrilled by the performance
Friday night that I also attended Sunday after
noon. This was possible because there were empty
seats at each performance which anyone might
fill.
It struck me as ironic that at a school such as
this, priding itself on academic and cultural at
mosphere, seats for a free symphony should go
a-begging, while old movies on Sunday nights and
a lacklustre football team on Saturday afternoons
draw capacity crowds in larger arenas.
"Good" music was better received at my old
alma mater, Michigan State University of Agri
culture and Applied Science. What gives, here at '
Stanford? Could it be we are not as sophisticated
as we think?
