# Tunisia Quarrel Prompts Offer of U.S., British Aid
## 
### 
TUNIS (/P) Tunisia and France agreed yesterday to accept the
good offices of the United States and Britain in the quarrel over
tne French aerial bombing of a Tunisian village.
Tunisia delayed calling off its protest to the UN Security Council,
but diplomats in London said Britain and the United States were

confident that yesterday's action
had warded off an acrimonious
public debate when the UN meets
today.
In using their good offices, the
United States and Britain will act
as go-betweens in passing mes
sages and proposals back and
forth in an effort to help repair
the relations between France and
its former North African protec
torate. They will not be acting
as judges or mediators.
Withdrawal Appeal
Informants in London said the
British and Americans were ap
pealing to both Tunisia and
France to withdraw their com
plaints to the UN. The Western
powers fear such a debate would
benefit only Soviet Russia, whose
Arkady Sobolev is president of
the Council this month.
The official spokesman for Tu
nisian President Habib Bour
guiba said, "The complaint has
not been withdrawn and the pro
ceedings are following their nor
mal course." The French com
plaint has not been withdrawn
either.
However, London informants
said the Americans and British
had word that seven members of
the 11-member Council—the nec
essary number were ready to
oppose a debate at this time.

Bourguiba asked the CouncJl to
take up a French "act of aggres

France countered with a de
mand that Algerian rebel opera
tions from Tunisia tin looked into.
The French said the bombing was
an act of defense against Alge

TUNIS (/P) Tunisia and France agreed yesterday to accept the
good offices of the United States and Britain in the quarrel over
tne French aerial bombing of a Tunisian village.
Tunisia delayed calling off its protest to the UN Security Council,
but diplomats in London said Britain and the United States were

confident that yesterday's action
had warded off an acrimonious
public debate when the UN meets
today.
In using their good offices, the
United States and Britain will act
as go-betweens in passing mes
sages and proposals back and
forth in an effort to help repair
the relations between France and
its former North African protec
torate. They will not be acting
as judges or mediators.
Withdrawal Appeal
Informants in London said the
British and Americans were ap
pealing to both Tunisia and
France to withdraw their com
plaints to the UN. The Western
powers fear such a debate would
benefit only Soviet Russia, whose
Arkady Sobolev is president of
the Council this month.
The official spokesman for Tu
nisian President Habib Bour
guiba said, "The complaint has
not been withdrawn and the pro
ceedings are following their nor
mal course." The French com
plaint has not been withdrawn
either.
However, London informants
said the Americans and British
had word that seven members of
the 11-member Council—the nec
essary number were ready to
oppose a debate at this time.
French Bombing
A French air raid by 2."> planes
on the border village of Sakiet
Sidi Youssef 10 days ago, in
which the Tunisians claim 70
men, women and children were
killed, resulted in three com
plaints to the UN.
Bourguiba asked the CouncJl to
take up a French "act of aggres
sion" against Tunisia.
France countered with a de
mand that Algerian rebel opera
tions from Tunisia tin looked into.
The French said the bombing was
an act of defense against Alge
rian rebels in Tunisia.
