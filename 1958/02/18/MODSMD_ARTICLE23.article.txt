### Dick Barnes 
Letter from an Athlete
The following letter was personally delivered to me Friday. T!
may help clear away the haze surrounding attitudes and training
habits of Stanford athletes, in particular, members of the track team,
since it is that group which I've commented on several times in re
cent weeks. The letter-:
To Dick Barnes:
As a member of the 19f>8 Stanford track team, I feel obligated
to shed some light on the recent controversy that has been raging
within the Department of Athletics as a result of the new policy
introduced a year ago by our two exceptional track coaches, Pay
ton Jordan and Floyd Strain. It should he known that these, our
coaches, are not standing by their high ideals and standards alone
arid in opposition to the team members. On the contrary, the num
ber of track men here who would not support the coaches' plans
for building a national caliber track team could be counted in
single figures.
However, the lack of discipline, spirit for competition, and de
votion to the sport of track as a testing ground for the rigors of
life hangs ominously and constantly over our team. No longer
can we compare ourselves to one another for standards of perform
ance on the track; we must elevate our thoughts to a world com
petition plane and accompany our high goals with an attack on
complacency, negative attitude on and off the field, and self-de
ceiving training habits. The time has* come to cease fussing and
fretting with our training like boys and begin to work like men;
undoubtedly, such a program will only stimulate academic en
deavors rather than hinder them because of the vigor and sense
of accomplishment such a plan has to offer.
The truth hurts, and if I have agitated or angered any of my
fellow teammates, it has only been done in hopes of revealing the
genuine desire of our team to support Coach Jordan and Coach
Strain to the letter, which we as team members have failed to
express for fear of becoming outspoken. In obligation to our
families, Stanford University, and our 1958 and future track teams,
I sincerely believe that we can meet the challenges of track and
field and cease to make excuses for our Saturday afternoon per
formances.

A Rare Occurrence
There it is—the definite and in-writing statement of a Stanford
athlete that he and his teammates are behind their coaching staff.
It's a rare occasion when an athlete at any school will come out
and publicly make a statement of this nature—and at Stanford, it is
virtually unheard of. And why? I believe Keith Wallace hit the nail
right on the head when he said it was "for fear of becoming - out
spoken."
There's no doubt that Stanford breeds individualism in athletics.
Now individualism is certainly a worthwhile characteristic in many
fields and in some phases of athletics. But it's also true that there
has got to be teamwork if there's going to be success—and that goes
in even as individual a sport as track appears to be.
If Wallace is right in his statement that there are less than a
handful of dissenters on Payton Jordan's and Floyd Strain's- teams,
then there has been a big improvement from last year. And now!
maybe that improvement will catch on in other sports where it is
needed. There's no point in singling these sports or athletes out
ihey know where they stand.

Stanford liked what it saw of Jack Curtice nt the Shrine game
and so it hired him. The Shrine committee must have liked him, too,
because they've named him as head coach again next season. This
will be Curtice's third straight year on the West staff, and his sec
ond straight as the head man.
Not meaning to slight the Shriners, I hope he can't make it fori
the game maybe some excuse like a prior commitment in Pasadena.!

Statement from USC basketball coach Forrest Twogood before I
coming north last weekend: "As far as I'm concerned, the Indians
may have the best club in the country. At least they were unbeatable
when I saw them."
It seems that Forrest saw the Cards in their shockers over San
Francisco and Oregon State. Now, of course, he's added another
look-see to his list, and probably still thinks they're unbeatable.
Even before his loss up here, Twogood said he thought maybe his
presence was a good-luck charm for llomie Dalhnar's team. Wonder I
it he'll show up in Long Beach Saturday when the Tribe plays Troy
again?

A Rare Occurrence
There it is—the definite and in-writing statement of a Stanford
athlete that he and his teammates are behind their coaching staff.
It's a rare occasion when an athlete at any school will come out
and publicly make a statement of this nature—and at Stanford, it is
virtually unheard of. And why? I believe Keith Wallace hit the nail
right on the head when he said it was "for fear of becoming - out
spoken."
There's no doubt that Stanford breeds individualism in athletics.
Now individualism is certainly a worthwhile characteristic in many
fields and in some phases of athletics. But it's also true that there
has got to be teamwork if there's going to be success—and that goes
in even as individual a sport as track appears to be.
If Wallace is right in his statement that there are less than a
handful of dissenters on Payton Jordan's and Floyd Strain's- teams,
then there has been a big improvement from last year. And now!
maybe that improvement will catch on in other sports where it is
needed. There's no point in singling these sports or athletes out
ihey know where they stand.

Stanford liked what it saw of Jack Curtice nt the Shrine game
and so it hired him. The Shrine committee must have liked him, too,
because they've named him as head coach again next season. This
will be Curtice's third straight year on the West staff, and his sec
ond straight as the head man.
Not meaning to slight the Shriners, I hope he can't make it fori
the game maybe some excuse like a prior commitment in Pasadena.!

Statement from USC basketball coach Forrest Twogood before I
coming north last weekend: "As far as I'm concerned, the Indians
may have the best club in the country. At least they were unbeatable
when I saw them."
It seems that Forrest saw the Cards in their shockers over San
Francisco and Oregon State. Now, of course, he's added another
look-see to his list, and probably still thinks they're unbeatable.
Even before his loss up here, Twogood said he thought maybe his
presence was a good-luck charm for llomie Dalhnar's team. Wonder I
it he'll show up in Long Beach Saturday when the Tribe plays Troy
again?

Letter from an Athlete
The following letter was personally delivered to me Friday. T!
may help clear away the haze surrounding attitudes and training
habits of Stanford athletes, in particular, members of the track team,
since it is that group which I've commented on several times in re
cent weeks. The letter-:
To Dick Barnes:
As a member of the 19f>8 Stanford track team, I feel obligated
to shed some light on the recent controversy that has been raging
within the Department of Athletics as a result of the new policy
introduced a year ago by our two exceptional track coaches, Pay
ton Jordan and Floyd Strain. It should he known that these, our
coaches, are not standing by their high ideals and standards alone
arid in opposition to the team members. On the contrary, the num
ber of track men here who would not support the coaches' plans
for building a national caliber track team could be counted in
single figures.
However, the lack of discipline, spirit for competition, and de
votion to the sport of track as a testing ground for the rigors of
life hangs ominously and constantly over our team. No longer
can we compare ourselves to one another for standards of perform
ance on the track; we must elevate our thoughts to a world com
petition plane and accompany our high goals with an attack on
complacency, negative attitude on and off the field, and self-de
ceiving training habits. The time has* come to cease fussing and
fretting with our training like boys and begin to work like men;
undoubtedly, such a program will only stimulate academic en
deavors rather than hinder them because of the vigor and sense
of accomplishment such a plan has to offer.
The truth hurts, and if I have agitated or angered any of my
fellow teammates, it has only been done in hopes of revealing the
genuine desire of our team to support Coach Jordan and Coach
Strain to the letter, which we as team members have failed to
express for fear of becoming outspoken. In obligation to our
families, Stanford University, and our 1958 and future track teams,
I sincerely believe that we can meet the challenges of track and

It seems that Forrest saw the Cards in their shockers over San
Francisco and Oregon State. Now, of course, he's added another
look-see to his list, and probably still thinks they're unbeatable.
Even before his loss up here, Twogood said he thought maybe his
presence was a good-luck charm for llomie Dalhnar's team. Wonder I
it he'll show up in Long Beach Saturday when the Tribe plays Troy
again?

Letter from an Athlete
The following letter was personally delivered to me Friday. T!
may help clear away the haze surrounding attitudes and training
habits of Stanford athletes, in particular, members of the track team,
since it is that group which I've commented on several times in re
cent weeks. The letter-:
To Dick Barnes:
As a member of the 19f>8 Stanford track team, I feel obligated
to shed some light on the recent controversy that has been raging
within the Department of Athletics as a result of the new policy
introduced a year ago by our two exceptional track coaches, Pay
ton Jordan and Floyd Strain. It should he known that these, our
coaches, are not standing by their high ideals and standards alone
arid in opposition to the team members. On the contrary, the num
ber of track men here who would not support the coaches' plans
for building a national caliber track team could be counted in
single figures.
However, the lack of discipline, spirit for competition, and de
votion to the sport of track as a testing ground for the rigors of
life hangs ominously and constantly over our team. No longer
can we compare ourselves to one another for standards of perform
ance on the track; we must elevate our thoughts to a world com
petition plane and accompany our high goals with an attack on
complacency, negative attitude on and off the field, and self-de
ceiving training habits. The time has* come to cease fussing and
fretting with our training like boys and begin to work like men;
undoubtedly, such a program will only stimulate academic en
deavors rather than hinder them because of the vigor and sense
of accomplishment such a plan has to offer.
The truth hurts, and if I have agitated or angered any of my
fellow teammates, it has only been done in hopes of revealing the
genuine desire of our team to support Coach Jordan and Coach
Strain to the letter, which we as team members have failed to
express for fear of becoming outspoken. In obligation to our
families, Stanford University, and our 1958 and future track teams,
I sincerely believe that we can meet the challenges of track and
field and cease to make excuses for our Saturday afternoon per
formances.
Respect fully submitted,

A Rare Occurrence
There it is—the definite and in-writing statement of a Stanford
athlete that he and his teammates are behind their coaching staff.
It's a rare occasion when an athlete at any school will come out
and publicly make a statement of this nature—and at Stanford, it is
virtually unheard of. And why? I believe Keith Wallace hit the nail
right on the head when he said it was "for fear of becoming - out
spoken."
There's no doubt that Stanford breeds individualism in athletics.
Now individualism is certainly a worthwhile characteristic in many
fields and in some phases of athletics. But it's also true that there
has got to be teamwork if there's going to be success—and that goes
in even as individual a sport as track appears to be.
If Wallace is right in his statement that there are less than a
handful of dissenters on Payton Jordan's and Floyd Strain's- teams,
then there has been a big improvement from last year. And now!
maybe that improvement will catch on in other sports where it is
needed. There's no point in singling these sports or athletes out
ihey know where they stand.

Stanford liked what it saw of Jack Curtice nt the Shrine game
and so it hired him. The Shrine committee must have liked him, too,
because they've named him as head coach again next season. This
will be Curtice's third straight year on the West staff, and his sec
ond straight as the head man.
Not meaning to slight the Shriners, I hope he can't make it fori
the game maybe some excuse like a prior commitment in Pasadena.!

Statement from USC basketball coach Forrest Twogood before I
coming north last weekend: "As far as I'm concerned, the Indians
may have the best club in the country. At least they were unbeatable
when I saw them."

Francisco and Oregon State. Now, of course, he's added another
