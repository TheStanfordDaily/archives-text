# Indians Hit Road Again; Seek Southland Upsets
## 
### 
Tho Stanford varsity capers
will once again tako to tho road
this weekend to moot UCLA and
tho University of Southern Cali
fornia in double-header contests
Friday and Saturday. They will
moot the Bruins Friday night at
7:30 and the Trojans at 2 Satur
day afternoon so that tho latter
game can he televised locally.
Both g;imcs are being played in
tho Long Beach City College
Men's Gym.
First Meet
This will be tho Indians' first
encounter with the Uelans this
season. UCLA is presently in sec
ond place in tho conference after
beating Washington's Huskies,
67-62, last night, remaining one
half game behind California.
In tho series between the two
teams they are tied, the Indians
and the Bruins each winning 51
games over a 38-year period. A
win in this game would not only
hamper UCLA's chances of re
gaining the league lead but would
also put Stanford ahead in this
series.

The Trojans, whom Stanford
fans got a good look at last Fri
day night when SC was handed a
57-44 loss to all but eliminate
them from the league race, will
be out for revenge. They wore
defeated by the Indians' strategy
of holding onto the ball until a
clear shot presented itself, and
whether Coach Howie Dallmar
will again employ this strategy is
a matter for speculation.
Much at Stake
Both so u th er n teams have
much more at stake than the In
dians. UCLA especially, with an
8-3 league record, must win to
stay in contention for the league
title. A win for Stanford would
be another big upset to chalk up
for the Indians, who seem to be
playing the spoiler role this sea
son. WSC, with a 6-5 record, also
stands a slight chance of coming
out on top of the conference al
though ihey are practically elim
inated. If Stanford can once
again turn the trick and outre
bound the heavier and stronger
Trojans they will completely
knock them out of the race.

In tho series between the two
teams they are tied, the Indians
and the Bruins each winning 51
games over a 38-year period. A
win in this game would not only
hamper UCLA's chances of re
gaining the league lead but would
also put Stanford ahead in this
series.

The Trojans, whom Stanford
fans got a good look at last Fri
day night when SC was handed a
57-44 loss to all but eliminate
them from the league race, will
be out for revenge. They wore
defeated by the Indians' strategy
of holding onto the ball until a
clear shot presented itself, and
whether Coach Howie Dallmar
will again employ this strategy is
a matter for speculation.
Much at Stake
Both so u th er n teams have
much more at stake than the In
dians. UCLA especially, with an
8-3 league record, must win to
stay in contention for the league
title. A win for Stanford would
be another big upset to chalk up
for the Indians, who seem to be
playing the spoiler role this sea
son. WSC, with a 6-5 record, also
stands a slight chance of coming
out on top of the conference al
though ihey are practically elim
inated. If Stanford can once
again turn the trick and outre
bound the heavier and stronger
Trojans they will completely
knock them out of the race.
