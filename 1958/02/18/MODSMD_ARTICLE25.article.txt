! the day for Stanford's frosh has
i kethallers as they made a desper
ate last-minute drive to top the
Cal Cubs hut only managed to
narrow the losing difference
down to 51-45. This second meet
ing of the arch-rivals this season
was played on the local hardwood
last night.
Having been outscored tremen
dously in the second half and sit
ing on the low end of a 48-37
margin, the local yearlings
hounded back to score eight to
the Cubs' three in the last six
minutes hut time ran out. Again
l Stanford seemed to get that sec
ond-quarter jinx. The sinking of
only 8 out of 25 tells the Pa
pooses' sad story while Cal, be
hind the jump shooting of for
ward Ned Averback. boasted over
a 43 per cent shot completion av
erage.
Holding the team together,
i Redman guard Bub Bowling was
| uncontestably the best man on
I the court, dropping 20 through
j the hoop. He led his squad as
| they took the lead in the first
I half and held it considerably well.
During the first few minutes of
the tile Stanford looked like the
better quintet but everyone was
quite nervous. Scoring was held
down so that with eight minutes
left in the first half, the only
point at which the game was tied,
the score read 8-8.
A break came in the last min
utes of the half as top Cub team
scorer guard Earl Sch u 11 z
dumped in three in a row as the
team fed him the ball after steal
ing it handily from the locals.
Cal led 25-17 at the half.
Bowling's 20 were best for the
evening. Stanford's Bob Whelan
had 7 and Tom Norland 4.
Averback, Dave Stafford and
Schultz split the Cal shooting 15,
12 and 11 respectively.
"Just not enough time," com
mented Stanford coach Bill Turn
er after the close of the tilt. "We
might have done it if we'd had a
few more minutes but that Cal
burst at the end of the first half
hurt us."
The frosh will take a break un
til next Monday when they buck
le down to work out in prepara
tion for their next game with San
Jose Junior College here Feb. 28.
