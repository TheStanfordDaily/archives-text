# Missile Base Pact Settled
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP) The Unit
ed States, having completed ar
rangements for nuclear missile
bases in the British Isles, is now
negotiating for similar launching
sites in France.
State Department sources indi
cated the Anglo-American agree
ment may be signed and sealed
here today. It is expected to be
the pilot pact for arming other
NATO allies with medium range
rocket weapons.
The British bases, reported to
be four in number and strung
along Britain's eastern coast, are
scheduled to be armed with U.S.
Jupiter and Thor ballistic missiles
by the end of the year.
From Britain these 1500 -mile
missiles could conceivably reach
as far north into Russia as Arch
angel, just below the Arctic Circle,
and as far east as Odessa, on the
Black Sea. Moscow and Leningrad
would be within the fil ing radius.
Bases in France would provide
even deeper penetration.
Under the arrangement with j
Britain, the launching sites will i
be jointly controlled, information
from London is that Britain will
pay the $00 million cost of con
structing the sites and the United
States, in addition to providing
the weapons, will furnish Air
Force crews to man the sites ini
tially.
