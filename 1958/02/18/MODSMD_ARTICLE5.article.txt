# 'Conflict Causes Race Prejudice'

### Rita Robison 
"When the individual realistically acknowledges the existence
of certain basic value conflicts within himself and works to solve
them, then the principles of brotherhood may take on truer mean
ing."
This statement was one of the conclusions of the Stanford
YWCA Social Action Committee's studies of the psychological and
sociological aspects of brotherhood. These studies were made in
conjunction with National Brotherhood Week, now in its second
day.
According to the committee's findings, the conflicts which are
today at the base of discrimination and prejudice in the United
States may be in one sense a reflection of the basic conflicts in our
age-old American creeds.
The report points out that our country is said to have been built
on the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, and yet we have
witnessed the American success system flushing us and our pri
vate ambitions up the ladder past our "brother."
"In a country where the possibilities seem to be limitless," fear

of one another i.s constantly
present underlying the current
in tor racial problems."
Studies indicate that each in
dividual continually strives to
maintain his status at the ex
pense of others, if necessary.
"In this situation of constant
ly dehumanizing others, he can
never relax. He must paint the
object of his discrimination in
terms that will justify the
treatment he gives him. The
Negro becomes, for example,
"dirty black"; the Oriental,
"slant - eyed, shifty," and the
European, "a strange foreign
er."
Recent observations have
shown that the personality of
the prejudiced person is often
authoritarian in nature. He
may have submitted to a strict
and unsympathetic discipline

as a child, and recalls that his brothers and sisters were preferred
over him by his parents, as were his classmates by his teacher in
school.
"As an adult, he strives to maintain a position with the strong
and to constantly assert his right to be there. How better to secure
his 'belonging-ness' than to point to others around him who do
not?"
The committee report points out that for the Negro, for example,
the interracial conflict in America has created a problem of self
identity. "He is faced with having to accept as part of his own
cultural heritage the white man's image of him. Being both an
American and an American Negro leaves him searching for a per
sonal integrity.
"Yet facing the reality of his personal conflicts is the way in
which the Negro, or any other minority group, can find the impor
tance of his integral part in the American scene."
The report concludes, "When all people, minorities and majori
ties alike, honestly try to ascertain their personal values, then the
principles of brotherhood may become more than overblown
terms."

of certain basic value conflicts within himself and works to solve

"In this situation of constant
ly dehumanizing others, he can
never relax. He must paint the
object of his discrimination in
terms that will justify the
treatment he gives him. The
Negro becomes, for example,
"dirty black"; the Oriental,
"slant - eyed, shifty," and the
European, "a strange foreign
er."
Recent observations have
shown that the personality of
the prejudiced person is often
authoritarian in nature. He
may have submitted to a strict
and unsympathetic discipline

as a child, and recalls that his brothers and sisters were preferred
over him by his parents, as were his classmates by his teacher in
school.
"As an adult, he strives to maintain a position with the strong
and to constantly assert his right to be there. How better to secure
his 'belonging-ness' than to point to others around him who do
not?"
The committee report points out that for the Negro, for example,
the interracial conflict in America has created a problem of self
identity. "He is faced with having to accept as part of his own
cultural heritage the white man's image of him. Being both an
American and an American Negro leaves him searching for a per
sonal integrity.
"Yet facing the reality of his personal conflicts is the way in
which the Negro, or any other minority group, can find the impor
tance of his integral part in the American scene."
The report concludes, "When all people, minorities and majori
ties alike, honestly try to ascertain their personal values, then the
principles of brotherhood may become more than overblown
terms."

"When the individual realistically acknowledges the existence
of certain basic value conflicts within himself and works to solve
them, then the principles of brotherhood may take on truer mean
ing."
This statement was one of the conclusions of the Stanford
YWCA Social Action Committee's studies of the psychological and
sociological aspects of brotherhood. These studies were made in
conjunction with National Brotherhood Week, now in its second
day.
According to the committee's findings, the conflicts which are
today at the base of discrimination and prejudice in the United
States may be in one sense a reflection of the basic conflicts in our
age-old American creeds.
The report points out that our country is said to have been built
on the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, and yet we have
witnessed the American success system flushing us and our pri
vate ambitions up the ladder past our "brother."
