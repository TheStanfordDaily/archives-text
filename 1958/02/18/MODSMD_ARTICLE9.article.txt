# Late Indian Effort Fails To Halt California Bear; Buch Stars in 69-57 Win
## Hard Fought Battle Riddled With 40 Fouls 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
Two minutes of hot shooting by
A) Buch spoiled the difference last
night as California dumped Stan
ford, H7-.")9. in the Pavilion. The
loss was the Card cagers' second
to Cal this year, and it kept the
Bears on top in the close Pacific
Coast Conference title chase.
Howie Dallmar's club trailed the
Bears by just 3 points at half
time, but Bueh quickly altered the
situation as he tanked four field
goals and lifted Cal to a 10-point
lead two minutes into the second
period.
From then on, the Bears main
tained anywhere from a 6- to 14-
point lead as the Tribe could never
put together a sustained scoring
rally.
for Haga
Dick Ilaga led Stanford's val
iant bid wifli 13 points and a good
performance under the boards.
Jerry Thuesen also tallied 13 for
the losers. Game-scoring honors
went to Don Mcintosh and Bob
Dalton of the Bears, with 16 each.
Despite Buch"s splurge, the In
dians might have won had it not
been for sloppy floor play near the
end of the game.
They had crept to within 6
points of Pete Newell's squad, and
the clock still showed 2Vs minutes
to play. But then a couple of
throw-aways and a 3-second vio
lation gave the Bears the ball, and
they weren't about to lose it back.
Rough Battle
The game was rough all the
way, with 21 fouls called on Stan
ford and 19 on California. Cal
made the foul tosses pay off with
21 big points—and the Indians
made 2 more than that.
In the first half the Indians kept
close all the way. Haga opened
the scoring with a free throw, but
then Cal forged into a 9-7 lead
after six minutes of play.
At this point, the Cards threw
in 8 points to just 1 for the Bears,
and had their biggest lead of the
night. It didn't last long, though,
as Dalton got a quick 4 for Cal.
Tied Three Times
The score was tied three times
until Mcintosh put the visitors
ahead for good with a reverse
lay-in at the 3:47 mark. In an
other minutes the margin had
widened to 5 points, and it ap
peared as though the rout might
be on even before the intermis
sion.
But Paul Neumann and Haga
each sank a pair of free throws to
stem the tide, and score at half
time read 32-29.

Then came the end, so far as
Stanford was concerned. Buch hit
on a 20-foot overhead set shot,
then tanked a 12-footer of the
same variety. Neumann broke the
string with a charity toss, hut
then Buch took over again.
Two Setups
Earl Robinson spotted Buch cul
ling under the basket twice, and it
added up to 4 points for the Bears.
Robinson and Dalton each added
another deuce and gave Cal its
biggest margin of the night, 44-30.
Dallmar put in his second unit
and even tried ;i zone, but it was
all to little avail as the Berkeley
ites still had 11 points as their
lead with less than five minutes
to play.
John Arrillaga did his best to
narrow the margin at this point
as he poured through 7 digits. Six
points of the Cal lead were -still
left, however, and from here on,
poor floor play stifled the Indians'
last gasp.
The loss left the Cards 3-8 in
loop play and all alone in eighth
place.
