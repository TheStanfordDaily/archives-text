# Poli Union Puts Emphasis on Students
## 
### Joan Woods Associate Editor 
Political Union decided Mon
day night to sponsor fewer large
meetings and more small discus
sion groups in an effort to "lake
the emphasis off the speakers
and put it on the students."
The group debated for two
hours on the ways and means of
increasing student interest and
participation in campus political
affairs. To achieve this goal,
fewer but politically more im
portant figures will be invited to
speak at Union meetings, while
student debate will be fostered
in the Hopublican, Democratic
and Independent caucuses.
Procurement Bureau
Political Union members had
complained that the group was

degenerating to the level of a
"speakers' procurement bureau"
and losing sight of its primary
goal to foster student political
participation.
Student attendance at Politi
cal Union meetings has dropped
noticeably since the organization
was founded four years ago.
Much discussion centered
around the question of whether
the group should attempt to in
crease the numbers in attend
ance or to foster additional par
ticipation among the interested
few.
Interest Wanted
A Union member said: "We
don't want. 10,(MX) students who
don't care a about anything.
We want 10 interested students."*
Fred Sauls. Democratic caucus
chairman, said, "It's not our mis
sion to go out and preach the

necessity of participating in poli
tics."
One girl added, "It sounds like
we're feeding the students vita
min pills."
Sauls later commented, "We
don't have them [the crowds|
anyway, so we may as well kow
tow to the interested few."
Student Apathy
Members of the group spoke
often of student apathy toward
political affairs. One officer at
tributed this to the "oppressive
apathy" fostered by the Admin
istration toward political demon
strations on campus.
He pointed out the lack of
student demonstrations here as
compared with other campuses
during the Hungarian uprising,
and said students are worried all
the time "about what the Ad
ministration will think."

Pam Staley, Democratic cau
cus vice chairman/ asked if Uni
versity policy couldn't be chang
ed if the result tended to make
students afraid of political dem
onstrations.
Clarifies Policy
Political Union president Kil
burn MacMurraugh clarified
University policy by stating that
the Administration attempted to
keep Stanford from being asso
ciated in the public mind with
any one political view.
He said the University is more
lenient in this regard than most
and added, "Of course, they say
this is because no one cares here,
so there's no danger of anything
happening."
MacMurraugh recited the dif
ficulties of obtaining top-notch
political figures. He said the
number available is limited and

most are tied up in Washington
while Congress is in session.
Graceful "Out"
lie also pointed out that prom
inent people do not want to
speak here. "When they get our
letter, they think, 'How can I get
out of this gracefully?' " he said.
The Union tentatively has
scheduled talks by former Presi
dent Harry Truman, Socialist
leader Norman Thomas and Paul
Butler, chairman of the National
Democratic Committee, in the
next three months.
It was generally agreed to
limit the number of speakers to
these three instead of "grabbing
every undersecretary of tiddly
winks that comes through," ac
cording to Pat Pinkham, Union
vice president.
