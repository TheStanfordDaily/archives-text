# Are We Dull?
## 
### 
The POLITICAL Union held an "agonizing re
appraisal" session Monday night to decide if
Stanford students deserve to have an organiza
tion which permits them the free expression
and discussion of their political views, (iommon
complaints at the meeting were that the Union
is becoming a "speaker's procurement bureau,"
that the Administration fosters "oppressive
apathy" toward campus political demonstra
tions and that "no one cares."
The last complaint is, of course, the omni
present and basic one; ami perhaps an agoniz
ing reappraisal of student apathy is more to
the point, since this Stanford phenomenon
seems to be the guiding principle of most stu
dent. intellectual and <-111f 11 r;il activities.
Why is it that students of "the Harvard of
the West," as Stanford is chauvinistically and
fondly referred to in some quarters, are com
pletely disinterested in anything extracurricu
lar which has an intellectual stigma attached?
Are we intrinsically dull?
The Political Union is only one exanifje
hut certainly an important one. Politics has
always been one of the basic interests of the
complete, educated man in the English tradi
tion which America has supposedly inherited.
The celebrated Oxford Union, to which Stan
ford's Political Union has been compared, is a
forum of national prominence, and its views
arc considered by government leaders. I nfor
tunately, this English tradition has apparently
not penetrated beyond a few Ivy League col
leges.
Stanford students not only refuse to take part
in organized intellectual activities, but the
great majority are not even interested in attend
ing talks by prominent figures. Time and again
audiences at the Tuesday Series are composed
largely of Palo Alto residents.
Even the University's new program of paying
top-notch speakers top-notch prices is not get
ting results. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt's talk last
Friday was part of this program. Students were
given every advantage over outsiders, including
cut-rate tickets (something which is hardly
necessary at Stanford), hut still tin; audience
was made up mainly of Palo Alto dowagers.
A multitude of excuses for student apathy
immediately come to mind. Stanford is a coun
try college, isolated from the pressures and
realism of city life. But so are many colleges
w here student life is more dynamic. Vale. Dart
mouth and the University of Michigan are a
few examples.

Stanford is coeducational, a fact which pin
|.h asizes social hut not intellectual life. But
Harvard is also coeducational, to the extent
thai Radeliffe women lake Harvard courses.
One of the few reasons given which may hold
some Irulh is the fact that the quarter system
requires more exams and more regular work
and leaves students little time or energy to
participate in anything other than "relaxing"
activities. Proponents of this view point to
European universities, which give exams only
at the end of the year, allowing students more
leisure time.
The Administration has also heen hlamed for
banning controversial speakers and meetings.
However, it seems to us that the Stanford Ad
ministration is as liberal as most, and in any
case we wonder how many students would take
advantage of complete' political freedom" if it
were offered.
The Administration may well share some of
the hlame for student apathy, hut, il so, its
error could only he attributed to its admissions
policy; for the only logical reason we can think
of as the cause of student dullness is that we
arc dull that Stanford seeks to admit only the
sons and daughters of the liuuli' bourgeoisie
(and we all know how dull the bourgeoisie is!).
But this solution is one we hesitate to accept.
From all indications and statistics, Stanford
students have tremendous potential. Adminis
tration offices are full ol files 011 how intelligent
we are, and each new class has a higher average
IQ than the previous one. The faculty is one
of the finest in tin* country. The libraries, while
they have their faults, are among the best.
So the question remains, and it is a question
which is the core of the philosophy of educa
tion: How can students be taught to best uti
lize their potentialities? The faculty and the
Administration are doing all they can to answer
this question. We hope such student groups as
the Political Union, the 118 and the YWCA,
which could he vital, dynamic influences on
student intellectual life, will not give up under
the depressing weight of apathy, but will meet
il as a challenge.
Such groups can only push so much and
cannot force culture down the throats of the
student body. But their actions as a hard core
of student intellectual leaders can do much to
jerk us out of our complacency, teach us to
utilize our individual resources and tin* fine
facilities Stanford puts at our disposal, and
thus make a great university even greater.
