and Misery of the Third Reich."
The presentation portrays six
scenes from the lives of the Ger
man people living during Adolf
Hitler's rise to power.
Author Brecht was a German
writer who was strongly opposed
to Hitler's regime. The feeling
was mutual, for he was listed in
the No. 5 position on the Nazi
death black list. He escaped from

His writing differs from that of

background details of the lives he
portrays.
