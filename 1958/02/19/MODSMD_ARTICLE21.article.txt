# Tonight at the Symphony
## 
### Margot Zeiss 
Isaac Stern, one of violindom's
all-time greats, will star with
Leonard Rose (replacing Gregor
Piatigorsky) as guest cellist to
night. in Johannes Brahms' "Dou
ble Concerto for Violin and Cello."
This concerto, Brahms' fourth
and last, was written in 1887, in
his 54th year. Tight in construc
tion and muscular in utterance, it
is Brahms in his late period. The
drama of its conception and econ
omy of its presentation have puz
zled audiences through the years.
Soloing in J. S. Bach's "Con
certo in A Minor for Violin and
Orchestra," Stern will bring to
that complex and demanding work
the power and delicacy for which
his playing is justly famous.
Bach's violin concertos are the
earliest specimens of that form in
cluded in current repertoires. He
brought every technique he touch
ed very nearly to its ultimate ex
pression, and it is no wonder that
the pre - classical violin concerto
culminates in his scores.
Rose will play "Variations on a
Rococo Theme for Cello and Or

chestra," by Peter Tchaikovsky.
A tremendously emotional com
poser, Tchaikovsky's source of
popularity lies in his ability to
convey the full strength of his
emotions to the listener. Critical
controversy over his music re
veals more about the disputants
than about the composer. For
those sympathetic to his outlook,
Tchaikovsky is profoundly mov
ing.
A modern piece programed for
tonight is William Schuman's
"Credendum" (Articles of Faith).
Sehuman belongs to the more vig
orous school of younger American
composers. Neither foreign nor
frantic, his music contains a forth
right clarity, a virility about it
that captures the immediate in
terest of an audience.
Orchids to Enrique Jordd for
his stellar presentation of Schu
mann's "C Major Symphony," the
bright spot in last week's pro
gram. Doubtless this work was
the best performance we have
ever heard from the San Fran
cisco Symphony.
