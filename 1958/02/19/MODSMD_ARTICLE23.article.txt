A couple of weeks ago this columnist stepped aside from his own
feelings to let "A Lady with a Gripe" tell you that she was peeved
at the way Stanford students were reacting to basketball games.
And in her gripe she included some of Ihe ideas of the yell
song girls, the band and the student body in general.
On many of her points she and I were on the same plane, but
there were a couple of places where she and I parted company, my
feelings being that she had gone a little overboard in the red-hoi
variety. ,
TIIK DAY FOR CREDIT but as long as today will be a day for
giving credit to some of the people involved in that gripe, let's start
with her. I think her sounding off as she did had something to do
with a marked change of support and attitude in the Indians'' last
two home games. But I don't think she alone is responsible.
For as much as he took a hint from what she had to say Ed Bor
denkircher deserves his share of congratulations. But I for one don't
believe that Ed had actually been at fault before her letter. It's true
that we hadn't been active supporters (vocally anyway) before that,
but I would attribute that to a much more pronounced and active
rooter-sluggishness that pervades the campus. . .
And I further believe that Bordenkircher is to be congratulated
for his efforts to combat this feeling. It was my pleasure to talk
to him after 1 thai gripe first appeared and at that time I learned
that he was actually engaged in a battle to counteract this spirit, or'
non-spirit as the case actually is. And it isn't an easy job.
After the USC and Cal games no one had a complaint, though,
not even this woman. Saw her on Monday and she wanted to say
that she thought "Everyone has done a good job. We had more yell
ing, still had th<» band and the pompon girls, and everything was in
the right proportion." And in this connection she is 100 per cent
correct.
ONE QUESTION —and this is a relatively important one. Was
the exceptional caliber 1 of these two games more responsible for
the change in attitude than anyone's change of attack plans? Granted
they were two of the most rousing contests we've seen this year. No
doubt they had something to do with the change, but I don't think
this is the entire answer. Even if we don't keep up support at the*
full pitch throughout the remaining three games, and do manage
1o keep some of it, we will have taken a step in the right direction.
LEFT HER OUT!! Yesterday's Daily pointed out someone we
overlooked in our discussion of sports personalities beyond the cam
pus. Powder-puff skier Jerene Vix has managed to do well for her
self. Her performance in the Reno Winter Carnival is just one of
her marks.
Jerene is able to boast that she's never placed below third in any
of the meets she's entered, except the nationals. In the nationals,
though, she's posted tenth- and sixth-place marks. She's well known
around the California-Nevada regionals, having held second and third
places in those events. And skiers in Stockton are still trying to
wrest the city championship from her there.
* She's busy this weekend, too, I understand—teaching people to
ski. A pretty cool angle to work, guys, when looking for a date.
BASEBALL AROUND THE CORNER Thank somebody, they
say, for it looks like the days of running up and down the stadium
stairs are through for a while at least for Coach Dutch Fehring's
diamond hopefuls. Fehring's squad got to play their first game, an
intrasquad struggle, Saturday and things were looking up on the
diamond.
You can see the team for yourself this Saturday in the alumni
struggle at the Sunken Diamond at 2:30. Stanford's Jack Shepard
will be coaching the alumni squad of some 27 notables and he and
Dutch promise a good game. (Check tomorrow's Daily for details.)
The big word for the alums is that as many of them who show up
will get a chance to play in the game, Relief, you know for these
guys haven't been out running stadium stairs lately.
