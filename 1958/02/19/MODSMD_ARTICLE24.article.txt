# Cards Prep for UCLA
## 
### 
The unpredictable .Stanford basketball squad
will have their hands full this Friday night when
iliey come up face to face with the PCC's second
best team, UCLA. The Bruins, remaining one-half
game behind leader California in the tight league
race, can afford no losses at this stage of the game
and thus will be putting out their best effort as
time for getting back in the lead is running out.
in conference standings the Bruins have an 83
record, losing only to Oregon State, California and
Idaho, the three teams which are still in conten
tion with them for the title. Only five games are
left on the Uclans' schedule, two of them with
Stanford, one each with contenders California and
' Oregon State, and the last with a strong Washing
ton team which they clowned by only five points
Monday night. Thus a Stanford win would greatly
hamper their chances.
Many Holdovers
Four starters from the Bruin team of last year
which wound up second in the league at season's
end have returned to this year's squad. They in
clude seniors Jim Halsten, Ben Rogers and Con
rad Burke, and junior Walt Torrence. As of last
week 6-6 center Rogers and Torrence, an All-Coast
guard candidate, were tied as the team's leading
scorers with 13.1 averages per game.
Torrence, returning from a sensational sopho
more year, where he was second in scoring only
to UCLA's All-Coast guard Dick Benton, is a tiger
in the guard position which he shares with Denny
Crum, a transfer from Pierce JC. At the begin
ning of the season he was expected to be the
team's top scorer and so far he has lived up to
this prediction.

Halsten, a for ward who can switch off occasionally to guard, is
also a threat. Very strong off the boards and the number three man
in the scoring department on the Bruin team with a 10.3 points per
game average, Halsten is a man to be watched.
Forward Burke figures to be a strong rebounder also, coming
down with the ball off the boards an average of 7.2 times per game.
Greatly improved over last year, this 6-5 senior is currently fifth top
scorer on the Bruin team.
Johnson Surprises
Rafer Johnson, the world's record holder in Ihe decathlon, who
played four games with the frosh team three years ago and then quit
to concentrate on his decathlon activities, has returned to the squad
this season and was the big surprise last week. He came*off the
bench with a spirited performance against California, scoring 10
points, rebounding well and flashing lots of drive and hustle. He
could be a key man in the Bruin attack.
Statistically speaking, .Rogers is leading the squad in free-throw
shooting with 58 out of 75 for a .733 percentage; reserve forward
Roland Underhill leads in rebounding with 138 for a 7.7 average per
game, and Rogers is ahead in field-goal'shooting among the first
stringers with 89 out of 221 for a .403 percentage.
Indian Coach Howie Dallmar plans to use the same starting
lineup against UCLA as he did Monday night against Cal, with
Gerry Thuesen and John Arrillaga at forwards, Dick Haga at center,
and Paul Neumann and Doug Warren at guards. It was Dallmar's
comment that the Cards could possibly take this one with the right
breaks, but that UCLA's depth far outweighed that of Stanford and
the decision would count heavily on the ability of Stanford's reserves
to come through in the clutch.

race, can afford no losses at this stage of the game
and thus will be putting out their best effort as
time for getting back in the lead is running out.
in conference standings the Bruins have an 83
record, losing only to Oregon State, California and
Idaho, the three teams which are still in conten
tion with them for the title. Only five games are
left on the Uclans' schedule, two of them with
Stanford, one each with contenders California and
' Oregon State, and the last with a strong Washing
ton team which they clowned by only five points
Monday night. Thus a Stanford win would greatly
hamper their chances.
Many Holdovers
Four starters from the Bruin team of last year
which wound up second in the league at season's
end have returned to this year's squad. They in
clude seniors Jim Halsten, Ben Rogers and Con
rad Burke, and junior Walt Torrence. As of last
week 6-6 center Rogers and Torrence, an All-Coast
guard candidate, were tied as the team's leading
scorers with 13.1 averages per game.
Torrence, returning from a sensational sopho
more year, where he was second in scoring only
to UCLA's All-Coast guard Dick Benton, is a tiger
in the guard position which he shares with Denny
Crum, a transfer from Pierce JC. At the begin
ning of the season he was expected to be the
team's top scorer and so far he has lived up to
this prediction.

Halsten, a for ward who can switch off occasionally to guard, is
also a threat. Very strong off the boards and the number three man
in the scoring department on the Bruin team with a 10.3 points per
game average, Halsten is a man to be watched.
Forward Burke figures to be a strong rebounder also, coming
down with the ball off the boards an average of 7.2 times per game.
Greatly improved over last year, this 6-5 senior is currently fifth top
scorer on the Bruin team.
Johnson Surprises
Rafer Johnson, the world's record holder in Ihe decathlon, who
played four games with the frosh team three years ago and then quit
to concentrate on his decathlon activities, has returned to the squad
this season and was the big surprise last week. He came*off the
bench with a spirited performance against California, scoring 10
points, rebounding well and flashing lots of drive and hustle. He
could be a key man in the Bruin attack.
Statistically speaking, .Rogers is leading the squad in free-throw
shooting with 58 out of 75 for a .733 percentage; reserve forward
Roland Underhill leads in rebounding with 138 for a 7.7 average per
game, and Rogers is ahead in field-goal'shooting among the first
stringers with 89 out of 221 for a .403 percentage.
Indian Coach Howie Dallmar plans to use the same starting
lineup against UCLA as he did Monday night against Cal, with
Gerry Thuesen and John Arrillaga at forwards, Dick Haga at center,
and Paul Neumann and Doug Warren at guards. It was Dallmar's
comment that the Cards could possibly take this one with the right
breaks, but that UCLA's depth far outweighed that of Stanford and
the decision would count heavily on the ability of Stanford's reserves
to come through in the clutch.
