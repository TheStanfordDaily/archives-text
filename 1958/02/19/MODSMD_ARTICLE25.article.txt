# RAIN FACTOR
## Golf Outlook Bright With Many Strong Contenders 
### Russ Coombs 
Stanford's golf learn, with hard
work and a few good breaks, could
be a definite contender for both
the Pacific Coast Conference and
NCAA crowns, according to coach
Bud Finger. And he should know
as well as anyone, having played
on two national champion teams
and coached one during his time
with Stanford.
In the 10 years Finger has been
golf coach here, Stanford's fair
way followers have finished sev
enth or better in the NCAA tour
nament! eight times. This year,
however, some tough problems
face him and the team if it is to
I continue its excellent record.
Recent rains have put the golf
course in unplayable condition,
putting a damper on the team's
practice for a while. With the
first match — against the Penin
sula Golf and Country Club, Feb.
28 —less than two weeks away, it
is imperative that the golfers get
their games in top shape.
Depth is a great asset to any
athletic team, but Finger has al
most too much of it this year.
Competition on the ladder has
been so fierce that Jim Rowley, a
consistent performer on last
year's varsity and a member of
the team that went to the NCAA
tournament in 1956, is currently
22nd on a team that fields a six
man squad.
In order to play his six best
men in the matches, Finger will
organize playoffs among the most
likely golfers for each match.
This, of course, excludes such
regulars as Bill Seanor —current-

ly first man on Iho ladder, last
year's No. 1 man and individual
runner-up in the 1957 Northern
Intercollegiate. Ho and .others,
•such as Alt Burtleson, Bob Dither,
Bernie Magnussen and Woodgie
Reich, are sure to be near the top
consistently.
Stanford will have some advan
tage in the PCC tournament this
year, since the tourney is sched
uled to be played on the Stanford
Golf Course, May 23-24. By that
time, the golfers should have had
enough practice (If the rains let
up) to play 1 heir home course
well enough to be a strong threat,
even against rugged competition
from such schools as Seattle, San
Jose State, Fresno State and USC.
USC is especially loaded with
links wizards. Bob McAllister,
who won last year's individual
PCC title with a fine 283 for 72
holes, is playing for them, as is
Bud Bradley, a former USGA jun
ior champ. A 1 Geiberger, a past
national jaycee junior champion,
adds to their already strong
squad.

squad.
Stanford's golf learn, with hard
work and a few good breaks, could
be a definite contender for both
the Pacific Coast Conference and
NCAA crowns, according to coach
Bud Finger. And he should know
as well as anyone, having played
on two national champion teams
and coached one during his time
with Stanford.
In the 10 years Finger has been
golf coach here, Stanford's fair
way followers have finished sev
enth or better in the NCAA tour
nament! eight times. This year,
however, some tough problems
face him and the team if it is to
I continue its excellent record.
Recent rains have put the golf
course in unplayable condition,
putting a damper on the team's
practice for a while. With the
first match — against the Penin
sula Golf and Country Club, Feb.
28 —less than two weeks away, it
is imperative that the golfers get
their games in top shape.
Depth is a great asset to any
athletic team, but Finger has al
most too much of it this year.
Competition on the ladder has
been so fierce that Jim Rowley, a
consistent performer on last
year's varsity and a member of
the team that went to the NCAA
tournament in 1956, is currently
22nd on a team that fields a six
man squad.
In order to play his six best
men in the matches, Finger will
organize playoffs among the most
likely golfers for each match.
This, of course, excludes such
regulars as Bill Seanor —current-

ly first man on Iho ladder, last
year's No. 1 man and individual
runner-up in the 1957 Northern
Intercollegiate. Ho and .others,
•such as Alt Burtleson, Bob Dither,
Bernie Magnussen and Woodgie
Reich, are sure to be near the top
consistently.
Stanford will have some advan
tage in the PCC tournament this
year, since the tourney is sched
uled to be played on the Stanford
Golf Course, May 23-24. By that
time, the golfers should have had
enough practice (If the rains let
up) to play 1 heir home course
well enough to be a strong threat,
even against rugged competition
from such schools as Seattle, San
Jose State, Fresno State and USC.
USC is especially loaded with
links wizards. Bob McAllister,
who won last year's individual
PCC title with a fine 283 for 72
holes, is playing for them, as is
Bud Bradley, a former USGA jun
ior champ. A 1 Geiberger, a past
national jaycee junior champion,
adds to their already strong
squad.
