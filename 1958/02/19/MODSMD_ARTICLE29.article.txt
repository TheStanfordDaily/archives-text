## 
### Jerry Wisot 
Hiding modestly behind the
jfence surrounding the men's
swimming pools is perhaps one
of the finest freshman swimming
teams in the United States today.
Stanford's frosh tankers boast a
long list of former high school
! All - Americans, record holders
and champions, all of whom,are
capable of turning in great per
formances even under heiivy
t pressure.
Under the direction of Coach
Tom Haynie, who also roaches
: the varsity squad, the Papoose
swimmers are presently engaged
in preparation for their 12-meet
! schedule which will get under
; way later this month. Haynie
| stated that it would be a relative
ly easy schedule, due to the ex
cellence of the Stanford squad.
He even went so far as to state:
"This year's freshman team is
one of the finest freshman teams
I've ever s£en. I sincerely believe
j that if they were matched against
; the varsity, they would have a
I darn good chance of beating
I them."
Harrison Highly Ranked
George Harrison is the most
j highly • ranked member of the
frosh' squad. Although his spe
cialty is the butterfly, Harrison
was a member of the 19HG Olym
pic team that went to Australia
entered in the 800-meter freestyle
j relay.
He was also a member of the
United States team that met Ja
pan there in 1955 and the same
year won the National AAU 400-
meter individual medley relay.
Also a specialist in the butter
fly and the freestyle sprint is
John Jurgensen from Lawrence
ville Academy who holds the NC
AA record in the 100-yard butter
fly.
Good Depth
Haynie then went on to men
tion several others of the out
standihg swimmers: Jim Cooper,
ihe Arizona state champion in
the orthodox breaststroke; Fred
Fahlen, the Arizona state cham
pion in the 100-, 200- and 220-yard
freestyle events; Charles Raven,
a 100-yard freestyle specialist
who was an All-American on the
Exeter Academy team; Mike Zel
ler, another All-American sprint
er from Kent field in Marin Coun
ty; and Steve Jackson, an All-

who was rated the number one
prep diver in the United Stales
I last year, and who, Haynie stated,
lis a potential national champion.
Season Opener
The season will begin for the
frosh on Feb. 28 with the High
| School Relays which will he held
here. After that they will par
| ticipate in the AAU meet at San
j Jase on March 1 and then meet
Palo Alto High, Menlo JC, Fres
-1 no and Los Altos Highs, San Jose
| State frosh, Vallejo JC, San Le
| andra and Hayward Highs, Uni
versity of California frosh, St.
I Mary's College. Arden Hills Swim
Club, and California once more
to finish out their season.
The Arden Hills Swim Club,
which they will meet here on
May 10, will probably give them
| their biggest test. This group is
| composed of recent college stars
who are no longer participating
;in the intercollegiate program.
"Other than that," said Haynie,
' "there is no reason why they
| should not easily take the rest of
their scheduled dual meets."
