# Improved Varsity Meets San Francisco St. Wrestlers
## 
### 
Stanford's best chanee for a wrestling victory this year comes to
night at 7:30 when the Indians take a short road trip to meet San
Francisco State.
The rebuilding program which the Indians have been working on
this quarter will begin to pay dividends tonight when the Cards

field a full team for the first time
in several weeks.
On the debit -side of the ledger,
however, will be the absence of
the team's best performer, heavy

weight Karl Hufbauer. He dis
located his collarbone last time
out and will be lost for the season.
Stanford's eight-man team will
be made up of George Ong in the
123-pound bracket; Hugh Vorhis,
130; Allan Jones, 137; Keith Mo-
Farland, 147; Bill Dudman, 157;
Bruce Edelson, 167; Mike Minock,
177. and Pete Papworth, heavy
weight.
The Gators have had problems
similar to the this year in
so far a-s injuries are concerned,
so the meet is expected to be
pretty close to a toss-up. Aiding
Stanford greatly will be the fact
that they won't have to forfeit
any matches, as has been the case
so often this year.
