# Anne Humpherys Earns Editor's Post on Sequoia
## 
### 
Anne Humpherys was announc
ed last night as the new editor of
Sequoia. The editorial board of
seven members and the editor se
lected her on the basis of a letter
which all nominees had to write
stating their policies.
Miss Humpherys has worked
for seven summers as a reporter'
on her home town daily, the Idaho
State Journal. She comes from
Pocatello and was editor of the
school paper while in high school
there. %
Atine is a junior and a creative
writing major. She plans to at
tend graduate school, and she says
she would like to write for pub
lication.
Non-fiction is Miss Humpherys'
specialty in writing, but she has
never contributed to Sequoia.
Only two editorial board members
have contributed during the past
two years. She has been a piem
ber of the board all this year and
worked in the office last year.
Future plans of the new editor
are to make Sequoia, grow and
never stagnate into a "stereotyped
routine with the same format in

every issue." Her ultimate goal is
to have contributions brought in
instead of having everything so
licited.
A non-fiction specialist herself,

Anne believes that, since there
are no courses for such writing.
Sequoia has a duty to encourage
it. However, not only non-fiction
but also fiction and art work of
any kind are now being accepted
for publication in the next issue.
The present policy of publish
ing one work of a well-known au
thor, poet or artist will be con
tinued under the new administra
tion. The next issue, which will
come out March 3, will feature an
article by David Reisman from a
speech he gata at Cornell Univer
sity on college students.
The editorial board also an
nounced a new promotion on the
general staffâ€”Louise Bowen to
art editor.
