# Old Boy Tardy Again or Yet??

Lateness and the Chappie are
synonymous this year.
Trying to find an excuse for
his organization's disorganization,
Editor Jim Gleason said that the
Chappie's second number of 1958
will be late because the first one
was late.
At any rate, the pulp will ap
pear on sidewalks and in trash
cans Feb. 2fi and not today as
printed in the Social Calendar.
