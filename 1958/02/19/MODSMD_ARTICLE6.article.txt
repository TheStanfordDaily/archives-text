# Equal Advantage Needed For Brotherhood Spirit
## 
### Rita Robison 
"We ate not expressing broth
erhood until the minority groups
experience equal economic oppor
tunity and until we are willing to
accept the Negro into the most
personal of relationships — the
house next door."
These words arc taken from an
investigation into the rising eco
nomic status of the Negro in the
nation and in the Palo Alto area
made by a graduate student in
economics, who is also a member
of the "Y" Social Action Commit
tee. This report was submitted as
part of the National Brotherhood
Week program.
Rising Standard
The report states that every
one's standard of living has risen
considerably since 19.'59 and that
the Negro's earnings have im
proved relative to the
white worker's. Yet, it is noted,
the Negro is still usually the Inst
hired and the first to be fired.
The labor shortage of World
War 11 saw a renewal of the Ne
gro migration from farms to cit
ies, after it had been halted by
the depression. Between 1940 and
1017, two and three-quarter mil
lion non-whites left their homes,
and most were attracted to the
centers of war-time 'production,
the cities of the North.
Population Hose
"San Francisco's population
rose 1 V-t times during this period,
and California's Negro popula
tion is now second to New York's,
outside of the Southern states."
Sheer war-time necessity, the
report explains, opened many
jobs previously closed to Ne
groes, and the emergency condi
tions saw the start of the first ef
fective efforts of the federal gov

ernment and the states to combat
employment discrimination.
In the prosperous post • war
economy, Negroes have held fast
to these gains, and figures show
that by 1950 the average Negro's
wage was 52 per cent of the aver
age white worker's as compared
with only 40 per cent in 1939.
Opportunities Needed
"If this proportion is entirely
explained by the extent to which
Negroes are usually employed in
the less skilled and lower pair!
.jobs, then better educational op
portunities and the chance to be
acefited, once having trained for
a skilled job, are needed if the
N'cgro is to be given equal eco
nomic activity."
As Nee roes have sought hous
ing outside ghettoes in the post
war years they have not always
been accepted and integrated in
the neighborhood, claims the re
port. This may be due, it is sug
gested, to the fear that the non
white's arrival will automatically
bring falling property values a
myth, asserts the report, that has
been used by unscrupulous real
tors to create panic selling in the
neighborhood.
Owners' Opinions
"It is, of course, not the pres
ence of a minority group but the
degree to which present owners
succumb to such rumors, that
lowers the property values."
Regarding the Palo Alto area,
the report reveals that in Belle
Haven, an area of 1200 homes in
Mcnlo Park, the population is es
timated to be 70-80 per cent Ne
groes.
"Realtors were able to •create
hysterical panic selling by per
sonally visiting homes and sug
gesting that the property be sold
before prices fell further.
Attract Negroes
"While persuading white peo
ple to sell at falling prices, they
were attracting Negro buyers by
advertisements in San Francisco
Negro newspapers and eye-catch

ing offices on Bayshore. The real
tors make high profits not only
from the commissions of a very
rapid turnover, but by buying
houses themselves at low prices
and reselling to Negroes at high
prices."
To combat this action in Phila
delphia, slates the report, field
workers' have visited potential
panic areas, and by presenting
successful examples and reason
ing with an originally hostile au
dience, they have often been able
to bring stability and sense to a
neighborhood.
Two Sad Facts
The report advises that two sad
facts remain. The Negro who
wants to buy a house has to face
a realtor who often will sell him
property only in an area already
predominantly Negro, and who
will be encouraging white people
not to move into this area. Typi
cally, new houses are but reluc
tantly made available to Negroes,
and mortgages on all houses are
difficult to obtain and very ex
pensive.
The report continues with the
observation that if a Negro tries
to buy a house privately he will
he told that it has been sold,
when he knows quite well that
this is not the case.
Also, it happens that when the
Negro applies for a job, he will
often be told that it has been ta
ken and then find that it is still
advertised the following week.
"These are the ways in which
we may one day find ourselves
expressing a lack of the spirit of
Brotherhood."
