## Uniformity School Snag For Asia 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Attempts at uniformity with
other universities were stressed
is a major problem of a univer
sity in an underdeveloped country
by Dr. T. H. Silcock in an address
to last night's Tuesday Evening
Series audience.
Speaking primarily about uni
versities in southeastern Asia, Sil
cock said "universities suffer
from pressure toward uniformity
in the market for scholars, in com
petition and in standards for de
grees which depend on recogni
tion from other countries."
"Because of the high number of
historically colonized regions in
Asia," continued Silcock, "many
of the universities are modeled
from the metropolitan countries'
universities." For example, uni
versities in the Philippines follow
the American university setup.
Three Problems
Silcock listed three other main
problems of the universities —
drainage of intelligence from un
derdeveloped countries to more
advanced ones, difficulty in at
tracting faculty talent for recruit
ment and little time for research.
"There is a tendency for many
college graduates to go into gov
ernment work over and beyond
research," he added.
Ah for students, the "underde
veloped countries can't offer ade
quate inducements for graduate
work," said Silcock.
No Quick Solution
Silcock could see no immediate
solution for solving the problem
of making the individual commu
nity realize the importance of
having an individual university of
high standards; a place where
scholars from throughout the
world can converge without being
forced to bring uniform stand
ards.
"Within the community there
should be a study of how the aca
domic process works when the
range of material changes and so
cial conditions and building prob
lems change," suggested Silcock
as a solution. "Then it would be
possible to find the needs of the
community in relation to the uni
versity."
