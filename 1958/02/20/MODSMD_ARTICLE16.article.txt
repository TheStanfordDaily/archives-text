# Commission Interprets Code: Exams to Remain in Test Room
## Instructors Asked to Stay â€˜In Vicinity' of Test Room 
### Roger Folsom 
Students* may not take tests from the examination room at any
time without the instructor's permission, if alternate seating is avail
able. Tests include both questions and answers.
Yesterday afternoon the Fundamental Standard and Honor Code
Commission clarified and reaffirmed a decision which tho student
body made by referendum in 1053: "Provided that alternate seals
are available, tests will be taken from the classroom only with the
consent of the instructor."
According to the now interpretations, when alternate sealing i.
available students who take any part of a test from the room for
any reason, without permission, have violated the Honor Code.
However, the Commission recommended that instructors keep a

copy of the test with them during
the exam, so that it would not be
necessary for students to remove
tests in order to ask questions
about ambiguous or unclear ques
tions.
In the past, in spite of 195.7s
referendum decision, students
have been confused as to whether
they could take examinations out
side of classrooms into more com
fortable surroundings.
Whether the word "tests" in
the ASSU By-laws means ques
tions, as well as blue-books, has
not been made clear.
Commission members pointed
out that although the faculty
handbook on the Honor Code
states that instructors should re
main "in the general vicinity" of
the classroom during the test, in
practice, many instructors "wait
in their offices on the other side
of quad on the top floor." This
makes it difficult for students to
get ambiguous or blurred ques
tions explained.
The Commission requested that
faculty members stay close to
the examination room They
agreed that it should not be nec
essary for instructors to return
to the room halfway through the
test, if they were located npar by
as they are supposed to be.
One member said: "If we ask
the instructor to return to the
room during the examination,
afternoon.- d 4 jf.
students will think that he is
checking up on them. This should
be avoided."
