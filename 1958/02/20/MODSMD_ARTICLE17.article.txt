KHARTOUM, Sudan (Tliurs
day 1 (/P) Sudan announced early
today it will ask the UN Security
Council to act on the Sudanese-
Egyptian dispute over a border
area which both claim.
Officials said Egypt had ivjec't
ed Sudan's proposal made in Cairo
that Egypt not hold a plebiscite
in the area Friday. A plebiscite is
being held throughout Egypt then
to name Egypt's President Nasser
as President of the new United
Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria.
Sudan coupled this proposal
with a suggestion that it go ahead
with Sudanese parliamentary elec
tions in the area Feb. 28 as sched

tempt to use that fact to prejudice
the case.
The government rejected two
Egyptian proposals about the
areas in which Sudanese polling
should be held, Sudanese officials
said.
An Egyptian source said the ne
gotiations may be resumed, but
stressed that Egypt plans to go
ahead with the voting Friday un
less a settlement is reached. He
said an armed clash is "unthink
able."
