# POLI UNION
## Past Aide Lauds Life Of Trotsky 
### Diana Smith 
Socialist Joseph Hansen, ad
dressing the Independent caucus
of Hip Political Union yesterday
on his experiences as Leon Trots
ky's secretary, called Trotsky h
man with absolutely unique sin
gleness of purpose.
Everything Trotsky did was
aimed at his primary goal of turn
ing capitalism into a socialist
economy, II a 11 se 11 commented.
Trotsky considered it a shame
that civilized man should have to
expend so much energy putting
his economy in working order,
and was full of determination to
finish the job and move on to
more interesting things.
Hansen has sustained a lii'elong
interest in Socialist theories and
activities, and accepted a position
as secretary to Trotsky in his
Mexican exile from 1937 to 1940.
He worked closely with Trotsky
in his writing, in the close per
sonal relationship of the same
household.
Most impressive about Trotsky,
Hansen believes, was his intelli
gence. An alert listener to every
one, his questions were always
searching. Hansen recounted an
ecdotes illustrating Trotsky's lap
id capacity to learn and his amaz
ing memory.
Almost more overpowering
than Trotsky's intelligence was
his will power, said Hansen Nev
er. for instance, did he relinquish
his battle with the Stalinist secret
police, even after his son's murder
in Paris.
The first assault came May 'M,
1910, when Mexican Communists
disguised as Mexican police forc
ed their way into the house at
night and raked Trotsky's bed
room with machine-gun fire.
Trotsky and his wife, Natalia, es
caped by rolling out of bed in the
dark.
Daily thereafter Trotsky said i'i
his wife, "Another lucky day;
we're still alive," but never lost
his vitality.
Trotsky was finally assassinat
ed later in 1910 by a Communist
agent disguised as a Socialist
seeking Trotsky's advice on a
manuscript. Trotsky considered it
his duty to help the man, explain
ed Hansen, which was typical of
this friendly and personable man.

Most impressive about Trotsky,
Hansen believes, was his intelli
gence. An alert listener to every
one, his questions were always
searching. Hansen recounted an
ecdotes illustrating Trotsky's lap
