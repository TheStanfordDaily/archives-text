# Unique Proposal
## 
### 
A UNIQUE proposal lor averting a crisis in col
lege overcrowding has been set forth by an
eastern educator.
"Take women oul of cocducational col leges,"
urges I'hilip Ward Burton, a Syracuse t niver
sity professor, iu a recent magazine article.
in defense of his radical proposal, Burton
claims that men need a college education more
than women do. lie apparently lias been swept
away by the demand for engineers and scien
tists and has forgotten, or ignored, lb at women
are unoving into thee fields and a re filling more
technical rides than ever before. Ihe training
necessary for these positions is more intensive
and more specialized than can be obtained at
the women's colleges and junior colleges which
Burton savs are adequate lor a woman's edu
cational needs.
Upon graduation from a college or univer
sity, today s woman has, according to a recent
survey, an expectation ol 2> years of gainful
employment ahead of her. Whether entering
technical fields or oilier areas, she must he
trained if she lo do her job well; ami, as she
will be in competition with men, il is only fair
that she receive the training a man receives.
While Burton would not dens the woman
interested in science an opportunity to study
her chosen subject, in drastically cutting the
number of women in the coeducational college
he would place those lie would permit to attend
in the unfortunate position ol isolation from
others of their sex. While insisting that they
devote all time and energy to study, Burton
forgets that more and more women today are

homemakers us well as career women. To cut
I lie woman student off from other women whose
interests, while not so technical, are still im
portant to ihe advancement of social culture
would narrow her outlook and make her lose
sight of the other aspects of living in society.
The educator acknowledges that women are,
on the whole, more conscientious students than
men. Yet he wants to take them out of compe
tition with men in the classroom. The exchange
i)l viewpoints derived from different hack
grounds and different feelings toward life is
one of the challenging aspects of a coeduca
tional institution. Burton would have us avoid
this stimulating experience.
Burton questions the motivation of women
in college and quotes the oil-heard statement,
"The college is the world's hest marriage mart."
While women are not averse to finding a hus
band while they are in college, they are also
looking further ahead I<• the time they will
he culled to lead in educational and cultural
positions in the community. The background
necessary for these pursuits cannot he obtained
in the junior college to which Hurton would
assign women, for, no matter how fine the junior
college, it can only afford a cursory coverage
nl subjects subjects needing intensive study if
we are to avoid turning into a society of narrow
outlook and achievement.
There is no question that the overcrowding
of colleges and universities is becoming a serious
problem, but careful planning and expansion
is the answer not removing women from the
college Campus.

There is no question that the overcrowding
of colleges and universities is becoming a serious
problem, but careful planning and expansion
is the answer not removing women from the
college Campus.
A UNIQUE proposal lor averting a crisis in col
lege overcrowding has been set forth by an
eastern educator.
"Take women oul of cocducational col leges,"
urges I'hilip Ward Burton, a Syracuse t niver
sity professor, iu a recent magazine article.
in defense of his radical proposal, Burton
claims that men need a college education more
than women do. lie apparently lias been swept
away by the demand for engineers and scien
tists and has forgotten, or ignored, lb at women
are unoving into thee fields and a re filling more
technical rides than ever before. Ihe training
necessary for these positions is more intensive
and more specialized than can be obtained at
the women's colleges and junior colleges which
Burton savs are adequate lor a woman's edu
cational needs.
Upon graduation from a college or univer
sity, today s woman has, according to a recent
survey, an expectation ol 2> years of gainful
employment ahead of her. Whether entering
technical fields or oilier areas, she must he
trained if she lo do her job well; ami, as she
will be in competition with men, il is only fair
that she receive the training a man receives.
While Burton would not dens the woman
interested in science an opportunity to study
her chosen subject, in drastically cutting the
number of women in the coeducational college
he would place those lie would permit to attend
in the unfortunate position ol isolation from
others of their sex. While insisting that they
devote all time and energy to study, Burton
forgets that more and more women today are

homemakers us well as career women. To cut
I lie woman student off from other women whose
interests, while not so technical, are still im
portant to ihe advancement of social culture
would narrow her outlook and make her lose
sight of the other aspects of living in society.
The educator acknowledges that women are,
on the whole, more conscientious students than
men. Yet he wants to take them out of compe
tition with men in the classroom. The exchange
i)l viewpoints derived from different hack
grounds and different feelings toward life is
one of the challenging aspects of a coeduca
tional institution. Burton would have us avoid
this stimulating experience.
Burton questions the motivation of women
in college and quotes the oil-heard statement,
"The college is the world's hest marriage mart."
While women are not averse to finding a hus
band while they are in college, they are also
looking further ahead I<• the time they will
he culled to lead in educational and cultural
positions in the community. The background
necessary for these pursuits cannot he obtained
in the junior college to which Hurton would
assign women, for, no matter how fine the junior
college, it can only afford a cursory coverage
nl subjects subjects needing intensive study if
we are to avoid turning into a society of narrow
outlook and achievement.
