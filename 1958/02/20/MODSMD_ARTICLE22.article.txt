Editor, The Daily:
Although not as pxpei ienced in Hip arl of letter
writing as Mr. Ilaas, I shall iry to clarify some
of the misconceptions in his letter of last Friday.
First, Stern Council lias not voted to form "eight
amorphous fraternit > houses." The house plan is
merely an extension of the present wing setup
and is necessary because of the growth of Stern
to over GOO men by next year.
Second, the so-called rushing pamphlet men
tioned is still in the discussion stage. If published,
it would aid those freshmen who had decided on
Stern and w< re i h'oosing which wing to move into.
The "( Jung ho' piopaganda would he information
such a« the dues officers and physical plan) that
the wings have. I can't at this time outline the
rest of the plans which arc slill in the discussion
stage, but I can assure you that much.considera
tion and a lot ol planning have gone into how
best to protect a person' true individuality.
In closing, I extend an invitation to Mr. Haas
to drop by and get the facts the next time some
thing bother 1 ; him, before ho writes his next
letter.

Editor, The Daily:
I am grateful to the Wilbur excom member,
Dick Lande for clarifying the administration's
attitude on the subject ol the outrageous fire

alarm fines in effect at Wilbur. This clarification
points out nicely the evil intrinsic in the adminis
istration's fining policy.
A false alarm involves a certain expense to the
fire department; the use of equipment and the
paper work involved are doubtlessly considerable.
It is proper that Wilbur, or any other residence,
is collectively responsible for the actual expenses
involved. However, since Wilbur is obviously nol
collectively guilty of the offense, any sort of col
lective fine is out of the question. A fine is a
penalty imposed on a person whose guilt is es
tablished.
The fact that the profits of the fine are used
for "major lounge improvements" is highly ir
relevant to the issue of fining. If the adminis!ru
lion seriously feels the need of student eontribu
tions, there should be shme provision about volun
tary gifts. That a fine is put to a good purpose
does no! change the nature of the fine itself.
Another interesting aspect of the present situ
ation is that Wilbur students were falsely in
formed as to the use [to which] their "fines" were
to be put. There can be no valid excuse for a
fining policy of dubious nature to be foisted on
students without informing them of essential
facts.
Collective fining is a bit complicated, and its
effectiveness is hard to determine, but it clearly
has been incorrectly applied in the case of Wilbur
fines. I do not know whether similar fining pro
cedures are present in other administrative poli
cies on campus; if they are, I think they should
he carefully reviewed and, if possible, eliminated

paper work involved are doubtlessly considerable.
It is proper that Wilbur, or any other residence,
is collectively responsible for the actual expenses
involved. However, since Wilbur is obviously nol
collectively guilty of the offense, any sort of col
lective fine is out of the question. A fine is a
penalty imposed on a person whose guilt is es
tablished.
The fact that the profits of the fine are used
for "major lounge improvements" is highly ir
relevant to the issue of fining. If the adminis!ru
lion seriously feels the need of student eontribu
tions, there should be shme provision about volun
tary gifts. That a fine is put to a good purpose
does no! change the nature of the fine itself.
Another interesting aspect of the present situ
ation is that Wilbur students were falsely in
formed as to the use [to which] their "fines" were
to be put. There can be no valid excuse for a
fining policy of dubious nature to be foisted on
students without informing them of essential
facts.
Collective fining is a bit complicated, and its
effectiveness is hard to determine, but it clearly
has been incorrectly applied in the case of Wilbur
fines. I do not know whether similar fining pro
cedures are present in other administrative poli
cies on campus; if they are, I think they should

of the misconceptions in his letter of last Friday.
First, Stern Council lias not voted to form "eight

merely an extension of the present wing setup
and is necessary because of the growth of Stern
to over GOO men by next year.
Second, the so-called rushing pamphlet men

it would aid those freshmen who had decided on
Stern and w< re i h'oosing which wing to move into.

the wings have. I can't at this time outline the
