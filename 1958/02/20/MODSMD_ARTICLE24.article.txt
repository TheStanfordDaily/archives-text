The Emerald also quoted the renowned Ameri
can poetess Marianne Moore as saying about
censorship:
"No, 1 don't believe in censoring. We can't be
sure what to censor and once yon start it's like
a prairie fire. The most obscene poetry will die
quickly if it's simply left alone "

A Point to Ponder from the Rocky Mountain
Collegian:
"There are only two ways to be unprejudiced
and impartial. One is to be completely ignorant.
The other is to be completely indifferent. Bias
and prejudice are attitudes to he kept in hand,
not attitudes to be avoided."*—Charles P. Curtis
in a Commonplace Book.
