# Campus Opinion

### Jack Winkler 
The yearly arguments that
arise over 1 women's social regu
lations bring into question the
very principle of pulling living
restrictions on college women.
Stanford men have always had
the freedom to come and go from
their dormitories and houses as
they wished, to keep their own
hours and choose their residence
off-campus if they wished.
To students selected at random,
The Daily asked the question,
"Should women he allowed to-live
off campus?"
Elizabeth Hodder, I.agunita,
'59 "Certainly. 1 would like the
freedom to decorate my room as
I wish, keep a dog or cat as a pet,
and not have to push visitors out
at 10:30."
Dan Newell, Phi Kappa Sigma,
T>B "IVo. The initial break from
the family in coming to college
makes women want more inde
pendence and detracts from both
social and educational interests."
• Evelyn Griswold, F lore ii c e
Moore, T)8 "Seniors should be
allowed to live where they please.
It would be a good experience for
graduating women. The other
three classes should be integrated
on campus."
Mary Swift, Union, '<>0 "Defi
nitely yes. Although on-campus
housing is a convenience to some,
there is no real reason for mak
ing it a requirement for all.
There are many people who feel

the present situation infringes on
their independence."
Jim Sobieski, Delta Upsilon,
'58 — "Upperclass women should
be able to. By the time they get
to college they should know what
they want and be able to take the
consequences."
Dick Dreyfus, Wilbur, '61 — "An
18-year-old woman who would
not go to college is old enough to
he on her own. A Stanford wom
an is supposed to be more intelli-
gent and more mature than the
average American woman. So
by these standards, she should be
old enough to lake care of her
self."
Susan Garbett, Lagunita, '60 —
"Yes, all except freshmen should
be allowed to live off campus.
The Fundamental Standard and
the Honor Code make us respon
sible women, so it should be a
matter of individual choice."
Keith Torney, El Toro, '59 —
'"Since Stanford men are consid
ered mature enough to live off
campus, the Stanford woman
should have the same respect
paid to her."
Fran Monson, Union, '60 — "I
think senior women should defi
nitely have the choice of living
off-campus. Obviously there are
advantages (for the freshmen
and the socially oriented) in a
residence campus, but making
this rule mandatory for all
classes is preposterous."
