# Stairway to Nowhere Recalls Stanford's Past
## Manorial Arch Claimed to Rival Are de Triomphe 
### Rich Brown 
Did you over wonder about
stairways which lead to no
where?
San .Jose's Winchester Mystery
House is not alone in claiming
such mysterious flights of steps.
For right on Une Stanford cam
pus is an iron stairway which
spirals upward some 25 feet and
comes to a dead end.
What's more, this dust-covered
stairway is at the, front of the
Quad and Memorial Court. How
ever, it's hidden inside a dark,
oval - shaped well which rises
above the office of Alpha Phi
Omega, service fraternity.-
Unlike the Winchester steps
which never had meaning, Stan
ford's stairway once had a pur
pose. For until 190(5 it conveyed
students and visitors to a van
tage point 100 feet above the cam
pus in old Memorial Arch.
Bird's-eye View
As Hoover Tower does for pres
ent generations, the arch provid
■d the bird's-eye view to those
>112 the Victorian and Edwardian
>ras. Only Memorial Church
tower was higher but it was not
equipped for sightseers.
At least one person remembers
watching from atop the arch as
Mrs. Stanford's funeral proces
sion passed beneath in 1905.
The Gay Nineties were nearing
a close when ground was broken
April 15, IcS99, for Memorial
Arch, another monument to Le
land Stanford Jr.
"The Arch is rightly called a
memorial'," said the San Jose
Mercury, "for . . . memorials are
histories unfinished, and the
great unfading pile of masonry
stands firm to tell coming gener
ations of the unfinished history
of a young life . . ."
Largest Arch
Claimed as America's largest
arch and second largest in the
world only to the Arc de Tri
omphe in Paris, Memorial Arch
was 90 feet wide and 3! feel thick,
in addition to its 100-foot height
The archway was 51 feet high, T1
feet wide.
A 12-foot-high sculptured
frieze, planned by Augustus St.
Gaudens, circumscribed the arch
and depicted "The Progress oJ
Civilization in America."
"Above the frieze is a corbeled
arch course terminating in a par
apet wall four feet above tin* fire
proof roof," the Stanford Regis
ter of 1905 notes.
Winding Stairs
Blueprints reveal stairways
winding up both legs of the arch
to a double - deck observation
room and then continuing to the
roof.
The observation room had win
• lows along the'side and a large
skylight above. A well in the
floor permitted light to reach the
lower level of the room.
Did Memorial Arch ever have
an elevator? One old-timer says
it did, but none can be found on
t no blueprints. Perhaps plans
were under way to install such a

convenience when the San An
dreas fault gave a nudge on April
18, 1.906.
Like particles from a Fourth
of July sparkler, bricks showered
outward from Memorial Arch.
Debris crashed down the two
stairwells, banging loudly as it
hit the iron steps.
In a few seconds it was all over
- and"The Progress of Civiliza
tion" now depicted destruction
and desolation.

First repair plans called for
cutting the arch down in height
but soon it was decided to demol
ish it down to its two supports.
The arch's two legs were cap
ped over with tile and today the
west one houses the A Phi O
headquarters, while the east leg
contains the Student Guide Serv
ice.
The steps were removed from
the east support (Guide Service
office) but for some unknown

reason remained in the west leg.
Access to the stairway is made
by climbing through a hatch in
the false ceiling. A Phi O mem
bers, however, don't advise the
use of the stairs since an occa
sional step is missing and electric
lights are conspicuously absent.
Perhaps A Phi O should build
a lookout atop its headquarters.
At least Stanford's "stairway to
nowhere" would again have a
definite objective!
