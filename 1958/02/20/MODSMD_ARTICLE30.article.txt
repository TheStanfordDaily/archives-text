# LARGEST PUBLIC CAMPAIGN
## Funds for Medical Center Near Goal of $22 Million 
### Sallyanne Durr 
•Problem: enough money lo build Medical Center walls and roofs
capable of encompassing 12'- aeres of space, to furnish endowment
for faculty salaries, to furnish the buildings.
Solution: $22 million.
With this need in mind the Stanford Medical Center Fund Com-

mittee early last year kicked off
a public campaign to raise $ft mil
lion in California. By December
$5 million was pledged.
According to Lyle E. Cook, ex
ecutive secretary of the fund, this
campaign was "the largest public
campaign undertaken in Califor
rtia. with the exception of the
United Crusade and the United
War Fund." Appeals to the Cali
fornia public resulted in contribu
tions totaling over $2'- million;
from corporations almost $2 mil
lion was received, and the remain
dor was given by foundations.
Stanford's general and medi'-al
school faculty contributed great
ly. Especially noticeable is the
contribution of the medical school
alumni. They have reached 1 12.'»
per cent of their $370,000 goal and
are' currently raising money for
two professorships of $350,000
each.
(The professorships will be in
memory of Dr. George Harnett.
Stanford Medical School professor
for 25 years, and lb'. Arnold L.
Blumfield, executive head of the
Department of Medicine, emeri
tus. )
Alumni (Jive
The average gift of medical
alumni approached $1.10. In some
areas in California, such a-s Whit
tier, the average gift has been
over $1000. In Sacramento 50
medical alumni, who had that
year contributed to two other hos
pital campaigns, gave $15,000 to
the Medical Center Fund.
Steel, oil. utility and electronics
industries have been the biggest
corporation contributors. "In 19.>7
over $1 million was given Stan
ford by corporations for unre
stricted use," commented Cook.
This was in addition to what they
gave the Medical Fund.
Thus corporation, individual
and foundation contributions have
accounted for one - third of the
needed money which will com
plete I he first stage of the Medi
cal Center plans. But what of the
remainder?
The four buildings designated
for stage 1 are scheduled to be*
completed during the summer of
1959. To date $15,826,000 has been
collected for this project. Major
gifts, in the form of bequests
from individuals not contacted
during the campaign (including a
$3 million grant from the Ford
Foundation), and government
grants for the construction of re
search facilities and a rehabilita
tlon center have enlarged the
sum.
Total in Sight
Roughly $0 million is all that
is needed lo complete the fund,
and Cook feels that this remain
der is clearly in sight.
Gifts to the fund vary greatly
in size. The biggest single gift
was contributed by the Roscoe
and Margaret Oakes Foundations

a gift of $985,000 earmarked for
the construction of radiology and
biophysics laboratories in the hos
pital and medical school.
Upon the raising of the $22 mil
lion and the completion of the
first stage of the Medical Center
on campus, Stanford University
will have taken an initial siep
toward a new concept of educa
tion for medicine.
"The move to the campus will
bring medical education into a
true university environment," said
president Wallace Sterling. "Clos
er relationships with the liberal
arts and sciences will broaden the
education of medical students;
! Ihev will also introduce a flow of
| the knowledge and values of med
icine into the education of other
J students.
Building of the first stage in
cludes the 215-bed Stanford Hos
pital, medical school buildings
including clinical teaching facili
ties. outpatient clinics and reha
| bilitalion center and new build
ings for the Lane Medical Library.
Fndowment Funds
Of the $22 million, million
will be used for endowment funds.
I Said Cook, "We are seeking to
strengthen the medical faculty
i and to place ourselves in a posi
tion of paying better salaries."
'I he second stage of the Medical
Center plans covers future needs.
Approximately a 10-year program,
it is designed to house medical
school departments that are now
on campus, such a-s anatomy, mi
cro-biology and physiology; to pro
vide residential accommodations
for medical students, and lo ex
pand the medical library. In addi
-1 lion, further endowment funds
I will be sought.
