"...And Cod Created Woman"
may be the title of the current
attraction at the Park Theater,
but one wonders if the original
Kvc had as many delightful
charms to display as docs Brigitte
Bardot.
One tiling for sure, Miss Bardot
has a lovely sun tan and it isn't
restricted to llie parls of her cov
ered by a bathing suit. This is
evident from- the opening scene.
Juliette, portrayed by Miss Bar
d<>t. is a not quite innocent girl of
about IT years who is occupied
with the eternal quest for happi
ness, which lo her is synonymous
with love which to her is synon
ymous will) sex.
Love, sex and happinc.-s are all
strangely inlerlwincd into I heal
fairs of three brothers, the second
of which is genuinely in love with
her and who marries her lo pre
vent her being sent back lo I toe
orphanage from whence she came.
The husband, played by
Louis Trinligant, is one of the
more genuine characters in the

movie. Shy, sensitive, overshad
owed by the apparent ease and
good looks of.his older brother, he
eventually brings Miss Bardot to
the realization of happiness.
Curt Jurgens plays the role of
the rich, scheming businessman
who has a not too platonic in
tercst in the affairs of Miss Bar
dot. His acting is certainly not a*s
convincing as that portrayed in
''The Devil's General" or "Enemy
Down Below."
Hut certainly Miss Bardot is the
central attraction, and the other
plays are just incidentals pawns
for her sensual whims.
