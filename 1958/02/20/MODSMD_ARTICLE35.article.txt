Y,u- ve picked your profession— engineering.
You plan to practice with llie company of your
choice.
I>ut will the company you join recognize you
as a professional man? Will it give you pro
fessional responsibilities? Will you be given
challenging assignments?
If you pick General Motors — and General
Motors picks you for one of the many different
kinds of engineering work involved in pro
ducing our hundreds of different products —
we have reason to think you will.
For to us. engineering is a profession.
Not only at our GM Technical Center—but in
every one of our 35 divisions and 126 plants
in 71 cities and 19 states, it is recognized as
such.
This professional recognition is shown in
minor ways —like putting you on an annual
salary, n.ot an hourly rate. And — like giving
you \ aeations with pay.
It is shown in major ways. too.
It is shown in the fabulous GM Technical
Center near I)ctroil, dedicated to the advance
ment of engineering and science, equipped

with every conceivable research facility.
Shown in the encouragement given you in
pursuing advanced degrees. Shown by the
fact that so many key men throughout
General Motors are engineers.
How far can an engineer go in General
Motors? There is no limit — literally. For
example, 11 out of 33 Vice-Presidents are
engineers, 23 of 42 Division General Man
agers are engineers. These men were in your
' shoes not so many years ago.
Today, General Motors is looking-for young
engineers who may fill these executive posi
tions in the years to come. If you're the kind
of man we're looking for — the kind of man
who wishes to practice his engineering pro
fession—let ns hear from you. It could be the
most important letter of your life.

Y,u- ve picked your profession— engineering.
You plan to practice with llie company of your
choice.
I>ut will the company you join recognize you
as a professional man? Will it give you pro
fessional responsibilities? Will you be given
challenging assignments?
If you pick General Motors — and General
Motors picks you for one of the many different
kinds of engineering work involved in pro
ducing our hundreds of different products —
we have reason to think you will.
For to us. engineering is a profession.
Not only at our GM Technical Center—but in
every one of our 35 divisions and 126 plants
in 71 cities and 19 states, it is recognized as
such.
This professional recognition is shown in
minor ways —like putting you on an annual
salary, n.ot an hourly rate. And — like giving
you \ aeations with pay.
It is shown in major ways. too.
It is shown in the fabulous GM Technical
Center near I)ctroil, dedicated to the advance
ment of engineering and science, equipped

with every conceivable research facility.
Shown in the encouragement given you in
pursuing advanced degrees. Shown by the
fact that so many key men throughout
General Motors are engineers.
How far can an engineer go in General
Motors? There is no limit — literally. For
example, 11 out of 33 Vice-Presidents are
engineers, 23 of 42 Division General Man
agers are engineers. These men were in your
' shoes not so many years ago.
Today, General Motors is looking-for young
engineers who may fill these executive posi
tions in the years to come. If you're the kind
of man we're looking for — the kind of man
who wishes to practice his engineering pro
fession—let ns hear from you. It could be the
most important letter of your life.
