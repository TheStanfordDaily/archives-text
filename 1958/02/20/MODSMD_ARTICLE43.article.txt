### Jerry Wisot 
Last time Hit* Stanford basketball team played
in a double-header I hey scored what might bo
called the biggest upset on the West Coast this
season by downing the mighty University of San
Francisco. This weekend they will once again
play in a double-header, this time with UCLA and
the University of Southern California. Whether
or not history will repeat itself is a matter of
speculation until tomorrow night.
Tip off time for the game with UCLA will be
7:'5M p.m. tomorrow. This will precede a contest
between USC and Oregon State. The I ISC-Stan
ford game will be televised locally in the South
land and therefore will start at 2 p.m. Saturday,
preceding an important Oregon State-UCLA game.
All contests will lake place in the Long lieaeh City
College Men's Gymnasium.
This will he Stanford's first encounter wilh the
Tiniins who are hoping to score a sweep this week-

Despite a cracked rib injury suffered in Mon
day nigld's game with California, Indian for
ward llick ffaga will make the Southland trip
lids weekend with no change in the plans to use
him as a starter.
Injuries of this sort are easily protected and
not unusuul and it is expected that Ifaga xvill
have little trouble in Sniogville.
The itinerary for the Southland trip calls for
the Card squad to leave campus at p.m. today,
with I light time to IJ A. set for-1:80. While down
south tin- tram will stay at the Disneyland Hotel
in Anaheim. Arrival time in San Francisco oil
Sunday will be at 12:10 p.m.

end to remain in content ion lor the league title.
The Indians, with much less at stake, will he try
ing to score number four in the upset siring they
have started this season and at the same time
trying to improve their seventh-place, 3-8 confer
ence standing.
The Bruins, on the other hand, are presently in
second place in the league, only one-half game
behind leading California. They will be trying
in protect their 8 3 conference record as well as
trying to take a lead in the 38-year-old series with
the Cards which presently stands at 51 games
apiece.
use is presently tied with Idaho for fourth
place in ihe conference with a 6-5 record after
being handed a decisive 57-1-1 loss by Stanford last

Friday night.
Although they an? pretty far
out as far as gaining the lead in
the league is concerned, they still
have a slight chance, and will be
out for a chance to get even for
the scalping they received from I
an unusually efficient Indian
team.
Stanford will probably start the
same five that went against USC
and California last weekend with
Jerry Thuesen and John Arril
lapa at forwards, Dick Ilaga at
center, and Paul Neumann and
Doug Warren at guards. Coach
Howie Dallmar also expects to
be relying quite heavily on re
serves Mike Tipton, Chris Bur
ford, John Stabler, John Pflueger
and Neal Broekmeyer.
Spearheading the UCLA attack
will be Ben Rogers, Walt Tor
rence, Jim Ilalsten and Conrad
Burke all returning starters from
last year's second - place PCC
squad. It is expected that the
Bruins will be quite strong off
the boards, and the Indians will
have to go some to stand up to
them in this department.
The Trojans will feature mus
cular 0 7 Jim llanna, who leads
the squad in rebounds, in the cen
ter position, and dead • eye for
wards Jim I'ugh and Jim White.
Although Stanford out-rebounded
S<' in the game here, they expect
a tougher time on the Trojans'
home court.
Coach Dallmar was bothered
mostly by the Indians' lack of
depth since both of the other
teams are strong in this respect,
lie indicated, however, that the
Cards have come up once in a
while with great ball playing and
if this is the case this weekend
they eon Id well pull of the upset
they are hoping for. s

U;AI>K ATTACK—PCC field goal leader Dick
Huga will be out to equal the 17 points lie bas
keted in the Indians' upset of the Southern Cal
Trojans last week when the same two squads
meet in the Southland this weekend.
Last time Hit* Stanford basketball team played
in a double-header I hey scored what might bo
called the biggest upset on the West Coast this
season by downing the mighty University of San
Francisco. This weekend they will once again
play in a double-header, this time with UCLA and
the University of Southern California. Whether
or not history will repeat itself is a matter of
speculation until tomorrow night.
Tip off time for the game with UCLA will be
7:'5M p.m. tomorrow. This will precede a contest
between USC and Oregon State. The I ISC-Stan
ford game will be televised locally in the South
land and therefore will start at 2 p.m. Saturday,
preceding an important Oregon State-UCLA game.
All contests will lake place in the Long lieaeh City
College Men's Gymnasium.
This will he Stanford's first encounter wilh the
Tiniins who are hoping to score a sweep this week-

Despite a cracked rib injury suffered in Mon
day nigld's game with California, Indian for
ward llick ffaga will make the Southland trip
lids weekend with no change in the plans to use
him as a starter.
Injuries of this sort are easily protected and
not unusuul and it is expected that Ifaga xvill
have little trouble in Sniogville.
The itinerary for the Southland trip calls for
the Card squad to leave campus at p.m. today,
with I light time to IJ A. set for-1:80. While down
south tin- tram will stay at the Disneyland Hotel
in Anaheim. Arrival time in San Francisco oil
Sunday will be at 12:10 p.m.

end to remain in content ion lor the league title.
The Indians, with much less at stake, will he try
ing to score number four in the upset siring they
have started this season and at the same time
trying to improve their seventh-place, 3-8 confer
ence standing.
The Bruins, on the other hand, are presently in
second place in the league, only one-half game
behind leading California. They will be trying
in protect their 8 3 conference record as well as
trying to take a lead in the 38-year-old series with
the Cards which presently stands at 51 games
apiece.
use is presently tied with Idaho for fourth
place in ihe conference with a 6-5 record after
being handed a decisive 57-1-1 loss by Stanford last

Friday night.
Although they an? pretty far
out as far as gaining the lead in
the league is concerned, they still
have a slight chance, and will be
out for a chance to get even for
the scalping they received from I
an unusually efficient Indian
team.
Stanford will probably start the
same five that went against USC
and California last weekend with
Jerry Thuesen and John Arril
lapa at forwards, Dick Ilaga at
center, and Paul Neumann and
Doug Warren at guards. Coach
Howie Dallmar also expects to
be relying quite heavily on re
serves Mike Tipton, Chris Bur
ford, John Stabler, John Pflueger
and Neal Broekmeyer.
Spearheading the UCLA attack
will be Ben Rogers, Walt Tor
rence, Jim Ilalsten and Conrad
Burke all returning starters from
last year's second - place PCC
squad. It is expected that the
Bruins will be quite strong off
the boards, and the Indians will
have to go some to stand up to
them in this department.
The Trojans will feature mus
cular 0 7 Jim llanna, who leads
the squad in rebounds, in the cen
ter position, and dead • eye for
wards Jim I'ugh and Jim White.
Although Stanford out-rebounded
S<' in the game here, they expect
a tougher time on the Trojans'
home court.
Coach Dallmar was bothered
mostly by the Indians' lack of
depth since both of the other
teams are strong in this respect,
lie indicated, however, that the
Cards have come up once in a
while with great ball playing and
if this is the case this weekend
they eon Id well pull of the upset
they are hoping for. s
