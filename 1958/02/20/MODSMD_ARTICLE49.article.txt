Braves take over the featured spot
in the Pavilion this week end with j
8 o'clock games against Mofl'ett |
Field Naval Air Station on Friday !
and Parks Air Force Base on Sal-!
urday. . ,
The..weak' Mofl'ett squad won't!
be much of a contest for the locals i
despite the loss of Tom Crawlord
and Phil Joujon-Roehe, who are
with the varsity down south.
Parks, however, is an unknown
and figures to give the Jayvces a
better run.
