## Third Reich Portrayed In German 
### Joanne Frye 
The tensions and anxieties of
two decades ago crackled across
the stage during the more con
vincing moments of the German
Club's production of "Fureht und
Fiend des Dritten Reiches" last
night at the Women's Clubhouse.
Robert Gottwald, exchange stu
dent from Berlin, directed club
students in seven scenes from tho
Bertold Brecht ]>lay. Records of
Hitler speeches and comments on
the times set the spirit of the
drama.
"The Jewish Wife," well por
trayed by B i r g i t Brock - Utile,
showed how a wife tried to pro
tect her husband by leaving Ger
many to go to Amsterdam. Con
centration camp inmates who
bickered with one another, and
yet wouldn't tell the guard who
started il, were finally hauled off
to be shot.
In "The Informer," Maynard
Seele showed the effect of never
being able to trust anyone even
his son until he finally grew so
tense that he even accused his
wife.
The play i-s particularly appro
priate because the "Fear and Mis
ery of the Third Reich" is being
continued in Fast Germany today.
One was left with the feeling of
hopelessness and no way to com
bat the situation except to say
"No" when the final curtain was
dropped.
