# NAACP Speaker Predicts 'Negro Voteâ€™ Will Disappear
## 
### 
" The Negro as a voting bloc in
American politics will disappear
as integration proceeds and bar
riers are broken down." Franklin
Williams, NAACP West Coast re
gion secretary counsel, said al a
VWCA Brotherhood Week talk
yesterday.
Discussing the political scene
as affected by the potential force
of votes, Williams said that as
soon as civ'il rights cease to be an
issue the "Negro vote" will lose
its identity and unanimity of
opinion and dissolve into the con
servative, reactionary, liberal and
extreme elements which any
group of voters contains.
Reviews History
Reviewing the history of at
tempts to suppress the Negro
vote, Williams discussed the 19th
century "grandfather clause" and
recent attempts to avoid register
ing Negro voters by requiring a
reading and interpretation of a
section of the Constitution to the
satisfaction of the registrar.
Fear and oppression keep
many of the Negroes in the
South from registering and vot
ing. said Williams. When Negro
names on voter registration lists
are made public, credit is cut off
and mortgages are foreclosed. In
an area operating on a credit sys
tem, the only choice available is
to remove one's name from the
list or move out.
Truman Policy
Williams continued that the
declaration of the Truman policy
in 1948, providing a firm stand
for civil rights, Changed the cli
mate of opinion in the United
States. It became less acceptable
to say, "I hate Negroes," than to
state, "I don't mind the Negro,
but I don't want him marrying
my daughter or living next to
me." Along with this climate is
a present trend of Negro voters
toward Republican leanings.

The future'of the group oppor
tunity of the Negro voting bloc,
.stated Williams, is in decisive
states such as California, ()hio
and Illinois, as evidenced in llieir
swinging of the 1956 election.
