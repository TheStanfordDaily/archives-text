## 
### 
None of yesterday's decisions by the Fundamental Standard and
I lonor ('ode Commission had any effect on its almost unknown inter
pretalion of last Nov. I 1:
"Mutual responsibility may be carried out equally well by discuss
ing the observed violation with the violator or by reporting him to

the judicial Council; the stu
dent's choice of these two meth
ods is dependent on his interpre
tation of I he situatiou."
In other words, in the Commis
sion's opinion it is no longer re
quired under the Honor Code's
mutual responsibility (formerly
known as third person responsi
bility! to report Honor Code vio
lators to the Judicial Council.
One needs only to discuss the
matter.
The Commission's decisions do
not have any force — they are
only advisory. The Judicial Coun
cil may ignore the Commission's
opinions.

Winbigler told The Daily earlier

"The student's first obligation
is to prevent cheating. Failing
that, his obligation is to report to
the Judicial Council any violation
that the student observes. Every
student must feel that lie has
more responsibility than for him
self. Honesty is the business of
everybody."

The student will not give or re
ceive unpermitted aid in any

Any student observing a viola
tion of the Honor Code may ei
ther speak to the violator in an at
tempt to get him to turn himself

in, or report the violation to Un
judicial Council.
The faculty should:
Retrain from all attempt.', to
proctor examinations, or take
any special steps to prevent dis
honesty.
Make sure that students know
what is "unpermitted aid'' in par
ticular courses.
Accept the word of students re
garding absence excuses foi class
