# 'Red Vest Band' Livens Up Smogland
## 
### Curt Russell 
The Stanford Basketball Band's
week end trip to Los Angeles for
the USC and UCLA games grit off
to an enthusiastic start wilh
songs and a "personalized" Grey
hound bus.
Beginning at Ihe band house at
7 a.m. Friday, the first project
was to give a more personal touch
to an otherwise ordinary bus. The
imaginations of Lanny Merrill,
Ron Toothaker and Russ Belts
were more than equal to the task,
and the bus waÂ« soon decorated
in a manner more characteristic
of its passengers.
Greyhound Lines was promptly
changed to "Hound Dawg Lines."
and such items as "Help Stamp
Out Automobiles," "S tanf ord
Band" and "Prince Lighthead and

His Yurok Rhythm Boys" were
added with bright red paint, while
manager Ed Best changed tho Los
Angeles sipji on Ihe front of the
hiis to read more appropriately
"Smogville." Fortunately the driv
er of the bus was a battle-weary
veteran of two previous band
trips and so was well familiar
with such displays of "esprit de
corps."
On the way many verses were
added to the Stanford Drinking
Song.
The bus arrived in Los Angeles
just at the start of rush hour.
Ventura Boulevard in Hollywood
was a mass of people and snarled
traffic as bystanders turned to
gape at the distinctive bus and
chuckled at the Smogville sign.
Members of Kappa Kappa Psi,

| baud fraternity, were met later on
iin the morning (after the sun
| rose) by members of the UCLA
j band, who took them to West-
I wood to reactivate the UCLA Kap
pa Kappa Psi chapter. After the
ceremony the fellows were Invited
to breakfast by the newly reacti
vated chapter.
The band's exuberance at the
USC game resulted in a rather
backhanded compliment from the
team. They reportedly a-sked the
pompon girls, "What's the matter
with the band? Are they drunk?"
"No, we don't think so," was
I the reply.
"Well, they played so well, yell
|ed so loud and seemed to be hav
ing so much fun doing it that we

thought they must be drunk," re
sponded the team.
The high spot of the trip was a
concert in Disneyland after the
Saturday game. The band rode
into the park on the parking-lot
tram car playing "Mickey Mouse"
and "Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off
to Work We Go."
The real concert was given at
the bandstand in the center of
Disneyland, under the direction of
Bill Spuck, with Prince Lightfoot
and the pompon girls also taking
part.
In addition to the nearly 200
people who gathered around the
band, the music was hear d
throughout the park by means of
the Disneyland public address sys
tem.
After the program the bands
men headed for the rides, with
their complimentary ticketbooks
clutched in their hands. As might
be expected, Prince Lightfoot
caused great interest in "Frontier
land."
Lightfoot met another member
of the Yurok tribe in the Knott's
Berry Indian reservation.
