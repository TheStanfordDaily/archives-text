Patient Hospitalized
According to Nelder, Pacheco
performed two operations on a
San Francisco housewife which

was hospitalized as a result of his
bungling, Nelder said.
The victim was on the critical
list in a city hospital, but yester
day Nelder said she is now "out
of danger."
Nelder said he learned Pache
co 'Â« identity from the woman and
managed to "plant" the informa
tion that there was a prospective
customer at the Ingleside district
home. The house was put under
surveillance.
"As Biif as Life"
Shortly after noon Saturday.
Nelder said. Pacheco arrived in a
car and parked about a half-block
away.
"Usually these people are very
secretive," Nelder said, "but this
kid came strolling down the street
and up to the door of the house
in that red-and-white jacket as big
as life."
Nelder arranged for the woman
who answered Pacheco's knock to
invite him in and talk about the
fee. Nelder said that during the
conversation Pacheco cited as a
testimonial to his ability the
housewife who, unknown to him,
had been hospitalized.
When he was arrested. Pacheco
said he was merely "looking for
the address of a girl I know,"
according to Nelder.
