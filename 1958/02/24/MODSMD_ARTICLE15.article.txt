# Communists in Syria May Go Underground
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (/P) —Syrian
Communists yesterday were re
ported to dive underground at a
moment's notice, fearing a crack
down from President Nasser of
of the new United Arab Republic.
Reliable sources say Nasser is
ready to clamp down on the Com
munists in Syria, now but a prov
ince in the U.A.R., just as he has
done in Egypt.
Nasser was elected president of
the U.A.R. in a plebiscite Friday
that united Egypt and Syria. He
got almost unanimous endorse
ment from the Syrian people. At
the same time he was given ex
traordinary powers to govern
Syria just as he has been running
Egypt.
When the merger was first pro
posed, Nasser insisted the grow
ing Communist Party in Syria be
banned. It was one of several
terms he demanded before he
would agree to the merger or to
take over the U.A.R. presidency.
The powerful Syria Baath Par
ty, which engineered the merger,
was happy to comply with this
demand. Left-wing but non-Com
munist, the Baathists were being
threatened by steadily increasing
Communist strength.
Knowledgeable Syrian sources
said in Damascus a clash between
the ruling Baathists and the Com
munists hastened the birth of the
U.A.R.
