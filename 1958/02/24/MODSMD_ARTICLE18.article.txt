Opportunity ftn- Thought
Editor, The Daily:
Dennis Gorman's articles in The Daily accuse
the Stanford student body of apathy. The lack
of an intellectual fever, we believe, may be at
tributed to the following conditions:
1. Over-emphasis on quantity rather than qual
ity of work. The typical undergraduate course
consists of frantically recording every word a
professor says in lecture, reading assigned
works in the R.8.R., researching for a standard
term paper, and spurting it all out as fast as a
pen will fill the pages of an examination blue
book. The consequence is too much time spent
on rushing and cramming, but too little time de
voted to thinking.
2. Insufficient opportunity for independent ex
pression on examinations. In some cases the
professor never reads bluebooks but delegates
this necessary job to a reader who must rush to
meet a deadline. Often the professor gives the
reader a key—"this is what I want." If the an
swer doesn't fit, it loses points.
3. Lack of an effort on the part of many pro
fessors to establish a personal relationship with
students. Only through understanding of a stu
dent's aspirations and interests can a professor
properly advise.
Admittedly these conditions are not always the
case but when students gather to complain, these
points invariably arise. We realize the continu
ing need for hard work and academic discipline
—but suggest that more "seminar-like" groups
be incorporated into student programs to corre
late with lecture courses. It is through an op
portunity for independent thought, research and
an interchange of ideas that active intellectual
interest will replace the apathy of which Gorman
writes.

"Can't Believe It"
Editor, The Daily:
I can't quite believe it. Did a member of the
Political Union, as quoted in Wednesday's Daily,
really say "students who don't care a about
anything"?
Well, maybe he did. I'd hate to accuse The
Daily of misquoting. But I'm curious; how did
he say it, exactly? Did he say "dash," or did he
say-"blauk," or did he just pause, or what?

Studies Corn pete with Activities
Editor, The Daily:
The author of the editorial in Wednesday's
Daily made the complaint that "Stanford stu
dents not only refuse lo take part in organized
intellectual activities, but the great majority
arc not even interested in attending talks by
prominent figures." He suggested as causes for
a lack of participation in these and other such
functions: (1) a small amount of censorship that
the Administration may exercise concerning con
troversial speakers and (2) that Stanford stu
dents are just dull sons and daughters of a dull '
bourgeoisie.
His subject was one that has bothered the
minds of us freshmen since our entering the
University last fall. Features that attracted us
to Stanford were the Political Union, the Tues
day Evening Series, lIR and student govern
ment, all designed to broaden our cultural and
intellectual background. Our great disappoint
ment is that we are so swamped with studies

night after night that wo have no lime In include
these.activities in our. daily schedule. If we arc
here in a University with such opportunities as
these, why should we be forced to miss them in
order to keep our routine grades on the upper
regions of the curve? Are not these additional
activities equally important in our making the
most of a college education?
We certainly do not feel apathetic toward such
activities. We recognize the value in an oppor
tunity such as hearing Eleanor Roosevelt. We
regret not being able to attend these meetings
because of competition with daily studies and
find this a disappointment to our anticipations
of Stanford and college life. This, we feel, is the
reason behind a lack of attendance at Stanford's
intellectual and cultural programs, and we feel
that the Administration and the author of Wed
nesday's editorial might do well to look further
into the situation in this light, with less concen
tration on the ridiculous idea that we are apa
thetic or products of a dull bourgeoisie.

Million-Dollar Cash Register
Editor, The Daily:
An extremely shortsighted view of the Wilbur
fire alar m fine appeared in the Thursday issue of
The Daily. I'm sure that no one would think of
questioning this wonderful plan, after hearing
the full story.
The principle behind the plan is that, since it is
impossible to determine who perpetrated this das
tardly deed of a false alarm, all persons who
mi/i'ht have done it should be fined equally. In
addition to this unquestionably just basis, the
plan has the glorious advantage of providing
money for a scholarship fund—a truly unques
tionable motive.
Furthermore, the nature of the plan insures a
rich scholarship fund—also highly desirable. For
what could be more fun for a freshman, or an
upperclassman (perish the thought!), than to pull
a fire alarm and then see 700 freshmen shell out
50 cents each?
Thus, by promoting false alarms the success
of the venture is assured. Wilbur will soon oper
ate like a well-oiled cash register. You pull a lever
and the cash drawer pops open, exhibiting 350
beautiful kopecks. The fund need never run low
on money. If ever the enthusiasm for the sport
ol puljing fire alarm levers dies, out, and.the fund
appears low, some well-disguised fellow can enter
and punch the cash register a few limes. Presto!
Oodles of money!
There is only one slight flaw in the plan—it
doesn't go far enough. If a little of something is
good, a lot is supreme. After all, it wasn't neces
sarily a Wilbur resident who pulled the alarm.
Stein is only 100 yards away. Why not extend the
fine to them? And the rest of the campus is cer
tainly not above suspicion, so we can justifiably
fine them. Hmmmm. It is rumored that some
Menlo boys were on campus that night. It is cer
tainly a possibility. We should have a reciprocal
fine arrangement with them. Then, of course,
there's Palo Alto . . . and then San Jose . . .
There can't possibly be any objections to such
a plan. All the money goes into a scholarship
fund and what better use for the money?
Just look at the beauty of the plan. Just think
. . . a million-dollar cash register!
Bruce Jackson
P.S.—Don't believe any vicious rumors going
about that the money isn't going into a scholar
ship fund. This is sheer heresy.

ate like a well-oiled cash register. You pull a lever
and the cash drawer pops open, exhibiting 350
beautiful kopecks. The fund need never run low
on money. If ever the enthusiasm for the sport
ol puljing fire alarm levers dies, out, and.the fund
appears low, some well-disguised fellow can enter
and punch the cash register a few limes. Presto!
Oodles of money!
There is only one slight flaw in the plan—it
doesn't go far enough. If a little of something is
good, a lot is supreme. After all, it wasn't neces
sarily a Wilbur resident who pulled the alarm.
Stein is only 100 yards away. Why not extend the
fine to them? And the rest of the campus is cer
tainly not above suspicion, so we can justifiably
fine them. Hmmmm. It is rumored that some
Menlo boys were on campus that night. It is cer
tainly a possibility. We should have a reciprocal
fine arrangement with them. Then, of course,
there's Palo Alto . . . and then San Jose . . .
There can't possibly be any objections to such
a plan. All the money goes into a scholarship
fund and what better use for the money?
Just look at the beauty of the plan. Just think
. . . a million-dollar cash register!

Opportunity ftn- Thought
Editor, The Daily:
Dennis Gorman's articles in The Daily accuse
the Stanford student body of apathy. The lack
of an intellectual fever, we believe, may be at
tributed to the following conditions:
1. Over-emphasis on quantity rather than qual
ity of work. The typical undergraduate course
consists of frantically recording every word a
professor says in lecture, reading assigned
works in the R.8.R., researching for a standard
term paper, and spurting it all out as fast as a
pen will fill the pages of an examination blue
book. The consequence is too much time spent
on rushing and cramming, but too little time de
voted to thinking.
2. Insufficient opportunity for independent ex
pression on examinations. In some cases the
professor never reads bluebooks but delegates
this necessary job to a reader who must rush to
meet a deadline. Often the professor gives the
reader a key—"this is what I want." If the an
swer doesn't fit, it loses points.
3. Lack of an effort on the part of many pro
fessors to establish a personal relationship with
students. Only through understanding of a stu
dent's aspirations and interests can a professor
properly advise.
Admittedly these conditions are not always the
case but when students gather to complain, these
points invariably arise. We realize the continu
ing need for hard work and academic discipline
—but suggest that more "seminar-like" groups
be incorporated into student programs to corre
late with lecture courses. It is through an op
portunity for independent thought, research and
an interchange of ideas that active intellectual
interest will replace the apathy of which Gorman
writes.

"Can't Believe It"
Editor, The Daily:
I can't quite believe it. Did a member of the
Political Union, as quoted in Wednesday's Daily,
really say "students who don't care a about
anything"?
Well, maybe he did. I'd hate to accuse The

he say it, exactly? Did he say "dash," or did he
say-"blauk," or did he just pause, or what?

Editor, The Daily:
The author of the editorial in Wednesday's
Daily made the complaint that "Stanford stu
dents not only refuse lo take part in organized
intellectual activities, but the great majority
arc not even interested in attending talks by
prominent figures." He suggested as causes for
a lack of participation in these and other such
functions: (1) a small amount of censorship that
the Administration may exercise concerning con
troversial speakers and (2) that Stanford stu
dents are just dull sons and daughters of a dull '
bourgeoisie.
His subject was one that has bothered the
minds of us freshmen since our entering the
University last fall. Features that attracted us
to Stanford were the Political Union, the Tues
day Evening Series, lIR and student govern
ment, all designed to broaden our cultural and
intellectual background. Our great disappoint
ment is that we are so swamped with studies

night after night that wo have no lime In include
these.activities in our. daily schedule. If we arc
here in a University with such opportunities as
these, why should we be forced to miss them in
order to keep our routine grades on the upper
regions of the curve? Are not these additional
activities equally important in our making the
most of a college education?
We certainly do not feel apathetic toward such
activities. We recognize the value in an oppor
tunity such as hearing Eleanor Roosevelt. We
regret not being able to attend these meetings
because of competition with daily studies and
find this a disappointment to our anticipations
of Stanford and college life. This, we feel, is the
reason behind a lack of attendance at Stanford's
intellectual and cultural programs, and we feel
that the Administration and the author of Wed
nesday's editorial might do well to look further
into the situation in this light, with less concen
tration on the ridiculous idea that we are apa

Million-Dollar Cash Register
Editor, The Daily:
An extremely shortsighted view of the Wilbur
fire alar m fine appeared in the Thursday issue of
The Daily. I'm sure that no one would think of
questioning this wonderful plan, after hearing
the full story.
The principle behind the plan is that, since it is
impossible to determine who perpetrated this das
tardly deed of a false alarm, all persons who
mi/i'ht have done it should be fined equally. In
addition to this unquestionably just basis, the
plan has the glorious advantage of providing
money for a scholarship fund—a truly unques
tionable motive.
Furthermore, the nature of the plan insures a
rich scholarship fund—also highly desirable. For
what could be more fun for a freshman, or an
upperclassman (perish the thought!), than to pull
a fire alarm and then see 700 freshmen shell out
50 cents each?
Thus, by promoting false alarms the success
of the venture is assured. Wilbur will soon oper
ate like a well-oiled cash register. You pull a lever
and the cash drawer pops open, exhibiting 350
beautiful kopecks. The fund need never run low

Million-Dollar Cash Register
Editor, The Daily:
An extremely shortsighted view of the Wilbur
fire alar m fine appeared in the Thursday issue of
The Daily. I'm sure that no one would think of
questioning this wonderful plan, after hearing
the full story.
The principle behind the plan is that, since it is
impossible to determine who perpetrated this das
tardly deed of a false alarm, all persons who
mi/i'ht have done it should be fined equally. In
addition to this unquestionably just basis, the
plan has the glorious advantage of providing
money for a scholarship fund—a truly unques
tionable motive.
Furthermore, the nature of the plan insures a
rich scholarship fund—also highly desirable. For
what could be more fun for a freshman, or an
upperclassman (perish the thought!), than to pull
a fire alarm and then see 700 freshmen shell out
50 cents each?
Thus, by promoting false alarms the success
of the venture is assured. Wilbur will soon oper
ate like a well-oiled cash register. You pull a lever
and the cash drawer pops open, exhibiting 350
beautiful kopecks. The fund need never run low
on money. If ever the enthusiasm for the sport
ol puljing fire alarm levers dies, out, and.the fund
appears low, some well-disguised fellow can enter
and punch the cash register a few limes. Presto!
Oodles of money!
There is only one slight flaw in the plan—it
doesn't go far enough. If a little of something is
good, a lot is supreme. After all, it wasn't neces
sarily a Wilbur resident who pulled the alarm.
Stein is only 100 yards away. Why not extend the
fine to them? And the rest of the campus is cer
tainly not above suspicion, so we can justifiably
fine them. Hmmmm. It is rumored that some
Menlo boys were on campus that night. It is cer
tainly a possibility. We should have a reciprocal
fine arrangement with them. Then, of course,
there's Palo Alto . . . and then San Jose . . .
There can't possibly be any objections to such
a plan. All the money goes into a scholarship
fund and what better use for the money?
Just look at the beauty of the plan. Just think
. . . a million-dollar cash register!
Bruce Jackson
P.S.—Don't believe any vicious rumors going
about that the money isn't going into a scholar
ship fund. This is sheer heresy.
Opportunity ftn- Thought
Editor, The Daily:
Dennis Gorman's articles in The Daily accuse
the Stanford student body of apathy. The lack
of an intellectual fever, we believe, may be at
tributed to the following conditions:
1. Over-emphasis on quantity rather than qual
ity of work. The typical undergraduate course
consists of frantically recording every word a
professor says in lecture, reading assigned
works in the R.8.R., researching for a standard
term paper, and spurting it all out as fast as a
pen will fill the pages of an examination blue
book. The consequence is too much time spent
on rushing and cramming, but too little time de
voted to thinking.
2. Insufficient opportunity for independent ex
pression on examinations. In some cases the
professor never reads bluebooks but delegates
this necessary job to a reader who must rush to
meet a deadline. Often the professor gives the
reader a key—"this is what I want." If the an
swer doesn't fit, it loses points.
3. Lack of an effort on the part of many pro
fessors to establish a personal relationship with
students. Only through understanding of a stu
dent's aspirations and interests can a professor
properly advise.
Admittedly these conditions are not always the
case but when students gather to complain, these
points invariably arise. We realize the continu
ing need for hard work and academic discipline
—but suggest that more "seminar-like" groups
be incorporated into student programs to corre
late with lecture courses. It is through an op
portunity for independent thought, research and
an interchange of ideas that active intellectual
interest will replace the apathy of which Gorman
writes.

"Can't Believe It"
Editor, The Daily:
I can't quite believe it. Did a member of the
Political Union, as quoted in Wednesday's Daily,
really say "students who don't care a about
anything"?
Well, maybe he did. I'd hate to accuse The
Daily of misquoting. But I'm curious; how did
he say it, exactly? Did he say "dash," or did he
say-"blauk," or did he just pause, or what?

Studies Corn pete with Activities
Editor, The Daily:
The author of the editorial in Wednesday's
Daily made the complaint that "Stanford stu
dents not only refuse lo take part in organized
intellectual activities, but the great majority
arc not even interested in attending talks by
prominent figures." He suggested as causes for
a lack of participation in these and other such
functions: (1) a small amount of censorship that
the Administration may exercise concerning con
troversial speakers and (2) that Stanford stu
dents are just dull sons and daughters of a dull '
bourgeoisie.
His subject was one that has bothered the
minds of us freshmen since our entering the
University last fall. Features that attracted us
to Stanford were the Political Union, the Tues
day Evening Series, lIR and student govern
ment, all designed to broaden our cultural and
intellectual background. Our great disappoint
ment is that we are so swamped with studies

night after night that wo have no lime In include
these.activities in our. daily schedule. If we arc
here in a University with such opportunities as
these, why should we be forced to miss them in
order to keep our routine grades on the upper
regions of the curve? Are not these additional
activities equally important in our making the
most of a college education?
We certainly do not feel apathetic toward such
activities. We recognize the value in an oppor
tunity such as hearing Eleanor Roosevelt. We
regret not being able to attend these meetings
because of competition with daily studies and
find this a disappointment to our anticipations
of Stanford and college life. This, we feel, is the

Studies Corn pete with Activities
Editor, The Daily:
The author of the editorial in Wednesday's
Daily made the complaint that "Stanford stu
dents not only refuse lo take part in organized
intellectual activities, but the great majority
arc not even interested in attending talks by
prominent figures." He suggested as causes for
a lack of participation in these and other such
functions: (1) a small amount of censorship that
the Administration may exercise concerning con
troversial speakers and (2) that Stanford stu
dents are just dull sons and daughters of a dull '
bourgeoisie.
His subject was one that has bothered the
minds of us freshmen since our entering the
University last fall. Features that attracted us
to Stanford were the Political Union, the Tues
day Evening Series, lIR and student govern
ment, all designed to broaden our cultural and
intellectual background. Our great disappoint
ment is that we are so swamped with studies

night after night that wo have no lime In include
these.activities in our. daily schedule. If we arc
here in a University with such opportunities as
these, why should we be forced to miss them in
order to keep our routine grades on the upper
regions of the curve? Are not these additional
activities equally important in our making the
most of a college education?
We certainly do not feel apathetic toward such
activities. We recognize the value in an oppor
tunity such as hearing Eleanor Roosevelt. We
regret not being able to attend these meetings
because of competition with daily studies and
find this a disappointment to our anticipations
of Stanford and college life. This, we feel, is the
reason behind a lack of attendance at Stanford's
intellectual and cultural programs, and we feel
that the Administration and the author of Wed
nesday's editorial might do well to look further
into the situation in this light, with less concen
tration on the ridiculous idea that we are apa
thetic or products of a dull bourgeoisie.

Million-Dollar Cash Register
Editor, The Daily:
An extremely shortsighted view of the Wilbur
fire alar m fine appeared in the Thursday issue of
The Daily. I'm sure that no one would think of
questioning this wonderful plan, after hearing
the full story.
The principle behind the plan is that, since it is
impossible to determine who perpetrated this das
tardly deed of a false alarm, all persons who
mi/i'ht have done it should be fined equally. In
addition to this unquestionably just basis, the
plan has the glorious advantage of providing
money for a scholarship fund—a truly unques
tionable motive.
Furthermore, the nature of the plan insures a
rich scholarship fund—also highly desirable. For
what could be more fun for a freshman, or an
upperclassman (perish the thought!), than to pull
a fire alarm and then see 700 freshmen shell out
50 cents each?
Thus, by promoting false alarms the success
of the venture is assured. Wilbur will soon oper
ate like a well-oiled cash register. You pull a lever
and the cash drawer pops open, exhibiting 350
beautiful kopecks. The fund need never run low
on money. If ever the enthusiasm for the sport
ol puljing fire alarm levers dies, out, and.the fund
appears low, some well-disguised fellow can enter
and punch the cash register a few limes. Presto!
Oodles of money!
There is only one slight flaw in the plan—it
doesn't go far enough. If a little of something is
good, a lot is supreme. After all, it wasn't neces
sarily a Wilbur resident who pulled the alarm.
Stein is only 100 yards away. Why not extend the
fine to them? And the rest of the campus is cer
tainly not above suspicion, so we can justifiably
fine them. Hmmmm. It is rumored that some
Menlo boys were on campus that night. It is cer
tainly a possibility. We should have a reciprocal
fine arrangement with them. Then, of course,
there's Palo Alto . . . and then San Jose . . .
There can't possibly be any objections to such
a plan. All the money goes into a scholarship
fund and what better use for the money?
Just look at the beauty of the plan. Just think
. . . a million-dollar cash register!
Bruce Jackson
P.S.—Don't believe any vicious rumors going
about that the money isn't going into a scholar
ship fund. This is sheer heresy.
Opportunity ftn- Thought
Editor, The Daily:
Dennis Gorman's articles in The Daily accuse
the Stanford student body of apathy. The lack
of an intellectual fever, we believe, may be at
tributed to the following conditions:
1. Over-emphasis on quantity rather than qual
ity of work. The typical undergraduate course
consists of frantically recording every word a
professor says in lecture, reading assigned
works in the R.8.R., researching for a standard
term paper, and spurting it all out as fast as a
pen will fill the pages of an examination blue
book. The consequence is too much time spent
on rushing and cramming, but too little time de
voted to thinking.
2. Insufficient opportunity for independent ex
pression on examinations. In some cases the
professor never reads bluebooks but delegates
this necessary job to a reader who must rush to
meet a deadline. Often the professor gives the
reader a key—"this is what I want." If the an
swer doesn't fit, it loses points.
3. Lack of an effort on the part of many pro
fessors to establish a personal relationship with
students. Only through understanding of a stu
dent's aspirations and interests can a professor
properly advise.
Admittedly these conditions are not always the
case but when students gather to complain, these
points invariably arise. We realize the continu
ing need for hard work and academic discipline
—but suggest that more "seminar-like" groups
be incorporated into student programs to corre
late with lecture courses. It is through an op
portunity for independent thought, research and
an interchange of ideas that active intellectual
interest will replace the apathy of which Gorman
writes.

I can't quite believe it. Did a member of the
