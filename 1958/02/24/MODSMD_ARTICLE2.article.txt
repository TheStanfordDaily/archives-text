# Jorda Gives Spirited Falla Interpretation
## 
### Bob Christiansen 
Saturday evening's concert by
Enrique Jorda and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, a tra
ditional Concert Series feature,
presented an increasingly good
performance.
The concert opened with Mo
zart's "Notturno in D Major for
Four Orchestras." The perform
ance lacked the Mozart ian spar
kle and charm and was plagued
by erratic tempi, especially in the
Menuetto. The four orchestras,
two of which were on the stage
and the other two in the wings,
played very well together, but
with little sympathy for the gal
lant melodies.
Little can be said about Schu
mann's Symphony No. 2 in C
Major in addition to the first
statement of the program notes:
"The second symphony is the
product of a bad period in Schu
mann's life."
Much of the performance was
ragged and lacked focus.
Virtuosity
The second half of the program
opened with .Ravel's "Mother
Goose Suite," which was played
in as sympathetic a performance
as has been heard in this area in
a long time. The virtuosity of
the orchestra as a whole, com
bined with sensitivity and feel
ing on the part of Jorda, brought
about an enchanting effect.
Samuel Barber's romantic
"Adagio for Strings" was very
well played. The orchestra
achieved a fine unity and each
section performed its turn at the
theme with romantic vigor.
Falla
The concert concluded with
three dances from Manuel de Fa
lla's ballet, "The Three-Cornered
Hat." As is always true with
Spanish music, Jorda turned in a
fine performance. Somehow his
Spanish vigor diffuses through
out the orchestra, and the effect
is that of one man rather than a
group of musicians. Here is
Spanish music played as well as
it is played anywhere.
