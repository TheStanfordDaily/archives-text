The faculty executive commit
tee of the Stanford Study of Un
dergraduate Education addressed
itself, in its .Tunc 1957 report, to
the problem of undergraduate mo
tivation existing at Stanford. The
report states:
"Every college campus is mark
ed by a set of values, a milieu of
its own, which is a product of the
students' backgrounds, the kinds
of homes and high schools from
which they come, and the campus
traditions which, when once es
tablished, are handed down from
one student generation to the
next. At many colleges this mi
lieu is one of anti - intellectual
ism. . . .
"At other campuses the visitor
senses an exciting intellectual en
vironment and a commitment to
learning which energizes the en
tire school, and, seemingly with
out effort on the faculty's part, is
transmitted from one generation
of students to the next. These
schools are alm os 1 invariably
characterized by traditions which
place a premium on intellectual
achievement and make cultivation
of the mind a •socially acceptable
objective for both college and stu
dent."
The report states that those of
the faculty who have "taught at
the belter small colleges and pri
vate universities feel there is
much room for improvement in
the intellectual motivation of the
Stanford undergraduate."
The report goes on to discuss
the factors contributing to Stan
ford's "anti - intellectualism" and
possible corrective measures.
Just what is the cause of the
situation here at Stanford? It
must be attributable either to the
students or to the faculty or to
both. Nobody else is directly in
volved.
Let us examine the position of

the student. He comes to campus)
with some degree of desire to [
learn; he proceeds in a necessar
ily passive role to partake of the
intellectual fodder provided hy the
faculty; then, of course, the un
fortunate tradition of academic
lethargy encompasses the student.
It is plain where the root of the
trouble is.
Stanford gathers together the
intellectual cream of the West
and turns out not butter but skim
milk.
I think the churning process
just isn't vigorous enough. I think
not enough thinking is demanded
of the" student by the faculty. I
think not enough creative atten
tion is given by Uie faculty to the
needs of the students. The faculty
is neglecting its responsibility to
the students.
Any football coach, choir direc
tor, drill sergeant, pledge master,
labor foreman, business executive,
or professor knows that if Ihe
group he leads is not driven hard,
and to its limit, slovenly habits
will set in and morale will de
preciate.
I am sure it is a great tempta
tion to teach courses in the same
old way, to use methods effective
30 years ago. But we have a dif
ferent student now, one who re
quires a different leadership.
I am sure also that it is easier
to let the pace of the class take
care of itself. It is an effort to
plot carefully-designed, aggressive
classroom technique. It is work
to teach a course in such a way
as to chive the best but not dis
courage the remainder.
To do anything new and differ
ent detracts from textbook writ
ing, committee attendance and re
searching. Academic reputations
and pocketbooks may suffer.
It takes time to really make a
friend out of a student and to lead
him as an individual. But perhaps
the fu-uwe -of mankind .rests not
on mankind but on the very vol
ume of new textbooks, research 1
papers and committee reports.

The faculty executive commit
tee of the Stanford Study of Un
dergraduate Education addressed
itself, in its .Tunc 1957 report, to
the problem of undergraduate mo
tivation existing at Stanford. The
report states:
"Every college campus is mark
ed by a set of values, a milieu of
its own, which is a product of the
students' backgrounds, the kinds
of homes and high schools from
which they come, and the campus
traditions which, when once es
tablished, are handed down from
one student generation to the
next. At many colleges this mi
lieu is one of anti - intellectual
ism. . . .
"At other campuses the visitor
senses an exciting intellectual en
vironment and a commitment to
learning which energizes the en
tire school, and, seemingly with
out effort on the faculty's part, is
transmitted from one generation
of students to the next. These
schools are alm os 1 invariably
characterized by traditions which
place a premium on intellectual
achievement and make cultivation
of the mind a •socially acceptable
objective for both college and stu
dent."
The report states that those of
the faculty who have "taught at
the belter small colleges and pri
vate universities feel there is
much room for improvement in
the intellectual motivation of the
Stanford undergraduate."
The report goes on to discuss
the factors contributing to Stan
ford's "anti - intellectualism" and
possible corrective measures.
Just what is the cause of the
situation here at Stanford? It
must be attributable either to the
students or to the faculty or to
both. Nobody else is directly in
volved.
Let us examine the position of

the student. He comes to campus)
with some degree of desire to [
learn; he proceeds in a necessar
ily passive role to partake of the
intellectual fodder provided hy the
faculty; then, of course, the un
fortunate tradition of academic
lethargy encompasses the student.
It is plain where the root of the
trouble is.
Stanford gathers together the
intellectual cream of the West
and turns out not butter but skim
milk.
I think the churning process
just isn't vigorous enough. I think
not enough thinking is demanded
of the" student by the faculty. I
think not enough creative atten
tion is given by Uie faculty to the
needs of the students. The faculty
is neglecting its responsibility to
the students.
Any football coach, choir direc
tor, drill sergeant, pledge master,
labor foreman, business executive,
or professor knows that if Ihe
group he leads is not driven hard,
and to its limit, slovenly habits
will set in and morale will de
preciate.
I am sure it is a great tempta
tion to teach courses in the same
old way, to use methods effective
30 years ago. But we have a dif
ferent student now, one who re
quires a different leadership.
I am sure also that it is easier
to let the pace of the class take
care of itself. It is an effort to
plot carefully-designed, aggressive
classroom technique. It is work
to teach a course in such a way
as to chive the best but not dis
courage the remainder.
To do anything new and differ
ent detracts from textbook writ

searching. Academic reputations
