## 
### 
(Editor's Note: Daily Sports writer Jerry Wisot traveled south over tlie weekend to see the In
dians in action against UCLA and Southern California. The following' is his account of the games.)
Lightning may not always strike in the same place, but no one ever said anything about it not
striking the same team. And in case anyone was about to add that corollary to the old maxim, Stan
ford's Indians, in upsetting USC for the second time this season Saturday, have put a monkey wrench
in the works. Captain Paul Neumann was the big gun for the locals in helping them to split their

Southland series; Stanford lost
to UCLA Friday night, 46-43.
Neumann hit for 25 points,
making 9 out of 11 free throws
and 8 out of 15 field goals. He
also demonstrated great ball han
dling as he led the Indians to
their fourth victory in 13 league
starts.
Holding a 36-32 halftime lead
and losing it after three minutes
of the second half, the Cards
came back from a six-point defi
cit with just 2:50 remaining on
the clock.
Stanford's Neumann started
the scoring, then USC's Jim Han
na exchanged jump shots with
him until the score stood at 10-7
in the Trojans' favor after five
minutes.
USC employed a three-quarter
court press on the Indians and
held them to two field goals and
seven free throws for the next
five minutes.
Senior guard Jerry Rose en
tered the game with approxi
mately four minutes to go until
halftime and proceeded to help
the Indians lake I he lead and hold
it till the half.
In the second half, however,
the Trojans looked like a new
team and in six minutes gained
eight points and a four-point lead
over the Cards. Guard Doug
Warren tied ii up at 47 all with
11:07 remaining, bul the Trojans
hurst into the lead again until
Warren came through to put
Stanford ahead by one point with
two minutes and 50 seconds left.
Neumann once again showed
his ability, making a beautiful
lay-in and a free throw to put the
Indians ahead by four points.
Free throws by forwards John
Arrillaga and ("Jerry Thuesen and
center Dick llaga set the final
score at 69-01
Close to half of Stanford's
points were made by free throws.
The Indians hit these for 73 per
cent and hit field goals for 38 per
cent.
It took a good job of stalling
and a lot of guts, but with these
the UCLA Bruins managed to
outlast Stanford Friday night,
46-43.
Playing heads-up ball, the In
dians took advantage of UCLA's
inability to find the basket on
several occasions and were never
behind the heavily-rated Bruins
mote than six points, UCLA lead
ing 22-10 at the half.
In the second period it took the
Cards just three minutes and 43
seconds to grab the lead from the
heavier Bruins and keep it for
seven minutes. The lead changed
hands for about five minutes, un
til a driving lav-in by UCLA for
ward Jim Halsten set the score
in their favor, 44-41.
With 1:51 to go, the Bruins' 6-6
center Ben Rogers made good on
a foul shot incurred by the stall
ing and then Stanford guard
Doug Warren hit a short jump
shot to set the score at 45-43. In
dian guard Paul Neumann
brought the ball slowly down
court. With :35 left in the game
the Cards played it calmly, wait
ing for the shot that would tie
the score and send the game into
overtime:
The Indians lost the ball, how
ever, and a fould shot was award
ed to Halsten with :01 left. He
made the shot, putting the final
score at 46-43.
High scorer for the game was
Torrence, with 13 points. Indian
center Dick Haga tied for second
with Rogers at 11 points, while
Halsten and Stanford forward
Gerry Theuson hit for ten. Ncu- I
mann had nine points.
