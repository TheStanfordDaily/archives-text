# JV's Take Openers
## 
### 
Three up. three down. Braves
diamondmen took matters in hand
over the week end, drooping Oak
i land JC on Friday, 7-2, and San
: Francisco City College in a Satur
! day double-header, 7-2 and 10-3.
A no-hit stint by
! right-handed hurler Roy Lawson
land a four-for-four performance
at the plate by Mike Lindeman,
which included a grand-slam home
run, were highlights of the jay
vees' opening weekend.
Lawson walked off with the win
in the 7-2 topping of SFCC, al
though he had trouble in the sec-
I ond inning. After hitting a City
j College batter he walked three,
; and these factors, combined with
a Stanford fielding error, allowed
both opposing runs to score.
Harry Rodda and Lindeman
1 both pounded out two hits apiece,
i with Rodda stealing three bases
to add to his merits. Jim Burke
pounded out a one-on homer to
help the local cause.
Lindeman's big effort came in
| the SFCC nightcap. His perfect
day included the grand slammer,
a double, two singles and five
runs batted in. Southpaw Bob
Cockayne got credit for the win,
and Burke's two-for-four effort
was another noticeable perform
ance.
Pitcher Dick Williams drew the
win lrom the Oakland JC game
I Friday, with Rodda shining at the
! plate. The latter stole two bases
j besides his two-for-two hitting.
John Gillis. Mike Immell and
Warren Nelson were Card
I moundsmen who also saw action
in the three tilts. Jay Winter. Jim
| Bayles and Phil Weigand shared
j catching chores.
