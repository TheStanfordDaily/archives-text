# ROUNDUP
## Bears Still Conference Top Team 
### Associated Press 
The tight Pacific Coast Confer
ence basketball race has narrow
ed down to two teams, with the
front-running California Bears in
a strong position to win Iheir sec
ond straight title.
Only Oregon State, one game
back, remains a serious threat to
the Bears' championship hopes,
and the Beavers need a lot of help
as they have no games loft with
California.
The Bears moved into their com
manding position with a strong
showing on their week-end tour of
the Northwest, downing Idaho 70-
62 and Washington Stale 59-48.
OSC Keeps Pace
Oregon State kept pace with a
pair of victories- one over UCLA,
77-61, which pretty well disposed
of the Bruins as title contenders.
The Hears' conference record is
now 10-2, against 9 3 for Oregon
State and 9-4 for UCLA.
California plays at Oregon to
night and then returns to close
out the campaign at Berkeley
against UCLA. Idaho and Oregon.
The Beavers have two games left
wilh tail-end Washington State
and one each with Southern Cali
fornia and Idaho.
Pete Newell's poised Cal quintet
oozed confidence in disposing of
Washington State. Shooting only
when clear, and harrying the Cou
gars with a full-court press, they
won pretty much as ihey pleased.
Impressive Bears
The Beavers were no less im
pressive in their decisive win over
UCLA, with Dave Gambee put
ting on a dazzling display that
netted him 30 points. Combined
with the 24 he scored against USC
when the .Bea.vers. wrecked the
Trojans 69-50 Friday night, it
gave him a new three-year PCC
scoring record of 1858 points. Bob
Houbregs of Washington held the
old mark of 1855.
In other games, Idaho bounced
back from its trimming by Cali
fornia and defeated Washington,
85-63. The Vandals' Gary Sim
mons. held to 13 points by the
sturdy defense Friday, hit for 30
points to win a hot scoring duel
from Washington's Doug Smart,
who had 28.
