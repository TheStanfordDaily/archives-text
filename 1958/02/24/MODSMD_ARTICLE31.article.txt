catcher Ralph Holding and an un- :
timely error by alumni catcher
Jack Shepard were key factors;
in breaking a 2-2 tie and giving
Stanford's young-in-age a -2 vie- j
lory over the returning young-at
heart Saturday on the Sunken i
Diamond.
But the game wasn't as close as !
it may sound. Dutch Fein jug's j
varsity nine brought borne Ihe
first run in the second inning,:
then added another in the fourth!
to give them wh?rt seemed a ;
small but commanding lead going
into the seventh frame.
Here the 1 alums got 1o pitcher
Bob Leopold for a lone counter,
then pushed in the even upper in
the following inning. But the'
varsity came right back in the
bottom of the eighth to wrap it
up.
S ho r t s to p Wayne Marion
scored the winning r un after get
ting a free pass to open the in
ning, artVTfhring to second on
Shepard's throwing error., and
completing the circuit on Hold
ing's single.
Leopold, the winning pitcher,
followed George Avery and Wal
ly Miller to the Card mound, each
working a three - frame stint.
Fehring used two catchers, Art
Von Wronski and Holding, in the
game, but these were Ihe only de
viations from his starting lineup.
Shepard, the alumni manager',
upheld a promise he had made
earlier and used every returnee
who suited for the game. A now

pitcher worked every inning for
the former Indians and frequent
position changes were the rule.
Mis substitutions all but defy
listing.
Oenterfiolder Hon Robinson's
two-out double started the Cards
on the road to the scoring column
in the second inning, lie was
brought home by first baseman
Joel Newkirk's single. Another
double, this time by right-fielder
Rich DoFabio, set up the second
run in the fourth, lie moved to
third on Robinson's single and
went home when alum third-saek
er Dave Slot I miscued on the
play.
Rich Scramaglia came across
with the returnees' sevenllt
frame marker. He was put on
first after being hit by Leopold,
went to second on a ground out
and touched home after Al Tal
boy's single off Card second-base
man Al Shaw's glove.
Jack Shepard's third - baseline
hugging single was enough to
poke "home' Warren Goodrich ~ih
the eighth. But with two out and
men on first and second a pos
sible rally was ended when Scra
maglia lined out to Marion.
Miller was the most effective
of the Indian pitching trio. In his
time he struck out four, knock
ing out the side in the fourth,
gave up two hits and a walk.

THE WINNER —Shortstop Wayne Marion scores the winning; run
in tlie eighth inning of Saturday's van ity alumni game on the
Sunken Diamond. The Card nine played errorless hall in their first
outing oi' the season.
A timely single by varsity!
catcher Ralph Holding and an un- :
timely error by alumni catcher
Jack Shepard were key factors;
in breaking a 2-2 tie and giving
Stanford's young-in-age a -2 vie- j
lory over the returning young-at
heart Saturday on the Sunken i
Diamond.
But the game wasn't as close as !
it may sound. Dutch Fein jug's j
varsity nine brought borne Ihe
first run in the second inning,:
then added another in the fourth!
to give them wh?rt seemed a ;
small but commanding lead going
into the seventh frame.
Here the 1 alums got 1o pitcher
Bob Leopold for a lone counter,
then pushed in the even upper in
the following inning. But the'
varsity came right back in the
bottom of the eighth to wrap it
up.
S ho r t s to p Wayne Marion
scored the winning r un after get
ting a free pass to open the in
ning, artVTfhring to second on
Shepard's throwing error., and
completing the circuit on Hold
ing's single.
Leopold, the winning pitcher,
followed George Avery and Wal
ly Miller to the Card mound, each
working a three - frame stint.
Fehring used two catchers, Art
Von Wronski and Holding, in the
game, but these were Ihe only de
viations from his starting lineup.
Shepard, the alumni manager',
upheld a promise he had made
earlier and used every returnee
who suited for the game. A now

pitcher worked every inning for
the former Indians and frequent
position changes were the rule.
Mis substitutions all but defy
listing.
Oenterfiolder Hon Robinson's
two-out double started the Cards
on the road to the scoring column
in the second inning, lie was
brought home by first baseman
Joel Newkirk's single. Another
double, this time by right-fielder
Rich DoFabio, set up the second
run in the fourth, lie moved to
third on Robinson's single and
went home when alum third-saek
er Dave Slot I miscued on the
play.
Rich Scramaglia came across
with the returnees' sevenllt
frame marker. He was put on
first after being hit by Leopold,
went to second on a ground out
and touched home after Al Tal
boy's single off Card second-base
man Al Shaw's glove.
