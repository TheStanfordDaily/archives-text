# What's it like to be with IBM?
## 
### 
"I became interested in computers and transistors at
college," Robert Pike recalls. "In fact, my senior
project was building a small computer. So, when I
graduated from the University of Maine in June, 1955,
I naturally turned to the computer field. IBM, recog
nized as a leader in this expanding electronics area,
looked like a good place for me."
Bob Pike began his IBM career as a Technical Engi
neer, starting with a training program that lasted sev
eral months. Then, asked to select the work area of his
choice, he picked the Semi-Conductor Device Develop
ment Group in Research. "My first assignment," he
says, "was to plot various electrical and physical de
vice parameters for a large number of transistors in
the form of graphs or histograms in order to obtain
correlation coefficients of the device characteristics."
Many fascinating assignments

in rapid succession:
Work on a germanium
drift, diffused base
transistor (he was the
second of his group to
enter this field) . . .
work on silicon as a
transistor material do
ing evaporations of im
purities on the silicon
(he is known as the
"pioneer silicon device
man" of his group).

"Silicon is better than germanium because of better
tempt rature and voltage breakdown points," he men
tions. "But it is difficult to find a material to wet
silicon to form alloyed junctions. I recall making the
small contacts with an ultrasonic soldering iron."
Bob I'ike was promoted to Associate Physicist, in
December, 195(>. JI is present assignment is leading a
group of technicians in fabricating high-frequency,
high-power PNP drift transistors. "We use a process
] developed," he says. "These transistors will lie used
as core drivers in a high-speed memory array."
Ask him about this "most interesting" project and
he'll tell you, "Working with the evaporation of alloy
ing impurities and designing 'new' semi-conductor
devices."
Sold on IBM
Bob Pike is enthusiast ic about IBM as a place to work.
"The glowing descriptions of my work," he remi-

nisces, "the extensive research facilities and the friendly

employee-management
relations brought two
E.E. friends of mine to
IBM from Maine, my
Alma Mater."
His future? At the rate
IBM and the electronic
computer field are ex
panding, he sees great
opportunities. Of
course, his own prog
ress will be in ac
cordance with IBM's
promotion policy —
"strictly on merit." He

has set a tentative goal of Project Engineer within
the next five years and expects to continue to specialize
in semi-conductor work.

Bob Pike lives in
Poughkeepsie, N. Y.,
near the Research Lab
oratory, with his wife
and young son. He
finds time to garden
around his new home
and to participate in
the IBM Camera Club
and a local Audio
(Hi-Fi) Society. "It's
a busy life," he says,
". . . and one with a
stimulating future."

This profile is just one example of what it's like to he
with IBM. There arc many other excellent opportuni
ties for well-qualified college men in Research, Devel
opment, Manufacturing, Sales and Applied Science.
