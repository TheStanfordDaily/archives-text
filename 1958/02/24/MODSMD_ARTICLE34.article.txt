Live actors, animated cartoons

film "The Strange Case of the
Cosmic Rays," which will be the

Evening Series.
The movie, a part of the Bell
Telephone science series, was
presented last fall on NBC tele
vision.
It tells the science story of cos-1

mic rays and their behavior. The
rays are billions of invisible
atomic meteors from space which
strike the earth's atmosphere at
terrific speed and force.
Cosmic rays shatter on contact
with the earth's atmosphere and
the resulting "cosmic fall-out" is
thought to have an important ef
fect on germ cells and the evolu
tion of living creatures.
