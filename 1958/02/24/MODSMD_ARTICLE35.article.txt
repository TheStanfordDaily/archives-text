Though tllis column is intended solely as a vehicle for well
tempered drollery, the makers of Marlboro have agreed to let
me use this space from time to time for a short lesson in science.
Tliey are the most decent and obliging of men, the makers of
Marlboro, as anyone can tell from sampling their product. Only
from bounteous hearts could come such a lot to like—such filter,
such flavor, such flip-top box. The filter works; the flavor pleases;
the box protects. Who can resist such a winning combination?
tSurely not I.

Today let us take up the science of medicine, which was in
vented in 10(30 by a Greek named Hippocrates. He soon gathered
around him a group of devoted disciples whom he called
"doctors." The reason he called them "doctors" was that they
spent all their time sitting around the dock and shooting the
breeze. In truth, there was little else for them to do because
disease was not invented until 1477.
After that, doctors became very busy, but it must be admitted
that their knowledge of medicine was lamentably meagre. They
knew only one treatment—a change of climate. For example,
a French doctor would send all his patients to Switzerland.
A Swiss doctor, on the other hand, would send all his patients
to France. By 1780 the entire population of France was living
in Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the
Black Tom Explosion.
Not until 1924 did medicine, as we know it, come into being.
In that year in the little Bavarian village of Pago-Pago an
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot
water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son
Lydia, disguised as a linotype, made his way to America where
he invented the Mayo Brothers.
Medicine, as it is taught at your very own college, can be
divided roughly into two classifications. There is internal medi
cine, which is the treatment of interns, and external medicine,
which is the treatment of extcrns.
Diseases also fall into two broad categories—chronic and
acute. Chronic disease is, of course, inflammation of the chron,
which can be mighty painful, believe you me! Last summer my
cousin Haskell was stricken with a chron attack while he was
out picking up tinfoil, and it was months before the wretched
bov could straighten up. In fact, even after lie was cured,
Haskell continued to walk around bent over double. This went
on for several years before Dr. Caligari, the lovable old country
practitioner who treats Haskell, discovered that Haskell had
his trousers buttoned to his vest.
Two years ago Haskell had Addison's disease. (Addison, curi
ously enough, had Haskell's.) Poor Haskell catches everything
that conies along. Lovable old Dr. Caligari once said to him,
"Son, I guess you are what they call a natural born catcher."
"The joke is on you, Doc," replied Haskell. "I am a third
basemen." lie thereupon fell into such a fit, of giggling that the
doctor had to put him under sedation, where he is to this day.
; But 1 digress. We were discussing medicine. I have now told
you all 1 can; the rest is up to you. Go over to your mcd school
and poke around, firing popcorn and watch an operation. X-ray
cach other. Contribute to the bone bank . . . And remember,
medicine can be fun! <& iuo». shuiman

tempered drollery, the makers of Marlboro have agreed to let
me use this space from time to time for a short lesson in science.
Tliey are the most decent and obliging of men, the makers of
Marlboro, as anyone can tell from sampling their product. Only
from bounteous hearts could come such a lot to like—such filter,
such flavor, such flip-top box. The filter works; the flavor pleases;
the box protects. Who can resist such a winning combination?
tSurely not I.

Today let us take up the science of medicine, which was in
vented in 10(30 by a Greek named Hippocrates. He soon gathered
around him a group of devoted disciples whom he called
"doctors." The reason he called them "doctors" was that they
spent all their time sitting around the dock and shooting the
breeze. In truth, there was little else for them to do because
disease was not invented until 1477.
After that, doctors became very busy, but it must be admitted
that their knowledge of medicine was lamentably meagre. They
knew only one treatment—a change of climate. For example,
a French doctor would send all his patients to Switzerland.
A Swiss doctor, on the other hand, would send all his patients
to France. By 1780 the entire population of France was living
in Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the
Black Tom Explosion.
Not until 1924 did medicine, as we know it, come into being.
In that year in the little Bavarian village of Pago-Pago an
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot
water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son
Lydia, disguised as a linotype, made his way to America where
he invented the Mayo Brothers.
Medicine, as it is taught at your very own college, can be
divided roughly into two classifications. There is internal medi
cine, which is the treatment of interns, and external medicine,
which is the treatment of extcrns.
Diseases also fall into two broad categories—chronic and
acute. Chronic disease is, of course, inflammation of the chron,
which can be mighty painful, believe you me! Last summer my
cousin Haskell was stricken with a chron attack while he was
out picking up tinfoil, and it was months before the wretched
bov could straighten up. In fact, even after lie was cured,
Haskell continued to walk around bent over double. This went
on for several years before Dr. Caligari, the lovable old country
practitioner who treats Haskell, discovered that Haskell had
his trousers buttoned to his vest.
Two years ago Haskell had Addison's disease. (Addison, curi
ously enough, had Haskell's.) Poor Haskell catches everything
that conies along. Lovable old Dr. Caligari once said to him,
"Son, I guess you are what they call a natural born catcher."
"The joke is on you, Doc," replied Haskell. "I am a third
basemen." lie thereupon fell into such a fit, of giggling that the
doctor had to put him under sedation, where he is to this day.

you all 1 can; the rest is up to you. Go over to your mcd school
and poke around, firing popcorn and watch an operation. X-ray
