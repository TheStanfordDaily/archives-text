# A 						Campus-to-Career Case History
## "This was the kind of challenge I was looking for" 
### 
Here's what John A. Reiter, Jr., B.S.
in Electronics, Arizona Stale College,
'54, says about the biggest project so far
in his Bell System career.
"This was the kind of challenge I was
looking for—a chance to assist in plan
ning a microwave radio relay system
between Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona.
Five intermediate relay stations would be
needed, and I began by planning the
tower locations on 'line of sight' paths
after a study of topographical maps.
Then I made field studies using altimeter
measurements, and conducted path-loss
tests to determine bow high each tower
should be. This was the trickiest part of
the job. It called for detecting the pres
ence of reflecting surfaces along the

transmission route, and determining
measures necessary to avoid their effects.
"Not the least part of the job was
estimating the cost of each of the five
relay stations. All told, the system will
cost more than $500,000. When con
struction is finished in December of this
year, I'll be responsible for technical
considerations in connecting the radio
relay and telephone carrier equipment.
"This assignment is an example of the
challenges a technical man can find in
the telephone company. You take the job
from start to finish—from basic field
studies to the final adjustments—with
full responsibility. To technical men who
want to get ahead, that's the ultimate
in responsibility."
