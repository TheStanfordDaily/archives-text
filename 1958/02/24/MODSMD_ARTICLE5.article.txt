# MINISTER HAMZAVI
## Iran Is 'Resolute, Enduring Friend' 
### Jack Clumeck 
"So far as foreign aid to Iran
is concerned, the first thing that
I would like to see would be an
American university like Stanford
established in Iran where tens of
thousands could study." This in
teresting comment was made by
Abdul Hossein Hamzavi, Iran's
I minister to the United Nations
and director of information, dur
ing his visit on campus Thursday.
He outlined the goal of his coun
try's educational policies as see
ing all people eduated. "The es
tablishment of an American uni
versity would bring the American
way of life to the grass roots and
would obviale our most serious
problem, the lack of trained men,"
he continued.
Stating his evaluation of educa
tion, Ham/.avi commented, "While
we do not want to pass judgment
on your methods of mass educa
tion, we are more interested in
learning and culture than in mere
education."
Cornerstone
Minister Hamzavi then proceed
ed to laud the importance of his
country as a cornerstone of the
free world.
"Iran has 1000 miles of contig
uous border with the Soviet Un
ion," he said; "we are an outpost
of the free world. Our stand
against international Communism
forms the first line of defense for
the United States, San Francisco
and even Stanford University.
"Thirteen to fourteen thousand
miles from the United States, we
are your most resolute and endur
ing friends as a matter of convic
tion and not because of foreign
aid."
Hamzavi discussed the impor
tance of the Baghdad Pact. Com
posed of Iran, Turkey, Pakistan
and Iraq, it encompasses 120 mil
lions of population united to stop
Communist subversion.
"This is an unprecedented event
in the 1300 years since the advent
of Islam four Moslem countries
allied with the Western world and
the United States," he commented.
Three Times Texas
The Baghdad Pact is a link in
the chain of defense alliances of
pro - West countries surrounding
the Soviet Union. "It links NATO
and SEATO," Hamzavi explained,
in the area of the "underbelly of
the fountainhead of Communism."
With reference to the future of
Iran, the UN minister painted a
bright picture. The country has
"tremendous potentiality; it is
three times the size of the state
of Texas, has 20 million people

and acts as a protective shield for
the Middle East's oil resources."
Considering natural resources,
Hamzavi called attention to the
new oil gusher in the area of
Psychology Department, teaching
industrial and group psychology.
Qum, 20 miles southwest of Te
hran, the capital.
"It gushed 80,000 to 100,000 bar
rels per day and took 57 days to
cap," he said. "The biggest well
in the United States or the Carib
bean produces 6000 to 7000 barrels
by comparison. Not including this
new gusher, 8 per cent of the
world's oil reserves are in Iran.
A pipeline is proposed to run from
northwestern Iran through Tur
key to the Mediterranean—-the
doorstep of the Western world."
Oil Output
The nationalized Iranian oil in
dustry is "running smoothly; it is
back to the output of 33 million
tons per year" as was the case be
fore the nationalization. "Since
1954, American, British, French
and Dutch oil companies have act
ed as agents and advisers," he
continued.
The funds derived from the oil
industry are destined to further
build up the country. "In the next
five years we will put aside $1 bil
lion for economic rehabilitation
plans and social reforms," Ham
zavi proudly said.
Hamzavi is on the West Coast
as part of "Great Decisions," a
program sponsored by tiie For
eign Policy Association. "They try
to bring foreign affairs to the
American people so that they can
formulate opinions," he explained.
"Everything Is Big"
Comparing the universities of
his native country and the United
States, Hamzavi said Iran has
three small universities and one
big one—the 10,000-student state
run University of Tehran. "The
United States is a jackpot coun
try everything is big," was the
statement he used to illustrate his
Impressions* of the American ad
vanced education system.
He ended his discussion on a
patriotic note. The present King
of Ira n, a constitutional mon
archy, is "young, democratic, cul
tured and educated; he is doing
everything possible to modernize
the country."
As a concluding note, Minister
Hamzavi enumerated his coun
try's two proudest heritages —
first, that "we have had a king for
the past 3000 years"; second, that
"through all historical vicissitudes
we have retained our entity and
national unity."
