# DR. LINUS PAULING
## Noted Scientist Calls for Conscientious Objection 
### Dave Quartos 
"The time has come for youths
to be conscientious objectors,"
said renowned chemist Dr. Linus
Pauling of the California Institute
of Technology during a special
Daily interview Friday afternoon
in San Jose.
Dr. Pauling explained that, not
only as a geneticist concerned
about the health of future genera
tions but as a rational individual,
he feels war is immoral.
Although some provision is
made for conscientious objection
for religious reasons, there is no
recognition of philosophical con
viction against war.
Conscience Governs
Nevertheless, Dr. Pauling feels
strongly that "people's actions
should be determined by their con
sciences. It is no disgrace to go
to jail for moral convictions."
When asked where churches fit
into the world picture, Dr. Paul
ing replied they should combat
war with one of their basic tenets,
"Thou shalt not kill."
He wondered how any rational
person could believe this com
mandment had application only to
individuals and not to nations.
Dr. Pauling cited war and na
tionalism as the two causcs of
today's world difficulties.
Be lliiman Beings
"We must first be human be
ings and citizens of the world," ho
said. "The time of nationalism has
p a s s e d. International problems
need to be solved not by force but.
by international law and agree
ments."
"We should put more money
into the solution of world prob
lems by rationality and at the
same time slowly cut the military
budget."he said.
"Unilateral disarmament is at
present too hypothetical," Dr.
Pauling concluded. However, he
did note that its use by either the
United States or the Soviet Union

would undoubtedly trave profound
beneficial moral and psychologi
cal effects on the rest of the
world.
The only answer to internation
al tension is, in Dr. Pauling's
mind, international agreements
between the United States, Russia
and the rest of the world.
Russians Rational
Because of a three weeks' trip
to the Soviet Union last summer,
Dr. Pauling said he is firmly con
vinced we can be rational with the
Russians. "Russian scientists are
just like West Coast scientists,"
he said.
One of the bases of Dr. Paul
ing's heliefs is his research on mu
tations in genes caused by radia
tion. According to his estimates
of mutation rates, the explosion
of each big (10 megatons) nuclear
bomb will eventually cause 13,000
defective children.
He explained that this 1 per
cent increase in mutation rate be
cause of radiation is corroborated
by many eminent geneticists
across the country.
Dr. Edward Teller of the Uni
versity of California has recently
refuted Dr. Pauling's findings.
However, Dr. Pauling believes Dr.
Teller's brilliant scientific ability
has been clouded by his Hungar
ian nationality and his dislike for
the Russians.
In conclusion. Dr. Pauling said
that if the present rate of one
bomb a year is continued, in the
near future the mutation rate will
be such that there will be an ad
ditional 15,000 defective children
born each year.
"These facts lead us to only one
conclusion," he said; "we must
give up war."
