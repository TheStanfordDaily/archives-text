# Farm Soaked; Damage Slight

### Doug willis 
High winds and drenching rains hit the Northern California area
yesterday and .95 inch of rain fell on the Stanford campus in a brief
five-hour period yesterday afternoon. In spite of the heavy rain and
winds, surprisingly little damage occurred on campus and few drains
were seriously clogged as an efficient Corporation Yard crew kept

â–ºregularly ahead of campus emer
gen ices.
At 859 Escondido, a tree fell in
the front yard, downing electrical
wires. At the corner of Galvez
Street and Memorial Way clog
ged drains flooded the street and
sidewalks, but elsewhere all went
smoothly and efficiently.
Such was not the ease with the
local police departments, though.
A "fleet" of four airplane inner
tubes manned by a "navy" of
seven stalwart Zeta Psi men ran
the rapids of San Francisquito
Creek yesterday afternoon, and
five local police departments
were called to the rescue.
Police Wailing
The Zetes, inspired by the high,
fast waters from recent rains, en
tered the creek near Rossotti's
on Alpine Road and tumbled and
soaked for two adventuresome
miles until they met the local po
lice waiting with rescue equip
ment at the foothill bridge near
the Stanford golf course.
Residents along the creek had
reported boys out in the water
and sent local police to save
them.
No one was injured, it was dis
covered, but according to officer
N. P. Markel of the Stanford Po
lice Department, the escapade
could have been very serious be
cause it took police away from
their real job when they might
have been most needed."
North Drenched
Elsewhere, a howling south
easterly storm dumped inches
more rain on Northern Califor
nia yesterday, cresting rivers
over their banks and forcing
evacuation of lowland farm fam
ilies in several areas.
In San Francisco, 1.34 inches
of rain fell yesterday, but worst
hit thus far was a cluster of re
sort communities around Clear
Lake. Highways around the lake
were closed and the lake itself
was over the road for a four-mile
stretch.
