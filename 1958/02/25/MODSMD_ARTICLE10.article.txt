A color film, "The Strange Case
of the Cosmic Rays," will be fea
tured tonight at 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium as part of the Tues
day Evening Series.
The show combines the use of
live actors, animated cartoons and
puppets to tell the science story
of cosmic rays and their behavior.
Presented last fall on NBC tele
vision, (he movie features Dr.
Frank Baxter as "Dr. Research"
and actor Richard Carlson as a
fiction writer.
Part of the Bell Telephone sci

describe cosmic rays, the billions
of- invisible atomic meteors from
space, and the "cosmic fall-out"
which results from their contact
with the earth's atmosphere.
This fall-out is thought to have
an important effect on germ cells
and the evolution of living crea
tures.
