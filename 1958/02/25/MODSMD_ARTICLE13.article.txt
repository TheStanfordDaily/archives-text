# Knight Attacks Engle's Work
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P) — Gov.
Goodwin J. Knight kicked off his
campaign for the Republican U.S.
senatorial nomination last night
at a $100-a-plate dinner by ripping
into Rep. Clair Engle, Democrat,
as if both already had their party
nominations in their pockets.
Knight, speaking in the home
city of his Republican rival, Mayor
George Christopher, did not so
much as hint at a primary battle.
Instead he devoted most of his
speech to Engle and the congress
man's record on California's high
ly controversial water problems.
So far, Engle is the only Demo
crat in the race for the seat that
U.S. Sen. William F. Knowland is
quitting in his bid to succeed
Knight as governor.
"Mr. Engle, as a congressman
from the second district, has treat
ed the rest of California as though
it were foreign territory—to the
embarrassment, I am sure, of
most of his constituents," Knight
charged.
He accused Engle of taking po
sitions on water inimical both to
San Francisco and Los Angeles.
