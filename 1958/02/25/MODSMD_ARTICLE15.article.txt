# Honor Codes At Other Universities
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: In connection
with the current controversy
over Stanford's judicial councils
and the Honor Code, The Daily
presents a brief discussion of
the honor codes of a few other
major universities and how they
operate.)
University of Virginia
The Virginia system, originated
in 1842, is the oldest honor code
in the country. It requires that
students who see persons who
look as if they are cheating must
discuss the matter with the vio
lators. If the latter cannot con
vince their accusers they were not
cheating, they may either leave
the university or ask that their
cases be tried before the Honor-
Court.
Conviction is not reviewable by
anyone, although it must be by
unanimous vote. Conviction of a
violation means automatic dismis
sal from the university.
Princeton
The Princeton honor system
permits trials to be public and
allows defendants to face their
accusers. In extreme cases the
proceedings may be taken before
a mass meeting of the university.
Six out of .seven votes of the ju
dicial council are necessary for
conviction.
Haverford
Haverford has no constitutional
provision that a trial be public or
private, nor that the defendant
may face his accuser. The issue
is completely ignored.
Anyone who sees a student he
believes to be cheating must inter
view the suspect privately before
turning him in to the council.
Amherst
Amherst does not have an hon
or system, although its students
have indicated they would like to
have unproctored examinations.
But the recent report on "Edu
cation at Amherst" says that the
"opposition [to an honor system]
wa-s based chiefly upon an unwill
ingness to take responsibility." It
quotes a typical attitude that "no
decent Amherst man would turn
his fellow in."
It also points out that the popu
larity of honor systems is dimin
ishing, and that those in existence
are falling into disuse. As of 1954,
only 13 per cent of the colleges
and universities interviewed by
Amherst had honor systems.
