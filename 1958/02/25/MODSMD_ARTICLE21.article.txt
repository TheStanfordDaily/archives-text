# UC Considers Requiring Scholastic Aptitude Tests
## 
### 
The University of California is considering a proposal to add scho
lastic aptitude tests to its entrance requirements, in conjunction with
sweeping regulations to raise the level of studies in the College of
Letters and Science.
If adopted the tests would become effective for all campuses of

the state-wide university.
Now, stiffer regulations for stu
dents entering the Berkeley Let
ters and Science program were
ordered two months ago.
The regulations include fresh
man mathematics and composi
tion courses, expansion of natural
and social science studies, and
concentration on one rather than
two foreign languagesâ€”all com
pulsory requirements
Dismissal
The faculty also ordered dismis
sal for any student who cannot
maintain a "C" average or better
for two consecutive semesters.
Charles W. Jones, chairman of
the state-wide board of admis
sions, said the proposed entrance
tests are similar to those used by
Stanford and are used by more
than 50 per cent of the universi
ties in the United States.
The plan, he said, "is not meant
to imply that California is chang
ing its standards of selection, but
that it should constantly seek a
means of making selection more
accurate."
"B" Average
Since 1932, Cal has admitted
high school students on the basis
of a "B" average in basic subjects,
including history, English, mathe
matics, laboratory science and for
eign languages.
"On the whole, that has been
good but arbitrary." Jones said.
"Some students below a 'B' aver
age are capable of university
work, while some above it are not.
"Scholastic aptitude tests would
help to make a finer discrimina
tion of these borderline cases."
Jones presented the board of
admissions proposal to the Aca
demic Senate on Jan. 13.
