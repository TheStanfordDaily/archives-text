A photographic display of Jap
anese landscape gardening, com
piled from Japanese sources and
circulated by the University of
Oregon, will be at the Stanford
Art Gallery through March 9.
It demonstrates the use of rock
groups, raked sand, shrubbery,
trees, stone lanterns, pagodas, wa
ter basins, bamboo fences and j
hedges as means of "delighting
the eye and resting the mind." |
