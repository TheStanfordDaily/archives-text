# Tinker, Guild to Discuss Judicial By-laws Today
## Talk to Allow Both Factions To Air Issue 
### 
Men's Council Chairman Gor
don Tinker and Robert C. Guild
will discuss Iho proposed amend
ments to the ASSU By-laws deal
ing with the student judicial
councils today at 3 p.m. in tho
Nitery, in a meeting sponsored
by the Off-Campus Men's Club.
Guild, along with Barbara
Beckwith and Dave Davidson,
Crothers representative to Legis
lature, was the author and circu
lator of the petition now awaiting
either LASSU appreval or a stu
dent referendum which would
change the judicial council sec
tion of the By-laws.
Pro and Con
Guild and Tinker, representing
the pros and cons respectively of
the amendment, will present,
their views on the proposals and
answer questions from the audi
ence. Tom Thiringer, Legislature
representative from off-campus,
will moderate.
Guild, defending the proposed
amendments, believes that "the
basic reason militating against
the proposal is that the accuser
presumably would face persecu
tion from the defendant and the
defendant's friends, if he were
questioned by the defendant or it
he were subjected to a public
trial."
Persecution
He adds that "if persecution
does exist and does continue, the
students aren't taking the respon
sibilities of the honor system and
therefore don't deserve its privi
leges." He points out that the
amendments would be put in the
By-laws and "can be changed if
they have to be. But I feel they
should be given a chance."
Tinker will presumably also
discuss the persecution question.
His stand has been that the ac
cused "deserve equal rights as to
the secrecy of the case." He feels
that students wouldn't turn in
Honor Code violators if they had
to face them during the trial.
Honor Code
Guild told The Daily he be
lieves the Honor Code is "unreal
istic, under the present condi
tions. It's not an honor code, be
cause the spirit and moral as
sumptions implicit in the Honor
Code are not included in its regu
lations.
"The only way students can
show they want the responsibili
ties of the Honor Code is to pass
the amendment. And if they don't
want the responsibilities I don't
think they should have the Honor
Code."
Legislature will vote on the
proposed amendments Thursday
night. If they are defeated, whi- h
is expected, the amendments will
be voted on in a student referen
dum next week.
