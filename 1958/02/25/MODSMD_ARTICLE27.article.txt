# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## Soviet Policy 
### Walter Lippmann 
After a diligent reading of the recent speeches
and letters from Russia and China, together with
some inquiries among those who might know
what they are talking about, it is reasonably clear
1o me what is the guiding principle of their cur
rent foreign policy. It is that, as between East
and West, the tide is now running in their favor;
Ihat what is wanted is not an attempt to settle
the substantive issues but. on the contrary, re
laxation of the tension and of any serious effort
io interfere with the course of events.
Thus, while they want to talk at the summit,
they look upon such a meeting as useful to quiet
(lie emotions and to allay resistance and anxiety
about what' —if nobody interferes —is going to
happen. What is going to happen, they confi
dently believe, is that the Western system of
alliances will disintegrate before the Communist
alliances disintegrate.
As Marxists they arc, of course, determinists
and therefore disposed to believe that history is
with them. But. though their current foreign
policy suits their Marxist ways of thinking. Khru
shchev and company are practical men who re
main very close to the earth.

When Khrushchev says that peace can best
be preserved by recognizing the status quo, he
means more than that a divided Germany is
better than a united Germany, and that the satel
lite empire is better than a neutral belt. No doubt
be believes, as do so many in the West, that the
reunification of Germany and the liberation of
Hie Eastern nations on any conceivable terms
would be far more dangerous than the situation
as it now is. Kut that is not all that he believes.
He believes, too, that the Warsaw Pact is more
durable than NATO, because it is not only the
stronger power but the more resolute. It follows,

1m 1 must believe, that, the Western system will be
the first to come apart.
There is no evidence, so far as T ran see, thai
lie is toying with the notion of using overt mili
tary intervention, nor even that he is counting
upon achieving a decisive military superiority.
His policy assumes a continuing military stale
mate -such a balance of power that neither side
can compel the other. What he counts upon is the
durability of his system in comparison with the
instability of the Western democracies and their
internal complications arising from the diseased
remnants of the old European empires.
■ii- * -fr
If this is correct, then the fundamental ques-1
tion for the Western democracies is whether they
can afford to base their policy, like Khrushchev's, I
on the principle of the status quo. in fact though
not in name, the maintenance of the status quo |
is what we stand for in Germany, in Algeria, in
Cyprus, in the Middle Kast, in southeast Asia, in
Formosa, in Korea. The difference between us
and Khrushchev is that we stand for the status
quo because we are afraid of the risks of dis
turbing it; Khrushchev stands for the status quo
because lie is confident that it will evolve in bis
favor.
If, by chance. Khrushchev is right in what he
expects, how convenient it must be for him to
find Mr. Dulles. Dr. Adenauer and Mr. Macmillan
working to prevent the West from taking any
serious initiative aimed to alter the status quo.
How convenient for him -since he does not want
to take the Red army out of East Germany and
Poland—to have so many elegant advocates in
the Western world arguing against any initiative
that might disturb his occupation of German and
Polish territory!

When Khrushchev says that peace can best
be preserved by recognizing the status quo, he
means more than that a divided Germany is
better than a united Germany, and that the satel
lite empire is better than a neutral belt. No doubt
be believes, as do so many in the West, that the
reunification of Germany and the liberation of
Hie Eastern nations on any conceivable terms
would be far more dangerous than the situation
as it now is. Kut that is not all that he believes.
He believes, too, that the Warsaw Pact is more
durable than NATO, because it is not only the
stronger power but the more resolute. It follows,

1m 1 must believe, that, the Western system will be
the first to come apart.
There is no evidence, so far as T ran see, thai
lie is toying with the notion of using overt mili
tary intervention, nor even that he is counting
upon achieving a decisive military superiority.
His policy assumes a continuing military stale
mate -such a balance of power that neither side
can compel the other. What he counts upon is the
durability of his system in comparison with the
instability of the Western democracies and their
internal complications arising from the diseased
remnants of the old European empires.

If this is correct, then the fundamental ques-1
tion for the Western democracies is whether they
can afford to base their policy, like Khrushchev's, I
on the principle of the status quo. in fact though
not in name, the maintenance of the status quo |
is what we stand for in Germany, in Algeria, in
Cyprus, in the Middle Kast, in southeast Asia, in
Formosa, in Korea. The difference between us
and Khrushchev is that we stand for the status
quo because we are afraid of the risks of dis
turbing it; Khrushchev stands for the status quo
because lie is confident that it will evolve in bis
favor.
If, by chance. Khrushchev is right in what he
expects, how convenient it must be for him to
find Mr. Dulles. Dr. Adenauer and Mr. Macmillan
working to prevent the West from taking any
serious initiative aimed to alter the status quo.
How convenient for him -since he does not want
to take the Red army out of East Germany and
Poland—to have so many elegant advocates in
the Western world arguing against any initiative
that might disturb his occupation of German and
Polish territory!

After a diligent reading of the recent speeches
and letters from Russia and China, together with
some inquiries among those who might know
what they are talking about, it is reasonably clear
1o me what is the guiding principle of their cur
rent foreign policy. It is that, as between East
and West, the tide is now running in their favor;
Ihat what is wanted is not an attempt to settle
the substantive issues but. on the contrary, re
laxation of the tension and of any serious effort
io interfere with the course of events.
Thus, while they want to talk at the summit,
they look upon such a meeting as useful to quiet
(lie emotions and to allay resistance and anxiety
about what' —if nobody interferes —is going to
happen. What is going to happen, they confi
dently believe, is that the Western system of
alliances will disintegrate before the Communist
alliances disintegrate.
