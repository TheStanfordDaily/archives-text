1*111 Fillies in Another Staltle
Editor, The Daily:
Last quarter there appeared in The Daily a
letter to The editor advocating that we sacrifice
our women (neigh, girls) for liquor in contrast to
ihe Princeton situation in which cars were sacri
ficed for spirits. Now Mr. Burton—-as you noted
in your editorial of 20 Feb.- has come up with
the idea that we should do away with coeducation
completely in our institutions of higher learning,
with no quid pro quo whatever. The following
eclectic proposal will meet with immediate ap
proval, for we studs of Stanford would, if it were
accepted, have our liquor and drink it too.
We, the undersigned, propose that the Admin
istration purchase Menlo Junior College as a
stable for our Stanford fillies. To keep them
under harness and in trotting form, such courses
as Marriage and the Family, Typing, Shorthand,
Basketweaving and, for that matter, the whole
of the School of Education would be transferred.
An institution of old "meres" would be set up to
assure that these thoroughbreds are properly
broken in and bedded down, and to .see to it that
a certain amount of horse sense is imprarted [sic]
to them before they are turned out to pasture for
breeding purposes.
We Stanford studs are in a race to the finish

wire. In order not to distrael us from our goals,
our fillies should be kept on the olher side of the
fence and in another stable on Ihe condition that i
the fence be not too high and that the stable door J
be kept open!

pastime.

breeding purposes.
We Stanford studs are in a race to the finish

wire. In order not to distrael us from our goals,
our fillies should be kept on the olher side of the
fence and in another stable on Ihe condition that i
the fence be not too high and that the stable door J
be kept open!

1*111 Fillies in Another Staltle
Editor, The Daily:
Last quarter there appeared in The Daily a
letter to The editor advocating that we sacrifice
our women (neigh, girls) for liquor in contrast to
ihe Princeton situation in which cars were sacri
ficed for spirits. Now Mr. Burton—-as you noted
in your editorial of 20 Feb.- has come up with
the idea that we should do away with coeducation
completely in our institutions of higher learning,
with no quid pro quo whatever. The following
eclectic proposal will meet with immediate ap
proval, for we studs of Stanford would, if it were
accepted, have our liquor and drink it too.
We, the undersigned, propose that the Admin
istration purchase Menlo Junior College as a
stable for our Stanford fillies. To keep them
under harness and in trotting form, such courses
as Marriage and the Family, Typing, Shorthand,
Basketweaving and, for that matter, the whole
of the School of Education would be transferred.
An institution of old "meres" would be set up to
assure that these thoroughbreds are properly
broken in and bedded down, and to .see to it that
a certain amount of horse sense is imprarted [sic]
to them before they are turned out to pasture for
breeding purposes.

our fillies should be kept on the olher side of the
