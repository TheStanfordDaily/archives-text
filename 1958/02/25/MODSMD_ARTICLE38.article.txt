# 'No Hope' Bruins Invade Pavilion Saturday Night
## 
### 
When Johnny Wooden and his
UCLA Bruins hit the northern
road this weekend for games with
Cal and Stanford, they'll come
without the stars that have been
â€¢ in their eyes for a good portion
of the season.
UCLA went into last weekend's
series in the Southland with a pos
sibility that they might close the
margin of leadership which their
northern cousins from the Univer
i sity of California hold over the
I Pacific Coast race.
Looked ISright
Things were looking bright up
! to Saturday afternoon, although
the Bruins were breathing sighs
i of relief after squeezing by Stan
ford Friday night, 46-43. But then
came Oregon State's Beavers and
big Dave Gambee. and the Uclans
; found that things can shift from
light to dark in a mighty big
hurry. With Gambee heaving in
30 counters, the Beavers turned
back the Bruins, 77-61.
Now resting in third place in
the conference, two full games be
, hind Cal's Bears and one game
back of the Beavers, UCLA has
1 little hope of jumping back into

contention for the title. Cal has
three games left on its schedule,
and none of them should be a
problem. This week end the Bears
also meet Idaho, and next week
they wind it up with Oregon.
Questionable FJIeH
What effects the southerners'
despondency over this turn of
events will have on Saturday
night's game with the Indians is
simply a matter of conjecture.
Stanford head basketball coach
Howie Dallmar gave his boys the
day off yesterday while he jour
neyed to the Northern California
Basketball Writers luncheon in
the city to praise captain Paul
Neumann, who dumped in 25
markers against Southern Cali
fornia and 9 against UCLA.
"It was the best week end in
Neumann's career," he said. Be
sides his scoring, Neumann ex
celled in other offensive and de
fensive play.
Before last Friday night the se
ries between the Indians and the
Bruins stood at 51 games each,
and now, with the balance tipped,
Stanford will have the added in
centive of trying to even up the
history.
