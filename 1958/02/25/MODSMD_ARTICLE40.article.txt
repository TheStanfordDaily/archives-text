# Rig Lauds Mays In Opening Drills
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ar iz. (/P) The San i
Francisco Giants' Willie Mays i
drew a nod of approval from j
Manager Hill Rigney duiing his
first workout yesterday.
Rigney watched Willie taking
his swipes and said, "There's the j
guy who's going to break Babe I
Ruth's home run record. And
with the shorter center - field'
fence in Seals Stadium, I would
n't be at all surprised if he did it
this year."
Mays shrugged the prediction [
off. "Once you get 50 homers,"
he said, "those pitchers don't
throw up anything good."
