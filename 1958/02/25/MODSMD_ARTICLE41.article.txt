# Papoose Cagers Face Tough Weekend Sched
## 
### 
Incomprehensible will be the
only word that could describe the
l'rosh cagers if they can defeat
their two foes coming up this
weekend in t lie Pavilion. Friday
night the locals will tangle with
San Jose Junior College and Sat
urday they take on City College
of San Francisco.
Stanford hits the practice floor
this afternoon and with hard
work hopes to at least even up
their C-7 season record. Both
teams the locals face this week

end ore older, more expei ienced
and rated highly in their respec
tive leagues.
Last Monday the Papooses'
second â€¢ hall rally fell short as
Cal's Cubs dumped them 51-15.
In this lilt as well as in other
recent contests the yearlings
seemed to do fine in the first
half. But ;i jinx hit them midway
into the second period.
They came driving back after
live minutes or so but never quite
had enough time to gain the lead.
In their last three games Stan
lord has lost by no more than six
points.
