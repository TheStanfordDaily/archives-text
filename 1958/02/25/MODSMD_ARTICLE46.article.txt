# Found: One Automobile; Where? 5 Feet Under Mud
## 
### Morrie Hodges 
This rainy season provokes memories of storms of other years
and calls to mind the one outstanding rainy day in Stanford's history
when 1000 cars were bogged down while the owners watched a foot
ball game.
The date of this memorable mudhole of a parking lot was Nov. 18.

seven years ago, the day when
loyal fans braved the rain to
watch Army beat Stanford. 7-0.
The parking lot outside the
stadium was firm when the cars
were parked, but the huge deluge
fell during the game and the
parking lot had become a trap by
the time the owners claimed their
cars.
One was found under five feet
of mud.
The spectators seemed to enjoy
the excitement and some took off
their shoes and wiggled their
toes in Ihe mud. It was more se
rious for the tow trucks which
were at work until Monday morn
ing extricating the cars. Tractors
reinforced the tow truck corps,
but the tractors also bogged
down and had to be pulled loose
with winches.
Traffic Jam
Further complications set in
when the underpass on Univer
sity Avenue flooded. Three lanes
of traffic went to the game, but
only one could leave through the
underpass, creating a huge traf
fic jam.
The year after that, rains
flooded Loma Verde Avenue in
Palo Alto with two feet of water
and poured into garages and
basements. The Palo Alto Times
reported a woman remained busy
"pulling children out of mudholes
all week long."
Worst Storm
The worst storm in this area's
history was two seasons ago when
1000 Palo Altoans fled their
homes and took refuge in Jordan
Junior High School and with oth
er families. The four days of in
tense rain forced the people to
flee only three days before
Christmas.
San Francisquito Creek over
flowed and a dike broke causing
Ihe flood. In slab houses Ihe
water rushed in one door and out
Ihe other; Ihe water in some of
the Palo Alto streets reached lev
els of two feet. Manhole covers
floated away, creating a hazard
for- rescuers.

There were four floods during
the rainy season of 1937, and the
swollen San Francisquito Creek
covered Mayfield Avenue on cam
pus with four feet of water. Lake
Lagunita overflowed onto Gover
nor's Avenue and flooded Encina
which was then the freshman
men's dormitory.
Five seasons ago, the rains
caused a freak accident when the
eastern end of Dumbarton Bridge
was covered with "snow." Oils
from plants in the water of the
nearby salt ponds formed piles of
foam which the intense winds of
the storms blew across the
bridge.
