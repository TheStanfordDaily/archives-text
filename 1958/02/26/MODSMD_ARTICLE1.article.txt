# Judicial Changes Debate Pinpoints Open Hearings
## Seventeen Students Attend; Eight Come as Spectators 
### Roger Folsom 
Robert Guild, author of the Judicial Council procedure initiative
now being considered by Legislature, discussed the measure with
Men's Council chairman Gordon Tinker yesterday afternoon in Cub
berley Auditoriumâ€”before an audience of 17 people.
Only eight of the 17 were "interested students." All the others

| were officially connected with the
meeting in some way, either as
members of the judicial councils,
Legislature or the Off-Campus
Men's Club, which sponsored the
j discussion.
According to its present rules
of procedure, the Judicial Council
holds all hearings completely con
fidential. Also the council must
present all evidence and testimo
ny before the defendant and hear
; his defense: "The council shall
j not be entitled to consider any
evidence or opinions which the
defendant has not heard and had
an opportunity to meet directly,
either by specific rebutting evi
dence or by cross-examination of
the witness."
Test imony Presented
In practice the council never
confronts accused with accuser,
but presents the testimony to the
defendant.
Tinker stated that if both ac
cuser and accused agreed, it might
be a good idea if hearings were
public. But he opposed public
hearings on the request of the de
fendant alone.
"If the defendant were inno
cent," he said, "a public trial
would publicly ridicule the ac
cuser, who had done nothing but
live up to his responsibilities un
der the Honor Code."
Regarding guilty defendants, he
said, "If a person were guilty, 1
don't think he'd want a public
trial."
75 Per (lent Return
Tinker went on to state that 75
per cent of those suspended by
the councils since 1950 have re
turned to graduate or are now pre
paring for graduation. If these
suspensions had resulted from a
public trial, it "would be hard for
the defendant to come back and
continue."
Guild agreed it might be hard
for a guilty defendant to return
to school if his case had been pub
licly discussed, but he said it was
the defendant's right and respon
sibility to make the choice.
Answering Tinker's worry that
public opinion would be unfair to
accusers and witnesses, Guild
said: "There is no reason |to deny
the right of an open trial to the
defendant or to forbid cross-exam
ination | if a person is not going to
face persecution. And if he is
going to be persecuted. Stanford
does not deserve the honor sys
tem."
M ess in ye r Disagrees
Disagreeing, student body pres
ident Jim Messinger said, "In the
past, people have been threatened
with physical violence; they have
been ostracized by campus
groups; they have been forced to
leave campus by public opinion."
Guild countered with the opin
ion that "persecution would not
continue if the overwhelming
weight of student opinion were
against it."
Tinker and Guild agreed that
much of the referendum has al
ready been incorporated into a
modified code of procedure now
awaiting approval by Legislature.
Although much of the proposed
change has been adopted by this
council pending legislative approv
al, Guild believes it is necessary
to include this material in the
ASSU bylaws so that it will be
binding on future councils.
