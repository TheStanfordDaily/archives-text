# Chaparral Changes G-Day
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
We see it hut wo still don't be
lieve it. However, maybe the
Chappie IS in touch with old
Gregory and got his permission
to change Groundhog Day. We
always thought G Day was Feb.
2.
In spitn of delay, the Chappie
is a well-written back - patting
pamphlet. Before reaching the
mythical pith of the pulp one has
to wade through multitudinous
letters to the editor. The aurora
of "We think the Chappie's fun
ny" can be avoided by closing the
eyes and turning the page quick
iy-
The Doddering Dissolute, us ex
pected, rehashes the "favorable
comment" of his last publication.
We must admit that several of
the "February Funnies" are mod

erately clever. But we understood
it to mean
Bill Sater presents the perfect
Civ Blue Book Special in his slop
py synthesis of the Middle Ages
and Valentines. We always
spelled it "have," but perhaps the
Civ Dept. accepts "alive" now.
After reading Mr. Funkhous
er's contribution we came to the
conclusion we prefer fishing to
skiing and Walton to the Chappie.
However, some may enjoy this
generously spaced page and a
half.
Three cheers for the African
Queen! We took great pleasure
in seeing Miss Miner's face.
"A Fable of the Farm" sounds
interesting. Unfortunately peru
sal proves it to be an extension
| of the letters to the editor with
'an appropriate squib by the Dod

dering Dissolute "We're glad to
know that we've been doing the
job this year."
Resurrecting an ancient funny,
the Chappie has turned one whole
page over to ANOTHER proof
reading of the Gettysburg Ad
dress. Mr. Webster has been us
ing that gag in the back of his
books for lo these many years.
Finally, the editors of the pulp
wind things up on page 39 by
lolling the reader (who has paid
35 cents), . . you are a clod
without a sense (if humor and
you can go to hell."
There is hope for loyal Chap
pie readers, however. The next
issue (whenever it may come
out) will contain a brilliant sa
tiric essay by members of The
Daily's staff. Start saving your
pennies.

Resurrecting an ancient funny,
the Chappie has turned one whole
page over to ANOTHER proof

dress. Mr. Webster has been us

books for lo these many years.
Finally, the editors of the pulp
wind things up on page 39 by
lolling the reader (who has paid
35 cents), . . you are a clod
without a sense (if humor and
you can go to hell."
There is hope for loyal Chap

spelled it "have," but perhaps the
Civ Dept. accepts "alive" now.
After reading Mr. Funkhous
er's contribution we came to the
conclusion we prefer fishing to
skiing and Walton to the Chappie.
However, some may enjoy this
generously spaced page and a
half.
Three cheers for the African
Queen! We took great pleasure
in seeing Miss Miner's face.
"A Fable of the Farm" sounds
interesting. Unfortunately peru
