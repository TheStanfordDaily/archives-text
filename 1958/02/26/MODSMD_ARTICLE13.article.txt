# Expanded Hostel Program Outlined for Spring Term
## 
### 
A new concept in student hos
tels was introduced Mon d a y
night at Cardinals Board meeting
and definite plans were set for an
expanded program of the week

end discussion groups next quar
ter.
Starting on a limited basis this
spring, clubs, living groups,
classes, such as Western Civiliza
tion sections and Senior Collo
quia, and other campus organiza
tions may apply to the Hostel
Committee and arrange a one- or
two - day hostel for academic
work, independent discussion, or
for an administrative meeting to
work out club business.
Discussion Sections
Hostels up to now have been
discussion sections of 10 to 20
people, led by one or two profes
sors, at secluded camps in the
hills around Stanford. They offer
an opportunity for students to
get away from campus and pur
sue an intellectual discussion on
subjects of general interest.
Students sleep in sleeping bags
in the camp lodge and men Is arc
provided. The total cost for the
24-hour stay has been $3.50. Indi
viduals sign up for the hostel on
posted lists.
Definitely in Fall
This spring possibly, but defi
nitely next autumn, Hostel Chair
man Dick Coffing hopes to make
these hostel facilities available to
private groups, so that they may
go on the hostel as an organiza
tion. The groups may apply to
have professors lead discussions.
He envisages the time when
three or four hostels may take
place in a single week, on both a
sign-up and group basis.
Immediate plans for next quar
ter include five hostels open to
the entire student body on the
second through seventh week
ends of the quarter. There is
also the possibility of a sixth hos
tel on the first weekend.
Three of the discussion sec
tions are definitely set for the

Jones Gulch YMCA Camp near
La Honda, one at Hidden Villa in
Los Altos, and another at the
ranch of ASSU Vice-President
Wendy Hawley.
One of these hostels will be a
two - night meeting, Friday to
Sunday, led by Werner Warm
brunn, the foreign student advis
er, and will include six exchange
scholars in the group.
In a statement prepared by
Coffin and Cardinals President
Tom Decker, the Board outlined
the main problems of the hostel
program: (1) limited student
knowledge of the opportunities
and (2) lack of an adequate per
manent facility. A misunder
standing with the owners of a
camp site led to the cancellation
of one hostel last quarter and
there has always been a problem
finding locations for the groups.
Hostel Land
Coffin recommended that a
lodge be built somewhere on
Stanford land out of the imme
diate campus area, to be used
solely for hostels.
This is a plan for the future
and the current lack of such a fa
cility is the main reason why the
private group hostels may not be
able to start on a full program
until next autumn quarter. So
far the Stanford "Y" group and
the lIR Executive Committee are
the only groups now able to have
group hostels this spring.
