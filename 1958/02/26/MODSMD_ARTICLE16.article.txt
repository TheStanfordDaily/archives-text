### Stew Toy, Editor 
Sophomore Thomas Wallace
Cordry 111 shot and killed a Palo
Alto high school coed last night
in his car near the ROTC rifle
range. He is being held by the
Santa Clara County sheriff's of
fice on investigation of murder.
The victim, Deena Bonn, was
a 17 • year - old Cubberley High
School student who lived across
the street from Cordry at 237 Ed
lee St., Palo Alto. Cordry, who
depledged Alpha Sigma Phi fra
ternity last quarter, lives at 21f>
Ed lee St.
Cordry told the sheriff's office
what Captain William Salt called
"an incredible story." According
to Salt, "the boy said he pur
chased a .22 rifle and ammuni
tion in the afternoon for the pur
pose of picking up a girl, killing
her, raping her, and leaving her
body in the hills—in that order.
"Then he drove around at ran
dom. looking for a victim, but
was unsuccessful and returned
home about 10 p.m.
"He phoned Deena Bonn, who
lived across the street, and said
he had to take a trip north and
would she drive him to the sta
tion and bring his car home."
Cordry then "drove across the
street to get the girl, slid over and
asked her to drive, and then said
he had to return a rifle to cam
pus."
"They drove out to the campus,
passed the ROTC buildings |ncar
the rifle range] and he asked her
to turn in. As she was slowing
down, he pointed the rifle at hot
head and pulled the trigger."
"Cordry then "drove one-half
mile up Sandhill Road to carry
out his plan, thought better of it,
and drove to the Palo Alto police
station and gave himself up.
Cordry turned himself in to the
Palo Alto police at 10:48 p.m. He
told the desk sergeant, "I want to
report a killing. I kill<*d a girl
and she's out in the car in front."
"He said he did not rape her.
The boy didn't seem to be re
morseful. The only reason he
could give was that he had an
urge to do this and that he had
had this urge before. The only
previous time he had been out
with her was to a movie before
Christmas."
Cordry, Salt said, "thought the
girl died instantly. He said they
weren't lovers."
Miss Bonn was pronounced
dead on arrival at the police sta
tion.
Police found a suitcase in the
back of the car containing a
length of clothesline rope, a small
hammer and a jacket.
A friend told The Daily that
Cordry "seemed to be a very nice
fellow," and that "as far as 1
know he is a normal, church go
ing guy."
He is an international relations
major and was a member of the
freshman tennis team.
Cordry lives alone in Palo Alto.
Police gave his parents' address
as 1001 Chestnut St., San Fran
cisco.
A formal charge is pending a
blood alcohol test and further in
vestigation, Carlson said.

Cordry 111 shot and killed a Palo
Alto high school coed last night
in his car near the ROTC rifle
range. He is being held by the
Santa Clara County sheriff's of
fice on investigation of murder.
The victim, Deena Bonn, was
a 17 • year - old Cubberley High
School student who lived across
the street from Cordry at 237 Ed
lee St., Palo Alto. Cordry, who
depledged Alpha Sigma Phi fra
ternity last quarter, lives at 21f>
Ed lee St.
Cordry told the sheriff's office
what Captain William Salt called
"an incredible story." According
to Salt, "the boy said he pur
chased a .22 rifle and ammuni
tion in the afternoon for the pur
pose of picking up a girl, killing
her, raping her, and leaving her
body in the hills—in that order.
"Then he drove around at ran
dom. looking for a victim, but
was unsuccessful and returned
home about 10 p.m.
"He phoned Deena Bonn, who
lived across the street, and said
he had to take a trip north and
would she drive him to the sta
tion and bring his car home."
Cordry then "drove across the
street to get the girl, slid over and
asked her to drive, and then said
he had to return a rifle to cam
pus."
"They drove out to the campus,
passed the ROTC buildings |ncar
the rifle range] and he asked her
to turn in. As she was slowing
down, he pointed the rifle at hot
head and pulled the trigger."
"Cordry then "drove one-half
mile up Sandhill Road to carry
out his plan, thought better of it,
and drove to the Palo Alto police
station and gave himself up.
Cordry turned himself in to the
Palo Alto police at 10:48 p.m. He
told the desk sergeant, "I want to
report a killing. I kill<*d a girl
and she's out in the car in front."
"He said he did not rape her.
The boy didn't seem to be re
morseful. The only reason he
could give was that he had an
urge to do this and that he had
had this urge before. The only
previous time he had been out
with her was to a movie before
Christmas."
Cordry, Salt said, "thought the
girl died instantly. He said they
weren't lovers."
Miss Bonn was pronounced
dead on arrival at the police sta
tion.
Police found a suitcase in the
back of the car containing a
length of clothesline rope, a small
hammer and a jacket.
