A Pleasant Place to Be
Editor, The Daily:
This criticism is aimed not at The Daily but at
Ihc closemindedness of all too many of its read
ers. It is a sad commentary on tho reading ability
<if the Stanford student body that all but a few
hundred students persist in believing lhat the
International Center is for the use of foreign
students only. There has been abundant notice
in The Daily and elsewhere that the"I" Center is
at the disposal of the entire University, but ap
parently the average reader sees the word "Inter
national" and his mind snaps shut; no Americans
allowed.
There could hardly bo a wronger [sie| assump
tion. One of the major aims of the Center is pro
viding an area where American and foreign stu
dents might get together on mutually interesting
lerms, with mutual benefit.
What is particularly unfortunate is that, in
being mistaken about the Center, many Ameri
cans are cutting themselves out of the unique
advantages it offers. One very significant part of
a college education is gaining the sort of world
awareness that comes from knowing foreign stu
dents. In this respect the"I" Center presents an
opportunity that must take an especially deter
mined provinciality to ignore.
Beyond this, it is simply a pleasant place to be.
In welcome contrast to the vacant, rather water
proof a-spect of most student lounges, the Center
is very much a home, with comfortable chairs
even. One particular distinction is that there you
may buy the only 5-cent coffee on campus. For
the students who are looking for outside activi
ties, there is unlimited opportunity to work on
any of the innumerable projects of tho still-young
Center. And it is at the Center that many of the
most informal and most enjoyable functions on
campus take place ask any of the 150 persons
who went to the "Dutch Evening" last Saturday.
For many reasons the International Center is
a place worth knowing about knowing about.

What About Parachuting?
Editor, The Daily:
What about this new sport of parachuting?
Are any of you men or women interested in form
ing or joining a parachute club on or near your
campus? Would you like to learn the new sport
of sky diving? What about holding an individual

West Coast in the near future?

/)////, Seared and Silent
Editor, The Daily:
Your Feb. 19. 1958, issue contains an editorial
in which you make an abortive effort to present
the reasons for so many Stanford students being
Dull. May I add that not only is the Stanford
student Dull; he is also Silent. Afraid, Deluded,
without any sense of social responsibility, and

lacks any courage to stand up for any beliefs or
any cause.
By discus-sing coed social regulations, honor
codes, 18-year-old drinking and Democratic-Repub
lican squabbles, this Stanford student deludes
himself into believing that he is doing something
important. This provinciality is only surpassed
by his Silence and Dullness.
Thi« Dull, Scared and Silent student comes to
the University as a freshman wilh his prejudices,
adolescent values and "all-Americ an" beliefs, and
he leaves the University four years later with
diploma in hand and with the same prejudices,
values and beliefs he had when he entered.
He makes a feeble attempt to rebel to his
formerly restricted environment by rebelling
here at Stanford in -some physical exhibitionism.
He dares not rebel mentally; he has neither the
instruction nor the independence necessary to
freely exercise his rights of differences of opin
ion. In most instances he feels no restriction on
his independence, for he expresses no opinion or
thoughts worth restricting. There is no reason
why any Administration would try to restrict
freedom of expression (of the press) when the
students find only a compulsion to discuss and
get "all shook up" over social regulations, or how
to win bridge card games.
For the past few weeks you have been printing
daily the words of President Sterling, "The great
principle of freedom of the press should operate
just as strongly on campus as elsewhere." YES,
it should! However, as one Professor Chafee (no,
he is not here at Stanford) has stated, "Freedom
of expression belongs to a people which is free
from tear." Of course, the cry will come up (on
second thought, I don't think any cry will come
forth). "But the Stanford student is free from
fear!" The answer to that is that an individual or
group that is preoccupied with card games, social
regulations and such has nothing to fear from
anybody, particularly from any Administration.
And so the Dull. Silent student goes through
thi-s University to come out and become a Dull,
Silent and Scared citizen, a citizen without any
sense of social responsibility, a dangerous citizen.
And this Silent, Fearful citizen IS dangerous, for
he dares not indulge in independent thought, nor
does he dare express such a thought - assuming
he has had the instruction to develop such
thought.
Who is to blame for this Dullness, this Silence,
this Fear, this Delusion? The student himself?
But the Stanford student doesn't even recognize
the existence of any Fear, Silence, or Dullness.
To the Stanford student, all is well with the world.
So he continues his bridge card games, he con
tinues his squabbling over honor code systems,
and he continues the dangerous expression of his
dangerous ideas on coed social regulations.

We're sorry if our editorial efforts to assign
a cause to student dullness were abortive, aixl
we wish the writer of this letter would take
time from his Loud, Courageous, Socially Re
sponsible pursuits to make that effort himself,
rather than simply restating the problem. How
ever, we did learn one thing from his letter;
its signature points up the truth in the writer's
statement that Stanford students are "fearful"
and lacking in "eourage to stand up for any
beliefs or any cause." —Editor.

/)////, Seared and Silent
Editor, The Daily:
Your Feb. 19. 1958, issue contains an editorial
in which you make an abortive effort to present
the reasons for so many Stanford students being
Dull. May I add that not only is the Stanford
student Dull; he is also Silent. Afraid, Deluded,
without any sense of social responsibility, and

lacks any courage to stand up for any beliefs or
any cause.
By discus-sing coed social regulations, honor
codes, 18-year-old drinking and Democratic-Repub
lican squabbles, this Stanford student deludes
himself into believing that he is doing something
important. This provinciality is only surpassed
by his Silence and Dullness.
Thi« Dull, Scared and Silent student comes to
the University as a freshman wilh his prejudices,
adolescent values and "all-Americ an" beliefs, and
he leaves the University four years later with
diploma in hand and with the same prejudices,
values and beliefs he had when he entered.
He makes a feeble attempt to rebel to his
formerly restricted environment by rebelling
here at Stanford in -some physical exhibitionism.
He dares not rebel mentally; he has neither the
instruction nor the independence necessary to
freely exercise his rights of differences of opin
ion. In most instances he feels no restriction on
his independence, for he expresses no opinion or
thoughts worth restricting. There is no reason
why any Administration would try to restrict
freedom of expression (of the press) when the
students find only a compulsion to discuss and
get "all shook up" over social regulations, or how
to win bridge card games.
For the past few weeks you have been printing
daily the words of President Sterling, "The great
principle of freedom of the press should operate
just as strongly on campus as elsewhere." YES,
it should! However, as one Professor Chafee (no,
he is not here at Stanford) has stated, "Freedom
of expression belongs to a people which is free
from tear." Of course, the cry will come up (on
second thought, I don't think any cry will come
forth). "But the Stanford student is free from
fear!" The answer to that is that an individual or
group that is preoccupied with card games, social
regulations and such has nothing to fear from
anybody, particularly from any Administration.
And so the Dull. Silent student goes through
thi-s University to come out and become a Dull,
Silent and Scared citizen, a citizen without any
sense of social responsibility, a dangerous citizen.
And this Silent, Fearful citizen IS dangerous, for
he dares not indulge in independent thought, nor
does he dare express such a thought - assuming
he has had the instruction to develop such
thought.
Who is to blame for this Dullness, this Silence,
this Fear, this Delusion? The student himself?
But the Stanford student doesn't even recognize
the existence of any Fear, Silence, or Dullness.
To the Stanford student, all is well with the world.
So he continues his bridge card games, he con
tinues his squabbling over honor code systems,
and he continues the dangerous expression of his
dangerous ideas on coed social regulations.

A Pleasant Place to Be
Editor, The Daily:
This criticism is aimed not at The Daily but at
Ihc closemindedness of all too many of its read
ers. It is a sad commentary on tho reading ability
<if the Stanford student body that all but a few
hundred students persist in believing lhat the
International Center is for the use of foreign
students only. There has been abundant notice
in The Daily and elsewhere that the"I" Center is
at the disposal of the entire University, but ap
parently the average reader sees the word "Inter
national" and his mind snaps shut; no Americans
allowed.
There could hardly bo a wronger [sie| assump
tion. One of the major aims of the Center is pro
viding an area where American and foreign stu
dents might get together on mutually interesting
lerms, with mutual benefit.
What is particularly unfortunate is that, in
being mistaken about the Center, many Ameri
cans are cutting themselves out of the unique
advantages it offers. One very significant part of
a college education is gaining the sort of world
awareness that comes from knowing foreign stu
dents. In this respect the"I" Center presents an
opportunity that must take an especially deter
mined provinciality to ignore.
Beyond this, it is simply a pleasant place to be.
In welcome contrast to the vacant, rather water
proof a-spect of most student lounges, the Center
is very much a home, with comfortable chairs
even. One particular distinction is that there you
may buy the only 5-cent coffee on campus. For
the students who are looking for outside activi
ties, there is unlimited opportunity to work on
any of the innumerable projects of tho still-young
Center. And it is at the Center that many of the
most informal and most enjoyable functions on

He makes a feeble attempt to rebel to his
formerly restricted environment by rebelling
here at Stanford in -some physical exhibitionism.
He dares not rebel mentally; he has neither the
instruction nor the independence necessary to
freely exercise his rights of differences of opin
ion. In most instances he feels no restriction on
his independence, for he expresses no opinion or
thoughts worth restricting. There is no reason
why any Administration would try to restrict
freedom of expression (of the press) when the
students find only a compulsion to discuss and
get "all shook up" over social regulations, or how
to win bridge card games.
For the past few weeks you have been printing
daily the words of President Sterling, "The great
principle of freedom of the press should operate
just as strongly on campus as elsewhere." YES,
it should! However, as one Professor Chafee (no,
he is not here at Stanford) has stated, "Freedom
of expression belongs to a people which is free
from tear." Of course, the cry will come up (on
second thought, I don't think any cry will come
forth). "But the Stanford student is free from
fear!" The answer to that is that an individual or
group that is preoccupied with card games, social
regulations and such has nothing to fear from
anybody, particularly from any Administration.
And so the Dull. Silent student goes through
thi-s University to come out and become a Dull,
Silent and Scared citizen, a citizen without any
sense of social responsibility, a dangerous citizen.
And this Silent, Fearful citizen IS dangerous, for
he dares not indulge in independent thought, nor
does he dare express such a thought - assuming
he has had the instruction to develop such
thought.
Who is to blame for this Dullness, this Silence,
this Fear, this Delusion? The student himself?
But the Stanford student doesn't even recognize
the existence of any Fear, Silence, or Dullness.
To the Stanford student, all is well with the world.
So he continues his bridge card games, he con
tinues his squabbling over honor code systems,
and he continues the dangerous expression of his
dangerous ideas on coed social regulations.

A Pleasant Place to Be
Editor, The Daily:
This criticism is aimed not at The Daily but at
Ihc closemindedness of all too many of its read
ers. It is a sad commentary on tho reading ability
<if the Stanford student body that all but a few
hundred students persist in believing lhat the
International Center is for the use of foreign
students only. There has been abundant notice
in The Daily and elsewhere that the"I" Center is
at the disposal of the entire University, but ap
parently the average reader sees the word "Inter
national" and his mind snaps shut; no Americans
allowed.
There could hardly bo a wronger [sie| assump
tion. One of the major aims of the Center is pro
viding an area where American and foreign stu
dents might get together on mutually interesting
lerms, with mutual benefit.
What is particularly unfortunate is that, in
being mistaken about the Center, many Ameri
cans are cutting themselves out of the unique
advantages it offers. One very significant part of
a college education is gaining the sort of world
awareness that comes from knowing foreign stu
dents. In this respect the"I" Center presents an
opportunity that must take an especially deter
mined provinciality to ignore.
Beyond this, it is simply a pleasant place to be.
In welcome contrast to the vacant, rather water
proof a-spect of most student lounges, the Center
is very much a home, with comfortable chairs
even. One particular distinction is that there you
may buy the only 5-cent coffee on campus. For
the students who are looking for outside activi
ties, there is unlimited opportunity to work on
any of the innumerable projects of tho still-young
Center. And it is at the Center that many of the
most informal and most enjoyable functions on
campus take place ask any of the 150 persons
who went to the "Dutch Evening" last Saturday.
For many reasons the International Center is
a place worth knowing about knowing about.

Editor, The Daily:
Your Feb. 19. 1958, issue contains an editorial
in which you make an abortive effort to present
the reasons for so many Stanford students being
Dull. May I add that not only is the Stanford
student Dull; he is also Silent. Afraid, Deluded,
without any sense of social responsibility, and

lacks any courage to stand up for any beliefs or
any cause.
By discus-sing coed social regulations, honor
codes, 18-year-old drinking and Democratic-Repub
lican squabbles, this Stanford student deludes
himself into believing that he is doing something
important. This provinciality is only surpassed
by his Silence and Dullness.

this Fear, this Delusion? The student himself?
But the Stanford student doesn't even recognize
the existence of any Fear, Silence, or Dullness.
To the Stanford student, all is well with the world.
So he continues his bridge card games, he con
tinues his squabbling over honor code systems,
and he continues the dangerous expression of his
dangerous ideas on coed social regulations.

we wish the writer of this letter would take

A Pleasant Place to Be
Editor, The Daily:
This criticism is aimed not at The Daily but at
Ihc closemindedness of all too many of its read
ers. It is a sad commentary on tho reading ability
<if the Stanford student body that all but a few
hundred students persist in believing lhat the
International Center is for the use of foreign
students only. There has been abundant notice
in The Daily and elsewhere that the"I" Center is
at the disposal of the entire University, but ap
parently the average reader sees the word "Inter
national" and his mind snaps shut; no Americans
allowed.
There could hardly bo a wronger [sie| assump
tion. One of the major aims of the Center is pro
viding an area where American and foreign stu
dents might get together on mutually interesting
lerms, with mutual benefit.
What is particularly unfortunate is that, in
being mistaken about the Center, many Ameri
cans are cutting themselves out of the unique
advantages it offers. One very significant part of
a college education is gaining the sort of world
awareness that comes from knowing foreign stu
dents. In this respect the"I" Center presents an
opportunity that must take an especially deter
mined provinciality to ignore.
Beyond this, it is simply a pleasant place to be.
In welcome contrast to the vacant, rather water
proof a-spect of most student lounges, the Center
is very much a home, with comfortable chairs
even. One particular distinction is that there you
may buy the only 5-cent coffee on campus. For
the students who are looking for outside activi
ties, there is unlimited opportunity to work on
any of the innumerable projects of tho still-young
Center. And it is at the Center that many of the
most informal and most enjoyable functions on
campus take place ask any of the 150 persons
who went to the "Dutch Evening" last Saturday.
For many reasons the International Center is
a place worth knowing about knowing about.

/)////, Seared and Silent
Editor, The Daily:
Your Feb. 19. 1958, issue contains an editorial
in which you make an abortive effort to present
the reasons for so many Stanford students being
Dull. May I add that not only is the Stanford
student Dull; he is also Silent. Afraid, Deluded,
without any sense of social responsibility, and

lacks any courage to stand up for any beliefs or
any cause.
By discus-sing coed social regulations, honor
codes, 18-year-old drinking and Democratic-Repub
lican squabbles, this Stanford student deludes
himself into believing that he is doing something
important. This provinciality is only surpassed
by his Silence and Dullness.
Thi« Dull, Scared and Silent student comes to
the University as a freshman wilh his prejudices,
adolescent values and "all-Americ an" beliefs, and
he leaves the University four years later with
diploma in hand and with the same prejudices,
values and beliefs he had when he entered.
He makes a feeble attempt to rebel to his
formerly restricted environment by rebelling
here at Stanford in -some physical exhibitionism.
He dares not rebel mentally; he has neither the
instruction nor the independence necessary to
freely exercise his rights of differences of opin
ion. In most instances he feels no restriction on
his independence, for he expresses no opinion or
thoughts worth restricting. There is no reason
why any Administration would try to restrict
freedom of expression (of the press) when the
students find only a compulsion to discuss and
get "all shook up" over social regulations, or how
to win bridge card games.
For the past few weeks you have been printing
daily the words of President Sterling, "The great
principle of freedom of the press should operate
just as strongly on campus as elsewhere." YES,
it should! However, as one Professor Chafee (no,
he is not here at Stanford) has stated, "Freedom
of expression belongs to a people which is free
from tear." Of course, the cry will come up (on
second thought, I don't think any cry will come
forth). "But the Stanford student is free from
fear!" The answer to that is that an individual or
group that is preoccupied with card games, social
regulations and such has nothing to fear from
anybody, particularly from any Administration.
And so the Dull. Silent student goes through
thi-s University to come out and become a Dull,
Silent and Scared citizen, a citizen without any
sense of social responsibility, a dangerous citizen.
And this Silent, Fearful citizen IS dangerous, for
he dares not indulge in independent thought, nor
does he dare express such a thought - assuming
he has had the instruction to develop such
thought.
Who is to blame for this Dullness, this Silence,
this Fear, this Delusion? The student himself?
But the Stanford student doesn't even recognize
the existence of any Fear, Silence, or Dullness.
To the Stanford student, all is well with the world.
So he continues his bridge card games, he con
tinues his squabbling over honor code systems,
and he continues the dangerous expression of his
dangerous ideas on coed social regulations.
