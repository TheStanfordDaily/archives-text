Dave Bernstein, a graduate I
physics student, was the winner
of the bridge contest which ran
in last Tuesday's Daily. Dave !
made the 4 bids correctly, and his j
play of the problem hand was j
flawless. The first prize, a bridge i
book of his choice, can be picked j
up at the Peninsula Book Store, j
Tied for second with one bid
ding error were Eben Carlson,
Jack Ewing and Alan Bell. Each
will receive one free play at the
Cardinal Bridge Club.
Next week's column will con
lain the solution to the contest's
double dummy hand. The bidding j
sequences are repeated for your
convenience.

Your hand:
* KJ.XG V 7 ♦ AQ92 *KJ73
Here are the solutions: the cor
rect bid in the first hand is Pass.
Your partner's bid of 4 No
Trump is not a Blackwood Con
vention Bid to ask for the number'
of aces you hold. Your partner
has 15 or 1(5 points, and he's ask
ing you to pass if you have a
minimum 1 No Trump bid (i.e.,
1(5 points) and bid (> No Trump if
you have a maximum (i.e., 18
points).
Only two people made the cor
rect bid of 2 Clubs on the second
hand. This is, admittedly, an ex
port bid. Two Clubs forces your

| partner to game, and asks him to
! choose between one of tlie other
| suits.
If partner bids 2 Diamonds you
intend to bid 3 Clubs asking him
to choose a major suit. If (this is
very unlikely* he doosnt' have a
I card major suit, but he does
have a club stopper, he should bid
3 No Trump over 3 Clubs.
It's true that a cue bid in the
opponents' suit usually guaran
tees first round control (the ace
or a void) besides forcing partner
to game, but in this hand you
must distort your distribution a
little to insure reaching game.
Two Hearts or 2 Spades are not
considered absolute forces in this
bidding sequence, and you can't
bid 2 No Trump without a club
stopper.
The third hand illustrates the
situation on which most begin
ning bridge players go wrong.
When your partner doubles, and
you have a weak hand, it is im
perative that you bid. You can't
pass the double with less than 3
trump tricks. And you shouldn't
bid 1 No Trump with less than 7
points including a stopper in the
opponents' suit.
Since your only 4 card suit is
Hearts, you should make the
cheapest possible bid, 1 Spade.
You only have 3 spades, but your
partner doubled 1 Heart, so he
probably has 4 cards in the other

major, Spades. It's bettor to lio
a little about your distribution,
when you have sueh a weak hand.
Though you have 14 high card
points in the fourth hand, you
should pass. If you pass the op
ponents will probably get into
trouble, but if you bid it will be
the oiher way around. If you
double, your partner will prob
ably respond. 2 Hearts. If this is
doubled, you'll probably find
yourself playing 2 No Trump
doubled, down 2 or 3, when the
opponents probably can't make a
game.

Here are the solutions: the cor
rect bid in the first hand is Pass.
Your partner's bid of 4 No
Trump is not a Blackwood Con
vention Bid to ask for the number'
of aces you hold. Your partner
has 15 or 1(5 points, and he's ask
ing you to pass if you have a
minimum 1 No Trump bid (i.e.,
1(5 points) and bid (> No Trump if
you have a maximum (i.e., 18
points).
Only two people made the cor
rect bid of 2 Clubs on the second
hand. This is, admittedly, an ex
port bid. Two Clubs forces your

| partner to game, and asks him to
! choose between one of tlie other
| suits.
If partner bids 2 Diamonds you
intend to bid 3 Clubs asking him
to choose a major suit. If (this is
very unlikely* he doosnt' have a
I card major suit, but he does
have a club stopper, he should bid
3 No Trump over 3 Clubs.
It's true that a cue bid in the
opponents' suit usually guaran
tees first round control (the ace
or a void) besides forcing partner
to game, but in this hand you
must distort your distribution a
little to insure reaching game.
Two Hearts or 2 Spades are not
considered absolute forces in this
bidding sequence, and you can't
bid 2 No Trump without a club
stopper.
The third hand illustrates the
situation on which most begin
ning bridge players go wrong.
When your partner doubles, and
you have a weak hand, it is im
perative that you bid. You can't
pass the double with less than 3
trump tricks. And you shouldn't
bid 1 No Trump with less than 7
points including a stopper in the
opponents' suit.
Since your only 4 card suit is
Hearts, you should make the
cheapest possible bid, 1 Spade.
You only have 3 spades, but your
partner doubled 1 Heart, so he
probably has 4 cards in the other

major, Spades. It's bettor to lio
a little about your distribution,
when you have sueh a weak hand.
Though you have 14 high card
points in the fourth hand, you
should pass. If you pass the op
ponents will probably get into
trouble, but if you bid it will be
the oiher way around. If you
double, your partner will prob
ably respond. 2 Hearts. If this is
doubled, you'll probably find

partner doubled 1 Heart, so he
probably has 4 cards in the other

major, Spades. It's bettor to lio
a little about your distribution,
when you have sueh a weak hand.
Though you have 14 high card
points in the fourth hand, you
should pass. If you pass the op
ponents will probably get into
trouble, but if you bid it will be
the oiher way around. If you
double, your partner will prob
ably respond. 2 Hearts. If this is
doubled, you'll probably find
yourself playing 2 No Trump
doubled, down 2 or 3, when the
opponents probably can't make a
game.
Dave Bernstein, a graduate I
physics student, was the winner
of the bridge contest which ran
in last Tuesday's Daily. Dave !
made the 4 bids correctly, and his j
play of the problem hand was j
flawless. The first prize, a bridge i
book of his choice, can be picked j
up at the Peninsula Book Store, j
Tied for second with one bid
ding error were Eben Carlson,
Jack Ewing and Alan Bell. Each
will receive one free play at the
Cardinal Bridge Club.
Next week's column will con
lain the solution to the contest's
double dummy hand. The bidding j
sequences are repeated for your
convenience.
The bidding:
South West North East
1 N.T. Pass 4 N.T. Pass
o
Your hand:
*AQ4 VAG42 ♦QIC 5 *KJ3
The bidding:
West North East South
1 A Double Pass ?

Your hand:
A AQ7S VKJ32 ♦ AT 1 *95
The bidding:
West North East South
1 V Double Pass ?
Your hand:
*10 64 VJIO 75 4 954 *132
The bidding:
Kast South
1 * ?
Your hand:
* KJ.XG V 7 ♦ AQ92 *KJ73
Here are the solutions: the cor
rect bid in the first hand is Pass.
Your partner's bid of 4 No
Trump is not a Blackwood Con
vention Bid to ask for the number'
of aces you hold. Your partner
has 15 or 1(5 points, and he's ask
ing you to pass if you have a
minimum 1 No Trump bid (i.e.,
1(5 points) and bid (> No Trump if
you have a maximum (i.e., 18
points).
Only two people made the cor
rect bid of 2 Clubs on the second
hand. This is, admittedly, an ex
port bid. Two Clubs forces your

| partner to game, and asks him to
! choose between one of tlie other
| suits.
If partner bids 2 Diamonds you
intend to bid 3 Clubs asking him
to choose a major suit. If (this is
very unlikely* he doosnt' have a
I card major suit, but he does
have a club stopper, he should bid
3 No Trump over 3 Clubs.
It's true that a cue bid in the
opponents' suit usually guaran
tees first round control (the ace
or a void) besides forcing partner
to game, but in this hand you
must distort your distribution a
little to insure reaching game.
Two Hearts or 2 Spades are not
considered absolute forces in this
bidding sequence, and you can't
bid 2 No Trump without a club
stopper.
The third hand illustrates the
situation on which most begin
ning bridge players go wrong.
When your partner doubles, and
you have a weak hand, it is im
perative that you bid. You can't
pass the double with less than 3
trump tricks. And you shouldn't
bid 1 No Trump with less than 7
points including a stopper in the
opponents' suit.
Since your only 4 card suit is
Hearts, you should make the
cheapest possible bid, 1 Spade.
You only have 3 spades, but your
partner doubled 1 Heart, so he
probably has 4 cards in the other

major, Spades. It's bettor to lio
a little about your distribution,
when you have sueh a weak hand.
Though you have 14 high card
points in the fourth hand, you
should pass. If you pass the op
ponents will probably get into
trouble, but if you bid it will be
the oiher way around. If you
double, your partner will prob
ably respond. 2 Hearts. If this is
doubled, you'll probably find
yourself playing 2 No Trump
doubled, down 2 or 3, when the
opponents probably can't make a
game.
