# Point-Happy Idaho Looks For 2nd Win Over Tribe
## 
### 
Friday night will bring the
rather fading but still exciting
University of Idaho Vandals to
Stanford to take on the Indian
cagers. Earlier this season when
the Vandals were right in the
middle of the PCC title race, they
defeated the Indians by a 67-59
I score.
Idaho has been right at the top
of the PCC in offense all year.
They're a strong scoring squad
that never fails to give its oppo
nents a good scrap.
The number one man on the
Vandals' squad is captain Gary
Simmons. Simmons, who tossed

in 21 points in the previous Idaho-
Stanford tilt, is currently the
PCC's number one scoring ace.
He is the backbone of the Idaho
squad and has scored as many as
3S points in one game this year.
7-6 in PCC
The Vandals now hold a 7-6
won-lost record in the league but
up until the loss of one of their
ace guards, Hal Damiano, due to
a leg injury, Idaho was up with
the leaders.
Last weekend Idaho came back
after losing to Cal on Friday
night to whip the Washington
Huskies 85-63 the following eve

ning. Captain Simmons throw in
30 points in the Saturday night
game and Waylan Coleman, who
has boon playing excellent ball
| lately, had 20.
When the Vandals move into j
j the Stanford Pavilion they should I
have a starting five consisting of j
Simmons, Coleman, Gary McEw
en, John Liveious and Jim Brown. |
New Tribe Style
11 will be interesting to see
Stanford's newly revamped de
fensive style in action against the
top scoring team in the confer
ence. Idaho also has acquired
some new defensive techniques
j <>112 late. Starting with last Satur
day's game the Vandals have de
! cided to use the full court press
throughout the major portion of
the game.
Along with their smooth offen
sive style and full court press,
j Idaho also relies on a lot of speed.
They work an excellent fasti
breaking attack and have the fine
[shooting of Gary Simmons to j
j balance their attack.
