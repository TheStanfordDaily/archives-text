"The Time of the Panther" is a
warm, moving story by Wesley
Ford Davis, now at Stanford -of
the summer in which orphaned
14-year-old Tom Jarrad, "almost
15," becomes aware that he can
no longer think of himself as a
boy, but is not sure he knows just
how to think of himself as a man.
And the circumstances of his
life would never lead him to be
lieve that such problems are un
common; he is continually con
fronted with situations about
which he is not sure how to feel.
Soul Awareness
Vividly aware of his senses and
his maturing body, Tom lives with
his Aunt Sallie, who would have
the boy know his soul. Their live
lihood is dependent on the lumber

camp that had killed his father
and mangled others.
The narrative plays the heroic
against the pedestrian, and the
resulting symbolism has the hon
esty and credibility of their fu
sion. Tom owns a three-legged
lamo bobcat, but his mind turns
on ihe image of a panther he saw
by the river. He spends the week
days picking bag after bag of
peas, and the week ends searching
the Florida backwoods for the al
most extinct ivory-billed wood
pecker.
Promotes Search
Miss St. Clair, his comely
schoolteacher who promotes his
search for the ivory -billed and
gives him a copy of Keats' poems,
leaves to be married in Atlanta,
and Tom lies with Amie Lou, the
"sister" of the evangelist Brother
Mims, who saved a soul or two be
fore he was caught in embarrass
ing circumstances with his sister
and was run out of town.
The reality of his dreams and
the unreality of his existence
make Tom wonder whether he
sleeps or wakes.
At the end of the book Davis
writes: "Of what could he be
sure? He had possessed Amie Lou
and rejected her. He had betrayed
Aunt Sallie and remained faithful
to her. Crazy, impossible fact."
It is to Davis' credit that the
reader, like Tom, is barely con
scious of the paradox of an "im
possible fact." The fact is the
boy's life, and Davis brings the
reader in intimate contact with
Tom's ever - deepening, ever - ex
panding awareness of its com
plexity and the resulting awe that
makes that fact "impossible."
Not Without Flame
"The Time of the Panther" is
not without flaws, but it is char
acterized by its accomplishments.
The language is rich but unpre
tentious, capable of realizing viv
idly the immediate experience and
of carrying the epic themes intro
duced in the first chapter. At its
best it is one with Tom's sensi
bility:
"The pale sky had cooled and
dulled, easy on the eyes, and from
out in the palmettos a cock quail
whistled loud and sharp, three
notes — two shorts and a long.
Ga/.ing into the far sky, Tom's
anger gave way to a vague sad
ness. He wanted to weep for some
thing, some elusive thing, lost,
just missed, or slipped from him.
He could not be sure. Maybe lie
was too old to cry at all."
Something 1 of Self
When the reader sees some
thing of Huck Finn, of Tom Saw
yer, of Eugene Gant in Tom Jar
rad, he recognizes Davis' ambi
tion; and when he sees something
of himself, he recognizes Davis'
talent and his knowledge.
Wesley Ford Davis is a member
of the English faculty at the Uni
versity of Arkansas; he is now at
Stanford on a Danforth fellow
s hi p, working on a doctorate.
"The Time of the Panther" is his
first novel, and it has placed him
in that small group of contcmpo

rary writers whose work demands
recognition.
Jessamyn West has said: "I
think he [Davis] has strength and
freshness rare in writing today.
In 'The Time of the Panther* he
lias made a real world and a real
boy—three of them, in fact and
the reading gives what the good
novel should, an extension of con
sciousness. The reader has more
life because of having participated
in this life. That's real creativity,
and I think Davis has it."
