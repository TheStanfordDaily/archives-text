# Cordry to Undergo Mental Test in Slaying
## Mental Hospital Possible For Soph, Says Ass't DA 
### Barbara Hicks 
A weird story of murder may send Thomas Wallace Cordry 111 to
a mental institution instead of to court.
Deputy District Attorney Louis Doll indicated a team of psychia
trists will interview Cordry with the probability that Cordry's "in
credible story" may send him to a state mental institution.

Doll said Cordry's "reason for
the killing is more incredible than
giving no reason at all."
Cordry, 19, a sophomore inter
national relations major, of 246
Edlee St., is being hold by the
Santa Clara County sheriff's of
fice on suspicion of murder.
The victim was Deena Bonn, IT,
a Cubberley High School student
who lived across the street from
Cordry.
District Attorney Louis Bergna
is expected to file formal murder
charges against Cordry today.
"Urge to Kill''
An "urge to kill" apparently
obsessed Cordry, who walked
calmly into the Palo Alto police
station Tuesday night to tell nffi
•ers: "I want to report a killing.
I killed a girl, and she's out in the
car in front."
In San Jose yesterday he said
he had fell urges to-kill frequently
in the last year. "1 was able to
resist them all until this time,"
lie said.
"I can't explain it," said Cordry
•>f the shooting. "I made a mis
take. I'm ready to face it. I'll
never make it again. I guess it's
really a sex problem."
Retain Attorney
Cordry's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Wallace Cordry Jr., have
retained Alan A. Lindsay, Oak
land, to defend their son. Lindsay
is former assistant chief counsel
for the California Crime Commis
sion.
The attorney said Cordry will
probably be arraigned in Palo
Alto on Monday.
An autopsy yesterday confirmed
beliefs that Miss Bonn's death was
caused by a ,22-calibre rifle bullet
in the right side of her head. She
was killed instantly.
Cordry told police he had plan
ned to rape her. but abandoned
the idea after the killing. His story
was borne out by the autopsy
report, which stated the girl had
not been sexually molested.
Buys Rifle
According to Captain William
Salt, Cordry told officers he pur
chased a .22 rifle and ammunition
Tuesday afternoon for the pur
pose of picking up a girl, killing
her. raping her and leaving her
body in the hills—in that order.
Cordry's parents, after seeing
their son in San Jose yesterday,
said they would stand by their -son
and "try to find out where the
truth lies."
Mrs. Cordry told reporters that
the boy had been a shy and nor
mal youth who had been taught
to take good care of girls—"an
old-fashioned type of education on
sex."
Too Rigid
"Probably we were much too
rigid in the sex morality we in
stilled in the boy," Mrs. Cordry
remarked.
Cordry's friends at Stanford
termed him a normal, friendly stu
dent.
"I can't for the life of me find
anything in his background which
would explain why he'd do some
thing like this," dean of men Wil
liam Craig said yesterday.
Miss Bonn's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. John Bonn, were standing
outside th c i r home concerned
about their daughter's lateness.

when police sergeant Otto Nie
h'eus arrived to tell them of her
death.
Mrs. Bonn was first told that
her daughter was in an auto acci
dent. but was later given the true
story. The parents were given
sedatives and placed under a doc
tor's care.
Bonn opera les employment
agencies in Palo Alto and Sunny
vale. He said he is acquainted
with Cordry and thought he was
a "nice, clean-cut boy, very po
lite."
Cordry had dated Miss Bonn
only once; they were considered
neighborhood acquaintances.
Mr. atid Mrs. Cordry were both
graduated from Stanford in 1933.
The elder Cordry was captain of
the basketball team and president
of his class during his senior year.
He retains the position of presi
dent of the Class of '33 alumni.
An insurance executive, his office
is in San Francisco.
