# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## A 						Good Idea 
### Walter Lippmann 
The President's latest Idler 1o Bulganin, which
was published this week, suggests what may be
a way around a growing difficulty. This govern
ment is being forced by the pressure of world
opinion toward a summit meeting, though there
is no genuine prospect of a serious negotiation
on any of the substantive issues.
Hitherto the Western position has lieen that we
would he glad to go to the summit provided the
foreign ministers, or the ambassadors acting
under orders of th«* foreign ministers, could work *
out agreements which could then he ratified at
tin* summit. The Soviet position, on the other
hand, has been that, while nothing dould be nego
tiated (til the real issues, something might be done
about the control of armaments provided there
was a meeting at the summit first, where an
agreement, would be readied to instruct the for
eign ministers to do something.
The basic difference between the two sides is
that the Soviets want to go to the summit for its
psychological effect, but not to settle great issues;
we, on the other hand, do not want to go to the
summit unless and until we can settle some great
issue.
#
In one part of his letter the President lias
addressed himself to this difference and lias pro
posed that the U.S.S.K. and the U.S.A.. organize
an exchange of visits by "citizens who exert an
influence." This is not quite the same thing as a
meeting' at the summit. But it does propose meet
ings, not too hurried and not too blown up with
publicity, by men from both sides who are at or
very near to the summit.

There is some reason for thinking that the
Russians themselves may be seeing the need to
establish more personal contact among men at
the top of affairs. There are signs that, combined
with the determination not to negotiate on the
real issues, and along with their obvious interest
to make propaganda, there is also a real desin
to emerge from their isolation and to know more
of the world outside. It would not surprise me
to hear that what tbe President had to say on
this point may be his response to intimations lie
has had from Moscow.
«• • a * ' »
In any event, it is a good idea. For there has
been considerable danger that we might be paint
ing ourselves into a corner. Having made so
much of the argument that we cannot go to the
summit unless there was adequate and successful
preparation, it had begun to look as if we might
nevertheless go to the summit without adequate
and successful preparation. This would be very
dangerous in that tlie world would assume that
if President Eisenhower went to the summit it
was because Secretary Dulles had decided that
the meeting would be successful. Thus, if it was
not successful, the whole blame would fall on
this country.
The new Eisenhower suggestion could be used
to avoid this dilemma and to say that, before we,
put on a big show at the summit, let us work up
to it with meetings of men who would in the end
be involved—as negotiators, as advisers, as poli
ticians—in what would happen at the •summit.

In one part of his letter the President lias
addressed himself to this difference and lias pro
posed that the U.S.S.K. and the U.S.A.. organize
an exchange of visits by "citizens who exert an
influence." This is not quite the same thing as a
meeting' at the summit. But it does propose meet
ings, not too hurried and not too blown up with
publicity, by men from both sides who are at or
very near to the summit.

There is some reason for thinking that the
Russians themselves may be seeing the need to
establish more personal contact among men at
the top of affairs. There are signs that, combined
with the determination not to negotiate on the
real issues, and along with their obvious interest
to make propaganda, there is also a real desin
to emerge from their isolation and to know more
of the world outside. It would not surprise me
to hear that what tbe President had to say on
this point may be his response to intimations lie
has had from Moscow.

In any event, it is a good idea. For there has
been considerable danger that we might be paint
ing ourselves into a corner. Having made so
much of the argument that we cannot go to the
summit unless there was adequate and successful
preparation, it had begun to look as if we might
nevertheless go to the summit without adequate
and successful preparation. This would be very
dangerous in that tlie world would assume that
if President Eisenhower went to the summit it
was because Secretary Dulles had decided that
the meeting would be successful. Thus, if it was
not successful, the whole blame would fall on
this country.
The new Eisenhower suggestion could be used
to avoid this dilemma and to say that, before we,
put on a big show at the summit, let us work up
to it with meetings of men who would in the end
be involved—as negotiators, as advisers, as poli
ticians—in what would happen at the •summit.

The President's latest Idler 1o Bulganin, which
was published this week, suggests what may be
a way around a growing difficulty. This govern
ment is being forced by the pressure of world
opinion toward a summit meeting, though there
is no genuine prospect of a serious negotiation
on any of the substantive issues.
Hitherto the Western position has lieen that we
would he glad to go to the summit provided the
foreign ministers, or the ambassadors acting
under orders of th«* foreign ministers, could work *
out agreements which could then he ratified at
tin* summit. The Soviet position, on the other
hand, has been that, while nothing dould be nego
tiated (til the real issues, something might be done
about the control of armaments provided there
was a meeting at the summit first, where an
agreement, would be readied to instruct the for
eign ministers to do something.
The basic difference between the two sides is
that the Soviets want to go to the summit for its
psychological effect, but not to settle great issues;
we, on the other hand, do not want to go to the
summit unless and until we can settle some great
issue.
