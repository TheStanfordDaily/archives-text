Highest Moral Integrity
Editor, The Daily:
I hate to dig up an old issue; but, in spile of
abortion, murder and rape, I still agree with Dean
Winbigler when he says every Stanford student
is of the highest moral integrity.

'When Men Refuse to Fight 9
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily should be commended for interview
ing Linux Pauling and for its careful report of
the interview. Dr. Pauling is a courageous and
unorthodox thinker in a day when political cour
age and basic dissent seerr\ to be very unfashion
able. Quite often the newspapers do not even
report serious challenges to prevalent opinions.
1 join Dr. Pauling in calling for conscientious
objection. There can neves be too much. And it
should be conscientious objection not only to mili
tary service but also to Ihe designing and manu
facture of weapons. In our own day, war is al
ways impractical and can never be moral. Young
and old must say "no" to it, not only in words but
in deeds as well.
Women and girls, as well as men, can play
important roles in protesting our collective mad
ness. Essentially they should be Lysistrates en
couraging the men who become conscientious
objectors and discouraging those who do not.
While the issue of war is, of course, not a
simple one, in the last analysis wars will cease
when men refuse to light.

Stanford Draws the Line
Editor, The Daily:
Yes, the latest word from ihe Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Commission does in
deed clarify the meaning of the Honor Code. Stu
dents should now have a pretty clear understand
ing of just where the code does and does not:
apply. For instance. I quote from The Daily's
article of last Thursday:
"The faculty should . . . accept ihe word of stu
dents regarding absence excuses for class sessions
and tests. However, students desiring to be ex
cused from a final examination for reasons of
health may be required to present a statement
from the Health Service"
Now we know. As the commission's little post
ers around campus put it, the Honor Code is "an
expression of mutual confidence between faculty
and students" up to a point. Stanford University
places complete confidence in the Honor Code of
its students— until that honor is confronted with
a really significant temptation. Then Stanford
faces reality and draws the line at the temptation
to postpone taking a final exam on a false plea
of illness.
This situation seems to me typical of the gen
eral ambivalence toward a true honor code. The
true honor code is appealing, but would be un
workable; but our combination of an "Honor
Code" with supervision and the threat of punish
ment is hypocrisy.

H hat Is a Daily Photograph?
Editor, The Daily:
Commenting on Mr. Simpson's recent photo
graph of the Stanford baseball team in action at
home plate (could make out the catcher), we
would like to dedicate t !v following "Lucky Strike
Stickler" to the above-mentioned "photographer":

What Is a (hadaate St ml e nt?
Editor, The Daily:
Recent articles in The Daily have shattered the

Stanford undergraduate. First we learned he is
apathet'ic; then we learned the reason why the
University's method of teaching. The final install
ment was the solution—teach the individual.
The reader will note that not one of the articles
mentioned that superior form of animal called
"the graduate student," or that college of kings
called "the graduate school." The great white god
peers down from his.ivory tower at the mass of
undergraduates and speaks like the oracle of
Apollo at Delphi, of their many weaknesses. Be
fore you excrete such profound knowledge, old
grad, look at yourself—you, the egghead with the
scrambled brains.
What is a graduate student? A mass of bun
gled nerves, wearing an off-colored sport coat and
screeching in the dark, like a Gitchee bird, about
himself and his,major, . ;| ,
W,hat is a gitidua;t ! e school?!* A-cftmpotindod ex
tension of the mistakes made in undergraduate
school taught to a group of;students that have
had these mistakes repeated Jo them so often they
no longer consider, them mistakes.
Solution to the' problem:' flqr' the' graduate stu
dent to take.a good locik af himself before he
starts serving. his superior brand of warmed-over
corned-beef hash to others.

Criticizing Law Facility?
Editor, The Daily:
I wonder where Gorman finds the facts upon
which he predicates his very vague criticism of
the Stanford faculty. It seems unlikely that he
has any firsthand knowledge of the subject. As
I understand it, he is a first-year law student and
doesn't attend undergraduate classes. Is he criti
cizing the law school faculty?

Leave Us Alone
Editor, The Daily:
The controversy over this apathy bit seems to
be getting out of hand. Criticism has been ex
pressed of student apathy toward almost every
phase of out student life here -except those parts
with which we are most personally and often in
volved. Let's be more realistic. I contend that
Stanfordites are not apathetic in general, but
often are in particular.
The things that matter most to the students
I know are promoting individual goals and ideals.
(This, of course, does not imply complete selfish
ness, since individual goals and ideals are no
toriously selfless among college students.) Most
of us strive for good grades, but temper the strife
with occasional beer busts, dates, etc. A good
share of the people here devote a good share of
their time and energy to sports and physical
development.
We also discuss French atrocities in Tunisia,
psychological drives to murder, and whether any
one we know would have ihe courage to report
an Honor Code violation. These latter topics are
the type of thing concerning which the apathy
laments are voiced. They use up an amount of
emotional and mental energy corresponding to
their relative importance in our lives. This
amount of energy varies with the individual. The
general consensus of opinion seems to be that the
vast majority of us contribute very little lime
anrl active thought to these important subjects.
The question is—does this mean thai we are
cowards, dullards and anti-intellectuals? On the
contrary, it merely leads one to think that our
energies are being channeled into more immedi
ate areas. It seems that if we ignored all Ihe
realities of day-to-day life as we live it, there
might be even more reason for alarm.
Just leave us alone to plug along in..wr Q\vn
restricted little world (in which we happen to five
l ight now i, and pretty soon we will arrive fit th<
big outdoors.
