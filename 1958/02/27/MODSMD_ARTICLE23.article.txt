# 'LAUGHTER'
## Noel Coward Play Provides 'A Good Time' 
### Camilla Peterson 
"Present Laughter," starring
its author, Noel' voWard; provides
three hours of ;just that- present
laughter. The play itself 'is not
one that will be remembered in a '
year, but Coward and co-star Eva
Gabor are well-supported, and,the'
result is a good time for audtofrtce
and actors.
All action takes place in the
London studio of actor Garry Es
sendine (Coward) who has Jack)
Benny's age obsession, as well as
a roving eye. The always acting
t fait of this enjoyable character
is portrayed to the proverbial hilt
but with good taste.
Behind Essendine there exists
a corporation which handles the
business end of Wis career. Chief
among these are his long - en
gaged secretary Monica .Reed
(Mona VVashbourne) and his sep- j
arated wife Liz (Joyce Carey).
Both women add spice to the!
already witty lines, and they
work well together in the scenes
where they combine efforts
against Essendine.
Miss Gabor provides the sultry]
ingredients to the comedy as the)
wife of Henry Lypiatt, fourth:
member of the long-standing Es- j
sendine Corporation.
Though not being able to open-1
ly break through into'the closely
knit circle, Mrs. Lyppiatt has a !
long standing affair with the fifth
member of the group, Morris
Dixon (John Ainsworth) and lat- j
or with Essendine.
Minor character roles are done j
outstanding by Avril Gentles, i
Wi 11 ia m Tray lor and Robert 1
Thurston.
Miss Gentles portrays a Swed
ish housekeeper who practices
spiritualism and reminds one of
a zombie as she shuffles around !
the stage.
In the role of Rolan Maulc, |
Traylor becomes the country J
bumpkin, would -be playwright
who will not leave Essendine 1
alone. Besides delivering his lines I
well, he also has mastered the :
gestures of the character.
