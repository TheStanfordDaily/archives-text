# SRI Annual Report Tells Of Facilities, Largest Year
## 
### 
Now facilities and the largest volume of research in its history
characterized 1957 at Stanford Research Institute, according to the
research organization's Report of Operations released last week.
During Ihe year, ihe Institute undertook contract research amount
ing to $1-1.8 million. Approximately half of this was for business,

industry, foundations and indi
viduals; the other half was for
agencies of the government, pri
marily the Department of De
fense.
At year's end, SRI was begin
ning its/2400th research project,
having worked on 712 different
projects during the preceding
year.
The Institute is now construct
ing a $2.5 million building at its
Menlo Park headquarters. Twij
new offices in New York City and
Zurich, Switzerland, were opened
last year.
Commenting on the year's op
erations, E. Finley Carter, direc
tor of SRI, stated, "One underly
ing development at: SRI during
1957 was greater concentration
on decision-making research—for
industry in research planning,
for business in market develop
ment, for defense agencies in
weapons evaluation, and for in
ternational organizations on eco
nomic development and human
understanding.
New Facilities
Significant new facilities noted
in the report include a solar fur
nace capable of attaining temper
atures of 6000 degrees Fahren
heit and new equipment for the
metallurgy department which
makes SRl's the largest metallur
gical research laboratory in the
Western States.
By means of the Institute's 61-
foot parabolic antenna, SRI engi
neers made the first known West
ern Hemisphere radar contact
with Ihe Soviet earth satellite
Sputnik I. The huge antenna is
normally employed in the study
of upper atmosphere clutter, and
can obtain radio echoes from the
moon.
World Significance
An event of world-wide signifi
cance— the International Indus
trial Development Conference
was sponsored jointly by SRI and
Time-Life International in San
Francisco in October.
Over 550 business and govern
ment leaders from 02 countries
participated in the conference.
Finally, the report draws atten
tion to the Institute's public-serv
ice proposal for the establishment
of a National Technical Informa
tion Center which would under
take ihe effective collection,
translation and dissemination of
world scientific and technical lit
erature.

research organization's Report of Operations released last week.
During Ihe year, ihe Institute undertook contract research amount
ing to $1-1.8 million. Approximately half of this was for business,

industry, foundations and indi
viduals; the other half was for
agencies of the government, pri
marily the Department of De
fense.
At year's end, SRI was begin
ning its/2400th research project,
having worked on 712 different
projects during the preceding
year.
The Institute is now construct
ing a $2.5 million building at its
Menlo Park headquarters. Twij
new offices in New York City and
Zurich, Switzerland, were opened
last year.
Commenting on the year's op
erations, E. Finley Carter, direc
tor of SRI, stated, "One underly
ing development at: SRI during
1957 was greater concentration
on decision-making research—for
industry in research planning,
for business in market develop
ment, for defense agencies in
weapons evaluation, and for in
ternational organizations on eco
nomic development and human
understanding.
New Facilities
Significant new facilities noted
in the report include a solar fur
nace capable of attaining temper
atures of 6000 degrees Fahren
heit and new equipment for the
metallurgy department which
makes SRl's the largest metallur
gical research laboratory in the
Western States.
By means of the Institute's 61-
foot parabolic antenna, SRI engi
neers made the first known West
ern Hemisphere radar contact
with Ihe Soviet earth satellite
Sputnik I. The huge antenna is
normally employed in the study
of upper atmosphere clutter, and
can obtain radio echoes from the
moon.
World Significance
An event of world-wide signifi
cance— the International Indus
trial Development Conference
was sponsored jointly by SRI and
Time-Life International in San
Francisco in October.
Over 550 business and govern
ment leaders from 02 countries
participated in the conference.
Finally, the report draws atten
tion to the Institute's public-serv
ice proposal for the establishment
of a National Technical Informa
tion Center which would under
take ihe effective collection,
translation and dissemination of
world scientific and technical lit
erature.
