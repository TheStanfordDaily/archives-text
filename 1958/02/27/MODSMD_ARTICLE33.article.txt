It's hard to think of baseball when the campus is slithering i.n
mud the way it is. but there's no overlooking the fact that over at
the BAG Jalie Irwin has shaken the dust out of the uniforms, taken
the cover off the game bats, unwrapped box after box of new, while
balls and even searched around in the back of the supply room to
find the sacks of lime and the line-marker.
Last Saturday William I*. (Dutch) Fell ring pulled the curtains
back and gave the local fans a look at the 1958 Stanford nine. lie
unveiled a sharp-looking, well-molded squad that, this early in the
season, looks like it will be prudent buyers in the bacon market and
should bring home plenty of it, grade A.
Of course, you don't go around judging a team from its perform
ance in an Alumni game especially one like last Saturday's. Alum
manager Jack Shepard shifted his lineup so often that in no two
innings did the varsity play the same team. But there was method
in what at the time seemed to be madness.
In the early innings of the game the shifts wore destined to
present the fans with an infield that had worked together here on
The Farm back in the 30's. By the sixth inning Shepard had substi
tuted to the point whore the entire Alumni squad was composed of
members of the 1953 championship team which went right up to
the nationals.
Despite the changing opposition, the Card nine played well and
managed to come out of the game without an error. Pitchers George
Avery, Wally Miller and Bob Leopold looked good in their three
inning stints, and if they hold up during the regular season Fehring
will be sighing the big relief. Filling the chucking spots figured to
be one of his early-season problems.
HOW FAR THIS YEAH? Last year's Indian nine finished in
third place in CIBA play with a 7-9 record and came out of ihr total
season.a shade better in the percentage column at '17-13. Naturally,
hopes are high for a better finish this year; team spirit is high,
the quality is there (nine lettermen returned and are complemented

with some other fine material)
and enough hard work may just
bring them a trophy or two.
Thirty-three contests are on the
varsity state this season, with five
games slated on the home dia
mond for the rest of this quarter
- California rainy season permit
ting, of course. This week end the
gang takes on San Jose State on
Friday at 3:15 and Cal Poly Sat
urday at 2:30. Charge for
games is $1 for outsiders, nothing
for students with student bodyj
cards. t |
Over vacation the team will
head south, for anyone interested;
down in that area. They'll be in
the San Diego-Los Angeles area
from the 24th through the 29th
of March. The San Diego Marines
and San Diego State are oppo-J
nents on the 24th and 25111, Camp
Pendleton, in Oceanside, on the
26th, and then UCLA on the 28th,
and 29th.
Talking about home games,]
here on campus you get to see the]

Indians play in what has been called "the most beautiful university
park in America." Often you don't think to appreciate things that
fire so close by. The 2800-spectator field has been around since 1931,
but to see it again after a 9- or 10-month absence usually brings you
around to admiring it again. A trip over to it this week end will
make an enjoyable outing.
Don't Forget the JV's
You get to talking about a varsity team around here and it .seems
all other squads get left to fare for themselves. This year's Jayvee
squad is playing good baseball, too, and should turn in a couple of
nifty performances'at least. They tussle with Santa Rosa JC on
Saturday and play most of their games on the frosh diamond.
Basketball coach Howie Dallmar will take over the reins of the
Braves squad as soon as his hoop chores are through. Howie was a
goori baseball player in his student-days here, but decided to concen
trate on basketball. He'll get his chance to renew his diamond interest
this season.
And, while we're looking over the coaching picture, let's credit
Mil Jhe men handling Stanford baseball squads. Kill Aihouse and iiil!
Turner are also assistant coaches. Mickey Holzman will handle the
frosh when they swing into action come April 3. Rudy Figueroa,
Hog Osenbaugh, Mike Acker and Bob Fletcher are student assistants.
ALUMNI BANQUET The Alumni squad and the varsity team
got together for a meal before last Saturday's game over in the Union.
You'd figure the topic of conversation might have been baseball
well, it was. but film star Brigitte Bardot came in for her share of
time. What an idea for a mascot!
Dutch Fehring tells the following story about assistant director
of athletics Cluick Taylor. Seems Chuck was seated between Casey
Stengel and Leo Durocher at a Los Angeles Times Sports Award
banquet a couple of years ago. Thinking "what a wonderful way
to spend an evening," Dutch mentioned this to Taylor after the affair
was over. "Yes, I knew they had something to do with baseball,"
Chuck told him. "but I forgot what schools they coached at."
GAME NOTE During the Alumni game, Alum first-sackcr -Jim
Walsh was kidding pitcher Roger Osenbaugh about throwing a spit
ball. After failing to grab a foul ball down his line which fell into
wet grass, Walsh turned to the pitcher, quipping, "It's ail wet any
way, Rog." . ■

here on campus you get to see the]

Indians play in what has been called "the most beautiful university
park in America." Often you don't think to appreciate things that
fire so close by. The 2800-spectator field has been around since 1931,
but to see it again after a 9- or 10-month absence usually brings you
around to admiring it again. A trip over to it this week end will
make an enjoyable outing.
Don't Forget the JV's
You get to talking about a varsity team around here and it .seems
all other squads get left to fare for themselves. This year's Jayvee
squad is playing good baseball, too, and should turn in a couple of
nifty performances'at least. They tussle with Santa Rosa JC on
Saturday and play most of their games on the frosh diamond.
Basketball coach Howie Dallmar will take over the reins of the
Braves squad as soon as his hoop chores are through. Howie was a
goori baseball player in his student-days here, but decided to concen
trate on basketball. He'll get his chance to renew his diamond interest
this season.
And, while we're looking over the coaching picture, let's credit
Mil Jhe men handling Stanford baseball squads. Kill Aihouse and iiil!
Turner are also assistant coaches. Mickey Holzman will handle the
frosh when they swing into action come April 3. Rudy Figueroa,
Hog Osenbaugh, Mike Acker and Bob Fletcher are student assistants.
ALUMNI BANQUET The Alumni squad and the varsity team
got together for a meal before last Saturday's game over in the Union.
You'd figure the topic of conversation might have been baseball
well, it was. but film star Brigitte Bardot came in for her share of
time. What an idea for a mascot!
Dutch Fehring tells the following story about assistant director
of athletics Cluick Taylor. Seems Chuck was seated between Casey
Stengel and Leo Durocher at a Los Angeles Times Sports Award
banquet a couple of years ago. Thinking "what a wonderful way
to spend an evening," Dutch mentioned this to Taylor after the affair
was over. "Yes, I knew they had something to do with baseball,"
Chuck told him. "but I forgot what schools they coached at."
GAME NOTE During the Alumni game, Alum first-sackcr -Jim
Walsh was kidding pitcher Roger Osenbaugh about throwing a spit
ball. After failing to grab a foul ball down his line which fell into
wet grass, Walsh turned to the pitcher, quipping, "It's ail wet any

It's hard to think of baseball when the campus is slithering i.n
mud the way it is. but there's no overlooking the fact that over at
the BAG Jalie Irwin has shaken the dust out of the uniforms, taken
the cover off the game bats, unwrapped box after box of new, while
balls and even searched around in the back of the supply room to
find the sacks of lime and the line-marker.
Last Saturday William I*. (Dutch) Fell ring pulled the curtains
back and gave the local fans a look at the 1958 Stanford nine. lie
unveiled a sharp-looking, well-molded squad that, this early in the
season, looks like it will be prudent buyers in the bacon market and
should bring home plenty of it, grade A.
Of course, you don't go around judging a team from its perform
ance in an Alumni game especially one like last Saturday's. Alum
manager Jack Shepard shifted his lineup so often that in no two
innings did the varsity play the same team. But there was method
in what at the time seemed to be madness.
In the early innings of the game the shifts wore destined to
present the fans with an infield that had worked together here on
The Farm back in the 30's. By the sixth inning Shepard had substi
tuted to the point whore the entire Alumni squad was composed of
members of the 1953 championship team which went right up to
the nationals.
Despite the changing opposition, the Card nine played well and
managed to come out of the game without an error. Pitchers George
Avery, Wally Miller and Bob Leopold looked good in their three
inning stints, and if they hold up during the regular season Fehring
will be sighing the big relief. Filling the chucking spots figured to
be one of his early-season problems.
HOW FAR THIS YEAH? Last year's Indian nine finished in
third place in CIBA play with a 7-9 record and came out of ihr total
season.a shade better in the percentage column at '17-13. Naturally,
hopes are high for a better finish this year; team spirit is high,
the quality is there (nine lettermen returned and are complemented

with some other fine material)
and enough hard work may just
bring them a trophy or two.
Thirty-three contests are on the

mud the way it is. but there's no overlooking the fact that over at
the BAG Jalie Irwin has shaken the dust out of the uniforms, taken
the cover off the game bats, unwrapped box after box of new, while
balls and even searched around in the back of the supply room to
find the sacks of lime and the line-marker.
Last Saturday William I*. (Dutch) Fell ring pulled the curtains
back and gave the local fans a look at the 1958 Stanford nine. lie
unveiled a sharp-looking, well-molded squad that, this early in the
season, looks like it will be prudent buyers in the bacon market and
should bring home plenty of it, grade A.
Of course, you don't go around judging a team from its perform
ance in an Alumni game especially one like last Saturday's. Alum
manager Jack Shepard shifted his lineup so often that in no two
innings did the varsity play the same team. But there was method
in what at the time seemed to be madness.
In the early innings of the game the shifts wore destined to
present the fans with an infield that had worked together here on
The Farm back in the 30's. By the sixth inning Shepard had substi
tuted to the point whore the entire Alumni squad was composed of
members of the 1953 championship team which went right up to
the nationals.
Despite the changing opposition, the Card nine played well and
managed to come out of the game without an error. Pitchers George
Avery, Wally Miller and Bob Leopold looked good in their three
inning stints, and if they hold up during the regular season Fehring
will be sighing the big relief. Filling the chucking spots figured to
be one of his early-season problems.
HOW FAR THIS YEAH? Last year's Indian nine finished in
third place in CIBA play with a 7-9 record and came out of ihr total
season.a shade better in the percentage column at '17-13. Naturally,
hopes are high for a better finish this year; team spirit is high,
the quality is there (nine lettermen returned and are complemented

with some other fine material)
and enough hard work may just
bring them a trophy or two.
Thirty-three contests are on the
varsity state this season, with five
games slated on the home dia
mond for the rest of this quarter
- California rainy season permit
ting, of course. This week end the
gang takes on San Jose State on
Friday at 3:15 and Cal Poly Sat
urday at 2:30. Charge for
games is $1 for outsiders, nothing
for students with student bodyj
cards. t |
Over vacation the team will
head south, for anyone interested;
down in that area. They'll be in
the San Diego-Los Angeles area
from the 24th through the 29th
of March. The San Diego Marines
and San Diego State are oppo-J
nents on the 24th and 25111, Camp
Pendleton, in Oceanside, on the
26th, and then UCLA on the 28th,
and 29th.
Talking about home games,]
here on campus you get to see the]

Indians play in what has been called "the most beautiful university
park in America." Often you don't think to appreciate things that
fire so close by. The 2800-spectator field has been around since 1931,
but to see it again after a 9- or 10-month absence usually brings you
around to admiring it again. A trip over to it this week end will
make an enjoyable outing.
Don't Forget the JV's
You get to talking about a varsity team around here and it .seems
all other squads get left to fare for themselves. This year's Jayvee
squad is playing good baseball, too, and should turn in a couple of
nifty performances'at least. They tussle with Santa Rosa JC on
Saturday and play most of their games on the frosh diamond.
Basketball coach Howie Dallmar will take over the reins of the
Braves squad as soon as his hoop chores are through. Howie was a
goori baseball player in his student-days here, but decided to concen
trate on basketball. He'll get his chance to renew his diamond interest
this season.
And, while we're looking over the coaching picture, let's credit
Mil Jhe men handling Stanford baseball squads. Kill Aihouse and iiil!
Turner are also assistant coaches. Mickey Holzman will handle the
frosh when they swing into action come April 3. Rudy Figueroa,
Hog Osenbaugh, Mike Acker and Bob Fletcher are student assistants.
ALUMNI BANQUET The Alumni squad and the varsity team
got together for a meal before last Saturday's game over in the Union.
You'd figure the topic of conversation might have been baseball
well, it was. but film star Brigitte Bardot came in for her share of
time. What an idea for a mascot!
Dutch Fehring tells the following story about assistant director
of athletics Cluick Taylor. Seems Chuck was seated between Casey
Stengel and Leo Durocher at a Los Angeles Times Sports Award
banquet a couple of years ago. Thinking "what a wonderful way
to spend an evening," Dutch mentioned this to Taylor after the affair
was over. "Yes, I knew they had something to do with baseball,"
Chuck told him. "but I forgot what schools they coached at."
GAME NOTE During the Alumni game, Alum first-sackcr -Jim
Walsh was kidding pitcher Roger Osenbaugh about throwing a spit
ball. After failing to grab a foul ball down his line which fell into
wet grass, Walsh turned to the pitcher, quipping, "It's ail wet any
way, Rog." . ■

Talking about home games,]
here on campus you get to see the]

Indians play in what has been called "the most beautiful university
park in America." Often you don't think to appreciate things that
fire so close by. The 2800-spectator field has been around since 1931,
but to see it again after a 9- or 10-month absence usually brings you
around to admiring it again. A trip over to it this week end will
make an enjoyable outing.
Don't Forget the JV's
You get to talking about a varsity team around here and it .seems
all other squads get left to fare for themselves. This year's Jayvee
squad is playing good baseball, too, and should turn in a couple of
nifty performances'at least. They tussle with Santa Rosa JC on
Saturday and play most of their games on the frosh diamond.
Basketball coach Howie Dallmar will take over the reins of the
Braves squad as soon as his hoop chores are through. Howie was a
goori baseball player in his student-days here, but decided to concen
trate on basketball. He'll get his chance to renew his diamond interest
this season.
And, while we're looking over the coaching picture, let's credit
Mil Jhe men handling Stanford baseball squads. Kill Aihouse and iiil!
Turner are also assistant coaches. Mickey Holzman will handle the
frosh when they swing into action come April 3. Rudy Figueroa,
Hog Osenbaugh, Mike Acker and Bob Fletcher are student assistants.
ALUMNI BANQUET The Alumni squad and the varsity team
got together for a meal before last Saturday's game over in the Union.
You'd figure the topic of conversation might have been baseball
well, it was. but film star Brigitte Bardot came in for her share of
time. What an idea for a mascot!
Dutch Fehring tells the following story about assistant director
of athletics Cluick Taylor. Seems Chuck was seated between Casey
Stengel and Leo Durocher at a Los Angeles Times Sports Award
banquet a couple of years ago. Thinking "what a wonderful way
to spend an evening," Dutch mentioned this to Taylor after the affair
was over. "Yes, I knew they had something to do with baseball,"
Chuck told him. "but I forgot what schools they coached at."
GAME NOTE During the Alumni game, Alum first-sackcr -Jim
Walsh was kidding pitcher Roger Osenbaugh about throwing a spit
ball. After failing to grab a foul ball down his line which fell into
wet grass, Walsh turned to the pitcher, quipping, "It's ail wet any
way, Rog." . ■
CACTUS AGAIN Am wondering just how big a raise in salary
a local disc jockey named "Cactus Jack" got when the University
decided to bring another personality of similar nickname from Utah
as head football coach.
