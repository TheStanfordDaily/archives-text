# BRUINS BOARD TERRORS
## Tribe Shots Must Count 
### 
"We'll have to shoot a much i
higher percentage than they will, 1
if we expect io win. Wfy? won't get i
as many shots as they will."
That's one idea that head bas
ketball coach Howie Dallmar has
about his team's meeting with 1
UCLA Saturday night in the Pa
vilion.
"Down south our boys did well
despite losing. It was a tight
game and every point counted. We
made two 3-point mistakes thai
we wish we hadn't." Dallmar was
referring to the low-scoring 4(5-43
victory eked out over the Curds
in Long Beach last Friday.
Johnny Wooden's Uclans were
terrors on the backboards against
the locals, outgrabbing them 33-19.
Everyone on the Bruin squad
seemed to have a good night
against Stanford.
Starting guard Walt Torrence
and substitute forward Roland
Underhill led the Bruins with
seven grabs apiece. Center Ben-
Rogers and forward Jim Halsten
were next with five. Card center
Dick Haga led both squads with
nine, but the closest Indian to him
was Doug Warren with two.
Wooden will make a change in
his starting lineup when he and
the Bruins come to town: 6-3, 200-1

pound guard Rafer Johnson will |
open iti place of Denny Crurn.
Torrence will be at the other
guard post; Rogers is the center;
Connie Burke and ITnlsten are the)
forwards.
Johnson figures to give tin*
southlanders added speed and re- (
bounding ability. Torrence, a 0-3 1
junior, leads the team in scoring 1
with 292 points and a 12.7 average I

and is second in free throws. Dall
mar describes him "like a cat, de
ceptive, and a good shooter."
