# Sequoia to Show Photo Exhibits
## 
### 
The work of student photogra
pher Don Moser will be on dis
play along the steps of the Main
Library throughout next week.
The exhibit is being sponsored by
Sequoia, the student literary
magazine.
Sequoia, whose winter issue
will include an eight-page photog
raphy section, has solicited work
from students to promote recog
nition of the serious photography
being done on campus.
The present exhibit was plan
ned because so much excellent
work was submitted. Sequoia
decided that the work should be
brought to the attention of the
student body since it could not all
be presented in the winter issue.
