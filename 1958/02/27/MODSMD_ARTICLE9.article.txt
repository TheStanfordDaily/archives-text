### Joan Woods Associate Editor 
The flag flew at half-mast at
Cubberley High School yesterday
to mourn the death of Deena
Bonn, pretty 17-year-old student
body leader.
The hid I ways were quieter than
usual in the betw e en - period
breaks. Here and there small
groups clustered together and dis
cussed the murder in whispers.
One girl ran along the corridor
with tears streaming down her
cheeks.- Many others wept to learn
of the death of the popular teen
ager.
"A lot of kids broke down and
cried," said Katherine Buss, a 14-
year-old sophomore and daughter
of Dr. Robert R. Buss, a lecturer

here in the electrical engineering
department.
Miss Buss described the
"change" that came over the stu
dent body yesterday. "Everyone
was subdued," she said; "it was
so quiet."
Most of the students did hot
know of the impulse slaying until
they arrived at school, where the
lurid story "spread like wildfire."
By the time the first period start
ed at 8 a.m., everyone knew about
the tragedy, students said.
At day's end Ihe murder was
still the principal topic of conver
sation. One girl going home in a
school bus was quoted as saying.
"I'm not going to date any more
boys."
Meanwhile, on Edlee avenue, a
quiet street behind Rickey's Stu
dio Inn, Children played as usual,
unaware of the drama being lived
behind closed blinds in the dead
■ girl's unpretentious home at 257
Edlee Ave.
The street was deserted except
for photographers and reporters,
who wandered around and took a
few pictures of the silent Bonn
house and the boy's home across
the street at 246 Edlee. Carloads
of newspapermen patrolled the
area, hoping the boy's parents,
Mr. ajid Mrs. Thcmas W. Cordry
Jr., would return to their home.
The victim's pet dog could be
heard barking behind the closed

garage door*, and her father, a
gray-haired, bespectacled employ
ment firm owner, came to the
door and said: "No interview . . .
you understand . . . no interview.
I know you have a job to do,
but . .
Occasionally a car would ap
proach and slow down while curi
ous sightseers peered at the two

houses, pointed, or shook their
heads.
Three friends of the victim sat
in a car in front of the Bonn home.
They had come to present their
sympathies to the girl's mother,
who was still under a doctor's
care after collapsing in hysterical
tears Tuesday night when told
that her only child had been mur
dered.
Lessel Hans, 17-year-old senior,
described Deena as a "terrific"
girl. "There was nothing wrong
with her. I don't know a person
who didn't like her.
"She was a normal, average
girl."
I'opidar Girl
Everyone was unanimous in de
scribing Miss Bonn as attractive
popular, a good student. She had
an A average and had applied foi
admission lo Mount I-lolyoke, Vas
sar and Stanford.
Cubher'y High School dean of
women Lucile Ilofstra described
her as being of average height,
slender build, with blonde hair
and blue eyes. At the time of her
death she was wearing a gray suit
and loafers.
"She was the kind of girl you
would want for a daughter . . .
well liked both by faculty and
students," said Miss Hofstra.
"She was a very, very fine girl
... an outstanding girl. I just
couldn't say enough good things
about her."
According to Miss Hofstra,
Deena had not made any definite
vocational plans. "She said she
wanted to make up her mind
while she was attending college."
The girl was active in school
affairs, serving as secretary of
the student body. She was a mem
ber 'of the student board, which
awards honors for school service,
and had performed last December
in the musical skit "Coed Capers."
Many Activities
She also worked on the school
yearbook and was active in the
girls' league barbecue last fall.
Miss Bonn worked part-lime at
the Chinese Kitchen, 4160 El Ca
mino Real. Stanley Young, owner,
described her as "a very sweet
girl and a fine worker."
She was born in Cleveland, 0.,
and moved to Palo Alto in 1950,
where she was enrolled in Her
bert Hoover Elementary School.
She attended Wilbur Junior High
School and spent her sophomore
year at Palo Alto High School be
fore transferring to Cubberley
when it opened two years ago.
She dated Thomas W. Cordry
111, 19, only once, last December,
but the two met frequently in the
neighborhood. Pete Tracy, 18-
year-old freshman here, was a fre
quent date.
Tracy, a former Daily photog
rapher. appeared at the county
jail yesterday and demanded a
talk with the killer.

"I was in love with the girl," he
said and burst into tears. He was
turned away without the inter
view he had requested.

day confirmed that Deena died in
