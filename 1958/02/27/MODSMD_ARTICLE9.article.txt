The flag flew at half-mast at
Cubberley High School yesterday
to mourn the death of Deena
Bonn, pretty 17-year-old student
body leader.
The hid I ways were quieter than
usual in the betw e en - period
breaks. Here and there small
groups clustered together and dis
cussed the murder in whispers.
One girl ran along the corridor
with tears streaming down her
cheeks.- Many others wept to learn
of the death of the popular teen

house and the boy's home across
the street at 246 Edlee. Carloads
of newspapermen patrolled the
area, hoping the boy's parents,
Mr. ajid Mrs. Thcmas W. Cordry
Jr., would return to their home.
The victim's pet dog could be
heard barking behind the closed

garage door*, and her father, a
gray-haired, bespectacled employ

door and said: "No interview . . .
you understand . . . no interview.
