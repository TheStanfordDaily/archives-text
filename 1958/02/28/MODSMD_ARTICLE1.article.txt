# LASSU Vetoes Trial Changes; Vote Planned
## Jeff Commons Casts Single Ballot In Favor of Proposal by Bob Guild 
### 
Legislature vetoed the proposed Judicial Council procedure
changes in action last night at Bowman Alumni House, and set nexl
Wednesday and Thursday for a student referendum.
Only one vote, that of Jeff Commons representing the Village, was
cast in favor of the amendment to the By-laws of the ASSU Con-

slitntion. Sixteen voted against it.
The amendment was presented
in the form of a petition to the
Legislature on Feb. 13, and 475
signers were qualified, according
to elections chairman Bill Rich
ards.
Richards said the polls will lie
open on Engineering Corner Wed
nesday from 8:30 a.m. until 3 p.m.
â€¢and Thursday from 8:30 a.m. until
2 p.m.
Bob Guild, who is not a Legis
lature member but who presented
the petition, said his main concern
is to get the issue before the stu
dents. He said he meant no in
dictment of the Judicial Council,
"which is fair in its actions," or
of Legislature.
Social Pressure
Commons, in support of the sec
tion of the amendment which con
cerns the accuser facing the ac
cused. said he had canvassed his
constituents, finding that they fa
vored the changes. The main ob
jection, he pointed out, was the
social pressure, but he said he
found few who felt afraid of such
social pressure.
The ideal of an honor code was
pointed to by Commons. He said
the problem is how to get people
to live up to the ideal of discuss
ing violations with the violators
and then, if necessary, turning
them in.
Revised Procedure
The representative from Men's
Row. Tom Kranz, noted that most
of the proposals have been incor
porated in the revised Judicial
Council procedure as approved by
Legislature last night, and that
the voters must be educated for
the coming referendum.
Guild clarified the question on
an open or a closed trial by point
ing out that the defendant may
have a trial closed to the public if
he so wishes, but he still has the
right to face his accuser.
In other action last night, Leg
islature approved the dates for
spring elections. Petitions must be
filed by April 10; campaigning
begins April 14; primary elections
will be April 23-24, with final elec
tions April 30-May 1.
Legislature took action on an
appeal by the Zeta Psi fraternity
on a fine levied against them by
the Social Coordinating Board for
failing to register a party. Legis
lature ruled that the fine of $30
and of one Corporation Yard hour
per member was excessive and
referred the case to the steering
committee of the board.
The proposed change in the
Standing Rules of the Publica
tions Board also received its first
reading. The change states that
a salary increase to a publication
member would not take effect
until after his term of office at
the affected position has ended.
