# IIR CONSUL TALK
## Kashmir Issue Argued By Indian, Pakistanis 
### Morrie Hodges 
Heated debate between Rajkumar R. Sinha, Consul General of
India, and Pakistani visitors in the audience as to which country
should control Kashmir enlivened Sinha's IIR consul talk in Bow
man Alijmni House yesterday afternoon.
Highlight of the agitated discussion came when Sinha said. "I

show you what you did in Kash
mir," and read an article from
the New York Times describing
the looting which he said Paki
stan instigated in Kashmir. One
of the Pakistanis replied. "I can
show you a hundred writings of
Indian terrorists."
Outlines Cause
Sinha outlined the cause of
such complete difference of opin
ion in a brief history of the Kash
mir situation. In 1047, Britain de
cided she had "had enough of the
Indians" and, besides freeing
what was British India, she left
fill Indian Native States unpro
tected.
She advised them to become
part of India or part of Pakistan,
but Kashmir was one of the
states which kept its independ
ence under a maharajah. How
ever, many Kashmiri subjects
didn't like the autocracy.
Encouraged Looting
Pakistan encouraged looting
and invasion of Kashmir, accord
ing to Sinha, and India took the
problem to the United Nations,
which investigated and found Pa
kistan guilty of interference.
They resolved to have Paki
stan's forces withdrawn, with In
dia remaining in Kashmir to keep
order until the Kashmiri people
could decide which country to
lie long to.
Discussion
During the discussion period
which followed, Sinha said India
had been wrong in leaving the de
cision up to Kashmir and was
"not ashamed to say we have
made a mistake." Instead, he de
clared, "Kashmir never belonged
to them [Pakistani; it was part
of old India. Kashmir belongs to
us."
When asked why a plebiscite
in Kashmir under direction of the
UN would not be fairer. Sinha re
plied, "We will not have the UN
come into our territory, because
it is our territory." and he re
ferred to the "ungodly principle
of plebiscite."

show you what you did in Kash
mir," and read an article from
the New York Times describing
the looting which he said Paki
stan instigated in Kashmir. One
of the Pakistanis replied. "I can
show you a hundred writings of
Indian terrorists."
Outlines Cause
Sinha outlined the cause of
such complete difference of opin
ion in a brief history of the Kash
mir situation. In 1047, Britain de
cided she had "had enough of the
Indians" and, besides freeing
what was British India, she left
fill Indian Native States unpro
tected.
She advised them to become
part of India or part of Pakistan,
but Kashmir was one of the
states which kept its independ
ence under a maharajah. How
ever, many Kashmiri subjects
didn't like the autocracy.
Encouraged Looting
Pakistan encouraged looting
and invasion of Kashmir, accord
ing to Sinha, and India took the
problem to the United Nations,
which investigated and found Pa
kistan guilty of interference.
They resolved to have Paki
stan's forces withdrawn, with In
dia remaining in Kashmir to keep
order until the Kashmiri people
could decide which country to
lie long to.
Discussion
During the discussion period
which followed, Sinha said India
had been wrong in leaving the de
cision up to Kashmir and was
"not ashamed to say we have
made a mistake." Instead, he de
clared, "Kashmir never belonged
to them [Pakistani; it was part
of old India. Kashmir belongs to
us."
When asked why a plebiscite
in Kashmir under direction of the
UN would not be fairer. Sinha re
plied, "We will not have the UN
come into our territory, because
it is our territory." and he re
ferred to the "ungodly principle
of plebiscite."
Heated debate between Rajkumar R. Sinha, Consul General of
India, and Pakistani visitors in the audience as to which country
should control Kashmir enlivened Sinha's IIR consul talk in Bow
man Alijmni House yesterday afternoon.
Highlight of the agitated discussion came when Sinha said. "I

show you what you did in Kash
mir," and read an article from
the New York Times describing
the looting which he said Paki
stan instigated in Kashmir. One
of the Pakistanis replied. "I can
show you a hundred writings of
