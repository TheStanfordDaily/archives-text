						Message in Murder

|\ i \\o of the most unthinking letters to the
editor vve have read hi a louji time, I he Daily
i.» accused ( below ) of "sensationalism and
'vcllow-dog journalism in its coverage of the
Deeua Bonn murder. The writer of one letter
says we have "insulted" Stanford students, and
wants to know "what kind ol conception I he
I).iilv has ol Stanford students.
We have assumed that Stanford students are
mature, and we have presented the grim facts
of Tuesday's murder with that assumption in
mind. However, some students are apparently
unwilling to look at the facts, and, in pushing
them awav, call our coverage "yellow-dog jour
nalism."
As the penetrating letter from John I). Black
states, "there are many messages in the event,"
and those messages cannot he conveyed unless
the full, grim reality of the event is known.
Murder is an appalling thing as those of us
who saw the blood-soaked body of Deena Bonn
know. It is a sight which will he imprinted on
our minds forever, ami its morbid, terrifying
message of "mail's inhumanity to man" is one
we will never forget.
As to The Daily's "sensationalism,'* our cov
erage had the sanction ol the University's Ad
ministration, News and Publications Bureau
and Department of Communications and Jour
nalism all of whom called our reporting the
most complete, most accurate and most objec
tive of any Bay Area newspaper. Our readers
have only to glance at any Sail Francisco or
IVniusula paper to verify those facts.
We believe the educational value of our cov
erage in beyond the dispute of any thinking

iinl iv idual. Our stories and |»i«• 111 i<»s may have
been sensational but, il so, ii was 111 «• sensa
tionalism inherent in the subject: a morbid
murder which could have been prevented by
education in 111«* goals and value of psychiatry.
Dean Craig told us, concerning The Daily's
coverage of the murder, Ih a I our '"(i r.-i respon
sibility is to inform the students." We agree
completely, and lhal is what we have done.
Il is in the hope of preventing such horrors
that we are printing the "sensational details
of the deep sorrow and frustration being ex
perieneed hy Miss Bonn's family and friends
and hy the entire Stanford community. As
John Bonn, the dead girl's father, said yester
day,"The hoy doesn't need punishment only
help." Cordry should have had that help long
ago. Some of us may need lhal help right now,
and perhaps the lull knowledge of Ih«» agoniz
ing causes and shocking ellecls of Tuesday's
murder will help us get il.
The most terrifying aspect of Miss Bonn s
murder is the realization that am of us, given
the proper pressures and circumstances, could
have committed such an ad. Cordry IS one ol
us his being proud of his car and washing it
on week ends is a disturbingly graphic example
of his "normality."
We have been greatly and sincerely shocked
by the Cordry case, and we believe that it is
our obligation to Stanford students to share
that shock with them. This has been our only
reason for printing the details of the murder
and its aftermath, and we will continue to do
so, as accurately and as completely as is pos
sible.
