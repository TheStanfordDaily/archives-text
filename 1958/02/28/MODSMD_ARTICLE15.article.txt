Disgusting Sensationalism
Editor, The Daily:
II is unfortunate that it took a sensationalized
murder to show the potential of the Daily staff.
Yesterday's page-and-a-half spread on the Cordry
murder showed wilh finality what you can do
with an incident if you want to. There were 10
pictures and two exceptionally long stories on
the details of the case and one more shorter side
bar on Cordry's character. The quality of the
stories and pictures was almost embarrassingly
sensationalized. Two three-column pictures of
1he houses of the victim and the slayer seemed
1o me to be pushing pretty hard at the definition
of a "news photograph." Adding to the general
tasteless treatment was the painful account by
Joan Woods. (I cannot rightfully call this ac
count a newspaper story, for it broke every rule
of objective reporting in existence.)
But beyond the cheap sensationalism, there
way a direct insult to ihe readers of this paper.
For four years I worked for a daily newspaper
in a small industrial town. The background and
general quality of the people reading this paper
were considerably lower than that of Stanford
students and professors. Some of them had not
finished high school, and few had gone to college.
In a small town such as this there were not many
murders, rapes, or abortions, and when there
was one it was big news. The stories about these
few incidents were always put on the front page
with ONE picture. The editor of this daily said
tie would not insult his readers by overwhelming
them with all the disgusting and sentimentalized
sensationalism that could be wrung out of the
case.
Knowing this, and being proud of it, I can't
help but wonder what kind of conception The
1 )aily has of the Stanford students. Do you pos
sibly imagine that we enjoy staring at the houses
of ther |sic| murderer and at reading that "one
gir)"ran along the corridor with tears streaming
down her cheeks," and that "he washed and pol
ished his car, a 19:37 convertible, on week ends
'like any other college man' "?
Now that you have proved to us that you are
a newspaper and can give full and complete cover
ago to stories, I hope that in the future this
coverage will be more maturely directed and
show greater respect for your readers.

l\iin 9 Anger, Emptiness
Editor, The Daily:
In a world where momentous events transpire
daily, it is interesting and perhaps instructive to
speculate on the news value of our recent murder.
The principals were not well known; murder it
self is a common occurrence. Why should so
many of us devour columns of informat ion, much
of il repetitious, about an event of so little ob
jective significance? Why should it enter every
conversation, seriously or a-.s the subject of harsh
bravado or awkward humor? Why should parents
cancel their daughters' dates, or high school girls
stop going out with Stanford men?
1 am sure we sense that there is something very
personal about the event. None of us has enjoyed
so barren a fantasy life that ho has never won
dered what it would be like to commit some shock
ing and dreadful act. Few of us, as children,
never felt neglected, or resentful, and speculated
as to how we might dramatize to our parents our
anger, our distress, our need for their love and
faith. Few of us have not struggled with our
sexual impulses, or feared another's. We may
have buried these appalling thoughts, but buried
Hiings are only hidden.
We read of the immense tragedy that has en
gulfed a fellow student with sympathy, or em
pathy, knowing in some primitive way its pain
;ind loneliness; we read it with perhaps a touch
of resentment because his weakness and his de
feat remind us that impulses can overwhelm a
man; and I think we gain from it also some
strange reassurance: it did not happen to us, we
did not do it like the soldier who experiences

perverse and momentary elation when the buddy
next to him is killed and he realizes that he is
still alive.
There are many messages in the event. For one
thing, though fleeting self-doubts or suspicion of
those around us are not abnormal at a time like
this, they are most'y unwarranted. Most of us
have achieved more effective mastery of our im
pulses—controls that are elastic, not brittle; that
give so they do not break. We are not always "so
quiet, so polite." Most of u.s do not confuse fan
tasy with reality because we have enough mean
ingful ties with other human beings that it is easy
to differentiate the two.
But we could have more. In this universal
struggle to be human by managing our primitive
impulses appropriately, we could help ourselves
and each other more. It should be easier to bare
our feelings, our fears, our dreams to each other.
It should be possible to receive from others more
sense of personal worth, more self-esteem; not
for what we do or for what we appear to be, but
for what we are. For basic needs and emotions
are the same for us all. We could give a lot more
respect and dignity and affection to those around
us. If we did, we would all be stronger and hap
pier. And there would be less of the gnawing iso
lation among crowds, the consuming anger to
ward the world, the feeling of emptiness which
led to Tuesday's tragedy.

4 Yellow-Dog Jo a rn alis m'
Editor, The Daily:
I was not surprised by the poor taste which
you exhibited in your paper today, but rather
disgusted that you had chosen so tragic a subject
over which to exercise your gross indecency.
Apparently you have chosen the path of indis
criminancy to assuage the recent charges of dull
ness and apathy. The unsophisticated treatment
you have given to the Cordry murder case shows
that you live so unrealistically—dully, if you will
— that you cannot handle a very serious matter
without resorting to cheap, tabloid-type reporting.
Hearst "yellow-dog" journalism has no place on
the Stanford campus. Your paper is sold before
it goes to the press, however poor in quality it
may be, and I am referring to content, not the
aesthetic quality of your copy layout; you really
need not resort to "sale by sensation" methods
of journalism.
Your sensationalism reached such a point in
the coverage that you almost forgot that two
people had been involved one murdered, the
other very hurt. Joan Woods' story reads like an
attempt to grab the "Big Story" prize, e.g., ". . .
drama lived behind closed blinds in the dead girl's
unpretentious home . . . ," "the victim's pet dog
barking .. ." Wally Simpson's picture of "Friends
Discuss Tragedy" shows that you viewed ihe
story almost as a social event. Rather than giving
a factual account of the murder, you practically
exhalted [sic| it to the point of being an allegori
cal portrayal of Beauty vs. the Skulking Beast.
Yet you still attempt to present the "characters"
as "average, normal" people.
Undoubtedly you are delighted that you were
able to give the story so complete a coverage. To
my charges you will probably give the traditional
Daily editor answer "we have freedom of the
press," an expression which seemingly absolves
you from any intellectual responsibility lo your
readers. If this is all you can squeeze out of
"that little aphorism" in the corner of your front
page, you have missed Ihe point of coming to gel
a college education. I hope that in the future you
will acquire some characterics [sic], however
marginal they might be. which will exempt your
paper from any of the terms I have already
applied to it.
John LaWrence
P.S.—You might get that man (President Wal
lace Sterlingl to write you a little ditty to the
effect that "intellectual responsibility to readers
should be felt more strongly on a campus than
at other places."
