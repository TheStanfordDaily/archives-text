Craig's announcement of a new
house plan for Stern Hall has led
to controversy over the status of
Ihe independent and just how in
dependent he actually is.
The new plan would make
Stern Hall into eight separate!
houses, with separate house din
ing facilities if the members
wanted them, house libraries, of
ficers, regular social dues, and it
is hoped, separate personalities.
Freshmen would be free to
visit these houses at any time
and open parties would be held
to acquaint men with the advan
tages of each wing. Freshmen
would then b<» free to choose
which house they wished to live
in.
The Daily has asked men living
in Stern and Wilbur Halls, those
primarily concerned with the
changes, what they think of the
new plan.
STIORN
Larry Schubert, Stern, '(50 "It I
will attract more people 1o Stern
and make Stern more agreeable j
to freshmen. And I think it will ;
improve the caliber of the men
living in Stern."
Jim May, Stern, '58 —"I think
it is a good idea. I think the
Stern men should have a chance
to choose who lives in a particu
lar wing, however. Perhaps there
could be one wing where those
who don't" care which wing they
are in could live."
Paul Turvill, Stern, '(»0—"All
the freshmen will want to live in j
the four newest wings. But I
think it will improve the living
conditions by letting the man
choose the group he wants to;
live with. He can be an individ-1
ual among individuals."
Howard Young, Stern, '59—"1 j
don't care for it and I don't care j
about it. I prefer a looser ar
rangement. I don't like the sepa
rate dining facilities."
John Boniben, Stern, 'GO—"I
think their aim is to have a closer
knit group and that is all right.
But the people who came here
did so to be independent. I don't
want to be tied down to any
group."
Jon Kettenring, Stern, '00
"The house system is potentially
good, but can never be superior
to a fraternity as an organiza- {
tion. And the house system at |
Stern should never attempt to i

compete with the fraternity."
(Hail Guthrie, Stern, '59 —"I'm
completely behind it. The letter 1
i hose fellows wrote was a minor
ity opinion. Our wing is a good
living group one ol' the three
good 'wings in Stern, 1 think.
They are not all like this. But
ours has all the personal friend
ship aspects of a good group. We
are not typically dormitory. We
have a group type of life without
obligations. 1 think the freshmen

kind of living in the open

Craig's announcement of a new
house plan for Stern Hall has led
to controversy over the status of
Ihe independent and just how in
dependent he actually is.
The new plan would make
Stern Hall into eight separate!
houses, with separate house din
ing facilities if the members
wanted them, house libraries, of
ficers, regular social dues, and it
is hoped, separate personalities.
Freshmen would be free to
visit these houses at any time
and open parties would be held
to acquaint men with the advan
tages of each wing. Freshmen

are in could live."
Paul Turvill, Stern, '(»0—"All
the freshmen will want to live in j
the four newest wings. But I
think it will improve the living
conditions by letting the man
choose the group he wants to;
live with. He can be an individ-1
ual among individuals."
Howard Young, Stern, '59—"1 j
don't care for it and I don't care j
about it. I prefer a looser ar
rangement. I don't like the sepa
rate dining facilities."
John Boniben, Stern, 'GO—"I
think their aim is to have a closer
knit group and that is all right.
But the people who came here
did so to be independent. I don't
want to be tied down to any
group."
Jon Kettenring, Stern, '00
"The house system is potentially
good, but can never be superior
to a fraternity as an organiza- {
tion. And the house system at |
Stern should never attempt to i

compete with the fraternity."
(Hail Guthrie, Stern, '59 —"I'm
completely behind it. The letter 1
i hose fellows wrote was a minor
ity opinion. Our wing is a good
living group one ol' the three
good 'wings in Stern, 1 think.
They are not all like this. But
ours has all the personal friend
ship aspects of a good group. We
are not typically dormitory. We
have a group type of life without
obligations. 1 think the freshmen
should have a chance to see this
kind of living in the open
houses."
Dour Krolz, Stern, '(JO "This
is lending to make Stern men less
independent."

"I'd like to be able to eat with
the other guys. I'd like to be able
to do things closely with the
other wings."
Jerry Kunmnsky, Wilbur,, '01
"It sounds good to me. It gives
independents a chance to know
the guys better. I don't think
they ought to carry this too far,
though; they'll defeat the pur
pose of being an independent."
Jerry Bartlett, Wilbur, '(>1
"Open houses are a good deal,
but separating the wings of
Stern is making it into a kind of
eating club."
Rich Schmidt, Wibur, '01 - "It
sounds pretty good. The social
functions will improve for inde
pendents, so that you can enjoy
social aspects of a group but
come and go as you please."
