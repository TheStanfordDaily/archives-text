11ow i»- Dullmur's Stanford Indians don't ii 14 -
ilre to have uii easy go of it this weekend. To
night at K they meet Idaho's Vundals. the Pa
cific Coast Conference scoring leaders, who
come to town with guard Gary Simmons, tin*
conference's top individual scorer. Tomorrow
night, same time, they take on the UCLA
Bruins, who hold the league's top spot in field
goal defenses
"No oiu* can defense him," Dallmar exclaimed,
when talking about Simmons; "h<' scored iiB
points in a game against USC." Card guard
I'anl Neumann will he trying to hold down Hie
Vandal whiz I'Jarlier this season, in Idaho's l»7
victory over the locals, Simmons was the game's
high scorer with 21 counters.
Describing the Vandals' as a good moving
team, Dallmar pointed out that they "run well,
use a last hreak offense, and defense with a
zone and a press, in preparing for them you
have to he ready for anything."
Idaho is a good team on the hoards; they rank
third in the conference, with guard Gary IVlc-
Cwen and forward >lim Branom the team lead
ers iu this respect.
Coach Harlan Hodges' Idaho squad ranks
fourth in the conference with its 1 7-0 record.
Stanford rests in eighth place at 4-9.
Comparing the two squads in the statistics
columns, Stanford's llaga comes closest to Sim
mons in scoring at 11.(5; Simmons' holds a 22. 5
points per game average. Hagu, though, leads
the I'CC iu field goal shooting at .512.
A wide gap separates Hie Indians and the

Vandals in the total scoring column; Stanford
has a good hold of the eighth spot with 7MO
points and a 5G.2 average.
Hut the gap between the Bruins and the In
dians in the team field goal defense is as wide
av it can he. The opposition has hit for only 83
per cent of their attempts against the South
landers while the Cards have allowed some II
per cent.
When the Bruins come to town they will have
a special reason to pick up a win. Special, that
is, from any usual one. Coach Johnny Wooden
needs only one victory from the weekend's .jour
ney to boost his record to 100 I'CC wins and 200
overall victories for the ten years he has spent
at Westwood. It doesn't look like they'll make
the grade when they meet Cal in Berkeley Fri
day night.
As wit 11 the Vandals, the Cards will be trying
to get over the rebounding hurdle in their en
counter with the Bruins. The Sduthlandcrs are
fourth in the conference, five places above the
cellar-dwelling Indians, and one spot below the
Vandals.
It is expected that Dallmar will S'lart the same
team that played the I.os Angeles, games last
weekend. It lias John Arrillaga and Jerry Time
sen at forwards, llaga at center and Neumann
and Doug Warren at the guards.
Wooden, who has substituted Kafcr Johnson
at one of his guard slots for Denny ( rum, will
have Torrence at the other guard, Connie Burke
and Jim llalstcn at forwards and Ben Rogers'
at center.
Hodges will start Simmons, HlcKwen, Cole
man, John liivcious and Jim Brown.
