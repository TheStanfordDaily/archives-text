# BRAVES PLAY TOO
## Leopold, Miller to Start On Hill in Weekend Tilts 
### 
The bat and ball season begins
in earnest today at 3:15 p.m.
when San Jose State invades the
Sunken Diamond to battle Dutch
Fehring's Stanford Indians. The
Cards won't let up at all this
weekend, as they then meet Cal
Poly in a 2:30 p.m. Saturday
game here.
Hob L e op o 1 d has drawn the
starting nod on the mound
against San Jose, but will work
only the first six innings. Fehr
ing will let George Avery finish
up the final three frames.
Wally Miller and Dick Wil
liams will split the hurling as
signment on Saturday, going six
and three innings respectively.

Actually, the games will be the
second and third of the year for
the Indians, but the first against
collegiate competition. • Last Sat
urday, Miller, Avery and Leopold
pitched the Cards to a tight 3-2
victory over Jack Shepherd's
alumni nine.
Only a Split
Fehring reported that he did
n't know too much about either
the Spartans or the Mustangs.
He noted, however, that Stanford
has been able to get only a 3-3
split with San Jose over the past
two years. The Indians met Cal
Poly once last year, and barely
squeaked by them.
The line-up named by Fehring
reads Bob Dwight, 3b; Wayne
Marion, ss; A 1 Shaw, 2b; Parker
Olson, If; Rich DeFabio, rf; Ben
Robinson, cf; Ralph Holding, c;
Joel Newkirk, lb; and the pitch
ers.
Hitting Will Toll
"If the hitting is good, we'll
stick with the same line-up Sat
urday," he added.
Meanwhile, the Braves will try
to get back on the winning track
after losing their first of the year
yesterday to San Mateo, 7-2. Er

rors and walks spelled defeat for
the JV's, who could garner only
five hits.
Fred Kober took what few hit
ting honors there were for Stan
ford with a pair of singles and
one run scored.
When the Braves face Santa
Rosa JC at 2:30 tomorrow, they'll
have Roy Lawson and Mike Im
mel splitting the pitching chores.

when San Jose State invades the
Sunken Diamond to battle Dutch
Fehring's Stanford Indians. The
Cards won't let up at all this
weekend, as they then meet Cal
Poly in a 2:30 p.m. Saturday
game here.
Hob L e op o 1 d has drawn the
starting nod on the mound
against San Jose, but will work
only the first six innings. Fehr
ing will let George Avery finish
up the final three frames.
Wally Miller and Dick Wil
liams will split the hurling as
signment on Saturday, going six
and three innings respectively.

Actually, the games will be the
second and third of the year for
the Indians, but the first against
collegiate competition. • Last Sat
urday, Miller, Avery and Leopold
pitched the Cards to a tight 3-2
victory over Jack Shepherd's
alumni nine.
Only a Split
Fehring reported that he did
n't know too much about either
the Spartans or the Mustangs.
He noted, however, that Stanford
has been able to get only a 3-3
split with San Jose over the past
two years. The Indians met Cal
Poly once last year, and barely
squeaked by them.
The line-up named by Fehring
reads Bob Dwight, 3b; Wayne
Marion, ss; A 1 Shaw, 2b; Parker
Olson, If; Rich DeFabio, rf; Ben
Robinson, cf; Ralph Holding, c;
Joel Newkirk, lb; and the pitch
ers.
Hitting Will Toll
"If the hitting is good, we'll
stick with the same line-up Sat
urday," he added.
Meanwhile, the Braves will try
to get back on the winning track
after losing their first of the year
yesterday to San Mateo, 7-2. Er

rors and walks spelled defeat for
the JV's, who could garner only
five hits.
Fred Kober took what few hit
ting honors there were for Stan
ford with a pair of singles and
one run scored.
When the Braves face Santa
Rosa JC at 2:30 tomorrow, they'll
have Roy Lawson and Mike Im
mel splitting the pitching chores.
