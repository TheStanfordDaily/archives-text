# PLAYERS' PRODUCTION
## Humor, Variety Highlight Intimate Revue Opening 
### Camille Petersen 
The hilarious lines from Mark Hammer's "John Brown in Hell"
coupled with enjoyable delivery highlighted the Stanford Players'
"An Intimate Revue" which opened last night at Little Theater.
Featured in the play are Betsy Flint, Lair Parent, William Kin
solving and Hammer. The patriotic parody is a take-off on there-

cording of Benet's "John Brown's
Body" by Agnes Moorhead. Ray
mond Massey and Tyrone Power.
The contrast between the bare
stage during the readings and the
full stage of glamorous "Misses
Armed Forces" at the close of the
act is typical of the contrast in the
entire show.
While the first section of the
revue, consisting of seven acts,
maintains the. interest which the
colorful opener awakens, the sec
ond section starts slowly and does
not pick up until the fourth act,
"A Very Un-dragon Slaying Day."
The next two acts lag, but the
show ends well with the welcome
touch of the professional show
man in the person of Billy White.
Former Professional
White, a former professional
singer and musician, ends the
show with the noted tip of his top
hat. His presentation of songs
and lap steps is doubly appreci
ated after the slowness of the two
preceding numbers, "Waltz" and
"The Balladeer."
"A Visit with Dame Ethel
Squeakwell" features Delia Hurl
hurt and Lair Parent as the silent
dancers. The entire act is most
humorous, especially when Miss
Hurlburt becomes entangled in
the sack-like garment at the end.
Dame Ethel is played by William
Kingsolving.
Weak portions of the evening
include "Tuesday Evening Series,"
which opens the second portion of
the show; "Hatful of Door Knobs"
and "Waltz." In the latter the
j dancers on the whole turn in good
performances, but the choreogra
phy seems weak.
"Tuesday Series"
In "Tuesday Series" Ihe slump
jis caused by tho material, not t tie
actors. In "Ilatful of Door Knobs"
j the fault is divided.
George Willey's "Altar Ego" is
refreshing and well done. He
plays the part of a young man
the night before his wedding, both
| on the slage and on the screen at
I the same time.
"Be a Romeo" also brings many
laughs from the audience, and one
cannot help but feel some sympa
thy for the girls who are expected
to dance vigorously and then
burst into audible song. Some
times words are indistinguishable,
but it is not all their fault.
As usual, Irene Griffin, Dick
Hay and Paul Landry supply ex
cellent costumes, settings and
lighting effects.
The revue will run through Sat
urday and March 6th through Bth.
