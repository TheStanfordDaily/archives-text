# D.A. Files Charge, Seeks First Degree Conviction; Cordry to Plead Monday
## Detectives to Investigate Possible Jealousy Motive 
### Barbara Hicks, Staff Editor 
A firsi-degree murder charge was filed against Thomas Wallace
Cordry 111. 19, yesterday afternoon in the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Cordry, who admits to the slaying of 17-year-old Deena Bonn
Tuesday night, is expected to enter his plea on Monday, Preliminary
hearing has been set for 2 p.m., March 10, in Palo Alto.
The youth's attorney, Alan A. Lindsay, Oakland, said no decision
has been made on the plea. Lindsay said he will have his own psy
chiatrists examine the Stanford student.
Lindsay quoted Cordry as saying, "I feel awfully bad."
"I'm scared to have to meet them [the girl's parents)," he told
his attorney. "They were swell to me. They had me over to dinner."
Lindsay said Cordry "seems closer to reality today than he was
yesterday." He added that the youth still was "not fully conscious
of what he did. He can't explain it."
Captain William Salt of the Sanla Clara County sheriff's detective
division said his investigators will inquire into a possible jealousy
motive involving Stanford freshman Peter Tracy, 18. Tracy says he
was in love with Miss Bonn.
Tracy Fixes Car
Tuesday afternoon Tracy was repairing his car outside the Bonn
home, and Cordry came over to see if he could help fix it. Miss Bonn
was reportedly outside with them, laughing and joking with Tracy.
Captain Salt made it clear, however, that no evidence uncovered
so far has shaken officers' belief in Cordry's story—that he was moti
vated to pick up a girl, kill her, rape her and leave her body in the
foothills.
District Attorney Louis P. Bergna said he will seek a first-degree
murder conviction of Cordry.
Bergna said the youth seems sane by all outward indications, but
yesterday he arranged to have a team of psychiatrists interview him.
Attorney Lindsay told reporters yesterday that Cordry purchased
a .22 rifle at an area sports shop a week before the shooting. He
returned the gun 1o the sports shop the next day, but went back on
Tuesday to buy another.
When asked if he thought Cordry had had an "urge to kill" on
the first occasion, the lawyer replied, "Draw your own conclusions."
Cordry's Suitcase
Salt revealed that Cordry had packed a suitcase with a blanket,
a heavy sweater, denim trousers, a cup, table knife and fork and a
small carving knife "to take care of him while he was in hiding."
Among the hideaway gear was an ice pick which, Salt quoted
Cordry as saying, was intended to "serve the same purpose as
the gun."
Salt said the student told him he had intended to "lay low" in the
hills near Saratoga Gap for a while.
Officers said they plan to have Cordry re-enact the crime and
show them his hideaway spot.
Deputy coroner Hubert Williams said laboratory analyses made
following an autopsy Wednesday confirmed Cordry's story that Miss
Bonn had not been sexually molested.
"I do not want revenge," John Bonn, father of the slain girl, said
yesterday. He said he would try to see Cordry and assure him he
holds "no bitterness."
"The boy doesn't need punishment—only help," Bonn said. "The
boy did terrible harm, but he did not intend to commit a crime."
Bonn: A Nice Boy
Mrs. Bonn, who was present when the father was talking with
newsmen, added that they had always regarded Cordry as "a nice
boy who played with children in the neighborhood and always spoke
softly and politely.
"If we had thought otherwise, we never would have let Deena go
out with him," she said. "He had seemed such a nice boy that I did
not hesitate . *. ."
In an interview with the Palo Alto Times, Bonn said Cordry had
one unusual habit which he was never able to understand. Whenever
lie drove his car past the Bonn home, whether anyone was standing
outside or not, he would honk the horn briefly as though attempting
to bring recognition on himself.
Funeral services for Miss Bonn, a Cubberly High School student,
will be held today at 2:30 p.m. at the chapel of Roller and Hapgood,
980 Middlefield fid. Interment will be in the Alta Mesa Memorial
Park.

show them his hideaway spot.
Deputy coroner Hubert Williams said laboratory analyses made
following an autopsy Wednesday confirmed Cordry's story that Miss
Bonn had not been sexually molested.
"I do not want revenge," John Bonn, father of the slain girl, said
yesterday. He said he would try to see Cordry and assure him he
holds "no bitterness."
"The boy doesn't need punishment—only help," Bonn said. "The
boy did terrible harm, but he did not intend to commit a crime."
Bonn: A Nice Boy
Mrs. Bonn, who was present when the father was talking with
newsmen, added that they had always regarded Cordry as "a nice
boy who played with children in the neighborhood and always spoke
softly and politely.
"If we had thought otherwise, we never would have let Deena go
out with him," she said. "He had seemed such a nice boy that I did
not hesitate . *. ."
In an interview with the Palo Alto Times, Bonn said Cordry had
one unusual habit which he was never able to understand. Whenever
lie drove his car past the Bonn home, whether anyone was standing
outside or not, he would honk the horn briefly as though attempting
to bring recognition on himself.
Funeral services for Miss Bonn, a Cubberly High School student,
will be held today at 2:30 p.m. at the chapel of Roller and Hapgood,
980 Middlefield fid. Interment will be in the Alta Mesa Memorial
Park.

ATTORNEY ALAN A. LINDSAY
Surrounded by Reporters Outside the Courthouse
A firsi-degree murder charge was filed against Thomas Wallace
Cordry 111. 19, yesterday afternoon in the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Cordry, who admits to the slaying of 17-year-old Deena Bonn
Tuesday night, is expected to enter his plea on Monday, Preliminary
hearing has been set for 2 p.m., March 10, in Palo Alto.
The youth's attorney, Alan A. Lindsay, Oakland, said no decision
has been made on the plea. Lindsay said he will have his own psy
chiatrists examine the Stanford student.
Lindsay quoted Cordry as saying, "I feel awfully bad."
"I'm scared to have to meet them [the girl's parents)," he told
his attorney. "They were swell to me. They had me over to dinner."
Lindsay said Cordry "seems closer to reality today than he was
yesterday." He added that the youth still was "not fully conscious
of what he did. He can't explain it."
Captain William Salt of the Sanla Clara County sheriff's detective
division said his investigators will inquire into a possible jealousy
motive involving Stanford freshman Peter Tracy, 18. Tracy says he
was in love with Miss Bonn.
Tracy Fixes Car
Tuesday afternoon Tracy was repairing his car outside the Bonn
home, and Cordry came over to see if he could help fix it. Miss Bonn
was reportedly outside with them, laughing and joking with Tracy.
Captain Salt made it clear, however, that no evidence uncovered
so far has shaken officers' belief in Cordry's story—that he was moti
vated to pick up a girl, kill her, rape her and leave her body in the
foothills.
District Attorney Louis P. Bergna said he will seek a first-degree
murder conviction of Cordry.
Bergna said the youth seems sane by all outward indications, but
yesterday he arranged to have a team of psychiatrists interview him.
Attorney Lindsay told reporters yesterday that Cordry purchased
a .22 rifle at an area sports shop a week before the shooting. He
returned the gun 1o the sports shop the next day, but went back on
Tuesday to buy another.
When asked if he thought Cordry had had an "urge to kill" on
the first occasion, the lawyer replied, "Draw your own conclusions."
Cordry's Suitcase
Salt revealed that Cordry had packed a suitcase with a blanket,
a heavy sweater, denim trousers, a cup, table knife and fork and a
small carving knife "to take care of him while he was in hiding."
Among the hideaway gear was an ice pick which, Salt quoted
Cordry as saying, was intended to "serve the same purpose as
the gun."
Salt said the student told him he had intended to "lay low" in the
hills near Saratoga Gap for a while.
Officers said they plan to have Cordry re-enact the crime and
show them his hideaway spot.
Deputy coroner Hubert Williams said laboratory analyses made
following an autopsy Wednesday confirmed Cordry's story that Miss
Bonn had not been sexually molested.

home, and Cordry came over to see if he could help fix it. Miss Bonn
was reportedly outside with them, laughing and joking with Tracy.
Captain Salt made it clear, however, that no evidence uncovered
so far has shaken officers' belief in Cordry's story—that he was moti
vated to pick up a girl, kill her, rape her and leave her body in the
foothills.
District Attorney Louis P. Bergna said he will seek a first-degree
murder conviction of Cordry.
Bergna said the youth seems sane by all outward indications, but
yesterday he arranged to have a team of psychiatrists interview him.
Attorney Lindsay told reporters yesterday that Cordry purchased
a .22 rifle at an area sports shop a week before the shooting. He
returned the gun 1o the sports shop the next day, but went back on
Tuesday to buy another.
When asked if he thought Cordry had had an "urge to kill" on
the first occasion, the lawyer replied, "Draw your own conclusions."
Cordry's Suitcase
Salt revealed that Cordry had packed a suitcase with a blanket,
a heavy sweater, denim trousers, a cup, table knife and fork and a
small carving knife "to take care of him while he was in hiding."
Among the hideaway gear was an ice pick which, Salt quoted
Cordry as saying, was intended to "serve the same purpose as
the gun."
Salt said the student told him he had intended to "lay low" in the
hills near Saratoga Gap for a while.
Officers said they plan to have Cordry re-enact the crime and
show them his hideaway spot.
Deputy coroner Hubert Williams said laboratory analyses made
following an autopsy Wednesday confirmed Cordry's story that Miss
Bonn had not been sexually molested.
"I do not want revenge," John Bonn, father of the slain girl, said
yesterday. He said he would try to see Cordry and assure him he
holds "no bitterness."
"The boy doesn't need punishment—only help," Bonn said. "The
boy did terrible harm, but he did not intend to commit a crime."
Bonn: A Nice Boy
Mrs. Bonn, who was present when the father was talking with
newsmen, added that they had always regarded Cordry as "a nice
boy who played with children in the neighborhood and always spoke
softly and politely.
"If we had thought otherwise, we never would have let Deena go
out with him," she said. "He had seemed such a nice boy that I did
not hesitate . *. ."
In an interview with the Palo Alto Times, Bonn said Cordry had
one unusual habit which he was never able to understand. Whenever
lie drove his car past the Bonn home, whether anyone was standing
outside or not, he would honk the horn briefly as though attempting
to bring recognition on himself.
Funeral services for Miss Bonn, a Cubberly High School student,
will be held today at 2:30 p.m. at the chapel of Roller and Hapgood,
980 Middlefield fid. Interment will be in the Alta Mesa Memorial
Park.

Surrounded by Reporters Outside the Courthouse
A firsi-degree murder charge was filed against Thomas Wallace
Cordry 111. 19, yesterday afternoon in the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
Cordry, who admits to the slaying of 17-year-old Deena Bonn
Tuesday night, is expected to enter his plea on Monday, Preliminary
hearing has been set for 2 p.m., March 10, in Palo Alto.
The youth's attorney, Alan A. Lindsay, Oakland, said no decision
has been made on the plea. Lindsay said he will have his own psy
chiatrists examine the Stanford student.
Lindsay quoted Cordry as saying, "I feel awfully bad."
"I'm scared to have to meet them [the girl's parents)," he told
his attorney. "They were swell to me. They had me over to dinner."
Lindsay said Cordry "seems closer to reality today than he was
yesterday." He added that the youth still was "not fully conscious
of what he did. He can't explain it."
Captain William Salt of the Sanla Clara County sheriff's detective
division said his investigators will inquire into a possible jealousy
motive involving Stanford freshman Peter Tracy, 18. Tracy says he
was in love with Miss Bonn.
