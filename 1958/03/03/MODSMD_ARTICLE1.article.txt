### 
CAIRO (/P) King Ahmed will protect his absolute rule in Yemen
with a veto power over acts of the federation linking his Arabian
kingdom with the United Arab Republic, a semi-official press report
indicated yesterday.
Tiie newspaper A 1 Shaab announced details of the agreement as
the formal decision to federate was announced to cheering thou

sands in Damascus by President
Nassser and Crown Prince Saif
A 1 Islan A 1 Badr of Yemen.
A 1 Shaab said Nasser and Ah
med will jointly preside over the
federation when it is proclaimed
shortly. The Nasser government
often uses A 1 Shaab to release of
ficial information.
Nasser and Ahmed
The paper said Nasser, presi
dent of U.A.R., and Ahmed will
form a supreme council with
veto power over any decisions re
lating to the federation.
A broader federal council will
be formed of an equal number of
members from both countries. It
will sit in Yemen.
This council will act on foreign
policy and economic, cultural and
defense affairs. It will be re
quired to submit all decisions to
the Supreme Council for ap
proval.
Tight Alliance
As described by A 1 Shaab, the
federation will amount to little
more than a tight alliance. This
is far different from the Egyp
tian-Syrian union in the U.A.R.
The union converted Syria into
nothing but a province.
Yemen and the U.A.R. will
maintain separate armies under
joint command, separate curren
cies, separate representation in
international organizations, and
separate diplomatic missions in
most cases.
