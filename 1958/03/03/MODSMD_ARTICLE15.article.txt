## Bruins Fall Before Card Free Throw Artists; Arrillaga Baskets 20 Points Against Vandals 
### John Schwarz Steve Baffrey 
Stanford's eagers, shooting at the phenomenal
clip of 51.9 per cent, completely overwhelmed the
invading hoopsters from Idaho 72-62 on Friday
night.
Leading the Stanford attack was sophomore

John Arrillaga with 20 points.
Arrillaga, having his host night of
the season, hit on nine of 12 shots
from the floor and potted two out
of two from the free-throw line.
Idaho opened the scoring and
maintained a small lead through
out the first 10 minutes of play,
and with 10 gone they were ahead,
18-13. At this point Stanford's Ar
rillaga and Doug Warren both
started to hit with outstanding
accuracy on jump shots from all
angles.
Basket for Basket
For the next six or seven min
utes the two teams exchanged
basket for basket, with neither
team being able to grab a definite
lead. Coach Howie Dallmar of
Stanford then took a largo gamble
and sent in his second unit.
This gamble proved to be the
difference in the game, for as
soon as the Indians' second five
took the floor Stanford pulled into
a lead it never relinquished.
John Stabler, the quick little
guard, led the second unit in pil
ing up a 41-34 halftime lead. Me
thivw in 7 points in five minutes,
and his 7 combined with Neal
Brockmeyer's 4 points and a bas
ket each from John Pflueger and
Jerry Hose were too much for the
Vandals to cope with.
Downhill Ride
The second half proved to be a
downhill ride for the Indians as
they slowly increased their lead to
as much as 14 points and then
coasted to their victory.
-Paul Neumann, Stanford's floor
leader, played a tremendous de
fensive game in guarding the
high-scoring Gary Simmons of
Idaho. Simmons, averaging in the
neighborhood of 23 points per
game, was held to 17 by the In
dian captain. Most of Simmons'
points came either in the second
half when Stanford had already
iced the game or while the second
unit was in.
Simmons scored only .1 points in
the first 15 minutes of the game
while Neumann was on him. After
Neumann left the game Simmons
added two more quick baskets in
the last five minutes of the first
stanza.
Liveious Thrills Fans'
John Liveious of Idaho took
over the scoring slack for Idaho,
though, and thrilled the Indian
fans with jump shots from ail
over the floor. Liveious, the
game's high scorer with 24, just
couldn't seem to miss, and it was
mostly through his effort alone

Their last field goal of the game went through
the hoop at the eight-minute mark of the second
half, but a barrage of 18 free throws in the final
12 minutes was enough to boost Howie Dallmar's
Stanford Indians to a 57-50 win over the UCLA

Bruins Saturday night in the Pa
vilion.
Stanford's first and second unils
alternated to plow the Bruins
under, and both squads carried
out their orders well. At only one
point in the game, when the sec
ond unit began to misfire in Iho
second half. Were the Cards repre
sented by a less rested and alert
team than the southlanders.
Out shot from Floor
Although outshot from tlie floor
by the Smoggers, 20-14, Stanford
cashed in on the Bruins' 23 per
sonal fouls, making 29 out of 38
attempts, and this was tho turn
ing point in the game. Despite
having hit for a lessor number
from the floor, the Cards out
percentaged UCLA. 35.8 to 31.3.
Stanford's fast-polishing squad
of sophomores and juniors, pre
dicted by some to be surprises
this season, have jumped up into
the sixth spot in the Pacific Coast
Conference, ahead of Oregon,
Washington Stale and Washing
ton.
Against Iho Bruins the Cards
able to grab an edge in the
all-important rebound department
an area in which the Bruins
have usually done well. Center
Dick Ilaga led the local attack
and the game in this field with in.
As a team the Injuns took off 36;
UCLA had 31.
Cards in Trouble
AI times it looked as though
the Bruins would fast-break th"
Cards into a little trouble, man
aging to get down court ahead of
the locals a number of times, only
to have their first attempt
astray and the Cards rush in for
the rebound.
Throughout the game Ihe Dall
marmen played control ball, work
ing hard and often long to get the
best shot and then taking advan
tage of it, drawing Bruin fouls all
the while.
Stanford drew first blood on a
15-foot jumper by Paul Neumann,
then lost the lead until they tied
the Bruins at 9-9 with 11 '/a min
utes to go in the opening stanza.
SU Dominates
From here on in it was a Stan
ford-dominated game until the
second unit lost some of its fi
nesse and allowed the Bruins to
come within one point, 39-38, with
12 minutes to go in the game.
But then the free throws came
into play, the first of the series
coming on Bruin spark Jim Hal
sten's fifth foul of the game. Neu
mann accounted for seven of the
18 gratis tosses, which combined
with 10 markers up to that point
to give him the game high of 17
points.
Without Halsten to hit the long
outside shots, the Bruins were
having a hard time connecting in
the last 12 minutes, scoring 12
points to the Indians' 18. And as
time flew by for them, the visitors
seemed to panic almost to the
point of helplessness.
Halsten led the Bruins with 15;

Stanford's eagers, shooting at the phenomenal
clip of 51.9 per cent, completely overwhelmed the
invading hoopsters from Idaho 72-62 on Friday
night.
Leading the Stanford attack was sophomore

John Arrillaga with 20 points.
Arrillaga, having his host night of
the season, hit on nine of 12 shots
from the floor and potted two out
of two from the free-throw line.
Idaho opened the scoring and
maintained a small lead through
out the first 10 minutes of play,
and with 10 gone they were ahead,
18-13. At this point Stanford's Ar
rillaga and Doug Warren both
started to hit with outstanding
accuracy on jump shots from all
angles.
Basket for Basket
For the next six or seven min
utes the two teams exchanged
basket for basket, with neither
team being able to grab a definite
lead. Coach Howie Dallmar of
Stanford then took a largo gamble
and sent in his second unit.
This gamble proved to be the
difference in the game, for as
soon as the Indians' second five
took the floor Stanford pulled into
a lead it never relinquished.
John Stabler, the quick little
guard, led the second unit in pil
ing up a 41-34 halftime lead. Me
thivw in 7 points in five minutes,
and his 7 combined with Neal
Brockmeyer's 4 points and a bas
ket each from John Pflueger and
Jerry Hose were too much for the
Vandals to cope with.
Downhill Ride
The second half proved to be a
downhill ride for the Indians as
they slowly increased their lead to
as much as 14 points and then
coasted to their victory.
-Paul Neumann, Stanford's floor
leader, played a tremendous de
fensive game in guarding the
high-scoring Gary Simmons of
Idaho. Simmons, averaging in the
neighborhood of 23 points per
game, was held to 17 by the In
dian captain. Most of Simmons'
points came either in the second
half when Stanford had already
iced the game or while the second
unit was in.
Simmons scored only .1 points in
the first 15 minutes of the game
while Neumann was on him. After
Neumann left the game Simmons
added two more quick baskets in
the last five minutes of the first
stanza.
Liveious Thrills Fans'
John Liveious of Idaho took
over the scoring slack for Idaho,
though, and thrilled the Indian
fans with jump shots from ail
over the floor. Liveious, the
game's high scorer with 24, just
couldn't seem to miss, and it was
mostly through his effort alone

Their last field goal of the game went through
the hoop at the eight-minute mark of the second
half, but a barrage of 18 free throws in the final
12 minutes was enough to boost Howie Dallmar's
Stanford Indians to a 57-50 win over the UCLA

Bruins Saturday night in the Pa
vilion.
Stanford's first and second unils
alternated to plow the Bruins
under, and both squads carried
out their orders well. At only one
point in the game, when the sec
ond unit began to misfire in Iho
second half. Were the Cards repre

Stanford's eagers, shooting at the phenomenal
clip of 51.9 per cent, completely overwhelmed the
invading hoopsters from Idaho 72-62 on Friday
night.
Leading the Stanford attack was sophomore

John Arrillaga with 20 points.
Arrillaga, having his host night of
the season, hit on nine of 12 shots
from the floor and potted two out
of two from the free-throw line.
Idaho opened the scoring and
maintained a small lead through
out the first 10 minutes of play,
and with 10 gone they were ahead,
18-13. At this point Stanford's Ar
rillaga and Doug Warren both
started to hit with outstanding
accuracy on jump shots from all
angles.
Basket for Basket
For the next six or seven min
utes the two teams exchanged
basket for basket, with neither
team being able to grab a definite
lead. Coach Howie Dallmar of
Stanford then took a largo gamble
and sent in his second unit.
This gamble proved to be the
difference in the game, for as
soon as the Indians' second five
took the floor Stanford pulled into
a lead it never relinquished.
John Stabler, the quick little
guard, led the second unit in pil
ing up a 41-34 halftime lead. Me
thivw in 7 points in five minutes,
and his 7 combined with Neal
Brockmeyer's 4 points and a bas
ket each from John Pflueger and
Jerry Hose were too much for the
Vandals to cope with.
Downhill Ride
The second half proved to be a
downhill ride for the Indians as
they slowly increased their lead to
as much as 14 points and then
coasted to their victory.
-Paul Neumann, Stanford's floor
leader, played a tremendous de
fensive game in guarding the
high-scoring Gary Simmons of
Idaho. Simmons, averaging in the
neighborhood of 23 points per
game, was held to 17 by the In
dian captain. Most of Simmons'
points came either in the second
half when Stanford had already
iced the game or while the second
unit was in.
Simmons scored only .1 points in
the first 15 minutes of the game
while Neumann was on him. After
Neumann left the game Simmons
added two more quick baskets in
the last five minutes of the first
stanza.
Liveious Thrills Fans'
John Liveious of Idaho took
over the scoring slack for Idaho,
though, and thrilled the Indian
fans with jump shots from ail
over the floor. Liveious, the
game's high scorer with 24, just
couldn't seem to miss, and it was
mostly through his effort alone

Their last field goal of the game went through
the hoop at the eight-minute mark of the second
half, but a barrage of 18 free throws in the final
12 minutes was enough to boost Howie Dallmar's
Stanford Indians to a 57-50 win over the UCLA

Bruins Saturday night in the Pa
vilion.
Stanford's first and second unils
alternated to plow the Bruins
under, and both squads carried
out their orders well. At only one
point in the game, when the sec
ond unit began to misfire in Iho
second half. Were the Cards repre
sented by a less rested and alert
team than the southlanders.
Out shot from Floor
Although outshot from tlie floor
by the Smoggers, 20-14, Stanford
cashed in on the Bruins' 23 per
sonal fouls, making 29 out of 38
attempts, and this was tho turn
ing point in the game. Despite
having hit for a lessor number
from the floor, the Cards out
percentaged UCLA. 35.8 to 31.3.
Stanford's fast-polishing squad
of sophomores and juniors, pre
dicted by some to be surprises
this season, have jumped up into
the sixth spot in the Pacific Coast
Conference, ahead of Oregon,
Washington Stale and Washing
ton.
Against Iho Bruins the Cards
able to grab an edge in the
all-important rebound department
an area in which the Bruins
have usually done well. Center
Dick Ilaga led the local attack
and the game in this field with in.
As a team the Injuns took off 36;
UCLA had 31.
Cards in Trouble
AI times it looked as though
the Bruins would fast-break th"
Cards into a little trouble, man
aging to get down court ahead of
the locals a number of times, only
to have their first attempt
astray and the Cards rush in for
the rebound.
Throughout the game Ihe Dall
marmen played control ball, work
ing hard and often long to get the
best shot and then taking advan
tage of it, drawing Bruin fouls all
the while.
Stanford drew first blood on a
15-foot jumper by Paul Neumann,
then lost the lead until they tied
the Bruins at 9-9 with 11 '/a min
utes to go in the opening stanza.
SU Dominates
From here on in it was a Stan
ford-dominated game until the
second unit lost some of its fi
nesse and allowed the Bruins to
come within one point, 39-38, with
12 minutes to go in the game.
But then the free throws came
into play, the first of the series
coming on Bruin spark Jim Hal
sten's fifth foul of the game. Neu
mann accounted for seven of the
18 gratis tosses, which combined
with 10 markers up to that point
to give him the game high of 17
points.
Without Halsten to hit the long
outside shots, the Bruins were
having a hard time connecting in
the last 12 minutes, scoring 12
points to the Indians' 18. And as
time flew by for them, the visitors
seemed to panic almost to the
point of helplessness.

the season, hit on nine of 12 shots
from the floor and potted two out
of two from the free-throw line.
Idaho opened the scoring and
maintained a small lead through
out the first 10 minutes of play,
and with 10 gone they were ahead,
18-13. At this point Stanford's Ar
rillaga and Doug Warren both
started to hit with outstanding
accuracy on jump shots from all
angles.
Basket for Basket
For the next six or seven min
utes the two teams exchanged
basket for basket, with neither
team being able to grab a definite
lead. Coach Howie Dallmar of
Stanford then took a largo gamble
and sent in his second unit.
This gamble proved to be the
difference in the game, for as
soon as the Indians' second five
took the floor Stanford pulled into
a lead it never relinquished.
John Stabler, the quick little
guard, led the second unit in pil
ing up a 41-34 halftime lead. Me
thivw in 7 points in five minutes,
and his 7 combined with Neal
Brockmeyer's 4 points and a bas
ket each from John Pflueger and
Jerry Hose were too much for the
Vandals to cope with.
Downhill Ride
The second half proved to be a
downhill ride for the Indians as
they slowly increased their lead to
as much as 14 points and then
coasted to their victory.
-Paul Neumann, Stanford's floor
leader, played a tremendous de
fensive game in guarding the
high-scoring Gary Simmons of
Idaho. Simmons, averaging in the
neighborhood of 23 points per
game, was held to 17 by the In
dian captain. Most of Simmons'
points came either in the second
half when Stanford had already
iced the game or while the second
unit was in.
Simmons scored only .1 points in
the first 15 minutes of the game
while Neumann was on him. After
Neumann left the game Simmons
added two more quick baskets in
the last five minutes of the first
stanza.
Liveious Thrills Fans'
John Liveious of Idaho took
over the scoring slack for Idaho,
though, and thrilled the Indian
fans with jump shots from ail
over the floor. Liveious, the
game's high scorer with 24, just
couldn't seem to miss, and it was
mostly through his effort alone

Their last field goal of the game went through
the hoop at the eight-minute mark of the second
half, but a barrage of 18 free throws in the final
12 minutes was enough to boost Howie Dallmar's
Stanford Indians to a 57-50 win over the UCLA

Bruins Saturday night in the Pa
vilion.
Stanford's first and second unils
alternated to plow the Bruins
under, and both squads carried
out their orders well. At only one
point in the game, when the sec
ond unit began to misfire in Iho
second half. Were the Cards repre
sented by a less rested and alert
team than the southlanders.
Out shot from Floor
Although outshot from tlie floor
by the Smoggers, 20-14, Stanford
cashed in on the Bruins' 23 per
sonal fouls, making 29 out of 38
attempts, and this was tho turn
ing point in the game. Despite
having hit for a lessor number
from the floor, the Cards out
percentaged UCLA. 35.8 to 31.3.
Stanford's fast-polishing squad
of sophomores and juniors, pre
dicted by some to be surprises
this season, have jumped up into
the sixth spot in the Pacific Coast
Conference, ahead of Oregon,
Washington Stale and Washing
ton.
Against Iho Bruins the Cards
able to grab an edge in the
all-important rebound department
an area in which the Bruins
have usually done well. Center
Dick Ilaga led the local attack
and the game in this field with in.
As a team the Injuns took off 36;
UCLA had 31.
Cards in Trouble
AI times it looked as though
the Bruins would fast-break th"
Cards into a little trouble, man
aging to get down court ahead of
the locals a number of times, only
to have their first attempt
astray and the Cards rush in for
the rebound.
Throughout the game Ihe Dall
marmen played control ball, work
ing hard and often long to get the
best shot and then taking advan
tage of it, drawing Bruin fouls all
the while.
Stanford drew first blood on a
15-foot jumper by Paul Neumann,
then lost the lead until they tied
the Bruins at 9-9 with 11 '/a min
utes to go in the opening stanza.
SU Dominates
From here on in it was a Stan
ford-dominated game until the
second unit lost some of its fi
nesse and allowed the Bruins to
come within one point, 39-38, with
12 minutes to go in the game.
But then the free throws came
into play, the first of the series
coming on Bruin spark Jim Hal
sten's fifth foul of the game. Neu
mann accounted for seven of the
18 gratis tosses, which combined
with 10 markers up to that point
to give him the game high of 17
points.
Without Halsten to hit the long
outside shots, the Bruins were
having a hard time connecting in
the last 12 minutes, scoring 12
points to the Indians' 18. And as
time flew by for them, the visitors
seemed to panic almost to the
point of helplessness.
Halsten led the Bruins with 15;

Stanford's eagers, shooting at the phenomenal
clip of 51.9 per cent, completely overwhelmed the
invading hoopsters from Idaho 72-62 on Friday
night.
Leading the Stanford attack was sophomore

John Arrillaga with 20 points.
Arrillaga, having his host night of
the season, hit on nine of 12 shots
from the floor and potted two out
of two from the free-throw line.
Idaho opened the scoring and
maintained a small lead through
out the first 10 minutes of play,
and with 10 gone they were ahead,
18-13. At this point Stanford's Ar
rillaga and Doug Warren both
started to hit with outstanding
accuracy on jump shots from all
angles.
Basket for Basket
For the next six or seven min
utes the two teams exchanged
basket for basket, with neither
team being able to grab a definite
lead. Coach Howie Dallmar of
Stanford then took a largo gamble
and sent in his second unit.
This gamble proved to be the
difference in the game, for as
soon as the Indians' second five
took the floor Stanford pulled into
a lead it never relinquished.
John Stabler, the quick little
guard, led the second unit in pil
ing up a 41-34 halftime lead. Me
thivw in 7 points in five minutes,
and his 7 combined with Neal
Brockmeyer's 4 points and a bas
ket each from John Pflueger and
Jerry Hose were too much for the
Vandals to cope with.
Downhill Ride
The second half proved to be a
downhill ride for the Indians as
they slowly increased their lead to
as much as 14 points and then
coasted to their victory.
-Paul Neumann, Stanford's floor
leader, played a tremendous de
fensive game in guarding the
high-scoring Gary Simmons of
Idaho. Simmons, averaging in the
neighborhood of 23 points per
game, was held to 17 by the In
dian captain. Most of Simmons'
points came either in the second
half when Stanford had already
iced the game or while the second
unit was in.
Simmons scored only .1 points in
the first 15 minutes of the game
while Neumann was on him. After
Neumann left the game Simmons
added two more quick baskets in
the last five minutes of the first
stanza.
Liveious Thrills Fans'
John Liveious of Idaho took
over the scoring slack for Idaho,
though, and thrilled the Indian
fans with jump shots from ail
over the floor. Liveious, the
game's high scorer with 24, just
couldn't seem to miss, and it was
mostly through his effort alone

Their last field goal of the game went through
the hoop at the eight-minute mark of the second
half, but a barrage of 18 free throws in the final
12 minutes was enough to boost Howie Dallmar's
Stanford Indians to a 57-50 win over the UCLA

Bruins Saturday night in the Pa
vilion.
Stanford's first and second unils
alternated to plow the Bruins
under, and both squads carried
out their orders well. At only one
point in the game, when the sec
ond unit began to misfire in Iho
second half. Were the Cards repre
sented by a less rested and alert
team than the southlanders.
Out shot from Floor
Although outshot from tlie floor
by the Smoggers, 20-14, Stanford
cashed in on the Bruins' 23 per
sonal fouls, making 29 out of 38
attempts, and this was tho turn
