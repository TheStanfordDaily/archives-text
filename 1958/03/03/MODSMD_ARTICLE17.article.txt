# Aeronauticist Develops New Math Method
## 
### 
L)r. Milton D. Van Dyke, Stan
ford lecturer in aeronautics, re
cently disclosed his discovery of a
new mathematical technique to
aid ballistic missile design, at the
annual meeting of the Institute of
the Aeronautical Sciences in New
York city.
Van Dyke's discovery will aid
in the description by mathemati
cal means of the way air is shoved
aside as a ballistic missile's nose
cone plunges through the atmos
phere at thousands of miles an
hour.
The mathematical description is
very important in predicting accu
rately how much heat will be gen
erated by friction.
Because Dr. Van Dyke's method
can be adapted to electronic com
puters, it opens new possibilities
for improving the design of mis
sile nose cones.
