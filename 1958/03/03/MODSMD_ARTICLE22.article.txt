# A 						Good Investment

V \F.W student publication will make its ap
pearance on campus today designed to provide
a much-needed liaison between, as the editor's
preface puts it,""students who have taken Gen
eral Studies courses and students who have
not."
The publication is "The Scratch Sheet." It
contains a list of 20 undergraduate General
Studies courses, with a description of the physi
cal plan of the courses, a discussion of the
reading list and lectures, and a general evalu
ation. It will he sold on Quad today, on a non
profit basis, for 10 cents.
The idea for such a course listing was taken
from the Harvard Crimson's annual "Confiden
tial Guide to Freshman Courses," and the idea,
we feel, is a good one. Not only may students
get a better idea of a course's content than is
given by the "Announcement of Courses," but
the faculty may benefit from student evaluation
of their efforts as well.
I he first edition of The Scratch Sheet is far
from complete in its coverage of General Studies

courses —a fact of which its editorial board is
well aware. But the scope of future editions
may be enlarged if student support of the ven
ture is strong enough.
The only possible fault we can see in the first
edition is in its method of evaluation. The value
gleaned from a course is a fairly subjective
thing, and The Scratch Sheet offers, in some
cases, merely one person's opinion of a particu
lar course. Vie suggest that the staff follow
further the Harvard Crimson's example and
circulate questionnaires at the end of each year
asking for course evaluations. In this way The
Scratch Sheet would be more accurate and could
serve better as an indication to the faculty of
student opinion—something the faculty usually
seems anxious to get.
But for a first effort, the spring quarter edi
tion of The, Scratch Sheet is successful. We urge
students to make a dime investment in some
thing which may help alleviate the indecision
of pre-reg week and which may help them pass
spring quarter more fruitfully.
