Stanford's Contribution to Justirr
Editor, The Daily:
Now is the lime for all loyal students to rally
1o t lie defense of Stanford's great contribution to
modern judicial procedure—the secret trial with
unknown accusers. This is indeed a marvelous
step forward. We have the Dean's unqualified
assurance that not one single innocent person has
been convicted in the past eight years.
To my mind, the greatest single advantage of
the secret trial is that it prevents agitators from
gathering effective evidence in support of un
founded charges that the system is unfair. Pro
cedurally, a secret trial also offers great, advan
tages. In ihe interests of expediency, rules can be
ignored. Where necessary, and of course only
where the Council feels sure a person is guilty, he
could be convicted upon evidence that shows only
a possibility of guilt, rather than evidence which
proves it beyond all reasonable doubt. This also
illustrates a third great, advantage of the secret
trial: on appeal, the defendant will have no way
of showing that the testimony was inadequate.
While ordinarily a system employing secret
witnesses would be unfair, that is not the case
here, since witnesses are bound by the Fundamen
tal Standard. This insures not only that witnesses
w ill tell the whole truth, undistorted, but also that
their memory will be accurate and complete. Al
though the right to cross-examine is considered a
basic element of due process of law, and guaran
teed by the Constitution, that is immaterial here.
The purpose of a sentence by the Council is edu
cational and in no way punitive. (The educational
impact upon an innocent defendant is somewhat
dubious, but this is unimportant, since the situa
tion is entirely hypothetical.)

In order to further guard the defendant against
any possibility of prejudice, the Council itself
cross-examines witnesses. Its examination will be
fully as thorough and searching as any the de
fendant would conduct, even though it may be
ignorant of the true facts and thus which parts
of the testimony are inaccurate or incomplete—
and in spile of its expressed desire to encourage
people to report suspected violations. And the
fact that the Council acts as both prosecutor and
judge cannot possibly tend to have an insidious
psychological effect upon the manner in which
witnesses against the accused are questioned.
Nor is it possible that the Council might use its
power to cross-examine to make a witness* testi
mony more damaging, or to remove discrepancies
favorable to the accused, or to aid a witness in
"remembering" needed facts. The fact that it is
assumed that prosecution witnesses are telling
the truth accurately and completely especially
guarantees a thorough cross-examination by the
Council. It would be easier for an accused to
present a defense if he knew what the witnesses
against him had said, where they had contradicted
themselves and what parts of their testimony had
made the most impression, but we are assured
that the Council informs the defendant of all
these matters.
I would only recommend one change in the
present system. The accused should have no right
to challenge members of the court. They may be
biased, but, like witnesses, Ihey are bound by the
Fundamental Standard; so the defendant will be
fully protected. A tendency to disbelieve anything
a person says can easily be disregarded during
a trial.
