# The 						Compleat Apathetic

In Sacramento the Communist
Commissar for California silent
ly handed a document to Dr. Ka
rat, President of Fordstan Uni
versity at Palo Corto. Dr. Karat
had worked hard to wheedle ii
out of the conquerors.
It was official permission to
reopen the University under ihe
Master Plan for Reeducation of
America.
Dr. Karat had been required
to submit an academic program
designed to prepare young Ameri
cans to play their assigned part
in the new United Communist
Stales of Earth. He had had also
to pledge full co-operation of the
faculty and students in order to
obtain this permission.
The Commissar, a tall, aggres
sive North C hi n a plainsman,
shook Dr. Karat's hand, stepping
from behind his desk. Said the
Commissar, "You are a fine edu
cator, Doctor. I am glad that
your program shows such prom
ise.
"You know, before the Revolu
tion we studied the educational
system in this area very thor
oughly, and I would like to say
that your ideas for revitalizing
American education caused us
some anxious moments. If you
had been able, together with
your political leaders, to arouse
America out of its apathy as you
planned, our Revolution would
have been much more difficult."
Dr. Karat's aide, an Indian
Thought Control Officer, held the
car door open and asked, "How do
you think the students will like
attending school under the new
regime, Doctor?"
The educator answered wryly,
"It is going to be a shock for
them. No autos, no football
games, no coeds. Study and suc-

ceed or ho assigned to a labor
camp. Of course, directing their
thought is not going to be very
difficult. They never did think
very much anyhow."
They drove back to Palo Corfu
in silence. The future was a grim
prospect for America. Only 11
months ago the Communists had
ordered the United States to sur
render. The Americans, faced
with the overwhelming Commu
nist threat arising simultaneous
ly from Africa, Asia, Central
America and both oceans, had
been forced to capitulate without
a struggle.
l)r. Karat had been among
those who had warned that Amer
ican dedication to pleasure and
materialism would result in ca
tastrophe. He could see the dan
ger reflected over the years in the
attitudes of the students, par
ents, alumni and faculty of Ford
stan. And it had resulted in ca
tastrophe, this neglect by Amer
ica of its ressponsibilities in the
world. The apathy of the people
had made the great Revolution
possible.
The Communists had long plan
ned to capitalize on the dispro
portionate distribution of wealth
between the West and the re
mainder of the world. It had ri
pened the masses for the final
stroke.
As they drove down Olive
Drive, a Kikiyu battalion pre
sented arms smartly. The bat
talion had been stationed to main
tain order on campus. The
massed students, in their grey
denims, led by Junior Thought
Control Officers, gave three dis
ciplined, yet apathetic, cheers.
Dr. Karat thought sadly, "They
haven't changed a bit."
