# VISITOR:
## Freedom Held Back For Uganda 
### Jack Clumeck 
"Although there is some pros-1
sure for self-government in Ugan-1
da, it is not very strong at the
moment," stated C. B. Cartland, j
Minister of Social Services in
Britain's Uganda Protectorate,
during an interview here Thurs
day.
When and if Uganda is granted
self - government, as was Ghana
where Cartland served for 10
years, a "fairly smooth transi
tion" is expected.
The main factor holding back >
Ugandan independence is that
"we are very short of educated !
people," Cartland said.
Uganda is making progress to-1
ward self-government through its
ministerial form of government.
The 10 ministers who are ap
pointed # by the governor "share
the responsibility for the whole
of the affairs of the government."
The Minister of Social Services
outlined his duties as covering
Ihe general areas of education, !
medicine and health, labor and!
African housing. His nation's j
budget is £18 to 20 million per
year, or, in American terms,
nearly $60 million. Of this sum,
Cartland has charge of disburs- j
ing £4 1 (> million for education.
This sum, nearly 25 per cent of j
the national budget, is "probably !
higher, percent age-wise, than any '
other country in the world," Cart
land stated proudly.
After serving in the Gold Coast ,
from 1935 to 1944, Cartland was j
well qualified to comment on the '
recently formed independent
Ghana government.
"One can only hope that they
will succeed; this is the object of
our work." He concluded with j
the optimistic observation that!
Ghana's new government had "all
the qualities of success."
The minister stressed the im-'
portance of his country's situa
tion "right in the center of Af
rica."
Uganda is founded upon a
"peasant - farmer economy." Its
main resources are cotton, cof
fee, tea and, more recently, cop
per and hydro-electric power.
He commented on his part in
Uganda's future when he said,
"The development of social serv
ices is related to increased na
tional income which is related to
increased productivity."
