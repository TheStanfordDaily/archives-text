lead on his serve, llk young Stanfordilc just fell apart and Douglas

White of Stanford.

the Stanford players performed throughout the tourney. Stanford

very fine net play. Carruth and Ililgeman, unseeded at the tourney's
start and playing together for the first time, had reached the finals
by knocking off the highly regarded team of Dave Nelson and Gil
White of Stanford.

lead but Douglas and Jeffries boomed back to tie it up and then
break through both llilgeman's and Carruth's serves to win.
Coach Bob Renkor of Stanford was very pleased with ihe way
the Stanford players performed throughout the tourney. Stanford
took the highest number of points that an eight-man team could, 26 i
of the 30 awarded.
