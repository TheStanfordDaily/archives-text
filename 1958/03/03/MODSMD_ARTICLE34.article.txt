# SU Aquamen Place in Meet
## 
### 
The times weren't the best but
Stanford still got the places in
the San Jose State AAU swim
ming meet Saturday in San Jose.
Robin Moore brought home an
other pair of gold medals as he
swam 10 easy victories in the 100
and 440 freestyles. He was
clocked in 52.4 and 4:s6â€”neither
time particularly outstanding,
but not bad considering the
"slow" condition of the pool.
John Jurgensen and Tom Pe
terson were the other Stanford
winners in the six-event, competi
tion for men. Jurgensen came
home first in the 100 butterfly,
and Peterson took the 200 breast
st roke.
