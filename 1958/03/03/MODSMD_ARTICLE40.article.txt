biting wind that made warming
up difficult. In his six-inning
workout Leopold walked only one
and hit another batter, but struck
out eight.

man mound star, came on to fin
ish up the final three frames for
Stanford. His only trouble came
in the ninth when a pair of walks
backfired into the Spartans' only
two runs.

tack off and winging with his
homer in the second frame.
All They Needed
In the third the Indians got all
the runs they needed to win.
Wayne Marion and A 1 Shaw open
ed the frame with singles, and
each moved up an extra base
when Shaw's base hit was hobbled
in left field.
Larry Williams bore down for
the Spartans and retired the next
two batters, but then Robinson
unleashed hks power again. He hit
a long drive that carried 440 feet
to the base of the incline in left
center; it was good for a triple.
Robinson scored a moment later
when Ralph Holding rapped a one
baser.
