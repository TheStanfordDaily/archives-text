# Because engineering is a profession at GM-your professional stature grows year by year
## 
### 
Here's something of serious importance to
you as a young graduate engineer:
Are you taking just a job—or arc you going
out to really practice the respected profession
for which you have been so fully trained?
Here at General Motors we long ago recog
nized that engineering is a profession —and
began treating our engineers who work on
our hundreds of products as professional men.
lor example our engineers are used on align
ments that give them an opportunity to use
their training and education as they were
meant to be used. To let them practice
engineering.
Or take the fact that CM encourages ils engi
neers to gain professional recognition by
presenting technical papers to engineering
societies.
lake, too, the encouragement our engineers
receive in working for advanced degrees, in
doing original research. The fact tli.it over
ITU of our engineers and scientists received
over 161 patents for such work in a recent
four-month period is one indication of the
opportunity for creative work here at CM.
And these are but a few examples of ihc
fact that engineering is a profession a I
General Motors.

Why do we place engineering in this special
category? Because we know that from the
work of our engineers at our 35 div isions and
126 plants in 71 cities and 19 states—and at
our huge Technical Center near Detroit—will
come the products that will keep General
Motors on its progressive path.
Naturally, you get more than professional
recognition. Your salary rcllccts your ability
and progress.
And. of course, there is opportunity wilhout
limit, l or 11- of the 33 GM Vice-Presidents
are engineers, as arc 23 of Lhe 42 Division
General Managers.
Today we arc looking for young men who
may fill tomorrow's GM executive positions.
Should you wish to join us and practice your
profession as you build your career, let us
bear from you. Il could be the most important.
letter of your life.
