# Insanity Plea Expected in Cordry Case
## 
### 
A plea of not; guilty and not
guilty by reason of insanity is ex
pected to be filed today by Thom
as Wallace Cordry in.
Cordry, who is charged with the
slaying of 17-year-old Deena Bonn,
is being held in the Santa Clara
County jail, pending preliminary
hearing a week from today.
Cordry's attorney. Alan Lind
say, Oakland, said he will have his
own psychiatrists examine the
youth, and two psychiatrists have
been called into the case by Santa
Clara County authorities.
San Mateo County sheriff Earl
B. Whitmore said he wants to
question Cordry about the unsolv
ed beach murder of Carola Har
tog. But Capt. William Salt of the
Santa Clara County sheriff's de
tective force said the questioning
probably will not take place for a
matter of weeks.
"I don't think there is any con
nection," Salt added.
Officers are also investigating
the report of a 14-year-old Los
Altos Hills girl who was shot at
on Feb. 19. Alice Hardy said she
had just passed a youth sitting in
a parked white convertible when
she heard a crack like a rifle.
"Something brushed my skirt,"
she said. "I heard it |the bullet |
zing by me."
The youth in the convertible
drove away. Miss Ilardy's Â«kirt
had a finger-size hole in it.
"If her story holds up and indi
cates the possibility that it was
Cordry." Salt said, "we will have
Alice confront him."
