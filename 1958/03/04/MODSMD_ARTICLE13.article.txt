# STANFORD VS. WEST POINT
## U.S. Mid-Eastern Policy A Failure, Say Debaters 
### Linda Herman 
That the foreign policy of the
United States in the Middle East
has failed was the consensus of
a panel composed of Ardcn Shen
ker and Lester O'Shea of Stan
ford, and James B. Hall and Jack
O. Bradshaw of West Point.
The panel, moderated by Kirk
West, met last night to discuss
the question of our Middle East

ern foreign policy.
O'Shea presenter! the United
States foreign policy as consist
ing of two main goals: upholding
the position of the United States
in the Middle East and prevent
ing the advancement of Soviet
Communist interests in that area.
Bradshaw staled that "the Mid
dle Eastern situation from any
aspect is characterized by insta
bility." In the political sphere in
stability is manifested by the
Arab-Israeli conflict and the con
flict within the Arab states them
selves.
A backward agrarian economy
and too strong a reliance upon
oil resources describes the eco
nomic situation. The different re
ligious and racial groups in the
area create a social instability.
"It's up to us to let the peoples
in this area know that we have a
foreign policy and exactly what
it is," stated Cadet Hall.
He compared the United States
Middle Eastern policy to a house
built in a precarious position on
the edge of a cliff. Instead of re
building our foreign policy anew
we are trying to patch it up.
Shenker viewco our present
foreign policy as a "long-range
ethical goal, encouraging the Mid
dle Eastern countries to prepare
their own governmental founda
tions on well-thought-out ethical
principles."
It was said the real weaknesses
of United States foreign policy
are unrealistic goals. Instead of
determining our minimum goal
of keeping Communists out, we
have tried to attain the maxi
mum goal of forcing our United
States ideals on the Middle East
ern countries.

the question of our Middle East

ern foreign policy.
O'Shea presenter! the United
States foreign policy as consist
ing of two main goals: upholding
the position of the United States
in the Middle East and prevent
ing the advancement of Soviet
Communist interests in that area.
Bradshaw staled that "the Mid
dle Eastern situation from any
aspect is characterized by insta
bility." In the political sphere in
stability is manifested by the
Arab-Israeli conflict and the con
flict within the Arab states them
selves.
A backward agrarian economy
and too strong a reliance upon
oil resources describes the eco
nomic situation. The different re
ligious and racial groups in the
area create a social instability.
"It's up to us to let the peoples
in this area know that we have a
foreign policy and exactly what
it is," stated Cadet Hall.
He compared the United States
Middle Eastern policy to a house
built in a precarious position on
the edge of a cliff. Instead of re
building our foreign policy anew
we are trying to patch it up.
Shenker viewco our present
foreign policy as a "long-range
ethical goal, encouraging the Mid
dle Eastern countries to prepare
their own governmental founda
tions on well-thought-out ethical
principles."
It was said the real weaknesses
of United States foreign policy
are unrealistic goals. Instead of
determining our minimum goal
of keeping Communists out, we
have tried to attain the maxi
mum goal of forcing our United
States ideals on the Middle East
ern countries.
