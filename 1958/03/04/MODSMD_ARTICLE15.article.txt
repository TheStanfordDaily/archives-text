"Literary magazines are not
new at Stanford," Miss Ogden
stated. "There has been a large
number in the past. Generally,

they have failed because of poor
formats and staff â€¢ written arti
cles.
"To solve these problems, Se
quoia adopted a format permit
ling extensive work with design
and art features and providing
for a variety of types of material.
We feel that the material we pub
lish is equal to the best writing
done in any college.
"To encourage the writing of
significant articles by students,
our editorial board works closely
with authors rather than publish
ing its own work. Further, we
encourage the reprinting of ma
terial from Sequoia in national
j magazines. Two articles, four
stories and several poems have
appeared in other publications.
"Finally, we hope to provide
outlets for creative work in addi
tion to the magazine itself, by
sponsoring speeches, readings,
discussions and displays of art
work and photography."
