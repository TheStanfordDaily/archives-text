# Nixon to Be Acting President In Case Ike Unable to Serve
## Pair Agree Provision Is Constitutional 
### 
WASHINGTON </P)- The
White House announced yester
day an agreement under which
Vice-President Nixon would be
come acting President if Presi
dent Eisenhower should become
unable to serve.
Press Secretary James C. Ilag
erty described it as more or less
the copy of an understanding Ei
senhower and Nixon have had.
Eisenhower mentioned an under
standing at his news conference
last Wednesday; he refused then
to say exactly what was in it.
Consistent
Yesterday, Hagerty issued the
following statement:
"The President and the Vice-
President have agreed that the
following procedures are in ac
cord with the purposes and pro
visions of Article Two, Section
One. of the Constitution, dealing
with Presidential inability. They
believe that these procedures,
which are intended to apply to
themselves only, are in no sense
outside or contrary to the Consti
tution but are consistent with its
present provisions and imple
ment its clear intent.
Exercise Power
"1. In the event of inability the
Vice - President would serve as
acting President, exercising the
powers and duties of the office
until the inability had ended.
"2. In the event of an inability
which would prevent the Presi
dent from so communicating with
the Vice-President, the Vice-Pres
ident, after such consultation as
seems to him appropriate under
the circumstances, would decide
upon the devolution of the pow
ers and duties of the office and
would serve as acting President,
until the inability had ended.
President Decides
"3. The President, in cither
event, would determine when the
inability had ended and at that
time would resume the full excr
cise of the powers and duties of
the office."
The Constitution provides that
the Vice-President shall take over
the duties of the Presidency in
the event of the President's res
ignation. ouster, death or disabil
ity. It does not say in so many
words how a decision is to be
reached on when a President is
disabled, nor who should make
the decision.
