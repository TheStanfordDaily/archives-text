# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## The 						Disability Puzzle 
### Walter Lippmann 
Mr. Eisenhower himself has, as we know, asked
Congress to clear up the uncertainties of the Con
stitution on the question of a disabled President.
There is, moreover, an Administration bill drafted
in the Department of Justice which was intro
duced in the House of Representatives last spring.
There is, therefore, nothing indelicate about dis
cussing the problem, which should be done with
the kind of matter-of-factness that a sensible man
adopts when ho makes his will.
Yet, while some progress seems to have Ijeen
made, Congress continues to be hesitant to act —
rather like a man who, knowing that lie ought to
make a will, [Hits off going to see his lawyer. There
are several reasons why Congress puts off action.
They an' all, so it seems to me, aspects of one
general reason. This is a search for a "solution"
of the problem which will suit everybody now and
in all conceivable contingencies in the future.
No such solution will ever bo found, and it is
useless to look for the kind of solution which will
cover everything tli;it a writer of mystery stories
might imagine as for example, a secret criminal
conspiracy to oust a President and to usurp the
office. In dealing with this problem, as with any
other of the structural questions of the Constitu
tion, wo must assume that the great officers of
the state are honorable and honest men, most
particularly in the highest matters. If we do not
miike this assumption, we find ourselves in a
hopeless complication of suspicions, trying to find
some way where everybody concerned in the de
cision is able to chock and balance everyone else.
* *
At the level of common sense in practical af
fairs, the problem falls into two parts which can
be and, I think, should be dealt with separately.
The first part has to do with a case where, in
the words of Representative Keating, who is a
leader in the field, there is "a temporary disa
bility declared by iho President himself."
The second part, which Mr. Keating calls the
' real problem." arises "when a disabled President
either refuses to admit his disability or is physi
cally unable to do so."
Taking the two eases separately, we find that
the tirst case is easy to deal with and the second
is rather puzzling. When the President himself
declare* that lie is for the time being disabled,
which is" the first case, there is general, though
not unanimous, agreement that it is the intent
of the Constitution that the Vice President should
act as President until the President himself de
clares that his disability has ended. There are
some lawyers who think that to clarify this prop
osition a constitutional amendment is necessary,

or at least desirable. But there is high legal
authority for thinking that in this ease Congress
itsell' has the power to declare what the Consti
tution means.
Now, it would ho prudent and sensible, in my
view, for Congress to act promptly on the first
part of the problem. It is not entirely inconceiv
able that if Congress had clarified this point, the 1
President, when he was stricken last autumn, !
might have devolved his powers temporarily to
the Vice President. This might well have been
the wisest thing to do both as to the effectiveness
of his office and in the interests of his own health.
Be that as it may, since agreement is possible
on this part of the problem, Congress should acl
even though there is not as yet agreement on the ■
second and much more puzzling part of the prob
lem.
It is something of a puzzle to decide what shall
be done in case a disabled President is enfeebled,
is unconscious, or worse still is irrational. The
problem is who in Ihe government is to raise the
question of the President's disability, and who is
to decide finally whether ho is disabled.
My own view is that the initiative in raising
the question should be in the executive branch —
in the Cabinet and in the White House itself. On
the other hand, the final power to decide the ques
tion should be in the Congress.
In other word:-;, if iho President is disabled and '
unable to make his own decision, the fact of his !
disability will have to bo made known by the
members of his own official family—presumably, 1
I should say, by the Secretary of State. Under I
modern conditions of publicity, it would bo quite I
impossible to conceal the President's disability j
as was done in the cases of Garfield and Wilson. 1
# *
When the question of the President's disability
lias been raised, the Vice President should go to
Congress or, if necessary, call it into special ses
sion. He should communicate the facts of the
President's condition and should ask Congress to
vote on his assumption of the powers of the Act
ing President. The legality of the proceedings
could Ih> tested promptly in the courts, say, on
the question of the Acting President's appoint
ment of a postmaster.
Neither this nor any other solution is foolproof. ■
But for this one it can bo said, I believe, that if
Congress does nothing at all, leaving things as
they now are. something very like this solution
probably would have to bo improvised if an emer
gency arose.

hopeless complication of suspicions, trying to find
some way where everybody concerned in the de
cision is able to chock and balance everyone else.
* *
At the level of common sense in practical af
fairs, the problem falls into two parts which can
be and, I think, should be dealt with separately.
The first part has to do with a case where, in
the words of Representative Keating, who is a
leader in the field, there is "a temporary disa
bility declared by iho President himself."
The second part, which Mr. Keating calls the
' real problem." arises "when a disabled President
either refuses to admit his disability or is physi
cally unable to do so."
Taking the two eases separately, we find that
the tirst case is easy to deal with and the second
is rather puzzling. When the President himself
declare* that lie is for the time being disabled,
which is" the first case, there is general, though
not unanimous, agreement that it is the intent
of the Constitution that the Vice President should
act as President until the President himself de
clares that his disability has ended. There are
some lawyers who think that to clarify this prop
osition a constitutional amendment is necessary,

or at least desirable. But there is high legal
authority for thinking that in this ease Congress
itsell' has the power to declare what the Consti
tution means.
Now, it would ho prudent and sensible, in my
view, for Congress to act promptly on the first
part of the problem. It is not entirely inconceiv
able that if Congress had clarified this point, the 1
President, when he was stricken last autumn, !
might have devolved his powers temporarily to
the Vice President. This might well have been
the wisest thing to do both as to the effectiveness
of his office and in the interests of his own health.
Be that as it may, since agreement is possible
on this part of the problem, Congress should acl
even though there is not as yet agreement on the ■
second and much more puzzling part of the prob
lem.
It is something of a puzzle to decide what shall
be done in case a disabled President is enfeebled,
is unconscious, or worse still is irrational. The
problem is who in Ihe government is to raise the
question of the President's disability, and who is
to decide finally whether ho is disabled.
My own view is that the initiative in raising
the question should be in the executive branch —
in the Cabinet and in the White House itself. On
the other hand, the final power to decide the ques
tion should be in the Congress.
In other word:-;, if iho President is disabled and '
unable to make his own decision, the fact of his !
disability will have to bo made known by the
members of his own official family—presumably, 1
I should say, by the Secretary of State. Under I
modern conditions of publicity, it would bo quite I
impossible to conceal the President's disability j
as was done in the cases of Garfield and Wilson. 1
# *
When the question of the President's disability
lias been raised, the Vice President should go to
Congress or, if necessary, call it into special ses
sion. He should communicate the facts of the
President's condition and should ask Congress to
vote on his assumption of the powers of the Act
ing President. The legality of the proceedings
could Ih> tested promptly in the courts, say, on
the question of the Acting President's appoint
ment of a postmaster.
Neither this nor any other solution is foolproof. ■
But for this one it can bo said, I believe, that if
Congress does nothing at all, leaving things as
they now are. something very like this solution
probably would have to bo improvised if an emer
gency arose.

Mr. Eisenhower himself has, as we know, asked
Congress to clear up the uncertainties of the Con
stitution on the question of a disabled President.
There is, moreover, an Administration bill drafted
in the Department of Justice which was intro
duced in the House of Representatives last spring.
There is, therefore, nothing indelicate about dis
cussing the problem, which should be done with
the kind of matter-of-factness that a sensible man
adopts when ho makes his will.
Yet, while some progress seems to have Ijeen
made, Congress continues to be hesitant to act —
rather like a man who, knowing that lie ought to
make a will, [Hits off going to see his lawyer. There
are several reasons why Congress puts off action.
They an' all, so it seems to me, aspects of one
general reason. This is a search for a "solution"
of the problem which will suit everybody now and
in all conceivable contingencies in the future.
No such solution will ever bo found, and it is
useless to look for the kind of solution which will
cover everything tli;it a writer of mystery stories
might imagine as for example, a secret criminal
conspiracy to oust a President and to usurp the
office. In dealing with this problem, as with any
other of the structural questions of the Constitu
tion, wo must assume that the great officers of
the state are honorable and honest men, most
particularly in the highest matters. If we do not
miike this assumption, we find ourselves in a
hopeless complication of suspicions, trying to find
some way where everybody concerned in the de

part of the problem. It is not entirely inconceiv
able that if Congress had clarified this point, the 1
President, when he was stricken last autumn, !
might have devolved his powers temporarily to
the Vice President. This might well have been
the wisest thing to do both as to the effectiveness
of his office and in the interests of his own health.
Be that as it may, since agreement is possible
on this part of the problem, Congress should acl
even though there is not as yet agreement on the ■
second and much more puzzling part of the prob
lem.
It is something of a puzzle to decide what shall
be done in case a disabled President is enfeebled,
is unconscious, or worse still is irrational. The
problem is who in Ihe government is to raise the
question of the President's disability, and who is
to decide finally whether ho is disabled.
My own view is that the initiative in raising
the question should be in the executive branch —
in the Cabinet and in the White House itself. On
the other hand, the final power to decide the ques
tion should be in the Congress.
In other word:-;, if iho President is disabled and '
unable to make his own decision, the fact of his !
disability will have to bo made known by the
members of his own official family—presumably, 1
I should say, by the Secretary of State. Under I
modern conditions of publicity, it would bo quite I
impossible to conceal the President's disability j
as was done in the cases of Garfield and Wilson. 1

When the question of the President's disability
lias been raised, the Vice President should go to
Congress or, if necessary, call it into special ses
sion. He should communicate the facts of the
President's condition and should ask Congress to
vote on his assumption of the powers of the Act
ing President. The legality of the proceedings
could Ih> tested promptly in the courts, say, on
the question of the Acting President's appoint
ment of a postmaster.
Neither this nor any other solution is foolproof. ■
But for this one it can bo said, I believe, that if
Congress does nothing at all, leaving things as
they now are. something very like this solution
probably would have to bo improvised if an emer
gency arose.

Mr. Eisenhower himself has, as we know, asked
Congress to clear up the uncertainties of the Con
stitution on the question of a disabled President.
There is, moreover, an Administration bill drafted
in the Department of Justice which was intro
duced in the House of Representatives last spring.
There is, therefore, nothing indelicate about dis
cussing the problem, which should be done with
the kind of matter-of-factness that a sensible man
adopts when ho makes his will.
Yet, while some progress seems to have Ijeen
made, Congress continues to be hesitant to act —
rather like a man who, knowing that lie ought to
make a will, [Hits off going to see his lawyer. There
are several reasons why Congress puts off action.
They an' all, so it seems to me, aspects of one
general reason. This is a search for a "solution"
of the problem which will suit everybody now and
in all conceivable contingencies in the future.
No such solution will ever bo found, and it is
useless to look for the kind of solution which will
cover everything tli;it a writer of mystery stories
might imagine as for example, a secret criminal
conspiracy to oust a President and to usurp the
office. In dealing with this problem, as with any
other of the structural questions of the Constitu
tion, wo must assume that the great officers of
the state are honorable and honest men, most
particularly in the highest matters. If we do not
miike this assumption, we find ourselves in a
hopeless complication of suspicions, trying to find
some way where everybody concerned in the de
cision is able to chock and balance everyone else.
* *
At the level of common sense in practical af
fairs, the problem falls into two parts which can
be and, I think, should be dealt with separately.
The first part has to do with a case where, in
the words of Representative Keating, who is a
leader in the field, there is "a temporary disa
bility declared by iho President himself."
The second part, which Mr. Keating calls the
' real problem." arises "when a disabled President
either refuses to admit his disability or is physi
cally unable to do so."
Taking the two eases separately, we find that
the tirst case is easy to deal with and the second
is rather puzzling. When the President himself
declare* that lie is for the time being disabled,
which is" the first case, there is general, though
not unanimous, agreement that it is the intent
of the Constitution that the Vice President should
act as President until the President himself de
clares that his disability has ended. There are
some lawyers who think that to clarify this prop
osition a constitutional amendment is necessary,

or at least desirable. But there is high legal
authority for thinking that in this ease Congress
itsell' has the power to declare what the Consti
tution means.
