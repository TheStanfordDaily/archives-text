Ifnsiotis Musi lie teased
Editor, The Daily:
After reading this morning's Daily one can see
that a major change in the academic life of the
University is needed. Tensions and study pres
sures on students must be eased, for the pressures
exerted by faculty and Administration on the
student body are too great for the Stanford stu
dent to endure.
A murderer plus an aborter [sic| should be all
the proof that is needed to show that something
must be done. Personality cannot be the reason
that these things happen, for we are told over

and over by the Administration that we are su
perior students. It is hoped that Administration
and faculty will sen this problem and take suit
able action.

'Never Wash My Car ,
Editor, The Daily:
I am a college man and own a convertible. I
never wash it. Should I see a psychiatrist?
