## Riesman Article, Stories Make Sequoia Excellent 
### Dick Frey 
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, has published many
excellent issues since its incep
tion three years ago, and the win
ter issue is no exception.
The feature article is by noted
sociologist David Riesman, co
author of "The Lonely Crowd"
and author of "Individualism Re
considered." This time Riesman
turns his attention lo the college
student in "The College Student
in an Age of Organization," which
is perhaps the best article Se
quoia has published.
In studying interviews with
college seniors concerning their
hopes and plans for post-college
life, .Riesman has detected what
he terms "a silent revolution
against work."
"This reflects, in part, the fact
that much work is meaningless
per se, save as a source of in
come, prestige and sociability;
but it also indicates . . . that
people too readily accept their
work as it comes, without hope
of making it more meaningful,"
he says.
Lack of Initiative
As a basic example, Riesman
cites the college student's lack of
initiative in taking action to re
vise a college curriculum which
leaves most of his problems un
explored and unanswered.
Students complain about many
elements of their college social
life and suggest action to change
these elements, Riesman says.
However, he observes that they
seldom discuss "the actual educa
tional process and how it might
be improved."
Me says most students consider
the university as an immoveable
organization which cannot be
changed, just as most Americans
tend to view large business and

government organizations as un
shakeable. . , We remain the
children of organization, not the
masters of it," according to Ries
man.
Analysis' Summary
He sums up his analysis with a
statement which all college stu
dents should consider:
"My concern is that young peo
ple today, by playing it cool and
fearing to he thought squares,
may create a style of life, not
only in work hut in every dimen
sion of existence, which is less
full, less committed, less com
plex and less meaningful than
mid-century opportunities allow."
In the short story category,
Sequoia departs from the pattern
of stories published in the last
few isssues, and with gratifying
results. Instead of literature for
psychoanalysts featuring charac
ters of a "beat generation" na
ture, this issue contains two well
written stories about everyday
persons and their problems.
Short Stories
"Old Nick's Wife" by David
Dow tells of Beth Ellington's
struggle against her husband's
plans for their son's future.
Peter Shrubb's "Rites of
Spring" concerns the emotional
problems of a teen-age love af
fair.
Also in the issue is a section of
photographs, so m e interesting,
some etxremely dull. The section
lacks an explanatory note con
cerning the-inclusion of the pho
tographs, and one wonders why
they are there.
Poetry by Francis Fike, George
Keithley and William Spenge
mann is also included.
The Reisman article and the
two short stories make the win
ter issue of Sequoia worth twice
the 40-cent price of the magazine.
