The Stanford Bridge Club's reg-1
ular tournament will be held to
night at the Stanford Women's
Clubhouse at 7:15.
Before 1 give the solution to
the double dummy hand from my
Bridge Contest, here's some ad
vice on declarer play. Decide how
you intend to play the hand be
fore playing to the first trick in
dummy. Count both your win
ners and losers at this time. They
won't necessarily add up to 13.
For example, you may be able to .
take 10 tricks, but the opponents!
may take four tricks first, if
given the chance.
It's better to pause at the start
than to stop three or four times)
during the hand. Try to always
play at the same speed, fast if'
possible. You may not play ifny
better, but you'll have a lot more
fun!
Opening lead: king of clubs.

Analysis of the problem hand
shows that you have 12 winners
and one loser. But since spades
break 3-2 and trumps break no
worse than 3-1, all 13 tricks can
! be made using the following line
I of play. (This isn't the only cor
! rect line of play.)
Win the opening lead of the
| Club King with the Ace. Lead I
i the Heart King, playing small
; from dummy, and follow with a ;
j small trump to the Queen. Lead j
| a small Spade to your hand, and j
cash the Ace and King of Spades, j
! Now lead a small Diamond to the
| King, lead the Ace of Diamonds, j

and sluff the 3 of Spades. Lead
a small Spade and trump it with
the Jack of Hearts. Draw trumps
by leading a small trump to the
Ace, cash the two Spades, shill
ing your two losing Clubs, and
claim the last two tricks with
your trumps.
Thanks are in order to former
National Men's Champion Paul
Allinger and George Ateljevich,

ular tournament will be held to
night at the Stanford Women's
Clubhouse at 7:15.
Before 1 give the solution to
the double dummy hand from my
Bridge Contest, here's some ad
vice on declarer play. Decide how
you intend to play the hand be
fore playing to the first trick in
dummy. Count both your win
ners and losers at this time. They
won't necessarily add up to 13.
For example, you may be able to .
take 10 tricks, but the opponents!
may take four tricks first, if
given the chance.
It's better to pause at the start
than to stop three or four times)
during the hand. Try to always
play at the same speed, fast if'
possible. You may not play ifny
better, but you'll have a lot more
fun!
Opening lead: king of clubs.

Analysis of the problem hand
shows that you have 12 winners
and one loser. But since spades
break 3-2 and trumps break no
worse than 3-1, all 13 tricks can
! be made using the following line
I of play. (This isn't the only cor
! rect line of play.)
Win the opening lead of the
| Club King with the Ace. Lead I
i the Heart King, playing small
; from dummy, and follow with a ;
j small trump to the Queen. Lead j
| a small Spade to your hand, and j
cash the Ace and King of Spades, j
! Now lead a small Diamond to the
| King, lead the Ace of Diamonds, j

and sluff the 3 of Spades. Lead
a small Spade and trump it with
the Jack of Hearts. Draw trumps
by leading a small trump to the
Ace, cash the two Spades, shill
ing your two losing Clubs, and
claim the last two tricks with
your trumps.
Thanks are in order to former
National Men's Champion Paul
Allinger and George Ateljevich,
a prominent Life Master from
San Francisco, for their help in
the formulation of the contest.
