Optimistic is hardly the word for all the spouting off now being
done by Southland track and field coaches. To hear .less .Mortensen
and ( liuck < oker talk, one would assume that he might just as well
throw out all ihe world record books and insert litis spring's ex
pected performances of the Trojans and Occidental Tigers. It al
most begins 1o look as though there's no point in Stanford going
south lor their meets with USC and Oxy, what with all the southern
talent that figures to take all the places according to its coaches.
Here are a few qxcerpts from Coker comments as listed in Mux
Stiles' "Stiles in Sports" in the 1..A. .Mirror-News:
"Ty lludley, 880-mile. Unlimited possibilities for both Ty and
Dave Keisbord to better I minute*. It's only the mental barrier."
"Clarence Treat, hurdles-broad jump. The Llvis I'resley of the
track team. Look for under II flat in the high hurdles."
"Todd White, 880-mile. Kan 4:08.8 last year and will be another
man within peach ol I minutes. Has any school ever bad three
such runners as lladlcy, Keisbord and White?"
'Molin Zct/man, JJ'iO. Insists he will break 1 lie school record of
20.0 in the 'i'lo and I think lie will."
Well, enough for Coker (a Stanford grad, by the way) and his
predictions. Let's take a look at what .Mortensen is saying:
"I think ... I KNOW they'll be national champions." Jess was
speaking at a Trojan Track Alumni dinner when he made his great
hig flat prediction. lie might, at that, come plenty close to being
right if early season marks are any indication.
In workouts, Troy had Wayne Lemons clocked in a 3:01.1 1320,
and Wcs McLeod was in at 3:01.6. Add 31al Kobertson (3:04), Boh
Shankland (3:05) and Atis IVlerson (3:06), plus >lax Truex, the na
tion's best long distance man, and it looks like USC is loaded in the
long races.
What's Happening at USC?
Remember back to the Slirine-Hi game of last fall? All the talk
was about the tremendous baekfield the South team had, and how
ii would tear everything to pieces. It didn't (lost to the North, 32-01
hut that didn't temper the enthusiasm at USC when it was learned
that the Trojans had made off with the three big names in that back
field.
Things are different now. Kandy .Meadows played his frosh ball
at Figueroa Tech, then pulled out for Long Beach City College. Now
he's headed for Arizona State.. The Trojans have put up a front of
low grades in saying that .Meadows couldn't make it anyhow, but it
sounds pretty weak. He had good high school marks, and besides,
when did grades keep anybody from playing there anyhow?
Meadows* running mate in that Shrine baekfield was Mickey
Flynn of Anaheim. He went to Long Beach last fall, averaged 7
yards a carry on a fair team, and was all set for Trojanville. He isn't
going there; he'll join Meadows-at A-State.
Then there's Jerry Mollett, the fullback on that Shrine team. He'd
been set on going to CSC for years. Now the word from the south
is that Mollett is at Valley -IC, and isn't dreaming of going to the
institution of Troy.
Well, it makes us wonder what things are coming to down there.

All-Star time in basketball is here, and it was a pleasant surprise
to see Stanford's Paul Neumann make the first listing I've run
across. It's certainly not that I don't think Neumann is all-star qual
ity he'll be on my team 1 was just afraid that he'd get overlooked
because of playing on a non-contender.
Hut Al Lightner, a FCC cage ref and sports editor of the Oregon
Statesman, was impressed with Neumann and picked him on his club
along with Dave Gambee and Charlie Franklin at forward, Doug
Smart at center, and Gary Simmons at the other guard.
Spoke with Light ner a little over a week ago about his selection
of Neumann, and he said he ihought Paul played excellent ball when
he saw him lead the Indians over Oregon Slate.
Light ner was particularly enthused about the way Neumann kept
his mates calmed down whenever they showed signs of rushing
ahead too quickly. Certainly nothing anyone has seen of Neumann
in the last two weekends of play could cause any arguments that he
shouldn't be on any all-PCC fives.

All-Star time in basketball is here, and it was a pleasant surprise
to see Stanford's Paul Neumann make the first listing I've run
across. It's certainly not that I don't think Neumann is all-star qual
ity he'll be on my team 1 was just afraid that he'd get overlooked
because of playing on a non-contender.
Hut Al Lightner, a FCC cage ref and sports editor of the Oregon
Statesman, was impressed with Neumann and picked him on his club
along with Dave Gambee and Charlie Franklin at forward, Doug
Smart at center, and Gary Simmons at the other guard.
Spoke with Light ner a little over a week ago about his selection
of Neumann, and he said he ihought Paul played excellent ball when
he saw him lead the Indians over Oregon Slate.
Light ner was particularly enthused about the way Neumann kept
his mates calmed down whenever they showed signs of rushing
ahead too quickly. Certainly nothing anyone has seen of Neumann
in the last two weekends of play could cause any arguments that he
shouldn't be on any all-PCC fives.

throw out all ihe world record books and insert litis spring's ex

south lor their meets with USC and Oxy, what with all the southern
talent that figures to take all the places according to its coaches.
Here are a few qxcerpts from Coker comments as listed in Mux
Stiles' "Stiles in Sports" in the 1..A. .Mirror-News:
"Ty lludley, 880-mile. Unlimited possibilities for both Ty and
Dave Keisbord to better I minute*. It's only the mental barrier."
"Clarence Treat, hurdles-broad jump. The Llvis I'resley of the
track team. Look for under II flat in the high hurdles."
"Todd White, 880-mile. Kan 4:08.8 last year and will be another
man within peach ol I minutes. Has any school ever bad three
such runners as lladlcy, Keisbord and White?"
'Molin Zct/man, JJ'iO. Insists he will break 1 lie school record of
20.0 in the 'i'lo and I think lie will."
Well, enough for Coker (a Stanford grad, by the way) and his
predictions. Let's take a look at what .Mortensen is saying:
"I think ... I KNOW they'll be national champions." Jess was
speaking at a Trojan Track Alumni dinner when he made his great
hig flat prediction. lie might, at that, come plenty close to being
right if early season marks are any indication.
In workouts, Troy had Wayne Lemons clocked in a 3:01.1 1320,
and Wcs McLeod was in at 3:01.6. Add 31al Kobertson (3:04), Boh
Shankland (3:05) and Atis IVlerson (3:06), plus >lax Truex, the na

and ( liuck < oker talk, one would assume that he might just as well
throw out all ihe world record books and insert litis spring's ex
pected performances of the Trojans and Occidental Tigers. It al
most begins 1o look as though there's no point in Stanford going
south lor their meets with USC and Oxy, what with all the southern
talent that figures to take all the places according to its coaches.
Here are a few qxcerpts from Coker comments as listed in Mux
Stiles' "Stiles in Sports" in the 1..A. .Mirror-News:
"Ty lludley, 880-mile. Unlimited possibilities for both Ty and
Dave Keisbord to better I minute*. It's only the mental barrier."
"Clarence Treat, hurdles-broad jump. The Llvis I'resley of the
track team. Look for under II flat in the high hurdles."
"Todd White, 880-mile. Kan 4:08.8 last year and will be another
man within peach ol I minutes. Has any school ever bad three
such runners as lladlcy, Keisbord and White?"
'Molin Zct/man, JJ'iO. Insists he will break 1 lie school record of
20.0 in the 'i'lo and I think lie will."
Well, enough for Coker (a Stanford grad, by the way) and his
predictions. Let's take a look at what .Mortensen is saying:
"I think ... I KNOW they'll be national champions." Jess was
speaking at a Trojan Track Alumni dinner when he made his great
hig flat prediction. lie might, at that, come plenty close to being
right if early season marks are any indication.
In workouts, Troy had Wayne Lemons clocked in a 3:01.1 1320,
and Wcs McLeod was in at 3:01.6. Add 31al Kobertson (3:04), Boh
Shankland (3:05) and Atis IVlerson (3:06), plus >lax Truex, the na
tion's best long distance man, and it looks like USC is loaded in the
long races.
What's Happening at USC?
Remember back to the Slirine-Hi game of last fall? All the talk
was about the tremendous baekfield the South team had, and how
ii would tear everything to pieces. It didn't (lost to the North, 32-01
hut that didn't temper the enthusiasm at USC when it was learned
that the Trojans had made off with the three big names in that back
field.
Things are different now. Kandy .Meadows played his frosh ball
at Figueroa Tech, then pulled out for Long Beach City College. Now
he's headed for Arizona State.. The Trojans have put up a front of
low grades in saying that .Meadows couldn't make it anyhow, but it
sounds pretty weak. He had good high school marks, and besides,
when did grades keep anybody from playing there anyhow?
Meadows* running mate in that Shrine baekfield was Mickey
Flynn of Anaheim. He went to Long Beach last fall, averaged 7
yards a carry on a fair team, and was all set for Trojanville. He isn't
going there; he'll join Meadows-at A-State.
Then there's Jerry Mollett, the fullback on that Shrine team. He'd
been set on going to CSC for years. Now the word from the south
is that Mollett is at Valley -IC, and isn't dreaming of going to the
institution of Troy.
Well, it makes us wonder what things are coming to down there.

All-Star time in basketball is here, and it was a pleasant surprise
to see Stanford's Paul Neumann make the first listing I've run
across. It's certainly not that I don't think Neumann is all-star qual
ity he'll be on my team 1 was just afraid that he'd get overlooked
because of playing on a non-contender.
Hut Al Lightner, a FCC cage ref and sports editor of the Oregon
Statesman, was impressed with Neumann and picked him on his club
along with Dave Gambee and Charlie Franklin at forward, Doug
Smart at center, and Gary Simmons at the other guard.
Spoke with Light ner a little over a week ago about his selection
of Neumann, and he said he ihought Paul played excellent ball when
he saw him lead the Indians over Oregon Slate.
Light ner was particularly enthused about the way Neumann kept
his mates calmed down whenever they showed signs of rushing
ahead too quickly. Certainly nothing anyone has seen of Neumann
in the last two weekends of play could cause any arguments that he
shouldn't be on any all-PCC fives.
