Keed Highly Ranked
This match should be a real
test for the Stanford ace for Reed
is rated as one of this country's
best young players. Reed won
the San Joaquin Championship I
last week at Stockton by whip
ping Chris Crawford, and shortly
j before that he was the winner at
the Palm Desert tourney in Palm ;
! Springs.
The rest of the Stanford squad ;
should have a rougher time than I
j they had. planned on as all the
I San Jose players will bo moved
1 down a notch to make room for;
Reed.
Coach Renker has not made i
any definite selection of positions
for tomorrow's match. The play- j
ers probably will come from j
among ihe five varsity members
besides Douglas who played in !
the Northern California tourna-j
ment: Robin Hilgeman, Jim Jef
j fries. Lowell Carruth, Oil White |
and Dave Nelson.
Rawlins Hack
Stanford will pick up some add
! or] strength for the match in the
j return of Brooks Rawlins. Raw
lins, one of Stanford's best net
tors. has been out with a slight
! case of mononucleosis but will be
ready for action in today's match.
As a result of Stanford-San
Jose matches in the Northern
i California tourney the Indians ap
i pear to be heavy favorites today.
