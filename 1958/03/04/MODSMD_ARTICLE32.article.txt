# Capers Rest; Face Ducks in Season Final
## 
### 
Rest is the reward for good per
formances. and that's just what 1
Howie Dallmar is giving his Stan
ford Indians following their pair
of top-flight showings last week
end.
The Cards took yesterday off
and won't work today either. To
morrow they'll swing back into |
action in preparation for the sea
son-closer against Oregon Satur
day night in the Pavilion.
So far as the Indians are con-1
reined, the PCC season is ending
just at the wrong time. After a
rocky loop start, the Cards have
come on strong in recent weeks,
winning their last three in a row
over USC. Idaho and UCLA.
Stanford has now pulled its rec
ord in league action up to a re
spectable 6-9, good for sixth place.
If Washington can beat the Tro
jans. and the Cards whip Oregon,
the locals will finish in a tie for
fifth about three places higher
than anticipated at season's start.
The chances for Stanford beat
ing the Ducks are "rosy," accord
ing to Dallmar. Oregon whipped
the Indians in Eugene. 61-49, last
month, but Stanford was playing
its third game in four nights and
was beginning to feel the strain
of travel.
Charley Franklin led the Ducks'
victory and he'll again be the big !
problem for Stanford.
