season against USF in the Sunken Diamond.
Coach Dutch I clu ing has also named George Avery and Bob Leo
pold to share the hili duties with Williams. Each will twirl for three

innings.
The Dons should furnish inter
esting competition for Stanford,
if their 1-2 victory over Santa
Clara on Sunday is any indica
tion. USF got eight hits in that
game as Ray Jourdanais pitched
them to the win.
The Cards, who have allowed
three opponents a total of just
five runs, will be out to maintain
their so far unblemished record.
An alumni nine. San Jose State
and Cal Poly have fallen vii titns
to stout Stanford pitching and
heavy-hitting Indian bats.
Fohring has decided to use prac
tically the same lineup that wont
to bat against Cal Poly here Sat
urday. The only changes will see
Ralph Molding in place of Art
von Wronski behind the plate and
Williams on the mound.
The Lineup
The Indians will line up with
Wayne Marion at shortstop, A1
Shaw 2b, Ben Robinson of, Parker
Olson If, Rich DeFabio rf, Holding
c, Joel Newkirk lb, Jim Burk 3b
and the pitchers.
Robinson, who started I ho sea
son batting No. (i. moved up to
the 3rd -spot after a day of power
hitting against San Joso.
Robinson cracked a home run
over ihe left-field wall at the
Sunken Diamond and smashed a
440-foot triple to the base of the
left-center barrier.
Five ltltl's
He batted in four of the Cards'
eighl runs last Friday and added
another RBI Saturday, although
he didn't get any hits in two of
ficial trips.
Starting hurler Williams had
control trouble against San Jose
in his three-inning stint as a pair
of walks cost him two runs. But
he bore down well in other spots
to st i ike out five men.
Scattered FSits
Avery was nicked for three hits
by Cal Poly, but kept them spaced
well enough so that 1 hey cost him
just one run.
Leopold will be out to extend
his hillcss skein of innings to
nine. The first six came Friday,
when the Spartans couldn't get
much more than a loud foul off
the fast - balling Stanford south
paw. San Joso. in fact, could get
just three balls out of the infield
against Leopold.
