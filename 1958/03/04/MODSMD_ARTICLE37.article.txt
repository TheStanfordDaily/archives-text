FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE
Tlio firs! thought that comes into our minds upon entering
college is. of course, marriage. Put liow many of us go a hoi it,
seeking mates, as I like In call t Item, in a truly scientific mariner?
Not, many, you may lie sure.
So let II- today make a scientific survey of tlie two principal
causes of marriage personality need and propinquity.
Personality need means that we choose mates because they
possess certain finalities that complete and fulfill our own per
sonalities. Take, for example, the case of Alanson Duck.
As a freshman Alanson made a fine scholastic record, played
varsity scrabble, and was president of hi-~ class. One would
think that Alanson was a totally fulfilled man. Hut he was not.
There was something lacking in his life, something vague and
indefinable that was needed to make his personality complete.
Then one day Alanson discovered what it was. As he was
walking out of his class in Flemish pottery, a fetching coed
named < irace Lk offered him a handsome red and white pack
and said, "Marlboro?"
''Yes!" he cried, for all at once he knew what he had been
needing to round out his personality the hearty fulfillment of
Marlboro Cigarettes, the soul-repairing mildness of their fine
tobacco, tin cn.si/ draw of their vnpnralhh<l Jiltci', the ease and
convenience of their crush proof flip-top box. es, I will take a
Marlboro!" cried Alanson. "And 1 will also take you to wife
if you will have me!"
"I,a !" she exclaimed, throwing her apron over her face. Hut
after a while she removed it and they were married. Today
they live happily in Baffin Land where Alanson is with an
otter-glazing firm and (irace is a bookie.
Propinquity, the second principal cause of marriage, simply
means closeness. Put a boy and a girl close together for a sus
tained period <>112 time and their proximity will certainly ripen
into love and their love into marriage. A perfect example is
the case of I'afnir Sigal'oos.
While a freshman at Louisiana State University, Fafnir was
required t<> crawl throii'di the Pig Inch pipeline part of his
fraternity initiation, lie entered the pipe at Baton Poiige and,
alone and joyless, he proceeded to crawl north.
As lie passed Lafayette, Indiana, he was agreeably surprised
to be joined by a comely gill named Mary Alice Isinglass, a
Purdue freshman, who, oddly enough, had to crawl through
the Pig Inch as part of her sorority initiation.

Chatting amiably as they crawled through Ohio, Pennsyl
vania, and New York State, I'afnir :ind Mary Alice discovered
they had much in common like ;i mutual aflVction for licorice,
bobsledding, and the nonsense verse of Arnold Toynbee. When
they reached the Vermont border they were going steady, and
when they emerged from the pipe at Hoothbay Harbor, Maine,
they were engaged.
After a good hot bath they were married and today they live
in Klamath Falls, Oregon, where I'afnir is in the weights and
measures department and Marv Alice is in the roofing game.
They have three children, all named Norman. ■ r>-.« Mmshutmn.
