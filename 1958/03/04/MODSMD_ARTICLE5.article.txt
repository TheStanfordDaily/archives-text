# Folk Songs Scheduled For Series
## 
### 
"Folk Songs with Sam Hinton"
in Memorial Auditorium at 7:30
tonight will conclude the winter
series of free Tuesday Evening
lectures.
Many of the songs in his reper
toire were learned from the Ne
gro farmers of the swamp coun
try while he was a young boy
growing up in the small towns of
East Texas.
Vaudeville Tour
Hinton left Texas A&M in 1937
to become a member of Major
Bowes' touring vaudeville unit as
a folk singer and novelty instru
mentalist.
After appearing in 46 states
and Canada, he left the unit in
Los Angeles to attend UCLA.
While there, he performed with
the cast of the Hollywood revue,
"Meet the People."
Versatile Hinton teaches folk
mus i c at Idyllwild, extension
courses in biology at UC, writes
children's books ("Exploring Un
der the Sca">, and records for
Decca.
Private Life
In private life, Ilinton is a zo
ology graduate of UCLA and is
now curator of the aquarium-mu
seum at the Seripps Institution of
Oceanography at La Jolla.
Of folk songs, he says, "They
can provide us with an important
link to the past, and help us feel
that we, personally, are a part of
humanity's history.
"By no stretch of the imagina
tion can a folk singer be authen
tic. I try to preserve the spirit
if not the letter of the song."
Tonight's event is being spon
sored by the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises. The series will re
sume in April.
