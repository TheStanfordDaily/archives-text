# Folk Singer Makes Hit With Audience
## 
### Jinx Adams 
Sam Ilinton, folk singer, opened
his Tuesday Evening Scries per
formance last night by encourag
ing his audience to join in the
whistling chorus of his first song.
He continued his program with
Irish folksongs depicting pagan
pre-Christian ceremonies. From
Ireland and England, Hinton took
his program of music to America
where, with songs such as "The
Farmer and the Crow," "Hole in
the Bucket" and "Johnny Sands,"
he demonstrated America's con
tribution to the folk music field.
An enthusiastic audience com
posed of students, adults and an
unusually large number of chil
dren called Hinton back after his
last number for an encore of
"The Talking Atomic Blues," a
rather biting little ditty. This was
the hit of the evening.
Hinton, presently curator of
the aquarium â€¢ museum at the
Scripps Institute of Oceanogra
phy at La Jolla, included among
his American songs a city folk
song on temperance, blues songs,
mountain songs, Negro work
songs and a cowboy song. He
ended his entertaining program
with a contemporary folksong,
which he uses to inform visitors
at the aquarium that it is closing
time, "Aquarium Closing Time
Holler."
