Men's Council.)
On tho surface, the referendum to change the ASSU bylaws re
garding Judicial Council appears to be a good deal. But if you stop
and consider the consequences of the change, you will see how much
harm it would bring to the present system.
It appears that the initiator of the referendum has cleverly sur
rounded the important change, part B, with two statements already
incorporated in the Judicial Rules of Procedure. Let's therefore con
sider how the system would function with the new changes.
Interpreting part B of the referendum, we see that the accused
shall have the right to face his accuser and have a public trial. A
public trial would he easier on the council and a good deal if ALL
trials were public; but this is not the case, for the defendant has tho
option of requesting a public trial.
Wouldn't Be Questioned
If the student body were able to see the whole story, in many
cases the validity of witnesses' testimonies and the judgments of the
council would not be questioned as they seem to be now.
But remember —the defendant still can have a closed trial and
still face his accuser. If the person were innocent, the misunder
standing could be quickly cleared up as it is done now.
If the person were guilty, the facts of the case would reach the
student body only through the story of the defendant—which could
be distorted to such a degree that it looked like he was innocent. His
friends would then hold a great deal of bitterness against the accuser
and bring to bear a great deal of social pressure.
Possible Retaliation
With this fact in mind—that the whole story will be told to the
student body in some cases and not in others, and that an accuser is
letting himself in for possible retaliation from friends of a guilty,
bitter defendant because of distorted information—do you, the stu
dents, want to protect cheaters in this manner?
If this referendum passes, the number of cases turned in by stu
dents will probably drop off considerably due to fear of retaliation
by misinformed students. There have been a number oX cases in the
past few years where accusers have been threatened with physical
harm and been socially ostracized to the extent that they had to
leave school.
Why have an Honor Code if you can be snubbed and looked down
upon for doing your best to preserve the system?
Intention of Referendum
The intention of the referendum is to insure the innocent that no
miscarriage of justice is carried out. Now, ALL evidence presented
by the accuscr is written down and presented to the defendant for
rebuttal.
From almost a year's experience on the council, I have observer!
that the innocent do not have trouble explaining suspicious actions,
and in these cases acquittals are arrived at quickly. By facing the
accused with his accuser no more information will be gathered; only
emotions will be brought to a head, and the facts buried within the
emotions.
The last clause in part B—a defendant shall not be compelled to
testify against himself —is in direct opposition to the honor system
as it is set up. Because the council's main objective is rehabilitation,
it is desirous for Honor Code violators to "get it off their chest," so
to speak.
If Person Realizes Mistake
If a person realizes his mistake and admits his guilt, suspensions
are very rarely given. It is those who try to hide their cheating that
the council must deal with sternly.
By testifying, an innocent person is merely stating his side of the
story and is, in essence, testifying in his own behalf. If a person
refuses to testify, the council has only one side of the story and would
have to make its decision solely on tho one-sided evidence. It is there
fore to the advantage of the defendant to tell the truth, whether he
is innocent or guilty.
Here is where the correlation between our system and the system
of the law courts breaks down. In our system the penalty fits the
attitude of the violator, whereas in the law courts the penalty fits
the crime.
By voting against this referendum you will be maintaining a
system that has proved quite workable and fair, and that DOES
protect the best interests of the innocent.
By voting for this change you will be making cheating easier to
get away with and will be doing no more for the innocent than is
done now.

Here is where the correlation between our system and the system

On tho surface, the referendum to change the ASSU bylaws re
garding Judicial Council appears to be a good deal. But if you stop
and consider the consequences of the change, you will see how much
harm it would bring to the present system.
It appears that the initiator of the referendum has cleverly sur
rounded the important change, part B, with two statements already
incorporated in the Judicial Rules of Procedure. Let's therefore con
sider how the system would function with the new changes.
Interpreting part B of the referendum, we see that the accused
shall have the right to face his accuser and have a public trial. A
public trial would he easier on the council and a good deal if ALL
trials were public; but this is not the case, for the defendant has tho
option of requesting a public trial.
Wouldn't Be Questioned
If the student body were able to see the whole story, in many
cases the validity of witnesses' testimonies and the judgments of the
council would not be questioned as they seem to be now.
But remember —the defendant still can have a closed trial and
still face his accuser. If the person were innocent, the misunder
standing could be quickly cleared up as it is done now.
If the person were guilty, the facts of the case would reach the
student body only through the story of the defendant—which could
be distorted to such a degree that it looked like he was innocent. His
friends would then hold a great deal of bitterness against the accuser
and bring to bear a great deal of social pressure.
Possible Retaliation
With this fact in mind—that the whole story will be told to the
student body in some cases and not in others, and that an accuser is
letting himself in for possible retaliation from friends of a guilty,
bitter defendant because of distorted information—do you, the stu
dents, want to protect cheaters in this manner?
If this referendum passes, the number of cases turned in by stu
dents will probably drop off considerably due to fear of retaliation
by misinformed students. There have been a number oX cases in the
past few years where accusers have been threatened with physical
harm and been socially ostracized to the extent that they had to
leave school.
Why have an Honor Code if you can be snubbed and looked down
upon for doing your best to preserve the system?
Intention of Referendum
The intention of the referendum is to insure the innocent that no
miscarriage of justice is carried out. Now, ALL evidence presented
by the accuscr is written down and presented to the defendant for
rebuttal.
From almost a year's experience on the council, I have observer!
that the innocent do not have trouble explaining suspicious actions,
and in these cases acquittals are arrived at quickly. By facing the
accused with his accuser no more information will be gathered; only
emotions will be brought to a head, and the facts buried within the
emotions.
The last clause in part B—a defendant shall not be compelled to
testify against himself —is in direct opposition to the honor system
as it is set up. Because the council's main objective is rehabilitation,
it is desirous for Honor Code violators to "get it off their chest," so
to speak.
If Person Realizes Mistake
If a person realizes his mistake and admits his guilt, suspensions
are very rarely given. It is those who try to hide their cheating that
the council must deal with sternly.
By testifying, an innocent person is merely stating his side of the
story and is, in essence, testifying in his own behalf. If a person
refuses to testify, the council has only one side of the story and would
have to make its decision solely on tho one-sided evidence. It is there
fore to the advantage of the defendant to tell the truth, whether he
is innocent or guilty.
Here is where the correlation between our system and the system
of the law courts breaks down. In our system the penalty fits the
attitude of the violator, whereas in the law courts the penalty fits

If a person realizes his mistake and admits his guilt, suspensions
are very rarely given. It is those who try to hide their cheating that
the council must deal with sternly.
By testifying, an innocent person is merely stating his side of the
story and is, in essence, testifying in his own behalf. If a person
refuses to testify, the council has only one side of the story and would
have to make its decision solely on tho one-sided evidence. It is there
fore to the advantage of the defendant to tell the truth, whether he
is innocent or guilty.
Here is where the correlation between our system and the system
of the law courts breaks down. In our system the penalty fits the
attitude of the violator, whereas in the law courts the penalty fits
the crime.
By voting against this referendum you will be maintaining a
system that has proved quite workable and fair, and that DOES
protect the best interests of the innocent.
By voting for this change you will be making cheating easier to
get away with and will be doing no more for the innocent than is
done now.
(Editor's Note: Gordon Tinker is the present chairman of
Men's Council.)
On tho surface, the referendum to change the ASSU bylaws re
garding Judicial Council appears to be a good deal. But if you stop
and consider the consequences of the change, you will see how much
harm it would bring to the present system.
It appears that the initiator of the referendum has cleverly sur
rounded the important change, part B, with two statements already
incorporated in the Judicial Rules of Procedure. Let's therefore con
sider how the system would function with the new changes.
Interpreting part B of the referendum, we see that the accused
shall have the right to face his accuser and have a public trial. A
public trial would he easier on the council and a good deal if ALL
trials were public; but this is not the case, for the defendant has tho
option of requesting a public trial.
Wouldn't Be Questioned
If the student body were able to see the whole story, in many
cases the validity of witnesses' testimonies and the judgments of the
council would not be questioned as they seem to be now.
But remember —the defendant still can have a closed trial and
still face his accuser. If the person were innocent, the misunder
standing could be quickly cleared up as it is done now.
If the person were guilty, the facts of the case would reach the
student body only through the story of the defendant—which could
be distorted to such a degree that it looked like he was innocent. His
friends would then hold a great deal of bitterness against the accuser
and bring to bear a great deal of social pressure.
Possible Retaliation
With this fact in mind—that the whole story will be told to the
student body in some cases and not in others, and that an accuser is
letting himself in for possible retaliation from friends of a guilty,
bitter defendant because of distorted information—do you, the stu
dents, want to protect cheaters in this manner?
If this referendum passes, the number of cases turned in by stu
dents will probably drop off considerably due to fear of retaliation
by misinformed students. There have been a number oX cases in the
past few years where accusers have been threatened with physical
harm and been socially ostracized to the extent that they had to
leave school.
Why have an Honor Code if you can be snubbed and looked down
upon for doing your best to preserve the system?
Intention of Referendum
The intention of the referendum is to insure the innocent that no
miscarriage of justice is carried out. Now, ALL evidence presented
by the accuscr is written down and presented to the defendant for
rebuttal.
From almost a year's experience on the council, I have observer!
that the innocent do not have trouble explaining suspicious actions,
and in these cases acquittals are arrived at quickly. By facing the
accused with his accuser no more information will be gathered; only
emotions will be brought to a head, and the facts buried within the
emotions.
The last clause in part B—a defendant shall not be compelled to
testify against himself —is in direct opposition to the honor system
as it is set up. Because the council's main objective is rehabilitation,
it is desirous for Honor Code violators to "get it off their chest," so
to speak.
