## Keio Scholar From Stanford Describes His Life in Tokyo 
### Steve Freidberg 
"About the most general thing
that comes to mind is the fact that
you will bo a guest—a guest witli
the whole country as your host."
These are the sentiments of By
ron Marshall, this year's Keio
scholar in Japan, which lie ex
pressed in a letter to the Keio
Committee here. Marshall i« now
studying at Keio University and
will return in June.
"Budd," as his friends call him,
wrote to encourage prospective
candidates for the 19.15-59 scholar
ship and to let them know a littlo
about his experiences.
The selection of next, year's
scholar will be made shortly, and
applications, which are available
at the ASSU office, must be turn
ed in by noon Friday.
"Although it is difficult to ex
press it in writing, there is also
the mixture of traditional color,
modification of European and
American customs, and an inter
national cosmopolitism | sic J that
make just living in Tokyo a lath
er rare experience," he wrote.
Emphasis is far less on the
classroom at Keio than on the re
quired reading, according to
Budd. Class discussion and ques
tions are mainly delegated to the
seminar.
The Keio Scholarship is an ex

change program sponsored by the
ASSU; tuition, room and board,
and minor living expenses are
provided. Anyone wishing addi
tional information may call Ayako
Omura at Roble after 7 p.m.
