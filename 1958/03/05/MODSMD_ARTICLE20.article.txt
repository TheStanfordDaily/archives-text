Effects of Puhlic Trial
Editor, The Daily:
Something constructive has finally come out
of this mess about judicial procedure. The ref
erendum being voted on (today 1 has some really
sound ideas. Specific charges, in writing and in
advance, should have been a part of the procedure
long ago. Certainly, no defendant ever should
have been denied the right to have assistance in
his defense.
I have no doubts that both of those proposals
hold the hearty approval of LASSU, Judicial
Council, and the like; they will no doubt !>e passed
individually even if the referendum is defeated,
lint we are now asked to vote on the whole pack
age deal; just as LASSU did in vetoing it. And
the issue of granting the right of public trial
disturbs me. The civil courts have il; is there
any reason why we shouldn't? Is our particular
campus situation different? Perhaps there are
reasons for maintaining our present system of
private trial. I advance the following ideas as a
result of my observations from a quarter's ex
perience on Men's Council:
Basically, there arc two types of people who
commit Honor Code violations. One is he who
would normally uphold the Honor Code, but be
comes panicked on a test and cheats for fear of
a bad grade. The other is he who deliberately
cheats. The latter type is the one who takes
advantage of the impersonal nature of a large
group such as our student body and considers it
personally acceptable to cheat at the group's ex
pense. Let us consider the effect of a public trial,
at the defendant's request, on each of these de
fendants.
The important issue is not the protection of
the accused. In any trial, public or private, the
defendant is given all benefit of the doubt in
cases of conflicting testimony. He is convicted
only when the council is positive of guilt. These
provisions are •subject to one limitation—human
mistakes by the council. The council made a mis
take in the handling of one case autumn quarter;
they were well aware of this long before it was
brought to The Daily's attention, and corrected
their procedure accordingly.
The important issue involved is protection of
the accuser. The type of person who violated in
panic will have no desire for public trial and
exposure of the accuser's name. 1-Ie will be aware
of his mistake and accept his punishment as such.
The other type of defendant has quite a different
attitude. He is openly bitter at being caught, and
naturally directs his feeling toward the accuser
directly or indirectly (in a private trial this
may be done by spreading the accuser's name
and distorting the facts of the trial).
How many people would even consider report
ing a violation if they knew their name would
be displayed before the student body? And why,
you ask, in either case should a person be em
barrassed for upholding an honor system? It is
simply because it is considered socially unaccept
able to turn a person in (or call it what you like).
No matter what the reason for this, ihe fact
remains that it is true.
We don't want a society founded on mutual
distrust—one which lets a few take advantage
of the group's impersonal nature at the expense
of its members. Thus, we devise a method to

TRY to restrain those who do so. The measure
of the value of the system chosen is its effective
ness. Wo now have one which places the respon
sibility for enforcement on the individual. In
operation it does restrain a few of the undesirable
type described. It has its weaknesses, admittedly;
but we are only decreasing its effectiveness, as
has been mentioned, if we allow the accused to
face his accuser, either in private or in public.
Others have considered the proposed referen
dum as a unit and investigated it thoroughly;
they have decided against the referendum as a
whole, as is evidenced by the Legislature's 16-to-l
veto.
However, the bulk of the student body will do
one of three things: they will be swayed by the
idealistic but unrealistic cries for public trial;
ihey will approve the package deal, mindful chief
ly of its good points; or they will consider the
issue too confusing to vote at all. Take a few
minutes and think carefully about the effects of
public trial, on yourself and on others. If we
want to modify our existing system, let's be con
structive, not destructive.

Scratch Sheet 6 Smug, Subjective'
Editor, The Daily:
If the surreptitious purpose of "The Scratch
Sheet" was to stir up ihe indifferent mob, then
this letter will be taken as evidence of success.
A blow has been struck for ihe great cause of
intellectual climatology. Bravo!
But if ihe intent is indicated in the quotation
from Dante which prefaced the "Sheet" (surely a
joke!), then we are indignant rather than amused.
The publication as it stands is an insult to both
students and faculty. The lone is smug and the
judgments mostly inane. If these students wish
10 engage in further freedom of expression, they
should realize that a judgment without a signa
ture is mere presumption. In future editions of
The Scratch Sheet, students who wish to have
their opinions published should be responsible
enough to sign each evaluation. We would enjoy
the opportunity lo subjectively judge the subjec
tive judges.

P.S. — The Daily's suggestion that we rate
courses by majority opinion is absurd. Demo
cratic action is not a device for the control of the
intellect.
No one is trying to control anyone's Intellect
—unless it's those seeking to suppress The
Scratch Sheet. Our suggestion to circulate
questionnaires was offered merely because we
feel popular sentiment would be an interesting
supplement to subjective evaluation of a course.

Oscar W ilde's Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
It would be interesting to know what the re
action of Oscar (accuse me of anything, but—
please- not of being dull) Wilde would have been
to the "Dull, Silent and Afraid" letter by Mr.
"Name Withheld." Somehow I feel that his re
action would have been . . . how dull!
