# Rebounding Key Factor In Oregon Tilt Saturday
## 
### 
Rebounding once again figures to be the decisive factor for Stan-
I ford's basket bailers, this time when they play Oregon in the season
I finale here Saturday.
But whereas the Indians didn't do too effective a job of solving this
problem in early-season games, the last two weekends of play have

seen Stanford periormrng etiec
tively on the boards and winning
a few games as a result.
Coach Howie Dallmar thinks
Stanford's rebounding against
the Ducks figures to be better j
than it was last time, when the j
Oregonians won a 01-49 decision I
in Eugene.
Stanford Problems
In that game, Hal Duffy and
Charlie Franklin were the big
thorns in ihe Stanford side, both
i point - wise and on the boards.
! Dallmar said yesterday that he'd
| again assign captain Paul Neii-
I mann the task of guarding Fran- j
klin and Dick Haga the job of j
controlling Duffy.
"Paul did well on Franklin up
there," said Dallmar.- "But then
I he picked up four fouls and we j
had to take him off Franklin and !
so he started to run wild against j
| us."
The rest of Ihe Indian defen-!
I sive alignment will see Jerry
Thuesen guarding the Ducks'
classy forward, Dale Ilerron.
John Arrillaga and Doug Warren
will draw the back-court assign
! ment against" Chuck Rask and
Bub Kuykendall.
Tipton Back
The only'lndian who might noli
! be in top shape for the game is |
guard Mike Tipton. He didn't ;
! work out at all last week because i
of right elbow trouble, and didn't i
! see any action against Idaho or ,
| UCLA here last weekend.
Dallmar is optimistic, however,;
and said he expects to give Tip-;
ton a good amount of action this
weekend. Dallmar said, however,
that Tipton will probably substi
tute on an individual basis in the |
first unit rather than joining the
second team for unit substitution, i
Second Unit Set
Dallmar reasoned that Ihe sec-j
ond unit as it now stands Neal
j Brockmeyer, Chris Bur-ford, John
Pflueger, John Stabler, Jerry I
Rose has worked together well
the past two weeks, and it might
do more harm than good to shuf- j
fie the alignment around at this |
point.
