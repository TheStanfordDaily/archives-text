## 
### 
Thomas Cordry III was indicted
by the Santa Clara County grand

first • degree murder charge for
the "urge" slaying of 17-year-old
Deena Bonn.
Only two witnesses- Sgt. O. V.
Niehus of Palo Alto, the desk ser
geant who was on duty the night
Cordry turned himself in, and
Capt. William Salt of the sheriff's
office—were called by the district
attorney to testify. Neither Cor
