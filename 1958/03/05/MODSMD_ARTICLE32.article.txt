# SATURDAY TRIANGULAR
## San Jose, Youth Village Here for Spike Opener 
### 
San Joso Slate and the Santa ;
Clara County Youlh Village will;
help Stanford launch its 1058
track and field season here Sat
urday in a triangular moot at
1:30 p.m. The Stanford frosh will
beat their varsity mates to the
start with a 10 a.m. meet Satur-1
day against College of San Ma
teo and Stockton JC.
The opening varsity meet is
termed by Coach Pay ton Jordan
as one of tho finest opening
meets ever held in Northern Cal
ifornia.
Olympians and holders of some i
of the world's top marks in 1057
will lie featured in what promises
to be a close battle scoring-wise. I
Four-Minute Miler
Laszlo Tabori, a member of the
1956 Hungarian Olympic team
and the select four-minute mile
list, will be the featured SCCYV I
performer.
Tabori came to this country;
following the Australian Olym
pics, but had language and pub
lic relations difficulties his first |
season here. This year, however, j
he decided to settle in this area;
and appears ready for an out
standing season.
Although a premier miler, he's
perhaps even better at the longer
distances; lie's a former world
record holder in the 5000 meters.
The SCCYV is strong in the
field with high-jumper Herm Wy
att and U.S. Olympic pole-vaulter
George Mattos. Jim Lea, former
USC runner and present world
record holder in the 440 with a
mark of 45.8, is presently in the,
midst of a comeback campaign,

so should help his team in the
220-110 area.
San .lose coach Bud Winter has
been moaning about injuries and
eligibility rulings, but still fig
ures to send a good team up for
the meet.
Sprinter Ray Norton, a 0.4
man last spring, leads the San
Jose parade. Rut probably the
strongest area for the Spartans
will be the distances, where they
have the men who made up a
highly successful cross-country
team. Wes Bond and Grady Neal
figure to give Tabori and the In
dian distance crew a good run.
Spartan Threat
Chuck Hightower, a 14-8 vault
er, will probably miss the meet
because of rib and ankle injuries.
The Spartans still have strength
here, however, with national JC
record - holder Stan Hopkins, a
transfer from Orange Coast JC.
In the hurdles, Stanford's
Chuck Cobb should get a fair
test from Clint Redus, the Spar
tans' outstanding barrier man.
Stanford entries will be posted
definitely today by Jordan as the
Indians begin to taper off in
preparation for the opener.
One added event will be held
Saturday a four-man 440 relay.
Stanford will be attempting to
post a time good enough to qual
ify a team for the Texas Relays
March 28-29 at Austin.
