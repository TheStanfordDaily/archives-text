# What's it like to be with IBM?
## 
### 
"When I joined IBM," says Mary Bayer, "some of my
friends at college wondered how I would manage a
career in a field as technical as they thought this would
he. I was a history major—and here I was entering the
electronics field!"
Today, a System Service Representative for IBM,
Mary Bayer is an important part of the sales organiza
t ion. I n less than two years, she has assumed an unusual
and challenging responsibility. Before and after the
installation of an IB M machine system, she assists hot h
salesmen and customer personnel—assembling infor
mation, writing proposals, teachingmachineoperat ions,
and setting up procedures to handle specific customer
business problems.
"What impressed me most about this job, as it was
described to me at Campus Interviews, was the variety

of the work I would be
doing as a System Serv
ice Representative. T
didn't want to be tied
down to routine office
work, and I didn't want
a secretarial position. As
I had not been techni
cally trained, other com
panies would not offer
me any kind of a job
which involved initiative
and responsibility. IBM
was not only willing to
train me but offered a

wide variety of business experience—and at a good
.starting salary."

Receives extensive training
Mary Bayer first received 16 weeks' training in Ma
chine School at the Company's New York City Edu
cation Center. Here she learned the basic principles of
calculators and accounting machines—the same princi
ples that are used in the most advanced electronic
computers. Following her training in Machine School,
she attended Application School in Endicott, N. Y.
This she describes as "a kind of finishing school for
System Service Representatives. You learn how to
apply IBM systems to a variety of business and ac
counting procedures such as inventory control, accounts
receivables, payroll and many others. Our courses were
conducted by excellent instructors with many years
of field experience."
Learns about many businesses
In less than six months as a System Service Representa
tive, she had worked w ith an impressive list of custom era.

System Service Representative Mary Bayer, like
many otht-r graduates, came to IBM directly from
college. Here this Bryn Mawr '56 graduate tt-llw you
about an exciting new career for college women in the
rapidly expanding field of electronic business machines.

"One of the wonderful aspects of this job is the oppor
tunity to learn about many different businesses. For

instance, you may spend
a week in a bank, another
with an oil company, a
few days with a tele
vision firm — perhaps a
half-dozen different in
dustries, all in a month's
time. And you meet and
work with everybody
from the treasurer to the
bookkeeper . . . from
vice-presidents to ma
chine operators.

"Mv future? It's virtually unlimited. Right now I'm
scheduled for advanced training on IBM's famous

RAMAC'f Data Proc
essing System. This is es
sentially an extension of
my present type of work.
Rut advancement is also
possible in the field of
management — such as
becoming Manager of
Sales Assistance in any
one of IBM's 189 branch
offices. All in all, I can't
visualize a more reward
ing, challenging or fas
cinating career for a col
lege graduate!"
