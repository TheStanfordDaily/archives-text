Council bylaws amendment.)
You will have the chance to vote today on the Judicial Council
petition. All of us have done our best to present our sides to you;
now it is your baby, to do with as you wish.
Whether you want to face it or not, any one of you may come
some day before the Judicial Council, accused by someone you cannot
face or question, in a trial you do not even have the right to let your
friends see.
Is your accuser biased against you? Could you resolve the ques
tion much easier if you could question him before the council?
Wouldn't you want the rights not the requirements, just the rights
of having an open trial and being able to question your accuser?
I think you would.
Persecution
And as to persecution 1 hope you agree yiat if we are so childish
I hat we permit this kind of thing to go on here, and so irresponsible
that we can't nip it in the bud. we don't desei-ve the privileges of an
honor system. If the positive weight of student opinion is against
persecution, I maintain that it will rarely start —and quickly cease
if it does start.
To the accusation that much of the petition is superfluous, I reply
that, up to this time, the council had been operating under a code of
procedure which had never been approved by the Legislature, though
the constitution said it had to be; that written charges never HAD to
be presented, which is a right that adopting this petition will insure;
that until this petition is adopted, a defendant has only the right to
request, not to demand, that the council issue subpoenas to those
who may be in a position to help him defend himself.
Fear of Ridicule
To the fear that the accuser will be subjected to ridicule in an
open trial if his evidence is blatantly insufficient to convict anyone
of anything, I simply say that he should have had guts enough to
check with the person he suspected, in the first place, and that if the
council had thought the evidence so obviously insufficient, it would
never have held a trial.
To the fear that an open trial would put a blot on someone's
record, I would point out that he is not obligated to have an open
trial—it is merely his right to have one if he wants one. An open
trial would also clear a person publicly and save him from much
whispering if the fact of his trial ever got out later on. I think that
students here are mature enough to make up their own minds as to
what they want.
Make It More Careful
Bringing the Judicial Council out from behind its clouds of secrecy
would tend to make it, and all future councils, a little more careful.
It would make it much easier for the defendant to draft an appeal,
because he would know far better what there was against him. It
would, I think, keep the council from making careless errors such
as those it has recently been accused of making.
Moreover, please remember that (hese changes can be reversed
by the Legislature, if it proves necessary to do so; they are not
permanent. I feel that they should be given a chance to prove their
worth to guarantee the rights of the defendant and to further insure
that no innocent person will ever be convicted.
They say none ever has been—but how do they know? And how
can we know, either? I ask you to adopt this petition to guarantee
your own rights.
No, you don't have to vote. But if you don't—be sure not to com
plain if you ever come up before the council and are faced with their
present procedures; you had your chance.
