# Thomas Tells Peace Plans
## Speaker Offers Choice: Negotiate or Else War! 
### Leo Krulitz 
Norman Thomas gave his audience a choice: "Take constructive
fear in lime and negotiate a complete and universal disarmament
through a strengthened United Nations or else war!"
Speaking not on socialism but on what lie described as "the most
important subject today the preservation of peace," Thomas dra-

matically described the situation
in "this mad world" and presented
his proposals for peace to an au
dience that overflowed Cubberley
Auditorium.
Thomas suggested I hat today
we are faced with a situation un
like any other in history one
where "no military victory is |»<»s-
-sible." lie lashed out at the con
tinuation of nuclear tests, staling
that enough radiation has been
put into the atmosphere to kill
r»(),()()() people. lie added, "The
longer the tests are continued, the
greater is the danger for war and
eonlaminat ion."
Cites liases
Describing the things that
threaten the present order of Ihe
world, Thomas cited our bases
tlicit ring Russia as a cause of in
security to the people who must
live with Ihem.
He also suggested the possibil
ity that someone mighl make a
mistake and lose his head, plung
ing us into World War 111. He
said: "Military officers have so
much power. Power of retaliation
must be taken at once; it can't be
dictated by Washington or Russia.
"War doesn't depend on bad or
good men at the top of govern
ments, but it depends on actions
of hund r e d s of anonymous
people."
The Answer
He gave the answer to this
tense world situation as a "uni
versal and complete disarmament
that would require a police force
of the United Nations; a disarma
ment that would have to recognize
that Chiang Kai-shek is not the
leader of China."
Answering the charge that we
can't trust Russia, Thomas wittily
suggested: "If I were an Ameri
can Indian I'd ask: could we trust
us? I'm not an American Indian,
and I know our principles." He
continued: "It's hard to trust
them [the Russians] —but what
are you going to do?
"There is no military policy that
will give security! Aren't you
even going to TRY to find out
what they mean when they make
an offer toward disarmament?
What right have you to say that
things don't change in Russia, or
that the wickedest men don't want
to live? At least you could die
happier if you would try to live."
Universal Disarmament
He suggested working for uni
versal disarmament step by step
He concluded, "It is our impera
tive duty to negotiate as we never
have before for disarmament, so
we might take the earth with its
resources and beauties and use il
for life, not death."
