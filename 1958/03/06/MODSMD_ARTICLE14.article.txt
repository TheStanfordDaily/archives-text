# Fate of Explorer II Unknown; Scientists Fail to Make Contact
## Satellite Radio Failure Possible Explanation 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/!*) The Army lost its second Explorei
satellite yesterday, minutes after firing it spaceward with the Jupi
ter-C rocket. Odds are that it didn't go into orbit.
Scientists guessed that the satellite's radios may have failed, ot
it might have crashed back into the earth's atmosphere.
In either case, they don't know where it is and probably won't be
able to decide the fate of Explorer II for several days.
It was learned that the difficulty which held up the firing of the
satellite 18 minutes yesterday afternoon was attributed to a tape re
corder weighing just half a pound.
The 32.47-pound tube like moon would have been ;iblo to condense
its experience with cosmic rays on each trip around the world.

Then, in answer to a secret radio
signal from tho earth, it would
have sent its condensed message
back to U.S. scientists.
Signals Kail
In checking out the little tapo
recording device in the satellite
before the firing, it was found
that it failed to work. It was
tried several times and finally re
peated its signals correctly.
Then at 10:28 a.m. (PST), the
Jupiter-C blasted off from its pari,
rising gracefully and strong from
the Cape Canaveral launching
site on a tail of orange flame.
Yesterday's launching seemed
perfect and the radio signals from
the rising four-stage Jupiter-C
rocket sounded normal as they
were flashed back to the Army
scientists in a blockhouse at the
cape.
The Jupiter-C climbed straight
into an Overcast Florida sky, and
was hidden by the 5000 - foot
clouds just 27 seconds after it
blasted off. In 90 seconds even
the thunderous sound of the
rocket was out of hearing range.
Chiefs Explain
In Pasadena, Calif., Dr. Wil
liam Pickering, head of Jet Pro
pulsion Laboratory at the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology,
joined Maj. Gen. John B. Medaris,
Army missile chief, in this state
ment:
"There is every indication that
the satellite fired today did not
function normally and there is a
great probability that it is not in
orbit. No further information
will be available until technical
data are interpreted and reduced.
This will probably take several
days."
Pickering, whose laboratory
staff helped build the Army's Ju
piter-C, said there was only one
report that a radio signal had
been received from Explorer 11,
and that was questionable. It
came from a station al Inyokern,
Calif.
Faulty Orbiting
Pickering said:
"If you did not get your data,
what are the possibilities? One.
either the radio isn't functioning,
or, two, the satellite is not orbit
ing properly.
A reporter asked if JPL
thought the satellite was a fail
ure and Pickering answered:
"We are not prepared to make
any announcement that it is a
failure."
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory
developed both the Explorer I
and II satellites. It co-ordinates
reports from satellite monitoring
stations around the world.
