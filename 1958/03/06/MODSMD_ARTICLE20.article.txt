More and more the United States is getting
maneuvered into an unprepared summit confer
ence which can only do us harm.
The latest Soviet move —the widely hailed will
ingness of Moscow to have a meeting of foreign
ministers preliminary to tlie summit —offers a
good case study of how the Soviets appear to
shift policy without changing at all.
It is true that the West has favored a foreign
ministers' meeting in advance of a summit con
ference.
It is true that the Soviets, first opposing such
a meeting, now agree to it.
Ergo, the Soviets appear to have "reversed"
their policy, as many headlines have reported;
have shown "flexibility," have come nearer to
the American view.
But have they? The answer is no. This is all
appearance, no substance. If we are to avoid a
summit conference which will turn out to be
more an instrument of Kremlin foreign policy
than a means of genuine negotiation, we will
need to separate fact from appearance.

It seems to me that facts which show what the
Soviet move means are these:
The United Stat«>s has favored a meeting of
foreign ministers in order that, each can sound
out the other to see if theie is sufficient agree
ment on at least one single issue to make a sum
mit conference worth holding.
The Soviet Union has accepted a meeting of
foreign ministers with the explicit proviso that
there must be no discussion of real issues; thus
the Soviets will join in a preliminary meeting
only if it is not used to sound out each other to
see if there is any area of agreement on anything.
The United States has favored a meeting of
foreign ministers in order to make sure that in
setting a date ami place for a summit conference
there will be a good chance of it accomplishing
something.
The Soviet Union has accepted a meeting of
foreign ministers for the purpose of setting the
date and place of a summit conference without
finding out whether it will have the slightest

prospect of accomplishing anything.
It comes down to this:
The U.S. wants to prepare for a summit con
ference by having a substantial preliminary ex
change of views on what can be usefully nego
tiated.
The U.S.S.R. wants to summon a summit con
ference while carefully preventing a substantial
preliminary exchange of views on what can be
usefully negotiated.

Under these circumsances, it seems to me that
far too much importance is attached to the Soviet
willingness to have a meeting of the foreign
ministers.
The issue isn't who shall meet—whether for
eign ministers or ambassadors—it is what they
shall do.
The State Department's office boys would be
qualified to work out the time and place of a
summit meeting.
All that Moscow has accepted is a meeting of
foreign ministers, preliminary to a summit con
ference, so long as it is assigned no more than
an office boy's work.
Such a meeting, of course, would have to try
to draw up a summit agenda; but in order to
make absolutely sure that any preparation of the
agenda should not reveal what the Soviets are
thinking, Mr. Gromyko's note insisted that tlftre
must be no discussion of "substantive" matters.
If the heads of states are to meet productively
this year, surely there needs to be months of
careful, painstaking, thorough, candid exchanges
between Moscow and the West on the substance
of the issues. There ought to be sufficient agree
ment on one or two first steps that could be
taken; then we could see if a summit conference
could carry those steps further.
At this stage it seems to me clear that the
Soviets urgently want a summit conference with
every precaution that there shall be not only no
advance agreement but no advance discussion of
anything it might do.
This suggests that the Soviets want a summit
conference primarily for propaganda purposes.
Since a summit conference seems inevitable, there
are two thing* we will need to do: try to accom
plish the best, and prepare for the worst.
