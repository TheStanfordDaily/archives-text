K<1it.or, The Daily:
In his article in yesterday's Daily, Mr. Tinker,
writing against the proposed amendment to the
ASSU constitution, stated that since provisions
"A" and "C" of that amendment wore included in
the present Judicial Council rules of procedure,
the only significant question was that concerning
public trials.
Thi« assertion is simply false, for Mr. Tinker
does not add that these so-called rules of proce
dure are not binding upon the Judicial Council—
they are provisions by which it may act, not by
which it must act. Only the constitution and by
laws of the AS.SU are binding upon the Judicial

Council, and (he provisions in question do not
appear here.
It is indeed unfortunate that the quantity of
information provided Stanford students by both
camps has so far exceeded the quality and accu
racy of (hat information. We are voting upon a
question about which we have been grossly, if
innocently, misinformed.

As to Mr. Frey's question concerning the mys

meant to be looked at.
