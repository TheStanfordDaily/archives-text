Publication of "The Scratch
Sheet" has raised the question of
how much students know about
courses they are planning to
take.
It has also called into question
the quality of the courses as a
whole, the professors, reading
material, papers and exams.
The editors of the Scratch
Sheet say in the introduction that
their first edition is not complete.
Taking them at their word, The
Daily was not particularly con
cerned with the quality of the
work in this first paper, but rath
er with whether the publication
was worth while in principle. The
student opinions were solicited at
random.

"I'm not against it in principle.
It depends upon how well it is
done and how it is accepted by
the students and the faculty
whether il will do any construc
tive good. It is too easy to abuse.
It will be all right, however, if
students realize that it is the
same as any opinion they would
pick up along the street. Besides
they can attend classes for a
week or more before being defi
nitely committed to attend them."

it. It gives a subjective view of
the course. I think the evaluation
of the one course I have taken

One person's opinion is not good

Marilyn Schoeffer, Florence

"We are graded as students. I

professors should be evaluated

Bruce Hamilton, Beta Theta Pi,

idea, in particular for students
who haven't decided on a major.
You can't help people who are
looking for "mickeys" from tak

overrides the evils. There are a
few professors here who aren't
the best and I think a student
evaluation would help their teach

Michael Fox, Wilbur, '61 — "It is
100 subjective. You get the im
pression from the way it is writ

to judge what a course should
contain and how it should be
taught."

"It is definitely good. It gives
students a chance to see how
courses could be improved and
how to better the reading list."

Bruce Hamilton, Beta Theta Pi,
'60 — "Overall it is an excellent
idea, in particular for students
who haven't decided on a major.
You can't help people who are
looking for "mickeys" from tak
ing advantage of it, but the good
overrides the evils. There are a
few professors here who aren't
the best and I think a student
evaluation would help their teach
ing."
Michael Fox, Wilbur, '61 — "It is
100 subjective. You get the im
pression from the way it is writ
ten that the student is better able
to judge what a course should
contain and how it should be
taught."
Joan Ramsey, off-campus, '60 —
"It is definitely good. It gives
students a chance to see how
courses could be improved and
how to better the reading list."
Bob Marshall, Phi Kappa Psi,
'60 — "It is a good idea. All you
ever hear about a course is ru
mor. And I like the teacher oval
uation."
