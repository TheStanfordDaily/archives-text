# Campus Opinion
## 
### Jack Winkler 
Publication of "The Scratch
Sheet" has raised the question of
how much students know about
courses they are planning to
take.
It has also called into question
the quality of the courses as a
whole, the professors, reading
material, papers and exams.
The editors of the Scratch
Sheet say in the introduction that
their first edition is not complete.
Taking them at their word, The
Daily was not particularly con
cerned with the quality of the
work in this first paper, but rath
er with whether the publication
was worth while in principle. The
student opinions were solicited at
random.
Susan Zucker, Lagiuiita, '60-
"I'm not against it in principle.
It depends upon how well it is
done and how it is accepted by
the students and the faculty
whether il will do any construc
tive good. It is too easy to abuse.
It will be all right, however, if
students realize that it is the
same as any opinion they would
pick up along the street. Besides
they can attend classes for a
week or more before being defi
nitely committed to attend them."
(■ail (ireiner, Kohlc, '(>1 "I like
it. It gives a subjective view of
the course. I think the evaluation
of the one course I have taken
was fair."
I)ick Dundas, Phi Kappa Psi,
'59 "I don't think it is too good.
One person's opinion is not good
enough. You should take more
than one man's viewpoint."
.lay Kellaems, Zela Psi, '58 "I
think it is good. It can help me
even as a senior. I am tired of
taking advanced courses in my
major and I'd like to take some
more general liberal arts courses
and there are many I don't know
anything about. This gives me
an intelligent student's

M aril y n Sclioelfer, Florence
Moore, '">!) "1 think it would be
| neat to know what is going on in
all these courses. I think fresh
men should be able to read it
during orientation week."
I.ynn Garland, Koble, '61 — "I
think it is a good idea. 1 wish we
had had it before. In the future
I know I'll be using it to select
courses."
Susan Ralph, Lagunita, '60 --
"We are graded as students. 1
think it is light that courses and
professors should be evaluated
too."
•lan Merwin, Florence Moore,
T»8—"I think it is great. 1 like it
that the people who prepared it
signed their names. The principle
is good, because people should
know about courses before they
go into them. This Scratch Sheet
aided me in choosing Poli Sci 1
for next quarter.
Bruce Hamilton, Beta Theta Pi,
'60 "Overall it is an excellent
idea, in particular for students
who haven't decided on a major.
You can't help people who are
looking for "mickeys" from tak
ing advantage of it, but the good
overrides the evils. There are a
few professors here who aren't
the besl and I think a student
evaluation would help their teach
ing."
Michael Fox, Wilbur, '61—"It is
100 subjective. You get the im
pression from the way it is writ
ten that the student is better able
tf> judge what a course should
contain and how it should be
taught."
•loan Ramsey, off-campus, '60 —
"It is definitely good. It gives
students a chance to see how
courses could be improved and
how to better the reading list."
Bob Marshall, Phi Kappa Psi,
'60 "It is a good idea. All you
ever hear about a course is ru
mor. And I like the teacher oval
j nation.". ... . «
