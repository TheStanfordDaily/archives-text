# Full-time, off-the-job
## GRADUATE ENGINEERING TRAINING helps speed careers at Western Electric 
### 
Right now, Western Elcctric

Engineering Training Program.
They're attending courses at spe
cial study centers established by
the company in Chicago, New

It's a rare chance to study advanced
engineering and get full pay at the
same time.
These "students" arc guided by
a teaching stall' of top Western
Electric engineers, outside experts
and professors from leading
universities. They're learning the
latest technical developments...
honing up on everything from
manufacturing processes to com
puter applications.
When the program reaches its
peak, some 2,000 to 3,000 West
ern Electric engineers will attend
each year... studying in an atmos
phere as close to a university grad
uate school as is practical for
industry.
This engineering "university"
was born because of the ever
increasing complexity of Western
Electric's job as the manufactur
ing and supply unit of the Bell
Telephone System. Today W. E.
engineers are right in the middle
of exciting fields like microwave
radio relay, electronic switching
and automation. Graduate engi
neering training is designed to spur
their development and advance
ment throughout their careers.
Besides taking part in the Grad
uate Engineering Training Pro

In short, there's a unique op
portunity at Western Electric to
develop a professional carcer ...

Right now, Western Elcctric
engineers are back "on cam
pus" in a unique new Graduate
Engineering Training Program.
They're attending courses at spe
cial study centers established by
the company in Chicago, New
York and Winston-Salem, N. C.
It's a rare chance to study advanced
engineering and get full pay at the
same time.
These "students" arc guided by
a teaching stall' of top Western
Electric engineers, outside experts
and professors from leading
universities. They're learning the
latest technical developments...
honing up on everything from
manufacturing processes to com
puter applications.
When the program reaches its
peak, some 2,000 to 3,000 West
ern Electric engineers will attend
each year... studying in an atmos
phere as close to a university grad
uate school as is practical for
industry.
This engineering "university"
was born because of the ever
increasing complexity of Western
Electric's job as the manufactur
ing and supply unit of the Bell
Telephone System. Today W. E.
engineers are right in the middle
of exciting fields like microwave
radio relay, electronic switching
and automation. Graduate engi
neering training is designed to spur
their development and advance
ment throughout their careers.
Besides taking part in the Grad
