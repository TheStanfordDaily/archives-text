The program pets under way after
approximately six months on-the
job experience. First off:
I.A nine-week Introduction to
Western Electric I:ni>ineerin h
helps you learn about your W.E.
engineering field, sharpens your
skills in getting ideas across. Tech
nical subjects include communica
tions systems,product design prin
ciples, military electronic systems.
2. Another nine-week program.
General Development, starts after
your first year with us, helps
broaden and strengthen your
engineering background. Besides
technical subjects like engineering

statistics, measurements and in
strumentation. and electronics, you
receive grounding in human rela
tions and the socio-economic im
portance of engineering.
3. To meet continuing needs for
formalized technical training. Ad
vanced Development offers four
week courses tailored to the
individual needs of the engineers
selected to attend. These courses
are designed to help develop cre
ative engineering abilities.Compu
ter applications, switching theory,
feedback control systems, and
semi-conductor devices and cir
cuits are sample topics covered in
this phase.
