Looking Ahead
The Cards, in addition to going
for points against the Spartans,
will be trying to make the team
that Stanford will send to the
NCAA championships March 27-
29 at Ann Arbor, Mich.
Moore will definitely go in the
freestyle events, and Stanford
will enter its medley relay team.
But who will be on the relay com
bine and who will go in other
individual events remains a big
question.
Moore to Anchor
Hamilton and Mehl are the
contenders for the backstroke
spot; Peterson, Fuller or Weaver
will swim Uk 1 breaststroke leg,
and Winston Black or Timkin
will go in the butterfly. Moore
will anchor the team.
llaynie said that members of
the relay would also go in indi
vidual events, and that several
extra individuals might make the
trip if their performances war
rant.
