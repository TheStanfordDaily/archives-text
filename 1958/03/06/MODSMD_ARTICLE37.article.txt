trouble on the boards, also. He's
the fourth-best rebounder in the
conference with IG2 pull-downs in
14 games. At that, he's not the

High Scorers
Oregon ranks as one of the
PCC's highest-scoring clubs, with
a 62.9 average. The defense has
n't kept up, however, allowing op
ponents to score more than 67
points each outing. The Ducks
have accounted for the biggest
offensive outburst of the current
loop season, with 87 points i
against Washington three weeks
ago. |
Although Oregon has only a 5-9
league record, a half-game behind
Stanford, there's no reason to;
take the Ducks lightly. Besides!
I heir earlier 12-point win over the
Tribe, they've beaten Idaho and j
lost to Cal by just one point.
Other Wins
The Web foots have also beaten j
Washington and San Jose State —
a pair of teams Stanford has not !
topped this season. Out of the j
conference, the Ducks have done j
all right for themselves, winning
seven while losing only one.
Other than Franklin and Duf

has no one in double figures scor
ingwisc. The other starters
Charlie Rask. Dale Herron and
Bub Kuykcndall are scoring at
9.7. 7.6 and 6.6 respectively.
