All eyes will be on the distance
races when Stanford hosts San
Jose Stale and the Santa Clara
County Youth Village in the
year's first track and field meet,
Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
Distances were the weak point
of lust year's Indian team, hut all
indications are that the story will
he different in 1958.
Heading ihe parade for Stan

ford will be Canadian miler Nor
man Lloyd. Although only a
sophomore in eligibility, Lloyd
has plenty of running experience,
including some races as a mem
her of Empire national teams.
Broken (tone
Lloyd got in only one race for
ihe frosh last year after breaking
a bone in his foot. But he kept
active this summer, and has been
turning in excellent workout
times. Lloyd, whose best so far
in the mile is 1:14.6, appears to
have the potential to better that
mark by a good margin as the
season progresses.
In the two-mile, Coach Payton
Jordan will he especially interest
ed in seeing if Doug Martin can
continue to lower his dockings.
Martin, a junior, has been one
of I winter's most pleasant sur
prises, particularly in the latest
intra-squad meet, when lie turned
the eight laps in 9:25.7. Maury
Graves, who bested 9:10 as a
sophomore two years ago, is also
expected to begin lowering his
times.
Stronger in 880
The 880, a Stanford sore spot
last spring, should be capably
manned by Ernie Cunliffe, Dick
Lassen, John Patterson and Bob
McGuire. Cunliffe is in his first
year of varsity competition alter
laying out last season due to a
leg injury.
lie has a career besf of 1:54.3,
and says he'll be flirting with the
1:50 mark before the end of the
season. Lassen and Patterson

formed a big one-two punch for
iho frosh lasi year, and McCuire 1
is up from Mt. San Antonio Col-
I lege.
Sprint Questions
A good indication of just how
far the Indians can go as a team
this: spring will come with the
sprint results. Frank Herrmann,
the only consistent point-getter
| last year, has graduated.
A pair of sophomores, Dean
Smith and Norm Pease, and Ben
Anixter look like the best bets for
a "big-three," but the spots are
wide open. Pease sped 9.8 for
the l'rosh a year ago, but Smith
didn't see any competitive action.
He's a big, powerful runner—
much like Dave Sime -and looks
ready to break into the middle
nines if lie can maintain a rigor
ous training schedule.
Cobb Ready
One spot where St an ford I
should have few worries and j
good times is the hurdles. Chuck <
Cobb, second-high point man in
1957, got down to M.l in the
highs last year and could hit 13.9
or better by iho end of the sea
son.
The field events, strong point
j last year along with the hurdles,
will be thinner in many spots.
1 The javelin, discus and high jump
appear definitely weaker, at least
I now; the pole vault should be a
I Utile stronger, the shot put about
j the same, and the broad jump
belter balanced, although lacking
I I ferrmann.

active this summer, and has been

in the mile is 1:14.6, appears to

In the two-mile, Coach Payton

Martin, a junior, has been one
of I winter's most pleasant sur

intra-squad meet, when lie turned

sophomore two years ago, is also
expected to begin lowering his
times.

The 880, a Stanford sore spot
last spring, should be capably
manned by Ernie Cunliffe, Dick
Lassen, John Patterson and Bob

year of varsity competition alter
laying out last season due to a
leg injury.

Sprint Questions
A good indication of just how

this: spring will come with the
sprint results. Frank Herrmann,

A pair of sophomores, Dean
Smith and Norm Pease, and Ben
Anixter look like the best bets for
a "big-three," but the spots are
wide open. Pease sped 9.8 for

son.
The field events, strong point
