The ELEC, JVliss O'Connor ex
plained. is a Japanese commis
sion of outstanding representa
tives from the major, Japanese
universities whose purpose is to
improve the teaching of English
in Japanese secondary schools.
Improvement Methods
"This improvement is to be
done through preparing a series t
of texts and teaching materials
based on modern linguistic prin
ciples anrl through holding semi
nars for the training of teachers
in the use of these new mate
rials," Miss O'Connor said.
The task of teaching English in
Japan is tremendous, Miss O'Con
nor emphasized. "English is re
quired for every student begin
ning in the seventh grade and
continuing as long as he goes to
school. College graduates have
had ten years of English instruc
tion."
"Besides the number of years
of English instruction, the classes
are held six days a week, 50 min
utes a day," Miss O'Connor point
ed out. "The classes are large,
averaging 60 per class."
KLKC's Background
The ELEC, with which Miss
O'Connor will work until autumn
quarter, was formed in August,
1956, when the U.S. Council on
Economic and Cultural Affairs
sent one British and two Ameri
can consultants to Japan to work
with the Japanese in forming a
three-year co-operative English
program.
Financed by the Japanese gov
ernment, the ELEC also receives
some support through the Coun
cil on Economic; and Cultural Af
fairs.
Miss O'Connor was asked to
join the ELEC last year when
she was in Tokyo as a Fulbright
Lecturer in Linguistics at Keio
University.
Summing up her activities,
Miss O'Connor said, "A great deal
of experimentation in linguistic
methods has been carried on in
the United States and we want to
give the Japanese the benefits of
this research."
