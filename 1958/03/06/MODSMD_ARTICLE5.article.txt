## GOP Chief Discusses Party Line 
### 
Philip Breck's discussion of
"The Republican Viewpoint on
P1 a n ne d Economy" yesterday
claimed the principles of the Re
publican party to be grounded on
individualism.
Breck, president of the Berke
ley Republican Assembly, cited as
basic to Republican theory the
age-old historical conflict of indi
vidualism with systematism. in a
talk to the Republican caucus of
the Political Union.
"This battle has been going on
in the United States since the '30's
in the definition of political par
lies," said Breck. "The Republican
parly has fairly consistently taken
the part of the individual, the
Democratic party that of the sys
tem."
Society's Responsibility
Both parlies feel thai society
has a responsibility lo protect its
members from the ills of the so
cial organization. The difference
is one of emphasis: the Republi
cans tend to favor giving people
means lo help themselves, and I lie
Democrats lo solving I he problem
for the public, Breck stated.
As an example he cited housing
policy. The Republican party fa
vors Ihe underwriting of private
housing developments; the Demo
crats advocate p u b 1 i c housing
projects.
Conflict Today
The conflict between individual
ism and systematism exists today
on the international level between
the United States and Ihe Soviet
Union, Breck pointed out. The
present Republican attempt to
clarify its principles results in
large part from the threat of Com
munism and of various left-wing
political and economic doctrines.
Republican theory will vary
somewhat with the times and in
different sections of the country,
Breck explained, but the princi
ples generally hold true univer
sally.
