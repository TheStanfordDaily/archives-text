# Conductor Salgo Brings Innovations to Symphony
## 
### Camille Petersen 
Special invitations for spring performances reaffirm the superior
ity of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra and its director Sandor
Salgo.
The members of the Palace of the Legion of Honor of San Fran
cisco, as "patrons of Art and Music," have asked the Symphony to

perform for them April 29. The
group will present one of the Ivvo
spring operas. "Thomas and Sal
ly," by Dr. Arne, early 18th cen
tury English composer. This op
era was first done in 1710, and
this will be the first performance
in the United States.
The other opera to appear on
the double bill is a madrigal fable
by Monet ti entitled "The Unicorn,
the Gorgon and the Manieorn."
The Spring Opera will be pre
sented April 23 through 20.
Cal Invites
The University of California has
invited only two symphonies to
take pari in the dedication of their
new music building May 20 the
Stanford Symphony and the San
Francisco Symphony.
Besides these activities next
quarter, members of the Stanford
Symphony must also prepare
chamber music concerts.
This quarter the group has been
equally busy. They have present
ed two full-orchestra concerts -
one studenl-direeted and an all-
Debussy concert to be given by a
group tonight.
Salgo hopes to continue I tic stu
dent directing and to develop thej
program into a training-proving
ground for new conductors.
194!) Reorganization
The symphony was reorganized
in 1949 and placed under the ba
ton of Salgo. The 65-piece group
is composed of students from all
departments and of olher people
having various connections with
the University.
When Virgil Thompson, former
music critic for the New York_
Herald Tribune, heard the sym
phony a few years ago, he called
it one of the best collegiate or
chestras in the United States.
Salgo was graduated from the
Royal Academy of Music in Bu
dapest, Hungary. Since coming to
Stanford from Princeton Univer
sity in 1919, he has not confined
himself to directing University
music groups. He has been guest
conductor of the San Francisco
Symphony, I he Mexico City Sym
phony, and the BBC and Halle Or
chestra in England.
