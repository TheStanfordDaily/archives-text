# Regulus-firing Sub Will Join Navy Today
## 
### 
VALLEJO (/P) — The guided
missile submarine Gray back —
the first equipped to launch the
supersonic Regulus II — will be
commissioned this afternoon at
Mare Island Naval Shipyard.
This big fleet submarine, with
an overall length of 320 feet and
a displacement of 3600 tons sub
merged, is credited with being
capable of laying Regulus II nu
clear warheads on virtually ev
ery significant tactical target in
the world.
This . capability is due to the
Grayback's maneuverability, en
abling her to launch missiles from
points in the. seas covering three
fourths of the globe, according to
Ray C. Blayiock, engineering
vice-president for Chance Vought
Aircraft, builder of the missile.
The diesel - powered Grayback
will carry Regulus II missiles in
twin, cylinder - shaped hangars,
faired into the submarine's upper
hull forward. This configuration
gives the new sub a different
look, with the launching platform
immediately ,aft of the missile
hangars.
Grayback. launched at Mare Is
land last July 2 after three years
on the ways, will be commanded
by Lt. Cmdr. Hugh G. Nott of
Bowling Green. Ohio. She will
have a crew of 85 officers and
enlisted men.
