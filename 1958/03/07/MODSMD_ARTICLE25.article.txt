# SCIENTISTS:
## Explorer II Probably Destroyed 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/P)—
Explorer 11, the most advanced
U.S. moon, probably burned to
dud in a plunge toward earth
scientists have decided. It defi
nitely did not go into orbit.
They said a 10-inch rocket that
was supposed to boost the satel
lite to gravity-defying speed failed
to ignile and Explorer II behaved
like any other surface-to-surface
missile.
Scientists ruled out any other
possibility, such a« a failure of
the satellite's radios, which might
have left it circling the earth in a
silent orbit.
They said it was not known
why the automatic ignition sys
tem in the last stage had failed,
after the first three stages func
tioned perfectly. It would be dif
ficult to ever find out the reason,
they added.
Explorer 11, 6 inches in diam
eter and more than 6V2 feet long,
probably plummeted into the
earth's atmosphere some 1900
miles from Cape Canaveral, where
it was launched Wednesday. It
carried with it the 40 pounds of
still unburned solid fuel in the
last-stage rocket.
Its own high speed and the fric
tion of the earth's atmosphere
probably produced enormous heat,
and the metal satellite died a fiery
and sudden death.
