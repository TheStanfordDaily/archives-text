### Ellington K. Farthingale 
"Revenge is sweet," 'tis said,
and next Wednesday is the day
long awaited by Daily slaffers.
Their answer to the Chaparral's
challenge of "Anything you can
do. we can do better" will be pre
sented in the March issue of the
campus humor (?) magazine.
The new issue of the Chappie
will feature "a bright cover to sell
it during Dead Week," said Old
Boy Jim Gleason as he gazed
proudly upon his handiwork. The
cover highlights a typical Stan
ford situation—a frustrated male
intently regarding a shapely
blonde female—obviously a Stan
ford student.
The "Campoos Issue" will in
clude a section kindly allotted to
display the varied and manifold
talents of members of the Daily
staff, "The Stanford Credo,"
" 'Greeko,' the Rushee's Time-
Saver" and "Professormanship: A
Definitive Analysis."
