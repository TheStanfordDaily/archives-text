# Psychiatrists: â€˜Cordry Sane'
## 
### 
Thomas Cordry 111 is sane now
and was sane when he shot 17-
year-old Deena Boon, two psychi
atrists reported to Santa Clara
County District Attorney Louis
P. Bergna yesterday
Cordry is to be arraigned to
day at 10 a.m. before Superior
Judge William F. James in San
Jose. As a result of the indict
ment by the Santa Clara County
Grand Jury Tuesday, proceedings
initiated last week before Palo
Alto Municipal Judge Paul I.
Myers were canceled.
Alan A. Lindsay, Oakland,
Cordry's attorney, has indicated
that the youth will plead not
guilty and not guilty by reason
of insanity. However, he is not
expected to make his plea today.
Bergna has said he will ask for
the death penalty for Cordry,
contending that facts of the case
show that Miss Bonn's murder
Feb. 25 was fully premeditated.
The district attorney added
that he would like "a fast trial"
but that he expects the defense
to seok delays on the theory that
public opinion will "cool off as
time passes.
