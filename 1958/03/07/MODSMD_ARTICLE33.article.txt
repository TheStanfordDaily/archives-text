# The 						New Rugby Union
## 
### 
STANFORD'S newest athletic organization, the
Stanford Rughy Union, appears to us to lie an
excellent addition to the University sports scene.
The aims of the I nion keeping the sport
separate and distinctive, and promoting tradi
tional rivalry without accompanying animosity
are goals which could well he followed hy
more college sports. And rugby's idea to or-'
ganize its own promotional association serves
as a perfect model for action hy other so-called
minor sports which are not receiving the fan
support and financial assistance they deserve.
Minor sports at Stanford have long had to
exist on limited funds and with insufficient stu
dent support. This is certainly not meant as a
criticism of the Department of Athletics — a
budget will onl\ stretch so far. It's only natu

r;il in fact, almost mandatory thai most fi
nancial support should go to major sports.
But there's nothing to prevent a team from
organizing like the rubers or the crew have
done in order to further their own interests.
We encourage other sports to follow suit.
If the rubers are anywhere nearly as sue
eessful as the crew, they will lind they are en
joying heller competition, improved facilities
and equipment, and that they are producing
better teams.
We hope the Rugby Union is successful in
its attempt to {rain hacking; we further hope
that more sports which presently suffer from
lack of fan interest will take their cue from the
ones which have found a method to create this
interest.
