Moral Responsibility
Editor, The Daily:
In the space of the last few days the campus
has had to experience tiie shock of learning that
one from their own midst has deliberately and
cold bloodedly murdered a girl as a result of cer
tain mysterious urges to kill. The horror of the
situation is increased by the knowledge that the
murderer seems to have had the good opinion of
all who knew him and by the fact that officials
searching the records ex post facto can find noth
ing which could have led them to expect Mr.
Cordry capable of his crime. Moreover, the hor
ror is further increased by the fact that the crime
has occurred in a world which, because composed
of capable and idealistic young people who live
together for a few years in comparative ease, tra
ditionally has acquired a sort of charm. Since the
deed, campus talk has in general returned to
more comfortable subjects of conversation. The
vast the students have never felt any
sense of identification with the murderer, and no
one is going to know whether someone may think
more seriously of acting on criminal thoughts
which have at times flitted across his mind.
This possibility can hardly seem merely the
result "of* a ' morbid imagination to anyone who
has watched the increase in the number of "sex
crimes" in our generation. The question is: what
are we going to do about it? Surely, when we
confront much of the "evil" which reaches into
our daily lives, we are justified in putting it out
of our minds in order that we may sleep at night.
Acceptance of our human condition demands that
we to some extent reconcile ourselves to the fact
of evil in this world, if we can do nothing about
it. I do not mean that we should or can absolve
ourselves from responsibility for international
war, however remote from us. Rut, in a sense,
isolated cases of murder are more than wars;
[they are| a problem of the family and commu
nity, and therefore a matter for which the private
citizen is more directly responsible.
The depressing fact about sex crimes, such as
has just occurred here,'is that the frequency of
them is a unique phenomenon of our century and
of America. The causes, of course, are many:
wrong emphasis on sex; that fsic*| fact that many
mothers work; the tension of modern civiliza
tion; imperfect understanding of modern psycho
logical and educational theories; the, loss of tra
ditional ide;tls and codes of behavior the latter
two causes having led to an attempt to explain

away the moral responsibility of the individual.
But it is not my purpose to discuss these causes,
many of which have vast sociological implica
tions. The point I would make is that, while
ultimately these things will have to be considered,
we might in the meantime help stem the tide of
sex crimes by changing our attitude toward them.
Since the nineteenth century there has been a
growing tendency, usually thought to be humane,
to judge the punishment to be meted out to the
criminal on the basis of his intention rather than
on the basis of his actual deeds. The result in this
century is that more and more criminal cases, on
grounds of insanity, go unpunished and therefore
[are] not held up as the proper examples to those
prone to err.
The fact is, as modern psychology teaches—as,
for example, we may read in Lionel Trilling's "Of
This Time, Of That Place"; as the lifelong strug
gle of Samuel Johnson against insanity may show
us - that the borderline between sanity and in
sanity, normality and abnormality, is fuzzy and
constantly eludes definition, there being some
slightly abnormal tendencies in the best of us.
Granted that some people are not able to main
tain by rational control the delicate balance of
the sane mind, but that they do go insane and
their 1 insanity is recognizable; others—and they
form at least part of the new criminal element
in our society — have mysterious criminal im
pulses which seem to well up from their uncon
scious, and become known to others only when
on a single occasion the rational powers are re
laxed and the person commits a crime.
It would be premature to suggest that Mr.
Cordry is one of these persons, not actually insane
but morally weak enough to need all the props
that religion and law in older, European societies
have furnished to keep such a man from actually
committing a criminal act. I urn only suggesting
that many of our criminals do fit this category.
And the most immediate solution may lie in a
more traditional, older and hard headed view
such as that in More's "Utopia" that in the case
of an actual crime, the objective fact of the deed
should ordinarily be judged rather than the ir
rational powers of the psyche (which are only
partially understood by the modern scientist—to
whom, incidentally, the individual layman may
not delegate his moral responsibility), over which
we are bound lo exercise rational control as long
as we would remain within the pale of human
sociely.

Granted that some people are not able to main
tain by rational control the delicate balance of
the sane mind, but that they do go insane and
their 1 insanity is recognizable; others—and they

in our society — have mysterious criminal im
pulses which seem to well up from their uncon
scious, and become known to others only when
on a single occasion the rational powers are re
laxed and the person commits a crime.
It would be premature to suggest that Mr.
Cordry is one of these persons, not actually insane
but morally weak enough to need all the props
that religion and law in older, European societies
have furnished to keep such a man from actually
committing a criminal act. I urn only suggesting
that many of our criminals do fit this category.

of an actual crime, the objective fact of the deed
should ordinarily be judged rather than the ir
rational powers of the psyche (which are only
partially understood by the modern scientist—to
whom, incidentally, the individual layman may
not delegate his moral responsibility), over which
we are bound lo exercise rational control as long

In the space of the last few days the campus
has had to experience tiie shock of learning that
one from their own midst has deliberately and
cold bloodedly murdered a girl as a result of cer
tain mysterious urges to kill. The horror of the
situation is increased by the knowledge that the
murderer seems to have had the good opinion of
all who knew him and by the fact that officials
searching the records ex post facto can find noth
ing which could have led them to expect Mr.
Cordry capable of his crime. Moreover, the hor
ror is further increased by the fact that the crime
has occurred in a world which, because composed
of capable and idealistic young people who live
together for a few years in comparative ease, tra
ditionally has acquired a sort of charm. Since the
deed, campus talk has in general returned to
more comfortable subjects of conversation. The
vast the students have never felt any
sense of identification with the murderer, and no
one is going to know whether someone may think
more seriously of acting on criminal thoughts
which have at times flitted across his mind.
This possibility can hardly seem merely the
result "of* a ' morbid imagination to anyone who
has watched the increase in the number of "sex
crimes" in our generation. The question is: what
are we going to do about it? Surely, when we
confront much of the "evil" which reaches into
our daily lives, we are justified in putting it out
of our minds in order that we may sleep at night.
Acceptance of our human condition demands that
we to some extent reconcile ourselves to the fact
of evil in this world, if we can do nothing about
it. I do not mean that we should or can absolve
ourselves from responsibility for international
war, however remote from us. Rut, in a sense,
isolated cases of murder are more than wars;
[they are| a problem of the family and commu
nity, and therefore a matter for which the private
citizen is more directly responsible.
The depressing fact about sex crimes, such as
has just occurred here,'is that the frequency of
them is a unique phenomenon of our century and
of America. The causes, of course, are many:
wrong emphasis on sex; that fsic*| fact that many
mothers work; the tension of modern civiliza
tion; imperfect understanding of modern psycho
logical and educational theories; the, loss of tra
ditional ide;tls and codes of behavior the latter
two causes having led to an attempt to explain

away the moral responsibility of the individual.
But it is not my purpose to discuss these causes,
many of which have vast sociological implica
tions. The point I would make is that, while
ultimately these things will have to be considered,
we might in the meantime help stem the tide of
sex crimes by changing our attitude toward them.
Since the nineteenth century there has been a
growing tendency, usually thought to be humane,
to judge the punishment to be meted out to the
criminal on the basis of his intention rather than
on the basis of his actual deeds. The result in this
century is that more and more criminal cases, on
grounds of insanity, go unpunished and therefore
[are] not held up as the proper examples to those
prone to err.
The fact is, as modern psychology teaches—as,
for example, we may read in Lionel Trilling's "Of
This Time, Of That Place"; as the lifelong strug
gle of Samuel Johnson against insanity may show
us - that the borderline between sanity and in
sanity, normality and abnormality, is fuzzy and
constantly eludes definition, there being some
slightly abnormal tendencies in the best of us.

mothers work; the tension of modern civiliza
tion; imperfect understanding of modern psycho
logical and educational theories; the, loss of tra
ditional ide;tls and codes of behavior the latter
two causes having led to an attempt to explain

away the moral responsibility of the individual.
But it is not my purpose to discuss these causes,
many of which have vast sociological implica
tions. The point I would make is that, while
ultimately these things will have to be considered,
we might in the meantime help stem the tide of
sex crimes by changing our attitude toward them.
Since the nineteenth century there has been a
growing tendency, usually thought to be humane,
to judge the punishment to be meted out to the
criminal on the basis of his intention rather than
on the basis of his actual deeds. The result in this
century is that more and more criminal cases, on
grounds of insanity, go unpunished and therefore
[are] not held up as the proper examples to those
prone to err.
The fact is, as modern psychology teaches—as,
for example, we may read in Lionel Trilling's "Of
This Time, Of That Place"; as the lifelong strug
gle of Samuel Johnson against insanity may show
us - that the borderline between sanity and in
sanity, normality and abnormality, is fuzzy and
constantly eludes definition, there being some
slightly abnormal tendencies in the best of us.
Granted that some people are not able to main
tain by rational control the delicate balance of
the sane mind, but that they do go insane and
their 1 insanity is recognizable; others—and they
form at least part of the new criminal element
in our society — have mysterious criminal im
pulses which seem to well up from their uncon
scious, and become known to others only when
on a single occasion the rational powers are re
laxed and the person commits a crime.
It would be premature to suggest that Mr.
Cordry is one of these persons, not actually insane
but morally weak enough to need all the props
that religion and law in older, European societies
have furnished to keep such a man from actually
committing a criminal act. I urn only suggesting
that many of our criminals do fit this category.
And the most immediate solution may lie in a
more traditional, older and hard headed view
such as that in More's "Utopia" that in the case
of an actual crime, the objective fact of the deed
should ordinarily be judged rather than the ir
rational powers of the psyche (which are only
partially understood by the modern scientist—to
whom, incidentally, the individual layman may
not delegate his moral responsibility), over which
we are bound lo exercise rational control as long
as we would remain within the pale of human
sociely.

Editor, The Daily:
In the space of the last few days the campus
has had to experience tiie shock of learning that
one from their own midst has deliberately and
cold bloodedly murdered a girl as a result of cer
tain mysterious urges to kill. The horror of the
situation is increased by the knowledge that the
murderer seems to have had the good opinion of
all who knew him and by the fact that officials
searching the records ex post facto can find noth
ing which could have led them to expect Mr.
Cordry capable of his crime. Moreover, the hor
ror is further increased by the fact that the crime
has occurred in a world which, because composed
of capable and idealistic young people who live
together for a few years in comparative ease, tra
ditionally has acquired a sort of charm. Since the
deed, campus talk has in general returned to
more comfortable subjects of conversation. The
vast the students have never felt any
sense of identification with the murderer, and no
one is going to know whether someone may think
more seriously of acting on criminal thoughts
which have at times flitted across his mind.
This possibility can hardly seem merely the
result "of* a ' morbid imagination to anyone who
has watched the increase in the number of "sex
crimes" in our generation. The question is: what
are we going to do about it? Surely, when we
confront much of the "evil" which reaches into
our daily lives, we are justified in putting it out
of our minds in order that we may sleep at night.
Acceptance of our human condition demands that
we to some extent reconcile ourselves to the fact
of evil in this world, if we can do nothing about
it. I do not mean that we should or can absolve
ourselves from responsibility for international
war, however remote from us. Rut, in a sense,
isolated cases of murder are more than wars;
[they are| a problem of the family and commu
nity, and therefore a matter for which the private
citizen is more directly responsible.
The depressing fact about sex crimes, such as
has just occurred here,'is that the frequency of
them is a unique phenomenon of our century and
of America. The causes, of course, are many:
wrong emphasis on sex; that fsic*| fact that many
mothers work; the tension of modern civiliza
