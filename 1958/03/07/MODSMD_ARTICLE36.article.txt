Judicial Kuh'S
Edilor, The Daily:
It seems that a few students are misinformed ahoul the operation j
of Judicial Council, especially one Jim Siemon. In his letter to the i
editor yesterday, he stated that the Council is not hound by their
rules of procedure. If this is true, why is it that any standing rules j
of procedure for Judicial Council must he approved by Legislature?
Also, if any of these rules are ignored in* the process of a trial, the ;
defendant has the right lo appeal his case to the President of ihe
University.
The Council is elected by the student body and is entrusted with
the responsibility of administering justice to violators of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code. If you think that the members j
of Council would belie the trust placed in them, don't you believe
that the statements in the above paragraph make it binding for the
Council to follow their accepted rules?
Technically, any set of rules or constitution of any campus or
ganization when approved by Legislature make it binding upon that
organization to follow said rules to the letter. If the rules of pro
cedure for Judicial Council, Social Coordinating Board, AWS Board,
Cardinals, Political Union, IIR, Ram's Head. Pub Rel, Election Com
mission, Rally Com, etc., were included in the ASSU By-Laws you
would need a publication the size of an encyclopedia to contain them.
It is therefore in the interest of efficiency that each organization
publish its own rules with the approval of Legislature.

Intellectual Sportsmanship
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the continuous flow of statements on apathy at Stan
ford which call for an examination of the causes (why not the so
lutions?) of this situation, I should like to set forth the following
theory: our "dullness" is a result both of a late adolescent phase
of changing values and a condition of bad sportsmanship in the in
tellectual arena. Many Stanford students are in a period of their
lives during which they are re-examining (we hope!) their values
and goals, and, because their ideas are in a state of flux, they are
unsure of the purposes and consequences of. their actions. Thus, they
hesitate to act, for fear of making a mistake.
Motivated by the highest ideals, they hesitate to give a less-than
exeellent level of performance, preferring to give no performance
at all. They hesitate to commit themselves to any cause, for fear of j
flevoting their time and energy to something which may ultimately
prove unsuccessful or unworthy of the effort. Although most stu
dents would not dream of ceasing to go to football games because
the team loses, we are less charitable with ourselves and less willing
to give our wholehearted support to interests and ideas which may
he "losers." Our undue concern for our mental safety prompts us
to avoid taking a stand which we may later have to repudiate.
Only the poor sport refuses to play tennis with a more experi
enced opponent lor fear of 'losing. On the contrary, tennis players
know that their best opportunity to improve their skill lies in com- j
peting with better players. Yet we are poor sports in our mental I
activities; we accept the ideas and standards of more experienced j
experts and of our elders merely on their authority rather than on j
the merits of the ideas themselves-and their applicability to can- needs. I
We avoid active participation in Ihe game of "thinking for ourselves" j
because we would rather not play at all than risk coming out on the |
losing end, once.
We should realize that, just as physical exercise develops the body
and is beneficial quite apart from one's success in a particular match,
mental exercise is also beneficial in itself, and that increased ex
perience brings with it yie skill which we admire in others while |
afraid to strive for it ourselves. Furthermore, our "intellectuals" j
could help by being better sports, too. Instead of remaining critically
aloof from their less-experienced fellows, they could use their skill
to guide the people around them in a mutual pursuit of interests
and insights.
Many of us place loo high a value on the security of status quo,
and, by leaning too heavily on the experience of others, we forego
an important pari of life, the lesling of experience and the discovery,
for ourselves, of those Vahiesajrid standards which suit our needs i
and which are embedded in Â«|f experiences. The conclusions of our J
elders and experts should awaken our interest in mental contests |
hut they need not determine the rules by which we play. I do not |
advocale learning everything by experience; it is a truism to say ;
that one need not be burned to know that fire is hot. Yet there is a '
middle road between the foolishly conservative way and the foolishly !
radical way. a road on which we do not enthrone mental comfort ;
alongside of physical comfort and thus forego experience altogether, j
Many Stanford students make summer pilgrimages all over the !
world and return home without having rearranged their minds at all.
We should be eager to take mental journeys in conjunction with our J
physical ones, to become acquainted with ideas foreign to our safe j
and accepted beliefs and to grow and develop freely, without the ;
inhibiting, irrational fear of making mistakes. We should be at least i
as tolerant of clumsiness, mistakes and lost contests in our mental i
development as we are of such setbacks in our athletics. The results j
of enthusiastic participation in mental contests would be highly en-1
joyable and might even make us "interesting" enough to match wits j
with the current gloomy batch of cutics of Stanford life.

Rehabilitation Service
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently been thinking about one person in Santa Clara
County jail. I wonder how often we think of the other hundreds of
men who are currently in prisons in this country alone. Up to 6,000
men are discharged from these prisons each year, and over 40 per!
cent of them have no homes or jobs to go to.
A voluntary rehabilitation service run by a group of local women j
tries to help these men and their families. When discharged from |
prison a clean set of clothes helps a man to find confidence to face
life again, and it will considerably improve his chances of getting a
job. This auxiliary service would like to be able to give every needy
man a clean, but not new, set of clothes. They would be very grateful
if we Stanford men could help them with their inexhaustible needs.
The auxiliary service is also opening a mobile library for pris
oners. The dreary hours that ihese men spend in prison can be
brightened by the sports magazines, paperbacks (even comics?), that
we would normally throw away.
We will be glad to receive any clean (and not worn out) clothes,
books or-magazines at-our collection -center-in the-YWCA lounge
at the top of the Women's Clubhouse.

Edilor, The Daily:
It seems that a few students are misinformed ahoul the operation j
of Judicial Council, especially one Jim Siemon. In his letter to the i
editor yesterday, he stated that the Council is not hound by their
rules of procedure. If this is true, why is it that any standing rules j
of procedure for Judicial Council must he approved by Legislature?
Also, if any of these rules are ignored in* the process of a trial, the ;
defendant has the right lo appeal his case to the President of ihe
University.
The Council is elected by the student body and is entrusted with
the responsibility of administering justice to violators of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code. If you think that the members j
of Council would belie the trust placed in them, don't you believe
that the statements in the above paragraph make it binding for the
Council to follow their accepted rules?
Technically, any set of rules or constitution of any campus or
ganization when approved by Legislature make it binding upon that
organization to follow said rules to the letter. If the rules of pro
cedure for Judicial Council, Social Coordinating Board, AWS Board,
Cardinals, Political Union, IIR, Ram's Head. Pub Rel, Election Com
mission, Rally Com, etc., were included in the ASSU By-Laws you
would need a publication the size of an encyclopedia to contain them.
It is therefore in the interest of efficiency that each organization
publish its own rules with the approval of Legislature.

Intellectual Sportsmanship
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the continuous flow of statements on apathy at Stan
ford which call for an examination of the causes (why not the so
lutions?) of this situation, I should like to set forth the following
theory: our "dullness" is a result both of a late adolescent phase
of changing values and a condition of bad sportsmanship in the in
tellectual arena. Many Stanford students are in a period of their
lives during which they are re-examining (we hope!) their values
and goals, and, because their ideas are in a state of flux, they are
unsure of the purposes and consequences of. their actions. Thus, they
hesitate to act, for fear of making a mistake.
Motivated by the highest ideals, they hesitate to give a less-than
exeellent level of performance, preferring to give no performance
at all. They hesitate to commit themselves to any cause, for fear of j
flevoting their time and energy to something which may ultimately
prove unsuccessful or unworthy of the effort. Although most stu
dents would not dream of ceasing to go to football games because
the team loses, we are less charitable with ourselves and less willing
to give our wholehearted support to interests and ideas which may
he "losers." Our undue concern for our mental safety prompts us
to avoid taking a stand which we may later have to repudiate.
Only the poor sport refuses to play tennis with a more experi
enced opponent lor fear of 'losing. On the contrary, tennis players
know that their best opportunity to improve their skill lies in com- j
peting with better players. Yet we are poor sports in our mental I
activities; we accept the ideas and standards of more experienced j
experts and of our elders merely on their authority rather than on j
the merits of the ideas themselves-and their applicability to can- needs. I
We avoid active participation in Ihe game of "thinking for ourselves" j
because we would rather not play at all than risk coming out on the |
losing end, once.
We should realize that, just as physical exercise develops the body
and is beneficial quite apart from one's success in a particular match,
mental exercise is also beneficial in itself, and that increased ex
perience brings with it yie skill which we admire in others while |
afraid to strive for it ourselves. Furthermore, our "intellectuals" j
could help by being better sports, too. Instead of remaining critically
aloof from their less-experienced fellows, they could use their skill
to guide the people around them in a mutual pursuit of interests
and insights.
Many of us place loo high a value on the security of status quo,
and, by leaning too heavily on the experience of others, we forego
an important pari of life, the lesling of experience and the discovery,
for ourselves, of those Vahiesajrid standards which suit our needs i
and which are embedded in Â«|f experiences. The conclusions of our J
elders and experts should awaken our interest in mental contests |
hut they need not determine the rules by which we play. I do not |
advocale learning everything by experience; it is a truism to say ;
that one need not be burned to know that fire is hot. Yet there is a '
middle road between the foolishly conservative way and the foolishly !
radical way. a road on which we do not enthrone mental comfort ;
alongside of physical comfort and thus forego experience altogether, j
Many Stanford students make summer pilgrimages all over the !
world and return home without having rearranged their minds at all.
We should be eager to take mental journeys in conjunction with our J
physical ones, to become acquainted with ideas foreign to our safe j
and accepted beliefs and to grow and develop freely, without the ;
inhibiting, irrational fear of making mistakes. We should be at least i
as tolerant of clumsiness, mistakes and lost contests in our mental i
development as we are of such setbacks in our athletics. The results j
of enthusiastic participation in mental contests would be highly en-1
joyable and might even make us "interesting" enough to match wits j
with the current gloomy batch of cutics of Stanford life.

A voluntary rehabilitation service run by a group of local women j
tries to help these men and their families. When discharged from |

men are discharged from these prisons each year, and over 40 per!
cent of them have no homes or jobs to go to.
A voluntary rehabilitation service run by a group of local women j
tries to help these men and their families. When discharged from |
prison a clean set of clothes helps a man to find confidence to face
life again, and it will considerably improve his chances of getting a
job. This auxiliary service would like to be able to give every needy
man a clean, but not new, set of clothes. They would be very grateful
if we Stanford men could help them with their inexhaustible needs.
The auxiliary service is also opening a mobile library for pris
oners. The dreary hours that ihese men spend in prison can be
brightened by the sports magazines, paperbacks (even comics?), that
we would normally throw away.
We will be glad to receive any clean (and not worn out) clothes,

It seems that a few students are misinformed ahoul the operation j
of Judicial Council, especially one Jim Siemon. In his letter to the i
editor yesterday, he stated that the Council is not hound by their
rules of procedure. If this is true, why is it that any standing rules j
of procedure for Judicial Council must he approved by Legislature?
Also, if any of these rules are ignored in* the process of a trial, the ;
defendant has the right lo appeal his case to the President of ihe
University.
The Council is elected by the student body and is entrusted with
the responsibility of administering justice to violators of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code. If you think that the members j
of Council would belie the trust placed in them, don't you believe
that the statements in the above paragraph make it binding for the
Council to follow their accepted rules?
Technically, any set of rules or constitution of any campus or
ganization when approved by Legislature make it binding upon that
organization to follow said rules to the letter. If the rules of pro
cedure for Judicial Council, Social Coordinating Board, AWS Board,
Cardinals, Political Union, IIR, Ram's Head. Pub Rel, Election Com
mission, Rally Com, etc., were included in the ASSU By-Laws you
would need a publication the size of an encyclopedia to contain them.
It is therefore in the interest of efficiency that each organization

Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the continuous flow of statements on apathy at Stan
ford which call for an examination of the causes (why not the so
lutions?) of this situation, I should like to set forth the following
theory: our "dullness" is a result both of a late adolescent phase
of changing values and a condition of bad sportsmanship in the in
tellectual arena. Many Stanford students are in a period of their
lives during which they are re-examining (we hope!) their values
and goals, and, because their ideas are in a state of flux, they are
unsure of the purposes and consequences of. their actions. Thus, they
hesitate to act, for fear of making a mistake.
Motivated by the highest ideals, they hesitate to give a less-than
exeellent level of performance, preferring to give no performance
at all. They hesitate to commit themselves to any cause, for fear of j
flevoting their time and energy to something which may ultimately
prove unsuccessful or unworthy of the effort. Although most stu
dents would not dream of ceasing to go to football games because
the team loses, we are less charitable with ourselves and less willing
to give our wholehearted support to interests and ideas which may
he "losers." Our undue concern for our mental safety prompts us
to avoid taking a stand which we may later have to repudiate.
Only the poor sport refuses to play tennis with a more experi
enced opponent lor fear of 'losing. On the contrary, tennis players
know that their best opportunity to improve their skill lies in com- j
peting with better players. Yet we are poor sports in our mental I
activities; we accept the ideas and standards of more experienced j
experts and of our elders merely on their authority rather than on j
the merits of the ideas themselves-and their applicability to can- needs. I
We avoid active participation in Ihe game of "thinking for ourselves" j
because we would rather not play at all than risk coming out on the |
losing end, once.
We should realize that, just as physical exercise develops the body
and is beneficial quite apart from one's success in a particular match,
mental exercise is also beneficial in itself, and that increased ex
perience brings with it yie skill which we admire in others while |
afraid to strive for it ourselves. Furthermore, our "intellectuals" j
could help by being better sports, too. Instead of remaining critically
aloof from their less-experienced fellows, they could use their skill
to guide the people around them in a mutual pursuit of interests
and insights.
Many of us place loo high a value on the security of status quo,
and, by leaning too heavily on the experience of others, we forego
an important pari of life, the lesling of experience and the discovery,
for ourselves, of those Vahiesajrid standards which suit our needs i
and which are embedded in Â«|f experiences. The conclusions of our J
elders and experts should awaken our interest in mental contests |
hut they need not determine the rules by which we play. I do not |
advocale learning everything by experience; it is a truism to say ;
that one need not be burned to know that fire is hot. Yet there is a '
middle road between the foolishly conservative way and the foolishly !
radical way. a road on which we do not enthrone mental comfort ;
alongside of physical comfort and thus forego experience altogether, j
Many Stanford students make summer pilgrimages all over the !
world and return home without having rearranged their minds at all.
We should be eager to take mental journeys in conjunction with our J
physical ones, to become acquainted with ideas foreign to our safe j
and accepted beliefs and to grow and develop freely, without the ;
inhibiting, irrational fear of making mistakes. We should be at least i
as tolerant of clumsiness, mistakes and lost contests in our mental i
development as we are of such setbacks in our athletics. The results j
of enthusiastic participation in mental contests would be highly en-1
joyable and might even make us "interesting" enough to match wits j
with the current gloomy batch of cutics of Stanford life.

as tolerant of clumsiness, mistakes and lost contests in our mental i
development as we are of such setbacks in our athletics. The results j
of enthusiastic participation in mental contests would be highly en-1
joyable and might even make us "interesting" enough to match wits j
with the current gloomy batch of cutics of Stanford life.

Rehabilitation Service
Editor, The Daily:
We have recently been thinking about one person in Santa Clara
County jail. I wonder how often we think of the other hundreds of
men who are currently in prisons in this country alone. Up to 6,000
men are discharged from these prisons each year, and over 40 per!
cent of them have no homes or jobs to go to.
A voluntary rehabilitation service run by a group of local women j
tries to help these men and their families. When discharged from |
prison a clean set of clothes helps a man to find confidence to face
life again, and it will considerably improve his chances of getting a
job. This auxiliary service would like to be able to give every needy
man a clean, but not new, set of clothes. They would be very grateful
if we Stanford men could help them with their inexhaustible needs.
The auxiliary service is also opening a mobile library for pris
oners. The dreary hours that ihese men spend in prison can be
brightened by the sports magazines, paperbacks (even comics?), that
we would normally throw away.
We will be glad to receive any clean (and not worn out) clothes,
books or-magazines at-our collection -center-in the-YWCA lounge
at the top of the Women's Clubhouse.

Judicial Kuh'S
Edilor, The Daily:
It seems that a few students are misinformed ahoul the operation j
of Judicial Council, especially one Jim Siemon. In his letter to the i
editor yesterday, he stated that the Council is not hound by their
rules of procedure. If this is true, why is it that any standing rules j
of procedure for Judicial Council must he approved by Legislature?
Also, if any of these rules are ignored in* the process of a trial, the ;
defendant has the right lo appeal his case to the President of ihe
University.
The Council is elected by the student body and is entrusted with
the responsibility of administering justice to violators of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code. If you think that the members j
of Council would belie the trust placed in them, don't you believe
that the statements in the above paragraph make it binding for the
Council to follow their accepted rules?
Technically, any set of rules or constitution of any campus or
ganization when approved by Legislature make it binding upon that
organization to follow said rules to the letter. If the rules of pro
cedure for Judicial Council, Social Coordinating Board, AWS Board,
Cardinals, Political Union, IIR, Ram's Head. Pub Rel, Election Com
mission, Rally Com, etc., were included in the ASSU By-Laws you
would need a publication the size of an encyclopedia to contain them.
It is therefore in the interest of efficiency that each organization
publish its own rules with the approval of Legislature.

Intellectual Sportsmanship
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the continuous flow of statements on apathy at Stan
ford which call for an examination of the causes (why not the so
lutions?) of this situation, I should like to set forth the following
theory: our "dullness" is a result both of a late adolescent phase
of changing values and a condition of bad sportsmanship in the in
tellectual arena. Many Stanford students are in a period of their
lives during which they are re-examining (we hope!) their values
and goals, and, because their ideas are in a state of flux, they are
unsure of the purposes and consequences of. their actions. Thus, they
hesitate to act, for fear of making a mistake.
Motivated by the highest ideals, they hesitate to give a less-than
exeellent level of performance, preferring to give no performance
at all. They hesitate to commit themselves to any cause, for fear of j
flevoting their time and energy to something which may ultimately
prove unsuccessful or unworthy of the effort. Although most stu
dents would not dream of ceasing to go to football games because
the team loses, we are less charitable with ourselves and less willing
to give our wholehearted support to interests and ideas which may
he "losers." Our undue concern for our mental safety prompts us
to avoid taking a stand which we may later have to repudiate.
Only the poor sport refuses to play tennis with a more experi
enced opponent lor fear of 'losing. On the contrary, tennis players
know that their best opportunity to improve their skill lies in com- j
peting with better players. Yet we are poor sports in our mental I
activities; we accept the ideas and standards of more experienced j
experts and of our elders merely on their authority rather than on j
the merits of the ideas themselves-and their applicability to can- needs. I
We avoid active participation in Ihe game of "thinking for ourselves" j
because we would rather not play at all than risk coming out on the |
losing end, once.
We should realize that, just as physical exercise develops the body
and is beneficial quite apart from one's success in a particular match,
mental exercise is also beneficial in itself, and that increased ex
perience brings with it yie skill which we admire in others while |
afraid to strive for it ourselves. Furthermore, our "intellectuals" j
could help by being better sports, too. Instead of remaining critically
aloof from their less-experienced fellows, they could use their skill
to guide the people around them in a mutual pursuit of interests
and insights.
Many of us place loo high a value on the security of status quo,
and, by leaning too heavily on the experience of others, we forego
an important pari of life, the lesling of experience and the discovery,
for ourselves, of those Vahiesajrid standards which suit our needs i
and which are embedded in Â«|f experiences. The conclusions of our J
elders and experts should awaken our interest in mental contests |
hut they need not determine the rules by which we play. I do not |
advocale learning everything by experience; it is a truism to say ;
that one need not be burned to know that fire is hot. Yet there is a '
middle road between the foolishly conservative way and the foolishly !
radical way. a road on which we do not enthrone mental comfort ;
alongside of physical comfort and thus forego experience altogether, j
Many Stanford students make summer pilgrimages all over the !
world and return home without having rearranged their minds at all.
We should be eager to take mental journeys in conjunction with our J
physical ones, to become acquainted with ideas foreign to our safe j
and accepted beliefs and to grow and develop freely, without the ;
inhibiting, irrational fear of making mistakes. We should be at least i
as tolerant of clumsiness, mistakes and lost contests in our mental i
development as we are of such setbacks in our athletics. The results j
of enthusiastic participation in mental contests would be highly en-1
joyable and might even make us "interesting" enough to match wits j
