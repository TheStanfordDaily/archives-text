The University has established
a Nuclear Technology Laboratory
for its expanding program in nu
clear engineering. Professsor
George Leppert will head the lab
oratory which is located in the
Ryan High Voltage Laboratory
building.
A subcritical nuclear assembly,
powered *by $80,000 worth of ura
nium on loan from the Atomic
Energy Commission, is the labo
ratory's biggest piece of equip
ment. II was designed and as
sembled last year by a graduate
student, Eugene T. Jilg, under
Leppert's supervision.
The sub - critical assembly, a
"pickle barrel" type, resembles a
nuclear power reactor in its oper
ation. It will not sustain a chain
reaction, however, needs no con
trols and is save at all times. It
is believed to be the first of its
type in the West.
Other devices include a counter
room for measuring and analyz
ing radioactivity, a reactor heat
transfer research laboratory and
a machine shop.
Assisting in the teaching pro
gram is Professor Wayne S.
