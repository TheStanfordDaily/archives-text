# Cards Finish Up Against Ducks
## 
### 
The two-year plan in Stanford basketball reaches the end of its
first phase tomorrow at S p.m. when Howie Dallmar's Indians host
Oregon *in the Pavilion.
Tomorrow's final PCC battle of the year will end what has been
a year of development for the Tribe cagers. There have been enough

surprises to make the current sea-!
son a reasohably successful one,
but next year promises to be suc
cessful all the way through.
With everyone from this year's i
team set to return for the next
campaign, Stanford will experi
ence what is for all practical pur
poses a single two-year season.
Same Starters
Dallmar will start the same
fivesome against the Ducks that
has proven so effective the past
few weeks. It will line up with
Jerry Thuesen and John Arrillaga
at forwards, Dick Haga at center,
and Paul Neumann and Doug
Warren at guards.
The second unit of forwards
Chris Burfoid and John Pflueger.
center Neal Brockmeyer and
guards John Stahler and Jerry
Rose will also be ready for duty.
They've done an excellent job of
i coming in at key times and widen
ing or maintaining Stanford ad
vantages.
Fight for Sixth
The Indians and Ducks will be
fighting for sixth place in PCC
standings, although S t a n 112 or d
could get as high as fifth if it
wins and Washington upsets I'SC.
The Tribe is currently 6-9 in Coast
play, a half-game ahead of Ore
gon's 5-9 marl;. The Ducks play
at California tonight, so will prob- j
jably "Titer tomorrow's game with
a 5-10 record.
Oregon put together a tight
first-half defense and second-half
scoring splurge to top the Indians.
61-49, last month in Eugene.
Stanford, however, ranks as at
least an even choice to reverse the
count because of its surge of the
past two weeks.
3-1 Last Two Weeks
In that span, the Indians have
beaten USC, Idaho and UCLA and
have lost only to the Bruins in the
first match between t he two clubs.:
| 'Charlie Franklin constitutes the
! main Oregon threat, but he'll be

helped plenty by his teammate,
center Hal Duffy. Dale Herron,
Charlie Rask and Bud Kuykendall
are the other Webfoot starters.
Dallmar's squad will again use
its slow-down tactics and stubborn
defense in an attempt to gain its
12th win of the year against 13
defeats.
Tribe Threats
Neumann. Arrillaga and Ilaga
are the chief point threats the
first two men on outside jump
shots and Haga in close. Thuesen
and Warren have also proven ac
curate. particularly on jumpers,
although they haven't gotten as
many shots.
Neumann, the best outside de
fensive man <>n the first unit, will
attempt to hold down Franklin.
Haga, the inside specialist, draws
Duffy.
If Stanford can gain the victory,
it will successfully cap a campaign
highlighted by a win over the na
tion's No. 4 team, plus a victory
over Oregon Stateâ€”the probable
PCC co-champion.
Biggest Shock
The season's most surprising
showing came Dec. 17, when Ar
rillaga tanked a jump* shot with
five seconds to go that enabled
the Indians to upset University of
San Francisco, 50-49. It's the only
defeat the Dons have suffered this
year and stands at or near the top
among the nation's major cage
upsets.
Stanford was also a decided un
derdog against the Reavers, but
Captain Neumann and company
nearly ran them off the court,
winning 69-57.
Since that game the Cards be
gan to play consistently good ball
as the entire team gained in court
maturity. With everyone back
next season, the trend should con
tinue. And With an experienced
team opening the season instead
of closing it. the sky could well be
the limit for Stanford basketball.
