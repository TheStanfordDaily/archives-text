# New Rugby Union Works For Interest, Good Will
## 
### 
In an effort to promote Stan
ford rugby and to create good re
lationships with other teams, the
Indians ruggers have formed a
new athletic organization, the
Stanford Rugby Union.
In promoting the sport, the
Union hopes to secure far more

support from students than has
been received before this year.
Under the direction of presi
dent Tom McManus, the Union is
soliciting contributions from rug
by alumni, and has already pur
chased new uniforms. The ath
letic department was unable to
purchase the uniforms since it
had already gone over its budget
in sponsoring a game with the
Austsralian Wallabies all - star
team.
The Union already promoled
an exchange program with the
UCLA ruggers this year, where
by the Bruin players stayed in
Stanford fraternities on their
trip here earlier this winter. Get
acquainted sessions were also
held with the Uclans, and the rug
gers reported a far more sports
manlike atmosphere than had ex
isted in previous years.
