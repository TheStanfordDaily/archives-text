S t a n 112 or d's frosh basketball
team meels the strong California
Cubs tonight in the Pavilion at 6.
This tilt between the arch-rivals
will be the last of the season for
the Papooses.
Having smashed the locals, 64-53
and 51-45, in two previous starts,
Cal is in a position to do the same
tonight. Stanford's Bub Bowling
held Cal ace Earl Shultz's shoot
ing to a minimum in the last game
and will have to do Ihe same to
night.
Cub forwards Ned Averback
and Dave Stafford turned out to
be the trouble makers and will
have to be watched much better
by local starting forwards Bruce
Anderson and Gary Estabrook.
Other Cal starters center Stan
Morrison and guard Ed Pearson
will be no easy match for locals
Bob Whelan and Tom Nordland.
"We have improved since the
last game with Cal," stated Pa
poose coach Bill Turner, "but we'll
need to give this one everything
we've got to win."
At 4 p.m. before the frosh game,
the Papoose reserves will battle
the Stanford Braves. Starting
frosh guards will be Tony Moiso
and Mark Sisk; forwards, Andre
Laborde and Steve Reynard; and
center, Mike Erlin. Roger Sears
and A 1 Simila will strengthen the
frosh. while players laying out for
a year will help the Braves.
The complete frosh team has
whipped the Braves twice this
year, 69-62 and 60-58.
"I've really enjoyed working
with the entire freshman squad
this winter," revealed Turner. "It
is not only the starters but: the
•second- and third-string fellows
who come out to practice every
day that make us the 'team' that
we are."
