# Legislature Bans Dope Sheet Sale
## 
### Jack Winkler 
Sale of "The Scratch Sheet" on campus was forbidden yesterday
by the Legislature because of a misunderstanding which led to its
failure to obtain the approval of Legislature before circulation.
The new publication, first circulated on Monday for the beginning
>112 pre-registration, contained evaluations of General Studies courses,

their professors, reading lists,
papers and exams. It cost 10
cents.
According to the ASSU Consti
tution. all publications which are
not distributed free must have
the approval of Legislature be
fore they may go on sale. A
pamphlet distributed without
does not need such apt
proval.
Misunderstanding-
The Editors of "The Scratch
Sheet" went to the regular Publi
cations Board meeting on Feb. 28
o ask approval for their pam
phlet. It was approved, was
printed and was sold on campus
on Monday morning. Its first
printing of 750 copies sold out
that day.
The misunderstanding occurred
because Publications Board was
unaware that it could not give
final approval to the "Sheet" and
because its editors did not know
that the proper channels for rec
ognition included approval of
| Legislature.
When the pamphlet was circu
lated on Monday neither Publica
tions Board nor the editors of the
"Sheet" were aware of the mis
take they were making and that
such circulation was illegal.
Approval Rescinded
On Monday night, Publications
Board called a special meeting in
which it notified the editors that
the publication was being wrong
ly distributed and rescinded its
approval of the pamphlet because
of the illegality.
Publications Board also voted
i to establish a special account to
take in the receipts of the pam
phlet and to reimburse the pub
lishers for their expenses.
"The Scratch Sheet." however,
was in a second printing and the
editors announced in yesterday's
Daily that an additional 200 cop
ies would go on sale.
They were duly notified by AS
SIJ Business Manager Martin
Johnson that the circulation was
illegal and it was stopped.
