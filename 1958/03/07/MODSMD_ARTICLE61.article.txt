# Stanford Ruggers Meet Golden Bears at Home
## 
### 
A strong University of Califor
nia rugby team, fresh from a two
game split with the University of
British Columbia, will face unde
feated Stanford tomorrow at 3:30.
Eighteen lettermen from last
year's team that lost the World
Cup series to British Columbia
will make their presence known
in the Bears' lineup.
The front line figures to be the
strongest point in the Bear at
tack, with Steve Glagola, John
English. Dfck Moneymaker, Tom
Frawer, Frank Mattarocci, Mike
White and John Harrington all
having good size and experience.
Still Inexperienced
Six grad students and four Aus
trian* are listed on the rosterâ€”
which would lead one to believe

that the team would show no in
experience. However, the early
games have pointed out the fact
that the backfield still shows in
experience at this stage of the
season.
In posting a 4-0-2 record, Stan
ford has displayed a strong scrum
that should hold its own with the
highly touted forward wall of Cal
ifornia. The backfield has pro
gressed from an inexperienced
group of individuals to a smooth
ly operating unit as the season
has progressed.
Three Over Ramblers
Three of the Cards' victories
have come over the Peninsula
Ramblers, and the fourth over
the Olympic Club. Stanford has
also tied OC and UCLA.
Jim Honeywell and Dennis Cut
shaw will have to be at their
best to match the speed of the
Bear backs. Pat Vincent, a 26-
year-old veteran from C hr is t
church, New Zealand, will have
to be closely watched by the Stan
ford defense, since he has picked
up all the tricks and know-how of
the art of playing the game in his
years of play.
Tom Trutner is the toe of the
California attack. He punted,

place-kicked and narrowly missed
a 35-yard drop kick in the games
with British Columbia. Kyrk Heid
does the place kicking for Stan
ford.
In a preliminary game, the .jun
ior varsity teams of the two col
leges will meet. Stanford will
bring a 1-1-0 record into the game
against an 0-0-1 record of the Cal
Cubs. The Stanford junior varsity
has not been scored on from the
field this season, but has suffered
all year from penalties and the re
sultant penalty kicks.
