# Indian Track Season Opens; Baseballers Face FSC
## 
### Dick Barnes. Sports Editor 
Stop watches and lapo measures get their first workout of the
season tomorrow :ii 1:30 p.m., when Stanford, San Jose State and
the Santa Clara County Youth Village gather in Stanford Stadium
to open the track season.
Pay lon Jordan and Fioyd Strain have had their men hard at work
for five months preparing for tomorrow's meet and the three months
of competition which will follow it.
Gone from the 1957 team are four of the nation's outstanding
field event performers high-jumper Phil Fehlo-i, discus-thrower
Fred Peters, javelin-man Hank Roldan and ihe team's most valuable
man, broad-jumper and sprinter Frank Herrmann.
But there's also lots of taleni back for the new campaign, headed
by hurdler Chuck Cobb. A good crop of frosh join with the return
ing vets to give Jordan what should be a better-balanced team than
last year's.
Stanford's thinnest areas are the high jump, discus and javelin.
The shot-put and pole vault look to be about the same or •slightly
improved, and the broad jump shows better depth than last season
despite the lack of any one really long jumper.
On the track, the Indians look stronger in every event, although
the sprints have a lot of question marks at the present time.
Tomorrow's meet, in addition to giving a good indication of what's
in store for the Indians this spring, should be a close and exciting
battle in itself.
Laszlo Tabori, 3:59 Miler, to Run
The individual headliner is Laszlo Tabori, member of the 1956
Hungarian Olympic team and a 3:59 miler. Tabori began running
for the SCCYV this winter following a 1957 season full of misunder
standings and mishaps.
Although one of history's relatively few 4-minute milers. Tabori
is even better at longer distances. He held the world's 5000-meter
record before it was broken by Vladimir Kuts of Russia. Tabori may
run either the mile or two-mile, or both, tomorrow. He probably won't
decide until meet time.
Cobb will be the busiest Indian of the day, going in both hurdle
races, the high jump and running a leg on the 140 relay. He'll join
with Dean Smith, Norm Pease and Ben Anixter iii the sprint relay
as the Cards attempt to break '12.0. If they succeed, they'll earn a
spot in (he Texas Relays, March 28-29.
in Stanford's deep event, the broad jump, John Kelly, Kent
Hansen and Chuck Peterson all stand out. They're within an inch
of each other at the 23-9 range and could furnish the Cards with a
terrific 1-2-3 punch, if all can exceed 24 feet by midyear.
Mike Franehetti and Dick Hughes head what shows promise of
developing into a good pole vault brigade. Franehetti got up to 13-6
last year and is already far ahead of his early-season paeq of 1957;
Hughes is into the 13's now—by far his best.
DeWecsr Shows Promise in Discus
Footballtr Armand DeWeese could turn into a great asset-for
the Cards if he comes through in the discus. Peters' graduation
and Archie Schmidt's grade problems left the Indians in a big hole
in the platter event, but DeWeese is already up to 153 feet and looks
good for plenty more.
Norman Lloyd, Ernie Cunliffe and Doug Martin pace what gives
promise of being Stanford's best distance crew in years, so there
should be plenty of good news in everything .from the 880 on.
The best of the rest from San Jose and SCCYV include Olympic
pole-vaulter George Mattos, 9.4 sprinter Ray Norton, 6-1 high-jumper
Ilerm Wyatt and 440 world record-holder Jim Lea.
Following the meet, special Olympic development competition in
the hop-step-jump and hammer throw will be held on Angell Field.

in Stanford's deep event, the broad jump, John Kelly, Kent
Hansen and Chuck Peterson all stand out. They're within an inch
of each other at the 23-9 range and could furnish the Cards with a
terrific 1-2-3 punch, if all can exceed 24 feet by midyear.
Mike Franehetti and Dick Hughes head what shows promise of
developing into a good pole vault brigade. Franehetti got up to 13-6
last year and is already far ahead of his early-season paeq of 1957;
Hughes is into the 13's now—by far his best.
DeWecsr Shows Promise in Discus
Footballtr Armand DeWeese could turn into a great asset-for
the Cards if he comes through in the discus. Peters' graduation
and Archie Schmidt's grade problems left the Indians in a big hole
in the platter event, but DeWeese is already up to 153 feet and looks
good for plenty more.
Norman Lloyd, Ernie Cunliffe and Doug Martin pace what gives
promise of being Stanford's best distance crew in years, so there
should be plenty of good news in everything .from the 880 on.
The best of the rest from San Jose and SCCYV include Olympic
pole-vaulter George Mattos, 9.4 sprinter Ray Norton, 6-1 high-jumper
Ilerm Wyatt and 440 world record-holder Jim Lea.
Following the meet, special Olympic development competition in
the hop-step-jump and hammer throw will be held on Angell Field.

Stop watches and lapo measures get their first workout of the
season tomorrow :ii 1:30 p.m., when Stanford, San Jose State and
the Santa Clara County Youth Village gather in Stanford Stadium
to open the track season.
Pay lon Jordan and Fioyd Strain have had their men hard at work
for five months preparing for tomorrow's meet and the three months
of competition which will follow it.
Gone from the 1957 team are four of the nation's outstanding
field event performers high-jumper Phil Fehlo-i, discus-thrower
Fred Peters, javelin-man Hank Roldan and ihe team's most valuable
man, broad-jumper and sprinter Frank Herrmann.
But there's also lots of taleni back for the new campaign, headed
by hurdler Chuck Cobb. A good crop of frosh join with the return
ing vets to give Jordan what should be a better-balanced team than
last year's.
Stanford's thinnest areas are the high jump, discus and javelin.
The shot-put and pole vault look to be about the same or •slightly
improved, and the broad jump shows better depth than last season
despite the lack of any one really long jumper.
On the track, the Indians look stronger in every event, although
the sprints have a lot of question marks at the present time.
Tomorrow's meet, in addition to giving a good indication of what's
in store for the Indians this spring, should be a close and exciting
battle in itself.
Laszlo Tabori, 3:59 Miler, to Run
The individual headliner is Laszlo Tabori, member of the 1956
Hungarian Olympic team and a 3:59 miler. Tabori began running
for the SCCYV this winter following a 1957 season full of misunder
standings and mishaps.
Although one of history's relatively few 4-minute milers. Tabori
is even better at longer distances. He held the world's 5000-meter
record before it was broken by Vladimir Kuts of Russia. Tabori may
run either the mile or two-mile, or both, tomorrow. He probably won't
decide until meet time.
Cobb will be the busiest Indian of the day, going in both hurdle
races, the high jump and running a leg on the 140 relay. He'll join
with Dean Smith, Norm Pease and Ben Anixter iii the sprint relay
as the Cards attempt to break '12.0. If they succeed, they'll earn a
spot in (he Texas Relays, March 28-29.

Stop watches and lapo measures get their first workout of the
season tomorrow :ii 1:30 p.m., when Stanford, San Jose State and
the Santa Clara County Youth Village gather in Stanford Stadium
to open the track season.
Pay lon Jordan and Fioyd Strain have had their men hard at work
for five months preparing for tomorrow's meet and the three months
of competition which will follow it.
Gone from the 1957 team are four of the nation's outstanding
field event performers high-jumper Phil Fehlo-i, discus-thrower
Fred Peters, javelin-man Hank Roldan and ihe team's most valuable
man, broad-jumper and sprinter Frank Herrmann.
But there's also lots of taleni back for the new campaign, headed
by hurdler Chuck Cobb. A good crop of frosh join with the return
ing vets to give Jordan what should be a better-balanced team than
last year's.
Stanford's thinnest areas are the high jump, discus and javelin.
The shot-put and pole vault look to be about the same or •slightly
improved, and the broad jump shows better depth than last season
despite the lack of any one really long jumper.
On the track, the Indians look stronger in every event, although
the sprints have a lot of question marks at the present time.
Tomorrow's meet, in addition to giving a good indication of what's
in store for the Indians this spring, should be a close and exciting
battle in itself.
Laszlo Tabori, 3:59 Miler, to Run
The individual headliner is Laszlo Tabori, member of the 1956
Hungarian Olympic team and a 3:59 miler. Tabori began running
for the SCCYV this winter following a 1957 season full of misunder
standings and mishaps.
Although one of history's relatively few 4-minute milers. Tabori
is even better at longer distances. He held the world's 5000-meter
record before it was broken by Vladimir Kuts of Russia. Tabori may
run either the mile or two-mile, or both, tomorrow. He probably won't
decide until meet time.
Cobb will be the busiest Indian of the day, going in both hurdle
races, the high jump and running a leg on the 140 relay. He'll join
with Dean Smith, Norm Pease and Ben Anixter iii the sprint relay
as the Cards attempt to break '12.0. If they succeed, they'll earn a
spot in (he Texas Relays, March 28-29.
in Stanford's deep event, the broad jump, John Kelly, Kent
Hansen and Chuck Peterson all stand out. They're within an inch
of each other at the 23-9 range and could furnish the Cards with a
terrific 1-2-3 punch, if all can exceed 24 feet by midyear.
Mike Franehetti and Dick Hughes head what shows promise of
developing into a good pole vault brigade. Franehetti got up to 13-6
last year and is already far ahead of his early-season paeq of 1957;
Hughes is into the 13's now—by far his best.
DeWecsr Shows Promise in Discus
Footballtr Armand DeWeese could turn into a great asset-for
the Cards if he comes through in the discus. Peters' graduation
and Archie Schmidt's grade problems left the Indians in a big hole
in the platter event, but DeWeese is already up to 153 feet and looks
good for plenty more.
Norman Lloyd, Ernie Cunliffe and Doug Martin pace what gives
promise of being Stanford's best distance crew in years, so there
should be plenty of good news in everything .from the 880 on.
The best of the rest from San Jose and SCCYV include Olympic
pole-vaulter George Mattos, 9.4 sprinter Ray Norton, 6-1 high-jumper
Ilerm Wyatt and 440 world record-holder Jim Lea.
Following the meet, special Olympic development competition in
the hop-step-jump and hammer throw will be held on Angell Field.
