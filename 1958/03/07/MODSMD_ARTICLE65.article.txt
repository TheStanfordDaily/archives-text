# Frosh Tracksters Open Against JC's Tomorrow
## 
### 
Floyd Strain will send his frosh
track team out for the first time
this year tomorrow at 10 a.m. on
Angell Field against Stockton JC
and College of San Mateo.
The Papooses should have one

of their best teams in history if
present grades problems in sev
eral quarters can be resolved.
Leading the way for Stanford
will be half-miler Jeff Beaubier.
He blazed the 880 in 1:54.9 Tues
day, and might have gone a
couple of seconds faster had he
not gotten in strategic trouble.
Keith Wallace, the distance
sensation of the cross - country
season, is also expected to go de
spite recent illness. He seems to
have lost little in workouts since
his return, so should turn in fair
ly good clockings.
Another Papoose who will be
watched is high hurdler Bob Mar
tin. He is coming closer and
closer to the 15.0 mark, and is
showing excellent improvement
every time out.
