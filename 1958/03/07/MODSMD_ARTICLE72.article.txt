baseball squad has a busy month
ahead, including two games this
week end against Fresno State
College and an end-of the month
lour through southern California.
This afternoon Bob Leopold will
be F eh r in g's choice to si art
I against Fresno,, with Dick Wil
liams, George Avery and John Gil
lis all on hand in the bull pen
to be used if Leopold has any
trouble.
The Indians figure to have the
Same starting lineup in against
! Fresno that has rolled up four
j straight wins so far this season.
The only relatively-new comer to
I lie squad will be Jim Bulk, who
took over the starting third-base
job in the last two games and who
| will again be at the hot coiner for
| the week-end series.
Miller to Go
Tomorrow against the same
Fresno team Fehring will start
I Wally Miller on the mound, with
I the same bull pen crew sitting by.
Today's game will start at 3:15
p.m. and tomorrow's at 1 o'clock,
both at the Sunken' Diamond.
After the week-end series with
| Fresno, Stanford's basebalfers will
j have a rest over finals week, and
then starting on the 241h the
I squad will open their southern
tour with a game against San
Diego Marine Corps Recruit.
In the South
Their end-oft he-month schedule
' includes two more games at San
| Diego one against San Diego
I State College and the other with
the Camp Pendleton Marines, on
! successive days.
Following the San Diego stand,
| the Cards move into Los Angeles
j for their opening OIBA seri< ■;
j with UCLA. The two-game series,
i running the 2Kth and 291:h of the
| month, will be a real test for the
I Indians. .
j 4 Fehring hopes to use Leopold in
j one of the two games at Los An
geles, provided everything goes
well between now and then. The
other starter spot is up for grabs,
i Feb ling hopes to get a better idea
j of this pitching staff after their
live games before the UCLA se

ries. Ilf will probably use the
pitcher from among Miller, Wil
liams, C.illis and Avery who shows
lbe? most in die three S:tri Diego
lilts.
Tlx' hard hilling Indian varsity,
led l>y centei'-fielder Ben Hobinson
and second-saeker A 1 Shaw, will
find somt> tough competition in
Fresno State this week end. The
Indians have won ;;il of their four
opening games in a rather deci
;ive manner. Their last outing
was an IK-.") swamping of USF.
Bob Leopold has been, as ex
pected, the top hurler on the
squad. lie has thrown in two of
the games having allowed only
one earned run.
Phenomena) Hitting
Shaw and Hobinson have both
been hitting at a phenomenal clip
in .the early season, with Robinson
already having parked two over
the Sunken Diamond's left-field
fence. Shaw, an All-CIBA selec
tion at second l>;»sr last year, has
continued his fine style of play
this yaer. Against USF earlier
this week Shaw went four for five.
If Fehring gets some pitching
from Williams, Avery or Miller,
the team prospects down south
are very promising.

This afternoon Bob Leopold will
be F eh r in g's choice to si art
I against Fresno,, with Dick Wil

lis all on hand in the bull pen
to be used if Leopold has any
trouble.
The Indians figure to have the
Same starting lineup in against
! Fresno that has rolled up four
j straight wins so far this season.
The only relatively-new comer to
I lie squad will be Jim Bulk, who
took over the starting third-base
job in the last two games and who

Tomorrow against the same
Fresno team Fehring will start
I Wally Miller on the mound, with

Today's game will start at 3:15

j have a rest over finals week, and
then starting on the 241h the
I squad will open their southern
tour with a game against San
Diego Marine Corps Recruit.
In the South
Their end-oft he-month schedule
' includes two more games at San

I State College and the other with
the Camp Pendleton Marines, on
! successive days.
Following the San Diego stand,
| the Cards move into Los Angeles
j for their opening OIBA seri< ■;

well between now and then. The
other starter spot is up for grabs,
i Feb ling hopes to get a better idea
j of this pitching staff after their
live games before the UCLA se

pitcher from among Miller, Wil

lbe? most in die three S:tri Diego
lilts.
Tlx' hard hilling Indian varsity,
led l>y centei'-fielder Ben Hobinson

find somt> tough competition in
Fresno State this week end. The
Indians have won ;;il of their four
opening games in a rather deci
;ive manner. Their last outing
was an IK-.") swamping of USF.
Bob Leopold has been, as ex
pected, the top hurler on the
squad. lie has thrown in two of
the games having allowed only
one earned run.
Phenomena) Hitting
Shaw and Hobinson have both
been hitting at a phenomenal clip
in .the early season, with Robinson
already having parked two over
the Sunken Diamond's left-field
fence. Shaw, an All-CIBA selec
tion at second l>;»sr last year, has
continued his fine style of play
this yaer. Against USF earlier
this week Shaw went four for five.
If Fehring gets some pitching

Miller to Go
Tomorrow against the same
Fresno team Fehring will start
I Wally Miller on the mound, with

Today's game will start at 3:15

After the week-end series with

Their end-oft he-month schedule
' includes two more games at San

I State College and the other with

! successive days.
Following the San Diego stand,

well between now and then. The
other starter spot is up for grabs,
i Feb ling hopes to get a better idea
j of this pitching staff after their

lbe? most in die three S:tri Diego
lilts.
Tlx' hard hilling Indian varsity,
led l>y centei'-fielder Ben Hobinson
and second-saeker A 1 Shaw, will
find somt> tough competition in
Fresno State this week end. The
Indians have won ;;il of their four
opening games in a rather deci
;ive manner. Their last outing
was an IK-.") swamping of USF.
Bob Leopold has been, as ex
pected, the top hurler on the
squad. lie has thrown in two of
the games having allowed only
one earned run.
Phenomena) Hitting
Shaw and Hobinson have both
been hitting at a phenomenal clip
in .the early season, with Robinson

the Sunken Diamond's left-field
fence. Shaw, an All-CIBA selec
tion at second l>;»sr last year, has
continued his fine style of play
this yaer. Against USF earlier
this week Shaw went four for five.
If Fehring gets some pitching
from Williams, Avery or Miller,
the team prospects down south
are very promising.
