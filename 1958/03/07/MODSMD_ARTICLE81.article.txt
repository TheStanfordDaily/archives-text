# Police Blotter
## 
### 
The campus police department
has two end-of-quarter announce
ments concerning unpaid parking
violations and unclaimed bicycles.
Parking violation tags have
been ignored or overlooked by
several students, and although
reminders have been mailed, the
fines have not been paid.
A schedule of fines is printed
on the back of each ticket, and
Chief of Police Gordon Davis
points out that if fines are left
unpaid at the end of the quarter,
there will be a $5 charge.
' The unpaid violation will be re
ported to the cashier's office, and
no registration or grades will be
given the ticket holders until the
delinquent fines are paid.
Students who are missing bi
cycles are urged to check with
the police, for their vehicles may
be among the 18 now at the sta
tion office. There are six wom
en's bicycles and 12 men's. Stu
dents may claim their property
upon identification.
