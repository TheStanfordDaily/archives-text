## 'Copter Awaits Weather Break 
### Barbara Hicks 
Heavy snow and wind are ham
pering rescue operations for four
21-year-old Stanford students who
are stranded 11.500 feet high in
the Sierra Mountains of Yosemite
National Park.
One of the four, William Pope,
564 Mayfield, from San Francisco,
is believed seriously ill with pneu
monia. With him are Lenore
Lamb, 21, Guthrie House, from
Orinda; Margaret Meyer, Guthrie,
from Seattle; and Mike Roberts,
2158 Williams Street, Palo Alto,
from Neenah, Wis.
Chief Park Ranger Oscar Seder
gren told The Daily last night that
the forecast is for a short break
in the weather this morning and
again this afternoon. He said an
Army helicopter is waiting at El
Portal, on the edge of the park,
less than an hour's flight from
the four's snow - piled camp on
Lyell Peak.
Chief Warrant Officer John J.
Cooney flew the big two-engined
helicopter from Fresno to El Por
tal last night, but said an abating
storm's low ceiling blocked his
Fort Ord helicopter from getting
into the park valley.
When the weather breaks, Coo
ney will fly two paramedics to the
campsite and try to bring out the
four students.
Sedergren said snow and wind
slowed the progress of the ground
rescue crew which set out yester
day for the skiers' camp. They
were expected to reach Merced
Lake, halfway to the camp, last
night, but storms interfered. They
now hope to reach the camp to
morrow evening. A second ground
team is scheduled to leave today.
Bob Symons of Bishop, pilot of
a small ski plane, flew over the
Mt. Lyell site late Saturday and
•said the students had not marked
out any message in the snow.
He dropped a message instruct
ing the students to stamp out the
letter "O" if they were in need of
oxygen, but they did not answer.
Supplies including food, bedding,
fuel, antibiotics and a toboggan
were dropped to the stranded stu
dents.
Rescue operations were begun
originally when Bart H(soley, 22,
740 Santa Ynez, from Reno, and
Max Allen, 22. University of Cali
fornia, headed for the park ranger
station Friday to ask for help.
They had started the trek across
the Sierras with the other four
March 22. On Thursday, when it
became apparent that Pope could
go no farther, Hooley and Allen
skied out to get help for the ailing
student.
In a phoned interview with The
Daily last night Allen said he and
Hooley had had good skiing con
ditions on their way out of the
mountains and made the trip in
a day and a half.
"Pope started feeling bad about
the third day out," Allen said. He
explained that all six members of
the group suffered somewhat in
the high altitude, and at first this
was thought to be Pope's trouble.
The others, however, became ac
climated to the altitude, while
Pope continued to get worse.
"On Wednesday Pope was so
sick he could only move a few foot
and then he'd fall," Allen said.
Hooley and Allen left the camp
ers a five-day supply of food,
bringing just enough vvilh them
to get out of the mountains. Since
then air drops have augmented
their supply.
Allen and Hooley are being kepi
in the Lewis Memorial Hospital in
Yosemite. Allen said a physician
there told them Ihey had dilated
hearts, an enlargement, of the
heart caused by overexertion.
They expert to be released to
morrow.

mountains and made the trip in
a day and a half.
"Pope started feeling bad about
the third day out," Allen said. He
explained that all six members of
the group suffered somewhat in
the high altitude, and at first this
was thought to be Pope's trouble.
The others, however, became ac
climated to the altitude, while
Pope continued to get worse.
"On Wednesday Pope was so
sick he could only move a few foot
and then he'd fall," Allen said.
Hooley and Allen left the camp
ers a five-day supply of food,
bringing just enough vvilh them
to get out of the mountains. Since
then air drops have augmented
their supply.
Allen and Hooley are being kepi
in the Lewis Memorial Hospital in
Yosemite. Allen said a physician
there told them Ihey had dilated
hearts, an enlargement, of the
heart caused by overexertion.

Heavy snow and wind are ham
pering rescue operations for four
21-year-old Stanford students who
are stranded 11.500 feet high in
the Sierra Mountains of Yosemite
National Park.
One of the four, William Pope,
564 Mayfield, from San Francisco,
is believed seriously ill with pneu
monia. With him are Lenore
Lamb, 21, Guthrie House, from
Orinda; Margaret Meyer, Guthrie,
from Seattle; and Mike Roberts,
2158 Williams Street, Palo Alto,
from Neenah, Wis.
Chief Park Ranger Oscar Seder
gren told The Daily last night that
the forecast is for a short break
in the weather this morning and
again this afternoon. He said an
Army helicopter is waiting at El
Portal, on the edge of the park,
less than an hour's flight from
the four's snow - piled camp on
Lyell Peak.
Chief Warrant Officer John J.
Cooney flew the big two-engined
helicopter from Fresno to El Por
tal last night, but said an abating
storm's low ceiling blocked his
Fort Ord helicopter from getting
into the park valley.
When the weather breaks, Coo
ney will fly two paramedics to the
campsite and try to bring out the
four students.
Sedergren said snow and wind
slowed the progress of the ground
rescue crew which set out yester
day for the skiers' camp. They
were expected to reach Merced
Lake, halfway to the camp, last
night, but storms interfered. They
now hope to reach the camp to
morrow evening. A second ground
team is scheduled to leave today.
Bob Symons of Bishop, pilot of
a small ski plane, flew over the
Mt. Lyell site late Saturday and
•said the students had not marked
out any message in the snow.
He dropped a message instruct
ing the students to stamp out the
letter "O" if they were in need of
oxygen, but they did not answer.
Supplies including food, bedding,
fuel, antibiotics and a toboggan
were dropped to the stranded stu
dents.
Rescue operations were begun
originally when Bart H(soley, 22,
740 Santa Ynez, from Reno, and
Max Allen, 22. University of Cali
fornia, headed for the park ranger
station Friday to ask for help.
They had started the trek across
the Sierras with the other four
March 22. On Thursday, when it
became apparent that Pope could
go no farther, Hooley and Allen
skied out to get help for the ailing
student.
In a phoned interview with The
Daily last night Allen said he and
Hooley had had good skiing con
ditions on their way out of the
mountains and made the trip in
