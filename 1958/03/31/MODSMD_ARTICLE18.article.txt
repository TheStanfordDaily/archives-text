"This class is certainly lousy," said the omni
present voice-from-l he-back-of-t he-room.
But. this time Ihe voice wasn't being imperti
nent. He was right. The class was entomology
at the University of Kansas, and Ihe professor
was giving each student a louse of his own.
The lice were bacteria-free, said the prof, and
anyone who wanted to let a louse feed on his arm
could do so.
"In fact," said he, "we'll have a little contest
to see whose louse starts feeding first."
Reported the Daily Kansan. it was a 2-second
tie between the prof's louse and one whose master
was a sophomore.

Fair observation, Lobo.
