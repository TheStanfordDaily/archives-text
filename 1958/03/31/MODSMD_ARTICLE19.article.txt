Editor, Tlx 1 Daily:
As parents of a freshman, we were amused in
coming across the following advice lo freshmen,
which appeared on page 225 of the Stanford
Quad for the year 1900. The last line seems par
licularly appropriate:
"POOR BILL'S ADVTCE EOR FRESITMEN"
(With rlue apologies)
"Swell not thy head; it may be 100 large to
pass in at Ihe Registrar's door.
"Employ thy pull well, if thou meanest to gain
credits! and
"Since thou art not sure of Iby learning, culti
vate thy drag!
"Dost thou think thy collar tall? Sit down and
write for Ihyself an honest epitaph.
"Digging is (lie mother of good ex's, as poor
Bill says, bul your Prof loves above all things
a smooth explanation.
"If Ihou lives! in the Camp and ealest not, pon
der, wilh Fpietetus, il is a thing without Iby
will grieve not because of il.
"Despair nol because Ihou are not a poet; nor
wrappest upon thy brow Ihe laurel, nor feedest
upon the plaudits of Ihe multitude; thou may'st
some day wrap thyself in a new coal, place upon
thy brow a hat, and feed thyself upon Ihrce
squares.
"Play nol at poker by the two o'clock candle,
thy blanket hung over Iby transom, thy coat
east down at ihy door sill: Thou shalt lose Ihy
gold, Ihy regard for Ihy friend, and thy appro
rial ion of the sunshine; thou shalt gain many
hard thinks and many new swear words which
thou shall say softly lo thyself when Ihy laun
diyman sends thee a bill.
"From Mayfield to Heaven is a far cry.
"It is hard for a hot fire lo keep cool."

Editor, The Daily:
Is our academic life too strenuous? Well, yes
and no. Yes, in its present form it is an awesome
grind, hut I don't think it need he.
What makes the load so difficult? The study,
the time? I don't Ihink so. What makes il so
strenuous is the fact that we all know we're be
ing graded, and on the curve, too.
What has this got to rlo with it? Let's consider
the effects of the curve. Each student knows lie's
in competition with his neighbor. Consequently
any little bit of knowledge he picks up he quickly
shields wilh "Gosh, I don't get it," or if he's nol
your friend he just gives you a dull stare and
mumbles something about the Honor Code.
This 1 o me is the basis of much of our aca
demic difficulty. I had once heard that a uni
versity is a place where people come to exchange
ideas. Wilh the curve, if a guy has an idea he
quickly stores it away to save for a test. There
is no exchange and no mutual interest or help.
To me this is a terrible shame.
So many of our classes are so big that the
only place we can gel personal help or bring out
our ideas is wilh a tutor. These are rather ex
pensive and may lend lo be impersonal so a I<>l
of the value of idea exchange is lost.
Oh, some will say that collaboration will be
come too extensive we'll even have il on tests.
►Sure, this may happen a liltle, but if we really
believe Stanford students are just a little better,
then this should not be a problem.
When one stops and analyzes the curve and the
grading system 1 don't Ihink one can come up
wilh any other conclusion lhan that it is to
"help" Stanford students be superior and stay on
their honor.
Often one slarts a course wilh much enthu
siasm, only to get confused and lost. When 1 his
happens, the objective of the course, to learn
something, is soon forgotten and it becomes a
si niggle lo get a passing grade, and one doesn't
care what one learns.

As parents of a freshman, we were amused in

which appeared on page 225 of the Stanford
Quad for the year 1900. The last line seems par
licularly appropriate:
"POOR BILL'S ADVTCE EOR FRESITMEN"
(With rlue apologies)
"Swell not thy head; it may be 100 large to
pass in at Ihe Registrar's door.
"Employ thy pull well, if thou meanest to gain
credits! and
"Since thou art not sure of Iby learning, culti
vate thy drag!
"Dost thou think thy collar tall? Sit down and
write for Ihyself an honest epitaph.
"Digging is (lie mother of good ex's, as poor
Bill says, bul your Prof loves above all things
a smooth explanation.
"If Ihou lives! in the Camp and ealest not, pon
der, wilh Fpietetus, il is a thing without Iby
will grieve not because of il.
"Despair nol because Ihou are not a poet; nor
wrappest upon thy brow Ihe laurel, nor feedest
upon the plaudits of Ihe multitude; thou may'st
some day wrap thyself in a new coal, place upon
thy brow a hat, and feed thyself upon Ihrce
squares.
"Play nol at poker by the two o'clock candle,
thy blanket hung over Iby transom, thy coat
east down at ihy door sill: Thou shalt lose Ihy
gold, Ihy regard for Ihy friend, and thy appro
rial ion of the sunshine; thou shalt gain many
hard thinks and many new swear words which
thou shall say softly lo thyself when Ihy laun
diyman sends thee a bill.
"From Mayfield to Heaven is a far cry.
"It is hard for a hot fire lo keep cool."

Is our academic life too strenuous? Well, yes
and no. Yes, in its present form it is an awesome
grind, hut I don't think it need he.
What makes the load so difficult? The study,
the time? I don't Ihink so. What makes il so
strenuous is the fact that we all know we're be
ing graded, and on the curve, too.
What has this got to rlo with it? Let's consider
the effects of the curve. Each student knows lie's
in competition with his neighbor. Consequently
any little bit of knowledge he picks up he quickly
shields wilh "Gosh, I don't get it," or if he's nol
your friend he just gives you a dull stare and
mumbles something about the Honor Code.
This 1 o me is the basis of much of our aca
demic difficulty. I had once heard that a uni
versity is a place where people come to exchange
ideas. Wilh the curve, if a guy has an idea he
quickly stores it away to save for a test. There
is no exchange and no mutual interest or help.
To me this is a terrible shame.
So many of our classes are so big that the
only place we can gel personal help or bring out
our ideas is wilh a tutor. These are rather ex
pensive and may lend lo be impersonal so a I<>l
of the value of idea exchange is lost.
Oh, some will say that collaboration will be

This 1 o me is the basis of much of our aca
demic difficulty. I had once heard that a uni
versity is a place where people come to exchange
ideas. Wilh the curve, if a guy has an idea he
quickly stores it away to save for a test. There
is no exchange and no mutual interest or help.
To me this is a terrible shame.
So many of our classes are so big that the
only place we can gel personal help or bring out
our ideas is wilh a tutor. These are rather ex
pensive and may lend lo be impersonal so a I<>l
of the value of idea exchange is lost.
Oh, some will say that collaboration will be
come too extensive we'll even have il on tests.
►Sure, this may happen a liltle, but if we really
believe Stanford students are just a little better,
then this should not be a problem.
When one stops and analyzes the curve and the
grading system 1 don't Ihink one can come up
wilh any other conclusion lhan that it is to
"help" Stanford students be superior and stay on
their honor.
Often one slarts a course wilh much enthu
siasm, only to get confused and lost. When 1 his
happens, the objective of the course, to learn
something, is soon forgotten and it becomes a
si niggle lo get a passing grade, and one doesn't
care what one learns.

Swell Not Thy Ilea,l
Editor, Tlx 1 Daily:
As parents of a freshman, we were amused in
coming across the following advice lo freshmen,
which appeared on page 225 of the Stanford
Quad for the year 1900. The last line seems par
licularly appropriate:
"POOR BILL'S ADVTCE EOR FRESITMEN"
(With rlue apologies)
"Swell not thy head; it may be 100 large to
pass in at Ihe Registrar's door.
"Employ thy pull well, if thou meanest to gain
credits! and
"Since thou art not sure of Iby learning, culti
vate thy drag!
"Dost thou think thy collar tall? Sit down and
write for Ihyself an honest epitaph.
"Digging is (lie mother of good ex's, as poor
Bill says, bul your Prof loves above all things
a smooth explanation.
"If Ihou lives! in the Camp and ealest not, pon
der, wilh Fpietetus, il is a thing without Iby
will grieve not because of il.
"Despair nol because Ihou are not a poet; nor
wrappest upon thy brow Ihe laurel, nor feedest
upon the plaudits of Ihe multitude; thou may'st
some day wrap thyself in a new coal, place upon
thy brow a hat, and feed thyself upon Ihrce
squares.
"Play nol at poker by the two o'clock candle,
thy blanket hung over Iby transom, thy coat
east down at ihy door sill: Thou shalt lose Ihy
gold, Ihy regard for Ihy friend, and thy appro
rial ion of the sunshine; thou shalt gain many
hard thinks and many new swear words which
thou shall say softly lo thyself when Ihy laun
diyman sends thee a bill.
"From Mayfield to Heaven is a far cry.
"It is hard for a hot fire lo keep cool."
Ric hard IF. Forster

Exchange of Ideas
Editor, The Daily:
Is our academic life too strenuous? Well, yes
and no. Yes, in its present form it is an awesome
grind, hut I don't think it need he.
What makes the load so difficult? The study,
the time? I don't Ihink so. What makes il so
strenuous is the fact that we all know we're be
ing graded, and on the curve, too.
What has this got to rlo with it? Let's consider
the effects of the curve. Each student knows lie's
in competition with his neighbor. Consequently
any little bit of knowledge he picks up he quickly
shields wilh "Gosh, I don't get it," or if he's nol
your friend he just gives you a dull stare and
mumbles something about the Honor Code.
This 1 o me is the basis of much of our aca
demic difficulty. I had once heard that a uni
versity is a place where people come to exchange
