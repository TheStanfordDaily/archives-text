## 
### Steve Baffrey 
Dutch Fehring's Stanford Indians gave themselves reason to forget
their final three exhibition game losses of last week when they over
turned the UCLA Bruins in ihe opening games of the 1958 California
Intercollegiate Baseball Association Friday and Saturday in the
Southland.
The Fehringmen, behind after five innings, 3-2, burst forth with

a big, four-run sixth in their Sat
urday game and then went on to
coast to a 7-4 victory. On Friday
ihey encountered little trouble in
blanking the Uclans, 3-0.
Wally Miller opened on the
mound for the Cards in the 7-4
triumph but gave way to Dick
Williams in the fifth after allow
ing the Bruins their- third and
fourth runs. Williams gave up
three hits, all for extra bases, but
controlled himself well in gain
ing the win.
Four Runs
In their big sixth the Indians
put together singles by right
fielder Rich Defabio, left fielder
Parker Olsen, Williams and third
baseman Jim Burk, a sacrifice
bunt by shortstop Wayne Marion,
a hit batsman and a Bruin mis
cue to drive home the quartet of
markers.
The Cards brought home two
runs in the second after second
baseman Al Shaw tripled and
scored on Delabio's single. De
fabio stole second and scored on
a one-baser by Marion. Succes
sive doubles by Burk and Robin
son tallied the final run in the
eighth.
Two Hits
Card southpaw Bob Leopold
threw a masterful two-hitter at
the Bruins on Friday while facing
IJclan football and punting ace
Kirk Wilson. He looked like he
owned the Smoggers and served
up nothing they could smack lips
or bats at.
He was in trouble twice,
though. With one out in the fifth
he loaded the bases on walks but
a foul out and a force play saved
him. In the eighth he walked the
first two batters, but came back
to strike out Ihe next two, and
got the third to fly out.
After threatening in the first
the Indians had their big frame
in the third. With one out New
kirk walked, Robinson singled
him to second, and both then
scored on Holding's triple. Hold
ing was out trying to stretch it to
four bases.
In the sixth they chalked up
the final run when Marion got on
base by an error, was sacrificed
to second and scored on Leopold's
single.

mound for the Cards in the 7-4
triumph but gave way to Dick
Williams in the fifth after allow
ing the Bruins their- third and
fourth runs. Williams gave up
three hits, all for extra bases, but
controlled himself well in gain

Two Hits
Card southpaw Bob Leopold
threw a masterful two-hitter at
the Bruins on Friday while facing
IJclan football and punting ace
Kirk Wilson. He looked like he
owned the Smoggers and served
up nothing they could smack lips
or bats at.
He was in trouble twice,
though. With one out in the fifth
he loaded the bases on walks but
a foul out and a force play saved
him. In the eighth he walked the
first two batters, but came back
to strike out Ihe next two, and
got the third to fly out.
After threatening in the first
the Indians had their big frame
in the third. With one out New
kirk walked, Robinson singled
him to second, and both then
scored on Holding's triple. Hold
ing was out trying to stretch it to
four bases.
In the sixth they chalked up
the final run when Marion got on
base by an error, was sacrificed
to second and scored on Leopold's
single.
