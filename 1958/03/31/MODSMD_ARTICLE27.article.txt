# Spikers 3rd in Texas
## 
### 
Maury Graves broke the Stan
ford school record and Texas Re
lays mark as he raced two miles
in 9:04.9 Friday at Austin.
Graves' performance was the
highlight of an Indian team ef
fort that netted them 58 points
and third place in the 31st annual
Texas Relays.
Graves finished five yards in
front of the field of 27 distance
stars in running by far the best
race of his career. He cracked his
own school mark of 9:08.9, sot
two years ago, and smashed the
meet mark of 9:29, established in
1957.
Two Seconds
A pair of Stanford relay teams
took second places in record
breaking races. Friday, the sprint
medley team of Don Chesarek,
Chuck Cobb, Dean Smith and Er
nie Cunlifl'e ran second to Cali
fornia as the Bears unofficially
broke the world record in the
event.
The Cards turned in individual
splits of 47.4, 21.7, 21.9 and
1:50.9 for a total time of 3:21.9.
It was by far their best efforts
of the young season.
Cal was home in 3:19.8 for the
new mark as Don Bowden ripped
off a closing 880 of 1:49.1.
Stanford finished second to Cal
again in the four-man two-mile

with a 7:10.6 clocking. Chesarek
ran 1:57.3, Dick Lassen clocked
1:54.8. Norman Lloyd hit 1:52.3
and Cunliffe finished in 1:56.2 in
the final event of the program.

Cal's now record of 7:30.8 was
sparked by Bowden's 1:50 anchor
half.
The distance medley quartet of
Chesarek, Lassen, Graves and
Lloyd finished fourth in 10:02.1,
the fastest docking ever made by
a Stanford team. The splits of
48.2, 1:53.4. 3:06.4 and 4:15.1 all
represented good efforts by the
Indians.
Lloyd was particularly ham
pered in his closing mile, since he
had to go the first three laps in
3:06.1 to narrow the gap between
Stanford and the leaders.
Best flumps
Kent Hansen and John Kelly
each got off their best ever broad
jumps in placing 5-7. Hansen
leaped 21-land barely crowed
at 24-9, while Kelly had an offi
cial jump of 23.6 and a foul at
24-4.
Cobb picked up the remaining
points with a narrow third in the
120 high hurdles, fit 1 ran the final
in 14.0, one-tenth behind the win
ner, Olympic champion Glenn
Davis of Ohio State. Cobb ran
14.2 in a heat, but hit three hur
dles in the final as a strong wind
bothered all the runners.
Kansas won the team title with
103 points to completely swamp
the field. Texas nipped Stanford
for second with 64 points.

120 high hurdles, fit 1 ran the final
in 14.0, one-tenth behind the win
ner, Olympic champion Glenn
Davis of Ohio State. Cobb ran
14.2 in a heat, but hit three hur
dles in the final as a strong wind
bothered all the runners.
Kansas won the team title with
103 points to completely swamp
the field. Texas nipped Stanford
for second with 64 points.
Maury Graves broke the Stan
ford school record and Texas Re
lays mark as he raced two miles
in 9:04.9 Friday at Austin.
Graves' performance was the
highlight of an Indian team ef
fort that netted them 58 points
and third place in the 31st annual
Texas Relays.
Graves finished five yards in
front of the field of 27 distance
stars in running by far the best
race of his career. He cracked his
own school mark of 9:08.9, sot
two years ago, and smashed the
meet mark of 9:29, established in
1957.
Two Seconds
A pair of Stanford relay teams
took second places in record
breaking races. Friday, the sprint
medley team of Don Chesarek,
Chuck Cobb, Dean Smith and Er
nie Cunlifl'e ran second to Cali
fornia as the Bears unofficially
broke the world record in the
event.
The Cards turned in individual
splits of 47.4, 21.7, 21.9 and
1:50.9 for a total time of 3:21.9.
It was by far their best efforts
of the young season.
Cal was home in 3:19.8 for the
new mark as Don Bowden ripped
off a closing 880 of 1:49.1.
Stanford finished second to Cal
again in the four-man two-mile

with a 7:10.6 clocking. Chesarek
ran 1:57.3, Dick Lassen clocked
1:54.8. Norman Lloyd hit 1:52.3
and Cunliffe finished in 1:56.2 in
the final event of the program.

Cal's now record of 7:30.8 was
sparked by Bowden's 1:50 anchor
half.
The distance medley quartet of
Chesarek, Lassen, Graves and
Lloyd finished fourth in 10:02.1,
the fastest docking ever made by
a Stanford team. The splits of
48.2, 1:53.4. 3:06.4 and 4:15.1 all
represented good efforts by the
Indians.
Lloyd was particularly ham
pered in his closing mile, since he
had to go the first three laps in
3:06.1 to narrow the gap between
Stanford and the leaders.
Best flumps
Kent Hansen and John Kelly
each got off their best ever broad
jumps in placing 5-7. Hansen
leaped 21-land barely crowed
at 24-9, while Kelly had an offi

24-4.
Cobb picked up the remaining
points with a narrow third in the
