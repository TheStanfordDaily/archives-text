# PCC Defeats Free Ride; Stanford Still in League
## 
### 
Another Pacific Coast Confer
ence meeting has come and gone,
and Stanford still remains in
what will soon be a six-team cir
cuit. Representatives of the pres
ent nine member schools met in
San Francisco in mid • March to
discuss proposals for changing
provisions of the aid-to-athletes
regulations.
The principal proposal — one
which would have committed the
league to a virtual free-ride pol
icy was defeated, leaving the
PCC with its present set of tui
tion and job allowances.
Indications prior to the meet
ing were that Stanford would

Join USC. UCLA and California
in bolting the league if the free
ride plan were approved.
But the fact that the circuit de
cided to maintain the present aid
philosophy has led to a general
opinion that the Indians would
stay in the loop—at least until
the pros and cons of remaining
with the five Northwest schools
can be weighed further.
