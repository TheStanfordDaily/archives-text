The first temptation is to call
"A Death in the Family" a most
beautiful, compelling, successful
novel, but on second thought one
realizes that such superlatives
are, paradoxically, the weakest
kind of expression, which as most
but vaguely express the review
er's state of mind.
And so with a tight hold on my
enthusiasm I will try to say sim
ply what the novel is about and
as space permits let James Agee's
presentation speak for itself.
The title is exactly descriptive
of the subject. Jay Follet, the
head of a loving, close-knit fam
ily, father of two small children,
is killed iir an automobile acci
dent. He is a perfect physical
specimen and in the prime of life.
He is responsible, loved and re
spected.
Basic Meanings
The novelist probes at the basic
meanings of the accidental. Why?
Why this person at this time?
Why should the responsible, de
voted son, husband and father
die as a consequence of a tiny
cotter pin lost from the steering
mechanism of an expensive mo
tor vehicle? As with any fatal
accident or other unnatural
death, an immediate answer is
discoverable in the laws of phys
ics. But the people of this story
cannot be satisfied with an ex
planation in terms of immediate
physical causes.
Why does this man die when he
is returning from an emergency,
middle - of - the - night visit to his
own stricken father? A visit re
sulting from the drunken panic
of an irresponsible brother. The
strong and decent man is killed
by the irrational behavior of a
weak man and the highly unlike
ly failure of a steering mecha
nism.
The irony is further compound
ed by the exact nature of the
fatal blow. The point of Jay
Follet's chin strikes the hub of
the steering whel precisely and
sharply. Concussion of the brain
is immediate and fatal. The car
climbs an embankment, the driv
er is thrown clear, the car rolls
back and turns over, and lies pre
cisely beside the body which is
unmaimed and absolutely dead.

If the blow on the chin had land
ed an inch to the right or left, the
result would have been only in
jury, more or less serious.
Compounding of Ironies
That this compounding of iro
nies, by way of stressing the
senselessness of life and death,
becomes believable, gripping and
significant is the measure of
Agee's narrative art. In our own
lives and in newspaper accounts
we must accept such irony be
cause there is no denying it.
But in dramatic art we demand
probability. We must be made to
believe in what we instinctively
recoil from. Age establishes and
sustains an atmosphere and pre
sents the action so that the in
credible becomes not just credible
but almost inevitable.
The death of Jay Follet, how
ever, is merely the point of de
parture for the main interest of
the story, which is in the various
responses of the bereaved. The
question becomes, What does a
death in the family mean to those
who must go on living: wife,
children, parents, in - laws and
friends? The problem is explored
in religious and metaphysical
terms in that the members of the
family are vigorous either in
their belief or disbelief. The at
titudes range from the strongly
orthodox high Episcopalianism of
the wife and her sister to the
angry Hardy - like pessimism of
their father.
The Violent Event
As in classical tragedy the vio
lent event occurs off-stage. The
focus is on the narrator and the
members of the family who com
prise his audience. Thus, the em
phasis falls not on the event it
self but rather on its meaning
and effect. The power of this
major scene is greatly enhanced
by the presence of the nearly
deaf grandmother to whom ev
erything must be recited slowly,
clearly and emphatically. The fol
lowing passage will illustrate the
dramatic usefulness of this de
vice:

"Andrew said to his mother,
'Papa says, Do they have any
idea how it happened?' She nod
ded and tilted her trumpet near
er his mouth. 'They showed me.
They found that a cotter pin had
worked loose —this cotter pin had
fallen out, that held the steering
mechanism together.
"'See here,' he said; he had
locked a bent knuckle between
the two bent knuckles of the oth
er hand. 'As if it were to hold
these knuckles together—see?"'
" 'Yes. "
" 'It's sort of like a very heavy
hairpin. You understand?'"
" 'No matter.'"
Setting, Period
The story is set in Knoxville,
Tennessee, in the early years of
the automobile age. But setting
and period are of no special im
portance. The book is not mainly
sociological or historical. Nor is
it Southern in the way that the
works of Faulkner and Warren
are Southern. It searches for
meaning in the irrational and in
scrutable, explores the grounds
of faith or lack of faith. It deals
with the ultimate questions of
life and death.
James Agee died at 45 in the
midst of an active and versatile
career as poet, novelist and mov
ie scenarist.
I can raise but one minor ob
jection to this nearly flawless
novel, and the editors must
shoulder the blame for this. They
have interjected between the
parts of the novel several long
passages of prose lyricism from
Agee's unpublished manuscripts.
While very impressive in them
selves, these passages are not
properly a part of this novel.
They are an intrusion and inter
ruption to the story. While we
may be glad that these fine pas
sages are published, I would sug
gest that they be read separately
before or after the story proper.

is immediate and fatal. The car
climbs an embankment, the driv

we must accept such irony be

credible becomes not just credible

The death of Jay Follet, how

responses of the bereaved. The

who must go on living: wife,
children, parents, in - laws and
friends? The problem is explored
in religious and metaphysical
terms in that the members of the
family are vigorous either in
their belief or disbelief. The at
titudes range from the strongly
orthodox high Episcopalianism of
the wife and her sister to the
angry Hardy - like pessimism of
their father.
The Violent Event
As in classical tragedy the vio
lent event occurs off-stage. The
focus is on the narrator and the
members of the family who com
prise his audience. Thus, the em
phasis falls not on the event it
self but rather on its meaning
and effect. The power of this
major scene is greatly enhanced
by the presence of the nearly
deaf grandmother to whom ev
erything must be recited slowly,
clearly and emphatically. The fol
lowing passage will illustrate the
dramatic usefulness of this de
vice:

"Andrew said to his mother,
'Papa says, Do they have any
idea how it happened?' She nod
ded and tilted her trumpet near
er his mouth. 'They showed me.
They found that a cotter pin had
worked loose —this cotter pin had
fallen out, that held the steering
mechanism together.

locked a bent knuckle between
the two bent knuckles of the oth
er hand. 'As if it were to hold
these knuckles together—see?"'
" 'Yes. "
" 'It's sort of like a very heavy
hairpin. You understand?'"
" 'No matter.'"
Setting, Period
The story is set in Knoxville,
Tennessee, in the early years of
the automobile age. But setting
and period are of no special im
portance. The book is not mainly
sociological or historical. Nor is
it Southern in the way that the
works of Faulkner and Warren
are Southern. It searches for
meaning in the irrational and in
scrutable, explores the grounds
of faith or lack of faith. It deals
with the ultimate questions of
life and death.
James Agee died at 45 in the

I can raise but one minor ob
jection to this nearly flawless

have interjected between the
parts of the novel several long
passages of prose lyricism from

The first temptation is to call
"A Death in the Family" a most
beautiful, compelling, successful
novel, but on second thought one
realizes that such superlatives
are, paradoxically, the weakest
kind of expression, which as most
but vaguely express the review
er's state of mind.
And so with a tight hold on my
enthusiasm I will try to say sim
ply what the novel is about and
as space permits let James Agee's
presentation speak for itself.
The title is exactly descriptive
of the subject. Jay Follet, the
head of a loving, close-knit fam
ily, father of two small children,
is killed iir an automobile acci
dent. He is a perfect physical
specimen and in the prime of life.
He is responsible, loved and re

Basic Meanings
The novelist probes at the basic
meanings of the accidental. Why?
Why this person at this time?
Why should the responsible, de
voted son, husband and father
die as a consequence of a tiny
cotter pin lost from the steering
mechanism of an expensive mo
tor vehicle? As with any fatal
accident or other unnatural
death, an immediate answer is
discoverable in the laws of phys
ics. But the people of this story
cannot be satisfied with an ex
planation in terms of immediate
physical causes.
Why does this man die when he
is returning from an emergency,
middle - of - the - night visit to his
own stricken father? A visit re
sulting from the drunken panic
of an irresponsible brother. The
strong and decent man is killed
by the irrational behavior of a
weak man and the highly unlike
ly failure of a steering mecha
nism.
The irony is further compound

fatal blow. The point of Jay

is immediate and fatal. The car

sociological or historical. Nor is
it Southern in the way that the
works of Faulkner and Warren

of faith or lack of faith. It deals
with the ultimate questions of
life and death.

have interjected between the

The first temptation is to call
"A Death in the Family" a most
beautiful, compelling, successful
novel, but on second thought one
realizes that such superlatives
are, paradoxically, the weakest
kind of expression, which as most
but vaguely express the review
er's state of mind.
And so with a tight hold on my
enthusiasm I will try to say sim
ply what the novel is about and
as space permits let James Agee's
presentation speak for itself.
The title is exactly descriptive
of the subject. Jay Follet, the
head of a loving, close-knit fam
ily, father of two small children,
is killed iir an automobile acci
dent. He is a perfect physical
specimen and in the prime of life.
He is responsible, loved and re
spected.
Basic Meanings
The novelist probes at the basic
meanings of the accidental. Why?
Why this person at this time?
Why should the responsible, de
voted son, husband and father
die as a consequence of a tiny
cotter pin lost from the steering
mechanism of an expensive mo
tor vehicle? As with any fatal
accident or other unnatural
death, an immediate answer is
discoverable in the laws of phys
ics. But the people of this story
cannot be satisfied with an ex
planation in terms of immediate
physical causes.
Why does this man die when he
is returning from an emergency,
middle - of - the - night visit to his
own stricken father? A visit re
sulting from the drunken panic
of an irresponsible brother. The
strong and decent man is killed
by the irrational behavior of a
weak man and the highly unlike
ly failure of a steering mecha
nism.
The irony is further compound
ed by the exact nature of the
fatal blow. The point of Jay
Follet's chin strikes the hub of
the steering whel precisely and
sharply. Concussion of the brain
is immediate and fatal. The car
climbs an embankment, the driv
er is thrown clear, the car rolls
back and turns over, and lies pre
cisely beside the body which is
unmaimed and absolutely dead.

If the blow on the chin had land
ed an inch to the right or left, the
result would have been only in
jury, more or less serious.
Compounding of Ironies
That this compounding of iro
nies, by way of stressing the
senselessness of life and death,
becomes believable, gripping and
significant is the measure of
Agee's narrative art. In our own
lives and in newspaper accounts
we must accept such irony be
cause there is no denying it.
But in dramatic art we demand
probability. We must be made to
believe in what we instinctively
recoil from. Age establishes and
sustains an atmosphere and pre
sents the action so that the in
credible becomes not just credible
but almost inevitable.
The death of Jay Follet, how
ever, is merely the point of de
parture for the main interest of
the story, which is in the various
responses of the bereaved. The
question becomes, What does a
death in the family mean to those
who must go on living: wife,
children, parents, in - laws and
friends? The problem is explored
in religious and metaphysical
terms in that the members of the
family are vigorous either in
their belief or disbelief. The at
titudes range from the strongly
orthodox high Episcopalianism of
the wife and her sister to the
angry Hardy - like pessimism of
their father.
The Violent Event
As in classical tragedy the vio
lent event occurs off-stage. The
focus is on the narrator and the
members of the family who com
prise his audience. Thus, the em
phasis falls not on the event it
self but rather on its meaning
and effect. The power of this
major scene is greatly enhanced
by the presence of the nearly
deaf grandmother to whom ev
erything must be recited slowly,
clearly and emphatically. The fol
lowing passage will illustrate the
dramatic usefulness of this de

"Andrew said to his mother,
'Papa says, Do they have any

The first temptation is to call
"A Death in the Family" a most
beautiful, compelling, successful
novel, but on second thought one
realizes that such superlatives
are, paradoxically, the weakest
kind of expression, which as most
but vaguely express the review
er's state of mind.
And so with a tight hold on my
enthusiasm I will try to say sim
ply what the novel is about and
as space permits let James Agee's
presentation speak for itself.
The title is exactly descriptive
of the subject. Jay Follet, the
head of a loving, close-knit fam
ily, father of two small children,
is killed iir an automobile acci
dent. He is a perfect physical
specimen and in the prime of life.
He is responsible, loved and re
spected.
Basic Meanings
The novelist probes at the basic
meanings of the accidental. Why?
Why this person at this time?
Why should the responsible, de
voted son, husband and father
die as a consequence of a tiny
cotter pin lost from the steering
mechanism of an expensive mo
tor vehicle? As with any fatal
accident or other unnatural
death, an immediate answer is
discoverable in the laws of phys
ics. But the people of this story
cannot be satisfied with an ex
planation in terms of immediate
physical causes.
Why does this man die when he
is returning from an emergency,
middle - of - the - night visit to his
own stricken father? A visit re
sulting from the drunken panic
of an irresponsible brother. The
strong and decent man is killed
by the irrational behavior of a
weak man and the highly unlike
ly failure of a steering mecha
nism.
The irony is further compound
ed by the exact nature of the
fatal blow. The point of Jay
Follet's chin strikes the hub of
the steering whel precisely and
sharply. Concussion of the brain
is immediate and fatal. The car
climbs an embankment, the driv
er is thrown clear, the car rolls
back and turns over, and lies pre
cisely beside the body which is
unmaimed and absolutely dead.

If the blow on the chin had land
ed an inch to the right or left, the
result would have been only in
jury, more or less serious.
Compounding of Ironies
That this compounding of iro
nies, by way of stressing the
senselessness of life and death,
becomes believable, gripping and
significant is the measure of
Agee's narrative art. In our own
lives and in newspaper accounts
we must accept such irony be
cause there is no denying it.
But in dramatic art we demand
probability. We must be made to
believe in what we instinctively
recoil from. Age establishes and
sustains an atmosphere and pre
sents the action so that the in
credible becomes not just credible
but almost inevitable.
The death of Jay Follet, how
ever, is merely the point of de
parture for the main interest of
the story, which is in the various
responses of the bereaved. The
question becomes, What does a
death in the family mean to those
who must go on living: wife,
children, parents, in - laws and
friends? The problem is explored
in religious and metaphysical
terms in that the members of the
family are vigorous either in
their belief or disbelief. The at
titudes range from the strongly
orthodox high Episcopalianism of
the wife and her sister to the
angry Hardy - like pessimism of
their father.
The Violent Event
As in classical tragedy the vio
lent event occurs off-stage. The
focus is on the narrator and the
members of the family who com
prise his audience. Thus, the em
phasis falls not on the event it
self but rather on its meaning
and effect. The power of this
major scene is greatly enhanced
by the presence of the nearly
deaf grandmother to whom ev
erything must be recited slowly,
clearly and emphatically. The fol
lowing passage will illustrate the
dramatic usefulness of this de
vice:

"Andrew said to his mother,
'Papa says, Do they have any
idea how it happened?' She nod
ded and tilted her trumpet near
er his mouth. 'They showed me.
They found that a cotter pin had
worked loose —this cotter pin had
fallen out, that held the steering
mechanism together.
"'See here,' he said; he had
locked a bent knuckle between
the two bent knuckles of the oth
er hand. 'As if it were to hold
these knuckles together—see?"'
" 'Yes. "
" 'It's sort of like a very heavy
hairpin. You understand?'"
" 'No matter.'"
Setting, Period
The story is set in Knoxville,
Tennessee, in the early years of
the automobile age. But setting
and period are of no special im
portance. The book is not mainly
sociological or historical. Nor is
it Southern in the way that the
works of Faulkner and Warren
are Southern. It searches for
meaning in the irrational and in
scrutable, explores the grounds
of faith or lack of faith. It deals
with the ultimate questions of
life and death.
James Agee died at 45 in the
midst of an active and versatile
career as poet, novelist and mov
ie scenarist.
I can raise but one minor ob
jection to this nearly flawless
novel, and the editors must
shoulder the blame for this. They
have interjected between the
parts of the novel several long
passages of prose lyricism from
Agee's unpublished manuscripts.
While very impressive in them
selves, these passages are not
properly a part of this novel.
They are an intrusion and inter
ruption to the story. While we
may be glad that these fine pas
sages are published, I would sug
gest that they be read separately
before or after the story proper.
