# 65 COLORFUL YEARS
## Dippy Gets Slim As Times Change 
### Rich Brown 
With today's change from eight
to seven columns The Daily
marks another milestone in a
colorful 6Vs decades.
By this change it relinquishes
its title of "world's widest col
lege newspaper" and in so doing

is keeping up with changing con
ditions.
Many newspapers were as wide
as last quarter's Daily until
World War 11, when they nar
rowed their columns to conserve
paper. Most of them remained
that way after the war.
Mechanical limitations make it
hard to narrow columns of the
Dippy, as The Daily is also
known, so the last column has
been dropped.
It was 65 years ago last Sept.
19 that Stanford's daily was born
when The Daily Palo Alto rolled
off the press of the Redwood City
Weekly Democrat.
That was in 1892—the Univer
sity's second year — and a daily
paper so soon was a world's rec
ord. Only eight other U.S. col
leges then had dailies: Harvard,
Yale, Brown, Princeton, Cornell,
Michigan and Wisconsin.
(Our friends to the north were
still illiterate!)
"True it is that the daily will
not make a great university," the
editorial in the first Dippy said,
"but just as true is it that the
daily is one of the signs of a
great university."
The nickname "Dippy" came
from a slurring of the initials
DPA, for Daily Palo Alto, which
name had been selected in honor
of the Palo Alto redwood tree.
The nicknamc has lived on al-
though the present title, Stanford
Daily, was adopted in 1926.
During Stanford's first year,
news was disseminated by the
monthly "Palo Alto" and biweek
ly "Sequoia" as well as bulletin
boards in Eneina and Roble halls.
First issue of the Palo Alto
came out with the University's
opening. It was published pri
vately by a group of students and
never achieved official status as
a student body publication.
The Palo Alto's most famous
"recognition" came in April 1892
when, in collaboration with its
Berkeley counterpart, it produced
an intercollegiate issue contain
ing a reproduction of Simoni's
painting "Slave Merchant at the
Harem."
The San Francisco Examiner
was "shocked" at such a picture
in a college publication, where-,
upon the respective administra
tions took respective dim views
of that issue.
Sequoia, which first appeared
Dec. 9, 1891, was the official cam-,
pus paper although il tended to
be a literary magazine, which it
became exclusively when The
Daily appeared.
The Dippy's first two weeks
were harrowing. "Every edition,"
a staff member reminisced, "was
belated and Ihe few patient wait
ers would return to the dark En
cina Hall about 1 o'clock in the
morning and unload the edition
from a hired buggy."
The strain was so much on Ihe
first editor that he turned over
the reins at the end of the second
week. By I hat time a press had
been purchased and set up in the
woodshop, near where the Union
now stands.
A member of Stanford's pio
neer class, J. A. Quelle, ran the
press as a private venture and
soon became so busy that he quit
classes and never graduated.

It was Quelle's prinling plant
which began for The Daily that
evolved into the present Stanford
University Press.
Competition threatened the
Dippy when a group of students,
disliking an editorial, planned to
charter May field's Weekly Palo
Alto and run an opposition sheet.
The scheme fell through, how
ever.
The 1906 earthquake failed to
halt the Dippy. Although type
was strewn all over the room and
no electricity was available, ihe
staff ground out 500 copies b\
working a foot pedal.
Originally The Daily was four
columns and had small headlines
resembling contemporary papers
William Randolph Hearst and Jo
seph Pulitzer popularized large
headlines and gradually the Dip
py picked up the new makeup
styles.
By 1930 the Djppy was a stand
aid eight columns wide. Twice,
during World War IT and in 1948
49, it went tabloid, i.e., small
pages but many of ihom.
Until 1926 The Daily had been
an after-noon paper.
With today's change from eight
to seven columns The Daily
marks another milestone in a
colorful 6Vs decades.
By this change it relinquishes
its title of "world's widest col
lege newspaper" and in so doing

It was 65 years ago last Sept.
19 that Stanford's daily was born
when The Daily Palo Alto rolled
off the press of the Redwood City
Weekly Democrat.
That was in 1892—the Univer
sity's second year — and a daily
paper so soon was a world's rec
ord. Only eight other U.S. col
leges then had dailies: Harvard,
Yale, Brown, Princeton, Cornell,
Michigan and Wisconsin.
(Our friends to the north were
still illiterate!)
"True it is that the daily will
not make a great university," the
editorial in the first Dippy said,
"but just as true is it that the
daily is one of the signs of a
great university."
The nickname "Dippy" came
from a slurring of the initials
DPA, for Daily Palo Alto, which
name had been selected in honor
of the Palo Alto redwood tree.
The nicknamc has lived on al-
though the present title, Stanford
Daily, was adopted in 1926.
During Stanford's first year,
news was disseminated by the
monthly "Palo Alto" and biweek
ly "Sequoia" as well as bulletin
boards in Eneina and Roble halls.
First issue of the Palo Alto
came out with the University's
opening. It was published pri
vately by a group of students and
never achieved official status as
a student body publication.
The Palo Alto's most famous
"recognition" came in April 1892
when, in collaboration with its
Berkeley counterpart, it produced
an intercollegiate issue contain
ing a reproduction of Simoni's
painting "Slave Merchant at the
Harem."
The San Francisco Examiner
was "shocked" at such a picture
in a college publication, where-,
upon the respective administra
tions took respective dim views
of that issue.
Sequoia, which first appeared
Dec. 9, 1891, was the official cam-,
pus paper although il tended to
be a literary magazine, which it
became exclusively when The
Daily appeared.
The Dippy's first two weeks
were harrowing. "Every edition,"
a staff member reminisced, "was
belated and Ihe few patient wait
ers would return to the dark En
cina Hall about 1 o'clock in the
morning and unload the edition
from a hired buggy."
The strain was so much on Ihe
first editor that he turned over
the reins at the end of the second
week. By I hat time a press had
been purchased and set up in the
woodshop, near where the Union
now stands.
A member of Stanford's pio
neer class, J. A. Quelle, ran the
press as a private venture and
soon became so busy that he quit
classes and never graduated.

It was Quelle's prinling plant
which began for The Daily that
evolved into the present Stanford
University Press.
Competition threatened the
Dippy when a group of students,
disliking an editorial, planned to
charter May field's Weekly Palo
Alto and run an opposition sheet.
The scheme fell through, how
ever.
The 1906 earthquake failed to
halt the Dippy. Although type
was strewn all over the room and
no electricity was available, ihe
staff ground out 500 copies b\
working a foot pedal.
Originally The Daily was four
columns and had small headlines
resembling contemporary papers
William Randolph Hearst and Jo
seph Pulitzer popularized large
headlines and gradually the Dip
py picked up the new makeup
styles.
By 1930 the Djppy was a stand
aid eight columns wide. Twice,
during World War IT and in 1948
49, it went tabloid, i.e., small
pages but many of ihom.
Until 1926 The Daily had been
an after-noon paper.
With today's change from eight
to seven columns The Daily
marks another milestone in a
colorful 6Vs decades.
By this change it relinquishes
its title of "world's widest col
lege newspaper" and in so doing

is keeping up with changing con
ditions.
Many newspapers were as wide
as last quarter's Daily until
World War 11, when they nar
rowed their columns to conserve
paper. Most of them remained
that way after the war.
Mechanical limitations make it
hard to narrow columns of the
Dippy, as The Daily is also
known, so the last column has

daily is one of the signs of a
great university."
The nickname "Dippy" came
from a slurring of the initials
DPA, for Daily Palo Alto, which
name had been selected in honor
of the Palo Alto redwood tree.
The nicknamc has lived on al-
though the present title, Stanford
Daily, was adopted in 1926.
During Stanford's first year,
news was disseminated by the
monthly "Palo Alto" and biweek
ly "Sequoia" as well as bulletin
boards in Eneina and Roble halls.
First issue of the Palo Alto
came out with the University's
opening. It was published pri
vately by a group of students and
never achieved official status as
a student body publication.
The Palo Alto's most famous
"recognition" came in April 1892
when, in collaboration with its
Berkeley counterpart, it produced
an intercollegiate issue contain
ing a reproduction of Simoni's
painting "Slave Merchant at the
Harem."
The San Francisco Examiner
was "shocked" at such a picture
in a college publication, where-,
upon the respective administra
tions took respective dim views
of that issue.
Sequoia, which first appeared
Dec. 9, 1891, was the official cam-,
pus paper although il tended to
be a literary magazine, which it
became exclusively when The
Daily appeared.
The Dippy's first two weeks
were harrowing. "Every edition,"
a staff member reminisced, "was
belated and Ihe few patient wait
ers would return to the dark En
cina Hall about 1 o'clock in the
morning and unload the edition
from a hired buggy."
The strain was so much on Ihe
first editor that he turned over
the reins at the end of the second
week. By I hat time a press had
been purchased and set up in the
woodshop, near where the Union
now stands.
A member of Stanford's pio
neer class, J. A. Quelle, ran the
press as a private venture and
soon became so busy that he quit
classes and never graduated.

It was Quelle's prinling plant
which began for The Daily that
evolved into the present Stanford
University Press.
Competition threatened the
Dippy when a group of students,
disliking an editorial, planned to
charter May field's Weekly Palo
Alto and run an opposition sheet.
The scheme fell through, how
ever.
The 1906 earthquake failed to
halt the Dippy. Although type
was strewn all over the room and
no electricity was available, ihe
staff ground out 500 copies b\
working a foot pedal.
Originally The Daily was four
columns and had small headlines
resembling contemporary papers
William Randolph Hearst and Jo
seph Pulitzer popularized large
headlines and gradually the Dip
py picked up the new makeup
styles.
By 1930 the Djppy was a stand
aid eight columns wide. Twice,
during World War IT and in 1948
49, it went tabloid, i.e., small
pages but many of ihom.
Until 1926 The Daily had been
an after-noon paper.
With today's change from eight
to seven columns The Daily
marks another milestone in a
colorful 6Vs decades.
By this change it relinquishes
its title of "world's widest col
lege newspaper" and in so doing

is keeping up with changing con
ditions.
Many newspapers were as wide
as last quarter's Daily until
World War 11, when they nar
rowed their columns to conserve
paper. Most of them remained
that way after the war.
Mechanical limitations make it
hard to narrow columns of the
Dippy, as The Daily is also
known, so the last column has
been dropped.
It was 65 years ago last Sept.
19 that Stanford's daily was born
when The Daily Palo Alto rolled
off the press of the Redwood City
Weekly Democrat.
That was in 1892—the Univer
sity's second year — and a daily
paper so soon was a world's rec
ord. Only eight other U.S. col
leges then had dailies: Harvard,
Yale, Brown, Princeton, Cornell,
Michigan and Wisconsin.
(Our friends to the north were
still illiterate!)
