# Daily Bulginess Gone Forever
## 
### 
Keeping in step with the cur
rent bulk-reduction craze, "The
Peninsula's Only Morning
Newspaper" has slimmed down
to seven columns starting to
day.
No longer will the former
"world's widest and bulgiest
page" inconvenience students
who read The Daily in class.
Although the new page will
aid row dwellers to wrap their
garbage without undue strug
gle, it will also make it neces
sary to devise a new folding
technique for lining garbage
cans.
To herald this progressive
step in the annals of publish
ing, The Daily proudly features
a story today on the 66 - year
history of "The Peninsula's
Only Morning Newspaper."
