STUDENTS:
BE LULLED by soft music, smiling faccs and the lurid covers of our
paperbound books. Help end the recession by spending all your money at
KEPLER'S, the store that pockets the profits. Let our hidden persuaders
and subliminal messages help you achieve the trance-like state necessary
for the proper enjoyment of booking up for Spring Quarter.
AVOID long hours in line and the shortening of your temper. Ask for
a tranquilizer at the door.
What has KEPLER'S got that television doesn't have??? Books, paper
bound ones. Just the ones you need for Spring Quarter . . . and Playboy
besides.
