# 'HOT AIR' PROPAGANDA
## Russ Stop Atom Tests; Length of Ban Hinges Upon Action of West 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) — Soviet Russia
told the world yesterday it is
stopping all nuclear weapons
tests—but left the door open to
resume them unless other powers
take the same step.
The Soviet Union set no date
for its go-it-alone ban and it may
endure no longer than the first
blast in a new series the United
States will start in the Pacific,
possibly within a few weeks.
A resolution submitted to (he
Supreme Soviet parliament from
the Council of Ministers by For
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko
was adopted unanimously. It
asked that the government "uni
laterally cease making tests of
all forms of atomic and hydrogen
weapons."
"If other countries possessing
hydrogen and atomic weapons
continue their tests," the resolu
tion added, "the Soviet govern
ment will be free to act in the
same manner in the interests of
the security of the Soviet Union."
The United States rejected Rus
sia's invitation to join in halting
nuclear tests without bothering
to check up on each other.
In diplomatic tones, the State
Department called the Kremlin
move so much propaganda hot
air, whose only aim was to wilt
Western defense.
The uncompromising rejection
of this bid was balanced some
what by an olive branch approach
to a summit conference. The De
partment made public a Western
Big Three note to the Kremlin
which, for the first time, leaned
toward the Russian formula for
pre-summit talks.
Nikolai Bulganin's last note as
Soviet premier to President Ei
senhower on Feb. 28 emphasized
that any pre-summit foreign min
isters' meeting must be "strictly
limited" to fixing an agenda,
time, place and roster of partici
pants at the summit.
