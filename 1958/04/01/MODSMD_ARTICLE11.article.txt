# NO FACILITIES
## Stanford Bookstore Loses Text Orders to Kepler's 
### Dave Quarles 
In a general atmosphere of quandary the Modern European Lan
guage Department shifted its book orders this week from Stanford
Bookstore to Kepler's.
Asked the reason for the change, M.E.L. head Friedrich Stroth
mann said, "The Stanford Bookstore hasn't the facilities for the

books we want. It is technically
complicated to order these books
through the Bookstore."
Strothmann emphasized that
the shift applies only to foreign
language books printed in foreign
countries and not stored in the
United States.
"Kepler's is smaller and can
devote more lime to obtaining
these books," Strothmann added.
The Bookstore, however, re
mained in the dark over the
change. Mrs. H. T. Bauchou, Stan
ford Bookstore official, said, "I
don't know any real reason why
the change was made."
When it. was suggested that per
haps the Bookstore is slower in
filling its orders than Kepler's,
Mrs. Bauchou said she knew no
reason why this should be the
case.
"As soon as we gel an order, it
is sent out. I would be hesitant
to say that Kepler's service is any
better than ours. As bookstores,
we both have the same sources,"
Mrs. Bauchou said.
"The Bookslore has broad re
sources. We will just have to wait
and see what the trouble is," she
added.
Mrs. Bauchou emphasized that
there is no hard feeling on the
part of Ihe Bookstore. "Kepler's
is entitled to a share of the busi
ness. We are very crowded at the
beginning of each quarter, and it
will be a help to have some of the
load removed," she said.
Roy Kepler said he also was
given no reason for the change
by the M.E.L. Department. "How
ever, we do appreciate the busi
ness," he added.
Kepler said he was asked and
has obtained some three or four
hundred foreign-printed books for
the department. He also said that
Kepler's has no special "in" for
obtaining these books.
However, Kepler did express his
approval of the "broadening of
the book community." He said:
"We hope (he Stanford Bookstore
will find help in being backed up
by other stores.
"A cooperating book community
is mutually beneficial to all con
cerned. Especially important is
the fact that more books are avail
able for students and residents of
the Stanford and Palo Alto com
munities.
"We hope to see the growth of
this kind of cooperation."

ford Bookstore official, said, "I
don't know any real reason why
the change was made."
When it. was suggested that per
haps the Bookstore is slower in
filling its orders than Kepler's,
Mrs. Bauchou said she knew no
reason why this should be the
case.
"As soon as we gel an order, it
is sent out. I would be hesitant
to say that Kepler's service is any
better than ours. As bookstores,
we both have the same sources,"
Mrs. Bauchou said.
"The Bookslore has broad re
sources. We will just have to wait
and see what the trouble is," she
added.
Mrs. Bauchou emphasized that
there is no hard feeling on the
part of Ihe Bookstore. "Kepler's
is entitled to a share of the busi
ness. We are very crowded at the
beginning of each quarter, and it
will be a help to have some of the
load removed," she said.
Roy Kepler said he also was
given no reason for the change
by the M.E.L. Department. "How
ever, we do appreciate the busi
ness," he added.
Kepler said he was asked and
has obtained some three or four
hundred foreign-printed books for
the department. He also said that
Kepler's has no special "in" for
obtaining these books.
However, Kepler did express his
approval of the "broadening of
the book community." He said:
"We hope (he Stanford Bookstore
will find help in being backed up
by other stores.
"A cooperating book community
is mutually beneficial to all con
cerned. Especially important is
the fact that more books are avail
able for students and residents of
the Stanford and Palo Alto com
munities.
"We hope to see the growth of
this kind of cooperation."

In a general atmosphere of quandary the Modern European Lan
guage Department shifted its book orders this week from Stanford
Bookstore to Kepler's.
Asked the reason for the change, M.E.L. head Friedrich Stroth
mann said, "The Stanford Bookstore hasn't the facilities for the

books we want. It is technically
complicated to order these books
through the Bookstore."
Strothmann emphasized that
the shift applies only to foreign
language books printed in foreign
countries and not stored in the
United States.
"Kepler's is smaller and can
devote more lime to obtaining
these books," Strothmann added.
The Bookstore, however, re
mained in the dark over the
change. Mrs. H. T. Bauchou, Stan
ford Bookstore official, said, "I
