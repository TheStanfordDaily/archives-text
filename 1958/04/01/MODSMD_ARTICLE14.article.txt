# The 						Bookstore Loses a Customer
## 
### 
The Germanic and Homanie Languages De
partment recently look what one professor
called the "heroic decision" of partially '"break
illur relalions"' with the Bookstore. Most foreign
prinled hooks used iu language courses are now
being ordered through Kepler's Books & Maga
zines store.
The reason given for the change is thai I lie
Stanford Bookstore's orders from foreign coun
tries often lake several months lo arrive, while
Kepler's and other bookstores can deliver such
books in a few weeks.
The language department decision was cer
tainly a heroic one, but it was also a sad one.
It points up yet another of the many ineffi
ciencies in a university bookstore which refuses
10 ad like a bookstore but insists rather on
being a gift shop with a book concession.
Some of the common complaints against the
Bookstore may not he justifiable. The fact that
11 refuses lo order more than a definite number
of textbooks for a course, since constant text
book revisions could cause a financial loss, is
understandable. But w h\ the Bookstore acts
with the caution of a profit-making organiza

lion in tliis ease, hut will not adopt the afires
si merchandising techniques connected willi
the profit motive, is no! understandable.
I.aek of space is an ill which could be en red
bv money. But il would be a slarl if I lie Book
store eliminated some of its stufTed animals,
potted plants and oilier useless bric-a-brac.
Hul, while these complaints may not he
whollv justified, whv the Bookstore cannot
order hooks as quicklv as its outside competi
tors remains a imstery to us.
I he advantages of the Bookstore rebate sys
tem are obvious. But the even greater advan
tages of having a genuine bookstore on campus,
where university students can find the books
lhe\ want and need, without waiting several
months for an order lo come through, are also
obvious.
Boycotting the Bookstore may be one answer,
but it hardk solves the basic problem. Its bard
lo suggest a solution, when no one seems lo
know just why the Bookstore is the way it is.
I'erhaps lite Bookstore should end rebates and
become a profit - making organization. Or
mavhc il should just quit and make room for
Kepler's to move on campus.
