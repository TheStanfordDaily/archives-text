# Dealing With the Recession
## 
### Roscoe Drummond 
There are four favorable developments bearing
on the recession.
They are encouraging developments, not be
eanse they surest a speedy upturn —which is
certainly not visible —but because they show that
the federal government is acting alertly and re
sponsibly to shorten and cushion the slump:
1. The cushioning stabilizers, which have been
built into the economy since the harrowing ex
perience of the long-drawn-out depression of 1929,
are proving their value as never before. These
stabilizers include old-age pensions and, prima
rily, unemployment insurance payments, which
vary in amount and length by states and which
President Eisenhower is asking Congress l<>
extend for an additional 13 weeks through federal
financing. In consequence, personal income is
holding up heller today than in any of the post
war dips in the economy, and this itself is a brake
on t he downward spiral. Personal income declined
8 per cent in the 1929 depression, only 3.1 per cent
in 1948-49, 1.9 in 1952-54 and 1.3 per cent in 1957-58.
2. Another favorable development is the cer
tainty that the federal government—the Presi
dent and Congress alike —will exercise the lullest
range of its resources, from monetary policy to a
tax cut if necessary, to preclude mass unemploy
ment and to build recovery. The Eisenhower
administration does not believe that government
action can end the recession by itselt or even
provide the main stimulus. Kut it certainly does
not look on the recession as an act of angry
providence, out of everybody's control, and it does
believe that federal action can hold the recession
in bounds and shorten its duration.
* #
3. The next encouraging development is the
extent to which the leaders of both parties are
now stepping back from playing partisan politics
with taxes.
Nothing could be more helpful than the agree
ment reached between Secretary of the Treasury
Robert Anderson and Speaker Sam Kayhurn of
the House, where tax bills must originate, that
neither the Administration nor the Democratic
leadership will try to pull off a political coup by
rushing forward with a tax-cut bill while the
other's head is turned. The agreement is that

neither side will act without prior consultation
with the other. That's good.
This is responsible politics at its best. It is not
surprising that two men of such stature and wis
dom as Speaker Rayburn and Secretary Anderson
should be the ones to have brought about this
understanding.
There are solid reasons why Mr. Anderson and
Mr. Rayburn are trying to keep politics out of
the tax equation. If is economically dangerous
to rush into a tax cut for wrong reasons because,
by acting too soon and before the facts are clear
enough, a tax cut might prove to be the wrong
thing. It is politically dangerous because it is by
no means self-evident that the political rewards
will go with the tax-cutters, particularly if a tax
cut abets inflation and keeps the cost of living
going up.
But the temptation to try to play politics with
a tax cut is very great, and it is reassuring to see
Mr. Anderson and Mr. Rayburn standing firm
against it.

4. This leads to the fourth favorable develop
ment. Taking much of the political heat off pre
cipitate tax cutting means that the Administra
tion will lie in a better position to resist a pre
mature tax decision. It can better do what it
believes wise, namely, wait until the recession
indicators are clearer and thereby act more pru
dently.
The oullook now is that the end of the down
turn is not yet at hand, but there is a possibility
that there will soon be favorable factors in some
segments of the economy, like home building
(which the bleak winter has been hurting) and
department store sales. This means that the need
for tax reduction may not be promptly evident
and that it will be prudent not to rush into a tax
cut. The climate for prudence is better than ii
was a monlh ago.
Prudence does not mean inaction on anti-reces
sion measures. There are no political incentives
for inaction particularly since the Gallup Poll
now shows that for the first time since M)l'7 a
majority of the voters cite unemployment as the
nation's No. I problem.

There are four favorable developments bearing
on the recession.
They are encouraging developments, not be
eanse they surest a speedy upturn —which is
certainly not visible —but because they show that
the federal government is acting alertly and re
sponsibly to shorten and cushion the slump:
1. The cushioning stabilizers, which have been
built into the economy since the harrowing ex
perience of the long-drawn-out depression of 1929,
are proving their value as never before. These
stabilizers include old-age pensions and, prima
rily, unemployment insurance payments, which
vary in amount and length by states and which
President Eisenhower is asking Congress l<>
extend for an additional 13 weeks through federal
financing. In consequence, personal income is
holding up heller today than in any of the post
war dips in the economy, and this itself is a brake
on t he downward spiral. Personal income declined
8 per cent in the 1929 depression, only 3.1 per cent
in 1948-49, 1.9 in 1952-54 and 1.3 per cent in 1957-58.
2. Another favorable development is the cer
tainty that the federal government—the Presi
dent and Congress alike —will exercise the lullest
range of its resources, from monetary policy to a
tax cut if necessary, to preclude mass unemploy
ment and to build recovery. The Eisenhower
administration does not believe that government
action can end the recession by itselt or even
provide the main stimulus. Kut it certainly does
not look on the recession as an act of angry
providence, out of everybody's control, and it does
believe that federal action can hold the recession
in bounds and shorten its duration.

extent to which the leaders of both parties are

There are four favorable developments bearing
on the recession.
They are encouraging developments, not be
eanse they surest a speedy upturn —which is
certainly not visible —but because they show that
the federal government is acting alertly and re
sponsibly to shorten and cushion the slump:
1. The cushioning stabilizers, which have been
built into the economy since the harrowing ex
perience of the long-drawn-out depression of 1929,
are proving their value as never before. These
stabilizers include old-age pensions and, prima
rily, unemployment insurance payments, which
vary in amount and length by states and which
President Eisenhower is asking Congress l<>
extend for an additional 13 weeks through federal
financing. In consequence, personal income is
holding up heller today than in any of the post
war dips in the economy, and this itself is a brake
on t he downward spiral. Personal income declined
8 per cent in the 1929 depression, only 3.1 per cent
in 1948-49, 1.9 in 1952-54 and 1.3 per cent in 1957-58.
2. Another favorable development is the cer
tainty that the federal government—the Presi
dent and Congress alike —will exercise the lullest
range of its resources, from monetary policy to a
tax cut if necessary, to preclude mass unemploy
ment and to build recovery. The Eisenhower
administration does not believe that government
action can end the recession by itselt or even
provide the main stimulus. Kut it certainly does
not look on the recession as an act of angry
providence, out of everybody's control, and it does
believe that federal action can hold the recession
in bounds and shorten its duration.

3. The next encouraging development is the
extent to which the leaders of both parties are
now stepping back from playing partisan politics
with taxes.
Nothing could be more helpful than the agree
ment reached between Secretary of the Treasury
Robert Anderson and Speaker Sam Kayhurn of
the House, where tax bills must originate, that
neither the Administration nor the Democratic
leadership will try to pull off a political coup by
rushing forward with a tax-cut bill while the
other's head is turned. The agreement is that

neither side will act without prior consultation
with the other. That's good.
This is responsible politics at its best. It is not
surprising that two men of such stature and wis
dom as Speaker Rayburn and Secretary Anderson
should be the ones to have brought about this
understanding.
There are solid reasons why Mr. Anderson and
Mr. Rayburn are trying to keep politics out of
the tax equation. If is economically dangerous
to rush into a tax cut for wrong reasons because,
by acting too soon and before the facts are clear
enough, a tax cut might prove to be the wrong
thing. It is politically dangerous because it is by
no means self-evident that the political rewards
will go with the tax-cutters, particularly if a tax
cut abets inflation and keeps the cost of living
going up.
But the temptation to try to play politics with
a tax cut is very great, and it is reassuring to see
Mr. Anderson and Mr. Rayburn standing firm
against it.

4. This leads to the fourth favorable develop
ment. Taking much of the political heat off pre
cipitate tax cutting means that the Administra
tion will lie in a better position to resist a pre
mature tax decision. It can better do what it
believes wise, namely, wait until the recession
indicators are clearer and thereby act more pru
dently.
The oullook now is that the end of the down
turn is not yet at hand, but there is a possibility
that there will soon be favorable factors in some
segments of the economy, like home building
(which the bleak winter has been hurting) and
department store sales. This means that the need
for tax reduction may not be promptly evident
and that it will be prudent not to rush into a tax
cut. The climate for prudence is better than ii
was a monlh ago.
Prudence does not mean inaction on anti-reces
sion measures. There are no political incentives
for inaction particularly since the Gallup Poll
now shows that for the first time since M)l'7 a
majority of the voters cite unemployment as the
nation's No. I problem.
