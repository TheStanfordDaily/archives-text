# CIRCULATE PRINCETON STATEMENT
## Profs Want Pay, Tuition Raises 
### 
In response to a nation-wide
plea by a group of Princeton pro
fessors, 138 members of the Stan
ford faculty have signed a state
ment advocating higher pay for
university professors and higher
college tuitions.
A self • constituted committee,
headed by professors Bernard F.
Haley, Robert Hofstadter, John
Loftis, Hubert Marshall, George
F. Sensabaugh, Yvor Winters and
Arthur F. Wright, circulated the
Princeton statement to members
of the Stanford Academic Council,
to which all full-time faculty
members of the rank of assistant
professor or higher belong.
The authors of the statement
agree with President Goheen of
Princeton that there should be "an
average increase in salaries of fac
ulty members of 8 per cent a year
for the next five years"—or 47
per cent by the end of the five
year period.
Goheen said that "in carrying
this through five years we're fig
uring on coming through with the
tuition raises and I hope they'll
be substantial ones."
Scholarship Aid
He said that the "very rich can
pay whatever we charge," and
that the poor will receive scholar
ship aid.
"But to handle the middle-in
come parents with perhaps one or
two other children in college . . .
schools will have to develop a loan
plan . . . | which | would permit a
parent or student to finance the
costs of an education through an |

installment system. . . ."
Goheen emphasized that for ob
vious reasons this proposal re
quires "cooj>ei - alive action by a
significant number of private in
stil ut ions."
The Princeton statement points
to the decline in the average pro
fessor's standard of living. The
average pay for a full professor,
it says, is $7100 a year "hardly
two-thirds of the real purchasing
power he had in 1940."
The statement says "this nation
wide condition is due largely to
the failure of tuition in private
colleges and universities to cover
the cost of a college education.
"A college education is estimat
ed as having a lifetime financial
worth of $100,000 or more. Yet
four years of college tuition is
roughly equal to the cost of a
medium-priced automobile."
The statement says that profes
sors often "subsidize" education
themselves by doing outside work
to ."help close the gap between
salary and higher living costs."
It says the "economic position"
of the professor must be restored
to the 1940 level, which, according
to Princeton findings, would re
quire a salary increase of 100 to
125 per cent by 1970. This in

crease is necessary, the statement
says, to advance education, to in
crease the prestige of utiive, >it\
professors and thus attract youn;
people to the profession.
Tuition Doubled
The Princeton group favors tui
tion increases so that the "income
therefrom approaches the cost of
services rendered. This may call
for the doubling of tuition fees."
The group sees several possi
bilities for student assistance to
lessen the burden of the increased
tuitions: "the setting up of schol
arships or tuition loan funds, ex
emption of tuition from taxation
or perhaps double exemption from
federal income tax for parents of
students in college or graduate
school."
A paragraph inserted by the
Stanford committee states:
"The need for reconsideration of
faculty salaries is national rather
than merely local. In urging sub
stantial salary increases at Stan

ford, wo acknowledge with graft
tiide gains already made.
' Wo acknowledge also that bo
n. ■(' of the proximity of a strong
supported university which
i viriiaily tuition-free, Stanford
lavs potential dangers in radi
cally raising tuition which the
major eastern universities do not
face.
• "However, we believe that the
1 am: !- to Stanford of not raising
tuiiion and salaries are greater
t '1.11 tin -i> which the raises would
bring. This is a problem goner
a 11% faced by private institutions,
!> i it i: one which has to be solved
if the private institutions are to
!'untinu<> to attract and retain fac
ulties of high distinction."
