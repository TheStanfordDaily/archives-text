# Retiring Prof Pioneered In Research on Tobacco
## 
### Terry Rentz 
As early as 1923, Dr. J. Percy
Baumberger, professor of physiol
ogy here, was leading the re
search into the harmful effects of
cigarette smoking. This was only
one facet of the distinguished ca
reer of Dr. Baumberger, who will
retire this August after 39 years
of teaching and research here.
The story of his life is a fasci
nating one. He was born in San
Leandro in 1892, the year after
Stanford opened. As a child he
started an extensive insect collec
tion which is now at Cornell Uni
versity.
Until he received the Doctor of
Science degree at Harvard in 1918.
Baumberger specialized in the
physiology of insects.
However, during World War I
he was assigned to the traumatic
shock laboratory in France, where
—under the direction of Col. W. B.
Cannon of Harvard—he had his
introduction to human physiolo
gy. The nature of wound shock
and the use of blood transfusion
were little known, and the labora
tory contributed important infor
mation on these subjects.
After the armistice was signed,
Cannon offered Baumberger a po
sition at Harvard, but, Dr. Baum
berger explained, "I preferred to
go back to California. Dr. Cannon
wrote to Stanford, and in 1919
I joined the staff as an instructor
of physiology."
He continued: "Since I had re
ceived the B.S. from Cal, I knew
Stanford well and I had seen it
both before and after the earth
quake."
For many summers Baumber
ger worked at the Hopkins Marine
Station, on Monterey Bay. One of
his early problems was the in
crease of size in crabs at the time
they shed their exoskeleton. "Aft
er shedding," he said, "a crab may
increase as much as 42 per cent in
volume by taking up water very
suddenly."
Tobacco Research
He also did research on tobacco
smoke, using the method of elec
trical precipitation. He determin
ed the amount of smoke left in
the lungs on inhalation as well a-s
the carbon monoxide and nicotine
content of the smoke.
"I was one of the first to show
the amount of smoke, tarry mat
ter, etc., that is deposited in the
lungs." he said. "As early as 1923,
scientists were working on this
modern-day problem."
In 1925 Baumberger went to Eu
rope on a commission for relief in
Belgium and an American-Scandi
navian fellowship. At the Univer
sity of Brussels, in Belgium, and
and the University of Lund, in
Sweden, he did research on blood
clotting and made studies of oxi
dation - reduction potential. The
latter en!ailed the measurement
of the intensity of the metabolic
processes going on in the tissues.
In 1932 he returned to Harvard,
where he spent a year at the can
cer hospital examining the cell
physiology of malignant tissue.
Aviation Problems
During World War II he
worked at Wright Field on prob
lems of aviation medicine. His
two main projects were methods
of attaining greater altitude by
pressure breathing and the ef
fects of explosive decompression,
which ocurs when a pressurized
cabin is struck by a shell and the
pressure suddenly drops.
When the Korean War began,
he contributed to a Navy manual
on methods of field physiology,
which dealt with the study of the
wounded at the front or in places

where there were inadequate
medical facilities.
Over a period of years he
worked on polarographic meth
ods applied to physiology. This
concerns the use of the dropping
mercury electrode as an analyti
cal tool.
He married Alberta Jackson in
1914. She is a graduate of Miss
Hamlin's School and later studied
social work at Simmons'. Mrs.
Baumberger has been active in
professional social work ever
since, but she has also devoted
time to Stanford as a senior spon
sor of the Stanford Dames, a
YWCA board member and presi
dent of the Faculty Wives.
He and his wife have attended
international physiology con
gresses quite regularly since
1926. The most recent congress
was held in Brussels two years
ago.
Baumberger will retire at the
end of summer, completing 39

years of teaching at Stanford. "I
plan to continue research proj
ects, especially studying the
physiology of the blood, a subject
in which I have worked quite a
bit," he stated. "I hope to stay
here in my own office and labora
tory and obtain support for my
research."
"I have enjoyed working with
the faculty and students at Stan
ford," he continued. "I want to
give special acknowledgment to
Mrs. Kathleen Bardwell, who has
been my assistant since 1927.
"Probably my greatest source
of satisfaction has come from fol
lowing the careers of the stu
dents who did research with me.
The subjects of their present re
search activities are most varied,
for example: adaptation to cold
in Alaska, cancer cell metabolism,
liver function and medical prac
tice. One developed the radiation
protection in the atomic-powered
Nautilus, and another was in
volved in the recent "man in
space" experiments at Randolph
Field."

dents who did research with me.
The subjects of their present re
search activities are most varied,
for example: adaptation to cold
in Alaska, cancer cell metabolism,
liver function and medical prac
tice. One developed the radiation
protection in the atomic-powered
Nautilus, and another was in
volved in the recent "man in
space" experiments at Randolph
Field."


DR. J. PERCY BAUMBERGER
Distinguished Career
As early as 1923, Dr. J. Percy
Baumberger, professor of physiol
ogy here, was leading the re
search into the harmful effects of
cigarette smoking. This was only
one facet of the distinguished ca
reer of Dr. Baumberger, who will
retire this August after 39 years
of teaching and research here.
The story of his life is a fasci
nating one. He was born in San
Leandro in 1892, the year after
Stanford opened. As a child he
started an extensive insect collec
tion which is now at Cornell Uni
versity.
Until he received the Doctor of
Science degree at Harvard in 1918.
Baumberger specialized in the
physiology of insects.
However, during World War I
he was assigned to the traumatic
shock laboratory in France, where
—under the direction of Col. W. B.
Cannon of Harvard—he had his
introduction to human physiolo
gy. The nature of wound shock
and the use of blood transfusion
were little known, and the labora
tory contributed important infor
mation on these subjects.
After the armistice was signed,
Cannon offered Baumberger a po
sition at Harvard, but, Dr. Baum
berger explained, "I preferred to
go back to California. Dr. Cannon
wrote to Stanford, and in 1919
I joined the staff as an instructor
of physiology."
He continued: "Since I had re
ceived the B.S. from Cal, I knew
Stanford well and I had seen it
both before and after the earth
quake."
For many summers Baumber
ger worked at the Hopkins Marine
Station, on Monterey Bay. One of
his early problems was the in
crease of size in crabs at the time
they shed their exoskeleton. "Aft
er shedding," he said, "a crab may
increase as much as 42 per cent in
volume by taking up water very
suddenly."
Tobacco Research
He also did research on tobacco
smoke, using the method of elec
trical precipitation. He determin
ed the amount of smoke left in
the lungs on inhalation as well a-s
the carbon monoxide and nicotine
content of the smoke.
"I was one of the first to show
the amount of smoke, tarry mat
ter, etc., that is deposited in the
lungs." he said. "As early as 1923,
scientists were working on this
modern-day problem."
In 1925 Baumberger went to Eu
rope on a commission for relief in
Belgium and an American-Scandi
navian fellowship. At the Univer
sity of Brussels, in Belgium, and
and the University of Lund, in
Sweden, he did research on blood
clotting and made studies of oxi
dation - reduction potential. The
latter en!ailed the measurement
of the intensity of the metabolic
processes going on in the tissues.
In 1932 he returned to Harvard,
where he spent a year at the can
cer hospital examining the cell
physiology of malignant tissue.
Aviation Problems
During World War II he
worked at Wright Field on prob
lems of aviation medicine. His
two main projects were methods
of attaining greater altitude by
pressure breathing and the ef
fects of explosive decompression,
which ocurs when a pressurized
cabin is struck by a shell and the
pressure suddenly drops.
When the Korean War began,
he contributed to a Navy manual
on methods of field physiology,
which dealt with the study of the
wounded at the front or in places

where there were inadequate
medical facilities.
Over a period of years he
worked on polarographic meth
ods applied to physiology. This
concerns the use of the dropping
mercury electrode as an analyti
cal tool.
He married Alberta Jackson in
1914. She is a graduate of Miss
Hamlin's School and later studied
social work at Simmons'. Mrs.
Baumberger has been active in
professional social work ever
since, but she has also devoted
time to Stanford as a senior spon
sor of the Stanford Dames, a
YWCA board member and presi
dent of the Faculty Wives.
He and his wife have attended
international physiology con
gresses quite regularly since
1926. The most recent congress
was held in Brussels two years
ago.
Baumberger will retire at the
end of summer, completing 39

years of teaching at Stanford. "I
plan to continue research proj
ects, especially studying the
physiology of the blood, a subject
in which I have worked quite a
bit," he stated. "I hope to stay
here in my own office and labora
tory and obtain support for my
research."
"I have enjoyed working with
the faculty and students at Stan
ford," he continued. "I want to
give special acknowledgment to
Mrs. Kathleen Bardwell, who has
been my assistant since 1927.
"Probably my greatest source
of satisfaction has come from fol

dents who did research with me.

here in my own office and labora
tory and obtain support for my
research."
"I have enjoyed working with
the faculty and students at Stan
ford," he continued. "I want to
give special acknowledgment to
Mrs. Kathleen Bardwell, who has
been my assistant since 1927.
"Probably my greatest source
of satisfaction has come from fol
lowing the careers of the stu
dents who did research with me.
The subjects of their present re

for example: adaptation to cold

liver function and medical prac

DR. J. PERCY BAUMBERGER
Distinguished Career
As early as 1923, Dr. J. Percy
Baumberger, professor of physiol
ogy here, was leading the re
search into the harmful effects of
cigarette smoking. This was only
one facet of the distinguished ca
reer of Dr. Baumberger, who will
retire this August after 39 years
of teaching and research here.
The story of his life is a fasci
nating one. He was born in San
Leandro in 1892, the year after
Stanford opened. As a child he
started an extensive insect collec
tion which is now at Cornell Uni
versity.
Until he received the Doctor of
Science degree at Harvard in 1918.
Baumberger specialized in the
physiology of insects.
However, during World War I
he was assigned to the traumatic
shock laboratory in France, where
—under the direction of Col. W. B.
Cannon of Harvard—he had his
introduction to human physiolo
gy. The nature of wound shock
and the use of blood transfusion
were little known, and the labora
tory contributed important infor
mation on these subjects.
After the armistice was signed,
Cannon offered Baumberger a po
sition at Harvard, but, Dr. Baum
berger explained, "I preferred to
go back to California. Dr. Cannon
wrote to Stanford, and in 1919
I joined the staff as an instructor
of physiology."
He continued: "Since I had re
ceived the B.S. from Cal, I knew
Stanford well and I had seen it
both before and after the earth
quake."
For many summers Baumber
ger worked at the Hopkins Marine
Station, on Monterey Bay. One of
his early problems was the in
crease of size in crabs at the time
they shed their exoskeleton. "Aft
er shedding," he said, "a crab may
increase as much as 42 per cent in
volume by taking up water very
suddenly."
Tobacco Research
He also did research on tobacco
smoke, using the method of elec
trical precipitation. He determin
ed the amount of smoke left in
the lungs on inhalation as well a-s
the carbon monoxide and nicotine
content of the smoke.
"I was one of the first to show
the amount of smoke, tarry mat
ter, etc., that is deposited in the
lungs." he said. "As early as 1923,
scientists were working on this
modern-day problem."
In 1925 Baumberger went to Eu
rope on a commission for relief in
Belgium and an American-Scandi
navian fellowship. At the Univer
sity of Brussels, in Belgium, and
and the University of Lund, in
Sweden, he did research on blood
clotting and made studies of oxi
dation - reduction potential. The
latter en!ailed the measurement
of the intensity of the metabolic
processes going on in the tissues.
In 1932 he returned to Harvard,
where he spent a year at the can
cer hospital examining the cell
physiology of malignant tissue.
Aviation Problems
During World War II he
worked at Wright Field on prob
lems of aviation medicine. His
two main projects were methods
of attaining greater altitude by
pressure breathing and the ef
fects of explosive decompression,
which ocurs when a pressurized
cabin is struck by a shell and the
pressure suddenly drops.
When the Korean War began,
he contributed to a Navy manual
on methods of field physiology,
which dealt with the study of the
wounded at the front or in places

where there were inadequate
medical facilities.
Over a period of years he
worked on polarographic meth
ods applied to physiology. This
concerns the use of the dropping
mercury electrode as an analyti
cal tool.
He married Alberta Jackson in
1914. She is a graduate of Miss
Hamlin's School and later studied
social work at Simmons'. Mrs.
Baumberger has been active in
professional social work ever
since, but she has also devoted
time to Stanford as a senior spon
sor of the Stanford Dames, a
YWCA board member and presi
dent of the Faculty Wives.
He and his wife have attended
international physiology con
gresses quite regularly since
1926. The most recent congress
was held in Brussels two years
ago.
Baumberger will retire at the
end of summer, completing 39

years of teaching at Stanford. "I
plan to continue research proj
ects, especially studying the
physiology of the blood, a subject
in which I have worked quite a
bit," he stated. "I hope to stay
here in my own office and labora
tory and obtain support for my
research."
