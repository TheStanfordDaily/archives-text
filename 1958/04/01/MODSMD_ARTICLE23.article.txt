(Editor's note: The follow*
inn is the second and final in
stallment describing the 66-year
history of The Stanford Daily,
"The Peninsula's Only Morning 1
Newspaper." It was written to
commemorate The Daily's
memorable switch to seven col
umns to provide a handier
reading format.)
The year 1912 brimmed with ex
citement.
The world's largest ship, the
"unsinkable" Titanic, went down
with 1500 lives.
Teddy Roosevelt lined up the
Bull Moose party to put William
Howard Taft out of the White
Houseâ€”only to have both of them
defeated by Woodrow Wilson.
At Stanford the big issue was

getting the school name into the
campus paper's title. Although
The Daily Palo Alto had been
named after the famed redwood
"tall tree." some people were be
ginning to relate the paper to the
nearby community.
Accordingly, the "Dippy" offer
ed a $10 prize to the one suggest
ing the best new name. Many
titles were submitted, but 14 years
were to pass before the student
body voted in "Stanford Daily" in
1926.
In 1912 the name "Stanford Sun
down" was favored, with "Stan
ford Daily" running second.
"Sundown" was popular, accord
ing to the October 1912 alumni
magazine, "because the daily is an
evening paper, because Sundown

signifies daily and evening and
far western, because while there
'Suns' and 'Stars' galore, there is
no 'Sundown.'
