# EXHIBITION ROUNDUP
## Cards Top FSC Then Lose Three 
### 
Stanford's baseball club closed
out its exhibition slate with a
swing through the deep southland
early last week in about as unsuc
cessful a way as any team could.
In three games in the San Diego
area the squad garnered nary a
win.
But the club prefers to forget
about those games and look back
to the duo of tilts against Fresno
State College when exhibition
games are discussed. At the tail
end of winter quarter Stanford
bagged two thrillers from the
Fresno boys, with both wins com
ing in the final inning- one in the
10th.
Back on March 7 the Indians
pushed home the necessary two
runs in the bottom of the ninth to
turn back FSC, 5-4. 'Second-sacker
A 1 Shaw scored the first of the
pair after reaching first <>n a field
er's choice. Centerfielder Ben Rob
inson's bunt advanced him to sec
ond. Both moved up a base on a
sneak bunt by left fielder Parker
Olsen, and both scored when right
fielder Rich DeFabio singled.
Cards Capitalize
Behind, 4-0, going into the -sev
enth, the Cards capitalized on ;in
error, two walks, a double by
third-baseman Jim Burk and sin

gles by Robinson and Olson to
score three times. The Cards' third
pitcher in the game, Dick Wil
liams. was credited with the win.
As if this weren't enough excite
ment for one week end, Stanford,
behind since the second inning,
drove home two runs in the eighth
to tie their Saturday game with
Fresno, then scored the tie-break
er in the 10th.
Olsen scored the winner from
second base with ihe help of Jim
Bulk's single. Burk had a fine
day at the plate with three hits

and four RBl's. ITis single scored
Olsen in the fourth, and a three
bagger sent in ivvo in tho eighth.
Olsen and DeFabio each added
two hits to the cause.
Trouble with Marines
Heading south, the Indians ran
into their first trouble against the
San Diego Marine recruits Mon
day of last week. Marine Ernie
Pyles' homer in the eighth gave
the service club a 3-2 win.
Against San Diego State the In
dians failed to move a runner
home from scoring position 11
times and left 11 men on base in
dropping a 5-3 tilt.
Williams' two for two at the
plate and DeFabio's double were
stand-out marks for Stanford.
Before advancing to CIBA play
with UCLA over the week end,
the Cards met the Camp Pendle
ton Marines in Oeeanside last
Wednesday. Stanford gave up 12
hits to the Marines, two doubles
and three singles of which ac

counted for the opposition's three
scores, all earned.
Ben Robinson scored the lone
Stanford run after doubling to

open Ihe sixth. ITo advanced on
catcher Ralph Holding's single
and a sacrifice fly from the bat
of Jim Burk.
