### 
BULLETIN
Famed Stanford student rendezvous, Rossotti's Beer Garden, was
destroyed by fire early this morning after a three-alarm blaze broke
out just as the place was closing.
Cause of the fire, according to Portola Valley firemen, could not
be determined readily, but it is suspected the conflagration began

because of faulty wiring near the
grill.
As far as could be determined,
there were no injuries. The build
ing was practically deserted pre
ceding the 2 a.m. closing hour.
Time of the fire was estimated at
1:42 a.m.
Rossotti's, 3915 Alpine Rd., had
been well known to generations of
Stanford students as a favorite
beer-drinking haunt. Prior to the
recent formation of the Alcoholic
Beverages Control, under-age stu
dents often found Rossotti's a con
venient place to purchase beer.
One year ago a raid caused Ros
sotti's to close down for nearly
two months. During this period
Ihe ownership changed hands.
There had been no trouble since
then.
Three Kappa Sigs were witness
es to the blaze. One of them, iden
tified only as "Soaker," told The
Daily he and his companions were
just finishing their last pitcher
when they noticed what looked
like electrical flashes coming from
behind the grill.
"We yelled Tor the manager,
who was in the back room," said
Soaker, "but before he came out
the whole grill whs on fire. He
ran for bucket of water, but the
fire spread too rapidly. We tried
to stomp it out, and I ran to the
phone and called the fire depart
ment.
Soaker went on to say that the
roof collapsed only five minutes
after the fire began. Within 12
minutes the frame structure had
been burned practically to the
ground.
"We could hear I he beer bottles
exploding inside." Soaker said.
"Then we heard the large kegs ex
plode, and the fizzle as the beer
quenched some of the fire. Boy,
was it hot!"
"Yeah," one of the others re
marked, "and all that beer going
to waste!"
Before proceeding further, the
reader should glance ;it the calen
dar and remind himself that today
is April Fool's Day.
