# What's it like to be with IBM?

"Like many other seniors," Gerry Shultz recalls, "I
was not sure what I wanted to do, except that I wanted
to work in electronics. At the time of my interview with
IBM, I knew nothing of computers. However, a tour
of the IBM Laboratory impressed me greatly—its
orderliness, the friendliness—and particularly, the
small-group project system."
Gerry Shultz came to IBM in 1951, right after grad
uation from the University of Cincinnati. Assigned to
the Advanced Research and Development Group as a
Technical Engineer, he obtained —"with the patient
help of experienced engineers"—practical knowledge
in circuit design. Since these circuits were used to test
barrier grid storage tubes in computer operation, he
developed a knowledge of computers.
A new area in a new field
Tn 1953, an IBM group using a 701 computer for scien
tific investigation needed a circuits man to build a
flying spot scanner as an input device for the computer.
This assignment gave Gerry Shultz his first experience
with simulation studies. The group was working on a

Character Recognition
project. The scanner
automatically convert
ed letters and digits
from visual to digital
form. The computer
helped the group to
evaluate large samples
of data to determine
what properties were
worth while in distin
guishing one character
from another. After
building the scanner,
he learned to program

the computer, and stayed with the project. By 1955,
the group had expanded into the Information Research
Department. Today it embraces such projects as
Information Theory, Switching Theory, Psychology,
Theory of Automata, Character and Speech Recogni
tion. All projects use the computer as a research tool.
Receives promotions
During his career at IBM, Gerry Shultz has received
two promotions. In 1954, he became an Associate Engi
neer. In 1957, he was made Project Engineer, and is
currently working on the Speech Recognition project
of Information Research. "We have just completed
equipment to convert speech into digital form for com
puting input," he reports. "Our work is now the analysis

degree. Here he reviews his progress and tells about
one of the new careers in the electronic computer field.

of speech. Much like Character Recognition, it is

concerned with the
question, 'What prop
erties does the acoustic
signal possess which
will aid in classifying
speech sounds, one
from another?'
"My career is quite
typical of the many in
teresting ones which
the electronic computer
has opened up at IBM.
The useful output of
Information Research
and other Research
groups is used in test

systems. These systems arc then further developed into
larger equipment prototypes. Throughout this flow to a
manufactured product many interesting and challeng
ing problems must be met and solved."

This profile is just one example of what it's like to be
with IBM. There are many other excellent opportuni
ties for well-qualified college men in Research, Devel
opment, Manufacturing, Sales and Applied Science.
