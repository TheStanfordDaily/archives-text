# THE
						Finish Line

Outlook After Texas
If performances at last weekend's Texas Relays are any indica
tion, there's hound to be plenty of improvement in this year's track
learn in comparison with the last few seasons.
Some of the potential began to be realized, especially in middle
and long distances, as the Cards finished a surprising third in their
first trip to the Austin meet. More than 70 schools sent competitors.
Maury Graves' showing was among the best, and certainly the
most heartening for Indian spike fans.
Two years ago, Graves showed indications of becoming Stanford's
bests-ever distance man. He'came along fast at the end of that year

and ran two miles in 9:08.9. the
fastest mark ever turned in by
an Indian.
But last spring was a different
story. Three different bouts with
colds and flu weakened him and
sporadic training was the result.
Graves had one really good race,
when he outkicked Occidental's
John Kerr in a dual meet here.
Hut Graves was still five seconds
over his sophomore mark, and
the one good effort didn't com
pensate for a series of poor ones.
Friday, Graves got down into
the class where he belongs. His
9:04.9 for the eight laps was of
course a new school mark. And
it was also a new Texas Relays
record, wiping out the old record
by 25 seconds.
It's true that Graves didn't
have to race IJSC's Max Truex,
the nation's premiere collegiate
distance runner. But it's also a
fact that Truex has yet to get
under 9:06 this spring.

Truex, the present intercolle
giate record holder at 8:55, will naturally he the favorite over Graves
when the two meet in Los Angeles Saturday in the Stanford! JSC
dual meet but don't discount the possibility of an upset.
Look Out for Ernie Cunliffe
Half miler Ernie Cunliffe and his 1:50.9 anchor lap on the Indian
sprint medley relay team was another big surprise. Just a couple of
weeks ago, I was talking with Cunliffe and half-jokingly asked him
when he'd break into the l:50's. lie said he wasn't sure, but now
in his first good chance, he goes and does it. Look for him to be
well under 1:50 before long.
Cunliffe's excellent showing is all the more encouraging when ii
is seen that he still has another two years of competition. A leg
injury forced him to sit out last year, so he's still a soph in eligibility.
Cunliffe's showing isn't really too surprising. As a high school
senior in 1955, he won the ( IF Southern Section SSO crown in a
record 1:54.7. The following week in the California state meet in
Los Angeles, Cunlifl'c had some of the worst luck possible.
He was leading in the homestretch, but fell just at the f inish line.
His torso didn't cross the finish line, so while he lay there, I he field
went hy. Thus, ihe state's best half-miler didn't even gel a place in
the event.
Everyone thought Cunliffe would end up at 1(1.A, including
Bruin officials. But he never really gave UCLA much consideration,
and wound up here. His frosh year was good, although he didn't
better his 1:54.7.
Now, however, Cunliffe is really beginning to get flown into the

ranks of the nation's top colle
gians.
There were plenty of other In
dians who looked good at Austin.
Dick Lassen ran 880's in 1:53.2
and 1:43.8 —his two best-ever
marks. Like Cunlilfe, Lassen has
two more years of eligibility af
ter this season.
l)on Chesarek with his 47.-1
opening lap on the sprint medley
quartet finally got back to the
form he showed against Fresno
State last year. Ches ran 47.7 in
that race, but never came close
to it again. Now he appears
ready again, although it will take
a couple more races to determine
whether or not Chesarek is going
to have a consistently good sea
son.
Kent Hansen, off his 24-9 crow
hop in the broad jump, may give
Stanford its second 2fj-footer in
two years. He's gone along in
the 23-foot range for two years,
but those days may be past. And
John Kelly figures to be close be
hind Hansen. Kelly crowed at
24-4 and should come along in
the next few weeks.
Dean Smith continued to look
good in the sprints—2l.9 around
a curve in the 220, and 9.8 in the
100 as he missed qualifying for
the finals by a hair. Armand De-
VVeese fouled on a discus effort
of 162 feet, or he, too, might
have been in the finals.
Then, of course, there are the
two men whom nobody is worry
ing about—Cluiek Cobb and Nor
man Lloyd.
Cobb caught a few elbows and
hurdles in the high stick finals
so got only third. Bui his 14.2
in a heat and a blistering 21.7
220 on a relay leg around a curve
give further indications that the
Indian captain is in line for a
great season.
Lloyd whisked an 880 in 1:52.3
and came back with a 4:15.1 mile
under difficult circumstances.
Lloyd is another man with lots of
eligibility left, and so it looks like
the distances in particular are go
ing to be in good hands here light
on through the spring of 1!M!0.
