# Code Dialing Offers New Difficulties
## 
### Doug Willis 
Stanford students may now
dial station - to - station telephone
calls directly to many cities in
California and throughout the
United States, but have been run
ning into problems and unexpect
ed expenses from the conven
ience.
The problem is misdialing.
With the new telephone service a
misdialed number is almost cer
tain to connect with someone,
and it may hook into a long-dis
tance direct dialing line to as far
away as New York, Texas or Mil
pitas.
In case of misdialing, the
charge for the call may be ad
justed. The procedure is to ask
the person answering the call for
the name of the place reached.
Then, after hanging up, the op
erator must be dialed immediate
ly and told lhat a wrong number
has been dialed. She should be
given the number of the phone
called from and the place
reached.
Codes Used
Recently the Pacific Telephone
and Telegraph Company connect
ed the Palo Alto area into the
new national Direct Distance
Dialing network. The DDD net
work divides the United States
and Canada into more than 100
dialing areas, each identified by
its own three digit Area Code.
To phone a number in a dis
tant area, the three-digit area
code is dialed and then the phone
number within that area is
dialed. The operator is not con
tacted and special e 1 e c t r on i c
equipment keeps an accurate rec
ord of the call for billing pur
poses.
DDD may be used only for sta
tion-to-station calls, and the oper
ator must still be called for per
son-to-person, collect and credit
card calls and calls from pay
phones.
Stanford is in area 115, which
includes most ofvthe north coast
of California. Most major popu
lation center s in the United
States and Canada are now in the
DDD network. For example, New
York City may be dialed directly
by using the prefix 212, its area
code number, before a New York
number; P"ort Worth, Tex., has
the area code 817, and Los An
geles is in area 213.
Free Listings
Local Pacific Telephone and'
Telegraph Company business of
fices have free complete listings
of areas and new telephone direc
tories will have DDD lists.
Local features of DDD now per
mit any non-pay phone to call any
other phone in the area directly
without area prefix or calling the
operator. Points as far north as
Eureka and as far south as Gil
roy may be called directly with
out using area codes from DAven
port phones.
According to Martin Johnson,
ASSU business manager, several
living groups have recently re
ceived bills for long distance calls
they were not aware of making.
He recommends inquiring about
the place called on all wrong
numbers to avoid unnecessary
charges.
