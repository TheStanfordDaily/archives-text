## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—President
Eisenhower vetoed a bill to freeze
crop price supports yesterday,
without yielding an inch on his
flexible farm program.
Attacking the veto vigorously,
congressional Democrats decided
to take the issue to the home folk
during an April 3-14 Easter vaca
tion before attempting an uphill
effort to override the veto.
In a message which Senator
Young (R-S.D.) told the Senate he
assumed was actually written by
Secretary of Agriculture Benson,
Eisenhower called the politically
explosive bill "ill advised from the
standpoint both of the nation and
of our farm families."
