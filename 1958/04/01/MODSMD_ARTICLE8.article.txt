# Students Safe Following Daring Rescue by 'Copter
## Bill Pope in Yosemite Hospital, Others Expected Back Today 
### 
Four Stanford skiers were safe today after a daring helicopter
rescue from the snowclad slopes of the Sierra Nevada.
The four, William Pope, 21, Margaret Meyer, 21, Lcnore Lamb,
21, and Mike Roberts, 21, were flown from their snowbound camp on
a rocky ledge 11,500 feet high in Yosemite National Park bv an Armv

U TULIUIICU X CI 1 f\ UJ ail Xll lllj
helicopter yesterday morning.
Pope is in the Lewis Memorial
Hospital in Yosemite suffering
from a severe respiratory ail
ment, possibly acute pneumonia.
The rescue was made during a
brief lull in Ihe swirling snow
storm that had pinned the skiers
to the ledge since last Thursday.
The helicopter rescue was hailed
by rangers and airmen as one of
the most daring in the history of
the helicopter.
Four Attempts to I.and
Downwash from the helicop
ter's swirling blades kicked up
powdered snow and almost blind
ed the pilots, Chief Warrant Of
ficers J. J. Cooney and William J.
Williams of Fort Ol d. They made
four attempts to land before
bringing the 'copter down on a
ledge, which had been marked off
by one of the women in the ma
rooned group.
The helicopter landed about
200 yards up a steep slope from
where the four had camped. It
took Pope, aided by Roberts and
pushed by Cooney, half an hour
to negotiate the climb.
Private pilot Bob Symons of
Bishop, whose little plane led the
helicopter to the students' rocky
perch, said the weather closed in
almost as soon as the Army ship
left the ledge with the students.
"No Comment"
The pilots said the students had
nothing to say when they first
got to the rescue plane.
"We were too busy trying to
get out of there," they said.
Pope was given oxygen on the
way down to the hospital where
the four students were rushed.
Hospital attendants said all were
cheerful when they arrived. They
added that the two women
seemed to have survived the or
deal better than the men.
Roberts, president of the Al
pine Club, said the greatest con
cern during the four days and
nights on the ledge was for Pope.
"The rest of us were all right,"
he said. "We could get out on our
own, but we couldn't leave Pope.
"We were beginning to worry
a little about what would happen
if the weather closed in and the
rescuers did not arrive by tomor
row night. Our supplies would
have been exhausted by then."
Careful Preparations
Roberts added that the group
"had been very careful in prepa
rations" for the trek across the
Sierras.
"It was just a nasty break that
this happened," he said.
Bart Ilooley, 22, captain of the
ski team, and Max Allen, 22, Uni
versity of California, skied out
of the mountains Thursday to the
Yosemite Ranger Station to bring
word of Pope's illness. Rescue
operations were begun, including
a 10 man land party which turned
back yesterday, after receiving
word of the rescue.
Except for Pope, all the skiers
who started the trip through the
mountains March 22 are expected
to be in classes today.

"We were too busy trying to

Pope was given oxygen on the
way down to the hospital where
the four students were rushed.
Hospital attendants said all were
cheerful when they arrived. They
added that the two women
seemed to have survived the or
deal better than the men.
Roberts, president of the Al
pine Club, said the greatest con
cern during the four days and
nights on the ledge was for Pope.
"The rest of us were all right,"
he said. "We could get out on our
own, but we couldn't leave Pope.
"We were beginning to worry
a little about what would happen
if the weather closed in and the
rescuers did not arrive by tomor
row night. Our supplies would
have been exhausted by then."
Careful Preparations
Roberts added that the group
"had been very careful in prepa
rations" for the trek across the
Sierras.
"It was just a nasty break that
this happened," he said.
Bart Ilooley, 22, captain of the
ski team, and Max Allen, 22, Uni
versity of California, skied out
of the mountains Thursday to the
Yosemite Ranger Station to bring
word of Pope's illness. Rescue
operations were begun, including
a 10 man land party which turned
back yesterday, after receiving
word of the rescue.
Except for Pope, all the skiers
who started the trip through the
mountains March 22 are expected
to be in classes today.

Four Stanford skiers were safe today after a daring helicopter
rescue from the snowclad slopes of the Sierra Nevada.
The four, William Pope, 21, Margaret Meyer, 21, Lcnore Lamb,
21, and Mike Roberts, 21, were flown from their snowbound camp on
a rocky ledge 11,500 feet high in Yosemite National Park bv an Armv

helicopter yesterday morning.
Pope is in the Lewis Memorial
Hospital in Yosemite suffering
from a severe respiratory ail
ment, possibly acute pneumonia.
The rescue was made during a
brief lull in Ihe swirling snow
storm that had pinned the skiers
to the ledge since last Thursday.
The helicopter rescue was hailed
by rangers and airmen as one of
the most daring in the history of
the helicopter.
Four Attempts to I.and
Downwash from the helicop
ter's swirling blades kicked up
powdered snow and almost blind
ed the pilots, Chief Warrant Of
ficers J. J. Cooney and William J.
Williams of Fort Ol d. They made
four attempts to land before
bringing the 'copter down on a
ledge, which had been marked off
by one of the women in the ma
rooned group.
The helicopter landed about
200 yards up a steep slope from
where the four had camped. It
took Pope, aided by Roberts and
pushed by Cooney, half an hour
to negotiate the climb.
Private pilot Bob Symons of
Bishop, whose little plane led the
helicopter to the students' rocky
perch, said the weather closed in
almost as soon as the Army ship
left the ledge with the students.
"No Comment"
The pilots said the students had
nothing to say when they first
got to the rescue plane.
