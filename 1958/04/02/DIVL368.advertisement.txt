"INSURE your INSURABILITY"
Right now you are starting out to build your future estate.
Life Insurance can and will play an important part in this
estate building.
As you progress you will add to your life insurance program
. . . provided you keep your insurability. That's why this
new concept in life insurance (introduced by Bankers Life
Company) is so important to you. For only pennies-a-day
more than the cost of a regular plan, you can guarantee your
insurability to age 40. This means you buy the right to buy
life insurance later — when you can afford it — REGARD
LESS OF HEALTH . . . and at economical standard rates.
There's been nothing like this before. At. 3-year intervals
you can decide whether you want to take advantage of an
option to buy more insurance REGARDLESS OF HEALTH.
This valuable new option guarantees you can have "enough"
life insurance ... it provides a unique way to safeguard
estate creation plans.
Let me give you all the exciting facts. Call me today.
