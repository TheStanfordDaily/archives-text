# Skiers Relate Activities Of Snowbound Weekend
## 
### Barbara Hicks 
Still excited about their week's
adventures, three Stanford skiers
were back on campus yesterday.
Margaret Meyer and Lenore
Lamb, Guthrie House, and Bart
Hooley, off-campus, returned to

the Farm late Monday and Mike
Roberts was expected to return
late last night.
William Pope, off-campus, re
mains hospitalized in the Lewis
Memorial Hospital in Yoscmite
with acute pneumonia.
Miss Meyer, Miss Lamb, Rob
erts and Pope were stranded on
a snow-bound ledge, 11,500 feet
high in the Sierra Nevada iri Yo
scmite National Park four days,
after Pope was taken ill. Hooley
and Max Allen, University of Cal
ifornia, skied out of the moun
tains to get help for the ailing
skiers, starting intensive rescue
operations.
Last night, Miss Meyer and
Miss Lamb, much rested from
their ordeal, said that at no time
were they worried about being
rescued.
Things All Right
"'We were sure everything was
all right," Miss Meyer said. "The
only thing that worried us was
Bill's condition. But he seemed
to get better as the days went
on."
"Saturday we made a sled of
skis and tried to move him. This
failed, but it was then that for
the first time we saw the plane
piloted by Bob Symons of Bishop.
He was very encouraging, drop
ping us notes and supplies," Miss
Meyer continued.
"The three of us could have
made it out easily, but we could
n't leave Bill," she said.
Wonderful Trip
It was a wonderful trip, both
women agreed, except for Pope's
illness.
They told of the beautiful
snowy peaks and slopes on the
climb from June Lake to the
summit of the range. They dis
cussed briefly difficulties with
the first air drop of supplies by
the National Guard. The Guard
plane could not locate the skiers
on its first trip, but was signaled
with a mirror on a second try.
When Pope became so ill he
could go no farther, the women
said they made camp with two
special mountaineers' tents. They
said the weather was clear until
Sunday when, Miss Meyer relat
ed, it snowed two feet.
Snowed In
"We couldn't even "open the
tent flaps," the coed said.
Miss Meyer took care of Pope
during the days spent on the
ledge.
"lie was a little delirious at
first," she said, "but improved as
the days passed."
"When the plane pilot Symons

told us to indicate whether we
needed oxygen, Bill was breath
ing well," Miss Lamb said. "How
ever, we knew we had to get him
to a lower elevation."
If) Miles Out
The quartet was camped 19
miles from its starting point on
the eastern side of the mountains.
They were 26 miles from Yo
semite Valley—the 26 miles which
Hooley and Allen covered in a
day and a half in their race for
help.
"Bait and Max are the real
heroes," Miss Meyer said. "If
it hadn't been for them, we might
not have made it out."
Miss Lamb kept a journal of
the trip and the skiers photo
graphed the area, but the jour
nal and the camera were left be
hind in the swift helicopter res
cue Monday morning.
