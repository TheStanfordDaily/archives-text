CAIRO (/I') Foreign Minister
Mahmoud Fawzi set up a flying
trip to Switzerland yesterday for
talks with UN Secretary General
Dag Ilammarskjold about the
two days of tank and artillery
duels on the Israeli-Syrian bor
der.
The United Arab Republic of
Egypt and Syria has accused Is
rael of aggression in Ihe Lake
Huleh Truce Zone and has asked
for an extraordinary investiga
tion by the UN Security Council.
The clashes erupted Sunday and
Monday and the UN Truce Com
mission ordered cease - fires in
both cases.
Emergency Session
The Israeli Cabinet held an
emergency meeting in Jerusalem
Tuesday to discuss the two bat
tles.
A UN announcement in New
York said the meeting between
Fawzi and Ilammarskjold was ar
ranged before the border clashes
and that they would discuss rela
tions between the United Nations
and the newly established U.A.R.
Border Clashes
But sources in New York said
it was more than likely the bor
der clashes would enter into the
talks. Ilammarskjold has taken a
personal hand in easing tensions
around the Palestine perimeter
before.
A U.A.R. foreign ministry
spokesman said Fawzi would in
form Hammarskjold of "the dan
gerous situation created by the
last Israeli aggressions."
