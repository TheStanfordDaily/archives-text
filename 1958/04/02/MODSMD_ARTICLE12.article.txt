# Eisenhower, Macmillan Oppose USSR Atom Ban
## U.S. Has No Leadership, Says Senator Humphrey 
### 
(Compiled from the Associated Press)
President Eisenhower deliberately chose to continue testing atom
ichydrogen bombs although he knew the Russians were about to
score a "certain propaganda victory" by announcing a halt to their
nuclear tests.
Secretary of State Dulles disclosed yesterday that Eisenhower and

his top advisers made this calcu
lated decision 10 days to two
weeks before Russia sprang its
announcement Monday.
"We deliberately accepted this
propaganda thrust," said Dulles,
"knowing that we were going to
have to take it rather than do
something which we felt was ba
sically unsound."
Senator Humphrey (D - Minn, t
said, "An unbelievable tragedy
has befallen the free world." He
said most Americans have no ap
preciation "of the scope of the
Soviet victory," and added:
"The United States stands be
fore the world without leadership
and without a spokesman."
"I,one Wolf"
Dulles in answering questions
assailed the lone-wolf Soviet ban
as a gesture timed a few weeks
before the United States is to be
gin previously announced nuclear
tests in the Pacific.
He said the Soviet announce
ment had "nothing in it but prop
aganda" because the test ban pro
vides for no outside inspection to
make sure the Kremlin keeps its
word.
Meanwhile, in London Prime
Minister Macmillan resisted pres
sure from some Laborites and re
fused yesterday to follow Rus
sia's lead in announcing a ban on
nuclear weapons tests.
Western Stand
Macmillan held fast to the
Western positions that test sus
pensions are a subject for inter
national negotiation in which
safeguards against cheating can
be worked out.
Macmillan also said:
"I note that the Russian an
nouncement was timed to come
after the completion of an exten
sive and accelerated series of
Russian tests and just before a
series of American tests already
announced by the U.S. govern
ment—and when the current se
ries of British tests is not com
pleted."
He told the House of Commons
Britain has put her faith in the
prospect that a summit confer
ence would settle once and for all
the problems of nuclear tests and
disarmament.
Movement Grows
A movement is growing in Brit
ain for this nation to abandon nu
clear weapons completely. "Ban
the bomb" demonstrat ions arc ex
pected during the Easter week
end.
Some Laborites support the
movement, but the official party
leadership does not. Labor lead
er Hugh Gaitskell and Aneurin
Bevin have pressed Macmillan to
make a positive response to the
Soviet move, however.
Macmillan said a formal state
ment on the British position
"must wait until we have had the
opportunity of consultation with
our allies and partners."

President Eisenhower deliberately chose to continue testing atom
ichydrogen bombs although he knew the Russians were about to
score a "certain propaganda victory" by announcing a halt to their
nuclear tests.
Secretary of State Dulles disclosed yesterday that Eisenhower and

his top advisers made this calcu
lated decision 10 days to two
weeks before Russia sprang its
announcement Monday.
"We deliberately accepted this
propaganda thrust," said Dulles,
"knowing that we were going to
have to take it rather than do
something which we felt was ba
sically unsound."
Senator Humphrey (D - Minn, t
said, "An unbelievable tragedy
has befallen the free world." He
said most Americans have no ap
preciation "of the scope of the
Soviet victory," and added:
"The United States stands be
fore the world without leadership
and without a spokesman."
"I,one Wolf"
Dulles in answering questions
assailed the lone-wolf Soviet ban
as a gesture timed a few weeks
before the United States is to be
gin previously announced nuclear
tests in the Pacific.
He said the Soviet announce
ment had "nothing in it but prop
aganda" because the test ban pro
vides for no outside inspection to
make sure the Kremlin keeps its
word.
Meanwhile, in London Prime
Minister Macmillan resisted pres
sure from some Laborites and re
fused yesterday to follow Rus
sia's lead in announcing a ban on
nuclear weapons tests.
Western Stand
Macmillan held fast to the
Western positions that test sus
pensions are a subject for inter
national negotiation in which
safeguards against cheating can
be worked out.
Macmillan also said:
"I note that the Russian an
nouncement was timed to come
after the completion of an exten
sive and accelerated series of
Russian tests and just before a
series of American tests already
announced by the U.S. govern
ment—and when the current se
ries of British tests is not com
pleted."
He told the House of Commons
Britain has put her faith in the
prospect that a summit confer
ence would settle once and for all
the problems of nuclear tests and
disarmament.
Movement Grows
A movement is growing in Brit
ain for this nation to abandon nu
clear weapons completely. "Ban
the bomb" demonstrat ions arc ex
pected during the Easter week
end.
Some Laborites support the
movement, but the official party
leadership does not. Labor lead
