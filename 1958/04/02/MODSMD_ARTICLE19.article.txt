# Raise Faculty Salaries
## 
### 
Tnr proposal a group of Princeton professors
has been circulating among college faculties
aeross the country advocating doubling the
salaries of professors over a five-year period
necessarily raises the issue of higher education's
position in the great scheme of American
soeiety.
The acceptance of the ohvious assumption
that education is of extreme importance to our
increasingly complex way of life leads 1o the
acceptance of the Princeton ideas —that teach
ing in a university must he a full-time profes
sion, and that professors' salaries must he at
least as high as those of business and industry
positions —which often require less training—
so as to attract promising students to teaching
and make their jobs more productive.
The other main point of the Princeton pro
posal, that tuitions should be increased to cover
the cost of services rendered, also seems rea
sonable. But from Stanford's viewpoint its ac
ceptance might prove disastrous.
Stanford is in a unique position among Amer
ican universities. Surrounded by large, state
supported universities with low tuitions, it
must keep its own tuition low enough so as not
to offset the snob-appeal—as well as the gen
uine advantages—of the chief private univer
sity on the West Coast.
(hi the other hand, Stanford's ambitions
make it essential 1 <» compete with the private
universities of the East, whose monopoly on

education in that area is perhaps greater than
that of the state universities in the West. To be
able to compete and attract an outstanding
faculty, Stanford's salaries must be at least as
high as those of the eastern "prestige""' colleges.
So Stanford's position is poor: it must pay
eastern salaries or better, yet it cannot raise its
tuition as high as the eastern colleges can.
Funds for the very necessary faculty pay raise
must therefore come from other sources. We
suggest that the money be contributed by the
federal government, with no strings attached—
not only to Stanford, but to all needy private
universities.
Government welfare programs are more and
more taking on the responsibility of assuring
an adequate living to the nation's workers. U hv
can't the Government also assume such a re
sponsibility for college professors, whose wel
fare is infinitely more important in the long
run to the entire country?
Out of the billions of dollars the Eisenhower
Administration is prepared to distribute to in
crease spending and avoid a depression, surely
it could find a few million for the important
group of consumers on college faculties.
Such a government grant would not have to
be looked upon as charity; it would rather be
a long-needed reward for contributions college
professors have been and are making to the
national welfare.

So Stanford's position is poor: it must pay
eastern salaries or better, yet it cannot raise its
tuition as high as the eastern colleges can.
