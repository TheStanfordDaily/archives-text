Hustle in Kerum

only the 15 players that start the
game and is forced to play short

minute mark, and Kyrk Reid tied

another 38-yard kick 10 minutes
later. The two teams played an
even game the rest of the half.
Card Downfall
The second half proved to be
Stanford's downfall, as Lenehan
took advantage of two bad passes

ehan wrapped up the game for
the Aussies with a 40-yard pen
alty kick.
The Stanford team played well
as a unit with no outstanding
