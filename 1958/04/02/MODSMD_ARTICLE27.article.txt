## Thinclads Meet Trojans at Oxy; Eyes on New Card Highjumper 
### 
The nation's strongest track
and field team will provide the
opposition for fast - improving
Stanford when Payton Jordan's
Indians open the dual-meet phase
of the 1958 spike season Satur
day.
The Cards will run head-on into
Southern California in a meet
that will be held at Occidental
College's Patterson Field. The
Coliseum is being readied for the
Dodgers, East LAJC Stadium
wasn't available, and there aren't
any seats at SC's Bovard Field—
hence, the unusual location of the
meet.
Jordan has named a 22-man
team to go south for the meet,
but said Ihere was a chance that
as many as three more men
might he added if late-week work
outs show they have a chance to
score.
The newcomer to the list who

will be watched with special in
terest is high • jumper Steve
Coughlin. He just transferred to
Stanford this quarter, but has al
ready been over 6-4 in high
jump workouts this spring.
Coughlin gives the Indians
strength in an event that had
been the team's weakest before
he came. Me can't be expected to
beat Olympic champion Charlie
Dumas Saturday, but should give
Junior Singe of the Trojans a
strong battle for second in the
event Troy had earlier figured
to sweep.
Highlight of the meet may be
the hurdle duels between Stan
ford's Chuck Cobb and the Tro
jans' Bob Lawson. Cobb will be
seeking revenge for the two lick
ings Lawson handed him in the
PCC championship meet last
May.
Cobb has already been down to

14.2 in the highs this year, anri
had an unofficial 14.0 last year.
Lawson has a 14.1 clocking to his
credit this year, but was aided
by a 15-mile-per-hour wind.
While Cobb will be the only
Stanford entry in the highs, Jor
dan has named Len Hates and
John Kelly to help out in the
lows.
Dean Smith and Norm Pease
will carry most of the burden for
Stanford in the sprints. Each has
a 9.8 to his credit, and it will
probably take at least that good
a time to beat Dave Rollings
worth or Larry Gilbert of the
southlanders.
