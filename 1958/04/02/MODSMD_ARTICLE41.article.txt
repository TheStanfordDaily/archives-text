# Vandalism Causes Village Hall Closing; Residents Complain
## 
### 
Stanford students living at the
Village recently expressed concern
over the action of Stanford Re
search Institute in closing a por
tion of a hallway which connects
two parts of the Village.
Near the end of winter quarter
SRI posted signs reading "SRI
Employees Only" at ends of the
hallway, and SRI police began
forcing students to use an outside
pathway, even during rainy
weather.
The disputed hallway connects
the dormitory area with the Vil
lage director's office, laundry, bar
ber shop, grocery store and audi
torium.
The hallway, which had been
used by Village residents for 10
years, was closed after SRI dis
covered some light bulbs broken.

An SRI spokesman said that
"since these things happened after
SRl's closing time, we knew it had
to be Stanford students doing it."
Several students, however, have
reported seeing small children
playing in the hallway.
