## U.S. Recession May Hit Europe 
### 
GENEVA (A') The American business recession is likely to cast
its shadow on Western Europe through most of 1938, the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe said yesterday.
The commission's annual survey said an economic revival in the
United States "seems unlikely before the autumn at the earliest."

It suggested that European gov
ernments could cushion the im
pact by an immediate relaxation
of restrictive measures such as
credit controls.
The 400 - page report warned
that the anti-inflationary restric
tive policies of most West Euro
pean governments not only failed
in their purpose, but "contributed
in no small way to the present
decline in the rate of European
economic expansion."
The rate of growth of Western
Europe's economy last year fell
before the 1955 level for the sec
ond year in succession. The sur
vey predicted that during the cur
rent year the three major West
European industrial countries—
Britain, France and Western Ger
many—"are all likely to accentu
ate the tendency toward stagna
tion . . . that was visible in the
second half of 1957."
"Although the other West Eu
ropean countries may for a time
succeed in pursuing a course dif
ferent from these three," the re
port said, "they are bound finally
to fall into line."
The American recession is ex
pected to affect Europe both di
rectly and indirectly, the commis
sion declared. American pur
chases from Europe are likely to
decline, and a similar decline in
U.S. purchases from overseas
countries will reduce their pur
chasing power in Europe.
The survey painted a gloomy
picture of immediate economic
prospects in the United States,
where, it said, the decline of per
sonal incomes will be increas
ingly felt on consumer expendi
tures." "Surveys pointing to re
duced investment in 1958 are in
creasingly supported by evidence
of sharp declines in orders," it
added.
