# Plaster Falls, Perils Class
## 
### 
If the students in Professor
Anatole Mazour's Soviet foreign
policy class glance occasionally at
the ceiling tomorrow morning,
chances are they're not day
dreaming or staring vacantly into
space even though the class is of
fered at 8 a.m.
After yesterday's performance
even the professor can find it in
his heart to excuse the wayward
glances.
The quarter's first class started
peaceably enough when halfway
through the hour a loud crash
shook the room. A few students
giggled nervously. Others on the
far side of the room thought an
extraordinarily large pile of
books had fallen over.
Gasps of dismay were heard
seconds later when students no
ticed a gaping hole in the ceiling,
kain seeping through the roof
had weakened the piaster and a
large section had crashed down
into the room, miraculously miss
ing students by inches.
A few students shifted scats al
Mazour's suggestion and class re
sumed. Minutes later a second
large section collapsed, shower
ing floor, seats and students with
dust but again no one was in
jured.
This time every student seated
under the threatening section of
ceiling moved to the opposite side
of the room.
Mazour reassured the class,
"This happens every so often."
Nevertheless, if the rain con
tinues, he may find his class no
ticeably reduced in si/,e. Who can
stand such unexpected goings-on
at 8 in the morning?
