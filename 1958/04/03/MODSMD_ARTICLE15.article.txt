# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## Europe Revisited 
### Walter Lippmann 
(Editor's Nolo: Now York Herald Tribune
columnist Walter IJppmann has just return
ed from an extensive tour of Europe. Reports
on his travels will appear on Tuesdays and
Thursdays in The Daily.)
Traveling about in Europe, as I have been doing,
ii has, of course, been only too obvious thai there
is a great decline in American influence. The
immediate cause of it is, no doubt, ihe debility of
the President's role in world affairs, and its ac
companiment perhaps its inevitable accompani
ment the negativism of Secretary Dulles. But
what I learned in Scandinavia, in Poland, in Ger
many. in Britain and France, persuaded me that
the compelling cause of the decline of our influ
ence is that the American view of the main Euro
pean issues is becoming out of date, is being by
passed by events, and that when we talk about
Europe, and Germany, and the captive states, and
Russia we sound rather like old codgers talking
about the past.
I became most aware of this as I began to
realize how very different is the official view of
Germany from what one finds virtually every
where in Europe. We have been taking it for
granted that the hope of the future in Europe
turns on the reunification and revival of Ger
many. The truth, as 1 found it, is that the World
War is not forgotten, indeed that the memory of
it is reviving, and that to understand the Euro
pean situation as a whole it is necessary to take
account of this growing fear of German domina
tion. The spectacle of West Germany's economic
recovery plus the growing knowledge that there
is also a remarkable recovery in East Germany
have revived the remembrance of the war and
played a very big part in affairs.
I had not realized this before I went abroad this
time. Always until then I had believed that Ger
many, even if reunited, was too small to be a
world power again. What I had failed to realize
is that all things are relative, and that relative
to the rest of Europe—excluding the U.S.A. and
Ihe U.S.S.R.—a reunited Germany would now be
the foremost power. In London as in Warsaw,
and in the neutralist countries as well, there is a
deep anxiety that this powerful reunited Ger
many would become the ally of either Ihe U.S.A.
or the U.S.S.R., or that it would hold the balance
of power between them.
The practical effect of this is that if is hard to
find anyone who does not want to put off as long
as possible the reunion of the two Gerinanys.
This works out in a curious way. Those who are
affiliated with the West cling publicly and offi
cially to the Dulles-Adenauer formula of free
elections to unify Germany. This is not because
they believe in the formula hut because they know
that Germany cannot be unified under that for
mula. Those who are affiliated with the East
support the Russians in German affairs, counting
on the Russians to protect them against a re
united Germany. There is no doubt at all, it
seems to me, that Poland, for example, longs for
the withdrawal of the Red army and yet, out of
tear ol Germany, hopes that until there is some

other kind of settlement of the German question,
the Russians will stay in East Germany.

It is in West Germany that the official Ameri
can-German policy seems particularly antiquated.
Whatever their neighbors may fear from them,
ihe great mass of the West Germans are not
dreaming of domination by a united Germany.
They are worrying about a united Germany.
Some are worrying because they fear a revival
of German nationalism, many more because a
united Germany would probably be predominant
ly Socialist, others because it would be extremely
difficult to integrate the colleetivist economy of
eastern Germany and the capitalist economy of
western Germany.
For reasons like these, the Adenauer-Dulles for
mula has a fading role among the Germans. Few
expect the formula to work, and few really want
it to work. What we are going to see, it seems
to me, is—as, unfortunately, only the Russians
have had the wit to suggest—negotiations be
tween the two German governments. As a matter
of fact, there is already negotiation about the
currency and about trade, all of it nominally at
a technical rather than at a political level. These
negotiations will almost certainly broaden greatly
into some sort of political arrangement which
might one day take the form of a dual state.
The West Germans will not break with the
Western powers, and the East Germans will not
break with the Soviet Union. They will seek to
obtain the practical advantages of reunion with
out the serious political and psychological dis
advantages.

This process in The two Germanys will, I am
convinced, promote and will be accompanied by
a thinning out of the military forces in Germany
and in central Europe. There i-s every reason to
believe that the future of central Europe lies with
the principle of disengagement. But the applica
tion of the principle will be gradual, and the full
application of it may not come for a great many
more years than anyone can calculate about.
These developments will, I believe, have ac
quired great momentum in about three years.
I say three years because at the end of that time
Adenauer is not likely to be in power, and there
will be new governments in Britain, France and
the United States. Put another way, the post-war
governments will have been replaced and with
them the post-war policies which are now rapidly
becoming antiquated.

The decline of American influence in Europe
will, I believe, continue as long as our funda
mental conception of the future in the two Ger
manys and in eastern Europe consists of the illu
sions and stereotypes which the Eisenhower Ad
ministration inherited from the Truman Admin
istration. For they belong to an era when the
balance of power and the technology of war and
of diplomacy were quite different from what they
are today.
