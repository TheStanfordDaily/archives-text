# SRI, Village Friends Now
## 
### 
Stanford Village residents and
Stanford Research Institute are
friends again after an article in
yesterday's Daily brought prompt
settlement of a minor misunder
standing.
A sign at a hallway entrance
which originally read "SRI Em
ployees Only" was hastily
changed to say "SRI Employees
and Stanford Village Residents
Only."
The latter is what the sign
should have said all the time, an
SRI spokesman explained.
"II was all a mistake caused by
a misinterpretation of instruc
tions," he said.
The restrictions were meant to
apply only lo non-residents who
occasionally used the corridor as
a short cut and who have caused
damage lo Institute facilities.
"Village residents are, of
course, welcorrte to use the corri
dors at all times," the SRI
spokesman added.
