# Spikers Out to Upset SC
## 
### 
The University of Southern
California elaims to have the
best track team in its recent his
lory. If this is the case anil
plenty of track experts say it
isn't then maybe S t a n 112 or d
shouldn't even bother to go to
Los Angeles for their dual meet
with the Trojans Saturday.
Payton Jordan and his Indians
don't quite see things that way,
however. The Cards see them
selves as strengthened in areas
where they were woefully weak
in 19.77- and last year Troy went
home with only a 72-59 victory.
Norman Lloyd, Ernie Cunliffe
and Maury Graves head up a
greatly • improved Stanford dis
tance team. Last year against
IJSC, the Indians were blanked
27-0 in the 880, mile and two-mile.
None of these races will be
cinches for any Stanford man
this weekend, but its' a certainty
that the Cards will at least pick
up some points.
Roiled Double
Lloyd will run the difficult
mile-880 double, but has a good
chance to score in both events.
He ripped off a 1:52.3 half-mile
leg at the Texas Relays, only two
tenths slower than the fastest
Trojan, Tom Anderson, has run.
USC has depth in the two-lap
per, however, with Bob Shank
land at 1:53.3 and VVes McLeod
at 1:55.0. McLeod, like Lloyd,
will probably double in the mile.
Cunliffe has the best time of any
half-miler, 1:50.9.
In the mile, McLeod has regis
tered a 4:11.2 this year, and
sophomore Wayne Lemons has
gone the distance in 4:17.0.
Lloyd, then, should be in the
thick of this race since he's done
4:15.1 in a relay race where he
had to practically sprint the first
lap to catch up with the field.
Upset Possibility
Graves is the experts' second
choice in the two-mile, but he
could conceivably upset Max Tru
ex of Troy. Truex has still not
fully recovered from a cross
country incident, when he liter-

I ally took gas.
Truex was leading in a road
race with only a few blocks to
go when he suddenly passed out
from the exhaust of motorcycles
which were escorting the race.
Sophomore Bob Monzingo will
go for Stanford in both the mile
and two-mile, and Dick Lassen
will be in the half. Lassen looked
particularly good at Austin, and
could crack into the scoring. He'll
also go in the 440.
440 Threat
Don Chesarek represents Stan
ford's biggest gun in the quarter.
His 47.4 last week put him more
than a full second ahead of Ted
Smith of the Trojans. But if An
derson moves down to the 440,
Chesarek could be in for trouble.
Bob Besse, one of the strongest
of the Stanford runners, is also
a threat in the 440, although he'll
have to run his best race to get
in the point column.
Toss-up Event
Most unpredictable event of
the meet is likely to be the broad
jump, where both clubs have
good men in the same range.
Lavvson is SC's best at 24-8, but
his mark was made with the aid
of that 15-mph wind.
Jess Mortenson's club has a
second 24 - footer in sophomore
Charles Lindsay, who's hit that
mark right on the nose. Stan
ford counters with Kent Hansen,
John Kelly and Chuck Peterson.
Hansen broke 24 feet for the
first time at the Texas Relays,
and Kelly was four inches over
that figure on a crow-hop.
Problem for Cards
Stanford could be in had
trouble in the pole vault, where
USC has a trio of 14-footers. Gene
Freudenthal, Ernie Bullard and
Jerry Hren each have been right
at the 14-foot height this year.
Mike Franchetti, who climbs a
little higher in the 13's every
time out but has yet to break 14,
will be Stanford's hope to break
up the possible Trojan domina
tion of this event.

tance team. Last year against
IJSC, the Indians were blanked
27-0 in the 880, mile and two-mile.
None of these races will be
cinches for any Stanford man
this weekend, but its' a certainty
that the Cards will at least pick
up some points.
Roiled Double
Lloyd will run the difficult
mile-880 double, but has a good
chance to score in both events.
He ripped off a 1:52.3 half-mile
leg at the Texas Relays, only two
tenths slower than the fastest
Trojan, Tom Anderson, has run.
USC has depth in the two-lap
per, however, with Bob Shank
land at 1:53.3 and VVes McLeod
at 1:55.0. McLeod, like Lloyd,
will probably double in the mile.
Cunliffe has the best time of any
half-miler, 1:50.9.
In the mile, McLeod has regis
tered a 4:11.2 this year, and
sophomore Wayne Lemons has
gone the distance in 4:17.0.
Lloyd, then, should be in the
thick of this race since he's done
4:15.1 in a relay race where he
had to practically sprint the first
lap to catch up with the field.
Upset Possibility
Graves is the experts' second
choice in the two-mile, but he
could conceivably upset Max Tru
ex of Troy. Truex has still not
fully recovered from a cross
country incident, when he liter-

I ally took gas.
Truex was leading in a road
race with only a few blocks to
go when he suddenly passed out
from the exhaust of motorcycles
which were escorting the race.
Sophomore Bob Monzingo will
go for Stanford in both the mile
and two-mile, and Dick Lassen
will be in the half. Lassen looked
particularly good at Austin, and
could crack into the scoring. He'll
also go in the 440.
440 Threat
Don Chesarek represents Stan
ford's biggest gun in the quarter.
His 47.4 last week put him more
than a full second ahead of Ted
Smith of the Trojans. But if An
derson moves down to the 440,
Chesarek could be in for trouble.
Bob Besse, one of the strongest
of the Stanford runners, is also
a threat in the 440, although he'll
have to run his best race to get
in the point column.
Toss-up Event
Most unpredictable event of
the meet is likely to be the broad
jump, where both clubs have
good men in the same range.
Lavvson is SC's best at 24-8, but
his mark was made with the aid
of that 15-mph wind.
Jess Mortenson's club has a
second 24 - footer in sophomore
Charles Lindsay, who's hit that
mark right on the nose. Stan
ford counters with Kent Hansen,
John Kelly and Chuck Peterson.
Hansen broke 24 feet for the
first time at the Texas Relays,
and Kelly was four inches over
that figure on a crow-hop.
Problem for Cards
Stanford could be in had
trouble in the pole vault, where
USC has a trio of 14-footers. Gene
Freudenthal, Ernie Bullard and
Jerry Hren each have been right
at the 14-foot height this year.
Mike Franchetti, who climbs a
little higher in the 13's every
time out but has yet to break 14,
will be Stanford's hope to break
up the possible Trojan domina
tion of this event.

land at 1:53.3 and VVes McLeod
at 1:55.0. McLeod, like Lloyd,
will probably double in the mile.
Cunliffe has the best time of any
half-miler, 1:50.9.
In the mile, McLeod has regis
tered a 4:11.2 this year, and
sophomore Wayne Lemons has
gone the distance in 4:17.0.
Lloyd, then, should be in the
thick of this race since he's done
4:15.1 in a relay race where he
had to practically sprint the first
lap to catch up with the field.
Upset Possibility
Graves is the experts' second
choice in the two-mile, but he
could conceivably upset Max Tru
ex of Troy. Truex has still not
fully recovered from a cross
country incident, when he liter-

I ally took gas.
Truex was leading in a road
race with only a few blocks to
go when he suddenly passed out
from the exhaust of motorcycles
which were escorting the race.
Sophomore Bob Monzingo will
go for Stanford in both the mile
and two-mile, and Dick Lassen
will be in the half. Lassen looked
particularly good at Austin, and
could crack into the scoring. He'll
also go in the 440.
440 Threat
Don Chesarek represents Stan
ford's biggest gun in the quarter.
His 47.4 last week put him more
than a full second ahead of Ted
Smith of the Trojans. But if An
derson moves down to the 440,
Chesarek could be in for trouble.
Bob Besse, one of the strongest
of the Stanford runners, is also
a threat in the 440, although he'll
have to run his best race to get
in the point column.
Toss-up Event
Most unpredictable event of
the meet is likely to be the broad
jump, where both clubs have
good men in the same range.
Lavvson is SC's best at 24-8, but
his mark was made with the aid
of that 15-mph wind.
Jess Mortenson's club has a
second 24 - footer in sophomore
Charles Lindsay, who's hit that
mark right on the nose. Stan
ford counters with Kent Hansen,
John Kelly and Chuck Peterson.
Hansen broke 24 feet for the
first time at the Texas Relays,
and Kelly was four inches over
that figure on a crow-hop.
Problem for Cards
Stanford could be in had
trouble in the pole vault, where
USC has a trio of 14-footers. Gene
Freudenthal, Ernie Bullard and
Jerry Hren each have been right
at the 14-foot height this year.
Mike Franchetti, who climbs a
little higher in the 13's every
time out but has yet to break 14,
will be Stanford's hope to break
up the possible Trojan domina
tion of this event.


DEAN SMITH—STANFORD'S BEST SPRINTER
Looks for Twin Wins Against USC Saturday
The University of Southern
California elaims to have the
best track team in its recent his
lory. If this is the case anil
plenty of track experts say it
isn't then maybe S t a n 112 or d
shouldn't even bother to go to
Los Angeles for their dual meet
with the Trojans Saturday.
Payton Jordan and his Indians
don't quite see things that way,
however. The Cards see them
selves as strengthened in areas
where they were woefully weak
in 19.77- and last year Troy went
home with only a 72-59 victory.
Norman Lloyd, Ernie Cunliffe
and Maury Graves head up a
greatly • improved Stanford dis
tance team. Last year against
IJSC, the Indians were blanked
27-0 in the 880, mile and two-mile.
None of these races will be
cinches for any Stanford man
this weekend, but its' a certainty
that the Cards will at least pick
up some points.
Roiled Double
Lloyd will run the difficult
mile-880 double, but has a good
chance to score in both events.
He ripped off a 1:52.3 half-mile
leg at the Texas Relays, only two
tenths slower than the fastest
Trojan, Tom Anderson, has run.
