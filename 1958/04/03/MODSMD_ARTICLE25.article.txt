# Papoose Tennis Squad Set to Host Burlingame High Today
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman tennis
team will play its second match
of the season this afternoon when
it meets the netters from Burlin
game High School at 2:45 on the
Stanford varsity courts.
Dick Ogden, the number one
frosh ace, will be in action for
the first time since his lose in
the Northern California Intercol
legiate finals to Jack Douglas.
Ogden missed the opening frosh
match last month due to class
commitments, but will be all set
to take over his number one spot
again.
Norman Karnes, who led the
frosh in Iheir season-opening 7-0
shutout of Stockton College, will
be playing number two for Stan
ford. Following Karnes, Stanford
will probably use Ev Moulton,
George Bates, Bob Baker, Phil
Odegard and John Hayek some
where in the lineup.
Don Norquist, who played in

the season's opener, will be out
of action for quite a while due to
a broken leg he suffered while
skiing.
This afternoon's match will be
played according to high school
style competition with five sin
gles and two doubles matches as
opposed to the collegiate style of
six singles and three doubles.
