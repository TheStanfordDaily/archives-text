# Russel Will Pitch Frosh '58 Opener
## 
### 
The veil romos off Coach Mick
ey Hol/man's 1958 freshman hasp
ball club today when the Card
yearlings tackle Carlemont High
School in their opening game.
Holzman has named his star
pitcher, 200-pound right-hander
Earl Russel, to open on the
mound.
The game is set for 3:115 on the
frosh diamond.
Holzman calls his squad "a
very representative freshman
club"and feels that his boys will
do well in the course of their lfi
game slate. They will meet 10
high school and six other college
freshman squads during this sea
son and will play twice a week
for the next eight weeks.
Good Hitters
The frosh coach looks for some
good hitting from his outfield
and first base positions. Right -
fielder John Hurlbut, one of the
team's co-captains, center-fielder
Jim Brandt and first-sacker Lee
Moench will lie the sluggers.
Hurlbut has one of the team's
better arms but catcher John
Simmons, also a co-captain, ranks
high in this department and his

coach expects few runners to get
away with extra bases wilh him
behind the plate.
Hal Shutzman will hold down
the third base spot with Mike Fe
lice at shortstop, Eric Blitz, at
second and Moench at first to
round out the infield. The short
stop-third base positions are cur
rently a toss-up, Hoi/man says,
with Dick Peterson pushing for
a spot.
Good Reserves
Speedy reserve in fielder Fred
Allen and defensive outfielder
Larry Shepp are also among the
best of the frosh squad and will
be looking to break into the start
ing lineup probably before the
season is over.
The frosh left field position has
Bill Jensen as a doubtful starter
because of a possible acadcmic
ineligibility. Should he not be
able to play Tim Alexander will
open in this spot. Southpaw
Terry Lindeman, brother of var
sity reserve outfielder Mike, is
the second ranked pitcher on the
squad with Dave Carter, a right
hander, close behind.
Holznian Impressed
Holzman, who has been assist
ed by Jack McKenna, and will be
helped by Bill Turner, says he is
"impressed by the club's attitude
and with the work they have put
into getting ready for lire sea
son."
Reported lineup for the first
game is: Shurtzman, 3b; Blitz,
2b; Jensen, If; Hurlbut, rf;
Moench. lb; Brandt, cf; Filice, ss;
Simmons, c; Russell, p.
