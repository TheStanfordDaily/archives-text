## 
### Margot Zeiss 
Five hundred voices and a 125-
piece San Francisco Symphony
combined under the baton of En
rique Jorda for a magnificent
Easter presentation of Berlioz'
dramatically beautiful "Requiem"
last night at the Opera House.
Strategically placed on stage
and at the rear of the auditorium,
four brass choirs augmented the
Symphony and choristers in pos
sibly the most impressive con
cert spectacle ever heard in the
Opera House.
The black and crimson robed
choir stood on risers at the back
of an extended stage, presenting
the audience with an inclined sea
of faces. The voices, particularly
of the men, were so smoothly
blended that it was extremely dif

ficult to distinguish between the
parts.
The soprano and tenor sections
dominated the altos and basses,
and with the brass choirs produc
ing an antiphonal effect the im
pression was one of stirring
echoes.
One of the best movements was
the fourth. "Dies Irae," which
featured the echoing. The fifth
movement was also outstanding,
consisting of an unaccompanied
five-part chorus with the four
lower parts singing against the
sopranos, who sang more slowly
-a moving and very beautiful ef
fect.
Jorda has previously estab
lished himself as a brilliant inter
preter of choral classics, and he
gave the "Requiem" the full
scope of its power.
