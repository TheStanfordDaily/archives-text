# Tribe Spikers Seek SC Upset
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Running power versus field event strength will be the story when
Stanford meets Southern California in their dual track and field meet
tomorrow at 2 p.m. on Occidental College's Patterson Field.
Favored, of course, will be the Trojans, who haven't lost a peace
time collegiate duel meet since 1933. It was in that year that the

Cards last topped Troy, 67-64.
Strangely enough, however, the
series is tied at 26 wins apiece.

mile and two-mile with good field
event performances. Tomorrow,
the reverse will have to be the
case.
Rough in Field
The Trojans are virtual cinches
to win five* of the six field events,
and will make it tough in the
sixth, the broad jump. Rink Bab
ka and Dave Davis give USC a
pair of sure firsts in the discus
and shot-put.
Babka unofficially broke the
world platter record with a throw
of 198-10 that sailed into a ditch
at Apple Valley two weeks ago.
Davis, holder of the national
frosh record ,has already moved
out to the 57-2% mark in the iron
ball event this spring.
Olympic champion Charley Du
mas, a surprise regainer of eligi
bility at the Figueroa school, is
about five inches better than any
other high jump entrant. And in
the pole vault, the Trojans have
a trio of inconsistent 14-footers,
one of whom should certainly be
hot enough to win.
No Standout
The javelin is probably the
event with the least-distinguished
group of entrants—at least on a
basis of their 1957 marks. But
even here, Mike Page of the
Norm Pease, the Indians' out
standing sophomore dash men,
are both in the best shape of their
careers. This, combined with the
Trojans' acknowledged weakness
in the 100 and 220, give the In
dians a couple of likely spots to
pick up points.
Cobb Must Win
Team captain Chuck Cobb will
renew his hurdle duel with USC's
Bob Lawson, and must come off
with two victories if Stanford is
to stand a chance in the meet.
Cobb has even been hurdling
in the gym during the last few
days of rain, and says he'll beat
Lawson.
Everything from the 440 up
could go any of several different
ways, and it is probably in these
four events, plus the relay, that
the meet will be decided.
Don Chesarek looms as a Stan
ford favorite in the quarter, but
if Tom Anderson goes for the
Trojans in the 440, an upset
would be possible.
Cunliffe Picked
Norman Lloyd is the man who
could spell the difference in the
880 and mile. Ernie Cunliffe of
the Indians is the likely choice in
the half, but the major question
will be whether or not Lloyd can
edge Anderson for second.
In the mile, Lloyd will be out

better than his Stanford compe
tition.
The Stanford position begins
to look a lot better in the sprints
and hurdles. Dean Smith and

McLeod.
Max Truex and Maury Graves
could wage the best distance bat
tle of the day. Graves has slight
ly the better time of the two, but
Truex has more experience in
top-flight competition. A Graves
upset, however, would put Stan
ford well along the victory trail.
Hansen Improves
In the lone field event Stanford
has a good chance to win. it will
be Kent Hansen against Lawson.
Hansen went over 24 feet for the
first time last weekend, and his
consistent improvement indicates
that he'll be out there again.

Rough in Field
The Trojans are virtual cinches
to win five* of the six field events,
and will make it tough in the
sixth, the broad jump. Rink Bab
ka and Dave Davis give USC a
pair of sure firsts in the discus
and shot-put.
Babka unofficially broke the
world platter record with a throw
of 198-10 that sailed into a ditch
at Apple Valley two weeks ago.
Davis, holder of the national
frosh record ,has already moved
out to the 57-2% mark in the iron
ball event this spring.
Olympic champion Charley Du
mas, a surprise regainer of eligi

about five inches better than any
other high jump entrant. And in
the pole vault, the Trojans have
a trio of inconsistent 14-footers,
one of whom should certainly be
hot enough to win.
No Standout
The javelin is probably the
event with the least-distinguished
group of entrants—at least on a
basis of their 1957 marks. But
even here, Mike Page of the
Norm Pease, the Indians' out
standing sophomore dash men,
are both in the best shape of their
careers. This, combined with the
Trojans' acknowledged weakness
in the 100 and 220, give the In
dians a couple of likely spots to
pick up points.
Cobb Must Win
Team captain Chuck Cobb will
renew his hurdle duel with USC's
Bob Lawson, and must come off
with two victories if Stanford is
to stand a chance in the meet.
Cobb has even been hurdling
in the gym during the last few
days of rain, and says he'll beat
Lawson.
Everything from the 440 up
could go any of several different
ways, and it is probably in these
four events, plus the relay, that
the meet will be decided.
Don Chesarek looms as a Stan

if Tom Anderson goes for the
Trojans in the 440, an upset

Norman Lloyd is the man who

Running power versus field event strength will be the story when
Stanford meets Southern California in their dual track and field meet
tomorrow at 2 p.m. on Occidental College's Patterson Field.
Favored, of course, will be the Trojans, who haven't lost a peace
time collegiate duel meet since 1933. It was in that year that the

Cards last topped Troy, 67-64.
Strangely enough, however, the
series is tied at 26 wins apiece.
Payton Jordan directed his
Stanford club to its best showing
in nine years last season when
(he Cards were edged by Troy,
72-39.
In that meet, the Cards made
up for poor showings in the 880.
mile and two-mile with good field
event performances. Tomorrow,
the reverse will have to be the
case.
Rough in Field
The Trojans are virtual cinches
to win five* of the six field events,
and will make it tough in the
sixth, the broad jump. Rink Bab
ka and Dave Davis give USC a
pair of sure firsts in the discus
and shot-put.
Babka unofficially broke the
world platter record with a throw
of 198-10 that sailed into a ditch
at Apple Valley two weeks ago.
Davis, holder of the national
frosh record ,has already moved
out to the 57-2% mark in the iron
ball event this spring.
Olympic champion Charley Du
mas, a surprise regainer of eligi
bility at the Figueroa school, is
about five inches better than any
other high jump entrant. And in
the pole vault, the Trojans have
a trio of inconsistent 14-footers,
one of whom should certainly be
hot enough to win.
No Standout
The javelin is probably the
event with the least-distinguished
group of entrants—at least on a
basis of their 1957 marks. But
even here, Mike Page of the
Norm Pease, the Indians' out
standing sophomore dash men,
are both in the best shape of their
careers. This, combined with the
Trojans' acknowledged weakness
in the 100 and 220, give the In
dians a couple of likely spots to
pick up points.
Cobb Must Win
Team captain Chuck Cobb will
renew his hurdle duel with USC's
Bob Lawson, and must come off
with two victories if Stanford is
to stand a chance in the meet.
Cobb has even been hurdling
in the gym during the last few
days of rain, and says he'll beat
Lawson.
Everything from the 440 up
could go any of several different
ways, and it is probably in these
four events, plus the relay, that
the meet will be decided.
Don Chesarek looms as a Stan
ford favorite in the quarter, but
if Tom Anderson goes for the
Trojans in the 440, an upset
would be possible.
Cunliffe Picked
Norman Lloyd is the man who
could spell the difference in the
880 and mile. Ernie Cunliffe of
the Indians is the likely choice in
the half, but the major question
will be whether or not Lloyd can
edge Anderson for second.
In the mile, Lloyd will be out

Southlanders is nearly 10 feet
better than his Stanford compe
tition.
The Stanford position begins
to look a lot better in the sprints
and hurdles. Dean Smith and
to upset fellow Canadian Wes
McLeod.
Max Truex and Maury Graves
could wage the best distance bat
tle of the day. Graves has slight
ly the better time of the two, but
Truex has more experience in
top-flight competition. A Graves
upset, however, would put Stan
ford well along the victory trail.
Hansen Improves
In the lone field event Stanford
has a good chance to win. it will
be Kent Hansen against Lawson.
Hansen went over 24 feet for the
first time last weekend, and his
consistent improvement indicates
that he'll be out there again.
