Running power versus field event strength will be the story when
Stanford meets Southern California in their dual track and field meet
tomorrow at 2 p.m. on Occidental College's Patterson Field.
Favored, of course, will be the Trojans, who haven't lost a peace
time collegiate duel meet since 1933. It was in that year that the
