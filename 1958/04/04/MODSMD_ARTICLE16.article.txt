# Ike Plans Major Change For Defense Department
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” A far
reaching overhaul of the U.S. de
fense setup, concentrating control
over military money and missions
in the Secretary of Defense, was
proposed to Congress yesterday
by President Eisenhower.
Signaling the start of what may
be a historic fight on Capitol Hill,
the President emphasized that
major reorganization is necessary
to end interserviee bickering and
promote fighting efficiency.
He outlined his aims in this
paragraph:
"Strategic and tactical planning
must be completely unified; com
bat forces organized into unified
commands, each equipped with
the most efficient weapons sys
tems that science can develop, and
singly led and prepared to fight
as one, regardless of service."
Full Authority
"We must remove all doubts as
to the full authority of the Secre
tary of Defense," the President
said.
For example, Eisenhower pro
posed that, while the annual ap
propriations would be made by
categories of functions, the actual
appropriations would be made to
the Defense Secretary to be allo
cated among the services. Con
gress traditionally has reserved
the right to say where and how
the money it provides is spent.
Eisenhower's recommendations
for basic revamping of strategy
making and the chain-of-command
system were predicated on the
premise that "separate ground,
sea and air warfare is gone for
ever." Therefore, he proposed
these points:
Unification Proposals
1. Establish unified command.
"We must organize our fighting
forces into operational commands
that are truly unified, each assign
ed a mission in full accord with
our 1 over-all military objectives."
The commands would be estab
lished on order of Ihe President;
they would be under the Defense
Department, "but separate from
the military departments."
Eisenhower specified, in making
this proposal, that "1 have neither
the intent nor the desire to merge
or abolish the traditional services;
this recommendation would have
no such effect."
2. The chain of command for
the unified commands would go
directly from the President and
the Defense Secretary. Today, the
President said, it runs from the
President to the Defense Secre
tary, to a service secretary, to the
military chief of a service and
finally to the unified command.
