American colleges and universities arc not the
only institutes of higher learning which face
financial problems, and which invariably attempt
to solve them by raises in mil ion. Enrollment
and study fees at the private colleges and uni
versities of Japan are supposed to be raised by
10 to 20 per cent before the end of this year.
Education is expensive any way you look at it,
it seems.

And in Ceneva University, Switzerland, the stu
dents staged a demonstration in front of the uni
versity restaurant and suggested a boycott be
cause of recent price increases. The student body
furthermore demands an investigation of the

accounts of the restaurant (which is now oper
ating at a loss, as most campus snack bars do,
even in the United States) with a view to pre
venting its liquidation, forcing the students to
resort to private restaurants.
In spite of grumblings about poor food, poor
service and high prices, whatever would students
of the world do without the campus hang-outs?

The Minnesota Daily's Ivory Tower magazine
tolls this story, as reported by their spy in the
faculty dining club:
Professor X took his tray with his day's fare
of chow mein, water and coffee and walked to
the sugar and cream table. He picked up the
cream and poured a long stream into his water.
An alert waitress snatched the glass and replaced
it. Amid guffaws of colleagues, he made his way
to a table, sat down with as much dignity as pos
sible and shook several drops of soya sauce into
his coffee.
The club's formal air was more shaken as con
fused Professor X grabbed his water glass and
dumped it onto his chow mein.
Prime example of compounding an error. A
good chuckle, though.

Ithaca College, New York, announces that it
opened a new television-radio studio March 1. The
studio, which is reported to be one of the most
modern educational television and radio studios
in the country, has been equipped with the latest
type of equipment. It will be used for closed
circuit laboratory sessions and demonstrations
for the 100 students in the Television-Radio De
partment of the college.
Congratulations, Ithaca.

furthermore demands an investigation of the

accounts of the restaurant (which is now oper
ating at a loss, as most campus snack bars do,
even in the United States) with a view to pre
venting its liquidation, forcing the students to
resort to private restaurants.
In spite of grumblings about poor food, poor
service and high prices, whatever would students
of the world do without the campus hang-outs?

The Minnesota Daily's Ivory Tower magazine
tolls this story, as reported by their spy in the
faculty dining club:
Professor X took his tray with his day's fare
of chow mein, water and coffee and walked to
the sugar and cream table. He picked up the
cream and poured a long stream into his water.
An alert waitress snatched the glass and replaced
it. Amid guffaws of colleagues, he made his way
to a table, sat down with as much dignity as pos
sible and shook several drops of soya sauce into
his coffee.
The club's formal air was more shaken as con
fused Professor X grabbed his water glass and
dumped it onto his chow mein.
Prime example of compounding an error. A
good chuckle, though.

Ithaca College, New York, announces that it
opened a new television-radio studio March 1. The
studio, which is reported to be one of the most
modern educational television and radio studios
in the country, has been equipped with the latest
type of equipment. It will be used for closed
circuit laboratory sessions and demonstrations
for the 100 students in the Television-Radio De
partment of the college.
Congratulations, Ithaca.
American colleges and universities arc not the
only institutes of higher learning which face
financial problems, and which invariably attempt
to solve them by raises in mil ion. Enrollment
and study fees at the private colleges and uni
versities of Japan are supposed to be raised by
10 to 20 per cent before the end of this year.
Education is expensive any way you look at it,
it seems.
