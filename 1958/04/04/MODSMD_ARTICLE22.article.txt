Anyone for a Cruise?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to know if any of your readers
would he interested in accompanying me and my
family on a rather long cruise scheduled to depart
in a few days. We are building our boat now and
are confident that there will be plenty of room
for all though we are reserving some room in
the lower decks for selected animals. We hope
this will provide additional variety on the voyage
and perhaps serve for food after wo reach our
destination.
II should he a very interesting trip. We haven't
planned our route quite yet, but will probably
drift around and stop at the first land we see.
My wile thinks we should take along some birds
to use a« scouts to hunt for islands; these plans
are as yet tentative, however.
Some readers may he a hit unenthusiastic over
the projected trip on account of the rain. I don't
think this will last more than 40 more days,
though, and after thai the weather should be fine
for sailing.
Sign-up lists for those interested are currently
posted in Memorial Church.
Noah Jones, off-cam pus
P.S.—I would like to spike one rumor right
here and now. Some scoffers have been claiming
that our boat will never be able to float because
it is too far from water. II is true that we are
building it on rather high ground, hut we did this
the last time, too, and the boat worked fine then.

Editor, The Daily:
As the date for graduation nears, I grow in

creasingly apprehensive of our graduation cere
monies duplicating the long, drawn-out and te
dious program of last year. I refer to the newly
initiated practice of calling out each student's
name (about 2000 of them) as he receives his
diploma, not the other aspects.
Having ushered at last year's graduation, T had
Ihe opportunity to hear the complaints of parents
who attended the ceremonies. Almost to a man
all the people I talked to after last year's "mis
take" expressed horror at ever having to go
through such a procedure again.
Parents, relatives and friends equally condemn
ed the practice as NOT giving Ihem the "satisfac
tion of hearing THEIR son's or daughter's, niece's
or nephew's, etc., name called out," which the
planners of the occasion hoped for. These same
people also sympathized with Ihe University offi
cials who had to spend valuable time calling out
students' names, etc.
Wouldn't it be much better to have a PROVEN
speaker, not necessarily a NAME speaker, give a
short, but to the point, address? It seems to me
(and to the parents, relatives and friends of last
year's graduates that I spoke to) that no speech,
however mediocre, could be worse than a repeti
tion of last year's "waste of time."
I would like an official of the Administration
to answer in this column whether the graduation
plans include the calling out of the names of the
graduates, and, if so, why (in face of the com
plaints made last year by so many who suffered
through the ceremonies, let alone those who left
during them)?
Hoping that this letter will cause an airing of
opinion about the plans for graduation exercises,
I am, very truly yours,
Jack L. Hymans
