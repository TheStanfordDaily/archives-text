er try at getting their show or
the road this quarter when they
meet Santa Clara on the still
sinking Sunken Diamond at 2:3(
tomorrow afternoon.
Coach Dutch Fehring will de
icde this morning whether or nol
the wet field can withstand nine
full innings, presuming, ol
course, that there will be no fur
ther showers. If he decides it

can't, the game will he re-sched

In their league openers in Los
Angeles last week they defeated
the Bruins from UCLA in two
straight with errorless ball-play
ing and a two-hit, 3-0 perform

ties Ihem for first place with the
USC Trojans at this early stage
of the season.
Santa Clara's Broncos, on the
other hand, lost their first two to
SC and share the .cellar with the
Bruins. They expect to have a
much better ball club this year
than in 1957. In competition last
year the Cards and Broncs split,
Stanford winning the first, 5-3,
Santa Clara the next two, 4-3 and
2-0, and the Indians finishing the
series with a 4-0 shutout.
At the present time Burk and
Holding are tied for team batting
honors with .355 averages in 31
at - bats. Hard - hitting Robinson
follows with a .325 average for
43 at-bats in which he has con
nected for two out - of - the - park
homers, a triple and four two
sackers.
Leopold's 1.75 earned-run av
erage holds the lead in the pitch
ing department. He has picked
up 33 strike-outs while giving up
only 16 bases -on - balls.
