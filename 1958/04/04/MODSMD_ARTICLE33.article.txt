# Frosh Take On Sacred Heart
## 
### 
The Stanford frosli baseball
team will again try to open the
1958 season against a highly re
garded Sacred Heart High School
ball team tomorrow on the frosh
diamond.
Although there is a good
chance of another rain-out, Coach
Mickey Hol/man will probably
go again with Earl Russel, his ace
right-hander, on the mound.
