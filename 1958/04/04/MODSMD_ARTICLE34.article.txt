# "A company that plans far ahead gives me the chance to work out my future"
## 
### 
"Pleasing design is no accident," says 32-year-old TV
set designer Richard Montmeat. "It takes creative
planning. At General Electric, we're constantly de-
veloping new product designs — including some for
products which won't be on the market for several
years. Ever since joining General Electric, I've had
the opportunity and challenge of working toward the
designs of the future. As I see it, a company which
plans ahead gives me the chance to work out my own
future, too."

The creative accomplishments of Richard Mont-
meat have already brought him widespread recog
nition. He was awarded design patents in 19;>0 and
1955; he won the Industrial Designers Institute
Award in 1955; and his design for the 1958 General
Electric 17-inch portable television receiver was se-

lected for showing in an international design exposi
lion in Milan, Italy.
Progress in pleasing design — making appliances
more enjoyable to own and use —is an important
factor in our nation's growing use of electricity and
in our constantly rising level of living. Planning now
to satisfy future customers is important not only to
the continued growth of the electrical industry, but to
individual progress as well. Opportunity for long
range planning is part of the climate for self-develop
ment which is provided for General Electric's more
than 29,000 college-graduate employees.
