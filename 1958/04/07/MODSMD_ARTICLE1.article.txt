# Hard Rain Increases Flood Peril
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P) — Hard
rainfall in Easter's early hours
added to Northern California's
flood peril yesterday from a week
long storm in which eight dead
were counted.
The latest storm was moving
into Southern California. Rains
of up to an inch were recorded in
Northern California Saturday
night.
The 58 reservoirs in the San
Francisco area were filled and
running over.
High Tides
Tides ran high along the coast.
Winds exceeding 50 miles an
hour hit Point Reyes.
The main storm front yester
day was near Bakersfield and
Santa Barbara. It was moving
southeast.
A low pressure center 250 miles
west of San Francisco was mov
ing south at 25 miles an hour hut
it was expected to turn directly
east and cross the middle of the
state last night.
Flood Prevention Work
The District Army Engineer's
Office in San Francisco reported
after noon that flood prevention
work in five areas around San
Francisco had been completed.
They cautioned this work was
only temporary and would not
necessarily stave off additional
flood waters if the intermittent
rain added more runoff.
They listed the five areas as
the San Lorenzo Creek levee re
pairs; Colma Creek dredging; Pa
raro Creek levee repairs in Santa
Cruz County; channel repairs on
San Francisquito Creek in Palo
Alto and clearing of the Guada
lupe River channel at Alviso in
so far as possible. The Alviso
project, the engineer's office said,
is complicated by recurring high
tides.
