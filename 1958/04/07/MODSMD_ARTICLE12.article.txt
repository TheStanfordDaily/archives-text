## Typewriters, Watches, Cash Taken While Members Sleep 
### Doug Willis 
Two Stanford fraternities, the Delta Chi and Alpha Tau Omega
houses, were burglarized early yesterday morning of about $1500
in cash and valuables.
The burglaries occurred between 1 and 7 a.m. and typewriters,
watches and cash were taken from the two houses.

One possible suspect was cited
by the ATO's. According to ATO
Larry Booth, an unidentified per
son entered the ATO house at
about 3 yesterday morning and
upon seeing someone asked the
time and left. Some suspicious
ATO's followed him to see what
he was doing, and took down the
license number of his car parked
in front of their house. They
later turned the number over to
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office to investigate.
Delia Chi Losses
In the Delta Chi house losses
included five typewriters valued
at $855, two watches worth $250
and about $50 in cash. Two type
writers worth $170, four watches
valued at $165 and $32 in cash
were stolen from the ATO's.
Yesterday's burglary marked
the third time since September
that the Delta Chi's and the
ATO's have been burglarized.
Two burglaries in October
amounted to comparatively small
losses to members of the houses.
According to Alden Danner,
Delta Chi president, the house
was entered in the early hours of
the morning, between about 4 and
6 a.m., and several watches and
typewriters were stolen. No one
saw or heard the burglars, and
they took items only from unoc
cupied rooms.
Two Burglars?
Members of the Delta Chi fra
ternity surmised that there were
two burglars. In some rooms,
they reported, valuable items left
in plain sight were not disturbed,
while in other rooms the burglars
acted very differently.
"They were very thorough in
some rooms," said a Delta Chi,
"and they even found watches
and wallets in their hiding
places."
The burglars entered the ATO
house between 6 and 7 a.m. and

they appeared to have made only
one quick trip through the house.
Only three rooms were entered,
all on the second floor, and many
valuables were not touched.
One ATO reported that, nothing
was missing when he got up at
6 a.m., but at 7:15 when he re
turned his typewriter was miss
ing. He didn't realize that he had
been burglarized until later in
the day when some Delta Chi's
checked to see if the ATO's had
been burglarized too.
The Delta Chi's reported that
the burglars also attempted to
steal the houses' television set.
The TV set was found moved
across the room toward*the door
and left on a chair. Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office checked
the set for possible fingerprints.

Two Burglars?

"They were very thorough in
some rooms," said a Delta Chi,
"and they even found watches
and wallets in their hiding
places."
The burglars entered the ATO
house between 6 and 7 a.m. and

they appeared to have made only
one quick trip through the house.
Only three rooms were entered,
all on the second floor, and many
valuables were not touched.
One ATO reported that, nothing
was missing when he got up at
6 a.m., but at 7:15 when he re

ing. He didn't realize that he had
been burglarized until later in
the day when some Delta Chi's
checked to see if the ATO's had
been burglarized too.
The Delta Chi's reported that
the burglars also attempted to
steal the houses' television set.
The TV set was found moved
across the room toward*the door
and left on a chair. Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office checked
the set for possible fingerprints.

One possible suspect was cited
by the ATO's. According to ATO
Larry Booth, an unidentified per

about 3 yesterday morning and
upon seeing someone asked the
time and left. Some suspicious
ATO's followed him to see what
he was doing, and took down the
license number of his car parked
