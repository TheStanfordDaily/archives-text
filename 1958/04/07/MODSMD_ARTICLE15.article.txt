# Chinese Artifacts Display Extended
## 
### 
"Arts of the Chou Dynasty," an
exhibit of Chinese artifacts from
the twelfth to the third century
8.C., will remain at the Stanford
Museum through April 15.
The $700,000 display was sched
uled to close March 28, but be
cause of the unusual amount of
interest, permission of the own
ers to extend it was secured.
The artifacts consist of bronze,
jade, pottery, carved wood and
lacquer from all periods of the
Chou Dynasty's 900-year span.
