# Ideological Warfare

Tftp. frff. world wfls not unexpectedly fillr
prised f>y I fie announcements I li:it have recent
ly issued from I he Soviet Union regarding uni
lateral stoppage of nuelear tests.
Fully expecting such a turn <d' events, tlie
free world and its leader, the United States,
prepared to counteract this obvious and spec
tacular propaganda thrust hv doing nothing.
Whether tlie West could have done anything
at all is a moot question. Hut within the realm
of positive action it seems not entirely illogical
tliat something eon Id have been done.
i
In the first place, we knew this was coming.
Any third-rate Madison Avenue grey-flannel
suiter could probably have conic up with some
kind of counternieasure, having so much time
in advance to prepare. It seems rather obvious
that Washington cannot even compete with
Madison Avenue.
In the second place, Washington knows, as
does the rest of the nation and the rest of the
world also, that the present conflict between
the Communist and free worlds is not being
fought 011 a material plane but, rather, on an
ideological plane. But the United States has
consistently refused to fight 011 this plane.
Instead, we stress armaments; we stress de
fense. We stress construction of a "clean"
bomb. Hut what we do in the way of propa
ganda thrusts and counterthrusts remains to he
discovered. It is as if the United States were
still using bows and arrows when most other
countries were using guns.
It is quite apparent —and quite tragic—that
the federal government is not equipped to use
propaganda as an effective weapon. The Cabi
net officers are so wrapped up in the running
of their individual departments that they are
unable to devote any time to propaganda poli
cies and techniques, even if they were experts
- which they are not.
Even John Foster Dulles, who has more to
do with propaganda than any other Cabinet
official, has no way of coordinating his propa
ganda policies with those of the Defense De
partinent or the Department of Labor.
It is also true that democratic peoples frown
upon the use of official propaganda. Business
and industry can use all the propaganda tech
niques they want to, hut not government. The
opponents of official propaganda point to Dr.
Coebbcls of Hitler's Nazi regime. They try to
logically iniplv that since propaganda is a

device used by totalitarian slates, it cannot be
used by democratic ones. Some even go so far
as to imply that the very use of propaganda
techniques by democratic governments would
soon cause those governments to turn totali
tarian.
This reasoning seems to us a little far
fetched. hut the whole subject appears to he
a good one for some aspiring political scien
tist's thesis.
The question nevertheless remains: Should
the United States and the free world go all-out
in a propaganda offensive rather than assuming
the defensive all the time?
So far as the particular recent Communist
propaganda coup is concerned, the United
States could very well squelch and deflate
Sovit Russia's balloon by saying: "Fine. We
will do the same."
If the United States does not do this, then,
in the eyes of the world, America is the war
monger—even ilionpli in actuality the I nited
States is not. A striking example of a similar
case is when Creat Britain scored a propaganda
coup when Germany began using submarines
in World War 11. Ignoring propaganda tech
niques ami their effect, Germany took the cal
culated risk of continuing the use of subma
rines.
Uncommitted United States, which had here
tofore favored and sympathized more with
Germany than with Great liritain, turned
against Germany and entered the war on the
side of the Allies.
If the United States took this course now,
there would still be danger. The Soviet Union,
using propaganda techniques, could still re
sume nuclear tests without incurring the onus
of the uncommitted peoples. Here the United
Stales would clearly have to wage offensive
propaganda war. The American Government
has lo he on its toes and make propaganda
thrusts before the Soviet Union can.
We are fighting an ideological war, not a
material war. We must have ideological weap
ons. both offensive and defensive, not just de
fensive material weapons. The question the
United States must face is ibis: •
Is the production of a "clean" nuclear de
fense weapon so important that il must be
developed at all costs, even if it means suffer
ing major ideological defeats?
We do not really know the answer to this,
bill il is about time we found out.
