The part of the 1957 Ford
Foundation grant alone already
paid to Stanford would purchase
nearly 282 Thunderbirds or 264.5
Edsels l'rom the company whose
founders established the Fund.
Including the grants awarded
for economic development and
administration, research in men
tal health, international affairs
and public affairs, the Univer
sity's total 1957 grant was $2,224,-
500 out of a total of $210,000,000
Ford Foundation grants for last
year.
Over a Billion
Altogether, over a billion dol
lars has been given by the Foun
dation to some 6000 non-profit in
stitutions and organizations in all
48 states, three territories and 54
foreign countries.
The Ford Foundation is cur
rently engaged in 20 grant-mak
ing programs, of which Stanford
is a participant in nearly all.
One of its newest ventures is
in giving support to the humani
ties and arts in the University
Presses Program. Approximately
$1.7 million has been given to 30
college and university presses for
the publication of scholarly books
in the humanities and social sci
ences. Stanford is one of these
schools, with a 1957 grant of $14,-
100.
Hospital Improvement
Under the Foundation's pro
gram for hospital improvement,
the total grant to the Stanford
Hospitals in San Francisco has
been $175,300 from 1936 through
Sept. 30, 1957.
The Faculty Salary Grants pro
gram has awarded $2,224,500 plus
an accomplishment grant of $1,-
380,000 to Stanford during the
same period of time.
Under this program, all the
country's 630 four-year regional
ly accredited private colleges

have received endowments ap
proximately equal to their 1954
instructional payroll for liberal
arts and sciencess. The accom
plishment grants were awarded
for outstanding efforts to im
prove faculty salaries.
Important Part
Stanford also plays a very im
portant part in the Foundation's
program for the study of human
behavior, with the general pur
pose of advancing research and
education in the sciences relating
to human behavior â€” sociology,
psychology a n d anthropology.
Total Ford Foundation grants in
this field have been over $15 mil
lion for training and research at
55 colleges, universities and other
institutions.
Over one-third of this total, $5,-
350,000, has gone into the Center
for Advanced Study in the Beha
vioral Sciences, Inc., located at
Stanford. The purpose of this
Center is to provide opportunities
for senior scholars and a number
of younger men to do concen
trated work on their individual
specialties, while at the same
time associating with one another
on common problems and inter
ests.
Foundation History
The history of the Ford Foun
dation goes back to Michigan in
1936 to its incorporation, with
Henry Ford, Edsel B. Ford and
their estates as donors. This pri
vate, non-profit corporation set as
its purpose the serving of public
welfare in seeking to strengthen
American society by identifying
problems of national importance
and underwriting efforts toward
their solution, principally
through educational means.
Its main business is to make
grants of funds to other non
profit organizations, not engag
ing in direct operations itself.
The reason that certain univer
sities and organizations are cho

sen to receive these grants was i
explained in an interview with
Robert Molton, Assisstant to
President Sterling, who said that,
"typically, the foundation has
supported institutions in any
given grant if they |the Founda
tion! felt it was particularly well
qualified to do whatever the
grant for."
He continued by explaining
that they "try to support things
that have a 'demonstration val
ue'," or, in other words, that have
a "general applicability and need
only to be demonstrated some
where and then be applied." The
Foundation chooses regions that
have competence for this demon
stration in hope that the principle
might be used elsewhere.
The money grants are made
"unique," Molton continued, by |
"the general policy of supporting!
voluntarily things that would |

have difficulty in getting support
from other convenient sources."
