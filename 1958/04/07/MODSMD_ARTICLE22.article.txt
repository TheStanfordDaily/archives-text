# Cobb, Lloyd Set New Tribe Records: 13.9, 4:06
## Cards Win Eight Events, But Lose to Troy, 80-31 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Chuck Cobb and Norman Lloyd set new Stanford school records
in the high hurdles and mile Saturday as the Indians beat USC, 42-35,
in track competition.
The only catch was that the Trojans rolled up 45 points to just 9
for the Indians in the field events and so beat the Cards for the 23rd

straight time, 80-51.
It was a great day for Stan
ford on Occidental's Patterson
Field track as it won both sprints,
both hurdles, the 140, 880 and
mile. But in the field, only one
first place came Stanford's way,
and Troy swept three events.
Captain Cobb made good on his
pre - race prediction of victory

over Bob Lawson. And in the
highs, he did it in spectacular
fashion. Cobb flashed over the
10 hurdles in 13.9, Ihe fastest
time in the nation this year.
His effort broke the 23-year-old
record of 14.1 that had been set
by Sam Klopstock. He also bet
tered the meet record of 14.0, set
by Olympic runner-up Jack Davis
of USC in 1953.
Lloyd ran by far the greatest
mile ever done by a Stanford
man. He hung right behind Troy's
Wes McLeod for three laps, thep
shot past the surprised Trojan
and astounded the crowd by fin
ishing in 4:06.0.
Quick Last Lap
Lloyd ran his final lap in 60
seconds flat as he bested the
previous Stanford record of
4:11.5. It was set: by Paul Moore
in 1940. His was also a new meet
record, breaking the 4:09.2 that
Sid Wing ran for USC last year.
Lloyd's effort was the second
fastest outdoor mile in the United
States this year, topped only by
the 4:04.5 Alex Henderson of
Arizona State turned in against
San Jose 10 days ago.
Ernie Cunliffe bagged a third
meet record for the Indians and
missed a school mark by just one
tenth of a second as he blazed the
half-mile in 1:51.0. Cunliffe had
to run that fast to win, as SC's
Wayne Lemons was right behind
in 1:51.3.
Near's Eastman's Mark
Cunliffe's mark broke another
of Wing's year-old records, the
former standard being 1:51.2.
The Stanford record of 1:50.9
was set by the great Ben East
man in 1932.
Stanford, besides having the
three record - breakers, had the
meet's only double winners. Cobb
came back after his great high
hurdles victory to win the lows
by six yards in 23.5.
Sophomore Dean Smith over
powered Dave Hollingsworth of
the Trojans to win both sprints.
He sped the 100 in 9.8 and re
turned with a 21.9 220.
Stanford's 440 victory was con
tributed by Don Chesarek. He
finished strong in 48.4, topping
the Trojans' Ted Smith by a hall
step.
Only First
Sophomore John Kelly was the
only field event winner for the
Tribe as he leaped an even 21
feel to win the broad jump.
Maury Graves narrowly missed
giving Stanford a sweep in the in
dividual track events as he lost to
Max Truex in Ihe two-mile. Tru*
ex' 9:04.0 put him 2.1 seconds
ahead of Graves and broke his
own meet standard for the event
by two seconds.
Norm Pease was the only In
dian besides Graves to either
place or show in a running event
as he was second in the 220 and
third in the 100. The Cards' relay
team of Bob Bes.se, Dick Lassen,
Lloyd and Chesarek lost by three
tenths to the Trojans' 3:14.9.
