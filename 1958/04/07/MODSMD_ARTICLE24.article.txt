# Penalty Kicks Ruin Ruggers
## 
### 
Neither team could score a try
on the muddy Stanford rugby
field Saturday, and so penalty
kicks proved the deciding factor
as the Olympic Club beat Stan
ford, 12-6.
Ironically enough, it was an ex-
Stanfordian, A 1 Kirkland, who
hooted all four charity kicks for
the Winged-O victory. Kyrk Reid
put through a pair of kicks in the
first half that sent the Indians
off the field at intermission with
a (i (> tie.
