# SC Crew Wins
## 
### 
Stanford's still . experimenting
varsity crew took it on the chin
from Southern California for the
first time in the 10-year history
of the two clubs' rowing series
Saturday as Troy held on for a
half-length victory in Redwood
City Yacht Harbor.
Starting fast and then clinging
to an ever-narrowing victory over
Stanford, the Trojans negotiated
the 2000 meters in 6:28. Stanford
finished two seconds behind, and
Oregon Slate was third in 6:37.
The crews were slowed by a 15-
mph head wind.
Fortunately, rain squalls held
off until the very end of the race.
Stanford came out on top in the
other two races of the day as the
freshman and junior varsity
crews each won. The frosh pulled
away throughout the race to
whip the Trohabes by three
lengths in 6:47. Oregon State did

not enter a boat in the yearling
race.
The JV's came into the final
500 meters with nearly a length
lead over Oregon State, then had
to hold on to beat the Beavers by
a scant quarter-length. The JV's
were clocked in 6:39.6. USC was
third, 2 1 - lengths behind the win
ners.
Varsity coach Lou Lindsey had
the unusual experience of not see
ing most of his club's race. The
launch Lindsey was in broke
down at Ihe start of the race, and
by the time he switched boats and
caught up, the race was three
quarters over.
Stanford will have a chance to
gain revenge over the Trojans
when it meets them and UCLA in
Harbach Cup competition later in
ihe season in Los Angeles. The
crews will return to action April
26 when they travel to the North
west.
