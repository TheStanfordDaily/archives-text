## 
### 
For students interested in de
veloping projects in broadcasting
or making experimental films,
Speech and Drama 112 has a few
openings left for spring quarter.
Work done by this class may
be the basis for a future radio or
television series broadcast from
here. On Mondays and Wednes
days at 1:15 p.m., the radio and
television section of the course
will meet. The film section will
meet Tuesdays and Thursdays at
11 a.m.
Purpose of the course is to dis
cover new content, forms and
techniques in radio, television

and film. Creative and experi
mental work will be stressed.
Dr. Stanley Donncr, head of the
Radio and Television Department,
said, "College students can turn
up new processes and procedures
if they have the opportunity. In
the field of radio in particular,
college students have a real op
portunity for revitalizing its pro
gramming after they have en
tered the industry."
