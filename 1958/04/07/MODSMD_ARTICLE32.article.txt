# Foreign Student Pre-Reg Com To Hold Tryouts This Week
## 
### 
Tryouts will be held this week
to choose members of the For
eign Student Pre - Registration
Committee for autumn quarter.
This committee returns to

school five days before the begin
ning of the quarter and meets the
new foreign students entering
Stanford. Arrangements are
made during the spring and sum
mer for accommodations and ac
tivities for the students.
During pre - registration, the
foreign students live with fami
lies in the surrounding area and
are provided with transportation
by committee members. Coffee
hours, speeches, picnics and other
activities are also planned by the
committee.
This program is very impor
tant, according to Judy Thomas,
co-chairman of the committee, for
it is the first introduction the for
eign students have to life at
Stanford. Pre-registration is their
initial opportunity to meet Stan
ford students and to make friends
here, she stressed.
It is also beneficial to the com
mittee members, she said, for
they have a chance which they
otherwise might not have to get
acquainted with many foreign
students and to learn their ideas.
Interviews will be conducted
this week and next week on Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday
evenings, 7:30-10, at the Interna
tional Center. Appointment sign
up sheets are posted by the AS
SU office.
