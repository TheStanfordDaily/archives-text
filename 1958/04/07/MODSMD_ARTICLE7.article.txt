# ELECTIONS
## Ballot Box Will Go to Residences 
### 
Traveling ballot boxes arc the
new feature of this year's ASSU
elections, according to the new
Elections Commission.
Teams composed of two girls
with ballots and ballot box will
visit each fraternity, eating club
and Stern either before or after
lunch one day during each elec
tion primary and final.
The idea of bringing the moun
tain to Mohammed was instituted
at the request of Men's Row.
Women's housing groups were
not included in the arrangement
because they have not requested
such a scheme, and because of
the impossibility of hitting every
housing group.
Ballot boxes will be located at
Engineering Corner both days
of each election, as has been done
in past years.
Another innovation, in the form
of simplified, re-designed ballots,
will make voting speedier and
more efficient. Only six ballots
will need to be marked in this
year's elections. This is a great
improvement over last year when
a different ballot was required
for every office.
Composing the new Elections
Commission are Mim Wallace,
Mary Ann Kovacevich, Pat
Hearne, Z. Wayne Griffin, Mar
got Zeiss, John Kensey, Laurie
Mack, Sheila Mac Donald, Judy
Pascoe, Sash Lanz and Bill Rich
ards, chairman.
In accordance with tradition,
ballots will be counted publicly
after both primary and final elec
tions. However, rather than
counting ballots in Engineering
Corner as has occurred in the
past, the Election Com will tally
votes in the Nitery.
