"Sponsoring is in my opinion
the most rewarding experience a
student can have at Stanford,"
stated Wilbur Head Sponsor
Dwight Clark as he explained the
functions of sponsoring.
"Its overriding goal is to aid in
acquainting the new students
with all of the opportunities
academic, cultural and social of
a great university community,
and to help, when possible, in
their personal growth in this new
environment."
In addition to the intangible
gains of sponsoring, Wilbur spon
sors receive free room while they
are staying at Wilbur. .Sponsor
ing is an ASSU activity and spon
sors are approved by the Legis
lature, remarked Clark.
"A sponsor is let! a great deal
of autonomy in working with his
own men," Clark said. "At Wil
bur, there is a minimum of hall
wide sponsor activity, the empha
sis being on the house 'team' of
faculty resident and the three
sponsors, and also oil the indi*

vitlual sponsor and his floor."
Anyone with a "C" average can
apply for an interview, Clark con
tinued. Applications arc being ac
cepted this week and are due this
Friday.
The interview is the first step
in the selection of the sponsors.
During the interview the selec
tion committee, composed of five
of the present sponsors, looks for
men with a good grasp of the
goals and opportunities of the
University community, men who
arc approachable and can work
on close terms with a wide vari
ety of students, and men who will
be available, as sponsoring takes
much time.
When the top group is chosen
from those interviewed, the pres
ent sponsors arc asked to make
personal comments on the pros
pective sponsors. Again, the com
ments are mainly on the candi
dates' grasp of the ideals of the
University and on their approach
ability.
The 25 sponsors for next year
are notified by mail about the

first week of May and arc re
quested to attend an orientation
weekend with the rest of the com
ing year's sponsors at Camp
Campbell. There the sponsors
are acquainted with their new re
sponsibilities and opportunities.
The new sponsors return to
campus a few days before the
new freshmen eomc to attend "a
sort of pre-Pre-Registration," ex
plained Clark. They are told more
of their responsibilities and are
told many of the statistics about
their men.
When the freshmen arrive, the
sponsors work with the Pre-Reg
istration Committee to help ori
ent the new students. After Pre-
Reg, the sponsors' main duties
are to offer any available help
they can, without a paternalistic
attitude, said Clark.
"Sponsoring is a colorful and
thrilling nine months." stated
Clark. "A sponsor is challenged
with a tremendous range of prob
lems and opportunities to aid peo
ple at an important period in
their life.''
