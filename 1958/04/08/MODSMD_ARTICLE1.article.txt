# Suicide Common at University Level – Why?

(Editor's Note: The follow
ing is tlie first of a three-part
series on the incidence of sui
cide at Stanford, the reasons,
the consequences and the help
provided disturbed students.)

There have been eight attempt
ed suicides at Stanford since the
beginning of last autumn quarter.
There were four men and four
women; none was successful.
This is not an unusually large
number; neither is it a phenome
non peculiar to Stanford. Suicide
is the second greatest cause of
death here and among college stu
dents throughout the country.
There are many misconceptions
about the motivations for suicide

and particularly for suicides
among college students.
"The old cliches of overwork
and p o or grades have become
greatly distorted as reasons for
suicides," said Dr. Don Jackson,
head of the psychiatric division of
Palo Alto Clinic. "The main
causes arc loneliness and lack of
communication with one's associ
ates."
"I agree," says Dr. Jerome D.
Oremland, who came to Palo Alto
Clinic at the end of last quarter
md will devote much of his time
to Stanford students. "The rea
sons for suicide are long-term af
fairs, for the most part. If this
grade failure or whatever meshes
with an inner feeling has been in
a person for a long time, then it

may lead him to suicide."
There seem to be three feelings
which continually appear in sui
cidal cases which are aggravated
by university environment.
• Spite—A person tries to pun
ish others whom he thinks have
not been showing him the proper
love and attention. This is a feel
ing frequently seen in children:
"I'll hurt myself; then they'll -see
how much 1 meant to them. If
they have to get along without
me, then they will see how im
portant I was, and they will be
sorry they treated me so badly."
This is a use of personal dynam
ics to satisfy inner needs.
The atmosphere of a large uni
versity, with its seeming imper
sonality, may make these feelings

manifest to lonely people.
• Futility—People who attempt
suicide often see a meaningless
iress in the whole struggle for'
achievement. Why put the effort
into it? This applies particularly
to a university, where, aside from
grades, the benefits of education
are well into the future after one
has left school. The relationship
between effort and reward is hazy
and gives many people this feel
ing of futility.
• Guilt—The accepting of the
difficulties of other people often
leads one to guilt feelings: "If
my parents didn't have to spend
so much money to send me here,
they could afford the new house,
car-, or whatever." "My girl friend
|or boy friend] would be so much

happier if I didn't give her [or
him 1 so many problems." "The
world would be so much better
off without me."
The subject accuses himself of
causing difficulties for his asso
ciates and sometimes punishes
himself with suicide.
"However," said Dr. Oremland,
"there are certain sudden realiza
tions and fears which apply par
ticularly to students and some
times lead to impulsive suicides.
These are primarily a sudden
awareness of homosexuality or
that he has been living the life of
a cliche and all his relationships
are very superficial.
"There are also the so-called
'little suicides' — wild driving,
choosing a dangerous occupation,

or purposely committing academ
ic, social, or economic suicide by
manifestly irresponsible actions."
Dr. Jackson mentioned the
Cordry murder as an example of
how loneliness affects students
and drives them to violent acts.
In Cordry's case the outlet was
murder, not suicide, but the moti
vations were primarily the same.
"He was tremendously isolat
ed," said Jackson, "and felt he
was not being understood. Cordry
was an exceedingly lonely person,
and yet people thought of him as
nice. That word 'nice' kept com
ing up in all the-testimony. What
is meant was that people didn't
mix with him.
"What better way to bring at
tention to himself? They all re

marked how 'nice' he was, but
people did not relate to him. This
often happens with students, and
in some the device to get atten
tion is suicide.
"These feelings of loneliness
occur when people are successful
as well as when they are failing.
Advanced students who are doing
well and heading for a career
often don't want to grow up and
make decisions."
Oremland pointed out that the
severity of a situation, be it suc
cess or failure, may not correlate
with the severity of the reaction.
What may lead one person to sui
cide may not affect another at all.
