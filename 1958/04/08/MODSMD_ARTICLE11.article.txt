The Daily asked the three can
didates who have filer! for ASSU
president for preliminary state
ments.
Holm's Statement
Bohn outlined a platform which
features closer contact between
the student body and the ASSU
officers.
Said Bohn: "In the realization
that student government at Stan
ford must speak for an informed
and interested student body lies
the key to effective student gov
ernment. Through wider and
wider participation and the ac
tive achievement of these propos
als, student government will ac
quire more and more prestige -
prestige which will give it an ef
fective voice in promoting student
interests."
Bill Post
Post made this statement for
The Dally:
"One of the main functions of
an ASSU president is to represent
student opinion to the University.
My main issue for this campaign
will concern the fraternity com
plexes. Complete discussion of
this issue is impossible here, but.
I believe the University has forc
ed this issue upon the fraternities
by making them make their
choice as a group rather than in
dividuals, and giving them no al
ternative."
Kranz could not be reached last
night for a preliminary state
ment.
Candidates' Meeting 1
All petitions for office must be
filed before the candidates' meet
ing at 4 p.m. Friday. Attendance
at the candidates' meeting is man

Elections Commission urges all
students signing nomination peti
