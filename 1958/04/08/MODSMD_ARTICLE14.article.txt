# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## The 						Escape from Reality 
### Walter Lippmann 
It was an ordeal for Secretary Dulles to have
to face a big press conference a few hours after
tho morning papers had carried the story of the
►Soviet suspension of nuclear testing. He chose to
treat the Soviet move as a tricky and meaning
less propaganda stunt which they with their
closed society can exploit, whereas we in our
open and free society are unable to match it. This
theory may comfort him, but it is. I venture to
believe, a dangerous form of escapism from the
hard realities of the world situation.
For if rests on the notion that our many re
verses and tlie decline of our influence are due
not to defects in our policies but to the superior
advantages of the Soviet Union in propaganda.
That is to say, when our products do not sell, the
trouble lies not with the engineering in the qual
ity of the product but in the packaging and the
advertising. The whole world would agree with
John Foster Dulles if it were not that the world
is so gullible that it is being taken in by the
Russians. This is flattering to our pride, but it
is not true.
Consider, for example, the subject of nuclear
testing which Mr. Dulles was discussing. He
pointed out, quite truly, that the Soviet Union
has just completed a series of tests whereas we
are preparing to make a series of tests this
spring and summer. The Soviet trick is, he says.
1 o suspend the tests which they do not now need
for some time to come, hoping to prevent us from
making our tests which we very much need to
make.
But is this such a difficult triek to deal with?
The natural way to deal with it would be to say
that when we, like the Soviet Union, have com
pleted our tests, we too will suspend further
testing provided the Soviet Union does not re
sume testing. The world is not so gullible that
it would not understand the common sense of
this retort.
* * *
This retort is not, however, open to us because
the controlling fact is that our military position
in tho world is built upon the deterrent power of
nuclear weapons. It happens that Mr. Dulles
spoke of our desire "to eliminate nuclear weapons
effectively from tho international arsenals." Rut
why he said this, why he made so Utopian a
remark. I cannot imagine. For the elimination
of nuclear weapons would make quite impossible
the strategic containment through a network of
alliances to which he is committed.

This is the real reason why American propa
ganda works badly. If we cannot or will not
revise our policies, Mr. Dulles would do better to
be candid and to tell the world frankly that we
cannot suspend tests because we cannot abolish
nuclear weapons without a revolutionary change
in our foreign policy. He could then argue that
the Russians, with their massive conventional
forces and their interior lines, cannot be con
tained without nuclear weapons. This would not
make him beloved in the world. But it would
make him believed.
* *
All this applies to much more than the par
ticular issue of nuclear testing. American propa
ganda is in trouble not because the Russians are
able to lie with impunity but because in so many
critical areas American propaganda is trying to
sell policies which for one reason or another are
obsolete, are fictions, are profoundly unpopular.
There is the central fiction in the Far East
that Formosa is China, and that the actual gov
ernment of China on the mainland ought to dis
appear. No propaganda can make a policy based
on that fiction credible, much less convincing
and inspiring. In southern Asia there is the fic
tion —which defies strategic geography—that we
are arming Pakistan to defend the Middle Fast
against the Red army. This is a fiction which
has earned us the deep suspicion of India. In the
Middle East there is the fiction that the Arab
states will remain with the West if only we can
prevent the Soviet forces from invading them.
And in Europe there is the fiction that Ade
nauer's Germany will absorb East Germany, and
that in some unknown way the Red army will
roll itself back out of eastern Europe. The fact
of the matter is that the mass of the people do
not like these fictions, and the informed leaders
of opinion know they are fictions and do not
believe in them. That is why our propaganda
works badly.

A wise and experienced man said to me in
Paris that the Western world was in a political
decline, not so much because the Soviet Union
was so strong and so shrewd, but because the
Western democracies made so many mistakes
and lacked the political courage to rectify them.
Listening to Mr. Dulles at Tuesday's press con
ference, I wondered whether he was not trying
to escape from that bitter truth.

It was an ordeal for Secretary Dulles to have
to face a big press conference a few hours after
tho morning papers had carried the story of the
►Soviet suspension of nuclear testing. He chose to
treat the Soviet move as a tricky and meaning
less propaganda stunt which they with their
closed society can exploit, whereas we in our
open and free society are unable to match it. This
theory may comfort him, but it is. I venture to
believe, a dangerous form of escapism from the
hard realities of the world situation.
For if rests on the notion that our many re
verses and tlie decline of our influence are due
not to defects in our policies but to the superior
advantages of the Soviet Union in propaganda.
That is to say, when our products do not sell, the
trouble lies not with the engineering in the qual
ity of the product but in the packaging and the
advertising. The whole world would agree with
John Foster Dulles if it were not that the world
is so gullible that it is being taken in by the
Russians. This is flattering to our pride, but it
is not true.
Consider, for example, the subject of nuclear
testing which Mr. Dulles was discussing. He
pointed out, quite truly, that the Soviet Union
has just completed a series of tests whereas we
are preparing to make a series of tests this
spring and summer. The Soviet trick is, he says.
1 o suspend the tests which they do not now need
for some time to come, hoping to prevent us from
making our tests which we very much need to
make.
But is this such a difficult triek to deal with?
The natural way to deal with it would be to say
that when we, like the Soviet Union, have com
pleted our tests, we too will suspend further
testing provided the Soviet Union does not re
sume testing. The world is not so gullible that
it would not understand the common sense of
this retort.
* * *
This retort is not, however, open to us because
the controlling fact is that our military position
in tho world is built upon the deterrent power of
nuclear weapons. It happens that Mr. Dulles
spoke of our desire "to eliminate nuclear weapons
effectively from tho international arsenals." Rut
why he said this, why he made so Utopian a
remark. I cannot imagine. For the elimination
of nuclear weapons would make quite impossible
the strategic containment through a network of
alliances to which he is committed.

This is the real reason why American propa
ganda works badly. If we cannot or will not
revise our policies, Mr. Dulles would do better to
be candid and to tell the world frankly that we
cannot suspend tests because we cannot abolish
nuclear weapons without a revolutionary change
in our foreign policy. He could then argue that
the Russians, with their massive conventional
forces and their interior lines, cannot be con
tained without nuclear weapons. This would not
make him beloved in the world. But it would
make him believed.
* *
All this applies to much more than the par
ticular issue of nuclear testing. American propa
ganda is in trouble not because the Russians are
able to lie with impunity but because in so many
critical areas American propaganda is trying to
sell policies which for one reason or another are
obsolete, are fictions, are profoundly unpopular.
There is the central fiction in the Far East
that Formosa is China, and that the actual gov
ernment of China on the mainland ought to dis
appear. No propaganda can make a policy based
on that fiction credible, much less convincing
and inspiring. In southern Asia there is the fic
tion —which defies strategic geography—that we
are arming Pakistan to defend the Middle Fast
against the Red army. This is a fiction which
has earned us the deep suspicion of India. In the
Middle East there is the fiction that the Arab
states will remain with the West if only we can
prevent the Soviet forces from invading them.
And in Europe there is the fiction that Ade
nauer's Germany will absorb East Germany, and
that in some unknown way the Red army will
roll itself back out of eastern Europe. The fact
of the matter is that the mass of the people do
not like these fictions, and the informed leaders
of opinion know they are fictions and do not
believe in them. That is why our propaganda
works badly.
* * *
A wise and experienced man said to me in
Paris that the Western world was in a political
decline, not so much because the Soviet Union
was so strong and so shrewd, but because the
Western democracies made so many mistakes
and lacked the political courage to rectify them.
Listening to Mr. Dulles at Tuesday's press con
ference, I wondered whether he was not trying
to escape from that bitter truth.

It was an ordeal for Secretary Dulles to have
to face a big press conference a few hours after
tho morning papers had carried the story of the
►Soviet suspension of nuclear testing. He chose to
treat the Soviet move as a tricky and meaning
less propaganda stunt which they with their
closed society can exploit, whereas we in our
open and free society are unable to match it. This
theory may comfort him, but it is. I venture to
believe, a dangerous form of escapism from the
hard realities of the world situation.
For if rests on the notion that our many re
verses and tlie decline of our influence are due
not to defects in our policies but to the superior
advantages of the Soviet Union in propaganda.
That is to say, when our products do not sell, the
trouble lies not with the engineering in the qual
ity of the product but in the packaging and the
advertising. The whole world would agree with
John Foster Dulles if it were not that the world
is so gullible that it is being taken in by the
Russians. This is flattering to our pride, but it
is not true.
Consider, for example, the subject of nuclear
testing which Mr. Dulles was discussing. He
pointed out, quite truly, that the Soviet Union
has just completed a series of tests whereas we
are preparing to make a series of tests this
spring and summer. The Soviet trick is, he says.
1 o suspend the tests which they do not now need
for some time to come, hoping to prevent us from
making our tests which we very much need to
make.
But is this such a difficult triek to deal with?
The natural way to deal with it would be to say
that when we, like the Soviet Union, have com
pleted our tests, we too will suspend further
testing provided the Soviet Union does not re
sume testing. The world is not so gullible that
it would not understand the common sense of
this retort.
* * *
This retort is not, however, open to us because
the controlling fact is that our military position
in tho world is built upon the deterrent power of
nuclear weapons. It happens that Mr. Dulles
spoke of our desire "to eliminate nuclear weapons
effectively from tho international arsenals." Rut
why he said this, why he made so Utopian a
remark. I cannot imagine. For the elimination
of nuclear weapons would make quite impossible
the strategic containment through a network of
alliances to which he is committed.

This is the real reason why American propa
ganda works badly. If we cannot or will not
revise our policies, Mr. Dulles would do better to
be candid and to tell the world frankly that we
cannot suspend tests because we cannot abolish
nuclear weapons without a revolutionary change
in our foreign policy. He could then argue that
the Russians, with their massive conventional
forces and their interior lines, cannot be con
tained without nuclear weapons. This would not
make him beloved in the world. But it would
make him believed.
* *
All this applies to much more than the par
ticular issue of nuclear testing. American propa
ganda is in trouble not because the Russians are
able to lie with impunity but because in so many
critical areas American propaganda is trying to
sell policies which for one reason or another are
obsolete, are fictions, are profoundly unpopular.
There is the central fiction in the Far East
that Formosa is China, and that the actual gov
ernment of China on the mainland ought to dis
appear. No propaganda can make a policy based
on that fiction credible, much less convincing
and inspiring. In southern Asia there is the fic
tion —which defies strategic geography—that we
are arming Pakistan to defend the Middle Fast
against the Red army. This is a fiction which
has earned us the deep suspicion of India. In the
Middle East there is the fiction that the Arab
states will remain with the West if only we can
prevent the Soviet forces from invading them.
And in Europe there is the fiction that Ade
nauer's Germany will absorb East Germany, and
that in some unknown way the Red army will
roll itself back out of eastern Europe. The fact
of the matter is that the mass of the people do
not like these fictions, and the informed leaders
of opinion know they are fictions and do not
believe in them. That is why our propaganda
works badly.

A wise and experienced man said to me in
Paris that the Western world was in a political
decline, not so much because the Soviet Union
was so strong and so shrewd, but because the
Western democracies made so many mistakes
and lacked the political courage to rectify them.
Listening to Mr. Dulles at Tuesday's press con
ference, I wondered whether he was not trying
to escape from that bitter truth.
