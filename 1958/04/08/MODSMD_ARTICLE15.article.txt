Pride Well Justified
Editor, The Daily:
Through a Now England winter and over the
sometimes - on - time New Haven Railroad, The
Daily has arrived at Stockbridge | Massachu
setts].
This feat is in itself commendable, but more
serious congratulations are due to you and your
staff for the quality of this quarter's Daily.
The photography is well planned and clear, the
make up interesting and readable, the quality of
reporting in most cases smooth and concise.
The addition of student as well as syndicated

columns adds interest. Your editorials have
chosen subjects of worthwhile concern.
The distinguishing characteristic is, in my
opinion, the effort you and your staff have made
to provide the campus with an equitable news
balance between national and campus affairs.
You are not only informing the student body
which supports you, but also lending much-need
ed assistance to campus organizations which
often depend upon your coverage for the success
of ther activities.
I believe the pride implicit in your newly
designed flag is well justified.
