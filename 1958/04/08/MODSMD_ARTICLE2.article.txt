### 
The detective bureau of the
Santa Clara County sheriff's of
fice has taken over investigation
of (he burglaries of two campus
fraternities early Sunday morn
ing. According to a spokesman
for the bureau, no new informa
tion will be released on the case
until the investigation is complet
ed, possibly this afternoon or to
morrow.
The burglaries occurred be
tween 1 and 7 a.m. in the Alpha
Tau Omega and Delta Chi houses.
Over $1500 in merchandise and
cash was stolen from members of
the two fraternities. Hardest hit
were the Delta Chi's. who lost five
typewriters worth $855, two
watches valued at $250 and about
$50 in cash.
The total value of the missing
merchandise and cash has not
been determined yet, said the
sheriff's office, because returning
members of the fraternities are
still discovering missing items.
According to Stanford police
chief Gordon Davis, the week
end's burglary was the most seri
ous on campus in several years.
Three television sets have been
stolen from living groups this
year, and there have been several
reports of thefts of small amounts
of cash from various fraternities
and other campus living groups,
said Chief Davis, but this is the
first theft of this kind on campus
in several years.
Members of the ATO and Delta
Chi houses told The Daily of two
possible clues to the burglars'
identity.
The ATO's reported the auto
license number of a person who
entered their house suspiciously a
few hours before the burglary;
and fingerprints from the Delta
Chi television set, which was sup
posedly moved by the burglars,
are being checked by the county
sheriff's office through the state
Central Intelligence and Identifi
cation Office in Sacramento.
