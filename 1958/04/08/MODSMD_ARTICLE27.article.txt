# Rally, Fight End H-Romb Protest Trek
## 
### 
ALLERMASTON, England f/P)
A four-day anti-H-bomb march
wound up in a field beside Brit
ain's nuclear weapons center yes
terclay with a rally and a light.
It was the first violence since
the marchers left London's Tra
falgar Square Good Friday on the
48-mile trek to this quiet country
village.
As the straggling, two-mile col
umn of 400U persons filed past
the locked and guarded gates of
the atomic weapons research es
tablishment, a loudspeaker car
swung onto the road booming:
"You're voting with your feet for
Soviet imperialist domination."
Parade organizers hastily
drove past the procession urging
restraint. For a while the march
ers obeyed.
But when the loudspeaker car
was driven into the field where
the marchers, were holding their
final rally, part of the crowd
surged forward angrily.
The loudspeaker went dead as
a wire was ripped loose. The
three men in the car climbed out
to protest and the crowd closed
in. Despite the pleas of a parade
official, fists were swung and
noses were bloodied.
The hecklers in the car were
Kennedy McWhirter. a 34-year-old
geneticist at Oxford University,
his journalist brother Norris and
Oxford undergraduate John Legh.
Posters they carried were torn
away and trampled. The trio
scrambled back into the car and
bumped away across the field
with demonstrators in pursuit.
The loudspeaker was pulled to
the ground, a radio antenna bent
and a couple of dents made in the
car trunk.
McWhirter said later he staged
ihe protest on his own and not
on behalf of any political organi
zation.
