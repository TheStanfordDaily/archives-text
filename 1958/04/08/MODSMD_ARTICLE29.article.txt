A good time was had by all when the Institute of International
Relations sponsored a Spring 1 Vacation Tour to Baja C alifornia.
Thirty-six American and foreign students spent one week camping
out and touring the Knsenada area. At top a group of students are
shown crossing the Mexican border. The bottom shot shows Birgit
Brock-lJtne of Oslo, Norway, and Michael Aral'o-Boakye of Ku
masi, Ghana, on a deep sea fishing trip.
