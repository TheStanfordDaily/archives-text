# Business School Establishes Part-time Study Program for Honors Students
## 
### 
A new honors program in the
Graduate School of Business will
enable employees from San Fran
cisco and Peninsula companies to
study part-time for a Master of
Business Administration degree
while continuing to work for
their companies.
The co-operating companies
will continue the honors students
at full pay but will reduce their
work week by the number of

hours spent in class ami commut

A small number of well-quali

nies will enroll for one or more
four-unit courses each quarter.
Preference will be given appli
cants with high scholastic records
and with undergraduate degrees
in engineering 01* science. Appli
