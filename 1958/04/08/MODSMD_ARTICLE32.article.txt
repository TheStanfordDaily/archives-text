More Hip Steps for Tribe Track
More testimony that track at Stanford is taking big steps for
ward under Payton Jordan went into the record book Saturday. Be
sides the two school records that were cracked, the Indians reached
another milestone on their way 10 the top.
Don Liebendort'er dug into his files and found that Saturday's
meet with USC marked the second time since 19-10 that Stanford has
won a majority of the events against the Trojans. And when was the
first time since '40? Last year. The eight individual victories the
Indians came away with marked the first time that had happened
since the Clyde Jeffrey-led team of 1940.
Last year's eight wins included seven individual and the one relay
triumph. What it all points up is that the caliber of the top perform
ers here is right up with that of the nation's perennially best team.
Stanford's present problem is to make sure it has place and show
points in its weak events, and to be sure there is support for the
winners in the strong spots.
Last year, for example, the Tribe was lacking power in the
880, mile and two-mile. So what happened? It got more than its
share of points in most of the events, but lost 25 or 27 in just three.
Ironically, this year's position is just reversed. The middle and
long races are the team's strong point, and it's the weights that are
giving problems. But give Jordan another year or two to develop
men in the present weak spots, and they'll join with the present
sophomore crop of distance men and sprinters to give the Indians
an excellent team.
Even though eight firsts in 15 events against USC sounds im
pressive enough by itself, consider that the Indians really had a ninlh
victory and were on the threshold of a 10th and 11th.
The real heart-breaker was suffered by javelin thrower Jim Back
strand. His event was won by Mike Page of the Trojans- at 206-1 Va,
and Rackstrand was third at 187-5.
But Baekstrand uncorked a throw of 21-1 feet during the compe
tition, and it didn't count. No— he didn't foul. What happened was
that the grass on Patterson Field had been unmowed for about three
weeks because of the heavy rains. So, the javelin came into the
heavy growth and failed to make a mark despite hitting point-first.
A fairly recent track rule, aimed at the Held javelin and its frequent
horizontal landings, provides that a definite mark must be made
for the throw to count.
No mark no count, and so Baekstrand didn't get his victory.
But if nothing else, the throw should give him confidence that he
can be flirting with 220 feet before very long.
Stanford Relay Troubles
Close call number two came in the relay. Norm Lloyd was as
much as eight yards behind Tom Anderson on the third leg, but
pulled to within four yards and was gaining more as he neared the
exchange zone. Lloyd was running head down and all out, and before
he realized it, he was into the passing zone and in lane one.
He had to almost stop to get into lane two for the pass to Don
Chesarek. The resultant bad pass cost the Indians nearly a full
second, and they lost the event by just three-tenths.
Close call number three came from over-anxiety on the part of
Maury Grave®. He was hanging right with Max Truex in the two
mile, and Truex was showing definite signs of fatigue. Graves
passed him with still a good lap to go, and Truex managed to perk
up and repass him near the end. It's second guessing, of course, and
isn't meant to detract from Graves' excellent 9:06.1. But if he had
waited until the last turn to pass Truex, he might have been by him
and into the finish before the Trojan ace could regroup his strength
for a final bid.
Stanford had some encouraging marks besides the winning ones.
In the 100, no more than a foot separated the first four men, and
there was plenty of discussion about who finished where. Out of the
final decision came 9.9 clockings for both Norm Pease and Ben
Anixter as they finished 3-4. Dean Smith was the 9.8 winner.
And in the shot, sophomore Jerry Winters got out to 51-2. and
missed second place by only 8 inches. Stanford's relay splits were
50.4 for Bob Besse, 48.5 for Dick Lassen, 48.3 for Lloyd and 47.9 for
Chesarek. Lassen also had a 49.4 in the flat quarter.
.Splits for Norm Lloyd in his great mile were 62.3, 2:03, 3:06 and
4:06. Ernie Cunliffe blazed his first 440 in 53.4. was 1:20.4 at the
660 mark, and finished with his near-record 1:51.0.
Newcomer Steve Coughlin looked OK in his first high-jumping
for Stanford, but he admitted he was nervous. It's only natural to
be that way, opening one's collegiate career againsf Charley Dumas,
so look for Coughlin to be at 6-5 before long.
Kent Hansen had rough luck in the broad jump and couldn't get
his step. After three fouls, the took a safety leap of 23-4 to make
the finals, but he still couldn't break into the top three.
John Kelly, winner of the broad jump, showed excellent come
through ability. The lead alternated between Kelly and Bob Lawson
throughout the competition as first Lawson would take the lead, and
then Kelly would take it back. His winning 24-foot effort came on his
last jump.
Pole-vaulter Mike Franclietti had all sorts of funny things happen
to him. He cleared 13 feet in practice before the meet, but couldn't
make the height during the competition. He was a foot over the
crossbar, but wasn't following through correctly and came down on
top of the bar.
Now if the rains will just hold off, the Indians will have a chance
to see what they can do against Fresno State. Chuck Cobb in par
ticular will have a rough battle on his hands with Ancel Robinson,
world low-hurdle record holder.
A FEW FINAL BASKETBALL NOTES—The complete NCAA
national stats for 1957-58 reflect lots of good things for Howie Dall
mar's club. The Indians finished fourth in free throw percentage
with 74.3 per cent and 16th in total defense, allowing 60.5 points per
game.
Paul Neumann was 25th in free throw percentage, where ranked
players had to score a minimum of 90 free throws. Jerry Thuesen
didn't quite hit the 90 mark, otherwise his 88.1 per cent effectiveness
would have put him second in the nation.
