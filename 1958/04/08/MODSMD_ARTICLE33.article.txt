Held hitless for six innings by Santa Clara right-hander Steve
Schott, the Stanford bats finally came alive in the seventh frame and
produced two runs as the Indians came from behind to beat the Bron
cos, 2-1.
Bob Leopold went all the way for Dutch Fehring's club and yielded

only three hits and an unearned
run. The victory boosted the
Tribe into undisputed first place
in the CIBA. They are now 3-0
in loop play, a nall'-game ahead
of USC.
The Indians will take to the
Sunken Diamond again today at
3:15 to play Camp Pendleton's
Marines. Fehring has named Dick
Williams to start and expects to
bring Wally Miller in along about
the fifth.
Today's meeting will be the sec
ond between the two clubs. The
Marines won a 3-1 battle when
Stanford toured the southland
during spring vacation.
Looked Like Enough
Santa Clara scored its tainted
tally in the second"frame, and it
looked for a while as though that
might be all it would take to win
the game.
The run came in when second
baseman Jim Kisinski got aboard
on shortstop Wayne Marion's er
ror, advanced to third on a double
by Mike Shea and came across on
Ed Allen's sacrifice fly to center
field.
The error was a tough break
for Marion, who had gone far to
his left to scoop up the ball but
then lost it. Leopold bore down
to retire Schott and Bob Chin
chiolo as Shea died at third.
Stanford's only offensive
threats during the first six in
nings were ihe result of five base
on-balls. The Cards couldn't even
get the ball out of the infield until
Leopold skied to right with one
down in the fifth.
DeFabio Breaks String
Rich DeFabio finally broke the
hitless fog with a sharp single to
right center. Marion executed a
good bunt that sent DeFabio to
second. Parker Olsen unloaded
the big blow of the inning when
he sent a long triple to the top of
the hill in left center.
Olsen then tried to come in on
a suicide squeeze play, but Leo
pold missed the ball and Olsen
was a dead duck at the plate.
Leopold redeemed himself with a
double to right, and that was all
for Schott.
Fra n k Sobrero, a portsider,
came in for the Broncos, and Jim
Burk greeted him with a single
to right that sent Leopold to
third. When right-fielder Goode
hobbled the ball. Leopold kept
right on running and brought the
winning run across the plate.
Nevvkirk Walks
Joel Newkirk worked Sobrero
for a walk that kept the rally
alive, but then Ben Robinson flied
out to center to end the inning.
Leopold got better as he went
along. In the first inning a walk
and an infield hit got him in trou
ble, but he escaped with a strike
out and a pop fly.
After the unearned run
second, the Broncos mounted no
sort of threat. Their third and
laÂ«t hit of the game came in the
third inning, but a double play
erased the runner.
Leopold Fans Nine
Leopold struck out nine men in
all and threw the fourth ball to
four batters. Santa Clara man
aged to leave only five men on
bi-se.
Outside of the seventh, Stan
ford didn't get a hit but had six
men on base through walks. Sev
en Cards were left, stranded.
