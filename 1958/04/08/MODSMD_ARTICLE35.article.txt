## 
### 
AUSTIN, Tex. (TPi Rookie Wil
lie Kirkland poled a three-run
homer yesterday to lead the San
Francisco Giants to a 7-0 exhibi
tion victory over the Cleveland
Indians behind the combined six
hit pitching of Johnnie Antonelli
and Paul Giel.
Cleveland's loss was ils 10th in
14 games against the Giants this
spring and its first shutout.
Antonelli, working slowly into
shape this season, rarely called
on any of his well-known fast
balls but he handled the Indians
easily in his longest stint thus
far. He spaced four hits oven
four of the seven innings he
worked and none of the Indians
reached third base against him.
