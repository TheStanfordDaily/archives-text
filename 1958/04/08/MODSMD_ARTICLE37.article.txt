Franchetti (5 -7, 140 - pound
junior from Santa Rosa) is the
top Stanford pole - vaulter de
spite the fact that he is one of
the shortest in the business.
His high point of 1957 came
with a 13-4 effort and victory
in the Big Meet. In winter
workouts, Franchetti was doing
two feet better than at the same
stage a season ago. Major:
Physics.

Limmer (6-2U, 222 - pound
sophomore from Culver City)
has the potential to become an
above - average college discus
thrower. His biggest problem
is putting his natural strength
into a well-integrated and form
ful throw. He hit 129 feet for
the frosh and scored occasional
points, but has already been
over 140 feet in workouts. Ma
jor: General Studies.
