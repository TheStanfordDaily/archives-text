# Plans Set for New Library For Undergrad Students
## 
### David Egger 
A new $2,000,000 Undergradu
ate Library in its own building
will be built on campus as soon
as funds are raised. The new li
brary would house 100,000 to 150,-
000 books on open shelves and
would include all books on as
signed reading lists in large un
dergraduate coursed
It would supplant the present
Reserved Book Room, the West
ern Civilization Library and other
special collections of books in
tended to provide assigned lead
ings.
In the new library, the reserve
book system would still be re
tained with a reserve collection
of 10,000 books to relieve much
of the pressure.
Assigned hooks would bo avail
able in multiple copies which
would circulate only when the li
brary is closed. Otherwise read
ing would be confined to the li
brary itself.
At least 1500 study seats would
be provided for the students.
These seats, rather than forming
one block, as in the present Re
serve Book Room, would be dis
tributed throughout the stacks
for comfort and privacy. Further,
easy chairs would be provided for
students who simply want to read
without taking notes.
Itr addition, at least !(> multiple
purpose rooms would be provided
throughout the building for semi
nars, colloquia, typing, smoking
or other needs.
Courts and terraces, partly
roofed over and provided with
durable chairs and benches for
conversations, study break s ,
smoking or spring reading were
also suggested.
In adrlition to books, the Under
graduate Librarv would house
collections of films, tapes and rec
ords to be used in connection

with courses in music, foreign
languages and drama.
In addition to the more obvious
benefits, the new library would
relieve the main library of many
of its present functions, such as
providing reading space for the
undergraduate student body, and
allowing it to concentrate on its
main function â€” that of serving
the research needs of faculty and
students, graduate or undergrad
uate.
The success of such a library
has been proven at Harvard,
where the Lamont Library pro
vides the undergraduates with
easy access to the books they
want to read and also enabled the
main library, Widener. to im
prove its service. Cornell is now
building such an Undergraduate
Library.
The estimated cost of such a
library is $2,382,400, according to
the faculty planning committee.
Books to stock the new library
would cost $000,000 more. The
annual increase in the budget of
(he libraries would be $83,643.
Many members of the senior
class agree with the faculty com
mittee that the need for such a
library is extreme.
