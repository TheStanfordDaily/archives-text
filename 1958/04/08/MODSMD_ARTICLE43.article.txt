A FRAT TO REMEMBER
Every year, :is \vc ;ill know, the Benevolent ;nid Protective
Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize
to the fraternity house which, in its judgment, has done the
most to promote and enhance the fraternity way of life. The
prize this year—eight hundred pounds of putty—goes to the
Alpha Hernia chapter of the South Dakota College of Dentistry
and Renaissance Art.
The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for the
Alpha Hernia house is the very model of all a fraternity should
be. It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically. The
outside walls are tastefully covered with sequins. Running along
the upper story is a widow's walk, with a widow stationed every
three feet. Moored to the chimneypot is the Craf Zeppelin.

Indoors the house gives ;tn impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple iiiul chintz,
with :i (litsli of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred
feet in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool
with the housemother bouncing, on the top.
Members' rooms iire gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which fold into the wall and are never seen again. Kadi
room also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp,
and a catapult for skect-shooting. Kidney-shaped desks are
available for kidney-shaped members.
Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboro* stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to enjoy a fine filtered cigarette in any room of the house, all
one need do is reach out one's hand in any direction and pick
up a Marlboro. Then one rubs two pledges togcther, lights one's
Marlboro, and [Mill's with sweet content the tastiest smoke the
mind of man has yet devised.
The decor, the grace, the Marlboros, all combine to make
Alpha Hernia a real gasser of a fraternity. I» ut a fraternity is
more than thinr/s; it is also people. And it is in the people depart
ment that Alpha Hernia, really shines.
Alpha, Hernia has among its members the biggest, BMOCs
on the entire campus of the South Dakota College of Dentistry
and Renaissance Art. There is, for instance, William Make
peace Sigaloos, charcoal and lain chairman ol the annual Stamp
Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner ol last years
All-South Dakota State Monoply Championship, i:>"> Pound
('lass. Then there is Hock Schwartz, who can sleep standing up.
Then there is Tremblant Placebo, who can crack pecans in his
armpits. Then there is Hulpli Tungsten, who went bald at eight.
But why go on? One can see what a splendid bunch ol chaps
there is in Alpha Hernia, and when one sees them at (he house
in the cool of the evening, all busy with their tasks—some
flicking locks, some playing Jacks-or-Belter, souk* clipping
Playboy—one's heart fills up and one's eyes grow misty, and
one cannot but give three cheers and a tiger lor Alpha Hernia,
fraternity of the year I _

A FRAT TO REMEMBER
Every year, :is \vc ;ill know, the Benevolent ;nid Protective
Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize
to the fraternity house which, in its judgment, has done the
most to promote and enhance the fraternity way of life. The
prize this year—eight hundred pounds of putty—goes to the
Alpha Hernia chapter of the South Dakota College of Dentistry
and Renaissance Art.
The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for the
Alpha Hernia house is the very model of all a fraternity should
be. It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically. The
outside walls are tastefully covered with sequins. Running along
the upper story is a widow's walk, with a widow stationed every
three feet. Moored to the chimneypot is the Craf Zeppelin.

Indoors the house gives ;tn impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple iiiul chintz,
with :i (litsli of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred
feet in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool
with the housemother bouncing, on the top.
Members' rooms iire gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which fold into the wall and are never seen again. Kadi
room also has a desk, a comfortable chair, a good reading lamp,
and a catapult for skect-shooting. Kidney-shaped desks are
available for kidney-shaped members.
Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboro* stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to enjoy a fine filtered cigarette in any room of the house, all
one need do is reach out one's hand in any direction and pick
up a Marlboro. Then one rubs two pledges togcther, lights one's
Marlboro, and [Mill's with sweet content the tastiest smoke the
mind of man has yet devised.
The decor, the grace, the Marlboros, all combine to make
Alpha Hernia a real gasser of a fraternity. I» ut a fraternity is
more than thinr/s; it is also people. And it is in the people depart
ment that Alpha Hernia, really shines.
