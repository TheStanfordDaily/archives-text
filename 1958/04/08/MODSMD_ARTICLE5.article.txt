# CUBAN REVOLT
## Police Raid On Arsenal Nets Rebels 
### 
HAVANA (/P) Raiding squads
arrested 26 men in Havana yes
terday in their campaign to
smash rebel plans for a threat
ened general strike and street
warfare.
Police said they seized arms,
explosives, shortwave radio gear,
a print shop, huge quantities of
rebel and Communist propaganda
and medical supplies.
The raids—part of a day-and

down any strikes. One measure
declared any judge ruling against
a government official or agency
would be fired immediately.
Minor C lavhes
Minor clashes continued be-
I ween rebel bands and govern
ment troops in Oriente Province.
Repulsing an attack on a sugar
mill at Niquero, the soldiers
killed one rebel and wounded one.
Railway traffic between Orien
te and Camagucy was suspended
after rebels blew up a string of
bridges. The railways administra
tion said building of temporary
spans is being rushed, and traffic
will be restored in a few days.
Rail service elsewhere was de
scribed as normal.
Dock workers at Guantanamo,
on the eastern tip of Cuba, stayed
away from the waterfront yester
day and asked the army's protec
