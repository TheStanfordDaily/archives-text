# Summer Travel Shots Available
## 
### 
Vaccinations for Stanford slu
dents who plan to travel abroad
this summer are now available at
the Stanford Health Service, ac
cording to the Student Health
Committee. Polio, typhoid, teta
nus and influenza shots are now
available.
The committee urges all slu
dents to come in for their shots
early to avoid a last-minute rush.
The Health Service is open for
shots daily from 1 to 1 p.m.
Influenza shots are free to all
registered students, and polio, let
anus and typhoid shots cost only
$1.25 each, which is far less than
they would cost elsewhere.
