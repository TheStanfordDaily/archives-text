# Ike Asks Study Of Peace Atom
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—President
Eisenhower called on Premier
Khrushchev yesterday to begin
East-West technical studies as a
prelude to an internationally su
pervised plan for channeling
atomic materials to peacetime
purposes only.
Eisenhower said such studies
arc needed immediately to strip
"the cloak of secrecy" from Rus
sia's single • handed atomic test
ban and to police any agreement
to halt production of atomic-hy
drogen bombs.
Eisenhower made this appeal
to Khrushchev in the first letter
he has sent him since the Soviet
Communist Party chief took over
as head of the Soviet government
13 days ago.
The 900-word message replied
to a letter Khrushchev sent Fri
day which challenged the United
States to follow Russia's lead and
announce a halt to nuclear tests
immediately without waiting for
further disarmament moves.
Letter Warns
Khrushchev's letter warned
that Russia would be free to re
sume tests if the United States
and Britain continued testing nu
clear weapons.
Secretary of State Dulles, a few
hours after the White House
made public Eisenhower's reply,
backed up the President's words
by saying a considerable degree
of inspection would be needed to
check Russia's promise to halt
tests.
Both Eisenhower and Dulles
made clear that American atomic

tests set to begin in the Pacific
within a few days would go on
as scheduled despite Russia's im
plied threat to resume its own
testing program.
More Testing
Dulles said there might be need
for further testing after the cur
rent series in order to develop
"cleaner" bombs—that is, bombs
with less radioactive fallout—and
smaller tactical weapons.
Eisenhower, who already has
denounced Russia's ban as just a
gimmick, struck out again at Rus
sia's tactics.
"It seems peculiar that the So
viet Union," he said, "having just
concluded a series of tests of un
precedented intensity, should
now, in bold headlines, say that
it will not test again, but add, in
small type, that it may test again
if the United States carries out
its already long announced and
now imminent series of tests."

now, in bold headlines, say that
it will not test again, but add, in
small type, that it may test again
if the United States carries out
its already long announced and
now imminent series of tests."
WASHINGTON (/P)—President
Eisenhower called on Premier
Khrushchev yesterday to begin
East-West technical studies as a
prelude to an internationally su
pervised plan for channeling
atomic materials to peacetime
purposes only.
Eisenhower said such studies
arc needed immediately to strip
"the cloak of secrecy" from Rus
sia's single • handed atomic test
ban and to police any agreement
to halt production of atomic-hy
drogen bombs.
Eisenhower made this appeal
to Khrushchev in the first letter
he has sent him since the Soviet
Communist Party chief took over
as head of the Soviet government
13 days ago.
The 900-word message replied
to a letter Khrushchev sent Fri
day which challenged the United
States to follow Russia's lead and
announce a halt to nuclear tests
immediately without waiting for
further disarmament moves.
Letter Warns
Khrushchev's letter warned
that Russia would be free to re
sume tests if the United States
and Britain continued testing nu
clear weapons.
Secretary of State Dulles, a few
hours after the White House
made public Eisenhower's reply,
backed up the President's words
by saying a considerable degree
of inspection would be needed to
check Russia's promise to halt
tests.
Both Eisenhower and Dulles
made clear that American atomic

tests set to begin in the Pacific
within a few days would go on
as scheduled despite Russia's im
plied threat to resume its own
testing program.
More Testing
Dulles said there might be need
for further testing after the cur
rent series in order to develop
"cleaner" bombs—that is, bombs
with less radioactive fallout—and
smaller tactical weapons.
Eisenhower, who already has
denounced Russia's ban as just a
gimmick, struck out again at Rus
sia's tactics.
"It seems peculiar that the So
viet Union," he said, "having just
concluded a series of tests of un
precedented intensity, should
now, in bold headlines, say that
it will not test again, but add, in
small type, that it may test again
if the United States carries out
its already long announced and
now imminent series of tests."
