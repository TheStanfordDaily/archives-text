## Socialist Is Communist: Rep. Walter 
### 
WASHINGTON 1 (/P) —Represen-
tative Walter (D-Pa.) said yes
terday Socialist Norman Thomas
served as a screen of respectabil
ity for Communist sympathizers
by joining in a court suit for the
ostensible purpose of halting U.S.
nuclear tests.
Walter, chairman of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities, said:
"Norman Thomas is simply
serving as a screen of respecta
bility while the black hand of the
Communist conspiracy remains
clearly visible."
Walter said that Linus C. Paul
ing and A. L. Wirin, among other
plaintiffs, "are, and for years
have been, the leading defenders
of Communist causes. The list of
their associations with Commu
nist actions and Communist ag
ents is as long as it is lethal."
In New York, Thomas said he
and his fellow-plaintiffs hope to
file similar suits in both England
and Russia. He added:
"Actually, Walter does me too
much honor. If he'll look at the
list there are many others besides
myself.
"I think I've been more effec
tive in fighting Communism over
many years than Walter. Because
there are more effective ways of
fighting it than he uses, for in
stance his immigration laws. I
think there are better ways of
fighting Communism than get
ting ready to kill off mankind."
