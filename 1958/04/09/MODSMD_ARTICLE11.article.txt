## Religious Emphasis Shows No Commitment Increase 
### Marilyn Moore 
"In spite of the religious em
phasis which has developed on
American college campuses dur
ing the past 12 or 13 years, the
percentage of students who actu
a 11 y commit themselves is no
higher than in previous years,"
says Father Gustave Weigel, vis
it in g Catholic educator from
Woodstock College, Maryland.
Father Weigel is giving three
public addresses here, the first of
which is today at 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley Auditorium on "The
Call to Austerity."
"By 'committing themselves' I
mean active adhesion to concrete
religious groups," the Jesuit fa
ther continued. "About 95 per
cent of youth are interested in—
are sympathetically curious about
—religion, and about 35 per cent
arc anxious, but the vast majority
are quite ignorant.
"Only about 20 per cent ask
themselves the ultimate religious
question: 'Do I commit myself
religiously and, if so. to whom?' "
One of the reasons Father Wei
gel gave for this ignorance is the
previous rejection of religion, of
ten resulting from the individu
al's background.
"Now, however," he said, "there
is no rejection on the part of
young people. The prevalent cam
pus religious interest originated
entirely with the students rather
than the faculty. The university
merely acq u iesced."
Completely Apart
Father Weigel said that in the
1920's and '30's religion was com
pletely divorced from tho univer
sity. "It was considered an en
tirely subjective, emotional af
fair," he said.
"Today, however, the university
is anxious to meet the religious
problem not only as a subjective
anxiety but as a concern of man
which must be studied."
The fact that there is no re
ligious homogeneity, that all the
churches are minorities, has pro
sen ted a difficulty to live univer
sity.
Some solutions that have been
tried are religion courses, again
with the problem of being dis
tinctly Christian or objective, and
falling back on Biblical religion.
Three-King Circus
"One great change," said Fa
ther Weigel, "is in the campus

gram. Formerly it was almost a
three-ring circus, as many reli
gious leaders were brought to the
campus, creating confusion in
stead of unity.
"Now one speaker from each
religion numerically significant
on the campus is invited to speak
from his church's viewpoint. That
is what I am doing here this
week."
This is Father VVeigel's second
visit to Stanford. He is making
this trip during the spring vaca
tion of Woodstock, a Jesuit col
lege, where he is professor of
ecclesiology.
A particular interest of Father
Weigel is that of Catholic-Protes
tant relations. He feels there is a
much better relationship than in
the past, as the "perverted views"
of both groups are disappearing
and th e y are collaborating on
common efforts.
"Friendly Awareness"
Also friendships are not as they
were 20 years ago, when religion
was never discussed, and there is
now a "friendly awareness" on
the part of both groups.
"Although relations are better,"
he said, "it would be very naive
to believe that we are now in the
'best of all possible worlds.' Cath
olic-Protestant tensions arc still
very deep and old animosities not
yet dead.
"The public sentiment toward
Senator John Kennedy is evidence
of this; mention "his name and
people arc immediately suspi
cious. It is a question of a visible
minority and a sociological issue."

"Now one speaker from each
religion numerically significant
on the campus is invited to speak
from his church's viewpoint. That
is what I am doing here this
week."
This is Father VVeigel's second
visit to Stanford. He is making
this trip during the spring vaca
tion of Woodstock, a Jesuit col
lege, where he is professor of
ecclesiology.
A particular interest of Father
Weigel is that of Catholic-Protes
tant relations. He feels there is a
much better relationship than in
the past, as the "perverted views"
of both groups are disappearing
and th e y are collaborating on
common efforts.
"Friendly Awareness"
Also friendships are not as they
were 20 years ago, when religion
was never discussed, and there is
now a "friendly awareness" on
the part of both groups.
"Although relations are better,"
he said, "it would be very naive
to believe that we are now in the
'best of all possible worlds.' Cath
olic-Protestant tensions arc still
very deep and old animosities not
yet dead.
"The public sentiment toward
Senator John Kennedy is evidence
of this; mention "his name and
people arc immediately suspi
cious. It is a question of a visible
minority and a sociological issue."
"In spite of the religious em
phasis which has developed on
American college campuses dur
ing the past 12 or 13 years, the
percentage of students who actu
a 11 y commit themselves is no
higher than in previous years,"
says Father Gustave Weigel, vis
it in g Catholic educator from
Woodstock College, Maryland.
Father Weigel is giving three
public addresses here, the first of
which is today at 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley Auditorium on "The
Call to Austerity."
"By 'committing themselves' I
mean active adhesion to concrete
religious groups," the Jesuit fa
ther continued. "About 95 per
cent of youth are interested in—
are sympathetically curious about
—religion, and about 35 per cent
arc anxious, but the vast majority
are quite ignorant.
"Only about 20 per cent ask
themselves the ultimate religious
question: 'Do I commit myself
religiously and, if so. to whom?' "
One of the reasons Father Wei
gel gave for this ignorance is the
previous rejection of religion, of
ten resulting from the individu
al's background.
"Now, however," he said, "there
is no rejection on the part of
young people. The prevalent cam
pus religious interest originated
entirely with the students rather
than the faculty. The university
merely acq u iesced."
Completely Apart
Father Weigel said that in the
1920's and '30's religion was com
pletely divorced from tho univer
sity. "It was considered an en
tirely subjective, emotional af
fair," he said.
"Today, however, the university
is anxious to meet the religious
problem not only as a subjective
anxiety but as a concern of man
which must be studied."
The fact that there is no re
ligious homogeneity, that all the
churches are minorities, has pro
sen ted a difficulty to live univer
sity.
Some solutions that have been
tried are religion courses, again
with the problem of being dis
tinctly Christian or objective, and
falling back on Biblical religion.
