Editor, The Daily:'
For many years the Stanford student body has
been governed in all phases of its several lives
by a system nominally based on the following
Fundamental Standard, a statement of policy by
the University's first president, Dr. David Starr
Jordan:
"Students are expected to show both within
and without the University such respect for or
der, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure
to do this will be sufficient cause for removal
from ihe University."
About a month ago, however, The Daily quoted
another statement by Dr. Jordan on the occasion
of the first student body elections; and if we
MUST govern our lives by a phrase snatched
from the mouth of David Starr Jordan, I am
provoked to offer the perhaps subversive sugges
tion that this latter statement might well serve
Stanford as a new and far superior Fundamental
Standard:
"Persons fit to be in college are fit to look after
lheir own affairs."

Editor, The Daily:
A statement in your recent editorial "Ideologi
cal Warfare" has it that "the whole subject
[propaganda] appears to be a good one for some
aspiring political scientist's thesis." As a matter
of fact it is, or rather was: "The Battle for Men's
Minds: America's 'Psychological Offensive' in the
'Cold War,' " by Albert George Pickerell, doctoral
dissertation, Stanford University, 1952, available
at your local political science department.
Smart department, that political science; it's
going places.
The only trouble with treating the subject in
an aspiring political scientist's thesis is that no
body ever reads the fool thing except the author
and his adviser. Perhaps we could aid in the
enlightenment of mankind by serializing these
learned manuscripts in The Daily. Then, on the
oilier hand, perhaps we couldn't. The insuffer
able, biweekly boredom of Walter Lippmann is
bad enough.

P.S. Your editorial, incidentally, was very
good; only it would have been cricket to point out
that the recent Russian coup is only the latest of
the embarrassing positions that Daddy Ike and
his friend Foster have been maneuvered into.
This, incredible regularity leaves even the politi
cal scientists baffled. One now suspects lhat "the
learn" has a dangerous, and not just a sad, dis
ordering of wits, as was formerly Iwlieved.
Favorable Conclusions
Editor, The Daily:
As the chairman of the 1957 Committee on
Graduation Exercises (a subcommittee of the
Committee on Public Exorcises). I appreciate the
invitation of Mr. Jack L. Hymans to make a few
comments concerning the last year's "mistake"
and "waste of time."
The elimination of the full-length Commence
ment address and the insertion of a system for
announcing the name of each recipient of a de
gree were both experiments attempted after a*
good deal of soul-searching by the committee.
A good deal of time was spent in considering the
various ramifications of two major changes in
ihe traditional order of exercises and in discus
sion with officers of the 1957 graduating class,
including its president, Fred Fortine. Without

wishing to commit Mr. Fori inn to a point of view,
the two experiments appeared to have his sup
port.
We were very fortunate in having two brief
but pertinent talks by a former President of the
United States and the president of this Univer
sity. The announcement of names took up the
time normally devoted to the longer Commence
ment address of previous years. The total length
of time consumed by the entire Commencement
program was about 10 minutes longer than the
program of the previous year.
Following the 1957 Commencement exercises,
a real effort was made to secure the reactions of
people who had attended the program, particu
larly those who had also attended previous exer
cises, in order to secure a basis of comparison.
We know that there were certainly people, as
Mr. Hymans states, who did not care for the pro
gram. This group included some parents, some
students and some of the faculty. On the other
hand, we received so many favorable comments
on the program, which seemed to outweigh sub
stantially the criticisms, that we concluded that
the experiments had been successful.
The 1958 exercises are in different hands, and
I cannot speak for this year's committee. I can
say, however, that the 1958 committee was, and
is, in no way bound by last year's experiments.
No doubt those in charge of the 1958 program
will wish to speak for themselves.
Mr. Hymans' comments are appreciated, and
it is certainly desirable that students in whose
honor the exercises are held should make their
wishes known. Having been associated with grad
uation exercises since tho-se of 1949, I know full
well that no program has gone perfectly (I sus
pect that none ever will), and that the 1957 exer
cises were no exception to this rule. Neverthe
less, the rather widespread reaction to the 1957
program which we received led us to favorable
conclusions concerning the experiments.

Editor, The Daily:
It is no doubt true, as was suggested in your
editorial "Ideological Warfare" (April 7), that
the Uniled States is doing an inadequate job as
far as international public relations is concerned.
At least two comments need to be made:
1. There is some question as to whether the
emphasis in American policy should be on propa
ganda, as suggested bv the editorial, or on edu
cation. The former implies ideological warfare,
praising our own virtues and, perhaps, preaching
of Ihe faults of the Russians. The latter ap
proach implies wor king toward world-wide under
standing, unity and cooperation. The cost of the
educational approach would be grealer, but there
is reason to believe that it would be more effec
tive in the long run.
2. More important, propaganda is not what is
needed primarily, but rather world leadership
(not just "free-world" leadership)—hold new pro
grams which are designed to caplure the imagi
nations of the world's people (including those of
the Communist nalions). Public relations, if ef
fective, is more than mere words. Effective pub
lic relations is built on the foundation of mutual
interest. The United States must first of all
demonstrate that its interests are more clearly
in line with tho.se of the rest of the world before
its public relations program can succeed. Propa
ganda (or education) alone cannot accomplish
this.

For many years the Stanford student body has
been governed in all phases of its several lives
by a system nominally based on the following
Fundamental Standard, a statement of policy by
the University's first president, Dr. David Starr
Jordan:
"Students are expected to show both within
and without the University such respect for or
der, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure
to do this will be sufficient cause for removal
from ihe University."
About a month ago, however, The Daily quoted
another statement by Dr. Jordan on the occasion
of the first student body elections; and if we
MUST govern our lives by a phrase snatched
from the mouth of David Starr Jordan, I am
provoked to offer the perhaps subversive sugges
tion that this latter statement might well serve
Stanford as a new and far superior Fundamental
Standard:
"Persons fit to be in college are fit to look after
lheir own affairs."

A statement in your recent editorial "Ideologi
cal Warfare" has it that "the whole subject
[propaganda] appears to be a good one for some
aspiring political scientist's thesis." As a matter
of fact it is, or rather was: "The Battle for Men's
Minds: America's 'Psychological Offensive' in the
'Cold War,' " by Albert George Pickerell, doctoral
dissertation, Stanford University, 1952, available
at your local political science department.
Smart department, that political science; it's
going places.
The only trouble with treating the subject in
an aspiring political scientist's thesis is that no
body ever reads the fool thing except the author
and his adviser. Perhaps we could aid in the
enlightenment of mankind by serializing these
learned manuscripts in The Daily. Then, on the
oilier hand, perhaps we couldn't. The insuffer
able, biweekly boredom of Walter Lippmann is

P.S. Your editorial, incidentally, was very
good; only it would have been cricket to point out
that the recent Russian coup is only the latest of
the embarrassing positions that Daddy Ike and
his friend Foster have been maneuvered into.
This, incredible regularity leaves even the politi

ordering of wits, as was formerly Iwlieved.
Favorable Conclusions
Editor, The Daily:
As the chairman of the 1957 Committee on
Graduation Exercises (a subcommittee of the
Committee on Public Exorcises). I appreciate the
invitation of Mr. Jack L. Hymans to make a few
comments concerning the last year's "mistake"
and "waste of time."
The elimination of the full-length Commence
ment address and the insertion of a system for
announcing the name of each recipient of a de
gree were both experiments attempted after a*
good deal of soul-searching by the committee.
A good deal of time was spent in considering the
various ramifications of two major changes in
ihe traditional order of exercises and in discus
sion with officers of the 1957 graduating class,
including its president, Fred Fortine. Without

wishing to commit Mr. Fori inn to a point of view,
the two experiments appeared to have his sup
port.
We were very fortunate in having two brief
but pertinent talks by a former President of the
United States and the president of this Univer
sity. The announcement of names took up the
time normally devoted to the longer Commence
ment address of previous years. The total length
of time consumed by the entire Commencement
program was about 10 minutes longer than the
program of the previous year.
Following the 1957 Commencement exercises,
a real effort was made to secure the reactions of
people who had attended the program, particu
larly those who had also attended previous exer
cises, in order to secure a basis of comparison.
We know that there were certainly people, as
Mr. Hymans states, who did not care for the pro
gram. This group included some parents, some
students and some of the faculty. On the other
hand, we received so many favorable comments
on the program, which seemed to outweigh sub
stantially the criticisms, that we concluded that
the experiments had been successful.
The 1958 exercises are in different hands, and
I cannot speak for this year's committee. I can
say, however, that the 1958 committee was, and
is, in no way bound by last year's experiments.
No doubt those in charge of the 1958 program
will wish to speak for themselves.
Mr. Hymans' comments are appreciated, and
it is certainly desirable that students in whose
honor the exercises are held should make their
wishes known. Having been associated with grad
uation exercises since tho-se of 1949, I know full
well that no program has gone perfectly (I sus
pect that none ever will), and that the 1957 exer
cises were no exception to this rule. Neverthe
less, the rather widespread reaction to the 1957
program which we received led us to favorable
conclusions concerning the experiments.

It is no doubt true, as was suggested in your
editorial "Ideological Warfare" (April 7), that
the Uniled States is doing an inadequate job as
far as international public relations is concerned.
At least two comments need to be made:
1. There is some question as to whether the
emphasis in American policy should be on propa
ganda, as suggested bv the editorial, or on edu
cation. The former implies ideological warfare,
praising our own virtues and, perhaps, preaching
of Ihe faults of the Russians. The latter ap
proach implies wor king toward world-wide under
standing, unity and cooperation. The cost of the
educational approach would be grealer, but there
is reason to believe that it would be more effec
tive in the long run.
2. More important, propaganda is not what is

At least two comments need to be made:
1. There is some question as to whether the
emphasis in American policy should be on propa
ganda, as suggested bv the editorial, or on edu
cation. The former implies ideological warfare,
praising our own virtues and, perhaps, preaching
of Ihe faults of the Russians. The latter ap
proach implies wor king toward world-wide under
standing, unity and cooperation. The cost of the
educational approach would be grealer, but there
is reason to believe that it would be more effec
tive in the long run.
2. More important, propaganda is not what is
needed primarily, but rather world leadership
(not just "free-world" leadership)—hold new pro
grams which are designed to caplure the imagi
nations of the world's people (including those of
the Communist nalions). Public relations, if ef
fective, is more than mere words. Effective pub
lic relations is built on the foundation of mutual
interest. The United States must first of all
demonstrate that its interests are more clearly
in line with tho.se of the rest of the world before
its public relations program can succeed. Propa
ganda (or education) alone cannot accomplish
this.

For many years the Stanford student body has
been governed in all phases of its several lives
by a system nominally based on the following
Fundamental Standard, a statement of policy by
the University's first president, Dr. David Starr
Jordan:
"Students are expected to show both within
and without the University such respect for or
der, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure
to do this will be sufficient cause for removal
from ihe University."
About a month ago, however, The Daily quoted
another statement by Dr. Jordan on the occasion
of the first student body elections; and if we
MUST govern our lives by a phrase snatched
from the mouth of David Starr Jordan, I am
provoked to offer the perhaps subversive sugges
tion that this latter statement might well serve
Stanford as a new and far superior Fundamental
Standard:
"Persons fit to be in college are fit to look after
lheir own affairs."

A statement in your recent editorial "Ideologi
cal Warfare" has it that "the whole subject
[propaganda] appears to be a good one for some
aspiring political scientist's thesis." As a matter
of fact it is, or rather was: "The Battle for Men's
Minds: America's 'Psychological Offensive' in the
'Cold War,' " by Albert George Pickerell, doctoral
dissertation, Stanford University, 1952, available
at your local political science department.
Smart department, that political science; it's
going places.
The only trouble with treating the subject in
an aspiring political scientist's thesis is that no
body ever reads the fool thing except the author
and his adviser. Perhaps we could aid in the
enlightenment of mankind by serializing these
learned manuscripts in The Daily. Then, on the
oilier hand, perhaps we couldn't. The insuffer
able, biweekly boredom of Walter Lippmann is
bad enough.

P.S. Your editorial, incidentally, was very
good; only it would have been cricket to point out
that the recent Russian coup is only the latest of
the embarrassing positions that Daddy Ike and
his friend Foster have been maneuvered into.
This, incredible regularity leaves even the politi
cal scientists baffled. One now suspects lhat "the

ordering of wits, as was formerly Iwlieved.
Favorable Conclusions
Editor, The Daily:
As the chairman of the 1957 Committee on
Graduation Exercises (a subcommittee of the
Committee on Public Exorcises). I appreciate the
invitation of Mr. Jack L. Hymans to make a few
comments concerning the last year's "mistake"
and "waste of time."
The elimination of the full-length Commence
ment address and the insertion of a system for
announcing the name of each recipient of a de
gree were both experiments attempted after a*
good deal of soul-searching by the committee.
A good deal of time was spent in considering the
various ramifications of two major changes in
ihe traditional order of exercises and in discus
sion with officers of the 1957 graduating class,
including its president, Fred Fortine. Without

wishing to commit Mr. Fori inn to a point of view,
the two experiments appeared to have his sup
port.
We were very fortunate in having two brief
but pertinent talks by a former President of the
United States and the president of this Univer
sity. The announcement of names took up the
time normally devoted to the longer Commence
ment address of previous years. The total length
of time consumed by the entire Commencement
program was about 10 minutes longer than the
program of the previous year.
Following the 1957 Commencement exercises,
a real effort was made to secure the reactions of
people who had attended the program, particu
larly those who had also attended previous exer
cises, in order to secure a basis of comparison.
We know that there were certainly people, as
Mr. Hymans states, who did not care for the pro
gram. This group included some parents, some
students and some of the faculty. On the other
hand, we received so many favorable comments
on the program, which seemed to outweigh sub
stantially the criticisms, that we concluded that
the experiments had been successful.
The 1958 exercises are in different hands, and
I cannot speak for this year's committee. I can
say, however, that the 1958 committee was, and
is, in no way bound by last year's experiments.
No doubt those in charge of the 1958 program
will wish to speak for themselves.
Mr. Hymans' comments are appreciated, and
it is certainly desirable that students in whose
honor the exercises are held should make their
wishes known. Having been associated with grad
uation exercises since tho-se of 1949, I know full
well that no program has gone perfectly (I sus
pect that none ever will), and that the 1957 exer
cises were no exception to this rule. Neverthe
less, the rather widespread reaction to the 1957
program which we received led us to favorable
conclusions concerning the experiments.

well that no program has gone perfectly (I sus
pect that none ever will), and that the 1957 exer

program which we received led us to favorable
conclusions concerning the experiments.

It is no doubt true, as was suggested in your
editorial "Ideological Warfare" (April 7), that
the Uniled States is doing an inadequate job as
far as international public relations is concerned.
At least two comments need to be made:
1. There is some question as to whether the
emphasis in American policy should be on propa
ganda, as suggested bv the editorial, or on edu
cation. The former implies ideological warfare,
praising our own virtues and, perhaps, preaching
of Ihe faults of the Russians. The latter ap
proach implies wor king toward world-wide under
standing, unity and cooperation. The cost of the
educational approach would be grealer, but there
is reason to believe that it would be more effec
tive in the long run.
2. More important, propaganda is not what is
needed primarily, but rather world leadership
(not just "free-world" leadership)—hold new pro
grams which are designed to caplure the imagi
nations of the world's people (including those of
the Communist nalions). Public relations, if ef
fective, is more than mere words. Effective pub
lic relations is built on the foundation of mutual
interest. The United States must first of all
demonstrate that its interests are more clearly
in line with tho.se of the rest of the world before
its public relations program can succeed. Propa
ganda (or education) alone cannot accomplish
this.

For many years the Stanford student body has
been governed in all phases of its several lives
by a system nominally based on the following
Fundamental Standard, a statement of policy by
the University's first president, Dr. David Starr
Jordan:
"Students are expected to show both within
and without the University such respect for or
der, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure
to do this will be sufficient cause for removal
from ihe University."
About a month ago, however, The Daily quoted
another statement by Dr. Jordan on the occasion
of the first student body elections; and if we
MUST govern our lives by a phrase snatched
from the mouth of David Starr Jordan, I am
provoked to offer the perhaps subversive sugges
tion that this latter statement might well serve
Stanford as a new and far superior Fundamental
Standard:
"Persons fit to be in college are fit to look after
lheir own affairs."

A statement in your recent editorial "Ideologi
cal Warfare" has it that "the whole subject
[propaganda] appears to be a good one for some
aspiring political scientist's thesis." As a matter
of fact it is, or rather was: "The Battle for Men's
Minds: America's 'Psychological Offensive' in the
'Cold War,' " by Albert George Pickerell, doctoral
dissertation, Stanford University, 1952, available
at your local political science department.
Smart department, that political science; it's
going places.
The only trouble with treating the subject in
an aspiring political scientist's thesis is that no
body ever reads the fool thing except the author
and his adviser. Perhaps we could aid in the
enlightenment of mankind by serializing these
learned manuscripts in The Daily. Then, on the
oilier hand, perhaps we couldn't. The insuffer
able, biweekly boredom of Walter Lippmann is
bad enough.

P.S. Your editorial, incidentally, was very
good; only it would have been cricket to point out
that the recent Russian coup is only the latest of
the embarrassing positions that Daddy Ike and
his friend Foster have been maneuvered into.
This, incredible regularity leaves even the politi
cal scientists baffled. One now suspects lhat "the
learn" has a dangerous, and not just a sad, dis
ordering of wits, as was formerly Iwlieved.
Favorable Conclusions
Editor, The Daily:
As the chairman of the 1957 Committee on
Graduation Exercises (a subcommittee of the
Committee on Public Exorcises). I appreciate the
invitation of Mr. Jack L. Hymans to make a few
comments concerning the last year's "mistake"
and "waste of time."
The elimination of the full-length Commence
ment address and the insertion of a system for
announcing the name of each recipient of a de
gree were both experiments attempted after a*
good deal of soul-searching by the committee.
A good deal of time was spent in considering the
various ramifications of two major changes in
ihe traditional order of exercises and in discus
sion with officers of the 1957 graduating class,
including its president, Fred Fortine. Without

wishing to commit Mr. Fori inn to a point of view,
the two experiments appeared to have his sup
port.
We were very fortunate in having two brief
but pertinent talks by a former President of the
United States and the president of this Univer
sity. The announcement of names took up the
time normally devoted to the longer Commence
ment address of previous years. The total length
of time consumed by the entire Commencement
program was about 10 minutes longer than the
program of the previous year.
Following the 1957 Commencement exercises,
a real effort was made to secure the reactions of
people who had attended the program, particu
larly those who had also attended previous exer
cises, in order to secure a basis of comparison.
We know that there were certainly people, as
Mr. Hymans states, who did not care for the pro
gram. This group included some parents, some
students and some of the faculty. On the other
hand, we received so many favorable comments
on the program, which seemed to outweigh sub
stantially the criticisms, that we concluded that
the experiments had been successful.
The 1958 exercises are in different hands, and
I cannot speak for this year's committee. I can
say, however, that the 1958 committee was, and
is, in no way bound by last year's experiments.
No doubt those in charge of the 1958 program
will wish to speak for themselves.
Mr. Hymans' comments are appreciated, and
it is certainly desirable that students in whose
honor the exercises are held should make their
wishes known. Having been associated with grad
uation exercises since tho-se of 1949, I know full
well that no program has gone perfectly (I sus
pect that none ever will), and that the 1957 exer
