# Tonight at the Symphony
## 
### Margot Zeiss 
Stanford music professor Leon
ard Ratners* "Harlequin" Over
lure will have its local premiere
tonight at the San Francisco
Symphony Concert. Sharing the
local premiere spotlight will he
the Symphony in D minor by
Wilhelm Friedmann Bach.
Guest soloist appearing this
week is pianist Robert Mueller.
He will be featured in Ravel's
Piano Concerto in G major. Muel
ler has been a favorite of the Bay
Area since his debut here in 1950.
Three years later he won the San
Francisco Music Critics Award.
European critics upheld the more
than favorable judgment of Muel
ler's musicianship during his
1956 tour by "acclaiming him a
new virtuoso."
The fourth work of Ihe evening
will be Symphony No. 2 in D by
the Finnish composer Jan Julius
Christian Sibelius. This second
of his seven Symphonies was
written in 1901-1902.
Movement number one depicts
the quiet pastoral life of the
Fins, "undisturbed by thought of
oppression." The second move
ment is charged with patriotic
feeling. A lonely melody carried
by the bassoon is heard over the
low - muttering plucked strings
which is followed by the quick
ening of the pace.
The third movement is in the
nature of a scherzo and portrays
the awakening of natural feeling
and desire to organize in defense
of their rights. Then suddenly
everything is very still while Ihe
oboe sings a quiet song — then
once again the feverish pitch is
resumed as quickly as it had de
clined.

The opening of the fourth
movement is announced by the
strings followed by the trumpets,
and takes the form of a triumph
ant proclamation. A hush falls
on the music, but soon the or
chestra surges forward again—
at first slowly and deliberately,
but gathering momentum and fi
nally attaining two successive
climaxes of overwhelming inten
sity and power.

which is followed by the quick
ening of the pace.
The third movement is in the
nature of a scherzo and portrays
the awakening of natural feeling
and desire to organize in defense
of their rights. Then suddenly
everything is very still while Ihe
oboe sings a quiet song — then
once again the feverish pitch is
resumed as quickly as it had de
clined.

The opening of the fourth
movement is announced by the
strings followed by the trumpets,
and takes the form of a triumph
ant proclamation. A hush falls
on the music, but soon the or
chestra surges forward again—
at first slowly and deliberately,
but gathering momentum and fi
nally attaining two successive
climaxes of overwhelming inten
sity and power.
