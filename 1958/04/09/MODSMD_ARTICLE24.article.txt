Five runs on night hits, four of them in the fifth inning, gave Stanford's varsity nine a three-point
advantage over tho Marines from Camp Pendleton in a slow-moving game yesterday afternoon on
the Sunken Diamond. A bases-loaded triple by Card shortstop Wayne Marion opened up the game
and showed the Indians the way to their 5-2 win, avenging the loss ihey suffered to the Marines two
weeks ago in Southern California.
The first four and one-half innings of the game were scoreless as the service club's starting pitcher,

Bob Vruck, halted several Stan
ford attempts to score. He was
able to do nothing, however, in
the bottom of the fifth when the
Indians shelled him for four runs
on three hits.
First baseman Joel Newkirk
provided the first score when he
crossed the plate on a double by
catcher Ralph Holding. Then,
with two -outs and bases loaded,
Marion opened up with a triple
to right field to drive in three
runs and set up the Stanford win.
The only other run the Indians
were able to get came in the sev
enth, when second baseman A 1
Shaw tripled to left field and was
then driven in by a single to right
field by Marion.
Stanford pitcher Dick Williams
started for the Indians and went
for six innings, striking out five
batters, giving up only three hits
and three bases on halls. He was
followed by Wally Miller who
pitched for 1 2 /\ innings, giving up
one run and one hit. Left-hander
Bob Cockayne finished the game,
yielding one run.
