# GOOD MARKS EXPECTED
## Cards Host Fresno In Saturday Meet 
### 
Clear skies and warm breezes
have considerably brightened
prospects that the Stanford-Fres
no State track meet will be held
on the Stadium track Saturday
afternoon.
Assuming that the good weath
er holds on—and there's no rain
forecast for at least five more
days — the Indians should be
ready to put out with another
good set of marks against the
Staters.
Stanford had no warm-weather
workouts before the USC meet,
yet many of the team came
through with best-of-life marks.
Fresno State isn't nearly as deep
as the Trojans, but it does have
enough good individuals to make
the meet plenty close.
Close in '57
Against almost an identical
team last year, Stanford had to
go all the way to the relay before

it could come off with a 70-01 vic
tory.
The Indians' biggest problem
may be getting up a big head of
steam for Saturday. The meet is
in some respects a lull belvveen
the battle with the Trojans and a
three-week onslaught with Occi
dental, UCLA and California.
Nonetheless, the Indians will
have to be at peak efficiency to
come off with a victory against
Fresno.

matched men.
