# Know Your Indians
## 
### 
Newkirk (6-2V2, 170-pound
junior from Fullerton) is one
of Ihe classiest fielding first
basemen in West Coast college
baseball. Big problem last year
was at the plate, but this seems
solved as he's hitting near .300
so far this season. Unusual
combination of left - handed
thrower, but right-handed bat
ter. Major: Economics.

Burk (6-0, 165-pound sopho
more from Danville) has been
the season's biggest'surprise.
Took over the third base job in
the Fresno State series and won
both games with timely hits.
Also knocked in the winning
run against Santa Clara Mon
day. Currently leads team in
hitting. Now batting in lead
off spot. Major: Economics.

("Know Your Indians" appears Tuesday through Friday)
