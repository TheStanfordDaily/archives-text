# SMOGGERS THIS WEEKEND
## Tribe Tennismen Take On Portland U.; Locals Seek Third Straight Win Today 
### 
The Stanford varsity tennis
team will be out to get their third
win of the year when they take
on the University of Portland on
the Stanford courts this after
noon at 1:30.
The match will be the last Stan
ford outing before this weekend's
trip to Los Angeles where the
Cards will open the 1958 PCC sea
son against USC and UCLA.
The Stanford netters have been
badly hindered by the adverse
weather conditions of late which
have cut out a week of practice,
but even without the practice
S t anford shouldn't have too
tough a time with Portland.
Card coach Bob Renker expects
to use all his first - line men
against Portland today in order
to give them some sort of a work
out before the weekend. Jack
Douglas will be in his usual num
ber one position with Brooks
Rawlins second and Dave Nelson
third.
After Nelson, the players for

the remaining positions will be
chosen from among Gil White,
Lowell Carruth, Jim Jeffries and
Robin Hijgeman.
Portland figures to send only
five men to play today which will
limit the match to five singles

and two doubles as opposed to
the usual six-three pattern.
The doubles teams, which coach
Renker has shifted quite a bit
this season, will probably line up
with two of these four possible
teams seeing action: Douglas-
Rawlins, Carruth-Nelson, White-
Hilgeman, or either White or Hil
geman with Jeffries.
Greatest interest in the match
will be directed toward the last
two positions for it is in these
two spots in both singles and
doubles whore the Stanford -SC
and Stanford - UCLA matches
might be decided.
A good showing in all of these
spots will send Stanford off to
the south with much greater
hopes.
Another interesting match will
be the first singles match in which
Stanford's Douglas will take on
Bill Rose of Portland. Rose, a
steady netter, took Douglas to
three sets last year before losing.

Stanford's Douglas will take on
Bill Rose of Portland. Rose, a
steady netter, took Douglas to
three sets last year before losing.
The Stanford varsity tennis
team will be out to get their third
win of the year when they take
on the University of Portland on
the Stanford courts this after
noon at 1:30.
The match will be the last Stan
ford outing before this weekend's
trip to Los Angeles where the
Cards will open the 1958 PCC sea
son against USC and UCLA.
The Stanford netters have been
badly hindered by the adverse
weather conditions of late which
have cut out a week of practice,
but even without the practice
S t anford shouldn't have too
tough a time with Portland.
Card coach Bob Renker expects
to use all his first - line men
against Portland today in order
to give them some sort of a work
out before the weekend. Jack
Douglas will be in his usual num
ber one position with Brooks
Rawlins second and Dave Nelson
third.
After Nelson, the players for

the remaining positions will be
chosen from among Gil White,
Lowell Carruth, Jim Jeffries and
Robin Hijgeman.
Portland figures to send only
five men to play today which will
limit the match to five singles

and two doubles as opposed to
the usual six-three pattern.
The doubles teams, which coach
Renker has shifted quite a bit
this season, will probably line up
with two of these four possible
teams seeing action: Douglas-
Rawlins, Carruth-Nelson, White-
Hilgeman, or either White or Hil
geman with Jeffries.
Greatest interest in the match
will be directed toward the last
two positions for it is in these
two spots in both singles and
doubles whore the Stanford -SC
and Stanford - UCLA matches
might be decided.
A good showing in all of these
spots will send Stanford off to
the south with much greater
hopes.
Another interesting match will
be the first singles match in which
Stanford's Douglas will take on
Bill Rose of Portland. Rose, a
steady netter, took Douglas to
three sets last year before losing.
