# SUICIDE
## Counselors Provide Aid 
### Jack Winkler 
(Editor's Note: This is the
second article in a three-part
series on suicide at Stanford,
its incidence and causes'and the
preventive help provided by the
University.)

After a Stanford student makes
an unsuccessful attempt at sui
cide, a long process of care is
started to insure his recovery.
Usually he is taken directly to
Palo Alto Hospital immediately to
take care of the physical injury
and shock effects. One doctor
from the Health Service is on
duty each night in the emergency
room of the hospital.
After the student has physical
ly recovered from the attempt, he

is usually given a medical leave
from the University.
One student who attempted sui
cide this year was at the Palo
Alto Hospital for three days and
then released in the custody of
her parents. Another went to a
private sanitarium, another to a
state institution. One girl was re
leased and returned directly to
school.
Other, Alternatives
The only other alternative for
a person who has lived through
his suicide attempt is to be re
leased with no other treatment
prescribed to do as he wishes.
This would apply only to persons
over 21.
When a person is on medical
leave he is not under the care of
the Student Health Service. It
and when he returns to school
after his convalescence the Dean's
Office is aware of the record
Dr. George Houck of the Health
Service keeps in personal contact
with the student and has frequent
consultations with him. He is not
left by himself, as it were, to go
through the same ordeal again.
The preceding is what the Uni
versity does after a suicide at
tempt has occurred. The frame
work for helping a person wilh
emotional problems BEFORE he
attempts suicide is even more ex
tensive, however.
Starts Simply
II starts simply enough wilh
lhe sponsors and the resident as
sistants <I>. Then there are the
deans, always available for per
sonal talks (2). Chaplain Minto
and his assistant, Thomas Derr,
regularly have appointments for
personal counseling (3). There
are the Counseling and Testing
Center (I), the Health Service
(5) and two psychiatrists, Dr.
Oremland and Dr. Charles E.
Shepard 16 and 7J.

The most convenient source for
trained, specialized help with emo
tional problems is the Student
Health Service. Dr. Houck sees a
great number of people for per
sonal counseling.
"The exact number is difficult
to estimate," he says, "because
they express their problems in
many different ways.
"Usually they will come in with
an unrelated problem, wanting to
see if the physician is sympathetic
to their needs. This is a gambit
of a trivial complaint which cov
ers up the real difficulty.
"Often they are coerced into
coming by friends, faculty, or
sponsors â€” but almost never by
parents.
(on fidential
Dr. Houck emphasized that
"Everything told to us at the
Health Service is confidential
with only four exceptions:
"1. Communicable diseases
must be reported to the state.
"2. A gunshot or knife wound
must he reported to the police.
"3. Serious injury or disease is
reported to the parents if the stu
dent is under 21.
"1. Our files can be subpoenaed
by a court.
Greatest Incidence
"This is the age group of great
est incidence of suicide college
fige but it must be remembered
that, suicides and suicide attempts
are only symptoms of other in
ternal troubles. We expect about
1i) suicide attempts a year, and
our situation is just about the
median of any large university.
"Probably a selective pattern of
university admission brings us
those who are most susceptible.
In other words, a group of Stan
ford students is more liable to at
tempt suicide than a similar
group of young farm workers, for
instance."
