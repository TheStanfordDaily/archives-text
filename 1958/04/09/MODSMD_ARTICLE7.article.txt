# Wide, Sensible Education To Bridge Culture Gap
## 
### Dick Frey, Managing Editor 
"A sensible, broadly-based high school education" is necessary
to bridge the current gulf between the traditional and scientific "cul
tures," Sir Charles Percy Snow told a large Tuesday Evening Series
audience last night.
Snow, eminent British novelist and scientist, wittily described the

divergence in thinking which al
most completely separates the
scientific and literary minds of
today. This divergence in
thought, caused primarily by spe
cialization, has led to the creation
of stereotypic beliefs by literary
persons as to the role and
thought of that mechanical being,
the scientist. Likewise, the scien
tist has little use for the literary
set, which he believes harbors
thoughts of defeatism and intel
lectual corruption and has no se
rious ethical standards.
"It is doubtful whether such a
divided cult can be productive or
happy at the human level," Snow
said.
Chances for a bridge between
these divergent cultures naturally
exists through education, accord
ing to Snow. The systems of high
school education in both the Unit
ed States and Great Britain are
failing to bridge this gap, al
though in different ways, he said.
