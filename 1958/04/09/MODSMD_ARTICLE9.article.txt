### 
Two new petitions for ASSU offices and one petition for a class
post were received by Elections Commission yesterday.
This brings the total number of petitions for ASSU and class
offices to a scant nine persons.
Carolee Houser, Paloma House, Florence Moore Hall, has filed for

ASSU vice-president. She is a
junior from Long Beach and was
a Branner sponsor last quarter.
She is unopposed so far in the
vice-presidential race.
Bob Roberts, Phi Kappa Sigma,
is a candidate for head yell lead
er. Sam Reis, Delta Chi, previ
ously filed for head yell leader.
The only candidate who has filed
for any class office is Jim Rob
ertson of Stern Hall, who will
run for senior class president.
Candidates who previously filed
are John Bohn, Tom Kranz and
Bill Post for ASSU president and
Gary Broemser and Clifford Ter
ry for LASSU posts.
No Candidates
Thus far there are no candi
dates for senior class viee-presi
dent or busines manager and no
one has filed for any junior or
sophomore class post. The six
Men's and Women's Judicial
Council positions have no candi
dates as yet, and no one has filed
for any of the four AWS elective
offices.
In a statement to The Daily,
ASSU President Jim Messinger
urged students to file and run for
positions in their government.
Said Messinger, "The keen edge
of competition provides a more
critical basis for selection of stu
dents to represent us, the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity. Competition enhances the
posibility of our selecting to crew
our "ship of state" a group of
competent, constructively critical
people who will provide a real
service to the community. Nine
candidates filing for over 20 ma

jor ASSU and class offices surely
do not provide this competition
nor represent the potential to be
found in this student body."

run for senior class president.
Candidates who previously filed
are John Bohn, Tom Kranz and
Bill Post for ASSU president and
Gary Broemser and Clifford Ter
ry for LASSU posts.
No Candidates
Thus far there are no candi
dates for senior class viee-presi
dent or busines manager and no
one has filed for any junior or
sophomore class post. The six
Men's and Women's Judicial
Council positions have no candi
dates as yet, and no one has filed
for any of the four AWS elective
offices.
In a statement to The Daily,
ASSU President Jim Messinger
urged students to file and run for
positions in their government.
Said Messinger, "The keen edge
of competition provides a more
critical basis for selection of stu
dents to represent us, the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Uni
versity. Competition enhances the
posibility of our selecting to crew
our "ship of state" a group of
competent, constructively critical
people who will provide a real
service to the community. Nine
candidates filing for over 20 ma

jor ASSU and class offices surely
do not provide this competition
nor represent the potential to be
found in this student body."
