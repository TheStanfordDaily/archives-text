"Jockey brand underwear
made me Phs Beta Kappa!"
" 'Amazing scholarship', said the Dean. 'Cheating!' cried my
fellow students. But I knew the real reason for my becoming an
honor student. My tailored-to-fit Jockey brand briefs were so
comfortable that naturally I found it easy to study better and
get straight A's."
" 'If your brand is Jockey, you won't need any ponies', I tell
my friends. It's true, too. You see, Jockey—and only Jockey
brand—uses thirteen separate pieces to provide a perfectly smooth
fit. You feel better—and you study belter—when you wear com
fortable Jockey briefs."
