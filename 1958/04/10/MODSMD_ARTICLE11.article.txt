# SUICIDE PSYCHOLOGY
## More Student Problems In Spring, Minto Says 
### Jack Winkler 
(Editor's Note: This is the
third article in a series on sui
cide at Stanford, its incidence
and causes and the preventive
help provided by the Univer
sity.)

Chaplain Minlo estimates tic
sees over 15 people a week for
personal talks. "The first call on
my time is the student who wants
to see me at my office or in my
home," he said.
"I am not interested in religion
here, but in problems. There are
many people who are afraid of
formal psychiatric counseling,
and I try to treat them as friends.
All this is strictly confidential —
nothing goes on a person's so
called 'record.'"
Minto also noticed the greater
number of appointments toward
the end of a quarter than at the
middle.
lie also noted what seems to be
a trend in student problems.
There arc more of them in Ihe
spring than during any other
quarter. This coincides with the
greater number of attempted sui
cides during this quarter.
Though it is difficult to speak
of an average when dealing with
so small a number as this, so far
Stanford suicide attempts are
running slightly above normal
this year.
The most specialized help, how
ever, comes from the two psychi
atrists who regularly see Stan
ford students —Dr. Shepard and
Dr. Oremland.
In both January and February

Shepard saw 41 Stanford stu
dents. Oremland camc to Palo
Alto the Monday after tho Cordry
murder and saw between 10 and
15 people in lire two weeks until
the end of the quarter.
Oremland is a graduate of the
Stanford Medical School, and on
his assignment with the Palo Alto
Clinic he devotes from one-half
to one-third of his time to student
cases.
It is difficult to estimate the
yearly number of Stanford stu
dents who take advantage of the
facilities offered for emotional
counseling.

In any case, the number is
much larger than might first be
supposed. But this is not a prob
lem of numbers. Primarily it is
an individual matter, and the fa
cilities for meeting personal prob
lems confidentially and profes
sionally right here in the Stan
ford area are extensive.
And all this help is free. Even
formal psychiatric counseling is
covered under tho Health Service.
The problem of suicide is a dra
matic one and of particular rele
vance to this campus.
"There is no distinction between
suicide attempts and suicides,"
says Dr. Jackson. "It is bringing
notice to oneself. It is a cry for
help."
"Ordinarily the seriousness of
the attempt is not important,"
says Dr. Oremland. "Did they
want to makes no difference to
me. Whether the attempt was so
phisticated or superficial, anyone
who tries to kill himself needs
help."
But the main problem is not
AFTER a person has tried sui
cide; it is before. As Chaplain
Minto says: "We are anxious to
meet people when they first feel
problems. These don't necessarily
have to lie great problems; more
confusions than problems. But
we want to see the students
early."
Stanford has the facilities for
personal counseling for counsel
ing skillfully and confidentially.
These facilities are there free of
charge. They were there before
eight people tried suicide this
year. They are there to be used.

middle.
lie also noted what seems to be
a trend in student problems.
There arc more of them in Ihe
spring than during any other
quarter. This coincides with the
greater number of attempted sui
cides during this quarter.
Though it is difficult to speak
of an average when dealing with
so small a number as this, so far
Stanford suicide attempts are
running slightly above normal
this year.
The most specialized help, how
ever, comes from the two psychi
atrists who regularly see Stan
ford students —Dr. Shepard and
Dr. Oremland.
In both January and February

Shepard saw 41 Stanford stu
dents. Oremland camc to Palo
Alto the Monday after tho Cordry
murder and saw between 10 and
15 people in lire two weeks until
the end of the quarter.
Oremland is a graduate of the
Stanford Medical School, and on
his assignment with the Palo Alto
Clinic he devotes from one-half
to one-third of his time to student
cases.
It is difficult to estimate the
yearly number of Stanford stu
dents who take advantage of the
facilities offered for emotional
counseling.

In any case, the number is
much larger than might first be
supposed. But this is not a prob
lem of numbers. Primarily it is
an individual matter, and the fa
cilities for meeting personal prob
lems confidentially and profes
sionally right here in the Stan
ford area are extensive.
And all this help is free. Even
formal psychiatric counseling is
covered under tho Health Service.
The problem of suicide is a dra
matic one and of particular rele
vance to this campus.
"There is no distinction between
suicide attempts and suicides,"
says Dr. Jackson. "It is bringing
notice to oneself. It is a cry for
help."
"Ordinarily the seriousness of
the attempt is not important,"
says Dr. Oremland. "Did they
want to makes no difference to
me. Whether the attempt was so
phisticated or superficial, anyone
who tries to kill himself needs
help."
But the main problem is not
AFTER a person has tried sui
cide; it is before. As Chaplain
Minto says: "We are anxious to
meet people when they first feel
problems. These don't necessarily
have to lie great problems; more
confusions than problems. But
we want to see the students
early."
Stanford has the facilities for
personal counseling for counsel
ing skillfully and confidentially.
These facilities are there free of
charge. They were there before
eight people tried suicide this
year. They are there to be used.
