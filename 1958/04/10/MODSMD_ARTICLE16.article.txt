## The 						North African Question 
### Walter Lippmann 
There is at the moment a no more thankless
assignment for an American newspaperman than
to put together his impressions of France in her
relations with North Africa. For if he takes
things as they appear to be, the conflict is ir
reconcilable and the problem of finding a solu
tion is hopeless. The crucial question for a for
eign observer is to decide how much he can
discount of what he hears, how much he can dare
to think that there is a compulsion in events
which will override opinions.
The situation in its elemental form consists of
a guerrilla war in Algeria with which the bulk
of the French army is involved. It is a war which
almost certainly cannot be won and which in
military terms will surely not be lost. The public
life of metropolitan France is dominated, indeed
obsessed, by this horrid, cruel, indecisive and
interminable war. The obsession has produced a
political condition in France in which no govern
ment believes it can survive if it considers a nego
tiated settlement. All this has reached a point
where there is the gravest doubt as to whether
the legal government in Paris really controls the
whole of the army or its own appointed officials
dealing with Algeria in Paris and in North Africa.
The political climate in North Africa, as I saw
il in Tunisia, is verging on desperation. Presi
dent Bourguiba, who certainly is the most mod
erate and the mo-st Western of Arab leaders, be
lieves that if there is no settlement of the Al
gerian war in the near future, he may be over
whelmed and destroyed by a fanaticism which
follows Nasser. Tunisia, having no army to
speak of. is incapable of policing its long frontier
with Algeria. But even if Tunisia could be neu
tral, it would not dare to be, so great is the soli
darity of the Arabs.
The political climate in Paris is oppressive. It
reminded me of Washington in the heyday of
McCarthy, when man after man in high place
would deplore the terror privately and appease it
publicly. Under the French version of McCarthy
ism anyone who disagrees publicly with the offi
cial policy as administered in Algiers has a good
chance of being called a traitor. It resembles the
lime when to express doubt about Chiang Kai
shek was for an American politician like express
ing doubt about the United States. There is,
moreover, in France an admixture of race feeling
so that a political advocate of negotiations in
Algeria is rather like a white man in Little Rock
advocating integration in the public schools.

This is a dark picture, as I have painted it, but
I have tried not to exaggerate, and I have re
frained from putting into it the anguished pre
dictions of dictatorship and civil war which are
current in Paris. As a matter of fact, having
gotten out of the atmosphere of Paris, I find
myself feeling— not, I think, through any con

genital optimism—that events may not follow
the horrid logic of the apparent situation.
For one thing, though the war cannot now be
settled by a negotiated arrangement, it is not
unlikely, I think, that in fact an arrangement will
develop. The essence of the Algerian question is
that there are two communities —one white ami
European, and one dark and Moslem —living on
the same land. The Europeans are in a minority
and, with the growth of the Moslem population,
will become an ever smaller minority. Vet the
Europeans are the stronger and richer commu
nity, and they have powerful support from the
French homeland.
A "democratic" solution is impossible with this
French community outnumbered eight to one.
Therefore, it looks as if the French will be driven
to do in Algeria what was done in Ireland, in
Palestine, in India—what has been done so often
where there are two communities which cannot
be integrated and cannot rule themselves as one
nation. There will be in fact, though perhaps not
in name, a partition of Algeria, with the French
congregating in the coastal regions and the Mos
lem's in the hinterland. In all probability, this
will not be peace in the sense that there will be
more violence, but it may mean a barely tolerable
arrangement.
•» * *
For another thing, there will appear—in fact,
there is already appearing—a powerful counter
acting force to the movement for independence
in the colonial countries. The North African ter
ritories, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, are not
capable of economic independence. They are to
an extraordinary degree integrated with and de
pendent upon the subventions and the protective
devices of the French economy. There are French
interests which profit by the system. But for the
French nation as a whole, the North African
territories are not an asset but a heavy liability.
In the modern world, moreover, the advanced
states are increasingly capable of using for them
selves their own capital savings. The incentive
to export capita] is decreasing, and it tends 1o
become, except in special cases like oil. a matter
not of profit but of benevolence and of public
policy.
Parenthetically, the American capacity to ab
sorb capital at home is the underlying reason
why foreign aid is becoming increasingly un
popular in the United States.
The moral for North Africa—indeed for most,
if not all, former colonial territories -is that as
they win their political independence they will
find that it has become very hard indeed to
satisfy their needs for capital. In Ihe king run,
they will probably find that not Russia alone,
not even Russia and the Western countries com
bined, will supply enough capital to provide them
with the material base of complete independence.

if not all, former colonial territories -is that as
they win their political independence they will
find that it has become very hard indeed to
satisfy their needs for capital. In Ihe king run,
they will probably find that not Russia alone,
not even Russia and the Western countries com
bined, will supply enough capital to provide them
with the material base of complete independence.

There is at the moment a no more thankless
assignment for an American newspaperman than
to put together his impressions of France in her
relations with North Africa. For if he takes
things as they appear to be, the conflict is ir
reconcilable and the problem of finding a solu
tion is hopeless. The crucial question for a for
eign observer is to decide how much he can
discount of what he hears, how much he can dare
to think that there is a compulsion in events
which will override opinions.
The situation in its elemental form consists of
a guerrilla war in Algeria with which the bulk
of the French army is involved. It is a war which
almost certainly cannot be won and which in
military terms will surely not be lost. The public
life of metropolitan France is dominated, indeed
obsessed, by this horrid, cruel, indecisive and
interminable war. The obsession has produced a
political condition in France in which no govern
ment believes it can survive if it considers a nego
tiated settlement. All this has reached a point
where there is the gravest doubt as to whether
the legal government in Paris really controls the
whole of the army or its own appointed officials
dealing with Algeria in Paris and in North Africa.
The political climate in North Africa, as I saw
il in Tunisia, is verging on desperation. Presi
dent Bourguiba, who certainly is the most mod
erate and the mo-st Western of Arab leaders, be
lieves that if there is no settlement of the Al
gerian war in the near future, he may be over
whelmed and destroyed by a fanaticism which
follows Nasser. Tunisia, having no army to
speak of. is incapable of policing its long frontier
with Algeria. But even if Tunisia could be neu
tral, it would not dare to be, so great is the soli
darity of the Arabs.
The political climate in Paris is oppressive. It
reminded me of Washington in the heyday of
McCarthy, when man after man in high place
would deplore the terror privately and appease it
publicly. Under the French version of McCarthy
ism anyone who disagrees publicly with the offi
cial policy as administered in Algiers has a good
chance of being called a traitor. It resembles the
lime when to express doubt about Chiang Kai
shek was for an American politician like express
ing doubt about the United States. There is,
moreover, in France an admixture of race feeling
so that a political advocate of negotiations in
Algeria is rather like a white man in Little Rock
advocating integration in the public schools.

This is a dark picture, as I have painted it, but
I have tried not to exaggerate, and I have re
frained from putting into it the anguished pre
dictions of dictatorship and civil war which are
current in Paris. As a matter of fact, having
gotten out of the atmosphere of Paris, I find
myself feeling— not, I think, through any con

genital optimism—that events may not follow
the horrid logic of the apparent situation.
For one thing, though the war cannot now be
settled by a negotiated arrangement, it is not
unlikely, I think, that in fact an arrangement will
develop. The essence of the Algerian question is
that there are two communities —one white ami
European, and one dark and Moslem —living on
the same land. The Europeans are in a minority
and, with the growth of the Moslem population,
will become an ever smaller minority. Vet the
Europeans are the stronger and richer commu
nity, and they have powerful support from the
French homeland.
A "democratic" solution is impossible with this
French community outnumbered eight to one.
Therefore, it looks as if the French will be driven
to do in Algeria what was done in Ireland, in
Palestine, in India—what has been done so often
where there are two communities which cannot
be integrated and cannot rule themselves as one
nation. There will be in fact, though perhaps not
in name, a partition of Algeria, with the French
congregating in the coastal regions and the Mos
lem's in the hinterland. In all probability, this
will not be peace in the sense that there will be
more violence, but it may mean a barely tolerable
arrangement.
•» * *
For another thing, there will appear—in fact,
there is already appearing—a powerful counter
acting force to the movement for independence
in the colonial countries. The North African ter
ritories, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, are not
capable of economic independence. They are to
an extraordinary degree integrated with and de
pendent upon the subventions and the protective
devices of the French economy. There are French
interests which profit by the system. But for the
French nation as a whole, the North African
territories are not an asset but a heavy liability.
In the modern world, moreover, the advanced
states are increasingly capable of using for them
selves their own capital savings. The incentive
to export capita] is decreasing, and it tends 1o
become, except in special cases like oil. a matter
not of profit but of benevolence and of public
policy.
Parenthetically, the American capacity to ab
sorb capital at home is the underlying reason
why foreign aid is becoming increasingly un
popular in the United States.

There is at the moment a no more thankless
assignment for an American newspaperman than
to put together his impressions of France in her
relations with North Africa. For if he takes
things as they appear to be, the conflict is ir
reconcilable and the problem of finding a solu
tion is hopeless. The crucial question for a for
eign observer is to decide how much he can
discount of what he hears, how much he can dare
to think that there is a compulsion in events
which will override opinions.
The situation in its elemental form consists of
a guerrilla war in Algeria with which the bulk
of the French army is involved. It is a war which
almost certainly cannot be won and which in
military terms will surely not be lost. The public
life of metropolitan France is dominated, indeed
obsessed, by this horrid, cruel, indecisive and
interminable war. The obsession has produced a
political condition in France in which no govern
ment believes it can survive if it considers a nego
tiated settlement. All this has reached a point
where there is the gravest doubt as to whether
the legal government in Paris really controls the
whole of the army or its own appointed officials
dealing with Algeria in Paris and in North Africa.
The political climate in North Africa, as I saw
il in Tunisia, is verging on desperation. Presi
dent Bourguiba, who certainly is the most mod
erate and the mo-st Western of Arab leaders, be
lieves that if there is no settlement of the Al
gerian war in the near future, he may be over
whelmed and destroyed by a fanaticism which
follows Nasser. Tunisia, having no army to
speak of. is incapable of policing its long frontier
with Algeria. But even if Tunisia could be neu
tral, it would not dare to be, so great is the soli
darity of the Arabs.
The political climate in Paris is oppressive. It
reminded me of Washington in the heyday of
McCarthy, when man after man in high place
would deplore the terror privately and appease it
publicly. Under the French version of McCarthy
ism anyone who disagrees publicly with the offi
cial policy as administered in Algiers has a good
chance of being called a traitor. It resembles the
lime when to express doubt about Chiang Kai
shek was for an American politician like express
ing doubt about the United States. There is,
moreover, in France an admixture of race feeling
so that a political advocate of negotiations in
Algeria is rather like a white man in Little Rock
advocating integration in the public schools.

This is a dark picture, as I have painted it, but
I have tried not to exaggerate, and I have re
frained from putting into it the anguished pre
dictions of dictatorship and civil war which are
current in Paris. As a matter of fact, having
gotten out of the atmosphere of Paris, I find
myself feeling— not, I think, through any con

genital optimism—that events may not follow
the horrid logic of the apparent situation.
For one thing, though the war cannot now be
settled by a negotiated arrangement, it is not
unlikely, I think, that in fact an arrangement will
develop. The essence of the Algerian question is
that there are two communities —one white ami
European, and one dark and Moslem —living on
the same land. The Europeans are in a minority
and, with the growth of the Moslem population,
will become an ever smaller minority. Vet the
Europeans are the stronger and richer commu
nity, and they have powerful support from the
French homeland.
A "democratic" solution is impossible with this
French community outnumbered eight to one.
Therefore, it looks as if the French will be driven
to do in Algeria what was done in Ireland, in
Palestine, in India—what has been done so often
where there are two communities which cannot
be integrated and cannot rule themselves as one
nation. There will be in fact, though perhaps not
in name, a partition of Algeria, with the French
congregating in the coastal regions and the Mos
lem's in the hinterland. In all probability, this
will not be peace in the sense that there will be
more violence, but it may mean a barely tolerable
arrangement.
•» * *
For another thing, there will appear—in fact,
there is already appearing—a powerful counter
acting force to the movement for independence
in the colonial countries. The North African ter
ritories, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, are not
capable of economic independence. They are to
an extraordinary degree integrated with and de
pendent upon the subventions and the protective
devices of the French economy. There are French
interests which profit by the system. But for the
French nation as a whole, the North African
territories are not an asset but a heavy liability.

states are increasingly capable of using for them
