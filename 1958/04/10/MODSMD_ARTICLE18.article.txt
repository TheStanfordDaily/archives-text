News writer Ray Dangel suggests that the United
States adopt phonelic spelling. Says he:
"Woodent it bee grate if sumbudee wood dreem
up a noo langwidge, spokn and ritn az it sowndz?
It shurlee wood make thing/, eezier for sumbudy
frum a forun nashun whoo tryz too lern Inglish.
. . . Thing/ wood hee'beter al arownd, if each
leter had onlee wun sownd. . . . But it seem/ az
if nobudee will ugree too this alterashun, so I wil
take my thots elseware too mor xeptubul feeldz
uv mentul ndever."
May seem "grate" to you, Mr. Dangel, but I
had a herk of a time trying to copy it.
Speaking of Ihe Bookstore- which an editorial
calmly sliced the other day—UCLA seems to have
even bigger problems than Stanford. According
to the Daily Bruin, the UCLA book department
sells more books than any other student store in
the United States. A special staff of 200 students
works there during the first three days of school,
when the rush for books is at its peak. This num
ber later declines to a modest 80. they add.
Serving approximately 40,000 students enrolled
in extension courses, as well as the regular-ses
sion undergraduates, the store's main trouble, as
with our own, is lack of space. "Conditions are
very crowded in proportion to the volume of busi
ness we do, but this situation will be alleviated
when the student union is built," commented the
manager of the student store.
I say Charlie Brown might take advantage of
this plan in our forthcoming new, spacious stu
dent union??? Ilmmmm?

Quotes columnist Nancy Conneighton in Spring
Times, College of St. Mary of the Springs: "Com
mittees are composed of the unaware, appointed
by the unwilling, to do the unpleasant."
Astute observation, Nancy.
Two University of Michigan students are
among the first persons selected to represent the
United States in a history-making student ex
change with the Soviet Union, reports the Michi
gan Daily. The two, one a graduate student, the
other a junior, are both well acquainted with Rus
sian history and language. The program, organ
ized by the Council on Student Travel, has been
in the planning stage three years. It materialized
two months ago when the Soviet Union, prompted
by the United States' relaxation of immigration
rules, agreed to allow reciprocal exchanges of
students.
Congratulations and informative journey, men!

Classified ad: "Young man transferring from
Engineering to English major would like to trade
good slide rule for a good mattress."

From the Oredigger, Colorado School of Mines,
comes this name for a party: the "Flunk and
Forget Dance."
I approve.

One should take this comment with a grain of
salt, but it was much too good not to print, and
it appeared in the Bulldog of the University of
Redlands:
"Highlight of the social week, Sorority Monday
Night, brought many women out attired in the
daring chemise or sacque dresses. As one man
quipped, 'I don't know why the tomatoes want
to look so much like potatoes.' "
#
The Redlands Facts commented that "the new
commander of the Army's missile research pro
gram is a left-handed banjo player. Well, we've
tried everything else."
Them's fighting words, people.

Said of a "gung-ho" fellow: "He's so busy try

Ouch!

Said Prof. G. O. B. Davies of the University of
British Columbia: "Our educational system is
failing in one of its most important jobs—to teach
the student how to THINK. If 90 per cent of the
students were ever called upon to use the wit and
ingenuity of the average madam, they would be
bankrupt within the week."
How bad is that?

Bitter alum from Cathy Ferguson of the San
Jose State Spectator: 44 1This| is a period of try
ing to be civilized at the expense of civilization.
Conformity | makes | the world go round. Every
one must be alike in dress, skin color and thought.
The American college student, with his snappy
button-down shirts, stands on his fraternity house
steps and shouts, 'Equality of man!' But he does
nothing but shout.
"How can he? He rarely reads the paper, thinks
Jayne Mansfield the ideal wife, feels he is God's
gift and makes no decisions which would tax his
mind. For him, the world consists of coffee
breaks, women, small talk, Playboy and his favo
rite indoor sport—chug-a-lugging."
Good grief, Cathy! Get up on the wrong side
of bed?

The latest from the University of Alaska Polar
Star: "Once a young college female wrote the
editor of a correspondence column: 'I am only 19
and I stayed out 'til two the other night. My
mother objects. Did I do wrong?'
"Answer: 'Try to remember.' "
