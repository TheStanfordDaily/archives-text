# Ike Rules Out Tax Cut Now; Calls Buying Solution to Slump
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)—President
Eisenhower offered the Ameri
can people today a one-word anti
recession formula: "Buy!"
Buy what?
"Anything," Eistenhower said.
At the same time, the Presi
dent again ruled out any imme
diate, emergency tax cut.
Eisenhower offered his advice
on buying, later qualified a bit,
at a news conference at which he
also:
• Took a strong, fighting stance
for his program to reorganize the
Pentagon and place more author
ity over strategy and finances in
the hands of Secretary of Defense
McElroy. He labeled as senseless
complaints from some members
of Congress that the plan would
create a czar.
• Promised that he would con

sider a halt to America's nuclear
weapons tests if the forthcoming
shots in the Pacific produce
enough information to satisfy his
scientific advisers.
But it was on the pressing pr ob
lem of the business slump at
home that the conference bore
down from the outset. The first
question sought Eisenhower's
thinking about a tax reduction
in the light of current economic
conditions and Tuesday's govern
ment announcement lhat unem
ployment rose about 23,000 in the
month which ended in mid-March
—a period in which joblessness
usually declines.
"I see no figures that bring this
thing to a critical point and re
quire a decision at the moment,"
Eisenhower replied.
The persistent increase in liv
ing costs in the face of recession,
he said, is "a thing which you
would hope would not be occur
ring." But he said he had looked
into the history of depressions
and found this was more normal
than abnormal.
It was a question as to "what
people should do to make the re
cession recede" that brought out
the suggestion to buy anything.
Then, attaching strings a mo
ment later, the President added:
"Well, I don't say you should
buy carelessly. I said to you the
other day. let's be selective in our
buying; let's take things we
need."
