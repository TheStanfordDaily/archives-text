# Sobering Hope Found For Martini Tipplers
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (/P) â€”A medi
cal researcher asserts that a
young man who became dead
drunk on 18 martinis in five
hours was sobered up in 30 min
utes with two large doses of a
potent thyroid substance.
The man was admitted to New
York City's Memorial Center
Hospital in a deep coma. Dr.
Henry J. Koch, who was asked to
take the case, administered the
drug, which assertedly snapped
the patient back to sobriety and
clear thinking.
Dr. Koch, now a member of a
private clinic at Tucson, Ariz., re
lated the incident to science writ
ers here in the course of a re
search tour sponsored by the
American Cancer Society.
The patient's response was so
good, Dr. Koch said, that it led to
a new method of treating drunk
enness and alcoholism.
The drug is a powerful stimu
lator of energy production called
triiodothyronine. It causes alco
hol-soaked cells to release energy
for normal activity. In brain cells
this activity is characterized by
electrical phenomena.
This drug can be purchased
over the counter in most states
without restriction, but in some
a prescription is required.
In the chronic alcoholic it acts
as a sedative, causing the patient

to sleep for six to eight hours.
But he wakes up without a hang
over, Dr. Koch reported.
For a laboratory test of the
drug, eight medical students
downed five martinis each in less
than an hour on empty stomach.
With the first drink each was
given a large dose of triiodothy
ronine. They showed evidence of
only slight intoxication lasting
one to three hours and had no ad
verse effects, Dr. Koch said.
In ordinary cases of too much
to drink the drug assertedly pre
vents hangovers. It produced
rapid recovery from delirium tre
mens in three patients and helped
others with alcoholic cirrhosis of
the liver, Dr. Koch said. How
ever, he added, it is not a cure
for alcoholism.
Triiodothyronine acts like the
thyroid hormone but it is many
times more effective than the or
dinary form of that drug. A
large dose is 400 milligrams but
as much as 1000 milligrams or 1
gram can be given safely in most
cases, Dr. Koch said. However, it
would not be administered to peo
ple who have periods of rapidly
beating hearts or those with fi
brillation of the heart muscle, he
added.
