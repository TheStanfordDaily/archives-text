# Ruggers Out to End Loss Skein
## 
### 
RUGBV
The Stanford ruggers will try to end a
three-game losing streak when they travel
to Berkeley Saturday to meet a strong Cali
fornia team that inflicted the first defeat
of this string on them.
Alter going through six games without
a defeat, Stanford has lost to California,
the Wallabies of Australia and the Olympic
Club of San Francisco. However, the strong
showing marie by the local ruggers in the
Wallaby game leaves a strong note of opti
mism, since Stanford hold up better against
this international rugby power than the
other local teams.
Noel Robinson and Bob Peterson, both
all-star team selections, will lead a scrum
into action that outroughed the Australians
even if they did not outskill them. Cali
fornia, however, will be prepared to match
1 his scrum with one of their own that is
made up of proven experience and ability.
Powerful Scrum
Steve Glagola, Ron Currie, John English,

Dick Moneymaker, Frank Mattarocci, Tom
Fraser, Mike White and John Harrison are
the powerful scrum members ol the Cali
fornia Bears.
Harrison bears particular watching as
he has gained tremendous experience in his
homeland of Australia. In the first game,
which Stanford lost, Harrison fouled up tho
Indian backfield by pulling what is known
In the trade as the "dumb kick" most effec
tively.
A "dumb kick" is pulled by kicking a low
rolling ball away from the fullback and
then rushing down quickly 1o tie up Ihe
fullback before he has a chance to play the
ball.
Rugby Preferred
Frank Mattarocci is the captain of the
Bears. Well known for his line-backing in
football, Frank puts the same drive into his
rugby play and claims to like rugby better
than football since he believes there is
more fun present in this game and less
pressure.

California will counter with a backfield
that has loss ability than their scrum but is
willing to take chances and try new plays
in almost every game. John Elworthy and
Pat Vincent, an Australian, are the leaders
of the backfield attack. Tom Trutner is a
very fine fullback and kicker, but is a doubt
ful starter Saturday because of an injury.
Stanford has a backfield that can match
the Bears if it will watch its passes and try
some cut back plays in order to foul up the
Bear defense. Except for two bad passes
in the second half of the Wallaby game, the
Indians held their own.
Dave Scholz will lead a backfield made
up of Dennis Cutshaw, Bob Parks, Jim
Honeywell and Trev Grimm. Rick McMil
len, who last quarter was running track,
will strengthen the running attack. He was
a starter as a freshman and this experience
plus speed will greatly help the attack.
The California Rugby Union will enter
tain the Stanford Rugby Union after the
game.
