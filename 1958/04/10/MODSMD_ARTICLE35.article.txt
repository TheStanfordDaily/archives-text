# Stanford Netmen Ready For Rough L.A. Weekend
## 
### John Schwarz 
This week end Coach Bob Ren
ker's Indian tennis team will meet
up willi one of the toughest as
signments any college club will
face this year, The Indians will
meet UCLA and IJSC, ranked by
many as (he two top tennis teams
in the nation, on successive days.
Tomorrow afternoon the varsi
ty netters take on one of UCLA's
strongest teams in history. This
same UCLA team, with all the
same players back, trimmed the
Cards in two matches last year,
by 8-1 and 9-0 scores, and will be
the favorite tomorrow.
This year's Stanford squad is
greatly improved over last year's,
and figures to give the Bruins a
real struggle. Stanford will send
seven men to Los Angeles: Jack
Douglas, Brooks Rawlins, Dave
Nelson, Lowell Carruth, Jim Jef
fries, Gil White and Robin Ililge
man.
Douglas Vs. Franks
The •singles matches tomorrow
should prove to be top contests.
Stanford's No. 1 man, Jack Doug
las, will have his hands full when
he meets UCLA's Mike Franks.
Douglas and Franks have been
dueling for many years through
the California tennis circuits.
Franks recently whipped USC's
Ai Olmedo to win the Southern
California Intercollegiate champi
onship and lias been playing con
sistently good tennis all spring.
Douglas has been beating every
body-and-his-brother this spring,
including such top netters as Gil
Shea and Whitney Reed, and the
match should have added interest
in that Douglas is Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate champ, thus
setting up a north-south champi
onship match.
Other Singles
After first singles will come
Stanford's Rawlins against Davis
cupper Mike Green in the second
singles, Nelson against the Bru
ins' John Cranston in the three
spot. Carruth playing former Na
tional Boys' champion John Lesch
in the No, 4 position, Jeffries
squaring off against UCLA's fifth
man, Frank Johnson, and either
Hilgeman or White meeting Dale
Rohland in the sixth singles
match.
Most observers feel that if
Stanford is going to whip the
Bruins they will have to get wins
out of the last two singles men
and two of the three doubles com
binations. Along with this they
figure on Douglas defeating
Franks, but feel that Stanford's
chances of winning in either the
second, third or fourth singles
slots are very dim.
Doubles Pairings
Tn doubles, where Stanford will
be looking for at least two wins,
Coach Renker will send out Raw
lins and Douglas, Carruth and
Nelson, and a team made up of
two of the three remaining play
ers White, Hilgeman or Jeffries
in the one, two and three spots
respectively.
UCLA will use Green and
Franks in first doubles, Cranston
and Lesch in second, and Johnson
and Rohland in third.
After the Cards finish with
UCLA they move across town to
meet the USC Trojans Saturday
morning. If Stanford gains even
a split-out of the week end's play
Ihey will probably be regarded as
a definite threat to win the NCAA
championship in June. UCLA is
ineligible for the tourney, as is
USC.
