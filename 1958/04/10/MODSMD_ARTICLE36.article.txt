# Strain Names Freshman Saturday Spike Entries
## 
### 
Limiting of entries to two per school made selections difficult, but
Floyd Strain has decided whom he'll run when his freshman track
sters face Modesto and Santa Rosa JC's Saturday at 12:30 in a meet
which will run concurrently with the varsity-Fresno State dual in
the Stadium.
Jeff Beaubicr.. and Keith Wallace, probably the team's two best

runners, will'each go in just one
individual race.
Beaubier will face Modesto's
Tom Brown in the featured 880.
Beaubier has already sped to a
1:54.9 clocking this spring.
Wallace Returns
Wallace, at last apparently re
covered from a variety of ail
ments which retarded his training
program, will go in only the mile.
Bob Atkinson should break the
frosh record in the shot-put in
this his first meet. Atkinson has
been consistently over 50 feet in
workouts, and the present mark
is 49-91/4.
Strain also sees record-breaking
potential in broad-jumper and jav
elin-thrower Brooks Townsend.
He's ih the 23-foot range in the
broad jump; the present mark is
23-8 1 â€¢>.
