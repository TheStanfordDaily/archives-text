# SATURDAY SPIKEFEST
## Robinson, Agostini, Wilcox To Lead Fresno Against Indians 
### 
Fresno State may have not en
joyed much success in its meet
with California Tuesday, but it's
a cinch the Bulldog spikers will
be ready and rarin' to go Satur
day when they meet Stanford
here at 1:30.
The three top FSC men, Ancel
Robinson, Mike Agostini and Jack
Wilcox, all were beaten—and in
times far. removed from their best
efforts. As a result, Fresno lost
the meet, 85-45 1 {».
But the word from the valley is
that Fresno wasn't going all-out
in Tuesday's make-up meet —it
was originally slated for Satur
day—and that they are instead
prepping for an all-out effort
against Payton Jordan's outfit.
World Record Holder
Robinson, one of the finest hur
dlers in the world and a co-holder
ill" the world mark in the 220 lows,
will furnish the Indians' Chuck
Cobb with plenty of competition.
Robinson ran the seventh fast
est 120 high-sticks race last year
13.8 — and was listed as the
eighth best hurdler in the Track
and Field News world rankings.
Robin-son was even better in Ihe
lows, where his 22.2 was the fast
est clocking in the world by three
lent hs of a second and gave him
a tie with Dave Sime of Duke in
world record lists.
Cobb Came Rack
Robinson mastered Cobb most
of last year, but in the season's
final big meet the AAU cham
pionships the Stanford flyer ran
his best race of the year and took
third in 14.0 while Robinson could
run only 14.5 in the meet.
Robinson did all right in the
highs against Cal. winning in 14.3,

but in the low T s he was off to a
bad start in the mud and finished
third in a miserable—for him—
24 flat.
Agostini, another co-world rec
ord holder, was beaten in the 100
at Cal by Willie White in 9.7.
Agostini came back to win the
220 in 21.7, bid didn't look too
good in either race.
'57 Best —0.5
Last year Agostini couldn't do
any better than 9.5, although he
has a career best of 9.3. His best
220 time of the year, 20.4, came
against Stanford in a dual meet
at Fresno.
Wilcox has career bests of 1:•
49.9 and 4:08.9 in the 880 and the
mile, but he isn't in that sort of
shape yet this year. He ran only
the mile against the Bears and
came home second in 4:16.0, fad
ing badly in the stretch.
Pole Vault Power
The strongest Fresno event,

particularly in relation to Stan
ford strengths and weaknesses, is
probably the pole vault. They
have Bob Brodt at 14-8%, Art
Pedersen at 14-4 and Mel Kelley
at 13-6.
Their weakest spot is the broad
jump, where No. 1 man Sid Per*
rell has hit only 23 feet and no
one else is over 22.
The best of the rest of the Bull
dogs include Ilerb Turner (48.1
quarter-mile), John Foreman (9:-
15.9 two-mile), Marv Anderson
(162-4 discus throw) and Bob
Spielman (212-3 javelin throw).
