There's Room for Everything
j ™
For want of something better to do the other day I stopped tr
Ihink of possible uses for Stanford Stadium. I must agree that thi?
is probably not the most useful way to spend one's time, but when
you consider that tiie San Francisco Forty-Niners once thought of
playing here, and that the Los Angeles- Dodgers are playing in a
football stadium, and also the fact that the Stanford ROTC unit*
use the Sfiidium once each year for a dress parade wofl, then it
becomes less than foolish. After all, you can do more than play foot
ball in a stadium.
And as my thoughts ambled on I came upon the most interesting
idea that has ever been proposed let's turn the Stadium into a race
track in its off-season. Or, rather, let's make an off-season so that
we can turn it into a track.
Now I'll grant you that at first this seems like a foolish idea, but
when you think about it long enough it becomes almost interesting.
Almost, that is!
Can't you just see large neon signs above the Stadium proclaim
ing the opening of "Indian Meadows"? Or would it be better to
call it "( actus Gardens"? most appropriate, to be sure. But then
we can't leave out the possibility of "Tribe Track."
Hollywood Park has its famous slogan, "the track of the lakes
and flowers"; well, Stanford could have its own, too. llow about "the
track of the steaks and plowers"? And what racing fan doesn't know
of Del .Ylitr's famous "where the turf meets the surf"? Again, a
Stanford track goes them one better with "where the stud meets the
mud."
Before going further maybe we should check into the possibilities
of objection to the plan. It seems unlikely that Palo Alto residents
would complain because a track in this area would certainly be a
boon on the local businessmen, and if not to them, certainly to the
phone company. Why there's even a plan under foot in San Fran
cisco now to try to move the Giants closer to the center of town.
II is possible that the Stanford football and track teams might
raise objections. It seems senseless for the fool ball team to raise
one. After all, they play in the middle of the field and the horses
run around the outside. There's just no chance for contact. And
besides this would be one of the values of the track. On a given
Saturday when the grid and racing schedules are still going on it
will be the only attraction in the country where such an exciting
double bill is being offered.
Now it is conceivable that the trackmen will not have their
charge answered so easily, but I think it will be possible to schedule
the track events so that they and the races are staggered. And no
one can say that that won't make a full day of activity in the
Stadium.
Cashiers at All Four Corners
It naturally goes witout saying that the institution of a race track
on campus will make many profound changes on the otherwise placid
campus scene. For instance, a gigantic tote board running the
length of Hoover Tower would be a welcome sight now, wouldn't it?
And not only welcome, but necessary so that bets could bo placed
from booths located all over Quad- and naturally "at the four cor
ners" of that four-sided place.
And naturally there'd be a change in the time schedule. Under
the Physical Education Department's equestrian classes the follow
ing will no doubt become a mandatory admission: "Equestrian 100 —
Jockeying as a Profession —Arearo —MF 10, Stable."
But the greatest change to be noted will be in the increase of
revenue. Those who are now working their way through college
would surely welcome the change for it's well known that ticket
sellers and cashiers make a handsome sum. And there'd be many
of these jobs open. When they run out. however, all is not lost, for
no track can long exist without food and drink stands and a new
company, Cardinal Concessions, would also have many positions
open.
Surely this Stanford site is not without color and beautiful set
ting. The foothills will make an attractive backdrop, and for color
within the Stadium —er, track we can always have Prince Lightfoot
to do dances between races. After all, Hollywood Park has a Goose
Girl swans, and Iliaicah, in Florida, even has a rare breed of cranes,
or cockatoos, or something.
And the local atmospere will lend itself to race names without a
doubt. Early in the season a natural feature would be the "Winter
Drives Futurity," to be followed by such other notable races as the
"Phi Beta Kappa Stakes" and the "Tuition Allowance."
Each class gets one nod in the racing program with events such
as a "Frosh Futurity" which features one-year-olds, and so on, in
age, up to the "Senior Sweepstakes" no doubt for four-year-olds
who are madly racing to keep from the local glue or bubble gum
factories.
Oops another problem. Just happened to think that the Stadium
track is only one-quarter mile long. Now it seems that a race track
should l)e a bit longer to be effective. Well, on second thought, may
he it won't have to be. It might be a little exasperating on Ihe horses
n> have them run around it four times, but it sure would be exciting
to ihe spectators.
I'd think of knocking out the end of the stadium to enlarge the
track if I didn'l want, to carry out this project with as little physical
change as possible to Ihe structure. So I guess the best solution is
to have them run all races in a sort of reverse order so that they
can finish on the long straightaway at the end.
And I refuse to believe that this will be a diminishing factor in
spectator enthusiasm. Think of the suspense involved until the win
ners are posted.
What I like most about the whole idea is the simple fact that
Indian Meadows or Cactus Gardens—would be the only track in
many a mile with seats surrounding the entire racing area, and I
feel sure that this must have some advantage.
Now that this weight is off my mind, maybe I can get back to
sleep without that nightmare coming on again. Guess I'll try.
