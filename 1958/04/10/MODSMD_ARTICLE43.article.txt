n the freshman opener yester
day.
Russell gave up only three hits,
'nit one was a home run to the

The highlight of the game came
in the eighth inning. Mike Filice
walked; then pinch - hitter Mike
Bertolet picked one of Bellarmine
relief pitcher Dan Corbel's throws
and powered it past the tennis
courts in right fielrl for a home
run.
The remaining frosh runs came
in the fourth, fifth and sixth in
nings, with Filice and Lee Moench
each getting a RBI and the last
run scoring on a balk by Bells
starter John Blum.
Second-baseman Eric Blitz led
the freshman hitting with two
hits and a walk in five at bats.
John Simmons, Bill Jenson and
Filice each singled once to round
out the freshman hitting.
