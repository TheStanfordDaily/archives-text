# Card 9 in Busy Weekend
## 
### 
Stanford goes back to the base
ball wars tomorrow and Saturday
in three early-season CIBA mi
cials. The Cards, playing five
games in six days- four of them
CIBA battles— will meet Santa
Clara tomorrow in Santa Clara
and will host Southern California
Saturday in a 1 p.m. double-head
er in the Sunken Diamond.
The Indians will go into the
three-game week end leading the
league with a 3-0 mark. But USC
is right behind with a 2-0 record.
And Santa Clara won't be any
soft touch, as evidenced by their
2-1 thriller with the Indians last
Monday.
The club's leading hitter going
into the busy week end is third
baseman Jim Burk . He pulled his
average up against Santa Clara
and Camp Pendleton and is now

rapping tho ball at an oven .333
clip.
Stanford has j us t two other
regulars hitting over .300—Ralph
Molding and Ben Robinson. Nei
ther of them enjoyed much suc
cess during the early part of the
week, and their averages slipped
to .308 and .306 respectively.
Batting marks for the rest of
the men who have been up 40 or
more times are .279 for Joel New
kirk and Rich DeFabio, .273 for
Parker Olsen, .261 for Wayne Ma
rion and .245 for A 1 Shaw.
Robinson loads the team in
RBl's with 10, but DeFabio and
Shaw each have nine and Holding
has eight. Robinson is also the
leader in home runs and hits.
He cracked a pair of four-bag
gers in the early stages of the
season, but that's been it so far as
home runs are concerned. Robin
son also has 15 hits one more
than Burk.
Biggest paradox in the statis
tics is in the runs-scored depart
ment, where Shaw leads with 14

despite having the lowest average
among tlie regulars. Oddly
enough, Holding and Burk, the
two top hitters, have each scored
just three times.
Robinson and Shaw are the club
leaders in other extra-base depart
ments. Robinson has four dou
bles, one more than Burk; and
Shaw has three triples, two more
than Holding.
In the pitching department Bob
Leopold is the big man. He has
an excellent 1.20 ERA and has
rolled up 42 strikeouts in 415 in
nings. He's won four and lost one.
Lefty Dick Williams has the
only perfect record, 4-0, and has
a 2.04 ERA. Williams lias struck
out a man per inning for 22
frames.
Both Leopold and Williams
have yielded an average of about
four walks per nine innings. The
other major hurlers, George Av
ery and Wally Miller, each have
compiled 1-1 records. Their ERA's
are 2.2.1 and 3.04 respectively.
