# REVOLT
## Cuba Rebels Stage Strike; Nine Killed 
### 
HAVANA, Cuba (/P> â€” Cuba's
armed forces crushed a rebel up
rising in Havana yesterday and
beat down an attempted general
strike. The rebel stroke proved
to be bold but feeble.
The government of President
Fulgencio Batista said eight reb
els and one policeman were killed
and three policemen wounded in
fighting centered at the port dis
trict of Old Havana.
Rebels sei/ed and briefly held
Cuba's biggest radio and TV sta
tions in Havana and played pre
pared records telling Cubans that
rebel leader Fidel Castro's threat
ened general str ike was in effect.
They gave the word for Cubans
to rise up in arms against Ba
tista.
Workers at some factories and
in the telephone, electric and gas
companies left their jobs. Com
munications and electric power
were out in sections of the city
for a time. But the strikes were
only temporary.
A government declaration said
the fighting was carried out un
der the direction of the Commu
nist Party.
It said, "The alertness of the
Republic forces and the respon
sible attitude of its citizens"
quickly smashed an attempt to
turn Havana into a battleground.
Probably not more than 100
rebels were involved in the ini
tial Havana shooting spree. Reb
el leaders known to many Cubans
returned to their hiding places.
They told friends they felt sick
that supposedly well - laid plans
for a block-to-block uprising had
gone astray.
