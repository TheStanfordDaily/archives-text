# U.S. Needs Austerity, Catholic Educator Says
## 
### 
"Religion is the most effective
means to achieve austerity," said
Father Gustave Weigel in the
first of three public addresses
yesterday afternoon at Cubberley
Auditorium.
Defining austerity as the "spir
it and willingness to do without,"
the noted educator went on to say
that the American people cannot
make a religious commitment
only to save the nation, however.
"We cannot sell religion to
bring about material and secular
prosperity; instead there must he
sincere submission to God's will."
"Euphoria"
Father Weigel also emphasized
that America must save herself
from her present way of life. He
quoted an article which appeared
in Life magazine entitled "Eupho
ria and the Scythians." "Eupho
ria" being the United States and
"Scythia" being Russia. The pur
suit of Euphoria was happiness
in the naive terms of having a
good time, while the purpose of
Scythia was world domination,
which was being achieved
through discipline. In the end,
Euphoria was defeated in battle.
The ironical feature of this par
able was the full-page liquor ad
vertisement opposite the article,
a principal example of the ab
sence of austerity at the present
time.
"Today the finest knowledge of
science is used to make the public
buy," Father Weigel said. "The
question 'Is it moral?' is never

asked. We are told that it is our
obligation to keep buying, and
we are entering into a full-bolwn
culture of luxury. The result of
this buying and consuming in ex
cess is causing us to become a
Euphoria."
Softening
An example of the softening of
the nation as a result of merely
seeking happiness which Father
Weigel cited was the study of the
American G.l.'s in the Korean
war. One-third who were cap
tured became collaborators and
38 per cent died in captivity,
while of the 229 Turks captured
none became collaborators and
none died.
"We need a change in the
stream of thinking in this coun
try, a reform of behavior. The
pioneer spirit must still be within
us in pursuing life and liberty,
not only happiness. A free people
is a people that is tense, facing
risk rather than security. The
mind of austerity must be ac
quired, and it must be achieved
by religion rather than by coer
cion."
