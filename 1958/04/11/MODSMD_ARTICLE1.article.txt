# Cards in CIBA Crucials
## 
### Jerry Wisot 
A crucial weekend is in store for the Stanford
varsity baseball team starting this afternoon
when tho league-leading nine takes on the Uni
versity of Santa Clara there and then faces the
second-place University of Southern California
in a double-header on the Sunken Diamond to
morrow afternoon at 1.
This afternoon's game will be the second meet
ing between the two clubs after the Indians
dumped the Broncos last Monday, 2-1. It is im
portant that the Cards win this one so that they
can enter the Saturday competition with at least
a half-game advantage over the dangerous Tro-
Jens.
So for, this season SC sports an 8-2 record,
being 2-0 in CIBA play. They have beaten the
Santa Clara team twice which should serve as a
good indication of their potential. In the last
seven years the Trojans have won the CIBA title
five times and tied for it twice, coming out with
a tie or win for the league championship in 11
out of the last 12 years.
In meetings between the Indians and the Tro
jans last year, SC came out on top three out of
four times, 6-3, 2-0 and 11-1. The lone win for
Stanford came on a no-hit ball game thrown by
All-CIBA pitcher Bob Leopold on the USC dia
mond in which the score was 4-0. In the 101
games the two teams have met in since 1923, SC
has won 72, Stanford 29.
The Trojans have one of their four All-CIBA
players of last year returning, first baseman
Ken Guffrey. In junior infielder Mike Castanon
they have the present league-leading hitter with
a .714 average. Sophomore center fielder Ron
Fairly, who recently turned down a $70,000
bonus contract, is rated one of the top baseball
prospects in the nation.

Stanford coach "Dutch" Fehring plans to send
right-hander George Avery against Santa Clara
this afternoon. Southpaw Bob Leopold will start
in the first game of the double-header tomorrow
and Dick Williams will go against the Trojans
in the second game.
Coach Bill Leonard of the Broncos announced
yesterday that his first-string catcher Ed Allen,
who batted in Santa Clara's one run on Monday,
will be lost for three weeks with a fractured
thumb which he incurred in that game. Joe
Tomasello will replace him in this afternoon's
tilt.
At the present time third baseman Jim Burk
is leading the Stanford club in batting with a
.333 average. He is followed by catcher Ralph
Holding with .308 and center fielder Ben Rob
inson with .306. Robinson has driven in 10 runs,
while Holding and Burk have brought eight and
seven men across the plate, respectively.
In the pitching department Leopold is the
leader with a 1.20 ERA and 42 strikeouts in 45
innings of pitching. His record of 4-1 follows
that of Williams who is unbeaten in four starts.
Williams as chalked up 22 strikeouts for the
same number of innings of pitching, allowing
2.04 runs for an average nine innings. Avery
has lost one and won one, striking out 13, and"
recording a 2.25 ERA.
Following this three-game weekend which
should have a definite effect upon the CIBA race
situation, Stanford will meet each of the two
teams twice more. In Los Angeles on May 9 and
10 they will take on the Trojans again and will
meet Santa Clara on May 23 and 24 in the last
games of the regular season.
Other CIBA games this weekend will see
Southern California against Cal this afternoon
and a double-eader between the Bears and Santa
Clara on the latter's field tomorrow afternoon.
