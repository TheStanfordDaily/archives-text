"II is absolutely clear . . . that
all Ihe Indian government wants
to do is get out of its obligation
of giving human lights to the
people of Kashmir," said Paki
stan Vice-Consul Abdul Sattar in
a speech yesterday which refuted
the Indian stand on the Kashmir
problem.
Sattar placed the main empha
sis of proof for the above state
ment on the divided religion of
the country. When Britain grant
ed the states of India their free
dom. they decided that the Mos
lem states which were being sub
jected to Hindu rulers would go
to Pakistan while the Hindu
states would remain as India.
India look over two of the states
which did not comply, and Kash
mir is the third.
Although SO per cent of the
Kashmir population was Moslem,
and according to Britain's plan
should have acceded to Pakistan,
the ruler was Hindu and "started
conspiring with India."
The question came before the
United Nations Security Council
in 1949, which decided that a
