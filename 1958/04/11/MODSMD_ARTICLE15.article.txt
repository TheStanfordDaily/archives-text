only one candidate each. No candidates at all

I he Flections Commission is "alarmed*' at
the low rale of filing, and so should everyone

Some may he secretly happy that there is so
little interest in what may seem lo them lo be
a useless, ineffectual bureaucracy. But the
powers of student government are indisputably
large and important. Any organization with
the power lo spend as much money and regu

The question is not whether the ASSU lead

candidates for ASS (J offices is hardly some
thing lo gloat ovor.
Those who scoff at the impotency of student

A |>lea for more candidates is probahly even

carry with it a great sense of satisfaction and
accomplishment for those capable of serving
well.
As voters, we hope a larger number of capa

the power lo spend as much money and regu
late student life as much as does the ASSU
and its leaders should not be shrugged off as
unimportant.
The question is not whether the ASSU lead
ers "do" anything; it is simply a question of
u/io does il. Student government will go on
forever as the failure of George Ralph two

years ago lo k<•<*p his campaign promises «112
anarchy demonstrates. Such a small choice of
candidates for ASS (J offices is hardly some
thing lo gloat ovor.
Those who scoff at the impotency of student
government might do well to look hack at some
of the things irresponsible legislators liaVe
done in the past. They have shown llie Legis
lature's [lowers for all to see—often to the great
detriment of tlx" student hodv.
A |>lea for more candidates is probahly even
more worthless than a plea lo "gel out tin*
vote." Running for office isn't any kind of a
responsibility or a duly we can admonish any
one lo live up to. It's simply an opportunity
to be of service—an opportunity which must
carry with it a great sense of satisfaction and
accomplishment for those capable of serving
well.
As voters, we hope a larger number of capa
ble students will offer their services lo us in
the coming election.
