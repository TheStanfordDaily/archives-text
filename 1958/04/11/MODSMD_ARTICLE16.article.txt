Why JSot "Peanuts" ?
Editor, Tho Daily:
Question:
Why doesn't The Daily carry "Peanuts"?
Ann Frost
Answer: We tried hard last month to get
"Peanuts,'' bul the San Francisco Chronicle,
apparently feeling tlie pinch of competition
from The Daily, refused to bend its option on
the strip for the Bay Area. —Editor
Speakers Em barrassed
Editor, The Daily:
It has often happened in the past lhat the
speaker at the "Tuesday Evening Series" is intro
duced at the beginning of his talk, but is left
standing at the end. At public meetings of this
kind Iherc is usually somebody who thanks the
speaker for an interesting talk.
This evening we were shown a disgraceful ex
ample of how uncomfortable it is for the speaker
to finish off the evening by himself. Sir Charles
Snow was obviously expecting somebody to fin
ish off ihe proceedings for him.
I suggest that the Committee on Public Exer
icsos ensure that'future speakers are saved this
embarrassment.

Endless Droning
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Ilymans' letter in Friday's Daily called
attention to the graduation ceremonies at a very
opportune time, for several seniors have been
contemplating ways to improve our graduation.
The aspect of sitting through the endless droning
of names and meaningless speeches merely for
the sake of ceremony is at best gruesome. There
has been a great deal of discontent with the
Speakers at past graduations. Many have consid
ered the speeches long, dull, too specific, or too

general. This does NOT speak ill of the idea of
having a speaker, but rather of the choices made
in the past. No one seems to have taken the time
or trouble to select and then to bring really good
speakers to Stanford for graduation. This can be
corrected, and I for one think that it should be.
The Class of 3958 entered the University to the
strains of the Alma Mater, yells and routine
speeches by Administration officials in Frost
Amphitheater. This hardly seems the proper in
troduction to a university. I hope that our gradu
ation will not resemble THAT ceremony; instead
I hope to hear a man of some stature presenting
me with challenging ideas. If this is not the case,
then the time spent at graduation is wasted.

No Tax on Teachers
Editor, The Daily:
All agree—more and better teachers we must
have. How? Simple—more money, more respect,
more prestige for the teaching profession. To
reach that goal, however, will require new, hold,
imaginative thinking.
Here is an explosive, effective idea: Have Con
gress amend the income tax laws to read, "No
income tax shall be collected on any teaching
salaiy."
I can think of no other single action that would
so shock our present state of vacillating do
nothing-ness into an acute awareness of what
education means today in the defense of our
country.
Favoritism? Of course! How else can we so
quickly demonstrate that today teaching and
teachers are. or should be, a class apart—the
shock troops who will lead us to victory or defeat
in that modern arena of conflict, the classroom?
Education (as the Soviet Union has so helpfully
shown us) is today the greatest weapon in a
nation's foreign policy. Let's put ours in order.
