# Suicides Are Contagious

cide at Stanford.)

"An important thing to remem
ber about suicide is that the stuff
is contagious. There are batches
of it within one time and one lo
cality. This is one of the inter
relations of journalism and medi
cine, says Dr. John D. Black, head
of the Stanford Counseling and
Testing Center.
"I think you will find that the
framework we have at Stanford
for watching emotional problems
is extensive more than most stu
dents realize. We at the Health

Service believe that organic dis
ease and emotional problems are
interwoven, and we are constant
ly on the lookout for psychiatric
troubles."
The Counseling and Testing
Center is also a very convenient
source of counseling. It does
much work in the academic and
vocational testing fields, but there
are four clinical psychologists on
the staff ready for personal inter
views.
"Any person who seeks help
and is sick would not be over
looked. except through human er
ror," said Dr. Black. "He would
not be denied help because people
were too busy to talk to him. If
people are too near the breaking
point, we send them over to Dr.
Ormeland at the clinic, and they
are given whatever help is indi
cated."
The Counseling and Testing
Center sees about 1800 people a
year, and it has been estimated
that the Center sees about 50 per 1
cent of the students over a four
year period.
James B. Lyon, senior counsel
or of the Center staff, noticed the
â€¢same gambit as Dr. Houck. "Ini
tially only about one out of four
come here with emotional prob
lems. Many give trivial reasons
for coming to begin with, but
after a few interviews the true
nature of the difficulty comes
out."
Dr. Black agrees: "We see a
great many students. The rea
sons they give initially are not
the reasons they give later. It is
easy for a student to give a super
ficial reason, and only after a pri
vate conversation does he feel
safe about disclosing that he does

fool friendless, lonely, homesick,
or whatever.
"Toward the middle of a quar
ter a slackening occurs in the
scheduling of appointments, but
about the end of a quarter it gets
filled up. We try to have brief
half hour interviews as soon as a
person comes in, to insure that
anyone who needs immediate help
is not overlooked."
The Center has been operating
in its present form since the fall
of 1950. It was founded after
World War II on government
funds as the "Veterans Guidance
Center" and at that time did not
handle personal counseling. Now
it is a University-supported serv
ice.
