30th anniversary. The sixth chap
ter to be founded in the nation,
the Stanford organization has a
membership of 75 at present. Its
record of accomplishments is long
and impressive.

Drama departments.
Among A Phi O's continuous
projects is the quarterly Book
Exchange, which has increased in
volume from $500 to over $10,000

provided one ton of food-—enough
for 36,000 meals —in Germany,
Italy, India and Colombia.

The fraternity's most recent
project, according to Paul Thiess,
vice-president in charge of proj

30th Y ear
This is an especially important
year for Zeta chapter, as it is the
30th anniversary. The sixth chap
ter to be founded in the nation,
the Stanford organization has a
membership of 75 at present. Its
record of accomplishments is long
and impressive.
Since 1928 an ushering service
has been maintained to assist
campus organizations such as
Ram's Head and the Music and
Drama departments.
Among A Phi O's continuous
projects is the quarterly Book
Exchange, which has increased in
volume from $500 to over $10,000
in the 10 years of its existence.
At the beginning of every
school year A Phi O members
may be seen moving freshman
women's luggage, ushering at the
freshman movie and assisting
with Ihe freshman placement
tests.
In March the service fraternity
sent $100 to CARE. This money
provided one ton of food-—enough
for 36,000 meals —in Germany,
Italy, India and Colombia.
Bench-Painting
The fraternity's most recent
project, according to Paul Thiess,
vice-president in charge of proj
ects. is bench-painting. Benches
in Union Court and some on Inner
Quad have been painted, and the
project will be completed soon.
Also to be painted is the new In
ternational House.
Other accomplishments include
the establishment of a half-tuition
scholarship through the income
from the student-priced Time-Life
subscription fund, the lending of
financial and leadership help to
the Convalescent Home Boy Scout
