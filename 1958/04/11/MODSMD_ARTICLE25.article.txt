# Stanford Thinclads Set for Powerful Fresno
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Three now Stanford record-breakers and a pair of co-world record
holders, plus prospects of a close team battle, will feature a track
moot between the Indians and Fresno State tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium.
Stanford spike fans will have their first chance to see Norm Lloyd,

Chuck Cobb and Maury Graves
in action since the trio got their
names into the Tribe record book
with outstanding performances
during the past two weeks.
Fresno State will present Mike
Agostini, a 9.3 hundred man, and
Ancel Robinson, who sped over
the low hurdles in 22.2 last
spring.
Fan Conveniences
Like last year's battles with
USC and Occidental, it will fea
ture numerous conveniences and
ai d s for spectators, including
walkie-talkie communication from
field event areas to report latest
efforts, numbers for all runners
to facilitate identification, and in
dividual introduction of all com
petitors.
Payton Jordan's rapidly im
proving club will be slight favor
ites, chiefly on a basis of their
distance and broad-jump depth
and an anticipated high number
of place and show points.
Feature races of the day will
be the high and low hurdle duels
between Cobb and Robinson. Cobb
ran 13.9 in the high sticks last
Saturday against USC, the na
tion's fastest time of the year.
Lloyd, Graves Move Down
Lloyd and Graves will each
move down a notch in distance
after their record performances
in the mile and two-mile respec
tively. Lloyd will go in the 880,
where his chief opposition will
come from teammate Ernie Cun
liffe.
Cunliffe ran 1:51.0 against the
Trojans, missing the Stanford rec
ord in the event by one-tenth of
a second. With the added pres
sure from Lloyd, fans will be
quite likely to see the winner es
tablishing a new school record
and probably breaking 1:50 flat.
Graves in Mile
Graves will run the mile after
two weeks of excellent running
in the oight-lapper.
While Agostini is a heavy fa
vorite in both dashes, he could
receive a goo d challenge from
both Dean Smith and Norm
Pease. The two Stanford sopho
mores look better with every
workout, and the competition
from Agostini could be enough
to bring Ihcm down to the 9.7
class.
If Stanford wins, it will be its
11th win in 12 moots with Fresno.
The only FSC win came in 1942
at Fresno.

and an anticipated high number
of place and show points.
Feature races of the day will
be the high and low hurdle duels
between Cobb and Robinson. Cobb
ran 13.9 in the high sticks last
Saturday against USC, the na
tion's fastest time of the year.
Lloyd, Graves Move Down
Lloyd and Graves will each
move down a notch in distance
after their record performances
in the mile and two-mile respec
tively. Lloyd will go in the 880,
where his chief opposition will
come from teammate Ernie Cun
liffe.
Cunliffe ran 1:51.0 against the
Trojans, missing the Stanford rec
ord in the event by one-tenth of
a second. With the added pres
sure from Lloyd, fans will be
quite likely to see the winner es
tablishing a new school record
and probably breaking 1:50 flat.
Graves in Mile
Graves will run the mile after
two weeks of excellent running
in the oight-lapper.
While Agostini is a heavy fa
vorite in both dashes, he could
receive a goo d challenge from
both Dean Smith and Norm
Pease. The two Stanford sopho
mores look better with every
workout, and the competition
from Agostini could be enough
to bring Ihcm down to the 9.7
class.
If Stanford wins, it will be its
11th win in 12 moots with Fresno.
The only FSC win came in 1942
at Fresno.
Three now Stanford record-breakers and a pair of co-world record
holders, plus prospects of a close team battle, will feature a track
moot between the Indians and Fresno State tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium.
Stanford spike fans will have their first chance to see Norm Lloyd,

Chuck Cobb and Maury Graves
in action since the trio got their
names into the Tribe record book
with outstanding performances
during the past two weeks.
Fresno State will present Mike
Agostini, a 9.3 hundred man, and
Ancel Robinson, who sped over
the low hurdles in 22.2 last
spring.
Fan Conveniences
Like last year's battles with
USC and Occidental, it will fea
ture numerous conveniences and
ai d s for spectators, including
walkie-talkie communication from
field event areas to report latest
efforts, numbers for all runners
to facilitate identification, and in
dividual introduction of all com
petitors.
Payton Jordan's rapidly im
proving club will be slight favor
ites, chiefly on a basis of their
distance and broad-jump depth
and an anticipated high number
of place and show points.
