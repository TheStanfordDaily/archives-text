# Tennismen Leave for Southland
## 
### 
Stanford's netters are hound
for Los Angeles, where today
they meet the strong UCLA Bru
ins and tomorrow take on the
USC Trojans.
The Indians, who will bo under
dogs in both of their opening PCC
struggles, are in top physical
shape for the matches. All seven
of the first-liners Jack Douglas,
Brooks Rawlins, Dave Nelson, Gil
White, Lowell Carruth, Jim Jef
fries and Robin Hilgemanâ€”are in
good health and ready to play.
Better Chance with Troy
The Indians stand a stronger
chance of winning the Saturday
match against USC than their en
counter with UCLA today. The
Trojans have Alex Olmedo, the
ex-NCAA singles champion, in
their first spot, but except for
the Peruvian Olmedo, USC lacks
the deplh of UCLA.
Stanford's Douglas should
have quite a week end of tennis
in meeting both Mike Franks of
UCLA and Olmedo. Douglas holds
one win over the big SC netter,
which he gained last year in the
second Stanford-USC match, and
stands an excellent chance of
gaining another.
Olmedo Frratio
Olmedo is an extremely erratic
netter, who on some days resem
bles a junior Pancho Gonzales
and on other days has trouble
heating anyone. The Stanfordite,
on the other hand, has proved he
con play consistently top tennis
and therefore may outsteady SC's
ace.
