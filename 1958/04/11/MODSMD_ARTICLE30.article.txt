Amazing 14-year-old Los Altos
High freshman Sieve Clark has
chalked up sensational times of
1:59 for the 200-yard free style,
:59 for the 100-yard butterfly and

1:33 for the 150-yard individual
medley. He will be a definite
threat to the locals.
Twin brother Pat Mealiffe and
teammate Chuck Policy have top
times in the 100 and 200 free style
of :52 and 2:03 respectively.
Stanford's George Harrison,
having now broken two national
records in his last two starts, will
pace the locals in the 200 butter
fly and 400 free. Free-sty lots John
Jurgensen and Mike Zellor should
pull Papoose victories in their
events.
"We should boat these high
schools," commented Coach Tom
Haynie, "but iheytlo have some
fine material, so tlie 1 meet will be
no easy one to grab."
