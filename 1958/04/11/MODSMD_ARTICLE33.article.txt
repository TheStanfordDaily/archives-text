# Ruggers Take On Cal
## 
### 
The Stanford ruggers will meet
the Boars of California at Berke
ley tomorrow at 2 p.m. A junior
varsity game will follow at 3:30.
Stanford will go into the game
at full strength except for Ar
m a n d Jaques, who missed the
Wallaby game with a pulled leg
muscle. Don Peter suffered a pair
of broken ribs in the wallaby
game but played against the
Olympic Club last Saturday and
is ready to go. Doug Purcell has
a slight hip pointer, but this in

jury will not prevent him from
playing.
This game is the last of the
season, since spring football prac
tice starts in two weeks. The rug
gers have had a fairly successful
season so far, and a win against
the Bears would make the season
a real success.
