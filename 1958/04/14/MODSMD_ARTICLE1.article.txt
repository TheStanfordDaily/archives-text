# Lloyd Sets 880 Record; Cards Slip by Fresno
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Norman LJoyd broke his second Stanford record within eight days
and the Cards' mile relay team cracked an 18-year-old Stadium mark
to lead Stanford to a 66%-64 l-j victory over Fresno State here Sat
urday.
The relay quartet of Dick Lassen, Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don-

Chesarek won the meet for Stan
ford. Fresno had led by 2%
points going into the relay after
overcoming a mid-meet deficit of
more than 21 points, but the five
relay points swung the decision
to Stanford.
Lloyd moved down from the
mile to the 880, and went the two
laps in 1:50.5, the fastest time in
the nation this year and the fast
est a Stanford runner has ever
covered the distance.
Lloyd's effort cracked the old
standard of 1:50.9, which Ben
Eastman had set in 1932. Coinci
dentally, Eastman was an official
at the finish when Lloyd hit the
tape to break his mar k.
4:06 Last Week
Last week in Los Angeles,
Lloyd ran the mile in 4:06 to
erase a school record which had
stood since 1940.
Saturday, he had to run almost
as fast as he did to even win.
Ernie Cunliffe, the second-place
finisher in 1:51.3, was right with
Lloyd for the first 660. Cunliffe
led at the 220 in 26 seconds, and
was still on top at the end of the
first lap in 53.5.
Lloyd started his move coming
off the third turn, and the two
were even at the 660 in 1:21.0.
Then Lloyd started his big kick,
and pulled away to an eight-yard
lead. He faded slightly in the
final 30 yards, but Cunliffe was
too far back to challenge.
The relay victory was a tre
mendous one for the four In
dians, who covered the mile in
3:11.4 — the nation's third - best
time of the year.
Early Leads
Lassen led off with a 48.9 leg
from the blocks, and opened a 5-
yard lead. Cunliffe whipped by
in 48.0 as the lead increased by 8
more yards.
Lloyd maintained the lead over
Mike Agostini on the third leg,
and was clocked in 47.3. Chesa
rek finished in 47.2, and added
the few final yards to the win
ning margin.
The combined effort cracked
the 1940 stadium record of 3:12.9,
set by the team of Charles Shaw,
Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson
and Clyde Jeffrey. That quartet
also holds the University record
of 3:10.5.
The featured pair of hurdles
duels between Chuck Cobb and
Ancel Robinson came out a draw.
Cobb led all the way in the highs
as .Robinson clobbered the three
final hurdles, winning in a good
14.1.
Foot Behind
Then in the lows, .Robinson was
away fast and held on over fast
closing Cobb. Both men were
credited with 23.4, although Cobb
was a foot behind.
Mike Franchetti came up with
Stanford's most pleasing field
event performance when he pole
vaulted 14 feet to gain a tic for
second.
Only two men, Bud Deacon and
Tiill Miller, have done belter for
Stanford. Deacon went 14-2% in
the 1934 University champion
ships, and Miller did 14-1% in
19.'>2. Four others have done 14
feel.
Chris Plain and Jerry Winters
each came through his best corn
pet ilive mark this year in plac
ing one-two in the shot. Plain
put his first effort out to 52-1 Va,
and Winters hit the 51-914 mark.
Hansen Adds Quarter-Inch
Kent Hansen proved his 24-1%
broad jump at Ihe Texas Relays
was no fluke as he added a quar
fer-ineh to it in winning the event
Sat urday.
Agostini and Jack Wilcox, both
of Fresno, were the only double
winners. Agostini captured the
sprints in 9.7 and 21.6. Wilcox
won the mile in 4:11.2, then got
a dead heat for first in the two
mile with teammate John Fore
man.
The rest of the Stanford win
ners were Chesarek, wilh a 48.6
quarter, and Jim Backstrand,
with a .javelin Ihrow of 198-7 Mi.

ships, and Miller did 14-1% in
19.'>2. Four others have done 14
feel.
Chris Plain and Jerry Winters
each came through his best corn
pet ilive mark this year in plac
ing one-two in the shot. Plain
put his first effort out to 52-1 Va,
and Winters hit the 51-914 mark.
Hansen Adds Quarter-Inch
Kent Hansen proved his 24-1%
broad jump at Ihe Texas Relays
was no fluke as he added a quar
fer-ineh to it in winning the event
Sat urday.
Agostini and Jack Wilcox, both
of Fresno, were the only double
winners. Agostini captured the
sprints in 9.7 and 21.6. Wilcox
won the mile in 4:11.2, then got
a dead heat for first in the two
mile with teammate John Fore
man.
The rest of the Stanford win
ners were Chesarek, wilh a 48.6
quarter, and Jim Backstrand,
with a .javelin Ihrow of 198-7 Mi.
Norman LJoyd broke his second Stanford record within eight days
and the Cards' mile relay team cracked an 18-year-old Stadium mark
to lead Stanford to a 66%-64 l-j victory over Fresno State here Sat
urday.
The relay quartet of Dick Lassen, Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don-

Chesarek won the meet for Stan
ford. Fresno had led by 2%
points going into the relay after
overcoming a mid-meet deficit of
more than 21 points, but the five
relay points swung the decision
to Stanford.
Lloyd moved down from the
mile to the 880, and went the two
laps in 1:50.5, the fastest time in
the nation this year and the fast
est a Stanford runner has ever
covered the distance.
Lloyd's effort cracked the old
standard of 1:50.9, which Ben
Eastman had set in 1932. Coinci
dentally, Eastman was an official
at the finish when Lloyd hit the
tape to break his mar k.
4:06 Last Week
Last week in Los Angeles,
Lloyd ran the mile in 4:06 to
erase a school record which had
stood since 1940.
Saturday, he had to run almost
as fast as he did to even win.
Ernie Cunliffe, the second-place
finisher in 1:51.3, was right with
Lloyd for the first 660. Cunliffe
led at the 220 in 26 seconds, and
was still on top at the end of the
first lap in 53.5.
Lloyd started his move coming
off the third turn, and the two
were even at the 660 in 1:21.0.
Then Lloyd started his big kick,
and pulled away to an eight-yard
lead. He faded slightly in the
final 30 yards, but Cunliffe was
too far back to challenge.
The relay victory was a tre
mendous one for the four In
dians, who covered the mile in
3:11.4 — the nation's third - best
time of the year.
Early Leads
Lassen led off with a 48.9 leg
from the blocks, and opened a 5-
yard lead. Cunliffe whipped by
in 48.0 as the lead increased by 8
more yards.
Lloyd maintained the lead over
Mike Agostini on the third leg,
and was clocked in 47.3. Chesa
rek finished in 47.2, and added
the few final yards to the win
ning margin.
The combined effort cracked
the 1940 stadium record of 3:12.9,
set by the team of Charles Shaw,
Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson
and Clyde Jeffrey. That quartet
also holds the University record
of 3:10.5.
The featured pair of hurdles
duels between Chuck Cobb and
Ancel Robinson came out a draw.
Cobb led all the way in the highs
as .Robinson clobbered the three
final hurdles, winning in a good
14.1.
Foot Behind
Then in the lows, .Robinson was
away fast and held on over fast
closing Cobb. Both men were
credited with 23.4, although Cobb
was a foot behind.
Mike Franchetti came up with
Stanford's most pleasing field
event performance when he pole
vaulted 14 feet to gain a tic for
second.
Only two men, Bud Deacon and
Tiill Miller, have done belter for
Stanford. Deacon went 14-2% in
the 1934 University champion
ships, and Miller did 14-1% in

the few final yards to the win
ning margin.
The combined effort cracked
the 1940 stadium record of 3:12.9,
set by the team of Charles Shaw,
Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson
and Clyde Jeffrey. That quartet
also holds the University record
of 3:10.5.
The featured pair of hurdles
duels between Chuck Cobb and
Ancel Robinson came out a draw.
Cobb led all the way in the highs
as .Robinson clobbered the three
final hurdles, winning in a good
14.1.
Foot Behind
Then in the lows, .Robinson was
away fast and held on over fast
closing Cobb. Both men were
credited with 23.4, although Cobb
was a foot behind.
Mike Franchetti came up with
Stanford's most pleasing field
event performance when he pole
vaulted 14 feet to gain a tic for
second.
Only two men, Bud Deacon and
Tiill Miller, have done belter for
Stanford. Deacon went 14-2% in
the 1934 University champion
ships, and Miller did 14-1% in
19.'>2. Four others have done 14
feel.
Chris Plain and Jerry Winters
each came through his best corn
pet ilive mark this year in plac
ing one-two in the shot. Plain
put his first effort out to 52-1 Va,
and Winters hit the 51-914 mark.
Hansen Adds Quarter-Inch
Kent Hansen proved his 24-1%
broad jump at Ihe Texas Relays
was no fluke as he added a quar
fer-ineh to it in winning the event
Sat urday.
Agostini and Jack Wilcox, both
of Fresno, were the only double
winners. Agostini captured the
sprints in 9.7 and 21.6. Wilcox
won the mile in 4:11.2, then got
a dead heat for first in the two
mile with teammate John Fore
man.
The rest of the Stanford win
ners were Chesarek, wilh a 48.6
quarter, and Jim Backstrand,
with a .javelin Ihrow of 198-7 Mi.
Norman LJoyd broke his second Stanford record within eight days
and the Cards' mile relay team cracked an 18-year-old Stadium mark
to lead Stanford to a 66%-64 l-j victory over Fresno State here Sat
urday.
The relay quartet of Dick Lassen, Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don-

Chesarek won the meet for Stan
ford. Fresno had led by 2%
points going into the relay after
overcoming a mid-meet deficit of
more than 21 points, but the five
relay points swung the decision
to Stanford.
Lloyd moved down from the
mile to the 880, and went the two
laps in 1:50.5, the fastest time in
the nation this year and the fast
est a Stanford runner has ever
covered the distance.
Lloyd's effort cracked the old
standard of 1:50.9, which Ben
Eastman had set in 1932. Coinci
dentally, Eastman was an official
at the finish when Lloyd hit the
tape to break his mar k.
4:06 Last Week
Last week in Los Angeles,
Lloyd ran the mile in 4:06 to
erase a school record which had
stood since 1940.
Saturday, he had to run almost
as fast as he did to even win.
Ernie Cunliffe, the second-place
finisher in 1:51.3, was right with
Lloyd for the first 660. Cunliffe
led at the 220 in 26 seconds, and
was still on top at the end of the
first lap in 53.5.
Lloyd started his move coming
off the third turn, and the two
were even at the 660 in 1:21.0.
Then Lloyd started his big kick,
and pulled away to an eight-yard
lead. He faded slightly in the
final 30 yards, but Cunliffe was
too far back to challenge.
The relay victory was a tre
mendous one for the four In
dians, who covered the mile in
3:11.4 — the nation's third - best
time of the year.
Early Leads
Lassen led off with a 48.9 leg
from the blocks, and opened a 5-
yard lead. Cunliffe whipped by
in 48.0 as the lead increased by 8
more yards.
Lloyd maintained the lead over
Mike Agostini on the third leg,
and was clocked in 47.3. Chesa
rek finished in 47.2, and added
the few final yards to the win
ning margin.
