# 'New Look' Glee Club a Success
## 
### Leon Allen 
The Stanford Men's Glee Club
proved to its audience yesterday
afternoon that the "Ivy League"
schools certainly have no hold on
the realm of men's vocal groups.
The men, looking very well
dressed in their new blazers,
treated their listeners with 20
songs. The best of these were
three German drinking songs,
performed in a manner that
would make the Rhineland proud.
Each song, done completely in
German, moved along with a
pleasing rhythm and sounded
very well practiced.
The program was highlighted
by the smooth, rich solos of bari
tone Wayne Andersen and the
snappy renditions of the octet.
Andersen whs hampered slight ly
by a rather loud accompanist, but
his own work was flawless.
The octet made its success with
four songs by Richard Rogers.
This group lacked a little balance,
with the tenors outvoicing the
deeper men.
One real weakness was appar
ent throughout the program.
While the men's vocal work was
very unified, the physical appear

ance of the group was much too
individualistic. The men did not
move as a body, and the eyes of
the performers seemed to wander
many times from the director.
The program could have been
more skillfully arranged as to the
order in which the songs were
performed.
The club began with five rather
heavy songs which did not reveal
the talent that was to appear
later. After showing a fast mov
ing body, the program ended with
a very goodâ€”but again slow-mov
ing- piece.
The program had the life and
spirit that the audience seemed to
enjoy, but this could have been
lost through the programing.
While the club was a success,
the audience was lacking, at least
so far as size was concerned. Din*
kelspiel Auditorium is capable of
holding up to 750, hut yesterday's
crowd fell below 200.
The Men's Glee Club is good,
and certainly, after another soa
son or two of polishing and per
fecting, they will be able to hold
their own against any of the top
men's singing groups in the Unit
ed States.
