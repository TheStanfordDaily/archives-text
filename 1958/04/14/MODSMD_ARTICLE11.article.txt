# 58 Candidates File In 4 Hours Friday
## Jack Connolly, Ray York Enter Race for President 
### Doug Willis 
Fifty-eight petitions for ASSLJ, class and AWS offices were turned
in to Elections Commission in the last four hours of filing Friday
afternoon. Only one office had less than two candidates and no office
was without a candidate.
Two new candidates have filed for ASSU president—Jack Con-

nolly, Sigma Chi, and Ray York,
Phi Kappa Psi. In a preliminary
statement to The Daily, Connolly
said:
"Because the University invests
very little power in the student
government, the student govern
ment has little or no authority.
Consequently the student body is
not interested in ASSU govern
ment.
"The only major role that stu
dent government can play is that
of a social co-ordinator. While I
have been at Stanford, it has not
even done this. I think that it
should."
York's Statement
Ray York told The Daily, "Stu
dent government is a positive
force but should never be thrust
on students for its own sake. We
are at Stanford to get an educa
tion, and it defeats the philosophy
of student government to beat
the drum for activities, or force
Legislature meetings on students
when there is not sufficient in
terest.
"On the other hand if there is
interest in activities, whether
they be Ram's Head or the
Scratch Sheet, these activities
should be supported and contin
ued."
One more candidate, Sandra
Bull, has filed for ASSU vice-pres
ident. Tony Dingman, Sigma Chi,
has filed for head yell leader and
Jim Adams has withdrawn from
the head yell leader race,
