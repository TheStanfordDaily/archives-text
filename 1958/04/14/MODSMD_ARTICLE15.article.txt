# TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## Testing Pro and Con 
### Walter Lippmann 
In the propaganda contest, of which we have
just now had another round, our basic position is
that we do not wish to suspend the testing of
nuclear weapons and that we do not in the near
future wish to have a summit meeting in which
Eisenhower confronts Khrushchev. This is, of
course, a difficult position to argue in a world
which i« terrified by the race in nuclear arma
ments and is hoping compulsively that in a meet
ing at the summit some kind of accommodation
might be reached. Mr. Dulles, who has the hard
task of arguing the official American case, is
talking like a man who knows that the best he
can do is to fight a delaying action—to avoid a
decisive commitment on the tests and on the
summit meeting.
The crucial question at this point is: What is
the basic Soviet position? Is it that, having just
completed their own series of tests, their objec
tive is to prevent us from holding our forth
coming tests? It cannot be that simple; for such
a maneuver could easily be defeated by proposing
to suspend our tests after we, like they, have
completed our tests. Or is it that the Soviets
know that, what with Dr. Teller, Admiral Strauss
and most of the Pentagon, we intend to go on
testing—as indeed Mr. Dulles indicated at his
press conference —and that, therefore, the So
viets can propose to cease testing? For they will
know that we will not cease and that they can
then continue. Or is it that the Soviets do not
mean to cease but are relying on being able to
cheat by holding undetected tests?
« *
My own view is that the main Russian position
is founded not upon gimmicks and propaganda
tricks but upon their estimate of the over-all
balance of power' in the world as between their
coalition and ours. To suspend nuclear testing
is in fact to freeze the development of nuclear
weapons, and if that were done now the world
balance of power would be favorable to them.
They know they will not be attacked, and they
have or are about to have ample weapons to neu
tralize ;my military pressure on the Communist

orbit. Along with this, they have superior mili
tary power, consisting of conventional forces and
existing nuclear weapons, as against any of the
countries on their periphery.
In the West, on the other hand, there is no
prospect that the democracies will support a
combined military establishment comparable
with that of the Soviet Union —except for one
possibility. This is the development of cheap
nuclear weapons to replace massive armies.
For this reason, so I believe, there is deter
mined resistance inside the Western governments
to interference with the evolution of nuclear
weapons. This resistance has its center among
the soldiers and scientists who, believing that
war is not improbable, feel acutely their own
responsibility in case war breaks out.

Undeniably, there would be a risk in suspend
ing the tests and freezing the development of
nuclear weapons. But there is also a risk in con
tinuing the tests. It is that the race of arma
ments will go on, will indeed be intensified, with
no certainty whatever that the Soviet Union will
not forge ahead of us in this field as it has forged
ahead of us in the field of rockets. There is no
built-in guarantee that Dr. Teller and Admiral
Strauss can create nuclear armaments which the
Russians cannot beat or even match. For when
the Russians concentrate their efforts on a par
ticular military objective they are a formidable
nation.
We have to weigh in the balance the risk of
freezing the development of nuclear weapons as
against the risk of intensified competition in the
development of the nuclear weapons. This is the
fundamental issue, and this country is entitled
to have it explained and debated. Even as propa
ganda, such a debate would do us good—much
more good than the notes and press conferences
with which we present our face to the world.
For it would show the serious people of the world
that in these great affairs we know how to be
candid and that we are indeed serious.

completed their own series of tests, their objec
tive is to prevent us from holding our forth
coming tests? It cannot be that simple; for such
a maneuver could easily be defeated by proposing
to suspend our tests after we, like they, have
completed our tests. Or is it that the Soviets
know that, what with Dr. Teller, Admiral Strauss
and most of the Pentagon, we intend to go on
testing—as indeed Mr. Dulles indicated at his
press conference —and that, therefore, the So
viets can propose to cease testing? For they will
know that we will not cease and that they can
then continue. Or is it that the Soviets do not
mean to cease but are relying on being able to
cheat by holding undetected tests?
« *
My own view is that the main Russian position
is founded not upon gimmicks and propaganda
tricks but upon their estimate of the over-all
balance of power' in the world as between their
coalition and ours. To suspend nuclear testing
is in fact to freeze the development of nuclear
weapons, and if that were done now the world
balance of power would be favorable to them.
They know they will not be attacked, and they
have or are about to have ample weapons to neu
tralize ;my military pressure on the Communist

orbit. Along with this, they have superior mili
tary power, consisting of conventional forces and
existing nuclear weapons, as against any of the
countries on their periphery.
In the West, on the other hand, there is no
prospect that the democracies will support a
combined military establishment comparable
with that of the Soviet Union —except for one
possibility. This is the development of cheap
nuclear weapons to replace massive armies.
For this reason, so I believe, there is deter
mined resistance inside the Western governments
to interference with the evolution of nuclear
weapons. This resistance has its center among
the soldiers and scientists who, believing that
war is not improbable, feel acutely their own
responsibility in case war breaks out.

Undeniably, there would be a risk in suspend
ing the tests and freezing the development of
nuclear weapons. But there is also a risk in con
tinuing the tests. It is that the race of arma
ments will go on, will indeed be intensified, with
no certainty whatever that the Soviet Union will
not forge ahead of us in this field as it has forged
ahead of us in the field of rockets. There is no
built-in guarantee that Dr. Teller and Admiral
Strauss can create nuclear armaments which the
Russians cannot beat or even match. For when
the Russians concentrate their efforts on a par
ticular military objective they are a formidable
nation.
We have to weigh in the balance the risk of
freezing the development of nuclear weapons as
against the risk of intensified competition in the
development of the nuclear weapons. This is the
fundamental issue, and this country is entitled
to have it explained and debated. Even as propa
ganda, such a debate would do us good—much
more good than the notes and press conferences
with which we present our face to the world.

that in these great affairs we know how to be
candid and that we are indeed serious.

In the propaganda contest, of which we have
just now had another round, our basic position is
that we do not wish to suspend the testing of
nuclear weapons and that we do not in the near
future wish to have a summit meeting in which
Eisenhower confronts Khrushchev. This is, of
course, a difficult position to argue in a world
which i« terrified by the race in nuclear arma
ments and is hoping compulsively that in a meet
ing at the summit some kind of accommodation
might be reached. Mr. Dulles, who has the hard
task of arguing the official American case, is
talking like a man who knows that the best he
can do is to fight a delaying action—to avoid a
decisive commitment on the tests and on the
summit meeting.

tricks but upon their estimate of the over-all
balance of power' in the world as between their
coalition and ours. To suspend nuclear testing
is in fact to freeze the development of nuclear
weapons, and if that were done now the world
balance of power would be favorable to them.
They know they will not be attacked, and they
have or are about to have ample weapons to neu
tralize ;my military pressure on the Communist

orbit. Along with this, they have superior mili
tary power, consisting of conventional forces and
existing nuclear weapons, as against any of the
countries on their periphery.
In the West, on the other hand, there is no
prospect that the democracies will support a
combined military establishment comparable
with that of the Soviet Union —except for one
possibility. This is the development of cheap
nuclear weapons to replace massive armies.
For this reason, so I believe, there is deter
mined resistance inside the Western governments
to interference with the evolution of nuclear
weapons. This resistance has its center among
the soldiers and scientists who, believing that
war is not improbable, feel acutely their own
responsibility in case war breaks out.

Undeniably, there would be a risk in suspend
ing the tests and freezing the development of
nuclear weapons. But there is also a risk in con
tinuing the tests. It is that the race of arma
ments will go on, will indeed be intensified, with
no certainty whatever that the Soviet Union will
not forge ahead of us in this field as it has forged
ahead of us in the field of rockets. There is no
built-in guarantee that Dr. Teller and Admiral
Strauss can create nuclear armaments which the
Russians cannot beat or even match. For when
the Russians concentrate their efforts on a par
ticular military objective they are a formidable
nation.
We have to weigh in the balance the risk of
freezing the development of nuclear weapons as
against the risk of intensified competition in the
development of the nuclear weapons. This is the
fundamental issue, and this country is entitled
to have it explained and debated. Even as propa
ganda, such a debate would do us good—much
more good than the notes and press conferences
with which we present our face to the world.
For it would show the serious people of the world
that in these great affairs we know how to be
candid and that we are indeed serious.
