Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations on your well • expressed and
thoughtful editorial of April 7, entitled "Ideologi
cal Warfare."
The United States has many able men to fight
the War of Words. Why, indeed, does our Gov
ernment not use them instead of losing this war

without oven a fight ? The stakes are higher than
we think, and the hour is already late.
May I take this opportunity to tell you how
much we, as freshman parents, have enjoyed our
visits with Stanford this year through the pages
of The Daily? Please go on expressing your in
formed opinions and raising thoughtful ques
t ions.
