# Truman Diagnoses Recession
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)~Harry S.
Truman yesterday wrote out an
anti recession prescription Riving
high priority to reducing the an
nual interest rate paid on the
national debt.
The former President was rep
resented by close associates as
sympathetic to a tax cut for the
lowest-income groups if the reve
nue loss can be offset by reduced
interest payments and other tax
adjustments.
But, he told callers, he is op
posed to tax cuts which would
throw the budget further out of
balance and provide tax benefits
to "the rich who can afford to
pay."
Final Draft
The 73-year-old ex-President be
gan the final draft of testimony
he will present at a House Bank
ing Committee hearing today aft
er returning from a two-mile be
fore-breakfast stroll that carried
him around the gates of the
White House.
Both Truman and his aides em
phasized that final decisions on
the economic package he will out
line to the House committee were
being held up until the last
minute.
Reduce Kates
The importance that Truman
attaches to government steps to
reduce its own interest charges
was emphasized in his address to
the AMVETS dinner here Satur
day night.
"We can't expect to have a con
tinually expanding economy if we
strangle it with high interest
rates," he said.
Some Democrats have contend
ed that the Eisenhower Adminis
tration helped bring on the reces
sion by a policy of paying higher
interest rates on federal borrow
ings.
