# Troy, UCLA Top Stanford Netters

### John Schwarz 
(Editor's Not*': Daily sports writer John Schwarz traveled with
the Stanford tennis team to Los Angeles for their weekend matches
wit li DS(! and UCLA.)

Ninety-degree weather and a pair of very confident tennis teams
from UCLA and USC combined to deal the Stanford tennis team
their first and second defeats of the season over the weekend.
The Stanford netters, thrown off considerably from the rain which

canceled numerous practices over
ready for the powerful and steady
netters of Los Angeles, and found
themselves on the short end of
9-0 and 7-2 decisions to UCLA and
USC respectively.
At UCLA Stanford gained but
two sets the entire afternoon as
they met some tough competition
for the first time this season.
Douglas Off
Jack Douglas had one of his
worst afternoons in the last three

the last two weeks, just were not
years as he dropped a 6-4, 6-4 de
cision to UCLA's Mike Franks,
an opponent Douglas usually
masters.
Stanford had a bad break in
the second singles when Brooks
Rawlins won his first set from
UCLA's John Cranston and then
ran out of steam and couldn't get
going the rest of the match.
The rest of the Stanford sin
gles men all lost straight set de
cisions except sophomore Jim
Jeffries. Jeffries like Rawlins
won his opening set but then tired
amidst the smog and 90-degree
heat. He lost a three-setter to
Franklin Johnson 7-9, 6-4, 6-1.
Close al IJKC
At SC, Stanford came within
seven games of winning a 5-4 de
cision but were turned back 7-2.
The match was one of the most
exciting of the season. Stanford
came into the doubles play trail
ing by two matches and needed
all three doubles matches to win.
Each match went Ihe full three
sets but the Trojans with more
experience under fire grabbed off
all three by close scores.
Nelson, playing perhaps the
finest match of his life, showed
tremendous power in defeating
Jim Buck of SC, 7-5, 7-5. Nelson,
who has one of the PCC's top
serves, played well in following
his serve to the net and eased in
point after point.
Gil White hardly worked up a
sweat in defeating USC's Ernie
Follico, 6-4, 6-3, to give Stanford
its other win.

(Editor's Not*': Daily sports writer John Schwarz traveled with
the Stanford tennis team to Los Angeles for their weekend matches
wit li DS(! and UCLA.)

Ninety-degree weather and a pair of very confident tennis teams
from UCLA and USC combined to deal the Stanford tennis team
their first and second defeats of the season over the weekend.
The Stanford netters, thrown off considerably from the rain which

canceled numerous practices over
ready for the powerful and steady
netters of Los Angeles, and found
themselves on the short end of
9-0 and 7-2 decisions to UCLA and
USC respectively.
At UCLA Stanford gained but
two sets the entire afternoon as
they met some tough competition
for the first time this season.
Douglas Off
Jack Douglas had one of his
worst afternoons in the last three

the last two weeks, just were not
years as he dropped a 6-4, 6-4 de
cision to UCLA's Mike Franks,
an opponent Douglas usually
masters.
Stanford had a bad break in
the second singles when Brooks
Rawlins won his first set from
UCLA's John Cranston and then
ran out of steam and couldn't get
going the rest of the match.
The rest of the Stanford sin
gles men all lost straight set de
cisions except sophomore Jim
Jeffries. Jeffries like Rawlins
won his opening set but then tired
amidst the smog and 90-degree
heat. He lost a three-setter to
Franklin Johnson 7-9, 6-4, 6-1.
Close al IJKC
At SC, Stanford came within
seven games of winning a 5-4 de
cision but were turned back 7-2.
The match was one of the most
exciting of the season. Stanford
came into the doubles play trail
ing by two matches and needed
all three doubles matches to win.
Each match went Ihe full three
sets but the Trojans with more
experience under fire grabbed off
all three by close scores.
Nelson, playing perhaps the
finest match of his life, showed
tremendous power in defeating
Jim Buck of SC, 7-5, 7-5. Nelson,
who has one of the PCC's top
serves, played well in following
his serve to the net and eased in
point after point.
Gil White hardly worked up a
sweat in defeating USC's Ernie
Follico, 6-4, 6-3, to give Stanford
its other win.
