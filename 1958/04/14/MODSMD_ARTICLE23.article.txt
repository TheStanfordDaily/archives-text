# SC Sweeps Series; Marion Lost
## 
### Jerry Wisot 
It was a tough weekend almost
all the way around for the Stan
ford varsity baseball team as the
previous league-leaders were
dumped into second place by los
ing a double-header Saturday to
Southern California. The only
bright spot was a 16-2 win over
Santa Clara Friday, but even this
game was dimmed by the injury
of shortstop Wayne Marion.
Marion was injured while cov
ering a play at second base, tear
ing ligaments in his leg. He was
operated on for three hours at
Palo Alto Hospital Saturday
morning. The latest report is that
he will be lost for the season.

Against IT.SC, all efforts of the
Indian club to retain its lead were
smothered as it suffered 10-5 and
13-3 defeats to the Southlanders.
"The Cards got off to a good
start in the first when catcher
Ralph Holding tripled to score
Jim Burk and Joel Newkirk. But
their elation soon turned to dis
appointment when the Trojans
filled the bases with no outs and
scored six runs on only three
hits before the side was retired in
the fourth.
Lefty Bob Leopold went the
first eight innings and was
shelled for all Ihe Trojan runs.
Only six of them were earned,
however. Leopold had gone into
hte game with a 4-1 record and
1.20 ERA.
In the second game the Trojans
took no time to put themselves
on the scoreboard as the first five
men up singled and scored. One
more run crossed the plate before
the third out. Stanford came
right back with three runs in the
bottom of that frame when a
double by Shaw scored Burk and
Robinson and then the second
baseman came in himself on a
single to right field by DeFabio.
The only other inning of scor
ing was the top of the third in

which Trojan center-fielder Ron
{Fairly homered to spark SC's
biggest burst of the day. In the
seven-run inning Fairly knocked
the ball over the right field fence
at the 360-foot mark, the fourth
home run over that fence in his
tory, bringing in three runs.
The bright spot of the weekend
was George Avery's four - hit
pitching and a 12-hit attack which
walloped Santa Clara. Rich De-
Fabio smacked two triples and a
double, good for three RBl's, to
lead the Card attack.
The three-game weekend left
the Indians with a 4-2 league rec
ord as compared with USC's 5-0.


PECULIAR PUTOUT —Joel Newkirk was out on this play in the
last of the seventh of Saturday's first game, lie grounded to short,
and USC tried for the d.p. Jim Burk was safe at second, but tin'
relay to first still caught Newkirk, the play going 6-4-3.

scored six runs on only three
hits before the side was retired in
the fourth.

first eight innings and was
shelled for all Ihe Trojan runs.
Only six of them were earned,

men up singled and scored. One
more run crossed the plate before
the third out. Stanford came
right back with three runs in the
bottom of that frame when a
double by Shaw scored Burk and
Robinson and then the second
baseman came in himself on a
single to right field by DeFabio.
The only other inning of scor
ing was the top of the third in

which Trojan center-fielder Ron

biggest burst of the day. In the
seven-run inning Fairly knocked
the ball over the right field fence

home run over that fence in his
tory, bringing in three runs.
The bright spot of the weekend

pitching and a 12-hit attack which
walloped Santa Clara. Rich De-
Fabio smacked two triples and a
double, good for three RBl's, to
lead the Card attack.
The three-game weekend left

ord as compared with USC's 5-0.

It was a tough weekend almost
all the way around for the Stan
ford varsity baseball team as the
previous league-leaders were

bright spot was a 16-2 win over

operated on for three hours at
Palo Alto Hospital Saturday
