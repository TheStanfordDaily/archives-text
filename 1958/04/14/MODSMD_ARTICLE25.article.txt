Long Beach City College dealt
Tom Haynie's Stanford varsity

that the Indians have lost in
many years.

anchor man on the winning 400-
yard relay.
Robin Moore, star Indian rec
ord-holder. grabbed firsts in the
100 and 220 free-style races and a
third in the 440 free, but failed to
get much support from the rest
of the team.
The locals' Tom Peterson pulled

a first in the 200-yard breast
stroke and second in the 50 free.
Tim Tlmkin churned up a first in
the 200 butterfly, with team cap
tain Winston Bla c k finishing
third.

in the 100 free, and Bill Fuller
pulled a second in the 200-yard
backstroke. Stanford's 400-yard
relay squad of Steve Jackson,
Treat: Cafferata, Foucade and
