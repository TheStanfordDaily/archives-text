# 'MAN MUST BOW'
## Jesuit Warns Against Secularization of Religion 
### Lynn Patchett 
"There is danger today that religion will be relegated to the role
of a "function of society," according to Father Gustave Weigel in
last night's address at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
He will finish his series of three lectures today at 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley with a discussion of (he only way in which churches can

make a secular contribution.
Man is in a continual search for
peace, according to the Jesuit
priest. Peace he defined as regu
larity, security and order. Since
man is free, he is not hound by
the regularity of nature and must
find order in human organiza
tions.
Father Weigel finds this search
for stability the community's de
mand on the church.
He said that Americans as a
whole think religion a "good
thing" because it builds moral,
sober citizens who provide de
pendability and order.
Here lies the question of the
church's role in public life. Fa
ther Weigel asked, "Are the
American churches here to save
America?"
To answer this he says we
must "distinguish between pur
pose and consequence."
"In all religions, according to
the father, "there is a recognition
of lordship of an absolute to
which man must bow." Religious
assent requires complete submis
sion.
Therefore, Father Weigel said,
man may not "kneel before God
just because society demands it."
Religion is good in itself and the
role of churches here is not to
"save America."
In concluding the formal part
of the lecture, Father Weigel ven
tured the theory that "our secu
lar affairs will move much bet
ter" if we pursued religious expe
rience rather than secular satis
faction. "What we must seek is
the kingdom of God, not the
other things."
In the 30-minute discussion pe
riod following the lecture, the
theologian answered some de
nominational questions concern
ing church censorship.

FR. WEIGLE SPEAKS ON "RELIGION AND PUBLIC LIFE"
"Are American Churches Here to Save America?"
"There is danger today that religion will be relegated to the role
of a "function of society," according to Father Gustave Weigel in
last night's address at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
He will finish his series of three lectures today at 4:15 p.m. in
Cubberley with a discussion of (he only way in which churches can

make a secular contribution.
Man is in a continual search for
peace, according to the Jesuit
priest. Peace he defined as regu
larity, security and order. Since
man is free, he is not hound by
the regularity of nature and must
find order in human organiza
tions.
Father Weigel finds this search
for stability the community's de
mand on the church.
He said that Americans as a
whole think religion a "good
thing" because it builds moral,
sober citizens who provide de
pendability and order.
Here lies the question of the
church's role in public life. Fa
ther Weigel asked, "Are the
American churches here to save
America?"
To answer this he says we
must "distinguish between pur
pose and consequence."
"In all religions, according to
the father, "there is a recognition
of lordship of an absolute to
which man must bow." Religious
assent requires complete submis
sion.
Therefore, Father Weigel said,
man may not "kneel before God
just because society demands it."
Religion is good in itself and the
role of churches here is not to
"save America."
In concluding the formal part
