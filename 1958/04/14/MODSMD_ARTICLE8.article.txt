# HUMPHREY:
## Russ Tests Halted Due To Fallout 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)â€”Sen. Hu
bert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.) said
yesterday there is probably a
great deal of evidence to support
a Danish newspaper report that
recent Soviet nuclear tests were
halted after a catastrophic acci
dent involving enormous showers
of radioactive fallout.
He described the Russian ex
periments as "the dirtiest radio
active debris tests the world has
ever known." Heavy fallout land
ed on Scandinavia, northern Eu
rope, Japan and parts of the Unit
ed States, he added.
Humphrey, head of the Senate
Disarmament Subcommittee, also
said that within the past year
Soviet technicians had -set off a
nine-kiloton atomic explosion un
derground in China.
He said no workable inspection
system could bo agreed to before
this country's forthcoming series
of nuclear tests in the Pacific.
However, after the tests, he
added, President Eisenhower
should go before the Security
Council and propose agreements
for an international inspection
system and a halt to testing.
Humphrey suggested that the
UN negotiations precede the sum
mit conference which the Soviet
Union has urged.
