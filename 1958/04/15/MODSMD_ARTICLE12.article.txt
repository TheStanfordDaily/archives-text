112 vi m I? Gustave Wf.lC.el's remark in his talk
Sundas ni<rln lliat peace is "regularity, security
and order" reminded us of I lie contrasting view
presented I>y Berlin playwright Bertolt Breeht
in 11is play ".Mother Courage."
One of the characters puts forth the idea
lli.il peace is chaos and that true order and
security exist only during war. In wartime
imiitar\ organization gives everyone a position
in society, a definite and important function
to perform, and thus a sense of security.
\\ ar is therefore man's great "normalcy," and
,'in\ deviation from it brings chaos and con
fusion. Though peace "breaks out" from time
to time, war always returns.
Such an outlook is upsetting to contemplate,
and our great hope is that any troth it may
have held in I lie past will he negated by man's
future actions.
The great mission of Western society is to
make l ather W eigel's definition of peace come
true. Communist doctrine claims that war is
an inc\itahle result of capitalism, since capi
talist countries seek to further their economic

interests bv it. But so long as governments put
their own interests, whether economic or other
wise, above the general interests of mankind,
there will be war.
The sincerity of the Western countries to
prevent war is beyond question. But one of the
great dangers in their present methods of pre
serving peace through building up arms is that
they will forget what sort of a peace it is they
want —and make it impossible to realize.
\\ hat good is peace if we have sacrificed the
ideals of our civilization to obtain it —if we
have become a militaristic and materialistic
colossus without a "soul"?
Nations in war are always enjoined to "re
member what we're fighting for." Now, in
"peacetime," we might do well to adopt the
same slogan. Let's remember our long-term
objective—the kind of peace we're fighting for:
a lasting peace with freedom, justice and se
curity, and the will and opportunity for intel
lectual and spiritual growth.
Let's not subvert these goals by the very act
of striving to attain them.

serving peace through building up arms is that
they will forget what sort of a peace it is they
want —and make it impossible to realize.
\\ hat good is peace if we have sacrificed the
ideals of our civilization to obtain it —if we
have become a militaristic and materialistic
colossus without a "soul"?
Nations in war are always enjoined to "re
member what we're fighting for." Now, in
"peacetime," we might do well to adopt the
same slogan. Let's remember our long-term
objective—the kind of peace we're fighting for:
a lasting peace with freedom, justice and se
curity, and the will and opportunity for intel
lectual and spiritual growth.
Let's not subvert these goals by the very act
of striving to attain them.
112 vi m I? Gustave Wf.lC.el's remark in his talk
Sundas ni<rln lliat peace is "regularity, security
and order" reminded us of I lie contrasting view
presented I>y Berlin playwright Bertolt Breeht
in 11is play ".Mother Courage."
One of the characters puts forth the idea
lli.il peace is chaos and that true order and
security exist only during war. In wartime
imiitar\ organization gives everyone a position
in society, a definite and important function
to perform, and thus a sense of security.
\\ ar is therefore man's great "normalcy," and
,'in\ deviation from it brings chaos and con
fusion. Though peace "breaks out" from time
to time, war always returns.
Such an outlook is upsetting to contemplate,
and our great hope is that any troth it may
have held in I lie past will he negated by man's
future actions.
The great mission of Western society is to
make l ather W eigel's definition of peace come
true. Communist doctrine claims that war is
an inc\itahle result of capitalism, since capi
talist countries seek to further their economic

interests bv it. But so long as governments put
their own interests, whether economic or other
wise, above the general interests of mankind,
there will be war.
The sincerity of the Western countries to
prevent war is beyond question. But one of the
great dangers in their present methods of pre
serving peace through building up arms is that
they will forget what sort of a peace it is they
want —and make it impossible to realize.
