# Our Compliments to Berlin
## 
### 
\\ oi icrowth of the Berlin Airlift, when
Mitnlonl students presented students at the
Free I niversit\ of Berlin with aid of various
kinds, the Stanford-Free University of Berlin
\fliliation lias grown from a niodest cultural
an I relief exchange in 1951 to tlie present large
stndent exchange program.
I oda\ we would like to pay tribute to this
fir.-t of Stanford's Institute of International He
! it inns exchanges. Few forms of international
exchange are as effective as the active exchange
of students between countries. For it is only
through litis t\pe of exchange that true knowl
edge of a nation's culture and philosophy can
he obtained.

The Stanford-Berlin exchange program is
especially beneficial in that it is wholly spon
sored by the students of both universities.
\\ hen students become active enough to spon
sor such projects on their own and through
their own initiative, then we, as students, have
a right to be proud of this endeavor.
Today s issue of The Daily is devoted, to a
great extent, to this affiliation. Two thousand
copies will be forwarded to Berlin as part of
Stanford's exchange program. To the recipients
of these copies we would like to pay our com
pliments for their part in making this exchange
the success it has been since the first students
were exchanged in 1953.
