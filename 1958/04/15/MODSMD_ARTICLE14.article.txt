(hi I dish llnmh Fears
Editor, The Daily:
There has been much discussion lately concern
ing the halting of A-bomb tests. The childish
fears displayed by those protesting the tests are
repulsive to rational people. If we do not perfect
1 he A bomb, how can we hope to preserve our
dearesl possession, democracy? It is foolish to
risk our freedom, but the reason behind the pro
tests is even less rational. Isn't the loss of a few
lives here and there justified when all that our
forefathers worked for is at stake?
If the rumored "Slop the A-Bomb Tests" rally
takes place here, I'll probably be there to help
counteract anti-test feelings (that is, unless I
have by then succumbed from too much Sr Of) in
the name of democracy). In any case, I can rest

assured that our mutated children will carry on
my cause.

Ah, spring! In spite of the discomforts of
Sputniks, Ikeism and the recession, Mother Na
ture has asserted herself at last by bringing a
touch of sunshine to this dreary Stanford campus
of stacked-up stones and stagnant mausoleums.
And with her have appeared those lovely young
girls in their fresh cotton dresses, creating an
illusion of virginal beauty which, although un
doubtedly an illusion, is beautiful nonetheless.
Sweet, tender flesh - may you always reign
supreme!
