# AT THE GEARY
## 'Long Day's Journey' Emotionally Exhausting 
### Camille Petersen 
The . cast for Eugene O'Neill's
award - winning drama "Long
Day's Journey into Night" is ad
mirably led by veteran actress
Fay Bainter. The emotionally
exhausting story of the play
wright's family life is playing at
the Geary Theater in San Fran
cisco.
Miss Bainter portrays Mary
Cavan Tyrone, dope-addicted wife
of the former matinee actor
James Tyrone (Anew McMas
ter). At the opening of the play,
Mrs. Tyrone has recently re
turned from a "cure." The re
pressed anxiety of the other mem
bers of the family over whether
or not this time it will last cre
ates a tension which mounts
throughout the three-and-a-half
hour drama.
A great amount of versatility
and control is demanded of Miss
Bainter as she is called upon to
make quick yet natural changes
of character once Mrs. Tyrone
again returns to the use of mor
phine. Miss Bainter handles the
character with a deftness which
shows not only dramatic ability
but also an understanding for the
woman she is portraying.
McMaster is seen as James Ty
rone, the stage equivalent to
O'Neills' father. Between the

playwright's lines and the actor's
portrayal the man becomes a
character whom one dislikes yet
understands and pities.
The Tyrone brothers are played
by Roy Poole (James Tyrone Jr.)
and Chet Learning (Edmund),
who is in real life O'Neill himself.
The maid Cathleen is played by
Liz Thackston.
"Long Day's Journey into
Night" is as close to being an
objective picture showing the
faults and good points of each in
dividual as is possible for one
who loves each member to cre
ate.
It probes deeply into the inner
thoughts and relationships within
a family; bares things before an
audience which are usually kept
locked tightly from view.
It is this very quality which
gives the play its power and its
horror. People in the audience
feel uneasy, are embarrassed to
be "listening in" on some of the
speeches.
This is especially true in re
gard to some of Poole's lines.
His portrayal of the part is ex
tremely well done, but can be
really enjoyed only if one is will
ing to meet the dramatist on his
ground and accept James Tyrone
Jr. for the man he has been cre
ated to be. This is equally true
of the other characters.
