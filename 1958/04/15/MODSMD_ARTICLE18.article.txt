# Work on Student Union May Start Next Autumn
## 
### Barbara Bachman Associate Editor 
Days and years of an oft-imag
ined student union may soon be
come a reality, providing all goes
well during the next few months.
This is the encouraging fore
cast made by John Smart Lynd,
assistant planner in the Univer
sity's Planning Office.
The Donald B. Tresidder Memo
rial Union, as the proposed archi
tectural extravaganza will be call
ed, may get under way as early
as next fall if specific architec
tural plans are completed, if suf
ficient funds have been raised and
if the Board of Trustees approves
the undertaking at their May
meeting.
Outlook Optimistic
Too many "ifs," you say? Well,
perhaps. But after reviewing 10
years of planning for this student
union, and seeing the obstacles
and pitfalls along the road to real
ization of such a huge undertak
ing, today's outlook.is optimistic,
to say the least.
Approximately million will
lie needed to complete the Union,
and already the Tresidder Union
Fund contains about $1 million.
Tentative plans call for con
struction of only half the Union
at first, so this financial obstacle
is greatly reduced.
Preliminary drawings, plans,
ideas and suggestions are now in
San Francisco at the architectural
offices of Spencer & Lee under
going final and specific drawing.
The blueprints a-s well as a model
of the proposed Union will soon
be completed, and then the Un
ion's future will lie in the hands
of the Board of Trustees.
Favor Location
The trustees have already ap
proved tentative plans and are
generally in favor'of the location
and the proposed facilities. This
time, with the plans definitely be
fore them, the trustees may real
ize the time has come to give the
go-ahead signal.
The Florence Hellman Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, completed for
the 1957-58 academic year, is
the first building of several to
occupy and be included in the
proposed Student Activity Cen
ter. Other areas will be the new
Union. Post Office and Bookstore,
additional parking space and re
modeled buildings around Union
Court.

Located between Dinkelspiel
and Bowman Alumni House, the
proposed Union will embody a
plush recreational area and will
include an enormous room for
dances and banquets, bowling al
leys, table tennis and billiards
rooms, student offices, smaller
banquet rooms, a music listening
room, several eating areas, plus
many added facilities and conven
iences.
Many of the above ideas came
directly from students when 6,000
questionnaires were submitted by
the student-run Union Planning
Committee to all living groups in
1953.
On January 28, 19-18. Dr. Donald
B. Tresidder, then Stanford's pres
ident. died in a hotel room in New
York city while conducting Uni
versity business. Within a week
after his death the ASSU and Tre
sidder's widow set up a memorial

Union fund as a monument to Dr.,
Tresidder, who had served as Uni
versity president since January.
1943.
Mrs. Tresidder and her mother
contributed $60,607 to the fund,
with the request that there be
little publicity and no large-scale
public fund-raising campaign. By
1953 the total had risen to $600,-
000 and now stands at $1 million,
according to Lynd.
The expanding fund is being
derived from student fees, Stan
ford Union profits, gifts and in
vestment income. Each student's
quarterly tuition contributes $1
to the Tresidder fund. Union prof
its come from the sale of services
and goods at The Cellar, the pub
lic dining hall, Encina store and
other similar operations. I'he gifts
consist of money given by the
trustees, various student groups
and other donors.

Also expected to he under con
struction by full are the new
Bookstore and Post Office, at an
estimated cost of $500,000. These
buildings will probably be joined
by an arcade and will face Lasuen
Street, cutting across and closing
Salvatierra.
Plans for these two projects
will also be submitted to the
Board of Trustees for approval in
May. If both the Union and the
Bookstore - Post Office plans are
approved, construction may begin
simultaneously on both.
When these projects are com
pleted, the automobile thorough
fare will be closed from Engineer
ing Corner to Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. This area will be landscap
ed and will become a park-type
area from History Corner to and
through th e Student Activity
Center.
