### 
Stanford - in - Germany has re
cently acquired a resident direc
tor for the Beutelsbaeh "Farm"
through the efforts of Dr. Fried
rich Strothmann of tlie Modern
European Languages Depart
ment.
Strothmann told The Daily, "I
can't emphasize too much how
lucky we are to get Dr. Peter
Boerner for our resident direc
tor."
Boerner, Strothmann explained,
has previously been the director
of the Goethe Museum in Dues
seldorf and now has a position
with a Frankfurt publishing firm.
"We are very fortunate in that
Dr. Boerner turned down an offer
from another university to come
to America in order to take the
job," Strothmann said.
Permanent Director
Besides being the permanent
director, Boerner will take the
most advanced sections of Ger
man at the study center.
Strothmann said he noticed on
his recent I rip to the Beutelsbaeh
Study Branch thai Inn study cen
ter was attract! i 1 favorable pub
licity in the German press.
"I talked with American Con
sul General Moreland in Stult
gart. He kno.vs Germany very
well and believes thai Stanford
could not have chosen a better
location for a branch study cen
ter," Strothmann said.
Strothmann pointed out that
not only did the Ford Foundation
give Stanford an activation grant
for the study center, but the
Foundation plans to send an ob
server over this summer.
Ford Foundation
"If our experiment is a suc
cess, the Ford Foundation plans
to use it as a model for similar
undertakings. I would not be sur
prised if other institutions fol
lowed Stanford's example," he
added.
Gift money to be used to help
pay students' return voyages is
anticipated if 1he program is con
tinued, Strothmann told . The
Daily.
He also hopes that the 63 Stan
ford students traveling to Stan
ford-in-Germany will be greeted
in Stuttgart by the president of
the state of Baden-YVurttomberg,
in which the study center is lo
cated.
Stanford-in-France?
He pointed out that the General
Studies Committee is probing the
possibility of another center in
France.
Strothmann explained that the
theory behind Stanford's pro

gram is to allow as many stu
dents to study abroad as possible.
"If we wait until the junior as
many other universities do, many
science and other majors have
begun their major sequences and
cannot interrupt them for study
abroad without losing a whole
year.
"Stanford hopes through its
branch study center to allow
sophomores, who can change
their four-year programs with
greater ease, to study abroad.
"To broaden their experience, I
hope as many as can will stay in
Europe to travel for an extra
quarter," Strothmann said.
