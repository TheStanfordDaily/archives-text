SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: No. 3
Once again the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, bless tlieir tat
tooed hearts, have consented to let me use this space, normally
intended for levity, to bring you a brief lesson in science.
They are generous, openhanded men, the makers of Marlboro,
hearty, ruddy, and full of the joy of living, as anyone can tell
who has sampled their wares. In Marlboro you will find no
stinting, no stinginess. Marlboro's pleasures are rich, manifold,
and bountiful. You get a lot to like with a Marlboro—filter,
flavor, flip-top box, and, in some models, power steering.
The science that we take up today is called astronomy, from
the Greek words astro meaning "sore" and nomy meaning
"back". Sore backs were the occupational disease of the early
Greek astronomers, and no wonder! They used to spend every
blessed night lying on the damp ground and looking up at the
sky, and if there's a better way to get a sore back, I'd like to
hear about it. Especially in the moist Mediterranean area,
where Greece is generally considered to be.
Lumbago and related disorders kept astronomy from be
coming very popular until Galileo, an unemployed muleteer of
Pamplona, fashioned a homemade telescope in 1924 out of
three Social Security cards and an ordinary ice cube. What
schoolboy docs not know that stirring story—how Galileo
stepped up to his telescope, how he looked heavenward, how
his face filled with wonder, how he stepped back and whispered
the words heard round the world: "Let them eat cake!'?

Well sir, you can imagine what happened then! Willinm
Jennings Bryan snatched Nell Gwynne from the shadow of Hie
guillotine at Oslo; Chancellor Bismarck brought in four gushers
in a single afternoon; Enos Slaughter was signed by the Ifan
geatic League; Crete was declared off limits to Wellington's
army; and William Faulkner won the Davis Cup for his im
mortal I'titrod and Sam.
But after a while things calmed down and astronomers began
the staggering task of naming all the heavenly bodies. First
man to name a star was Sigafoos of Mt. Wilson, and the name
he chose was Betelgeuse, after his dear wife, Bctelgeuse Sigafoos,
prom queen at Michigan State from 1919 to 1931.
Then the Major Brothers of Ycrkes Observafory named stars
after their wives, Ursa and Canis, and Witnick of Harvard
named one after his wife, Big Dipper, and soon all the stars
were named.
Astronomers then turned to the question: is there life on
other planets? The answer was a flat, unequivocal no. Spectro
scopic studies proved without a doubt that the atmosphere
on the other planets was far too harsh to permit the culture of
the fine tobaccos that go into Marlboro Cigarettes ... And who
can live without Marlboro?

you won't find a better smoke.
