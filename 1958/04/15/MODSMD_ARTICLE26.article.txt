# IIR Mexican Vacation Jaunt Successful

Lying on the beaches of Baja
California soaking up the sun is
a wonderful way to spend spring
vacation, according to 26 happy
and sun-tanned American and for
eign Stanford students.
These 2G students went on the
•spring trip to Mexico organized
by the Host Club of the Institute
of International Relations. Thir
teen American and 13 foreign stu
dents, accompanied by Mr. and
Mrs. Carroll Harrington, spent
eight wonderful days traveling
and visiting the Baja California
peninsula at Ensenada, 100 miles
below the border.
Sleep in Church
Leaving by bus Saturday morn
ing after Finals Week, they stop
ped at Moro Bay the first night
and slept in a church because of
the heavy rains. Originally plans
had been to camp out every night,
but these had to be changed sev
eral times because of rain. The
second night — at San Clemente
Beach, in southern California —
sleep was interrupted at 4 a.m. by
a downpour which sent everybody
running for shelter, wet but still
game.
The next four nights were
spent near Ensenada camping out
and cooking meals over op en
fires. The food had a distinct in
ternational flavor to it, as many
of the foreign students pitched in
and prepared their native dishes.
One memorable part of the trip
was going into Mexican markets
and buying food by means of
guessing and sign language.
The days were filled with fish

ing, swimming, hiking and often
sleeping on the beach.
Shopping in Ensenada was an
other favorite pastime, and the
souvenirs brought back would
make the typical American tour
ist seem like a novice. Mexican
hats, shoes and wine bottles are
iust some of the "loot" they col
lected.
Much of the benefit of Ihe trip
came in discussions held on the
bus and in the camps. There was
such a wide variance of opinions
and ideas that seldom did a con
versation have a dull moment;
and all the students learned some
thing from hearing the ideas of
others.
Close Group
Another benefit gained from
the trip was "a real sense of
friendship," according to Harring
ton, a Western Civ instructor. He
said that by the time the bus had
readied the Mexican border all of
the students had formed a close
group and stuck togethei instead
of dividing into small cliques.
They also learned about Mexi
can culture and found out that
Mexico is not, as one student ex
pressed it the first day there, "a
backward nation because all they
do is fight with cows." Mexico has
much to offer, Ihey discovered;
and the few days they spent there
were not enough to find it all.
