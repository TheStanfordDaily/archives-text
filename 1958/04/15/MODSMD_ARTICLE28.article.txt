# Olsen Out With Sprained Ankle
## 
### 
Dutch Fehring will have an
other patch in his lineup today
at 3:15 p.m. when his Indian base
bailers meet Sacramento State in
a non-league game in the Sunken
Diamond.
Harry Rodda will be the new
man ia the opening lineup, taking
over the center field position. He
will he in the place of regular left
fielder Parker Olsen, who sprain
ed an a n k 1 c Saturday against
use.
Olsen was hurl sliding into sec
ond in the last of the sixth inning.
First X-iviys showed no break, but
he will undergo more X-rays as a
precautionary measure.
Hobby to Left
Ben Robinson will also be in
volved in the sw itch, moving over
to Olson's left-field spot. Rodda
will be used as the middle man
because of his speed and excel
lent defensive ability.
The change will be the second
within a half-week. Bob Dwight
moved into the regular shortstop
role when Wayne Marion injured
a knee l-Yiday against Santa Clara
and was declared out for the
season.

Olsen is definitely out of action
this week and is a doubtful per
former next week. He is present
ly on crutches.
Fehring will give George Avery
and Dick Williams a chance to
work on the mound today against
the Saeramentans. Avery pitched
nine innings Friday in whipping
Santa Clara, bul Williams lasted
only one-third of a frame against
USC in the second game before
he was pounded for six runs on
six hits.
No Loop Games
The Indians will get the week
off from CIBA competition a
fortunate thing in view of the
newly-revised lineup. In addition
to today's Sac State game, the
Tribe will face San Jose State in
a home-and-home series Friday
and Saturday.
In a midweek game next week
Stanford will meet College of the
Pacific. The CIBA fireworks be
gin anew on April 25. when the
Cards go to Edwards Field for a
single game with California. The
following day they'll return lo the
Sunken Diamond for a twin bill
against UCLA.
Even at this early stage, it's be
ginning to look like USC will
have a cakewalk to the CIBA pen
nant. The Trojans have beaten
all of the loop's top clubs, and in
convincing fashion most of the
time.
Lest the Cards think ahead too
far to the CIBA chase and forget
today's game with Sacramento
State, all they have to remember
is that the capital team beat them
last year, 10-6.
