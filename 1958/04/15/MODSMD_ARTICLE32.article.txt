Stanford hits the mid-point of
its rigorous dual - meet track
schedule Saturday when it trav
els to Los Angeles to meet Occi
dental. From the track event
standpoint, the meet could be the
finest of the U.S. dual season.

Cobb, Maury Graves and Don
Chesarek.

fine group of 880 and mile men,

Saturday it was found that Lloyd
ran at least an 885-yard course.
lie started in lane three, and
was required to run the first 180
yards in that lane before he could
break for the pole. When there is
such a break point, the race
should lie run from a staggered
start.
Plans called for the staggered

start, but when Ihe race began,
the runners all started from the
same point. Coach Payton Jor
dan said he didn't notice the dis
crepancy until after the race be
gan.
Fortunately, the error didn't
cost Lloyd a record as he still
bettered the old Stanford mark
of 1:50.9. Ernie Cunliffe, the sec
ond - place man in an excellent
1:51.3, wasn't affected since he
was running in lane one.
