# LEAVES TRAIL
## Sputnik II Burns Out, Comes Down 
### 
MOSCOW (/P)—The Soviet Un
ion made it official last night:
The dog-carrying Sputnik II has
broken up and burned out on a
trail that led across Brazil.
An official Tass statement at
11:05 p.m. confirmed reports of
foreign observers that Sputnik 11,
which had whirled around the
globe more • than five months,
came to its end as it dropped into
denser layers of the earth's at
mosphere this morning.
The only earth satellites now
circling the world are American.
The United States has three aloft.
The satellite carried the first
living creature ever to fly into
space, a dog named Laika. The
dog died after a week of space
flight. Its body was burned up
along with the satellite in Sput
nik's final death dive.
Tass said available data indi
cated some of the satellite's parts
"were dispersed along a route
running in a southeasterly direc
tion over the small Antilles Is
lands, Brazil and the Atlantic
Ocean." It gave no specific hour
for the satellite's finish.
Scientists in both the East and
West had predicted Sputnik II
would plunge to its fiery end over
the weekend.
Observers at Cambridge, Mass.,
said the satellite apparently fell
over the West Indies. They said
a single sighting from Denver,
Colo., indicated the heavy rocket
motor of the man - made moon
might have made one more lap
around the earth.
Numerous watchers in the
West Indies reported thoy saw a
flaming object, overhead about
5:55 p.m. (PST) Sunday.
At the time of its launching, the
Russians said it weighed a half
ton. Smithsonian experts be
lieved, however, that reference
was to the weight of the dog and
instruments.
