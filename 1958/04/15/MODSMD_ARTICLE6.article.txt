# Goal Set for Two New Fraternity Clusters to Be Finished by 1960
## Four 50-Man Houses in Each Group With Central Kitchen 
### Barbara Hicks 
An extensive building program, designed to further the Univer
sity's policy for undergraduate men's housing and to strengthen fra
ternities, has l)een outlined by the Administration and the Interfra
ternity Council.
The plan is for the ultimate housing of the 24 fraternity chapters

in six groups, each consisting of
four separate 50 - man houses
served by a central kitchen.
The arrangement, originally
announced to fraternity members
March 4, 1957, has been developed
into a working plan, with the
goal of two units of four houses
each completed by 1960.
According to Jack Shepard, as
sociate general secretary, four
fraternities are actively raising
money for the housing program,
and the others are expected to
begin fund drives in the near fu
ture.
$300,000 a House
While the units will be Univer
sity - owned, fraternities and the
University will share the cost, an
estimated $300,000 per house.
Shepard explained that Univer
sity ownership solves the prob
lem of taxes: gifts given to the
University for housing are tax-de
ductible by the donors, whereas
gifts given directly to the frater
nities are not.
Stanford has agreed to invest
endowment funds up to one-half
of the total estimated costs, pro
vided the other half is made avail
able from gifts. The gift cam
paign, geared to the circum
stances of the individual houses,
has been, or will be, initiated by
the fraternities to secure the es
timated $150,000.
A survey of fraternity houses
showed that of the 24 houses, 18
need major structural and me
chanical work merely to bring
them up to modern code specifi
cations. This would require esti
mated expenditures ranging up
to $132,000 a house.
Seek Advice
In view of these difficulties,
Shepard said, several fraternities
came to the University for advice
and aid. The new plan was de
vised after consultation with the
Interfraternity Council, the Inter
fraternity Alumni Conference and
representatives, most of them fra
ternity men, from the Adminis
tration.
The University commissioned
John Carl Warnecke, San Fran
cisco, class of '41 and Zeta Psi, to
prepare the architectural concep
tion.
Individuality has been the key
theme in Warnecke's designs.
Among the plans to secure the
individuality desired by each fra
ternity are one-story and combi
nations of one- and two-story
structures; different entrances


A TYPICAL ROOM IN NEW FRATERNITY CLUSTER
For Two Men, With Separated Study, Sleeping Rooms
and exterior wall materials and a
variety of interior patios and
courtyards.
Shepard explained that as each
fraternity raises its building
funds, members will meet with
the architect and Administration
to design a house suitable for its
own needs.
A number of floor plans have
been drawn by Warnecke. In
each the size of living rooms, din
ing rooms, kitchenettes, libraries
and study-bedrooms are the same,
but the arrangement of rooms
varies. Floor space will average
about 13,500 square feet per
house, including a one-fourth al
lowance for central kitchen and
storage areas, but not including
courts and other developed out
door spaces. This compares to an
average of 9,890 square feet in
the existing houses, including
basements.

l University policy will ho to
give each fraternity the greatest
! practicable autonomy. Fraternity
house managers will be billed
quarterly the amount of board
and room established by the Uni
versity, compa r a b 1 e to the
charges in other University resi
dences. The house manager will
be responsible for collecting from
each member and each house will
be responsible for housekeeping
within each fraternily.
Room and board rates will be
! established on the basis of 90 per
cent occupancy.
"With this incentive to get
I more members in order to lower
I the cost, we foresee no problems
in filling the houses." Craig said.
Craig calls the new program an
"expression of confidence in the
fraternities."
University officials hope to
have all fraternities in new hous
ing within 20 years.
