# Goal Set for Two New Fraternity Clusters to Be Finished by 1960
## Four 50-Man Houses in Each Group With Central Kitchen 
### Barbara Hicks 
An extensive building program, designed to further the Univer
sity's policy for undergraduate men's housing and to strengthen fra
ternities, has l)een outlined by the Administration and the Interfra
ternity Council.
The plan is for the ultimate housing of the 24 fraternity chapters

in six groups, each consisting of
four separate 50 - man houses
served by a central kitchen.
The arrangement, originally
announced to fraternity members
March 4, 1957, has been developed
into a working plan, with the
goal of two units of four houses
each completed by 1960.
According to Jack Shepard, as
sociate general secretary, four
fraternities are actively raising
money for the housing program,
and the others are expected to
begin fund drives in the near fu
ture.
$300,000 a House
While the units will be Univer
sity - owned, fraternities and the
University will share the cost, an
estimated $300,000 per house.
Shepard explained that Univer
sity ownership solves the prob
lem of taxes: gifts given to the
University for housing are tax-de
ductible by the donors, whereas
gifts given directly to the frater
nities are not.
Stanford has agreed to invest
endowment funds up to one-half
of the total estimated costs, pro
vided the other half is made avail
able from gifts. The gift cam
paign, geared to the circum
stances of the individual houses,
has been, or will be, initiated by
the fraternities to secure the es
timated $150,000.
A survey of fraternity houses
showed that of the 24 houses, 18
need major structural and me
chanical work merely to bring
them up to modern code specifi
cations. This would require esti
mated expenditures ranging up
to $132,000 a house.
Seek Advice
In view of these difficulties,
Shepard said, several fraternities
came to the University for advice
and aid. The new plan was de
vised after consultation with the
Interfraternity Council, the Inter
fraternity Alumni Conference and
representatives, most of them fra
ternity men, from the Adminis
tration.
The University commissioned
John Carl Warnecke, San Fran
cisco, class of '41 and Zeta Psi, to
prepare the architectural concep
tion.
Individuality has been the key
theme in Warnecke's designs.
Among the plans to secure the
individuality desired by each fra
ternity are one-story and combi
nations of one- and two-story
structures; different entrances
