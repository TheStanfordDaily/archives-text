# Why A-Tests Should Stop

testing. Today's article deals
primarily with the dangers.)

"The |nuclear| bomb tests that
have been detonated so far will
have ultimately caused the deaths
of one million persons ... 10 or 20
or 30 years earlier than their life
span because the radiation has
caused bone cancer, leukemia, or
some other disease.
"These bomb tests will also
cause the births of 200,000 seri
ously defective children in the
next generation of human be
ings."
This statement by Dr. Linus
Pauling strenuously opposes nu
clear weapons testing for any
reason.
"I do not think that you have
sufficient information to make a
decision on a scientific basis"—
Dr. David Regnery, Stanford ge
neticist, who suggests that bomb
testing is a moral question, with
no sure, scientific answer.
Genetic Dangers
Radioactive fallout from bomb
tests is undoubtedly endangering
the world's health to some extent.
A simple example of the ge
netic dangers of bomb testing is
the effect of increased radiation
on human pigmentation (whether

a person is normally colored or
an albino).
Genes sometimes change, or
mutate, usually from dominant to
recessive. Recessive genes are
considered harmful. Geneticists
do not know what causes this
"spontaneous," or normal, muta
tion rate. But they do know that
ANY increase in radiation will
cause an increase in mutation—
of course causing a change in
hereditary patterns.
Fallout in U.S.
According to Dr. Willard Libby,
an AEG member, atomic testing
lias caused the average American
to receive only 5 per cent more
radiation than that amount which
he receives naturally from cosmic
rays, radiation in rocks, etc.
However, radiation from bomb
testing does not distribute itself
all over the world uniformly, but
falls concentratedly.
According to Dr. Libby, Amori
cans are exposed to more radio
activity than any other people.
The radiation count for San Fran-
Cisco's March rains was 200 times
the maximum safe radiation limit
for drinking water set by the
Atomic Energy Commission.
In addition to the genetic dan
ger, radioactive fallout can cause
death. One of the bomb-released
radioactive materials is strontium

90, similar to calcium. Plants take
in strontium 90 just as they would
otherwise take in calcium, and
the human digestive system does
likewise.
Fallout Causes Deaths
Thus a radioactive material be
comes embodied in'bone tissue,
causing bone cancer and leukemia
as well. The bone marrow is one
place where the body manufac
tures blood. But no one knows
how much strontium 90 is neces
sary to cause disease.
Even Dr. Libby, minimizing the
dangers of further bomb tests,
has said, "This does not mean
that certain numbers of people
will not he injured by radioactive
fallout radiations, even though
these numbers he very small rela
tive to the total population of the
world."
Dr. Pauling's 200,000 defective
children, or 10.000 leukemia cases,
seem Insignificant when compar
er! with the world's present popu
lation of over 2 1 !j billion.
Bomb testing does strengthen
the military position of the Unit
ed States. In the words of Dr.
Regnery. "The question is wheth
er testing the bombs is important
enough to warrant an unknown
amount of danger."
For the "hottest" radioactively
nation on earth, this is not an
academic question.

Genetic Dangers
Radioactive fallout from bomb
tests is undoubtedly endangering
the world's health to some extent.
A simple example of the ge
netic dangers of bomb testing is
the effect of increased radiation
on human pigmentation (whether

a person is normally colored or
an albino).
Genes sometimes change, or
mutate, usually from dominant to
recessive. Recessive genes are
considered harmful. Geneticists
do not know what causes this
"spontaneous," or normal, muta
tion rate. But they do know that
ANY increase in radiation will
cause an increase in mutation—
of course causing a change in
hereditary patterns.
Fallout in U.S.
According to Dr. Willard Libby,
an AEG member, atomic testing
lias caused the average American
to receive only 5 per cent more
radiation than that amount which
he receives naturally from cosmic
rays, radiation in rocks, etc.
However, radiation from bomb
testing does not distribute itself
all over the world uniformly, but
falls concentratedly.
According to Dr. Libby, Amori
cans are exposed to more radio
activity than any other people.
The radiation count for San Fran-
Cisco's March rains was 200 times
the maximum safe radiation limit
for drinking water set by the
Atomic Energy Commission.
In addition to the genetic dan
ger, radioactive fallout can cause
death. One of the bomb-released
radioactive materials is strontium

90, similar to calcium. Plants take
in strontium 90 just as they would
otherwise take in calcium, and
the human digestive system does
likewise.
Fallout Causes Deaths
Thus a radioactive material be
comes embodied in'bone tissue,
causing bone cancer and leukemia
as well. The bone marrow is one
place where the body manufac
tures blood. But no one knows
how much strontium 90 is neces
sary to cause disease.
Even Dr. Libby, minimizing the
dangers of further bomb tests,
has said, "This does not mean
that certain numbers of people
will not he injured by radioactive
fallout radiations, even though
these numbers he very small rela
tive to the total population of the
world."
