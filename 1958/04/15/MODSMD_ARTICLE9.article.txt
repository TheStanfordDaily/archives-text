# Berlin Univ. Has History of Freedom
## 
### 
Ton years of Communist fear and poverty coupled with a zeal
ous desire for freedom of education guided by democratic prin
ciples briefly characterize and describe the colorful history of the
Free University of Berlin.
At the end of World War II, Humboldt University (the fore
runner of the Free University* was reopened by the Russians in
East Berlin. Not long after this, a Communistic control was ex
erted over the university administration, its faculty and students.
The Soviet occupying forces refused to allow the Western
powers to join with them in administering the university; they
suppressed all anti-Communist movements on campus; they ex
pelled students for misbehavior; and many students mysteriously
disappeared.
Protest Meeting
Humboldt students, up in arms over their fight against Com
munist control, secretly held a meeting of protest and decided to
found a new university in the Western sector.
Help was sought and received from General Lucius Clay, Amer
ican military governor, and the students picked up what books and
belongings they could carry and moved across the city. There they
worked together to prepare buildings for the opening of their new
school.
In November, 1948, the first classes were opened at the Free
University of Berlin with 2000 students attending.
■Then the Berlin blockade and its crippling effects began. This
lack of contact with the outside world, plus lack of funds, books
and other educational facilities, resulted in a critical period for the
freedom-seeking students.
Stanford, which heard about the Free University's plight
through the Hoover Institute on War, Revolution and Peace, con
ducted a huge clothing drive in Palo Alto in 1918.
Enrollment Doubled
By the 1949-50 academic year, the Free University's enrollment
had more than doubled, to 5000—40 per cent of these having fled
from the East Berlin sector.
Essentials, such as food and clothing, were sharply lacking, and
little relief was supplied by the West Berlin government, although
it was doing all that it could under the existing conditions.
Stanford again responded in 1.949-50 and sent shoes, clothing,
leather, textbooks and money to the Free University students.
Since then, and especially as extremely critical conditions lessened,
the Free University has successfully struggled to obtain atrd up
hold its name.
Since its founding in 1951, the Berlin Affiliation Committee has
continued the close contact between Stanford and the Berlin Uni
versity, to the great benefit of both.
