# Stanford Show At World's Fair
## 
### 
When the World Fair opens in Brussels tomorrow it will feature
u 375-acre corner of Stanford the Stanford Industrial Park.
A color film showing the park and the life of its workers and
blown-up color transparencies of its buildings will be a part of the
exhibit, "Industrial Parks U.S.A."
The Stanford Industrial Park was described as the most "photo-

genie" of all by the co-sponsors of
the exhibit, the Society of Indus
trial Realtors and the Mobil
Overseas Oil Company.
The Russians got the propa
ganda jump Monday on World
Fair exhibits by unveiling their
spectacle for the pressâ€”a model
of Sputnik 11.
The United States came up
with some models of its own yes
terday, shapely and smiling U.S.
college girls who will escort visi
tors through the ultra-modern
U.S. pavilion.
Then the British won a point
with the press.
"Come," said British Commis
sioner General Sir John Balfour,
"there is nothing like a good glass
of beer in a British pub."
A six-minute continuous loop
film taken at Stanford will be
featured in the closing element
of the Industrial Park exhibit.
The architecture of the building
and the activity within and also
local residence areas will be dis
played.
The steps in the development
of a park will be illustrated,
starting with architect's render
ings and progressing to a 169-
square-foot model of a representa
tive park with colored lights. Al
together nine parks from the
more than 150 industrial parks
of this type in the United States
will be represented.
A brochure describing the ex
hibit in several languages will be
distributed; the first print order
for this brochure was for 1,000,-
000 copies.
Howard S. Cullman, U.S. Com
missioner General for the Fair,
has declared that the industrial
park exhibit demonstrated "the
most progressive trends in city
planning in America."
