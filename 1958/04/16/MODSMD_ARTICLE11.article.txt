# PAINTINGS SAVED
## Fire Perils Museum Treasures 
### 
NEW YORK (/P) â€”A spectacu
lar lunch-hour fire yesterday im
periled a fabulous treasure hoard
at the Museum of Modern Art, in
the fashionable heart of Man
hattan.
Four million dollars' worth of
art was saved. Only six paintings
valued at $IJ/2l J /2 million, were dam
aged, and all but one of these
were believed restorable.
Firemen wielded axes and di
rected hoses with amazing care
and precision, lest their lifesaving
efforts destroy irreplaceable ob
jects. Women museum employes,
their clothes wringing-wet from
the hoses, risked their lives to
carry pictures to safety.
One workman died in the fire.
Three women visitors were treat
ed for smoke poisoning. More
than a score of firemen were in
jured or overcome.
The blaze was confined to a
small area of the museum's sec
ond-floor gallery, where air condi
tioning work was under way.
The fire was under control in
less than an hour. But thick, over
powering smoke slogged the main
building and an adjoining annex
on West 53rd Street.
More than 500 persons fled the
smoke. Several women broke win
dows and prepared to leap from
upper floors as the smoke choked
and blinded them.
