struction bill.
Both measures have been advo
cated vigorously by Democrats as
weapons with which to fight the
recession. They have had some
strong GOP support, too.
Senators Monroney (D-Okla.),
Humphrey (D-Minn.) and Kefau
ver (D-Tenn.) promptly called for
a major drive to override Eisen
hower's turndown of the water
projects measure.
As for the highway bill, Sena

along despite some objections.
Knowland, the Senate Republi
can leader, told a news conference
he believes it is correct to say
that the advantages of the meas
ure outweigh in the President's
mind the features he considers ob
jectionable.
The water measure would not
have gone into effect immediate
ly, even if the President had sign
ed it. It would merely authorize
