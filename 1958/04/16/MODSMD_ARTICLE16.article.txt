# Premier Gaillard's Government Falls
## 
### 
PARIS (/P) —The government of
Premier Felix Gaillard fell last
night, brought down by a Na
tional Assembly attack on his Tu
nisian policies and their Ameri
can-British links.
The Assembly, echoing with
cries of anti-American sentiment,
rejected, 321 to 255, Gaillard's call
for acceptance of a U.S.-British
plan for settling the French-Tu
nisian dispute. Gaillard responded
immediately by resigning.
Gaillard's Statement
Announcing his action to re
porters, Gaillard said:
"In the present circumstances
it is in the country's interests
that the crisis which opened be
closed as rapidly as possible. . . .
Today we think of those overseas
who suffer, who fight and who
have confidence in France."
Gaillard, a 38-year-old Radical
Socialist who took the premier
ship little more than five months
ago, drove hatless and coatless to
the Elsyee Palace and handed his
resignation to President Rene
Coty.
Not Formal Motion
Though the vote was not on a
formal motion of confidence, Coly
did not try to persuade Gaillard
to hold fast and ride out (he de
feat. The margin apparently had
been too great for that.
Coty, 7t>, accepted the resigna
tion. He asked Gajllard, however,
to slay on as caretaker—the usual
procedure in such cases—until a
new government can be formed.
