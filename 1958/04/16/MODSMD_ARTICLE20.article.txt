Right• or Loft-IIand Flush
Editor, The Daily:
Notwithstanding whatever benefits the new
fraternity housing may or may not hold for fra
ternities, I think at least two inaccuracies in
Tuesday's article should be pointed out.
1. The cost of these "clusters" is in no way
being borne by the University. Whether a pres
ent payment or future amortization through
rent, the fraternities get stuck with the bill, and
the University acquires an extremely safe invest
ment at five per cent interest.
2. You infer that this plan originated with the
fraternities, was substantiated by impartial stud
ies and finally developed by University-IFC co
operation. In reality the plan was conceived and
developed (entirely unknown to the fraternities)
by the University and was substantiated by Uni
versity interpretation of relatively accurate en
gineering reports. The IFC then decided whether
the bathroom fixtures would have a right- or
left-hand flush.

Meaning of a 6 Book Community'
Editor, The Daily:
The April 1 article and editorial concerning
the availability of certain foreign language books
at our store rather than at the Stanford Book
store has been brought to my attention. The
editorial, it seems to me, may be unjustly harsh
in its criticism of the Stanford Bookstore.
Your editorial concludes, "It's hard to suggest
a solution, when no one seems to know just why
the Bookstore is the way it is." I would like to
suggest that the recent decision of the Germanic-
Romanic Languages Department may be a part
of the solution: to disperse somewhat the book
ordering among several bookstores so that the
entire burden is not placed on one store.
Until recently Stanford has been unique in the
country, according to the best information I can
find, in its attempt to satisfy the book needs of
a university community through only one book
outlet. For a good example of what is done else
where visit Ber keley and browse through a dozen
or more good and varied bookstores, including
the ASUC Bookstore on the Cal campus. Berke
ley has one of the finest book communities on
the West Coast, and it is a sorry reflection on
our community that too often Stanford people
have had to go to Berkeley to get the books
they need.
Last fall the Humanities and Sciences faculty
was informed that there is no University ruling
preventing faculty members from making avail
able their reading lists to local bookstores. It
was pointed out that, on the contrary, if local
booksellers were supplied such lists there was
a much greater likelihood of books being in suf

ficient supply whon classes convened. And it
goes without saying that if booksellers in the
community are stocking some of the books for
each course, the Stanford Bookstore will be
"backed up" in those cases where their supply is
insufficient. Obviously it is impossible to know
in advance the exact size of each class; moreover
there are a number of instances where Ihe Book
store has to hedge on the supply it puts in owing
to penalties imposed by publishers for "returns."
Sheer size will not solve this problem. You
could build the largest bookstore in the world
and still run out of any number of given titles at
the very moment they are needed most. In the
past the Bookstore personnel has been at the
mercy of such a situation and has had to bear
the brunt of the criticism. Yet, in a very real
sense the fault was not in the Bookstore's opera
tion but in the "system" which had grown up
whereby an attempt was made to supply all book
needs through one source.
The present Bookstore directorate is cognizant,
I am certain, of the past difficulties and is work
ing to overcome them. During the months ahead
efforts will be made to improve the service and
availability of books bolh on the campus and off
the campus. Working together co-operatively
there is every evidence that a genuine book com
munity will be developed able to serve the needs
of the University and of the surrounding popu
lation. Meanwhile, the question is not whether
some books were available in one store and some
in another—but that they were available. This
is what it means to have a book community.

Administration to Start Union?
Editor, The Daily:
I see that the Administration has once again
threatened to start construction on the new Un
ion. Every year since 1952 we have heard about
the new post office, the new Bookstore and the
new Union. Construction is always to start "at
once," or "next fall," or "very soon."
I hope that this time the new buildings will
actually be started. Everyone will hail the ar
rival of a bookstore with books, a Union with
facilities for the students and a post office larger
than the one at Gonzales, Calif.
I hope that soon, too, the Police Department
will note the thoughtful motorists who park
1heir cars across the white lines, instead of be
tween. About five per cent of the rare parking
places here are used by students who block two
spaces. Since the parking problem here is similar
to that of downtown Palo Alto, perhaps some of
1he officers who patrol the women's dorms could
be diverted to parking detail, particularly on
Ihe street in back of Memorial Hall.
