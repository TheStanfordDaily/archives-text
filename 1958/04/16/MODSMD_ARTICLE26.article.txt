To most viewers of Inst week's tennis matches between Stanford
anrl U( LA and USC it was just "another stay in old L.A.," with Stan
lord once again taking a tremendous trouncing on the scoreboard;
but to this observer it left much more of a glitter of hope than pre
vious trips to the Southland have produced. There were several
factors involved in the matches that left me with the opinion 1hat
when the Southlanders hit the Northern trail and venture over to
Stanford they might very well find the scores reversed on them.
Stanford undoubtedly has one of the best net squads that it has
had in many years, and there appears no reason why this squad
couldn't come out victorious against either UCLA or USC. Unfortu
nately, previous to last week end's trip Coach Boh Renker's troops
had been hindered quite a hit by rain which curtailed many important
early-season practices.
Along with this insufficient preparation, the Stanfordites had not
had tlie advantage of stiff pre-season competition which both the
southern schools had. While Stanford was whitewashing weak teams
like San Jose, California, Sacramento State and the rest in the North
ern California Championships, IJSC and UCLA were clashing head-on
for Southern California pre-season laurels. Even Stanford's Jack
Douglas, who has done quite a bit of tournament-hopping since Janu
ary, was not nearly as far along in his '58 development as his oppo
nents from Los Angeles.
Between now and May 16-17, when the Southlanders come North,
the Indians will have an opportunity to round into their top form
through many matches and such top tourneys as the O.jai Cham
pionships.
Another unfortunate disadvantage which faced the Indians, and
which faces many opponents of IJSC and UCLA, was a mental block.
UCLA and CSC have the reputation of being the perennial tennis
powers of the nation, and this psychologically defeats many of their
opponents. Granted they have top-notch material, but there is no
reason why they can't he defeated just as Oklahoma's football team
fell this year.
Stanford itself is loaded with good players. Douglas, needless to
say. might just find himself on the Davis Cup squad in the next two
years, and should be able to hold his own with any collegiate netter
around. Unfortunately he lacks a top-notch serve as of now, but is
receiving constant assistance on developing it and is perhaps the
fastest player around. This, along with his excellent ground strokes,
does a lot to make up for his weak serve.
If Brooks Rawlins, Stanford's second man, could develop a little
more endurance—something he's always lacked, but has had worse
luck with lately due to a case of mononucleosis—he could even be
come a formidable threat to Douglas' position. Against UCLA's John
Cranston, Rawlins won the opening set and looked great, but it took
so much out of him that he was too exhausted to give the match any
more. Maybe by May 16th he'll be ready to go three entire sets.
Nelson's Play Best of Trip
Perhaps one of the brightest features of the trip to Los Angeles
was Saturday's play by Dave Nelson. Nelson has always had a tre
mendous potential as a tennis player, but. has never really shown
anything but inconsistent inklings of stardom. Again-st USC's Jim
Buck, Nelson played a top match, making every shot count. If he
continues to follow his serve (which is perhaps the best in the con
ference) with consistently good net volleys as he did Saturday, there
is no reason why he shouldn't become a consistent winner for Coach
Renker.
After Nelson, Stanford has Lowell Carruth and Jim Jeffries in
the 4 and 5 spots, with Gil White and Robin Hilgeman splitting the
No. 6 chores.
Carruth has improved more than any other Stanford netter dur
ing his first two and one-haif years on The Farm, and should improve
even more between now and May 16th. He lacks the needed experi
ence against top competition such as he met in Los Angeles, and he
also needs to learn to control an easily excitable temper. But he
seems to do better with each outing, and, even though he may be a
year from any kind of stardom, he still presents stiff competition
for Indian foes.
Jim Jeffries, the biggest man on the squad, has more power on
his ground strokes than probably any of his opponents will show,
but he's a sophomore who is still a little green and who has always
been too slow afoot. He rarely tires and if he can begin to lose his
double faultitis and pick up some speed, he very definitely will begin
to win as he did last year when he went undefeated on the frosh
squad. He took UCLA's Franklin Johnson three sets and had in
numerable opportunities to sew up the match before he lost it.
Gil White is a three-year veteran whose experience and court
savvy give him the nod as sixth man with sophomore Robin Hilue
man close at his heels. Both these men are almost sure winners
against even USC's and UCLA's sixth position, and are perhaps the
strongest sixth men in Stanford's tennis history.
In order to beat the Southlanders next time around the Indians
doubles combos will have to improve, but every sign points toward
their doing this. The first two combos of Rawlins-Douglas and Nel
son-Carrnth, who showed almost nothing against UCLA, came back
the next day to each go three sets against formidable SC opponents.
Two more weeks of playing together and these teams will be equal
tf> SC's challenge and fairly close to the stronger UCLA combo.

anrl U( LA and USC it was just "another stay in old L.A.," with Stan
lord once again taking a tremendous trouncing on the scoreboard;
but to this observer it left much more of a glitter of hope than pre
vious trips to the Southland have produced. There were several
factors involved in the matches that left me with the opinion 1hat
when the Southlanders hit the Northern trail and venture over to
Stanford they might very well find the scores reversed on them.
Stanford undoubtedly has one of the best net squads that it has
had in many years, and there appears no reason why this squad
couldn't come out victorious against either UCLA or USC. Unfortu
nately, previous to last week end's trip Coach Boh Renker's troops
had been hindered quite a hit by rain which curtailed many important
early-season practices.
Along with this insufficient preparation, the Stanfordites had not
had tlie advantage of stiff pre-season competition which both the
southern schools had. While Stanford was whitewashing weak teams
like San Jose, California, Sacramento State and the rest in the North
ern California Championships, IJSC and UCLA were clashing head-on
for Southern California pre-season laurels. Even Stanford's Jack
Douglas, who has done quite a bit of tournament-hopping since Janu
ary, was not nearly as far along in his '58 development as his oppo
nents from Los Angeles.
Between now and May 16-17, when the Southlanders come North,
the Indians will have an opportunity to round into their top form
through many matches and such top tourneys as the O.jai Cham
pionships.
Another unfortunate disadvantage which faced the Indians, and
which faces many opponents of IJSC and UCLA, was a mental block.
UCLA and CSC have the reputation of being the perennial tennis
powers of the nation, and this psychologically defeats many of their
opponents. Granted they have top-notch material, but there is no
reason why they can't he defeated just as Oklahoma's football team
fell this year.
Stanford itself is loaded with good players. Douglas, needless to
say. might just find himself on the Davis Cup squad in the next two
years, and should be able to hold his own with any collegiate netter
around. Unfortunately he lacks a top-notch serve as of now, but is
receiving constant assistance on developing it and is perhaps the
fastest player around. This, along with his excellent ground strokes,
does a lot to make up for his weak serve.
If Brooks Rawlins, Stanford's second man, could develop a little
more endurance—something he's always lacked, but has had worse
luck with lately due to a case of mononucleosis—he could even be
come a formidable threat to Douglas' position. Against UCLA's John
Cranston, Rawlins won the opening set and looked great, but it took
so much out of him that he was too exhausted to give the match any
more. Maybe by May 16th he'll be ready to go three entire sets.
Nelson's Play Best of Trip
Perhaps one of the brightest features of the trip to Los Angeles
was Saturday's play by Dave Nelson. Nelson has always had a tre
mendous potential as a tennis player, but. has never really shown
anything but inconsistent inklings of stardom. Again-st USC's Jim
Buck, Nelson played a top match, making every shot count. If he
continues to follow his serve (which is perhaps the best in the con
ference) with consistently good net volleys as he did Saturday, there
is no reason why he shouldn't become a consistent winner for Coach
Renker.
After Nelson, Stanford has Lowell Carruth and Jim Jeffries in
the 4 and 5 spots, with Gil White and Robin Hilgeman splitting the
No. 6 chores.
Carruth has improved more than any other Stanford netter dur
ing his first two and one-haif years on The Farm, and should improve
even more between now and May 16th. He lacks the needed experi
ence against top competition such as he met in Los Angeles, and he
also needs to learn to control an easily excitable temper. But he
seems to do better with each outing, and, even though he may be a
year from any kind of stardom, he still presents stiff competition
for Indian foes.
Jim Jeffries, the biggest man on the squad, has more power on
his ground strokes than probably any of his opponents will show,
but he's a sophomore who is still a little green and who has always
been too slow afoot. He rarely tires and if he can begin to lose his
double faultitis and pick up some speed, he very definitely will begin
to win as he did last year when he went undefeated on the frosh
squad. He took UCLA's Franklin Johnson three sets and had in
numerable opportunities to sew up the match before he lost it.
Gil White is a three-year veteran whose experience and court
savvy give him the nod as sixth man with sophomore Robin Hilue
man close at his heels. Both these men are almost sure winners
against even USC's and UCLA's sixth position, and are perhaps the
strongest sixth men in Stanford's tennis history.
In order to beat the Southlanders next time around the Indians
doubles combos will have to improve, but every sign points toward
their doing this. The first two combos of Rawlins-Douglas and Nel
son-Carrnth, who showed almost nothing against UCLA, came back
the next day to each go three sets against formidable SC opponents.
Two more weeks of playing together and these teams will be equal
tf> SC's challenge and fairly close to the stronger UCLA combo.

lord once again taking a tremendous trouncing on the scoreboard;
but to this observer it left much more of a glitter of hope than pre
vious trips to the Southland have produced. There were several
factors involved in the matches that left me with the opinion 1hat
when the Southlanders hit the Northern trail and venture over to
Stanford they might very well find the scores reversed on them.
Stanford undoubtedly has one of the best net squads that it has
had in many years, and there appears no reason why this squad
couldn't come out victorious against either UCLA or USC. Unfortu
nately, previous to last week end's trip Coach Boh Renker's troops
had been hindered quite a hit by rain which curtailed many important
early-season practices.
Along with this insufficient preparation, the Stanfordites had not
had tlie advantage of stiff pre-season competition which both the
southern schools had. While Stanford was whitewashing weak teams
like San Jose, California, Sacramento State and the rest in the North
ern California Championships, IJSC and UCLA were clashing head-on
for Southern California pre-season laurels. Even Stanford's Jack
Douglas, who has done quite a bit of tournament-hopping since Janu
ary, was not nearly as far along in his '58 development as his oppo
nents from Los Angeles.
Between now and May 16-17, when the Southlanders come North,
the Indians will have an opportunity to round into their top form
through many matches and such top tourneys as the O.jai Cham
pionships.
Another unfortunate disadvantage which faced the Indians, and
which faces many opponents of IJSC and UCLA, was a mental block.
UCLA and CSC have the reputation of being the perennial tennis
powers of the nation, and this psychologically defeats many of their
opponents. Granted they have top-notch material, but there is no
reason why they can't he defeated just as Oklahoma's football team
fell this year.
Stanford itself is loaded with good players. Douglas, needless to
say. might just find himself on the Davis Cup squad in the next two
years, and should be able to hold his own with any collegiate netter
around. Unfortunately he lacks a top-notch serve as of now, but is
receiving constant assistance on developing it and is perhaps the
fastest player around. This, along with his excellent ground strokes,
does a lot to make up for his weak serve.
If Brooks Rawlins, Stanford's second man, could develop a little
more endurance—something he's always lacked, but has had worse
luck with lately due to a case of mononucleosis—he could even be
come a formidable threat to Douglas' position. Against UCLA's John
Cranston, Rawlins won the opening set and looked great, but it took
so much out of him that he was too exhausted to give the match any
more. Maybe by May 16th he'll be ready to go three entire sets.
Nelson's Play Best of Trip
Perhaps one of the brightest features of the trip to Los Angeles
was Saturday's play by Dave Nelson. Nelson has always had a tre
mendous potential as a tennis player, but. has never really shown
anything but inconsistent inklings of stardom. Again-st USC's Jim
Buck, Nelson played a top match, making every shot count. If he
continues to follow his serve (which is perhaps the best in the con
ference) with consistently good net volleys as he did Saturday, there
is no reason why he shouldn't become a consistent winner for Coach
Renker.
After Nelson, Stanford has Lowell Carruth and Jim Jeffries in
the 4 and 5 spots, with Gil White and Robin Hilgeman splitting the
No. 6 chores.
Carruth has improved more than any other Stanford netter dur
ing his first two and one-haif years on The Farm, and should improve
even more between now and May 16th. He lacks the needed experi
ence against top competition such as he met in Los Angeles, and he
also needs to learn to control an easily excitable temper. But he
seems to do better with each outing, and, even though he may be a
year from any kind of stardom, he still presents stiff competition
for Indian foes.
Jim Jeffries, the biggest man on the squad, has more power on
his ground strokes than probably any of his opponents will show,
but he's a sophomore who is still a little green and who has always
been too slow afoot. He rarely tires and if he can begin to lose his
double faultitis and pick up some speed, he very definitely will begin
to win as he did last year when he went undefeated on the frosh
squad. He took UCLA's Franklin Johnson three sets and had in
numerable opportunities to sew up the match before he lost it.
Gil White is a three-year veteran whose experience and court
savvy give him the nod as sixth man with sophomore Robin Hilue
man close at his heels. Both these men are almost sure winners
against even USC's and UCLA's sixth position, and are perhaps the
strongest sixth men in Stanford's tennis history.
In order to beat the Southlanders next time around the Indians
doubles combos will have to improve, but every sign points toward
their doing this. The first two combos of Rawlins-Douglas and Nel
son-Carrnth, who showed almost nothing against UCLA, came back
the next day to each go three sets against formidable SC opponents.
Two more weeks of playing together and these teams will be equal
tf> SC's challenge and fairly close to the stronger UCLA combo.
