# Frosh Baseballers Host Capuchino
## 
### 
Going after their third straight
win, the Stanford freshman base
ballers will take on Capuchino
High School today at 3:15 p.m. on
the frosh diamond. Stanford will
pitch left-hander Terry Lindeman
for three innings, then Earl Rus

sell for three, with Dave Carter
finishing the game.
Capuchino is regarded as the
toughest opposition that the Pa
pooses will face before the Cal
frosh, so this afternoon's contest
should bo a good one.
