# Con Home Provides Medical Care, Schooling
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
A goal of $12,000 has been set
by the Con Home Committee for
this year's drive, April 28 through
May 2. The money collected will
enable some of the 80 children
in the Convalescent Home to at
tain a normal, healthy life again.
The children, all under 12 years
of age, are convalescing from
such non-communicable diseases
as rheumatic fever, polio and
malnutrition.
Begun in 1917 by University
Chaplain Dr. D. Charles Gardner
as the "Campus Auxiliary to
Stanford Clinics," the Convales
cent Home, a private institution,
Is the only charity hospital in the
U.S. which is located on a college
campus.
Phi Sig House
When the Home first began, it
was located in what now is the
house of the Phi Sigma Kappa
fraternity. Originally, children
were brought from San Francisco
to the campus for a week or two
in the summer. In 1919 the Home
was moved to the house and
grounds of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. In addition, it was giv
en an endowment of $100,000 from
Mrs. Henry Crocker, Mrs. Timo
thy Hopkins, Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, Mrs. Charles B. Lathrop,
Mrs. Herbert Hoover and Selah
Chamberlain.
Four years following the move,
McLaughlin, the boys' bed unit,
was added. In 1929 a $40,000 aux
iliary unit was built, which ac
commodates 80 children. Finally,
the administration building was
completed five years ago.
The "Con Home" is supported
entirely by trust funds, drives
sponsored by junior auxiliaries
and the Stanford student body
druing the annual "Con Home
Week."
Medical Care
Medical care is donated to the
children by a staff of Palo Alto
pediatricians; some children have
their own doctors attend them.
Dental care is given by a visiting
children's dental specialist.
In addition to medical care, the
children receive regular class
room instruction from kindergar
ten through the sixth grade. The
educational program is under the
joint supervision of the San Fran
cisco School Department and the
Palo Alto Board of Education and
is partially supported by state
funds.
Each child is provided with rec
reation. This is integrated with
the Home's occupational therapy
program.
Playgtound facilities are pro
vided. In addition, music appre
ciation and dancing lessons fur
nish a chance for talent outlets.
A scouting program — including
Cub Scouts, Brownies and Boy
and Girl Scouts—is also function
ing.
