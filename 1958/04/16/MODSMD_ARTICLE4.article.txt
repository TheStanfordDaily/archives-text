# Major Declaration Required of Sophs Before Autumn Pre-Registration Begins
## 
### 
General Studies students who
will have completed two years of
college work at the end of this
quarter must declare majors be
fore pre-registration time if they
have not already done so, accord
ing to the General Studies Com
mittee. Declaration of majors
may be made at the General
Studies Office, .Room 111-D. Inner

Quad, beginning Monday, April
21.
Sophomores who have not de
clared majors by the regular pre
registration time. May 26-30, will
not be permitted to pre-register
until they do so.
Students are permitted to
change majors at any time, ac
cording to the General Studies
Office, and sophomore General
Studies studets who declare ma
jors this quarter will be permit
ted to changc them later if they
wish.
However, according to the Gen
eral Studies Office, students who
declare new majors in their jun
ior or senior year often have
their graduation delayed for one
or more quarters by scheduling
and requirement problems. The
General Studies Committee re
quires students to declare their
majors before their junior year
to avoid this problem.
Students who will complete two
years of undergraduate work and
who are still undecided should not
pre-register, according to the Gen
eral Studies Office. It is impor
tant for these students to receive
the assistance of their depart
mental advisers before preparing
for their junior year.
To declare majors, a student
should go to the General Studies
Office, Room 111-D, after Mon

day, April 21, to obtain a green
slip for change of major. The
next step is to take the green slip
to the transcript desk, Room
111-A, where the transcript clerk
prepares a grade sheet for the
student.
The student then takes the
green slip and grade sheet to the
department or program of his
choice and the department will
assign him to a departmental ad
viser. The student then reports
back to the General Studies Of
fice with the name of his depart
ment or program adviser.
