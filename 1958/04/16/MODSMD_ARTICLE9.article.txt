# Photographers Explain Death Valley Wildlife
## 
### Bob Latham 
Ralph Welles, National Park Service photographer, spoke to a
capacity Tuesday Evening Series audience last night about the wild
life in "Death Valley the Year Around."
His wife, Florence, collaborated with him and took many of the
excellent color slides of the geography and wild life of Death Valley
! shown with the lecture.

Before becoming a photogra
pher, Welles was the supervising
director of the Palo Alto Commu
nity Theater for 18 years, and
while in this capacity he served
as a lecturer in the University's
Speech and Drama Department.
Welles pointed out, and his
slides were beautiful proof, that
there is actually a great deal of
varied wild life even in the valley
where summer days of 120-130 de
grees are common. According to
Welles, there are 600 different
species of plants, 230 of birds, 40
of mammals ,37 reptiles and three
different species of fish in the re
gion.
Welles showed several slides of
the rare bighorn sheep, including
unique closeups of a fight be
tween two rams. It was only
after a search of eight years that
they were rewarded with the ob
servance, and their pictures of the
ferocious battle are, Welles said,
probably the only ones in exist
ence.
