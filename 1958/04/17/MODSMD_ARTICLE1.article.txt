Editor, The Daily:
A group of us has become
concerned over the dangers of
continued nuclear bomb testing.
This concern is centered in two
areas:
1) The biological effects of
radiation from continued nu
clear explosions. The Atomic
Energy Commission now admits
that radioactive fallout is a mat
ter of genuine concern, and that
the United States is the hottest
radioactive place in the world.
The recent petition of 923j sci
entists, including 36 Nobel lau
reates, to the United Nations
emphasizes the scientific evi
dence for such concern.
2) The political aspects of

continued tests. Such tests ham
per progress toward internation
al agreements on this crucial
issue.
World opinion is forming; it
is imperative that action he tak
en now. We feel it is particu
larly important that university
communities take an active part
in such issues; this has been
their historical role, yet one
which is often lacking on Ameri
can campuses.
Because of this concern we
intend to make a standing pro
test against continued nuclear
tests today in front of the Li
brary, from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30
p.m. In addition tq posters, we
will have leaflets, prepared by

students after considerable re
search. A table with stationery
and a Congressional Directory
for writing letters to congress
men will be available, as well as
a petition to the President. The
protest's tone will be quiet and
dignified, in keeping with the
University's atmosphere.
Our objective is this: we wish
to help bring this issue to the
awareness of the campus com
munity and the country. As in
dividuals, we possess various po
litical beliefs; we act in har
mony only in an effort to pro
t e s t continued nuclear bomb
tests. This protest is our own;
it has no affiliation with any or
ganization or similar endeavor.
We invite all students to read

our literature and discuss the
issue with us. Silence gives con
sent. We invite those who agree
with us to join us—

continued tests. Such tests ham

World opinion is forming; it
is imperative that action he tak

communities take an active part

their historical role, yet one
which is often lacking on Ameri

Because of this concern we
intend to make a standing pro
test against continued nuclear
tests today in front of the Li

p.m. In addition tq posters, we
will have leaflets, prepared by

a petition to the President. The
protest's tone will be quiet and
dignified, in keeping with the

Our objective is this: we wish
to help bring this issue to the
awareness of the campus com

tests. This protest is our own;
it has no affiliation with any or

We invite all students to read

Editor, The Daily:
A group of us has become
concerned over the dangers of
continued nuclear bomb testing.
This concern is centered in two
areas:
1) The biological effects of
radiation from continued nu
clear explosions. The Atomic
Energy Commission now admits
that radioactive fallout is a mat
ter of genuine concern, and that
the United States is the hottest
radioactive place in the world.
The recent petition of 923j sci
entists, including 36 Nobel lau

emphasizes the scientific evi
dence for such concern.
