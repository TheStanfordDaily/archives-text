# U.S. Faces Dilemma On A-Tests
## 
### Roger Folsom 
(Editor's Note: This is the
second of a series of articles to
present views on the contro
versy over nuclear bomb tests.)

The question of continuing nu
clear bomb tests must be decided
on the simple basis of whether
the advantages of testing out
weigh the disadvantages or vice
versa. The relative merits of uni
lateral, bilateral, or even milli
lateral agreements are a second
ary consideration—relevant only
if we decide that we really want
to stop tests.
Though radioactive fallout from
nuclear tests is endangering the
world's health to some "unknown
degree," there are additional dis
advantages.
Continued explosions by the
United States—which always pub
licizes its tests, in contrast to the
secret tests in the Soviet Union—
are alienating millions of people
all over the world, who have come
to doubt that any nation which
continues tests could , really be
working for peace.
Test Advantages
On the other hand, the tests are
only one phase of weapons devel
opment. Walter Lippmann sum
marized in Monday's Daily the po
s i t.i on of people favoring the
tests: without nuclear weapons
the military position of the West
would be vastly inferior to that
of the East with its large man
power reserves.
Although we have a large nu
clear bomb stockpile, it is main
ta i ne d that we must develop
smaller, "clean" weapons with lit
tle radioactive fallout. It is im
practical to use a huge H-bomb,
with a large amount of fallout,
against troop concentrations that
are near our own troops. Radio
activity drifts with the wind—not
with one's intentions.
We also need more controllable
bombs (to use against Russia if
she should invade Europe) which
would not obliterate the nations
that we were "liberating."
Supporters of the tests argue,
with considerable justification,
that a "cleaner" bomb is more
humane than a "dirty" bomb—it
only blows things up and has less
tendency to pollute civilian life
for generations. Tests are neces
sary to develop such a bomb.
Bilateral Agreements
Should it be agreed that the dis
advantages of tests very greatly
outweigh the advantages, it would
be a simple matter to stop testing
ourselves and to ignore what Rus
sia should choose to do. This is
known as unilateral test cessa
tion.
Of course, it has been felt, nec
essary to have all atomic powers
stop testing at once, so that no
nation would gain an advantage
from continued development
while the other nations fell be
hind. This is the so-called bilateral
agreement to stop tests. Actually,
however, a trilateral agreement
would be necessary: there are
throe atomic powers—the United
States, Russia and Great Britain.
On March 30, Premier Khru
shchev said that temporarily the
Soviet Union would not test any
more nuclear weapons —it was
unilaterally stopping tests but if
the West did not follow suit, Rus
sia would feel free to resume
tests.
