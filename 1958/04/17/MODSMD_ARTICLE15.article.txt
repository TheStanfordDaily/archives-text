# To Kill the Many
## 
### 
The question of halting nuclear weapons test
ing hinges not only on the humanitarian con
sideration of the harmful effects such tests may
have on man's health but also on the political
issue of their efficacy in preventing war.
The testimony 011 the ability of radioactive
fallout from H-bomb tests to kill or deform
the world's populace is confusing and contra
dictory, to say the least. Linus Pauling and
others claim the bomb tests already completed
will cause the premature death of millions.
Other equally informed and reliable scientists
say the fallout danger from tests is relatively
small.
But all agree that some danger exists. The
only argument is on how <ircat the danger is—
on how many people will die or how many
babies will be born disfigured.
Politicians and military experts are cogni
zant of the testing dangers but are apparently
willing to accept them in order to prevent war.
A million people, they argue, is a handful when
balanced against the world's population of two
and one-half billion.
If a million people eould he sacrificed to save

the rest of the world from destruction, this
argument might have some weight. But an
arms race has never produced peace and never
will. We cannot balance one group against
another. If the nuclear weapons mania con
tinues, all mankind will eventually find itself
balanced on the same side of the scale as are
the sacrificed "handful."
The world itself may be sacrificed, bit by
bit, million by million, until nothing is left but
the seats of government —still fighting it out
from their underground radiation shelters.
Nuclear testing has nothing to do with ideol
ogies. It cannot be related to the struggle be
tween Communism and democracy, a basically
economic battle.
The main cause of the nuclear arms race is
mutual fear —a phenomenon which in the
world's history has repeatedly led to war.
Nuclear tests and the arms race in general
must be stopped—before we are forever com
mitted to this carnage, this destruction, this
appalling waste of money, energy and human
life, through which we sacrifice the few to be
able to kill the nianv.
