# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## Undoing a Mistake 
### Walter Lippmann 
This week there will be preparatory talks
dealing with the question of how to get ready
to prepare for a meeting, face to face at the
summit, between President Eisenhower and Pre
mier Khrushchev. Both sides know that there is
no prospect whatever of any substantial agree
ment at such a meeting. And yet, as the cards
have been dealt, the Soviet Union will score
heavily if we can be induced by the pressure of
public opinion to agree to hold a meeting. This
means that somehow or other we have been out
maneuvered and are being pushed into doing
what we do not want to do.
With hindsight, I think it is now fairly plain
why and where we made the mistake when a few
months ago the Russians first proposed a meet
ing at the summit. There were two alternative
ways of reacting to their proposal. One was to
take it lightly, and the other was to take it very
seriously. To take it lightly would have been to
say that we were ready for exploratory talks
without prospect or pretense that a good settle
ment could or would eome out of these talks.
They would be talks which might, at the most,
result in agreements to instruct the foreign min
isters to explore certain questions.
On the other hand, to take the Soviet proposal
of a summit meeting seriously was to take the
line we did take. It was to say that Eisenhower
cannot talk with Khrushchev until Secretary
Dulles has negotiated with Foreign Minister Gro
myko something important which Eisenhower
and Khrushchev can then agree upon.
# #
Tliis serious reaction has proved to he a false
move. The basic fact is that on neither side is
there at present any willingness to concede any
thing substantial. Our tactic has made it neces
sary for Dulles to he.the opposition to a summit

meeting. Yet much of the world is thinking
wishfully that the President, once he got into a
personal meeting, would prove to be flexible and
conciliatory.
The Russians, who in all matters of substance
are as unyielding as Dulles, are making the most
of the notion that with Eisenhower personally
something might be done to relax the tensions
of the world. The fact is that something might
be done, given Eisenhower's temperamental de
sire to agree with the man he is seeing. But that
is one of the powerful though unavowed reasons
for the American opposition to a summit con
ference.
*
Is it too late to alter our tactic, and to take
what I have been calling the lighter view of the
Soviet proposal? Why should it be too late? Is
it because we have built up the impression that
if there is a summit meeting at all, it will mean
that Dulles lias negotiated some sort of impor
tant agreement with the Soviet Union? There is
such an impression. The impression could be
erased quickly enough if the President were to
say that there has been enough note-writing, and
that he is prepared to go with Secretary Dulles
to meet Khrushchev and Gromyko, say, on board
a ship and for not more than a long week end —he
would like to discuss at this meeting the possi
bility of another ami longer meeting later on.
I do not see what would be lost by such a move.
Would Prime Minister Macmillan and Premier
Gaillard object? Surely they would know that
nothing would be agreed to behind their backs.
Would the move relax tensions and cause the
United States and the NATO allies, as it is com
monly said, to "lower their guard"? If il did that,
the only thing to say is that we are all such fools
anyhow that we are not fit to survive.
