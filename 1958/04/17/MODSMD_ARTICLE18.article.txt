A Giant Stej> Toward Agreement
Editor, The Daily:
As American citizens we question the advisability of the continued
testing of nuclear weapons, because we believe that such testing in
creases the likelihood of war and exposes the people of the world to
the genetic and somatic hazards of radioactive fallout.
We are convinced that the dangers of continued testing far out
weigh any of its possible advantages. We believe that an agreement
to cease testing will be a giant step forward toward disarmament
and international agreement.
We, therefore, urge that the United States, Great Britain, and tlie
Soviet Union abandon the testing of nuclear weapons and institute
effective control procedures under the supervision of the United Na
tions.
We are pleased to support the Stanford students who are protest
ing the continuance of testing. We are also pleased to learn that many
students are giving serious consideration to this crucial issue. We feel
that by so doing they are discharging their responsibility as students
and citizens to keep themselves informed, to disseminate information,
and to participate actively in the decision-making process of a demo
cratic society.

Fraternities Have JVo Choice
Editor, The Daily:
During rushing I have found many fraternity men opposed to the
new fraternity housing system. The fraternities have "approved"
only because the University has left them no choice.
A few changes in the system would make it more palatable to me
and to other fraternity men. First, give each house its own kitchen.
Central kitchens mean mass production and steam tables. Eating
clubs have the finest food on campus as a result of small-scale cook
ing. Why not have the same system for the new fraternities?
Next, allow the individual houses to handle their own commis
saries, as they do now. The charge by the University on the basis
of 90 per cent occupancy only destroys individual responsibility and
substitutes paternalism for independence.
Finally, there must be guarantees by the University against
seizure of the houses or dumping unwanted individuals in to fill
occupancy quotas. The latter would only wipe out fraternities on
this campus a goal dear to the hearts of the Administration.

Blind Inconsistency
Editor, The Daily:
In your recent series on suicide you have made human tragedy
a simple routine that can be patched up by the words of a few well
intentioned counselors. In our modern culture it seems that we must
sacrifice a quota of fellow human beings on the cross of morality.
The problem is much greater than any single adviser is able to
penetrate. The anxieties formed by our ambivalent attitudes toward
sex and morals ereale a pit for most conscientious, oversensitive
individuals to fall into.
We must reorganize our personal views and attitudes toward the
actions of others and understand their motivations. A few strategi
cally-placed synthetic sympathizers are not enough. Stanford's Fun
damental Standard epitomizes the blind inconsistency of the moral
spokesmen of our society.

Fraternities Have JVo Choice
Editor, The Daily:
During rushing I have found many fraternity men opposed to the
new fraternity housing system. The fraternities have "approved"
only because the University has left them no choice.
A few changes in the system would make it more palatable to me
and to other fraternity men. First, give each house its own kitchen.
Central kitchens mean mass production and steam tables. Eating
clubs have the finest food on campus as a result of small-scale cook
ing. Why not have the same system for the new fraternities?
Next, allow the individual houses to handle their own commis
saries, as they do now. The charge by the University on the basis
of 90 per cent occupancy only destroys individual responsibility and
substitutes paternalism for independence.
Finally, there must be guarantees by the University against
seizure of the houses or dumping unwanted individuals in to fill
occupancy quotas. The latter would only wipe out fraternities on
this campus a goal dear to the hearts of the Administration.

Blind Inconsistency
Editor, The Daily:
In your recent series on suicide you have made human tragedy
a simple routine that can be patched up by the words of a few well
intentioned counselors. In our modern culture it seems that we must
sacrifice a quota of fellow human beings on the cross of morality.
The problem is much greater than any single adviser is able to
penetrate. The anxieties formed by our ambivalent attitudes toward
sex and morals ereale a pit for most conscientious, oversensitive
individuals to fall into.
We must reorganize our personal views and attitudes toward the
actions of others and understand their motivations. A few strategi
cally-placed synthetic sympathizers are not enough. Stanford's Fun
damental Standard epitomizes the blind inconsistency of the moral
spokesmen of our society.

A Giant Stej> Toward Agreement
Editor, The Daily:
As American citizens we question the advisability of the continued
testing of nuclear weapons, because we believe that such testing in
creases the likelihood of war and exposes the people of the world to
the genetic and somatic hazards of radioactive fallout.
We are convinced that the dangers of continued testing far out
weigh any of its possible advantages. We believe that an agreement
to cease testing will be a giant step forward toward disarmament
and international agreement.
We, therefore, urge that the United States, Great Britain, and tlie
Soviet Union abandon the testing of nuclear weapons and institute
effective control procedures under the supervision of the United Na
tions.
We are pleased to support the Stanford students who are protest
ing the continuance of testing. We are also pleased to learn that many
students are giving serious consideration to this crucial issue. We feel
that by so doing they are discharging their responsibility as students
and citizens to keep themselves informed, to disseminate information,
and to participate actively in the decision-making process of a demo
cratic society.
