# Happy Hour Held At Ramor Oaks
## 
### 
Graduates from different de
partments met during autumn
quarter at a local restaurant and
found the exchange of ideas
among themselves valuable and
enjoyable. Thus began the suc
cessful Graduate Happy Hour,
held every Friday afternoon from
4 to 6 at Ramor Oaks.
This group wanted to expand
their early idea and have invited
all graduate students to attend.
With the closing of Rudy's, the
group has migrated to Ramor
paks, where they continue this
quarter.
