Track Thrills, !sul Field Crueials
Sntimi; y' Stanford-Oxy dual meet is going to be awfully unusual
in one re •ci p;>i licularly- the best events from a mark standpoint
will be i i:ip track, but the field events will be the ones to decide
the inert.
'! ■ r the way it shapes up after a look at the entry lists and best
marl - i i;■<•> entrants, and that's also what Indian coach Payton
Jopdan thinks will be ihe case at Patterson Field.
S anf.. '! tool; it on ihe chin against USC in the field two weeks
ago, bu that doesn't figure to be the case again. On the other hand,
the Tigers figure to offer more track opposition than did the Trojans,
who v. e really hurting in a few events.
Three of the field events in particular, Ihe broad jump, discus
and shot-put, are complete toss-ups. In the jump, Oxy has Rick
Schmidt at 24-3',:;, but the Indians have Kent Hansen at 24-1 and
John Kelly at 24 feet even. And broad jumpers aren't the most con
sistent of all performers—any of the three may vary up to a foot
from his average mark.
Hansen and Kelly, at least, won't have to face the disadvantage
of jumping in a strange pit. With baseball at the Coliseum, peculiar
management at East LAJC Stadium, and no stands at Eovard Field,
Ihe Stanford-USC meet was held at Oxy's Patterson oval. Kelly
leaped his 24 feet there, and both Stanford men say they like the pit.
Goodness only knows what Stanford shot-putters will do from one
meet to the next, but if they're finally on the improvement road, they
might ace out Glen Johnson in the weight event.
Johnson has his 58-8%, but his normal range is a bit short of that.
Chris Plain and Jerry Winters are beginning to hover around the
52-foot mark at least they were there against Fresno State.
Winters, however, seems to be definitely on the trail to longer
distances. lie didn't do any putting last year. This season, he has
steadily moved through the upper forties, past 50 feet, and is stilll
progressing. Plain, from past history, is in a different situation. He
has been plagued by all sorts of injuries which have impeded prog
ress during his shot-put career.
Last year in workouts, he was out past 53 feet, then got hurt, and
never came back. At various times he's also had fouling trouble,
with his best efforts nullified. It may be that he's moving up for
good this time he's looking better in workouts than at any previous
time.
The Past Can't Score Points
Regardless of the past, it's performances Saturday that will count
for the points. And Stanford will need some of these points in the
shot if it is to have much of a chance against the deeper Tiger team.
The most wide-open events in any meet are often those where
there aren't any outstanding performers—and that's certainly the
situation in the discus.
Jon Vise! is the best Oxy can offer, and he's done only 154-1
Behind him are Ken Shannon at 115-8 and Bob Lord at 144-1 Vs. Stan
ford offers almost the same balance: Armand DeWeese, 156-1%;
Harlan Limmer, 149-V>; Tom Lagerquist, 143-11.
DeWeese might have the best mark, but he's also got the best
record for fouling. Against Fresno State, he fell out of the ring four
times and didn't qualify for the finals. And he's fouled in other
meets, also.
One point, and it's an important one, can be made concerning De-
Weese's fouling Saturday: he was fairly sick and a resulting dizzi
ness hurt his balance in the ring. Also, it can be noted that he's in
his first year of throwing for the Stanford varsity and hasn't had
much competitive experience.
The javelin looks like the only field event Oxy can figure on win
ning easily, since it has Jon Jamison, a 231-footer. Steve Coughlin
should lake Hie high jump for Stanford—if he doesn't have another
of those unexplainable days like he had Saturday against Fresno.
And finally, there's the pole vault. Ed Crouch at 14-4 M.' looks good
for five Oxy points, but don't count out Mike Franchetti, Stanford's
newest 14-foot vault er.
