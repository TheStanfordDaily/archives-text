# Know Your Indians
## 
### 
Robinson (6-5, 215-pound jun
ior from Madera) has been the
big power factor in Ibis year's
Stanford attack. Robinson did
n't see much varsity action last
year. arid hit only .130. But he
moved into Ihe starting center
field slot this year, vaulted
from sixth to third in the bat
ling order, and has homered
out of the Sunken Diamond
twice. Major: Economics.

Winter (6-0, 175-pound sopho
more from San Gabriel) is do
ing most of his catching for the
Braves, since he is behind
Ralph Holding and Art von
Wronski. Hit .294 for the frosh,
and is good defensively. Can
also play first base or outfield,
and has a top-notch throwing
arm. In high school, he caught
Mike McCormick, now with the
S.F. Giants. Major: Biology.
