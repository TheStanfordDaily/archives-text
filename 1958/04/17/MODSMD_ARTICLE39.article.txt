# It'd Be Hot 2-Mile Relay
## 
### 
If Occidental and Stanford cooked up a two-mile relay for their
dual meet Saturday at Patterson Field, the winner might wind up
with a mark awfully close to the world record of 7:22.7.
Oxy set that mark last year with a team of Larry Wray, Dave Resi
bord, Ty Hadley and Tod White. All of this quartet except Wray are

back for another go this year.
Put one of the 410 men- Pat Lo
gan or John Zel/rnan -on the
team, and the Eagle Rock school
should come close 1o the mark.
Stanford didn't have any near
record two-mile team last year,
hut that's because three of the
four men on wh.at would probably
be the Stanford team didn't run
varsity in '57.
The strongest members of the
Indian quartet would be Norm
Lloyd and Ernie Cunliffe. Lloyd,
of course, broke the Stanford
school 880 record with a 1:50.5
effort last Saturday, and Cunliffe
has run 1:51 and 1:51.3 in his past
two races.
Give these two a hit of an ad
vantage which they would gei on
a running versus a standing start,
and each should be under 1:50.
Dick Lassen would undoubtedly
be a third member of the com
bine. He ran successive 880's of
1:53.2 and 1:54.8 nearly three
weeks ago at the Texas Relays.
With good weather now in its
second week, Lassen and the rest
of the club have had far more
opportunity for training than

they had leading up to the Texas
event.
Lassen's sharp 49.1 against
Fresno State Saturday indicated
he's about ready for a strong half
mile effort. If the relay were to
be run this week end he would
likely be close to 1:52.
Don Chesarek would be the
fourth and possibly most unpre
dictable member of the team. He
hasn't run very many 880'*, pre
ferring to stick to the quarter.
Off his excellent 440 clockings,
there seems no reason why he
couldn't run a speedy half —in
fact, it could be his best event if
he concentrated on it. He looks
capable of 1:52, but could range
up to 1:56 or 1:57.
Hadley is the best of the Oxy
crew he's been as low as 1:48.9.
White and Reisbord would figure
to be in the 1:50-1:51 range, but
whichever quarter-miler the Ben
gals decided to use would still be
a questionable factor.
Of course, the fact remains that
the two clubs won't run any two
mile relays this week end. But all
the runners will tangle with each
other somewhere in the 440, 880
and or mile—and all three should
be great races.
So far as the relay is concerned,
track fans will have to wait until
such meets as the Coliseum Re
lays. West Coast Relays and Cali
fornia Relays to get a look at
these two excellent quartets in
action.
But, then, maybe it's better that
way. Just think how much better
the times should be a month from
now.

mile effort. If the relay were to
be run this week end he would
likely be close to 1:52.
Don Chesarek would be the
fourth and possibly most unpre
dictable member of the team. He
hasn't run very many 880'*, pre
ferring to stick to the quarter.
Off his excellent 440 clockings,
there seems no reason why he
couldn't run a speedy half —in
fact, it could be his best event if
he concentrated on it. He looks
capable of 1:52, but could range
up to 1:56 or 1:57.
Hadley is the best of the Oxy
crew he's been as low as 1:48.9.
White and Reisbord would figure
to be in the 1:50-1:51 range, but
whichever quarter-miler the Ben
gals decided to use would still be
a questionable factor.
Of course, the fact remains that
the two clubs won't run any two
mile relays this week end. But all
the runners will tangle with each
other somewhere in the 440, 880
and or mile—and all three should
be great races.
So far as the relay is concerned,
track fans will have to wait until
such meets as the Coliseum Re
lays. West Coast Relays and Cali
fornia Relays to get a look at
these two excellent quartets in
action.
But, then, maybe it's better that
way. Just think how much better
the times should be a month from
now.
If Occidental and Stanford cooked up a two-mile relay for their
dual meet Saturday at Patterson Field, the winner might wind up
with a mark awfully close to the world record of 7:22.7.
Oxy set that mark last year with a team of Larry Wray, Dave Resi
bord, Ty Hadley and Tod White. All of this quartet except Wray are

back for another go this year.
Put one of the 410 men- Pat Lo
gan or John Zel/rnan -on the
team, and the Eagle Rock school
should come close 1o the mark.
Stanford didn't have any near
record two-mile team last year,
hut that's because three of the
four men on wh.at would probably
be the Stanford team didn't run
varsity in '57.
The strongest members of the
Indian quartet would be Norm
Lloyd and Ernie Cunliffe. Lloyd,
of course, broke the Stanford
school 880 record with a 1:50.5
effort last Saturday, and Cunliffe
has run 1:51 and 1:51.3 in his past
two races.
Give these two a hit of an ad
vantage which they would gei on
a running versus a standing start,
and each should be under 1:50.
Dick Lassen would undoubtedly
be a third member of the com
bine. He ran successive 880's of
1:53.2 and 1:54.8 nearly three
weeks ago at the Texas Relays.
With good weather now in its
second week, Lassen and the rest
of the club have had far more
opportunity for training than

they had leading up to the Texas
event.
Lassen's sharp 49.1 against
Fresno State Saturday indicated
he's about ready for a strong half
mile effort. If the relay were to
be run this week end he would
likely be close to 1:52.
