# CRISIS
## Pres. Coty Seeks New Premier 
### 
PARIS (/P) — President Rene
Coty began last night a search
for some sort of parliamentary
coalition to govern France, amid
gloomy predictions of a long-term
cabinet crisis.
With Premier Felix Gaillard's
five-month-old cabinet routed by
the combined attack of conserva
tives and Communists on a wave
of anti-American sentiment, the
president's search for a National
Assembly majority promised to
be an anguished one.
Important and even painful
consequences of this new crisis
lay ahead for France, and most
political observers seemed pessi
mistic.
If the next government, when it
finally is formed, is more to the
right than the lastj—which seems
likely—a hardening of French
policy toward North Africa may
well lead to increased French-
American strain.
This was the fifth time that a
French government had been
thrown out on a North African
issue. This time Gaillard had
backed a U.S.-British good offices
solution to achieve better rela
tions with Tunisia. He fell last
night on a 321-253 vote, after five
months and 10 days in office.
French foreign policy probably
will continue along lines already
laid down. France will be at a
summit conference, if one is con
vened and if there is any govern
ment at all at the time.
