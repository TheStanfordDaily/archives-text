A student protest against conti
held today in front of the Library
Representatives of the group oJ
planned the demonstration emph;
"dignified, in keeping with the Ur

nued nuclear bomb testing will be
from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
i more than 50 students which has
asized that the program would be
liversity's atmosphere."
There will be no speeches. The
protesters will talk with students,

three-page presentation of the is
sues, a political statement and a
"fact • quotation" sheet of state
ments fi'om scientific and politi
cal figures.
There will be a station, includ
ing a Congressional Directory, for
writing letters to congressmen
and the President.
A spokesman for the group,
which has been gathering infor
mation "both for and against nu
clear tests" for more than a
month, outlined the protest's pur
pose:
Discussions
"To stimulate individual think
ing on the issues involved . . . we
hope that discussion in living
groups and in classes will arise
as a result of the demonstration."
Another demonstrator told The
Daily that since the United States
is about to begin a test series in
the Pacific, and since Secretary of
State Dulles has stated that "U.S.
policy [with regard to nuclear
bomb tests] is under review," this
is therefore the "optimum time"
for students to fulfill "their his
toric role" and be a "vital influ
encing force" upon public policy
regarding nuclear tests.
Pros and Cons
As part of its attempt to edu
cate the campus regarding the
pros and cons of testing, the
group has reserved a shelf in the
Humanities room of the Library
with information on "both sides"
of the question.
Next Tuesday evening the lIR
will hold a panel discussion on
the topic "Should Nuclear Tests
Be Abolished?" in the Crothers
Memorial basement lounge at 7:30
p.m.
Dr. David Regnery will lecture
for his general biology course on
the specific subject of gene mu
tation next Wednesday in Memo
rial Auditorium at 11 a.m.
The demonstrators emphasized
that "the movement at Stanford
is entirely a student one and has
no connections with outside agen
cies or organizations." The dem
onstrators have raised their own
funds through voluntary contri
butions.
