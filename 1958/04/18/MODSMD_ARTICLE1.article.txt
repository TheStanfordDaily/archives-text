# Card Spikers To Meet Oxy Down South
## 
### Dick Barnes, Spoils Editor 
Lloyd vs. White; Cunliffe vs. Hadley; two of the nation's finest
mile relay teams vying: these will be a few of the lures when Stan
lord meets Occidental on the Tiger track tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Each school will present more than its share of the fastest runners
in the country in a meet that will in all probability go down to the

relay. But while the running
events figure to be the best of the
meet, the field battles are the
more unpredictable and should
swing the meet one way or the
other.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to meet his old
school on its own grounds for the
first time since he came north.
Last year at Stanford, in his first
battle with his ex-boys, the Tigers
came out with a 72-59 victory.
Targets of Oxy
Norman Lloyd and Ernie Cun
liffe are the two Indians whom
the Bengals hope most to beat, or
at least reduce to a point of mini
mum effectiveness. The meet's
first race, the mile, may give a
good indication of just how well
Chuck Coker's pack can pull off
this strategy.
Lloyd figures to win the mile,
although Tod White is good
enough to give him a run for his
money. White's principal object,
besides going for the victory, of
course .will be to force Lloyd to
run so fast that he will be unable
to come back with a strong half
mile. To do this, White will have
to force Stanford's double-record
breaker to hit 4:06 or better—and
it's not too likely White can do
this.
Hadley to Wait
Coker plans to save his best
distance man, Ty Hadley, for the
880 only. Hadley isn't as far
along in conditioning as Ernie
Cunliffe, Stanford's 1:51.0 ace,
and so he'll have his hands full.
Hadley, however, has run as fast
as 1:48.9 during his collegiate ca
reer, and he'll try to reduce Cun
liffe's relay potential.
Rapidly-improving San Jose State is expected to give Dutch Fnhr
ing's Stanford nine a rough test in a home-and-home series today
and tomorrow.
The Indians will go down to Spartanland today for a 3 p.m. game.
The clubs will return to the Sunken Diamond tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

for their final meeting of the sea
son.
Stanford needs one victory in
the two games to capture the
three-game series with San Jose.
The Cards whipped the Spartans
8-2 in the second game of the year
—their first against collegiate op
position.
Leopold to Start
Bob Leopold will be on the hill
in today's game, hoping to
bounce back from the shelling he
took from USC in the first game
of last Saturday's double-header.
In that lilt, Leopold suffered
one of his worst days in two
years as the Trojans raked him
for 10 runs and 12 hits in eight
innings.
Leopold, however, seems to
hold a bit more of a mastery over
Ihe Spartans. In the clubs' pre
vious meeting, he went the first
six innings and yielded neither a
run nor a hit, while striking out
eight of the 20 batters he faced.
Avery and/or Williams
In the Saturday game, Fehring
plans to use George Avery or
Dick Williams, or perhaps both
men. Williams saw three innings
of action against San Jose, giving
up a pair of runs on two hits. His
chief trouble in that game was
wildness, as bases on balls cost
him both runs.
Avery will be facing the Spar
tans for the first time this sea
son.
Fehring plans to use the same
line-up he employed against Sac
ramento State when the Indians
beat Ihem 10-3 here Tuesday, ex
cept that Ben Robinson and Rich
DeFabio may switch places de
pending on who pitches for San
Jose.
For a Righty
If a right-hander goes, the In
dians will have Jim Burk at 3b,
Joel Newkirk lb, DeFabio rf,
Ralph Holding c, A 1 Shaw 2b,
Robinson If, Bob Dwight ss, Har
ry Rodda cf and the pitcher. If
a left-hander throws, Robinson
will hit third and DeFabio sixth.
Medical reports now make it
apparent that Rodda will be see
ing lots of action for at least two
more weeks. The word on regu
lar left-fielder Parker Olsen is
that he won't be back for at
least that long.
Olsen sprained an ankle badly
against USC in the second game
Saturday, was on crutches the
early part of the week and has
now had his foot placed in a cast.
The principal question mark
about Rodda is his hitting.
Against the Sacs in his first start,
he beat out a bunt in four official
trips, and also drew a free pass.
There is no concern at all about
Rodda's defensive skill. He is one

of Stanford's H*»st fly-chasers,
and so was moved to center field
while Robinson shifted to left.
Rodda also gives the club consid
erably more speed on the bases
if he gets on.

Stanford will have double pow
er in the race if Lloyd isn't too
tired from the mile. Oxy's Dave
Reisbord is also a possible point
maker if he, too, isn't pooped
from the four-lapper.
If the meet does hinge on the
relay, one of the year's great
races should occur. Stanford ran
3:11.4 against Fresno last week,
and the Indians weren't pressed
too closely.
Better Combine
The Tigers ran 3:13.0 in a spe
cial meet Saturday, and they
weren't even running their four
best men. This weekend's com
bine for them figures to be Reis
bord, Hadley, John Zet/.man and
Ed Tunney. Stanford will go with
its regular quartet of Dick Las
sen, Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don Che
sarek.
Zetzman and Chesarek, the
best quarter-milers of this relay
group, will have at each other in
the 440. Lassen and Pat Logan of
the Tigers will fight it out for
third, with Lassen having a
chance to get second. Dennis
Bambauer, another of Oxy's
strong quarter- mile crew, has
been bothered with muscle troub
le all season and won't run.
The Tigers' surest track victo
ries should be the sprints, where
Rudy Alston, 9.6 and 21.1, is the
class of the field. Stanford's
Chuck Cobb should negate these
victories with a pair of firsts in
the hurdles.
In the two-mile, Maury Graves,
the country's second-best runner

this year, looks to be a substan
tial favorite over Hal Ilarkness
and John Kerr.
Three of the field events —
broad jump, shot-put and discus —
are toss-ups for first places, and
the other three—pole vault, high
jump and javelin—are question
able in other spots.
Kent Hansen, Rick Schmidt of
Oxy and John Kelly are all within
four inches of each other in the
broad jump, but could finish in
any order. Glen Johnson of Ihe
Tigers, Chris Plain and Jerry
Winters are almost as close in
the shot.
John Visel and Armand Pe-
Weese figure to be close in the
discus, hut the Tigers' John Jami
son has an edge in the javelin,
the other weight event.
Stanford's Steve Coughlin, de
spile his 5-8 performance against
USC, should win the high jump
against mediocre opposition. In
the pole vault, it's 14-footer Mike
Franchetti of Stanford against
Oxy s Ed Crouch, who's done 14-
4\'z.

mile relay teams vying: these will be a few of the lures when Stan
lord meets Occidental on the Tiger track tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Each school will present more than its share of the fastest runners
in the country in a meet that will in all probability go down to the

relay. But while the running
events figure to be the best of the
meet, the field battles are the
more unpredictable and should
swing the meet one way or the
other.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to meet his old
school on its own grounds for the
first time since he came north.
Last year at Stanford, in his first
battle with his ex-boys, the Tigers
came out with a 72-59 victory.
Targets of Oxy
Norman Lloyd and Ernie Cun
liffe are the two Indians whom
the Bengals hope most to beat, or
at least reduce to a point of mini
mum effectiveness. The meet's
first race, the mile, may give a
good indication of just how well
Chuck Coker's pack can pull off
this strategy.
Lloyd figures to win the mile,
although Tod White is good
enough to give him a run for his
money. White's principal object,
besides going for the victory, of
course .will be to force Lloyd to
run so fast that he will be unable
to come back with a strong half
mile. To do this, White will have
to force Stanford's double-record
breaker to hit 4:06 or better—and
it's not too likely White can do
this.
Hadley to Wait
Coker plans to save his best
distance man, Ty Hadley, for the
880 only. Hadley isn't as far
along in conditioning as Ernie
Cunliffe, Stanford's 1:51.0 ace,
and so he'll have his hands full.
Hadley, however, has run as fast
as 1:48.9 during his collegiate ca
reer, and he'll try to reduce Cun
liffe's relay potential.
Rapidly-improving San Jose State is expected to give Dutch Fnhr
ing's Stanford nine a rough test in a home-and-home series today
and tomorrow.
The Indians will go down to Spartanland today for a 3 p.m. game.
The clubs will return to the Sunken Diamond tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

for their final meeting of the sea
son.
Stanford needs one victory in
the two games to capture the
three-game series with San Jose.
The Cards whipped the Spartans
8-2 in the second game of the year
—their first against collegiate op
position.
Leopold to Start
Bob Leopold will be on the hill
in today's game, hoping to
bounce back from the shelling he
took from USC in the first game
of last Saturday's double-header.
In that lilt, Leopold suffered
one of his worst days in two
years as the Trojans raked him
for 10 runs and 12 hits in eight
innings.
Leopold, however, seems to
hold a bit more of a mastery over
Ihe Spartans. In the clubs' pre
vious meeting, he went the first
six innings and yielded neither a
run nor a hit, while striking out
eight of the 20 batters he faced.
Avery and/or Williams
In the Saturday game, Fehring
plans to use George Avery or
Dick Williams, or perhaps both
men. Williams saw three innings
of action against San Jose, giving
up a pair of runs on two hits. His
chief trouble in that game was
wildness, as bases on balls cost
him both runs.
Avery will be facing the Spar
tans for the first time this sea
son.
Fehring plans to use the same
line-up he employed against Sac
ramento State when the Indians
beat Ihem 10-3 here Tuesday, ex
cept that Ben Robinson and Rich
DeFabio may switch places de
pending on who pitches for San
Jose.
For a Righty
If a right-hander goes, the In
dians will have Jim Burk at 3b,
Joel Newkirk lb, DeFabio rf,
Ralph Holding c, A 1 Shaw 2b,
Robinson If, Bob Dwight ss, Har
ry Rodda cf and the pitcher. If
a left-hander throws, Robinson
will hit third and DeFabio sixth.
Medical reports now make it
apparent that Rodda will be see
ing lots of action for at least two
more weeks. The word on regu
lar left-fielder Parker Olsen is
that he won't be back for at
least that long.
Olsen sprained an ankle badly
against USC in the second game
Saturday, was on crutches the
early part of the week and has
now had his foot placed in a cast.
The principal question mark
about Rodda is his hitting.
Against the Sacs in his first start,
he beat out a bunt in four official
trips, and also drew a free pass.
There is no concern at all about
Rodda's defensive skill. He is one

of Stanford's H*»st fly-chasers,
and so was moved to center field
while Robinson shifted to left.
Rodda also gives the club consid
erably more speed on the bases
if he gets on.

Stanford will have double pow
er in the race if Lloyd isn't too
tired from the mile. Oxy's Dave
Reisbord is also a possible point
maker if he, too, isn't pooped
from the four-lapper.
If the meet does hinge on the
relay, one of the year's great
races should occur. Stanford ran
3:11.4 against Fresno last week,
and the Indians weren't pressed
too closely.
Better Combine
The Tigers ran 3:13.0 in a spe
cial meet Saturday, and they
weren't even running their four
best men. This weekend's com
bine for them figures to be Reis
bord, Hadley, John Zet/.man and
Ed Tunney. Stanford will go with
its regular quartet of Dick Las
sen, Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don Che
sarek.
Zetzman and Chesarek, the
best quarter-milers of this relay
group, will have at each other in
the 440. Lassen and Pat Logan of
the Tigers will fight it out for
third, with Lassen having a
chance to get second. Dennis
Bambauer, another of Oxy's
strong quarter- mile crew, has
been bothered with muscle troub
le all season and won't run.
The Tigers' surest track victo
ries should be the sprints, where
Rudy Alston, 9.6 and 21.1, is the
class of the field. Stanford's
Chuck Cobb should negate these
victories with a pair of firsts in
the hurdles.
In the two-mile, Maury Graves,
the country's second-best runner

this year, looks to be a substan
tial favorite over Hal Ilarkness
and John Kerr.
Three of the field events —
broad jump, shot-put and discus —
are toss-ups for first places, and
the other three—pole vault, high
jump and javelin—are question
able in other spots.
Kent Hansen, Rick Schmidt of
Oxy and John Kelly are all within
four inches of each other in the
broad jump, but could finish in
any order. Glen Johnson of Ihe
Tigers, Chris Plain and Jerry
Winters are almost as close in
the shot.
John Visel and Armand Pe-
Weese figure to be close in the
discus, hut the Tigers' John Jami
son has an edge in the javelin,
the other weight event.
Stanford's Steve Coughlin, de
spile his 5-8 performance against
USC, should win the high jump
against mediocre opposition. In
the pole vault, it's 14-footer Mike
Franchetti of Stanford against
Oxy s Ed Crouch, who's done 14-
4\'z.

lord meets Occidental on the Tiger track tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Each school will present more than its share of the fastest runners
in the country in a meet that will in all probability go down to the

relay. But while the running
events figure to be the best of the
meet, the field battles are the
more unpredictable and should
swing the meet one way or the
other.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to meet his old
school on its own grounds for the
first time since he came north.
Last year at Stanford, in his first
battle with his ex-boys, the Tigers
came out with a 72-59 victory.
Targets of Oxy
Norman Lloyd and Ernie Cun
liffe are the two Indians whom
the Bengals hope most to beat, or
at least reduce to a point of mini
mum effectiveness. The meet's
first race, the mile, may give a
good indication of just how well
Chuck Coker's pack can pull off
this strategy.
Lloyd figures to win the mile,
although Tod White is good
enough to give him a run for his
money. White's principal object,
besides going for the victory, of
course .will be to force Lloyd to
run so fast that he will be unable
to come back with a strong half
mile. To do this, White will have
to force Stanford's double-record
breaker to hit 4:06 or better—and
it's not too likely White can do
this.
Hadley to Wait
Coker plans to save his best
distance man, Ty Hadley, for the
880 only. Hadley isn't as far
along in conditioning as Ernie
Cunliffe, Stanford's 1:51.0 ace,
and so he'll have his hands full.
Hadley, however, has run as fast
as 1:48.9 during his collegiate ca
reer, and he'll try to reduce Cun
liffe's relay potential.
Rapidly-improving San Jose State is expected to give Dutch Fnhr
ing's Stanford nine a rough test in a home-and-home series today
and tomorrow.
The Indians will go down to Spartanland today for a 3 p.m. game.
The clubs will return to the Sunken Diamond tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

for their final meeting of the sea
son.
Stanford needs one victory in
the two games to capture the
three-game series with San Jose.
The Cards whipped the Spartans
8-2 in the second game of the year
—their first against collegiate op
position.
Leopold to Start
Bob Leopold will be on the hill
in today's game, hoping to
bounce back from the shelling he
took from USC in the first game
of last Saturday's double-header.
In that lilt, Leopold suffered
one of his worst days in two
years as the Trojans raked him
for 10 runs and 12 hits in eight
innings.
Leopold, however, seems to
hold a bit more of a mastery over
Ihe Spartans. In the clubs' pre
vious meeting, he went the first
six innings and yielded neither a
run nor a hit, while striking out
eight of the 20 batters he faced.
Avery and/or Williams
In the Saturday game, Fehring
plans to use George Avery or
Dick Williams, or perhaps both
men. Williams saw three innings
of action against San Jose, giving
up a pair of runs on two hits. His
chief trouble in that game was
wildness, as bases on balls cost
him both runs.
Avery will be facing the Spar
tans for the first time this sea
son.
Fehring plans to use the same
line-up he employed against Sac
ramento State when the Indians
beat Ihem 10-3 here Tuesday, ex
cept that Ben Robinson and Rich
DeFabio may switch places de
pending on who pitches for San
Jose.
For a Righty
If a right-hander goes, the In
dians will have Jim Burk at 3b,
Joel Newkirk lb, DeFabio rf,
Ralph Holding c, A 1 Shaw 2b,
Robinson If, Bob Dwight ss, Har
ry Rodda cf and the pitcher. If
a left-hander throws, Robinson
will hit third and DeFabio sixth.
Medical reports now make it
apparent that Rodda will be see
ing lots of action for at least two
more weeks. The word on regu
lar left-fielder Parker Olsen is
that he won't be back for at
least that long.
Olsen sprained an ankle badly
against USC in the second game
Saturday, was on crutches the
early part of the week and has
now had his foot placed in a cast.
The principal question mark
about Rodda is his hitting.
Against the Sacs in his first start,
he beat out a bunt in four official
trips, and also drew a free pass.
There is no concern at all about
Rodda's defensive skill. He is one

of Stanford's H*»st fly-chasers,
and so was moved to center field
while Robinson shifted to left.
Rodda also gives the club consid
erably more speed on the bases
if he gets on.

Stanford will have double pow
er in the race if Lloyd isn't too
tired from the mile. Oxy's Dave
Reisbord is also a possible point
maker if he, too, isn't pooped
from the four-lapper.
If the meet does hinge on the
relay, one of the year's great
races should occur. Stanford ran
3:11.4 against Fresno last week,
and the Indians weren't pressed
too closely.
Better Combine
The Tigers ran 3:13.0 in a spe
cial meet Saturday, and they
weren't even running their four
best men. This weekend's com
bine for them figures to be Reis
bord, Hadley, John Zet/.man and
Ed Tunney. Stanford will go with
its regular quartet of Dick Las
sen, Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don Che
sarek.
Zetzman and Chesarek, the
best quarter-milers of this relay
group, will have at each other in
the 440. Lassen and Pat Logan of
the Tigers will fight it out for
third, with Lassen having a
chance to get second. Dennis
Bambauer, another of Oxy's
strong quarter- mile crew, has
been bothered with muscle troub
le all season and won't run.
The Tigers' surest track victo
ries should be the sprints, where
Rudy Alston, 9.6 and 21.1, is the
class of the field. Stanford's
Chuck Cobb should negate these
victories with a pair of firsts in
the hurdles.
In the two-mile, Maury Graves,
the country's second-best runner

this year, looks to be a substan
tial favorite over Hal Ilarkness
and John Kerr.
Three of the field events —
broad jump, shot-put and discus —
are toss-ups for first places, and
the other three—pole vault, high
jump and javelin—are question
able in other spots.
Kent Hansen, Rick Schmidt of
Oxy and John Kelly are all within
four inches of each other in the
broad jump, but could finish in
any order. Glen Johnson of Ihe
Tigers, Chris Plain and Jerry
Winters are almost as close in
the shot.
John Visel and Armand Pe-
Weese figure to be close in the
discus, hut the Tigers' John Jami
son has an edge in the javelin,
the other weight event.
Stanford's Steve Coughlin, de
spile his 5-8 performance against
USC, should win the high jump
against mediocre opposition. In
the pole vault, it's 14-footer Mike
Franchetti of Stanford against
Oxy s Ed Crouch, who's done 14-
4\'z.

lord meets Occidental on the Tiger track tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Each school will present more than its share of the fastest runners
in the country in a meet that will in all probability go down to the

relay. But while the running
events figure to be the best of the
meet, the field battles are the
more unpredictable and should
swing the meet one way or the
other.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to meet his old
school on its own grounds for the
first time since he came north.
Last year at Stanford, in his first
battle with his ex-boys, the Tigers
came out with a 72-59 victory.
Targets of Oxy
Norman Lloyd and Ernie Cun
liffe are the two Indians whom
the Bengals hope most to beat, or
at least reduce to a point of mini
mum effectiveness. The meet's
first race, the mile, may give a
good indication of just how well
Chuck Coker's pack can pull off
this strategy.
Lloyd figures to win the mile,
although Tod White is good
enough to give him a run for his
money. White's principal object,
besides going for the victory, of
course .will be to force Lloyd to
run so fast that he will be unable
to come back with a strong half
mile. To do this, White will have
to force Stanford's double-record
breaker to hit 4:06 or better—and
it's not too likely White can do
this.
Hadley to Wait
Coker plans to save his best
distance man, Ty Hadley, for the
880 only. Hadley isn't as far
along in conditioning as Ernie
Cunliffe, Stanford's 1:51.0 ace,
and so he'll have his hands full.
Hadley, however, has run as fast
as 1:48.9 during his collegiate ca
reer, and he'll try to reduce Cun
liffe's relay potential.
Rapidly-improving San Jose State is expected to give Dutch Fnhr
ing's Stanford nine a rough test in a home-and-home series today
and tomorrow.
The Indians will go down to Spartanland today for a 3 p.m. game.
The clubs will return to the Sunken Diamond tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

for their final meeting of the sea
son.
Stanford needs one victory in
the two games to capture the
three-game series with San Jose.
The Cards whipped the Spartans
8-2 in the second game of the year
—their first against collegiate op
position.
Leopold to Start
Bob Leopold will be on the hill
in today's game, hoping to
bounce back from the shelling he
took from USC in the first game
of last Saturday's double-header.
In that lilt, Leopold suffered
one of his worst days in two
years as the Trojans raked him
for 10 runs and 12 hits in eight
innings.
Leopold, however, seems to
hold a bit more of a mastery over
Ihe Spartans. In the clubs' pre
vious meeting, he went the first
six innings and yielded neither a
run nor a hit, while striking out
eight of the 20 batters he faced.
Avery and/or Williams
In the Saturday game, Fehring
plans to use George Avery or
Dick Williams, or perhaps both
men. Williams saw three innings
of action against San Jose, giving
up a pair of runs on two hits. His
chief trouble in that game was
wildness, as bases on balls cost
him both runs.
Avery will be facing the Spar
tans for the first time this sea
son.
Fehring plans to use the same
line-up he employed against Sac
ramento State when the Indians
beat Ihem 10-3 here Tuesday, ex
cept that Ben Robinson and Rich
DeFabio may switch places de
pending on who pitches for San
Jose.
For a Righty
If a right-hander goes, the In
dians will have Jim Burk at 3b,
Joel Newkirk lb, DeFabio rf,
Ralph Holding c, A 1 Shaw 2b,
Robinson If, Bob Dwight ss, Har
ry Rodda cf and the pitcher. If
a left-hander throws, Robinson
will hit third and DeFabio sixth.
Medical reports now make it
apparent that Rodda will be see
ing lots of action for at least two
more weeks. The word on regu
lar left-fielder Parker Olsen is
that he won't be back for at
least that long.
Olsen sprained an ankle badly
against USC in the second game
Saturday, was on crutches the
early part of the week and has
now had his foot placed in a cast.
The principal question mark
about Rodda is his hitting.
Against the Sacs in his first start,
he beat out a bunt in four official
trips, and also drew a free pass.
There is no concern at all about
Rodda's defensive skill. He is one

of Stanford's H*»st fly-chasers,
and so was moved to center field
while Robinson shifted to left.
Rodda also gives the club consid
erably more speed on the bases
if he gets on.

Stanford will have double pow
er in the race if Lloyd isn't too
tired from the mile. Oxy's Dave
Reisbord is also a possible point
maker if he, too, isn't pooped
from the four-lapper.
If the meet does hinge on the
relay, one of the year's great
races should occur. Stanford ran
3:11.4 against Fresno last week,
and the Indians weren't pressed
too closely.
Better Combine
The Tigers ran 3:13.0 in a spe
cial meet Saturday, and they
weren't even running their four
best men. This weekend's com
bine for them figures to be Reis
bord, Hadley, John Zet/.man and
Ed Tunney. Stanford will go with
its regular quartet of Dick Las
sen, Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don Che
sarek.
Zetzman and Chesarek, the
best quarter-milers of this relay
group, will have at each other in
the 440. Lassen and Pat Logan of
the Tigers will fight it out for
third, with Lassen having a
chance to get second. Dennis
Bambauer, another of Oxy's
strong quarter- mile crew, has
been bothered with muscle troub
le all season and won't run.
The Tigers' surest track victo
ries should be the sprints, where
Rudy Alston, 9.6 and 21.1, is the
class of the field. Stanford's
Chuck Cobb should negate these
victories with a pair of firsts in
the hurdles.
In the two-mile, Maury Graves,
the country's second-best runner

this year, looks to be a substan
tial favorite over Hal Ilarkness
and John Kerr.
Three of the field events —
broad jump, shot-put and discus —
are toss-ups for first places, and
the other three—pole vault, high
jump and javelin—are question
able in other spots.
Kent Hansen, Rick Schmidt of
Oxy and John Kelly are all within
four inches of each other in the
broad jump, but could finish in
any order. Glen Johnson of Ihe
Tigers, Chris Plain and Jerry
Winters are almost as close in
the shot.
John Visel and Armand Pe-
Weese figure to be close in the
discus, hut the Tigers' John Jami
son has an edge in the javelin,
the other weight event.
Stanford's Steve Coughlin, de
spile his 5-8 performance against
USC, should win the high jump
against mediocre opposition. In
the pole vault, it's 14-footer Mike
Franchetti of Stanford against
Oxy s Ed Crouch, who's done 14-
4\'z.

lord meets Occidental on the Tiger track tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Each school will present more than its share of the fastest runners
in the country in a meet that will in all probability go down to the

relay. But while the running
events figure to be the best of the
meet, the field battles are the
more unpredictable and should
swing the meet one way or the
other.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to meet his old
school on its own grounds for the
first time since he came north.
Last year at Stanford, in his first
battle with his ex-boys, the Tigers
came out with a 72-59 victory.
Targets of Oxy
Norman Lloyd and Ernie Cun
liffe are the two Indians whom
the Bengals hope most to beat, or
at least reduce to a point of mini
mum effectiveness. The meet's
first race, the mile, may give a
good indication of just how well
Chuck Coker's pack can pull off
this strategy.
Lloyd figures to win the mile,
although Tod White is good
enough to give him a run for his
money. White's principal object,
besides going for the victory, of
course .will be to force Lloyd to
run so fast that he will be unable
to come back with a strong half
mile. To do this, White will have
to force Stanford's double-record
breaker to hit 4:06 or better—and
it's not too likely White can do
this.
Hadley to Wait
Coker plans to save his best
distance man, Ty Hadley, for the
880 only. Hadley isn't as far
along in conditioning as Ernie
Cunliffe, Stanford's 1:51.0 ace,
and so he'll have his hands full.
Hadley, however, has run as fast
as 1:48.9 during his collegiate ca
reer, and he'll try to reduce Cun
liffe's relay potential.
Rapidly-improving San Jose State is expected to give Dutch Fnhr
ing's Stanford nine a rough test in a home-and-home series today
and tomorrow.
The Indians will go down to Spartanland today for a 3 p.m. game.
The clubs will return to the Sunken Diamond tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

for their final meeting of the sea
son.
Stanford needs one victory in
the two games to capture the
three-game series with San Jose.
The Cards whipped the Spartans
8-2 in the second game of the year
—their first against collegiate op
position.
Leopold to Start
Bob Leopold will be on the hill
in today's game, hoping to
bounce back from the shelling he
took from USC in the first game
of last Saturday's double-header.
In that lilt, Leopold suffered
one of his worst days in two
years as the Trojans raked him
for 10 runs and 12 hits in eight
innings.
Leopold, however, seems to
hold a bit more of a mastery over
Ihe Spartans. In the clubs' pre
vious meeting, he went the first
six innings and yielded neither a
run nor a hit, while striking out
eight of the 20 batters he faced.
Avery and/or Williams
In the Saturday game, Fehring
plans to use George Avery or
Dick Williams, or perhaps both
men. Williams saw three innings
of action against San Jose, giving
up a pair of runs on two hits. His
chief trouble in that game was
wildness, as bases on balls cost
him both runs.
Avery will be facing the Spar
tans for the first time this sea
son.
Fehring plans to use the same
line-up he employed against Sac
ramento State when the Indians
beat Ihem 10-3 here Tuesday, ex
cept that Ben Robinson and Rich
DeFabio may switch places de
pending on who pitches for San
Jose.
For a Righty
If a right-hander goes, the In
dians will have Jim Burk at 3b,
Joel Newkirk lb, DeFabio rf,
Ralph Holding c, A 1 Shaw 2b,
Robinson If, Bob Dwight ss, Har
ry Rodda cf and the pitcher. If
a left-hander throws, Robinson
will hit third and DeFabio sixth.
Medical reports now make it
apparent that Rodda will be see
ing lots of action for at least two
more weeks. The word on regu
lar left-fielder Parker Olsen is
that he won't be back for at
least that long.
Olsen sprained an ankle badly
against USC in the second game
Saturday, was on crutches the
early part of the week and has
now had his foot placed in a cast.
The principal question mark
about Rodda is his hitting.
Against the Sacs in his first start,
he beat out a bunt in four official
trips, and also drew a free pass.
There is no concern at all about
Rodda's defensive skill. He is one

of Stanford's H*»st fly-chasers,
and so was moved to center field
while Robinson shifted to left.
Rodda also gives the club consid
erably more speed on the bases
if he gets on.

Stanford will have double pow
er in the race if Lloyd isn't too
tired from the mile. Oxy's Dave
Reisbord is also a possible point
maker if he, too, isn't pooped
from the four-lapper.
If the meet does hinge on the
relay, one of the year's great
races should occur. Stanford ran
3:11.4 against Fresno last week,
and the Indians weren't pressed
too closely.
Better Combine
The Tigers ran 3:13.0 in a spe
cial meet Saturday, and they
weren't even running their four
best men. This weekend's com
bine for them figures to be Reis
bord, Hadley, John Zet/.man and
Ed Tunney. Stanford will go with
its regular quartet of Dick Las
sen, Cunliffe, Lloyd and Don Che
sarek.
Zetzman and Chesarek, the
best quarter-milers of this relay
group, will have at each other in
the 440. Lassen and Pat Logan of
the Tigers will fight it out for
third, with Lassen having a
chance to get second. Dennis
Bambauer, another of Oxy's
strong quarter- mile crew, has
been bothered with muscle troub
le all season and won't run.
The Tigers' surest track victo
ries should be the sprints, where
Rudy Alston, 9.6 and 21.1, is the
class of the field. Stanford's
Chuck Cobb should negate these
victories with a pair of firsts in
the hurdles.
In the two-mile, Maury Graves,
the country's second-best runner

this year, looks to be a substan
tial favorite over Hal Ilarkness
and John Kerr.
Three of the field events —
broad jump, shot-put and discus —
are toss-ups for first places, and
the other three—pole vault, high
jump and javelin—are question
able in other spots.
Kent Hansen, Rick Schmidt of
Oxy and John Kelly are all within
four inches of each other in the
broad jump, but could finish in
any order. Glen Johnson of Ihe
Tigers, Chris Plain and Jerry
Winters are almost as close in
the shot.
John Visel and Armand Pe-
Weese figure to be close in the
discus, hut the Tigers' John Jami
son has an edge in the javelin,
the other weight event.
Stanford's Steve Coughlin, de
spile his 5-8 performance against
USC, should win the high jump
against mediocre opposition. In
the pole vault, it's 14-footer Mike
Franchetti of Stanford against
Oxy s Ed Crouch, who's done 14-
4\'z.
