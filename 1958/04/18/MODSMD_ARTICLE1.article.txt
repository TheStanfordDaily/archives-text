# Card Spikers To Meet Oxy Down South
## 
### Dick Barnes, Spoils Editor 
Lloyd vs. White; Cunliffe vs. Hadley; two of the nation's finest
mile relay teams vying: these will be a few of the lures when Stan
lord meets Occidental on the Tiger track tomorrow at 2 p.m.
Each school will present more than its share of the fastest runners
in the country in a meet that will in all probability go down to the

relay. But while the running
events figure to be the best of the
meet, the field battles are the
more unpredictable and should
swing the meet one way or the
other.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
will be returning to meet his old
school on its own grounds for the
first time since he came north.
Last year at Stanford, in his first
battle with his ex-boys, the Tigers
came out with a 72-59 victory.
Targets of Oxy
Norman Lloyd and Ernie Cun
liffe are the two Indians whom
the Bengals hope most to beat, or
at least reduce to a point of mini
mum effectiveness. The meet's
first race, the mile, may give a
good indication of just how well
Chuck Coker's pack can pull off
this strategy.
Lloyd figures to win the mile,
although Tod White is good
enough to give him a run for his
money. White's principal object,
besides going for the victory, of
course .will be to force Lloyd to
run so fast that he will be unable
to come back with a strong half
mile. To do this, White will have
to force Stanford's double-record
breaker to hit 4:06 or better—and
it's not too likely White can do
this.
Hadley to Wait
Coker plans to save his best
distance man, Ty Hadley, for the
880 only. Hadley isn't as far
along in conditioning as Ernie
Cunliffe, Stanford's 1:51.0 ace,
and so he'll have his hands full.
Hadley, however, has run as fast
as 1:48.9 during his collegiate ca
reer, and he'll try to reduce Cun
liffe's relay potential.
