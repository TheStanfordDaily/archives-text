# Demonstrators Protest Silently; 335 Sign Presidential Petition
## 
### Dave Quarles Roger Folsom 
Although one poster declared,
"Silence gives consent to govern
ment policies," Stanford's student
protest against continued nuclear
bomb testing was unusually si
lent and required no interference
by the two Stanford policemen
who stood unobtrusively behind
the east gate of the Quad during
much of the protest.
However, members of the or
ganizing committee were jubilant
over the 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
demonstration. Liberian student
Udo Nkamare told The Daily, "As
we planned it, it is a success. Wo
didn't want a loud show. We just
wanted to show our convictions
and to stimulate active thinking
in others."
There was one slight interrup
tion in the peaceful demonstra
tion at 11:30 a.m. when some stu
dents ineffectually waterbombed
the crowd.
The crowd increased between
classes, it was never more
than about 300 strong. Neverthe
less, demonstrators estimated
that about 3000 students were
contacted by the protest.
Critical Thinking
Although the demonstrators
carried such signs as "Nuclear
tests hamper progress toward in
ternational relations," they em
phasized to all listeners that they
did not want converts so much as
critical thinking on the matter.
The major feature of the dem
onstration was a petition to Pres
ident Eisenhower protesting the;
United States' proposed nuclear
tests. By the end of the demon
stration there were 335 signers.
Stationery and a Congressional
Directory were also provided for
students who wished to write
their Senators and Congressmen'
either protesting or encouraging
the nuclear tests.
One student, when asked to
sign a petition, said, "I think if I
signed, I'd get called in to the
NROTC office. The matter refers
to national defense." This NRO
TC regular was afraid that "my
commission might be influenced."
Navy Doesn't Care
However, professor of Naval
Science and Tactics Capt a in
Douglas Brokenshire said that
such a fear was unjustified. "No
one in this office would care" if
NROTC students were involved
in the demonstration in any way,
"provided they don't wear the
uniform."
One student demonstrator in an
NROTC uniform said he believed
that "being in the military does
not obviate believing in solving
problems by peaceful means. L
have an obligation to the Navy
which is paying my way through
school, but I still hold separate
personal convictions."
No Destruction
Dissenters were not lacking.
One student believed that the
rally would harm the reputation
of the University because "radi
cal movements are always associ
ated with Communism." Another
believed that "to stop the nuclear
tests would help Russia economi
cally and militarily." "I can't see
nuclear war going to the extent
of destroying civilization," the
student said.
Betty Branch of the Counseling
and Testing Service expressed
the opinion of many older on
lookers. "It has always been tra
ditional that college and thinking
people question their elders and
the existing system. I am sur
prised there is so little question
ing in this generation. This is the
first demonstration I've seen in
some years."

stration there were 335 signers.
Stationery and a Congressional
Directory were also provided for
students who wished to write
their Senators and Congressmen'
either protesting or encouraging
the nuclear tests.
One student, when asked to
sign a petition, said, "I think if I
signed, I'd get called in to the
NROTC office. The matter refers
to national defense." This NRO
TC regular was afraid that "my
commission might be influenced."
Navy Doesn't Care
However, professor of Naval
Science and Tactics Capt a in
Douglas Brokenshire said that
such a fear was unjustified. "No
one in this office would care" if
NROTC students were involved
in the demonstration in any way,
"provided they don't wear the
uniform."
One student demonstrator in an
NROTC uniform said he believed
that "being in the military does
not obviate believing in solving
problems by peaceful means. L
have an obligation to the Navy
which is paying my way through
school, but I still hold separate
personal convictions."
No Destruction
Dissenters were not lacking.
One student believed that the
rally would harm the reputation
of the University because "radi
cal movements are always associ
ated with Communism." Another
believed that "to stop the nuclear
tests would help Russia economi
cally and militarily." "I can't see
nuclear war going to the extent
of destroying civilization," the
student said.
Betty Branch of the Counseling
and Testing Service expressed
the opinion of many older on
lookers. "It has always been tra
ditional that college and thinking
people question their elders and
the existing system. I am sur
prised there is so little question
ing in this generation. This is the
first demonstration I've seen in
some years."

Although one poster declared,
"Silence gives consent to govern
ment policies," Stanford's student
protest against continued nuclear
bomb testing was unusually si
lent and required no interference
by the two Stanford policemen
who stood unobtrusively behind
the east gate of the Quad during
much of the protest.
However, members of the or
ganizing committee were jubilant
over the 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
demonstration. Liberian student
Udo Nkamare told The Daily, "As
we planned it, it is a success. Wo
didn't want a loud show. We just
wanted to show our convictions
and to stimulate active thinking
in others."
There was one slight interrup
tion in the peaceful demonstra
tion at 11:30 a.m. when some stu
dents ineffectually waterbombed
the crowd.
The crowd increased between
classes, it was never more
than about 300 strong. Neverthe
less, demonstrators estimated
that about 3000 students were
contacted by the protest.
Critical Thinking
Although the demonstrators
carried such signs as "Nuclear
tests hamper progress toward in
ternational relations," they em
phasized to all listeners that they
did not want converts so much as
critical thinking on the matter.
The major feature of the dem
onstration was a petition to Pres
ident Eisenhower protesting the;
United States' proposed nuclear
tests. By the end of the demon
stration there were 335 signers.
