# A 						Worthwhile Project
## 
### 
Tomorrow night Trmgard Seefried, lead so
prano of ihe Vienna Opera, will perform in
Meinorial Auditorium.
Though not too well known in the United
States, Miss Seefried is very popular in Europe,
where she is regarded in the same degree as
Elizabeth Schwartzkopf, who performed bril
liantly here last year.
Tragically enough, lite lirket sales for Miss
Seefried have gone rather poorly. Tragically
because the Merlin and Keio scholars depend

upon the proceeds from this concert, and tragi
cally because Miss Seefried has truly one of the
great soprano voices of our time and deserves
a good audience.
As of yesterday, the Institute of International
Relations stands to lose $800. Not only will
the Associated Students have to make good this
loss, but they will also have to pay the expenses
for the exchange scholars.
This concert is a worthwhile project and
should prove 1o he highly enjoyable. We hope
more students will feel I his way.
