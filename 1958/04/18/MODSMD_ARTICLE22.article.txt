Because of the widespread interest in yester
day's demonstration against nuclear weapons
testing, The Daily took a random sampling of
opinion on the protest.
The question asked was, "What do you think
of the idea of the demonstration and of the man
ner in which it was carried out?"
Dr. Alfred Baez, professor—"l was quite sur
prised to see the number of students that I did.
I was impressed by the kind of planning that
went on—that they called President Sterling to
get his approval before they went ahead."
Russell Barber, Village, graduate—"As long as
it remains orderly I suppose it is all right. They
are calling for rational action, and they should
act rationally or they will defeat their purpose."
Cathy Mcintosh, '60 —"It starts people thinking
about vital issues. I don't go along with what
they are saying, but I like the way they are
doing it."
Doug Newton, Toyon, '60—"I think we should
remember 1938 and Hitler before we stop tests
simply for the reason of lowering the radiation
rate."
Linda Wheeler, Florence Moore, '58—"It is a
very well organized demonstration. Much
thought has gone into its planning. People can
look at both sides of the problem here."
Ken Gottlieb, graduate—"l like it. It makes a
university more than a rah-rah university. It
makes the student body more integrated with

what's going on outside. In Europe and Latin
America, universities play a tremendous part in
government policy."
Linda Livingston, Lagunita, '60—"I am very
impressed by the interest in it. It's just good to
see a little life."
Fred Lipschultz, Stern, '59—"1 guess it is Ihe
best way to have a demonstration. It doesn't
present much of a solution, however. It just says
'stop' and doesn't say how. It's good as far as it
goes, but it doesn't go far enough."
Dave Montgomery, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, '60—
"I think it's the type of thing to wake Stanford
students up. It is more important than ID-cent
Cellar coffee."
3lack Taylor, '59 — "American students are
quiet on the score of world politics, and at least
this shows we are interested and on the ball."
Dick Renshaw, Stern, '59—"It's surprising since
I hear so much about apathy, I think it has been
carried out very well."
Joe Uhrhane, off-campus, '60—"I think it is
being done terrifically. It is being handled very
maturely. I signed the petition. It is a good first
step."
Terry Kistler, off-campus, '59—"1 approve of it.
We ought to let our Government know that we
want to stop H-bomb tests. I don't think it is so
cut and dried that we want to stop it at any cost.
We should let them know that we think jt is a
big issue."

Terry Kistler, off-campus, '59—"1 approve of it.
We ought to let our Government know that we
want to stop H-bomb tests. I don't think it is so
cut and dried that we want to stop it at any cost.
We should let them know that we think jt is a
big issue."
Because of the widespread interest in yester
day's demonstration against nuclear weapons
testing, The Daily took a random sampling of
opinion on the protest.
The question asked was, "What do you think
of the idea of the demonstration and of the man
ner in which it was carried out?"
Dr. Alfred Baez, professor—"l was quite sur
prised to see the number of students that I did.
I was impressed by the kind of planning that
went on—that they called President Sterling to
get his approval before they went ahead."
Russell Barber, Village, graduate—"As long as
it remains orderly I suppose it is all right. They
are calling for rational action, and they should
act rationally or they will defeat their purpose."
Cathy Mcintosh, '60 —"It starts people thinking
about vital issues. I don't go along with what
they are saying, but I like the way they are
doing it."
Doug Newton, Toyon, '60—"I think we should
remember 1938 and Hitler before we stop tests
simply for the reason of lowering the radiation
rate."
Linda Wheeler, Florence Moore, '58—"It is a
very well organized demonstration. Much
thought has gone into its planning. People can
look at both sides of the problem here."
Ken Gottlieb, graduate—"l like it. It makes a
university more than a rah-rah university. It
makes the student body more integrated with

what's going on outside. In Europe and Latin
America, universities play a tremendous part in
government policy."
Linda Livingston, Lagunita, '60—"I am very
impressed by the interest in it. It's just good to
see a little life."
Fred Lipschultz, Stern, '59—"1 guess it is Ihe
best way to have a demonstration. It doesn't
present much of a solution, however. It just says
'stop' and doesn't say how. It's good as far as it
goes, but it doesn't go far enough."
Dave Montgomery, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, '60—
"I think it's the type of thing to wake Stanford
students up. It is more important than ID-cent
Cellar coffee."
3lack Taylor, '59 — "American students are
quiet on the score of world politics, and at least
this shows we are interested and on the ball."
Dick Renshaw, Stern, '59—"It's surprising since
I hear so much about apathy, I think it has been
carried out very well."
Joe Uhrhane, off-campus, '60—"I think it is
being done terrifically. It is being handled very
maturely. I signed the petition. It is a good first
step."
Terry Kistler, off-campus, '59—"1 approve of it.
