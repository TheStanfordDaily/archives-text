Dan ring During Ramadan
Editor, The Daily:
An announcement under the caption "Moslems
Mark End of Fasting" appearing in your Daily
of April 27, at page four, has injured my feelings.
It informed that some Muslim students are going
to have a dance party on April 18, the last but
one day of the month of Ramadan, in which the
Muslims are required to fast from dawn to dusk,
offer additional prayers and bridle their evil de
sires to achieve the pleasure of God.
In this month holy Quran was revealed, and
one of the nights in this month, named Lailat A 1
Qadr, is of special brightness and full blessings.
It is generally believed that the said night is one
of the last 10 nights of the month of Ramadan.
Therefore, some scrupulous Muslims retire in
complete seclusion during the last 10 days and
nighls of (he month to pray God wholeheartedly

and look for the rare and. blessed night.
But it is strange that some Muslim students
are going to indulge in dancing on one of these
crucial nights. According to one school of
thought, social dances are abhorrent to the teach
ings of Islam; but to have them in Ramadan, I
think, will not be approved by Muslims belonging
to any school of thought. Is this the way in
which the religion and culture of Islam are going
to be presented to non-Muslims?
As regards the cause of Algeria, the ends don't
justify the means. Does the Algerian Muslim's
hope for freedom only lie in the funds collected
through dances in the month of Ramadan? I am
sure they will not like such aid.
I know this letter will trouble the sponsors of
the dance, but, being one who professes to be a
Muslim, I could not help giving vent to my
feelings.
