Tyranny Must and fl ill Fail
Editor, The Daily:
The United States is now, as it has always been, agreeable to
suspension or cessation of nuclear testing with adequate controls.
These last three words are the important ones. It is these that have
prevented accomplishment of this goal. The U.S.S.R. says it is agree
able to this principle, but that is all. The Rig Four Geneva conference
was turned into a propaganda showcase for the U.S.S.R., but it
accomplished nothing concrete.
There is a reason for this. The U.S.S.R. says it is willing to agree
to a cessation of nuclear tests with safeguards, because it is desirable
from the Russians' standpoint to do so for propaganda purposes.
But the U.S.S.R. will never implement this talk. It will not because
it cannot. It is bound to certain basic precepts. Among these is that
international Communism must one day control the world.
If one considers only Marxian dogma, one might reach the con
clusion that this was to he simply a natural transformation without
instigation, but when Marxism entered Russia, Lenin changed that.
The "inevitable" is now to be aided. The avowed policy of the Soviet
Union is to PROMOTE by whatever means are available the downfall
of the capitalist countries and to bring the rest of the world under
its rule. That is why we must not be fooled by the present Soviet
"cessation" of tests. They have unilaterally suspended their tests
because they are finished with their most recent series, and the
propaganda they gain thus is invaluable.
So the threat that the United Slates faces today is not the on
slaught of inevitable history but the menace of an oligarchic, im
perialistic nation similar to, but craftier than. Hitler's Germany. The
United States has come to the conclusion, after many bitter disap
pointments, that promises—to its enemies—are only tools to be used
with indiscriminate amorality. So there IS an inevitable that the
United States must face. It is that the U.S.S.R. is and has been
always our enemy, never our friend.
How, then, are we to defend ourselves and, with ourselves, the
democratic principles for which we stand? The only language the
U.S.S.R. understands is MIGHT. As soon as the U.S.S.R. believes
the balance of might sufficiently in her favor to destroy us and our
allies, she will do it—not sooner, not later. As undesirable as it is
and always has been to all of us, we must continually prepare our
selves for battle, developing more and more effective weapons.
Is there, then, any hope at all? Yes, the Hungarian revolution
proves this; the Poznan riots prove this; the East German riots prove
this. It is not modern capitalistic democracy but the "dictatorship
of the proletariat" that contains within itself the seeds of its own
destruction. That is the fact that Orleanists referred to when they
sang, "Contre nous de la tyrannie, I'etendard sanglant est leve."
Tyranny must and will fall. Le jour de gloire arrivera!
So this is the prospect for the future with which we are faced.
But what can we do in a positive way? How can we effectively com
bat propaganda? The answer is simple: with propaganda of our own,
the best propaganda we have—truth! But truth, you see, is not so
much conveyed in words as it is in actions. We need as individuals
and as groups to be scrupulously honest with others. We need to
clear from our own backyards the blots of racial and religious favor
itism and other situations contradictory to our beliefs. We must, in
short, face the world with a purity displayed by actions to counteract,
a purity pretended by words.
Should we, then, stop testing nuclear weapons? Ideally we would
of course wish to do so immediately. As a practical matter, however,
we have found that if our military defense demands them strongly
enough, we cannot. It is hard for us, but we must bear this burden
as long as it is necessary.
David S. Long
It is .just such negative thinking that lias backed llie United
States into its present corner. A complacent trust in the benevo
lent future will not save us. Feur, suspicion ami the idea that
Good is fighting Evil, in the classic black-and-white tradition of
the melodrama, seem to have taken over. We have hut to tell the
world that God is on our side, and we have won. Propaganda is
of little value in itself. It must be accompanied by positive action
toward peace. Building up arms does not fall under this heading.
There is nothing sacred about democracy. True, "le jour de
gloire arrivera" —but for whom? For mankind, we hope.—Editor.

to a cessation of nuclear tests with safeguards, because it is desirable
from the Russians' standpoint to do so for propaganda purposes.
But the U.S.S.R. will never implement this talk. It will not because
it cannot. It is bound to certain basic precepts. Among these is that
international Communism must one day control the world.
If one considers only Marxian dogma, one might reach the con
clusion that this was to he simply a natural transformation without
instigation, but when Marxism entered Russia, Lenin changed that.
The "inevitable" is now to be aided. The avowed policy of the Soviet
Union is to PROMOTE by whatever means are available the downfall
of the capitalist countries and to bring the rest of the world under
its rule. That is why we must not be fooled by the present Soviet
"cessation" of tests. They have unilaterally suspended their tests
because they are finished with their most recent series, and the
propaganda they gain thus is invaluable.
So the threat that the United Slates faces today is not the on
slaught of inevitable history but the menace of an oligarchic, im
perialistic nation similar to, but craftier than. Hitler's Germany. The
United States has come to the conclusion, after many bitter disap
pointments, that promises—to its enemies—are only tools to be used
with indiscriminate amorality. So there IS an inevitable that the
United States must face. It is that the U.S.S.R. is and has been
always our enemy, never our friend.
How, then, are we to defend ourselves and, with ourselves, the
democratic principles for which we stand? The only language the
U.S.S.R. understands is MIGHT. As soon as the U.S.S.R. believes
the balance of might sufficiently in her favor to destroy us and our
allies, she will do it—not sooner, not later. As undesirable as it is
and always has been to all of us, we must continually prepare our
selves for battle, developing more and more effective weapons.
Is there, then, any hope at all? Yes, the Hungarian revolution
proves this; the Poznan riots prove this; the East German riots prove
this. It is not modern capitalistic democracy but the "dictatorship
of the proletariat" that contains within itself the seeds of its own
destruction. That is the fact that Orleanists referred to when they
sang, "Contre nous de la tyrannie, I'etendard sanglant est leve."
Tyranny must and will fall. Le jour de gloire arrivera!
So this is the prospect for the future with which we are faced.
But what can we do in a positive way? How can we effectively com
bat propaganda? The answer is simple: with propaganda of our own,
the best propaganda we have—truth! But truth, you see, is not so
much conveyed in words as it is in actions. We need as individuals
and as groups to be scrupulously honest with others. We need to
clear from our own backyards the blots of racial and religious favor
itism and other situations contradictory to our beliefs. We must, in
short, face the world with a purity displayed by actions to counteract,
a purity pretended by words.
Should we, then, stop testing nuclear weapons? Ideally we would
of course wish to do so immediately. As a practical matter, however,
we have found that if our military defense demands them strongly
enough, we cannot. It is hard for us, but we must bear this burden
as long as it is necessary.

The "inevitable" is now to be aided. The avowed policy of the Soviet
Union is to PROMOTE by whatever means are available the downfall
of the capitalist countries and to bring the rest of the world under
its rule. That is why we must not be fooled by the present Soviet
"cessation" of tests. They have unilaterally suspended their tests
because they are finished with their most recent series, and the
propaganda they gain thus is invaluable.
So the threat that the United Slates faces today is not the on
slaught of inevitable history but the menace of an oligarchic, im
perialistic nation similar to, but craftier than. Hitler's Germany. The
United States has come to the conclusion, after many bitter disap
pointments, that promises—to its enemies—are only tools to be used
with indiscriminate amorality. So there IS an inevitable that the
United States must face. It is that the U.S.S.R. is and has been
always our enemy, never our friend.
How, then, are we to defend ourselves and, with ourselves, the
democratic principles for which we stand? The only language the
U.S.S.R. understands is MIGHT. As soon as the U.S.S.R. believes
the balance of might sufficiently in her favor to destroy us and our
allies, she will do it—not sooner, not later. As undesirable as it is
and always has been to all of us, we must continually prepare our
selves for battle, developing more and more effective weapons.
Is there, then, any hope at all? Yes, the Hungarian revolution
proves this; the Poznan riots prove this; the East German riots prove
this. It is not modern capitalistic democracy but the "dictatorship
of the proletariat" that contains within itself the seeds of its own
destruction. That is the fact that Orleanists referred to when they
sang, "Contre nous de la tyrannie, I'etendard sanglant est leve."
Tyranny must and will fall. Le jour de gloire arrivera!
So this is the prospect for the future with which we are faced.
But what can we do in a positive way? How can we effectively com
bat propaganda? The answer is simple: with propaganda of our own,
the best propaganda we have—truth! But truth, you see, is not so
much conveyed in words as it is in actions. We need as individuals
and as groups to be scrupulously honest with others. We need to
clear from our own backyards the blots of racial and religious favor
itism and other situations contradictory to our beliefs. We must, in
short, face the world with a purity displayed by actions to counteract,
a purity pretended by words.
Should we, then, stop testing nuclear weapons? Ideally we would
of course wish to do so immediately. As a practical matter, however,
we have found that if our military defense demands them strongly
enough, we cannot. It is hard for us, but we must bear this burden
as long as it is necessary.

It is .just such negative thinking that lias backed llie United
States into its present corner. A complacent trust in the benevo
lent future will not save us. Feur, suspicion ami the idea that
Good is fighting Evil, in the classic black-and-white tradition of
the melodrama, seem to have taken over. We have hut to tell the
world that God is on our side, and we have won. Propaganda is
of little value in itself. It must be accompanied by positive action
toward peace. Building up arms does not fall under this heading.

Tyranny Must and fl ill Fail
Editor, The Daily:
The United States is now, as it has always been, agreeable to
suspension or cessation of nuclear testing with adequate controls.
These last three words are the important ones. It is these that have
prevented accomplishment of this goal. The U.S.S.R. says it is agree
able to this principle, but that is all. The Rig Four Geneva conference
was turned into a propaganda showcase for the U.S.S.R., but it
accomplished nothing concrete.
There is a reason for this. The U.S.S.R. says it is willing to agree
to a cessation of nuclear tests with safeguards, because it is desirable
from the Russians' standpoint to do so for propaganda purposes.
But the U.S.S.R. will never implement this talk. It will not because
it cannot. It is bound to certain basic precepts. Among these is that
international Communism must one day control the world.
If one considers only Marxian dogma, one might reach the con
clusion that this was to he simply a natural transformation without
instigation, but when Marxism entered Russia, Lenin changed that.
