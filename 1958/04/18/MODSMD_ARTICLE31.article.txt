# Stanford Netters Favored to Whip Very Weak Cal Squad
## 
### 
This year's first of two Big
Matches between the California
and Stanford tennis teams might
prove to be one of the biggest
runaways of the traditional se
ries.
The match scheduled for 1 p.m.
tomorrow at Stanford will pit one
of the weakest teams in Cal his
tory against one of Stanford's
strongest.
Both teams spent last weekend
in Los Angeles losing to USC and
UCLA but the difference was
that where Stanford put up a
close struggle Cal could not even
gain a set off their southern ri
vals.
Earlier this season the two
teams met indirectly through
play in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships. It
was that tourney that Stanford
swept and gained 2G points to
Cal's lowly two.
Tomorrow Cal will use the
same six men they used in the
Northern California tourney:
Gulden Lloyd, Chuck Raymer,
Sheldon Diller, Keilh Hamilton,
Warren Sisson and Paul Cohen in
the one through six positions re
spectively.
Stanford's Coach Bob .Renker
expects to use his regular top six
in singles: Jack Douglas, Brooks
Rawlins, Dave Nelson, Lowell
Carruth, Jim Jeffries and Gil
White or Robin Hilgeman. If the
singles result in a six - match
sweep for Stanford as most ob
servers predict, Coach Renker

will try a few newcomers in the
doubles competition.
Of these reserves Dick Mosk,
Gil Ranney, Bob Bowden and A 1
Gallaway seem to be the most
likely to see action.
In the morning as preliminary
to the varsity match the fresh
man teams will play. The num
ber one freshman singles match
may prove to be the best match
of the entire day with Stanford's
Dick Ogden meeting Art Kono of
California. The freshman match
will get under way at 10 a.m.
with Stanford using a team made
up of Ogden, Norm Karns, Ev
Moulton, George Bates, Bob Ba
ker, Phil Odegard and John Ha
yek.
These same frosh netters will
also see action this afternoon
against Burlingame High School
as a 1 uneup match for their Sat
urday morning encounter.
