# Quad Selects '58-59 Editor, Biz Manager
## 
### 
The Stanford Quad announced
today that they have elected Bob
Burco as their 1959 editor. Burco
was this year's copy editor.
Burco has followed the trend
of the last three years in that he
has been elected editor while ma
joring in engineering. While at
Stanford, Burco lives off campus
and makes his permanent home
in Vancouver, Wash.
The Quad chose as its business
manager Ron Casentini. Casen
tini majors in chemistry and
makes his home in San Francisco.
On campus he lives at Stern Hall.
The two newly elected men will
choose the remainder of their
staff next week.
