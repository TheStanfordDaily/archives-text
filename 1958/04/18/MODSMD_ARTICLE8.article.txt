# Test Risks On A-Bomb Calculated

(Editor's Note: This is the
third article presenting current
views on the nuclear bomb test
ing controversy.)

Whether or not the United
States will stop nuclear bomb
tests must be decided without re
gard to what other powers of the
world decide to do. The Soviet
Union decided to stop the tests
on this basis, but may begin them
again if the West doesn't follow
suit.
The Soviet Union just finished
a series last month, and of course
the United States is about to be
gin a test series.
In the past the Soviets have
objected to monitoring stations
for detecting test ban violations.
But on April 5 Khrushchev agreed
to inspection â€” although he did
not give any details as to what
this inspection would consist of;
how many monitoring stations he
would permit.
Inspection may not be neces
sary. The United States usually
knows when the Russians have
set off a nuclear blast, through
instruments located in the free
world.
Stations Needed
One authority (physicist Jay
Orear at Columbia University)
states that 22 monitoring stations
would be needed to check up on
the Soviets. Even so, blasts less
powerful than the one at Hiro
shima, blasts set off much higher
than usual or underground blasts
(which do not endanger the
world's health, as they do not
spread any radioactive fallout)
could not be detected.
The position of the United
States is that we will not agree to
stopping tests trilaterally, even
with thorough inspection, unless
the agreement also prohibits nu
clear weapons production.
We do not feel that stopping
the tests, even with inspection, is
enough. We insist that atomic
stockpiling cease also.
Policy "Under Review"
Yet Secretary Dulles has said
that this policy is "under review."
If the test series which is about
to begin "answers our scientists'
questions," our position may be
revised.
We might even decide on uni
lateral stopping of tests, and the
Eisenhower Administration would
probably agree to a trilateral
agreement on stopping them with
thorough inspection, ignoring the
question of nuclear arms produc
tion for the present.
If the United States should stop
her nuclear bomb tests, the world
would be healthier, our allies and
potential allies would be happier,
