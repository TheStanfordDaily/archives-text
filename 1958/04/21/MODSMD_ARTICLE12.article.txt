# Largest Accelerator May Be Situated at Stanford
## Project M To Be Built In Tunnel 
### Camille de Campos 
Stanford will soon be the site
of the world's largest linear elec
tron accelerator if the project is
approved by federal agencies.
This was disclosed by Professor
L. I. Schiff, executive head of the
Physics Department, at the an
nual Stanford Alumni Confer
ence in Salt Lake City.
He revealed that the gigantic,
super-power Project M. 45 Bcv
(billion electron volts) would be
comparable in energy with all
other contemplated accelerators
and have a thousand times great
er intensity. The highest energy
existing accelerator is a 10-Bev
proton machine in the Soviet Un
ion.
The construction does not in
volve new principle or design.
Stanford already has the 770-mil
lion-electron-volt Mark 111 accel
erator.
Located in Tunnel
Project M, which stands for ei
ther Multi-Bev or Monster, will
be 50 times longer than the ex
isting 220-foot machine and will
be located in a tunnel instead of
a building shielded by concrete
blocks. The two-mile long tube
will be powered by a thousand
by a thousand giant klystron
tubes, as compared to the 21 on
the present unit. It is unique
among accelerators as all other
very high energy machines accel
erate protons.
Linear accelerators are used in
the study of sub-atomic particles.
The higher energy of the Mon
ster will make possible the obser
vation of finer detail, and pro
duce a greater variety of changes
in ordinary matter.
The University has reserved
410 acres for the project. Located
tast and southeast of the academ
ic campus, the accelerator will ex
tend from a point near the golf
course to the intersection of Ju
nipero Serra and Page Mill Road.
$15 Million Budget.
The cost has been stated in
terms of an annual budget esti
mated at $15 million. It. is com
parable with the entire Univer
sity acadcmic budget of $20 mil
lion. The total would be about
$105 million for the seven-year
construction period.
Professor E. L. Ginzton of the
Physics and Electrical Engineer
ing Departments, present direc
tor of the Microwave Laboratory,
will assume direction of the proj
ect from approval through com
pletion of the construction phase,
and Professor W. K. H. Panofsky,
director of the High-Energy Phys
ics Department, will participate
in the initial design stages.
Dr. Schiff evaluated the pro
gram in this way: "The Physics
Department must maintain and
expand its present strength and
diversity in the whole broad area,
just as Stanford must maintain
and expand its strength in many
different disciplines in the sci
ences, humanities and profession
al schools. This is especially vital
for a privately-endowed univer
sity such as Stanford."


PROPOSED LOCATION ON CAMPUS OF WORLD'S LARGEST LINEAR ACCELERATOR
The accelerator, which has an intensity 1000 times greater than the largest in existence, will be in
the foothills behind campus. The labels are: (a) Lagunita, (b) Wilbur Hall, (c) Page Mill Road, (d)
Junipero Serra Boulevard, (e) the accelerator, (f) Quad.

PROPOSED LOCATION ON CAMPUS OF WORLD'S LARGEST LINEAR ACCELERATOR
The accelerator, which has an intensity 1000 times greater than the largest in existence, will be in
the foothills behind campus. The labels are: (a) Lagunita, (b) Wilbur Hall, (c) Page Mill Road, (d)
Junipero Serra Boulevard, (e) the accelerator, (f) Quad.
Stanford will soon be the site
of the world's largest linear elec
tron accelerator if the project is
approved by federal agencies.
This was disclosed by Professor
L. I. Schiff, executive head of the
Physics Department, at the an
nual Stanford Alumni Confer
ence in Salt Lake City.
He revealed that the gigantic,
super-power Project M. 45 Bcv
(billion electron volts) would be
comparable in energy with all
other contemplated accelerators
and have a thousand times great
er intensity. The highest energy
existing accelerator is a 10-Bev
proton machine in the Soviet Un
ion.
The construction does not in
volve new principle or design.
Stanford already has the 770-mil
lion-electron-volt Mark 111 accel
erator.
Located in Tunnel
Project M, which stands for ei
ther Multi-Bev or Monster, will
be 50 times longer than the ex
isting 220-foot machine and will
be located in a tunnel instead of
a building shielded by concrete
blocks. The two-mile long tube
will be powered by a thousand
by a thousand giant klystron
tubes, as compared to the 21 on
the present unit. It is unique
among accelerators as all other
very high energy machines accel
erate protons.
Linear accelerators are used in
the study of sub-atomic particles.
The higher energy of the Mon
ster will make possible the obser
vation of finer detail, and pro
duce a greater variety of changes
in ordinary matter.
The University has reserved
410 acres for the project. Located
tast and southeast of the academ
ic campus, the accelerator will ex
tend from a point near the golf
course to the intersection of Ju
nipero Serra and Page Mill Road.
$15 Million Budget.
The cost has been stated in
terms of an annual budget esti
mated at $15 million. It. is com
parable with the entire Univer
sity acadcmic budget of $20 mil
lion. The total would be about
$105 million for the seven-year
construction period.
Professor E. L. Ginzton of the
Physics and Electrical Engineer
ing Departments, present direc
tor of the Microwave Laboratory,
will assume direction of the proj
ect from approval through com
pletion of the construction phase,
and Professor W. K. H. Panofsky,
director of the High-Energy Phys
ics Department, will participate
in the initial design stages.
Dr. Schiff evaluated the pro
gram in this way: "The Physics
Department must maintain and
expand its present strength and
diversity in the whole broad area,
just as Stanford must maintain
and expand its strength in many
different disciplines in the sci
ences, humanities and profession
al schools. This is especially vital
for a privately-endowed univer
sity such as Stanford."
