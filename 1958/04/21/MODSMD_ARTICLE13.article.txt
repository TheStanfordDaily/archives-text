# Seefried Shows Musicianship In Scholarship Fund Concert
## 
### Bob Christiansen 
Saturday evening's Liedor rccital by soprano Irmgard Seefi'ied,
sponsored by the Concert Series for the lIR Scholarship Fund, was
the finest blend of sheer vocalism and thoughtful musicianship that
has been presented on this campus in many years. Miss Seefried
showed more artistic integrity than has been revealed by any of
Â± ~ ...

the recent Concert Series artists.
The first half of the concert in
cluded Lieder set to poems of
Heinrich Heine. Four Schumann
songs were followed by songs of
Mendelssohn, Franz, Brahms and
Rich a r d Strauss. The songs
ranged from Mendelssohn's lyri
cal "Auf Flugeln des Gesanges"
to Brahms' intensely dramatic
"Dor Tori, das ist die kiihle
Nacht." Miss Seefried showed
here, as in everything she sang,
that she completely understands
the Lieder medium.
The second half of the concert
included If) Morike Lieder by
Hugo Wolf. Each of these songs
was beautifully interpreted by
Miss Seefried. From Ihe calm re
flection of "Verborgenheit" to the
pure fantasy of "Mausfallensprii
lein," each song was an artistic
wholeeach word, each thought,
a complete artistic concept.
Miss Secfriod was accompanied
by Paul Ulanowsky, long-time ac
companist to Lotte Lehmann.
Ulanowsky's interpretations were
totally comparable to Secfricd's.
The recital was very well re
ceived by a disappointingly small
but highly enthusiastic audience.
For once, there was no darting
for the exits before the first en
core.
Miss Seefried's encores in
cluded "Standchen" and "Wiegen
iiod" by Richard Strauss and
"Auf dem Wasser zu singen" and
"Seligkeit" by Schubert.
