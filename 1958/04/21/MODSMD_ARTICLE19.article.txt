# Lethal Anachronism

Thf, D.A.R. urges the United Slates to witli
«lr;iw from the United Nations; Representative
W alter calls Norman Thomas and Dr. Pauling
Communists because of llieir concern for tlie
world effects of nuclear testing; and a school
system outlaws any mention of the UN. This is
how a portion of the United States wants to fight
a philosophy contained in the sentence "Vi ork
ingmen of all countries, unite!"
Marx had mastered in 1848 what the U.S. still
docs not fully understand—one-worldisni, the
key to existence in the modern world.
At the present time one-worldism is essential
not only to living peacefully but to living at all.
Barbara Ward succinctly put the problem to
her Stanford audience last winter: "We live in
a world community of destruction.*'
However, if we live in a world community of
destruction, we also live in a world-community
of mankind; and it is only through the recogni
tion of the latter that the former may be
avoided. Such a recognition is the basis of one
worldism.
The philosophy of one - worldism is one
which demands that the best interests of all
mankind be considered first before any action
is taken, whether it be nuclear testing or a
summit conference. One-worldisni is an ap
proach to all problems which requires personal
and national sacrifices, but which assures maxi
mum world cooperation—the only condition
that will ever lead lo resolving the present
world crisis.

Analytic thinking on a world basis being the
core of one-worldism, Representative Walter's
action nmsl certainly be recognized as hasty
and unwise. Dr. Pauling and Norman Thomas
are admired by quite a few people in many
other countries as well as in the U.S.; and when
I hey are attacked because of their concern for
humanity, the result can only be adverse.
Although grave errors are being made, one
must not forget that the U.S. has taken some
very great and encouraging steps toward one
worldism. The United Nations and President
Eisenhower's 1953 atoms-for-peace proposal
may definitely be looked at with pride.
If we are to take any steps toward peace
through one-worldism, we must train ourselves
to think in world terms. Just like any other
lesson which is difficult to learn, one-worldism
must be taught to our children as early as pos
sible. In the face of these facts communities
such as Houston, Tex., are effectively outlawing
any mention of world politics and the United
Nations in their school systems. This kind of
action can be nothing but a suicidal intellec
tual "recession"' in the present world situation.
One-worldism can never claim to solve world
problems overnight. It is a means to the goal
of peace. It is a kind of thinking based on the
welfare and survival of mankind in the atomic
age through world cooperation and founded on
the recognition of chauvinism as a lethal anach
ronism.
