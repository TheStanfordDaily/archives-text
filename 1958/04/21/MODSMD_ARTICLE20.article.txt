# Want of Courage?
## 
### 
CoNGRA'II LATIOiYS arc due the 67 students who
organized Thursday's demonstration against
nuclear testing. Despite the Chronicle's "placid
campus , and the Examiner's "holiday atmos
phere, Stanford students proved Thursday
they can actually be serious about something
off-campus.
Every student has an obligation to think.
However, many times our thinking is so occu
pied with studies and personal affairs that v\e
forget to think about our future.
for this reason I hursday's demonstration is
extremely important. Not only did it reveal
that there are students at Stanford who have
strong enough political convictions to make
them known publicly in a dignified manner,
hut it stimulated thought in the minds of many
students who had no previous opinion on the
issue.
I he only discouraging thing about the dem

onstration was the water-bombing. This action
could only have been clone by students who
cannot take their own futures seriously or who
<lo not have llie courage to face the problem.
Certainly the demonstrators showed their ma
turity by ignoring the action.
Perhaps it is Ihis want of courage which lias
caused Ihe noticeable lack of demonstrations
at Stanford in the past. Even at Thursday's
protest such comments as "I'd be ashamed if
anyone knew I was here"' were heard iu the
crowd. Why should anyone be ashamed to be
present at a meeting of thinking students trying
to resolve their futures, unless he is afraid to
think?
No one can doubt the seriousness of the
nuclear question. The consequences will be
catastrophic if the problem is not decided cor
rectly one way or the other. We students must
take our share of the responsibility for answer
ing the nuclear question.
