## 
### 
W ASHINGTON (A>) — The
Daughters of the American Revo
lution, after sharp debate, voted
yesterday [Wednesday, April IG|
to urge U.S. withdrawal from the
United Nations.
The delegates also came out
against mixed marriages among
the races, called for quick end to
foreign aid and for withdrawal of
recognition of Russia and its sat
ellites.
Another resolution expressed
criticism of the National Council
of Churches of Christ in America
for what the DAR termed its "po
litical, socialistic and one-world
activities." This drew protests
that the DAR was invading the
field of religious freedom, but
only after four delegates stood to
oppose the final action.
The UN issue brought the big
gest opposition—about 75 votes.
The resolution not only urged
withdrawal from the UN, but
suggested the UN' be ousted from
U.S. soil. It has a skyscraper
headquarters in New York City.
