# Drive to Honor Sam McDonald
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
This year's Con Home Drive
will have one note of sadness —
the absence of the Convalescent
Home's most staunch supporter
since its founding in 1919 Em
manuel B. '"Sam" McDonald.
Sam won't be forgotten during
the week he most looked forward
to, however, for all money col
lected during the week of April
28 through May 3 for the Con
Home will be placed in the "Sam
McDonald Memorial Fund."
Sam came to Stanford 54 years
ago, working his way up from
teamster to superintendent of the
athletic buildings and grounds.
He retired in 1954—t0 write, visit
with his friends and philosophize
with his favorite visitors, stu
dents.
Plants* Garden
Perhaps more responsible for
the success of the Con Home than
any one individual, Sam befriend
ed thousands of children in their
recovery from non-communicable
diseases. During World War II
he planned, planted and main
tained a 20-acre Victory Garden
at the Home. Its vegetables sup
plied the children throughout the
year. '
In previous years Sam cooked
and directed the famous barbecue
during Con Home Week. One
day of each Con Home drive was
dedicated to Sam and the amaz

ing work he had done for the
home.
The royalties from "Sam Mc-
Donald's Farm," a book written
by Sam a few years ago, all went
to the Con Home.
1000 Friends
Sam's home on campus, near
the fool ball stadium, bore many
mottoes on its walls reflecting
Sam's philosophy. They were not
simply coined phrases, but origi
nal ones written by Sam. One
which best reflected his philoso
phy of giving and friendship read,
"He who has a thousand friends
has not a one to spare."
This is the motto Sam kept in
whatever he did, particularly wilh

Con Home, for he highly valued
the friendship of all of the chil
dren, and the friendships he made
with the Stanford student body
during Con Home Week.
fn his generosity, Sam willed
most of his estate to the Con
Home; his 450-aere wildlife sanc
tuary at La Honda was willed to
the students upon his death late
last year.

to, however, for all money col
lected during the week of April

Home will be placed in the "Sam
McDonald Memorial Fund."
Sam came to Stanford 54 years
ago, working his way up from
teamster to superintendent of the
athletic buildings and grounds.
He retired in 1954—t0 write, visit
with his friends and philosophize
with his favorite visitors, stu
dents.

Perhaps more responsible for
the success of the Con Home than
any one individual, Sam befriend
ed thousands of children in their
recovery from non-communicable
diseases. During World War II
he planned, planted and main
tained a 20-acre Victory Garden
at the Home. Its vegetables sup
plied the children throughout the
year. '
In previous years Sam cooked
and directed the famous barbecue
during Con Home Week. One
day of each Con Home drive was
dedicated to Sam and the amaz

ing work he had done for the
home.
The royalties from "Sam Mc-
Donald's Farm," a book written
by Sam a few years ago, all went
to the Con Home.
1000 Friends
Sam's home on campus, near
the fool ball stadium, bore many
mottoes on its walls reflecting
Sam's philosophy. They were not
simply coined phrases, but origi
nal ones written by Sam. One
which best reflected his philoso
phy of giving and friendship read,
"He who has a thousand friends
has not a one to spare."
This is the motto Sam kept in
whatever he did, particularly wilh

Con Home, for he highly valued
the friendship of all of the chil
dren, and the friendships he made
with the Stanford student body
during Con Home Week.
fn his generosity, Sam willed
most of his estate to the Con
Home; his 450-aere wildlife sanc
tuary at La Honda was willed to
the students upon his death late
last year.
