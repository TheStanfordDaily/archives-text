# What's it like to be with IBM?
## 
### 
"What really sold me," says Gerald Maley, "was the
way they approach engineering at IBM. I had expected
rooms full of engineers at desks. Instead, I found all the
friendly informality of my college lab."
An E.E., he came directly to IBM from the University
of Buffalo in 1953. Starting as a Technical Engineer,
he was immediately assigned to work, with two others,
on designing a small calculator. Jerry Maley learned
a great deal about computers in a very short time. Inci
dentally, this small calculator has gone into production.
"It makes an engineer feel good," he says, "to see his
project reach the production stage—and to be able to
follow it through."
Promoted to Associate Engineer after sixteen months,
he became the leader of a nine-man team, assigning
problems to his group for solution, approving their
block diagrams and the models they built. A short
while ago, he was again promoted —this time to

Project Engineer. "A
particularly interesting
aspect of my present
job," Jerry Maley says,
"is the further devel
opment of magnetic
cores —new memory
storage devices for elec
tronic digital compu
ters." His administra
tive details have been
reduced to a minimum,
freeing him for creative
engineering work.

Perhaps an hour a day goes into paper work such as
requisitioning equipment for his group and reviewing
technical publications, in counseling members of his
team, and preparing for trips to technical society
meetings. ,
Why he chose IBM
Of course, there were many reasons why Jerry Maley
selected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers,
and 1BM is a leader in computer technology. He comes
from a scientific family (his brother is a mathematician),
and is fascinated by these IBM mathematical marvels
which are revolutionizing ways of doing things in so
many fields. He enjoys working on large equipment...
and on "pulses." "It's more logical," he says. "In com
puter work, you can actually see electronics at work.
And it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this

field is so new, you're contributing along with every
body else in a short time." He endorses the IBM

policy of promoting
from within, with merit
the sole criterion. The
salary factor, although
it was excellent, was
not his first employ
ment consideration, he
recalls. The tremen
dous advancement po
tential was of greater
importance.

What about promotions?
When asked about advancement opportunities at IBM,
he says, "You can hardly miss in this field and in this
company. IBM sales have doubled, on the average,
every five years. Company expansion r,t this rate—

in a dynamic industry
makes my future look
bright indeed." Since
Jerry Maley came
with IBM in 1953,
career opportunities
at IBM are brighter
than ever, as all busi
ness, industry, science
and government turn
increasingly to auto
mation through elec
tronic computers.

Product Development Engineer Gerald A. Maley, like
many other engineers, mathematicians and physicists,
came to IBM directly from college. Here he tells how
he put his E.E. degree to work in the exciting new field
of computer development. i


Assigning problem to group member


Testing a new development


Reviewing technical publications
"What really sold me," says Gerald Maley, "was the
way they approach engineering at IBM. I had expected
rooms full of engineers at desks. Instead, I found all the
friendly informality of my college lab."
An E.E., he came directly to IBM from the University
of Buffalo in 1953. Starting as a Technical Engineer,
he was immediately assigned to work, with two others,
on designing a small calculator. Jerry Maley learned
a great deal about computers in a very short time. Inci
dentally, this small calculator has gone into production.
"It makes an engineer feel good," he says, "to see his
project reach the production stage—and to be able to
follow it through."
Promoted to Associate Engineer after sixteen months,
he became the leader of a nine-man team, assigning
problems to his group for solution, approving their
block diagrams and the models they built. A short
while ago, he was again promoted —this time to

Project Engineer. "A
particularly interesting
aspect of my present
job," Jerry Maley says,
"is the further devel
opment of magnetic
cores —new memory
storage devices for elec
tronic digital compu
ters." His administra
tive details have been
reduced to a minimum,
freeing him for creative
engineering work.

Perhaps an hour a day goes into paper work such as
requisitioning equipment for his group and reviewing
technical publications, in counseling members of his
team, and preparing for trips to technical society
meetings. ,
Why he chose IBM
Of course, there were many reasons why Jerry Maley
selected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers,
and 1BM is a leader in computer technology. He comes
from a scientific family (his brother is a mathematician),
and is fascinated by these IBM mathematical marvels
which are revolutionizing ways of doing things in so
many fields. He enjoys working on large equipment...
and on "pulses." "It's more logical," he says. "In com
puter work, you can actually see electronics at work.
And it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this

field is so new, you're contributing along with every
body else in a short time." He endorses the IBM

policy of promoting
from within, with merit
the sole criterion. The
salary factor, although
it was excellent, was
not his first employ
ment consideration, he
recalls. The tremen
dous advancement po
tential was of greater
importance.

What about promotions?
When asked about advancement opportunities at IBM,
he says, "You can hardly miss in this field and in this
company. IBM sales have doubled, on the average,
every five years. Company expansion r,t this rate—

in a dynamic industry
makes my future look
bright indeed." Since
Jerry Maley came
with IBM in 1953,
career opportunities
at IBM are brighter
than ever, as all busi
ness, industry, science
and government turn
increasingly to auto
mation through elec
tronic computers.

This profile is just one example of what it's like to he
with IBM. There are many other excellent opportuni
ties for well-qualified college men in Research, Devel
opment, Manufacturing, Sales and Applied Science.
Why not ask your College Placement Director when
IBM will next interview on your campus? Or, for in
formation about how your degree will fit you for an
IBM career, just write to:

Product Development Engineer Gerald A. Maley, like
many other engineers, mathematicians and physicists,
came to IBM directly from college. Here he tells how
he put his E.E. degree to work in the exciting new field
of computer development. i

"What really sold me," says Gerald Maley, "was the
way they approach engineering at IBM. I had expected
rooms full of engineers at desks. Instead, I found all the
friendly informality of my college lab."
An E.E., he came directly to IBM from the University
of Buffalo in 1953. Starting as a Technical Engineer,
he was immediately assigned to work, with two others,
on designing a small calculator. Jerry Maley learned
a great deal about computers in a very short time. Inci
dentally, this small calculator has gone into production.
"It makes an engineer feel good," he says, "to see his
project reach the production stage—and to be able to
follow it through."
Promoted to Associate Engineer after sixteen months,
he became the leader of a nine-man team, assigning
problems to his group for solution, approving their
block diagrams and the models they built. A short
while ago, he was again promoted —this time to

Project Engineer. "A
particularly interesting
aspect of my present
job," Jerry Maley says,
"is the further devel
opment of magnetic
cores —new memory
storage devices for elec
tronic digital compu
ters." His administra
tive details have been
reduced to a minimum,
freeing him for creative
engineering work.

Perhaps an hour a day goes into paper work such as
requisitioning equipment for his group and reviewing
technical publications, in counseling members of his
team, and preparing for trips to technical society
meetings. ,
Why he chose IBM
Of course, there were many reasons why Jerry Maley
selected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers,
and 1BM is a leader in computer technology. He comes
from a scientific family (his brother is a mathematician),
and is fascinated by these IBM mathematical marvels
which are revolutionizing ways of doing things in so
many fields. He enjoys working on large equipment...
and on "pulses." "It's more logical," he says. "In com
puter work, you can actually see electronics at work.
And it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this

field is so new, you're contributing along with every
body else in a short time." He endorses the IBM

policy of promoting
from within, with merit
the sole criterion. The
salary factor, although
it was excellent, was
not his first employ
ment consideration, he
recalls. The tremen
dous advancement po
tential was of greater
importance.

What about promotions?
When asked about advancement opportunities at IBM,
he says, "You can hardly miss in this field and in this
company. IBM sales have doubled, on the average,
every five years. Company expansion r,t this rate—

in a dynamic industry
makes my future look
bright indeed." Since
Jerry Maley came
with IBM in 1953,
career opportunities
at IBM are brighter
than ever, as all busi
ness, industry, science
and government turn
increasingly to auto
mation through elec
tronic computers.
