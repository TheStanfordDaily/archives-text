# Lloyd, Cobb Win Twice
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford strategy worked in the mile and 880, but Occidental plans and come-through performances
were present in almost every other event as the Tigers swamped the Indians, 78' ; -52".i, Saturday at
Patterson Field.
Norman Lloyd and Chuck Cobb each won two first places for the Cards, but Oxy took nine other
events. Stanford also won the relay and shared first place in the high jump.
Lloyd's performance was by far the best from the Stanford point of view. lie opened the meet with

a leisurely 4:17 victory in the
mile, just as was planned.
This left him with plenty of
punch tor the 880 as he went in
against teammate Ernie Cunliffe
and Oxy's Ty Hadley in what was
billed as the meet's best race.
Cunliffe led for 6(50 yards, with
fractions ol' 25.0, 54.6 and 1:22.
Lloyd was a yard back most of
the way, with Hadley another
yard behind.
A 1 the 660 polo, all three men
pulled even, and then Lloyd and
Hadley moved ahead. The two
ran neck-and-neck for 140 yards,
then Lloyd left Hadley practically
Standing still. The lanky Indian
pulled out all the stops and hit
the tape in 1:49.2, cracking his
own week-old Stanford record of
1:50.5 and shattering the meet
standard of 1:52.6, set by John
Barnes in 1952.
Lloyd's time also increased his
margin as the nation's leading
half-miler thus far in 1958.
Hadley held on for second place
in 1:49.8, Cunliffe was third in
1:51.2, and Oxy's Dave Reisbord
closed well for a 1:51.4 fourth
place clocking.
Lloyd and Tod White loafed
through a 3:19 for the first three
quarters in the mile as White
failed in his effort to tire Lloyd
for the 880. They kicked most of
the final lap, but. then Lloyd left
White with 110 yards to go. His
final lap was run in 58 seconds.
Cobb Wins Hurdles
Cobb had a tough fight with
Oxy's Clarence Treat in both hur
dle races, but came on strong in
each to win in 14.1 and 23.4.
Cobb beat his own meet mark of
23.5 in the lows and erased his
old standard of 14.4 in the highs.
Elsewhere, Ihe meet was pri
marily a story of best-ever marks
by Tigers and routine or less ef
forts by Stanford. Jon Jamison,
the javelin-high jump expert who
strained his back two days ago
and was declared out of the meet
by Coach Chuck Coker, showed
up —as expected — and lied for
first in the high jump and took
second in the spear throw.
The real javelin surprise was
Dick Mollis, who threw 237-5, his
best mark by more than 25 feet.

Stanford was a victim of final
efforts in the broad jump and
shot - put. Rick Schmidt went
from second to first over A 1 Pe
terson with a final jump of 24
feet, and Jon Visel passed up
Chris Plain on his last throw for
third in the shot.
Plain, on his last effort, had
gone 50-% to take over the show
spot, but then Visel put one out
over 52 feet — four feet better
than his previous best. Jerry
Winters was the only Indian shot
putter to look good as he threw
52-9 for second.
Winters gave Stanford its only
weight points, since Oxy swept
the javelin and discus against me
diocre Indian performances.
Chesarek Second in 440
Oxy continued its mastery over
Don Chesarek in the 440. This
time it was John Zetzman who
came home first, although he ran
only 48.1. Chesarek was far be
hind in 48.9.
Bolh Chesarek and Dick Las
sen started far too slow, leaving
Oxy with three men in command
al the 220. Chesarek finally made
a move, but he was much too late
to win.
Dean Smith gave Rudy Alston
a run for his money in the
sprints, but lost by inches in each
after leading 20 yards from the
tape. Winning times of 9.8 and
21.5 were far from Alston's best.
Stanford's relay victory was a
good one, but anticlimactic. By
the time the relay ran, Oxy had
the meet wrapped up and taken
home. The Tigers, in fact, were
almost sure winners as soon as
the javelin and 440 results were
posted.
Lloyd had the best leg on the
relay—47.s. The team time was

3:13.9, more than two seconds
slower than last week's 3:11.4.
Still it bettered the old meet rec
ord of 3:15.0.

fractions ol' 25.0, 54.6 and 1:22.
Lloyd was a yard back most of
the way, with Hadley another
yard behind.
A 1 the 660 polo, all three men
pulled even, and then Lloyd and
Hadley moved ahead. The two
ran neck-and-neck for 140 yards,
then Lloyd left Hadley practically
Standing still. The lanky Indian
pulled out all the stops and hit
the tape in 1:49.2, cracking his
own week-old Stanford record of
1:50.5 and shattering the meet
standard of 1:52.6, set by John
Barnes in 1952.
Lloyd's time also increased his
margin as the nation's leading
half-miler thus far in 1958.
Hadley held on for second place
in 1:49.8, Cunliffe was third in
1:51.2, and Oxy's Dave Reisbord
closed well for a 1:51.4 fourth
place clocking.
Lloyd and Tod White loafed
through a 3:19 for the first three
quarters in the mile as White
failed in his effort to tire Lloyd
for the 880. They kicked most of
the final lap, but. then Lloyd left
White with 110 yards to go. His
final lap was run in 58 seconds.
Cobb Wins Hurdles
Cobb had a tough fight with
Oxy's Clarence Treat in both hur
dle races, but came on strong in
each to win in 14.1 and 23.4.
Cobb beat his own meet mark of
23.5 in the lows and erased his
old standard of 14.4 in the highs.
Elsewhere, Ihe meet was pri
marily a story of best-ever marks
by Tigers and routine or less ef
forts by Stanford. Jon Jamison,
the javelin-high jump expert who
strained his back two days ago
and was declared out of the meet
by Coach Chuck Coker, showed
up —as expected — and lied for
first in the high jump and took
second in the spear throw.
The real javelin surprise was
Dick Mollis, who threw 237-5, his
best mark by more than 25 feet.

Stanford was a victim of final
efforts in the broad jump and
shot - put. Rick Schmidt went
from second to first over A 1 Pe
terson with a final jump of 24
feet, and Jon Visel passed up
Chris Plain on his last throw for
third in the shot.
Plain, on his last effort, had
gone 50-% to take over the show
spot, but then Visel put one out
over 52 feet — four feet better
than his previous best. Jerry
Winters was the only Indian shot
putter to look good as he threw
52-9 for second.
Winters gave Stanford its only
weight points, since Oxy swept
the javelin and discus against me
diocre Indian performances.
Chesarek Second in 440
Oxy continued its mastery over
Don Chesarek in the 440. This
time it was John Zetzman who
came home first, although he ran
only 48.1. Chesarek was far be
hind in 48.9.
Bolh Chesarek and Dick Las
sen started far too slow, leaving
Oxy with three men in command
al the 220. Chesarek finally made
a move, but he was much too late
to win.
Dean Smith gave Rudy Alston
a run for his money in the
sprints, but lost by inches in each
after leading 20 yards from the
tape. Winning times of 9.8 and
21.5 were far from Alston's best.
Stanford's relay victory was a
good one, but anticlimactic. By
the time the relay ran, Oxy had
the meet wrapped up and taken
home. The Tigers, in fact, were
almost sure winners as soon as
the javelin and 440 results were
posted.
Lloyd had the best leg on the
relay—47.s. The team time was

3:13.9, more than two seconds
slower than last week's 3:11.4.
Still it bettered the old meet rec
ord of 3:15.0.


LLOYI) WINS 880
Stanford strategy worked in the mile and 880, but Occidental plans and come-through performances
were present in almost every other event as the Tigers swamped the Indians, 78' ; -52".i, Saturday at
Patterson Field.
Norman Lloyd and Chuck Cobb each won two first places for the Cards, but Oxy took nine other
events. Stanford also won the relay and shared first place in the high jump.
Lloyd's performance was by far the best from the Stanford point of view. lie opened the meet with

a leisurely 4:17 victory in the
mile, just as was planned.
This left him with plenty of
punch tor the 880 as he went in
against teammate Ernie Cunliffe
and Oxy's Ty Hadley in what was

in 1:49.8, Cunliffe was third in
1:51.2, and Oxy's Dave Reisbord
closed well for a 1:51.4 fourth
place clocking.
Lloyd and Tod White loafed
through a 3:19 for the first three
quarters in the mile as White
failed in his effort to tire Lloyd
for the 880. They kicked most of
the final lap, but. then Lloyd left
White with 110 yards to go. His
final lap was run in 58 seconds.
Cobb Wins Hurdles
Cobb had a tough fight with
Oxy's Clarence Treat in both hur
dle races, but came on strong in
each to win in 14.1 and 23.4.
Cobb beat his own meet mark of
23.5 in the lows and erased his
old standard of 14.4 in the highs.
Elsewhere, Ihe meet was pri
marily a story of best-ever marks
by Tigers and routine or less ef
forts by Stanford. Jon Jamison,
the javelin-high jump expert who
strained his back two days ago
and was declared out of the meet
by Coach Chuck Coker, showed
up —as expected — and lied for
first in the high jump and took
second in the spear throw.
The real javelin surprise was
Dick Mollis, who threw 237-5, his
best mark by more than 25 feet.

Stanford was a victim of final
efforts in the broad jump and
shot - put. Rick Schmidt went
from second to first over A 1 Pe
terson with a final jump of 24
feet, and Jon Visel passed up
Chris Plain on his last throw for
third in the shot.
Plain, on his last effort, had
gone 50-% to take over the show
spot, but then Visel put one out
over 52 feet — four feet better
than his previous best. Jerry
Winters was the only Indian shot
putter to look good as he threw
52-9 for second.
Winters gave Stanford its only
weight points, since Oxy swept
the javelin and discus against me
diocre Indian performances.
Chesarek Second in 440
Oxy continued its mastery over
Don Chesarek in the 440. This
time it was John Zetzman who
came home first, although he ran
only 48.1. Chesarek was far be
hind in 48.9.
Bolh Chesarek and Dick Las
sen started far too slow, leaving
Oxy with three men in command
al the 220. Chesarek finally made
a move, but he was much too late
to win.
Dean Smith gave Rudy Alston
a run for his money in the
sprints, but lost by inches in each
after leading 20 yards from the
tape. Winning times of 9.8 and
21.5 were far from Alston's best.
Stanford's relay victory was a
good one, but anticlimactic. By
the time the relay ran, Oxy had
the meet wrapped up and taken
home. The Tigers, in fact, were
almost sure winners as soon as
the javelin and 440 results were
posted.
Lloyd had the best leg on the
relay—47.s. The team time was

3:13.9, more than two seconds
slower than last week's 3:11.4.
Still it bettered the old meet rec
ord of 3:15.0.


LLOYI) WINS 880
Stanford strategy worked in the mile and 880, but Occidental plans and come-through performances
were present in almost every other event as the Tigers swamped the Indians, 78' ; -52".i, Saturday at
Patterson Field.
Norman Lloyd and Chuck Cobb each won two first places for the Cards, but Oxy took nine other
events. Stanford also won the relay and shared first place in the high jump.
Lloyd's performance was by far the best from the Stanford point of view. lie opened the meet with

a leisurely 4:17 victory in the
mile, just as was planned.
This left him with plenty of
punch tor the 880 as he went in
against teammate Ernie Cunliffe
and Oxy's Ty Hadley in what was
billed as the meet's best race.
Cunliffe led for 6(50 yards, with
fractions ol' 25.0, 54.6 and 1:22.
Lloyd was a yard back most of
the way, with Hadley another
yard behind.
A 1 the 660 polo, all three men
pulled even, and then Lloyd and
Hadley moved ahead. The two
ran neck-and-neck for 140 yards,
then Lloyd left Hadley practically
Standing still. The lanky Indian
pulled out all the stops and hit
the tape in 1:49.2, cracking his
own week-old Stanford record of
1:50.5 and shattering the meet
standard of 1:52.6, set by John
Barnes in 1952.
Lloyd's time also increased his
margin as the nation's leading
half-miler thus far in 1958.
Hadley held on for second place
