# Oakland Edges Frosh Spikers
## 
### 
Stanford's freshmen had the
depth and field-events strength
but Oakland had the running
power as it nipped the Papooses
in a triangular meet Saturday on
Angell Field, 71V*-69 ■•>. West Con-
Ira Costa was third with 21
points. In dual scoring it was
Oakland Stanford Glli.
Brooks Townsend came up with
the day's best showing for the Pa
pooses as he broad-jumped 23-4 Va.
Bob Atkinson also looked good
with a winning shot-put effort of
49-5.
Craig Bushman won the javelin
for the frosh at 171-3, and Stew
Widess and Craig Barrett tied
for first in the high jump.
Jeff Beaubier, back in action
for the first time in several
weeks, could get only third in the
<110 and fourth in the half-mile—
both slow races. Keith Wallace
did not run.
Ron Schneider and Bob Martin
looked sharp in the lows and
highs respectively, each taking
second behind Oakland's Bud
Perry.
