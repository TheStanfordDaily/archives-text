# Hoover Loses Gall Bladder
## 
### 
Former President Herbert Hoo
ver, plagued by recurring gall
bladder attacks, underwent a IM
h o u r operation to remove the
troublesome organ Saturday at
New York's Columbia-Presbyteri
an Medical Center.
Herbert Hoover Jr. announced
to reporters four hours after the
surgery: "There is no emergency
in connection with this operation.
My father had been bothered for
some time, and he and his doctors
decided this would be a good time
to attend to itâ€”a time when he
wasn't suffering from it."
Hoover Sr., nearly 84, was rest
ing quietly at the time of the re
port, and, according to doctors,
his condition was "satisfactory."
Hoover is a member of Stan
ford's Class of 1895, the first class
to graduate here. His original
home, Lou Henry Hoover House,
is the present home of President
and Mrs. Sterling.
On one of his many ocean voy
ages during World War I, it oc
curred to Hoover that nobody was
collecting pamphlets or newspa
per articles published din ing the
war. He began collecting male
rials and at the end of the war
tinned his collection over to Stan
ford. The collection was then call
ed the Hoover War Library. This
year the name of the library was
changed to the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace.
