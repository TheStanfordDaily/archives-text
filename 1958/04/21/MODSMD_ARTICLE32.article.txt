Throe home runs, one of them inside the park, sparked the Stan
lord varsity baseball team to a 12-0 victory over the San Jose State
nine Satui'day afternoon, completing the weekend shutout of the
Spartans alter a 4-0 victory Friday in San Jose.
Left fielder Dick Williams and first baseman Joel Newkirk had
their e\es glued on the same spot as they sent 360-foot drives over
the left field fence in the third and seventh innings respectively.
Second biiseman A 1 Shaw connected for a long drive to center field
in the six-run second inning which gave him time to make tlie com
plete circuit as we!) as drive in another run.
Newkiik's homer was his second of the year. Williams combined
his four-h.t'jtger with two doubles to lead the team in hitting with
three for four at-bais, as well as hitting in four runs and scoring
himself four times.
The si iring started in the bottom of the second inning as right
fielder Hick De Fa bio singled to center field and then came home on
Williams' first double. The next hit was an infield single by winning
pitcher George Avery which brought Williams in.
Then center fielder Harry Rodda connected for one of his two
triples for the day to score Avery and shortstop Bob Dwight. The
final two runs of the inning came on Shaw's in-the-park homer,
bringing in Rodda.
Newkirk singled in the next inning and scored on Williams'
homer to make the score 8-0 going into the fourth. There was no
more scoring until ihc bottom of the seventh when Newkirk homered
and Williams scored on an infield single by third baseman Jim Burk.
In the bottom of the eighth the Indians got their final two runs
when Williams doubled again, bringing home Holding, and then
came in himself on a single to infield by Dwight.
Right-hander George Avery went the whole distance for the Cards
in pitching the five-hit shutout. He struck out seven and gave up
five walks.
In the game Friday left-hander Bob Leopold pitched a 4-0 shutout,
allowing only three hits on the San Jose diamond. The Stanford ace
struck out seven of the first ten batters he faced in compiling 13
strike-outs for the nine innings. Center fielder Ben Robinson led the
team in hitting with three hits in three at-bats. He pulled a muscle
in that game, however, and was sidelined for Saturday's game.

Pacific in another non-league game on the Sunken Diamond at 3:15.
