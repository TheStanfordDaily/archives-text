# Frosh Set New Mark
## 
### 
Stanford's four-man medley re
lay team set a new national col
legiate freshman record with a
time of 3:55.2 13 seconds faster
than the previous mark- as the
local frosh mermen easily dump
ed San Jose State, 54-25, in a dual
meet at the Papoose pool Friday
afternoon.
Coach Tom Haynie's champion
ship medley relay squad was com
posed of George Harrison, back
stroke; Jim Cooper, breast stroke;
John Jurgensen, butterfly; and
Mike Zeller, fi-ee style. The for
mer top time of 4:28.6 was set
last year at Columbia University.
Papooses pulled firsts in every
event except the diving competi
tion, where their entries were
sidelined because of illness. Coop
er had a tight race in the 200-yard
breast stroke, just nosing out
speedy Spartan Bob Lim in 2:32.5.
Free-styler Zeller turned in a fine
51.6 in the 100.
