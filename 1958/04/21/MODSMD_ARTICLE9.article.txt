# Freshman Staff Takes All Credit
## 
### 
Today's Daily, the Annual
Freshman Edition, has the
stamp of the class of '61. Un
doubtedly, the reader will no
tice added clarity and precision
in each interesting inch of copy.
Absorbing sun, sand and
Schlitz at San Gregorio, the up
perclass staffers played no part
in the publishing of Number 40,
Volume 133.
We take full responsibility
for all merit and, although un
likely, all mistakes in these
four pages.
The Freshman Staff
