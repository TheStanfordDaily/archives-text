A United Air Lines four-engine

explosion 21,000 feet in the air.
The two men aboard the jet rode
it to their deaths.
A number of businessmen and
key defense industry figures were

Washington and New York.
The Air Force said its plane
went aloft on an instrument train
ing flight, during which a blind
folded student pilot operates the
ship in response to radio signals
beamed from the ground. An in
structor in a forward uncovered
cockpit was also in the dual-con
trol fighter-bomber.
Just before the collision the jet
was given instructions to let flown
