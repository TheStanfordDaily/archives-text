# An American Gestapo?
## 
### 
Dors the United Slates have its own brand of
Gestapo?
William Heikkila of San Francisco was
seized by immigration authorities when he
returned home from work Friday afternoon.
According to an Associated Press dispatch, "he
has not been seen since by his family, and U.S.
immigration authorities here said he had been
deported to Finland because he was a Com
munist in Minnesota during the depression."
Heikkila was born in Finland of American
parents and came to this country at the age of
two and one-half months. His parents had been
ou a business trip. Apparently, says the news
dispatch, Heikkila had never been naturalized.
He is presently 52 years old.
His attorney obtained an order from a fed
eral judge restraining immigration authorities
from deporting him. '"But the order is worth
less if he has already been deported."
Mrs. Heikkila was called at her home Satur
day and told she could pack a 40-pound bag
for her husband. She said he has no money
and she has been tr\ing to find a way to get
$50 to him.
Immigration authorities have refused to re
veal his whereabouts, indicating only that
Heikkila is "not with us." It is conjectured
that he was flown across I he border into Canada
and flown to Finland from there.
Fvents in this case have proceeded altogether
100 rapidly. If. because he was born in Finland
though of American parentage, Heikkila is not
a citizen, then immigration authorities have
llie legal authority to deport him. lint do they
have lli<> moral riuht to do so?

The whole manner in which the incident was
conducted— arrest, ineommunication and de
portation. all within a few hours—goes against
our sense of what is fair. Heikkila was a Com
munist during the depression. So what? So
were many others.
Does being a Communist during the depres
sion years automatically make one a criminal,
a detestable being, a potential saboteur or spy?
Is the United States still so dominated by Mc-
Carthyism that its sense of justice has become
a thing of perversion induced by mass fears
upon which McCarthv plaved so eloquently?
What has happened to the Land of the Free?
Where could all this lead? if ever the public
should protest against an action by a govern
mental agency, this is it.
According to our laws Heikkila is an alien.
His parents were Americans, but because he
was born outside of U.S. territory while his
parents were on a business trip, he is thus an
alien.
His being an alien did not bother the immi
gration authorities before. Indeed, when he
was a Communist in the early 30's there were
110 thoughts of deportation. Why now?
We do not know all the facts behind this
case. \\ e only know what the Immigration
Service has seen fit to tell the press. It may be
that there are circumstances warranting such
procedure and especially deportation. But if
that be the case, then the public should cer
tainly be told.
It is in this respect that the Government
apppears to be using Gestapo methods. This,
we as Americans cannot allow. This is what
we must protest against.
