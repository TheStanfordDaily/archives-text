Iron+clftf] Housing System
Editor, The Daily:
I) has been continually maintained that one of
Stanford's main strengths as an educational in
stitution is that it has a "residential campus."
This belief seems to be one of the major factors
contributing to the University's ultimately the
Board of Trustees'- refOsal to give women the
opportunity to choose whether or not they shall
live in a residence provided by the University.
A small number of undergraduate women stu
dents. a distinct minority, is discontent with com
pulsory on-campus living. At present these indi
viduals are forced to live in campus housing
under a TOTALLY inflexible, ironclad system.
We question the wisdom of a policy requiring all
undergraduate women who have not attained the
age of 23 to live in a University dormitory. Out
standing cases of this inflexibility, though CER
TAINLY not the only ones, are those concerning
law and medical students, required to live in Uni
versity undergraduate housing simply because
they have not yet been graduated and are not yet
23, even though their present interests and activi
ties diverge considerably from those of the ma
jority of undergraduates living in these dormi
tories.
The education that group living offers to an

individual is perhaps desirable in making the
transition from high school to college in the first
one or two years of the college experience. Bui
the compulsory continuation of this experience
for the duration of the entire undergraduate
career does not take into consideration the fact
that the individuals living under such a system
are not static; that, regardless of the positive
good this policy achieves in this first transition,
women should be free to choose whether con
tinued dormitory living fits in with the next and
more important transition—that transition away
from college, which is neglected under the pres
ent policy.
Women students do not have identical interests
and needs; dormitories are not sufficiently varied
to satisfy those of everyone. There can be no
doubt that the University in its policies is sin
cerely attempting to further the over-all develop
ment of its students. We believe, however, that
its present policy is not conducive to this aim.
We have no delusions about the inconveniences
and other possible disadvantages of off-campus
living; nonetheless we feel that at least some
undergraduate women would benefit by a change
to a more flexible housing policy.

living; nonetheless we feel that at least some
undergraduate women would benefit by a change
to a more flexible housing policy.

I) has been continually maintained that one of
Stanford's main strengths as an educational in
stitution is that it has a "residential campus."
This belief seems to be one of the major factors
contributing to the University's ultimately the
Board of Trustees'- refOsal to give women the
opportunity to choose whether or not they shall
live in a residence provided by the University.
A small number of undergraduate women stu
dents. a distinct minority, is discontent with com
pulsory on-campus living. At present these indi
viduals are forced to live in campus housing
under a TOTALLY inflexible, ironclad system.
We question the wisdom of a policy requiring all
undergraduate women who have not attained the
age of 23 to live in a University dormitory. Out
standing cases of this inflexibility, though CER
TAINLY not the only ones, are those concerning
law and medical students, required to live in Uni
versity undergraduate housing simply because
they have not yet been graduated and are not yet
23, even though their present interests and activi
ties diverge considerably from those of the ma
jority of undergraduates living in these dormi
tories.
The education that group living offers to an

individual is perhaps desirable in making the
transition from high school to college in the first
one or two years of the college experience. Bui
the compulsory continuation of this experience
for the duration of the entire undergraduate
career does not take into consideration the fact
that the individuals living under such a system
are not static; that, regardless of the positive
good this policy achieves in this first transition,
women should be free to choose whether con
tinued dormitory living fits in with the next and
more important transition—that transition away
from college, which is neglected under the pres
ent policy.
Women students do not have identical interests
and needs; dormitories are not sufficiently varied
to satisfy those of everyone. There can be no
doubt that the University in its policies is sin
cerely attempting to further the over-all develop
ment of its students. We believe, however, that
