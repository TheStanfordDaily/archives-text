Surprise and Satisfaction
Editor, The Daily:
I want to express my surprise and the deep satisfaction I expe
rienced when I witnessed the demonstration for world-sanity given
in front of the Main Library by a sizeable group of Stanford stu
dents.
Too often we have heard statements to the effect that American
young people are really wet behind the ears, and only interested in
pep rallies, Big Game festivities, sex, and grades; whereas European 1
youth is mature, as measured by its active interest and participation
in crucial political issues.
Stanford students have just proven that it is not necessarily so.
Let's hope that their demonstration will start similar ones on other
campuses in this country, and that the views of the leaders of to
morrow will be taken into account by the leaders of today.

Editor, The Daily:
This is in reply to a letter addressed to you entitled "Childish
Bomb Fears" in The Stanford Daily dated Tuesday, April 15. 1958. \
It is indeed presumptuous of the writer to think of himself as a
rational man, and eminent scholars of America and the world as
childish. There is no doubt about the fact that A-bombs are danger
ous and harmful, and continuance of tests for the preservation of
democracy is the most narrow view of the situation.
Democracy is certainly to be safeguarded, but not through "per-1
fection" of the A-bomb, if there can be such a thing. For all we know,
there might, be no soul left to preserve democracy. It is not a matter
of a "few lives here and there," as the writer has suggested, but the
disaster of mutation of humanity.
As it is, the free world runs a risk, and continuance of tests or ;
perfection of greater bombs will not lessen the risk in any way. On
the other hand, the very foundations of democracy are at stake due
to the propaganda advantage gained and the favorable atmosphere
created by Russia.
Obviously, the purpose of tests is to improve weapons of destruc
tion. It must be admitted that the existing weapons are enough to
annihilate life from the surface of the earth. Further tests will not
help in any way. The only result would be the dangerous poisoning
of the atmosphere and the spread of disease and sorrow.
I appreciate the initiative of The Daily in enlightening the stu
dents on the need for stopping. A-bomb tests. Further, I hope the
"rational" people will seek to ascertain the .strength of the founda
tions of their "rationality" (if there are any).

An Upsurge of Faith
Editor, The Daily:
The implications of the recent student demonstration in protest
of continued nuclear bomb testing transcend the importance of the
issue itself. Those Stanford students who demonstrated have as
serted their right, privilege and democratic obligation to confirm
that students most certainly have the freedom of assembly and the
freedom of speech that cannot and will not be denied them. Only
when rights and freedoms are asserted are those rights and free
doms alive.
The recent expression of student opinion has offered a real up
surge of faith to those who, in the past, were concerned about the
apathy of Stanford students. The participants of the demonstration
have accomplished several important student victories. Not only
have they reaffirmed student freedom of expression and denied that
the Stanford student is an apathetic victim of the status quo, but
they have also awakened their peer$. to the very real and serious
problem that confronts every American today.
They have in fact made themselves part of the democratic process
by demanding that they have a voice in the affairs and policy of
our nation.

I want to express my surprise and the deep satisfaction I expe
rienced when I witnessed the demonstration for world-sanity given
in front of the Main Library by a sizeable group of Stanford stu
dents.
Too often we have heard statements to the effect that American
young people are really wet behind the ears, and only interested in
pep rallies, Big Game festivities, sex, and grades; whereas European 1
youth is mature, as measured by its active interest and participation
in crucial political issues.
Stanford students have just proven that it is not necessarily so.
Let's hope that their demonstration will start similar ones on other
campuses in this country, and that the views of the leaders of to
morrow will be taken into account by the leaders of today.

This is in reply to a letter addressed to you entitled "Childish
Bomb Fears" in The Stanford Daily dated Tuesday, April 15. 1958. \
It is indeed presumptuous of the writer to think of himself as a
rational man, and eminent scholars of America and the world as
childish. There is no doubt about the fact that A-bombs are danger
ous and harmful, and continuance of tests for the preservation of
democracy is the most narrow view of the situation.
Democracy is certainly to be safeguarded, but not through "per-1
fection" of the A-bomb, if there can be such a thing. For all we know,
there might, be no soul left to preserve democracy. It is not a matter
of a "few lives here and there," as the writer has suggested, but the
disaster of mutation of humanity.
As it is, the free world runs a risk, and continuance of tests or ;
perfection of greater bombs will not lessen the risk in any way. On
the other hand, the very foundations of democracy are at stake due
to the propaganda advantage gained and the favorable atmosphere
created by Russia.
Obviously, the purpose of tests is to improve weapons of destruc
tion. It must be admitted that the existing weapons are enough to
annihilate life from the surface of the earth. Further tests will not
help in any way. The only result would be the dangerous poisoning
of the atmosphere and the spread of disease and sorrow.
I appreciate the initiative of The Daily in enlightening the stu
dents on the need for stopping. A-bomb tests. Further, I hope the
"rational" people will seek to ascertain the .strength of the founda
tions of their "rationality" (if there are any).

Editor, The Daily:
The implications of the recent student demonstration in protest
of continued nuclear bomb testing transcend the importance of the
issue itself. Those Stanford students who demonstrated have as
serted their right, privilege and democratic obligation to confirm
that students most certainly have the freedom of assembly and the
freedom of speech that cannot and will not be denied them. Only
when rights and freedoms are asserted are those rights and free
doms alive.
The recent expression of student opinion has offered a real up
surge of faith to those who, in the past, were concerned about the
apathy of Stanford students. The participants of the demonstration
have accomplished several important student victories. Not only
have they reaffirmed student freedom of expression and denied that
the Stanford student is an apathetic victim of the status quo, but
they have also awakened their peer$. to the very real and serious
problem that confronts every American today.
They have in fact made themselves part of the democratic process
by demanding that they have a voice in the affairs and policy of
our nation.
