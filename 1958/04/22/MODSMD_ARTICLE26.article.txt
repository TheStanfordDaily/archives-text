# THE 						Finish Line

Weather or Worry?
There's been hotter weather for a track meet than last Saturday's
— hut not much. Throw in a little eye and throat irritation and it
adds up to a pretty good excuse for Stanford and its lackluster
showing against Occidental.
The only trouble is that by some meteorological phenomenon, the
weather was just as hot and smoggy in the Oxy lanes as in the
Stanford lanes.
And under these conditions, the Tigers still came through with a
series of best-ever performances in the field events and a string of
times which were good enough to kill off Stanford's expected
strength in several running events.
Not even all the Indians were adversely affected by the weather.
Chuck Cobb, the old pro of the club, and Norm Lloyd, Stanford's
mature middle- and long-distance star, didn't fade. What seems to
have happened is that too many men were affected not by the con
ditions themselves, but by the worrying they did about those con
ditions.
There seem to be a few areas on the Stannford team which are
vulnerable to pressure the type of pressure which comes when in
dications are that the Indians must have a certain number of points
in that particular event if they are to win the meet.
Unfortunately, Stanford isn't deep in many events, and so it's
difficult for Coach Payton Jordan to shuffle his talent in such a way
that pressure can be relieved in some of ihese spots.
Switclies-Bnl Not to Ease Pressure
Jordan does have a few switches in mind for Saturday's meet with
UCLA. Tint rather than having the aim of easing any pressure, these
moves will be for the simple purpose of trying to get more points
from a Bruin team which on paper figures to win by 10-20 points.
Lloyd will run both Ihe mile and two-mile, and Ernie Cunliife will
go in the mile and half. Stanford will have to get at least 24 points
in these three events, and outlook for this happening is good.
Of course that still leaves 42 other points that the Indians will
have to find if they want to win. Cobb should be able to get 10 of
these in the hurdles and Dean Smith should pick up between six and
10 in the sprints.
From there on, anything Stanford gets will come with a hard
struggle. Blankings appear imminent in the javelin and discus, and
Jerry Winters will have to improve about two feet in the shot-put
1o get even a second.
Winters, however, has improved every week and looks to be the
most likely of the weight men to come through with a top effort.
Stanford probably won't get more than one point in either the
high jump or 440, and three is the maximum in the pole vault. That
leaves the broad jump, place and show points in the sprints and the
relay as the events that will decide the meet.
Stanford would normally be the choice in the relay, but with
Lloyd running the two-mile, Jordan will have to find a fourth man
for his quartet.
Right now, John Kelly appears to be the most, likely candidate,
although Ben Anixter is also a possibility. Kelly ran on the frosh
miel relay team in 1957 that established a new Stanford yearling
record.
THE COMING ATTRACTION — This week's UCLA meet will
again be an easy one for fans to follow. Record boards with each
competitor's best mark of the day and the round of competition will
be used in ihe field events, along wilh radio communication between
the field and p.a. announcer.
Each man will be introduced before his event, and the Stanford
band will be on hand to entertain between races. Ed McCauley of
NBC San Francisco will again handle the p.a.

weather was just as hot and smoggy in the Oxy lanes as in the
Stanford lanes.
And under these conditions, the Tigers still came through with a
series of best-ever performances in the field events and a string of
times which were good enough to kill off Stanford's expected
strength in several running events.
Not even all the Indians were adversely affected by the weather.
Chuck Cobb, the old pro of the club, and Norm Lloyd, Stanford's
mature middle- and long-distance star, didn't fade. What seems to
have happened is that too many men were affected not by the con
ditions themselves, but by the worrying they did about those con
ditions.
There seem to be a few areas on the Stannford team which are
vulnerable to pressure the type of pressure which comes when in
dications are that the Indians must have a certain number of points
in that particular event if they are to win the meet.
Unfortunately, Stanford isn't deep in many events, and so it's
difficult for Coach Payton Jordan to shuffle his talent in such a way
that pressure can be relieved in some of ihese spots.
Switclies-Bnl Not to Ease Pressure
Jordan does have a few switches in mind for Saturday's meet with
UCLA. Tint rather than having the aim of easing any pressure, these
moves will be for the simple purpose of trying to get more points
from a Bruin team which on paper figures to win by 10-20 points.
Lloyd will run both Ihe mile and two-mile, and Ernie Cunliife will
go in the mile and half. Stanford will have to get at least 24 points
in these three events, and outlook for this happening is good.
Of course that still leaves 42 other points that the Indians will
have to find if they want to win. Cobb should be able to get 10 of
these in the hurdles and Dean Smith should pick up between six and
10 in the sprints.
From there on, anything Stanford gets will come with a hard
struggle. Blankings appear imminent in the javelin and discus, and
Jerry Winters will have to improve about two feet in the shot-put
1o get even a second.
Winters, however, has improved every week and looks to be the
most likely of the weight men to come through with a top effort.
Stanford probably won't get more than one point in either the
high jump or 440, and three is the maximum in the pole vault. That
leaves the broad jump, place and show points in the sprints and the
relay as the events that will decide the meet.
Stanford would normally be the choice in the relay, but with
Lloyd running the two-mile, Jordan will have to find a fourth man
for his quartet.
Right now, John Kelly appears to be the most, likely candidate,
although Ben Anixter is also a possibility. Kelly ran on the frosh
miel relay team in 1957 that established a new Stanford yearling
record.
THE COMING ATTRACTION — This week's UCLA meet will
again be an easy one for fans to follow. Record boards with each
competitor's best mark of the day and the round of competition will
be used in ihe field events, along wilh radio communication between
the field and p.a. announcer.
Each man will be introduced before his event, and the Stanford
band will be on hand to entertain between races. Ed McCauley of
NBC San Francisco will again handle the p.a.

Weather or Worry?
There's been hotter weather for a track meet than last Saturday's
— hut not much. Throw in a little eye and throat irritation and it
adds up to a pretty good excuse for Stanford and its lackluster
showing against Occidental.

weather was just as hot and smoggy in the Oxy lanes as in the
