# COP Meets Card Nine Here Today
## 
### 
Stanford looks for its loth vic
tory of the season and Dick Wil
liams aims for his fifth today at
3:15 p.m. when the Indians and
College of the Pacific tangle on
the Sunken Diamond.
The Tigers figure to give
Dutch Fehring's Tribe a strong
battle — if early - season victories
over California and San Jose can
be taken as any sort of indication.
The San Jose game was par
ticularly indicative of the COP
striking power. They trailed 9-0,
then rallied for a 12-11 victory.
Against Santa Clara, only an
llth-hour grand-slam homer kept
the Tigers from winning.
Lost Last Year
COP will have revenge in mind
today — Stanford whipped them
7-2 here last spring. The big man
in the Tiger line-up is Dick Bass,
the hard hitting outfielder who's
even better known for his foot
ball exploits.
Fehring plans to let Williams
work the first six innings, then
make way for Bob Leopold. This
is expected to give them enough
work to be ready for Saturday's
important double -e header with
UCLA.
Williams, though boasting a
4-1 record, has been roughed up
lately and his ERA has soared to
4.15. .He's struck out 20 and
walked 13 so far this season.
Leopold: 5-2
Leopold could get either his
sixth win or third loss if Williams
doesn't figure in the decision.
Although his percentage is slight
ly lower, Leopold has much the
better of things in Ihe ERA de
partment. His nine scoreless in
nings against San Jose Friday
lowered his ERA to an excellent
1.74. He's walked 19 and fanned
32.
