### Steve Baffrey 
In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
. . . football. At least that's where the fancies of some 90 Stanford
varsity football candidates turned yesterday for the first of 20 spring
grid workouts to be held in the next 30 days.
The roster read from Alexander to Wylie, and included already

familiar names such as Barbee,
Burford, Protiva, Peterson, Gar
ber and Nicolet.
Other spring sports will keep
Indians Ben Robinson, Chris
Plain, Jerry Winters, Bob 1 lei
gold. Bob Atkinson and John Bes
sey from getting into Coach Jack
Curtice's workouts.
But for those who did turn out
it was a warm afternoon in full
armor, and Curtice and his staff
lost no time in getting into the
spirit of the game. The new Card
coach broke his squad in with
fundamentals drills which includ
ed running and blocking, and fin
ished 1 ho day by getting into the
new Curtice style of play.
"Speed," Curtice told the squad,

"is what we will emphasize." And
he meant just that. After a short
talk to the squad he divided his
men into six groups and sent
them off to work with his assist
ants.
Curtice himself spent most of
the afternoon with the prospec
tive quarterbacks and centers.
Now assistants Andy Everest and
Homer Smith took charge of
guards and right halfs. Coach
Herm Meister put the tackles
through their paces; Pete Kmeto
vie worked with loft halfs, and
Bob Ghilotti worked with the
ends. Also out to help the as
sistants was 1957 flanker half
Jack Taylor.
