THE POSTMAN COMETH
I have recently received several letters from readers which
have been so interesting, so piquant, so jc ne sais quoi, that I
feci I must share them with all of you. The letters and my
replies follow:
SIR:
Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years
ago. On my very first day I got into a bridge game in the
student union. lam still in the same bridge gairre. I have never
gone to class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do
is play bridge.
To explain my long absence and keep the money coming
from home, I told a harmless little lie. I said I was in ntedical
school. This made Dad (my father) terribly proud. It also
enabled me to keep playing bridge. We were both very happy.
But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended when
I came home for Christmas vacation. 1 arrived to find that
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen.
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by
a hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.

"Oh, never mind," chuckled Dad (my father). "Harlow (me)
will fix Sister (my sister)."
Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school
which would be a dirty shame just when I am beginning to
understand the weak club bid.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. I got Sister
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself completely
at a, loss as to how to put her back together again. Can yon
suggest anything? They're getting pretty surly around here.
Sincerely,
Harlow Protein
Dear Harlow:
Indeed I do have the solution for you—the
solution that has never failed me when things
close in: Light up a Marlboro! Knots untie as
you puff that fine rich tobacco. Shade bccomcs
light as that grand flavor comes freely and friend
liiy through that splendid filter. Who can stay
glum when Marlboro gives you such a lot to like?
Not I. Not you. Not nobody.
SIR:
Just off the campus where I go to school there is a lake
called Lake Widgiwagan. Thirty years ago when my father was
an undergraduate here he went fishing oite day in Lake Widgi
wagan and dropped his Deke pin in the water, lie dived for
days but never found it.
.Tust yesterday—thirty years later, mark you!—l went fish
ing in Widgiwagan. I caught a four-pound bass. I took the
fish home, cut it open, and wh;it do you think I found inside?
You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dentpsey-Firpo fight.

THE POSTMAN COMETH
I have recently received several letters from readers which
have been so interesting, so piquant, so jc ne sais quoi, that I
feci I must share them with all of you. The letters and my
replies follow:
SIR:
Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years
ago. On my very first day I got into a bridge game in the
student union. lam still in the same bridge gairre. I have never
gone to class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do
is play bridge.
To explain my long absence and keep the money coming
from home, I told a harmless little lie. I said I was in ntedical
school. This made Dad (my father) terribly proud. It also
enabled me to keep playing bridge. We were both very happy.
But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended when
I came home for Christmas vacation. 1 arrived to find that
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen.
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by
a hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.

"Oh, never mind," chuckled Dad (my father). "Harlow (me)
will fix Sister (my sister)."
Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school
which would be a dirty shame just when I am beginning to
understand the weak club bid.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. I got Sister
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself completely
at a, loss as to how to put her back together again. Can yon
suggest anything? They're getting pretty surly around here.
Sincerely,
Harlow Protein
Dear Harlow:
Indeed I do have the solution for you—the
solution that has never failed me when things
close in: Light up a Marlboro! Knots untie as
you puff that fine rich tobacco. Shade bccomcs
light as that grand flavor comes freely and friend
liiy through that splendid filter. Who can stay
glum when Marlboro gives you such a lot to like?
Not I. Not you. Not nobody.
SIR:
Just off the campus where I go to school there is a lake
called Lake Widgiwagan. Thirty years ago when my father was
an undergraduate here he went fishing oite day in Lake Widgi
wagan and dropped his Deke pin in the water, lie dived for
days but never found it.
.Tust yesterday—thirty years later, mark you!—l went fish
ing in Widgiwagan. I caught a four-pound bass. I took the
fish home, cut it open, and wh;it do you think I found inside?
You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dentpsey-Firpo fight.
Sinccrcly,
Willis Wayde
