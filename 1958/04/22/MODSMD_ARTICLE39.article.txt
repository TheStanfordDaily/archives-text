# Fraternity Burglaries Remain Unsolved; Clues Prove Sterile
## 
### 
No leads on the April 6 bur
glary of the Delta Chi and Alpha
Tau Omega houses have been re
ported by the Santa Clara County
sheriff's office.
According to Sgt. Mollison, who
is handling the case for the sher
iff's office, two clues turned in by
men of the two fraternities have
led to no information of value to
the investigation.
An unknown burglar or bur
glars entered the Delta Chi and
ATO houses early Easter Sunday
morning and stole approximately
$1600 in cash and merchandise.
Seven typewriters, four watches
and $115 were taken in the largest
burglary on campus in several
years.
Members of the ATO house re
ported that a person suspiciously
entered their house a few hours
before the burglary. They took
down the license number of his
car and later reported it to the
sheriff's office. According to Sgt.
Mollison, this person was investi
gated and cleared.
Fingerprints were taken from
the Delta Chi television set, which
the burglar reportedly attempted
to move. According to Mollison,
all of these were only partial

prints and no identifcation of
them was made by the state Cen
tral Intelligence and Identification
office in Sacramento.
