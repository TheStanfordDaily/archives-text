Security Council, where a Soviet
resolution condemning the United
States for such flights faced cer
tain defeat.
Sobolev said he was withdraw
ing his resolution because U.S.
ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,
council president, had steamroll
ered the council toward a vote.

fact was that the Soviet Union
did not have enough votes to push
its proposal through."

the United States.
During the debate Lodge vigor
