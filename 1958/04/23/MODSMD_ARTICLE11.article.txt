# Women Desire Off-Campus Or Dorm Residence Option
## 
### Rita Robison 
The issue of whether or not un
dergraduate women should be al
lowed to live off-campus is pri
marily one of principle: il may he
presumed that many of the wom
en attending colleges and univer
sities are quite capable of assum
ing the responsibilities and obli
gations of living without the su
pervision of "parents away from
home."
Stanford has traditionally at
tracted exceptionally intelligent
and capable individuals who, af
ter living in a University atmos
phere for two years or so. mature
and take more initiative in their
personal lives.
Some find they wish to involve
themselves more fully with cam
pus organizations and govern
ment; others devote their time
and energy preparing themselves
1 for graduate school or more im-
I mediate entries into the profes
j sions of I heir choice.

Many men move off campus,
wishing to have privacy and more
lime of their own for study, read
ing and working. Many students
marry. Others take advantage of
opportunities to travel and study
abroad. They are not hampered
by the University in these aims.
Upper-division women wishing
to live off campus, however, have
met with a short and concise "It
is not the University's policy."
With an eye to the view that
policies do change, occasionally,
a group of women from all
classes have recently co-ordinated
their efforts in hopes of reaching
a better understanding of the rel
ative merits of the present Uni
versity policy for women living
off campus. They propose that if
she wishes a woman should, with
written parental permission, be
able 1o live off campus. In brief.
, they believe thai there should be
freedom of choice.
| There are certain advantages to

dormitory living, certainly, such
as educating a person to group
living without the external incon
veniences of cooking and clean
ing, and offering the opportunity
to meet many kinds of people and
talk freely with them.
But not all women have the
same needs, and for those women
who have individual needs, for
example, law and medical stu
dents, art and drama majors, dor
mitory living offers considerable
shortcomings. Most women think
the advantages of dormitory liv
ing outweigh the shortcomingsâ€”
but for those who don't, there is
no alternative. They have no
choice.
Women who have been inter
ested in this problem and dis
cussed the possible alternatives
i have suggested that the Univer
! sity could economically set up a |
. flexible housing system for its I
women students whereby upper
division women could choose
their residence on or off campus,
in or out of University dorms.
Vacancies left by these wom
en could be filled by graduates
who wish to live in dormitories,
or such non-paying dorms as row
houses, etc., could be dispensed
with.
A common objection has been
in respect to morality, which, af
ter all, is solely an invidual con
cern, liable only to each woman's
discretion.
Several interested women
wrote to President Sterling con
cerning their proposals for wom
en living off-campus, requesting
an appointment. They were re
ferred to the President's Commit
tee. Beea us e the committee
meets in closed sessions, none of
the group will be able personally
to present her views. However,
the group is sending a brief to the
committee, which has off-campus
living for undergraduate women
on its agenda for this Friday.
The group plans a meeting to
morrow at 4 p.m. at the Women's
Clubhouse for those interested at
least in the principle of choice in
this matter if they are not per
sonally interested in off-campus
housing for themselves. Perhaps
the proposal should be submitted
to a vote by the women students
of the University.
Ultimately, this proposal or
any alternative to it must be sub
mitted to the Board of Trustees,
who decide on all policies for
Stanford.
