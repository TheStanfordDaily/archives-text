# Women Desire Off-Campus Or Dorm Residence Option
## 
### Rita Robison 
The issue of whether or not un
dergraduate women should be al
lowed to live off-campus is pri
marily one of principle: il may he
presumed that many of the wom
en attending colleges and univer
sities are quite capable of assum
ing the responsibilities and obli
gations of living without the su
pervision of "parents away from
home."
Stanford has traditionally at
tracted exceptionally intelligent
and capable individuals who, af
ter living in a University atmos
phere for two years or so. mature
and take more initiative in their
personal lives.
Some find they wish to involve
themselves more fully with cam

and energy preparing themselves

Many men move off campus,
wishing to have privacy and more
lime of their own for study, read

marry. Others take advantage of
opportunities to travel and study
abroad. They are not hampered
by the University in these aims.
Upper-division women wishing
to live off campus, however, have
met with a short and concise "It
is not the University's policy."
With an eye to the view that
policies do change, occasionally,
a group of women from all
classes have recently co-ordinated
their efforts in hopes of reaching
a better understanding of the rel

versity policy for women living
off campus. They propose that if
she wishes a woman should, with
written parental permission, be
able 1o live off campus. In brief.
, they believe thai there should be
freedom of choice.

dormitory living, certainly, such
as educating a person to group
living without the external incon
veniences of cooking and clean
ing, and offering the opportunity
to meet many kinds of people and
talk freely with them.
But not all women have the
same needs, and for those women
who have individual needs, for
example, law and medical stu
dents, art and drama majors, dor
mitory living offers considerable
shortcomings. Most women think
the advantages of dormitory liv
ing outweigh the shortcomings—
but for those who don't, there is
no alternative. They have no
choice.
Women who have been inter
ested in this problem and dis
cussed the possible alternatives
i have suggested that the Univer
