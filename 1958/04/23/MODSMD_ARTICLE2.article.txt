10,000 men in June, a decrease of
3000 from the quota previously
planned.

fewer inductees will be needed in

the number of new men volun
teering for military duty. Wil

tary of Defense, attributed the
rise in voluntary enlistments in
part to the anticipated approval
of legislation to raise the pay of
career-minded soldiers.
