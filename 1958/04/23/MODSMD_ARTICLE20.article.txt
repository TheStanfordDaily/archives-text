A Delicate and Crucial Decision
Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to he associated with the demon
stration urging cessation of nuclear bomb tests,
which I felt was a responsible and serious-minded
expression of concern. A letter in yesterday's
Daily was signed by several faculty members
who were also associated with the students, I
was invited to sign that letter, but I did not feel
that I could. I would like to state my own view
point for whatever it may be worth.
Let me emphasize that I am no pacifist. T have,
however, become convinced that some way to
stop the bomb tests must be found. The issue is
an extremely elusive one. Neither side is all right
or all wrong. The opponents of testing have
sometimes urged the moral question to the ex
clusion of all else, with the apparent intent of
keeping their own skirts clean, regardless of the
consequences. The proponents of testing have
seemed sometimes to have the sole purpose o'f
maintaining the American way of life—which,
glorious as it may be, is not the Kingdom of God*
Insistence on pure morality at the expense of
realistic politics might lead to political injustice,
which is immoral. To argue that political ex
pediency must override moral considerations is
no better. The decision is so difficult both be
cause it is very delicate and because it is so cru
cial and necessary.
Certainly we must recognize the political prob
lem. We are involved in an international power
struggle, whether we want to be or not. Given
the present situation and the most likely forecast
of the future one, the balance of power must be
maintained, and nuclear weapons play a large
role in the balance of power. Therefore we must
not bo naive about political realities. That the
United Nations could enforce an international
agreement on cessation of tests is not certain.
We must likewise recognize the moral problem.
It does not bother Dr. Teller to say that a million
people will die of leukemia before they would
otherwise have died. It bothers me. To treat
human beings as statistics is to make them into
mere objects. Whether or not two of those mil
lion are my children is less important than Ihe
fact that those million are PEOPLE. I am not
prepared to make that kind of decision for them.
Furthermore, the Atomic Energy Commission
tells rne that bomb tests add a negligible amount
of radiation to the. atmosphere. Dr. Pauling and
others speak of a serious present danger. Whom
shall I believe? I cannot possibly arrive at a
conclusion experimentally. But I have the feel
ing that we would do best to be cautious, lest in
seeking power we forget the human beings for
whom we are responsible.
At least we must he aware of the issues and of
ihe necessity of deciding about Ihem very soon.
The effort toward responsible awareness seemed
to me the particular excellence of the Stanford
demonstration. Would that I could offer a clear
cut solution.

In Favor of Nuclear Tests
Editor, The Daily:
It appears that the time has come for those
who favor continuing nuclear tests to set forth
the arguments on the other side of the question.
Evidence indicates that the United States has
not yet tested a missile with a nuclear warhead.
Russia has. We know that missiles will be the
weapons of the future. If we stop testing now,
when Russian missiles have nuclear warheads
and ours don't, we secure forever the Russian
lead in this area. We endanger the safety of the
United States, because Russia will be able to
attack with long-range missiles and we will be
unable to retaliate.
Additional testing is necessary to develop a
"clean" bomb, one with little or no radioactivity.
Without a clean bomb we will, in event of war,
needlessly kill many civilians—and possibly kill
our own soldiers. We, the undersigned, cannot
understand how many persons can be so con
cerned about the possible deaths resulting from
nuclear tests and yet feel no moral pang at the
thought that by stopping the tests you force the
United States, should war come, to use "dirty"
bombs and needlessly kill millions.
Finally, clean bombs could be used to better
the living standards of the world through such
activities as blasting roadways and canals, clear
ing waterways, mining, etc. Because of the
"dirty" radioactivity of the present bomb, it can
not be used for such purposes.
With regard to the arguments for halting
nuclear tests, certain things should be remem
bered. All will recognize that some biological and
genetic danger results from tests, but this must
be viewed in proper proportion. It is yet to be
demonstrated that a single individual outside of
the official lest areas has been in any way in
jured by radiation from the tests. The increase
in the radiation level due to all nuclear tests is
less than the radiation resulting from chest or
dental X-rays. Dr. Teller estimated it as less than
Ihe increase in radiation that results from living
in a brick house instead of a wooden house. This
is hardly cause for a "write your congressman"
campaign.
What about the arms race? By halting nuclear
tests you do not necessarily hinder the arms race.
You may simply divert emphasis from nuclear
weapons to conventional weapons—a change in
emphasis which is entirely to Russia's advantage.
You may, in fact, force the nations of the world,
for the first time, to give serious consideration
to germ warfare.
It appears to us, then, that in discontinuing
nuclear tests without a general disarmament the
United States is trading a permanent and serious
military liability for a temporary propaganda
advantage. 'If propaganda advantages were last
ing, the impact of Korea and Hungary would
have convinced Asia of Russia's intentions, and
all of Russia's propaganda on nuclear tests would
be of no avail.)

Only Way for Peaceful World
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned foreign students of Stanford University, feel
a strong sympathy with our fellow students who have, this day,
demonstrated against further nuclear tests.
We ourselves would urge the governments of all nations of the
world to stop the manufacture and testing of atomic and hydrogen
bombs.
We believe that .only in this way can we, the younger generation,
and the whole of mankind ex peel to live in a peaceful world.
