# Stanford Summer House Converted to Con Home
## 
### 
Only 43 years — and a house
built for entertaining famous per
sonalities was transformed into a
home housing numerous ill chil
dren. This was the transforma
tion of the elegant "summer resi
dence" of Senator and Mrs. Lo
land Stanford into the Stanford
Convalescent Home.
The Stanfords purchased their
home in 1 STG a three-story frame
building, simply decorated in
French provincial.
A visitor touring the old Stan
ford home entered through the
main hall of the original cottage
(two wings were added >. observed
two small parlors furnished ele
gantly with gold anr] rose, the
predominant colors, and then en
tered the library, containing
woodwork of sup e r b Spanish
cedar.
Gazing out the window, the vis
itor could see the beautiful
grounds, all with a natural park
like effect. The Chinese head gar
dener developed in box-hedge ihe
forms of several animals. The
lawns and winding roads were
swept daily — "almost dusted,"
commented one of the Stanfords'
frequent visitor-s.
Senator Stanford lived in this
home until his death in 1893. Mrs.
Stanford continued residence un
til her death in 1905. The follow
ing year most of the old residence
toppled in the famous San Fran
cisco earthquake.

| It was partially rebuilt and oc-
I cupied until 1919. Two years be
fore this, Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
then University chaplain, had ini
tiated a summer program on the
campus for convalescing children.
In 1919 Timothy Hopkins, a
member of the Board of Trustees,
suggested to the board that they
give 27 acres of land and the
house to the "Campus Auxiliary
to Stanford Clinics," as the Con
Home was called. The hoard.gave
the land and the old residence on
a $1-per year lease and made Dr.
Gardner the first president of the
board of directors.
Twelve "run-abouts" (children
who had recovered enough to be
out of bed) lived in the house,
which was now open all year. In
1923 a gift of $40,000 made possi
ble the building of a boys' bed
unit and a school on the old back
porch of the residence.
From then on, the Home mush
roomed. In 1928-29 a $50,000 aux
iliary was built accommodating
80 children. As the children were
moved out of the house, the first
floor of the unit was converted
into administration offices and
meeting rooms for auxiliaries.
The second and third floors be
came the living quarters of the
staff.
Following completion of the ad
ministration building in 1953, the
first floor is being used for physi
cal. speech and occupational ther
apies.

tion of the elegant "summer resi
dence" of Senator and Mrs. Lo
land Stanford into the Stanford
Convalescent Home.
The Stanfords purchased their
home in 1 STG a three-story frame
building, simply decorated in
French provincial.
A visitor touring the old Stan
ford home entered through the
main hall of the original cottage
(two wings were added >. observed
two small parlors furnished ele
gantly with gold anr] rose, the
predominant colors, and then en
tered the library, containing
woodwork of sup e r b Spanish
cedar.
Gazing out the window, the vis
itor could see the beautiful
grounds, all with a natural park
like effect. The Chinese head gar
dener developed in box-hedge ihe
forms of several animals. The
lawns and winding roads were
swept daily — "almost dusted,"
commented one of the Stanfords'
frequent visitor-s.
Senator Stanford lived in this
home until his death in 1893. Mrs.
Stanford continued residence un
til her death in 1905. The follow
ing year most of the old residence
toppled in the famous San Fran
cisco earthquake.

| It was partially rebuilt and oc-
I cupied until 1919. Two years be
fore this, Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
then University chaplain, had ini
tiated a summer program on the
campus for convalescing children.
In 1919 Timothy Hopkins, a
member of the Board of Trustees,
suggested to the board that they
give 27 acres of land and the
house to the "Campus Auxiliary
to Stanford Clinics," as the Con
Home was called. The hoard.gave
the land and the old residence on
a $1-per year lease and made Dr.
Gardner the first president of the
board of directors.
Twelve "run-abouts" (children
who had recovered enough to be
out of bed) lived in the house,
which was now open all year. In
1923 a gift of $40,000 made possi
ble the building of a boys' bed
unit and a school on the old back
porch of the residence.
From then on, the Home mush
roomed. In 1928-29 a $50,000 aux
iliary was built accommodating
80 children. As the children were
moved out of the house, the first
floor of the unit was converted
into administration offices and
meeting rooms for auxiliaries.
The second and third floors be
came the living quarters of the
staff.
Following completion of the ad
ministration building in 1953, the
first floor is being used for physi
cal. speech and occupational ther
apies.
Only 43 years — and a house
built for entertaining famous per
sonalities was transformed into a
home housing numerous ill chil
dren. This was the transforma
tion of the elegant "summer resi
