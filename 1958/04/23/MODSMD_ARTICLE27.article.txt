# ASSU Candidates Explain Platforms, Ideas
## 
### 
1. The completion of several
l'irst and most obvious responsi
very important projects is the
biiity of the new ASSU president.
The long-awaited Student Union
and the new Bookstore should be
the objects of a vigorous policy
for their earliest possible comple
tion.
2. Student activities are the cre
ation of the will of the student
body. Student government is re
sponsible for lending its whole
hearted support to any activity
which reflects the interest of the
student body, but student govern
ment is not in the business of try
ing to cram unpopular activities
down the throats of an unwilling
student body.
3. The student body should be
represented as a lobby at the pol
icy-making level of the Univer
sity. For too many years student
views and opinions have taken a
back seat while important and
far-reaching decisions affecting
the future of the University have
been passed on tenth-hand to the
representatives of the student
body.
Student government should
avail itself of the opportunity to
be present at the meetings of.the
Board of Trustees and to bring
back to the students the real
story of these decisions, devoid of
delays and intermediary interpre
tations.

Make student government work
or throw it out! Though a $500,-
()00-a-year business, it has neither
the interest nor the respect of the
student body. To urge continua
tion without change in the pres
ent situation is to advocate wide
spread indifference by the stu
dent body and consequent ineffec
tiveness on the part of student
government. Without the support
of student opinion, student gov
ernment is severely crippled; and
as student government is weak
ened through lack of interest, stu
dent support declines still further.
The prerequisite step toward
effective s t u d en t government

must originate with the govern
ment itself. Before student opin
ion can be adequately expressed,
the student body must know the
problems and issues which il is
asked to consider.
Through a column in The Daily
analyzing objectively problems of
student concern, in conjunction
with question-and-answer broad
casts over KZSU when particular
issues arise, and by centralizing
information concerning the vari
ous issues in the president's of
fice so th a t interested groups
could have effective access to it
I would undertake to assure the
student body adequate informa
tion on which intelligent discus
sion and action could be based.
Equally as important as com
munication to the student body is
the acquisition of information
'rom it. I would favor reconsti
tuting the cabinet, which, being
close to an informed student body,
could serve as an advisory agency
to the president.
Obviously 1 do not advocate
throwing out student government
nor do I favor forcing it on an
unwilling student body. But to
make student government mean
anything other than student ad
ministration, we must first close
the gap which exists between the
student body and student gov
ernment.
I advocate giving student gov
ernment a chance by giving the
students the choice of participat
ing or not, a choice based on an
awareness of student affairs and
one which has thus far been de
nied them.

Most Stanford students are con
cerned with more important mat
ins than student government,
and for this reason many of them
L, r o through college with few, if
any, contacts with student gov
ernment. However, most of us
are involved in at least one extra
curricular activity which serves
our interests. And. whether we
realize it or not, ALL these com
mittees, boards and activities op
erate through the student Legis
lature, from which they receive
their approval and appropriations.
The basis of my platform is a
, closer relationship between these
| agencies and the Legislature.
During the two years I have
been on Legislature 1 have seen
many worthwhile financial and
social requests from organiza
tions and commissions voted down
flue to an overemphasis on prece
dent and red tape. This lack of
coordination between committees
and Legislature has had a harm
ful effect upon the main objective

of student government that of
helping the students and their ac
tivities.
If, however, each organization
were to have an ex-officio repre
sentative present al Legislature
meetings, particularly one week
before important business con
cerning an activity, Legislature
members would lose some of their
impersonal attitude toward stu
dent boards and commissions. A
direct representative from an or
ganization will accomplish much
more constructive action than
will a mimeographed sheet of re
quests.
I feel the cabinet can he used
more effectively next year. The
cabinet, representing class offi
cers and board chairmen, can
work with Legislature on such
measures as:
1. Keeping the Library open
one hour longer each i evening.
2. Keeping the men's gym open
on Sundays for athletics.
3. Finding out whether the stu
dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.
Together the cabinet and Legis
lature can work and cooperate
with the Administration for de
sired objectives.
And finally, although student
government certainly cannot be
forced on the students, interest
and participation can be increased
through an â€¢extensive effort by
student body officers.

The first consideration of any
J ASSU officer, especially ASSU
president, should be to provide
positive leader ship for student ac
tivities. This leadership should
not be limited to initiating new
and different projects, but also
emphasize thoughtful analysis of
existing projects and organiza
tions.
Student government should
never be thrust on students for
its own sake. When there i-s in

terest in activities, however,
whether they be Political Union,
Ham's Head, or the Scratch Sheet,
they should be supported.
This year's ASSU executive
government laid the groundwork
for important projects that any
successive executive must carry
through. These include plans for
starting the new Student Union
with funds now available. Fur
ther, this year's executives served
as ex'-officio members of the
Bookstore Board of Directors and
gave student ideas for the new
store. A committee appointed to
study the feasibility of liquor on
campus was initiated this year.
In addition to these, I feel that
there is a definite need for a stu
dent evaluation of courses such as
the "Scratch Sheet," and 1 would
work to see that such a publica
tion be set up under Publications
Board to insure its continuance.
Also, students do not have ade
quate education as to the ASSU
bylaws and working, and I have
high on my list the job of getting
out an informational bulletin of
the rules and regulations of the
ASSU organizations.
Finally, as ASSU president, a
representative of the University,
I would pledge myself to a
thoughtful study of the aims of
student government and make a
wholehearted effort to carry these
to completion in the best interests
of the student body and the Uni
versity as a whole.

In brief, my main campaign is
sue centers about the new frater
nity cluster idea. I realize that
this matter may not seem to be
of interest to the entire campus.
Yet the entire campus is interest
ed in maintaining all possible free
dom of living-group self-govern
ment.
Fraternities happen to bo the
group at present faced with an
increase in University control.
The outcome of the cluster plan
will in part determine the future

of other living groups. 1 am most
sincere in wanting to represent
the entiie campus. I feel very
strongly that action should be
taken, and taken now.
Fraternity clusters represent
only one solution to the problem
of small group living on the Stan
lord campus. Yet the University
is now unwilling to consider alter
natives. It will not allow fraterni
ties to build new houses or to add
wings, even though those fraterni
ties have collected sufficient mon
ey to do so.
The University insists on $300,-
000 units for 50 men; fraternities
on other campuses in this area
have bui 11 or contracted for
houses for only $175,000. The Uni
versity expects fraternities to pay
all of the $300,000. Once having
paid this sum, the fraternities are
given no leases, no written guar
antee of any kind, no individual
ity in the present sense of the
word and no reason to believe
that the University will not run
their unit as a dormitory in the
future.
1 propose, if elected, to ask the
University to consider this com
promise: Allow the fraternities to
join the clusters if they wish, or
build their own houses if they so
desire.
I hope these comments have
given you new insight into the
cluster plan. This is a real issue
which has implications for all
Stanford students of the future.

cers and board chairmen, can
work with Legislature on such
measures as:
1. Keeping the Library open
one hour longer each i evening.
2. Keeping the men's gym open
on Sundays for athletics.
3. Finding out whether the stu
dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.
Together the cabinet and Legis
lature can work and cooperate
with the Administration for de
sired objectives.
And finally, although student
government certainly cannot be
forced on the students, interest
and participation can be increased
through an â€¢extensive effort by
student body officers.

The first consideration of any
J ASSU officer, especially ASSU
president, should be to provide
positive leader ship for student ac
tivities. This leadership should
not be limited to initiating new
and different projects, but also
emphasize thoughtful analysis of
existing projects and organiza
tions.
Student government should
never be thrust on students for
its own sake. When there i-s in

terest in activities, however,
whether they be Political Union,
Ham's Head, or the Scratch Sheet,
they should be supported.
This year's ASSU executive
government laid the groundwork
for important projects that any
successive executive must carry
through. These include plans for
starting the new Student Union
with funds now available. Fur
ther, this year's executives served
as ex'-officio members of the
Bookstore Board of Directors and
gave student ideas for the new
store. A committee appointed to
study the feasibility of liquor on
campus was initiated this year.
In addition to these, I feel that
there is a definite need for a stu
dent evaluation of courses such as
the "Scratch Sheet," and 1 would
work to see that such a publica
tion be set up under Publications
Board to insure its continuance.
Also, students do not have ade
quate education as to the ASSU
bylaws and working, and I have
high on my list the job of getting
out an informational bulletin of
the rules and regulations of the
ASSU organizations.
Finally, as ASSU president, a
representative of the University,
I would pledge myself to a
thoughtful study of the aims of
student government and make a
wholehearted effort to carry these
to completion in the best interests
of the student body and the Uni
versity as a whole.

In brief, my main campaign is
sue centers about the new frater
nity cluster idea. I realize that
this matter may not seem to be
of interest to the entire campus.
Yet the entire campus is interest
ed in maintaining all possible free
dom of living-group self-govern
ment.
Fraternities happen to bo the
group at present faced with an
increase in University control.
The outcome of the cluster plan
will in part determine the future

of other living groups. 1 am most
sincere in wanting to represent
the entiie campus. I feel very
strongly that action should be
taken, and taken now.
Fraternity clusters represent
only one solution to the problem
of small group living on the Stan
lord campus. Yet the University
is now unwilling to consider alter
natives. It will not allow fraterni
ties to build new houses or to add
wings, even though those fraterni
ties have collected sufficient mon
ey to do so.
The University insists on $300,-
000 units for 50 men; fraternities
on other campuses in this area
have bui 11 or contracted for
houses for only $175,000. The Uni
versity expects fraternities to pay
all of the $300,000. Once having
paid this sum, the fraternities are
given no leases, no written guar
antee of any kind, no individual
ity in the present sense of the
word and no reason to believe
that the University will not run
their unit as a dormitory in the
future.
1 propose, if elected, to ask the
University to consider this com
promise: Allow the fraternities to
join the clusters if they wish, or
build their own houses if they so
desire.
I hope these comments have
given you new insight into the
cluster plan. This is a real issue
which has implications for all
Stanford students of the future.

1. The completion of several
l'irst and most obvious responsi
very important projects is the
biiity of the new ASSU president.
The long-awaited Student Union
and the new Bookstore should be
the objects of a vigorous policy
for their earliest possible comple
tion.
2. Student activities are the cre
ation of the will of the student
body. Student government is re
sponsible for lending its whole
hearted support to any activity
which reflects the interest of the
student body, but student govern
ment is not in the business of try
ing to cram unpopular activities
down the throats of an unwilling
student body.
3. The student body should be
represented as a lobby at the pol
icy-making level of the Univer
sity. For too many years student
views and opinions have taken a
back seat while important and
far-reaching decisions affecting
the future of the University have
been passed on tenth-hand to the
representatives of the student
body.
Student government should
avail itself of the opportunity to
be present at the meetings of.the
Board of Trustees and to bring
back to the students the real
story of these decisions, devoid of
delays and intermediary interpre
tations.

Make student government work
or throw it out! Though a $500,-
()00-a-year business, it has neither
the interest nor the respect of the
student body. To urge continua
tion without change in the pres
ent situation is to advocate wide
spread indifference by the stu
dent body and consequent ineffec
tiveness on the part of student
government. Without the support
of student opinion, student gov
ernment is severely crippled; and
as student government is weak
ened through lack of interest, stu
dent support declines still further.
The prerequisite step toward
effective s t u d en t government

must originate with the govern
ment itself. Before student opin
ion can be adequately expressed,
the student body must know the
problems and issues which il is
asked to consider.
Through a column in The Daily
analyzing objectively problems of
student concern, in conjunction
with question-and-answer broad
casts over KZSU when particular
issues arise, and by centralizing
information concerning the vari
ous issues in the president's of
fice so th a t interested groups
could have effective access to it
I would undertake to assure the
student body adequate informa
tion on which intelligent discus
sion and action could be based.
Equally as important as com
munication to the student body is
the acquisition of information
'rom it. I would favor reconsti
tuting the cabinet, which, being
close to an informed student body,
could serve as an advisory agency
to the president.
Obviously 1 do not advocate
throwing out student government
nor do I favor forcing it on an
unwilling student body. But to
make student government mean
anything other than student ad
ministration, we must first close
the gap which exists between the
student body and student gov
ernment.
I advocate giving student gov
ernment a chance by giving the
students the choice of participat
ing or not, a choice based on an
awareness of student affairs and
one which has thus far been de
nied them.

Most Stanford students are con
cerned with more important mat
ins than student government,
and for this reason many of them
L, r o through college with few, if
any, contacts with student gov
ernment. However, most of us
are involved in at least one extra
curricular activity which serves
our interests. And. whether we
realize it or not, ALL these com
mittees, boards and activities op
erate through the student Legis
lature, from which they receive
their approval and appropriations.
The basis of my platform is a
, closer relationship between these
| agencies and the Legislature.
During the two years I have
been on Legislature 1 have seen
many worthwhile financial and
social requests from organiza
tions and commissions voted down
flue to an overemphasis on prece
dent and red tape. This lack of
coordination between committees
and Legislature has had a harm
ful effect upon the main objective

of student government that of
helping the students and their ac
tivities.
If, however, each organization
were to have an ex-officio repre
sentative present al Legislature
meetings, particularly one week
before important business con
cerning an activity, Legislature
members would lose some of their
impersonal attitude toward stu
dent boards and commissions. A
direct representative from an or
ganization will accomplish much
more constructive action than
will a mimeographed sheet of re
quests.
I feel the cabinet can he used
more effectively next year. The
cabinet, representing class offi
cers and board chairmen, can
work with Legislature on such
measures as:
1. Keeping the Library open
one hour longer each i evening.
2. Keeping the men's gym open
on Sundays for athletics.
3. Finding out whether the stu
dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.

for their earliest possible comple
tion.
2. Student activities are the cre
ation of the will of the student
body. Student government is re
sponsible for lending its whole
hearted support to any activity
which reflects the interest of the
student body, but student govern
ment is not in the business of try
ing to cram unpopular activities
down the throats of an unwilling
student body.
3. The student body should be
represented as a lobby at the pol
icy-making level of the Univer
sity. For too many years student
views and opinions have taken a
back seat while important and
far-reaching decisions affecting
the future of the University have
been passed on tenth-hand to the
representatives of the student
body.
Student government should
avail itself of the opportunity to
be present at the meetings of.the
Board of Trustees and to bring
back to the students the real
story of these decisions, devoid of
delays and intermediary interpre
tations.

Make student government work
or throw it out! Though a $500,-
()00-a-year business, it has neither
the interest nor the respect of the
student body. To urge continua
tion without change in the pres
ent situation is to advocate wide
spread indifference by the stu
dent body and consequent ineffec
tiveness on the part of student
government. Without the support
of student opinion, student gov
ernment is severely crippled; and
as student government is weak
ened through lack of interest, stu
dent support declines still further.
The prerequisite step toward
effective s t u d en t government

must originate with the govern
ment itself. Before student opin
ion can be adequately expressed,
the student body must know the
problems and issues which il is
asked to consider.
Through a column in The Daily
analyzing objectively problems of
student concern, in conjunction
with question-and-answer broad
casts over KZSU when particular
issues arise, and by centralizing
information concerning the vari
ous issues in the president's of
fice so th a t interested groups
could have effective access to it
I would undertake to assure the
student body adequate informa
tion on which intelligent discus
sion and action could be based.
Equally as important as com
munication to the student body is
the acquisition of information
'rom it. I would favor reconsti
tuting the cabinet, which, being
close to an informed student body,
could serve as an advisory agency
to the president.
Obviously 1 do not advocate
throwing out student government
nor do I favor forcing it on an
unwilling student body. But to
make student government mean
anything other than student ad
ministration, we must first close
the gap which exists between the
student body and student gov
ernment.
I advocate giving student gov
ernment a chance by giving the
students the choice of participat
ing or not, a choice based on an
awareness of student affairs and
one which has thus far been de
nied them.

Most Stanford students are con
cerned with more important mat
ins than student government,
and for this reason many of them
L, r o through college with few, if
any, contacts with student gov
ernment. However, most of us
are involved in at least one extra
curricular activity which serves
our interests. And. whether we
realize it or not, ALL these com
mittees, boards and activities op
erate through the student Legis
lature, from which they receive
their approval and appropriations.
The basis of my platform is a
, closer relationship between these
| agencies and the Legislature.
During the two years I have
been on Legislature 1 have seen
many worthwhile financial and
social requests from organiza
tions and commissions voted down
flue to an overemphasis on prece
dent and red tape. This lack of
coordination between committees
and Legislature has had a harm
ful effect upon the main objective

of student government that of
helping the students and their ac
tivities.
If, however, each organization
were to have an ex-officio repre
sentative present al Legislature
meetings, particularly one week
before important business con
cerning an activity, Legislature
members would lose some of their
impersonal attitude toward stu
dent boards and commissions. A
direct representative from an or
ganization will accomplish much
more constructive action than
will a mimeographed sheet of re
quests.
I feel the cabinet can he used
more effectively next year. The
cabinet, representing class offi
cers and board chairmen, can
work with Legislature on such
measures as:
1. Keeping the Library open
one hour longer each i evening.
2. Keeping the men's gym open
on Sundays for athletics.
3. Finding out whether the stu
dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.
Together the cabinet and Legis
lature can work and cooperate
with the Administration for de
sired objectives.
And finally, although student
government certainly cannot be
forced on the students, interest
and participation can be increased
through an â€¢extensive effort by
student body officers.

The first consideration of any
J ASSU officer, especially ASSU
president, should be to provide
positive leader ship for student ac
tivities. This leadership should
not be limited to initiating new
and different projects, but also
emphasize thoughtful analysis of
existing projects and organiza
tions.
Student government should
never be thrust on students for
its own sake. When there i-s in

terest in activities, however,
whether they be Political Union,
Ham's Head, or the Scratch Sheet,
they should be supported.
This year's ASSU executive
government laid the groundwork
for important projects that any
successive executive must carry
through. These include plans for
starting the new Student Union
with funds now available. Fur
ther, this year's executives served
as ex'-officio members of the
Bookstore Board of Directors and
gave student ideas for the new
store. A committee appointed to
study the feasibility of liquor on
campus was initiated this year.
In addition to these, I feel that
there is a definite need for a stu
dent evaluation of courses such as
the "Scratch Sheet," and 1 would
work to see that such a publica
tion be set up under Publications
Board to insure its continuance.
Also, students do not have ade
quate education as to the ASSU
bylaws and working, and I have
high on my list the job of getting
out an informational bulletin of
the rules and regulations of the
ASSU organizations.
Finally, as ASSU president, a
representative of the University,
I would pledge myself to a
thoughtful study of the aims of
student government and make a
wholehearted effort to carry these
to completion in the best interests
of the student body and the Uni
versity as a whole.

In brief, my main campaign is
sue centers about the new frater
nity cluster idea. I realize that
this matter may not seem to be
of interest to the entire campus.
Yet the entire campus is interest
ed in maintaining all possible free
dom of living-group self-govern
ment.
Fraternities happen to bo the
group at present faced with an
increase in University control.
The outcome of the cluster plan
will in part determine the future

of other living groups. 1 am most
sincere in wanting to represent
the entiie campus. I feel very
strongly that action should be
taken, and taken now.
Fraternity clusters represent
only one solution to the problem
of small group living on the Stan
lord campus. Yet the University
is now unwilling to consider alter
natives. It will not allow fraterni
ties to build new houses or to add
wings, even though those fraterni
ties have collected sufficient mon
ey to do so.
The University insists on $300,-
000 units for 50 men; fraternities
on other campuses in this area
have bui 11 or contracted for
houses for only $175,000. The Uni
versity expects fraternities to pay
all of the $300,000. Once having
paid this sum, the fraternities are
given no leases, no written guar
antee of any kind, no individual
ity in the present sense of the
word and no reason to believe
that the University will not run
their unit as a dormitory in the
future.
1 propose, if elected, to ask the
University to consider this com
promise: Allow the fraternities to
join the clusters if they wish, or
build their own houses if they so
desire.
I hope these comments have
given you new insight into the
cluster plan. This is a real issue
which has implications for all
Stanford students of the future.

dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.
Together the cabinet and Legis
lature can work and cooperate
with the Administration for de
sired objectives.
And finally, although student
government certainly cannot be
forced on the students, interest
and participation can be increased
through an â€¢extensive effort by
student body officers.

The first consideration of any
J ASSU officer, especially ASSU
president, should be to provide
positive leader ship for student ac
tivities. This leadership should
not be limited to initiating new
and different projects, but also
emphasize thoughtful analysis of
existing projects and organiza
tions.
Student government should
never be thrust on students for
its own sake. When there i-s in

terest in activities, however,
whether they be Political Union,
Ham's Head, or the Scratch Sheet,
they should be supported.
This year's ASSU executive
government laid the groundwork
for important projects that any
successive executive must carry
through. These include plans for
starting the new Student Union
with funds now available. Fur
ther, this year's executives served
as ex'-officio members of the
Bookstore Board of Directors and
gave student ideas for the new
store. A committee appointed to
study the feasibility of liquor on
campus was initiated this year.
In addition to these, I feel that
there is a definite need for a stu
dent evaluation of courses such as
the "Scratch Sheet," and 1 would
work to see that such a publica
tion be set up under Publications
Board to insure its continuance.
Also, students do not have ade
quate education as to the ASSU
bylaws and working, and I have
high on my list the job of getting
out an informational bulletin of
the rules and regulations of the
ASSU organizations.
Finally, as ASSU president, a
representative of the University,
I would pledge myself to a
thoughtful study of the aims of
student government and make a
wholehearted effort to carry these
to completion in the best interests
of the student body and the Uni
versity as a whole.

In brief, my main campaign is
sue centers about the new frater
nity cluster idea. I realize that
this matter may not seem to be
of interest to the entire campus.
Yet the entire campus is interest
ed in maintaining all possible free
dom of living-group self-govern
ment.
Fraternities happen to bo the
group at present faced with an
increase in University control.
The outcome of the cluster plan
will in part determine the future

of other living groups. 1 am most
sincere in wanting to represent
the entiie campus. I feel very
strongly that action should be
taken, and taken now.
Fraternity clusters represent
only one solution to the problem
of small group living on the Stan
lord campus. Yet the University
is now unwilling to consider alter
natives. It will not allow fraterni
ties to build new houses or to add
wings, even though those fraterni
ties have collected sufficient mon
ey to do so.
The University insists on $300,-
000 units for 50 men; fraternities
on other campuses in this area
have bui 11 or contracted for
houses for only $175,000. The Uni
versity expects fraternities to pay
all of the $300,000. Once having
paid this sum, the fraternities are
given no leases, no written guar
antee of any kind, no individual
ity in the present sense of the
word and no reason to believe
that the University will not run
their unit as a dormitory in the
future.
1 propose, if elected, to ask the
University to consider this com
promise: Allow the fraternities to
join the clusters if they wish, or
build their own houses if they so
desire.
I hope these comments have
given you new insight into the
cluster plan. This is a real issue
which has implications for all
Stanford students of the future.

1. The completion of several
l'irst and most obvious responsi
very important projects is the
biiity of the new ASSU president.
The long-awaited Student Union
and the new Bookstore should be
the objects of a vigorous policy
for their earliest possible comple
tion.
2. Student activities are the cre
ation of the will of the student
body. Student government is re
sponsible for lending its whole
hearted support to any activity
which reflects the interest of the
student body, but student govern
ment is not in the business of try
ing to cram unpopular activities
down the throats of an unwilling
student body.
3. The student body should be
represented as a lobby at the pol
icy-making level of the Univer
sity. For too many years student
views and opinions have taken a
back seat while important and
far-reaching decisions affecting
the future of the University have
been passed on tenth-hand to the
representatives of the student
body.
Student government should
avail itself of the opportunity to
be present at the meetings of.the
Board of Trustees and to bring
back to the students the real
story of these decisions, devoid of
delays and intermediary interpre
tations.

Make student government work
or throw it out! Though a $500,-
()00-a-year business, it has neither
the interest nor the respect of the
student body. To urge continua
tion without change in the pres
ent situation is to advocate wide
spread indifference by the stu
dent body and consequent ineffec
tiveness on the part of student
government. Without the support
of student opinion, student gov
ernment is severely crippled; and
as student government is weak
ened through lack of interest, stu
dent support declines still further.
The prerequisite step toward
effective s t u d en t government

must originate with the govern
ment itself. Before student opin
ion can be adequately expressed,
the student body must know the
problems and issues which il is
asked to consider.
Through a column in The Daily
analyzing objectively problems of
student concern, in conjunction
with question-and-answer broad
casts over KZSU when particular
issues arise, and by centralizing
information concerning the vari
ous issues in the president's of
fice so th a t interested groups
could have effective access to it
I would undertake to assure the
student body adequate informa
tion on which intelligent discus
sion and action could be based.
Equally as important as com
munication to the student body is
the acquisition of information
'rom it. I would favor reconsti
tuting the cabinet, which, being
close to an informed student body,
could serve as an advisory agency
to the president.
Obviously 1 do not advocate
throwing out student government
nor do I favor forcing it on an
unwilling student body. But to
make student government mean
anything other than student ad
ministration, we must first close
the gap which exists between the
student body and student gov
ernment.
I advocate giving student gov
ernment a chance by giving the
students the choice of participat
ing or not, a choice based on an
awareness of student affairs and
one which has thus far been de
nied them.

Most Stanford students are con
cerned with more important mat
ins than student government,
and for this reason many of them
L, r o through college with few, if
any, contacts with student gov
ernment. However, most of us
are involved in at least one extra
curricular activity which serves
our interests. And. whether we
realize it or not, ALL these com
mittees, boards and activities op
erate through the student Legis
lature, from which they receive
their approval and appropriations.
The basis of my platform is a
, closer relationship between these
| agencies and the Legislature.
During the two years I have
been on Legislature 1 have seen
many worthwhile financial and
social requests from organiza
tions and commissions voted down
flue to an overemphasis on prece
dent and red tape. This lack of
coordination between committees
and Legislature has had a harm
ful effect upon the main objective

of student government that of
helping the students and their ac
tivities.
If, however, each organization
were to have an ex-officio repre
sentative present al Legislature
meetings, particularly one week
before important business con
cerning an activity, Legislature
members would lose some of their
impersonal attitude toward stu
dent boards and commissions. A
direct representative from an or
ganization will accomplish much
more constructive action than
will a mimeographed sheet of re
quests.
I feel the cabinet can he used
more effectively next year. The
cabinet, representing class offi
cers and board chairmen, can
work with Legislature on such
measures as:
1. Keeping the Library open
one hour longer each i evening.
2. Keeping the men's gym open
on Sundays for athletics.
3. Finding out whether the stu
dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.
Together the cabinet and Legis
lature can work and cooperate

ment is not in the business of try
ing to cram unpopular activities
down the throats of an unwilling
student body.
3. The student body should be
represented as a lobby at the pol
icy-making level of the Univer
sity. For too many years student
views and opinions have taken a
back seat while important and
far-reaching decisions affecting
the future of the University have
been passed on tenth-hand to the
representatives of the student
body.
Student government should
avail itself of the opportunity to
be present at the meetings of.the
Board of Trustees and to bring
back to the students the real
story of these decisions, devoid of
delays and intermediary interpre
tations.

Make student government work
or throw it out! Though a $500,-
()00-a-year business, it has neither
the interest nor the respect of the
student body. To urge continua
tion without change in the pres
ent situation is to advocate wide
spread indifference by the stu
dent body and consequent ineffec
tiveness on the part of student
government. Without the support
of student opinion, student gov
ernment is severely crippled; and
as student government is weak
ened through lack of interest, stu
dent support declines still further.
The prerequisite step toward
effective s t u d en t government

must originate with the govern
ment itself. Before student opin
ion can be adequately expressed,
the student body must know the
problems and issues which il is
asked to consider.
Through a column in The Daily
analyzing objectively problems of
student concern, in conjunction
with question-and-answer broad
casts over KZSU when particular
issues arise, and by centralizing
information concerning the vari
ous issues in the president's of
fice so th a t interested groups
could have effective access to it
I would undertake to assure the
student body adequate informa
tion on which intelligent discus
sion and action could be based.
Equally as important as com
munication to the student body is
the acquisition of information
'rom it. I would favor reconsti
tuting the cabinet, which, being
close to an informed student body,
could serve as an advisory agency
to the president.
Obviously 1 do not advocate
throwing out student government
nor do I favor forcing it on an
unwilling student body. But to
make student government mean
anything other than student ad
ministration, we must first close
the gap which exists between the
student body and student gov
ernment.
I advocate giving student gov
ernment a chance by giving the
students the choice of participat
ing or not, a choice based on an
awareness of student affairs and
one which has thus far been de
nied them.

Most Stanford students are con
cerned with more important mat
ins than student government,
and for this reason many of them
L, r o through college with few, if
any, contacts with student gov
ernment. However, most of us
are involved in at least one extra
curricular activity which serves
our interests. And. whether we
realize it or not, ALL these com
mittees, boards and activities op
erate through the student Legis
lature, from which they receive
their approval and appropriations.
The basis of my platform is a
, closer relationship between these
| agencies and the Legislature.
During the two years I have
been on Legislature 1 have seen
many worthwhile financial and
social requests from organiza
tions and commissions voted down
flue to an overemphasis on prece
dent and red tape. This lack of
coordination between committees
and Legislature has had a harm
ful effect upon the main objective

of student government that of
helping the students and their ac
tivities.
If, however, each organization
were to have an ex-officio repre
sentative present al Legislature
meetings, particularly one week
before important business con
cerning an activity, Legislature
members would lose some of their
impersonal attitude toward stu
dent boards and commissions. A
direct representative from an or
ganization will accomplish much
more constructive action than
will a mimeographed sheet of re
quests.
I feel the cabinet can he used
more effectively next year. The
cabinet, representing class offi
cers and board chairmen, can
work with Legislature on such
measures as:
1. Keeping the Library open
one hour longer each i evening.
2. Keeping the men's gym open
on Sundays for athletics.
3. Finding out whether the stu
dents are willing to pay 50 cents
more out of their tuition for the
Student Union.
Together the cabinet and Legis
lature can work and cooperate
with the Administration for de
sired objectives.
And finally, although student
government certainly cannot be
forced on the students, interest
and participation can be increased
through an â€¢extensive effort by
student body officers.

The first consideration of any
J ASSU officer, especially ASSU
president, should be to provide
positive leader ship for student ac
tivities. This leadership should
not be limited to initiating new
and different projects, but also
emphasize thoughtful analysis of
existing projects and organiza
tions.
Student government should
never be thrust on students for
its own sake. When there i-s in

terest in activities, however,
whether they be Political Union,
Ham's Head, or the Scratch Sheet,
they should be supported.
This year's ASSU executive
government laid the groundwork
for important projects that any
successive executive must carry
through. These include plans for
starting the new Student Union
with funds now available. Fur
ther, this year's executives served
as ex'-officio members of the
Bookstore Board of Directors and
gave student ideas for the new
store. A committee appointed to
study the feasibility of liquor on
campus was initiated this year.
In addition to these, I feel that
there is a definite need for a stu
dent evaluation of courses such as
the "Scratch Sheet," and 1 would
work to see that such a publica
tion be set up under Publications
Board to insure its continuance.
Also, students do not have ade
quate education as to the ASSU
bylaws and working, and I have
high on my list the job of getting
out an informational bulletin of
the rules and regulations of the
ASSU organizations.
Finally, as ASSU president, a
representative of the University,
I would pledge myself to a
thoughtful study of the aims of
student government and make a
wholehearted effort to carry these
to completion in the best interests
of the student body and the Uni
versity as a whole.

In brief, my main campaign is
sue centers about the new frater
nity cluster idea. I realize that
this matter may not seem to be
of interest to the entire campus.
Yet the entire campus is interest
ed in maintaining all possible free
dom of living-group self-govern
ment.
Fraternities happen to bo the
group at present faced with an
increase in University control.
The outcome of the cluster plan
will in part determine the future

of other living groups. 1 am most
sincere in wanting to represent
the entiie campus. I feel very
strongly that action should be
taken, and taken now.
Fraternity clusters represent
only one solution to the problem
of small group living on the Stan
lord campus. Yet the University
is now unwilling to consider alter
natives. It will not allow fraterni
ties to build new houses or to add
wings, even though those fraterni
ties have collected sufficient mon
ey to do so.
The University insists on $300,-
000 units for 50 men; fraternities
on other campuses in this area
have bui 11 or contracted for
houses for only $175,000. The Uni
versity expects fraternities to pay
all of the $300,000. Once having
paid this sum, the fraternities are
given no leases, no written guar
antee of any kind, no individual
ity in the present sense of the
word and no reason to believe
that the University will not run
their unit as a dormitory in the
future.
1 propose, if elected, to ask the
University to consider this com
promise: Allow the fraternities to
join the clusters if they wish, or
build their own houses if they so
desire.
I hope these comments have
given you new insight into the
cluster plan. This is a real issue
which has implications for all
Stanford students of the future.
