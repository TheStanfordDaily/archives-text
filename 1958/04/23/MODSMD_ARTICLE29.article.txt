Individual Expression
Student government should not
be a curtailing influence, but
rather a supporting and positive
emphasis for the development of
individual expression. I refer to
proposed projects like the Stan
ford Scratch Sheet. I would work
to see that projects of this nature
were carried to completion under
the auspices of the student body.
I propose to make the office of
vice-president creative as well as
administrative. The Student Un
ion along wilh Con Home proj
ects offers potential material for
your new student government.
A Liberal Philosophy
With respect to the inconsist
ency between theory and practice
within the Honor Code and Fun
damental Standard I feel it is the
art of a free society to propose a
code which satisfies an enlight
ened reason. Hence it would be
my aim to present the office of
vice-presid( ney as liberal in na
ture and dynamic in character.
In short, an office which would
lend a respoj viv? a id intelligent
ear to the demands and needs of
the sliidents ' v on the Stanford
campus.

This year's group of student
body officers have done an excel
lent job in raising the quality
and status of Stanford student
government. They have laid a
solid foundation which must be
built upon, rather than discount
ed, by next year's officers. There
is undoubtedly room for improve
ment in the present government,
and such improvement should be
undertaken; but to discard poli
cies merely because they are a
year old is to undermine the
whole structure of student gov
ernment.
Most freshmen enter Stanford
enthusiastically and are eager to
find a place to put their ideas and
talents to work. When student
government develops a program
which will challenge this initia
tive, enthusiasm and interest will
increase rather than dimini-sh aft
er the freshman year, and both
the individual and the University
will benefit.
The role of the vice-president is
of central importance to the effi
cient handling of the complex of
student activities on this campus.
I am prepared to devote my time
and energy to this task, accepting
Ihe responsibilities it entails.

A cheerleader cannot really
have a "New Deal" (i.e., a plat
form) to put into operation. But,
he can tell of a policy, a set of
guides, that he will follow should
he be elected.
My policy for a head yell leader
is the idea that he should be en
tertaining, but operate within the
bounds of good taste. He has to
like a crowd. And, in regard to
cheers, a cheerleader must follow
the words of that immortal poet
and philosopher, C. Jack Curtice:
"Be brief."

Spirit is Apathy
Noise ss Silence
All Yell Leaders Are Equal
But one is more equal than the
others. My experience in rousing
rabble at barn burnings, lynch
ings, labor riots, witch hunts and
faust rallies will be invaluable for
next year's Hate Meetings
against the College of Campanile,
Figueroa Tech and Moscow-by
the-Sea.
Arise—pack the polls with co
pious quantities of votes for me.
Big "Berk" is watching you.

Apathy will he one of the big
gest problems confronting the
yell leaders next year. Co-opera -
tion, rather than compel it ion,
within the yell squad; a new com
mission to plan publicity, organ
ize skits, give helpful criticism to
the squad, and hold interschool
pre - game parties; short, well
spaced yells; and, possibly, a
mixed rooting section are some
of the constructive measures
which I would put into operation
upon election.

Next season Stanford needs—-
—A radical, aggressive, respon
sible yell leader.
— Stimulation of interschool
sarcasm.
—A decent burial of those yells
which have died of over-use.
—Such guest yell leaders as a
lubricated Don Sherwood for half
time entertainment.
—A revival of collegiate frivol
ity, in particular, one captive
Oski.
A seasoned leader; one expe
rienced in finding the loopholes
and ambiguities in the University
administrative policies.
To these ends I will apply my
devious tactics.

The head yell leader is a person
who ought to command the re
spect and support of the entire
student body. With this in mind
I have tried to meet all that I
could and I have had my friends
speak for me, instead of the tra
ditional stunt type of campaign.
If this respect and support can
be achieved then there will be
complete backing of our various
alhletic teams, which is the basic
goal of every head yell leader.

The first job of the yell leader
is to keep the twisting, sweaty
mass of atheltic supporters in
constant uproar. I will abolish
such things as pontic recitals at
rallies and will initiate the "H. I.
I. Y." yell for the first time. I'll
do anything for a vote.
