# Memorial Church Offers Sunday School Positions
## 
### 
If you have been in Cubberley
on a Sunday morning trying to
find a quiet place, perhaps you
have noticed several students re
turning from Memorial Church
about 11:10, accompanied by a
large group of children. These are
the teachers and members of the
Sunday school classes, a part of
the church education program.
Organized by the University
chaplain and the Dean of Educa
tion, the program is designed to
provide religious instruction for
the children of parishioners of
Memorial Church and to enable
Education majors to gain teach
ing experience.
These are still the purposes of
the program, but both sides have
expanded. The program now m
•ludes kindergarten through the
eighth grade. Any child may at
tend, and any University student,
not only an Education major, may
teach Ihem.
Some of the student, teachers
take the course for credit, some
just for the challenge and satis
faction found in teaching. It is
best to have a Christian religions
background to teach, but anyone
interested is considered. The pro
gram is listed in the catalog as
Education 114, a three-unit course
given all three quarters.
Those taking the course for
credit meet once a week for two
hours with their instructor, Em
ery MacFarlane. Other sources of
advice for the student teachers
are Chaplain Robert Minto, As
sistant Chaplain Tom Derr and
Church Secretary Betty Camm.
For the most part, how ever, the
'eacher finds himself almosl en
tirely on his own, for the develop
ment of the teacher is a part of
he program as well as the reli
gious growth of the children. The
eachers are entirely free in pre

paring their individual class
plans; all that is required is ap
proval by the instructor of the
general plan.
The Stanford church education
program, almost unique in the
university world, provides an un
usual opportunity for the student
seeking service and teaching ex
perience.

provide religious instruction for
the children of parishioners of
Memorial Church and to enable
Education majors to gain teach
ing experience.
These are still the purposes of
the program, but both sides have
expanded. The program now m
•ludes kindergarten through the
eighth grade. Any child may at
tend, and any University student,
not only an Education major, may
teach Ihem.
Some of the student, teachers
take the course for credit, some
just for the challenge and satis
faction found in teaching. It is
best to have a Christian religions
background to teach, but anyone
interested is considered. The pro
gram is listed in the catalog as
Education 114, a three-unit course
given all three quarters.
Those taking the course for
credit meet once a week for two
hours with their instructor, Em
ery MacFarlane. Other sources of
advice for the student teachers
are Chaplain Robert Minto, As
sistant Chaplain Tom Derr and
Church Secretary Betty Camm.
For the most part, how ever, the
'eacher finds himself almosl en
tirely on his own, for the develop
ment of the teacher is a part of
he program as well as the reli
gious growth of the children. The
eachers are entirely free in pre

paring their individual class
plans; all that is required is ap
proval by the instructor of the
general plan.
The Stanford church education
program, almost unique in the
university world, provides an un
usual opportunity for the student
seeking service and teaching ex
perience.
