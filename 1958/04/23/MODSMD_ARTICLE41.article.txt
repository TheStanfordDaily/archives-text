# UCLA Relies on Field Strength to Beat Indians
## 
### 
Rafer Johnson and his UCLA
teammates invade Stanford Sta
dium Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in
what promises to.be another
tough track meet for Stanford.
The Indians will be underdogs
to the Bruins, who are loaded in
the field events and adequately
represented on the track.
Johnson, although still both
ered by a thigh injury which has
kept him out of races for two
weeks, could easily score three
first places against the Cards.
No Contest
Johnson put the shot 54-5,
threw the javelin 223-11% and
hurled the discus 16'l-6 against
Fresno State last Saturday as the
Bruins won handily, 92-38. This
was the same Fresno club that
look Stanford all the way to the
relay before losing, 66 % -64 1 :i.
The only men to beat Johnson
were teammates Duane Milleman
and Curt Ulrich. Milleman threw
the shot 54-11 3 4 and Ulrich got off
a javelin effort of 224-11 John
son was second in both events
and won the discus.
George Roubanis also looks
good for five Bruin points. He's
a Greek exchange student and
has pole-vaulted over 15 feet.
Roubanis was a former pupil of
Stanford coach Payton Jordan

when he attended Occidental two
years ago, and placed third in the
1956 Olympic Games.
Ceylonese High-Jumper
Another foreign student, Naga
lingam Ethirveerasingam from
Ceylon, gives UCLA high jump
strength. He and basketballer
Walt Torrence are consistent in
the 6-5 range. Ex-PCC champ
Dick Knaub heads the Bruin
broad jump corps.
On the track, UCLA depends
chiefly on sprinter Dave James,
hurdlers Ken Thompson and Mar
vin Luster, and a stable of excel
lent 440 men. James has bests of
9.7 and 21.6.
Luster could give Stanford's
Chuck Cobb plenty of trouble in
the lows particularly, since he
ran 23.1 in a losing effort against
Ancel Robinson Saturday. Luster
has run 14.3 in the highs.
Stan King, a consistent per
former in the 48 • second area,
teams with Doug Julian and Sid
Pelston to provide Ducky Drake
with his strong quarter-mile con
tingent.

Ceylonese High-Jumper
Another foreign student, Naga
lingam Ethirveerasingam from
Ceylon, gives UCLA high jump
strength. He and basketballer
Walt Torrence are consistent in
the 6-5 range. Ex-PCC champ
Dick Knaub heads the Bruin
broad jump corps.
On the track, UCLA depends
chiefly on sprinter Dave James,
hurdlers Ken Thompson and Mar
vin Luster, and a stable of excel
lent 440 men. James has bests of
9.7 and 21.6.
Luster could give Stanford's
Chuck Cobb plenty of trouble in
the lows particularly, since he
ran 23.1 in a losing effort against
Ancel Robinson Saturday. Luster
has run 14.3 in the highs.
Stan King, a consistent per
former in the 48 • second area,
teams with Doug Julian and Sid
Pelston to provide Ducky Drake
with his strong quarter-mile con
tingent.
