# Netters Win; Ogden Loses
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman tennis
team, despite a loss incurred by
number one ace Dick Ogden, con
tinued its winning ways and de
feated San Francisco City College
for its sixth straight win.
Ogden, who had a tough after
noon, couldn't find the range with
his ground strokes and continu
ally let City College's Jim Watson
take the offense. The left-handed
Watson, an experienced yet often
under-ranked player, took advan
tage of every mistake of Ogden's
and won a hard 6-8. 6-3, 9-7 match.
Norm Karns, Stanford's unde
feated number two man. won eas
ily from Norm Saschin 6-0, 6-2.
Ev Moulton, George Bates, Bob
Baker and Phil Hayek all adder!
straight set wins to help in the
8-1 defeat of City College.
In doubles play Moulton and
Bates combined as did Ogden and
Karns and Baker and Don Brobst
to finish off Stanford's wins.
