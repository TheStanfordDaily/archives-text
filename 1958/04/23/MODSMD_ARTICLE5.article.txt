# East, West Must Make Concessions for Peace
## 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Too rigid in its outlook, the West must become used to the idea
that concessions should be made by both sides in easing world ten
sions, British economist T. E. M. McKitterick told last night's Tues
day Evening Series audience in Memorial Auditorium.
"We must face the fact that with tensions mounting we need posi-

tive actionâ€”a willingness to con
cede something," he said. "If we
don't find a satisfactory answer
to the challenge of concessions,
;we shall lose support of world
i areas that are now with us."
"A Labour government would
be less concerned with the mili
tary challenge of Communism
; than with the non- military as
pect," he continued. To support
j this theory, he suggested that "by
spending so much on the develop
ment of weapons we are diverting
from more profitable uses with
which we are not well supplied."
He suggested that more atten
tion should be applied to the non
military aspect of concessions
.colonial liberation; solving politi
cal problems, such as Cyprus; al
levialing harmful effects of Eng
land's internal economic policies
! on other countries; controlling in
ternal behavior.
McKitterick, assuming that a
summit conference will lie held,
feels positive results can be at
tained, providing both sides are
willing to make concessions.
lie believes five main issues
should come before the confer
ence: (1) the Near East, in which
both Russia and the West are at
tempting to re-achieve stability;
12) the Far East, where the West
would have to make the conces
sion of recognizing Red China;
(3) a neutral /.one proposed for
central Europe; (4) concessions
from the East; (.">) the hydrogen
bomb tests, which the Labour par
ty believes should be elimi
nated.
