New Ballots

on only six ballots and each stu
dent will receive three ballots ap
plicable to him.
All students receive an ASSU
ballot which has spaces to vote
for ASSU president, vice - presi
dent and head yell leader. Men
students receive a men's ballot on
which they may vote for LASSU
and Men's Council candidates.
Each woman student receives a
women's ballot which lists candi
dates for Women's Council, AWS
offices and WRA posts. Each un
dergraduate also receives a class
ballot for either senior, junior or
sophomore class offices.
To Get Ballot
According to Bill Richards,
Elections Commission chairman,
a few graduate men students
were unintentionally not given
ballots to vote for Men's Council
candidates. "Only two or three
of these persons, who voted at
Physics Corner, have not been lo
cated," said Richards, "and if
these persons will come to see me
I will personally give them a
ballot."
According to Elections Com
mission, one candidate's name
was misspelled on the primary
ballot. Anthonie Voogd, candi
date for Village Off-Campus Leg
islature representative, was listed
on the ballot as ''Anthonie
Joogdt." Another candidate, Mike
Ely, was erroneously listed in
The Daily as running for junior
class president. According to
Richards, Ely is actually a candi
date for junior class vice-presi
dent.
