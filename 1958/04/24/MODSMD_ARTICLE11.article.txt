# Disarmament Key Issue In First Model UN Talks
## Karen Erickson Tells U.S. Policy to Delegates at Seattle 
### 
Disarmament will bo one of the
major issues tackled by delegates
to the eighth annual Model Unit
ed Nations in committee meet
ings today.
In the opening session at Seat
tle last night, Karen Erickson,
chairman of the U.S. delegation,
said the U.S. believes that the
suspension of nuclear tests as an
end and issue in itself is desir
able.
In the context of disarmament,
Miss Erickson explained, the U.S.
is compelled to seek a stable and
workable plan of suspension of
tests. Hence, the U.S. commends
the Soviet Union for the action
taken in suspending tests, but re

grets that such action has served
to swell the issue of nuclear test
ing to the point of obscuring the
issue of disarmament.
The disarmament question will
be discussed in the Political and
Security Committee today. Rep
resenting the U.S. on this com
mittee are YVally Simpson and
Lester O'Shea.
Respects for national desires of
self-identification and independ
ence will form the U.S. stand in
the Social, Cultural and Humani
tarian Committee, where Dave
Zenoff and Birgit Brock-Utne will
speak for the U.S., and in the
Trusteeship Council where Jeff
Commons and Bonnie Pomeroy
represent the U.S.
Disarmament Question
United States delegates will
also attack the problem of the
development of the United Na
tions into a more necessary organ
with a leading role in internation
al life. Steve Breyer will present
a resolution on the Kashmir prob
lem to the Security Council and
Jeff Fadiman and Cynthia Ken
dall will discuss the use of Ar
ticle 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN
Charter which prevents the UN
from intervening in the domestic
affairs of any nation.
John Jordan and Mike Willem
son will take two cases to the
International Court of Justice
when it convenes today. The first
is against Norway's request to
have the UN stop the United
States, .Russia and Great Britain
from using oceans for nuclear
detonations and dumping of ra
dioactive refuse material.
Hungary Accuses
The second case to go before
the International Court of Justice
will be the Hungarian accusation
that the United States is violating
international protocol by harbor
ing a convicted Hungarian crimi
nal in the American Embassy in
Budapest.
Some 600 delegates are on hand
for the four-day conference at the
University of Washington. Stu
dents from colleges and universi
ties in Arizona, California, Idaho,
Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wash
ington are representing the coun
tries of the world.
Others making up the 16-man
Stanford-U.S. delegation are Stu-
Pollak, Yvonne Olson, Randy
Freeman and Lois Hoose.

Disarmament will bo one of the
major issues tackled by delegates
to the eighth annual Model Unit
ed Nations in committee meet
ings today.
In the opening session at Seat
tle last night, Karen Erickson,
chairman of the U.S. delegation,
said the U.S. believes that the
suspension of nuclear tests as an
end and issue in itself is desir
able.
In the context of disarmament,
Miss Erickson explained, the U.S.
is compelled to seek a stable and
workable plan of suspension of
tests. Hence, the U.S. commends
the Soviet Union for the action
taken in suspending tests, but re

grets that such action has served
to swell the issue of nuclear test
ing to the point of obscuring the
issue of disarmament.
The disarmament question will
be discussed in the Political and
Security Committee today. Rep
resenting the U.S. on this com
mittee are YVally Simpson and
Lester O'Shea.
