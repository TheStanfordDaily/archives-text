# NO HYSTERIA
## Ike Soft-pedals Hot Issue; Slump 'Minor Emergency' 
### 
WASHINGTON (/-Pj President Eisenhower described the reces
sion yesterday as a "minor emergency." He said it is being met and
"I don't think we should get hysterical about any of this business."
Eisenhower told a news conference it has been evident for two or
three weeks that "the rate of decline has been flattening out." He

credited his administration with
"a very impressive record" in
combatting the slump.
Once again, the President left
a tax cut to the indefinite future.
He said he doesn't believe it re
stores confidence just to say sud
denly: "Here is some kind of a
tax cut."
People who blithely say, "have
a tax cut," Eisenhower remarked,
don't stop to think that defense
is expensive, growing more ex
pensive, and the country must be
ready to meet high defense costs
for possibly 40 to 50 years.
"We are meeting a minor emer
gency internally," he said, "but
let us not forget the grave inter
national emergency as we are
with our immediate
sources of income to each of us
at this moment."
The nation's living costs, still
moving counter to the recession,
rose to another record high in
March. But officials said this
summer may bring a leveling off
of the two - year consumer cost
spiral.
Ewan Clague, labor statistics
commissioner, commented that
"people have got to eat" and said
that despite the business reces
sion they have been bidding up
relatively short supplies of most
food items.
The short supply was caused by
bad winter and spring weather.
Clague said supplies now are
improving, with the prospect that
food costs, comprising nearly
one-third of family budgets, may
level off.
