# A 						Beneficial Change
## 
### 
A GTJOTJP OF WOMEN STUDENTS was recently or
ganized to work lor a change in the University
housing policy which would allow women to
live off-campus with parental permission. \\ e
wish them all success, since we feel that all
students should have the opportunity to live
iu whatever atmosphere they think best for
their personal growth and well-being.
We will not he so outspoken as to claim that
dormitories are the Administration's way of
enforcing conformity, as some have main
tained. el it is undeniable that certain social
pressures iu close group living do tend to limit
individual development and expression within
definite confines of acceptability.
If the Administration's main concern in this
question is one of morality—that women would
fall into evil ways if allowed to live off-campus
—we wonder how this notion can be reconciled
with the spirit of the Fundamental Standard,
which assumes that Stanford students are
mature enough to look after their own best
interests and that they ;rill do so (at least, this
is what we are told).
From a completely practical standpoint,
both the students and the Administration
would be better off, in our opinion, if women
were allowed to live off-campus. Those women
who find it difficult to study in dorms would

presumably benefit from the quiet and privacy
of off-campus living. The University's housing
problem would become considerably smaller,
and money earmarked for dormitory construc
tion could be directed to more vital things.
Perhaps the Administration feels the obliga
tion to help students adjust socially through
group living. Social adjustment is certainly an
important thing, but we find it hard to believe
that "anti-social"* students gain much from
dormitory life. On the contrary, it seems to us
that the independence of off-campus life lays
a better foundation for personal adjustment of
all kinds. In any case, the many campus extra
curricular groups offer a more realistic oppor
tunity for social contact based on common in
terest than does the arbitrary dormitory group.
We suspect that the Administration's main
reason for refusing women the privilege of
living off-campus—as it has repeatedly done—
is that the "character"' of the University would
change by granting this privilege. We agree
it would change, and we think that change
would be extremely beneficial to the whole
University community. \\ e cannot imagine
Stanford turning into a "streetcar college" like
UCLA, as some fear. Hut a large group of off
campus students would, we believe, help de
velop part of Stanford's great potential which
has thus far remained dormant.

iu whatever atmosphere they think best for

We will not he so outspoken as to claim that
dormitories are the Administration's way of
enforcing conformity, as some have main
tained. el it is undeniable that certain social
pressures iu close group living do tend to limit
individual development and expression within
definite confines of acceptability.
If the Administration's main concern in this
question is one of morality—that women would
fall into evil ways if allowed to live off-campus
—we wonder how this notion can be reconciled
with the spirit of the Fundamental Standard,
which assumes that Stanford students are
mature enough to look after their own best
interests and that they ;rill do so (at least, this
is what we are told).
From a completely practical standpoint,
both the students and the Administration
would be better off, in our opinion, if women
were allowed to live off-campus. Those women
who find it difficult to study in dorms would

presumably benefit from the quiet and privacy
of off-campus living. The University's housing
problem would become considerably smaller,
and money earmarked for dormitory construc
tion could be directed to more vital things.
Perhaps the Administration feels the obliga
tion to help students adjust socially through
group living. Social adjustment is certainly an
important thing, but we find it hard to believe
that "anti-social"* students gain much from
dormitory life. On the contrary, it seems to us
that the independence of off-campus life lays
a better foundation for personal adjustment of
all kinds. In any case, the many campus extra
curricular groups offer a more realistic oppor
tunity for social contact based on common in
terest than does the arbitrary dormitory group.
We suspect that the Administration's main
reason for refusing women the privilege of
living off-campus—as it has repeatedly done—
is that the "character"' of the University would
change by granting this privilege. We agree
it would change, and we think that change
would be extremely beneficial to the whole
University community. \\ e cannot imagine
Stanford turning into a "streetcar college" like
UCLA, as some fear. Hut a large group of off
campus students would, we believe, help de

has thus far remained dormant.
