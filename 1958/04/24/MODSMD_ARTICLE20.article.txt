Cross Favoritism
Editor, The Daily:
If the Con Home tricycle race is an example,
1he days of free, competitive amateur athletics
at Stanford are fast fading. Not since the days
of the PCC scandals has an incident of such gross
favoritism occurred.
As two well-known local athletes, we entered
1he competition on the understanding that it
would be organized in an impartial fashion. To
our chagrin, this was not the case. To be specific:
1) Gross favoritism in the assignment of "ve
hicles" (the term is loosely employed here). One
tricycle was so rigged that when the rider was
just gaining his stride, the handle fell off.
2) Intimidation. One of the participants (who
shall remain unnamed for fear of embarrassing
Ihe local Police Department) was openly blan
dishing a gun and reminding other participants
of minor traffic violations that had occurred in
the past.
3) Faulty equipment. The chairman of the
event brought only one se( of proper headgear
which he himself used! The winner came pre
pared with crash helmet and road flares. The
undersigned were attired only in Quad clothes.
'1) Unsportsmanlike conduct. The leading racer
was seen surreptitiously spraying the northeast
curve with oil slick, thereby endangering Ihe
lives not only of the participants but also of the
hundreds of spectators lining the track.
5) Denial of technical assistance. The timing
of the race was so arranged that the pit crews of

1he undersigned were still pursuing their aca
demic interests in the Civ lecture.
Another race—this time with proper supervi
sion—is the only fair answer. If such is not
forthcoming, we challenge the chairman of the
event to a Frisby duel at dawn Thursday on Inner
Quad.

Marx's One-W orld
Editor, The Daily:
The April 21 issue of The Stanford Daily was
published by the freshman staff, it says. Pre
sumably it was also written by a freshman staff?
If so. the author of the editorial rather frighten
ingly titled "Lethal Anachronism" is a freshman.
Alumni. I think, are entitled to be gently kind to
freshmen. They may well have better brains
than we do, but we have had ours longer. There
fore, respecting their birthright to speak as they
think, we are free to suggest 1hal it is usually
wise to check the full facts before they advise us,
our President, our common country- and its edu
cational system.
"Marx had mastered in 1S48 what the U.S. still
does not fully understand one-worldism," wrote
the young author of the editorial in question. In
commending to the U.S. the foresightedness of
the father of Communism, the author has over
looked the pathological the lethal aspect of the
one world drawn up by Herr Marx.
He planned to own it.
