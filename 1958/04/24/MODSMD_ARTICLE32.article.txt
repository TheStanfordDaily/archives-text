A Call to Arms
The call to arms wont up Monday—a call for good, strong arms,
and Legs, and shoulders, too. And, to use a localism, good heads wore
an attribute sought when Head Football Coach Jack Curtice opened
siiring practice.
Around the conference, and around the country for that matter,
spring football practice often takes the form of some mighty strenu
ous fall-like workouts, but out on the Card practice gridiron the call
is for study-type brain workouts while Curtice runs through a new
Texas via l.'tali system of football.
For ihe most part, the Curtice spread T is not any major innova
tion. There are many who claim that only the most acute strategy
minded grandstanders will be able to tell the old style from the new.
But there are enough changes to make Curtice devote most of this
spring practice session to talking over the newness. And listening
to ( iirt«• tell his boys about it is a pretty interesting way to spend
an afternoon.
Stanford's new coach is a business-like guy whose on-the-field lec
tures, and they are lectures, are informative* interesting, and, you
may have guessed, also amusing. Without a doubt they're better

than many an in - the - classroom
hour I've spent.
Practices are all open and
worth stopping by to see. New
coaches, new plays, and a new
team all in a Hollywood - type
sneak preview some four months
before anybody has to pay. And
it sure helps In appreciate a team,
winner or loser, after seeing how
much work they put in just to
give a few of us a pleasant 2! £
hours on a Saturday afternoon
come fall.
Curtice has had a good turnout
so far this session. The close-to
-100 candidates who turned out
Monday fell off a bit yesterday
and Tuesday, but the squad will
average 70 - 75 hopefuls right
through May 17. Two frosh
names and a varsity man from
last year's squads who had fig
ured to be prominent names are

not out at practice, and it doesn't look like two of them will get in
much work at all.
End Joel Fries, from Chuck Taylor's 1937 Indians, is not expected
to get much benefit from actual practice as he has just come away
from a stint in the Palo Alio Hospital. Joel contracted a serious skin
rash that really had the local medics concerned for a while, but
seems over the hump now. He's still on a special diet and trying to
regain a bit of lost weight, so will do some play-studying, but has
been advised not to get into the full spring swing. The local word
has i1 that Freis caught Ihe germ from his pet rabbit.
What About Dowd, Toorvald?
Frosh star fullback, and winner of last year's Murphy Memorial
Trophy, Gil Dowd is another man conspicuous by his absence. Dowd
was hurt toward the end of the season last year, seriously enough to
require an operation. A re-injury to his thigh was expected to keep
him out of spring drills, but trainer Connie Jarvis believes Dowd'll
be out within a week.
Freshman Phil Toorvald won't be as lucky as his teammate. Toor
vald, who was expected 1o benefit a good deal from practice, will be
operated on today for a knee injury. I guess that's all that need be
said about how much he'll do between now and May 17.
When Curtice was signed on as the new Stanford coach after
Taylor resigned last year the air was full of speculation as to just
who would, or might, be the Indians' quarterback for the next season
or two. The nod alternated between junior Bob Nicolet and sopho
more Sid Garber.
Nicolet seemed to get the specualtors' nod whenever passing em
phasis was discussed, and for a running attack it went to Garber.
Just recently, though, a dark horse name began to creep into the
picture. Sophomore Dick Norman is being sized up as the next pos
sible Card field captain.
Norman is a big boy; at 6-3 he's two inches taller than Nicolet,
and has three inches over Garber. He's fast, they say, and does
things well. He's played with the '56 frosh squad but didn't: get much
chance to play last year with no Braves squad in action. And Nor
man, like Garber and Nicolet, too, had a hard time trying to catch
anybody's eye with guys like John Brodie and -lack Douglas vying
for that QE spot.
SPORTS SHORTS —"School spirit plus" in view these days at
the BAC. Sports Publicity Director Don Liebendorfer and Curtice
sport the most eye-catching red and white telephones I've ever seen.
It's old, but I can't pass this up. T,.A. comedian Tom Duggan,
commenting a while ago, the night before the Robinson-Basilio fight:
"I want Robinson to win, but in Chicago he couldn't win it he
bad Eddie Arcaro riding him."
And this story on the AP wire from Greenville, South Carolina,
the other day:
The sports department of the Greenville News reported that a
high school student telephoned the outcome of his school's baseball
game, then this conversation transpired:
"What was the score by innings?" the sports desk asked.
"I don't know," the student replied.
"How about hits?"
"I don't know."
"Leading batters?"
"I don't know," came the standard answer. Then the student
added:
"By the way, the coach says give us a bigger story this time."



DICK NORMAN
Dark Horse QB?
