tennis team to provide The
Daily with day-to-day .reports
of the team's progress in Ihe
O.jai Tournament.)

Ojai, California, will be the
spot this weekend where Stan
lord's varsity tennis team will
seek lo revenge two early-season
trouncings dealt them by the
University of Southern California
and UCLA.
Stanford, USC and UCLA will
make up three-fourths of tho en
tries in the PCC Championship
Division of the large Ojai Invita
tion Tourney, one of the oldest
tennis tourneys in the country.
Stanford is sending six repre
sentatives to play in the cham
pionships which are scheduled to
get under way this morning. Jack
Douglas will hold his usual posi
tion of Stanford's top hope in the
singles tourney and ho and
Brooks Rawlins will be Stanford's
top doubles entry.
Other Competitors
Other Stanford competitors en
tered in the tourney are Dave
Nelson, Lowell Carruth, Jim Jef
fries and Robin Hilgcman.
Nelson appears to be Stanford's
strong dark horse candidate for
singles honors. Nelson, who re

| cently has pushed his way Into
ihe lop circle of PCC netters, may
finally be ready lo pull enough
upsets to go all the way at Ojai.
Nelson and Lowell Carruth,
Stanford's second - ranking doub
les team, will have an extra load
to haul in the doubles competi
tion since Rawlins, the second
half of Stanford's top combo, has
been hobbling along on an in
jured knee and no one is sure
whether it will bo strong enough
for the tall San Franciscan to
give a top performance.
Team Trophy
Along with the individual sin
gles and doubles competitions
there is a trophy awarded to the
school whose six-man team rolls
up the highest score.
Stanford's squad will be picked

as pro-tourney third in front of
Cal but trailing USC and UCLA.
It will take the best Stanford can
offer to win against such top men
from the southern schools as SC's
A 1 Olmedo, Ed Atkinson and Gor
don Davis, and UCLA's Mike
Franks, Mike Green, John Cran
ston and John Lesch.
Olmedo will be pre - tourney
pick to cop the singles but UCLA
will be heavy team favorite.
Good Test
Along wilh Nelson and Doug
las, Rawlins, provided his knee
is strong enough, could also be
come a big winner in the singles
competition. Carruth, Jeffries
and Hilgeman will need to play
way over their heads to reach
anywhere near the finals, but a
quarter-final berth for any one
or more of the three would leave
Stanford in a very good spot in
team competition.
The tourney will be the second
test of whether- Stanford's '58
team, perhaps the strongest in 15
years, has anything besides
Northern California champion
ship potential in it. Its first test
was a flop when the Indians lost
on two consecutive days at USC
and UCLA.
The three-team rivalry will
have a third chapter on May 1G
and 17 when USC and UCLA
come to Stanford.
