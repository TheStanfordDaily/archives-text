# Two Changes Set for UCLA Meet Saturday
## 
### 
Ernie Cunliffe is out of the
mile and John Kelly is on the
mile relay loam. These were the
two latest decisions 1o come out
of the Stanford track camp as
Payton Jordan readies his team
for Saturday's upset attempt
against UCLA.
Sunday, Jordan had decided to
run Cunliffe in the mile, and then
the sophomore ace said that he
also wanted to run in the 880.
This was OK at first, bul then it
was decided to limit Cunliffe to
only the shorter race.
Kelly has been added to the re
lay team in place of Norman
Lloyd. Lloyd, who normally runs
the third leg, won't be able 1o go
in the relay since he's running
both the mile and two-mile. There
is only one event between the
eight-lapper and the relay.
The new quartet will have Kel
ly leading off, Dick Lassen mov
ing from leadoff to second, Cun
liffe going from second to third,
and Don Chesarek continuing in
his anchor spot.
