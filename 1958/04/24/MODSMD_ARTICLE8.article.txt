## Nikita Puts Test Issue Up to Ike 
### 
LONDON (/b Nikita Khrush
chev has told President Eisenhow
er in a new letter that Soviet ini
tiative in ending nuclear weap
ons tests puts the test issue up to
the United States and Britain.
The letter, handed over Tuesday
in Washington, added little to pre
vious Khrushchev statements.
A Tass summary broadcast last
night by Radio Moscow quoted
the Soviet premier as writing
"From now on the U.S.S.R. will
not explode a single atom bomb,
not a single hydrogen bomb, un
less the United States or Britain
compel it to."
"Now it depends only on the
United States and Britain wheth
er nuclear tests will be ended for
all time or whether they will con
tinue," he said.
In Washington some officials
viewed Khrushchev's letter as
serving notice that, if the United
States and Britain go through
with their announced plans for
tests in the coming months, Rus
sia will resume its own tests.
The Tass account said Khrush
chev wrote that Eisenhower's re
ply to his previous message does
not show U.S. readiness to follow
the Soviet example in announcing
an end to nuclear weapons tests.
"The President declared that
the U.S.S..R. undertook this meas
ure after having tested nuclear
weapons, but is it not a fact that
the United States has conducted
far more atomic and hydrogen
weapons tests than the U.S.S.R.?"
he wrote.
"Could not the United States
show initiative in discontinuing
experiments after any one of its
tests?"
