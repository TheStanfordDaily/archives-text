## SU Women To Choose Housing Plan 
### 
Women students will choose
among three housing plans in the
housing program election to be
held Monday.
Plan A proposes the following:
(1) In Florence Moore, the Row
and Union, each separate house is
to hold no more than two-thirds
of any one class and no fewer
than one-sixth of any one class.
The remaining one-sixth is open
to any of the three classes. (2) In
Lagunita each casa is to house no
more than two-thirds sophomores
nor fewer than one-third juniors.
(3) No senior is to draw into La
gunita.
One Exception
However, if she draws with a
junior or a sophomore her as*
signment is to be made on the
basis of the lower number which
may place her in Lagunita.
Plan B provides: (1) Sopho
mores, juniors and seniors may
draw for any residence. <2) Each
residence will be filled first with
all seniors desiring to live thereâ€”
up to a maximum of two-thirds in
each house. (3) The residence
will then be filled with all juniors
desiring to live there, and the re
maining places will be filled with
sophomores.
Third Plan
Plan C calls for retention of
the present housing plan. This
reserves two-thirds of each house
for seniors and the remaining
third is divided between juniors
and sophomores on a two-to-one
basis favoring the juniors.
The voting will be preferential
with each woman selecting her
first, second and third choice.
The second part of the ballot
will contain alternatives on sev
eral other issues. Among those
will be a decision on how many
girls may draw together, the
placement of old girls returning
and the class status for drawing.
