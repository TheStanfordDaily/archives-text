# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## On the Recession 
### Walter Lippmann 
There is as yet no very general popular pres
sure for stronger measures to reflate the econ
omy than the measures which the Administration
is taking. It does not follow, however, that
stronger measures, such as a tax cut and larger
public works, should not be prepared and made
ready for early adoption. For the critical fact is
that in the business cycle remedies do not work
quickly. The sooner they are adopted—whether
on the upswing or on the downswing—the less
strong do they need to be.
It is evident enough today, for example, that
ill the upswing between 195;") and 1957 the au
thorities waited too long to check the inflationary
rise of consumer credit, capital expenditure, and
wage and price increases. 111 reverse, it is prob
able that we have already waited too long before
acting against the recession, which began last
summer. In fact, during the autumn, when the
slump was already evident, the Administration
was actually cutting down expenditures in the
Defense Department.
The moral of it is that public opinion is not a
sound guide in the management of the business
cycle. When the inflation of 1955-57 was under
way the politicians and the public resisted meas
ures to restrain credit and the rise of the wage
price structure. When the cycle turned after the
middle of 1957, the politicians and the public were
demanding retrenchment which would have been
very suitable 18 months earlier. Indeed, it may
be regarded as a working rule that for the suc
cessful management of the business cycle the
responsible authorities must be ahead of public
opinion and prepared to take measures which
cannot be popular until their delayed results are
experienced. The authorities must not wait to
be pushed, but they must lead the way—be it to
deflate a boom or to reflate a slump.
There are reasons for thinking, so it seems to
me, that we are at a point where a turn for the
worse is so distinct a possibility that it is the part
of wisdom and prudence to anticipate it. It may,
of course, be true —as Secretary Weeks and the
President hope and believe — that we have
reached the bottom, and that in a few months
the recovery will be under way. But it could be
true that we have not reached the hoftom of the
recession, and that if our policy is <0 wait and
see, we may be depressed to a deeper bottom
from which it will be still harder to rise.
Is this alarmist talk which undermines confi
dence? In the old days when banks were often
in trouble and faced with a run by their deposi
tors, the best way to stop the run was by such
;i powerful guarantee of the bank's solvency that
nobody wanted to draw out his money. The same
principle is applicable, it seems to me, to the
current phase of the recession. To say that pros

perity is just around the corner is less likely to
restore confidence than it would be if the Admin
istration and the Congress set in motion such
strong measures that confidence in the mainte
nance of employment and of profits is restored.
«
There are at least two reasons for thinking
that we may not be at tlie bottom of the recession.
For one, there is no good reason to suppose that
there will soon be a rise, instead of the present
decline, of what businessmen invest in plant and
equipment. Unless, however, there is a reason
ably prompt and substantial rise in private capi
tal expenditure, there is no good prospect of a
recovery without compensating outlays of public
capital in defense, public works, subsidized hous
ing and other facilities.
The second reason for being vigilant and alert
is there are many signs that as regards the de
pressed durable goods, the consuming public are
in a mood to save their money and to make do
with what they have, to scale down their debts,
to buy at second hand, and to keep their affairs
as liquid as possible. Why? Because they are
afraid of unemployment, of part-time unemploy
ment, of declines in retail purchases and profits.
There is a danger here, psychologically not unlike
the state of mind which used to lead to runs on
banks. "A decision." said Professor Slichter re
cently, "of consumers to cut their debts rapidly
could be dangerously deflationary."
This is a very vulnerable point, and a policy
of wait and see is dangerous. There is 110 use
preaching confidence; there is no nse expecting
a man to buy an automobile he does not have to
have, if he is worrying about whether he may
lose his job. What lie needs to restore his confi
dence is the sight of the Government preparing
to do as much as is needed, perhaps more than is
needed, to reflate the economy.
« #
In the debate about these matters, there is an
underlying issue of economic philosophy. There
are those who believe, with the classical econo
mists, that a recession is a necessary readjust
ment after an inflation of prices, wages and
debts. It is a painful readjustment. But it is
necessary to Ihe ultimate health of the economy.
On the other side, there are those who believe
—as does, for example, Marriner Eecles —that
humanly and politically it is impossible for a
modern democratic society to endure and to tol
erate the severe depression which would really
"readjust" wages, prices and debts.
They are. I believe, right; and it is better, as
Mr. Eccles .said, "to accept the present price, wage
and debt structure," to support it by a reflation,
than to take the enormous risks of a "readjust
ment" by a depression.

In the debate about these matters, there is an
underlying issue of economic philosophy. There
are those who believe, with the classical econo
mists, that a recession is a necessary readjust
ment after an inflation of prices, wages and
debts. It is a painful readjustment. But it is
necessary to Ihe ultimate health of the economy.
On the other side, there are those who believe
—as does, for example, Marriner Eecles —that
humanly and politically it is impossible for a
modern democratic society to endure and to tol
erate the severe depression which would really
"readjust" wages, prices and debts.
They are. I believe, right; and it is better, as
Mr. Eccles .said, "to accept the present price, wage
and debt structure," to support it by a reflation,
than to take the enormous risks of a "readjust
ment" by a depression.

There is as yet no very general popular pres
sure for stronger measures to reflate the econ
omy than the measures which the Administration
is taking. It does not follow, however, that
stronger measures, such as a tax cut and larger
public works, should not be prepared and made
ready for early adoption. For the critical fact is
that in the business cycle remedies do not work
quickly. The sooner they are adopted—whether
on the upswing or on the downswing—the less
strong do they need to be.
It is evident enough today, for example, that
ill the upswing between 195;") and 1957 the au
thorities waited too long to check the inflationary
rise of consumer credit, capital expenditure, and
wage and price increases. 111 reverse, it is prob
able that we have already waited too long before
acting against the recession, which began last
summer. In fact, during the autumn, when the
slump was already evident, the Administration
was actually cutting down expenditures in the
Defense Department.
The moral of it is that public opinion is not a
sound guide in the management of the business
cycle. When the inflation of 1955-57 was under
way the politicians and the public resisted meas
ures to restrain credit and the rise of the wage
price structure. When the cycle turned after the
middle of 1957, the politicians and the public were
demanding retrenchment which would have been
very suitable 18 months earlier. Indeed, it may
be regarded as a working rule that for the suc
cessful management of the business cycle the
responsible authorities must be ahead of public
opinion and prepared to take measures which
cannot be popular until their delayed results are
experienced. The authorities must not wait to
be pushed, but they must lead the way—be it to
deflate a boom or to reflate a slump.
There are reasons for thinking, so it seems to
me, that we are at a point where a turn for the
worse is so distinct a possibility that it is the part
of wisdom and prudence to anticipate it. It may,
of course, be true —as Secretary Weeks and the
President hope and believe — that we have
reached the bottom, and that in a few months
the recovery will be under way. But it could be
true that we have not reached the hoftom of the
recession, and that if our policy is <0 wait and
see, we may be depressed to a deeper bottom
from which it will be still harder to rise.
Is this alarmist talk which undermines confi
dence? In the old days when banks were often
in trouble and faced with a run by their deposi
tors, the best way to stop the run was by such
;i powerful guarantee of the bank's solvency that
nobody wanted to draw out his money. The same
principle is applicable, it seems to me, to the
current phase of the recession. To say that pros

perity is just around the corner is less likely to
restore confidence than it would be if the Admin
istration and the Congress set in motion such
strong measures that confidence in the mainte
nance of employment and of profits is restored.
«
There are at least two reasons for thinking
that we may not be at tlie bottom of the recession.
For one, there is no good reason to suppose that
there will soon be a rise, instead of the present
decline, of what businessmen invest in plant and
equipment. Unless, however, there is a reason
ably prompt and substantial rise in private capi
tal expenditure, there is no good prospect of a
recovery without compensating outlays of public
capital in defense, public works, subsidized hous
ing and other facilities.
The second reason for being vigilant and alert
is there are many signs that as regards the de
pressed durable goods, the consuming public are
in a mood to save their money and to make do
with what they have, to scale down their debts,
to buy at second hand, and to keep their affairs
as liquid as possible. Why? Because they are
afraid of unemployment, of part-time unemploy
ment, of declines in retail purchases and profits.
There is a danger here, psychologically not unlike
the state of mind which used to lead to runs on
banks. "A decision." said Professor Slichter re
cently, "of consumers to cut their debts rapidly
could be dangerously deflationary."
This is a very vulnerable point, and a policy
of wait and see is dangerous. There is 110 use
preaching confidence; there is no nse expecting
a man to buy an automobile he does not have to
have, if he is worrying about whether he may
lose his job. What lie needs to restore his confi
dence is the sight of the Government preparing
to do as much as is needed, perhaps more than is

tal expenditure, there is no good prospect of a
recovery without compensating outlays of public
capital in defense, public works, subsidized hous
ing and other facilities.
The second reason for being vigilant and alert
is there are many signs that as regards the de
pressed durable goods, the consuming public are
in a mood to save their money and to make do
with what they have, to scale down their debts,
to buy at second hand, and to keep their affairs
as liquid as possible. Why? Because they are
afraid of unemployment, of part-time unemploy
ment, of declines in retail purchases and profits.
There is a danger here, psychologically not unlike
the state of mind which used to lead to runs on
banks. "A decision." said Professor Slichter re
cently, "of consumers to cut their debts rapidly
could be dangerously deflationary."
This is a very vulnerable point, and a policy
of wait and see is dangerous. There is 110 use
preaching confidence; there is no nse expecting
a man to buy an automobile he does not have to
have, if he is worrying about whether he may
lose his job. What lie needs to restore his confi
dence is the sight of the Government preparing
to do as much as is needed, perhaps more than is
needed, to reflate the economy.

In the debate about these matters, there is an
underlying issue of economic philosophy. There
are those who believe, with the classical econo
mists, that a recession is a necessary readjust
ment after an inflation of prices, wages and
debts. It is a painful readjustment. But it is
necessary to Ihe ultimate health of the economy.
On the other side, there are those who believe
—as does, for example, Marriner Eecles —that
humanly and politically it is impossible for a
modern democratic society to endure and to tol
erate the severe depression which would really
"readjust" wages, prices and debts.
They are. I believe, right; and it is better, as
Mr. Eccles .said, "to accept the present price, wage
and debt structure," to support it by a reflation,
than to take the enormous risks of a "readjust
ment" by a depression.

There is as yet no very general popular pres
sure for stronger measures to reflate the econ
omy than the measures which the Administration
is taking. It does not follow, however, that
stronger measures, such as a tax cut and larger
public works, should not be prepared and made
ready for early adoption. For the critical fact is
that in the business cycle remedies do not work
quickly. The sooner they are adopted—whether
on the upswing or on the downswing—the less
strong do they need to be.
It is evident enough today, for example, that
ill the upswing between 195;") and 1957 the au
thorities waited too long to check the inflationary
rise of consumer credit, capital expenditure, and
wage and price increases. 111 reverse, it is prob
able that we have already waited too long before
acting against the recession, which began last
summer. In fact, during the autumn, when the
slump was already evident, the Administration
was actually cutting down expenditures in the
Defense Department.
The moral of it is that public opinion is not a
sound guide in the management of the business
cycle. When the inflation of 1955-57 was under
way the politicians and the public resisted meas
ures to restrain credit and the rise of the wage
price structure. When the cycle turned after the
middle of 1957, the politicians and the public were
demanding retrenchment which would have been
very suitable 18 months earlier. Indeed, it may
be regarded as a working rule that for the suc
cessful management of the business cycle the
responsible authorities must be ahead of public
opinion and prepared to take measures which
cannot be popular until their delayed results are
experienced. The authorities must not wait to
be pushed, but they must lead the way—be it to
deflate a boom or to reflate a slump.
There are reasons for thinking, so it seems to
me, that we are at a point where a turn for the
worse is so distinct a possibility that it is the part
of wisdom and prudence to anticipate it. It may,
of course, be true —as Secretary Weeks and the
President hope and believe — that we have
reached the bottom, and that in a few months
the recovery will be under way. But it could be
true that we have not reached the hoftom of the
recession, and that if our policy is <0 wait and
see, we may be depressed to a deeper bottom
from which it will be still harder to rise.
Is this alarmist talk which undermines confi
dence? In the old days when banks were often
in trouble and faced with a run by their deposi
tors, the best way to stop the run was by such
;i powerful guarantee of the bank's solvency that
nobody wanted to draw out his money. The same
principle is applicable, it seems to me, to the
current phase of the recession. To say that pros

perity is just around the corner is less likely to
restore confidence than it would be if the Admin
istration and the Congress set in motion such
strong measures that confidence in the mainte
nance of employment and of profits is restored.

there will soon be a rise, instead of the present
