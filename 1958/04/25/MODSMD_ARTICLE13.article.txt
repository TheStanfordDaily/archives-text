Editor, The Daily:
April 24 brought a persona] ehallenge from two
inferior peddlers of Con Home "Trike Race" no
toriety. This is a notice that I accept their chal

Trike races are hard enough to run and virtu
ally impossible to re-run (especially according to

the specifications of cranks). T am unschooled in
