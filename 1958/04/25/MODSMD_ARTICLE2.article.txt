## Cards Meet Cal, UCLA In 3 Games 
### 
It's another do-or-die weekend
in Stanford baseball as the In
dians travel to Cal for a single
game today at 3:15 and return
home to meet UCLA in a double
header tomorrow at 1 p.m.
Dutch Fehring's nine finds it- i
self in Ihe position of having to!
win at least two of the three I
games, and preferably all three, -
if it expects to retain title hopes :
in the CIBA pennant race.
Going into the heavy weekend
schedule, the Indians are in sec- I
place with a \-2 mark, l'L- games i
behind the league - leading (JSC
Trojans.
If Stanford can win three while
Troy remains idle, the Cards
would find themselves a game
ahead of USC in the win column
and one bhind on the loss side.
One loss and the Tribe would
be two games behind in the vital
loss column. Two defeats, and
Stanford can virtually forget any
hopes of winning the flag.
Nothing 1 Easy
Although the Indians are ahead
of Cal and UCLA in the pennant
drive, there's no reason to sus

games will be easy.
California has improved great
ly in the past week and one-half,
even to the extent of gaining a
victory over the Trojans in the
first game of a double-header last
week on the losers' home
grounds.
The Saturday twin bill will be |
rough for two reasons—the Bru-1
ins are strong, and the Stanford
pitching staff will be taxed to
the utmost by the three games in
two days.
Fehring's plans call for George |
Avery to face California today, |
with southpaws Bob Leopold and
Dick Williams on the mound
against UCLA.
Falk for Cal
Stanford will face left-hander
Ted Falk today at Edwards Field.
Falk appears to be the only Bear
hurler who can go nine innings. <
He's done it twice in compiling a
3-1 record, while no other Cal
pitcher has gone the distance.
Avery has chalked up a 4-1 rec- J
ord this year, and has an excel-:
lent 1.84 ERA. In his last two j
