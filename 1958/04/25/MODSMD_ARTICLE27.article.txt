# UCLA Picked by 20 in Track Meet Saturday
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
UCLA is favored to win by about 20 points, but Stanford should
still turn in some good track performances when the two teams clash
on the Stadium oval tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
Payton Jordan's Indians would have to come through with surprise
showings in ihe sprints and jumping events to have any chance to

upset thp Bruins. And, of course,
the Indians will have to pick up
at least 24 points in thrHSO, mile
and two-mile.
Any sort of performance simi
lar to last week's at Occidental
will insure about a 30-point loss
for the Cards. Everyone except
Norm Lloyd, Chuck Cobb and
Jerry Winters failed to come
through, and so Oxy won easily.
Lloyd in Long: Races
Payton Jordan will do a bit of
juggling for tomorrow's moot,
the principal move involving
Lloyd. After three weeks of run
ning the S80 and mile, Lloyd will
move up to the mile and two-mile.
Ile'll more than likely go for as
easy a victory as possible in the
four-lappcr to save his strength
for the longer race. No other mil
er on either team is much under
4:20, so it's likely that Lloyd
won't have to come up with any
thing near his best of 4:06 to
win the race.
Since the two-mile is run only
a few minutes before the relay,
Lloyd won't be in the baton event.
His spot will he taken by sopho
more broad jumper John Kelly,
who will run the first leg.

Stanford plans hope for Lloyd
and Doug Martin to run 1-2 in
the mile. Martin has recently re
covered from an attack of mono
nucleosis, but appears ready to
give Ken Riding of UCLA a good
run for second.
Lloyd and Maury Graves
shouldn't have much trouble tak
ing the first two spots in the two
mile. Ernie Cunliffe and Dick
Lassen will have a bit tougher
time, but should get 1-2 in the
880.
From there on, Stanford will
have a much rougher time get
ting points. Dean Smith and
Norm Pease will have to be at
their best to get sprint points
from Dave James, Rich Johnson
and Stan King.
Little Chance in 440
Stanford has little chance to
crack into the strength of King
and Doug Juuian in the 440. Cobb
should win both hurdles races,
but Ihe Bruins look safe for the
place and show points.
UCLA's strength really shows
in the weights. Rafer Johonson
is outstanding in all three, and
Duane Milleman is sharp in the
discus and shot. Winters, with a
probable third in the shot, will
more than likely get the only
Stanford point in these events.
Steve Coughlin, Kent Hansen,
John Kelly and Mike Franchetti
are the Indians who'll have to be
at a competitive peak in the jump
ing events to give Stanford any
help.
Eight Records Endangered
Eight of the 15 meet records
are in reasonable danger, with
those in the 880. two - mile and
pole vault most vulnerable.
Cunliffe has been under Bob
Seaman's 1:52.4 in his last three
races. Graves has been more
than 10 seconds under his own
mark of 9:15.4, and Lloyd should
also be able to better that stand
ard in the eight-lapper.
Lloyd could also get Seaman's
4:10.7 in the mile, but he'll prob
ably win eased-up instead of mak
ing a try for the record. Cobb,
who has run 13.9, should at least
equal Craig Dixon's 14.1 in the
highs.
Bruins will take cracks at meet
marks in the discus, javelin, high
jump and pole vault. George
Roubanis is practically a cinch to
beat the pole vault mark of 14-
1 1/16, since he's already done
15-% this year.
