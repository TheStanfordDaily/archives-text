# Stanford Crew Travels For Races With Beavers
## 
### 
Three Stanford crews leave to
day for Corvallis, Ore., where
they will meet Oregon State in
races Saturday on the Willamette
River. The Indian oarsmen will
race the Beavers at slightly under
2000 meters.
Oregon State will be after re
venge for the loss it suffered at
the hands of Stanford April 5 in
Redwood City Yacht Harbor. The
Cards finished second in that
race behind USC, but thumped
the Beavers by 2 I A lengths.
Oregon State, however, will
have a bit of a home course ad
vantage. Most of the Indians
have never rowed on a river
course such as the Willamette.
To add to the strangeness of the
situation, the race will be rowed
upstream, against the current.
Freshman coach Phil Waters
is pessimistic about the chances
of his crew. He says that the per
formance against USC three
weeks ago was "just lucky." The
showing belied time trials and
workouts, which weren't too good
from the frosh standpoint.
The varsity team, from stroke
to bow, will consist of Chuck
Brothers, Bob Clark, John Reich-

Mann, Mike Graf, Roald Enge
breth, Dick Draeger, Scott Moore
and Paul Dougan. Randy Jones
will cox.
The JV's will use Rolf Peter
son, Jamie Clever, John Brewer,
George Beardsley, Dave Jung,
Kirk Beales, Dick Van Slyke,
Hans von Briesen and coxswain
Carl Ulrich.
The frosh will take Bob Sama
da, Lyle Laffranchini, Scott Dan
ielson, Gary Dorn, Jim Gerwick,
Bruce Arnold, Chuck Atcheson,
Jon Huber and cox Roger Moore
north for the race.
