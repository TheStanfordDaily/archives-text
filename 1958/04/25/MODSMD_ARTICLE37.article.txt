# TRIBE SHOULD WIN
## Swimmers Face Cat At Berkeley Pool 
### Alan Miller 
Varsity swimmers will head
across the bay tomorrow morn
ing to battle arch-rival California
in what looks like an easy Stan
ford victory.
This, the first in a series of two
meets to be held between the
schools this season, should be
thrill packed as are all Stanford-
Cal contests. The second meet
will be held here May 16.
"The boys are in top shape,"
commented Indian mentor Tom
Haynie. "We should win this one
without any trouble."
No Depth
Coach George Schroth's Cal
men may supply some formidable
opposition in several events, but
the Bears don't possess enough

depth to make the score close.
Chuck Halbway boasts a 2:3-1.2
in the 200 breaststroke which
may give Indians Gary Weaver
and Bill Fuller a run for their
money. He also swims a 2:32.0
200 butterfly which may cause
Tim Timkin to pour on a little
extra steam.
Terry Tognazzini will probably
pull the only victory for the Bears
in the 200 backstroke, having
posted a 2:14.4. This should be
just a little too much for Stan
ford's Wayne Mehl or Bruce
Hamilton.
Stanford All â€¢ American Robin
Moore, college record holder in
the 100-yard freestyle with a time
of 49.8, can swim anything, but
will probably enter the 220- and
400-yard freestyle contests.
Freestyle Favorites
Denny Stinson and Tom Fetor
son will churn up the 50 free for
Stanford and should have little
worry about Kirk Bathgate who
has cut his time to 24.0, slill a
second short of the Indian's
marks. Bathgate may cause a
little trouble to Jim Muir in the
100 free.
Stanford diver Bob Kahn
should take top spot over Bears
Paul Goo.jian and Bob McCarty,
who haven't been doing too well
this season.
Stanford's medley and freestyle
relay teams should also win.
