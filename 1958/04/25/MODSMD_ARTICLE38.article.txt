# Bearcubs Host Frosh Mermen
## 
### 
Frosh mermen will face the
Cal Cubs at Berkeley tomorrow
morning. Sparked by champion
George Harrison and a relay
squad that just broke the Na
tional Collegiate record, the Pa
pooses should pull an easy vic
tory.
Today at 3:30 in the local pool
the frosh take on San Leandro
and Hayward high schools in a
three - way meet which should
again prove a Stanford victory.
Yesterday the Papooses
smashed Vallejo JC 50-17 in the
local pool. Mike Zeller shone with
a 2:11.0 220 freestyle finish.
