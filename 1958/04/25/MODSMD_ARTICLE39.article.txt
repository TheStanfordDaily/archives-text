# KZSU Rebroadcasts FM In All-Day Programming
## 
### Lynne Beaulac 
Music, educational programs
and features for all Stanford stu
dents, from 9 a.m. till midnight
every day, provide the l'onnula
for University-sponsored radio
station KZSU, with the help of a
working agreement with a com
mercial station.
Combining its own talents with
the rebroadcasts of popular FM

station KPFA, the "Voice of Stan
ford" now comes on the air at 9
every morning.
The morning broadcast is from
KPFA and continues into the mid
afternoon, with KZSU programs
starting at 3 p.m. weekdays and
4 p.m. Sundays. For spring quar
ter KZSU interrupts the FM
broadcasts on Tuesdays and Sat
urdays for the University base
ball games.
KPFA, a subscriber station in
Berkeley, offers a variety of pro
grams with special appeal to lov
ers of classical music and litera
ture. To those interested in world
affairs, commentaries on today's
news and reports of travel in for
eign countries appeal.
Just recently KZSU had to dis
continue the rebroadcasts of pro
grams from KPEN. This station,
an Atherton FM station, formerly
was heard on the 880 dial spot
from midnight to when the KPFA
broadcasts commenced in the
morning. Two Stanford students
started the station on a 24-hour
basis, but recently went on their
current day-only schedule.
The process of broadcasting FM

programs over the AM frequency
of KZSU involves only the lower
ing of the FM frequency to AM.
KZSU receives the regular audio
signals of KPFA over an FM re
ceiver and then modulates the sig
nals 'to AM frequency.
Differing from other AM sta
tions, KZSU has no antenna. In
stead, it broadcasts through a sys
tem of transmitters and power
lines. KZSU's original signal is
sent through wires resembling
those of telephones to four trans
i mitters located in Toyon. Lagu
nita, Wilbur and Florence Moore.
: These transmitters then feed the
signal through power lines to the
i dormitories.
At present no power lines ex
! tend to the How. Its only recep
tion comes from signals off the
other power lines. Before the end
of this quarter KZSU hopes to
install a new transmitter in Union
and the Row.
KZSU is the largest commercial
college station on the West Coast
| and is operated completely under
student direction and self-support
ed by its advertising. Students
write, produce, engineer and pre
sent all programs.
KZSU invites prospective staff
members and anyone else inter
ested in the operation of a radio
station to attend the new training
and orientation program every
Sunday at 2 p.m. in room 204,
Memorial Auditorium.


John llinners, above, has been
elected station manager of
KZSU for the coining year.
Other election results are Bill
De Arinond, program manager,
and John Hay, business mana
ger. A run-off election will be
conductcd iVI ond a y between
Mike Chainbreau and ISill Fin*
ler for chief engineer.

Berkeley, offers a variety of pro
grams with special appeal to lov
ers of classical music and litera
ture. To those interested in world
affairs, commentaries on today's
news and reports of travel in for

Just recently KZSU had to dis
continue the rebroadcasts of pro
grams from KPEN. This station,
an Atherton FM station, formerly
was heard on the 880 dial spot
from midnight to when the KPFA
broadcasts commenced in the
morning. Two Stanford students
started the station on a 24-hour
basis, but recently went on their
current day-only schedule.
The process of broadcasting FM

programs over the AM frequency
of KZSU involves only the lower
ing of the FM frequency to AM.
KZSU receives the regular audio
signals of KPFA over an FM re
ceiver and then modulates the sig
nals 'to AM frequency.
Differing from other AM sta
tions, KZSU has no antenna. In
stead, it broadcasts through a sys
tem of transmitters and power
lines. KZSU's original signal is
sent through wires resembling
those of telephones to four trans
i mitters located in Toyon. Lagu
nita, Wilbur and Florence Moore.
: These transmitters then feed the
signal through power lines to the
i dormitories.
At present no power lines ex
! tend to the How. Its only recep
tion comes from signals off the
other power lines. Before the end
of this quarter KZSU hopes to
install a new transmitter in Union
and the Row.
KZSU is the largest commercial
college station on the West Coast
| and is operated completely under
student direction and self-support
ed by its advertising. Students
write, produce, engineer and pre
sent all programs.
KZSU invites prospective staff
members and anyone else inter
ested in the operation of a radio
station to attend the new training
and orientation program every
Sunday at 2 p.m. in room 204,
Memorial Auditorium.
