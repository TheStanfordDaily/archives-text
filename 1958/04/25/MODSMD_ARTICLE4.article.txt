# Con Home Festivities Open Today for Nine-Day Drive
## 
### Jack Winkler 
It starts today nine days of so
licitations, movies, tournaments,
car washes, strawberry shortcake
and contests, ending up with the
gala carnival at Mama Garcia's
next Friday—all to raise money
for the Convalescent Home.
Six hundred and twenty fresh
men start the drive going tonight
when they begin canvassing the
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Ather
ton areas for off-campus contribu
tions.
This is the biggest group of so
licitors in recent years, a 7 per
cent increase over last year and
almost double the number of sev
eral years before.
Looks Hopeful
"We are very enthusiastic about
the response," said Con Home
Week co-chairmen Jane Fetter
and Kent Kaiser, "and we are
hopeful about reaching the $12.-
000 goal."
Nominations for king and queen
contest officially open today, but
an interesting mixture of candi
dal cs has already managed to
sneak in petitions a Husky, a
parrot, "Bodyman" Weaver and
"Sapphire Sehmook."
Balloting begins Tuesday at a
penny a vote, and stuffing the
election box is definitely encour
aged.
Sunday "Curse"
On Sunday comes Iho Con
Home Flick in Memorial Audilo
rium, and it's right in ihe spirit
of the drive. There's a 50-cent ad
mission charge for "The Curse of
Frankenstein," but it may pur
chase a lot more than a movie.
There's a good chance that the
silence and water-bomb prohibi
tions may be lifted, and Franken
stein may lake a second place in
the excitement.
There will be more water than
water bombs on Sunday that's
also the day for the jousting con
test at 1:30 p.m. at Lake Lagu
nita. All comers are welcome.
.Mania's Carnival
The climax to the drive's events
will be the biggest festival of
them all next Friday afternoon
the carnival, with contests, slave
sales, rat races, pie throws, water
flunking, and beer and pretzels at
Mama Garcia's on Alpine Road.
There are still a few booth
spaces available, and living
groups interested in running a
concession may call Karon War
ner at Laguniia or John Bassett
at Beta Thcta Pi.

On Sunday comes Iho Con
Home Flick in Memorial Audilo
rium, and it's right in ihe spirit
of the drive. There's a 50-cent ad
mission charge for "The Curse of
Frankenstein," but it may pur
chase a lot more than a movie.
There's a good chance that the
silence and water-bomb prohibi
tions may be lifted, and Franken
stein may lake a second place in
the excitement.
There will be more water than
water bombs on Sunday that's
also the day for the jousting con
test at 1:30 p.m. at Lake Lagu
nita. All comers are welcome.
.Mania's Carnival
The climax to the drive's events
will be the biggest festival of
them all next Friday afternoon
the carnival, with contests, slave
sales, rat races, pie throws, water
flunking, and beer and pretzels at
Mama Garcia's on Alpine Road.
There are still a few booth
spaces available, and living
groups interested in running a
concession may call Karon War
ner at Laguniia or John Bassett
at Beta Thcta Pi.

To Be Honored
It starts today nine days of so
licitations, movies, tournaments,
car washes, strawberry shortcake
and contests, ending up with the
gala carnival at Mama Garcia's
next Friday—all to raise money
for the Convalescent Home.
Six hundred and twenty fresh
men start the drive going tonight
when they begin canvassing the
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Ather
ton areas for off-campus contribu
tions.
This is the biggest group of so
licitors in recent years, a 7 per
cent increase over last year and
almost double the number of sev
eral years before.
Looks Hopeful
"We are very enthusiastic about
the response," said Con Home
Week co-chairmen Jane Fetter
and Kent Kaiser, "and we are
hopeful about reaching the $12.-
000 goal."
Nominations for king and queen
contest officially open today, but
an interesting mixture of candi
dal cs has already managed to
sneak in petitions a Husky, a
parrot, "Bodyman" Weaver and
"Sapphire Sehmook."
Balloting begins Tuesday at a
penny a vote, and stuffing the
election box is definitely encour
aged.
