# Operas Praised Despite Flaws
## 
### Michael Collins 
Gian Carlo Mcnotti's lyric Kills, theatrical talents ami instinct for
uniting words and music are evident in the artful combination of
the contrapuntal textures of the sixteenth century madrigal and tart,
"The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the M&ntieore," which was given a
brilliant performance at Dinkelspiel Hall on Wednesday evening.
The subject of the fable is the artist's dream, what it,means to
him and what it means to his imitators. This is depicted effectively
through sighl and sound.
The excellent choreography of Jenny Hunter was at its best when
miming the text, as exhibited in the outstanding tension and control
of Miss Hunter and Lair Parent in the principal roles. What William
Davis as the poet lacked in tension, he made up in his appealing ap
pearance and attractive languor, especially in the dance with the
Unicorn, superbly done by John Graham.
The clear projection of the complicated musical texture by the
chorus was a tribute to its director, Harold Schmidt. One could have
wished only for a clearer projection of the text. The production was
beautifully co-ordinated by the masterful conducting of Sandor Salgo.
The costume design was excellent, as were the lighting effects of
Frederick Rider.
The froihy eighteenth century farce. "Thomas and Sally," came
off less well, the lack of adequate rehearsal evident throughout.
However, the singing and characterization of Fdwin Dunning as the
foppish squire could not have been more polished and refined. Donna
Peterson was also fine vocally and visually. Marilyn Poppino as
Sally was not as secure in her role though she sang charmingly.
Byron Me.llberg as Thomas sang adequately but without conviction.
The less said of the chorus and dancers the better. Worthy of
note was the realization of the eontinuo by harpsichordist Putnam
Aldrich. Sandor Salgo conducted with vigor. In spite of its uneven
ness, the performance had great charm and will no doubt improve
in the Friday and Saturday performances.
