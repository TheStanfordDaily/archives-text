Special to I'lie Daily
Stanford students representing
the United States won important
diplomatic victories yesterday at
committee sessions of the Model
United Nations in Seattle, Wash.
The Security Council passed a
U.S. resolution calling for the use
of a UN police force to stop armed
clashes between India and Paki
stan along the Kashmir border.
Russia had initially vetoed the
resolution. When the Russian del
egate left the Council chambers
shortly afterward, U.S. delegate
Steve Brcyer called for a re-vote,
which passed the measure.
In a close 4-to-3 vote, the Inter
national Court of Justice ruled
that the United States is not dis
criminating against Russian ship
ping Through the Panama Canal.
The Court unanimously decided,
in another case, that Russia had
violated international law by clos
ing the Bay of Vladivostok to in
ternational shipping. Mike Wil
lemsen and John Jordan had ar
gued the case for the U.S.
The Political and Security Coun
cil and the Economic and Social
Council passed resolutions spon
sored by the U.S. delegation.
These and all other resolutions
passed by committees will he vot
ed upon by the General Assembly
of the Model UN meeting in ple
nary session tonight.
