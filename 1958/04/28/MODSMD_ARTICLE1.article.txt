An unexpected invasion caused much consterna
tion among the languid sunbathers at Lake La
gunita Friday. The fun began when 15 members
of Phi Kappa Sigma launched their bright red,
2'/i-ton fishing boat, the "Aquawazoo" (pictured
above), on the lake and rowed the leaky craft
toward the boat dock. Using a loudspeaker sys
tem aboard ship, the "pirates" startled sunbath
ers with a cry of "Prepare the water bombs!"
The sun worshipers suddenly found themselves
dodging water-filled balloons?. Undaunted, the

landlubbers organized a counterattack. A*"i'ew
cans of red paint were hur]ed at the ship and a
rowboat with a boarding party was sent out.
The landing party, however, was turned back
when their vessel sank due to an overload of
water bombs. Then the tide turned. The "Aqua
wazoo" began to sink and the frantic pirates
could not keep the pumps going. It was finally
towed to shore by a few of the damper pirates
who joined their Phi Kap brothers in a hasty
retreat.
