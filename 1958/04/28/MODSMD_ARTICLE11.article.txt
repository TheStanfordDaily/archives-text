# $80,000 Exchange Begins Operations
## New Phone Plant Starts Work Today 
### John McCaslin 
Stanford's now $80,000 trie
phone exchange system begins
service for the first time at 8 this
morning. The new building and
equipment replace the antiquated
and badly - crowded telephone
room located in the Business
School building.
The new concrete structure, lo
cated across Panama Street from
the Cellar, has been designed in
keeping with Stanford's architec
tural tradition of sandstone - col
ored walls and red-tiled roofs.
Most of the usable space is
given to a sub-cellar, which con
tains the switchroom and tele
phone equipment. A five-opera
tor switchboard occupies the
ground floor, and an adjacent
lounge opens onto a small terrace.
More Floor Space
The new building contains 2630
square feet of floor space as com
pared with the 500 square feet of
the present facilities. The new
.switchboard is wired to reach 686
extensions instead of the 425
which could be served previously.
According to Lawrence Ed
wards, Pacific Telephone and Tel
egraph Company official, the in
creased floor space of the new
building will allow expansion of
the present facilities to over 4000
extensions. At present there are
1513 telephones in operations on
the campus, including those in
the dormitories.
Takes Over DA 3-9411
For the time being the new ex
change will be limited to serving
those telephones previously han
dled by the Business School ex
change. These include extensions
in academic, administrative and
service offices now operating
from the general University num
ber, DA 3-9411.
In addition, telephones in the
Hansen Physics Laboratory and a
few other outlying offices now
serviced by outside lines have
been included in the local ex
change. Hours of service will re
main the same as before: 8 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. weekdays and 8 a.m.
to 12:30 p.m. Saturdays.
Future plans include extending
service to the .Ryan High Voltage
Laboratory.

$80,000 TELEPHONE EXCHANGE OPENS TODAY
New building located across from Cellar
Stanford's now $80,000 trie
phone exchange system begins
service for the first time at 8 this
morning. The new building and
equipment replace the antiquated
and badly - crowded telephone
room located in the Business
School building.
The new concrete structure, lo
cated across Panama Street from
the Cellar, has been designed in
keeping with Stanford's architec
tural tradition of sandstone - col
ored walls and red-tiled roofs.
Most of the usable space is
given to a sub-cellar, which con
tains the switchroom and tele
phone equipment. A five-opera
tor switchboard occupies the
ground floor, and an adjacent
lounge opens onto a small terrace.
More Floor Space
The new building contains 2630
square feet of floor space as com
pared with the 500 square feet of
the present facilities. The new
.switchboard is wired to reach 686
extensions instead of the 425
which could be served previously.
According to Lawrence Ed
wards, Pacific Telephone and Tel
egraph Company official, the in
creased floor space of the new
building will allow expansion of
the present facilities to over 4000
extensions. At present there are
1513 telephones in operations on
the campus, including those in
the dormitories.
