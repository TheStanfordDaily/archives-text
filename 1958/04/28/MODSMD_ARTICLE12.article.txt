# PRAVDA ANNOUNCEMENT
## Russ Will Orbit Animal Return It Alive to Earth 
### 
MOSCOW (/P)—Russia's space dog Laika failed to do a complete
job and so Soviet scientists will shoot more animals into space and
bring them back dead or alive, Pravda said yesterday.
Laika's living week in the Russian Sputnik II did not provide
enough information on space and she gave no definite clues on the ef-

fects of cosmic radiation, the
Communist Party organ said.
"It will be necessary to make a
long and careful examination of
an animal after the flight to ob
tain such information," it said.
Laika's body was lost when Sput
nik II fell from space two weeks
ago.
But Laika was not written off
as a complete failure. Pravda
said the scientists learned Laika's
condition in the Sputnik was sat
isfactory. There was an increase
in her heartbeat and breathing as
the rocket zoomed out into space
but they returned to normal later.
At no time did she suffer any
pain, it said. The Russians pre
viously announced she died when
her oxygen ran out.
The experiment was made to
learn from the dog how a ride
into space might affect a human.
Since Laika's launching on Nov.
3, speculation has waxed and
waned that the Hussions were
about to stage another bold ex
periment in space. Most authori
ties here have clearly indicated
the Soviet Union is not interested
merely in repeating previous
achiexements and that the next
experiment would open a new
page in space exploration.
