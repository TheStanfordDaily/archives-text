# Red Scientists Praise Visits On Trip Here
## 
### 
The increasing number of ex
change visits by Russian and
American scientists to each oth
er's countries is good for interna
tional relations, said Professors
V. V. Sokolovsky and O. D. Oni
oshvilli, Russian scientists on
tour of this country, when they
were on campus Friday.
They are visiting this country
as guests of the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences, and are vis
iting three Americans who will
go to Russia soon as guests of
that country's National Academy
of Sciences.
The biggest difference they
noted between educational sys
tems in Russia and America was
in organization. In the Soviet
Union, thoy said, engineering
schools are not associated with
universities but are separate in
stitutes. The Russian Academy
of Sciences operates such insti
tutes all over the country and its
American counterpart does not,
thoy noted.
In answer to a question, Pro
lessor OnioshviLli said he believed
there was an increasing interest
on the part of Americans in re
search done in the Soviet Union.
The Russians on the other hand
have "systematically received and
studied" American publications
for some time. The Soviets sub
scribe to most of the important
U.S. publications, he said, in both
technical and non-technical fields.
