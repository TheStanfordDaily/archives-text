# WEEKEND BASEBALL
## Tribe Wins, Loses, Ties In UCLA, Bear Contests 
### 
Stanford played three baseball games Friday and Saturday, and
came out with as even a record as possible—one win, one loss and
one tie.
Dutch P'ehring's club had to wait until the second game of the
Saturday double-header with UCLA before gaining the victory. But

when it came, it came big as A 1
Shaw hit two home runs out of
the Sunken Diamond in an 11-3
rout of the Bruins.
Best game of the week end was
Friday's 1-1 tie with California at
Edwards Field. Bob Leopold and
thi-ee Bear hurlers dueled their
way through 13 innings of crisis
filled baseball before the game
was called due to darkness.
The Stanford loss came in the
first game of the double-header,
when UCLA and Kirk Wilson
handled the Cards 4-1.
The Cal game was filled with
one scoring situation after an
other, but nearly always the re
spective hurlers bore down to
quell the threat.
Run in First
Stanford scored its run in the
first on walks to Jim Burk and
Harry Rodda, an error, a fielder's
choice and a walk to Rich De-
Fa bio which forced in Rodda.
Leopold went along in good
shape until the eighth, when two
hits, a sacrifice and a fielder's
choice combined to give Cal the
tying run.
The Bears, who had left 13 men
stranded in the first eight in
nings, looked like sure winners
in the bottom of the 10th when
John Balaam singled and Mike
White followed with another one
baser after faking a sacrifice
this with no one out.
But Leopold bore down to strike
out the next Iwo hitters and got
Roger Gregg to end the inning
with a ground-out.
Steals Fail
Cal literally tried to steal the
game in the last of the 13th. By
I that time it was so dark that it
was nearly impossible to see the
right-fielder from behind third
I base. The strategy didn't work,
however, as Gregg was out steal
ing home and A 1 Piper ended the
game by being thrown out in an
attempted swipe of second.
Piper also put Dwight out for
two weeks or so when he spiked
