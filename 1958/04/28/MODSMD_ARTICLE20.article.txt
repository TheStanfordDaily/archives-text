### Rita Robison 
The following poem is taken from the Antioch
College Record, University of Akron, Ohio. Does
it describe you?
I am the very model of a modern intellectual;
I know the ruddy answers though I'm rather in
effectual.
I'm more sophisticated, son, than people clad in
denim are:
When I have nothing much to say, I say it in a
seminar.
1 know which books are best to read, which sym
phonies are better, ah,
I'm very well informed upon aesthetics and et
cetera.
I know a thing or two about the sciences beha
vioral—
The which to foster, fellows stout, you sacrificed
and gave your all;
I know about relations, poor, platonical and sex
ual—
In short, I am the model of a modern intellectual.
I flatter me that I know freedom from responsi
bility—
My fellowship maintains me in respectable gen
tility;
My coffee-steeped opinions have remarkable fe
licity;
My knowledge is distinguished for its very catho
licity.
I'm right on top of inside dope on Little Rock and
satellites,
On horseshoe pitching, Dead Sea scrolls, and even
western cattle rights,
Or how to tune a motor and on how to make a
Chevy sing—
I think I ought to organize a seminar on EVERY
THING!
My friends are IBM machines, my methods are
statistical;
My just reflections on myself are somewhat nar
cissistical;

And though my lucubrations may be mostly in
effectual,
I am the very model of a modern intellectual.

I-lere's a poem accredited to Hugh TTaynie, and
it appeared in the Greensboro Daily News:
One day as 1 sat musing,
Sad and lonely without a friend,
A voice came to me from out of the gloom
Saying, "Cheer up, things could be worse."
So I cheered up and, sure enough,
Things got worse.
You just can't win all the time.

Here's a surprising (maybe not) comment from
the UCLA campus: "We believe there should be
a more liberal administration and student govern
ment at UCLA. However, we also feel that UCLA
should be allowed to develop to the point that
there is no longer any reason to feel overcome
and hampered by Berkeley, and that Berkeley
should lose its mother-complex toward UCLA."
That's a right nice thought.

The following acid comments appeared in the
Rocky Mountain Collegian, Fort Collins, Colo,
(the poison pen belongs to Hilary St. John):
"Periodically throughout the school year one
hears talk about how this or that organization is
going to curtail indiscriminate necking on campus
or in front of the residences. Despite all this
fervor, nothing is ever done to halt this shameless
display of public immorality which is so evident
on this campus. For college studenfs to flaunt
their lack of a Christian heritage in parked cars
on street corners, and even in the Student Union,
is to behave in a manner so inconsiderate as to be
almost unpardonable.
"A«ide from endangering society by spreading
diseases, this disgusting behavior may lead to a
tearing down of the nation's entire structure of
decency."
Seems Hilary is assuming that a little loving
goes a long, long way.
