Editor, The Daily:
During the recent flood emergency which im-

periled areas of the City of Palo Alto, many of
the University men responded to our calls for
volunteer assistance.
These students, working with city crews and
olher volunteers, carried out the heavy work
of sandbagging Iho levees of San Francisquito
Creek and other streams, thereby averting se
rious flooding of several residential neighbor
hoods.
In behalf of the people of Palo Alto and the
members of the City Council, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank the students and the
administration of the University for this great
community service.
