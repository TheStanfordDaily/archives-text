ThanLs for Coverage
Editor, The Daily:
Many thanks to you for the excellent coverage The Daily gave
the protest demonstration on Thursday. All of us on the education
committee (those who researched and wrote the literature distrib
uted at the protest) were especially happy to see the series Roger
Folsom wrote and the top front-page coverage we received Thursday
and Friday. The Daily played a major part in establishing the tone
and spirit that we wanted the demonstration to achieve.
One of the finest things I've ever read in The Daily was your
editorial Thursday morning. It was a beautifully written piece, and
all of us were proud that such expression joined the first student
movement on this campus in years.
Once again may I thank you, on behalf of all the committee, and
hope Willi them that our mutual interests continue in the future.

There are not more than 12 single rooms in Florence Moore.
There are no single rooms on the Row. The recently proposed
housing plan does not allow senior women to live in Lagunita, where
a few single rooms are available. This means that the only place
where a senior woman will be able to have a private room is in Union.
According to present University housing plans, Union will be
destroyed within !he next two years. Many women students, espe
cially tho-se in upper division, find quiet and privacy essential to
serious study.
There are two possible solutions to the problem implied above:
new dormitories with single-room facilities (which members of the
Administration have told us are impossible to finance), or a change
of the Administration's policy regarding women's housing to the
realistic position of allowing upper-classwomen with parental consent
to find living accommodations suitable to their needs—on or off
campus.
