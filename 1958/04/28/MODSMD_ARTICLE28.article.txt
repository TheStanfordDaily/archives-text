# Johnson Stars in Bruin Track Win
## 
### 
Rafer Johnson won three field events and six meet records were
equaled or bettered as UCLA easily whipped Stanford, 81 1 •»-49,
here Saturday.
Johnson, apparently celebrating his Friday election as UCLA stu
dent body president, came through with his all time bests in the

discus, shot-put and javelin. I lis
winning discus mark of 170-9%
erased Don Viek's year-old meet
mark by slightly more than three
feet, and his javelin throw of 237-
30 wiped out Leo Long's old rec
ord of 226-1116.
Ernie C un 1 if 112 e and Maury
Graves pulled down meet m irks
in the losing Stanford cause. Cun
liffe galloped through the half
mile in 1:51.8 to beat Rob Sea
man's 1:52.4 run last year.
Easy Victory
Graves led practically all the
way in the two-mile, finishing in
9:10 to better his own record of
9:15.4, established at Westwood
last year. He ripped through his
first mile in 4:27, then came
home easily as second man Ken
Riding of UCLA faded in the final
880.
Dean Smith, although not win
ning, turned in the most encour
aging of the Stanford perform
ances. Smith was off slowly, but
came fast in I lie final 20 yards as

he sped the 100 in 9.6. Smith
barely lost a photo-finish decision
to Dave James. Smith's chest hit
the tape first, but Jarnes' torso
was first across the finish line.
James' winning 9.6 equaled the
meet record set IS years ago by
the Cards' Clyde Jeffrey. George
Roubanis of UCLA accounted for
the final record when he vaulted
14-3, 1 15/16 better than Len Ei
lers' former record.
Monzingo's Best
Bob Monzingo also produced a
best-of-life mark as he won the
mile in 4:17.5. Monzingo was
aided immeasurably by Norman
Lloyd, the Indians' outstanding
middle distance star. Lloyd
pushed Monzingo through the
first three laps, then hung in sec
ond place the rest of ihe way to
heat off any challenge by a Bruin.
Monzingo covered his final lap in
60.5.
Lloyd was saving for an all-out
effort in the two-mile, lie hung
with Graves in the longer race
for five laps, but then fell stead
ily back as he finished third in
9:28.7— still his best-ever in Ihe
eight-lapper.
Chuck Cobb was Stanford's
lone double winner. UCLA's Mar
vin Luster stayed home for spring
football practice, so Cobb had
only Ken Thompson to battle, and
he handled him easily. Cobb won
the high hurdles in 14.2, the lows
in 23.7.
Mike Franchelti and Jim Back
si rand each impressed in the field.
Franchetti negotiated 11 feet in
the pole vault for the second time
this year, and Backstrand threw
206-8 for his best in the javelin
this year.
