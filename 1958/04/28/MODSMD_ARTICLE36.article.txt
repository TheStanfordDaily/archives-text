# Tribe Netmen Win Little at Ojai Meet

### John Schwarz 
(Editor's Note: Daily sports writer John Schwarz 1 raveled with
the Stanford tennis team to the O.jai Tournament.)

Blistered feet, bruised knees and a mere four points were all the
Stanford tennis team could bring back from their weekend jaunt to
play in tlie PCC division of the Ojai tennis tournament.
Jack Douglas, the only Stanford quarter-finalist in singles, got no
farther than the quarters as he was downed by a combination of fine

play by UCLA's John Cranston
and a badly blistered toe.
When Douglas began his match
it appeared that, blister or no
blister, nothing was going to stop
him as he broke through Cran
ston's opening serve and held his
own, but from then on Cranston
took complete control and the
Uclan ripped off six straight
games to win the first set 6-2.
Slowed Down
As the second set progressed it
became apparent by the way the
usually speedy Stanfordite was
slowed down that there was some
thing wrong with him. Douglas
was so slowed down by the blis
ter that he failed time after time
to get in the right position to put
away easy volley shots, and soon
found many of what should have
been put-away shots falling into
the net.
Cranston wasted no time once
he knew he held the reins and
finished the match by winning
the second set 6-3. Cranston
eventually lost to teammate Mike
Franks in the semis, and Franks
then became a victim of the tour

nament champ, A1 Olmedo of SC.
As a result of Douglas' loss,
Stanford was completely elimi
nated from the tourney and fin
ished, as predicted, in third place
with four points. The Indians
were not too far behind SC's nine
points but trailed way behind the
UCLA Bruins' 16 markers.
Miss Rodi Shines 1
Tina Rodi, one of four Stanford
girls entered in the Women's In
tercollegiate Division, played in
one of the best matches of the
whole weekend as she extended
highly - favored and highly
ranked Darlene Hard to three
sets before losing in her semi
final match.
Miss Hard, who was a finalist
at Wimbledon last year and who
is currently ranked as the fourth
best woman player in Ihe United
'States, lost but one set in the
whole tourney and that came at
the hands of Miss Rodi. "Unfortu
nately for Miss Rodi, Miss Hard
came back very strong in the
third set to win a 6-3, 6-8, 6-1 vic
tory.

As a result of Douglas' loss,
Stanford was completely elimi
nated from the tourney and fin
ished, as predicted, in third place
with four points. The Indians
were not too far behind SC's nine
points but trailed way behind the
UCLA Bruins' 16 markers.
Miss Rodi Shines 1
Tina Rodi, one of four Stanford
girls entered in the Women's In
tercollegiate Division, played in
one of the best matches of the
whole weekend as she extended
highly - favored and highly
ranked Darlene Hard to three
sets before losing in her semi
final match.
Miss Hard, who was a finalist
at Wimbledon last year and who
is currently ranked as the fourth
best woman player in Ihe United
'States, lost but one set in the
whole tourney and that came at
the hands of Miss Rodi. "Unfortu
nately for Miss Rodi, Miss Hard
came back very strong in the
third set to win a 6-3, 6-8, 6-1 vic
tory.
(Editor's Note: Daily sports writer John Schwarz 1 raveled with
the Stanford tennis team to the O.jai Tournament.)

Blistered feet, bruised knees and a mere four points were all the
Stanford tennis team could bring back from their weekend jaunt to
play in tlie PCC division of the Ojai tennis tournament.
Jack Douglas, the only Stanford quarter-finalist in singles, got no
farther than the quarters as he was downed by a combination of fine

play by UCLA's John Cranston
and a badly blistered toe.
When Douglas began his match
it appeared that, blister or no
blister, nothing was going to stop
him as he broke through Cran
ston's opening serve and held his
own, but from then on Cranston
took complete control and the
Uclan ripped off six straight
games to win the first set 6-2.
Slowed Down
As the second set progressed it
became apparent by the way the
usually speedy Stanfordite was
slowed down that there was some
thing wrong with him. Douglas
was so slowed down by the blis
ter that he failed time after time
to get in the right position to put
away easy volley shots, and soon
found many of what should have
been put-away shots falling into
the net.
Cranston wasted no time once
he knew he held the reins and
finished the match by winning
the second set 6-3. Cranston
eventually lost to teammate Mike
Franks in the semis, and Franks
then became a victim of the tour

nament champ, A1 Olmedo of SC.
