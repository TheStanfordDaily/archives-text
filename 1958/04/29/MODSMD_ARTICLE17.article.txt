# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## Stalemate 
### Walter Lippmann 
During the past week the Kremlin has been
acting as if it were in no hurry at all to have a
meeting at the summit. It is not clear why Mr.
Gromyko is taking this line. It is possible, how
ever, that there has been some kind of decision
reached at the highest level.
We may assume, I believe, that the Soviet
policy is to maintain the status quo —that is, to
avoid serious negotiation for settlements —and
yet a< the •unie time to relax the fears and ten
sions which trouble the Russian people as they
do nil the other peoples of the world. The Krem
lin may have come to the conclusion that the
basic Western policy is not to relax the tension
unless and until the Soviet Union makes con
cessions which amount to a substantial retreat.
It has been made abundantly clear in Wash
ington that this Government is opposed to a
meeting of which the real and only purpose is
to reduce tension. President Eisenhower himself
might, if left to follow his own impulses, be
induced to participate in that kind of a meeting.
But Mr. Dulles is opposed, and he has the able
and vehement support of Mr. Truman and Mr.
Acheson. acting as spokesmen of the Democratic
party.
This would mean, so the Kremlin may have
concluded, that at a summit meeting they might
find themselves on the defensive, subject to em
barrassing questions about a change in Germany,
in eastern Europe and in the Middle Hast.

All this, I hasten to say, is mere speculation.
But it springs from the known realities. Thus,
wc know from repeated statements by Mr. Khru
shchev that his terms for a settlement of the
cold war are a recognition of the status quo in
Germany and in eastern Europe, plus open and
avowed rivalry in Asia and Africa. On this basis
he proposes to relax the tension of the race of
armaments and of the military posture which put
Iho two great powers in a state of permanent
mobilization.
Our policy, on the oilier hand, is in ils essen
tials a challenge to the status quo. This means,
and is bound to mean, an acceptance on our part
of an indefinite state of tension. Officially, we

are opposed to a pause in the race of armaments.
Unless the President reverses it, our poliey is not
to regulate the race but to go all out to win it.
Dr. Teller and Admiral Strauss are offering
the Pentagon a glittering prize. Or is it a mirage
in the desert? They propose to give us absolute
nuclear superiority. It will consist of offensive
nuclear weapons capable of destroying the ad
versary and of defensive nuclear weapons, still
to be invented, which can defend us from being
destroyed by the adversary. They are telling us
that if we are allowed to go on testing and de
veloping. they will reach the Utopian condition
of affairs when we can strike absolutely and
cannot be struck dangerously.

There is no use going <o a summit meeting,
there is no use going through the motions of
preparing a summit meeting, as long as both of
the two big powers have positions that cannot be
negotiated. What is likely to come of this diplo
matic stalemate?
It will mean, I believe, that since things will
not stand still, and as the new generation—the
post-postwar generation—comes forward and the
Angry Old Men of Diplomacy subside, the rela
tive importance both of Moscow and of Washing
ton will decline. We are at least at the beginning
of the end of the postwar era when political
power was polarized around the two great sur
vivors of World War 11.
I do not know this, but I believe that this is
the fact inside the Communist orbit. The influ
ence of Moscow in Warsaw, in Belgrade, in Pei
ping, may rise or fall from time to time, but its
general trend is downward. There is no doubt,
I think, that the decline of the importance of the
United States is one of the great facts within the
noil - Communist world. The anti - Americanism
which is such a big political phenomenon is no
doubt a complex of many feelings, but the core
of it, I think, is not a rebellion against our power
and our leadership but resentment that we expect
to be treated as if our power and our leadership
(relatively speaking) were what they were in
the postwar years.
