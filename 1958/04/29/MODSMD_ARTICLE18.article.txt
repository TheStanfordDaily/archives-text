Housing Problem Solution
Editor, The Daily:
Visualize, if you can, Iho Stanford Senior
Woman of today as she will he in 10 years. One
sees her on a chaise longue, eating bonbons, with
her faithful Chihuahua dog nearby.
Tn this vision lies Iho solution to the women's
housing problem. Tf the women were replaced
by men, then the University would be able to
educate 3000 more males than it does now. Soon
there would he a plethora of men who, with col
lege educations, could earn money to buy their
wives ch;iise longues, bonbons and Chihuahuas.

Request for Presidential Candidates
Editor, The Daily:
We have a special request for those candidates
running for the office of president of the ASSU.
Tn order to know how to vote, we want a state

ment as to how these candidates stand on Iho
following issues:
(1) Do they believe that Iho Scratch Sheet
should be under the editorial jurisdiction of the
Legislature?
(2) Will they advocate the development of the
new undergraduate library and the increase of
faculty salaries in preference to the development
of the new Union?
(3) Will they actively press for the right of
women to live off-campus?
These items transcend any general platform.
The candidates owe it tf) the student body to state
their respective positions before the final elec
tions.
