# Curtice Drills Tribe On New Pass Plays
## 
### 
Coach Jack Curtice's spring football squad started its second week
of workouts yesterday with fundamentals drills and extensive work
on passing still the major items on the docket.
Curtice's rather exact pass patterns, which differ more than ex
pected from former coach Chuck Taylor's, have dictated Ihe allot-

j ment of practice time.
Sophomore Dick Norman is up
in the quarterback spot on the
squad's first team, with Jim By
rer and Rick McMillen at: the
right and left hall's, and Doug
Dick at full lo round out the
backfield. The line has Irv Nico
lai and Chris Bur ford at the ends,
Phil Burkland and Eric Protiva
at the tackles, Russ Steele and
Bob Peterson at the guards and
Doug Pursell at center.
Junior Bob Nicolet is directing
the second unit with Dick Bowers
and Jim Sinnerud at the hall's and
John Bond at the fullback slot.
Roch Conklin is the center. John
Thomas and Don Dawson are
guards, Ty Polich and Dean Hin
shaw, tackles, and Jim Ukropina
and Trev Grimm, ends.
Freshman standouts Gil Dowd
and Bob Heigold made their first
appearances at drill yesterday,
but at the same lime junior Meigs
Jones and sophomore Bill Cooper
were lost to the squad. Jones
broke his nose last week and will
not engage in any contact for at ,
least a week; Cooper may be
forced to undergo an operation
for cartilage trouble with his
knee, and will be lost indefinitely.
Sophomores Larry Esehelman,
