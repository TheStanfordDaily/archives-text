# Tribe Netters Meet Spartans; Seek 2nd Win
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team, which
recently finished a rough week
end at O.jai, will have an oppor
tunity lo breathe a little easier
today when it takes on San Jose's
Spartans on the Spartans' home
courts.
Coach Bob Renker of Stanford
has decided to give several of his
regulars a rest today and will
take two or three of his reserves
to face the Spartans.
Earlier this year Stanford
whipped their weak Northern
California neighbors, 9-0, and
even with a reserve-studded line
up the Indians will be favored to
roll up another one-sided victory.
Playing in tomorrow's match
for Stanford will be Brooks Raw
lins, Dave Nelson, Lowell Car
ruth, Bob Bowden, Dick Mosk
and Mike Ely.
