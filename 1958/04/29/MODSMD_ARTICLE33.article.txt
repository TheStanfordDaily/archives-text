# Lloyd-Bowden Duels Assured
## 
### 
Norman Lloyd and Don Bowden will meet in the mile, 880 and
probably the relay Saturday when Stanford and California clash in
the Rig Meet in Stanford Stadium.
This became definite yesterday when coaches Payton Jordan and
Brutus Hamilton announced their meet entries at the track and field

writers' luncheon in San Fran
cisco.
Hamilton, speaking first, said
with no qualifications that Bow
den would make the double, but
that his condition and the meet
score would determine whether
or not the long-striding senior
would go a leg on the relay.
Jordan Jokes
Jordan startled a few of the
writers when he said wilh a
straight face that Lloyd would go
in the 440 and two-mile. Afler the
shock wore off, he confessed thai
Stanford's Canadian star would
run against Bowden in the two
and four-lappers.
The twin battles shape up as
the most attractive individual Big
Meet duels in at least 30 years.
Lloyd, only a sophomore, has al
ready set Stanford records in the
880 and mile. His 1:19.2 is the
nation's fastest mark of the year,
and his 4:06 mile ranks third.
Four-Minute Miler
Bowden, America's first and
only four-minute miler, has sea
sonal bests of 1:49.8 and 4:0").8,
each the second-fastest time in
the U.S. this year.
Hamilton said that barring
windy weather, the winner of
each of the two races should turn
in an excellent lime. Jordan said
the mile race should produce the
best time of the year.
Hamilton will pull out all the
stops in the way of doubles and
triples. Willie White and Monte
Upshaw will each go in the TOO.
220 and low hurdles, and Maynard
Orme will run the mile and 880
or two-mile.
Jordan's entry list contained
little in the way of surprises, but
did reveal that Dick Lassen will
go back down to the 440.
Both coaches agreed that al
though the performers in the
field events don't measure up to
the runners in quality, the field
events will probably decide the
meet.
With both schools thoroughly
inconsistent in the field, the
unique possibility looms that the
meet might be decided before any
races are run just in case one
school should come up with a se
ries of surprises. The more like
ly guess, however, is that the
meet will go down to ihe relay.
