# Card-Cat 1-1 Tie To Finish Friday
## 
### 
Stanford and California will
play off their 1-1 tie Friday at
3:15 as- a prelude to a scheduled
bail game between the two
clubs. The Indians and Bears* 1
went 13 innings to a standstill
last Friday as darkness inter
vened.
The clubs will resume play
iti the top of the 14th, and the
game will of course be a sud
den-death affair. Both teams
will he using the same person
nel and line-ups which were in
the game at the time it was
called.
This should give the Indians
a slight advantage, since Cul
was down to its fourth pitcher
and third catcher, and had used
most of its pinch hitters.
