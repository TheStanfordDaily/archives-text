# Young Democrats Offer Active Campaign Program
## 
### Leo Krulitz 
Party politics in an election
year and the practical workings
of America's political system are
some of the things offered stu
dents and young people of this
area by the Stanford Area Young
Democrats.
In addition to the regular meet
ings with speakers—often candi
dates—and discussions, an inti
mate relationship is established
with the campaign and campaign
issues by working for the candi
dates in their headquarters lick
ing envelopes and pounding type
writers.
Closer to elections, members so
desiring will .even work pushing
doorbells and placing telephone
calls through the club's political
action committee.
Not All Work
All isn't work, however, and the
social functions include backyard
lawn parties as well as party con
ventions, dinners and cocktail
parties.
Reorganization of the YD's was
necessary this spring because the
officers from the previous year
all graduated or left Stanford.
The president, Fred Sauls, a jun
ior, was elected to serve the rest
of the academic year. He says of
the club:
"The Stanford Area Young
Democrats' outward and obvious
obligation and responsibility re
volve around the Democratic par
ty. We remain, however, free to
both criticize and endorse the pol
icy of the party as we study our
own positions through political
action."
Bryan Russell
Bryan Russell, Democratic can
didate for Representative from
this congressional district, was a
recent speaker at a YD meeting.
Commit lees play an important
part in the organization of the
club and, along with the four
elected officers, make up the ex
board, which meets once a week.
Tom Robinson, sophomore, heads
I he political action committee;
Jon Van Neil is chairman of the

program committee; and Bob Bar
ry, club treasurer, also serves as
membership chairman.
Ernie Hartz, a past president of
the YD's, is the parliamentarian,
and Pam Staley, Ruble freshman,
serves as vice-president.
