# Psych Tests Measure Sub-perception
## 
### 
Thirty-two Stanford students
were recently the guinea pigs in
an experiment with subliminal
perception. In concentrated labo
ratory tests, under the direction
of Professor Ernest R. Hilgard,
the students were somewhal
vague when asked to draw what
they had seen in a picture flashed
on a screen for 1/50 of a second.
The technique of subliminal
perception involves flashing split
second messages on a television
or movie screen. The message is
so fleeting that the viewer is un
aware that he has seen it. In sub
liminal advertising, however, the
viewer may sometimes be moved
to act on the message.
The Stanford tests involverl the
use of colored slides on viewing
sets. The subjects were asked to
draw the picture they had just
seen. Later on they were asked
to draw word-association pictures
representing wood, water, man
and so on.
The students' initial drawings
lacked many details of the origi
nal picture, but three out of four
word - association drawings dis
played such details "recovered"
from the picture. Yet. when asked
to re-draw the picture, the slu
dents again failed to include
these recovered details.
"This suggests that uncon
sciously perceived"material is dis
sociated from the original percep
tion," Professor Hilgard said.
