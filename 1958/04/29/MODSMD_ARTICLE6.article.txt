# VANGUARD II
## Navy Fails In Satellite Orbit Try 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” The
Navy's attempt to place a second
Vanguard satellite into orbit last
night apparently failed when the
third of three rocket stages did
not fire.
The Navy in Washington an
nounced 20 minutes after the
rocket was launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., that "the ve
hicle did not attain the speed re
quired to send an object into or
bit around the earth."
A statement issued at the Pen
tagon, based upon preliminary
readings of data reecived by the
Naval Research Laboratory, said
thai "test range instruments in
dicated successful operation of
the rocket's first two stages.
However, the third stage did not
fire."
The N'avy said that information
gained from last night's flight,
when the first stage left the
launching pad successfully and
the second - stage rocket appar
ently fired, will be used in the
launching of additional scientific
earth satellite rockets during the
remainder of the International
Geophysical Year.
The satellite, a sphere 20 inches
in diameter, contained an instru
ment which would have been able
to measure the cosmic ray out
put of the sun, especially during
solar flares, and broadcast its
findings back to earth.
These discoveries will be of
vast practical value in solving
the mystery of why short-wave
radio reception on earth fades
out, often for hours, when solar
flares erupt with the power of a
million hydrogen bombs.
