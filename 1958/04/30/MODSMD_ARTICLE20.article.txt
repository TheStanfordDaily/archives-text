# Backward Step
## 
### 
Stanford womf.n took a backward step in
undergraduate education Monday night when
they voted lo adopt a strict class-preferential
housing system.
Bv a narrow margin, 2<°» voles, they ignored
the many weeks of planning by the AWS
housing commit lee to approve a proposal
which makes il necessary lo abandon all hopes
of class-integrated housing for women. I lie
outcome of this plan will he lo make l.agunila
a virtually all-sophomore dorm, with the same
unhappy conditions there next year which
have existed this year—a minority of discon
tented juniors. The new plan as proposed by
AWS would have increased the number of
juniors in l.agunila, thus eliminating iheir
feeling of isolation from the rest of their class.
For frosh women, chances to mix with upper
classwomen next year are gone. They will,
except for a few, be compelled lo associate with
their classmates in their living area: and, while
this is desirable in thai it promotes class unity
and friendship, il does not pro\ ide opportunity
for a broadening intellectual atmosphere.

II is natural for people to want to live with
their friends. Il is also natural for them to do
all ihey ran lo insure their living in what is to
tliein the "favored" area. But—is it naturally
desirahle lo segregate classes for the favored
few the seniors? Junior-swill have some small
choice; sophomores will have no choice at all.
Integrated class housing is not an abstract
ideal dreamed up lo humor ihe University's
staled policy toward the growth of the under
graduate in ihe I niversity. The men liave in
tegrated housing al'ler iheir freshman year, and
il works in Stern, in Toyon and in the fra
ternities.
The women have chosen "Plan B." As the
AW S housing committee members commented,
the results can only he shown by the drawing.
That ihe seniors will be happy, there is no
doubt; juniors less so, and sophomores will
make ihe best of il. Meanwhile, opportunities
for women students to widen their knowledge
through conlact with those in oilier classes—
opportunities which can best he provided in
the intimacy of a living group —have disap
peared.
