Editor, The Daily:
In answer to the questions put forward in yes
terday's Daily, T submit the following:
(1) The Scratch Sheet, responsibly run, can
contribute a great deal to Stanford's academic
system. Irresponsibly run, it could do more harm
than good. At present its staff is preparing a
constitution to be submitted for Legislature ap
proval. I feel that any publication of that nature
should acknowledge its responsibility to the
ASSU. This is a long way from the connotations
associated with "editorial jurisdiction."
12) There is no disagreement, to my knowl
edge, concerning the need for an increase in
faculty salaries. Indeed, this need is largely re
sponsible for the increase in tuition and the tight
ening of the student government budget. Nor is
there any disagreement that Stanford needs a
new Undergraduate Library. This year alone
library use has increased more than 30 per cent.
But Ihe salary question and the library question
cannot accurately be put on a preference basis
with the problem of financing the Student Union.
Donations to the Union fund are made specifically
for that purpose and may not be arbitrarily re
allocated. At present a booklet is being preparer!
concerning the library problem which will be
sent around with requests for donations.
(3) The first step in the solution of Ihe
women's off-campus housing problem is resolu
tion by the women themselves. It appears that
there is a great difference of opinion among ihem
as to the age or class basis of such a program.
It is not the student body president's function to
arbitrarily initiate such a policy, but rather to be
responsive to the wishes of an informed student
body.
One must keep in mind that the student body
president can only act in response to student
wishes if those wishes are expressed. Students
themselves can impose respect and responsibility
on student government only if they are informed
of the problems and issues up for decision. This,
in essence, is my position.

Candidate lor ASSU President

Should Take Personal Stand
Editor, The Daily:
Not only as an ASSU candidate am I glad to
answer these questions, but as a student I am
pleased to see there was enough interest to ask
them.
(1) Regarding the Scratch Sheet: Throughout
the campaign my platform has consistently in
cluded approval of the Scratch Sheet. My original
platform still holds—l think the Scratch Sheet
should exist without editorial jurisdiction of the
Legislature so long as the Scratch Sheet editorial
board will stand behind every criticism included
in the publication.
(2) Undergraduate Library and faculty salaries
as opposed to the proposed Stanford Union: The
money now in the Tresidder Memorial Fund was
donated to be used explicitly for the new Union.
At the present time, students are paying $1 per
quarter out of tuition toward the new Union.
This assessment was approved in a campus-wide
election in tho early 1930's to pay for Memorial
Auditorium and in 1947 was transferred to the
Union Fund. If a similar election were to show
that the students would be willing to pay money
toward the Undergraduate Library or faculty
salaries, I would, of course, be in favor of this.
I am definitely opposed to raising the assessment
at the expense of either the library or faculty
salaries.
(3) Women living off-campus: At the present
time, the AWS has a committee working on the
possibility of women living off-campus. Until
AWS takes a stand on this issue, it is not the
place of Ihe ASSU president to try to initiate any
action. However, as president I would recommend
that AWS reach a decision on this issue or bring
ii to a women's vote. As an individual, I feel
upperclasswomen should have the right to live
off-campus if they so desire.
Again, I thank the sludents for asking these
questions. 1 think it is the responsibility of an
ASSIJ president to take a personal stand on
issues and make this stand known to the campus.

faculty salaries. Indeed, this need is largely re
sponsible for the increase in tuition and the tight
ening of the student government budget. Nor is
there any disagreement that Stanford needs a
new Undergraduate Library. This year alone
library use has increased more than 30 per cent.
But Ihe salary question and the library question
cannot accurately be put on a preference basis

for that purpose and may not be arbitrarily re
allocated. At present a booklet is being preparer!

(3) The first step in the solution of Ihe
women's off-campus housing problem is resolu

there is a great difference of opinion among ihem

It is not the student body president's function to
arbitrarily initiate such a policy, but rather to be
responsive to the wishes of an informed student
body.
One must keep in mind that the student body
president can only act in response to student
wishes if those wishes are expressed. Students
themselves can impose respect and responsibility
on student government only if they are informed
of the problems and issues up for decision. This,
in essence, is my position.

Candidate lor ASSU President

Should Take Personal Stand
Editor, The Daily:
Not only as an ASSU candidate am I glad to
answer these questions, but as a student I am
pleased to see there was enough interest to ask
them.
(1) Regarding the Scratch Sheet: Throughout
the campaign my platform has consistently in
cluded approval of the Scratch Sheet. My original
platform still holds—l think the Scratch Sheet
should exist without editorial jurisdiction of the
Legislature so long as the Scratch Sheet editorial
board will stand behind every criticism included
in the publication.
(2) Undergraduate Library and faculty salaries
as opposed to the proposed Stanford Union: The
money now in the Tresidder Memorial Fund was
donated to be used explicitly for the new Union.
At the present time, students are paying $1 per
quarter out of tuition toward the new Union.
This assessment was approved in a campus-wide
election in tho early 1930's to pay for Memorial
Auditorium and in 1947 was transferred to the
Union Fund. If a similar election were to show
that the students would be willing to pay money
toward the Undergraduate Library or faculty
salaries, I would, of course, be in favor of this.
I am definitely opposed to raising the assessment
at the expense of either the library or faculty
salaries.
(3) Women living off-campus: At the present
time, the AWS has a committee working on the
possibility of women living off-campus. Until
AWS takes a stand on this issue, it is not the
place of Ihe ASSU president to try to initiate any
action. However, as president I would recommend
that AWS reach a decision on this issue or bring
ii to a women's vote. As an individual, I feel
upperclasswomen should have the right to live
off-campus if they so desire.
Again, I thank the sludents for asking these
questions. 1 think it is the responsibility of an
ASSIJ president to take a personal stand on
issues and make this stand known to the campus.

women's off-campus housing problem is resolu
tion by the women themselves. It appears that
there is a great difference of opinion among ihem
as to the age or class basis of such a program.
It is not the student body president's function to
arbitrarily initiate such a policy, but rather to be
responsive to the wishes of an informed student
body.
One must keep in mind that the student body
president can only act in response to student
wishes if those wishes are expressed. Students
themselves can impose respect and responsibility
on student government only if they are informed
of the problems and issues up for decision. This,
in essence, is my position.
John Bohn
Candidate lor ASSU President

Should Take Personal Stand
Editor, The Daily:
Not only as an ASSU candidate am I glad to
answer these questions, but as a student I am
pleased to see there was enough interest to ask
them.
(1) Regarding the Scratch Sheet: Throughout
the campaign my platform has consistently in
cluded approval of the Scratch Sheet. My original
platform still holds—l think the Scratch Sheet
should exist without editorial jurisdiction of the
Legislature so long as the Scratch Sheet editorial
board will stand behind every criticism included
in the publication.
(2) Undergraduate Library and faculty salaries
as opposed to the proposed Stanford Union: The
money now in the Tresidder Memorial Fund was
donated to be used explicitly for the new Union.
At the present time, students are paying $1 per
quarter out of tuition toward the new Union.
This assessment was approved in a campus-wide
election in tho early 1930's to pay for Memorial
Auditorium and in 1947 was transferred to the
Union Fund. If a similar election were to show
that the students would be willing to pay money
toward the Undergraduate Library or faculty
salaries, I would, of course, be in favor of this.
I am definitely opposed to raising the assessment
at the expense of either the library or faculty
salaries.
(3) Women living off-campus: At the present
time, the AWS has a committee working on the
possibility of women living off-campus. Until
AWS takes a stand on this issue, it is not the
place of Ihe ASSU president to try to initiate any
action. However, as president I would recommend
that AWS reach a decision on this issue or bring
ii to a women's vote. As an individual, I feel
upperclasswomen should have the right to live
off-campus if they so desire.
Again, I thank the sludents for asking these
questions. 1 think it is the responsibility of an
ASSIJ president to take a personal stand on
issues and make this stand known to the campus.
