# TONIGHT AT THE SYMPHONY
## Brailowsky to Perform Rachmaninoff Concerto 
### Margot Zeiss 
Opera House-haunters will wel
come Alexander Brailowsky to
night when he sits at the piano to
thunder out Rachmaninoff's Sec
ond Concerto for Piano and Or
chestra.
Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3
in A minor (Scottish) and Con
certo for Orchestra No. 1 by Pe
trassi, an unknown wonder, will
compose the first half of the pro
gram.
Lovers of the piano concerto
idiom have a soft spot in their
hearts for Rachmaninoff's Sec
ond. Although no one claims it
to be the best, it is still one of the
most moving of concertos. The
grace and flow of Rachmaninoff's
melancholies are admirably suit
ed to Brailowcky's supple tech
nique-—a fortuitous combination.
Product of a period of gloom
and despair, the Concerto shows
Rachmaninoff's expansive Ro
manticism, his pianistic energy,
and the passionate Tchaikovsky
and Lizst tradition to which he
belongs.
The climax where the piano
hammers an impassioned version
of theme three, full of arpeggios,
against the opening melody car
ried by the strings- this is the
most exciting passage in Rach
maninoff concertos.
Mendelssohn was inspired to
write his Third Symphony by a

visil to Scotland in 1820 when he
was 20. His first letter from Ed
inburgh records that "everything
here looks so stern and robust,
half enveloped in a haze of smoke
or fog."
The Scottish Symphony is num
bered as third, but did not achieve
completion until 13 years after
Mendelssohn's visit. In 1812 it
was actually finished, which
makes it the fifth and last sym
phony he brought into comple
tion.
The symphony itself makes no
mention of Scotland as the inspi
ration of the work, nor was it
known by its geographical name
in its early performances. Rob
ert Schumann heard the Scottish
Symphony under the impression
that it was Mendelssohn's Italian,
and wrote with great enthusiasm
of its "beautiful Italian pictures."
Thus is musical landscape paint
ing subject to the interpretation
of its hearers.

most exciting passage in Rach
maninoff concertos.
Mendelssohn was inspired to
write his Third Symphony by a

visil to Scotland in 1820 when he
was 20. His first letter from Ed
inburgh records that "everything
here looks so stern and robust,
half enveloped in a haze of smoke
or fog."
The Scottish Symphony is num
bered as third, but did not achieve
completion until 13 years after
Mendelssohn's visit. In 1812 it
was actually finished, which
makes it the fifth and last sym
phony he brought into comple
tion.
The symphony itself makes no
mention of Scotland as the inspi
ration of the work, nor was it
known by its geographical name
in its early performances. Rob
ert Schumann heard the Scottish
Symphony under the impression
that it was Mendelssohn's Italian,
and wrote with great enthusiasm
of its "beautiful Italian pictures."
Thus is musical landscape paint
ing subject to the interpretation
of its hearers.
Opera House-haunters will wel
come Alexander Brailowsky to
night when he sits at the piano to
thunder out Rachmaninoff's Sec
ond Concerto for Piano and Or
chestra.
Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3
in A minor (Scottish) and Con
certo for Orchestra No. 1 by Pe
trassi, an unknown wonder, will
compose the first half of the pro
gram.
Lovers of the piano concerto
idiom have a soft spot in their
hearts for Rachmaninoff's Sec
ond. Although no one claims it
to be the best, it is still one of the
most moving of concertos. The
grace and flow of Rachmaninoff's
melancholies are admirably suit
ed to Brailowcky's supple tech
nique-—a fortuitous combination.
Product of a period of gloom
and despair, the Concerto shows
Rachmaninoff's expansive Ro
manticism, his pianistic energy,
and the passionate Tchaikovsky
and Lizst tradition to which he
belongs.
The climax where the piano
hammers an impassioned version
of theme three, full of arpeggios,
against the opening melody car
ried by the strings- this is the
most exciting passage in Rach
maninoff concertos.
