### JOHN SCHWARZ 
Meeea of the West —For Tennis
Every April, Ojai, California, becomes a "Mecca" to Western
tennis enthusiasts as players, spectators and tennis fans of all types
pour into ihe tiny Southern California town to watch one of the old
est and largest tennis tournaments in the world.
It seems as if there is a special division of the tourney for almosl
all age groups ranging from somewhere around the 3-and-under
group all the way up to a special section for Civil War veterans.
1 was fortunate enough to be among the many tennis lovers at
O.jai's annual tourney this past weekend, and had gone hoping to
see and he able to record a lot of good tennis. As expected I here
was plenty of good tennis at Ojai but unfortunately not a great deal
from the players I was hoping to see it from —the Stanford tennis
team.
No Stanford representative was able to survive the quarter-finals
in either doubles or singles, and the team finished third of the four
teams entered in the special PCC division of the tourney.
Part of Stanford's troubles began even before the Indians had
left campus when, two days before the trip, injury-prone Brooks
Rawlins, who has ben riddled by one physical mishap after another
this year, came up with a hemorrhaged knee cap . Rawlins made the
trip despite the injury and went on to limp his way to a straight set
loss to SC's fifth man L<l Guzman.
Besides Rawlins' opening-round loss, Stanford found all its entries
except Lowell Carrot li and -lack Douglas wiped out in their first
round matches. Carrulli was lucky enough to draw a member of the
unbelievably weak ( al team, Warren Sisson, as a first-round oppo
nent and 1 his kept him alive for one round, but then he met Mike
Franks of UCLA and as a result one Stanfordite was left—.lack
Douglas.
In the past when Stanford has met opponents from the Los An
geles area, Douglas has usually been Stanford's old reliable, being
the only Northern Californian to hold his own. But this year Doug
las, a finalist in last year's Ojai event, fell by the wayside in the
quarter-final round thanks to some assistance from a painful toe
blister and a IJC'I.A spoiler named John Cranston.
Just about the time many Stanford followers including myself
were ready to forget about tennis for this year up popped some eye
opening doubles play by two of Stanford's two-man combos.
Hilgenian, Jeffries Scare Troy
Robin Ililgenian and Jim Jeffries, who had been all but counted
out as a doubles team, came to life in their match against SC's
lop duo of Alex Olmedo, the tourney's singles champ the last two
years, and his partner Kd Atkinson. Hilgeman and Jeffries were oul
lo play tlie role of giant-killers and if it hadn't been for a few bad
breaks the combo would have pulled the upset of the tourney. The
two Stanford sophs fought their way to the net innumerable times
and out hustled the Trojans through a set and a half before the
highly favored Trojans rallied to win a 4-0, (>-M, (5-4 match. The type
of play they put on in that match was good enough to defeat any
1 bird doubles team (the position they play on the regular team) in
the country, even UCLA's.
Catching the spirit, of their teammates' play, Dave Nelson and
Lowell Camitli proceeded to put up a top-notch effort against the
top seeded combination of John Cranston and John Lesch from
UCLA. Carrulli, who has come a long way in controlling his over
excitable disposition, played some of the best doubles of his life as
he and a very steady Nelson gave the Uelans a tough C ."i, X-C scare.
The doubles play did leave Stanford with some inklings of hope
for the rest of this year's campaign and special emphasis will be
stressed for the next two weeks on improving the entire team's
singles play and hoping to maintain and even improve on the doubles
performances of last weekend.
Ojai did produce one Stanford winner and even though his name
didn't go down in the books and neither did he win a trophy he still
won the honor of being the top tennis playing manager on the West
Coast. This winner was Sam Belford, one of the tenuis team's man
agers. Sam defeated the UCLA, Cal and USC managers in a special
tourney which went along well with all the other divisions being
played at Ojai.
