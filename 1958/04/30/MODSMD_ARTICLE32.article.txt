# Von Wronski Draws First Mound Start
## 
### 
Art von Wronski draws his first
varsity pitching assignment today
at 3:15 when Stanford and the
Cal Aggies of Davis meet in the
Sunken Diamond.
Von Wronski started the season
as a catcher after having done
about half of the varsity catching
in 1957. But for the past few
weeks Coach Dutch Fehring has
been giving him mound shots in
ihe Braves' game, and Von Wron
ski has looked good.
In 19-:! innings of hurling for
the Braves he's gained one victory
and suffered no losses and has
compiled a highly impressive 2.29
earned run average.
Sharp Control
Von Wronski's control has also
been surprisingly good for a new
comer to pitching. He's yielded
only seven walks and has struck
out an avearagc of one per game.
Fehring plans to use Von Wron
ski for just four innings, saving
him for possible use against Cali
fornia in the two game-plus series
Friday and Saturday.
Dick Williams, sophomore left
hander, will come in for three in
nings of work, and George Avery
will work the final two frames.
Fehring's alignment will still
see Dave Dow at third and Jim
Buik at shortstopâ€”a shift that
was brought about by the spiking
of regular shortstop Bob Dwight.
Shaw Tops Hitters
Al Shaw continues to lead the
Stanford offensive attack in al
most every major department. He
tops the regular hitters with a
.329 average, leads in runs and
hits with 26 and 28 respectively,
has drawn the most walks (20),
has Ihe most triples, 4, and the
most runs batted in, 24.
Shaw and Robinson are tied for
the lead in doubles with six each.
Shaw also assumed the home run
leadership over the week end as
he became Ihe second player in
Stanford history to knock two out
of the Sunken Diamond in one
game. He has three four-baggers
for i he season.
