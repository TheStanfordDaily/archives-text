# Cobb Out-Sick

### 
Stanford's Bit? Meet hopes received what could he a fatal .jolt
yesterday afternoon when Inirdler Chuck Cnbli was admitted to the
rent home with pneumonia.
Cobb is reported to have a slight spot on one lung, but the ill
ness isn't regarded as serious l , lb* must presently he regarded as
doubtful for the Saturday meet, although no decision will lie made
until late Friday or early Saturday.
California has already been installed as a slight favorite, and
Cobb's loss would greatly increase that favoritism. The Stanford
captain figured to win the highs and give Willie White a strong
battle for first in the lows-.
If Cobb is out, Cal would probably get eight points in the highs
instead of four, and from six to nine in the lows instead of three,
four or six.
Even if Cobb does recover in time to run, he'll almost surely
not he at peak efficiency. This would give White an almost cinch
victory in the lows, and give the Bears' Joe Griffin a fair chance
in the highs.
On the brighter side, indications were that the Stanford Sta
dium would see one of its biggest track crowds in some time. Con
servative estimates were that the crowd would exceed 8000; the
more optimistic looked for as many as 15,000.
In either case, fans have been urged to get to the stadium by
1:30 so as to see all of the field events, which could decide the
meet. By arriving early, spectators will also be assured of being
seated by 2, the starting time for the featured mile run battle
between Norm Lloyd and Don Bowden.
