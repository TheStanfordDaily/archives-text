# Net Reserves Whip Spartans
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team got back
into its winning ways yesterday
as the Indians beat San Jose
State's netters by a lopsided 7-2
score.
Stanford received some fine
play from five of the team's re
serves, Mike Ely, Dick Mosk, A 1
Callaway, Sam Bedford and Bob
Bowden, and these efforts along
with good performances from
regulars Brooks Rawlins, Lowell
Carruth and Dave Nelson were
more than enough to whip the
Spartans.
Most promising of the day's ac
tion was put in by Stanford's Bob
Bowden. Bowden, fighting for a
regular berth in the Stanford ten
nis picture, didn't hurt his
chances any yesterday as he
moved to the net with startling
speed and ran all over San Jose's
Joe Smith in singles. Shortly
after his singles win Bowden re
turned to the court with Mike Ely
to gain a top-notch doubles vic
tory over San Jose's John Mar
shall and Bob Namba.
Stanford's only singles loss of
the day was absorbed by sixth
singly man A 1 Callaway. Calla
way, taking a day off from the
senior class political wars, put up
a game struggle but lost a tough
three-setter to San Jose's Dick
