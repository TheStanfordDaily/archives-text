An expert in the fields of both

board of directors following a na

ford Medical Center.
New Hospital
Dr. Barnett currently runs the
200-bed Palo Alto Hospital, and

Stanford Hospital as well when it

University of Maryland. Previous
to coming here he was professor

"Challenge"
"The Palo Alto-Stanford Hos
pital Center offers an unusual
challenge," Dr. Barnett said. "The
problem is to develop a top-notch
hospital that has two equally im
portant functions. On the one
hand we must give the finest kind
of hospital care to the people of
this community. On the other, we
must have a first-rank place to
teach medical students."
