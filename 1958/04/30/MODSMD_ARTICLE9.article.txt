# PLAN B
## Women Get New Policy In Housing 
### 
A now women's housing policy,
favoring senior preference over
class-integrated housing, will go
into effect with this spring's
drawing.
The AVVS Cabinet yesterday
approved the plan which was
passed Monday night by a slim
margin, 6-41 to 613 for the AWS
proposed policy.
Under the new plan each resi
dence will be filled first with all
seniors desiring to live there, up
to a maximum of two-thirds per
house. The residence will then
he filled with all juniors wishing
to live there, with the remaining
places going to sophomores.
The Cabinet said a two-thirds
majority was not needed as was
previously announced, as a
change in housing policy is not a
change in the constitution.
Women also approved the fol
lowing specific changes in hous
ing policy:
1. Class status for drawing will
be determined by units or quar
ters, whichever gives the girl the
greatest advantage.
2. As many as four students
may draw together.
3. A student returning to the
University after an absence is to
be placed at the bottom of her
class on shrinkage.
4. One vacancy is to be left in
each Row house in spring draw
ing for returning juniors and sen
iors.
5. Some plan will be devised
for students at Stuttgart to draw
by proxy with their own classes.
