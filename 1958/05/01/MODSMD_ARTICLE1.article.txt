# Physicist Challenges Einstein Theory
## Schiff Outlines Research In Gravitational Forces 
### 
Dr. Leonard I. Schiff, head of the Stanford physics department,
yesterday released a preliminary report on studies which challenges
the theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein in 1916.
Dr. Schiff outlined his new theory in a paper, "Neutrino Theory
of Gravitation," which he presented yesterday at a meeting of the

National Academy ox bciences in
Washington, D.C.
The neutrino theory suggests
that "gravitational forces arise
from interchange of neutrinos be
tween any kinds of matter." If
this theory can be proved con
clusively, said Schiff, it will prove
that such interchange may pre
cipitate the attraction that draws
bodies together.
Einstein's theory does not in
volve any interchange of matter
between different bodies, observ
ed Schiff.
Schiff emphasized that his
work is in a very preliminary
stage, and that because of inter
nal inconsistencies in the theory
it cannot be said at this time that
these ideas have any relation to
the real world.
Inconsistencies
"A serious attempt is now be
ing made to remove these incon
sistencies and determine whether
or not the theory can account for
known experimental phenomena,"
he said.
Schiff said that Einsten's expla
nation of gravitation, explained
through his general theory of rel
ativity, is a "very beautiful" one
and is completely successful in
accounting for the experimental
observations, which are drawn
from astronomy.
The Einstein theory attributes
gravitational effects largely to
geometrical properties of space,
continued Schiff. II thus contends
that smaller moving bodies are
pulled toward larger ones.
Stands Apart
However, said Schiff, the Ein
stein theory "stands apart from
the quantum theory"; and at
tempts to reconcile it with the
quantum theory have thus far not
been completely .successful.
(The quantum theory—a major
concept in modern nuclear phys
ics—declares that the emission or
absorption of energy by atoms or
molecules takes place by steps
and not continuously. Each step
in this emission or absorption of
energy is called a quantum.)
"The quantum theory, on the
other hand," said Schiff, "is able
to account for phenomena on the
atomic and nuclear scale with
great success. In the past, sev
eral physicists have suggested

that gravitational force might be
analogous to electromagnetic or
nuclear forces in that they arise
from the exchange of some kind
of particle between the interact
ing objects.
Suggests Interchange
"The suggestion then arises
that gravitational forces arise
from interchange of neutrinos be
tween kinds of matter."
The new theory, Schiff said, is
suppor ted by some experimental
evidence, but he regards it as
"preliminary, incomplete an d
quite possibly incorrect."
"The basic idea is that gravita
tion might be explicable in some
other way than by Einstein's gen
eral theory of relativity," Schiff
said.
Dr. Schiff said that experi
ments, particular ly one by a Hun
garian physicist in 1910, have
formed the background for his
present theory.
"There still, however, remain
difficulties with the theory in re
gard to its internal consistency,"
he said. "Also, some of the as
tronomical observations, which
were accurately predicted by Ein
stein's theory, are only imper
fectly accounted for by the pres
ent theory."

Tells Findings
Dr. Leonard I. Schiff, head of the Stanford physics department,
yesterday released a preliminary report on studies which challenges
the theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein in 1916.
Dr. Schiff outlined his new theory in a paper, "Neutrino Theory
of Gravitation," which he presented yesterday at a meeting of the

National Academy ox bciences in
Washington, D.C.
The neutrino theory suggests
that "gravitational forces arise
from interchange of neutrinos be
tween any kinds of matter." If
this theory can be proved con
clusively, said Schiff, it will prove
that such interchange may pre
cipitate the attraction that draws
bodies together.
Einstein's theory does not in
volve any interchange of matter
between different bodies, observ
ed Schiff.
Schiff emphasized that his
work is in a very preliminary
stage, and that because of inter
nal inconsistencies in the theory
it cannot be said at this time that
these ideas have any relation to
the real world.
Inconsistencies
"A serious attempt is now be
ing made to remove these incon
sistencies and determine whether
or not the theory can account for
known experimental phenomena,"
he said.
Schiff said that Einsten's expla
nation of gravitation, explained
through his general theory of rel
ativity, is a "very beautiful" one
and is completely successful in
accounting for the experimental
observations, which are drawn
from astronomy.
The Einstein theory attributes
gravitational effects largely to
geometrical properties of space,
continued Schiff. II thus contends
that smaller moving bodies are
pulled toward larger ones.
Stands Apart
However, said Schiff, the Ein
stein theory "stands apart from
the quantum theory"; and at
tempts to reconcile it with the
quantum theory have thus far not
been completely .successful.
