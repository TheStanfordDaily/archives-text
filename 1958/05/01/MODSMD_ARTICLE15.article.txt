# King, Queen Races Tight In Con Home Balloting
## 
### 
Stanford magician Dick Zim
merman made good his promise
by predicting word for word the
top-right headline of yesterday's
San Francisco Chronicle.
The prediction, which was
scaled in a strongbox a week ago
Monday and kept in police cus
tody until last night, was read by
Associate Registrar Elmer C.
Wagner in the presence of Dean
of Men William D. Craig and
Daily staffers Rich Brown and
Wally Simpson.
Zimmerman had also predicted
the headline of the Palo Alto
Times which was correct in es
sence but not quite correct in
wording. At no time did Zimmer
man have any contact with the
contents of the strongbox.
Human being Jim Harvey of
KZSU holds a not-so-commanding
$•1.64 lead over Theta Deltii Chi's
boa constrictor Emil Fisch in the
race for - Con Home King and the
right to be crowned by Dean H.
Donald Winbigler in coronation
ceremonies during the Carnival
at Mama Garcia's tomorrow af
ternoon. Harvey 3814, Emil 3350.
Madam of El Tigre, one of the
few women in the race, is in the
lead for Queen with 1755 votes.
Second is Phi Sigma Kappa's
Sapphire Schmook with 1581
with Glamorous Grillo third at
1327.
Voting will continue until 2
p.m. tomorrow, but the figures
on the scoreboard will bo frozen
at the results of 3:15 p.m. today,
so that the winners will be kept
secret until the crowning cere
mony.
At yesterday's Strawberry
Brunch, freshman Dave Todd
gobbled down 12 dishes of short
cake in two hours with glasses
of grape juice in between to win
himself two tickets to "Call Me
Madam" and a sport shirt as the
biggest Con Home Shortcake Eat
er of 1958.
Linda Loynd set a more lei
surely pace for the women, but
won her division with four short
cakes.
The Car Wash closes today at
Lathrop and Jordan houses, with
the price still only $1. "The
Claw" also has its final run this
afternoon in Cubberley at 4.
The big finale to the whole
week of Con Home festivities is
the Carnival at Mama Garcia's to
morrow from 3 to 6, but actually
the show will start right here on
campus with the start of the all
comers, $45-in-prizes Bike Race in
back of Lake Lagunita at 2:30.
The first running of the race
will run from campus out Alpine
Road to Mama Garcia's, with di
visions for three-speed foreign
bikes and one-gear American mod
els.
