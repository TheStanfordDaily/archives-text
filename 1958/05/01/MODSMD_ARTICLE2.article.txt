## President Cites Figures: Decline 'Flattening Out' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AJj)—President
Eisenhower yesterday interpreted
a less-than-seasonal drop in unem
ployment as evidence that the
economic "decline is flattening
out."
Thisvwas at a news conference
at which Eisenhower sought to
knock down the idea that his job
is too much of a strain, that he
may resign and that he is groom
ing Vice-President Nixon as the
next Republican candidate for the
White House.
Essentially, Eisenhower read
I lie economic barometer about as
he has for several weeks. And
once more he said that a tax cut
still requires more study and
analysis.
The Commerce Department an
nounced Tuesday that unemploy
ment fell 78,000 between mid-
March and mid-April compared
with decreases of about 200,000 in
I he corresponding periods of the
last four years. The decline was
the basis of the first question at
the conference — a q u c s t i on
whether the President thinks it
"marks tlie beginning of an up
turn in the economy."
Kisenbower replied that he did
not think such a categorical state

ment could be made or that it
could be said that "Well, now, we
are on the highroad to an ad
vance."
