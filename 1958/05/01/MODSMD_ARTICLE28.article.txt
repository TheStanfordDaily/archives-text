# THE 						Finish Line

Bi<j Meet Thrills
.Saturday's Big Meet wilh California in Stanford Stadium is un
doubtedly going 1o provide some of the biggest track thrills ever seen
hero. Bob Gutowski's new world pole vault record set here last year
was exciting, but if form holds Saturday, the Lloyd-Bowden duels
should provide much more in the way of spectator excitement, even
if there aren't any world records.
Norman Lloyd and Don Bowden look somewhat alike at first
glance. Each is tall, thin—looks not too much like an outstanding
athlete until he's on the track. But when the mile run starts at 2
p.m., plenty of differences will be seen between the two.
Lloyd looks like Ron Delany, the Olympic Games 1500-meter
champion. The Stanford soph—but he's 24 runs with a short,
chopped stride. After only a lap or so, he looks as though he is
tiring until he starts his kick, that is.
Lloyd also has an unusual arm action. Rather than swinging his
arms in planes parallel to the path he's running, Lloyd swings them
across in front of his body.
Bowden, meanwhile, takes a much longer stride. He, more often
than Lloyd, winds up with the task of setting the pace. Bowden
doesn't like to do this particularly, but he will if the pace is too slow.
He isn't known to have too much of a finishing kick as a rule,
but anyone who saw the 1500-meter final in the 1956 U.S. Olympic
Trials will testify that Bowden can kick with the best of them if he
has to. In that race, he came from nowhere to nip Fred Wilt for
third and gain a place on the U.S. team.
Lloyd hasn't taken the early lead in a race yet this year. He's
content to stay just off the right shoulder of the lead man, or even
drop back as far as fourth if the field is bunched.
But when the final lap comes around, Lloyd cuts out. In the mile
against UNC, he hung behind Wes McLeod for three laps and then
left him for the final 440. In the great 880 race at Oxy against Ty
Hadley and the C ards' Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd waited until the last 180
before he up and left the field.
Bowden hasn't been beaten this year at all. Lloyd has lost twice,
but the efforts could hardly be called all-out. He's really gone for
broke only three times —his 4:06 mile against Troy, and his 880's
of 1:50.5 and 1:49.2 against Fresno and Oxy respectively.
The closeness in times and excellent ability of these two seern to
make it a certainty that the mile and half will be great races.
Since the mile is the first race, they'll both be completely fresh.
And there won't be any room for slacking off when the 880 rolls
around, since Cunliffe and Jerry Siebert will be on hand to steal the
race if it's available for stealing.
Just what psychological factors will make themselves present is
hard to determine. Lloyd has been non-emotional and very analytical
in his preparation for Bowden, and Bowden has certainly had enough
championship experience to keep from getting rattled even if he
does lose the mile.
Picking a winner is nothing more than guesswork, since it's
impossible lo tell who will have to set the pace, how fast the pace
will be, or what part the other entrants will play in either race.
Still, I'll guess—and I'll guess Lloyd. He's doubled more than
Bowden this year, and seems a bit further along in conditioning.
Bowden, for example, turned 1:20 for the 660 but could finish in
only 29.8 for a 1:49.8 at Washington last week. I like Lloyd's kick,
too no one's beaten it when the chips have been down.
One thing fans should be sure to remember—the mile begins a!
2 o'clock sharp. With a large crowd forecast, the person who plans
to arrive right at 2 may find himself in a traffic or gate jam, and ii
would be too bad if he were to miss the feature race. With the de
cisive field events beginning at 1:30 and frosh events at 12:30, it
would seem wise to plan on arriving good and early.
Off the Track Kick
To gel off the subject of track for just once this spring, I'd like
lo take a look at the defensive play of the Stanford baseball club.
First, a backward glance to the 1957 season statistics:
Most noteworthy was Stanford's 45 double plays in 30 games
llie best d p mark of any college baseball team in the country. If
the Indians were to play 154 games a season (the number major
league clubs play) that average would give them 231 double plays
for the year. This mark becomes pretty impressive when we take
a look through the Little lied Book of Baseball and note that the
major league record for twin killings in one season is 217. And the
National League record is only 194.
Stanford finished third in the nation last year in fielding percent
age with a .963 mark, not far behind Ohio State's leading .970 mark.
This year, Ihe Cards have upped their average to .965, and have
played nine errorless games so far.
When such impressive figures recur, an explanation is generally
in order. And the explanation here is the excellent defensive coach
ing of Billy Alliouse.
Alhouse has been Stanford assistant for eight years after playing
four years of minor league ball. He works with the Tribe in all de
partments of the game, but his specialty is defensive work.
Head coach Dutch Fehring says, "I'm very fortunate to have Billy,
whom I consider to be the most outstanding baseball assistant in the
United Stales, based on his sound knowledge of the game, his ability
to teach young players and the way he gets along with other people."
The most unusual thing about Alliouse, however, is that he's just
a half-day coach. He loves baseball, so he works with the Indians
in the afternoon after devoting mornings and weekends to his Palo
Alto real estate business.
A look at the results of his work—the Indian infield is well
worth the lime.

has to. In that race, he came from nowhere to nip Fred Wilt for
third and gain a place on the U.S. team.
Lloyd hasn't taken the early lead in a race yet this year. He's
content to stay just off the right shoulder of the lead man, or even
drop back as far as fourth if the field is bunched.
But when the final lap comes around, Lloyd cuts out. In the mile
against UNC, he hung behind Wes McLeod for three laps and then
left him for the final 440. In the great 880 race at Oxy against Ty
Hadley and the C ards' Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd waited until the last 180
before he up and left the field.
Bowden hasn't been beaten this year at all. Lloyd has lost twice,
but the efforts could hardly be called all-out. He's really gone for
broke only three times —his 4:06 mile against Troy, and his 880's
of 1:50.5 and 1:49.2 against Fresno and Oxy respectively.
The closeness in times and excellent ability of these two seern to
make it a certainty that the mile and half will be great races.
Since the mile is the first race, they'll both be completely fresh.
And there won't be any room for slacking off when the 880 rolls
around, since Cunliffe and Jerry Siebert will be on hand to steal the
race if it's available for stealing.
Just what psychological factors will make themselves present is
hard to determine. Lloyd has been non-emotional and very analytical
in his preparation for Bowden, and Bowden has certainly had enough
championship experience to keep from getting rattled even if he
does lose the mile.
Picking a winner is nothing more than guesswork, since it's
impossible lo tell who will have to set the pace, how fast the pace
will be, or what part the other entrants will play in either race.
Still, I'll guess—and I'll guess Lloyd. He's doubled more than
Bowden this year, and seems a bit further along in conditioning.
Bowden, for example, turned 1:20 for the 660 but could finish in
only 29.8 for a 1:49.8 at Washington last week. I like Lloyd's kick,
too no one's beaten it when the chips have been down.
One thing fans should be sure to remember—the mile begins a!
2 o'clock sharp. With a large crowd forecast, the person who plans
to arrive right at 2 may find himself in a traffic or gate jam, and ii
would be too bad if he were to miss the feature race. With the de
cisive field events beginning at 1:30 and frosh events at 12:30, it
would seem wise to plan on arriving good and early.
Off the Track Kick
To gel off the subject of track for just once this spring, I'd like
lo take a look at the defensive play of the Stanford baseball club.
First, a backward glance to the 1957 season statistics:
Most noteworthy was Stanford's 45 double plays in 30 games
llie best d p mark of any college baseball team in the country. If
the Indians were to play 154 games a season (the number major
league clubs play) that average would give them 231 double plays
for the year. This mark becomes pretty impressive when we take
a look through the Little lied Book of Baseball and note that the
major league record for twin killings in one season is 217. And the
National League record is only 194.
Stanford finished third in the nation last year in fielding percent
age with a .963 mark, not far behind Ohio State's leading .970 mark.
This year, Ihe Cards have upped their average to .965, and have
played nine errorless games so far.
When such impressive figures recur, an explanation is generally
in order. And the explanation here is the excellent defensive coach
ing of Billy Alliouse.
Alhouse has been Stanford assistant for eight years after playing
four years of minor league ball. He works with the Tribe in all de
partments of the game, but his specialty is defensive work.
Head coach Dutch Fehring says, "I'm very fortunate to have Billy,
whom I consider to be the most outstanding baseball assistant in the
United Stales, based on his sound knowledge of the game, his ability
to teach young players and the way he gets along with other people."
The most unusual thing about Alliouse, however, is that he's just
a half-day coach. He loves baseball, so he works with the Indians
in the afternoon after devoting mornings and weekends to his Palo
Alto real estate business.
A look at the results of his work—the Indian infield is well
worth the lime.

Bi<j Meet Thrills
.Saturday's Big Meet wilh California in Stanford Stadium is un
doubtedly going 1o provide some of the biggest track thrills ever seen
hero. Bob Gutowski's new world pole vault record set here last year
was exciting, but if form holds Saturday, the Lloyd-Bowden duels
should provide much more in the way of spectator excitement, even
if there aren't any world records.
Norman Lloyd and Don Bowden look somewhat alike at first
glance. Each is tall, thin—looks not too much like an outstanding
athlete until he's on the track. But when the mile run starts at 2
p.m., plenty of differences will be seen between the two.
Lloyd looks like Ron Delany, the Olympic Games 1500-meter
champion. The Stanford soph—but he's 24 runs with a short,
chopped stride. After only a lap or so, he looks as though he is
tiring until he starts his kick, that is.
Lloyd also has an unusual arm action. Rather than swinging his
arms in planes parallel to the path he's running, Lloyd swings them
across in front of his body.
Bowden, meanwhile, takes a much longer stride. He, more often
than Lloyd, winds up with the task of setting the pace. Bowden
doesn't like to do this particularly, but he will if the pace is too slow.
He isn't known to have too much of a finishing kick as a rule,
but anyone who saw the 1500-meter final in the 1956 U.S. Olympic

has to. In that race, he came from nowhere to nip Fred Wilt for

Just what psychological factors will make themselves present is
hard to determine. Lloyd has been non-emotional and very analytical
in his preparation for Bowden, and Bowden has certainly had enough
championship experience to keep from getting rattled even if he
does lose the mile.
Picking a winner is nothing more than guesswork, since it's
impossible lo tell who will have to set the pace, how fast the pace
will be, or what part the other entrants will play in either race.
Still, I'll guess—and I'll guess Lloyd. He's doubled more than
Bowden this year, and seems a bit further along in conditioning.
Bowden, for example, turned 1:20 for the 660 but could finish in
only 29.8 for a 1:49.8 at Washington last week. I like Lloyd's kick,
too no one's beaten it when the chips have been down.
One thing fans should be sure to remember—the mile begins a!
2 o'clock sharp. With a large crowd forecast, the person who plans
to arrive right at 2 may find himself in a traffic or gate jam, and ii
would be too bad if he were to miss the feature race. With the de
cisive field events beginning at 1:30 and frosh events at 12:30, it
would seem wise to plan on arriving good and early.
Off the Track Kick
To gel off the subject of track for just once this spring, I'd like
lo take a look at the defensive play of the Stanford baseball club.
First, a backward glance to the 1957 season statistics:
Most noteworthy was Stanford's 45 double plays in 30 games
llie best d p mark of any college baseball team in the country. If
the Indians were to play 154 games a season (the number major
league clubs play) that average would give them 231 double plays
for the year. This mark becomes pretty impressive when we take
a look through the Little lied Book of Baseball and note that the
major league record for twin killings in one season is 217. And the
National League record is only 194.
Stanford finished third in the nation last year in fielding percent
age with a .963 mark, not far behind Ohio State's leading .970 mark.
This year, Ihe Cards have upped their average to .965, and have
played nine errorless games so far.
When such impressive figures recur, an explanation is generally
in order. And the explanation here is the excellent defensive coach
ing of Billy Alliouse.
Alhouse has been Stanford assistant for eight years after playing
four years of minor league ball. He works with the Tribe in all de
partments of the game, but his specialty is defensive work.
Head coach Dutch Fehring says, "I'm very fortunate to have Billy,
whom I consider to be the most outstanding baseball assistant in the
United Stales, based on his sound knowledge of the game, his ability
to teach young players and the way he gets along with other people."
The most unusual thing about Alliouse, however, is that he's just
a half-day coach. He loves baseball, so he works with the Indians
in the afternoon after devoting mornings and weekends to his Palo
Alto real estate business.
A look at the results of his work—the Indian infield is well
worth the lime.

Bi<j Meet Thrills
.Saturday's Big Meet wilh California in Stanford Stadium is un
doubtedly going 1o provide some of the biggest track thrills ever seen
hero. Bob Gutowski's new world pole vault record set here last year
was exciting, but if form holds Saturday, the Lloyd-Bowden duels
should provide much more in the way of spectator excitement, even
if there aren't any world records.
Norman Lloyd and Don Bowden look somewhat alike at first
glance. Each is tall, thin—looks not too much like an outstanding
athlete until he's on the track. But when the mile run starts at 2
p.m., plenty of differences will be seen between the two.
Lloyd looks like Ron Delany, the Olympic Games 1500-meter
champion. The Stanford soph—but he's 24 runs with a short,
chopped stride. After only a lap or so, he looks as though he is
tiring until he starts his kick, that is.
Lloyd also has an unusual arm action. Rather than swinging his
arms in planes parallel to the path he's running, Lloyd swings them
across in front of his body.
Bowden, meanwhile, takes a much longer stride. He, more often
than Lloyd, winds up with the task of setting the pace. Bowden
doesn't like to do this particularly, but he will if the pace is too slow.
He isn't known to have too much of a finishing kick as a rule,
but anyone who saw the 1500-meter final in the 1956 U.S. Olympic
Trials will testify that Bowden can kick with the best of them if he
has to. In that race, he came from nowhere to nip Fred Wilt for
third and gain a place on the U.S. team.
Lloyd hasn't taken the early lead in a race yet this year. He's
content to stay just off the right shoulder of the lead man, or even
drop back as far as fourth if the field is bunched.
But when the final lap comes around, Lloyd cuts out. In the mile
against UNC, he hung behind Wes McLeod for three laps and then
left him for the final 440. In the great 880 race at Oxy against Ty
Hadley and the C ards' Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd waited until the last 180
before he up and left the field.
Bowden hasn't been beaten this year at all. Lloyd has lost twice,
but the efforts could hardly be called all-out. He's really gone for
broke only three times —his 4:06 mile against Troy, and his 880's
of 1:50.5 and 1:49.2 against Fresno and Oxy respectively.
The closeness in times and excellent ability of these two seern to
make it a certainty that the mile and half will be great races.
Since the mile is the first race, they'll both be completely fresh.
And there won't be any room for slacking off when the 880 rolls
around, since Cunliffe and Jerry Siebert will be on hand to steal the
race if it's available for stealing.
Just what psychological factors will make themselves present is
hard to determine. Lloyd has been non-emotional and very analytical
in his preparation for Bowden, and Bowden has certainly had enough
championship experience to keep from getting rattled even if he
does lose the mile.

First, a backward glance to the 1957 season statistics:
Most noteworthy was Stanford's 45 double plays in 30 games
llie best d p mark of any college baseball team in the country. If
the Indians were to play 154 games a season (the number major
league clubs play) that average would give them 231 double plays
for the year. This mark becomes pretty impressive when we take
a look through the Little lied Book of Baseball and note that the
major league record for twin killings in one season is 217. And the
National League record is only 194.
Stanford finished third in the nation last year in fielding percent
age with a .963 mark, not far behind Ohio State's leading .970 mark.
This year, Ihe Cards have upped their average to .965, and have
played nine errorless games so far.
When such impressive figures recur, an explanation is generally
in order. And the explanation here is the excellent defensive coach
ing of Billy Alliouse.
Alhouse has been Stanford assistant for eight years after playing
four years of minor league ball. He works with the Tribe in all de
partments of the game, but his specialty is defensive work.
Head coach Dutch Fehring says, "I'm very fortunate to have Billy,
whom I consider to be the most outstanding baseball assistant in the
United Stales, based on his sound knowledge of the game, his ability
to teach young players and the way he gets along with other people."
The most unusual thing about Alliouse, however, is that he's just
a half-day coach. He loves baseball, so he works with the Indians
in the afternoon after devoting mornings and weekends to his Palo
Alto real estate business.
A look at the results of his work—the Indian infield is well
worth the lime.

Bi<j Meet Thrills
.Saturday's Big Meet wilh California in Stanford Stadium is un
doubtedly going 1o provide some of the biggest track thrills ever seen
hero. Bob Gutowski's new world pole vault record set here last year
was exciting, but if form holds Saturday, the Lloyd-Bowden duels
should provide much more in the way of spectator excitement, even
if there aren't any world records.
Norman Lloyd and Don Bowden look somewhat alike at first
glance. Each is tall, thin—looks not too much like an outstanding
athlete until he's on the track. But when the mile run starts at 2
p.m., plenty of differences will be seen between the two.
Lloyd looks like Ron Delany, the Olympic Games 1500-meter
champion. The Stanford soph—but he's 24 runs with a short,
chopped stride. After only a lap or so, he looks as though he is
tiring until he starts his kick, that is.
Lloyd also has an unusual arm action. Rather than swinging his
arms in planes parallel to the path he's running, Lloyd swings them
across in front of his body.
Bowden, meanwhile, takes a much longer stride. He, more often
than Lloyd, winds up with the task of setting the pace. Bowden
doesn't like to do this particularly, but he will if the pace is too slow.
He isn't known to have too much of a finishing kick as a rule,
but anyone who saw the 1500-meter final in the 1956 U.S. Olympic
Trials will testify that Bowden can kick with the best of them if he
has to. In that race, he came from nowhere to nip Fred Wilt for
third and gain a place on the U.S. team.
Lloyd hasn't taken the early lead in a race yet this year. He's
content to stay just off the right shoulder of the lead man, or even
drop back as far as fourth if the field is bunched.
But when the final lap comes around, Lloyd cuts out. In the mile
against UNC, he hung behind Wes McLeod for three laps and then
left him for the final 440. In the great 880 race at Oxy against Ty
Hadley and the C ards' Ernie Cunliffe, Lloyd waited until the last 180
before he up and left the field.
Bowden hasn't been beaten this year at all. Lloyd has lost twice,
but the efforts could hardly be called all-out. He's really gone for
broke only three times —his 4:06 mile against Troy, and his 880's
of 1:50.5 and 1:49.2 against Fresno and Oxy respectively.
The closeness in times and excellent ability of these two seern to
make it a certainty that the mile and half will be great races.
Since the mile is the first race, they'll both be completely fresh.
And there won't be any room for slacking off when the 880 rolls
around, since Cunliffe and Jerry Siebert will be on hand to steal the
race if it's available for stealing.
Just what psychological factors will make themselves present is
hard to determine. Lloyd has been non-emotional and very analytical
in his preparation for Bowden, and Bowden has certainly had enough
championship experience to keep from getting rattled even if he
does lose the mile.
Picking a winner is nothing more than guesswork, since it's
impossible lo tell who will have to set the pace, how fast the pace
will be, or what part the other entrants will play in either race.
Still, I'll guess—and I'll guess Lloyd. He's doubled more than
Bowden this year, and seems a bit further along in conditioning.
Bowden, for example, turned 1:20 for the 660 but could finish in
only 29.8 for a 1:49.8 at Washington last week. I like Lloyd's kick,
too no one's beaten it when the chips have been down.
One thing fans should be sure to remember—the mile begins a!
2 o'clock sharp. With a large crowd forecast, the person who plans
to arrive right at 2 may find himself in a traffic or gate jam, and ii
would be too bad if he were to miss the feature race. With the de
cisive field events beginning at 1:30 and frosh events at 12:30, it
would seem wise to plan on arriving good and early.
