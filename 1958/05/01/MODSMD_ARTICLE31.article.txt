# Douglas in Davis Cup Team Play
## 
### 
Jack Douglas, Stanford's top
tennis player, will travel down to
Los Angeles this week end to play
in the first of a series of round
robin tournaments which are be
ing held to determine this year's
U.S. Davis Gup team.
Douglas will have his hands full
at Los Angeles, for he will have
to play such top U.S. netters as
Ilam Richardson, Barry MacKay,
Whitney Reed. Gil Shea, Mike
Green and Mike Franks.
A good showing by Douglas,
however, would help him gain an
initial step toward earning a free
trip to Australia next December
to try to aid in returning the
Davis Cup to the United States.
