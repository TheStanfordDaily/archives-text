# Doctors Nix Cobb for Cal Meet
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Chuck Cobb entered Palo Alto Hospital yesterday afternoon for
further treatment of his pneumonia attack and is definitely nut of
the Rig Meet Saturday. His only consolation is that he may be able
lo watch the meet, and that he is given a fairly good chance to be
ready to run in the West Coast Relays May fo at Fresno.

Cobb's loss greatly cuts Stan
ford's chances lo win the meet
from Cal. He was counted on for
8 or 10 points, most or all of
which will now go to the Rears.
Stanford, however, still retains
a chance to win the meet because
of the unpredictability of the field
events.
Away from the point scoring
and into the realm of the stop
watch and tape measure, indica
tions are that as many as seven
all-time meet records may fall in
this 63rd track battle between the
Indians and Bears.
Greatest interest will be cen
tered on the efforts of Norm
Lloyd and Don Bowden to beat
each other in the mile and the 880
and, as a resultant, crack meet
marks in those events.
Both standards are presently
held by Bowden. In winning the
two events last year 1 , Bowden ran
4:09.9 and I:so.o—at the time it
was the second greatest double
of all time.
Each man has times faster than
both of the present records, and,
with the pressure of strong com
petition at its highest, new marks
appear likely.
The oldest Item in the record
book — Jack Weiershauser's 23.2
low hurdle clocking—looks to be
in definite danger. Willie White
of the Bears has equaled the mark
this year and ran 22.6 last year.
Two things may hamper
White's chances to crack the rec
ords —he'll be going in the 220
just a few minutes before, and he
won't have the pressure from
Cobb.

White could also equal or bet
ter the 100-yard dash record of
9.5. He's gone that fast this year
and was one-tenth faster in 1957.
Jack Yerman, the outstanding
Cal sophomore, should give the
440 mark of 47.6 a good run for
the money.
Yerman ran a blistering 47.0
two weeks ago against USC, even
though he didn't win the race.
This time, though, he'll want to
win as easily as possible in order
to save his strength for a rugged
220 and the mile relay.
The two-mile record appears to
be one of the most likely to go.
Maury Graves has already run
9:04.9 this year, and the record is
only 9:19.8. Roger Price and Don
Foster will both be pressing
Graves—probably not enough to
beat him, but at least enough to
send him through the first five
or six laps fast enough to come
home in good time.
The excellent relay record of
3:12.9, set 18 years ago by Stan
ford, is also in danger, especially
if the meet hinges on the event.
Stanford's quartet of Dick Las
sen, Ernie Cunliffe, Don Chesarek
and Norman Lloyd has run 3:11.4
this year. Although Cal has a
best of only 3:15.9, the Bears
haven't done much running with
their top quartet.
Oddly enough, not a single field
event record is in any but the
most remote danger of falling.
The weight, men are many feet
away from record breaking—in
deed, some of them will have their
hands full getting off a fair
throw.
The broad jumpers and the high
jumpers aren't close, either. Only
pole • vaulter Mike Franchetti is
within any sort of shooting dis
tance, and he'd have to improve
by more than four inches on his
all-time best of 14 feet.
