# CAL AGGIES FALL, 6-2
## Von Wronski Victor In First Indian Start 
### 
Ait von WVonski looked reasonably impressive in his first varsity
pitching assignment, and Dick Williams and George Avery followed
with five innings of perfect hurling to pace Stanford to a 0-2 victory
over the Cal Aggies of Davis here yesterday.
Von Wronski, as per pre-game plans, went only the first four in-

nings. He had just one bad in
ning—the third—and the relative
ly light damage the Aggies did
then wasn't all his fault.
The new mound convert struck
out seven Aggies in his four
frames, and walked only one. The
Aggies' two runs were a result of
three singles and a bad throw by
first baseman Joel Newkirk on a
rundown play.
Ben Robinson's three-run triple
to deep left-center in the second
inning gave the Indian hill staff
all the cushion it needed. Ralph
holding and Newkirk had walked,
and Burk had gotten a scratch
single to load the sacks.
After Von Wronski had struck
out the side in the fourth, Wil
liams came in and retired the

next nine men. Avery came in
for the eighth and ninth, and pol
ished off the final six men on in
field bounders.
Three of Williams' six victims
went out via the strike-out route.
The showings of all three
moundsmen made Stanford's
hopes in the two-plus series with
California this weekend look
brighter. Either Williams or Av
ery will get the Saturday starting
shot, with von Wronski available
in the bull pen whenever needed.
The Tribe batting attack wasn't
so impressive, however. Aside
from Robinson's timely triple, the
best they could do was a solid
double by Williams and four scat
tered singles, only two of them
solid.
