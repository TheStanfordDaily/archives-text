Several weeks ago interviewers from the Boeing Airplane
Company were on the campus.
This note is a Post Script to that visit. It has two
purposes: One, to thank the school, the Placement Office
people and the applicants for their interest and cooperation.
The other purpose is to invite all interested seniors, who
for one reason or another, were unable to see us during our
visit, to get in touch with us.
Boeing is a leader in the fields of advanced scientific
research and guided missile weapon system development. The
Boeing Bomarc, now in volume production, is the Air Force's

include studies of glide vehicles and space flight, celestial
mechanics, principles controlling space trajectories, drag
and heating effects in high speed space flight and re-entry.
Boeing is also the nation's foremost designer and builder
of long-range multi-jet aircraft. Rolling out of Boeing
plants are the eight-jet B-52 global bomber, the KC-135
