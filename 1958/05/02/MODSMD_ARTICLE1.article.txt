# Lloyd-Bowden Battles To Highlight Big Meet
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The finest 880 and mile battles in dual track meet history may be seen tomorrow when Norman
Lloyd of Stanford and Don Bowden of California tangle in the Big Mfct. in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
A crowd of approximately 10,000 is expected to witness the duels between America's only four
minute miler and the 24-year-old Canadian who has captured the fancy of track fans with his Delany-

1i k e style and great finishing
kicks.
Of equal interest will be the
point battle between the Indians
and Bears. California enters the
meet favored, chiefly because of
the presence of sprinter-hurdler
Willie White and the absence of
Stanford captain Chuck Cobb, out
with pneumonia.
Mile at 2 O'Cloek
Lloyd and Bowden are expected
to provide the high points of the
competition. They'll first meet in
the mile at 2 p.m.; then, at 2:50,
they'll have a return match in the
880; and if the meet is still in
doubt they'll probably meet for a
third time at about 3:40 as each
runs the third leg of the mile
relay.
The two individual races are
both toss-ups. Lloyd ran the mile
in 4:06 a month ago and hasn't
gone all-out in the four - lapper
since then. Bowden crui s e d
around in 4:05.8 two weeks ago,
running against USC as did Lloyd.
Best in Country
In the half, Lloyd and Bowden
rank 1-2 in the nation. Lloyd cut
loose with a 1:49.2 against Occi
dental two weeks ago, and Bow
den tore off a 1:49.8 in Seattle six
days ago.
Each man is the best 880-miler
in his school's history. Bowden
has all-time personal and Califor
nia bests of 1:47.2 and 3:58.7, both
run last year. Lloyd's 4:06 and
1:49.2 are his and Stanford's best
ever marks. Meet records of 4:09.9
and 1:50.0, both set in 1957 by
Bowden, aren't expected to last
long.
Just in case Bowden and Lloyd


NORMAN LLOYD
1:49.2, 4:06


DON BOWDEN
1:4!> 8, 4:05.8
are not up to snuff because of go
for-broke efforts in the mile, Cal's
Jerry Siebert will be ready to
challenge Cunliffe in a run for
the tape.
There are very few in the way
of sure winners in other events.
White seems the biggest cinch in
the 100, and he should make it a
triple with low hurdle ;ind 220 vic
tories. His teammate Monte Up
shaw, regaining the speed he had
as a high schooler before tearing
a muscle, could kill Stanford with
seconds and thirds in the same
three events.
Stanford's principal challenger
to White and Upshaw in the
sprints will be sophomore Dean
Smith. Pie started to reach the
realms predicted for him when he
chased Dave James to the tape in
9.6 against UCLA last week.
Smith hasn't been as relatively
fast in the 220, since he has some
trouble with the race on a curve.
But tomorrow's furlong will be on
the straightaway, so Smith may
cut loose with something in the
low 21's.
Anixter a Dark Horse
Another key to Stanford sprint
hopes, especially in the 100, will
be Ben Anixter. He was credited
with a third-place 9.7 against the
Bruins and could help the Tribe
greatly with another third.
Cal will be tough in the 440,
with Jack Yerman at 47.0 and Stu
Gould at 48.2. Don Chesarek, with
an early-season 47.4 on the first
leg of a relay, could help Stan
ford, but he's looked bad in the
past two weeks and may not even
score.
The two-mile looks like Stan
ford's only sure track victory,
with Maury Graves the class of
an otherwise average field. Cal
has just as much of a cinch in the
highs, now that Cobb is out.
Decision in Field
While the track events should
provide the better marks, the
meet will most likely be decided
in the field. The races have a fair
chance to run close to form, but
picking winners in some of the
jumping and throwing events is
about like finding a needle in a
haystack.
The discus and javelin throw
ers are all inconsistent, foul prone
and the possessors of poor marks.
But —they're about evenly match
ed. and points from there will
count just as much as the points
Lloyd and Bowden score.
Armand DeWeese is Stanford's
principal discus hope, and Harlan
Limmer could also help. In the
javelin, Jim Backstrand may at
last be on the road to a string of
over-200-foot throws, after a 206-8
effort last week. And broad-jump
er Kent Hansen will also take a
whirl with the spear.
Winters Consistent
Jerry Winters is Stanford's key
man in the shot-put. He's consist
ent at 52 feet, and Cal's Mike
Baxter is up and down between
51 and 53, so take it from there.
Hansen, John Kelly and A 1 Pe
terson could all beat John Mer
chant in the broad jump, or could
all lose to him. Stanford needs at
least 8 points here if it is to win
the meet.
Mike Franchetti and Terry Kel
ley are each at 14-0 in the pole
vault, but the Stanford senior
seems more consistent. Franchet
ti is also one of not-too-many In
dians who can rise to the occasion
of tough competition. He's de
fending Big Meet, champ in the
pole vault.
Steve Coughlin is Stanford's
high-jump hope. He's had trouble
with a sore leg and hasn't bet

tered 6-2. But Cal's best is Norm
Garrett at 6-4, so the event is
fairly open.
No Hold-Back in Relay
If the meet hinges on the relay,
Jordan and Hamilton will pull out
all the stops.
Stanford's top team of Cunliffe,
Lloyd, Chesai-ek and Dick Lassen

has turned 3:11.4. Cal hasn't gone
all out in the relay yet, but a team
of Gould, Siebert or Ron Rott,
Bowden and Yerman would make
it hot for Stanford.
If the' Indians win, it will be
their 33rd Big Meet victory. A
Cal triumph would be its 29th.
Two meets have ended in ties.

Cal will be tough in the 440,
with Jack Yerman at 47.0 and Stu
Gould at 48.2. Don Chesarek, with
an early-season 47.4 on the first
leg of a relay, could help Stan
ford, but he's looked bad in the
past two weeks and may not even
score.
The two-mile looks like Stan
ford's only sure track victory,
with Maury Graves the class of
an otherwise average field. Cal
has just as much of a cinch in the
highs, now that Cobb is out.
Decision in Field
While the track events should
provide the better marks, the
meet will most likely be decided
in the field. The races have a fair
chance to run close to form, but
picking winners in some of the
jumping and throwing events is
about like finding a needle in a
haystack.
The discus and javelin throw
ers are all inconsistent, foul prone
and the possessors of poor marks.
But —they're about evenly match
ed. and points from there will
count just as much as the points
Lloyd and Bowden score.
Armand DeWeese is Stanford's
principal discus hope, and Harlan
Limmer could also help. In the
javelin, Jim Backstrand may at
last be on the road to a string of
over-200-foot throws, after a 206-8
effort last week. And broad-jump
er Kent Hansen will also take a
whirl with the spear.
Winters Consistent
Jerry Winters is Stanford's key
man in the shot-put. He's consist
ent at 52 feet, and Cal's Mike
Baxter is up and down between
51 and 53, so take it from there.
Hansen, John Kelly and A 1 Pe
terson could all beat John Mer
chant in the broad jump, or could
all lose to him. Stanford needs at
least 8 points here if it is to win
the meet.
Mike Franchetti and Terry Kel
ley are each at 14-0 in the pole
vault, but the Stanford senior
seems more consistent. Franchet
ti is also one of not-too-many In
dians who can rise to the occasion
of tough competition. He's de
fending Big Meet, champ in the
pole vault.
Steve Coughlin is Stanford's
high-jump hope. He's had trouble
with a sore leg and hasn't bet

tered 6-2. But Cal's best is Norm
Garrett at 6-4, so the event is
fairly open.
No Hold-Back in Relay
If the meet hinges on the relay,
Jordan and Hamilton will pull out
all the stops.
Stanford's top team of Cunliffe,
Lloyd, Chesai-ek and Dick Lassen

has turned 3:11.4. Cal hasn't gone
all out in the relay yet, but a team
of Gould, Siebert or Ron Rott,
Bowden and Yerman would make
it hot for Stanford.
If the' Indians win, it will be
their 33rd Big Meet victory. A
Cal triumph would be its 29th.
Two meets have ended in ties.
The finest 880 and mile battles in dual track meet history may be seen tomorrow when Norman
Lloyd of Stanford and Don Bowden of California tangle in the Big Mfct. in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
A crowd of approximately 10,000 is expected to witness the duels between America's only four
minute miler and the 24-year-old Canadian who has captured the fancy of track fans with his Delany-

1i k e style and great finishing
kicks.
Of equal interest will be the
point battle between the Indians
and Bears. California enters the
meet favored, chiefly because of
the presence of sprinter-hurdler
Willie White and the absence of
Stanford captain Chuck Cobb, out
with pneumonia.
Mile at 2 O'Cloek
Lloyd and Bowden are expected
to provide the high points of the
competition. They'll first meet in
the mile at 2 p.m.; then, at 2:50,
they'll have a return match in the
880; and if the meet is still in
doubt they'll probably meet for a
third time at about 3:40 as each
runs the third leg of the mile
relay.
The two individual races are
both toss-ups. Lloyd ran the mile
in 4:06 a month ago and hasn't
gone all-out in the four - lapper
since then. Bowden crui s e d
around in 4:05.8 two weeks ago,
running against USC as did Lloyd.
Best in Country
In the half, Lloyd and Bowden
rank 1-2 in the nation. Lloyd cut
loose with a 1:49.2 against Occi
dental two weeks ago, and Bow
den tore off a 1:49.8 in Seattle six
days ago.
Each man is the best 880-miler
in his school's history. Bowden
has all-time personal and Califor
nia bests of 1:47.2 and 3:58.7, both
run last year. Lloyd's 4:06 and
1:49.2 are his and Stanford's best
ever marks. Meet records of 4:09.9
and 1:50.0, both set in 1957 by
Bowden, aren't expected to last
long.
Just in case Bowden and Lloyd


NORMAN LLOYD
1:49.2, 4:06


DON BOWDEN
1:4!> 8, 4:05.8
are not up to snuff because of go
for-broke efforts in the mile, Cal's
Jerry Siebert will be ready to
challenge Cunliffe in a run for
the tape.
There are very few in the way
of sure winners in other events.
White seems the biggest cinch in
the 100, and he should make it a
triple with low hurdle ;ind 220 vic
tories. His teammate Monte Up
shaw, regaining the speed he had
as a high schooler before tearing
a muscle, could kill Stanford with
seconds and thirds in the same
three events.
Stanford's principal challenger
to White and Upshaw in the
sprints will be sophomore Dean
Smith. Pie started to reach the
realms predicted for him when he
chased Dave James to the tape in
9.6 against UCLA last week.
Smith hasn't been as relatively
fast in the 220, since he has some
trouble with the race on a curve.
But tomorrow's furlong will be on
the straightaway, so Smith may
cut loose with something in the
low 21's.
Anixter a Dark Horse
Another key to Stanford sprint
hopes, especially in the 100, will
be Ben Anixter. He was credited
with a third-place 9.7 against the
Bruins and could help the Tribe
greatly with another third.
Cal will be tough in the 440,
with Jack Yerman at 47.0 and Stu
Gould at 48.2. Don Chesarek, with

Mile at 2 O'Cloek
Lloyd and Bowden are expected
to provide the high points of the
competition. They'll first meet in
the mile at 2 p.m.; then, at 2:50,
they'll have a return match in the
880; and if the meet is still in
doubt they'll probably meet for a
third time at about 3:40 as each
runs the third leg of the mile
relay.
The two individual races are
both toss-ups. Lloyd ran the mile
in 4:06 a month ago and hasn't
gone all-out in the four - lapper
since then. Bowden crui s e d
around in 4:05.8 two weeks ago,
running against USC as did Lloyd.
Best in Country
In the half, Lloyd and Bowden
rank 1-2 in the nation. Lloyd cut
loose with a 1:49.2 against Occi
dental two weeks ago, and Bow
den tore off a 1:49.8 in Seattle six
days ago.
Each man is the best 880-miler
in his school's history. Bowden
has all-time personal and Califor
nia bests of 1:47.2 and 3:58.7, both
run last year. Lloyd's 4:06 and
1:49.2 are his and Stanford's best
ever marks. Meet records of 4:09.9
and 1:50.0, both set in 1957 by
Bowden, aren't expected to last
long.
Just in case Bowden and Lloyd


NORMAN LLOYD
1:49.2, 4:06


DON BOWDEN
1:4!> 8, 4:05.8
are not up to snuff because of go
for-broke efforts in the mile, Cal's
Jerry Siebert will be ready to
challenge Cunliffe in a run for
the tape.
There are very few in the way
of sure winners in other events.
White seems the biggest cinch in
the 100, and he should make it a
triple with low hurdle ;ind 220 vic
tories. His teammate Monte Up
shaw, regaining the speed he had
as a high schooler before tearing
a muscle, could kill Stanford with
seconds and thirds in the same
three events.
Stanford's principal challenger
to White and Upshaw in the
sprints will be sophomore Dean
Smith. Pie started to reach the
realms predicted for him when he
chased Dave James to the tape in
9.6 against UCLA last week.
Smith hasn't been as relatively
fast in the 220, since he has some
trouble with the race on a curve.
But tomorrow's furlong will be on
the straightaway, so Smith may
cut loose with something in the
low 21's.
Anixter a Dark Horse
Another key to Stanford sprint
hopes, especially in the 100, will
be Ben Anixter. He was credited
with a third-place 9.7 against the
Bruins and could help the Tribe
greatly with another third.
Cal will be tough in the 440,
with Jack Yerman at 47.0 and Stu
Gould at 48.2. Don Chesarek, with
an early-season 47.4 on the first
leg of a relay, could help Stan
ford, but he's looked bad in the
past two weeks and may not even
score.
The two-mile looks like Stan
ford's only sure track victory,
with Maury Graves the class of
an otherwise average field. Cal
has just as much of a cinch in the
highs, now that Cobb is out.
Decision in Field
While the track events should
provide the better marks, the
meet will most likely be decided
in the field. The races have a fair
chance to run close to form, but
picking winners in some of the
jumping and throwing events is
about like finding a needle in a
haystack.
The discus and javelin throw
ers are all inconsistent, foul prone
and the possessors of poor marks.
But —they're about evenly match
ed. and points from there will
count just as much as the points
Lloyd and Bowden score.
Armand DeWeese is Stanford's
principal discus hope, and Harlan
Limmer could also help. In the
javelin, Jim Backstrand may at
last be on the road to a string of
over-200-foot throws, after a 206-8
effort last week. And broad-jump
er Kent Hansen will also take a
whirl with the spear.
Winters Consistent
Jerry Winters is Stanford's key
man in the shot-put. He's consist
ent at 52 feet, and Cal's Mike
Baxter is up and down between
51 and 53, so take it from there.
Hansen, John Kelly and A 1 Pe
terson could all beat John Mer
chant in the broad jump, or could
all lose to him. Stanford needs at
least 8 points here if it is to win
the meet.
Mike Franchetti and Terry Kel
ley are each at 14-0 in the pole
vault, but the Stanford senior
seems more consistent. Franchet
ti is also one of not-too-many In
dians who can rise to the occasion
of tough competition. He's de
fending Big Meet, champ in the
pole vault.
Steve Coughlin is Stanford's
high-jump hope. He's had trouble
with a sore leg and hasn't bet

tered 6-2. But Cal's best is Norm
Garrett at 6-4, so the event is
fairly open.
No Hold-Back in Relay
If the meet hinges on the relay,
Jordan and Hamilton will pull out
all the stops.
Stanford's top team of Cunliffe,
Lloyd, Chesai-ek and Dick Lassen

has turned 3:11.4. Cal hasn't gone
all out in the relay yet, but a team
of Gould, Siebert or Ron Rott,
Bowden and Yerman would make
it hot for Stanford.
If the' Indians win, it will be
their 33rd Big Meet victory. A
Cal triumph would be its 29th.
Two meets have ended in ties.
The finest 880 and mile battles in dual track meet history may be seen tomorrow when Norman
Lloyd of Stanford and Don Bowden of California tangle in the Big Mfct. in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
A crowd of approximately 10,000 is expected to witness the duels between America's only four
minute miler and the 24-year-old Canadian who has captured the fancy of track fans with his Delany-

1i k e style and great finishing
kicks.
Of equal interest will be the
point battle between the Indians
and Bears. California enters the
meet favored, chiefly because of
the presence of sprinter-hurdler
Willie White and the absence of
Stanford captain Chuck Cobb, out
with pneumonia.

picking winners in some of the
jumping and throwing events is
about like finding a needle in a
haystack.
The discus and javelin throw
ers are all inconsistent, foul prone
and the possessors of poor marks.
But —they're about evenly match
ed. and points from there will
count just as much as the points
Lloyd and Bowden score.
Armand DeWeese is Stanford's
principal discus hope, and Harlan
Limmer could also help. In the
javelin, Jim Backstrand may at
last be on the road to a string of
over-200-foot throws, after a 206-8
effort last week. And broad-jump
er Kent Hansen will also take a
whirl with the spear.
Winters Consistent
Jerry Winters is Stanford's key
man in the shot-put. He's consist
ent at 52 feet, and Cal's Mike
Baxter is up and down between
51 and 53, so take it from there.
Hansen, John Kelly and A 1 Pe
terson could all beat John Mer
chant in the broad jump, or could
all lose to him. Stanford needs at
least 8 points here if it is to win
the meet.
Mike Franchetti and Terry Kel
ley are each at 14-0 in the pole
vault, but the Stanford senior
seems more consistent. Franchet
ti is also one of not-too-many In
dians who can rise to the occasion
of tough competition. He's de
fending Big Meet, champ in the
pole vault.
Steve Coughlin is Stanford's
high-jump hope. He's had trouble
with a sore leg and hasn't bet

tered 6-2. But Cal's best is Norm
Garrett at 6-4, so the event is
fairly open.
No Hold-Back in Relay
If the meet hinges on the relay,
Jordan and Hamilton will pull out
all the stops.
Stanford's top team of Cunliffe,
Lloyd, Chesai-ek and Dick Lassen

has turned 3:11.4. Cal hasn't gone
all out in the relay yet, but a team
of Gould, Siebert or Ron Rott,
Bowden and Yerman would make
it hot for Stanford.
If the' Indians win, it will be
their 33rd Big Meet victory. A
Cal triumph would be its 29th.
Two meets have ended in ties.
The finest 880 and mile battles in dual track meet history may be seen tomorrow when Norman
Lloyd of Stanford and Don Bowden of California tangle in the Big Mfct. in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
A crowd of approximately 10,000 is expected to witness the duels between America's only four
minute miler and the 24-year-old Canadian who has captured the fancy of track fans with his Delany-

1i k e style and great finishing
kicks.
Of equal interest will be the
point battle between the Indians
and Bears. California enters the
meet favored, chiefly because of
the presence of sprinter-hurdler
Willie White and the absence of
Stanford captain Chuck Cobb, out
with pneumonia.
Mile at 2 O'Cloek
Lloyd and Bowden are expected
to provide the high points of the
competition. They'll first meet in
the mile at 2 p.m.; then, at 2:50,
they'll have a return match in the
880; and if the meet is still in
doubt they'll probably meet for a
third time at about 3:40 as each
runs the third leg of the mile
relay.
The two individual races are
both toss-ups. Lloyd ran the mile
in 4:06 a month ago and hasn't
gone all-out in the four - lapper
since then. Bowden crui s e d
around in 4:05.8 two weeks ago,
running against USC as did Lloyd.
Best in Country
In the half, Lloyd and Bowden
rank 1-2 in the nation. Lloyd cut
loose with a 1:49.2 against Occi
dental two weeks ago, and Bow
den tore off a 1:49.8 in Seattle six
days ago.
Each man is the best 880-miler
in his school's history. Bowden
has all-time personal and Califor
nia bests of 1:47.2 and 3:58.7, both
run last year. Lloyd's 4:06 and
1:49.2 are his and Stanford's best
ever marks. Meet records of 4:09.9
and 1:50.0, both set in 1957 by
Bowden, aren't expected to last
long.
Just in case Bowden and Lloyd


NORMAN LLOYD
1:49.2, 4:06


DON BOWDEN
1:4!> 8, 4:05.8
are not up to snuff because of go
for-broke efforts in the mile, Cal's
Jerry Siebert will be ready to
challenge Cunliffe in a run for
the tape.
There are very few in the way
of sure winners in other events.
White seems the biggest cinch in
the 100, and he should make it a
triple with low hurdle ;ind 220 vic
tories. His teammate Monte Up
shaw, regaining the speed he had
as a high schooler before tearing
a muscle, could kill Stanford with
seconds and thirds in the same
three events.
Stanford's principal challenger
to White and Upshaw in the
sprints will be sophomore Dean
Smith. Pie started to reach the
realms predicted for him when he
chased Dave James to the tape in
9.6 against UCLA last week.
Smith hasn't been as relatively
fast in the 220, since he has some
trouble with the race on a curve.
But tomorrow's furlong will be on
the straightaway, so Smith may
cut loose with something in the
low 21's.
Anixter a Dark Horse
Another key to Stanford sprint
hopes, especially in the 100, will
be Ben Anixter. He was credited
with a third-place 9.7 against the
Bruins and could help the Tribe
greatly with another third.
Cal will be tough in the 440,
with Jack Yerman at 47.0 and Stu
Gould at 48.2. Don Chesarek, with
an early-season 47.4 on the first
leg of a relay, could help Stan
ford, but he's looked bad in the
past two weeks and may not even
score.
The two-mile looks like Stan
ford's only sure track victory,
with Maury Graves the class of
an otherwise average field. Cal
has just as much of a cinch in the
highs, now that Cobb is out.
Decision in Field
While the track events should
provide the better marks, the
meet will most likely be decided
in the field. The races have a fair
chance to run close to form, but
picking winners in some of the
jumping and throwing events is
about like finding a needle in a
haystack.
