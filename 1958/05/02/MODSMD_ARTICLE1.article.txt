# Lloyd-Bowden Battles To Highlight Big Meet
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
The finest 880 and mile battles in dual track meet history may be seen tomorrow when Norman
Lloyd of Stanford and Don Bowden of California tangle in the Big Mfct. in Stanford Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
A crowd of approximately 10,000 is expected to witness the duels between America's only four
minute miler and the 24-year-old Canadian who has captured the fancy of track fans with his Delany-

1i k e style and great finishing
kicks.
Of equal interest will be the
point battle between the Indians
and Bears. California enters the
meet favored, chiefly because of
the presence of sprinter-hurdler
Willie White and the absence of
Stanford captain Chuck Cobb, out
with pneumonia.
Mile at 2 O'Cloek
Lloyd and Bowden are expected
to provide the high points of the
competition. They'll first meet in
the mile at 2 p.m.; then, at 2:50,
they'll have a return match in the
880; and if the meet is still in
doubt they'll probably meet for a
third time at about 3:40 as each
runs the third leg of the mile
relay.
The two individual races are
both toss-ups. Lloyd ran the mile
in 4:06 a month ago and hasn't
gone all-out in the four - lapper
since then. Bowden crui s e d
around in 4:05.8 two weeks ago,
running against USC as did Lloyd.
Best in Country
In the half, Lloyd and Bowden
rank 1-2 in the nation. Lloyd cut
loose with a 1:49.2 against Occi
dental two weeks ago, and Bow
den tore off a 1:49.8 in Seattle six
days ago.
Each man is the best 880-miler
in his school's history. Bowden
has all-time personal and Califor
nia bests of 1:47.2 and 3:58.7, both
run last year. Lloyd's 4:06 and
1:49.2 are his and Stanford's best
ever marks. Meet records of 4:09.9
and 1:50.0, both set in 1957 by
Bowden, aren't expected to last
long.
Just in case Bowden and Lloyd
