# A 						Little Bit of Stanford

### 
\\ hen plans to establish a Stanford study cen
ter in Europe were in the discussion stage we
had high hopes for the contributions such a
center could make toward raising the intellec
tual and cosmopolitan atmosphere of the Palo
Alto campus.
The experience of living and studying in
Europe would, we thought, mature and develop
the 60-odd students selected for the program,
who would in turn introduce some of their
newly-acquired values to the Stanford campus.
But as plans for "Stanford in Germany*'
materialize into realities, it is becoming in
creasingly clear that the Administration's goal
is not to give the students the opportunity to
study under the broadening influence of the
European educational system but to transplant
a little bit of Stanford to the German land
scape.
\\ e hear first that regular Stanford courses,
taught in English by members of the Stanford
faculty, will he offered at Stuttgart. Why travel
7000 miles for this?
We are told that Stuttgart students will live
in the same paternalistic, hygienically-clean
dormitory atmosphere, with the same moral,
American social regulations, as they do at
Stanford.
And now we learn that a Stuttgart student
government has been established and is in the
process of drafting ;i constitution —presumably
to be modeled on the ASSU constitution. The
Stuttgart cabinet will also serve as a judicial
council to insure student observance of those
great pillars of Stanfordian Morality — the
Honor (lode and Fundamental Standard.
I liiis, the old niaxim about "doing as the

Romans," which implies learning from them,
has been cast aside.
Stanford's main purpose in establishing the
Stuttgart campus seems therefore to he to give
I lie benighted Germans a close look at the
American way of doing things—not vice versa.
One can hardly imagine a German university
opening a branch in California offering its
regular courses taught in German, with a few
organized trips into American society for a
curious glimpse at American folkways.
There are quite enough representatives of
the American way of life in Germany as it is.
The "Little Americas* of military housing de
velopments have shown the Germans as much
as they care to see of American life. A group
of Stanford students organized and educated
along German lines woidd be much more valu
able as a means of mutual communication of
ideas and cultural values.
One Stanford professor, while not completely
satisfied with the way the Stuttgart program
has been developing, pointed out that at least
the plan is better than having the students
spend their four college years in the cells of
their Stanford dormitories.
This may be true, for there is certainly a
great deal to be gained from individual travel
alone. But it seems shameful to us to waste
such a potentially valuable educational experi
ence as the Stuttgart venture could offer, for
the sake of continuity, morality, or whatever
excuse the Administration may give.
Vie hope, therefore, that the 63 students
going to Stuttgart for the opening session will
use their individual initiative to explore the
tremendous opportunities of living and travel
ing in Europe.
