Editor, The Daily:
In view of the fact that all diplomatic relations
have failed, Delta Tau Delta feels it necessary to
make a formal declaration of war against the Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity, such war to decide the
question of naval supremacy over Lake Lagunita.
We are currently engaged in construction of
our navy and plan to engage in battle the navy of
Phi Kappa Sigma, the engagement being a battle
between the Phi Kappa Sigma "Aquawazoo" and
the Delta Tau Delta "Monastery." Our navy will
he completed and ready for battle at high noon
on Sunday, at which time we intend to establish

Ihe aforementioned naval supremacy. Any claim
by Phi Kappa Sigma to supremacy over Lake La
gunita must either he forfeited or defended at
this time. Furthermore, it is our suggestion that
the loser of the war of May 4 contribute $15 to
the current Con Home Drive. ,
Interfraternity rules of war shall apply, such
law declaring illegal the use of any methods of
warfare which can possibly inflict permanent
personal injury. This law makes legal the use of
water, paint and verbal exchange.
