# STUDENT GUIDE REPORTS
## Fair Gives Brussels New Look 
### Jack L. Hymans 
Editor's Note: Senior Jack
llymans is currently attending
the Brussels International Ex
position as a guide with the
United Slates exhibit. This is
the first of periodic reports
sent to The Daily, describing
activities at the famous show.

"Brussels 1958!"
A magic phrase to many people.
But what lies behind the magic is
plain, hard work.
The International Exposition
opened here in Brussels on April
17, but the work is just ending
now. Many of the buildings are
not yet completed, and the flowers
are ju-st being put in the grassy
areas of the fairgrounds. Never
theless, Brussels has put on a new
face.
There are about 200 American
guides, of which I am one. The
boys are outnumbered about 5 to
1 by the girls; so the awful Stan
ford ratio is no more for me!
Wide Representation
We guides come from all over
the United States. Many of the
states financed their own guides,
and only a few are here under
State Department auspices.
Some of the guides in the U.S.
pavilion are Europeans. These
guides have been picked because
of the number of languages they
can speak. One of the girls who
works in the American informa
tion section (the department I am
in) speaks five languages flu
ently!
We work six days in succession
and then have a three-day vaca
tion, which is followed by work
for six nights (15 to 11 p.m.).
French Important
"Guiding" means being assign
ed to one of the exhibits, such as
modern art, and helping explain
to the visitors exactly what is in
the exhibition of modern paint
ings and discussing the state of
modern art in the United States.
And remember- all this has to go
on in French quite often!
Many of the U.S. guides are
Negroes. The U.S. pavilion thus
shows that we in the United
States are not all like the people
in Little Rock. And, by the way,
the Little Rock incident is discuss
ed quite often by Europeans, who
question th e American guides
about our way of life in the
States.
Pavilion Imposing
The Russian pavilion, which is
next door to us (with the smaller
pavilion of the Arab states in the
middle), seems imposing from the
outside. The building is m uch
larger than ours, but the Russians
have treated the Fair in a dif
ferent manner.
A large part of the balcony of
the Russian pavilion is devoted to
a display of the beautiful carpets
made in the Turkistan part of
Russia. Also displayed there are
the magnificent Russian furs and.
of course, caviar.
The Russian pavilion also has
an excellent restaurant, which is
"tres chic" compared to our
"brass rail" counter-style snack
bar. Heavy machinery and a mod
el of a Sputnik are on the main
floor.
Many Russians have come to
visit the U.S. pavilion, and little

groups of them surrounding an
interpreter can be noticed in our
pavilion most of the time.
One such group said to me that
I should visit Russia, but when 1
suggested that they pay my way
(since it is quite expensive to
travel there), they very diplomat
ically laughed.
This same tactfulness can be
noticed when one visits the Rus
sian pavilion. When an American
asks a "difficult" question, the
Russian guide (all of whom are
quite older than the American
guides) will act as if he doesn't
understand or j us t laugh. We
have been told, on the other hand.

] to speak with candor about life |
in the U.S.A.
Brussels is already filled with
) visitors, and among these promi
i nent ones who have been in the
American pavilion are two Swed
ish princesses, Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam Paley (he is head of CBS
and she is one of the 10 best
dressed women > and George Na
der, movie actor.
Some of our guides have al
; ready been invited to the many
I receptions which are constantly
taking place. An invitation to a
reception means champagne, de
licious hors d'oeuvres and bril
liant conversation. Needless to

say, we guides prize such invita
tions.
The city of Brussels is very
quaint. It is about three miles to
the center of the city from the
Exposition. In the center one
finds the old market place sur
rounded by 16th and 17th century
guild houses.
The Belgians are quite prosper
ous, and prices are sky-high; some
items are often more expensive
than comparable items in the U.S.
One sees car's all over, and Europe
seems to be becoming more and
more Americanized. As one per
son put it. "There has been a
'Coca-Colanization' of Europe."
