STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA
plans ahead to serve you better


The U. S. will need as much oil in the next 15 years
as it produced in the past century. To locate new
sources of oil and develop known fields, we invested
$280,915,466 last year . . . drilled 968 new wells, oI
which 176 were dry holes.


To help transport more oil and finished products in
the future Standard has placed orders for$148,368,510
worth of new facilities, including 10 supertankers,
greater pipeline capacity and additions to our fleet
of trucks and trailers.


Research helps create now products . . . and new
jobs. During 1957 we had 1400 full-time employees in
research and technical services alone. As a result of
continuing research we now make more than 1,000
products that were not marketed 15 years ago.


While most of Standard's income wont back into
the business, our 148,315 stockholders received about
At for each dollar of stock investment at market value.
Dividends encourage future investments, helping all
business to expand and improve service.


Again last year Standard was one of the West's
largest customers. Our purchases included 50,000
items . . . helped provide employment and payrolls
for more than 10,000 large and small business firms
in hundreds of Western communities. , „ ir


Through affiliates wo also helped advance progress
in more than 70 friendly Eastern Hemisphere coun
tries. Oil development helps local business, provides
employment and supplies funds for education, health
and housing.


v
Economic progress doesn't just happen. Tt, must begin with confident,
long-range planning to meet the challenge of the future.
As we see it, this is the challenge: By 1968 the U. S. will have 202,000,000
people . . . 17% more than today. To sustain this growing population while
raising the standard of living, the nation will require 40% more goods
and services.
That's why last year Standard invested more than ever to help provide the
future products for you and for the security of our country . . . and Standard
will continue to invest, providing jobs and opportunities that can lead to a
