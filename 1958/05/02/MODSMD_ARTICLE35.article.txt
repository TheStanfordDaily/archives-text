# Baseballers Take On Cal in Three Big Games
## 
### 
Stanford and California will put all ihe cards on the table in what
amounts to a three-game baseball series today and tomorrow. Today
at 2 on t+ie Edwards Field diamond, the clubs will continue a 1-1 game
that was halted after 13 innings due to darkness last week.
Immediately after that issue is decided, they'll start a second game.

Then tomorrow at 3:15, the teams
will move down to Ihe Sunken
Diamond for the final game of
the weekend set. The late start
ing time will enable fans at the
Big Meet to also take in the dia
mond Big Game.
Hob Leopold will be the big
man in Dutch Fehring's mound
plans. Leopold was on ihe hill
when last week's game was
called, so he'l pick up right where
he left off.
Unless the playoff goes on for
several hours, Leopold will also
get the nod in the regular game.
Should Leopold tire, Fehring will
have right-hander George Avery
ready to hurl.
Hither Avery or Dick, Williams
will go for Stanford in tomor
row's game, depending on devel
opments today.
Both the Indians and Bears
need three victories 1o slay in ihe
CIBA pennant chase. Stanford is
now a game and one-half behind
league • leading USC, and Cal is
three games behind. The Trojans
and Bruins meet in a homo-arid
home pair this weekend lhat will
have considerable bearing on the
race.
Stanford appears to have an
advantage in the make-up game
today in that the Indians still
have nearly all of their best line
up in the game.
Since Leopold has gone all the
way, Fehring can still bring any
of his other moundsmen into the
game if the situation warrants it.
Cal, however, is already down to
its fourth pitcher, third catcher
and third left-fielder, and doesn't
have much left in the pinch-hil
ling department.
Cal coach George Wolf man fig
ures to bring Kim Ellliott in to
pilch in the make-up, and then I

■5 ,

j- doesn't tire.
Elliott has been a late starter
J throughout his collegiate career,
. | but this is about the time he usu
, ally begins to gain his form.
r Ted Falls, who walked the first
) Iwo Stanford batters and was
I ; then yanked oul of last week's
i game, looks like the probable Cal
•; choice in tomorrow's tilt.
What line-up Fehring will use
is still questionable. He will, of
> course, have to go with the aiign
. I ment that was in action last week
I for the make-up game. If Stan
■ j ford wins, he'll probably carry
! righl on wilh the same line-up.
<; But if Stanford loses, he may

j second game against UCLA last
■ Saturday. Then, he moved A 1
Shaw to the leadoff spot and put
Marry Rodda up to second. Shaw
! responded with two home runs as
Stanford won that one, 11-3.
j Latest Stanford statistics show
j the Indians to still be tightly
j bunched in hilling. Shaw lops
those with a minimum of 50 at
i bats he's batting .318. Jim
I Burk regained the second spot at j
I .310, Ralph Holding is third at
| .307, Joel Newkirk is one point <
behind him. and Ben Robinson is |
I four points over .300.
Harry Rodda is still the big sur-1
; prise, however. Since moving in j
j for' Parker Olsen, Rodda has i
stroked the ball at a .393 clip. He
! was acknowledged to be a good I
defensive player, and Fehring j
hoped lhat his supposedly-weak |
bat wouldn't hurt Stanford's of-1
fense. It hasn't.
After this weekend's games, I
Stanford and Cal will meet once '
j more, on May 20 in the Sunken j

Stanford and California will put all ihe cards on the table in what
amounts to a three-game baseball series today and tomorrow. Today
at 2 on t+ie Edwards Field diamond, the clubs will continue a 1-1 game
that was halted after 13 innings due to darkness last week.
Immediately after that issue is decided, they'll start a second game.

Then tomorrow at 3:15, the teams
will move down to Ihe Sunken
Diamond for the final game of
the weekend set. The late start
ing time will enable fans at the
Big Meet to also take in the dia
mond Big Game.
Hob Leopold will be the big
man in Dutch Fehring's mound
plans. Leopold was on ihe hill
when last week's game was
called, so he'l pick up right where
he left off.
Unless the playoff goes on for
several hours, Leopold will also
get the nod in the regular game.
Should Leopold tire, Fehring will
have right-hander George Avery
ready to hurl.
Hither Avery or Dick, Williams
will go for Stanford in tomor
row's game, depending on devel
opments today.
Both the Indians and Bears
need three victories 1o slay in ihe
CIBA pennant chase. Stanford is
now a game and one-half behind
league • leading USC, and Cal is
three games behind. The Trojans
and Bruins meet in a homo-arid
home pair this weekend lhat will
have considerable bearing on the
race.
Stanford appears to have an
advantage in the make-up game
today in that the Indians still
have nearly all of their best line
up in the game.
Since Leopold has gone all the
way, Fehring can still bring any
of his other moundsmen into the
game if the situation warrants it.
Cal, however, is already down to
its fourth pitcher, third catcher
and third left-fielder, and doesn't
have much left in the pinch-hil
ling department.
Cal coach George Wolf man fig
ures to bring Kim Ellliott in to
pilch in the make-up, and then I

1 use him in the regular game if he
j- doesn't tire.
Elliott has been a late starter
J throughout his collegiate career,
. | but this is about the time he usu
, ally begins to gain his form.
r Ted Falls, who walked the first
) Iwo Stanford batters and was
I ; then yanked oul of last week's
i game, looks like the probable Cal
•; choice in tomorrow's tilt.
What line-up Fehring will use
is still questionable. He will, of

I for the make-up game. If Stan

j second game against UCLA last
■ Saturday. Then, he moved A 1
Shaw to the leadoff spot and put
Marry Rodda up to second. Shaw

Stanford won that one, 11-3.

I .310, Ralph Holding is third at

Harry Rodda is still the big sur-1

Stanford and Cal will meet once '
