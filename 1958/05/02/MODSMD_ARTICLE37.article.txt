# Braves, Papooses Both Will Play Berkeley Opponents
## 
### 
Both the Stanford Braves and
the Stanford Papooses will have
their hands full tomorrow when
they meet University of Califor
nia rivals.
The Braves will send Warren
Nelson to the mound to throw
against Cal's JV's in the morning
game, which is scheduled to get
under way at 10 o'clock at the
Sunken Diamond.
The Braves of late have been j
doing a lot of scoring, having
racked up 7 runs against Menlo
College. 9 against East Contra
Cosla and 18 against Fresno Jun
ior College over the last week.
The Braves will be out to give
Nelson this same sort of hitting
attack to back up his pitching.
The starters for the Braves will
probably hinge on how the varsity J
games at Cal today come out. but
the keystone combination of Fred i
Kober and Bill Tiederman should [
be in the Brave lineup for sure.
.Fay Winter, the Braves' good-hit-!
ting catcher, also should be be- j
hind the plate to catch Nelson's i
hurls.
Coach Mowie Dallmar figures
to use pitcher Nelson as far as he
can go. His bull-pen staff, like
many other positions, will depend
on how man y hurlers varsity
coach Dutch Fehring needs.

At 10 a.m. on the frosh dia
mond the Stanford freshmen take
on the Cal frosh in the final game
of their series. Cal won the first
game, 5-4, in the 10th inning. The
Papooses have the home-team ad
vantage in tomorrow's encounter,
but the game should be close all
the way around.
Southpaw Terry Lindeman will
j be after his third win of the sea
son and hopes to pitch his team
mates to their sixth victory. The
Papooses will call on center-field
er Jim Brandt, shortstop Mike
Filice and second-baseman Eric
Blitz to provide the hitting punch
in tomorrow's game.
