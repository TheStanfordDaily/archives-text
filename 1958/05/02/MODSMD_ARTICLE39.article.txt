# Stanford Netters Seek Second Win Over Bears
## 
### 
Tho second of this season's two
Big Matches will be played today
between the Stanford and Califor
nia tennis teams up at the Cal
Tennis Club in San Francisco.
In the first match of the two
match series the Stanfordites
trimmed their Berkeley oppo
nents by a 7-2 score. In that
match Stanford coach Bob Hon
ker, after his squad had gained
six' singles victories, flooded his
doubles lineup with reserves and
as a result lost two of the three
doubles matches played.
Today Coach Renker will prob
ably use the same strategy, hop
ing to give his reserves some good
doubles experience—provided his
regulars can clinch the victory in
singles play.
Douglas in L.A.
Absent from the Stanford line
up will be Jack Douglas, who will
be down in Los Angeles trying to
make good in the first of a series
of Davis Cup tryouts. Filling in
for Douglas in Stanford's No. 1
singles position will be Brooks

Rawlins, who has been elevated
from his second slot for the
match.
Following Rawlins, Stanford
will probably use a singles lineup
consisting of Dave Nelson, Lowell
Carruth. Jim Jeffries, Gil White
and Robin Hilgeman in the second
through sixth respectively.
In doubles, any one of either
the singles men or several re
serves might be used, depending
on how (he match is going. In
the last Cal match. Coach Renker
paired Gil Ranney and Rob Bow
den from the Stanford reserve list
together in the first doubles spot,
and this combo pulled a slick win
over Cal's top team of Gulden
Lloyd and Jack Elliot.
Many Reserves
Along with these two fine play
ers, Renker also has several other
netters who can perform very
ably, if called on. The most prob
able candidates among these oth
er reserves are Dick Mosk, A 1
Gallaway and Mike Ely.
