nia. however, is just the opposite
and could easily upset the title
holding Stanford swimmers. The
Trojans handed a defeat to Long
Beach City College recently, the

month. USC has top swimmers in
all categories from diving to the
50-yard free style, where they
have men with times of 23.1, 23.5
and 23.8.
Stanford will use the regular
meet lineup against UCLA but

the PCC record of 48.9 and feels
assured he can pour on the steam
if need be. Trojan Ron Senera
