# OK'D BY HOUSE
## Ike Wins On Jobless Relief Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON 1 (/P) — The tug
of war over how to fight the re
cession produced an Eisenhower
victory on jobless relief and a
call from Secretary of Labor
Mitchell yesterday for a decision
about tax cuts within 30 to 60
days.
The House voted 370-17 for the
administration plan for tempo
rary expansion of the state-han
dled unemployed compensation
systems.
It did so after junking 223-1615
a rival proposal which would
have set up outright relief grants
from a $IV2 billion federal fund.
Republicans and conservative
Southern Democrats, who agreed
with President Eisenhower that
grants would be a dole, handed
him the victory.
Eisenhower's Plan
The Eisenhower plan calls for
a 50 per cent extension of the
time in which insured workers
could collect benefits, or an addi
tional 13 weeks in most states.
States would eventually pay the
$600 million cost by means of pay
roll taxes or otherwise.
The tax suggestion by Secre
tary Mitchell amounted to pro
posing a deadline that would be
reached no later than June 30.
He told a news conference, de
voted to the question of how to
overcome the recession, that he
sees no solid improvement ahead.
At the same time, Mitchell said
he agrees with Eisenhower that
the recession seems to be flat
tening out.
Mitchell's Suggestions
Secretary Mitchell suggested
his deadline in these words:
"If there is a bolstering of the
economy necessary—and that de
termination has to be made rea
sonably soon—then, as opposed to
any other form of government ac
tion, such as a large-scale public
works program, I would favor a
tax cut.
"I think a decision should be
made reasonably soon as to what
needs to be done. I think within
the next 30 to 60 days."
