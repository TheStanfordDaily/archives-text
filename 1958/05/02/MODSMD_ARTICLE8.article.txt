### 
Stanford trustee Herman Phleger stressed the important role of
the. legal profession in supporting free government in a lecture to
Stanford law students yesterday.
Phleger, a member of the San Franicsco Bar, spoke on the topic
of "Law. Lawyers and the Practice of Law" in recognition of Law

Day.
Phleger compared the tradi
tional celebration of May Day in
the Communist world to the cele
bration of Law Day in the West
ern world.
In comparing the law systems
of the Communist and Western
worlds, he said, "To Communism,
the state is the end and the law
is the handmaiden." To the West
ern world, the individual and his
liberty and well being is the cen
tral object of law. Government is
only the mechanics set up to se
cure those ends. Law governs
both the government and the in
dividual."
"The lack of a bridge between
Communism and the Western
world . . . has made progress in
the rule of law in international
affairs difficult indeed," Phleger
pointed out. Though 43 nations
agree to the compulsory jurisdic
tion of the World Court, the So
viet and satellite nations refuse
to recognize its authority.
"World opinion is not yet
strong enough to cause govern
ments to accept the rule of law,
in practice, although they pro
claim it in theory. To reach
world peace all nations must
agree to impartial examination.
Lawyers must take (he lead in
the formation of a forceful public
opinion that will bring about this
result."
