# Poet Laureate
## Frost Will Speak Today In Mem Aud Program 
### 
"So I was once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of
going, back to be," said Robert Frost in one of his most famous
poems, "Birches."
Although "America's poet laureate" may never have realized his
dream, he has communicated his visions, knowledge and vivid obser-

vations of man and nature to mil
lions of readers in the last two
generations.
This afternoon at 4:15 in Memo
rial Auditorium students will
have the privilege of meeting the
"swinger of birches" in person.
Frost plans to read some of his
work with a running commen
tary. The program includes old
favorites "Birches" and "Stopping
by Woods," as well as newer po
ems "Bound Away," "All We Call
Americans" and "No Dog Is for
Long."
Scientific Sonnets
Two scientific sonnets, "Why
Wait for Science" and "Thcreal
izing" will also be read.
Frost has promised to discuss
his forthcoming book and may
even title it during his discussion.
The universal appeal of Frost's
poetry is perhaps due in part to
his varied life. Born in San Fran
cisco, Frost moved with his moth
er to New England when he was
ten years old.
After 25 years of experience in
New England including work in
a woolen mill and two years at
Harvard University, the poet
moved to Buckinghamshire, Eng
land.
Unsuccessful
His poetry was unsuccessful in
America. It remained for the
English reviewers to acclaim
Frost's first book, "A Boy's Will,"
published in 1913.
His memories of New England
appeared a year later in "North
of Boston," which insured his po
etic career and caused him to be
acclaimed as a leader of "the new
era in American poetry" when he
returned to this country in 1915.
On a tour of the British Isles
last June, the four-time Pulitzer
Prize winner received honorary
degrees from Oxford, Cambridge,
Durham and the University of
Ireland.
Today will be Frost's first visit
to the campus since 1953. He will
speak in Berkeley Thursday and
Friday.

Today will be Frost's first visit
to the campus since 1953. He will
speak in Berkeley Thursday and
Friday.


ROBERT FROST: "SWINGER OF BIRCHES"
Leader of a New Era in U.S. Poetry
"So I was once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of
going, back to be," said Robert Frost in one of his most famous
poems, "Birches."
Although "America's poet laureate" may never have realized his
dream, he has communicated his visions, knowledge and vivid obser-

vations of man and nature to mil
lions of readers in the last two
generations.
This afternoon at 4:15 in Memo
rial Auditorium students will
have the privilege of meeting the
"swinger of birches" in person.
Frost plans to read some of his
work with a running commen
tary. The program includes old
favorites "Birches" and "Stopping
by Woods," as well as newer po
ems "Bound Away," "All We Call
Americans" and "No Dog Is for
Long."
Scientific Sonnets
Two scientific sonnets, "Why
Wait for Science" and "Thcreal
izing" will also be read.
Frost has promised to discuss
his forthcoming book and may
even title it during his discussion.
The universal appeal of Frost's
poetry is perhaps due in part to
his varied life. Born in San Fran
cisco, Frost moved with his moth
er to New England when he was
ten years old.
After 25 years of experience in
New England including work in
a woolen mill and two years at
Harvard University, the poet
moved to Buckinghamshire, Eng
land.
Unsuccessful
His poetry was unsuccessful in
America. It remained for the
English reviewers to acclaim
Frost's first book, "A Boy's Will,"
published in 1913.
His memories of New England
appeared a year later in "North
of Boston," which insured his po
etic career and caused him to be
acclaimed as a leader of "the new
era in American poetry" when he
returned to this country in 1915.
On a tour of the British Isles
last June, the four-time Pulitzer
Prize winner received honorary
degrees from Oxford, Cambridge,
Durham and the University of
Ireland.
Today will be Frost's first visit
