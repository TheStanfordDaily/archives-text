# Carps to Cut Capers
## 
### 
Carps swimming up the stream of life will fly in front of the
Union today at the same time that hundreds more will be seen all
over Japan.
These paper kites or flags in the form of fish mark the celebra
tion of Children's Day, a national Japanese holiday, and will be
raised by members of the Keio Affiliation Committee, exchange
group whose purpose here is to introduce a little of Japan to Stan
ford.
Tadashi Sakurai, Keio exchange scholar from Tokyo, explained
the holiday originated from an old Japanese legend that the carp,
because it can swim against the stream, is a symbol of strength.
In the hope that young Japanese boys would grow strong and
become good soldiers, symbols of this fish were flown on Boys'
Day. This celebration was later combined with Girls' Day, March
3, to become the present Children's Day.
Sakurai further explained that the kites are usually flown from
poles, in descending size with a very large one at the top.
For tomorrow, I lie committee will fly one seven-foot-long kite
and four smaller ones. Japanese music will provide an appropriate
background.
Stanford student Byron Marshall is currently attending Keio
University on the committee's exchange program.
