# IFC COUNCIL
## Plan Passed To Enforce Liquor Law 
### 
Interfraterniay Council passed
a proposal Thursday to give the
IFC Judicial Committee the pow
er to investigate fraternity houses
with frequent spot checks for
beer and liquor.
Punishment for a violation
would be social probation for the
remainder of the present quarter
and the subsequent quarter plus
10 Corporation Yard hours per ac
tive member. Non - conformance
with penalties would result in au
tomatic suspension.
Neal Scheidel, newly elected
IFC president, said fraternities
are opposed to present University
regulations preventing alcoholic
beverages in fraternity houses
and feel it would be for the gen
eral welfare if beer were allowed
on campus.
The fraternities opposed a situ
ation which gave the fraternities
the responsibility of regulations,
but left the authority of enforce
ment in the hands of the adminis
tration.
The proposal was passed with
the idea that the regulations
would be better enforced and the
fraternities would be better able
to argue for their ideas and pur
poses, according to an IFC
spokesman.
