# Why Elect a Yell Leader?
## 
### 
Tin: writf-ix campaign which gave Evangelist
Hilly Graham 416 votes for head yell leader in
last week's final elections has been condemned
in some quarters as childish, impious, a waste
of votes and worse. But, apart from the ques
tion of religious propriety, we can see nothing
wrong with "wasting votes" in an election
which is-little more than a popularity contest.
Why the head yell leader should be elected
at all is a mystery to us. No other ASSU posi
tion requires a more clear-cut qualification—
that of the ability to lead yells. This is the only
consideration which should influence the selec
tion of a veil leader, and this selection could
be best made by a tryouts committee.
The head yell leader position differs from
other ASSU offices in that there is no voter
representation involved. The yell leader has
no responsibility to represent students' wishes

as do, for example, members of Legislature—
oilier than the general responsibility to lead
loud and clever yells.
We have heard the complaint tbat by ap
pointing the head yell leader "a member of
the same fraternity might get the job year after
year." So what? The person with the best
qualifications should he chosen, regardless of
which living group he belongs to. or how many
friends he has.
The Billy Graham campaign might be in
terpreted as a reaction against the position in
which most students find themselves—that of
having to vole for a head yell leader whose
ability to lead yells is unknown to them.
Viewed in this light, the "childish" write-in
campaign was not so childish after all; 416
students merely voted for a person whose po
tential yell-leading abilities were better known
to them than were those of other candidates.
