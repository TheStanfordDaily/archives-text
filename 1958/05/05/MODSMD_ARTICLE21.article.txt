Include a German University Term
Editor, The Daily:
I think that anyone who has harl the oppor
tunity of studying in Europe will agree with the
general sentiments expressed in Friday's edi
torial on the Stuttgart program. Nonetheless,
there are many positive aspects of ihe program,
particularly for students with inadequate lan
guage preparation and for sophomores.
The leaders of this program have expressed
the wish to have the Stuttgart graduates remain
in Europe for a longer period before returning
to Stanford. In view of this, I see no reason for
so timing the Stuttgart sessions as to effectively
prevent the graduates from enrolling in a Ger
man university where they would be able to earn
credits transferable to Stanford.
German universities operate on a two-semester
plan; the summer semester lasts from May
through July, the winter semester from Novem
ber through February, The Stuttgart terms r un
from June to Christmas and from January to
June. The Stuttgart graduate would have to wait
about four and a half months before he could
enroll in a German university.
The reason given me for this timing was to
allow each Stuttgart session a part of the "good"
weather period. Good weather is the lea-st thing
which northern Europe can offer to Stanford stu
dents. I believe the program's directors should
consider a shifting of their time plans one quar
ter forward to enable the participants in the
program to combine their Stuttgart introduction
to Germany and the German language with a
period of full participation in German life at a
German university.
In conclusion, if the program were to include
one term at Stuttgart and one semester at a
German university, most of the valid objections
to a "Stanford in Germany" would be overcome.

Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to see your comments about Stan
ford-in-Germany. ... I notice, however, that sev

eral of your objections are based only on half the
truth.
First, you correctly observe that some Stanford
courses will be taught by a few of the Stanford
faculty. Rut the most important single course
will be Intensive German, taught by a German
faculty. In addition, the courses taught in Eng
lish will be geared to the area in which we are
living.
The value of this plan is great. It allows sopho
mores to participate, thus allowing the least pos
sible disruption of a student's program. Junior
standing is required in any European university.
Too, several students are planning to enter a
European university after attending the study
center. In addition, there will be no question of
credit when we are back at Stanford.
Secondly, any social regulations which we have
at Stuttgart will have been set up by the STU
DENT group itself as necessary for our own
enjoyment and protection on the trip. They are
Ihe minimum we thought we had to have. They
can be changed at any time when a majority of
the group thinks it wise.
Likewise, ihe so-called constitution is no more
than an informal working arrangement geared
to the details of governing our group and to asso
ciation with other German student groups. It
was drawn up with one thought in mind: what
organization Stanford-in-Germany needs to oper
ate successfully. Neither our Stanford constitu
tion nor a German constitution was referred to
when we drafted our tentative constitution.
I was surprised to see you question the Funda
mental Standard. Accepting the risk of being
flubbed another freshman red-hot, let me observe
that, as I understand it, Stanford cannot give
anyone the Fundamental Standard. Each student
must have it when he enters the University. We
merely operate under an agreement to observe it.
Would it, indeed, be wise to throw all morals and
ethics to the winds while living in Europe?
Whether we attend Stanford-in-Germany or the
Free University of Berlin, we will be judged as
Americans. Whether the individual student likes
it or not, we have a responsibility to bolh Stan
ford and the United Slates; it cannot be met by
discarding our manners, morals and ethics. . . .

Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to see your comments about Stan
ford-in-Germany. ... I notice, however, that sev

eral of your objections are based only on half the
truth.
First, you correctly observe that some Stanford
courses will be taught by a few of the Stanford
faculty. Rut the most important single course
will be Intensive German, taught by a German
faculty. In addition, the courses taught in Eng
lish will be geared to the area in which we are
living.
The value of this plan is great. It allows sopho
mores to participate, thus allowing the least pos
sible disruption of a student's program. Junior
standing is required in any European university.
Too, several students are planning to enter a
European university after attending the study
center. In addition, there will be no question of
credit when we are back at Stanford.
Secondly, any social regulations which we have
at Stuttgart will have been set up by the STU
DENT group itself as necessary for our own
enjoyment and protection on the trip. They are
Ihe minimum we thought we had to have. They
can be changed at any time when a majority of
the group thinks it wise.
Likewise, ihe so-called constitution is no more
than an informal working arrangement geared
to the details of governing our group and to asso
ciation with other German student groups. It
was drawn up with one thought in mind: what
organization Stanford-in-Germany needs to oper
ate successfully. Neither our Stanford constitu
tion nor a German constitution was referred to
when we drafted our tentative constitution.
I was surprised to see you question the Funda
mental Standard. Accepting the risk of being
flubbed another freshman red-hot, let me observe
that, as I understand it, Stanford cannot give
anyone the Fundamental Standard. Each student
must have it when he enters the University. We
merely operate under an agreement to observe it.
Would it, indeed, be wise to throw all morals and
ethics to the winds while living in Europe?
Whether we attend Stanford-in-Germany or the
Free University of Berlin, we will be judged as
Americans. Whether the individual student likes
it or not, we have a responsibility to bolh Stan
ford and the United Slates; it cannot be met by
discarding our manners, morals and ethics. . . .

Editor, The Daily:
I was glad to see your comments about Stan
ford-in-Germany. ... I notice, however, that sev

eral of your objections are based only on half the
truth.
First, you correctly observe that some Stanford
courses will be taught by a few of the Stanford
faculty. Rut the most important single course
will be Intensive German, taught by a German
faculty. In addition, the courses taught in Eng
lish will be geared to the area in which we are
living.
The value of this plan is great. It allows sopho
mores to participate, thus allowing the least pos
sible disruption of a student's program. Junior
standing is required in any European university.
Too, several students are planning to enter a
European university after attending the study
center. In addition, there will be no question of
credit when we are back at Stanford.
Secondly, any social regulations which we have
at Stuttgart will have been set up by the STU
DENT group itself as necessary for our own
enjoyment and protection on the trip. They are
Ihe minimum we thought we had to have. They
can be changed at any time when a majority of
the group thinks it wise.
Likewise, ihe so-called constitution is no more
than an informal working arrangement geared
to the details of governing our group and to asso
ciation with other German student groups. It
was drawn up with one thought in mind: what
organization Stanford-in-Germany needs to oper
ate successfully. Neither our Stanford constitu
tion nor a German constitution was referred to
when we drafted our tentative constitution.
I was surprised to see you question the Funda
mental Standard. Accepting the risk of being
flubbed another freshman red-hot, let me observe
that, as I understand it, Stanford cannot give
anyone the Fundamental Standard. Each student
must have it when he enters the University. We
merely operate under an agreement to observe it.
Would it, indeed, be wise to throw all morals and
ethics to the winds while living in Europe?
Whether we attend Stanford-in-Germany or the
Free University of Berlin, we will be judged as
Americans. Whether the individual student likes
it or not, we have a responsibility to bolh Stan
ford and the United Slates; it cannot be met by
discarding our manners, morals and ethics. . . .
