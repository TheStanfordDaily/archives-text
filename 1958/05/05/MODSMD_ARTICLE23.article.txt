## IIR Plans Institute on U.S. Policy 
### Steve Freidberg 
The Institute of International
Relations will establish a new tra
dition at Stanford next week, the
Foreign Policy Institute, which
will run May 15 and 16.
This is the first time such an
undertaking has been attempted,
and if successful it will become
an annual event, according to
Craig Barnes, IIR president.
Five hundred dollars has been
appropriated by ASSU and an
equal amount by the University
to make the Institute possible.
"The Effectiveness of United
States World Leadership as Im
plemented Through Her Foreign
Policy" will be the topic which
will be broken up into various
areas in the discussion groups
and speeches.
Political Correspondent
James Rest on, internationally
famous political correspondent
and head of the New York Times
Washington Bureau, will be the
featured speaker. He will talk at
Memorial Auditorium Thursday
evening at: 8 and Friday afternoon
at 4:15.
Five discussion groups will be
held after the talk Thursday and
will be moderated by Stanford
professors who are experts in the
political and historical fields.
No definite topics have been as
signed Ihese groups ,so they can
be adapted to the ideas Rest on
presents. However, each profes
sor will direct the general discus
sion in his group in his own field.
As seminars will be kept small,
sign ups will be required for par
ticipation. Lectures in Mem Aud
are to be open to everyone.
The idea for the Foreign Policy
Institute originated last year
when Barnes decided that the lIR
was not fulfilling one of its prin
cipal functions, making Stanford
students aware of world prob
lems.
Seminar Groups
The lIR executive committee
concluded that the best way to
correct this would be lectures by
competent speakers presenting
analytical accounts of foreign af
fairs. These lectures would be
followed by small seminar groups
under the guidance of faculty
members.
The lIR hopes to establish a
chair for guest lecturers if the
Institute proves successful. This
would assure a fund to obtain
well-known speakers and make
the Institute permanent.
Tony Springer, lIR political
analyst, is chairman of the event.
Other members of the committee
are Phil Nelson, Jean Van De
venter, Sarah Tilton, Stu Pollak
and Jill White.

States World Leadership as Im
plemented Through Her Foreign
Policy" will be the topic which
will be broken up into various
areas in the discussion groups
and speeches.
Political Correspondent
James Rest on, internationally
famous political correspondent
and head of the New York Times
Washington Bureau, will be the
featured speaker. He will talk at
Memorial Auditorium Thursday
evening at: 8 and Friday afternoon
at 4:15.
Five discussion groups will be
held after the talk Thursday and
will be moderated by Stanford
professors who are experts in the
political and historical fields.
No definite topics have been as
signed Ihese groups ,so they can
be adapted to the ideas Rest on
presents. However, each profes
sor will direct the general discus
sion in his group in his own field.
As seminars will be kept small,
sign ups will be required for par
ticipation. Lectures in Mem Aud
are to be open to everyone.
The idea for the Foreign Policy
Institute originated last year
when Barnes decided that the lIR
was not fulfilling one of its prin
cipal functions, making Stanford
students aware of world prob
lems.
Seminar Groups
The lIR executive committee
concluded that the best way to
correct this would be lectures by
competent speakers presenting
analytical accounts of foreign af
fairs. These lectures would be
followed by small seminar groups
under the guidance of faculty
members.
The lIR hopes to establish a
chair for guest lecturers if the
Institute proves successful. This
would assure a fund to obtain
well-known speakers and make
the Institute permanent.
Tony Springer, lIR political
analyst, is chairman of the event.
Other members of the committee
are Phil Nelson, Jean Van De
venter, Sarah Tilton, Stu Pollak
and Jill White.
The Institute of International
Relations will establish a new tra
dition at Stanford next week, the
Foreign Policy Institute, which
will run May 15 and 16.
This is the first time such an
undertaking has been attempted,
and if successful it will become
an annual event, according to
Craig Barnes, IIR president.
Five hundred dollars has been
appropriated by ASSU and an
equal amount by the University
to make the Institute possible.
