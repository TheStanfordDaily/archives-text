# Card 9 Loses 2 of 3
## 
### Russ Allen 
In one of the strangest week
end series over played between
Stanford and California baseball
teams, ihe Card varsity found it
self on the short end as it beat
Cal f!-l Friday, but lost to the
Bears 6-3 Friday and 6-4 Satur
day.
The two losses virtually
knocked Stanford out of the run
ning for the CIBA pennant, since
loop-leading USC increased its
lead to 3 games by whipping UC
LA twice.
The win Friday came in the
14th inning of a game begun
April 25 at Berkeley. Tied at 1-1
after 13, the Indians jumped on
Cal hurler Tim Elliot and batted
around, collecting five runs and
three hits.
Lefty Bob Leopold, who doub
led in the 14th to aid his own
cause, walked the Bears' Bob Puc
cinelli, then proceeded to set the
Cal hitters down in order to take
his sixth victory of the season.
Leopold Relums-
Leopold then started the night
cap. This time Cal batters weren't
so easy on him as they pounded
out eight hits and collected five
runs before George Avery came
in on relief in ihe fifth.
Saturday on the Sunken Dia
mond Stanford's Dick Williams
started against Cal's Elliot. Cal
again started right out by tally
ing once in the first frame.
Cards Tie Count.
Stanford bats came to life in
Ihe filth inning, finally getting to
Bear hurler George Sterling who
had relieved the injured Kim El
liot. Avery led off with a single
followed by a double by Joel New
kirk. Burk singled to left and
scored Avery.
Dave Dow got on through a
fielder's choice and after Rodda
struck out, A] Shaw hit a tremen
dous line shot over Ihe left field
wall. It was his third home run
in eight days and tied it up, 4-4.
The game was tight until the
ninth inning when Cal worked
Avery for Ihree walks and a
scratch infield single to score
two runs. It was a heart-breaker
for Avery to lose for up until the
ninth he had pitched six hitless
and scoreless innings.
