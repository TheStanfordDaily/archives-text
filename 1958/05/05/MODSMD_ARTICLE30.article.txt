# BEARS SURPRISE
## Stanford Whips Cal Tennismen 
### John Schwarz 
Withstanding some unbeliev
able play by California's tennis
team and a very cold San Fran
cisco day, the Stanford varsity
netters rallied to pull out a 6-3
victory over their Berkeley oppo
nents.
Tour of Stanford's singles men
were forced to go three sets
against their Cal opponents, but
in every case but one, the much
steadier Indians gained easy
third-set triumphs.
Rawlins Looks Good
Brooks Rawlins, substituting
for Jack Douglas in the first sin
gles spot, was one of the few In
dians to play top-quality tennis.
Rawlins, who uses a very easy
going style of play in making a
minimum of steps count, was in
rare form Friday and showed
outstanding timing as he whipped
Gulden Lloyd with numerous lop
spin ground strokes and a good
service game.
Along with Rawlins in the look
good category was Robin Ililge
man, playing number six. Hilge
man disposed of Paul Cohen in
easy style and finished the match
and second set to the tune of a
6-0 rout.
Three-Setters
Lowell Carruth, Gil White and
Jim Jeffries each won three-set
ters. Carruth and White both had
slow starts, losing their opening
sets, but had very little trouble in
putting on the steam to win the
next two sets and their matches.
Dave Nelson was Stanford's
only singles casualty as he lost a
tough three-setter to Cal's Shel
don Diller.
