# Golfers Nipped
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team
lost two heartbreakers to the link
sters from USC and UCLA this
past week end in Los Angeles. It
was barely nosed by the strong
Trojans, 14V2-12V 2 , on Friday and
then dropped an even closer deci
sion to the Bruins Saturday, 14-13.
The two dual matches had no
effect, however, on the team's
status in the newly formed con
ference. All nine schools of the
PCC will play on the Stanford
course May 23 and 24 to deter
mine the first league champion.
The dual matches are just prep
aration for this event.
