# West Plans Strategy for NATO Talk

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (/P)
—Secretary of Stale John Foster
Dulles and British Foreign Secre
tary Selwyn Lloyd met privately
yesterday, on the eve of a NATO
conference, to map ways of coun
tering Russia's new tough line
threatening summit prospects.
Dulles and Lloyd, with their
colleagues in the 15-nation North
Atlantic Alliance, must review
the West's position in the light of
the Soviet Union's bleak refusal
to accept an American proposal
for an Arctic aerial inspection sys
tem.
That Russian action in the
United Nations last week cast a
long shadow on the prospects for
a meaningful top-level meeting of
East and West. In the eyes of
the West the Russians have re
jected a logical first step toward
worldwide disarmament.
The NATO foreign ministers—
assembling in Copenhagen for a
three-day conference beginning
today — privately had doubts
whether the Russians would dis
cuss basic causes of world ten
sions even in the preliminary ne
gotiations designed to lead on to
the summit.
Stepping from his plane, Lloyd
told newsmen the foreign min
isters will re-examine the West
ern approach to the summit in
the light of Russia's rejection of
Arctic aerial inspection. Britain,
he said, wants a summit confer
ence "if something useful can be
achieved and if it is properly pre
pared" but docs not want to par
ticipate in a propaganda circus.
