# Health Service Offers Flu Shots
## 
### 
Asian flu shots arc being given
without charge at the Health
Service from 1 to 4 p.m. One
booster is needed for those who
have had shots or flu since last
fall. Others need two shots, ten
days apart.
Physicians at the Health Serv
ice strongly advise all students to
get shots now as the second wave
of Asian flu is due next autumn.
