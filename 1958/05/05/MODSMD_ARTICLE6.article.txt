Collections from the Con Home Drive are expected to reach be
tween $8500 and $9000 as final solicitations and money from campus
activities continue to roll in.
Even though returns are somewhat short of the goal set for this
year's Drive, Ray York, business manager for the event, still feels

pleased with the results.
Ho explained that while the ac
tual income was lower than an
ticipated, more people took an in
terest in the Drive than in past
years.
"Both on-campus and off-cam
pus activities were more enthu
siastically undertaken. Off-cam
pus solicitors did a good job, and
visited as many homes as before,
but because of the present reces
sion, people haven't been contrib
uting as much to charity per
house," he continued.
On-campus activities wound up
Friday afternoon with a record
smashing crowd attending the
sophomore-sponsored Carnival at
Mama Garcia's. Carnival co-chair
man Sue Chalberg estimated that
more than 1150 people attended.
"Einil Fiscli"
The Theta Delts' "Emil Fisch,"
a five-fool-long house pet termed
"boa constrictor," was crowned
King of Con Home Week at the
Carnival, while the Phi Sigs' can
didate, "Sapphire Schmook," was
coronated queen. Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald YVinbigler pre
sided over coronating activities.
The royal pair were awarded
long-playing records.
Many of the activities broke old
records, both in participation and
contributions. One of the most
successful events was Wednes
day's "Strawberry Brunch,''
which sold out of strawberry
shortcake two hours early and
had to resort to selling ice cream
and cake. Making over $700, the
event smashed last year's record
by more than $100.
Second Place
Something new in this year's
Drive was the Marlboro - Parlia
ment Contest. The Alpha Sigs
placed first in the cigarette-pack
collections, turning in 320 packs.
Seventy-five dollars was contrib
uted to the Drive in their name.
Placing second was Stern I with
262 packs. According to Bob Free
len, who headed the contest, $35
was awarded in their name.
Another heavy contributor to
the Drive was the King and
Queen Contest. Over $800 in pen
nies was collected through vot
ing.
Some winners have not yet
been announced. The freshman
couples collecting the most contri
butions off campus have not been
determined. Winners in the nu
merous sports tournaments will
be decided next week, as oppo
nents continue to meet in athletic
contests.
Numerous contributions from
outside this area have begun to
come in as a result of the 20-sec
ond television spots currently be
ing run.
