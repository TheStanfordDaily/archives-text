# Lloyd Falls To Bowden; Bears Win
## 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
Don Bowden out kicked Norman
Lloyd in the final 220 of their
heralded Big Meet mile battle Sat
urday and set the tempo for the
Bears as they smothered Stan
ford, 83-46, before 12,500 fans in
Stanford Stadium. It was the
largest Big Meet crowd in 30
years.
Bowden, Ernie Cunliffe and
Willie White were the biggest he
roes of a day that saw four meet
records broken and one tied, in
addition to a raft of best-of-life
performances.
The Bowden-Lloyd battle was a
classic. Bowden immediately took
the lead and Lloyd fell in step
just off Bowden's right shoulder.
They ran like that for three and
one-half laps, hitting quarter-mile
fractions of 58.7, 2:00.5 and
3:04.3.
Widens Gap
In the backs!retch on the final
lap, Bowden held off the first
phase of Lloyd's kick. On the
last turn, he widened the gap to
five yards, then pulled steadily
away in the home stretch as the
rugged pace told on Lloyd.
Bowden's winning 4:03.5 was
the fastest outdoor mile in the
U.S. this year, and smashed his
own meet record of 4:09.9.
Lloyd's 4:05.3 was his best-of-life,
and will be recognized as a new
Stanford school record.
The return battle which was
supposed to take place in the 880
never materialized, since Indian
coach Pay ton Jordan had to save
Lloyd for the relay after anchor
man Don Chesarek pulled a mus
cle in the 440.
Cunliffe Surprises
But even without Lloyd, the
half-mile was another great race.
Cunliffe was supposed to be the
rabbit, with Bowden and perhaps
Jerry Siebert of the Bears expect
ed to pull ahead in the final 150
yards.
Cunliffe forgot to let the Bears
go past. He won the race on the
third 220, blazing it in 27.0 and
opening a 12-yard gap on Bow
den.
By the time Bowden unleashed
his kick, Cunliffe was long gone.
He finished with a best-ever
1:50.2, and gained the distinction
of being the first runner ever to
defeat Bowden at 880 yards.
Three Wins for Willie
White picked up 15 of Califor
nia's points with firsts in the 100,
220 and low hurdles. His 9.5 in
the 100 tied the eight • year - old
meet record.
Other meet records went to
Maury Graves in the two-mile,
Jack Yerman in the 440 and Terry
Kelley in the pole vault.
Graves led an Indian sweep in
the eight - lapper with a 9:18.1,
1.7 seconds under Bob House's
year-old record. Yerman's 47.5
in the quarter knocked out Gro
ver Klemmer's 47.6, which had
stood since 1941.
Stanford rose to the occasion in
the javelin, sprints and two-mile,
but points there couldn't come
close to offsetting Cal's 1-2 fin
ishes in six events.
Kent Hansen decided to throw

the spear before jumping, ami he
got off a winning Ihrow of 200
feet. Jim Backstrand was less
than a foot hack, and grabbed the
second.
Dean Smith ami Norm Pease
came through with 2-3 finishes in
the sprints. Each clocked 21.4 in
the furlong, the best either has
ever run.
