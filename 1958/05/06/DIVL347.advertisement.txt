SWEENEY IN THE TREES
Spring is here—the season of tree-sitting contests. This I ap
pliiud. Tree-sitting is healthful and jolly and as American as
apple pie. Also it keeps you off the streets.
Tree-sitting is not, however, without its hazards. Take, for
example, the dread and chilling case of Manuel Sigafoos and
Ed Sweeney, both sophomores at the Nashville College of Folk
Music and Woodworking, and both madly in love with a beau
tiful alto named Ursula Thing, who won their hearts singing
that fine old folk song, I Strangled My True Love with ller Own
Yellow Braids, and I'll Sever Eat Her Sorghum Any More.
Both Manuel and Ed pressed Ursula to go steady, but she
could not choose between them, and finally it was decided that
the boys would have a tree-sitting contest, and Ursula would
belong to the victor. So Manuel and Ed clambered up adjoin
ing aspens, taking with them the following necessaries: food,
clothing, bedding, reading matter, and—most essential of all —
plenty of Marlboro Cigarettes.
YYc who live on the ground know how nnich you get to like
with a Marlboro. Think how much more important they must
be to the lonely tree-dweller—how much more welcome their
fine, mild tobacco; how much more gratifying their free-drawing
filters; how much more comforting their sturdy, crushproof
flip-top box. Climb a tree and see for yourselves.
SITTING CONTEST^
Well supplied with Marlboros, our heroes began their tree
sitting contest—Manuel with good heart, Ed with evil cunning.
Tlie shocking fact is that crafty Ed, all unbeknownst to Manuel,
was one of three identical triplets. Each night while Manuel
dozed on his bough, one of Ed's brothers—Fred or Jed—would
sneak up the tree and replace him. "How can I lose?" said Ed
with a fiendish giggle to his brother Fred or Jed.
Hut Ed had a bi<i surprise coming. For Manuel, though
lie did not know it himself, was a druid! He had been abandoned
an infant at the hut of a poor and humble woodcutter named
Cornelius YVhitney Sigafoos 111, who had raised the child as
his own. So when Manuel got into the tree, he found much to
his surprise that he had never in all his life felt so at home
and happy. He had absolutely no intention of ever leaving.
After seven or eight years Ed and his brothers wearied of the
contest and conceded. Ursula Thing came, to Manuel's tree
and cried, "1 am yours! Come down and pin me."
Hut Manuel declined. Instead he asked Ursula to join him
in the. tn>e. This she could not do, being subject to mopcry
(a morbid allergy to woodpeckers), so she ended up with Ed
after all.
Only she made a mistake—n very natural mistake. It was
Jed, not Ed, with whom she ended up.
Ed, heartbroken at being tricked by his own brother, took
up metallurgy to forget.
