# WILL BOMB
## Indonesians To Continue Rebellion 
### 
SINGAPORE (/P) —The Indone
sian rebels, beaten down in Cen
tral Sumatra, said yesterday their
planes based in North Celebes
will bomb key Indonesian cities
in continuing the fight. A rebel
broadcast said foreign vessels
must not go to any ports in Java
or East Indonesia and may be
sunk if they do.
The radio, broadcasting from
an undisclosed location, said the
Javanese cities of Jakarta, Sura
baya, Bandung and Semarang
should expect air attacks. The
people of Makassar, capital of
South Celebes, were warned to
stay away from military targets.
A radio statement by Rebel In
terior Minister lahlan Djambek
said the rebels will fight on with
three principles at stake: free
dom, belief in God and the wel
fare of the Menangbakau people.
Into Jungles
The warning of new air raids
came as the rebels were being
driven into the jungles of Central
Sumatra, where the revolutionary
regime of Premier Sjafruddin
Prawiranegara was proclaimed in
mid-February. Government troops
yesterday took Bukittinggi, the
rebels' mountain capital.
The whereabouts of Sjafrud
din's cabinet and the young colo
nels loyal to it were uncertain.
The rebel leaders set up head
quarters at Batusangkar in the
Central Sumatran jungles when
Bukittinggi was threatened two
weeks ago. There have been re
ports that the leaders fled from
Central Sumatra to North Cele
bes, 1800 miles to the east, where
military officers revolted against
Jakarta even before Sjafruddin's
regime was proclaimed.
Invasion Fleet
Word in Jakarta was that the
rebels in North Celebes will be
the government's next objective
and that an invasion fleet is pre
paring to sail. Loyalists freely
forecast that Menado, the capital,
will be taken by assault before
the end of this month.
President Sukarno and Premier
Djuanda have charged American
soldiers of fortune and Chinese
Nationalists are flying rebel
planes. The Nationalists have de
nied the charge and President Ei
senhower said last week he does
not believe any Americans are
flying for the rebels.

SINGAPORE (/P) —The Indone
sian rebels, beaten down in Cen
tral Sumatra, said yesterday their
planes based in North Celebes
will bomb key Indonesian cities
in continuing the fight. A rebel
broadcast said foreign vessels
must not go to any ports in Java
or East Indonesia and may be
sunk if they do.
The radio, broadcasting from
an undisclosed location, said the
Javanese cities of Jakarta, Sura
baya, Bandung and Semarang
should expect air attacks. The
people of Makassar, capital of
South Celebes, were warned to
stay away from military targets.
A radio statement by Rebel In
terior Minister lahlan Djambek
said the rebels will fight on with
three principles at stake: free
dom, belief in God and the wel
fare of the Menangbakau people.
Into Jungles
The warning of new air raids
came as the rebels were being
driven into the jungles of Central
Sumatra, where the revolutionary
regime of Premier Sjafruddin
Prawiranegara was proclaimed in
mid-February. Government troops
yesterday took Bukittinggi, the
rebels' mountain capital.
The whereabouts of Sjafrud
din's cabinet and the young colo
nels loyal to it were uncertain.
The rebel leaders set up head
quarters at Batusangkar in the
Central Sumatran jungles when
Bukittinggi was threatened two
weeks ago. There have been re
ports that the leaders fled from
Central Sumatra to North Cele
bes, 1800 miles to the east, where
military officers revolted against
Jakarta even before Sjafruddin's
regime was proclaimed.
Invasion Fleet
Word in Jakarta was that the
rebels in North Celebes will be
the government's next objective
and that an invasion fleet is pre
paring to sail. Loyalists freely
forecast that Menado, the capital,
will be taken by assault before
the end of this month.
