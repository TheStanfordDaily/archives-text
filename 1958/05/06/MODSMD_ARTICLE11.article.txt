# BRUNCH, CARNIVAL RECORDS
## Con Home Receipts Rise, $11,000 In, More Coming 
### 
Gross receipts of the Con Home Drive have grown to $11,000, and
contributions are still rolling in, with proceeds of some of the ac
tivities not yet counted.
The total jumped $2000 yesterday with some of the new receipts
being counted and chances are good that the drive will reach the

highest-ever goal of $12,000 set
for the campus solicitation.
A breakdown of funds shows
that the Carnival, with more than
$380, and the Strawberry Brunch,
with a total of $702, made more
money than ever before.
Off-campus solicitations totaled
$6668.07. Support was not as
great for on-campus funds as an
ticipated. Officials report that
$840 was solicited from living
groups. Of this, $100 was donated
by Troncos, a Wilbur wing.
Showing of "The Claw" netted
$322, with the car wash yielding
$316.50 and the King and Queen
contest contributing $944.11.
Champions of the Women's
Row Car Wash are the women
of Hurlburt, who have been
awarded a keg of beer for their
hard work.
