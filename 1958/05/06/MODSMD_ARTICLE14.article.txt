# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW'
## The 						Pearl Harbor Complex 
### Walter Lippmann 
At the United Nations last: Tuesday, Mr. Ham
ma rskjold said the basic reason why no progress
is being made on disarmament is that there is a
"crisis of trust from which all mankind is suf
fering at the present juncture." It is reflected,
he went on 1o say, "in an unwillingness to take
any moves in a positive direction at their face
value . . . because of a fear of being misled."
This surely is the heart of the matter, an«l we
may take it that our Arctic bomber flights, which
Mr. llammarksjold referred to as "the present
slate of extreme preparedness," reflect an abso
lute mistrust in tlie intensions of the Soviet
Union. Mr. Lodge in the same debate spelled ont
(his mistrust, which actuates our military policy,
by saying that "the awesome destructive power
of modern armaments makes it at least theoreti
cally possible to wipe out the military capacity
of a state —even one of (he great powers —in a
single attack. But such an attack must come
without warning if it is to succeed."
The proposals for international inspection in
Ihe Arctic zone are based on the theory that the
inspectors could detect the preparation for a
super-attack and could, therefore, nullify the
danger of an all-out and absolute Pearl Harbor.
Our remedy, in short, for the mistrust we have
of Soviet intentions is to put a great deal of trust
in an inspection system.
If I read Mr. Hammarsk.jold's remarks cor
rectly, he thinks that if the Soviet Union and the
United States would make an agreement to set
up an Arctic inspection system, this would reflect
a state of mind in which other agreements might
then he reached. Certainly inspection as such —
which would be, as the saying goes, "fool-proof"
—is not in the cards. It the will exists and the
means exist to deliver the absolute knockout, no
system of inspectors can prevent it.
to to *
The real guarantee against a super-Pearl Har
bor is that the means do not exist, and therefore
the will to attempt it cannot exist. It is not neces
sary in this situation to trust the Russian inten
tions. It is necessary only to have trust in Rus
sian sanity. In Mr. Lodge's remarks which I have
already quoted, ihe key words are that it is "the
oretically possible" to strike a knockout blow.

But is it even theoretically possible to do that
now? Not according to the director of Central
Intelligence, Allen Dulles, who said in an address
last week that "as I see it, under its present
policies, the U.S.S.K. does not intend to use its
military power in such a way as to risk general
war." Why not? Because "they have a healthy
respect for our retaliatory capability."
We have a right to think that Allen Dulles does
not believe it is now even "theoretically possible"
to knock out our retaliatory capacity. For, as he
sairl in the next paragraph, we must be ever
watchful of military developments "in order to
anticipate any attempts at a break-through which
would change the balance of military power."
Until and unless there is such a technological
break-through, there exists a balance of military
power which is a true deterrent to a Pearl
Harbor.
>.i if -If
In the last analysis, a more flexible policy on
our part does not depend upon putting trust in
the intentions of the Soviet Union. It depends
upon our putting trust in their ability to read
correctly the balance of power.
The rest of Mr. Dulles' address reinforces this
view. He dwelt at length and in rich detail upon
the spectacular success of the Soviet Union in
promoting its own industrial development, and
with the prospect that in the course of a genera
tion the Soviet industrial capacity may catch up
with our own. Is it likely that with such pros
pects the Kremlin will risk everything on the
very theoretical possibility that it could knock
out the United States?
The moral of this argument is that, having
taken all the necessary precautions to protect our
retaliatory power, we should resolve our Pearl
Harbor complex. It paralyzes our military think
ing and it stultifies most of our diplomacy. We
should instead, conscious of our own security,
address ourselves to the great fact of our era
that in almost every field of human endeavor we
are pressed by the competition of a new and ex
traordinarily powerful social order.

The real guarantee against a super-Pearl Har
bor is that the means do not exist, and therefore
the will to attempt it cannot exist. It is not neces
sary in this situation to trust the Russian inten
tions. It is necessary only to have trust in Rus
sian sanity. In Mr. Lodge's remarks which I have
already quoted, ihe key words are that it is "the
oretically possible" to strike a knockout blow.

But is it even theoretically possible to do that
now? Not according to the director of Central
Intelligence, Allen Dulles, who said in an address
last week that "as I see it, under its present
policies, the U.S.S.K. does not intend to use its
military power in such a way as to risk general
war." Why not? Because "they have a healthy
respect for our retaliatory capability."
We have a right to think that Allen Dulles does
not believe it is now even "theoretically possible"
to knock out our retaliatory capacity. For, as he
sairl in the next paragraph, we must be ever
watchful of military developments "in order to
anticipate any attempts at a break-through which
would change the balance of military power."
Until and unless there is such a technological
break-through, there exists a balance of military
power which is a true deterrent to a Pearl
Harbor.

In the last analysis, a more flexible policy on
our part does not depend upon putting trust in
the intentions of the Soviet Union. It depends
upon our putting trust in their ability to read
correctly the balance of power.
The rest of Mr. Dulles' address reinforces this
view. He dwelt at length and in rich detail upon
the spectacular success of the Soviet Union in
promoting its own industrial development, and
with the prospect that in the course of a genera
tion the Soviet industrial capacity may catch up
with our own. Is it likely that with such pros
pects the Kremlin will risk everything on the
very theoretical possibility that it could knock
out the United States?
The moral of this argument is that, having
taken all the necessary precautions to protect our
retaliatory power, we should resolve our Pearl
Harbor complex. It paralyzes our military think
ing and it stultifies most of our diplomacy. We
should instead, conscious of our own security,
address ourselves to the great fact of our era
that in almost every field of human endeavor we
are pressed by the competition of a new and ex
traordinarily powerful social order.

At the United Nations last: Tuesday, Mr. Ham
ma rskjold said the basic reason why no progress
is being made on disarmament is that there is a
"crisis of trust from which all mankind is suf
fering at the present juncture." It is reflected,
he went on 1o say, "in an unwillingness to take
any moves in a positive direction at their face
value . . . because of a fear of being misled."
This surely is the heart of the matter, an«l we
may take it that our Arctic bomber flights, which
Mr. llammarksjold referred to as "the present
slate of extreme preparedness," reflect an abso
lute mistrust in tlie intensions of the Soviet
Union. Mr. Lodge in the same debate spelled ont
(his mistrust, which actuates our military policy,
by saying that "the awesome destructive power
of modern armaments makes it at least theoreti
cally possible to wipe out the military capacity
of a state —even one of (he great powers —in a
single attack. But such an attack must come
without warning if it is to succeed."
The proposals for international inspection in
Ihe Arctic zone are based on the theory that the
inspectors could detect the preparation for a
super-attack and could, therefore, nullify the
danger of an all-out and absolute Pearl Harbor.
Our remedy, in short, for the mistrust we have
of Soviet intentions is to put a great deal of trust
in an inspection system.
If I read Mr. Hammarsk.jold's remarks cor

United States would make an agreement to set
up an Arctic inspection system, this would reflect
a state of mind in which other agreements might
then he reached. Certainly inspection as such —
which would be, as the saying goes, "fool-proof"

promoting its own industrial development, and
with the prospect that in the course of a genera
tion the Soviet industrial capacity may catch up
with our own. Is it likely that with such pros
pects the Kremlin will risk everything on the
very theoretical possibility that it could knock
out the United States?
The moral of this argument is that, having
taken all the necessary precautions to protect our
retaliatory power, we should resolve our Pearl
Harbor complex. It paralyzes our military think
ing and it stultifies most of our diplomacy. We
should instead, conscious of our own security,
address ourselves to the great fact of our era
that in almost every field of human endeavor we
are pressed by the competition of a new and ex
traordinarily powerful social order.

At the United Nations last: Tuesday, Mr. Ham
ma rskjold said the basic reason why no progress
is being made on disarmament is that there is a
"crisis of trust from which all mankind is suf
fering at the present juncture." It is reflected,
he went on 1o say, "in an unwillingness to take
any moves in a positive direction at their face
value . . . because of a fear of being misled."
This surely is the heart of the matter, an«l we
may take it that our Arctic bomber flights, which
Mr. llammarksjold referred to as "the present
slate of extreme preparedness," reflect an abso
lute mistrust in tlie intensions of the Soviet
Union. Mr. Lodge in the same debate spelled ont
(his mistrust, which actuates our military policy,
by saying that "the awesome destructive power
of modern armaments makes it at least theoreti
cally possible to wipe out the military capacity
of a state —even one of (he great powers —in a
single attack. But such an attack must come
without warning if it is to succeed."
The proposals for international inspection in
Ihe Arctic zone are based on the theory that the
inspectors could detect the preparation for a
super-attack and could, therefore, nullify the
danger of an all-out and absolute Pearl Harbor.
Our remedy, in short, for the mistrust we have
of Soviet intentions is to put a great deal of trust
in an inspection system.
If I read Mr. Hammarsk.jold's remarks cor
rectly, he thinks that if the Soviet Union and the
United States would make an agreement to set
up an Arctic inspection system, this would reflect
a state of mind in which other agreements might
then he reached. Certainly inspection as such —
which would be, as the saying goes, "fool-proof"
—is not in the cards. It the will exists and the
means exist to deliver the absolute knockout, no
system of inspectors can prevent it.
to to *
The real guarantee against a super-Pearl Har
bor is that the means do not exist, and therefore
the will to attempt it cannot exist. It is not neces
sary in this situation to trust the Russian inten
tions. It is necessary only to have trust in Rus
sian sanity. In Mr. Lodge's remarks which I have
already quoted, ihe key words are that it is "the
oretically possible" to strike a knockout blow.

But is it even theoretically possible to do that
now? Not according to the director of Central
Intelligence, Allen Dulles, who said in an address
last week that "as I see it, under its present
policies, the U.S.S.K. does not intend to use its
military power in such a way as to risk general
war." Why not? Because "they have a healthy
respect for our retaliatory capability."
We have a right to think that Allen Dulles does
not believe it is now even "theoretically possible"
to knock out our retaliatory capacity. For, as he
sairl in the next paragraph, we must be ever
watchful of military developments "in order to
anticipate any attempts at a break-through which
would change the balance of military power."
Until and unless there is such a technological
break-through, there exists a balance of military
power which is a true deterrent to a Pearl
Harbor.
>.i if -If
In the last analysis, a more flexible policy on
our part does not depend upon putting trust in
the intentions of the Soviet Union. It depends
upon our putting trust in their ability to read
correctly the balance of power.
The rest of Mr. Dulles' address reinforces this
view. He dwelt at length and in rich detail upon
the spectacular success of the Soviet Union in
promoting its own industrial development, and
with the prospect that in the course of a genera
tion the Soviet industrial capacity may catch up
with our own. Is it likely that with such pros
pects the Kremlin will risk everything on the

out the United States?
