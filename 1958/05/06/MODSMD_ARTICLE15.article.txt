Editor, The Daily:
Why shouldn't I join in the demonstrations to
halt H-bomb testing?
(1 > The radicals who are conducting the dem
onstrations have no idea of the consequences 1o
our country if these demonstrations were to
"snowball"! They haven't even considered the
important political aspects of our continued nu
clear testing. Don't they realize that Ihe AEC
wants to stop ihe tests as soon as if is feasible?
Don't they Ihe Government credit for know
ing many important facts about nuclear testing
which are not public? Don't they realize that our
representatives are interested in preserving hu
manity also, and that they are doing the best
things for our nation and our people?

(2) Why don't the radicals make a solid pro
posal? Thoy argue, "Let's stop testing, because
we'll destroy our civilization if we don't." That's
ridiculous! Nuclear testing is only one minute
phase of our atomic defense! Why don't they
propose a plan to abolish nuclear armaments?
Oh, I see—they hadn't thought of that:!!
(3) If you, as an intelligent person and a
Stanford student, still aren't convinced that you
should remain out of the demonstrations, then
take a look at the screwballs who are leading
ihom! Purple peggers, beards, pink «uede shoes,
turquoise jackets—yes, that's right, radicals all
the way! Communists, socialists, conscientious
objectors and atheists. Need I say more? They
aren't leaders! They're social misfits!!
