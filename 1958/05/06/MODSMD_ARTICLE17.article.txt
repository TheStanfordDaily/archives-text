# EXPERIMENT
## Music Hostel To Feature New System 
### 
A new kind of hostel, allowing
more time for individual discus
sion and study if it is desired, will
be tried when Ralph Haber and
Elliot Aronson lead the group on
"Music, Conversation and Relaxa
tion" on May 17-18.
A large percentage of the time
at this outing will be devoted to
listening to records with discus
sions on the music. This is the
final hostel of the year and its ex
perimental nature will allow a
greater percentage of the time for
conversation off the particular
topic of the group itself.
There are still a few places left
for the outing this weekend, "An
Invitation to Creativity" with
Jeffrey Smith of the Humanities
Department and Willis Harmon,
Electrical Engineering, leading
the discussions.
Both the final hostels will be
held at Jones Gulch YMCA camp.
The cost for food and lodging is
$3.
This has been by far the most
successful year in the eight-year
history of the hostel program and
next year's budget, just submit
ted to the ASSU Financial Office,
will double the hostel appropria
tion.
Tentative plans for next year,
announced by Hostel Chairman
Dick Coffing, will increase the
number of outings from 12 to at
least 24 and give greater oppor
tunities for campus organiza
tions, clubs and religious groups
to arrange private hostels for
their members.
