Now that the tlusl from the Big- Meet and the entire dual and tri
angular portion of ihe Stanford track schedule has settled, it's pos
sible to make an evaluation of .just how the Indian spikers are stack
ing up, especially in relation to last year's club.
On the strict point record, it looks as though Stanford has taken
a backward step in Pay ton Jordan's second year on the job. Last
spring, the Cards held Cml, Oxy and USC to identical 72-59 victories.
This year, Cal and the Trojans hit 85 and 8(J points respectively, and
the Tigers were close behind with 78 1 .;.
The meets with IJC'LA and Fresno were amazingly similar each
year. The Bruins hit in the 80's both times, and it took a relay vic
tory to heat Fresno each year, s.m .lose, the Olympic Club, and Santa
Clara Youth Village all lost to Stanford both years, but the meets
were too early in the season to

be of much significance.
So now the question is whether
or not these scores are a suffi
eient index of the two clubs'
abilities. And il looks from here
like the answer is an emphatic
No. The best way to show that
Stanford is really making plenty
of improvement is to cook up an
imaginative dual meet between
the 1957 team and the 1958ers,
For the purposes of this imagi
nary battle, we'll assume men
who ran with both teams to be
separate entries: i.e., Maury
Graves '57 will be running against
Maury Graves '58. Normal doub
les and triples will be assumed,
but we won't have Norman Lloyd
running everything from the 440
up. Now, on with the meet.
The first track event, the mile,
produces an easy victory for
Lloyd ('5B). If Graves doubles,
he runs 2-3 in the four-lapper.
Other wise it's Bob Monzingo ('5B)
second and Doug Martin third.

Right now, the '57 .Martin would got the place, but in another week
or two ,the '58 Martin should get it.
The quarler-mile has the two most unpredictable runners of the
meet Don Chesarek ('57) and Chesarek ('5B). Still, the '58 version
should win with Dick Lassen C5B) a strong third.
Along about now the shot-put results come in, and it's a 12
finish for Ihc '58 team with Jerry Winters and Chris Plain. The
light for third is close, but we'll flip a coin and give it to Kay Wil
liamson C 57).
Now Ihey're on their marks in Ihe 100. Dean Smith ('5B) has a
good lead al the 50-yard mark, and coasts in for the win. Frank
Herrmann comes up with his usual closing rush to get second for
the '57 team, and Norm Pease and Ben Anixter fight for the third
spot. Either way, the '58ers get the point and lead 28-8 after four
events.
The '57 takes up some of the slack as Phil Fehlen and Ron Bondoc
go one-two in the high jump. Steve ('5B) gels the show
point. The 120-yard highs come next, and produce a victory for
Chuck Cobli ('5B) over an outstanding hurdler by the same name
who ran last year. Bernie Nelson ('57) gets third.
Lloyd W ins in Meet's Top Race
Best race of the day, the 880, comes next, and it produces nine
more points for the team of '58. Lrnie Cunliffe sets the pace for
6GO yards, but Lloyd comes on strong after his easy mile victory and
wins the sprint for Ihe tape. Lassen nips a faltering Joe Woollett
for third. Score: 13-20.
More field results come in now—this time from the broad jump
pit. And the winner is Herrmann with a leap of better than 25 feet.
Kent Hansen ('5B) gets Ihe second spot, and Hansen of '57 comes
through on the last jump to beat John Kelly ('5B) for third.
The current'team gets some points back in the 220 as Smith and
Pease run one-two, with Herrmann's kick coming too late to get any
more than third.
Pole-vault results are the next to come to the announcer's booth,
and they show eight more points for the '58ers. Mike Franchetti and
ihe rapidly-improving John Stabler make it a one-two finish, and the
Franchetti of a year ago gets the show point.
Graves has no trouble beating himself in the two-mile, but the
big fight is for third, where Monzingo nips Van Luchene*. The six
additional points give the currents a 68-31 bulge, and cinch the meet
for them.
Hank lloldan and Kirk Nieland go 1-2 in the javelin although it's
too late to win the meet for the '57 team. Jim Baekstrand comes
close to Nieland for the second, but has to be content with third.
The lows go almost the same way as the highs, with this year's
Cobb again beating himself to the tape. Len Bates also runs as two
entries, but last year's version gets Ihe third in a photo finish.
Fred Peters and Archie Kchmitt go 1-2 in the discus for the '57
club, but it's a toss-up for thiiVl among all the present throwers.
The relay isn't much contest. Lassen, Cunliffe and Lloyd open
up such a big lead over Bill Carls-, Chuck Ince and Herrmann that
Chesarek doesn't have any trouble running the anchor lap for both
teams. The final margin is 30 yards; the final point score is 80-51.
Twenty-nine points is a fairly conclusive margin; we'll string
along with the current track team as a darned good improvement
over last year's.
