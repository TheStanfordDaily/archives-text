Part II of tlie Stanford tVack
season begins Saturday at Fresno
when Hie Indians go 1o the West
Coast Relays. It will be the first
of the series of weekly relay and
invitational spike carnivals which
will lead through ihe PCC cham
pionships and on to the NCAA
meet.
Whether captain Chuck Cobb
will be in good enough shape to
hurdle at Fresno is still an unde
cided question. Cobb was out of
the hospital Saturday to see the
Big Meet, and reports that he is
feeling all right.
Needs Leg Drive
Cobb's principal problem will
be building up the driving power
in his legs. Conditionwise, he
shouldn't be bothered by Ihe
week's lay-off. More pictures of
his lung will be taken tomorrow,
and will form the basis for the
final decision on his Saturday's
activities.
Coach Payton Jordan will hold
