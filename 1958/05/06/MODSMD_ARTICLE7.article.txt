# Avoid Materialism, Poet Frost Warns
## 
### Dave Quarles 
"All human life is made up of
Enterprise and the Great Misgiv
ing," Robert Frost warned his
listeners yesterday afternoon.
The unofficial poet laureate of
America spoke to a large audi
ence in Memorial Auditorium and
read his own poetry. Today he
will attend a seminar and give an
informal talk to a group of se
lected students in the Bender
Room in the afternoon. Also ten
tatively on his schedule is a visit
to the Theta Delta Chi house of
which he was a member in his
college days at Dartmouth.
Frost explained the misgiving
as the fear that "meaning" is lost
in enterprise and that in its pur
suance, enterprise itself often
loses and "meaning."
The poet said that these two
vital components, Enterprise and
Misgiving, originated near the
Aegean Eea and spread east and
west from that point.
"The Misgiving was too much
for Enterprise in the East, and
Asia reacted with inaction. How
ever, the West took up Enter
prise, plunging itself deeper and
deeper into the material," Frost
said.
Great Danger
Frost explained that the great
danger of cultivating materialism
is the danger of losing the spirit.
Frost said he saw the proof of
the problem's seriousness in his
experiences. "Everywhere I go
people are worrying about being
lost in materialism.
"The danger is greatest in grad
uate school. Often students in
graduate school lose confidence
when they realize they are lost in
the material. At least they are
honest," the poet said.
Risk Spirit •
However, supreme merit lies in
risking spirit in substantiation,
Frost added. "God's own descent
into the flesh is a wonderful ex
ample of risking spirit in sub
stantiation."
Frost explained that in a simi
lar manner the poet risks his
spirit in writing poetry. He has
to dare to put his spirit in mate
rial words. Only when he fails is
he a materialist.
During the remainder of his
speech, the poet read some of his
works with passing comments.
Mysterious- Treatment
Before reading "Stopping by
Woods on a Snowy Evening,"
Frost observed that the Saturday
Review had recently run an ar
ticle on the poem and had "dealt
with it kindly, but rather myste
riously."
In connection with this idea, he
remarked that his poems have
three meanings: "My obvious
meaning, my implied meaning
and the third meaning these fel
lows deal with in class."
"I want the first two meanings,
but I don't want a poem to lie
spoiled with the third," Frost
said.
Explaining that he liked to
tease about science, Frost read
two of his Scientific Sonnets:
"Why Wait for Science?" and
"Therealizing." The latter of the
two spoofed evolution, concluding
that man would eventually be a
blob of brain jellv by the sea.
