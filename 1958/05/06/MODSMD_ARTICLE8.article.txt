# Student Music Performed
## 
### 
Compositions by five Stanford
music students were performed
this weekend at the Composers'
Symposium held at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, an annual event
bringing together musicians from
eight California colleges and uni
versities.
Stanford was represented by
Natalie Jenne, Jesse Parker, Rob
ert MacKinnon, Elanor Ogden and
Alec Horak.
Miss Jenne's "Kyrle," sung by
six members of I lie Chorale, is
the first movement of a projected
Mass for a small choir. Miss

Jenne, a harpsichord student,
considers composing an avoca
tion and is particularly interested
in church choral music.
In her composition, Miss Jenne
thinks she has been influenced
mostly by Hindemith, although
she says that each musical period
has certain characteristics which
are found in all works of that
time.
Her other compositions include
a suite of carols, settings for two
Blake poems and a couple of
piano pieces.
Parker, who performed his own
piano sonata, said he felt the con
cept of music of students of other
universities attending the sym
posium was that of a "brewing
Bohemianism" coming from their
"innermost bowels." He discounts
the glamour attached to musi
cianship. feeling that it is "just
labor fascinating labor, but an
intellectual process, not an emo
tional process."
In writing his sonata, Parker
followed the Stanford policy of
"neo-classicism," the logical de
velopment within a set form of
a "drive leading somewhere." In
order for the listener to share in
the musical experience, the com
position must have certain points
of orientation within the form.
MacKinnon, active in the cam
pus choral organizations, present•

Ed "Chamber Cantata," a song
cycle characterized by "realism."
Although the writing was meant
for voices, the cycle was per
formed instrumentally.
"Lament for Whitsunday" by
Elanor Ogden, former editor of
Sequoia, was given in the Friday
concert. It is a song for harpsi
chord, tambourine, recorder and
voice.
Also performed Friday was a
composition for harp, played by
Ann Henderson, written by for
mer Stanford student and com
poser Horak.

Parker, who performed his own
piano sonata, said he felt the con
cept of music of students of other
universities attending the sym

the musical experience, the com
position must have certain points
of orientation within the form.
