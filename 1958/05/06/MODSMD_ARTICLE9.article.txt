# Indian Bones Found at VA Hospital Site
## 
### 
The remains of an Indian bur
ial ground, which may prove to
be of historical significance to the
Bay Area, have been uncovered at
the site of the new Veterans Ad
ministration Hospital.
Professor Bert A. Gerow, as
sociate professor of anthropol
ogy, said three burials, skeletons
with burial ornaments, were re
cently uncovered when excava
tion began for the new hospital.
The site is on government land at
the southwest end of the Indus
trial Park.
Gerow said the value of the
find is yet to be determined. Since
the property belongs to the Vet
erans Administration, govern
ment permission must be ob
tained for the anthropologists to
dig on the land. He added thai
he is waiting for further investi
gation before pressing for the
necessary permission.
The anthropologist said the re
mains so far recovered are not
in good condition. He added that
what is believed to be the burial
area is at present under 15 feet
of topsoil, which will later be
moved for landscaping use.
Remains of Indian villages
some 3000 years old have been
discovered in the Bay Area, Ge
row said, but none from the pe
riod of the early Spanish explor
ers have been found. He ex
plained that anthropologists have
been seeking signs of the latter
period in order to trace the de
velopment of the civilization of
the Coastal Indians who inhabit
ed the area.
Whether the present discovery
will prove of historical value re
mains to be determined, Gerow
said.
