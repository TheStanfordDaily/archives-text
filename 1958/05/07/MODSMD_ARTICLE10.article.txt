# SENIOR PREFERENCE
## Women to Draw Tomorrow For 1958-59 Residences 
### 
Women will draw for 1938-59 residences tomorrow, according to
the AWS Housing Committee.
Drawing will be from 9 a.m. until noon and from 1 to 4 p.m. down
stairs in the Women's Clubhouse. All women must draw, or they
will be placed at the bottom of the list for residences.

Under the recently passed
housing program, as many as
four women may draw together.
Placement will be with senior
preference filling up to two-thirds
of any house, with the remainder
to be filled first with juniors de
siring to live there and then with
sophomores.
The Housing Committee listed
the following vacancies in resi
dences caused by women leaving
the University through gradua
tion, marriage or other reasons:
Florence Moore, total 135;
Alondra, 11; Cardenal, 13; Fai
san, 13; Gavilan, 17; Loro, 19;
Mirlo, 30; Paloma, 32.

rand, 14; Guthrie, 25; Hurlburt,
22; Jordan, 19; Lathrop, 15; Roth,

The Housing Committee noted
that other vacancies will occur ac
cording to the number of sopho
mores and juniors drawing out of
a residence.
Class status for drawing will be

determined by units or quarters,
whichever gives the woman the
greater advantage.
A student returning to the Uni
versity after an absence is to be
placed at the bottom of her class
on shrinkage.
