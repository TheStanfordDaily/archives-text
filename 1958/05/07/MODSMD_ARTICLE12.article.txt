## Settling immigrants is Big Achievement, Says Israeli 
### Steve Freidberg 
The small Middle East country
of Israel is celebrating one of the
biggest events in its history, the
loih anniversary of its founding
as an independent nation.
The festivities, which began on
Independence Day, April 24, will
continue for a year and include
parades, dancing and more sol
emn observances.
Israeli and Jewish students at
Stanford arc also paying tribute
to this anniversary tonight when
Avram Biran, Israeli consul gen
eral from Los Angeles, will speak
at the Women's Clubhouse audi
torium at 8. The talk will be fol
lowed by a social hour of discus
sion and refreshments.
Student Comments
Some comments about Israel
after 10 years of existence have
been made by Shmuel Sharir, a
graduate student from Tel Aviv,
who feels Americans should know
more about Israel than border
wars.
According to Sharir, the big
gest achievement of his country
is the settlement of the more than
one million immigrants who have
come there.

"They have coine from 72 coun
tries varying in background from
high European culture to cave
dwellers in North Africa. Wo
have a pressure cooker instead of
a melting pot. There isn't time to
gradually mix into one civiliza
tion, so we have to do it rapidly."
Desert Change
The second achievement has
been the development of tho No
gev Desert which occupies over
two-thirds of the country, he said.
Without this development and
the natural resources obtained
from it, Israel could not survive.
"The agricultural expansion
has been almost enough to sup
ply the needs of the country. Also
industry has increased tremen
dously. With these lias gone a
big housing and education pro
gram," he added.
Sharir mentioned the Weilz
mann Institute, which is a world
famous research center in phys
ics, chemistry and engineering, as
an example of the progress made
in the scientific field.
lie thinks the problems be
tween Israel and Arab states can
be settled "when the Arab coun
tries sit down, look at things with

reality and see that they must
accept Israel."
Refugee Problem
One big problem, he admit led,
are the 900,000 Arab refugees
who had to leave Israel in 1918
when the country was formed;
hut in his opinion they would be
an even greater problem it they
had remained. One hundred fifty
thousand Israelis were driven out
of Arab lands and their property
confiscated, so both sides have
something to talk over.
"Most of Israel was unsettled
land. What was developed is due
to Israeli efforts; if hasn't been
done by the Arabs. He also gave
credit to American Jews who by
their efforts and money have
helped make this progress pos
sible.
For the future. Sharir said Is
rael's hope is to stabilize I hp econ
omy and become self-sufficient.
The greatest wish of the Israeli
people is, as expressed by some
grammar school children in an
essay contest on the future, am
bassadors In Cairo and Damas
cus, freedom and peace. This, he
said, is what Israel is really like.
