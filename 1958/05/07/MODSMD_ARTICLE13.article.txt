months ago will crystallize on the Memorial Auditorium stage to

Madam."
The show, which first appealed to take a second or third place

behind other possibilities, won
out in a contest which included
"Paint Your Wagon" and "Gen
tlemen Prefer Blondes."
Tonight's the night for the cast
members to haul out the grease
paint, and for the stage techni
cians to dust off, and polish up,
the footlights and spotlights. Cur

7:30, though 8:30 will be starting

of Sally Adams, the party-giving
American ambassadress to Lich
tenberg, is a professional per

doon" and "Annie Get Your Gun"
among other shows.
Stan Throneberry plays Cosmo,
the Lichtenberg foreign minister.

for numerous Stanford produc
tions, both those of Ram's Head
and of the Stanford Players.

one for Tennis?" solo in the 1936
Gaieties was one of the outstand
ing performances in that show,
will play the Princess Maria of
Lichtenberg. William Kinsolving
is the musical comedy's Kenneth.

PRINCESS MARIA OPENS THE LICHTENBERG FAIR
Carol McKenna leads Lichtenbergians in revelry


JOE REGAN
Show Director
An idea that popped up at a Ram's Head board meeting some
months ago will crystallize on the Memorial Auditorium stage to
night when Ram's Head presents its 1938 Spring Show, "Call Me
Madam."
The show, which first appealed to take a second or third place

behind other possibilities, won
out in a contest which included
"Paint Your Wagon" and "Gen
tlemen Prefer Blondes."
Tonight's the night for the cast
members to haul out the grease
paint, and for the stage techni
cians to dust off, and polish up,
the footlights and spotlights. Cur
tain for the initial performance is
7:30, though 8:30 will be starting
time tomorrow through Satur
day.
"The Hostess with the Most
est," ''Marrying for Love,"
"Washington Square Dance" and
"Can You Use Any Money To
day?" are but a few of the num
bers which star Betty Eichler as
Sally Adams, and featured per
formers Stan Throneberry, Carol
McKenna, William Kinsolving
and Mattie Buell will sing.
32-Pieee Orchestra
A 32-piece orchestra, directed
by John A. Miller, will provide
the music for the show which will
also be highlighted by a 42-mem
ber dancing chorus. The entire
production is under the direction
of Joe Regan.
Betty Eichler, in the title role
of Sally Adams, the party-giving
American ambassadress to Lich
tenberg, is a professional per
former of merit. She has ap
peared in "Showboat," "Briga
doon" and "Annie Get Your Gun"
among other shows.
Stan Throneberry plays Cosmo,
the Lichtenberg foreign minister.
Throneberry will be remembered
for numerous Stanford produc
tions, both those of Ram's Head
and of the Stanford Players.
Gaieties Hit
Carol McKenna, whose "Any
one for Tennis?" solo in the 1936
Gaieties was one of the outstand
ing performances in that show,
will play the Princess Maria of
Lichtenberg. William Kinsolving
is the musical comedy's Kenneth.
He. too, is no newcomer to the
Stanford stage.

The part of the French maid
will be played by Mattie Buell.
She was a runner-up in the Otto
Preminger St. Joan contest.
"Madam's" production staff
has Joan Duncan as choreogra
pher, Earl Cilley as producer,
