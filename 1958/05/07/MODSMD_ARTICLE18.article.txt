Needs to Say Much More
Editor, The Daily:
I am American enough to say that the "Ameri
can" of the "Why Not Join H-Bomb Protests?"
letter has a right to say what he says. I feel that
this is one step closer to being an American than
the one who condemns a sound demonstration
with five emotion-packed, loaded words.
I answer his question "Need I say more?" af
firmatively. He needs to say a lot more. Just
what proof has he of the large number of Com
munists, socialists, conscientious objectors and
atheists that led or participated in the sincere,
well-managed movement of free expression?
My guess is that the "American" stood on the
sidelines of the demonstration (perhaps with a
water bag in hand), blindly condemning what he
knew nothing about, with large words he was
probably just getting familiar with in HIS social
group. Need I say more about who I think is an
AMERICAN misfit?

To "An American": The anti-II-bomb demon
stration may have been ill-timed, perhaps ill
advised; but please, Mr. American, if you wish
to call the demonstrators names, leave yours
around.

An American Freak
Editor, The Daily:
To "An American": Have you ever seen the
shadow of a man etched into rock by a wave of
atomic heal ? Have you ever seen a city in which
the tallest standing structure was a chimney 1(5
feet high? Has the acrid, rotten smell of human
death and agony ever assaulted your nostrils
upon arising in the morning?
I doubt very much whether you have eyes,
"American," for you cannot see the principle
behind people participating in peace demonstra
tions. You have no ears at all, for you cannot
hear the cries of your fellow man in his agony
and despair. And you have no nose, for you
cannot distinguish the smell of life from that, of
violence and death. You, sir, are a freak. Afraid
of the ridicule your abnormalities would draw, it
is little wonder that you wouldn't join demon
strators to halt H-bomb tests.
The United States possesses weapons strong
enough to destroy a metropolitan area from Val
lejo to San Jose, a distance greater than 60 miles.
Do we really need better, more powerful weap
ons? Perhaps we could use better missiles and
airplanes to deliver those weapons, but do we
need more killing power? I think not. It may be
that your body will have to be charred to an ash
before you realize, in that smallest fragment of
time before elernity, that war, whether with H
bombs or spiked clubs, is fruitless.

In answer to the letter by "An American":
<1) As your first premise, you state that the
people conducting the demonstrations have no
conception of the results of their demonstrations
should these demonstrations "snowball." These

people very definitely understand the conse
quences of their actions, for it is only through
the action of the people that change may be
brought about in a democratic way. You say that
they have not considered the "important political
aspects" of the tests; by this, one must assume
you are saying that human lives are less valuable
than party politics. The type of thinking you
exhibit when you state that the Government
knows much more than we and is "interested in
preserving humanity," and that representatives
"are doing the best for our nation and our peo
ple," is one much too prevalent in our thinking
today. It was this same blind, unthinking faith
with which the German people followed Hitler.
(2) If you had taken the trouble to look, you
would have found several intelligent plans for
the purpose of abolishing nuclear armaments. It
is the simple fact that for the good of humanity
the stopping of the tests must be the first step.
(3) You say we should take a look at the
screwballs who are leading the demonstration;
although I was there for three hours,. I saw no
purple peggers, pink suede shoes, or turquoise
jackets. I did see a few beards, but I am not
absolutely certain that you can classify a person
as a social misfit because he has a beard. You
identify this group by their dress (hypothetical)
and proceed to call them Communists, socialists,
conscientious objectors and atheists. What has
happened to our democracy, freest of the free,
and our Christian religion, most moral of all re
ligions, when the leaders of a demonstration for
the preservation of mankind are Communists,
socialists, conscientious objectors and atheists?
This is nothing more than indiscriminate name
calling. Although I did not see the group you
mentioned at the Stanford demonstration, I saw
two Wilbur sponsors, a resident adviser and sev
eral professors signing the petition. Are these
your radical misfits? Although these people
deviate from the group norm, they are not mis
fits or neurotics.
I believe you have need to say a great deal
more, "Mr. American." You have (1) made some
vague generalities about our Government, (2)
shown an appalling lack of understanding con
cerning the demonstrators themselves, and (3)
called the demonstrators the worst names you
can think of; no wonder you did not wish to sign
your name. However, I sincerely hope there are
a few people left to whom the words "socialist,"
"atheist" and "conscientious objector" are not
offensive simply because they conflict with the
group norm.

The idiot there's no other printable term for
him— who signed himself "An American" yester-.
flay may have meant his missive as a joke, but
it was mostly a joke on him. What this letler
sounds most like is some of the ravings of the
KKK. They're Americans, loo; however, this can
be an adjective as well as a noun. I think it is
here, with "jackass" being the understood ref
erence.
Assuming the writer did mean it as a joke, it
seems awfully unfortunate If) print such non
sense in The Daily, since some people outside the
University may actually think that Stanford ad
mits such fools as would honestly believe what
the letter slates.

An American Freak
Editor, The Daily:
To "An American": Have you ever seen the
shadow of a man etched into rock by a wave of
atomic heal ? Have you ever seen a city in which
the tallest standing structure was a chimney 1(5
feet high? Has the acrid, rotten smell of human
death and agony ever assaulted your nostrils
upon arising in the morning?
I doubt very much whether you have eyes,
"American," for you cannot see the principle
behind people participating in peace demonstra
tions. You have no ears at all, for you cannot
hear the cries of your fellow man in his agony
and despair. And you have no nose, for you
cannot distinguish the smell of life from that, of
violence and death. You, sir, are a freak. Afraid
of the ridicule your abnormalities would draw, it
is little wonder that you wouldn't join demon
strators to halt H-bomb tests.
The United States possesses weapons strong
enough to destroy a metropolitan area from Val
lejo to San Jose, a distance greater than 60 miles.
Do we really need better, more powerful weap
ons? Perhaps we could use better missiles and
airplanes to deliver those weapons, but do we
need more killing power? I think not. It may be
that your body will have to be charred to an ash
before you realize, in that smallest fragment of
time before elernity, that war, whether with H
bombs or spiked clubs, is fruitless.

In answer to the letter by "An American":
<1) As your first premise, you state that the
people conducting the demonstrations have no
conception of the results of their demonstrations
should these demonstrations "snowball." These

people very definitely understand the conse
quences of their actions, for it is only through
the action of the people that change may be
brought about in a democratic way. You say that
they have not considered the "important political
aspects" of the tests; by this, one must assume
you are saying that human lives are less valuable
than party politics. The type of thinking you
exhibit when you state that the Government
knows much more than we and is "interested in
preserving humanity," and that representatives
"are doing the best for our nation and our peo
ple," is one much too prevalent in our thinking
today. It was this same blind, unthinking faith
with which the German people followed Hitler.
(2) If you had taken the trouble to look, you
would have found several intelligent plans for
the purpose of abolishing nuclear armaments. It
is the simple fact that for the good of humanity
the stopping of the tests must be the first step.
(3) You say we should take a look at the
screwballs who are leading the demonstration;
although I was there for three hours,. I saw no
purple peggers, pink suede shoes, or turquoise
jackets. I did see a few beards, but I am not
absolutely certain that you can classify a person
as a social misfit because he has a beard. You
identify this group by their dress (hypothetical)
and proceed to call them Communists, socialists,
conscientious objectors and atheists. What has
happened to our democracy, freest of the free,
and our Christian religion, most moral of all re
ligions, when the leaders of a demonstration for
the preservation of mankind are Communists,
socialists, conscientious objectors and atheists?
This is nothing more than indiscriminate name
calling. Although I did not see the group you
mentioned at the Stanford demonstration, I saw
two Wilbur sponsors, a resident adviser and sev
eral professors signing the petition. Are these
your radical misfits? Although these people
deviate from the group norm, they are not mis
fits or neurotics.
I believe you have need to say a great deal
more, "Mr. American." You have (1) made some
vague generalities about our Government, (2)
shown an appalling lack of understanding con
cerning the demonstrators themselves, and (3)
called the demonstrators the worst names you
can think of; no wonder you did not wish to sign
your name. However, I sincerely hope there are
a few people left to whom the words "socialist,"
"atheist" and "conscientious objector" are not
offensive simply because they conflict with the
group norm.

I am American enough to say that the "Ameri

letter has a right to say what he says. I feel that
this is one step closer to being an American than
the one who condemns a sound demonstration

I answer his question "Need I say more?" af
firmatively. He needs to say a lot more. Just
what proof has he of the large number of Com
munists, socialists, conscientious objectors and
atheists that led or participated in the sincere,
well-managed movement of free expression?
My guess is that the "American" stood on the
sidelines of the demonstration (perhaps with a
water bag in hand), blindly condemning what he
knew nothing about, with large words he was
probably just getting familiar with in HIS social
group. Need I say more about who I think is an

In answer to the letter by "An American":
<1) As your first premise, you state that the
people conducting the demonstrations have no
conception of the results of their demonstrations
should these demonstrations "snowball." These

people very definitely understand the conse
quences of their actions, for it is only through
the action of the people that change may be
brought about in a democratic way. You say that
they have not considered the "important political
aspects" of the tests; by this, one must assume
you are saying that human lives are less valuable
than party politics. The type of thinking you
exhibit when you state that the Government
knows much more than we and is "interested in
preserving humanity," and that representatives
"are doing the best for our nation and our peo
ple," is one much too prevalent in our thinking
today. It was this same blind, unthinking faith
with which the German people followed Hitler.
(2) If you had taken the trouble to look, you
would have found several intelligent plans for
the purpose of abolishing nuclear armaments. It
is the simple fact that for the good of humanity
the stopping of the tests must be the first step.
(3) You say we should take a look at the
screwballs who are leading the demonstration;
although I was there for three hours,. I saw no
purple peggers, pink suede shoes, or turquoise
jackets. I did see a few beards, but I am not
absolutely certain that you can classify a person
as a social misfit because he has a beard. You
identify this group by their dress (hypothetical)
and proceed to call them Communists, socialists,
conscientious objectors and atheists. What has
happened to our democracy, freest of the free,
and our Christian religion, most moral of all re
ligions, when the leaders of a demonstration for
the preservation of mankind are Communists,
socialists, conscientious objectors and atheists?
This is nothing more than indiscriminate name
calling. Although I did not see the group you
mentioned at the Stanford demonstration, I saw
two Wilbur sponsors, a resident adviser and sev
eral professors signing the petition. Are these
your radical misfits? Although these people
deviate from the group norm, they are not mis
fits or neurotics.
I believe you have need to say a great deal
more, "Mr. American." You have (1) made some
vague generalities about our Government, (2)
shown an appalling lack of understanding con
cerning the demonstrators themselves, and (3)
called the demonstrators the worst names you
can think of; no wonder you did not wish to sign
your name. However, I sincerely hope there are
a few people left to whom the words "socialist,"
"atheist" and "conscientious objector" are not
offensive simply because they conflict with the
group norm.

I am American enough to say that the "Ameri
can" of the "Why Not Join H-Bomb Protests?"
letter has a right to say what he says. I feel that
this is one step closer to being an American than
the one who condemns a sound demonstration
with five emotion-packed, loaded words.
I answer his question "Need I say more?" af
firmatively. He needs to say a lot more. Just
what proof has he of the large number of Com
munists, socialists, conscientious objectors and
atheists that led or participated in the sincere,
well-managed movement of free expression?
My guess is that the "American" stood on the
sidelines of the demonstration (perhaps with a
water bag in hand), blindly condemning what he
knew nothing about, with large words he was
probably just getting familiar with in HIS social
group. Need I say more about who I think is an
AMERICAN misfit?

preserving humanity," and that representatives
"are doing the best for our nation and our peo
ple," is one much too prevalent in our thinking
today. It was this same blind, unthinking faith
with which the German people followed Hitler.
(2) If you had taken the trouble to look, you
would have found several intelligent plans for
the purpose of abolishing nuclear armaments. It
is the simple fact that for the good of humanity
the stopping of the tests must be the first step.
(3) You say we should take a look at the
screwballs who are leading the demonstration;
although I was there for three hours,. I saw no
purple peggers, pink suede shoes, or turquoise
jackets. I did see a few beards, but I am not
absolutely certain that you can classify a person
as a social misfit because he has a beard. You
identify this group by their dress (hypothetical)
and proceed to call them Communists, socialists,
conscientious objectors and atheists. What has
happened to our democracy, freest of the free,
and our Christian religion, most moral of all re
ligions, when the leaders of a demonstration for
the preservation of mankind are Communists,
socialists, conscientious objectors and atheists?
This is nothing more than indiscriminate name
calling. Although I did not see the group you
mentioned at the Stanford demonstration, I saw
two Wilbur sponsors, a resident adviser and sev
eral professors signing the petition. Are these
your radical misfits? Although these people
deviate from the group norm, they are not mis
fits or neurotics.
I believe you have need to say a great deal
more, "Mr. American." You have (1) made some
vague generalities about our Government, (2)
shown an appalling lack of understanding con
cerning the demonstrators themselves, and (3)
called the demonstrators the worst names you
can think of; no wonder you did not wish to sign
your name. However, I sincerely hope there are
a few people left to whom the words "socialist,"
"atheist" and "conscientious objector" are not
offensive simply because they conflict with the
group norm.

flay may have meant his missive as a joke, but
it was mostly a joke on him. What this letler
sounds most like is some of the ravings of the
KKK. They're Americans, loo; however, this can
be an adjective as well as a noun. I think it is
here, with "jackass" being the understood ref

Assuming the writer did mean it as a joke, it

Needs to Say Much More
Editor, The Daily:
I am American enough to say that the "Ameri
can" of the "Why Not Join H-Bomb Protests?"
letter has a right to say what he says. I feel that
this is one step closer to being an American than
the one who condemns a sound demonstration
with five emotion-packed, loaded words.
I answer his question "Need I say more?" af
firmatively. He needs to say a lot more. Just
what proof has he of the large number of Com
munists, socialists, conscientious objectors and
atheists that led or participated in the sincere,
well-managed movement of free expression?
My guess is that the "American" stood on the
sidelines of the demonstration (perhaps with a
water bag in hand), blindly condemning what he
knew nothing about, with large words he was
probably just getting familiar with in HIS social
group. Need I say more about who I think is an
AMERICAN misfit?

Leave Your Name
Editor, The Daily:
To "An American": The anti-II-bomb demon
stration may have been ill-timed, perhaps ill
advised; but please, Mr. American, if you wish
to call the demonstrators names, leave yours
around.
David S. Long
An American Freak
Editor, The Daily:
To "An American": Have you ever seen the
shadow of a man etched into rock by a wave of
atomic heal ? Have you ever seen a city in which
the tallest standing structure was a chimney 1(5
feet high? Has the acrid, rotten smell of human
death and agony ever assaulted your nostrils
upon arising in the morning?
I doubt very much whether you have eyes,
"American," for you cannot see the principle
behind people participating in peace demonstra
tions. You have no ears at all, for you cannot
hear the cries of your fellow man in his agony
and despair. And you have no nose, for you
cannot distinguish the smell of life from that, of
violence and death. You, sir, are a freak. Afraid
of the ridicule your abnormalities would draw, it
is little wonder that you wouldn't join demon
strators to halt H-bomb tests.
The United States possesses weapons strong
enough to destroy a metropolitan area from Val
lejo to San Jose, a distance greater than 60 miles.
Do we really need better, more powerful weap
ons? Perhaps we could use better missiles and
airplanes to deliver those weapons, but do we
need more killing power? I think not. It may be
that your body will have to be charred to an ash
before you realize, in that smallest fragment of
time before elernity, that war, whether with H
bombs or spiked clubs, is fruitless.

f ague (Generalities
Editor, The Daily:
In answer to the letter by "An American":
<1) As your first premise, you state that the
people conducting the demonstrations have no
conception of the results of their demonstrations
should these demonstrations "snowball." These

people very definitely understand the conse
quences of their actions, for it is only through
the action of the people that change may be
brought about in a democratic way. You say that
they have not considered the "important political
aspects" of the tests; by this, one must assume
you are saying that human lives are less valuable
than party politics. The type of thinking you
exhibit when you state that the Government
knows much more than we and is "interested in
preserving humanity," and that representatives
"are doing the best for our nation and our peo
ple," is one much too prevalent in our thinking
today. It was this same blind, unthinking faith
with which the German people followed Hitler.
(2) If you had taken the trouble to look, you
would have found several intelligent plans for
the purpose of abolishing nuclear armaments. It
is the simple fact that for the good of humanity
the stopping of the tests must be the first step.
(3) You say we should take a look at the
screwballs who are leading the demonstration;
although I was there for three hours,. I saw no
purple peggers, pink suede shoes, or turquoise
jackets. I did see a few beards, but I am not
