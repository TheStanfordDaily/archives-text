# TONIGHT AT SYMPHONY
## Bruno Water to Close Season Playing Mozart 
### Margot Zeiss 
Winding up a brilliant season,
the San Francisco Symphony will
feature Bruno Walter on the po
dium lonighl at its next to last
conceit. Waller is one of Ihe great
conductors of our time and adds
his great personal dignity to the
strength and vigor of his inter
pretations.
The first half of tonight's pro
gram is devoted to Mozart's Sym
phony No. 36 in C Major. This
symphony is the product of Mo
zart's period of great creativity
from 18 to 21 years of age. He
had returned to his home town of
Salzburg from a summer and au
tumn visit lo Vienna, where he
had been plied with honors.
Conditions in Salzburg were not
favorable. He hated the weather
and the town and was in a fit of
depression. Out: of this gloomy
period from 1773 to 1777, until his
21st year, he produced an amaz
ing amount of compositions, in
cl u ding symphonies, sonatas,
chamber music and masses.
Viennese Gaiety
The works of this period are
charged with Viennese gaiety and
show a return to the German
"grand style" so in contrast to
the "polite style" (La Galenterie)
delicacy of his later works.
Somewhere during this time
Mozart crossed his own Rubicon.
The constant pruning of his hopes
for worldly success seemed or
dained to bring lo light a finer
hloom, Ihe more perfect fruit of
•sheer genius. The inescapable
destiny of his life pulled him to

misery like the necessary unfold
ing of a Greek tragedy.
A perfect second in tonight's
double-header is Anton Bruck
ner's Symphony No. •! in E Flat
Major (Romantic).
Late Start
Like Brahms, Bruckner was
late getting started with his sym
phonies. He was 42 before his
First was finished, and death
stayed his hand while still work
ing on the Ninth.
He was hailed by the Wagner
circle as the greatest symphonic
writer after Beethoven. There are
times when his mus i c seems
transported into super-mundane
regions defying description. And
yet the analytical listener will
often complain that Bruckner
takes too long to express what he
has to say.
One of his peculiarities is the
habit of piling climax upon cli
max until a breathing spell is de
manded, then inserting several
measures of silence which relieve
the tension but break the conti
nuity of the movement.
Bruckner was born of peasant
stock near the Austrian town of
Lin/, in 1824. Coming from a fam
ily of schoolteachers, his vocation
was predestined. His early musi
cal talent caused his parents to
send him to the secular music
school of the St. Florian monas
tery.

Viennese Gaiety
The works of this period are
charged with Viennese gaiety and
show a return to the German
"grand style" so in contrast to
the "polite style" (La Galenterie)
delicacy of his later works.
Somewhere during this time
Mozart crossed his own Rubicon.
The constant pruning of his hopes
for worldly success seemed or
dained to bring lo light a finer
hloom, Ihe more perfect fruit of
•sheer genius. The inescapable
destiny of his life pulled him to

misery like the necessary unfold
ing of a Greek tragedy.
A perfect second in tonight's
double-header is Anton Bruck
ner's Symphony No. •! in E Flat
Major (Romantic).
Late Start
Like Brahms, Bruckner was
late getting started with his sym
phonies. He was 42 before his
First was finished, and death
stayed his hand while still work
ing on the Ninth.
He was hailed by the Wagner
circle as the greatest symphonic
writer after Beethoven. There are
times when his mus i c seems
transported into super-mundane
regions defying description. And
yet the analytical listener will
often complain that Bruckner
takes too long to express what he
has to say.
One of his peculiarities is the
habit of piling climax upon cli
max until a breathing spell is de
manded, then inserting several
measures of silence which relieve
the tension but break the conti
nuity of the movement.
Bruckner was born of peasant
stock near the Austrian town of
Lin/, in 1824. Coming from a fam
ily of schoolteachers, his vocation
was predestined. His early musi
cal talent caused his parents to
send him to the secular music
school of the St. Florian monas
tery.
Winding up a brilliant season,
the San Francisco Symphony will
feature Bruno Walter on the po
dium lonighl at its next to last
conceit. Waller is one of Ihe great
conductors of our time and adds
his great personal dignity to the
strength and vigor of his inter
pretations.
The first half of tonight's pro
gram is devoted to Mozart's Sym
phony No. 36 in C Major. This
symphony is the product of Mo
zart's period of great creativity
from 18 to 21 years of age. He
had returned to his home town of
Salzburg from a summer and au
tumn visit lo Vienna, where he
had been plied with honors.
Conditions in Salzburg were not
favorable. He hated the weather
and the town and was in a fit of
depression. Out: of this gloomy
period from 1773 to 1777, until his
21st year, he produced an amaz
ing amount of compositions, in
cl u ding symphonies, sonatas,
chamber music and masses.
