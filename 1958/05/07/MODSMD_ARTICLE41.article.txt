# Physics Hall Lighting System To Be Completed This Week
## 
### 
A new lighting system in front
of Physics Lecture Hall is sched
uled for completion within the
next week, according to John
Lynd of the Stanford Planning
Office.
The two-part installation, which
will eliminate one of the most
poorly-lighted spots in the central
academic area, will consist of in
direct lighting under the circular
arcade and a series of canopied

lights near the steps similar to
those in back of Wilbur Hall.
Two larger projects which the
Planning Office expects to com
plete this summer are the reroof
ing of the Memorial Court arcade
and the final installation of equip
ment in the new steam plant on
Serra Street.
The shoring in the arcade,
which is currently providing in
surance support for the upper
part of the structure, will remain
in place while the 60-year-old roof
and its wooden supports are be
ing replaced and supported by
new steel beams.
The new steam plant will go
into operation beginning next fall
quarter. The old plant will con
tinue to operate until the follow
ing summer, when it will be shut
down and converted to other uses.
