## Man Forms 'Religion', Says Brinton 
### Sallyanne Durr 
Through progress and his
search for understanding, a new
"religion" has been formulated
by man. Dr. Crane Brinton told
last night's Tuesday Evening Se
ries audience in Memorial Audi
torium.
Brinton termed the proponents
of this group "scientific material
ists." Composed of free-thinkers,
humanists, positivists and numer
ous other secularists, this "reli
gion" adheres neither to skepti
cism nor non-believing; it empha
sizes man.
"The doctrine of this 'religion'
is to give explanation of man's
origin, purpose and destiny," said
Brinton.
Brinton mentioned that three
main influences of this "religion"
on Christianity have been the
idea of the inherent goodness of
man and for man on this earth as
in humanitarian ideals, idea sen
timents and unalienable rights to
the pursuit of happiness.
"Warfare of religion and sci
ence is no longer raging; fear of
the after-life is being de-empha
sized. The remaining sentiment
idea which is still a topic of heat
ed discussion is the question of
the ability of man to know trans
cendentally," continued Brinton.
Science and the doctrine of
progress haven't been able to sat
isfy this last problem, and Brin
ton implied that some belief, or
faith, is necessary for a solution.
"Even after 200 years of ration
ally attempting to solve man's
biggest problems, the promises to
a solution offered by the new 're
ligion' haven't been kept.
"Humility, a spiritual neces
sity, has not yet been built into
the too fair-weather religion of
progress," concluded Brinton.
