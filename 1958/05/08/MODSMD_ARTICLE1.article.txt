Editor, The Daily:
Dr. Mulford Sibley of the Political Science De
partment is now teaching his last months at
Stanford. He will return to the University of
Minnesota next fall.
This, as the saying goes, will be Minnesota's
gain and Stanford's loss. Not less than 303 stu
dents who signed petitions asking that Professor
Sibley remain at Stanford would agree. They
would agree that he is one of the most re fresh
ing and compelling figures to appear on the Stan
ford teaching scene in a long time. Why has
Dr. Sibley been of such uncommon worth as an
structor? The following is offered:
He combines the attributes of a first-rate mind
with a vigorous interest in his subject and an
abiding concgrn for his students.
Political Science graduate students, a species
of which I am a member, are a notoriously hard
to-plea.se lot. It is rarethaMhey all agree on the
merits of a given professor. Nevertheless, they
chorus in loud unison their praise of Dr. Sibley.
They respect his razor-sharp mind and the fact
that he is well-read and can draw examples from
any one of a dozen fields.
Undergrads are no less enthusiastic. Last year,
a very able professor gave Modern Political The
ory, and 64 took the course. This year, 105 en
rolled to take it from Dr. Sibley. He has drawn
a number of brilliant students into the political

science department. When students leave most
classes, they talk about last week's date or next
week's ball game. After Dr. Sibley's classes,
most of them discuss the issues that he h is
raisedâ€”a supreme tribute to a professor's abil
ity to excite serious reflection beyond the call
of classroom duty.
As to Dr. Sibley's interest in students, he holds
long office hours and constantly has a line of
students waiting to see him. He receives numer
ous invitations from living groups. This quar
ter, 24 students signed to take his seminar in the
democratic tradition. Any other professor would
have narrowed the list to a dozen by accepting
only graduate students. What did Dr. Sibley do?
He split the list and is teaching two seminars of
a dozen each at no extra compensation, although
it means much more work for him. One profes
sor described this as "unheard of."
I said at the beginning that Dr. Sibley is leav
ing Stanford. He is not leaving Stanford because
he wants to. He is leaving Stanford because he
hasn't been offered a new contract. He will re
turn to Minnesota, where he has been happy, and
where, no doubt, he will continue to be happy.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that Dr. Sibley
would have preferred to remain at Stanford.
Why, then, was his contract not renewed? The
political science professors, to a man, were sol
idly behind him. It can be well-argued, I think,

that those most qualified to judge the compe
tence of Dr. Sibley are those trained in the same
discipline. Nevertheless, the Provost of the Uni
versity, who is a very able engineer, was chiefly
responsible for nixing the contract.
The official reason given was that Dr. Sibley
had not done enough research. Nevertheless, he
has published as much, if not more, than most
of the professors teaching at Stanford, having
received the highest award that the American
Political Science Association can bestow for one
of his books.
I do not grant the issue of the Administration;
but even assuming that it is so, this xaises an
issue which is of piercing importance: that of
teaching versus research. A national reputation
is made on quality research. A great teacher is
seldom heard of beyond the next county. And
it is the national reputation which brings dona
tions on which the University must exist.
And yet the screaming fact is that in recent
years several astoundingly good teachers have
been lost. In view of this, it is legitimate to ask,
I believe, if the Stanford student is not paying
for the Stanford reputation rather than for the
Stanford education. It is legitimate to ask this
as the tuition is being raised to $1005 a year.
It is legitimate to ask this as Dr. Mulford Sibley
of the Political Science Department teaches his
last months at Stanford.
