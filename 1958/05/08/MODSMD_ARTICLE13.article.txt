Weapons Testing Instructions
Editor, The Daily:
Thank God that wo have a competent group
of coeds, foreign students, bookstore owners and
professors to instruct our Military General Staff
in the operations of weapons testing. For a
while, there, I was beginning to fear the obvious
superiority of Russian armaments. I hope they
will continue to write informative letters to the
President, whom * everyone knows to be poorly
prepared to set our defense standards.

'All Radicals Caged 9
Editor, The Daily:
Dear American: We are proud of you! This
is Ihe kind of forthright student initiative we
want to see! You bet we're intelligent Americans
and intelligent Stanford students and intelligent.
We swear solemnly never to wear beards, tur
quoise jackets or pink suede shoes. We believe
all radicals should be caged securely behind cast
iron bars on top of the Union, as a sober warn
ing to the misinformed and possible thinkers that
the proper cult is that of the mundane, the pure,
and the Rally Com. We pledge our faith to those
loyal, uplifted representatives who, God helping,
will continue to consecrate their lives and ours
to the preservation of humanity with ever bigger
and better bombs. Only, brother (if you will
permit us to call you "brother"), let us be wary
that those preserved are part of the Group. We
suggest you form a committee.
We bless you, we love you, do let us hear more
from you—both our addresses are General De
livery.

P.S. We need you so much we humbly suggest
also that you eat nothing but Japanese sardines.
44 Eccc Anicricanas!"
Editor, The Daily:
Eece Americanus!
He himself has said it, and it's not much to our
credit:
He is an American (and a loyal knight of Ihe Ku
Klux Klan).
He is certain, no doubt, that Ihe radicals have
sold out:
And he's bound, in language quite invectical, to
damn this perfidy intellectual.
At their very latest meeting, the dirty radicals
were eating
Pink ice-cre am, while Ezra Pound, in purple peg
gers, read a poem whose sound
Was so definitely pro populo he should be shot,
to try to dupe us so!

And old Lord Russell, in a turquoise jacket, sold
b'hang, to minors, by the packet.
You may shout your freedom, if you ever see
one;
But if you spy it, better keep it quiet:
The DAR (loyalists all) surely would appall:
Don't you know? Die Luft der Freiheit are full
of Nazi spite!
Yes, the radical's a Russky, ad majorem gloria ei,
And our friend, a white, a native, protestant, to
wards America quite amative,
Doth roundly damn the radical, and damn his
perfidy intellectual.
He himself has said it, and it's not much to our
credit:
He is an AMERICAN!

IT hy Lose Teachers?
Editor, The Daily:
Why does Stanford lose good teachers in lib
eral arts?
Primarily this is the concern of the adminis
tration. But it should not be forgotten that the
students are also interested parties. They are the
most directly affected ... by the loss and by
the replacement.

Thanks to Students
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the Stanford Convalescent Home
we would like to express our deepest thanks to
the Stanford student body for the enthusiasm
which Ihey showed last week during the Con
Home drive.
We feel that this year's drive was one of the
most successful in Stanford history; not only
because of the huge amount of money collected
but mainly because of the atmosphere which sur
rounded each event. Everyone seemed to be hav
ing a wonderful time.
We especially want to thank our 22 chairmen.
Many of the events which they headed were rec
ord-breakers not only in money collected but in
attendance. We are also grateful to The Stan
ford Daily without whose help the drive could
never have been so well received.
We wish to congratulate the Class of 1961 for
Ihcir outstanding participation in the off-campus
solicitations and for backing the King and Queen
contest. Our thanks to the YWCA for their help
on the Strawberry Brunch and to the sophomores
for backing the best Carnival ever.
We can go on praising the hundreds who in
every way made this such a thrilling drive, but
the real thanks can only be expressed by the
children whose lives are so affected by your dol
lars and interest.
