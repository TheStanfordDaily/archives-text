# Administration Denies Sibley Appointment
## No Official Reasons for Action Given 
### 
Professor Mulford Q. Siblc\ has
been denied permanent appoint
ment to the faculty of the Politi
cal Science Department.
The Office of the President ef
fectively barred Sibley's appoint
ment Tuesday afternoon by its
decision not to present Sibley's
name to the Board of Trustees.
This decision was made even
though Sibley had the unanimous
approval of all the faculty of the
department and also the Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
The Office of the President is
composed of President Wallace
Sterling, Provost Frederick E.
Terman and their advisers.
Appointments to the faculty go
through a rigorous procedure to
insure that the best men avail
able are obtained. In the first in
stance, when a position is avail
able in a department, that depart
ment makes a careful screening
of all candidates available in the
country.
Dean's Action
The final recommendations of
the department are sent to the
Dean of the school in which the
department is a member. After
the Dean has acted upon the ap
pointment, it is sent to the Uni
versity Provost.
In the meantime the Provost
appoints a search committee that
is wider than the department it
self. It is the specific responsi
bility of the search committee to
see that the department has made
the utmost effort to contact all
available candidates.
The Provost then acts upon the
appointment and presents it to
the President who first sends il
to the Advisory Board of the Aca
demic Council, an elected commit
tee of the faculty. After approval
by the Advisory Board, the Presi
dent next presents the name of
the candidate to the Board of
Trustees for final approval to
gether with a statement of funds
available for the position.
Informed Sources
It has been disclosed from in
l formed sources that Sibley's ap
pointment was never presented
to the Advisory Board of the Aca
demic Council.
According to statements from
Administration officials, there
are four possible reasons why an
appointment might be disap
proved:
• The candidate's moral repu
tation is under serious question.
• The candidate does not meet
the scholarship requirements.
• The candidate is not a good
teacher.
• The candidate's political lean
ings would be detrimental to the
interests of the University.
The Office of the President has
given no official reason for not
approving Sibley. Unofficially, it;
has been said that the administra
tion does not believe Sibley ful-
I fills the scholarship require
ments.
Visiting Professorship
Sibley is presently at Stanford
on a visiting professorship for a
one-year term. This procedure is
used so that the professor can
"look over" the University, and
the members of the department
can also appraise the candidate.
His list of scholastic achieve
ments is great. He has published
three volumes and has two books
nearly completed which have been
committed to Harper's.
One of his volumes won the
American Political Science Asso
ciation prize for the "best contri
bution" to Government and Hu
man Welfare. This book is titled
"Conscription of Conscience" and
was co-aulhorcd with Philip Ja
cob.
Sibley has also authored nu
merous articles and parts of
books and has made many con
tributions to scholarly journals.
