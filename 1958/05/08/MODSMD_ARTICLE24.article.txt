Stanford may havo throe of tho
fastest distance runners in the
country, hut these Indians are go
ing lo find that they're in plenty
of rugged competition Saturday
at the Fresno .Relays.
Norman Lloyd, Ernie Cunliffe
and Maury Graves each rank
fourth or better in the nation in
their events. Lloyd tops U.S. col
legiate half milers with his 1:19.2,
and Cunliffe is fourth in the same
event at 1:50.2.
Lloyd is also third among the
milers with his <1:05.3. Only Don
Bowdon and Alex Henderson have
run faster. Graves trails Hender
son and USC's Max Truex in tho
two-mile with his 9:04.9. Both
Henderson and Truex have al
ready broken Truex's former Na
tional Collegiate eight lap record
of 8:55.0.
The ihree Indians will team
with Dick Lassen to run the dis
tance medley at the Fresno meet
in an event which may prove to
he among the year's best.
Last Year's Buttle
Last year, the Fresno distance
medley proved to be a tremen
dous four - team battle among
USC, UCLA, California and the
St riders.
This season, it looks like Stan
ford, California and Oklahoma,
with the Trojans a possible con
lender. Cal looms as the favor
ite right now with a powerful
loam of Jack Yerman, Jerry Sie
bert, Maynard Orme and Bowdon.
Yerm a n , probably the best
quarter milor in the West, should
gain an early lead for the Bears.
But Cunliffe ought to bo able to
make up all or most of any deficit
in his half-mile log against Sie
bort. Cunliffe beat the Bear soph
by a good 10 yards when they
met here last week.
The Key Leg
Tho key log will be the 1320,
with Ormo against Graves. Since
Hie 1320 isn't any sort of a stand
ard meet race, it's difficult to fig
ure what's going to happen. On
comparative mile times, Orme
looks a little faster.
That leaves most of Iho deci
sion up to Lloyd and Bowden in
the mile. Although they're a lit
tle more of an unknown quantity
in the West, Oklahoma does have
Gail Hodgson, who's good enough
to make an average team out
standing.
While tho Indians and Bears
will go hardest in the medley,
they should havo plenty left for
Ihe four-man two-mile battle
against Ooidental and USC.
World Record
Tho Tigers hold the world rec
ord of 7:22.8, and three members
of tho team that set that mark
last year are back. Despite this,
Troy looks the best balanced with
Tom Anderson, Wes McLeod,
Wayne Lemons and Bob Shank
land.
Cunliffe and Lloyd give Stan
ford the same sort of excellent
one-two final punch that Cal will
have with Bowdon and Siobert,
but the major question with these
two teams will be how much are
worn out from the medley.
