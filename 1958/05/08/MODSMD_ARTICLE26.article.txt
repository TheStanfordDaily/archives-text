Crocked and Gary Andrade. Each
of ihesc fencers will be hoping to
prove himself good enough 1o be
considered for a regular role on
the fencing team.
This meel is an experimental
as far as Coach Bugge is con
cerned for he is trying to get an
idea of how large Stanford's fenc

Crockett and Andrade he's run
ning the risk of losing in favor
of the experience his new men
need.
