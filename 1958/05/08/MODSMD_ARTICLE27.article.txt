# Frosh Netters Complete Third Undefeated Year
## 
### 
Having rolled through their
first seven matches without los
ing as much as three points in
any one match, and with the can
cellation of a match with Berke
ley High School scheduled for to
day, the Stanford frosh tennis
team has concluded a very suc
cessful undefeated season.
This year's undefeated cam
paign marks the third straight
year that Stanford Coach Bob
Renker's frosh netters have gone
undefeated.
This year's team has ranked up
with the best of Coach Renker's
squads and has had sound men
all the way down the line. The
number one man on the frosh
squad, Dick Ogden, is a glittering
light in Stanford's tennis future.
Ogden has dropped only one
match all this year and that was
to Jim Watson, a rugged retriev
er from San Francisco City Col
lege's varsity squad.
Good Style
Ogden has the form and style
of play which could take him far
in his next few years as a varsity
netter. He hits good ground
strokes and moves with amazing
speed.
Right on Ogden's heels all year
has been Norm Karns. Karns is
a strong competitor and survived
his seven matches without a loss.
The I all frosh si ill needs work on
a rather unorthodox serve but is
definitely a good varsity pros
pect.
After Ogden and Karns and in
the second 'echelon are Ev Moul
ton, Phil Odegard and George
Bates. Moulton and Odegard are
undefeated and both have shown
consistently sound play this year.
Unfortunately their competition

has not been the host hut hnth
men have looked pood in intra
squad play as well as in matches.
Bates Improved
Bates is the number one im
provement story of this year's
frosh squad. He's settled down
over the season's matches and
has now gained a great deal of
needed confidence.
Finishing out this year's Pa
poose squad are Bob Baker, Phil
Huyck, Don Brobst, Lorin Wan
less and Maury Power. Baker,
Huyck and Brobst have all played
adequate tennis all year, but they
will need a lot of work to make
the varsity grade next year.
