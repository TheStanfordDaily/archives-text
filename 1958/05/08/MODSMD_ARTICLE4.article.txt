# Loads of Talent Seen In 'Call Me Madam'
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
There was lcit s of talent and
entertainment on display at Me
morial Auditorium last night as
Ram's Head rolled back the veil
from its 1!)">8 Spring Show, "Call
Me Madam." And it was a shame
that so few people were on hand
to see it.
Stars Betty Elch 1 e r, Stan
Throneherry, Carol McKenna and
William Kinsolving all combined
to lift this year's Spring Show
above the level of those presented
by the student group in recent
years. They are backed by a 32-
piece orchestra and 42-member
dancing chorus, and for the most
part all the performers pitch in
to put the production over the
top.
Leading Lady
Miss Eichler, a former Stanford
student returning to play the lead
role of Ambassador Sally Adams,
sings with a style and finesse
which .Ram's Head has not been
fortunate enough to find in its
other loading ladies.
Miss Eichler, though she does
n't look at all like her, busts out
with some real Ethel Merman-ish
phrasings as she romps through
her "Can You Use Any Money To
day?" and "Hostess with the
Mostest" numbers. And for those
who refuse to associate anyone
but Miss Merman with the role,
Miss Eichler is enough like her
where it counts to leave the audi
ence with few, if any, misgivings.
Necessary Brassi ness
Though like her in her musical
stylings, Miss Eichler does fail to
carry the role with all the neces
sary brassi ness which the show's
original imparted to the role. And
her failure to do this occasionally
makes her take a back seat in the
proceedings when she should
really be more in front. In these
moments Miss Eichler is not the
star that the show requires.
But these moments are not too
frequent, although disturbing
when they occur. She is at her
very best when she and Kinsolv
ing get involved with heart sick
ness in "You're Just in Love."
Last night's audience brought
them back for two encores on this
number.

Three other members of the
"Call Me Madam" cast are billed
only as "featured" performers,
an injustice to all three of them;
they are stars in their own right.
Lichlenburg's Prime Minister,
Cosmo Constantino, played by
Throneberry, is the show's only
perfect performer. Throneberry
is polished, has a rich voice, and
even looked well in the part. The
show is graced by his feeling for
the script.
But of these three, Miss Me-
Kenna, who plays Liehtenburg's
Princess Maria is the eye- and
ear-catcher. Miss McKenna uses
a combination German - French-
You-Name-It accent and does it
very effectively. She, like Throne
berry, is at home in the part, and
won the favor of tho first-night
ers with her renditions of "The
Ocarina" and "It's a Lovely Day
Today."
Kinsolving, "Madam's" Ken
neth Gibson, a member of Sally
Adams' diplomatic staff, is the
third of this trio. He is a veteran
performer, though not the lover
he is cut out to be. Besides the
failure of his amorous talent, he
and Miss McKenna sound like old
pros in "Lovely Day."
This year's show is directed by
Joe Regan. He has woven tho
various degrees of talent with
which he has had to work into a
very well-paced show. The Berlin-
Howard Lindsay • Mussel Grouse
script is not an easy one to per
form, and Ram's Head has done
well v\ ith it.
Regan is not solely responsible
for the show, and his production
stal 112 He i'vi*s s<iniv ore <lii ('bore
ographcr Joan Duncan had little
innate dancing talent in her
group, but still managed to brini;

thorn through the show with some
very impressive steps. If not tho
finesse, at least the idea was pres
ent in many of the numbers such
as "Washington Square Dance,"
"Something to Dance About" and
"It's a Lovely Day." Noel Turn
er's costumes, usually attractive,
were up to their usual par. John
Miller's orchestra sounded better
than those of the past.
Director Regan tried to tone
down tho original show's brassi
ness and slow down its original
pace. "Call Me Madam" is a fast
and brassy musical, and shouldn't
be played any other way. Tho at
tempt to change it makes it drag
in parts.
Although many of the political
witticisms seemed to soar above
the audience's heads, if those who
plan to see the show during its
run through the rest of the week
will bring their knowledge of 1950
politics with them, they can't but
be pleased with tho investment.
Curtain is at 8:30.
Tickets for the performance
range from $1.25 to $1.75.
