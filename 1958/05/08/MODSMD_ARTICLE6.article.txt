of a university's basic goal: to educate the students.
Some mav question our right to interfere in such an issue

that students are "somewhat in the position of pr< ferred or

appalls us.
Most earlv universities were established h\ the .-Indents
themselves. The facullv was chosen by the students and was
responsible to them. In the centuries since the Middle Ages,
student control of a university's academic life has been grad
ually appropriated by the facullv, and now rests almost
entirely in the bands of an administration far removed from
the desires of the students, whose good the iuii\ersily was
established to serve.

ministration is in a belter position to know what is best (or
the student's education than is the student. "After all, it is
pointed out, "if a student knew enough about a course to be
able to judge the professor s ability to teach it, be would not
be taking that course."
This mav be true to some extent; however, in the Sibley
ease we feel the facullv of the Political Science Department,

better position to judge a professor s merits.
