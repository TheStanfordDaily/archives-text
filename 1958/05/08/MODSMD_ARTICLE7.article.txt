# Students Put Policy tinder Fire
## 
### Wally Simpson 
The Administration's method of
faculty appointments leaves
something to he desired and the
philosophy behind the present
system should be investigated.
This was the general feeling of
a group of aroused students who
met yesterday afternoon in the
Political Science Department con
ference room to discuss the Ad
ministration's failure to appoint
Dr. Mulford Q. Sibley.
Extreme Disappoinlinent
Generally the group felt ex
treme disappointment in the de
cision of the Administration not
to appoint Sibley. As one mem
ber expressed it. "We feel a defi
nite tragedy in the fact that stu
dents at Stanford will no longer
have the opportunity to benefit
from the inspiration to study that
Sibley has been able to stimulate
in his students."
The general discussion centered
around the question of what, if
anything, could be done by stu
dents to demonstrate to the ad
ministration their disapproval of
the decision.
It was pointed out that as stu
dents "we have no rights to dis
pute the actions of the adminis
tration." But it was also pointed
out that a happy and successful
university must have the trust
and co-operation among all three
segments, the administration, the
faculty and the students.
Dangerous Situation
An especially dangerous situa
tion exists, one member said,
when two segments are opposed
to the decision of the third. In
this case, the faculty and students
of the-Political Science Depart
ment were in complete agreement
as to the desirability of keeping
Sibley at Stanford.
The question that many raised
was, "YVhy is it that the present
system allows one or two men to
overrule the unanimous approval
of the department concerned?"
The same group will meet
again today to decide what course
of action the students should take.
