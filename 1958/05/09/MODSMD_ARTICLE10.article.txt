"The principle as to what de
cree the Provost has a right to
veto an appointment approved by
a department is a valid one for
consideration," Professor Mul
ford Q. Sibley said yesterday af
ternoon.
"I know of no other instance in
any university," he said when
asked whether there is prece
dence for a professor to be denied
appointment in such cases,
"where such an appointment is
denied. The usual procedure is
for the administration to give the
department and the Dean the
final say in its choice."
"Usually," Sibley continued,
"the Provost does not pass on the
academic standing of the candi
date, but is concerned with the
question of available finances."
Dislikes Publicity
Sibley said he personally was
not too happy over the publicity
given him with regard to this
question, but if it would help to
improve the situation concerning
faculty appointments, then he felt
it was for a worthy cause.
Sibley was horn in Missouri 45
years ago and raised in Okla
homa. He received his A.B. at
the Central State College in Okla
homa and his M.A. at the Univer
sity of Oklahoma. He received
his Ph.D. in political science from
the University of Minnesota in
1938.
He started his academic career
as an instructor at the University
of Illinois in 1938 and left there
in 1948 as an assistant professor.
Hp returned to Minnesota as an
associate professor in 1918 and
then became a lull professor.

Sibley was Flditor of Publica
tions Section of the American Po
litical Science Review from 1914
to 1948 and is currently on the
Board of Editors of the Midwest
Journal of Political Science which
is published at the University of
Wisconsin. He is also Associate
Editor of Liberation Magazine, a
monthly journal.
Sibley said his appointment was
! approved by the Political Science
j Department around the middle of
j December and was approved by
I the Provost's Search Committee
j and the Dean of the School of llu-
I manities and Sciences around the
' end of March. His appointment
I remained in the President's Of
fice until last Tuesday when ac
-1 tion was finally taken upon it.
When asked if he would ac
cept an appointment if the 1 admin
istration should change their
minds and offer it to him, Sibley
; said, "I would certainly consider
I it very favorably."

Board of Editors of the Midwest
Journal of Political Science which

Wisconsin. He is also Associate
Editor of Liberation Magazine, a

Sibley said his appointment was
! approved by the Political Science
j Department around the middle of
j December and was approved by
I the Provost's Search Committee
j and the Dean of the School of llu-
I manities and Sciences around the
' end of March. His appointment
I remained in the President's Of
fice until last Tuesday when ac
-1 tion was finally taken upon it.
When asked if he would ac
cept an appointment if the 1 admin
istration should change their
minds and offer it to him, Sibley
; said, "I would certainly consider
I it very favorably."
"The principle as to what de
cree the Provost has a right to
veto an appointment approved by
a department is a valid one for
consideration," Professor Mul
ford Q. Sibley said yesterday af
ternoon.
"I know of no other instance in
any university," he said when
asked whether there is prece
dence for a professor to be denied
appointment in such cases,
"where such an appointment is
denied. The usual procedure is
for the administration to give the
department and the Dean the
final say in its choice."
"Usually," Sibley continued,
"the Provost does not pass on the
academic standing of the candi
date, but is concerned with the
question of available finances."
Dislikes Publicity
Sibley said he personally was
not too happy over the publicity
given him with regard to this
question, but if it would help to
improve the situation concerning
faculty appointments, then he felt
it was for a worthy cause.
