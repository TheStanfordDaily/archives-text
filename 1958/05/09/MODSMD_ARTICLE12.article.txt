# LASSU to Ask Administration to Reconsider, Give Cause for Denying Sibley Appointment
## 
### Barbara Hicks Staff Editor 
A resolution strongly urging
the Administration to reconsider
its refusal to appoint Professor
Mulford Q. Sibley and asking for
an explanation of the Administra
tive action was passed by Legis
lature last night after an hour
long debate.
Ten favored and four opposed
the resolution which was finally
approved as follows:
Resolved: that the Legislature
strongly urge tlie Administration
to reconsider its action regarding
Professor Mulford Q. Sibley and
to furnish the student body with
an explanation for its decision in
this matter.
Legislature turned down three
proposed resolutions before mak
ing its decision. The first was to
ask the Board of Trustees to in
vestigate the matter and the sec
ond urged the Administration to
reconsider. Both were submitted
by Stew Toy, editor of The Daily,
and were opposed by Legislature
members who said they would
not result in the receipt of the
desired information.
Third Proposal
The third was proposed by Jeff
Commons, Village representative,
who asked that the Administra
tion give its reasons for not ap
pointing Sibley to the Legislature
next week in executive session.
The resolution in its final form
was presented by Grace Mohns,
Moore representative.
Legislature members opposing
the first resolution argued that
the Legislature did not have
enough information to ask for a
reconsideration of Sibley's non
appointment.
A 1 Ferris, assistant financial
manager, said he felt the Admin
istrative views had not been ade
quately presented in the case and
the Legislature had no adequate
grounds to go to the Board.
"We're questioning the Admin
istration and should not go to the
Board." said Mary Richardson,
Women's Row representative.
Want to Know
When Legislature members
questioned the right of the stu
dents to ask the Administration
for its reasons. Miss Mohns main
tained that an explanation is defi
nitely in order to the students.
"The majority of the students
want to know why Sibley was not

appointed," Tom Kranz, Men's
Row representative, declared.
"This is our opportunity to repre
sent the students on something
concrete. Let's show the Adminis
tration that the students are in
terested."
"The Administration has said it
wants to know how students feel
on different matters," Toy point
ed out.
Backbone
"Let's show we have some
backbone," said V'icki Schwarz,
Union representative, "and not
shrivel up and die without trying
to do something wc feel the stu
dents want."
Tom Thuringer, Off - campus
representative, pointed out that
the Political Science Department
investigated Sibley's background
and still recommended him. The
Administration should he able to
show reasons why it still refused
to appoint him, Thuringer said.
Sam Donaldson, Busi n e s s
School representative, urged the
Legislature to show a little
strength.
"Such resolutions have been
passed on other campuses and the
Administration may actually re
consider," Donaldson said.
