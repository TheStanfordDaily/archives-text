### 
LIMA, Peru (/P) â€” Vice-Presi
dent Nixon was met by a hail of
rocks at ancient San Marcos Uni
versity yesterday. One stone
grazed his neck and another hit a
member of his Secret Service es
cort.
Some jeering students spat
upon the touring Vice-President.
He finally canceled a talk at San
Marcos, saying he feared some
one might be badly hurt.
Nixon was followed to his hotel
by Peruvians shouting "Get out."
But he got a friendly reception at
Catholic University. Even at San
Marcos some students shook his
hand.
Nixon told a news conference
later that Peruvian Foreign Min
ister Raul Porras gave him offi
cial and personal apologies for
desecration of the United States
flag.
No formal protest was made,
Nixon said.
