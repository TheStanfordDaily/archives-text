(Editor's Note: The Daily has, to dale, received a total of 2(J
letters to the editor questioning tlx' wisdom of the Administra

Political Science Department faculty. We have devoted as much
space as possible to printing letters on this vital controversy.)
Procrastination and Innuendo
Editor, The Daily:
Out of the confusion, the procrastination and innuendo which,
from the beginning, have characterized the Sibley affair, there comes
a fundamental question: Is Stanford University irrevocably com
mitted to an educational policy which is at odds not only with the
desires, but with the necessities of its students?
Why, we ask, must we lose this man who has brought knowledge
and inspiration to so many, graduates and undergraduates, who have
taken counsel with him or attended his courses? Is it because there
are alternative choices with greater "prestige" who have indicated
a desire to come to Stanford? We have heard of none; without a
permanent replacement we can only anticipate a continuation of
previous instability in the Department of Political Science —with all
of its detrimental effects.
Has Professor Sibley not been accepted because he has been out
spoken in his political views or shown other signs of eccentricity?
Is he, perhaps, too humble?
In the fall, Mr. Sibley will return to the University of Minnesota
as a full professor of political science. We are saddened by his de
parture. We do 1101 understand why it need be so.

6 Rest Thing I've Seen in The Daily 9
Editor, The Daily:
This morning's front page strikes me as possibly the best thing
I've ever seen in The Daily—or any other college paper, for that
matter.
A considered and yet STRONG statement of the issue, a LIVE
editorial and, best of all, a page devoted to something that should be
of ultimate concern to everyone.
You people have voiced something that everyone should feel—
and voiced it in a trenchant and intelligent manner.

T.ct the Winds of Freedom Blow
Editor, The Daily:
As political science majors and as students who have had the
opportunity of studying under Mr. Sibley, we are concerned with the
decision that Mr. Sibley ha/; not been rehired by the University.
Going beyond this decision, we are intensely interested in the issue
of education at Stanford. We have discussed the possible explana
tions why he was not rehired, keeping in mind the fact that we are
students and do not know all the Administration's reasons. We have
considered three possible factors determining this decision:
First, his ability as a teacher. Both students and Administration
have agreed on his ability to convey his subject matter in a manner
which is clear and interesting. Above all, he has the unquestioned
ability to stimulate students to think creatively. Mr. Sibley has stated
it is his hope that a student will leave his class questioning one fact
which heretofore he has accepted without questioning. We think this
statement is indicative of his unique caliber as a teacher and, to us,
is the essence of education.
Second, his depth and breadth as a scholar. The Administration
recognizes his depth as a scholar, but may have questioned his
breadth. We as students feel that his depth has been of great value
to us and is inseparable from his challenge for us to question our
ideas.
Third, his political views. Could there be an unspoken fear on the
part of the Administration that his political views are detrimental
to the students and the University? We cannot help but admire
Mr. Sibley's open statement in his first lecture every quarter regard
ing his political beliefs and affiliations. Mr. Sibley does not try to
convert his classes to his political views. Rather, a student who dis
agrees with him is encouraged to think through his own objections;
he is encouraged to give reasons for his belief.
Recently a Committee on Academic Affairs has been created by
the president to discuss raising the level of the intellectual atmos
phere at Stanford. When a professor whose teaching furthers this
goal is rejected, we cannot help hut wonder.
Although we may not be in full accord with Mr. Sibley's views,
wo believe . . . "Lot the winds of freedom blow."

/I Secret Trial
Editor, The Daily:
We gather that Professor Sibley does not know the reasons for
his non-appointment and is willing and anxious for these reasons to
be published.
What are the facts? Professor Sibley has an outstanding aca
demic record. He is regarded by his students as an excellent teacher.
He has the full support of the faculty of his department, and his sug
gested appointment was approved by Dean Rhinelander. In his short
stay here he has stimulated the thinking, and therefore the education,
of students throughout the University.
Yet his appointment was rejected. The means of rejection was,
in effect, a secret trial. The two main judges, the president and the
provost, neither knew him nor interviewed him; further, they are
not authorities in his field. They were, however, able to judge his
competence as a teacher and his suitability as a member of the
faculty.
This judgment is directly opposed to that of the faculty and stu
dents in his department. As a result, Stanford students are losing
an excellent teacher. WHY?

Faith in Administration Misplaced
Editor, The Daily:
I extend my sincere congratulations to The Stanford Daily for
its editorial comment and news coverage of the Mulford Q. Sibley
incident. I think the Administration is obligated to make official
comment regarding your thought-provoking questions and rational
protest.
Another result of the Sibley incident should be pointed up for the
student body. Professor James T. Watkins IV was discharged from
his post as head of the Political Science Department because he vig
orously expressed to the Administration the department's unanimous
conviction that Mr. Sibley was the best man for the available position.
Presumably the great private universities of this country are
among the few places where individual thoughts may be expressed
and pursued without fear of reprisal and intimidation. The Sibley
incident leads me to ask if the area of personal freedom is being
reduced at Stanford to the classrooms and to trusted friends.
Last year, as student body president, I had numerous occasions
to work with several members of the Administration. I placed con
siderable faith in the many highly competent people who run this
university. However, when a department head is discharged for accu
rately representing the unanimous conviction of his department, I
feel that my faith in the men responsible for this decision was grossly
misplaced.

'Extending the Bounds of Wisdom 9
Editor, The Daily:
Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter once said this; I cannot im
prove upon it:
"It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of open
mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible
citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and effective
public opinion. Teachers must fulfill their function by precept and
practice, by the very almosphere which they generate; they must
have the freedom of responsible inquiry, by thought and action, into
the meaning of social and economic dogma. They must be free to sift
evanescent doctrine, qualified by time and circumstance, from that
restless, enduring process of extending the bounds of understanding
and wisdom. . . .
"They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the
practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied to them."
William MeCraw
Adverse Conclusions Justified
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that The Daily should be complimented for bringing before
the students the dismissal of Mr. Sibley. It seems wonderful, in a
university so often accused of apathetic tendencies, that students
care enough about something to act as they have on it.
I don't know —nor do most of us—the facts behind the case, and
I don't feel that we should judge until we do know them. But I cer
tainly feel that we should examine this issue, and that the Adminis
tration owes us an explantion as to why Sibley was not reappointed.
If it does not explain, then we are certainly justified in coming
to adverse conclusions regarding the validity of its reasons, particu
larly since half of the facts have already come to light.

Hat Goes Off to Sibley
Editor, The Daily:
"The great principle of freedom of the press should operate just
as strongly on campus as elsewhere." It is regrettable that the
equally great principle of freedom of speech has not fared so well.
My hat goes off to Dr. Sibley, who in his short time at Stanford
has succeeded in an area in which the Administration has almost
totally failed, and has done what literally hundreds of Daily articles
on "apathy" have failed to do—that is, to awaken the Stanford stu
dent body to an active interest in current political affairs.

/I Secret Trial
Editor, The Daily:
We gather that Professor Sibley does not know the reasons for
his non-appointment and is willing and anxious for these reasons to
be published.
What are the facts? Professor Sibley has an outstanding aca
demic record. He is regarded by his students as an excellent teacher.
He has the full support of the faculty of his department, and his sug
gested appointment was approved by Dean Rhinelander. In his short
stay here he has stimulated the thinking, and therefore the education,
of students throughout the University.
Yet his appointment was rejected. The means of rejection was,
in effect, a secret trial. The two main judges, the president and the
provost, neither knew him nor interviewed him; further, they are
not authorities in his field. They were, however, able to judge his
competence as a teacher and his suitability as a member of the
faculty.
This judgment is directly opposed to that of the faculty and stu
dents in his department. As a result, Stanford students are losing
an excellent teacher. WHY?

Faith in Administration Misplaced
Editor, The Daily:
I extend my sincere congratulations to The Stanford Daily for
its editorial comment and news coverage of the Mulford Q. Sibley
incident. I think the Administration is obligated to make official
comment regarding your thought-provoking questions and rational
protest.
Another result of the Sibley incident should be pointed up for the
student body. Professor James T. Watkins IV was discharged from
his post as head of the Political Science Department because he vig
orously expressed to the Administration the department's unanimous
conviction that Mr. Sibley was the best man for the available position.
Presumably the great private universities of this country are
among the few places where individual thoughts may be expressed
and pursued without fear of reprisal and intimidation. The Sibley
incident leads me to ask if the area of personal freedom is being
reduced at Stanford to the classrooms and to trusted friends.
Last year, as student body president, I had numerous occasions
to work with several members of the Administration. I placed con
siderable faith in the many highly competent people who run this
university. However, when a department head is discharged for accu
rately representing the unanimous conviction of his department, I
feel that my faith in the men responsible for this decision was grossly
misplaced.

'Extending the Bounds of Wisdom 9
Editor, The Daily:
Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter once said this; I cannot im
prove upon it:
"It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of open
mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible
citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and effective
public opinion. Teachers must fulfill their function by precept and
practice, by the very almosphere which they generate; they must
have the freedom of responsible inquiry, by thought and action, into
the meaning of social and economic dogma. They must be free to sift
evanescent doctrine, qualified by time and circumstance, from that
restless, enduring process of extending the bounds of understanding
and wisdom. . . .
"They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the
practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied to them."

Adverse Conclusions Justified
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that The Daily should be complimented for bringing before
the students the dismissal of Mr. Sibley. It seems wonderful, in a
university so often accused of apathetic tendencies, that students
care enough about something to act as they have on it.
I don't know —nor do most of us—the facts behind the case, and
I don't feel that we should judge until we do know them. But I cer
tainly feel that we should examine this issue, and that the Adminis
tration owes us an explantion as to why Sibley was not reappointed.
If it does not explain, then we are certainly justified in coming
to adverse conclusions regarding the validity of its reasons, particu
larly since half of the facts have already come to light.

Hat Goes Off to Sibley
Editor, The Daily:
"The great principle of freedom of the press should operate just
as strongly on campus as elsewhere." It is regrettable that the
equally great principle of freedom of speech has not fared so well.
My hat goes off to Dr. Sibley, who in his short time at Stanford
has succeeded in an area in which the Administration has almost
totally failed, and has done what literally hundreds of Daily articles
on "apathy" have failed to do—that is, to awaken the Stanford stu
dent body to an active interest in current political affairs.
Robert L. King
(Editor's Note: The Daily has, to dale, received a total of 2(J
letters to the editor questioning tlx' wisdom of the Administra
tion's decision not to appoint Professor Mulford (|. Sibley to the
Political Science Department faculty. We have devoted as much
space as possible to printing letters on this vital controversy.)
Procrastination and Innuendo
Editor, The Daily:
Out of the confusion, the procrastination and innuendo which,
from the beginning, have characterized the Sibley affair, there comes
a fundamental question: Is Stanford University irrevocably com
mitted to an educational policy which is at odds not only with the
desires, but with the necessities of its students?
Why, we ask, must we lose this man who has brought knowledge
and inspiration to so many, graduates and undergraduates, who have
taken counsel with him or attended his courses? Is it because there
are alternative choices with greater "prestige" who have indicated
a desire to come to Stanford? We have heard of none; without a
permanent replacement we can only anticipate a continuation of
previous instability in the Department of Political Science —with all
of its detrimental effects.
Has Professor Sibley not been accepted because he has been out
spoken in his political views or shown other signs of eccentricity?
Is he, perhaps, too humble?
In the fall, Mr. Sibley will return to the University of Minnesota
as a full professor of political science. We are saddened by his de
parture. We do 1101 understand why it need be so.

6 Rest Thing I've Seen in The Daily 9
Editor, The Daily:
This morning's front page strikes me as possibly the best thing

matter.
A considered and yet STRONG statement of the issue, a LIVE

T.ct the Winds of Freedom Blow
Editor, The Daily:
As political science majors and as students who have had the
opportunity of studying under Mr. Sibley, we are concerned with the
decision that Mr. Sibley ha/; not been rehired by the University.
Going beyond this decision, we are intensely interested in the issue
of education at Stanford. We have discussed the possible explana
tions why he was not rehired, keeping in mind the fact that we are
students and do not know all the Administration's reasons. We have
considered three possible factors determining this decision:
First, his ability as a teacher. Both students and Administration
have agreed on his ability to convey his subject matter in a manner
which is clear and interesting. Above all, he has the unquestioned
ability to stimulate students to think creatively. Mr. Sibley has stated
it is his hope that a student will leave his class questioning one fact
which heretofore he has accepted without questioning. We think this
statement is indicative of his unique caliber as a teacher and, to us,
is the essence of education.
Second, his depth and breadth as a scholar. The Administration
recognizes his depth as a scholar, but may have questioned his
breadth. We as students feel that his depth has been of great value
to us and is inseparable from his challenge for us to question our
ideas.
Third, his political views. Could there be an unspoken fear on the
part of the Administration that his political views are detrimental
to the students and the University? We cannot help but admire
Mr. Sibley's open statement in his first lecture every quarter regard
ing his political beliefs and affiliations. Mr. Sibley does not try to
convert his classes to his political views. Rather, a student who dis
agrees with him is encouraged to think through his own objections;
he is encouraged to give reasons for his belief.
Recently a Committee on Academic Affairs has been created by
the president to discuss raising the level of the intellectual atmos
phere at Stanford. When a professor whose teaching furthers this
goal is rejected, we cannot help hut wonder.
Although we may not be in full accord with Mr. Sibley's views,

care enough about something to act as they have on it.
I don't know —nor do most of us—the facts behind the case, and
I don't feel that we should judge until we do know them. But I cer
tainly feel that we should examine this issue, and that the Adminis
tration owes us an explantion as to why Sibley was not reappointed.
If it does not explain, then we are certainly justified in coming
to adverse conclusions regarding the validity of its reasons, particu
larly since half of the facts have already come to light.

Hat Goes Off to Sibley
Editor, The Daily:
"The great principle of freedom of the press should operate just
as strongly on campus as elsewhere." It is regrettable that the
equally great principle of freedom of speech has not fared so well.
My hat goes off to Dr. Sibley, who in his short time at Stanford
has succeeded in an area in which the Administration has almost
totally failed, and has done what literally hundreds of Daily articles
on "apathy" have failed to do—that is, to awaken the Stanford stu
dent body to an active interest in current political affairs.
Robert L. King
(Editor's Note: The Daily has, to dale, received a total of 2(J
letters to the editor questioning tlx' wisdom of the Administra
tion's decision not to appoint Professor Mulford (|. Sibley to the
Political Science Department faculty. We have devoted as much
space as possible to printing letters on this vital controversy.)
Procrastination and Innuendo
Editor, The Daily:
Out of the confusion, the procrastination and innuendo which,
from the beginning, have characterized the Sibley affair, there comes
a fundamental question: Is Stanford University irrevocably com
mitted to an educational policy which is at odds not only with the
desires, but with the necessities of its students?
Why, we ask, must we lose this man who has brought knowledge
and inspiration to so many, graduates and undergraduates, who have
taken counsel with him or attended his courses? Is it because there
are alternative choices with greater "prestige" who have indicated
a desire to come to Stanford? We have heard of none; without a
permanent replacement we can only anticipate a continuation of
previous instability in the Department of Political Science —with all
of its detrimental effects.
Has Professor Sibley not been accepted because he has been out
spoken in his political views or shown other signs of eccentricity?
Is he, perhaps, too humble?
In the fall, Mr. Sibley will return to the University of Minnesota
as a full professor of political science. We are saddened by his de
parture. We do 1101 understand why it need be so.

6 Rest Thing I've Seen in The Daily 9
Editor, The Daily:
This morning's front page strikes me as possibly the best thing
I've ever seen in The Daily—or any other college paper, for that
matter.
A considered and yet STRONG statement of the issue, a LIVE

T.ct the Winds of Freedom Blow
Editor, The Daily:
As political science majors and as students who have had the
opportunity of studying under Mr. Sibley, we are concerned with the
decision that Mr. Sibley ha/; not been rehired by the University.
Going beyond this decision, we are intensely interested in the issue
of education at Stanford. We have discussed the possible explana
tions why he was not rehired, keeping in mind the fact that we are
students and do not know all the Administration's reasons. We have
considered three possible factors determining this decision:
First, his ability as a teacher. Both students and Administration
have agreed on his ability to convey his subject matter in a manner
which is clear and interesting. Above all, he has the unquestioned
ability to stimulate students to think creatively. Mr. Sibley has stated
it is his hope that a student will leave his class questioning one fact
which heretofore he has accepted without questioning. We think this
statement is indicative of his unique caliber as a teacher and, to us,
is the essence of education.
Second, his depth and breadth as a scholar. The Administration
recognizes his depth as a scholar, but may have questioned his
breadth. We as students feel that his depth has been of great value
to us and is inseparable from his challenge for us to question our
ideas.
Third, his political views. Could there be an unspoken fear on the
part of the Administration that his political views are detrimental
to the students and the University? We cannot help but admire
Mr. Sibley's open statement in his first lecture every quarter regard
ing his political beliefs and affiliations. Mr. Sibley does not try to
convert his classes to his political views. Rather, a student who dis
agrees with him is encouraged to think through his own objections;
he is encouraged to give reasons for his belief.
Recently a Committee on Academic Affairs has been created by
the president to discuss raising the level of the intellectual atmos
phere at Stanford. When a professor whose teaching furthers this
goal is rejected, we cannot help hut wonder.
Although we may not be in full accord with Mr. Sibley's views,
wo believe . . . "Lot the winds of freedom blow."

/I Secret Trial
Editor, The Daily:
We gather that Professor Sibley does not know the reasons for
his non-appointment and is willing and anxious for these reasons to
be published.
What are the facts? Professor Sibley has an outstanding aca
demic record. He is regarded by his students as an excellent teacher.
He has the full support of the faculty of his department, and his sug
gested appointment was approved by Dean Rhinelander. In his short
stay here he has stimulated the thinking, and therefore the education,
of students throughout the University.
Yet his appointment was rejected. The means of rejection was,
in effect, a secret trial. The two main judges, the president and the
provost, neither knew him nor interviewed him; further, they are
not authorities in his field. They were, however, able to judge his
competence as a teacher and his suitability as a member of the
faculty.
This judgment is directly opposed to that of the faculty and stu
dents in his department. As a result, Stanford students are losing
an excellent teacher. WHY?

Faith in Administration Misplaced
Editor, The Daily:
I extend my sincere congratulations to The Stanford Daily for
its editorial comment and news coverage of the Mulford Q. Sibley
incident. I think the Administration is obligated to make official
comment regarding your thought-provoking questions and rational
protest.
Another result of the Sibley incident should be pointed up for the
student body. Professor James T. Watkins IV was discharged from
his post as head of the Political Science Department because he vig
orously expressed to the Administration the department's unanimous
conviction that Mr. Sibley was the best man for the available position.
Presumably the great private universities of this country are
among the few places where individual thoughts may be expressed
and pursued without fear of reprisal and intimidation. The Sibley
incident leads me to ask if the area of personal freedom is being
reduced at Stanford to the classrooms and to trusted friends.
Last year, as student body president, I had numerous occasions
to work with several members of the Administration. I placed con
siderable faith in the many highly competent people who run this
university. However, when a department head is discharged for accu
rately representing the unanimous conviction of his department, I
feel that my faith in the men responsible for this decision was grossly
misplaced.

'Extending the Bounds of Wisdom 9
Editor, The Daily:
Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter once said this; I cannot im
prove upon it:
"It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of open
mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible
citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and effective
public opinion. Teachers must fulfill their function by precept and
practice, by the very almosphere which they generate; they must
have the freedom of responsible inquiry, by thought and action, into
the meaning of social and economic dogma. They must be free to sift
evanescent doctrine, qualified by time and circumstance, from that
restless, enduring process of extending the bounds of understanding
and wisdom. . . .
"They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the

have agreed on his ability to convey his subject matter in a manner
which is clear and interesting. Above all, he has the unquestioned
ability to stimulate students to think creatively. Mr. Sibley has stated
it is his hope that a student will leave his class questioning one fact
which heretofore he has accepted without questioning. We think this
statement is indicative of his unique caliber as a teacher and, to us,
is the essence of education.
Second, his depth and breadth as a scholar. The Administration
recognizes his depth as a scholar, but may have questioned his
breadth. We as students feel that his depth has been of great value
to us and is inseparable from his challenge for us to question our
ideas.
Third, his political views. Could there be an unspoken fear on the
part of the Administration that his political views are detrimental
to the students and the University? We cannot help but admire
Mr. Sibley's open statement in his first lecture every quarter regard
ing his political beliefs and affiliations. Mr. Sibley does not try to
convert his classes to his political views. Rather, a student who dis
agrees with him is encouraged to think through his own objections;
he is encouraged to give reasons for his belief.
Recently a Committee on Academic Affairs has been created by
the president to discuss raising the level of the intellectual atmos
phere at Stanford. When a professor whose teaching furthers this
goal is rejected, we cannot help hut wonder.
Although we may not be in full accord with Mr. Sibley's views,
wo believe . . . "Lot the winds of freedom blow."

/I Secret Trial
Editor, The Daily:
We gather that Professor Sibley does not know the reasons for
his non-appointment and is willing and anxious for these reasons to
be published.
What are the facts? Professor Sibley has an outstanding aca
demic record. He is regarded by his students as an excellent teacher.
He has the full support of the faculty of his department, and his sug
gested appointment was approved by Dean Rhinelander. In his short
stay here he has stimulated the thinking, and therefore the education,
of students throughout the University.
Yet his appointment was rejected. The means of rejection was,
in effect, a secret trial. The two main judges, the president and the
provost, neither knew him nor interviewed him; further, they are
not authorities in his field. They were, however, able to judge his
competence as a teacher and his suitability as a member of the
faculty.
This judgment is directly opposed to that of the faculty and stu
dents in his department. As a result, Stanford students are losing
an excellent teacher. WHY?

Faith in Administration Misplaced
Editor, The Daily:
I extend my sincere congratulations to The Stanford Daily for
its editorial comment and news coverage of the Mulford Q. Sibley
incident. I think the Administration is obligated to make official
comment regarding your thought-provoking questions and rational
protest.
Another result of the Sibley incident should be pointed up for the
student body. Professor James T. Watkins IV was discharged from
his post as head of the Political Science Department because he vig
orously expressed to the Administration the department's unanimous
conviction that Mr. Sibley was the best man for the available position.
Presumably the great private universities of this country are
among the few places where individual thoughts may be expressed
and pursued without fear of reprisal and intimidation. The Sibley
incident leads me to ask if the area of personal freedom is being
reduced at Stanford to the classrooms and to trusted friends.
Last year, as student body president, I had numerous occasions
to work with several members of the Administration. I placed con
siderable faith in the many highly competent people who run this
university. However, when a department head is discharged for accu
rately representing the unanimous conviction of his department, I
feel that my faith in the men responsible for this decision was grossly
misplaced.

'Extending the Bounds of Wisdom 9
Editor, The Daily:
Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter once said this; I cannot im
prove upon it:
"It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of open
mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible
citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and effective
public opinion. Teachers must fulfill their function by precept and
practice, by the very almosphere which they generate; they must
have the freedom of responsible inquiry, by thought and action, into
the meaning of social and economic dogma. They must be free to sift
evanescent doctrine, qualified by time and circumstance, from that
restless, enduring process of extending the bounds of understanding
and wisdom. . . .
"They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the
practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied to them."

Adverse Conclusions Justified
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that The Daily should be complimented for bringing before
the students the dismissal of Mr. Sibley. It seems wonderful, in a
university so often accused of apathetic tendencies, that students
care enough about something to act as they have on it.
I don't know —nor do most of us—the facts behind the case, and
I don't feel that we should judge until we do know them. But I cer
tainly feel that we should examine this issue, and that the Adminis
tration owes us an explantion as to why Sibley was not reappointed.
If it does not explain, then we are certainly justified in coming
to adverse conclusions regarding the validity of its reasons, particu
larly since half of the facts have already come to light.

Hat Goes Off to Sibley
Editor, The Daily:
"The great principle of freedom of the press should operate just
as strongly on campus as elsewhere." It is regrettable that the
equally great principle of freedom of speech has not fared so well.
My hat goes off to Dr. Sibley, who in his short time at Stanford
has succeeded in an area in which the Administration has almost
totally failed, and has done what literally hundreds of Daily articles
on "apathy" have failed to do—that is, to awaken the Stanford stu
dent body to an active interest in current political affairs.
Robert L. King
(Editor's Note: The Daily has, to dale, received a total of 2(J
letters to the editor questioning tlx' wisdom of the Administra
tion's decision not to appoint Professor Mulford (|. Sibley to the
Political Science Department faculty. We have devoted as much
space as possible to printing letters on this vital controversy.)
Procrastination and Innuendo
Editor, The Daily:
Out of the confusion, the procrastination and innuendo which,
from the beginning, have characterized the Sibley affair, there comes
a fundamental question: Is Stanford University irrevocably com
mitted to an educational policy which is at odds not only with the
desires, but with the necessities of its students?
Why, we ask, must we lose this man who has brought knowledge
and inspiration to so many, graduates and undergraduates, who have
taken counsel with him or attended his courses? Is it because there
are alternative choices with greater "prestige" who have indicated
a desire to come to Stanford? We have heard of none; without a
permanent replacement we can only anticipate a continuation of
previous instability in the Department of Political Science —with all
of its detrimental effects.
Has Professor Sibley not been accepted because he has been out
spoken in his political views or shown other signs of eccentricity?
Is he, perhaps, too humble?
In the fall, Mr. Sibley will return to the University of Minnesota
as a full professor of political science. We are saddened by his de
parture. We do 1101 understand why it need be so.

'Extending the Bounds of Wisdom 9
Editor, The Daily:
Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter once said this; I cannot im
prove upon it:
"It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of open
mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible
citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and effective
public opinion. Teachers must fulfill their function by precept and
practice, by the very almosphere which they generate; they must
have the freedom of responsible inquiry, by thought and action, into
the meaning of social and economic dogma. They must be free to sift
evanescent doctrine, qualified by time and circumstance, from that
restless, enduring process of extending the bounds of understanding
and wisdom. . . .
"They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the
practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied to them."

Adverse Conclusions Justified
Editor, The Daily:
I feel that The Daily should be complimented for bringing before
the students the dismissal of Mr. Sibley. It seems wonderful, in a
university so often accused of apathetic tendencies, that students
care enough about something to act as they have on it.
I don't know —nor do most of us—the facts behind the case, and
I don't feel that we should judge until we do know them. But I cer
tainly feel that we should examine this issue, and that the Adminis
tration owes us an explantion as to why Sibley was not reappointed.
If it does not explain, then we are certainly justified in coming
to adverse conclusions regarding the validity of its reasons, particu
larly since half of the facts have already come to light.

Hat Goes Off to Sibley
Editor, The Daily:
"The great principle of freedom of the press should operate just
as strongly on campus as elsewhere." It is regrettable that the
equally great principle of freedom of speech has not fared so well.
My hat goes off to Dr. Sibley, who in his short time at Stanford
has succeeded in an area in which the Administration has almost
totally failed, and has done what literally hundreds of Daily articles
on "apathy" have failed to do—that is, to awaken the Stanford stu
dent body to an active interest in current political affairs.
Robert L. King
(Editor's Note: The Daily has, to dale, received a total of 2(J
letters to the editor questioning tlx' wisdom of the Administra
tion's decision not to appoint Professor Mulford (|. Sibley to the
Political Science Department faculty. We have devoted as much
space as possible to printing letters on this vital controversy.)
Procrastination and Innuendo
Editor, The Daily:
Out of the confusion, the procrastination and innuendo which,
from the beginning, have characterized the Sibley affair, there comes
a fundamental question: Is Stanford University irrevocably com
mitted to an educational policy which is at odds not only with the
desires, but with the necessities of its students?
Why, we ask, must we lose this man who has brought knowledge
and inspiration to so many, graduates and undergraduates, who have
taken counsel with him or attended his courses? Is it because there
are alternative choices with greater "prestige" who have indicated
a desire to come to Stanford? We have heard of none; without a
permanent replacement we can only anticipate a continuation of
previous instability in the Department of Political Science —with all
of its detrimental effects.
Has Professor Sibley not been accepted because he has been out
spoken in his political views or shown other signs of eccentricity?
Is he, perhaps, too humble?
In the fall, Mr. Sibley will return to the University of Minnesota
as a full professor of political science. We are saddened by his de
parture. We do 1101 understand why it need be so.

6 Rest Thing I've Seen in The Daily 9
Editor, The Daily:
This morning's front page strikes me as possibly the best thing
I've ever seen in The Daily—or any other college paper, for that
matter.
A considered and yet STRONG statement of the issue, a LIVE
editorial and, best of all, a page devoted to something that should be
of ultimate concern to everyone.
You people have voiced something that everyone should feel—
and voiced it in a trenchant and intelligent manner.

T.ct the Winds of Freedom Blow
Editor, The Daily:
As political science majors and as students who have had the
opportunity of studying under Mr. Sibley, we are concerned with the
decision that Mr. Sibley ha/; not been rehired by the University.
Going beyond this decision, we are intensely interested in the issue
of education at Stanford. We have discussed the possible explana
tions why he was not rehired, keeping in mind the fact that we are
students and do not know all the Administration's reasons. We have
considered three possible factors determining this decision:
First, his ability as a teacher. Both students and Administration
have agreed on his ability to convey his subject matter in a manner
which is clear and interesting. Above all, he has the unquestioned
ability to stimulate students to think creatively. Mr. Sibley has stated
it is his hope that a student will leave his class questioning one fact
which heretofore he has accepted without questioning. We think this
statement is indicative of his unique caliber as a teacher and, to us,
is the essence of education.
Second, his depth and breadth as a scholar. The Administration
recognizes his depth as a scholar, but may have questioned his
breadth. We as students feel that his depth has been of great value
to us and is inseparable from his challenge for us to question our
ideas.
Third, his political views. Could there be an unspoken fear on the
part of the Administration that his political views are detrimental
to the students and the University? We cannot help but admire
Mr. Sibley's open statement in his first lecture every quarter regard
ing his political beliefs and affiliations. Mr. Sibley does not try to
convert his classes to his political views. Rather, a student who dis
agrees with him is encouraged to think through his own objections;
he is encouraged to give reasons for his belief.
Recently a Committee on Academic Affairs has been created by
the president to discuss raising the level of the intellectual atmos
phere at Stanford. When a professor whose teaching furthers this
goal is rejected, we cannot help hut wonder.
Although we may not be in full accord with Mr. Sibley's views,
wo believe . . . "Lot the winds of freedom blow."

/I Secret Trial
Editor, The Daily:
We gather that Professor Sibley does not know the reasons for
his non-appointment and is willing and anxious for these reasons to
be published.
What are the facts? Professor Sibley has an outstanding aca
demic record. He is regarded by his students as an excellent teacher.
He has the full support of the faculty of his department, and his sug
gested appointment was approved by Dean Rhinelander. In his short
stay here he has stimulated the thinking, and therefore the education,
of students throughout the University.
Yet his appointment was rejected. The means of rejection was,
in effect, a secret trial. The two main judges, the president and the
provost, neither knew him nor interviewed him; further, they are
not authorities in his field. They were, however, able to judge his
competence as a teacher and his suitability as a member of the
faculty.
This judgment is directly opposed to that of the faculty and stu
dents in his department. As a result, Stanford students are losing
an excellent teacher. WHY?

Faith in Administration Misplaced
Editor, The Daily:
I extend my sincere congratulations to The Stanford Daily for
its editorial comment and news coverage of the Mulford Q. Sibley
incident. I think the Administration is obligated to make official
comment regarding your thought-provoking questions and rational
protest.
Another result of the Sibley incident should be pointed up for the
student body. Professor James T. Watkins IV was discharged from
his post as head of the Political Science Department because he vig
orously expressed to the Administration the department's unanimous
conviction that Mr. Sibley was the best man for the available position.
Presumably the great private universities of this country are
among the few places where individual thoughts may be expressed
and pursued without fear of reprisal and intimidation. The Sibley
incident leads me to ask if the area of personal freedom is being
reduced at Stanford to the classrooms and to trusted friends.
Last year, as student body president, I had numerous occasions
to work with several members of the Administration. I placed con
siderable faith in the many highly competent people who run this
university. However, when a department head is discharged for accu
