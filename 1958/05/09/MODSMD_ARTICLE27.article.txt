All three teams look to be
about even after the 110, 880 and
1320 legs. That would leave ihe
decision up to milers Lloyd,
Hodgson and Don Bowden. They
arc three of the four fastest in
the U.S. so far this year.
The Tro jans and Tigers appear
to be the likely co-favorites in the
two-mile event, with Cal and
Stanford battling for third. The
Indians' team of Bob Monzingo,
Lassen, Cunliffe and Lloyd would
normally be right with the lead-

On the other hand, the speedy

If the baton passes go right,
the Indians' sprint relay teams
of Ben Anixter, Len Bates, Norm
Pease and Dean Smith could be
the surprises of the meet.
Stanford will also send individ
uals to compete in four field
events. Heading the parade will
be four broad-jumpers who are
within seven inches of each other
—Kent Hansen (24-lVa), John
Kelly (24-0), Brooks Townsend
(new frosh record-holder at 23-
10V&), and A 1 Peterson (23-6 1 /k).
Franchetti to Vault
Mike Franchetti will try for his
third trip over 14 feet in the pole
vault, and John Stahlcr will be
gunning for his first. Stabler
made it up to 1.3-8 in the Big
Meet, and is coming along fast
after an early-season leg injury.
Jerry Winters, the Cards' fast
improving soph shot-putter, will
compete along with Chris Plain.
Winters will be aiming for the
elusive 53-foot mark. Frosh rec
ord-holder Bob Atkinson will also
be in the shot.
Hansen may also go in the jav
elin, and it's a certainty that Jim
Backstrand will throw the spear.
Smith, Anixter and Pease will all
be in the open 100 against Cal's
Willie White and San Jose's Ray
Norton, the co-favorites.

gunning for his first. Stabler

Jerry Winters, the Cards' fast
