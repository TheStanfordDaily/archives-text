# Scrimmage Set For Tomorrow
## 
### 
Jack Curtice will send his Stan
ford gridders through their first
Stadium scrimmage of the year
tomorrow at 2 p.m. The workout
isn't expected to come too close
to game conditions, but should
nonetheless prove to be an inter
esting contest.
The principal scrimmage of the
year will be held May 17 in the
Stadium. It will be played under
game conditions, and fans will be
provided with programs and p.a.
announcing.
