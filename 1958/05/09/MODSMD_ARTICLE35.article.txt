# Do-or-Die Time In Card Baseball
## 
### 
Stanford gets its final crack of
the season at USC in a two-game
series today and tomorrow, and
if the Indians plan on doing any
thing about making a run for the
CIBA pennant, they'll have to
come home with a pair of Victo
ries.
The near • invincible Trojans
lead the league with an impres
sive 8-1 record. They're three
games ahead of the 6-5 Indians.
Even should Stanford win both
games, the Cards would still trail
by two in the vital loss column.
Thus Troy would have to lose two
more of its final five games while
the Indians swept their last ihree
aga in s t California and Santa
Clara.
I'CC Situation Similar
The situation is almost the
same in the concurrent but al
most unnoticed PCC southern di
vision race. The southern divi
sion race is the same as the CIBA
fight, except that games with

Santa Clara don't count in loop
standings.
Stanford's biggest problem will
be to contain the powerful Tro
jan bats. USC has battered en
emy hurling at a mark well over
.300, and boasts five of the top
eight hitters in the CIBA.
No Exceptions
Stanford hurling was no excep
tion as Troy pounded out 10-5 and
1.3-3 victories over the Indians in
a mid-April double-header here.
Tribe coach Dutch Fehring is
expected to lead with his ace
southpaw, Bob Leopold, in this
afternoon's Bovard Field contest.
Although Leopold was hit freely
up here, he has plenty of fond
memories of the Trojan home
grounds.
There last year, he no-hit USC
over the full nine-inning route,
producing one of the finest games
ever hurled by a Stanford pitcher.
Avery or Williams
Either George Avery or Dick
Williams will get the nod in the
Saturday game, possibly depend
ing on how well USC seems to

like left-handed hurling. The Tro
jans ate up Williams' southpaw
slants the last time he faced
them, rolling up six runs on six
hits—all in one-third of an in
ning.
Avery hasn't thrown against
USC this year, since he had
pitched a complete game against
Santa Clara the day before the
Trojan twin-bill.
The Stanford line-up is expect
ed to read Harry Rodda, cf; Joel
Newkirk, lb; A 1 Shaw, 2b; Ralph
Holding, c; Ben Robinson, If;
Rich DeFabio, rf; Jim Burk, 3b;
Bob Dwight, ss; and the pitcher.

Stanford gets its final crack of
the season at USC in a two-game
series today and tomorrow, and
if the Indians plan on doing any
thing about making a run for the
CIBA pennant, they'll have to
come home with a pair of Victo
ries.
The near • invincible Trojans
lead the league with an impres
sive 8-1 record. They're three
games ahead of the 6-5 Indians.
Even should Stanford win both
games, the Cards would still trail
by two in the vital loss column.
Thus Troy would have to lose two
more of its final five games while
the Indians swept their last ihree
aga in s t California and Santa
Clara.
I'CC Situation Similar
The situation is almost the
same in the concurrent but al
most unnoticed PCC southern di
vision race. The southern divi
sion race is the same as the CIBA
fight, except that games with

Santa Clara don't count in loop
standings.
Stanford's biggest problem will
be to contain the powerful Tro
jan bats. USC has battered en
emy hurling at a mark well over
.300, and boasts five of the top
eight hitters in the CIBA.
No Exceptions
Stanford hurling was no excep
tion as Troy pounded out 10-5 and
1.3-3 victories over the Indians in
a mid-April double-header here.
Tribe coach Dutch Fehring is
expected to lead with his ace
southpaw, Bob Leopold, in this
afternoon's Bovard Field contest.
Although Leopold was hit freely
up here, he has plenty of fond
memories of the Trojan home
grounds.
There last year, he no-hit USC
over the full nine-inning route,
producing one of the finest games
ever hurled by a Stanford pitcher.
Avery or Williams
Either George Avery or Dick
Williams will get the nod in the
Saturday game, possibly depend
ing on how well USC seems to

like left-handed hurling. The Tro
jans ate up Williams' southpaw
slants the last time he faced
them, rolling up six runs on six
hits—all in one-third of an in
ning.
Avery hasn't thrown against
USC this year, since he had
pitched a complete game against
Santa Clara the day before the
Trojan twin-bill.
The Stanford line-up is expect
ed to read Harry Rodda, cf; Joel
Newkirk, lb; A 1 Shaw, 2b; Ralph
Holding, c; Ben Robinson, If;
Rich DeFabio, rf; Jim Burk, 3b;
Bob Dwight, ss; and the pitcher.
