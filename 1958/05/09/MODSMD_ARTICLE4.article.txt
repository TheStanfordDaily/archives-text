# Students Roused, Gather To Plan Shows of Protest
## 
### 
Repercussions from the four corners of the Quad were felt yester
day as students met in informal and spontaneous groups to protest
and discuss the administration's decision to denuy appointment of
Mulford Q. Sibley to the staff of the Political Science Department.
The President's Office announced yesterday that Sibley, currently

a visiting professor from the Uni
versity of Minnesota, would not
ho appointed to the faculty. His
case was not taken to the Board
of Trustees, although he had the
whole-hearted support of the Po
litical Science Department.
One protesting group met in
Union Court at noon yesterday
and tentatively planned a protest
demonstration for early next
week.
Students Need Voice
Emphasis was placed upon the
necessity for presenting a logical
and definite proposal before the
students that would gain the sup
port of the whole student body.
Not only was the question of Sib
ley's non-appointment given con
siderable thought, but also the
farther-reaching question of stu
dent voice in matters of this sort.
"We must indelibly impress
upon the minds of the administra
tion that they cannot arbitrarily
reach decisions of such great im
pact upon the students without
giving them some form of expla
nation or voice in the decision," a
leader of the group said.
This group will meet at noon
again tomorrow in Union Court
to continue plans for future ac
tion.
(The Administration issued a
statement yesterday reiterating
its past position that it will in no
way release any information on
faculty appointments.)
Plans of Action
A number of students suggest
ed a general student strike of
some kind -possibly a boycott of
classes. However, the general
feeling was that this would not
affect any action, though it would
be spectacular.
Letters and petitions are being
planned and circulated among the
living groups and political science
classes to co-ordinate feelings
and gather specific requests to
be presented to the administra
tion.
Various groups have offered to
raise money to support Sibley at
Stanford next year. One of these
proposed enterprises would be a
variety show, possibly sponsored
by Ram's Head, to which admis
sion would be charged.
