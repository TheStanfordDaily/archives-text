# Sterling Gives Administration Stand
## Political Views Not Factor in Sibley Case 
### 
In an unprecedented move Fri
day President Wallace Sterling
issued a statement regarding the
non - appointment of Professor
Mulford Q. Sibley.
A c c or d in g to the prepared
statement which was released af
ter Sterling met with an ad hoc
committee of live students:
• The University has the high
est respect for Mr. Sibley who
has done extremely well in his
year at Stanford as a visiting pro
fessor.
• If Mr. Sibley's political views
were a factor, they would have
been considered when ho was in
vited here as a visiting professor.
The diversity of political views
among Stanford's present faculty,
and the University's record in de
fending freedom of inquiry and
freedom of speech, confirm the
fact that political beliefs are not
an issue in this case.
"Whole" Considered
(According to both the Palo
Alto Times and the San Francisco
Chronicle, a University figure had
said earlier, "Dr. Sibley's political
activities were not a controlling
factor in the decision. However,
when a person is considered for
appointment, he is considered as
a whole and you can't overlook
any activity.")
• Th e recommendation re
ceived by the President's Office
from the School of Humanities
and Sciences with respect to a
permanent appointment for Mr.
Sibley was not, as some public
accounts have stated, unanimous
and without reservation.
(A reliable source has con
firmed that there were no votes
against Sibley's appointment.
However, one member of the
Search Committee is reported to
have abstained.)
® Since the case has been thor
oughly considered already, it is
considered closed as far as the
University is concerned.
Five Students
The five students who met with
Sterling are Craig Barnes, lIR
president; Peter Grothe, gradu
ate student in political science,
Head Wilbur Sponsor Dwight
Clark, Legislature representative
(irace Mohns from Florence
Moore, and Women's Council
member Phyllis Turner.
Following the meeting with this
group of five, Sterling also met
with Daily Editor Stew Toy and
former editor Wally Simpson.
What was discussed in these two
conferences cannot be published
as the students were notified in
the beginning that what was said
would be "strictly off the rec
ord."
Professor Sibley was denied ap
pointment by the Office of the
President last week ostensibly be
cause he did not meet the Univer
sity's standards for scholarship
and research. The Administration
has released no details on this,
nor has it officially announced
the reason for non-appointment.
Still in Error
All the students who met with
Sterling were in agreement that
I hey still felt the administration
had erred in not giving Sibley an
appointment. However, they said,
"we feel, quite certain that the
administration did not take this
action because of Sibley's politi
cal beliefs."
There appeared to be great dis
satisfaction on the part of those
students who waited in front of
I lie President's Office to hear the
results of the conference. This
manifested itself primarily over
the unwillingness of Sterling to
publicly give the student body an
explanation rather than "trying
to stifle student protest by con
fiding in just a very few student
leaders."
