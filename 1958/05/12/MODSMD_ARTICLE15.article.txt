# No 'Lightning Rod' Committee
## 
### 
President Sterling and other administrative
officials have offered to meet with 12 students
in a panel discussion today over the relative
merits of teaching versus research.
This is a very important question which
merits considerable study among both students
and faculty, because in the final analysis the
best of all possible educations that students are
primarily interested in obtaining depends upon
the policy formulated upon the outcomes of
such discussions.
The University is to be commended for al
lowing students to participate in such a vital
field. However, it is not enough that just a

select few he honored .by having their opinions
heard by the Administration and hv being al
lowed to hear the views of the president. We
cannot afford to make of this discussion group
a "lightning rod" committee which will attract
all the unrest on campus over the non-appoint
ment of Dr. Sibley and bury it beneath an
avalanche of pure talk which itself cannot even
be published.
The central issue is, and remains: Has the
Administration erred by arbitrarily deciding
on Sibley's non-appointment rather than bv
making a rational decisionâ€”on the merits of
Sibley as a professor of political theory? The
president has not convinced us of the latter.
