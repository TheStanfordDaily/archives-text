History Made by 4 Deviates'
Editor, The Daily:
Several years ago I had the opportunity to
study political theory under Professor Mulford
Sibley at the University of Minnesota. I found
his classes and his personal interest in students
an experience as stimulating and intellectually
challenging as has apparently been the experi
ence of many students this year at Stanford.
There is no question that Sibley holds convic
tions on public issues which are often at variance
with the "popular" or commonly-accepted view
point, and that he expresses his convictions vig
orously and at times vociferously.
It seems to me most unfortunate that a univer
sity of major rank such as Stanford has not
chosen to select for its faculty a man of precisely
this nature, especially in view of the strong rec
ommendations of his colleagues. The history of
the progress of the sciences and the humanities
is marked by the achievements of the "deviate"
and the "unpopular."
The value to the university student of the op
portunity to hear and to evaluate a well-expressed
viewpoint which is different from the typical one,
and which may be different from his own, seems
to me to be very great.

Deplore Sibley Refusal
Editor, The Daily:
Copy of a telegram sent to President Sterling:
As alumnus and former graduate instructor at
Stanford I deplore the provost's refusal to for
ward strong recommendations for Dr. Sibley's
permanent appointment and your evident refusal
to reverse the provost's decision, obviously be
cause of Sibley's convictions against continued
nuclear testing—a conviction shared by many
loyal and thoughtful citizens of the country. Such
stifling of ideas parallels the firing of instructors
in Stanford's early days because of their "radi
cal" belief in municipal utilities. You are making
a mockery of the motto "Let the Winds of Free
dom Plow" and of the principles of academic
freedom.

Editor, The Daily:
As one of the five students who went to argue
on behalf of Dr. Sibley with the president, I feel
that a report is due to those who are so properly

exercised about this controversy.
First, I want to make it clear that we were
told things in confidence, and I cannot, of course,
break that confidence. Nevertheless, I can report
this:
(1) The case for Dr. Sibley is a strong one.
That case was presented vigorously, at length
and in detail.
(2) It is clear that Dr. Sibley's political views
did not control the decision. Dr. Sterling cited
chapter and verse, and convinced us beyond any
doubt of this.
(3) Procedurally speaking, the case was not an
unusual one. Precedents were listed.
(4) The president is correct in not releasing
details as to why Dr. Sibley was not given a
tenure appointment. This is standard procedure
at all American universities, and any university
which did state reasons why a particular instruc
tor was not given an appointment would immedi
ately encounter difficulty in getting professors
to come on a look-and-see basis.
Having said this, I should want to say some
thing else: I went into the meeting with the
president convinced that Mulford Sibley was an
immensely gifted teacher and a highly qualified
researcher, and that his loss to Stanford would
be a monumental one. I walked out, after two
and one-half hours, not changed in this conviction
one iota.
The decision of the Administration was a care
ful one, animated by a desire to do what was best
for Stanford. It was not, I believe, a good de
cision. The loss of this compelling teacher is not
sad; it is tragic. The basic issue of the type of
teaching the students receive is not dead.

Copy of a telegram sent to President Sterling:
As formerly proud Stanford alumni, my wife
and I arc shocked and dismayed at Provost Ter
man's veto of Professor Mulford Sibley's perma
nent appointment. As a graduate student in po
litical science, I know that Sibley has one of the
finest reputations as a scholar and a teacher in
his profession. We earnestly request that you
and the Board of Trustees conduct a special in
vestigation into this malter. If it is true that
Sibley was not reappointed because of his politi
cal ideas and activities, then we can only assume
that under your presidency Stanford has given
up its devotion to letting the winds of freedom
blow. Under these conditions no one who believes
in freedom or education should give support,
financial or otherwise, to your institution.

Copy of a telegram sent to President Sterling:
As formerly proud Stanford alumni, my wife
and I arc shocked and dismayed at Provost Ter
man's veto of Professor Mulford Sibley's perma
nent appointment. As a graduate student in po
litical science, I know that Sibley has one of the
finest reputations as a scholar and a teacher in
his profession. We earnestly request that you
and the Board of Trustees conduct a special in
vestigation into this malter. If it is true that
Sibley was not reappointed because of his politi
cal ideas and activities, then we can only assume
that under your presidency Stanford has given
up its devotion to letting the winds of freedom
blow. Under these conditions no one who believes
in freedom or education should give support,
financial or otherwise, to your institution.

Several years ago I had the opportunity to
study political theory under Professor Mulford
Sibley at the University of Minnesota. I found
his classes and his personal interest in students
an experience as stimulating and intellectually
challenging as has apparently been the experi
ence of many students this year at Stanford.
There is no question that Sibley holds convic
tions on public issues which are often at variance
with the "popular" or commonly-accepted view
point, and that he expresses his convictions vig
orously and at times vociferously.
It seems to me most unfortunate that a univer
sity of major rank such as Stanford has not
chosen to select for its faculty a man of precisely
this nature, especially in view of the strong rec
ommendations of his colleagues. The history of
the progress of the sciences and the humanities
is marked by the achievements of the "deviate"
and the "unpopular."
The value to the university student of the op
portunity to hear and to evaluate a well-expressed
viewpoint which is different from the typical one,
and which may be different from his own, seems
to me to be very great.

Deplore Sibley Refusal
Editor, The Daily:
Copy of a telegram sent to President Sterling:
As alumnus and former graduate instructor at
Stanford I deplore the provost's refusal to for
ward strong recommendations for Dr. Sibley's
permanent appointment and your evident refusal
to reverse the provost's decision, obviously be
cause of Sibley's convictions against continued
nuclear testing—a conviction shared by many
loyal and thoughtful citizens of the country. Such
stifling of ideas parallels the firing of instructors
in Stanford's early days because of their "radi
cal" belief in municipal utilities. You are making
a mockery of the motto "Let the Winds of Free
dom Plow" and of the principles of academic
freedom.

Editor, The Daily:
As one of the five students who went to argue
on behalf of Dr. Sibley with the president, I feel
that a report is due to those who are so properly

exercised about this controversy.
First, I want to make it clear that we were
told things in confidence, and I cannot, of course,
break that confidence. Nevertheless, I can report
this:
(1) The case for Dr. Sibley is a strong one.
That case was presented vigorously, at length
and in detail.
(2) It is clear that Dr. Sibley's political views
did not control the decision. Dr. Sterling cited
chapter and verse, and convinced us beyond any
doubt of this.
(3) Procedurally speaking, the case was not an
unusual one. Precedents were listed.
(4) The president is correct in not releasing
details as to why Dr. Sibley was not given a
tenure appointment. This is standard procedure
at all American universities, and any university
which did state reasons why a particular instruc
tor was not given an appointment would immedi
ately encounter difficulty in getting professors
to come on a look-and-see basis.
Having said this, I should want to say some
thing else: I went into the meeting with the
president convinced that Mulford Sibley was an
immensely gifted teacher and a highly qualified
researcher, and that his loss to Stanford would
be a monumental one. I walked out, after two
and one-half hours, not changed in this conviction
one iota.
The decision of the Administration was a care
ful one, animated by a desire to do what was best
for Stanford. It was not, I believe, a good de
cision. The loss of this compelling teacher is not
sad; it is tragic. The basic issue of the type of
teaching the students receive is not dead.

unusual one. Precedents were listed.
(4) The president is correct in not releasing
details as to why Dr. Sibley was not given a
tenure appointment. This is standard procedure
at all American universities, and any university
which did state reasons why a particular instruc
tor was not given an appointment would immedi
ately encounter difficulty in getting professors
to come on a look-and-see basis.
Having said this, I should want to say some
thing else: I went into the meeting with the
president convinced that Mulford Sibley was an
immensely gifted teacher and a highly qualified
researcher, and that his loss to Stanford would
be a monumental one. I walked out, after two
and one-half hours, not changed in this conviction
one iota.
The decision of the Administration was a care
ful one, animated by a desire to do what was best
for Stanford. It was not, I believe, a good de
cision. The loss of this compelling teacher is not
sad; it is tragic. The basic issue of the type of
teaching the students receive is not dead.

Should Not Support Stanford
Editor, The Daily:
Copy of a telegram sent to President Sterling:
As formerly proud Stanford alumni, my wife
and I arc shocked and dismayed at Provost Ter
man's veto of Professor Mulford Sibley's perma
nent appointment. As a graduate student in po
litical science, I know that Sibley has one of the
finest reputations as a scholar and a teacher in
his profession. We earnestly request that you
and the Board of Trustees conduct a special in
vestigation into this malter. If it is true that
Sibley was not reappointed because of his politi
cal ideas and activities, then we can only assume
that under your presidency Stanford has given
up its devotion to letting the winds of freedom
blow. Under these conditions no one who believes
in freedom or education should give support,
financial or otherwise, to your institution.

History Made by 4 Deviates'
Editor, The Daily:
Several years ago I had the opportunity to
study political theory under Professor Mulford
Sibley at the University of Minnesota. I found
his classes and his personal interest in students
an experience as stimulating and intellectually
challenging as has apparently been the experi
ence of many students this year at Stanford.
There is no question that Sibley holds convic
tions on public issues which are often at variance
with the "popular" or commonly-accepted view
point, and that he expresses his convictions vig
orously and at times vociferously.
It seems to me most unfortunate that a univer
sity of major rank such as Stanford has not
chosen to select for its faculty a man of precisely
this nature, especially in view of the strong rec
ommendations of his colleagues. The history of
the progress of the sciences and the humanities
is marked by the achievements of the "deviate"
and the "unpopular."
The value to the university student of the op
portunity to hear and to evaluate a well-expressed
viewpoint which is different from the typical one,
and which may be different from his own, seems
to me to be very great.

Deplore Sibley Refusal
Editor, The Daily:
Copy of a telegram sent to President Sterling:
As alumnus and former graduate instructor at
Stanford I deplore the provost's refusal to for
ward strong recommendations for Dr. Sibley's
permanent appointment and your evident refusal
to reverse the provost's decision, obviously be
cause of Sibley's convictions against continued
nuclear testing—a conviction shared by many
loyal and thoughtful citizens of the country. Such
stifling of ideas parallels the firing of instructors
in Stanford's early days because of their "radi
cal" belief in municipal utilities. You are making
a mockery of the motto "Let the Winds of Free
dom Plow" and of the principles of academic
freedom.

As one of the five students who went to argue
on behalf of Dr. Sibley with the president, I feel
that a report is due to those who are so properly

exercised about this controversy.
First, I want to make it clear that we were
told things in confidence, and I cannot, of course,
break that confidence. Nevertheless, I can report
this:
(1) The case for Dr. Sibley is a strong one.
That case was presented vigorously, at length
and in detail.
(2) It is clear that Dr. Sibley's political views
did not control the decision. Dr. Sterling cited
chapter and verse, and convinced us beyond any
doubt of this.
(3) Procedurally speaking, the case was not an
unusual one. Precedents were listed.
(4) The president is correct in not releasing
details as to why Dr. Sibley was not given a
