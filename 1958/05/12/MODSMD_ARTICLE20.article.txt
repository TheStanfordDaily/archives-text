# Strauss Operetta Presented to Libe
## 
### 
The original manuscript of Jo
hann Strauss' operetta, "A Night
in Venice," has been presented to
Stanford's Memorial Library of
Music by George T. Keating of
Los Altos.
The work, dated 1883, shows
scribbled stage directions, false
starts and incompleted bars of
melodies, with errors noted in
Strauss' red chalk.
The Stanford Library of Music
is rated the richest collection of
original scores outside the Li
brary of Congress and the New
York Public Library. Keating and
the late Dr. Nathan Van Patten
were its principal founders.
