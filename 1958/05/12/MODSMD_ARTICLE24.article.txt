## Cards Fifth at Fresno 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Jerry Winters put the shot 53-11 to exceed his all-time personal best by more than a foot as Stan
ford finished filth in the collegiate division of the West Coast Relays Saturday in Fresno.
Winters bettered his old mark of 52-9, and finished third in the collegiate division of the compelition.
He was sixth in Hie open standings. The remainder of the Stanford points came via a second in the
distance medley, third in the four-man two-mile, fourth in the 440 relay, Chuck Cobb's dead-heat for

second in the high hurdles, and
John Kelly's fourth in the broad
jump.
The heralded distance medley
turned into not much contest as
California, Stanford, Oklahoma
and Occidental finished yards
apart from each other, and in
that order.
Cal led all the way as Jack Yer
man ripped the opening 440 in
47 flat. Dick Lassen got off .slow
ly with a 49.7 for his leg.
Ctinliffe linns 1:51.3
Ernie Cunliffe wiced a good
1:51.3 half-mile for Iho Tribe,
but he lost ground to Jerry Sic
bert's 1:50.2 as the Bears wid
ened their margin.
Stanford lost even more ground
on the third section as Maynard
Orme outraeed Maury Graves,
3:02.2 to 3:08.7. By this time,
however, Graves had the Indians
comfortably in second place, a
good 25 yards ahead of the Soon
ers.
Norman Lloyd took over for
the anchor mile in just the posi
tion ho didn't want far behind
Don Bowden and far ahead of
Gail Hodgson. Lloyd quickly
killed off any hopes Hodgson had
wilh a 56.2 quarter, and contin
ued through his <S8() in 1:59.5.
Bowden was too far ahead for
Lloyd to catch, and so he coasted
home in 4:13.0, saving strength
for the Iwo-milc relay. Cal's
9:51.2 was nearly 10 seconds off
the American record. Stanford
was clocked in 10:02.7.
With only a 30-minute break
between the two long relays, USC
and Oxy were too fresh for the
Cards in Ihe two-mile. Stanford
splits of 1:54.9 for Lassen, 1:56.7
for Bob Monzingo, 1:54.5 for Cun
liffe and an excellent 1:50.7 for

! Lloyd gave the Indians third in
7:36.8. Occidental won in 7:29.9,
seven seconds over its own world
record.

Pease and Dean Smith. Anixter

110, and the others all clocked un
official 10.2's on running starts.
Cumulative time was 41.6.
The same team didn't fare as
well in the 880 relay, hitting only
1:28.6 for seventh place. Smith
ran the best leg, but it was still
slow at 21.6.
Smith ran a pair of unofficial
9.7's in the open 100. He was sec
ond in his heat to Dee Givens of
Oklahoma, and finished seventh
in the final to Ray Norton's 9.4.

1o run at all, after a siege of pneu
monia. He went through his heat
in 14.8, saving as mueh as pos
sible for the final.
Cobb Comes Fast
In the final, he was off slowly,
but" came fast at the end 1o dead
lock Oxy's Clarence Treat for sec
ond in 14.4. Ancel Robinson of
Fresno State won in 14.2.

the broad jump with its four en
trants finishing fourth, fifth,
sixth and eighth. Kelly moved up
to 23-10*4. after a slow start to get
his fourth. Kent Hansen, A 1 Pe
terson and freshman Brooks
Townsend ranged down to 23-2
