# Frosh Swimmers Upset Arden Hills
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman swimmers,
sparked by national record-holder
George Harrison, nosed out a top
notch Arden Hills Swim Club
squad from Sacramento Saturday
morning in the local pool 44-42.
Harrison bettered Ron Volmer,
PCC champ from Cal, in the 200-
yard butterfly and topped Tom
Burton, ex-Stanford PCC champ,
in the 440 freestyle as well as
swimming on the victorious med
ley relay team. Papoose Mike
Zeller grabbed firsts in the 100
and 220 freestyle.
This was felt to he a well
earned and surprising victory for
the frosh, since Arden Hills re
cently defeated the SC varsity
which beat the Stanford varsity
May 3.
