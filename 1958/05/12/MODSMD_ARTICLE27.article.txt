## 
### 
Stanford won the Ilarbach Cup
for the third straight year Satur
day in San Pedpo Harbor as three
Indian crews rolled up a perfect
20-point score over USC and UC
LA.

the feature race by four lengths
over the Trojans and by 14 over
UCLA. The victory over USC
evened the seasons' score at 11.
USC took a one - length victory
here last month.
The varsity race was tight for
three-quarters of a mile, until the
Indians exploded to grab a quick
one - length lead. It stayed that
way for another half-mile until
Stanford again exploded. This
time the Cards stepped up the
stroke and pulled ahead easily to
the final four-length margin.
Time for the wind-swept two
miles was 11:54.1.
The junior varsity race fol
lowed a similar pattern. At the
half-mile, Stanford pulled ahead
over the Trojans, and went on to
win by 3% lengths. Time was
12:06.2.
Stanford's frosh boat walloped
USC by sli> lengths, and was
clocked in just six-tenths slower
