group of students and faculty to discuss the relative merits of teach
ing vs. research.
The discussion will not be open to the public, Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler said yesterday. He emphasized, however, that

he had not spoken with the Presi
dent on this point, but he expect
ed that some of the points that
might be raised would be of a
confidential nature.
Among the faculty and staff
represented will be Dr. Merrill K.
Bennett, chairman of the Presi
dent's Advisory Board; Professor
Robert A. Walker, administrative
head of the General Studies Pro
gram and incoming executive
head of the Political Science De
partment replacing Dr. James T.
VVatkins IV, and Philip K. Rhine
lander, Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
To Meet Sterling
An incomplete list of the stu
dents who will be represented ac
cording to Winbigler will include
Craig Barnes, Dwight Clark, Don
Kummerfeld, Karen Erickson,
Grace Mohns, Paul Draper, Peter
Grothe, Bruce Bushing, Phyllis
Turner, Bonnie Pomeroy and
Daily Editor Stew Toy. Winbig
ler said he expects there will be
a few more students represented.
The students were selected as
an outcome of the conference
held Friday between Sterling and
a group of five students. The
final list of names was agreed
upon by both Dean Winbigler and
Miss Turner who met with Win
bigler following the conference
with Sterling.
Not Real Leaders
There have been many com
plaints received by The Daily that
the students selected do not rep
resent the real leaders of student
opposition to the Office of the
President's decision not to ap
point Professor Sibley as a fac
ulty member.
They feel that the students
themselves should be the ones to
decide who shall or shall not rep
resent them in a discussion of
this kind. In the meantime, there
was a general decision to sit tight
and see what develops.
