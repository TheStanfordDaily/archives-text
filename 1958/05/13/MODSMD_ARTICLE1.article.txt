## 
### Leo Krulitz 
"College people—the men and women that are best trained and
equipped to lead us in politics—must make an early start in the party
of their choice," Paul Butler said in a speech last night sponsored
by the Stanford Political Union.
He proceeded to outline the reasons why that choice should be

the Democratic Party.
Before the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee
continued, he added, "I want any
one that might disagree with any
thing I have to say to express
himself in any way." The re
sponse was scattered applause
and a little muffled grumbling.
"The chief function of a politi
cal party," Butler went on, "is to
shape and develop ideas into pub
lic policy."
Jeffersonian Ideas
He outlined the ideas "most
noteworthy" in the Democratic
Party as its foundation by the
philosopher statesman, Thomas
Jefferson, on a faith in the peo
ple; a belief in the dignity of hu
man beings; political equality;
and the widest possible holding of
public property as a safeguard to
democracy.
He suggested the Democrats
stand firm on internationalism
through collective security and re
ciprocal trade. Butler added that
the Democrats wanted, not peace
alone, but "peace with freedom."
"Liberalism best describes the
philosophy of the Democratic
Party," he wont on. "The liber
alism I refer to is one that signi
fies an attitude of mind that is
prone to change."
Recommends Brown
Recommending Pat Brown and
Clair Engle, Butler said, "Wo are
proud of these distinguished men
and of their service to the peo
ple."
lie charged the alternative par
ty was "adopting Democratic
ideas 20 years late and calling
thom Modern Republicanism."
Butler went on, saying, "The
Republican Party has not kept up
the pace in civil rights sot by Iho
Now Deal and the Fair Deal."
During the question and an
swer period, Butler commented,
"The right-to-work laws are un-
American, un-Christian and un
moral."
The Political Union, in a busi
ness meeting before Chairman
Butler's speech, elected Pat Pink
ham, president, and Nancy Sno
kel. vice-president, for the 1938-59
school year.

"College people—the men and women that are best trained and
equipped to lead us in politics—must make an early start in the party
of their choice," Paul Butler said in a speech last night sponsored
by the Stanford Political Union.
He proceeded to outline the reasons why that choice should be

the Democratic Party.
Before the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee
continued, he added, "I want any
one that might disagree with any
thing I have to say to express
himself in any way." The re
sponse was scattered applause

"The chief function of a politi
cal party," Butler went on, "is to
shape and develop ideas into pub
lic policy."

He outlined the ideas "most
noteworthy" in the Democratic
Party as its foundation by the
philosopher statesman, Thomas
Jefferson, on a faith in the peo
