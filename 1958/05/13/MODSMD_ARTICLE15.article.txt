WASHINGTON, April 26—The crisis of politi
cal leadership in the non-Communist world was
never more apparent than it is today. Washing
ton, London. Paris. Bonn, Rome. New Delhi and
Tokyo are all preoccupied with national political
or economic problems, and most of the major
Western capitals are slowly and painfully trying
to pass leadership from the men horn in the nine
teenth century to those born in the twentieth.
It is a long: time since Eisenhower in Washing
ton, Macmillan in London or Adenauer in Bonn
has come forward with any large Churchillian
concept of future policy, or even with any clear
definition of the scope and nature of the deeper
problems of the non-Communist world.
Coincidentally, the younger leaders of the West
have not yet established their authority, and
seem for the time being no more imaginative
than their elders. There is, however, one hopeful
sign.
Almost everywhere reflective men and women
in the universities and elsewhere in private life
are searching for new concepts and thinking in
larger terms of what can and must be done to
reassert the leadership of Hie West.
The Rockefeller brothers group in the United
States, the study groups around the Euratom and
Common Market projects in Europe, individuals
such as Dean Acheson in Washington. George
Kennan in Oxford and Jean Monnet in France
are all producing new ideas for the reshaping and
redirection of Western policy. N
Unfortunately, most of them are working sepa
rately and putting only a small part of their time
and energy into the problem. They are concerned
with other things or they are looking at what is
clearly an international and interlocking problem
from a purely national point of view.
Fortunately, the younger political leaders in
the United States are conscious of the possibili
ties of this reservoir of intelligent men and
women in private life. Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon and Senators John F. Kennedy of Massa
chusetts and J. William Fulbright of Arkansas
are cases in point.
Kennedy in particular has been working with
the political scientists and economists at Harvard,
Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. His proposals for a five-year aid

program for India and his labor policies, for
example, were carefully studied ahead of time
by some of the most lively ami well-informed
minds in these institutions.
Nixon, now embarked on a study of Teddy
Roosevelt, is still more interested in political
tactics than in new political concepts, but he, too,
is enlisting the aid of many men in the univer
sities and elsewhere in private life. This is also
true of Senator Lyndon Johnson, the majority
leader in the Senate, whose recent speeches clear
ly show the mark of more reflective minds.
Fulbright, as the ranking Democratic member
of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been
holding a series of hearings on foreign-policy
questions, most of them devoted to the testimony
of scholars who have time to think about the
larger strategy of future policy.
It is not very likely that any international
planning staff of private, or mixed private and
official, foreign-policy experts would have any
great impact on present leaders. Here in Wash
ington the planning staffs of the State Depart
ment and the National Security Council are hav
ing very little impact on the thinking of the Pres
ident or the Secretary of State.
Moreover, those at the top of the Government
here now are thinking more in terms of stopping
had things than of initiating new good things.
President Eisenhower told-us this week in his
news conference that "courage and boldness"
were "very fine things" when the country had an
effective plan of action, but he added that it was
necessary, first of all, to know the right thing
to do.
He was talking about the economy, but this
same attitude of mind applies here, too, to dis
armament policy, European policy, trade policy,
.Middle Eastern policy, Far Eastern policy and a
lot of other things.
It used to be assumed that boldness of mind
and coinage were the necessary prerequisites to
effective plans of action. These were the quali
ties that restored the economy of Europe under
the Marshall Plan, and organized the North At
lantic treaty. The men who devised these policies
were not always sure that they had an effective
plan, but they had the boldness and courage to
push ahead, anyway.
Nevertheless, it is not too early to plan for the
day when the new crop of leaders in the West
will have to assume responsibility.
There is a natural alliance between the rising
politicians and their contemporaries in econom
ics. sociology and political science in the private
institutions. The need clearly exists. The will to
cooperate is there on both sides. And the means
are available in the foundations to finance a
really serious full-time international study of the
now policies of the future.

by some of the most lively ami well-informed
minds in these institutions.
Nixon, now embarked on a study of Teddy
Roosevelt, is still more interested in political
tactics than in new political concepts, but he, too,
is enlisting the aid of many men in the univer
sities and elsewhere in private life. This is also
true of Senator Lyndon Johnson, the majority
leader in the Senate, whose recent speeches clear

Fulbright, as the ranking Democratic member
of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been

questions, most of them devoted to the testimony

It is not very likely that any international
planning staff of private, or mixed private and

great impact on present leaders. Here in Wash

here now are thinking more in terms of stopping

President Eisenhower told-us this week in his
news conference that "courage and boldness"
were "very fine things" when the country had an
effective plan of action, but he added that it was
necessary, first of all, to know the right thing
to do.
He was talking about the economy, but this
same attitude of mind applies here, too, to dis
armament policy, European policy, trade policy,
.Middle Eastern policy, Far Eastern policy and a
lot of other things.
It used to be assumed that boldness of mind
and coinage were the necessary prerequisites to
effective plans of action. These were the quali
ties that restored the economy of Europe under
the Marshall Plan, and organized the North At
lantic treaty. The men who devised these policies
were not always sure that they had an effective
plan, but they had the boldness and courage to
push ahead, anyway.
Nevertheless, it is not too early to plan for the
day when the new crop of leaders in the West
will have to assume responsibility.
There is a natural alliance between the rising
politicians and their contemporaries in econom
ics. sociology and political science in the private
institutions. The need clearly exists. The will to
cooperate is there on both sides. And the means
are available in the foundations to finance a
really serious full-time international study of the
now policies of the future.

WASHINGTON, April 26—The crisis of politi
cal leadership in the non-Communist world was
never more apparent than it is today. Washing
ton, London. Paris. Bonn, Rome. New Delhi and
Tokyo are all preoccupied with national political
or economic problems, and most of the major
Western capitals are slowly and painfully trying
to pass leadership from the men horn in the nine
teenth century to those born in the twentieth.
It is a long: time since Eisenhower in Washing
ton, Macmillan in London or Adenauer in Bonn
has come forward with any large Churchillian
concept of future policy, or even with any clear
definition of the scope and nature of the deeper
problems of the non-Communist world.
Coincidentally, the younger leaders of the West
have not yet established their authority, and
seem for the time being no more imaginative
than their elders. There is, however, one hopeful
sign.
Almost everywhere reflective men and women
in the universities and elsewhere in private life
are searching for new concepts and thinking in
larger terms of what can and must be done to
reassert the leadership of Hie West.
The Rockefeller brothers group in the United
States, the study groups around the Euratom and
Common Market projects in Europe, individuals
such as Dean Acheson in Washington. George
Kennan in Oxford and Jean Monnet in France
are all producing new ideas for the reshaping and
redirection of Western policy. N
Unfortunately, most of them are working sepa
rately and putting only a small part of their time
and energy into the problem. They are concerned
with other things or they are looking at what is
clearly an international and interlocking problem
from a purely national point of view.
Fortunately, the younger political leaders in
the United States are conscious of the possibili
ties of this reservoir of intelligent men and
women in private life. Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon and Senators John F. Kennedy of Massa
chusetts and J. William Fulbright of Arkansas
are cases in point.
Kennedy in particular has been working with
the political scientists and economists at Harvard,
Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. His proposals for a five-year aid

program for India and his labor policies, for
example, were carefully studied ahead of time

WASHINGTON, April 26—The crisis of politi
cal leadership in the non-Communist world was
never more apparent than it is today. Washing
ton, London. Paris. Bonn, Rome. New Delhi and
Tokyo are all preoccupied with national political
or economic problems, and most of the major
Western capitals are slowly and painfully trying
to pass leadership from the men horn in the nine
teenth century to those born in the twentieth.
It is a long: time since Eisenhower in Washing
ton, Macmillan in London or Adenauer in Bonn
has come forward with any large Churchillian
concept of future policy, or even with any clear
definition of the scope and nature of the deeper
problems of the non-Communist world.
Coincidentally, the younger leaders of the West
have not yet established their authority, and
seem for the time being no more imaginative
than their elders. There is, however, one hopeful
sign.
Almost everywhere reflective men and women
in the universities and elsewhere in private life
are searching for new concepts and thinking in
larger terms of what can and must be done to
reassert the leadership of Hie West.
The Rockefeller brothers group in the United
States, the study groups around the Euratom and
Common Market projects in Europe, individuals
such as Dean Acheson in Washington. George
Kennan in Oxford and Jean Monnet in France
are all producing new ideas for the reshaping and
redirection of Western policy. N
Unfortunately, most of them are working sepa
rately and putting only a small part of their time
and energy into the problem. They are concerned
with other things or they are looking at what is
clearly an international and interlocking problem
from a purely national point of view.
Fortunately, the younger political leaders in
the United States are conscious of the possibili
ties of this reservoir of intelligent men and
women in private life. Vice-President Richard M.
Nixon and Senators John F. Kennedy of Massa
chusetts and J. William Fulbright of Arkansas
are cases in point.
Kennedy in particular has been working with
the political scientists and economists at Harvard,
Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. His proposals for a five-year aid

program for India and his labor policies, for
example, were carefully studied ahead of time
by some of the most lively ami well-informed
minds in these institutions.
Nixon, now embarked on a study of Teddy
Roosevelt, is still more interested in political
tactics than in new political concepts, but he, too,
is enlisting the aid of many men in the univer
sities and elsewhere in private life. This is also
true of Senator Lyndon Johnson, the majority
leader in the Senate, whose recent speeches clear
ly show the mark of more reflective minds.
Fulbright, as the ranking Democratic member
of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been
holding a series of hearings on foreign-policy
questions, most of them devoted to the testimony
of scholars who have time to think about the
larger strategy of future policy.
It is not very likely that any international
planning staff of private, or mixed private and
official, foreign-policy experts would have any
great impact on present leaders. Here in Wash
ington the planning staffs of the State Depart
ment and the National Security Council are hav
ing very little impact on the thinking of the Pres
ident or the Secretary of State.
Moreover, those at the top of the Government
here now are thinking more in terms of stopping
had things than of initiating new good things.
President Eisenhower told-us this week in his
news conference that "courage and boldness"
were "very fine things" when the country had an
effective plan of action, but he added that it was
necessary, first of all, to know the right thing
to do.
He was talking about the economy, but this
same attitude of mind applies here, too, to dis
armament policy, European policy, trade policy,
.Middle Eastern policy, Far Eastern policy and a
lot of other things.
It used to be assumed that boldness of mind
and coinage were the necessary prerequisites to
effective plans of action. These were the quali
ties that restored the economy of Europe under
the Marshall Plan, and organized the North At
lantic treaty. The men who devised these policies
were not always sure that they had an effective
plan, but they had the boldness and courage to
push ahead, anyway.
Nevertheless, it is not too early to plan for the
day when the new crop of leaders in the West
will have to assume responsibility.
There is a natural alliance between the rising
politicians and their contemporaries in econom
ics. sociology and political science in the private
institutions. The need clearly exists. The will to
cooperate is there on both sides. And the means
are available in the foundations to finance a
really serious full-time international study of the
now policies of the future.
