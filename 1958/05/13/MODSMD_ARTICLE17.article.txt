# Gardening, Oriental Rugs Occupy Retiring Professor

"When I retire in June I will
have taught here for half the life
of Stanford," said Carl F. Brand,
professor of history.
A native Hoosier, Brand took
his undergraduate work at the
University of Indiana and hits
graduate work at Harvard. After
receiving his Ph.D. in history
from Harvard in 1923, he traveled
in Europe as a traveling fellow
and did a little work at the Lon
don School of Economics.
Specialist on British politics
and especially the British Labor
party, Brand is the noted author
of more than a dozen articles
about British political parties and
has written a book entitled "Brit
ish Labour's Rise to Power."
Tutorial Method
While at Harvard he became
convinced of the excellent results
achieved by the tutorial method
of instruction.
"This is an adaptation of the
Oxford tutorial system," he said.
"The method enthused me from
my first year, and I have endeav
ored to continue to instruct small
groups in this manner."
The tutorial system allows the
student to do extensive reading
in a field that interests him, while
he confers at intervals with the
professor assigned as his tutor.
"This independent study work
will be the core of the new His
tory Honors Prog r a m," said
Brand, who has been instrumen
tal in the adoption of the program
into the History Department cur
riculum.
Appointment
Since tire time of his appoint
ment to Stanford, Dr. Brand has
been working toward this goal, to
see tire tutorial method adopted
tor superior students throughout
the University and in the History
De pa i t men t specif ically.
Not intending to be inactive
during his retirement, Professor
Brand will turn to his avocations.
"Gardening for many years has
kept me physically fit, and I look
forward to being able to care for
our property here on the cam
pus," he said.
Music plays a large part in Dr.
Brand's life, He is "active on" the
clarinet and for three years was
director of the university band at
Indiana.
"I look forward to traveling
with my wife in Europe," said
Brand, who is considering his
fifth trip abroad.
By far his most intriguing hob
by is Dr. Brand's love for old ori
ental rugs. He became interested
in rugs when he was still a bache
lor. and got many when he was in
Istanbul in 1928.
"I am only interested in an
tique, authentic pieces and have

my classes up to the house every
quarter to look at them," he said.
"It's a lot of fun. I give a short
talk about the rugs, and then ev
erybody gets on his knees arrd
turns rugs over, counting knots.
Even though they don't know
each other, it gives the students
something in common. Everyone
is very friendly at the end of the
evening.
"I will miss the daily contact
with young people. To have
watched developing young minds
for so many years arrd then have
it cut short—this is one thing I
will give up with a great sense of
loss."
When asked to evaluate Stan
ford students, Dr. Brand replied
that the quality of Stanford stu
dents has always been high—the
lower third just isn't here. He
criticizes the students for not
making the most of their oppor
tunities while here.
Brand feels that the difficult
Stanford degree is as good as a
degree from any school in the
country, but that too many Stan
f o i'd degrees are given which
have not been achieved by the
amount of intellectual growth
that they should symbolize.
Too Many Distractions
"Students have too many dis
tractions," he said. "The week
end seems to get longer and long
er. However, much excellent work
is being done here, and our seri
ous students are as good as stu
dents at any university in the
country."
When asked about his sphere of
interest — British politics — Dr.
Brand remarked that much can
be learned from this study. The
problems of the modern world
stem from the social and econom

ic dislocations created by industri
alization. Industrialization began
in Britain, and she has faced
those problems longer than any
other nation.
