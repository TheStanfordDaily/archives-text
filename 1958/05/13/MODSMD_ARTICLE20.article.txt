"The Health Service is happy to
see so many cases of German
measles this year," Dr. Houek
said yesterday.
In explaining his unexpected at
titude. Dr. Houek pointed out that
although the German measles is
a very "benign" disease," it can
affect a baby's heart and eyes if
caught by the mother during the
first three months of pregnancy.
"Since no one is ever really
sick witli the disease and one at
tack gives extensive immunity,"
said Dr. Houek, "we are glad to
see the threat to future mothers
reduced by every case."
Dr. Houek said students could
also prevent the threat of Asian
flu next fall by getting one shot
before the end of the quarter.
The flu shots are given every
afternoon at the Health Service
from 1 to 5.
