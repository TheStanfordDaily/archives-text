# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
More Reeoril-Pokiiig
Last week, a little poking into the year-old records showed that
this year's Stanford track team is far superior to last year's club.
Athletic publicity director Don Liebendorfer picked up the ball from
that point, concocted a series of dope sheets, and came to the conclu
sion that the current Indian squad is the second-best in Stanford
history.
Liebondorfer's research shows that only the 1910 team would
figure to come out ahead if the '58 club could meet each of the former
Stanford teams in dual competition.
The '40 team wouldn't have any easy time gaining their win, and
would have to win the relay to get it. If this mile relay could ever
l>e held, it'd bo a great race.
That team of Charles Shaw, Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson and
Clyde Jeffrey ran the distance in 3:10.5, establishing what was at
that time a world's record. The present club of Dick Lassen, Ernie
C'uiiliffe, Norman Lloyd and Don C'hesarek has clocked 3:11.4 in
their only all-out effort.
Liebendorfer tried to distribute the breaks fairly evenly in all of
Ihese hypothetical meets, but reports that he couldn't dig up more
than (51 or (52 points for any of the other of Stanford's better teams.
Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain maintain a large chart in the
track room which lists the all-time top ton performers in Stanford
history in each of the 15 events. This, also, yields lots of evidence
to show that the current Indians are a lot better team than their dual
meet scores show.
Counting ties, thoi-o are 159 entries on this board—they include
men from 1912 through 1958. Of this total, 19 spots are held by the
present team. This is tops for any team, with the 12 positions held
by the '10 club a distant second.
Two-Milers I)ominale
The two-mile is most dominated by the currents—five of them
rank among Stanford's ion best-ever eight lappors. Maury Graves is
first, with his school record 9:04.9; Doug Martin, Lloyd, Bob Mon
zingo and Hob Van Lueheue are fifth, sixth, seventh and tenth.
Lloyd and Cunliffe took over the first and second spots in 880
standings with their 1:49.2 and 1:50.2 respectively, but those marks
should get even lower before long. Lloyd is also first in the mile
with his 4:05.3.
The rest of the \sBors on the track lists are Dean Smith, tie for
second in the 100 at 9.6; Ben Anixter, tie for fifth in the 100 at 9.7;
Graves, fifth in the mile at 4:13.9; Monzingo, seventh in the mlie at.
4:17.5; Chuck Cobb, second in the highs at 13.9; and the relay team,
second with its 3:11.4.
Five men have made the field events listings: Jerry Winters, sev
enth in the shot at 53-11; Chris Plain, tenth iti the shot at 52-8; Kent
Hansen, tenth in the broad jump at 24-1 1 L»; .Mike FrancliHti, five-way
tie for third in the polo vault at 14-0; and John Stabler, tie for tenth
in the vault at 13-8.
A few more could make it before the season is over. Best pros
pects are Lassen in the 880, Norm Pease in the 100, Smith in the 220,
Jim Backstrand in the javelin and John Kelly and Brooks Townsend
in the broad jump.
M A
TRACK ODDITY—Tim Backstrand uncorked what appeared to
be the best throw of his life at the West ( oast Relays Saturday. Ilis
body was really behind the throw, and he had a powerful snap in
his motion. Just one difficulty—half-way through its flight, the
javelin snapped in half. Both head and tail wont sailing on ahead,
but to no avail as far as Backstrand was concerned. The spear was
a Bud Held model, and Held was competing at the time. Apparently
Jim didn't bother to complain to Bud, however.
WEIRDVILLE—Two breathless young things came by the shack
late last week to report the results of the World's Outdoor Asphalt
Court Back of the Sigma Chi House Volleyball Tournament. It seems
that Faisan smothered Storey House in two of three games. Starring
in the triumph were such can't-find-them-in-the-Bawlout individuals
as Bird, Chamberpot, Lizard, Spike, Charlie Brown, Wiggles and
Blue. Just one detail—these two Abbys of the sports world forgot
to report the scores.

Jim Backstrand in the javelin and John Kelly and Brooks Townsend

M A
TRACK ODDITY—Tim Backstrand uncorked what appeared to
be the best throw of his life at the West ( oast Relays Saturday. Ilis
body was really behind the throw, and he had a powerful snap in
his motion. Just one difficulty—half-way through its flight, the
javelin snapped in half. Both head and tail wont sailing on ahead,
but to no avail as far as Backstrand was concerned. The spear was
a Bud Held model, and Held was competing at the time. Apparently
Jim didn't bother to complain to Bud, however.
WEIRDVILLE—Two breathless young things came by the shack
late last week to report the results of the World's Outdoor Asphalt
Court Back of the Sigma Chi House Volleyball Tournament. It seems
that Faisan smothered Storey House in two of three games. Starring
in the triumph were such can't-find-them-in-the-Bawlout individuals
as Bird, Chamberpot, Lizard, Spike, Charlie Brown, Wiggles and
Blue. Just one detail—these two Abbys of the sports world forgot
to report the scores.

More Reeoril-Pokiiig
Last week, a little poking into the year-old records showed that
this year's Stanford track team is far superior to last year's club.
Athletic publicity director Don Liebendorfer picked up the ball from
that point, concocted a series of dope sheets, and came to the conclu
sion that the current Indian squad is the second-best in Stanford
history.
Liebondorfer's research shows that only the 1910 team would
figure to come out ahead if the '58 club could meet each of the former
Stanford teams in dual competition.
The '40 team wouldn't have any easy time gaining their win, and
would have to win the relay to get it. If this mile relay could ever
l>e held, it'd bo a great race.
That team of Charles Shaw, Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson and
Clyde Jeffrey ran the distance in 3:10.5, establishing what was at
that time a world's record. The present club of Dick Lassen, Ernie
C'uiiliffe, Norman Lloyd and Don C'hesarek has clocked 3:11.4 in
their only all-out effort.
Liebendorfer tried to distribute the breaks fairly evenly in all of
Ihese hypothetical meets, but reports that he couldn't dig up more
than (51 or (52 points for any of the other of Stanford's better teams.
Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain maintain a large chart in the
track room which lists the all-time top ton performers in Stanford
history in each of the 15 events. This, also, yields lots of evidence
to show that the current Indians are a lot better team than their dual
meet scores show.
Counting ties, thoi-o are 159 entries on this board—they include
men from 1912 through 1958. Of this total, 19 spots are held by the
present team. This is tops for any team, with the 12 positions held
by the '10 club a distant second.
Two-Milers I)ominale
The two-mile is most dominated by the currents—five of them
rank among Stanford's ion best-ever eight lappors. Maury Graves is
first, with his school record 9:04.9; Doug Martin, Lloyd, Bob Mon
zingo and Hob Van Lueheue are fifth, sixth, seventh and tenth.
Lloyd and Cunliffe took over the first and second spots in 880
standings with their 1:49.2 and 1:50.2 respectively, but those marks
should get even lower before long. Lloyd is also first in the mile
with his 4:05.3.
The rest of the \sBors on the track lists are Dean Smith, tie for
second in the 100 at 9.6; Ben Anixter, tie for fifth in the 100 at 9.7;
Graves, fifth in the mile at 4:13.9; Monzingo, seventh in the mlie at.
4:17.5; Chuck Cobb, second in the highs at 13.9; and the relay team,
second with its 3:11.4.
Five men have made the field events listings: Jerry Winters, sev
enth in the shot at 53-11; Chris Plain, tenth iti the shot at 52-8; Kent
Hansen, tenth in the broad jump at 24-1 1 L»; .Mike FrancliHti, five-way
tie for third in the polo vault at 14-0; and John Stabler, tie for tenth
in the vault at 13-8.

Lloyd and Cunliffe took over the first and second spots in 880
standings with their 1:49.2 and 1:50.2 respectively, but those marks
should get even lower before long. Lloyd is also first in the mile
with his 4:05.3.
The rest of the \sBors on the track lists are Dean Smith, tie for
second in the 100 at 9.6; Ben Anixter, tie for fifth in the 100 at 9.7;
Graves, fifth in the mile at 4:13.9; Monzingo, seventh in the mlie at.
4:17.5; Chuck Cobb, second in the highs at 13.9; and the relay team,
second with its 3:11.4.
Five men have made the field events listings: Jerry Winters, sev
enth in the shot at 53-11; Chris Plain, tenth iti the shot at 52-8; Kent
Hansen, tenth in the broad jump at 24-1 1 L»; .Mike FrancliHti, five-way
tie for third in the polo vault at 14-0; and John Stabler, tie for tenth
in the vault at 13-8.
A few more could make it before the season is over. Best pros
pects are Lassen in the 880, Norm Pease in the 100, Smith in the 220,
Jim Backstrand in the javelin and John Kelly and Brooks Townsend
in the broad jump.
M A
TRACK ODDITY—Tim Backstrand uncorked what appeared to
be the best throw of his life at the West ( oast Relays Saturday. Ilis
body was really behind the throw, and he had a powerful snap in
his motion. Just one difficulty—half-way through its flight, the
javelin snapped in half. Both head and tail wont sailing on ahead,
but to no avail as far as Backstrand was concerned. The spear was
a Bud Held model, and Held was competing at the time. Apparently
Jim didn't bother to complain to Bud, however.
WEIRDVILLE—Two breathless young things came by the shack
late last week to report the results of the World's Outdoor Asphalt
Court Back of the Sigma Chi House Volleyball Tournament. It seems
that Faisan smothered Storey House in two of three games. Starring
in the triumph were such can't-find-them-in-the-Bawlout individuals
as Bird, Chamberpot, Lizard, Spike, Charlie Brown, Wiggles and
Blue. Just one detail—these two Abbys of the sports world forgot
to report the scores.

More Reeoril-Pokiiig
Last week, a little poking into the year-old records showed that
this year's Stanford track team is far superior to last year's club.
Athletic publicity director Don Liebendorfer picked up the ball from
that point, concocted a series of dope sheets, and came to the conclu
sion that the current Indian squad is the second-best in Stanford
history.
Liebondorfer's research shows that only the 1910 team would
figure to come out ahead if the '58 club could meet each of the former
Stanford teams in dual competition.
The '40 team wouldn't have any easy time gaining their win, and
would have to win the relay to get it. If this mile relay could ever
l>e held, it'd bo a great race.
That team of Charles Shaw, Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson and
Clyde Jeffrey ran the distance in 3:10.5, establishing what was at
that time a world's record. The present club of Dick Lassen, Ernie
C'uiiliffe, Norman Lloyd and Don C'hesarek has clocked 3:11.4 in
their only all-out effort.
Liebendorfer tried to distribute the breaks fairly evenly in all of
Ihese hypothetical meets, but reports that he couldn't dig up more
than (51 or (52 points for any of the other of Stanford's better teams.
Payton Jordan and Floyd Strain maintain a large chart in the
track room which lists the all-time top ton performers in Stanford
history in each of the 15 events. This, also, yields lots of evidence
to show that the current Indians are a lot better team than their dual
meet scores show.
Counting ties, thoi-o are 159 entries on this board—they include
men from 1912 through 1958. Of this total, 19 spots are held by the
present team. This is tops for any team, with the 12 positions held
by the '10 club a distant second.
Two-Milers I)ominale
The two-mile is most dominated by the currents—five of them
rank among Stanford's ion best-ever eight lappors. Maury Graves is
first, with his school record 9:04.9; Doug Martin, Lloyd, Bob Mon
zingo and Hob Van Lueheue are fifth, sixth, seventh and tenth.
