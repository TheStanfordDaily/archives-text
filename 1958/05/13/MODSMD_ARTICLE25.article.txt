# SEEK RETURN TO .667
## Stanford Nine Faces USF 
### 
Dutch Fehring's Stanford base-
I bailors will try to climb back to
! the .6(57 level today at 2 p.m.
I when they stage a repeat game
| with USF at Seals Stadium.
The Indians slipped below the
magic ratio of two wins for every
loss for ihe first lime ibis year
when they were bombed by USC
in two games over the weekend.
If Stanford can got by USF, its
season mark will improve to 20
wins and 10 losses.
Cards Won Last Time
If an early-season game against
the Dons were tho only criterion,
it would appear that the Indians
should win easily. In the season's
other meeting, Stanford came off
on the long end of an 18-5 contest,
collecting 17 hits including home
runs by Ben Robinson and Joel
Newkirk.
USF, however, has improved
plenty since that game. The Dons
hold victories over Santa Clara,
San Jose and COP, and have

topped the Presidio twice. The
Presidio, in turn, has beaten Cali
fornia, a team that has whipped

Stanford two out of three.
George Avery will go to the
mound for Stanford, hoping to
have more control than ho had in
the Friday game against the Tro
jans. He walked the first five bat
ters before being derricked.
Fohring will have Dick Wil
liams ready for relief in case
Avery is touched up. Williams
won't be in the bull pen, thoughâ€”
he'll be in center field.
Kodda Out
Fohring wasn't satisfied with
Harry Rodda's hitting, so he in
serted Williams during the Satur
day Trojan lame. The left-hand
er responded with two excellent
catches, and his bat produced a
hit in two trips.
The line-up will read: Rich Do-
Fabio, rf; Joel Newkirk, lb; A!
Shaw, 2b; Ralph Holding, c; Wil
liams, cf; Ben .Robinson, If; Jim
Burk, 3b; Bob Dwight, ss; and
Avery.
