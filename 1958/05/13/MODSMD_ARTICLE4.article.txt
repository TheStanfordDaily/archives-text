# Appointment Policy Told
## Good Teacher Combines Scholarship and Ability 
### Wally Simpson 
(Editor's Note: This is tlu> first part of a series of two articles
covering a panel discussion held yesterday afternoon between stu
dents and faculty members on the question of Research versus
Teaching as criteria to faculty appointment using the non-appoint
ment of Professor Mill ford (J. Sibley as a specific example.)
There must be a good balance of teaching and research in a depart
ment if not in the same man, then in different men, Professor Rob
ert A. Walker said yesterday in a student-faculty discussion held in
the Board of Trustees Room.
"One of the important considerations here is that this is a univer-

sily, not a college," ho said. "Fac
ulty teaches graduates as well as
undergraduates. In the Political
Science Department we do have
men who have been advanced be
cause of their contribution to
teaching primarily."
Walker went on to say that the
value of a Stanford degree is to
a considerable extent that it
comes from a university which
has on its staff recognized schol
ars.
Graduate student A 1 Br.ouse
then asked Provost Frederick E.
Terman, "What would be your
definition of a scholar in the field
of political science?"
President Wallace Sterling an
swered instead, "I don't think
that is what the provost is con
cerned about." However, Profes
sor of English John W. Dodds
said, "The feeling is that the best
teacher is also a good scholar.
There are undoubtedly some
scholars who do not publish a
line.
Why Publish?
"Why publish? There is a
place in the life of everyone in
an academic career where he
finds he gets dissatisfied with
having his ideas bounced back by
students. One way to find out if
they are any good is to submit
them to a jury of his peers."
Terman said that usually the
department focuses attention on
the most important publications
of a candidate. If there is any
question, book reviews are
checked.
Graduate student Don Kummer
feld commented that each par
ticular area of a department is a
particular situation because the
importance of the area varies
with time.
"Often a great many people or
just a few publish in that particu
lar area. The only people quali
fied to judge are people in the
same field themselves. To what
extent are people doing the same
sort of research asked to make
comments?"
Various Levels
Sterling answered by saying
this goes on at various levels
with the departments and the
deans. In Sibley's case people
outside the field had the responsi
bility of making the decision."
When the discussion opened
Dr. Merrill K. Bennett, chairman
of the President's Board of Ad
visers, gave the group an idea of
how thoroughly the Advisory
Board evaluates the candidates
for appointment.
Bennett gave a complete run
down of the duties of the Board
and explained the procedures
used. However, when later in the
discussion Bennett was asked if
Sibley's publications were investi
gated by the Board, Sterling an
swered for- him by saying, "That
was not submitted to the Advi
sory Board."
