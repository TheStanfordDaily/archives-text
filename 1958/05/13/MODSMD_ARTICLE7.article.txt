# CUBBERLEY OFFICE
## Psychopath 'Practices' On Campus 
### 
A mental patient was posing as
a psychiatrist on the Stanford
campus, a psychology department
spokesman confirmed yesterday.
The incident came to light when a
San Francisco newspaper column
ist mentioned the event.
The patient, a parolee from
Stockton State Hospital, "set up
shop" in various vacant offices in
Cubberley, the English depart
ment building and other places.
He then conducted psychiatric
experiments on "laboratory
goats" from the Psychology 1
class.
Suspicious Student
One graduate student became
suspicious of the "psychiatrist"
and reported him to officials, who
discovered that the offices being
used had not been authorized for
that purpose.
Every time investigators would
try to check up on the inmate he
would move to another office or
"become lost in the crowd."
A person of the same descrip
tion also appeared at the Health
Service and began examining stu
dents for athlete's foot. Changing
his role again, the "psychiatrist"
inspected the kitchens of several
fraternities.
Elaborate Stories
Finally the inmate was per
suaded to come to the police de
partment to talk about which of
fice he should occupy. After giv
ing elaborate stories about his
fine training and background, he
gave some contradictory state
menls and then confessed.
He was returned to his parole
adviser.
One student who had helped
the "expert" in his experiments
commented that "he really knew
a lot and gave me much help wilh
my political science assignments."
