## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)— President
Eisenhower, aroused by mob ac
tion against Vice-President Nixon
in Venezuela, rushed paratroop
ers and Marines to the Caribbean
last night.
In a surprising show of force,
Ihe Defense Department an
nounced that two companies of
airborne troops and two of Ma
rines were being flown to U.S.
bases in the Caribbean area,
which Venezuela adjoins.
The department called this only
a precautionary measure, under

taken so as to be in a position "to
co-operate with the Venezuelan
government if assistance is re
quested."
In the memory of old-time ob
servers here, it was the first in
stance where a good will mission
by an American leader resulted
in calling out Marines and troops.
The dispatch of troops is con
sidered certain to bring cries of
"Yankee imperialism" from Latin
American critics of this country's
policies.
Early last night, Presidential
Press Secretary James C. Hag
erty said reports from Venezuela
indicated government security
forces there were now adequate
ly protecting Nixon and his
party. Eisenhower had urgently
demanded—and received—assur
ances that Venezuela would adopt
"every possible means" to pro
tect Nixon.
The orders for the troop move
ment emanated from President
Eisenhower, it was disclosed at
the Pentagon.
In answer to a question, a De
fen s e Department spokesman
said:
"The orders were issued by the
chief of staff of the Army and the

chief of naval operations follow
ing consultation of the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
the Secretary of Defense with the
President."
There had been much specula
tion that Eisenhower might call
Nixon home forthwith in view of
the violent demonstrations
against him, hut there was no
sign of such action last night.
In any case, the Vice-President
is scheduled to comc home tomor
row to a White House stag din
ner, scheduled long ago.

The dispatch of troops is con
sidered certain to bring cries of
"Yankee imperialism" from Latin
American critics of this country's
policies.
Early last night, Presidential
Press Secretary James C. Hag
erty said reports from Venezuela
indicated government security
forces there were now adequate
ly protecting Nixon and his
party. Eisenhower had urgently
demanded—and received—assur
ances that Venezuela would adopt
"every possible means" to pro
tect Nixon.
The orders for the troop move
ment emanated from President
Eisenhower, it was disclosed at
the Pentagon.
In answer to a question, a De
fen s e Department spokesman
said:
"The orders were issued by the
chief of staff of the Army and the

chief of naval operations follow
ing consultation of the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
the Secretary of Defense with the
President."
There had been much specula
tion that Eisenhower might call
Nixon home forthwith in view of
the violent demonstrations
against him, hut there was no
sign of such action last night.
In any case, the Vice-President
is scheduled to comc home tomor
row to a White House stag din
ner, scheduled long ago.
