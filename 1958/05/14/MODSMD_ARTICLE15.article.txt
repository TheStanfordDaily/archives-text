Four students spoke on various
aspects of the right-wing ap
proach to national policy yester
day at a meeting sponsored by
the Independent Caucus of the
Political Union.
Pat Milligan opened the meet
ing with a talk on California's
proposed right-to-work laws. The
issue, he declared, is whether or
not the right-to-work laws arc
justified in order to relieve "co
ercion of workers" by corrupt
and discriminatory unions.
"The demonstrable ability of
the unions to coexist with these
laws justifies their adoption for
the sake of workers' freedom."
Kilburn MacMurraugh followed
with a discussion of American
motives in foreign policy. Amer
ica's best method of defeating
Russia, he claimed, lies in active
ly supporting revolutionary ac
tivities behind the Iron Curtain,
even to the extent of risking war.
Conrad Barrett said the racial
segregation question is "only a
whistle blown to stampede the
mob." lie added that the real
problem which is endangering
our way of life is the assumption
of too much power by the federal
government.
The meeting was concluded
with a speech by the group's
president, Brian Wickland. who
attacked the principle of "moral
meddling" in legislation.
