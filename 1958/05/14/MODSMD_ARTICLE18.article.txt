Dean of the Week: University of Michigan's
Dean of Men Walter B. Rea thinks a taproom
serving beer in the U's student union might not
be a bad idea. The Michigan Daily quotes Dean
Rea as saying, "If the students are to drink and
learn to drink like ladies and gentlemen there
might be a better way than having to go off
campus to drink."
Some student comments were those: "We came
here to study, not to drink."
"Excellent! There's quite a bit of drinking any
how and it seems ridiculous not to have it at the
union."
"A realistic step toward a more sensible ap
proach to the drinking problem."
Agreed?

Editors of the Pioneer, Tusculum College, Ten
nessee, have asked America to consider the pol
icy on nuclear weapons:
"We are faced, as Americans, with a danger
unlike any danger that has ever existed. In our
possession and in the possession of the Russians
are more than enough nuclear explosives to put
an end to the life of man on earth. . . .
"America should say to the world concerning
nuclear testing that because of the grave unan
swered questions with respect to nuclear test ex
plosions—especially concerning the contamina
tion of air, food and water and the injury to man

himself—we are calling upon all nations to sus
pend such explosions at once.
"Some may say that such an editorial as we
have presented is beyond the concept of the aver
age American college student. To this we say—
NO. We are growing up in a world twisted by
the hate of many and il is for our generation
to solve the world problems if this planet is to
continue to exist. . .
A voice from the East Coast, a voice from the
West. . . .
These terrifying figures come from the Ohio
State University Lantern:
"There are more than 19 million unmarried
women in this country and every last one of them
is out to get a man.
"Last year women spent $59,000,000 for per
fume. How much more they spent for lipstick,
rouge, eyebrow pencil and false eyelashes is not
known.
"On the basis of these facts a number of eli
gible men throughout the country have organized
into a Bachelors' Protective Association to insure
themselves against marriage.
"The BPA is currently circulating its literature
on our campus. For a small fee the BPA insures
an unmarried man against marriage for a full
year."
The comment is: Never underestimate the
power of a woman, BPA.
