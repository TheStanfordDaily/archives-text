Academic Freedom Dead
Editor. The Daily:
If "divine right" of the Administration to rule
continues, academic freedom is dead.
It is rumored that certain graduate and gradu
ating students are refusing to contribute funds to
the University because of the Sibley episode.
Whether justified or not, true or not. their mo
tives and intentions are clear . . . and laudable.
Michael Haas
Political Activities Color Case
Editor, The Daily:
We are told by the Administration that if Mr.
Sibley's political views were a factor, they would
have been considered when he was invited here
as a visiting professor. The Department of Po
litical Science, not the Administration, invited
Mr. Sibley to Stanford.
We ait? told that the University's record in de
fending the wide diversity of political opinions
among Stanford's present faculty also proves
(hat Mr. Sibley's views were not a factor. Per
haps this proves that the teachers are free to hold
divergent views but not to work too actively in
public support of these views.
Two men have been particularly noticeable this

year, in their appearances on campus and off, in
their attempt to arouse the interest of students
in problems of international importance.
Both of these men are visiting professors; one
is not under consideration for a position, the
other is Mr. Sibley. The Administration defends
the views of its faculty, but, since it cannot over
look any activity in making its decision on future
members, Mr. Sibley's political views and espe
cially his political activities color the whole in
vestigation of his qualifications.
Paul Draper
Ashamed of University
Editor, The Daily:
If what I suspect is true—that Mr. Sibley is
being sacked merely because he is against H
bomb tests —then I am ashamed of the Univer
sity.
I thought Stanford was the stronghold of free
dom of speech and all that jazz, but it looks as
though the Administration is willing to sacrifice
principles with nary a qualm if it's a question of
keeping Our Stanford free from the dreadful
taint of radicalism. We mustn't do anything to
damage Stanford's oh-sopure reputation and stop
all that lettuce from rolling in from the Alums.
