# TONIGHT AT THE SYMPHONY
## Beethoven's Third Ends San Francisco Concerts 
### 
Symphony-goers will hear San
Francisco wind up its excellent
season tonight. The all-orches
tral program is highlighted by
Beethoven's mightiest work,
Symphony No. 3 in E Flat Major
â€”better known as the "Eroica."
Although over a century and a
half old the "Eroica" is among the
noblest and best-loved orchestral
masterpieces. Beethoven origi
nally dedicated it to Napoleon
Bonaparte whom he believed the
champion of human freedom.
He erased Napoleon's name
from the manuscript when Bona
parte proclaimed himself Emper
or, renamed it "Eroica," and re
dedicated his symphony to "the
memory of a great man."
It is fitting that the Sym
phony's season should end with a
stirring and majestic work like
the "Eroica." The symphony cre
ated mixed reactions when it was
first performed in Vienna during
April, 1805.
A journalist of the time divider
"Eroica's" hearers into three
classes: Beethoven's particular
friends who kept a stiff upper
lip and predicted that after a
thousand years, the symphony
would still not lose its effect.
Critics declared that it was an
"untamed striving for singular
ity" and contained strange modu
lations and violent transitions.
Middle - of - the - roaders admitted
that "Eroica" contained "many
beauties," but deplored its "inor
dinate length." They feared that

if Boothovon "continues in his
present path, ho and the public
will he the sufferers."
Sir George Grove has remarked
that the vast passions of the
"Eroica" constitute such a tor
nado as would burst the breast
of any but the giant hero whom
Beethoven believed himself to be
portraying, and who was cer
tainly more himself than Napo
leon.
The first part of the program
will open with Cimarosa's Over
ture to "The Secret Marriage,"
and include's Bartok's Six Rou
manian Dances. Bartok is one of
the most important modern com
posers and based his Roumanian
Dances on Hungarian folk tunes.
Also included is Albert Rous
sel's classical ballet "Bacchus et
Ariane." Roussel wrote the score
in 1930, and it was introduced by
the Paris Opera in 1931. Five
years later, Charles Munch con
ducted the Orchestre Philharmo
nique in the premiere of the or
chestral suite.
After the season closes, con
ductor Enrique Jorda sets sail for
a busy summer conducting sched
ule. Jorda will appear at the
World's Fair in Brussels, the Ed
inburgh Festival, Madrid and the
world-famed Granada Festival.
Late in September, Jorda has
ten conducting dates in South Af
rica, where he will conduct the
South African Broadcasting Sym
phony in Johannesburg and Pre
toria.
