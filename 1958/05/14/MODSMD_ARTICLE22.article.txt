(Editor's Note: This- is the
second in a series of articles
covering 1 a panel discussion held
Monday between students and
facility members on the ques
tion of Research versus Teach
ing as criteria for faculty ap
pointment using the non • ap
pointment of Professor Mulford
Q. Sibley as a specific ex
ample.)
Graduate student in political
science A 1 Brouse raised the ques
tion that appeared uppermost in
the minds of the students present.
"Dr. Sterling," he said, "I don't
think that we can entirely disas
sociate this matter [teaching ver
sus research| with the appoint
ment of Professor Sibley because
this is the issue foremost in the
minds of everyone present who
has come to this meeting. There
fore, as far as it is possible for us
to do so, the weight given to re
search and teaching must be
placed upon this plane—that is,
with reference to Professor Sib
ley.
Effect of Sibley
"We are interested, above all,
in the effect that a teacher of his
caliber will have on Stanford.
Therefore, with reference to these
criteria and Professor Sibley,
what does a teacher of Sibley's
quality have to offer an under
graduate university as a stimulus
to growth? And what has he
done to the graduate portion, and
on the general level of the univer
sity what can we say about some
one who has done so much to
awaken an intellectual climate at
Stanford?
"So far we feel that Stanford
is not at this time fulfilling th£
duty to the students on all levels
of the university. We wish a
statement by the administration
on what kind of professor is want
ed at Stanford."
Case Is Closed
President Sterling answered
him by saying, "We agreed that
there was disagreement about the
weight that we would give to his
apparently extraordinary skill as
a teacher. That case is closed. I
appreciate the fact that this is
very important in your minds."
At this point graduate student
Peter Grot he commented,
"Throughout the country and cer
tainly at Stanford it is quite hard
to find attributes of a superlative
teacher and a superlative re
searcher." He cited former his
tory professor Stuart H. Hughes
as an example.
"There are so few," he contin
ued, "who fulfill the function of
being really good in both fields
it seems to me that when we have

a really gifted teacher, should ho
be sacrificed to people who are
highly qualified in research and
have names but are not able to
put over what they know in a
classroom or lecture?"
Difficult to Measure
"Teaching is difficult to meas
ure," Sterling answered. "It is
perhaps more difficult for the
student to measure than for the
faculty member. The student, the
undergraduate is in a good posi
tion to measure the efficiency of
communication. The university
has to study not only efficiency
but also substance, that is, schol
arship."
lIR President Craig Barnes
then asked, "Why should a teach
er who is known, or could be
known as Hughes was or Sibley
is, to be one of the finest in the
school as a man who is stimulat
ing hundreds of students in this
way—why need he be a publisher
at all?"

tory professor Stuart H. Hughes
as an example.
"There are so few," he contin
ued, "who fulfill the function of
being really good in both fields
it seems to me that when we have

a really gifted teacher, should ho
be sacrificed to people who are
highly qualified in research and
have names but are not able to
put over what they know in a
classroom or lecture?"
Difficult to Measure
"Teaching is difficult to meas
ure," Sterling answered. "It is
perhaps more difficult for the
student to measure than for the
faculty member. The student, the
undergraduate is in a good posi
tion to measure the efficiency of
communication. The university
has to study not only efficiency
but also substance, that is, schol
arship."
lIR President Craig Barnes
then asked, "Why should a teach
er who is known, or could be
known as Hughes was or Sibley
is, to be one of the finest in the
school as a man who is stimulat
ing hundreds of students in this
way—why need he be a publisher
at all?"

Monday between students and
facility members on the ques
tion of Research versus Teach
ing as criteria for faculty ap
pointment using the non • ap
pointment of Professor Mulford
Q. Sibley as a specific ex
ample.)
Graduate student in political
science A 1 Brouse raised the ques
tion that appeared uppermost in
the minds of the students present.
"Dr. Sterling," he said, "I don't
think that we can entirely disas
sociate this matter [teaching ver
sus research| with the appoint
ment of Professor Sibley because
this is the issue foremost in the
minds of everyone present who
has come to this meeting. There
fore, as far as it is possible for us
to do so, the weight given to re
search and teaching must be
placed upon this plane—that is,
with reference to Professor Sib
ley.
Effect of Sibley
"We are interested, above all,
in the effect that a teacher of his
caliber will have on Stanford.
Therefore, with reference to these
criteria and Professor Sibley,
what does a teacher of Sibley's
quality have to offer an under
graduate university as a stimulus
to growth? And what has he
done to the graduate portion, and
on the general level of the univer
sity what can we say about some
one who has done so much to
awaken an intellectual climate at
Stanford?
"So far we feel that Stanford
is not at this time fulfilling th£
duty to the students on all levels
of the university. We wish a
statement by the administration
on what kind of professor is want
ed at Stanford."
Case Is Closed
President Sterling answered
him by saying, "We agreed that
there was disagreement about the
weight that we would give to his
apparently extraordinary skill as
a teacher. That case is closed. I
appreciate the fact that this is
very important in your minds."
At this point graduate student
Peter Grot he commented,
"Throughout the country and cer
tainly at Stanford it is quite hard
to find attributes of a superlative
teacher and a superlative re
searcher." He cited former his
tory professor Stuart H. Hughes
as an example.
