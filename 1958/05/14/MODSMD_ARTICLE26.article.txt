### JOHN SCHWARZ 
Nation's Besl Tennis
If anyone wants to get a look at what lies ahead in the United
states tennis situation, he only has to meander down to the Stanford
varsity tennis courts on either Friday or Saturday afternoon this
week end.
The best college tennis players in the nation will he there, putting
on what should prove to be a whopper of a tennis exhibition. The
players will be UCLA's, USC's and Stanford's tennis squads playing
a pair of PCC matches.
UCLA Coach J. I). Morgan and his Bruins have already sewn up
the PCC title this year by defeating all the other teams in the con
ference plus USC twice; but if Stanford could beat t lie Bruins it
would be an important win and a long-awaited one, since the last, time
the Indians whipped the Bruins was back in 1912.
The importance of the match lies mainly in the fact that of the
three schools, only Stanford is eligible for the NCAA Championships
in June. If Stanford did beat UCLA qonsidered by most the best
college squad in the nation it would make the Indians the strong
favorite in this year's Collegiate Championships.
Stanford's hopes against UCLA, however, are only fair, and it
would take a miraculous effort by the Cards to pull an upset over'
the Bruins.
UCLA's top four men—Mike Franks, Mike Green, John Cranston
and John Lesch—compose one of the best one-through-four punches
that has ever been known in collegiate tennis. Each one of the four
could rank No. 1 on most college teams, and they're so evenly
matched that they often are switched around from one spot to
another.
This year Franks and Cranston have been playing the best, tennis
of the four and are therefore in UCLA's top two positions.
Franks, who is currently No. 1, has been dueling with Stanford's
Jack Douglas in California's tennis world for many years, going all
the way back to when both were in the 15-and-under group. So far
the series is almost even, with Franks having won the first match
that the two played this year and Douglas having beaten Franks
last year.
Saturday's match between the two looms as one of the best tennis
duels of the season, with Douglas out to avenge the 6-4, 6-4 loss he
suffered at the hands of Franks earlier this year.
The UCLA-Stanford match, however, probably won't be decided
in any one of the top singles competitions but in the fifth and sixth
singles spots. Stanford's Jim "Lud" Jeffries and Gil White, playing
those two positions, will have to win if the Indians are going to have
any hope of winning the match.
Jeffries will face Franklin Johnson, whom he took to three sets
down in Los Angeles. Jeffries had won the opening set and was win
ning the second when he felt the heat of the day and crumpled his
way into second- and third-set losses. Saturday things will have to
he different if Stanford is to survive.
Gil White did not play singles in the 9-0 Los Angeles rout, and
his match with the Bruins' Dale Kohland should bo a toss-up.
The Amazing Olmeclo
Friday's match with SC leaves the home crowd with a little more
hope, since the Trojans present a much weaker squad than do the
Bruins. The only spot where the Trojans are extremely strong is in
the No. 1 singles position, where they have Peruvian Alex Olniedo.
Olmedo is undoubtedly the best young tennis player in the United
States right now. Many experts, including Jack Kramer, have com
pared Alejandro to Pancho Gonzales, and anyone who watches him
on Friday, I'm sure, will go along with the experts.
The USC-Stanl'ord match in Los Angeles ended in a 7-2 win for
the Trojans, but all the Stanford losses were very close, and, with
Stanford having the advantage of their home courts this week end,
the results might just be turned around.
Many tennis fans who may be down at the courts this week end
will probably be novice players themselves, and for those fans here
are some features of the two Los Angeles teams to watch for:
Best serve —Jim Buck (USC)
Best forehand —A1 Olmedo (USC)
Best backhand —Mike Franks (UCLA)
Best overhead —John Lesch (UCLA)
Best volley—the whole SC team
For the purely spectator fan, here are what figure to be the high
light matches:
Best singles match —Olmedo-Douglas or Franks-Douglas
Best doubles match — Cranston-Lesch (UCLA) vs. Carruth-Nelson
(Stanford)
Key matches for Stanford on Friday: Guzman-Jeffries, Nelson-Davis,
all the doubles
Key matches for Stanford on Saturday: Rohland-White, Jeffries-
Johnson, Franks-Douglas

UCLA Coach J. I). Morgan and his Bruins have already sewn up
the PCC title this year by defeating all the other teams in the con
ference plus USC twice; but if Stanford could beat t lie Bruins it
would be an important win and a long-awaited one, since the last, time
the Indians whipped the Bruins was back in 1912.
The importance of the match lies mainly in the fact that of the
three schools, only Stanford is eligible for the NCAA Championships
in June. If Stanford did beat UCLA qonsidered by most the best
college squad in the nation it would make the Indians the strong
favorite in this year's Collegiate Championships.
Stanford's hopes against UCLA, however, are only fair, and it
would take a miraculous effort by the Cards to pull an upset over'
the Bruins.
UCLA's top four men—Mike Franks, Mike Green, John Cranston
and John Lesch—compose one of the best one-through-four punches
that has ever been known in collegiate tennis. Each one of the four
could rank No. 1 on most college teams, and they're so evenly
matched that they often are switched around from one spot to
another.
This year Franks and Cranston have been playing the best, tennis
of the four and are therefore in UCLA's top two positions.
Franks, who is currently No. 1, has been dueling with Stanford's
Jack Douglas in California's tennis world for many years, going all
the way back to when both were in the 15-and-under group. So far
the series is almost even, with Franks having won the first match
that the two played this year and Douglas having beaten Franks
last year.
Saturday's match between the two looms as one of the best tennis
duels of the season, with Douglas out to avenge the 6-4, 6-4 loss he
suffered at the hands of Franks earlier this year.
The UCLA-Stanford match, however, probably won't be decided
in any one of the top singles competitions but in the fifth and sixth
singles spots. Stanford's Jim "Lud" Jeffries and Gil White, playing
those two positions, will have to win if the Indians are going to have
any hope of winning the match.
Jeffries will face Franklin Johnson, whom he took to three sets
down in Los Angeles. Jeffries had won the opening set and was win
ning the second when he felt the heat of the day and crumpled his
way into second- and third-set losses. Saturday things will have to
he different if Stanford is to survive.
Gil White did not play singles in the 9-0 Los Angeles rout, and
his match with the Bruins' Dale Kohland should bo a toss-up.
The Amazing Olmeclo
Friday's match with SC leaves the home crowd with a little more
hope, since the Trojans present a much weaker squad than do the
Bruins. The only spot where the Trojans are extremely strong is in
the No. 1 singles position, where they have Peruvian Alex Olniedo.
Olmedo is undoubtedly the best young tennis player in the United
States right now. Many experts, including Jack Kramer, have com
pared Alejandro to Pancho Gonzales, and anyone who watches him
on Friday, I'm sure, will go along with the experts.
The USC-Stanl'ord match in Los Angeles ended in a 7-2 win for
the Trojans, but all the Stanford losses were very close, and, with
Stanford having the advantage of their home courts this week end,
the results might just be turned around.
Many tennis fans who may be down at the courts this week end
will probably be novice players themselves, and for those fans here
are some features of the two Los Angeles teams to watch for:
Best serve —Jim Buck (USC)
Best forehand —A1 Olmedo (USC)
Best backhand —Mike Franks (UCLA)
Best overhead —John Lesch (UCLA)
Best volley—the whole SC team
For the purely spectator fan, here are what figure to be the high
light matches:
Best singles match —Olmedo-Douglas or Franks-Douglas
Best doubles match — Cranston-Lesch (UCLA) vs. Carruth-Nelson
(Stanford)
Key matches for Stanford on Friday: Guzman-Jeffries, Nelson-Davis,

Key matches for Stanford on Saturday: Rohland-White, Jeffries-

three schools, only Stanford is eligible for the NCAA Championships
in June. If Stanford did beat UCLA qonsidered by most the best
college squad in the nation it would make the Indians the strong
favorite in this year's Collegiate Championships.
Stanford's hopes against UCLA, however, are only fair, and it
would take a miraculous effort by the Cards to pull an upset over'
the Bruins.
UCLA's top four men—Mike Franks, Mike Green, John Cranston
and John Lesch—compose one of the best one-through-four punches
that has ever been known in collegiate tennis. Each one of the four
could rank No. 1 on most college teams, and they're so evenly
matched that they often are switched around from one spot to
another.
This year Franks and Cranston have been playing the best, tennis
of the four and are therefore in UCLA's top two positions.
Franks, who is currently No. 1, has been dueling with Stanford's
Jack Douglas in California's tennis world for many years, going all
the way back to when both were in the 15-and-under group. So far
the series is almost even, with Franks having won the first match
that the two played this year and Douglas having beaten Franks
last year.
Saturday's match between the two looms as one of the best tennis
duels of the season, with Douglas out to avenge the 6-4, 6-4 loss he
suffered at the hands of Franks earlier this year.
The UCLA-Stanford match, however, probably won't be decided
in any one of the top singles competitions but in the fifth and sixth
singles spots. Stanford's Jim "Lud" Jeffries and Gil White, playing
those two positions, will have to win if the Indians are going to have
any hope of winning the match.
Jeffries will face Franklin Johnson, whom he took to three sets
down in Los Angeles. Jeffries had won the opening set and was win
ning the second when he felt the heat of the day and crumpled his
way into second- and third-set losses. Saturday things will have to
he different if Stanford is to survive.
Gil White did not play singles in the 9-0 Los Angeles rout, and
his match with the Bruins' Dale Kohland should bo a toss-up.
The Amazing Olmeclo
Friday's match with SC leaves the home crowd with a little more
hope, since the Trojans present a much weaker squad than do the
Bruins. The only spot where the Trojans are extremely strong is in
the No. 1 singles position, where they have Peruvian Alex Olniedo.
Olmedo is undoubtedly the best young tennis player in the United
States right now. Many experts, including Jack Kramer, have com
pared Alejandro to Pancho Gonzales, and anyone who watches him
on Friday, I'm sure, will go along with the experts.
The USC-Stanl'ord match in Los Angeles ended in a 7-2 win for
the Trojans, but all the Stanford losses were very close, and, with
Stanford having the advantage of their home courts this week end,
the results might just be turned around.
Many tennis fans who may be down at the courts this week end
will probably be novice players themselves, and for those fans here
are some features of the two Los Angeles teams to watch for:
Best serve —Jim Buck (USC)
Best forehand —A1 Olmedo (USC)
Best backhand —Mike Franks (UCLA)
Best overhead —John Lesch (UCLA)
Best volley—the whole SC team
For the purely spectator fan, here are what figure to be the high
light matches:
Best singles match —Olmedo-Douglas or Franks-Douglas
Best doubles match — Cranston-Lesch (UCLA) vs. Carruth-Nelson
(Stanford)
Key matches for Stanford on Friday: Guzman-Jeffries, Nelson-Davis,
all the doubles
Key matches for Stanford on Saturday: Rohland-White, Jeffries-
Johnson, Franks-Douglas

Nation's Besl Tennis
If anyone wants to get a look at what lies ahead in the United
states tennis situation, he only has to meander down to the Stanford
varsity tennis courts on either Friday or Saturday afternoon this
week end.
The best college tennis players in the nation will he there, putting
on what should prove to be a whopper of a tennis exhibition. The
players will be UCLA's, USC's and Stanford's tennis squads playing
a pair of PCC matches.
UCLA Coach J. I). Morgan and his Bruins have already sewn up
the PCC title this year by defeating all the other teams in the con
ference plus USC twice; but if Stanford could beat t lie Bruins it
would be an important win and a long-awaited one, since the last, time
the Indians whipped the Bruins was back in 1912.
