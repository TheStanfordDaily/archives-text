# Nelson Leads Indian Netters in Cal Tourney
## 
### 
Dick Ogden, Dave Nelson and
Brooks Rawlins became the only
three Stanford netters to gain the
fourth round of Ihe state tennis
tourney yesterday as two of their
teammates fell by the wayside in
second-round singles play.
Dave Nelson gained a real good
win to gain his fourth-round
berth by beating highly rated
Bobby Siska. Siska recently won
the San Francisco High School
tennis title, and is considered one
of the tennis stars of tomorrow.
Nelson, however, ignored Sis
ka's reputation and went on to
trim the young San Franciscan
by a 6-2, 6-2 score.
Stanford freshman star Dick
Ogden continued on his way
through the tourney as he pulled
out a tough three-set win from
Morris Sockolov. Ogden later in
the afternoon came back to team
with freshman Norm Karns to
take an opening - round doubles
victory.
