# Frosh Nine Hosts Jeff
## 
### 
Right hander Earl Russell will
lead the Stanford freshmen
against Jefferson High of Daly
City today at 3:15 p.m. on the
frosh diamond. Coach Mickey
Holzman's Papooses will be after
their eighth win of the season
against four losses.
Although Jefferson is regarded
as one of the tougher Peninsula
high schools, the frosh are fa
vored to win, especially if they
continue to hit Ihe ball as they
have in the past two games.
Bill Jensen, Mike Bertolet, Hal
Shut/man and Mike Filice have
been the big Papoose sluggers of
late and all should do well in the
remaining games this season.
Holzman rates the frosh 8-2 vic
tory over Santa Clara frosh Inst
Saturday as the best all-round
Papoose effort this season. He
praised the hilting and fielding as
Ihe frosh collected ten safeties
and executed three sharp double
plays.
Pitcher Russell will be out to
gain his third win of the season.
His current record stands now at
2 and 3. Dave Carter will also be
available to hurl and has shown
excellent late-inning pitching so
far this season.
