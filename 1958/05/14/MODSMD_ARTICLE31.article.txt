### Russ Allen 
George A v e r y successfully
handcuffed USF, allowing only
three hits, while his Stanford
teammates collected 15 and
trounced the Dons 13-3 at Seals
Stadium yesterday. The win was
number 20 against 10 defeats for
the season for the Cards.
Joel Newkirk led the Card hit
ting attack with four singles in
five times at bat. A 1 Shaw and
Ralph Holding each hit three for
six to also help the Indian cause.
After three scoreless innings
the Indians jumped on San Fran
cisco starter John Basques for
four hits and seven big runs.
Catcher Holding led off with a
soliri single. Ben Robinson was
hit by the pitcher, moving Hold
ing to second. Jim Burk got on
by a fielder's choice and the sacks
were filled.
Avery Helps Own Cause
Dick Williams walked in Hold
ing, and then Avery helped his
own cause by singling in two
runs. Bob Dwight got on through

an error and Williams scored run
number four. Avery scored on
Rich De Fabio's sacrifice fly and
Newkirk singled in Dwight. Shaw
singled and Newkirk came in on
Holding's fielder's choice.
Stanford was scoreless until
the eighth when if produced live
runs in another big inning. New
kirk led off with a single scored
on Shaw's l'ly to deep centerfield
and the Don centerfielder could
n't hold on to it. Holding singled
in Shaw and Robinson followed
with a booming double.
Dow Doubles in Two
Dave Dow doubled in Robinson
and Holding, moved to third and
scored on Parker Olsen's sacri
i fice fly. This was the first game
that Olsen had played in since an
SC contest on April 12. Parker
had been out with an ankle injury
which he received in that Trojan
game.
The Indians ended their scoring
with a single run in the ninth. De
Fabio tripled; then was singled
home by first baseman Newkirk.

All in nil, the Tribe shelled Don
hurler Basques for 15 hits and
capitalized on live USF errors to
defeat the hapless Dons.
Stanford chucker Avery was
the master throughout the game
as he gave up single runs in the
second, seventh and eighth in
nings. lie successfully scattered
three USF hits and was never in
serious trouble.
Stanford comes homo for its
next series which will be with
Pepperdine. The Indians open
with an afternoon game Friday
at 3:15 on the Sunken Diamond.
They will finish up the series
with a 10 a.m. contest Saturday.
