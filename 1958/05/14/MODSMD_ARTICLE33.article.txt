# Cards Go South

Four Stanford runners will
compete in ilio Los Angeles Coli
seum Relays Friday, a highlight
meet of the West Coast spring
season. As many as 20 Indians
will be in the Pacific Association
AAU championships Saturday in
Burlingame.
Norman Lloyd, Frnie Cunliffe,
Chuck Cobb and Maury Graves
are the four who have been in
vited to the Coliseum meet. They
will be in on the baptism of the
Coliseum's new grass track, a
running surface which became
necessary when major league
baseball moved west.
Lloyd will compete in the
toughest mile race of his life.
Three men who have cracked the
four-minute barrier—Merv Lin
coln, Herb Elliott and Lazslq Ta
bori—will be in the field.
Experience Against Bowden
Lloyd will have his running ex
perience against Don Bowden two
weeks ago as one determiner of
his strategy against this excel
lent field.
Cunliffe will go in the open 880
against a still - not - determined
field. Dave Scurlock, North Caro
lina's excellent two-lap man, is a

definite entrant, but the status of
Tom Courtney, Arnie Sowell and
several others of the nation's best
runners still isn't known.
Graves will have his hands full
against Alex Henderson and Max
Truex in the two-mile—a race
that is being staged with the defi
nite aim of eclipsing Henderson's
U.S. collegiate record of 8:51.3.
Both Broke Record
Several weeks ago, the lanky
Australian from Arizona State
broke the record of 8:54.8 which
USC's Truex had set just a week
before. Henderson appears ready
to shoot for 8:40. He'll have Tru
ex right on his heels all the way,
and Graves figures he can stay
right with the pair.
Cobb, still recovering from his
recent pneumonia, will go in the
Coliseum high hurdles. He ran
14.4 at the West Coast Relays
great time considering his physi
cal condition.
The PAAAU meet, moved to
'Burlingame from Stockton, will
find most of the top track and
field men from this area compet
ing, plus a smattering of stars
from other areas.
