# Psychiatrists Tell Results Of Mental Patient Studies
## 
### 
Two Stanford psychiatrists told
members of the American Psyehi
atric Association that, when over
whelmed by trouble, men are like
ly to become alcoholics while
women tend to become schizo
phrenic.
Dr. Josephine Hilgard, associ
ate clinical professor of psychi
atry at the Stanford Medical
School, and Mrs. Martha F. New
man, research assistant, reported
the results of a four-year statisti
cal study of over 2800 alcoholic
and schizophrenic patients ad
milled to Agnews State Hospital
to an Association meeting in San
Francisco yesterday.
"Women . . . tend lo withdraw
into a private dream world of
their own," said the psychiatrists,
while men are likely to reach for
the bottle.
The statistics showed that wom
en greatly outnumbered men
among schizophrenic cases, while
among alcoholics the reverse was
true. However, the total number
of patients in the two categories

showed about the same number
of patients for the two diseases
combined.
It was this fact that caused the
psychiatrists to investigate tho
possibility that alcoholism and
schizophrenia might be alternate
illnesses.
In investigations of smaller
groups of patients the psychia
trists reported that alcoholic men
and schizophrenic women with
similar case histories were com
mon while similarities between
cases of alcoholic men and wom
en or schizophrenic men and
women were relatively rare.
"We are investigating broader
reasons, such as cultural factors,
to explain the marked divergence
between the two sexes," said the
psychiatrists.
