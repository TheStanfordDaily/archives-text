# Nixon Stoned Jeered by Mobs In Venezuela Demonstrations
## Teen-Age Crowds Attack Car Of Vice-President's Wife 
### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (ft*) Screaming, jeering mobs of teen-agers
stoned and spat, on Vice-President Nixon, hauled at Mrs. Nixon and
beat in the doors and windows of their cars yesterday. It was the
most furious anti-United States demonstration of their South Ameri
can tour.
The Vice-President was lucky to escape unharmed. His limousine

was badly dented and its windows
broken by kicks and blows from
sticks and pipes. A youth dented
the door of Mrs. Nixon's car.
The U.S. flags on both cars
were ripped from their standards.
Six Americans in all were in
jured. Secret Serviceman John T.
Sherwood, who suffered a chip
ped tooth in Ihe stoning at Lima
last Thursday, twice pulled his
gun, but did not use it.
Venezuela's foreign minister,
himself hurt by splintered glass
from the windows of Nixon's car,
apologized for the outburst on the
spot.
Mrs. Nixon
Mrs. Nixon sat looking straight
ahead as her car was dented with
stones and its windows smeared
with eggs and spit.
"She was as grave as any man
I've ever seen," an aide said.
The uncontrolled youths were
finally sent helter-skelter by a
special troop detachment which
showered them with tear gas.
The Vice-President, after being
rushed to the medical center to
see if anyone was injured, step
ped out of his car unperturbed.
"I'm all right," he said. "They
cannot frighten me."
Canceled Trip
He canceled a trip to the Vene
zuelan Pantheon to honor libera
tor Simon Bolivar when told that
a mob was waiting there. He had
planned to place a wreath there.
The first demonstration was at
the airport. A yelling youth grab
bed Mrs. Nixon by tho hand and
shouted at her, "Little Rock!
Little Rock!" He supposedly had
in mind the school integration
troubles there.
She remained composed and at
tempted to smile, while an aide
helped her into a car.
Maximum
The virulence of the demonstra
tion surprised Venezuelan offi
cials. They had announced that
maximum security precautions
would be in effect during the
Vice-President's stay because of
rumors that an assassination at
tempt would be made on him.
Rear Adm. Wolfgang Larraza
bal. chief of Venezuela's ruling
junta, sent over a bulletproof
limousine for the Vice-President's
use later.
The Vice - President and Mrs.
Nixon flew here from Bogota, Co
lombia, where he received a
friendly reception after being
spat upon arid stoned by students
at San Marcos University in
Lima, Peru, last week.
