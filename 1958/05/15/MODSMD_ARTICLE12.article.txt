Americans out of trouble zones
yesterday as anti - government
rioting raged for the fifth
straight day. U.S. anti-riot weap
ons were being flown in to help
authorities cope with the disor
ders.
The U.S. Embassy sent a ship
to pick up 53 Americans in Tri
poli, the north Lebanese port
where the first rioting erupted
Saturday with the sacking of a
U.S. Information Agency office.
Other Americans came in from
eastern Lebanon.
Bombings, shootings and
strikes continued in disorders at
tributed by the Lebanese govern
ment to massive intervention by
President Nasser's United Arab

Republic. A bomb exploded harm
lessly outside the U.S. Embassy.
U.S. Ambassador Rober Mc-
Clintock told a news conference
the United States is "determined
to help this government maintain
internal security."
It was disclosed the United
States is flying in tear gas bombs,
tear gas masks and ammunition
for the Lebanese police. Lebanon
also had asked for rifles, but the
United States was unable to sup
ply them.
The ambassador said the situa
tion in Tripoli was very serious
and the Americans were being
urged, not ordered, to leave.
Reports from Tripoli indicated
police there were quitting their
posts and guards around an
American building were leaving.
Rioters were said to be getting
out of control of opposition politi
cal leaders as well as of the gov
ernment.
Lebanese armored cars brought
Americans and two Cypriot girls
to Beirut from the Bekaa Vellcy
in the eastern part of the country.
The U.S. Embassy had asked that
the Americans be brought out.
McClintock said the embassy
had no intention of evacuating
Americans from Beirut.
U.S. Navy vessels that arrived
in Gibraltar planning to stay for
several days left unexpectedly to
day for an undisclosed destina
tion. Unconfirmed reports said
they headed for Lebanon.
