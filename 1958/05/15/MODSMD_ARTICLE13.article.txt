# Nixon Due Home Today; Knight Calls Riots Insult
## 
### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (JP) Vice
President Nixon cut short the tag
end of his riot-ridden South Amer
ican good will tour and took off
late yesterday for Puerto Rico.
lie is due in Washington at 10
a.m. today.
The Nixons were heckled in
Uruguay, shoved in Argentina,
«pat on and the object of rock
throwing in Peru and almost mur
derous rock attacks in Caracas.
Windows of the Vice President's
car were shattered. At one place
Mrs. Nixon was spat upon di
rectly in the face by a demon
strator.
Marines, Paratroopers
Meanwhile, 1000 U.S. Marines
and paratroopers from U.S. bases
took up posts in Cuba and Puerto
Rico—about three hours' flying
time from Caracas. They were
ordered there by President Eisen
hower to protect Nixon if request
ed by the Venezuelan government.
The government gave assurances
it could handle the situation, how
ever.
There can be little doubt that
Communists instigated the dem
onstrations along the Vice Presi
dent's route. The slogans and the
action are both too familiar.
There would be danger, how
ever, in attributing all the trouble
to an unrepresentative minority.
Underlying Resentment
In retrospect, observers in Ven
ezuela are finding an underlying
background of resentment against
foreign practices and foreign per
sonnel employed in developing the
country's resources.
The original schedule called for
Nixon to leave Caracas at 12:30
this morning. But he had can
celed programed events after the
mob violence, and spent most of
his time at the embassy residence
—U.S. territory.
With the Puerto Rican stopover,
his return to Washington will con
form to the original schedule of
10 a.m. today.
