# The 						Issues Remain

I'm'.sinr.vr Stf.ri.ing and other members of the
Administration have made public those reasons
which they saw lit to give as to why Mulford
Sihlev was not appointed to the vacancy in the
Political Science Department. We thank them
for showing their consideration for student in
terest in this matter.
I he reasons given in Monday's meeting with
student leaders (and reported in The Daily)
were necessarily general. The Administration's
main point seems to be that it knows more
about the University's long-range needs than do
the students or faculty, and must therefore ex
ercise final authority.
I'hal this authority exists, no one questions;
and we must reluctantly acknowledge the fact
that the specific question of Dr. Sihlev's ap
pointment is closed.
Ilorceier, the issues raised by the Sihlev case
are far from settled. The main question in our
minds, after ha\ ing examined the complex hier
archical structure of the Administration in con
nection with the Political Science appointment,
concerns Stanford's amazing administrative cen
tralization.
The concept of departmental autonomy that
operates at other universities seems to be un
known at Stanford. One professor told us it
would be "unheard of" al any other university 1
for the administration to go against a depart
mental recommendation on an appointment.
However, the Stanford faculty does not seem
willing lo assert itself and demand any pre
rogatives. I lie faculty seems lo be dominated,
lo a great exlenl, by the same fear and silence
for which students are constantly being criti
cized.
We have been discouraged by the lack of
faculty comment 011 the Sihlev ease and on the
issues il points up. We deplore the popular
faculty "taboo on expressing opinion in The
Daily. Keali/ing Stanford s potentials requires
the activc» participation and cooperation of all
three interest groups faculty, students and Ad
ministration.

\\ luil sort of ;i force is the much-publicized
"Stanford Family" if il is a family only to the
extent of 11 a\ ill a paternalistic 1 head in the
form of the Administration?
Vt e cannot question the Administration's sin
cerit\ and integritv and its desire to improve
the University : hut we ran and should question
the advisahility of its methods.
\\ e would like to see a clear statement by
the Office of the President on the University's
academic policy. W hat kind of an institution
does the Administration want Stanford to he?
\\ hat kind of students does il want to turn out?
The Administration points out that it is con
cerned with Stanford's long-range good whereas
the students are interested only in immediate
aims.
Hnt we would like to surest that such im
mediate aims as studying under a stimulating
professor are more important to Stanford's
long-range goals than the Administration seems
to think: for the quality of the students which
Stanford graduates is just as hig a prestige
huilding factor for the University as i:« the num
ber of famous professors on its faculty.
\\ e feel also that it might he more to Stan
ford's credit to hire professors with a potential
for good scholarship which might he developed
here. Is it so much to the University's credit
that il is ahle merelv to Imv off an already
famous scholar?
I liese are some of the mam questions which
the Sibley case has raised in our minds- We
regret the embarrassment caused to Dr. Sibley
as his personality and qualifications have been
tossed back and forth in the recent discussions.
Rut since one of Dr. Sibley's greatest attri
butes as a teacher is his ;d>ilit\ to raise thought
provoking questions, we somehow feel that he
doesn't object to being the focal point in such
an important controversy.
IVrhaps the best wax we can apologize to
Dr. Sibley, and show our appreciation for what
he has (1 one for so man\ students during his
year at Stanford, is to go on raising epiestions.

I'hal this authority exists, no one questions;
and we must reluctantly acknowledge the fact
that the specific question of Dr. Sihlev's ap

Ilorceier, the issues raised by the Sihlev case
are far from settled. The main question in our

concerns Stanford's amazing administrative cen

The concept of departmental autonomy that
operates at other universities seems to be un

would be "unheard of" al any other university 1
for the administration to go against a depart

However, the Stanford faculty does not seem
willing lo assert itself and demand any pre

for which students are constantly being criti

We have been discouraged by the lack of
faculty comment 011 the Sihlev ease and on the

faculty "taboo on expressing opinion in The

I'hal this authority exists, no one questions;
and we must reluctantly acknowledge the fact
that the specific question of Dr. Sihlev's ap
pointment is closed.
Ilorceier, the issues raised by the Sihlev case
are far from settled. The main question in our
minds, after ha\ ing examined the complex hier
archical structure of the Administration in con
nection with the Political Science appointment,
concerns Stanford's amazing administrative cen
tralization.
The concept of departmental autonomy that
operates at other universities seems to be un
known at Stanford. One professor told us it
would be "unheard of" al any other university 1
for the administration to go against a depart
mental recommendation on an appointment.
However, the Stanford faculty does not seem
willing lo assert itself and demand any pre
rogatives. I lie faculty seems lo be dominated,
lo a great exlenl, by the same fear and silence
for which students are constantly being criti
cized.
We have been discouraged by the lack of
faculty comment 011 the Sihlev ease and on the
issues il points up. We deplore the popular
faculty "taboo on expressing opinion in The
Daily. Keali/ing Stanford s potentials requires
the activc» participation and cooperation of all
three interest groups faculty, students and Ad
ministration.

\\ luil sort of ;i force is the much-publicized
"Stanford Family" if il is a family only to the
extent of 11 a\ ill a paternalistic 1 head in the
form of the Administration?
Vt e cannot question the Administration's sin
cerit\ and integritv and its desire to improve
the University : hut we ran and should question
the advisahility of its methods.
\\ e would like to see a clear statement by
the Office of the President on the University's
academic policy. W hat kind of an institution
does the Administration want Stanford to he?
\\ hat kind of students does il want to turn out?
The Administration points out that it is con
cerned with Stanford's long-range good whereas
the students are interested only in immediate
aims.
Hnt we would like to surest that such im
mediate aims as studying under a stimulating
professor are more important to Stanford's
long-range goals than the Administration seems
to think: for the quality of the students which
Stanford graduates is just as hig a prestige
huilding factor for the University as i:« the num
ber of famous professors on its faculty.
\\ e feel also that it might he more to Stan
ford's credit to hire professors with a potential
for good scholarship which might he developed
here. Is it so much to the University's credit
that il is ahle merelv to Imv off an already
famous scholar?
I liese are some of the mam questions which
the Sibley case has raised in our minds- We
regret the embarrassment caused to Dr. Sibley
as his personality and qualifications have been
tossed back and forth in the recent discussions.
Rut since one of Dr. Sibley's greatest attri
butes as a teacher is his ;d>ilit\ to raise thought
provoking questions, we somehow feel that he
doesn't object to being the focal point in such
an important controversy.
IVrhaps the best wax we can apologize to
Dr. Sibley, and show our appreciation for what
he has (1 one for so man\ students during his
year at Stanford, is to go on raising epiestions.
