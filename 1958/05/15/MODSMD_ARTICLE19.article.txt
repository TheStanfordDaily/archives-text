Scratch Sheet Valuable
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to say publicly what I have said
privately to a number of students concerning the
publication of Scratch Sheet.
Any group of Stanford students sufficiently in
forested in their education to undertake a survey
of student opinion concerning courses is most
likely to produce an honest and valuable result.

In terms of my experience elsewhere this type of
serious student interest in ihe curriculum has
proved important for both students and faculty.
The presence of students willing to fake on a
task such as this is a good sign. I recall, it seems
to me, heat ing something about "(lie intellectual
apathy of Stanford sludents." This doesn't fit
that image.
