## 
### Camille Peterson 
There has been a great im
provement in college music in the
last 15 years, according to Dr.
Randall Thompson, well - known
composer, who is a guest of the
Music Department this week.
Thompson will speak on "Music—
Amen" this afternoon at 4:15 at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Thompson is spending two and
a half weeks on the West Coast
before leaving for Europe. He
will go to France and Spain be
fore arriving at his destination,
Gstaad, Switzerland. It is here
that he composed several of his
more noted works: "Mass of the
Holy Spirit," "Ode to a Virginian
Voyage," "Trip to Nahant" and
his Second Symphony.
The Stanford University Cho
rus gave the West Coast premiere

of "Ode to a Virginian Voyage"
last December.
During the early 30's, Thomp
son made an investigation of mu
sic in American colleges and
wrote a report on his findings.
His book. "College Music," was
published shortly before he start
ed the chorus at the University
of California in 1936.
Music Improved
Since this time, Thompson feels
that college music has improved
in many ways. There is better
teaching of theory and history;
the standards of performance of
choral and instrumental groups
has risen; and there is a greater
respect for music as an essential
clement of the liberal education.
A wider interest in composition
has arisen and also a greater pro
ficiency . . . almost too much pro
ficiency for comfort, Thompson
added.
Thompson has been a professor
of music at Harvard since 1918.
He previously spent time at Wel
lesley, University of California
and Princeton, where he first met
Sandor Salgo.
He spent the war years at the
University of Virginia. During
this lime he composed the inter
nationally famous "Testament of
Freedom." The latest perform
ance of this work was in northern
Japan. The all-male chorus sent
Dr. Thompson a program from
the performance and also the text
in Japanese.
Next Year
Next year, "Testament of Free
om" will be given in Korea. All
the words are applicable to both
countries. In both translations
permission for only one change
has been made ... to change the
date of independence mentioned in
the work from July 4 to Korea's
date of independence.
A concert of Thompson's works
will be performed by the Univer
sity Chorus, mezzo-soprano Mari
lyn Poppino and a string quartet
Sunday at 4 p.m. at Dinkelspiel.
"The Last Words of David,"
which will appear on the pro

getting ready to leave for Europe
when Koussevitzky pushed him to
write the work to be performed
by the Boston Symphony Orches
tra and all the students at Tangle
wood as the final number of a
Voice of America film about Tan
glewood.
"Rosemary" was written in
1928. It is composed of poems by

wife. "Mass of the Holy Spirit"
