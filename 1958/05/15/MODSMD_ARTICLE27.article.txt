# High School Reappraisal May Show U.S. Youth Not Far Behind Russians
## 
### Joan Woods 
Two contradictory headlines ap
peared on the same page in the
March 30 issue of the New York
Times.
"Education in U.S. Called Su
perior" read the first, and in an
adjoining column appeared "Na
tion's Schools Termed Scandal."
This confusion of charges and
counter-charges during the past
few months is part and parcel of
the most agonizing reappraisal
directed at the U.S. educational
system since the first little red
schoolhouse was erected in the
Colonies.
Death and Taxes
Like death and taxes, criticism
of the school system is something
we have always with us. Criti
cism and reappraisal of our sec
ondary schools is of vital concern,
for the schools must give students
a good foundation in basic sub
jects if Stanford and other uni
versities are to do the educational
job needed and expected of them.
With the appearance of the
first Russian Sputnik over U.S.
territory, the critics launched an
all-out, bitter attack on the
schools.
The "average" Soviet student
and the "average" American stu
dent were compared as to moti
vation, achievement and the con
tent of courses they take—with
the kids from the U.S.A. not even
running a good second.
Sputnik Jolt
As always when the public re
ceives a jolt like the Sputnik
launching, public opinion is apt
to become a little hysterical with
arguments buttressed by incom
plete or incorrect facts.
The headlines in the New York
Times were contradictory because
their sources were talking about
two different things. Even now,
months after the Soviet coup, crit
ics and defenders are still not
arguing on the same grounds.
For one thing, no adequate com
parison can be made of the two
school systems. In Russia, only

17 per cent of the students are in
high school — and these take a
standard, narrow curriculum with
no electives.
Dr. Paul Dell. Hurd, associate
professor of education, says, "If
we took the top 17 per cent of our
high school students and com
pared them w i th Russian stu
dents, we'd be right along with
them."
To understand the difference
between our educational system
and that in Russia or elsewhere
in Europe, we must examine the
basic premises that underlie the
U.S. concept of education.
Narrow Elite
In the 19th century, and still
today in Europe, secondary edu
cation was for a narrow elite who
were destined for the universities
and professions. One standard
curriculum was suitable for all
st u dents.
But the American people, em
barked on the great democratic
experiment, decided they could
not govern themselves adequately
or well without advanced educa
tion.
The limiting of education to a
small minority was repugnant to
their concepts, and free public ed
ucation for everyone became a
right and finally a duty.
Comprehensive High School
Thus developed our concept of
the "comprehensive" high school,
the institution that had to under
take the training of Mary Jones
for marriage and motherhood,
Martha Shith for a stenographic
position in a downtown office, Joe
131ake for the job in Harry's Ga
rage, and John Brown who would
go on to college and study law or
medicine.
The dull and the bright, the rich
and the poor, met in the same
classrooms.
And the schools found them
selves faced with the impossible
job of being everything to every
body and often succeeding only in
being inadequate for everyone. A
flood of teen-aged youngsters con

verged on the schools.
Lack of money prevented the
expansion of overcrowded build
ings and the purchase of up-to
date equipment. The poorly paid
teaching profession was not at
tractive enough to obtain the
needed share of college graduates
for the overflowing classrooms.
This was the situation until re
cent years. It still persists in
many areas. But due to the ef
forts of farsighted teachers, par
ents and community leaders, ef
forts have been and are continu
ally being made to completely re
vamp our concepts of secondary
education.
Brighter Student
The most obvious defect of the
old system was the neglect of the
brighter student, who remained
unmotivated by the classes gear
ed to the average intellect, and
often lost interest in higher edu
cation.
To prevent this i disastrous
waste of the nation's potential
brain power, more and more
schools introduced "split-level"
classes, in which students were
placed with others of their own
achievement level.
Honors Programs
But honors programs require a
large and well-trained staff and
are difficult to establish in small
er schools, whore one man may be
responsible for an entire science
department. Accordingly, a school
consolidation movement has gath
ered momentum in the past few
years.
Parents and educators have
come to realize that the small
school is expensive to run, that
the students (contrary to popular
opinion) do not get the individual
attention or the high caliber of

instruction of the metropolitan
high schools.
This consolidation also has
proven expensive. Free transpor
tation over large distances must
be provided in some of the more
sparsely populated areas. Many
educators feel that federal aid to
education is the answer to the
initial expense.
But the problems are far from
solved. As Dr. Robert N. Bush,
professor of education, points out.
"Our schools are better than most
of the critics say, but they are
not as good as they should be or
must be." What then can be done?
• Increased teachers' salaries.
The American Council on Educa
tion has said that salaries should
at least be doubled.
• Improved teacher prepara
tion. A re-evaluation is needed
here on the amount and kind of
professional and academic train
ing needed and the proper combi
nation of both.
• College placement programs,
in which high school pupils take
college-level courses in literature,
history, languages, mathematics
and science. They enter college
with advanced standing and, in
some cases, with credit toward a
degree. Stanford began such a
system two years ago. Director j
of Admissions Rixford K. Snyder
says that schools qualifying so
far have been mostly eastern prep
schools and large metropolitan
public schools.
• More serious attitudes on the
part of both students and parents.
• Greater course continuity, es
pecially in languages and science.
Here students drop languages aft
er an average of two years. In
Europe they take five or six years
or more.

• More flexible approach to
school organization. Allot school
time according to the difficulty or
importance of the course. One
course may need 30 minutes oirly
once or 1 twice a week, while an
other should be given two hours
four or five times a week.
• Improved guidance programs
to make sure that each student
and his parents are informed of
his capabilities and the opportu
nities open to him.
These changes can be made
with a minimum of time and ex
pense. A more radical proposal
is Ihat of reducing the number of
years of college or high school
education for those students able
to handle an accelerated program.
Specialization
Adherents of this plan point to
the increasing specialization of
skills required in the various pro
fessions, the military service that
takes two years from a student's
program, tire increasing cost of
education and the rising number
of undergraduate and graduate
marriages. Three-year programs
also would lessen overcrowding in
the schools.
But in any event, the spotlight
of public opinion has been thrown
on the school system, and there it
will stay until the public is cer
tain that necessary changes and
improvements have been made.
"Society usually gets what it
wants," Snyder said in comment
ing on the unfairness of many of
the attacks on the public schools.
However, the United States is
not alone in searching for the an
swer to the educational dilemma.
Last'month Nikila Khrushchev
called for a major revision to
broaden the Soviet educational
system.

INDIVIDUAL THINKING AND ANALYSIS STIMULATED IN HIGH SCHOOL DISCUSSION
Menlo-Atherton seniors hold a round-table discussion about the tragic theme in Shakespeare's "Mac
beth" during an English class
Two contradictory headlines ap
peared on the same page in the
March 30 issue of the New York
Times.
"Education in U.S. Called Su
perior" read the first, and in an
adjoining column appeared "Na
tion's Schools Termed Scandal."
This confusion of charges and
counter-charges during the past
few months is part and parcel of
the most agonizing reappraisal
directed at the U.S. educational
system since the first little red
schoolhouse was erected in the
Colonies.
Death and Taxes
Like death and taxes, criticism
of the school system is something
we have always with us. Criti
cism and reappraisal of our sec
ondary schools is of vital concern,
for the schools must give students
a good foundation in basic sub
jects if Stanford and other uni
versities are to do the educational
job needed and expected of them.
With the appearance of the
first Russian Sputnik over U.S.
territory, the critics launched an
all-out, bitter attack on the
schools.
The "average" Soviet student
and the "average" American stu
dent were compared as to moti
vation, achievement and the con
tent of courses they take—with
the kids from the U.S.A. not even
running a good second.
Sputnik Jolt
As always when the public re
ceives a jolt like the Sputnik
launching, public opinion is apt
to become a little hysterical with
arguments buttressed by incom
plete or incorrect facts.
The headlines in the New York
Times were contradictory because
their sources were talking about
two different things. Even now,
months after the Soviet coup, crit
ics and defenders are still not
arguing on the same grounds.
For one thing, no adequate com
parison can be made of the two
school systems. In Russia, only

17 per cent of the students are in
high school — and these take a
standard, narrow curriculum with
no electives.
Dr. Paul Dell. Hurd, associate
professor of education, says, "If
we took the top 17 per cent of our
high school students and com
pared them w i th Russian stu
dents, we'd be right along with
them."
To understand the difference
between our educational system
and that in Russia or elsewhere
in Europe, we must examine the
basic premises that underlie the
U.S. concept of education.
Narrow Elite
In the 19th century, and still
today in Europe, secondary edu
cation was for a narrow elite who
were destined for the universities
and professions. One standard
curriculum was suitable for all
st u dents.
But the American people, em
barked on the great democratic
experiment, decided they could
not govern themselves adequately
or well without advanced educa
tion.
The limiting of education to a
small minority was repugnant to
their concepts, and free public ed
ucation for everyone became a
right and finally a duty.
Comprehensive High School
Thus developed our concept of
the "comprehensive" high school,
the institution that had to under
take the training of Mary Jones
for marriage and motherhood,
Martha Shith for a stenographic
position in a downtown office, Joe
131ake for the job in Harry's Ga
rage, and John Brown who would
go on to college and study law or
medicine.
The dull and the bright, the rich
and the poor, met in the same
classrooms.
And the schools found them
selves faced with the impossible
job of being everything to every
body and often succeeding only in
being inadequate for everyone. A
flood of teen-aged youngsters con

verged on the schools.
Lack of money prevented the
expansion of overcrowded build
ings and the purchase of up-to
date equipment. The poorly paid
teaching profession was not at
tractive enough to obtain the
needed share of college graduates
for the overflowing classrooms.
This was the situation until re
cent years. It still persists in
many areas. But due to the ef
forts of farsighted teachers, par
ents and community leaders, ef
forts have been and are continu
ally being made to completely re
vamp our concepts of secondary
education.
Brighter Student
The most obvious defect of the
old system was the neglect of the
brighter student, who remained
unmotivated by the classes gear
ed to the average intellect, and
often lost interest in higher edu
cation.
To prevent this i disastrous
waste of the nation's potential
brain power, more and more
schools introduced "split-level"
classes, in which students were
placed with others of their own
achievement level.
Honors Programs
But honors programs require a
large and well-trained staff and
are difficult to establish in small
er schools, whore one man may be
responsible for an entire science
department. Accordingly, a school
consolidation movement has gath
ered momentum in the past few
years.
Parents and educators have
come to realize that the small
school is expensive to run, that
the students (contrary to popular
opinion) do not get the individual
attention or the high caliber of

instruction of the metropolitan
high schools.
This consolidation also has
proven expensive. Free transpor
tation over large distances must
be provided in some of the more
sparsely populated areas. Many
educators feel that federal aid to
education is the answer to the
initial expense.
But the problems are far from
solved. As Dr. Robert N. Bush,
professor of education, points out.
"Our schools are better than most
of the critics say, but they are
not as good as they should be or
must be." What then can be done?
• Increased teachers' salaries.
The American Council on Educa
tion has said that salaries should
at least be doubled.
• Improved teacher prepara
tion. A re-evaluation is needed
here on the amount and kind of
professional and academic train
ing needed and the proper combi
nation of both.
• College placement programs,
in which high school pupils take
college-level courses in literature,
history, languages, mathematics
and science. They enter college
with advanced standing and, in
some cases, with credit toward a
degree. Stanford began such a
system two years ago. Director j
of Admissions Rixford K. Snyder
says that schools qualifying so
far have been mostly eastern prep
schools and large metropolitan
public schools.
• More serious attitudes on the
part of both students and parents.
• Greater course continuity, es
pecially in languages and science.
Here students drop languages aft
er an average of two years. In
Europe they take five or six years
or more.

• More flexible approach to
school organization. Allot school
time according to the difficulty or
importance of the course. One
course may need 30 minutes oirly
once or 1 twice a week, while an
other should be given two hours
four or five times a week.
• Improved guidance programs
to make sure that each student
and his parents are informed of
his capabilities and the opportu
nities open to him.
These changes can be made
with a minimum of time and ex

of the critics say, but they are
not as good as they should be or
must be." What then can be done?
• Increased teachers' salaries.
The American Council on Educa
tion has said that salaries should
at least be doubled.
• Improved teacher prepara
tion. A re-evaluation is needed
here on the amount and kind of
professional and academic train
ing needed and the proper combi
nation of both.
• College placement programs,
in which high school pupils take
college-level courses in literature,
history, languages, mathematics
and science. They enter college
with advanced standing and, in
some cases, with credit toward a
degree. Stanford began such a
system two years ago. Director j
of Admissions Rixford K. Snyder
says that schools qualifying so
far have been mostly eastern prep
schools and large metropolitan
public schools.
• More serious attitudes on the
part of both students and parents.
• Greater course continuity, es
pecially in languages and science.
Here students drop languages aft
er an average of two years. In
Europe they take five or six years
or more.

• More flexible approach to
school organization. Allot school
time according to the difficulty or
importance of the course. One
course may need 30 minutes oirly
once or 1 twice a week, while an
other should be given two hours
four or five times a week.
• Improved guidance programs
to make sure that each student
and his parents are informed of
his capabilities and the opportu
nities open to him.
These changes can be made
with a minimum of time and ex
pense. A more radical proposal
is Ihat of reducing the number of
years of college or high school
education for those students able
to handle an accelerated program.
Specialization
Adherents of this plan point to
the increasing specialization of
skills required in the various pro
fessions, the military service that
takes two years from a student's
program, tire increasing cost of
education and the rising number
of undergraduate and graduate
marriages. Three-year programs
also would lessen overcrowding in
the schools.
But in any event, the spotlight
of public opinion has been thrown
on the school system, and there it
will stay until the public is cer

improvements have been made.

INDIVIDUAL THINKING AND ANALYSIS STIMULATED IN HIGH SCHOOL DISCUSSION
Menlo-Atherton seniors hold a round-table discussion about the tragic theme in Shakespeare's "Mac
beth" during an English class
Two contradictory headlines ap
peared on the same page in the
March 30 issue of the New York
Times.
"Education in U.S. Called Su
perior" read the first, and in an
adjoining column appeared "Na
tion's Schools Termed Scandal."
This confusion of charges and
counter-charges during the past
few months is part and parcel of
the most agonizing reappraisal
directed at the U.S. educational
system since the first little red
schoolhouse was erected in the
Colonies.
Death and Taxes
Like death and taxes, criticism
of the school system is something
we have always with us. Criti
cism and reappraisal of our sec
ondary schools is of vital concern,
for the schools must give students
a good foundation in basic sub
jects if Stanford and other uni
versities are to do the educational
job needed and expected of them.
With the appearance of the
first Russian Sputnik over U.S.
territory, the critics launched an
all-out, bitter attack on the
schools.
The "average" Soviet student
and the "average" American stu
dent were compared as to moti
vation, achievement and the con
tent of courses they take—with
the kids from the U.S.A. not even
running a good second.
Sputnik Jolt
As always when the public re
ceives a jolt like the Sputnik
launching, public opinion is apt
to become a little hysterical with
arguments buttressed by incom
plete or incorrect facts.
The headlines in the New York
Times were contradictory because
their sources were talking about
two different things. Even now,
months after the Soviet coup, crit
ics and defenders are still not
arguing on the same grounds.
For one thing, no adequate com
parison can be made of the two
school systems. In Russia, only

17 per cent of the students are in
high school — and these take a
standard, narrow curriculum with
no electives.
Dr. Paul Dell. Hurd, associate
professor of education, says, "If
we took the top 17 per cent of our
high school students and com
pared them w i th Russian stu
dents, we'd be right along with
them."
To understand the difference
between our educational system
and that in Russia or elsewhere
in Europe, we must examine the
basic premises that underlie the
U.S. concept of education.
Narrow Elite
In the 19th century, and still
today in Europe, secondary edu
cation was for a narrow elite who
were destined for the universities
and professions. One standard
curriculum was suitable for all
st u dents.
But the American people, em
barked on the great democratic
experiment, decided they could
not govern themselves adequately
or well without advanced educa
tion.
The limiting of education to a
small minority was repugnant to
their concepts, and free public ed
ucation for everyone became a
right and finally a duty.
Comprehensive High School
Thus developed our concept of
the "comprehensive" high school,
the institution that had to under
take the training of Mary Jones
for marriage and motherhood,
Martha Shith for a stenographic
position in a downtown office, Joe
131ake for the job in Harry's Ga
rage, and John Brown who would
go on to college and study law or
medicine.
The dull and the bright, the rich
and the poor, met in the same
classrooms.
And the schools found them
selves faced with the impossible
job of being everything to every
body and often succeeding only in
being inadequate for everyone. A
flood of teen-aged youngsters con

verged on the schools.
Lack of money prevented the
expansion of overcrowded build
ings and the purchase of up-to
date equipment. The poorly paid
teaching profession was not at
tractive enough to obtain the
needed share of college graduates
for the overflowing classrooms.
This was the situation until re
cent years. It still persists in
many areas. But due to the ef
forts of farsighted teachers, par
ents and community leaders, ef
forts have been and are continu
ally being made to completely re
vamp our concepts of secondary
education.
Brighter Student
The most obvious defect of the
old system was the neglect of the
brighter student, who remained
unmotivated by the classes gear
ed to the average intellect, and
often lost interest in higher edu
cation.
To prevent this i disastrous
waste of the nation's potential
brain power, more and more
schools introduced "split-level"
classes, in which students were
placed with others of their own
achievement level.
Honors Programs
But honors programs require a
large and well-trained staff and
are difficult to establish in small
er schools, whore one man may be
responsible for an entire science
department. Accordingly, a school
consolidation movement has gath
ered momentum in the past few
years.
Parents and educators have
come to realize that the small
school is expensive to run, that
the students (contrary to popular
opinion) do not get the individual
attention or the high caliber of

instruction of the metropolitan
high schools.
This consolidation also has
proven expensive. Free transpor
tation over large distances must
be provided in some of the more
sparsely populated areas. Many
educators feel that federal aid to
education is the answer to the
initial expense.
But the problems are far from
solved. As Dr. Robert N. Bush,
professor of education, points out.
"Our schools are better than most

forts have been and are continu

education.
Brighter Student
The most obvious defect of the
old system was the neglect of the
brighter student, who remained
unmotivated by the classes gear
ed to the average intellect, and
often lost interest in higher edu
cation.
To prevent this i disastrous
waste of the nation's potential
brain power, more and more
schools introduced "split-level"
classes, in which students were
placed with others of their own
achievement level.
Honors Programs
But honors programs require a
large and well-trained staff and
are difficult to establish in small
er schools, whore one man may be
responsible for an entire science
department. Accordingly, a school
consolidation movement has gath
ered momentum in the past few
years.
Parents and educators have
come to realize that the small
school is expensive to run, that
the students (contrary to popular
opinion) do not get the individual
attention or the high caliber of

instruction of the metropolitan
high schools.
This consolidation also has
proven expensive. Free transpor
tation over large distances must
be provided in some of the more
sparsely populated areas. Many
educators feel that federal aid to
education is the answer to the
initial expense.
But the problems are far from
solved. As Dr. Robert N. Bush,
professor of education, points out.
"Our schools are better than most
of the critics say, but they are
not as good as they should be or
must be." What then can be done?
• Increased teachers' salaries.
The American Council on Educa
tion has said that salaries should
at least be doubled.
• Improved teacher prepara
tion. A re-evaluation is needed
here on the amount and kind of
professional and academic train
ing needed and the proper combi
nation of both.
• College placement programs,
in which high school pupils take
college-level courses in literature,
history, languages, mathematics
and science. They enter college
with advanced standing and, in
some cases, with credit toward a
degree. Stanford began such a
system two years ago. Director j
of Admissions Rixford K. Snyder
says that schools qualifying so
far have been mostly eastern prep
schools and large metropolitan
public schools.
• More serious attitudes on the
part of both students and parents.
• Greater course continuity, es
pecially in languages and science.
Here students drop languages aft
er an average of two years. In
Europe they take five or six years
or more.

• More flexible approach to
school organization. Allot school
time according to the difficulty or
importance of the course. One
course may need 30 minutes oirly
once or 1 twice a week, while an
other should be given two hours
four or five times a week.
• Improved guidance programs
to make sure that each student
and his parents are informed of
his capabilities and the opportu
nities open to him.
These changes can be made
with a minimum of time and ex
pense. A more radical proposal
is Ihat of reducing the number of
years of college or high school
education for those students able
to handle an accelerated program.
Specialization
Adherents of this plan point to
the increasing specialization of
skills required in the various pro
fessions, the military service that
takes two years from a student's
program, tire increasing cost of
education and the rising number
of undergraduate and graduate
marriages. Three-year programs
also would lessen overcrowding in
the schools.
But in any event, the spotlight
of public opinion has been thrown
on the school system, and there it
will stay until the public is cer
tain that necessary changes and
improvements have been made.
"Society usually gets what it
wants," Snyder said in comment

the attacks on the public schools.
However, the United States is

INDIVIDUAL THINKING AND ANALYSIS STIMULATED IN HIGH SCHOOL DISCUSSION
Menlo-Atherton seniors hold a round-table discussion about the tragic theme in Shakespeare's "Mac
beth" during an English class
Two contradictory headlines ap
peared on the same page in the
March 30 issue of the New York
Times.
"Education in U.S. Called Su
perior" read the first, and in an
adjoining column appeared "Na
tion's Schools Termed Scandal."
This confusion of charges and
counter-charges during the past
few months is part and parcel of
the most agonizing reappraisal
directed at the U.S. educational
system since the first little red
schoolhouse was erected in the
Colonies.
Death and Taxes
Like death and taxes, criticism
of the school system is something
we have always with us. Criti
cism and reappraisal of our sec
ondary schools is of vital concern,
for the schools must give students
a good foundation in basic sub
jects if Stanford and other uni
versities are to do the educational
job needed and expected of them.
With the appearance of the
first Russian Sputnik over U.S.
territory, the critics launched an
all-out, bitter attack on the
schools.
The "average" Soviet student
and the "average" American stu
dent were compared as to moti
vation, achievement and the con
tent of courses they take—with
the kids from the U.S.A. not even
running a good second.
Sputnik Jolt
As always when the public re
ceives a jolt like the Sputnik
launching, public opinion is apt
to become a little hysterical with
arguments buttressed by incom
plete or incorrect facts.
The headlines in the New York
Times were contradictory because
their sources were talking about
two different things. Even now,
months after the Soviet coup, crit
ics and defenders are still not
arguing on the same grounds.
For one thing, no adequate com
parison can be made of the two
school systems. In Russia, only

17 per cent of the students are in
high school — and these take a
standard, narrow curriculum with
no electives.
Dr. Paul Dell. Hurd, associate
professor of education, says, "If
we took the top 17 per cent of our
high school students and com
pared them w i th Russian stu
dents, we'd be right along with
them."
To understand the difference
between our educational system
and that in Russia or elsewhere
in Europe, we must examine the
basic premises that underlie the
U.S. concept of education.
Narrow Elite
In the 19th century, and still
today in Europe, secondary edu
cation was for a narrow elite who
were destined for the universities
and professions. One standard
curriculum was suitable for all
st u dents.
But the American people, em
barked on the great democratic
experiment, decided they could
not govern themselves adequately
or well without advanced educa
tion.
The limiting of education to a
small minority was repugnant to
their concepts, and free public ed
ucation for everyone became a
right and finally a duty.
Comprehensive High School
Thus developed our concept of
the "comprehensive" high school,
the institution that had to under
take the training of Mary Jones
for marriage and motherhood,
Martha Shith for a stenographic
position in a downtown office, Joe
131ake for the job in Harry's Ga
rage, and John Brown who would
go on to college and study law or
medicine.
The dull and the bright, the rich
and the poor, met in the same
classrooms.
And the schools found them
selves faced with the impossible
job of being everything to every
body and often succeeding only in
being inadequate for everyone. A
flood of teen-aged youngsters con

verged on the schools.
Lack of money prevented the
expansion of overcrowded build
ings and the purchase of up-to
date equipment. The poorly paid
teaching profession was not at
tractive enough to obtain the
needed share of college graduates
for the overflowing classrooms.
This was the situation until re
cent years. It still persists in
many areas. But due to the ef
forts of farsighted teachers, par
ents and community leaders, ef
forts have been and are continu
ally being made to completely re
vamp our concepts of secondary

But the American people, em
barked on the great democratic
experiment, decided they could
not govern themselves adequately
or well without advanced educa
tion.
The limiting of education to a
small minority was repugnant to
their concepts, and free public ed
ucation for everyone became a
right and finally a duty.
Comprehensive High School
Thus developed our concept of
the "comprehensive" high school,
the institution that had to under
take the training of Mary Jones
for marriage and motherhood,
Martha Shith for a stenographic
position in a downtown office, Joe
131ake for the job in Harry's Ga
rage, and John Brown who would
go on to college and study law or
medicine.
The dull and the bright, the rich
and the poor, met in the same
classrooms.
And the schools found them
selves faced with the impossible
job of being everything to every
body and often succeeding only in
being inadequate for everyone. A
flood of teen-aged youngsters con

verged on the schools.
Lack of money prevented the
expansion of overcrowded build
ings and the purchase of up-to
date equipment. The poorly paid
teaching profession was not at
tractive enough to obtain the
needed share of college graduates
for the overflowing classrooms.
This was the situation until re
cent years. It still persists in
many areas. But due to the ef
forts of farsighted teachers, par
ents and community leaders, ef
forts have been and are continu
ally being made to completely re
vamp our concepts of secondary
education.
Brighter Student
The most obvious defect of the
old system was the neglect of the
brighter student, who remained
unmotivated by the classes gear
ed to the average intellect, and
often lost interest in higher edu
cation.
To prevent this i disastrous
waste of the nation's potential
brain power, more and more
schools introduced "split-level"
classes, in which students were
placed with others of their own
achievement level.
Honors Programs
But honors programs require a
large and well-trained staff and
are difficult to establish in small
er schools, whore one man may be
responsible for an entire science
department. Accordingly, a school
consolidation movement has gath
ered momentum in the past few
years.
Parents and educators have
come to realize that the small
school is expensive to run, that
the students (contrary to popular
opinion) do not get the individual
attention or the high caliber of

instruction of the metropolitan
high schools.
This consolidation also has
proven expensive. Free transpor
tation over large distances must
be provided in some of the more
sparsely populated areas. Many
educators feel that federal aid to
education is the answer to the
initial expense.
But the problems are far from
solved. As Dr. Robert N. Bush,
professor of education, points out.
"Our schools are better than most
of the critics say, but they are
not as good as they should be or
must be." What then can be done?
• Increased teachers' salaries.
The American Council on Educa
tion has said that salaries should
at least be doubled.
• Improved teacher prepara
tion. A re-evaluation is needed
here on the amount and kind of
professional and academic train
ing needed and the proper combi
nation of both.
• College placement programs,
in which high school pupils take
college-level courses in literature,
history, languages, mathematics
and science. They enter college
with advanced standing and, in
some cases, with credit toward a
degree. Stanford began such a
system two years ago. Director j
of Admissions Rixford K. Snyder
says that schools qualifying so
far have been mostly eastern prep
schools and large metropolitan
public schools.
• More serious attitudes on the
part of both students and parents.
• Greater course continuity, es
pecially in languages and science.
Here students drop languages aft
er an average of two years. In
Europe they take five or six years
or more.

• More flexible approach to
school organization. Allot school
time according to the difficulty or
importance of the course. One
course may need 30 minutes oirly
once or 1 twice a week, while an
other should be given two hours
four or five times a week.
• Improved guidance programs
to make sure that each student
and his parents are informed of
his capabilities and the opportu
nities open to him.
These changes can be made
with a minimum of time and ex
pense. A more radical proposal
is Ihat of reducing the number of
years of college or high school
education for those students able
to handle an accelerated program.
Specialization
Adherents of this plan point to
the increasing specialization of
skills required in the various pro
fessions, the military service that
takes two years from a student's
program, tire increasing cost of
education and the rising number
of undergraduate and graduate
marriages. Three-year programs
also would lessen overcrowding in
the schools.
But in any event, the spotlight
of public opinion has been thrown
on the school system, and there it
will stay until the public is cer
tain that necessary changes and
improvements have been made.
"Society usually gets what it
wants," Snyder said in comment
ing on the unfairness of many of
the attacks on the public schools.
However, the United States is
not alone in searching for the an
swer to the educational dilemma.
Last'month Nikila Khrushchev
called for a major revision to
broaden the Soviet educational
system.

INDIVIDUAL THINKING AND ANALYSIS STIMULATED IN HIGH SCHOOL DISCUSSION
Menlo-Atherton seniors hold a round-table discussion about the tragic theme in Shakespeare's "Mac
beth" during an English class
Two contradictory headlines ap
peared on the same page in the
March 30 issue of the New York
Times.
"Education in U.S. Called Su
perior" read the first, and in an
adjoining column appeared "Na
tion's Schools Termed Scandal."
This confusion of charges and
counter-charges during the past
few months is part and parcel of
the most agonizing reappraisal
directed at the U.S. educational
system since the first little red
schoolhouse was erected in the
Colonies.
Death and Taxes
Like death and taxes, criticism
of the school system is something
we have always with us. Criti
cism and reappraisal of our sec
ondary schools is of vital concern,
for the schools must give students
a good foundation in basic sub
jects if Stanford and other uni
versities are to do the educational
job needed and expected of them.
With the appearance of the
first Russian Sputnik over U.S.
territory, the critics launched an
all-out, bitter attack on the
schools.
The "average" Soviet student
and the "average" American stu
dent were compared as to moti
vation, achievement and the con
tent of courses they take—with
the kids from the U.S.A. not even
running a good second.
Sputnik Jolt
As always when the public re
ceives a jolt like the Sputnik
launching, public opinion is apt
to become a little hysterical with
arguments buttressed by incom
plete or incorrect facts.
The headlines in the New York
Times were contradictory because
their sources were talking about
two different things. Even now,
months after the Soviet coup, crit
ics and defenders are still not
arguing on the same grounds.
For one thing, no adequate com
parison can be made of the two
school systems. In Russia, only

17 per cent of the students are in
high school — and these take a
standard, narrow curriculum with
no electives.
Dr. Paul Dell. Hurd, associate
professor of education, says, "If
we took the top 17 per cent of our
high school students and com
pared them w i th Russian stu
dents, we'd be right along with
them."
To understand the difference
between our educational system
and that in Russia or elsewhere
in Europe, we must examine the
basic premises that underlie the
U.S. concept of education.
Narrow Elite
In the 19th century, and still
today in Europe, secondary edu
cation was for a narrow elite who
were destined for the universities
and professions. One standard
curriculum was suitable for all
st u dents.
But the American people, em
barked on the great democratic
experiment, decided they could
not govern themselves adequately
or well without advanced educa
tion.
The limiting of education to a
small minority was repugnant to
their concepts, and free public ed
ucation for everyone became a
right and finally a duty.
Comprehensive High School
Thus developed our concept of
the "comprehensive" high school,
the institution that had to under
take the training of Mary Jones
for marriage and motherhood,
Martha Shith for a stenographic
position in a downtown office, Joe
131ake for the job in Harry's Ga
rage, and John Brown who would
go on to college and study law or
medicine.
The dull and the bright, the rich
and the poor, met in the same
classrooms.
And the schools found them
selves faced with the impossible
job of being everything to every
body and often succeeding only in
being inadequate for everyone. A
flood of teen-aged youngsters con

verged on the schools.
Lack of money prevented the
expansion of overcrowded build
ings and the purchase of up-to
date equipment. The poorly paid
teaching profession was not at

for the overflowing classrooms.
