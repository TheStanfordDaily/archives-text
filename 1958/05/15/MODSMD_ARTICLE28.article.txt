# SIBLEY DISCUSSION
## Good Balance Needed For Teaching, Research 
### Wally Simpson 
(Editor's Note: This is the
third in a series of articles cov
ering a panel discussion held
last Monday between students
and faculty members on the
question of research versus
teaching as criteria for faculty
appointments, using the non-ap
pointment of Professor Mulford
Q. Sibley as a specific example.)
Dr. Merrill K. Bennett, chair
man of the president's board of
advisers, explained one reason
why a teacher should also be a
publisher:
"It is a matter of looking for
ward a good many years toward
the structure of the department.
One point to be considered is the
aims of a great university. It is a
place where younger men will
come. For them, teaching is not
the main thing."
Professor Robert A. Walker of
fered: "I have been involved, one
way or another, in three cases in
(he last year' in which the promo
tions were based very largely on
contribution to teaching. This is
so m e th in g very much in the
minds of all of us.
Separate Functions
"There have been some instil u
tions that have tried to separate
these functions- teaching and re
search.
"The University of Chicago
placed the function of teaching
primarily in the college. The divi
sions were to carry on the ad
vanced study. One of the conse
quences of this was that it, be
came increasingly difficult for
Chicago to handle this, because
men were not attracted to teach
ing in situations in which they
were separated from graduate
students.
"When you have a situation
such as we have here, where ap
pointments are initiated by de
partments, it becomes a constant
problem of achieving balance in
this. We have this particularly in
a university like Stanford, where
we do not separate the faculties."
Graduate student Ben Heirs
asked Walker, "Do you feel that
in our department | Political Sci
ence! scales have been tipped too
much to teaching and not enough
to research?"
Walker replied by saying. "I do

feci that in the field of political
theory there is a definite need for
basic analytical research."
Heirs then said: "As a case
study, since research is definitely
an issue before us, compare Dr.
Hans Eulaus' publication record
with Mr. Sibley's. Eulaus is edi
tor of one book in which appears
one article by him which also ap
peared in a journal. This is his
only article since 1941. Yet Eulaus
had no trouble getting an
ment."
The Administration's comment
on this was off the record. (Eu
laus was recently appointed pro
fessor of politics by the Univer
sity. His appointment was initiat
ed by the department about the
same time as was Sibley's.)
Brouse Comments
A1 Brouse continued on the
theme introduced by Walker on
the difference between the quali
tie-s needed in a professor for
graduates and for undergradu
ates. He commented: "The un
dergraduate comes to a university
because of the reputation of the
university, and he usually doesn't
even know what he is going to
major in.
"The graduate comes because
he knows the people or a person
in that department, because that
person has published something.
To this extent there is a differ
ence between the undergraduate
and the graduate teacher."
English professor John Dodds
answered: "The really good un
dergraduate teacher has some re
spect for the validity of his own
thinking, and ho likes to see that
tested. I do not make a sharp line
of distinction between undergrad
uate and graduate."

Brouse Comments
A1 Brouse continued on the
theme introduced by Walker on
the difference between the quali
tie-s needed in a professor for
graduates and for undergradu
ates. He commented: "The un
dergraduate comes to a university
because of the reputation of the
university, and he usually doesn't
even know what he is going to
major in.
"The graduate comes because
he knows the people or a person
in that department, because that
person has published something.
To this extent there is a differ
ence between the undergraduate
and the graduate teacher."
English professor John Dodds
answered: "The really good un
dergraduate teacher has some re
spect for the validity of his own
thinking, and ho likes to see that
tested. I do not make a sharp line
of distinction between undergrad
uate and graduate."

last Monday between students
and faculty members on the
question of research versus
teaching as criteria for faculty
appointments, using the non-ap
pointment of Professor Mulford
Q. Sibley as a specific example.)
Dr. Merrill K. Bennett, chair
man of the president's board of
advisers, explained one reason
why a teacher should also be a
publisher:
"It is a matter of looking for
ward a good many years toward
the structure of the department.
One point to be considered is the
aims of a great university. It is a
place where younger men will
come. For them, teaching is not
the main thing."
Professor Robert A. Walker of
fered: "I have been involved, one
way or another, in three cases in
(he last year' in which the promo
tions were based very largely on
contribution to teaching. This is
so m e th in g very much in the
minds of all of us.
Separate Functions
"There have been some instil u
tions that have tried to separate
these functions- teaching and re
search.
"The University of Chicago
placed the function of teaching
primarily in the college. The divi
sions were to carry on the ad
vanced study. One of the conse
quences of this was that it, be
came increasingly difficult for
Chicago to handle this, because
men were not attracted to teach
ing in situations in which they
were separated from graduate
students.
"When you have a situation
such as we have here, where ap
pointments are initiated by de
partments, it becomes a constant
problem of achieving balance in
this. We have this particularly in
a university like Stanford, where
we do not separate the faculties."
Graduate student Ben Heirs
asked Walker, "Do you feel that
in our department | Political Sci
ence! scales have been tipped too
much to teaching and not enough
to research?"
Walker replied by saying. "I do

feci that in the field of political
theory there is a definite need for
basic analytical research."
Heirs then said: "As a case
study, since research is definitely
an issue before us, compare Dr.
Hans Eulaus' publication record
