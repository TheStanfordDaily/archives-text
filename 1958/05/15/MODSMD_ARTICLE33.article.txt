# Indians, Bears Prepare For Weekend's Big Race
## 
### 
Lou Lindsay isn't going to
stanrl pat with last week's win
ning crew combination when he
sends his varsity eight against
California Saturday at Redwood
City Yacht Harbor in the 1958 Big
Race.
Lindsay has decided to move
Roll' Peterson back to the stroke
spot he occupied last year when
the Indians placed third in the
IRA regatta at Syracuse.
Peterson's switch means that
Bob Clark, who stroked against
USC and UCLA in the Harbach
Cup last weekend, will be sent to
the number seven spot.
A Good Team
Lindsay explained that Peter
son and Clark work well as a
team, and that putting them to
gether should make it less likely
that the Indians' stroking would
unconsciously shorten.
Scott Moore, the sixth man,
moves up to the varsity after a
stint as number seven in the JV
boat. Mike Graf and Roald En
gebreth will remain at their five
and four spots respectively.
Dick Draeger, the third man in
last year's IRA shell, will again
man the number three position.
John Reichmann moves from six
up to two, while Paul Dougan
stays at bow. Co-captain Randy
Jones will again cox for the In
dians.
Shorter Squad
The new alignment will aver
age 185 pounds and 6-2%, just %
of an inch shorter than last
week's eight.
The crew will have one more
addition for the Big Race- a new
pair of shells which arrived late
last week. These, along with the
two-year Redwood Warrior, will
put all three Stanford crews in
grade A shells.
Saturday's varsity and junior
varsity races will be rowed oyer
a three-mile course, with the
frosh race two miles in length.
