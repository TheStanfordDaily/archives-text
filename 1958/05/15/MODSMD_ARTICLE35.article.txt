# Only Locals to Compete For PAAAU Track Titles
## 
### 
The purest of all Pacific Asso
ciation AAU track and field meets
will be held Saturday at 1:15 on
the Burlingame High School
track. Twenty Stanford men will
enter the competition.
In past years, athletes from any
AAU association have been allow
ed to compete, with the result that
the best men from the local sec
tion have sometimes been able to
get only fourth or fifth place.
This year officials decided to let
the meet be a true area one. As a
result, only Pacific Association
members can compete.
Competition still promises to be
strong, however, w i 1 h top run
ners, throwers and jumpers from
the Santa Clara Youth Village,
Olympic Club, San Jose State,
California and other area clubs
and schools joining with the In
dians.
Bowden's Big One
This meet was held at Stockton
last year, and it was there that
Don Bovvden ran his 3:58.7 mileâ€”
the only time an American has
gone under four minutes.
Most of Pay ton Jordan's top
men will compete, with the excep
tion of three of the four who will
run in tomorrow night's Coliseum
Relays.
Headlining the non-Stanford en
tries will be shot-putter Bill Nei
der of the Presidio and sprinter
Ray Norton of San Jose State.
Neider, the second greatest man
in shot-put history, was over the
60-foot mark at the West Coast
Relays, although he lost to Parry
O'Brien. e
Norton is suddenly being ac
claimed as the man most likely to
run the 100 in 9.2, following his
9.3 and five 9.4's this season. Al
ways a powerful runner, Norton
has apparently gained the confi

dence and starting ability he lack
ed last year.
Mike Franchetti will be shoot
ing for Stanford's fifth school rec
ord set thus year when he goes in
the pole vault. Franchetti has
been over 14 feet twice so far and
is near the school mark of 14-1%
set in 1932 by Bill Miller.
Franchetti, standing just 5-6, is
the shortest 14-I'oot vaulter in the
country. With still another year
left at Stanford, he seems a cinch
to make the record book before
graduating.
Cunliffe in Two
Ernie Cunliffe will be the only
Indian attempting to run in both
the Coliseum and PA AAU meets.
He'll go the 880 each time.
Eyes will also he on Jerry Win
ters, who improves almost every
week out. He began the season as
a 46-foot shot-putter and is now
out to 53-11.
Several of the Indians will also
be on the spot, in that this is their
last opportunity to achieve marks
good enough to qualify for the
PCC or NCAA championship
meets. John Stabler in the pole
vault and Dick Lassen in the 440
head those in this category.
