# TROJAN POWERHOUSE
## SC Again Leads CIBA in Hitting 
### 
The University of Southern Cal
ifornia is still making a run-away
out of this year's baseball race
according to this week's CIBA
statistics. The Trojans, who have
already cinched the pennant by
winning 10 of 11 games, are also
way ahead of the league in al
most all the batting departments.
Of the eight Trojan regulars
only third-baseman Don Biasotti
is not hitting above .300. The
other seven all are in the top 15
league hitters.
SC second-baseman Mike Cas
tanon is still far ahead in the
average department with his cur
rent .417 average. The closest
pursuer to Castanon is Stanford
catcher Ralph Holding. Holding
has hit safely 18 times in 50 at
bats for a .360 average.
The only other Stanfordite
above .300 is second-sacker A 1
Shaw. Shaw is hitting at a .314
clip and besides his solid average
he also leads the league in home
runs with four.
In the pitching department SC's
Bruce Gardner is the league's f>ig
winner with four victories to his

credit. In the earned-run average,
Bruce Bandettini of California
has compiled an amazing league
leading 0.40 average. Stanford's
Bob Leopold is the league's num
ber one strike-out hurler with 44
strike-outs for the year.
Stanford's baseballers will have
this weekend off as far as CIBA
play is concerned, but all of the
other four clubs will be in action.
Tomorrow SC will meet Califor
nia at the Bears' home stadium
and on Saturday the Trojans will
play two with Santa Clara.
