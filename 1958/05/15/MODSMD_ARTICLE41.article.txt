# SC, UCLA Netters Invade
## 
### 
For all Stanford tennis fans, this weekend looms as tlie big one
of the season with the two powerhouse clubs from UCLA and USC
invading the Stanford courts to play Coach Bob Renker's Stanford
men.
On Friday afternoon the USC Trojans arrive in Palo Alto led by

ex-NCAA singles champ Alex Ol
medo. Olmedo, considered by
most as the PCC's and nation's
best collegiate netter, will have a
real struggle on his hands when
he meets Stanford's Jack Doug
las.
Olmedo Holds Lead
Earlier this month Olmedo eas
ily conquered Douglas in t he
Southern California Champion
ships and back in April licked him
at the Los Angeles Tennis Club;
but Douglas, a very strong com
petitor, will have the home court
advantage working with him
along with his usual top ground
strokes and court speed on Fri
day.
After Olmedo (JSC's lineup con
sists of Ed Atkinson, Gordon Da
vis, Jim Buck, Ed Guzman and
Ernie Follico in that order.
Atkinson, who takes on Stan
ford's Brooks Rawlins, is always
a tough competitor. He possesses
one of the best forehand volley
shots in the conference and has a
good serve to get him to the net
to use his volley. Rawlins, 'who
had a very slow start this year,
looks a lot better now and has, if
he uses them right, good enough
strokes to whip the Trojan. Raw
lins' top asset is ihe tremendous
lop spin he gets on the ball.
Tougher Foe
Dave Nelson of Stanford was
one of the only two Stanford win
ners against USC down in Los
Angeles last month but this time
out it appears that Nelson's com
petition, Gordon Davis, will be
tougher than Jim Buck, the Tro
jan Nelson mastered in Los An
geles. Davis moves to the net
faster than any of the players in
the match, and when he's on he
can keep pace with anyone. Nel
son will be relying on his real
good serve and strong wrist ac
tion to carry him through.
Jim Buck has now moved into
SC's fourth spot and will present
Stanford's Lowell Carruth with a
real problem. Buck has the con
ference's big serve and a great
volley game. Carruth could beat
the Trojan, however, if he could
force him to remain at the base

line and feed to Bucks' very weak
I ground strokes.
Jim Jeffries of Stanford will be
! out to avenge a loss he suffered
i down in Los Angeles to SC s Ed
[ Guzman. Guzman, a member of
i the Mexican Davis Cup team, is a
really tough fifth man and a top
doubles player. Jeffries will cer
tainly be out-steadied by Guzman
if he gets doublefaultitis as he
did in L.A. If he doesn't, a great
j match between the two may de
velop.
Gil White appears to be the
only Indian in for an easy day of
il wltini he tries for his second
win of the year over Ernie Fol
lico. Follico, even though he's
I lost somewhere in the neighhor
| hood of 50 pounds, is still too
! slow for Stanford's White.
Double's ( lose
In Stanford's 7-2 loss to the
Trojans in L.A. all three doubles
matches went three sets and were
finally won by the more experi
enced Trojans. Stanford's teams
of Douglas-Rawins, Carruth-Nel
son and a team consisting of ei
ther White, Hilgeman, Bowden or
Jeffries figure to once again have
close matches with SC's Olmedo-
I Atkinson, Buck - Davis and Guz-
J man-Follico duos.
Stanford's combos have now
had the needed experience and
time playing together to be at
top strength. Only last month at
Ojai a Stanford team of Jim Jef
fries and Robin Hilgeman took
SC's top duo of Olmedo and At
kinson three sets.
