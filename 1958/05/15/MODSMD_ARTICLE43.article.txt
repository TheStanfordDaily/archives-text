# Two Indians Left in State Net Tourney
## 
### 
Only Hvo Stanford netters re
mained in the California state
tournament after two of the In
dians mot with third-round losses
yesterday.
The two remaining Stanfordites
are Dave Nelson and Brooks Raw
lins. who did not see action yes
terday. Rawlins ha s n't played
since Monday, when he moved
through two rounds. Nelson's last
match was with Bobby Si-ska on
Tuesday, when Nelson trimmed
the 15-year-old in straight sets.
Yesterday Stanford's Dick Og
den and Lowell Carruth were de
feated by two of the tourney's top
seeds. Ogden had the misfortune
of having to meet highly ranked
Tom Brown. Brown, the tourney's
No. 1 seed, breezed by the Stan
ford freshman ace by a 6-2. 6-1
score.
Carruth also met up with a
highly ranked netter in Noel
Brown. Brown, who a few years
back was reinstated to the ama
teur ranks after a pro fling, top
ped Stanford's Carruth, 6-3, 6-1.
In doubles play Stanford also
met with a very bad day. Early
in the afternoon the freshman
team of Ogden and Norm Karns
was wiped out by Siska and Stan
Vickery, 10-8, 6-0.
The question now remains what
will happen if Nelson and Raw
lins remain in the tourney until
tomorrow, when they're schedul
ed to play in a team match against
USC. Most probably, if the two
do survive until then, they will be
forced to default their matches.

since Monday, when he moved
through two rounds. Nelson's last
match was with Bobby Si-ska on
Tuesday, when Nelson trimmed
the 15-year-old in straight sets.
Yesterday Stanford's Dick Og
den and Lowell Carruth were de
feated by two of the tourney's top
seeds. Ogden had the misfortune
of having to meet highly ranked
Tom Brown. Brown, the tourney's
No. 1 seed, breezed by the Stan
ford freshman ace by a 6-2. 6-1
score.
Carruth also met up with a
highly ranked netter in Noel
Brown. Brown, who a few years
back was reinstated to the ama
teur ranks after a pro fling, top
ped Stanford's Carruth, 6-3, 6-1.
In doubles play Stanford also
met with a very bad day. Early
in the afternoon the freshman
team of Ogden and Norm Karns
was wiped out by Siska and Stan
Vickery, 10-8, 6-0.
The question now remains what
will happen if Nelson and Raw
lins remain in the tourney until
tomorrow, when they're schedul
ed to play in a team match against
USC. Most probably, if the two
do survive until then, they will be
forced to default their matches.
Yesterday's Stanford results
were as follows:
Singles: Noel Brown <1. Low
ell Carruth (S), 6-3, 6-4; Tom
Brown <1. Dick Ogden (S), 6-2,
