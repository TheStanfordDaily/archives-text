# Gridders In Spring Tilt
## 
### 
Sid Garber and Bob Nicolet will
bo a I the quarterback helms when
the Stanford Reds and Whites
clash in the final football scrim
mage of the spring. Saturday at
2:30 in the stadium.
The game-condition scrimmage
will put the finishing touches on
four weeks of spring drills for the
Indians. Admission will be free.
The public address system will be
in operation, and free programs,
complete with the five-year foot
ball schedule, will be distributed.
Coach Jack Curtice, nearly fin
ished with his first long look at
a Stanford squad, has thus far
been reasonably satisfied. He had
to start from scratch in putting
his version of the spread-T into
action, but the progress has been
relatively good.
The biggest worries he will
carry over to fall practice concern
what he feels is a lack of depth
at tackle and end. Curtice has ap
parently solved the guard problem
by shifting two of his centers.
