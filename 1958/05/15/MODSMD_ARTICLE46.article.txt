# Stanford Favored to Whip Cal Swimmers
## 
### 
Varsity swimmers will be look
ing for the 35th consecutive vic
tory over the Golden Rears from
California tomorrow afternoon in
the local pool at 3:30. A 50-cent
admission charge will be made to
students for this Big Meet and
the last dual competition for the
mermen this season.
Freshmen will take on Cal's
Cubs at the same time with the
races being run intermittently.
The Cal yearlings should offer
little resistance to the Papooses
as the locals romped over them
59-26, April 2(5. The varsity did
likewise over the Bears, 59-27.
Ret-ords to Fall
Three records are in line to be
broken by the locals. In the var
sity Tom Peterson will be out to
break a 2:24.G National Intercol
legiate record in the 200-yard
breaststroke set by John Modine
of Michigan State last year. "And
he should do it!" exclaimed In
dian mentor Tom Haynie.
In the frosh ranks Haynie will
be sending his medley relay squad
after a National Inlercollegiate
freshman record. AAU champ
George Cooper, breaststroke, and
Mike Zeller, freestyle, set the
present record of 3:55.2 April 18.
They should have an easy job of
breaking their record as they
were actually off the pace when
they set it.
Zeller, Jurgensen, Harrison and
Charlie Raven will also attempt
to set a new Stanford-Cal fresh
man meet record in the freestyle
relay.

The varsity is loaded with
depth and should have a field
day dumping California. Sparker
Robin Moore, freestyle specialist
who can do everything well, will
churn up the 100 and 220. Back
strokers Wayne Mehl and Bruce
Hamilton and breast strokers Tom
Peterson and Bill Fuller should
gain victories. Diver. Bob Kahn
will be out to avenge a 171.9-
point tie with Cal diver Paul Ooo
jian.
Jim Muir will back up Moore in
the 220 and swim the 440 free.
Denny Stimson and Hank Caffe
rata will swim the 50 free. Hank
Fourcade will back up Moore in
the 200 back.
A new group of swimmers will
bo churning up the relays. Mike
Wong, Steve Jackson, Stimson
and Cafferata will swim the 400-
yard freestyle relay and Hamil
ton, Gary Weaver, Johnson Gibbs
and Bruce Lenartz will be Stan
ford entries in the medley relay.
Little Cal Opposition
Only formidable Cal opposition
will be found in Kirk Bathgate,
Jim Small, Terry Tognazzini and
Chuck Halloway. Bathgate should
be second to Morroe in the 100
freestyle. Jim Small, however,
should not be cast aside so easily
as he will definitely win the 440
as he did in 4:55.2 over Muir last
month. He should also grab a
second in Ihe 220 free and third
in the 200 fly. Tognazzini will
have a sure victory in the back
stroke and Halloway may win the
200 breast.

as he will definitely win the 440
as he did in 4:55.2 over Muir last
month. He should also grab a
second in Ihe 220 free and third
in the 200 fly. Tognazzini will
have a sure victory in the back
stroke and Halloway may win the
200 breast.
Varsity swimmers will be look
ing for the 35th consecutive vic
tory over the Golden Rears from
California tomorrow afternoon in
the local pool at 3:30. A 50-cent
admission charge will be made to
students for this Big Meet and
the last dual competition for the
mermen this season.
Freshmen will take on Cal's
Cubs at the same time with the
races being run intermittently.
The Cal yearlings should offer
little resistance to the Papooses
as the locals romped over them
59-26, April 2(5. The varsity did
likewise over the Bears, 59-27.
Ret-ords to Fall
Three records are in line to be
broken by the locals. In the var
sity Tom Peterson will be out to
break a 2:24.G National Intercol
legiate record in the 200-yard
breaststroke set by John Modine
of Michigan State last year. "And
he should do it!" exclaimed In
dian mentor Tom Haynie.
In the frosh ranks Haynie will
be sending his medley relay squad
after a National Inlercollegiate
freshman record. AAU champ
George Cooper, breaststroke, and
Mike Zeller, freestyle, set the
present record of 3:55.2 April 18.
They should have an easy job of
breaking their record as they
were actually off the pace when
they set it.
Zeller, Jurgensen, Harrison and
Charlie Raven will also attempt
to set a new Stanford-Cal fresh
man meet record in the freestyle
relay.

The varsity is loaded with
depth and should have a field
day dumping California. Sparker
Robin Moore, freestyle specialist
who can do everything well, will
churn up the 100 and 220. Back
strokers Wayne Mehl and Bruce
Hamilton and breast strokers Tom
Peterson and Bill Fuller should
gain victories. Diver. Bob Kahn
will be out to avenge a 171.9-
point tie with Cal diver Paul Ooo
jian.
Jim Muir will back up Moore in
the 220 and swim the 440 free.
Denny Stimson and Hank Caffe
rata will swim the 50 free. Hank
Fourcade will back up Moore in
the 200 back.
A new group of swimmers will
bo churning up the relays. Mike
Wong, Steve Jackson, Stimson
and Cafferata will swim the 400-
yard freestyle relay and Hamil
ton, Gary Weaver, Johnson Gibbs
and Bruce Lenartz will be Stan
ford entries in the medley relay.
Little Cal Opposition
Only formidable Cal opposition
will be found in Kirk Bathgate,
Jim Small, Terry Tognazzini and
Chuck Halloway. Bathgate should
be second to Morroe in the 100
freestyle. Jim Small, however,
should not be cast aside so easily
as he will definitely win the 440
as he did in 4:55.2 over Muir last
month. He should also grab a
second in Ihe 220 free and third
in the 200 fly. Tognazzini will
