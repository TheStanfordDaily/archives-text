## 
### 
SAN JOSE (A') Gov. Goodwin
J. Knight said here yesterday the
South American attacks on Vice
President Nixon, a fellow Califor
nian, arc a shocking insult to the
United States.
He suggested that the attacks
had rehdered obsolete the foreign
aid program.
Continuing his formal state
ment, Governor Knight said:
"These unprovoked assaults
upon our flag and prestige, to
gether with the violent anti-Amer
ican demonstrations in Lebanon
and Algeria, demonstrate to me
that our national policies on for
eign aid—indeed the whole con
cept of foreign aid—must be re
thought and drastically altered.
"If nothing else, the outrageous
events of the last few days have
taught us we can't buy friendship
with money.
"I believe that, in the future,
proposals for foreign aid must be
examined country by country on
the basis of the merits of each
case. Certainly no one can dispute
the accomplishments of some past
programs, such as our assistance
to the gallant people of Greece
and Turkey to enable them to de
fend themselves from Communist
encroachment."
In Washington, President Ei
senhower yesterday blamed the
a n t i - Nixon demonstrations in
South America on economic diffi
culties, envy of the United States
—and probable Communist agita
tion.
Eisenhower told a news confer
ence he'd like to do something
special for Nixon on the Vice
President's return to the capital
today—because he admires Nix
on's "calmness and fortitude and
his courage" under mob attack.
