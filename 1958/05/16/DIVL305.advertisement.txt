THE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS
Today in this age of technology when engineering graduates are
wooed and courted by all of America's great industries, how do
you account for the fact that Rimbaud Sigafoos, who finished
at the very top of his class at turned down hundreds of
attractive job offers to accept employment as a machinery
wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of $20 a week with
a twelve-hour day, a seven-day week, and only fifteen minutes
for lunch?

T know what you are thinking: "Chcrchez In frmme/" You are
thinking that Mr. Acme, head of the Acme Ice Company, has
a beautiful daughter with whom Rimbaud is madly in love and
he took the job only to be near her.
Friends, you are wrong. It is true that Mr. Acme does have
a daughter, a large, torpid lass named Clavdia who spends all
her waking hours scooping marzipan out of a bucket and staring
at a television set which has not worked in some years. Rim
baud has not the slightest interest in Clavdia; nor, indeed, does
any other man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.
So how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme Ice Com
pany? Can it be that they provide him with free Marlboro
Cigarettes, and all day long he enjoys that filter, that flavor,
that flip-top box?
No, friends, no. Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on the job,
and when he finishes his long, miserable day, he has to buy his
own Marlboros, even as you and I, in order to enjoy that
estimable filter, that incomparable flavor, that crazy flip-top box.
Well, friends, you might as well give up because you'll never
in a million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Acme Ice
Company. The reason is simply this: Rimbaud us a seal!
He started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One night on
the way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway.
All night the poor mammal rode the 8.M.T., seeking a helping
hand. Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson
Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.
He took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and
Rimbaud, to show his appreciation, studied hard and got ex
cellent marks and finished a distinguished academic career as
valedictorian of M.I.T.
Rimbaud never complained to his kindly foster father, but
through all those years of grammar school and high school and
college, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must remem
ber, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you can imagine
how poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical New York
and Boston, especially in those tight Ivy League suits.
But today at the Acme Ice Company, Rimbaud has finally
found a temperature to his liking, lie is very happy and sends
greetings to his many friends.
