# Russia Orbits Third Sputnik; Heaviest Yet
## 
### 
MOSCOW (/P> Russia fired its third Sputnik into orbit yesterday,
a I '/is-ton, cone-shaped monster far heavier than any of the five satel
lites hitherto launched by man.
In a Kremlin speech taunting U.S. science, Premier N'ikita Khrush
chev implied the West now must come to terms with Moscow, al-

though the Soviet Union did not
want to use Sputnik 111 to "harm
humanity or to blackmail the
world."
Khrushchev appeared to be re
ferring to the possible military
implications of a rocket powerful
enough to propel ponderous Sput
nik 111 into space. It is more than
twice as heavy as Sputnik 11, the
largest satellite launched previ
ously.
Khrushchev told his Kremlin
audience, which included visiting
President Nasser of the United
Arab Republic he did not want to
belittle U.S. achievements but "it
would take a lot of orange-sized
sputniks to compare with ours."
Stop Scare
"We must stop scaring each
other," Khrushchev declared, and
in obvious reference to an East-
West summit conference added:
"We must sit down at the same
table and talk about how we can
live together in peace on our com
mon planet."
Sputnik 111 joins three small
U.S. satellites and ends a month
long space famine for Soviet sci
entists. They have had no satel
lite aloft since Sputnik II dipped
into the earth's dense lower at
mosphere April 14 and burned
out in the Caribbean.
Visible
Whirling about the earth once
every 106 minutes at a maximum
altitude of 1168 miles, Sputnik 111
should be visible to the unaided
eye in the rays of the rising and
setting sun, an official Tass an
nouncement said.
The rocket that sent it aloft
also went into orbit close behind
and presumably also will be vis
ible. No information was given
on the rocket's size, but it must
have been a big one. Tass said
nothing about a living passenger
on Sputnik 111. Sputnik II car
ried Laika, the dog.
Biggest Vet
The offiical statistics on Sput
nik 111 are: gross weight, 2925.53
pounds; instrument weight, 2133
pounds; length, 11 feet BVs inch
es; diameter at base, 5 feet 8
inches; angle of orbit, 65 degrees
from the equator.
The weight compares with 1120
pounds reported for cone-shaped
Sputnik 11, 184 pounds for spheri
cal Sputnik I, and 31 pounds for
Explorer 111, heaviest of the U.S.
satellites.
Moscow Radio said the Sputnik
is traveling from southwest to
northeast. Its announced angle
from the plane of the equator
means it will cover most of the
inhabited areas of the earth.
