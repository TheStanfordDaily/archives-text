# Crew Seeks 4th In Row Over Cal
## 
### 
A fourth consecutive Big Race victory will he Stanford's goal when
the Indian crew tangles with California Saturday at 11:30 in the
Redwood City Yacht Harbor. A junior varsity race at 10:10 and a
frosh race at 10:50 will precede the three-mile varsity encounter.

coach Ky Ebright thought his
sophomore - laden crew did v/ell

More Changes
After apparently deciding on
his starting eight, Lindsay came
up with more last - minute
changes. He shifted Bob Clark
back to the stroke position, and
put in Jamie Clever at seven.
Scott Moore was moved over to
six, and Pete LeSourd came up to
the varsity shell at number four.
The Indians may be strength

equipment.
California leads the Big Race
series, 18 wins to 11. The Bears
won the first four races in 1902-
05. Stanford had a hot string
from 19(17 through 1915, winning
eight of nine.
Long Break
Cal won the next four, until
crew was discontinued at Stan
ford in 1921. The Bears won the
