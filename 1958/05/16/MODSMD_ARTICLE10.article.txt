# Crew Seeks 4th In Row Over Cal
## 
### 
A fourth consecutive Big Race victory will he Stanford's goal when
the Indian crew tangles with California Saturday at 11:30 in the
Redwood City Yacht Harbor. A junior varsity race at 10:10 and a
frosh race at 10:50 will precede the three-mile varsity encounter.
Stanford coach Lou Lindsay says"It looks like we have a better

chance than Cal to win," and the
recent record bears him out.
Two weeks ago, the Cal eight
had to fight all the way to nose
out USC in a race at San Pedro
Yacht Harbor. Last week, the In
dians had an easy time gaining a
four-length victory over the same
Trojans.
Cal also didn't show too much
in losing to powerful Washing'
ton by 4Va lengths, although
coach Ky Ebright thought his
sophomore - laden crew did v/ell
considering their opposition.
More Changes
After apparently deciding on
his starting eight, Lindsay came
up with more last - minute
changes. He shifted Bob Clark
back to the stroke position, and
put in Jamie Clever at seven.
Scott Moore was moved over to
six, and Pete LeSourd came up to
the varsity shell at number four.
The Indians may be strength
ened. at least psychologically, by
rowing in new shells received last
week. All three boatings will
now be able to use the best in
equipment.
California leads the Big Race
series, 18 wins to 11. The Bears
won the first four races in 1902-
05. Stanford had a hot string
from 19(17 through 1915, winning
eight of nine.
Long Break
Cal won the next four, until
crew was discontinued at Stan
ford in 1921. The Bears won the
1943 race, then the series was re
newed on a yearly basis in 1947.
California kept right on win
ning through 1954, but then the
title changed. Stanford swept to
a 2%-length victory in Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor, and has won the
past two races on the Oakland Es
tuary.
Last year's event, however,
was a near - fiasco as fireboats
raced across the paths of the
crews, nearly swamping both
shells. Tomorrow's will be the
first Big Race ever to be held at
Redwood City.

chance than Cal to win," and the
recent record bears him out.
Two weeks ago, the Cal eight
had to fight all the way to nose
out USC in a race at San Pedro
Yacht Harbor. Last week, the In
dians had an easy time gaining a
four-length victory over the same
Trojans.
Cal also didn't show too much
in losing to powerful Washing'
ton by 4Va lengths, although
coach Ky Ebright thought his
sophomore - laden crew did v/ell
considering their opposition.
More Changes
After apparently deciding on
his starting eight, Lindsay came
up with more last - minute
changes. He shifted Bob Clark
back to the stroke position, and
put in Jamie Clever at seven.
Scott Moore was moved over to
six, and Pete LeSourd came up to
the varsity shell at number four.
The Indians may be strength
ened. at least psychologically, by
rowing in new shells received last
week. All three boatings will
now be able to use the best in
equipment.
California leads the Big Race
series, 18 wins to 11. The Bears
won the first four races in 1902-
05. Stanford had a hot string
from 19(17 through 1915, winning
eight of nine.
Long Break
Cal won the next four, until
crew was discontinued at Stan
ford in 1921. The Bears won the
1943 race, then the series was re
newed on a yearly basis in 1947.
California kept right on win
ning through 1954, but then the
title changed. Stanford swept to
a 2%-length victory in Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor, and has won the
past two races on the Oakland Es
tuary.
Last year's event, however,
was a near - fiasco as fireboats
raced across the paths of the
crews, nearly swamping both
shells. Tomorrow's will be the
first Big Race ever to be held at
Redwood City.
