Editor, The Daily:
When I saw Professor Sibley among his stu
dents demonstrating against H-bomb tests I
wrote to my friends in Florence:
"A well-known professor of the Department
of Political Science was among his students in a
demonstration. We have to go back to 1848 to
see something like that in Italy. Our professors
are much more like the philosopher who was
described by Aristophanes in his play, "The
Clouds," as sitting on a perch, looking at the
stars."
When I wrote to them the rest of the story,
Ihey answered: "Why not put the Administra
tion on a perch?"
I answered today, "We wait and see."
Sergio Ferrari
Duty to Transmit Knowledge
Editor, The Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus. I have been ap
proached for dollars which, as a graduate, I do
not have. The best I can do is to offer ideas, of
which Stanford seems to have as much as of
money.
The Sibley case is the second in recent years
in which the contract of a Stanford professor was
allowed to expire because of his alleged lack of
research and despite his excellence as a teacher.
If we were to conclude from these incidents that
the Administration is aiming to build a faculty
each one of which is a first-rank researcher and
a first-rank teacher, then the Administration
would be guilty of mere lack of realism.
But any Stanford student can think of exam
ples of faculty members who lack teaching talent
but whose achievement in research assures them
of a continuing contract—and rightly so. It is
evident, then, that the Administration does not
demand teacher-researchers, will not accept mere
teachers, but is satisfied with mere researchers.
The Stanford degree is thereby coming to repre
sent an association with learning rather than an
acquisition of learning.
It may be argued that if one does not want the
product Stanford puts on the market, one can
buy elsewhere. But Stanford is not only a busi
ness. It is also a university. It is subject not.
only to the law of supply and demand but also
to a social obligation. It has a duty to transmit
knowledge equally as great as its duty to in
crease knowledge.

Where Are Vacuity Members?
Editor, The Daily:
We Stanford students belong to the so-called
"silent generation" whose standard and absolute
is the Organization Man. We are often charac
terized by those of the preceding generation as
seeking respectability, security and conformity,
to the exclusion of all else.
Nevertheless, a decided minority of Stanford
students has shown itself interested enough in
the rights of the individual and the ideals of lib

eral education to make the rounds of University
administrators, questioning, suggesting possible
changes and sometimes challenging the most
sacred of Stanford institutions.
We have not met wilh much success, but we
have tried. There has also been much more po
litical action among the students this year than
for many years past, and Stanford has at last
been the scene of a political protest.
In discussing our ideas with faculty members
we have found that many of them are dissatisfied
with the status quo. They point out that policies
are made somewhere up in the wild blue yonder,
and that they are only informed AFTER policy
has been set.
They point out that the Academic Council is
largely powerless (witness its decision to use
Achievements Tests for admissions —what hap
pened to them?), and that they do not know what
the academic policy of the University is, because
President Serling has never said.
Often professors merely shrug and say that
things are usually decided somewhere on Inner
Quad, that they haven't anything to do with de
cisions, or that some committee or other is
handling the matter (probably confidentially!).
President Sterling says it is the faculty's fault if
it is apathetic.
A precedent for University policy is now being
established. The Administration is denying the
students—graduate and undergraduate—the stim
ulation of a very good teacher in the person of
Dr. Sibley, and is refusing to state the academic
policy accounting for this except to a few people
in confidence.
Students are protesting both against the loss
of Dr. Sibley and against the Administration's
arbitrary refusal to state its academic policy. The
concept of departmental autonomy has been com
pletely undermined.
The students, members of the silent generation,
are protesting—but where are the faculty mem
bers? Is it that they don't feel challenged, or are
they thinking ahead to contract renewal time,
keeping their noses clean, tending their own back
yard, or waiting to see? Who's silent now?

Fear of Losing Money?
Editor, The Daily:
Copy of a letter sent to President Sterling:
"It comes to mind that perhaps your refusal
to appoint Professor Sibley as a permanent mem
ber of Ihe Polilical Science Department is influ
enced by a fear that certain alumni will withdraw
their financial support from the University. Has
it been considered that many alumni are so in
censed by the Administration's handling of the
Sibley-Terman affair as to impair seriously their
allegiance, financial and otherwise, to Stanford?
Certainly the University can ill afford to lose the
loyalty of this group through an apparently ill
considered action on the part of the Administra
tion.

When I saw Professor Sibley among his stu
dents demonstrating against H-bomb tests I
wrote to my friends in Florence:
"A well-known professor of the Department
of Political Science was among his students in a
demonstration. We have to go back to 1848 to
see something like that in Italy. Our professors
are much more like the philosopher who was
described by Aristophanes in his play, "The
Clouds," as sitting on a perch, looking at the
stars."
When I wrote to them the rest of the story,
Ihey answered: "Why not put the Administra
tion on a perch?"
I answered today, "We wait and see."

Duty to Transmit Knowledge
Editor, The Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus. I have been ap
proached for dollars which, as a graduate, I do
not have. The best I can do is to offer ideas, of
which Stanford seems to have as much as of
money.
The Sibley case is the second in recent years
in which the contract of a Stanford professor was
allowed to expire because of his alleged lack of
research and despite his excellence as a teacher.
If we were to conclude from these incidents that
the Administration is aiming to build a faculty
each one of which is a first-rank researcher and
a first-rank teacher, then the Administration
would be guilty of mere lack of realism.
But any Stanford student can think of exam
ples of faculty members who lack teaching talent
but whose achievement in research assures them
of a continuing contract—and rightly so. It is
evident, then, that the Administration does not
demand teacher-researchers, will not accept mere
teachers, but is satisfied with mere researchers.
The Stanford degree is thereby coming to repre
sent an association with learning rather than an
acquisition of learning.
It may be argued that if one does not want the
product Stanford puts on the market, one can
buy elsewhere. But Stanford is not only a busi
ness. It is also a university. It is subject not.
only to the law of supply and demand but also
to a social obligation. It has a duty to transmit
knowledge equally as great as its duty to in
crease knowledge.

Where Are Vacuity Members?
Editor, The Daily:
We Stanford students belong to the so-called
"silent generation" whose standard and absolute
is the Organization Man. We are often charac
terized by those of the preceding generation as
seeking respectability, security and conformity,
to the exclusion of all else.
Nevertheless, a decided minority of Stanford
students has shown itself interested enough in
the rights of the individual and the ideals of lib

eral education to make the rounds of University
administrators, questioning, suggesting possible
changes and sometimes challenging the most
sacred of Stanford institutions.
We have not met wilh much success, but we
have tried. There has also been much more po
litical action among the students this year than
for many years past, and Stanford has at last
been the scene of a political protest.
In discussing our ideas with faculty members
we have found that many of them are dissatisfied
with the status quo. They point out that policies
are made somewhere up in the wild blue yonder,
and that they are only informed AFTER policy
has been set.
They point out that the Academic Council is
largely powerless (witness its decision to use
Achievements Tests for admissions —what hap
pened to them?), and that they do not know what
the academic policy of the University is, because
President Serling has never said.
Often professors merely shrug and say that
things are usually decided somewhere on Inner
Quad, that they haven't anything to do with de
cisions, or that some committee or other is
handling the matter (probably confidentially!).
President Sterling says it is the faculty's fault if
it is apathetic.
A precedent for University policy is now being
established. The Administration is denying the
students—graduate and undergraduate—the stim
ulation of a very good teacher in the person of
Dr. Sibley, and is refusing to state the academic
policy accounting for this except to a few people
in confidence.
Students are protesting both against the loss
of Dr. Sibley and against the Administration's
arbitrary refusal to state its academic policy. The
concept of departmental autonomy has been com
pletely undermined.
The students, members of the silent generation,
are protesting—but where are the faculty mem
bers? Is it that they don't feel challenged, or are
they thinking ahead to contract renewal time,
keeping their noses clean, tending their own back
yard, or waiting to see? Who's silent now?

Copy of a letter sent to President Sterling:
"It comes to mind that perhaps your refusal
to appoint Professor Sibley as a permanent mem

enced by a fear that certain alumni will withdraw
their financial support from the University. Has
it been considered that many alumni are so in
censed by the Administration's handling of the
Sibley-Terman affair as to impair seriously their

Certainly the University can ill afford to lose the

wrote to my friends in Florence:
"A well-known professor of the Department
of Political Science was among his students in a
demonstration. We have to go back to 1848 to
see something like that in Italy. Our professors
are much more like the philosopher who was
described by Aristophanes in his play, "The
Clouds," as sitting on a perch, looking at the
stars."
When I wrote to them the rest of the story,
Ihey answered: "Why not put the Administra
tion on a perch?"
I answered today, "We wait and see."

Duty to Transmit Knowledge
Editor, The Daily:
As a Stanford alumnus. I have been ap
proached for dollars which, as a graduate, I do
not have. The best I can do is to offer ideas, of
which Stanford seems to have as much as of
money.
The Sibley case is the second in recent years
in which the contract of a Stanford professor was
allowed to expire because of his alleged lack of
research and despite his excellence as a teacher.
If we were to conclude from these incidents that
the Administration is aiming to build a faculty
each one of which is a first-rank researcher and
a first-rank teacher, then the Administration
would be guilty of mere lack of realism.
But any Stanford student can think of exam
ples of faculty members who lack teaching talent
but whose achievement in research assures them
of a continuing contract—and rightly so. It is
evident, then, that the Administration does not
demand teacher-researchers, will not accept mere
teachers, but is satisfied with mere researchers.
The Stanford degree is thereby coming to repre
sent an association with learning rather than an
acquisition of learning.
It may be argued that if one does not want the
product Stanford puts on the market, one can
buy elsewhere. But Stanford is not only a busi
ness. It is also a university. It is subject not.
only to the law of supply and demand but also
to a social obligation. It has a duty to transmit
knowledge equally as great as its duty to in
crease knowledge.

Where Are Vacuity Members?
Editor, The Daily:
We Stanford students belong to the so-called
"silent generation" whose standard and absolute
is the Organization Man. We are often charac
terized by those of the preceding generation as
seeking respectability, security and conformity,
to the exclusion of all else.
Nevertheless, a decided minority of Stanford
students has shown itself interested enough in
the rights of the individual and the ideals of lib

eral education to make the rounds of University
administrators, questioning, suggesting possible
changes and sometimes challenging the most
sacred of Stanford institutions.
We have not met wilh much success, but we
have tried. There has also been much more po
litical action among the students this year than
for many years past, and Stanford has at last
been the scene of a political protest.
In discussing our ideas with faculty members
we have found that many of them are dissatisfied
with the status quo. They point out that policies
are made somewhere up in the wild blue yonder,
and that they are only informed AFTER policy
has been set.
They point out that the Academic Council is
largely powerless (witness its decision to use
Achievements Tests for admissions —what hap
pened to them?), and that they do not know what
the academic policy of the University is, because
President Serling has never said.
Often professors merely shrug and say that
things are usually decided somewhere on Inner
Quad, that they haven't anything to do with de
cisions, or that some committee or other is
handling the matter (probably confidentially!).
President Sterling says it is the faculty's fault if
it is apathetic.
A precedent for University policy is now being
established. The Administration is denying the
students—graduate and undergraduate—the stim
ulation of a very good teacher in the person of
Dr. Sibley, and is refusing to state the academic
policy accounting for this except to a few people
in confidence.
Students are protesting both against the loss
of Dr. Sibley and against the Administration's
arbitrary refusal to state its academic policy. The
concept of departmental autonomy has been com
pletely undermined.
The students, members of the silent generation,
are protesting—but where are the faculty mem
bers? Is it that they don't feel challenged, or are
they thinking ahead to contract renewal time,
keeping their noses clean, tending their own back
yard, or waiting to see? Who's silent now?

Copy of a letter sent to President Sterling:
"It comes to mind that perhaps your refusal
to appoint Professor Sibley as a permanent mem
ber of Ihe Polilical Science Department is influ
enced by a fear that certain alumni will withdraw
their financial support from the University. Has
it been considered that many alumni are so in
censed by the Administration's handling of the
Sibley-Terman affair as to impair seriously their
allegiance, financial and otherwise, to Stanford?
Certainly the University can ill afford to lose the
