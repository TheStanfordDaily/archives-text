# SIBLEY DISCUSSION
## Research vs. Teaching Raises Policy Question 
### Wally Simpson 
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth in a series ol' articles
covering 1 a panel discussion held
lust Monday between students
and faculty members on the
question of research versus
teaching as criteria for faculty
appointments, using: the non
appointment of Professor Mul
ford (J. Sibley as a specific ex
ample.
(The Daily is indebted to Sue
Pierce for recording- this discus
sion in shorthand so that stu
dents might have an accurate
record of what went on.)
Kummerfeld: "Political theory
is what I came to Stanford to
study. We are in the process of
looking for our third political
theorist. Therefore, I am going
to Harvard next year.
"You seem not to take into ac
count the effect on students in a
department of continual turnover.
You are not going to attract very
good graduate students. When a
man goes to graduate school, he
wants to study under the same
man.
"It seems that Stanford in this
instance has been looking for the
'big' man to enhance the reputa
tion of the department, and has
not found him."
Sterling - : "This does not come
as news to us. We are right in
the middle of it. This search is
very difficult and highly competi
tive. We looked for a man to fill
a post in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences, and we found
one after four and one-half years.
I can also cite other universities
that have had the same experi
ences."
Walker: "Can I make a point
here with reference to the desire
to study under one man? You are
not denying you had an interest
ing experience in theory?"
Kummerfeld: "No, I had an in
teresting experience. But it would
be important to the graduate slu
dent to have one man who is good
with whom he can work, some
one under whom he can write his
thesis, rather than having a big
man come every year. This ruins
the reputation of the department
in that field."
Barnes: "If we wait, we take
the risk of turning out students
who would have been greatly
stimulated in that area. We're not
turning out the students we would
have turned out. By waiting we
have lost a lot of stimulation."
Terman: "Well, when you take
on a man on the faculty in higher

levels, you take him on for 15, 20.
or even 25 years. You are serving
15 to 20 academic generations. It
may be that you have to put up
with a couple of years without a
man in that field, for the sake of
getting the kind of man you
want."
Brouse: "Regarding what Don
Kummerfeld was saying about ap
pointments and the necessity for
having one professor under which
we can study in the Political Sci
ence Department, we have in Pro
fessor Sibley someone who is ec
lectic in the extreme. Sibley re
sists the growing trend toward
specialization. Any graduate stu
dent can find help from Professor
Sibley.
"On the sheet of qualifications
that was passed around |by Dr.
Merrill K. Bennett, chairman of
the President's Advisory Board|,
the emphasis was placed on grad
uates. We are getting a research
scholar in Professor Hans Eulaus.
Why must we lose a man of this
kind? Why does disagreement
exist between the department and
the Administration on this fig
ure?"
Sterling: "It is a difference in
judgment. Theie is nothing ab
normal about this. Every year
recommendations are sent back to
the departments asking them to
do better.
"As to disagreement among
what you call the Administration
—this is a term I don't particu
larly like, never use it myself—
this Administration is composed
of people who are members of the
faculty. A great many of them
are involved in some kind of
teaching or research, and they
have all come up that way. These
people are in positions of having
to weigh evidence and make de
cisions."

want."
Brouse: "Regarding what Don
Kummerfeld was saying about ap
pointments and the necessity for
having one professor under which
we can study in the Political Sci
ence Department, we have in Pro
fessor Sibley someone who is ec
lectic in the extreme. Sibley re
sists the growing trend toward
specialization. Any graduate stu
dent can find help from Professor
Sibley.
"On the sheet of qualifications
that was passed around |by Dr.
Merrill K. Bennett, chairman of
the President's Advisory Board|,
the emphasis was placed on grad
uates. We are getting a research
scholar in Professor Hans Eulaus.
Why must we lose a man of this
kind? Why does disagreement
exist between the department and
the Administration on this fig
ure?"
Sterling: "It is a difference in
judgment. Theie is nothing ab
normal about this. Every year
recommendations are sent back to
the departments asking them to
do better.
"As to disagreement among
what you call the Administration
—this is a term I don't particu
larly like, never use it myself—
this Administration is composed
of people who are members of the
faculty. A great many of them
are involved in some kind of
teaching or research, and they
have all come up that way. These
people are in positions of having
to weigh evidence and make de
cisions."

(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth in a series ol' articles
covering 1 a panel discussion held
lust Monday between students
and faculty members on the
question of research versus
teaching as criteria for faculty
appointments, using: the non
appointment of Professor Mul
ford (J. Sibley as a specific ex
ample.
(The Daily is indebted to Sue
Pierce for recording- this discus
sion in shorthand so that stu
dents might have an accurate
record of what went on.)
Kummerfeld: "Political theory
is what I came to Stanford to
study. We are in the process of
looking for our third political
theorist. Therefore, I am going
to Harvard next year.
"You seem not to take into ac
count the effect on students in a
department of continual turnover.
You are not going to attract very
good graduate students. When a
man goes to graduate school, he
wants to study under the same
man.
"It seems that Stanford in this
instance has been looking for the
'big' man to enhance the reputa
tion of the department, and has
not found him."
Sterling - : "This does not come
as news to us. We are right in
the middle of it. This search is
very difficult and highly competi
tive. We looked for a man to fill
a post in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences, and we found
one after four and one-half years.
I can also cite other universities
that have had the same experi
ences."
Walker: "Can I make a point
here with reference to the desire
to study under one man? You are
not denying you had an interest
ing experience in theory?"
Kummerfeld: "No, I had an in
teresting experience. But it would
be important to the graduate slu
dent to have one man who is good
with whom he can work, some
one under whom he can write his
thesis, rather than having a big
man come every year. This ruins
the reputation of the department
in that field."
Barnes: "If we wait, we take
the risk of turning out students
who would have been greatly
stimulated in that area. We're not
turning out the students we would
have turned out. By waiting we
have lost a lot of stimulation."
Terman: "Well, when you take
on a man on the faculty in higher

levels, you take him on for 15, 20.
or even 25 years. You are serving
15 to 20 academic generations. It
may be that you have to put up
with a couple of years without a
man in that field, for the sake of
getting the kind of man you
want."
