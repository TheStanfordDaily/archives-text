# Cards Host Bruins, Troy in Top Net Matches
## 
### John Schwarz 
Stanford's netters face their toughest test of the home season
today and tomorrow when they host USC today and UCLA tomor
row. Bolh matches will begin at 1 p.m.
After today's test against the Trojans (which was discussed in
yesterday's Daily) the Indians will have to got ready to meet the even

tougher Bruins.
UCLA is not only tougher than
USC but they're also given the
nod by most experts as being the
top college tennis team in the na
tion.
The lineup UCLA Coach J. D.
Morgan will use on Saturday is
still in doubt but one certainty in
it should be Mike Franks playing
against Stanford's Jack Douglas
in the number one singles spot.
After Franks it will be either
lefty John Cranston, who cur
rently is in one of his hot streaks,
or Davis Cupper Mike Green.
Renker Uncertain
Stanford Coach Bob Renker is
not certain of his lineup either,
and Saturday's second man could
be Brooks Rawlins or Dave Nel
son. Rawlins is the regular in
this spot but recently Nelson has

been playing top-notch tennis and
has been pressing Rawlins for his
position.
Regardless of which Stanford
ites play in the two and three
spots, they both will be under
dogs against Cranston and Green.
After the third spot both teams
seem fairly set. UCLA will use
John Lesch in the four position,
Franklin Johnson in fifth and
Dale Rohland in the sixth spot.
Stanford will have Lowell Car
ruth playing against Lesch, Jim
Jeffries against Franklin John
son and probably Robin Ililge
man but maybe Gil White against
Rohland.
Strong in '59
To gain an indication of the
depth UCLA has down in Los An
geles, one just needs to notice
that Dale Rohland, their sixth
man, is undefeated this year and
only a junior. He will be the only
letterman returning next year,
yet he still figures to be in the
same sixth spot.
In doubles tomorrow, UCLA
has three extremely good teams
in Green-Franks, Cranston-Lesch
and RohlandJohnson. Their third
team of Rohland Johnson has de
feated Stanford's first team of
Rawlins and Douglas.
Stanford will try to counter
UCLA's teams with combos of
Rawlins-Douglas, Carruth-Nelson
and a third team made from
among Gil White, Jim Jeffries,
Robin Hilgeman and Bob Bow
den. This third team will depend
on how Renker's Ihird team does
today against SC.
