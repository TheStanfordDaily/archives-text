# Tribe Nine Hosts Peps In 2 Games
## 
### 
Dutch Fehring's Stanford In
dians take the weekend off from
the already-decided CIBA pennant
chase when Ihoy host the Pepper
dine Waves in a pair of weekend
games in the Sunken Diamond.
Today's till will begin at 3:15,
and tomorrow's will be a 10 a.m.
game. It was moved from the
original 2:30 starting time so as
not to /conflict with the spring
practice football scrimmage.
At last report, Fohring wasn't
sure whom he'd have on the
mound. Best guesses were that
Bob Leopold would throw today
and Dick Williams tomorrow.
George Avery will probably be
the first relief man for either
game.
Leopold will probably also be
Stanford's starter in the Tuesday
game here against California, so
Fehring may choose to let him
work only six or seven innings,
particularly if he's having to
throw a lot of pitches.
Stanford, with 20 wins in the
season against just 10 defeats,
will be favored to make the
Waves their 21st and 22nd vic
tims. Stanford has had particu
larly good fortune in the non-
CIBA games, compiling a 14-3 rec
ord. The losses all came on the
Indians' spring vacation trip to
the San Diego area.
After this weekend's series, the
Cards will have only three games
left on the 1958 slate. In addition
to Tuesday's game with Califor
nia, Stanford will meet Santa
Clara in a home-anil home series
next weekend.
