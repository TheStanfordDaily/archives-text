# All Eyes on Stanford's Final Spring Scrimmage
## 
### 
Coach Jack Curtice will get. his last look of
the spring at what will be the 1958 Stanford loot
ball team tomorrow al 2:MO p.m. in a scrimmage
in Stanford Stadium. Admission is free.
Curtice has named two well-balanced starting
teams for the final session of spring practice
which include 14 letter-winners from the 1957
team. Two men who lettered in 195(5 but were
hurt last year will start, along with five non
lettennen and one junior college transfer.
The scrimmage will be played under nearly
full game conditions. The notable exception will
be that free substitution will be allowed so that
Curtice and his staff can get a good look al the
entire squad.
The spots most up for grabs at the present
time are in the backfield. Sid Garber, Bob Nico
let and Dick Norman are all still in contention
for the starting quarterback berth next fall.
Garber and Nicolet will l»e starting signal callers
for the Reds and Whites respectively in tomor
row's game.

Three speedy fullbacks — John Bond, Doug
Dick and <»iI Dowd —are neck and neck for that
spot. Bond played halfback last year, Dowd
slurred for Ibe frosh before he was hurt and
Dick was second string in 1956. He was out with
a broken leg last year.
Three Jims —Honeywell, Sinnerud and Byrer
—are in the thick of the right-halfback fight,
with Dick Bowers and Rick McMillen the most
likely to come out on top in the battle for left
Jialf.
