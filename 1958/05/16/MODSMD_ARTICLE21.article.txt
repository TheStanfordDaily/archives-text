# PAAAU MEET TOMORROW
## 4 to Run at Coliseum 
### 
Four Stanford runners will get
their toughest tests of the season
tonight when they compete in the
Coliseum Relays in Los Angeles.
It will be the first major meet in
the United States to be held on an
all-grass track.
Hurdler Chuck Cobb looks to
have the best chance of any of
the Indians to win. He'll be going
in the 120-yard high hurdles
against Ancel Robinson, Lawson,
Ken Thompson and several other
outstanding high stick men from
California.
But Cobb has beaten all of them
during the season. He now ap
peal's recovered from his two

week-old attack of pneumonia,
and could come close to his season
best of 13.9 if the grass track
agrees with him.
Norman Lloyd will, face three
four-minute men in the open mile.
Lloyd, with a seasonal hest of
4:05.3, will run against Merv Lin
coln and Herb Elliott of Australia
and La/.slo Tabori, ex-Hungarian
runner now compeling for the
Santa Clara County Youth Vil
lage.
Maury Craves will meet Ihe
two best two-milers in the United
States when he tangles with Alex
Henderson and Max Truex.
Craves, with an early-season best
of 9:04.9, should be able to erack
the nine-minute mark. He hopes
for an evenly-paced race, feeling
that he can keep with the two na
tional collegiate record - breakers
if the pace is right.

Ernie Citnliffe will probably
again be the rabbit in the 880. But
he's hoping the race will turn out
like the Big Meet half-mile, when
he opened up such a wide lead on
the third 220 that the field never
did catch up.
Tomorrow at 1:15, 20 Indians
will swing into action at the Pa
cific Association AAIJ champion
ships at Burlingame High. Only
Cunliffe will run in both meets.

tonight when they compete in the
Coliseum Relays in Los Angeles.
It will be the first major meet in
the United States to be held on an
all-grass track.
Hurdler Chuck Cobb looks to
have the best chance of any of
the Indians to win. He'll be going
in the 120-yard high hurdles
against Ancel Robinson, Lawson,
Ken Thompson and several other
outstanding high stick men from
California.
But Cobb has beaten all of them
during the season. He now ap
peal's recovered from his two

week-old attack of pneumonia,
and could come close to his season
best of 13.9 if the grass track
agrees with him.
Norman Lloyd will, face three
four-minute men in the open mile.
Lloyd, with a seasonal hest of
4:05.3, will run against Merv Lin
coln and Herb Elliott of Australia
and La/.slo Tabori, ex-Hungarian
runner now compeling for the
Santa Clara County Youth Vil
lage.
Maury Craves will meet Ihe
two best two-milers in the United
States when he tangles with Alex
Henderson and Max Truex.
Craves, with an early-season best
of 9:04.9, should be able to erack
the nine-minute mark. He hopes
for an evenly-paced race, feeling
that he can keep with the two na
tional collegiate record - breakers
if the pace is right.

Ernie Citnliffe will probably
again be the rabbit in the 880. But
he's hoping the race will turn out
like the Big Meet half-mile, when
he opened up such a wide lead on
the third 220 that the field never
did catch up.
Tomorrow at 1:15, 20 Indians
will swing into action at the Pa
cific Association AAIJ champion
ships at Burlingame High. Only
Cunliffe will run in both meets.
