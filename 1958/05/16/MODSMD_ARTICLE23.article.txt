# Golfers Finish Dual Season; Seanor Out
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team
will round out its regular dual
match season this weekend as it
meets California on the Berkeley
course this afternoon in the sec
ond meeting between the two this
season, and then takes on the
powerful Stanford Alumni team
tomorrow on the Stanford course
at noon.
Coach Bud Finger expects a rel
atively light battle from the Cal
linksters in the light of their pre
vious 23 u 2-3 v 2 loss to the Indians
several weeks ago. This is de
spite the fact that Stanford may
be without the services of num
ber one golfer Bill Seanor. Sea
nor has been sidelined with a
broken kneecap and his playing
status is doubtful for both this
weekend's matches and the im
portant PCC championships here
next weekend.
Filling in the number one spot
for him in case he stays out will
probably be Bob Either. The rest
of the team will consist of Bernie
Magnussen, Alf Burtleson, Wood
gie Reich, Mike Shanahan, and
Steve Smith or Tom Quinn.
A definitely close match is ex
pected for the squad on Satur
day, as they take on an alumni
learn of champions. The alums
will be supported by Sandy Ta
turn, former JVC A A champion;
Dick McElyea, former PCC cham
pion; Bob Cardinal, Grant Spaeth,
Warren Berl and Chuck Van
Linge. The frosh will take on a
second alumni squad following
the varsity match.
