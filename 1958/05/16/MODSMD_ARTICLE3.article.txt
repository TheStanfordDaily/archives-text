# RESTON SPEAKS:
## Foreign Policy Behind Times 
### Steve Freidberg 
"Never in history has a sov
ereign nation moved so fast in 15
years and found itself so far be
hind."
This, according to James B.
("Scotty") Reston, head of the
New York Times' Washington bu
reau, is the present situation of
the United States and the central
problem in its foreign policy.
Reston's speech last night open
ed the lIR Foreign Policy Insti
tute, which is a new event at Stan
ford this year. He was brought
here on a grant by ASSU and the
University to give students an
outlook on world problems and
attempts of American foreign pol
icy to cope with them.
The last 20 years, he said, have
seen an extraordinary series of
events and changes which have
brought the United States to the
front as a world power.
Population Growth
lie pointed out, as indicative of
some of the changes, the tremen
dous population increase in this
country, a social revolution be
tween the North and the South,
and a party out of office for 20
years assuming power.
Reston mentioned three things
the United States has done since

the end of World War II:
1. "The Marshall Plan, the UN
and other such collective meas
ures have created a balance of
power."
2. "We have learned the lesson
of two wars—the lesson that a
nation must sacrifice before war
breaks out, not after it has start
ed."
3. "We have urged the peoples
of Europe to build up in economic
and political fields, and to pro
gress by unified action."
Unclear
American purposes and policy
are not self-evident to the world,
and there is a lack of understand
ing of them, he stated. That they
are not self-evident is indicated by
attacks on American embassies in
Lebanon and Algeria and violence
toward Vice President Nixon in
South America.
"Where we are going from here
depends on the leadership we get
from Washington,"he said. "We
are entitled to have confidence
that a people which have changed
and made national sacrifice since
19-14 will make the necessary
changes for the next 30 years if
they have good leadership."
At Rickey's
Reston's talk was preceded by
a dinner at Rickey's, at which
Mayor George Christopher of San
Francisco made a welcoming
speech. He stated that the last
week has been one of the most
disastrous in national history, and
that we must show the rest of the
world how our system of democ
racy operates in order to prevent
further occurrences like these.
Reston will elaborate further on
his address last night at Memorial
Auditorium this afternoon at 4:15.
lie will also be at the Women's
Clubhouse at 3:15 for an Informal
question - and - answer session, to
which the public has been invited.

gress by unified action."
Unclear
American purposes and policy
are not self-evident to the world,
and there is a lack of understand
ing of them, he stated. That they
are not self-evident is indicated by
attacks on American embassies in
Lebanon and Algeria and violence
toward Vice President Nixon in
South America.
"Where we are going from here
depends on the leadership we get
from Washington,"he said. "We
are entitled to have confidence
that a people which have changed
and made national sacrifice since
19-14 will make the necessary
changes for the next 30 years if
they have good leadership."
At Rickey's
Reston's talk was preceded by
a dinner at Rickey's, at which
Mayor George Christopher of San
Francisco made a welcoming
speech. He stated that the last
week has been one of the most
disastrous in national history, and
that we must show the rest of the
world how our system of democ
racy operates in order to prevent
further occurrences like these.
Reston will elaborate further on
his address last night at Memorial
Auditorium this afternoon at 4:15.
lie will also be at the Women's
Clubhouse at 3:15 for an Informal

S.F. MAYOR GEORGE CHRISTOPHER AND JAMES RESTON
Over Coffee at Rickey's—American Foreign Policy
"Never in history has a sov
ereign nation moved so fast in 15
years and found itself so far be
hind."
This, according to James B.
("Scotty") Reston, head of the
New York Times' Washington bu
reau, is the present situation of
the United States and the central
problem in its foreign policy.
Reston's speech last night open
ed the lIR Foreign Policy Insti
tute, which is a new event at Stan
ford this year. He was brought
here on a grant by ASSU and the
University to give students an
outlook on world problems and
attempts of American foreign pol
icy to cope with them.
The last 20 years, he said, have
seen an extraordinary series of
events and changes which have
brought the United States to the
front as a world power.
Population Growth
lie pointed out, as indicative of
some of the changes, the tremen
dous population increase in this
country, a social revolution be
tween the North and the South,
and a party out of office for 20
years assuming power.
Reston mentioned three things
the United States has done since

the end of World War II:
1. "The Marshall Plan, the UN
and other such collective meas
ures have created a balance of
power."
2. "We have learned the lesson
of two wars—the lesson that a
nation must sacrifice before war
breaks out, not after it has start
ed."
3. "We have urged the peoples
of Europe to build up in economic
and political fields, and to pro
gress by unified action."
