## 
### 
Charles "Chic" Gast Jr., 20, Phi
Kappa Sigma work manager, was
spirited away on a 15-hour, 360-
mile adventure Wednesday when
Phi Kap pledges succeeded in an
elaborate pledge sneak.
Gast, a sophomore geography
major from Palm Beach, Fla.,
was "kidnapped" by a contingent
of three of the 22 pledges Wed
nesday about. 9 a.m. They took
him to an apartment in Atherton
where they left him tied in the
care of a non-pledge known to the
victim as Paul.
The pledges returned to the Phi
Kap house where they proceeded
to throw hay all over the floor
and toss in a bees' nest to add to
the confusion.
About 11 a.m. the pledges drove
Gast to the San Carlos Airport
after finding their plan to take
him to the Palo Alto Airport had
been discovered by the actives.
At San Carlos, Gast was placed
in a rented Cessna 172 with frosh
pledges Terry Inch and Dick Big
gar and an unidentified pilot.
About 2 p.m. the plane landed
at the dirt runway of the Covello
Airport, a small town 180 ryiiles
north of San Francisco. Gast was
told to get home however he
could.
Gast said he got a ride to
Tracy, arriving about 8 p.m., and
he walked to San Leandro where
he called the Phi Kap house ask
ing for a rifle.
He stepped into a restaurant
and ordered food. "When the
waitress set the cheeseburger in
front of me my mind went blank,"
Gast said. "I couldn't remember

my name or where I was from
for a while, hut gradually my
memory returned."
Henry Hill, a sophomore frater
nity brother, arrived to drive Gast
hack to Stanford. However, three
reserve policemen, who had been
concerned by Gast's actions, in-

sisted that he go to the hospital
for a check-up.
"1 waited for a doctor for an
hour and by then I could remem
ber everything," Gast said. They
finally returned to Stanford
about 12:30 a.m. yesterday.
A check-up at Ihe Health Serv
ice showed nothing medically
wrong with Gast,

my name or where I was from
for a while, hut gradually my
memory returned."
