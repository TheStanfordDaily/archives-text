# 2000 Will Sing in Frost Competition
## 
### Jack Winkler 
Two thousand voices and an au
dience of 8000 will be on hand for
the 18th annual Spring Sing com
petition at Frost Amphitheater
tonight, but there is a lot more
than harmony on the programâ€”
including the introduction of
Head Yell Leader-elect Dick Stan
ford and the five new 1958 pom
pon girls, four specialty acts and
maybe even a talk from football
Coach Jack Curtice.
The show will get an earlier
start this year at 7:15 to allow
the 38 groups ample time to get
through their numbers.
Defending Champs
Defending Sweepstakes cham
pions, the combined Medical and
Nursing Schools, will pay tribute
to composer Randall Thompson,
who is visiting Stanford this week
as a guest lecturer, when they
perform his "Ye Shall Have a
Song" in the competition tonight.
Jim Walters, head yell leader
himself in 1955, will be master of
ceremonies for the songfest and
has streamlined the program to
speed up the singing, and has
made an outright promise to elim
inate "have-you-heard' v jokes.
The four specialty numbers,
Biz School's Mike "Fingers"
Biggs at the piano, Andy Rice's
DU Sextette, the Sigma Chi
"Rinky-Tinks" Jim Pollock and
Fred Soetje, and the star of the
Intimate Revue, Billy White Jr.,
will be spaced evenly throughout
the evening to give variety to the
show.
Coach Curtice
Football Coach Jack Curtice
may be the special guest of the
evening. He has a speaking en
gagement which conflicts with
the Sing, but he has promised he
will try and make it for a few
minutes right before the final
judging.
Barbara Baer, Rosie Dedman,
Caryl Ely, Carol Erickson and
Nancy Viets will make their ap
pearance as the pompon girls
select and Dick "Drofnats" Stan
ford will give his first cheer
when he officially takes over as
head yell leader from Ed Borden
kircher at the conclusion of the
night's festivities.
Opening Number
The program will open with
Roth and Delta Chi singing "Cin
dy" and close three to four hours
later with Branner's rendition of
"A-Round the Corner."
Whatever the fate of their
Sweepstakes championship, the
Medical and Nursing Schools are
certain to walk off with one prize.
They are the only entrant in the
over-80 division. There's also
over-80 division. There's also
slight competition in the Wom
en's 40-80 section with only Bran
ner, Roblc and Lathrop House
entered there.
Judging the singing will be Mu
sic Professor Sandor Salgo, Cho
ral Director Harold Schmidt and
Assistant Choral Director Rob
ert MacKinnon.
