move—over to the new Super Shell pump.
Super Shell has an aviation "power pack" of aromatics s
to provide protection against knock under every driving
condition. But in today's engines anti-knock alone is not
enough.
That's why there's TCP* in Super Shell to guarantee
full power, by ending today's major cause of power loss,
spark plug "miss." TCP additive does this by neutralizing
harmful combustion deposits—and so restores as much us
30 lost horsepower!
What's more, Super Shell's aromatics provide extra
combustion energy that converts automatically to extra
miles in every tankful. 112 \ I
