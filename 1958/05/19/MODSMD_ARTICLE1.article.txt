# Med Students Take Honors
## 
### Jack Winkler 
Spring Sing on Friday night was something like the Preakness on
Saturday afternoon. There were many good horses in the field, but
when the results were in, the favorite had won again.
On Saturday at Pimlico it was Tim Tarn; on Friday night in the
Frost Amphitheater, it was the Medical and Nursing Schools.

Winners of the sweepstakes
for the second straight year were
the nurses and doctors from San
Francisco with their singing of
"Ye Shall Have a Song," pre
sented as a tribute to its compos
er, Randall Thompson, who has
been visiting Stanford for the
past week as a guest lecturer.
Thirty-four other teams were
entered in what has now become
the annual battle to see who can
take the top prize away from the
Medical and Nursing Schools, and
they were good in their own divi
sions, but none could surpass the
precision of the champions' sing
ing, or the impressiveness of
their appearance, dressed immac
ulately as always in their medical
uniforms.
No Silky Sullivan
Spring Sing had no Silky Sulli
van, but it had some other good
"horses" who showed up well in
the running. Phi Delta Theta
provided the full-house audience
of more than 8000 with some
laughs with their "Old Farm
Folktune" about Leland Stan
ford's Farm and won the prize for
originality, which was given for
the first time this year.
Alpha Delta Phi presented its
second "Esoteric Compendium," a
little ditty bearing striking re
semblance to the cacophonous
football jingles of three lesser
known California institutions. It
took the men's under-40 prize.
More Prizes
Guthrie House and Phi Sigma
Kappa won the under-forty prize
for mixed groups with "Cran
berry Corners." The mixed prize
for the 40-80 class went to Storey
House and Alpha Sigma Phi for
"And the Trees Do Moan."
Branner won the Women's 40-
80 division with their singing of
"Around the Corner."
Music Professor Sandor Salgo
was taken ill and was unable to
judge the competition as planned.
His place was taken by Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler.
The other judges were Choral
Director Harold Schmidt, Assist
ant Choral Director Robert Mac-
Kinnon and Rally Com Chairman
Bill Richards.
