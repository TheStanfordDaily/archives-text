# Sibley Case Suggests Basic Power Problem
## 
### William Broder 
(Editor's Note: William Bro
der, u graduate student in the
English Department, will ana
lyze some of the issues involved
in the Sibley case, and their re
lation to University problems,
in this and other articles of a
series.)
The case of the non-appoint
ment of Mulford Q. Sibley is not
closed, nor will it be closed as long
as a doubt remains in the mind
of one citizen of this community.
If Stanford University purports
to uphold the liberal democratic
tradition of Western culture, it
must recognize that its decision
in this case is open to question,
and it should encourage intelli
gent opposition.
By stating that the case is
closed, and hiding behind what
appears to be a specious secrecy,
the University is setting itself up
as an irresponsible power, a pre
tender to infallibility of decision.
Loses Power
Authority is not buttressed by
wielding it as a club; in fact, by
such means the president loses
his greatest powder —that of com
manding voluntary assent — and
at the same time betrays the fear
that his power might be under
mined.
Decisions need not be put to a
vote. Re-evaluation and revision
are possible without the loss of
authority by convincing the mem
bers of Stanford University that
the Sibley decision is in keeping
with the ultimate goals of that
institution.
This can only be done by mak
ing all the information of this
case accessible to the whole com
munity. Lack of information,
however, is no excuse for inaction
on the part of the members of
the institution.
In view of the information that
the President's Office has seen fit
tf> divulge about the Sibley case
to the community at large, every
responsible citizen of that com
munity should protest both the
decision itself and the manner in
which the entire Sibley affair has
been handled.
While the case is admittedly
unique in recent years, it displays
a basic lack of evaluation of the
goals of this University.
Not Unique
The attitudes revealed by this
situation are not at all unique.
The President's Office has han
dled the students with parental
despotism, either deflecting their
dissatisfaction to irrelevancies or
reminding them that their proper
place is in the classroom and the
playing field rather than as citi
zens of a community.
The faculty has displayed an
apparent ineffectuality; few, if
any, of them have come forth to
challenge or even to openly dis
cuss the problems involved. Those
members of the faculty who have
been questioned by students claim
that they have no information on
the affair.
This can only be interpreted as
an inadequate sense of responsi
bility toward the institution as a
whole; they should have made it
their business to obtain the neces
sary information, and have acted
upon it.
An admittedly small and not
very strong number of students
are the only members of this in
stitution who have shown them
selves responsible. Their two
main protest meetings in Union

court display the results of years
of training in a democratic so
ciety.
These meetings embodied the
ideal of a seminar in the best
sense of that word.
The students were orderly, yet
everyone had the opportunity to
speak and disagree; the views ex
pressed were highly intelligent,
even astute, dealing not only with
the problem of Dr. Sibley's non
appointment but also with the
principles involved—the weakness
of the University structure and
possibilities of remedying those
weaknesses.
Most significant, however, was
the sense of humor displayed by
the group; it was a humility, a
form of self-criticism deeply un
derlaid by responsibility.
These students wanted, not a
reversal of the Sibley decision,
but an explanation. A satisfac
tory explanation has still not been
made.
The consideration of Dr. Sibley
for the Political Science Depart
m en t began in the customary
manner: the recommendation
stemming from joint action of
the department and the dean of
the school was handed to the Pres
ident's Office for approval, where
it remained for approximately two
months.
Sign Petition
During this time about 300 stu
dents indicated their concern for
Dr. Sibley's future by signing a
petition—which was not turned
in to the president, but of which
he was fully aware. It was not
turned in for fear it might be
detrimental to Sibley while his
appointment was still under con
sideration.
Apparently the president did
not feel responsible to the feelings
of this small group, for no ex
planation was made when he de
cided not to hire Dr. Sibley.
In case of appointment, the next
step would have been the submis
sion of the recommendation to the
Advisory Board — a committee
elected from the faculty — and
then on to the Board of Trustees
for final approval.
Under the Articles of Organiza
tion of the Faculty, as revised
Sept. 1, 1957, the president is not
obligated to submit any "execu
tive acts of general importance
such as recommendations for ap
pointments, promotions and dis
missals, for the creation of new
departments or chairs, and for the
abolition of departments or
chairs" to Ihe Advisory Board un
less he wants them approved, with
the one exception of dismissal of
an appointed professor.
Absolute Veto
Thus the president exercises ab
solute veto power on all Univer
sity business, with that one excep
tion.
It may be argued that the Ad
visory Board "may, by a vote of
five of its members, appeal to the
trustees any differences between
the president and itself," but in a
case similar to Sibley's the Ad
visory Board could not be expect
ed to take action because it would
have no information about the af
fair—nor is the president under
any legal obligation to provide
them with such information, any
more than he is to do so to the
students.
It may further be argued that
the Advisory Board "shall have
the power to convene the Aca
demic Council at any time."
However, assuming the Advi

sory Board was alarmed over the
Sibley case and called the Aca
demic Council together, the presi
dent's power is so great in the
council that, should he wish, no
action could be taken.
According to the articles, the
organization of the University has
the deceptive appearance of a con
stitutional democracy, with a sys
tem of checks and balances.
Two Houses
The two houses are: (1) the
administrative committees, ap
pointed directly by the president,
including such crucial committees
as those on Financial Awards,
General Studies, and Research
( Supplementary Research
Grants); (2) the academic com
mittees, including Admissions,
Graduate Study, and Independent
Study.
The chief academic committee
is culled the "Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council"and
consists of the president, the reg
istrar, the academic secretary and
seven other members—one from
each department grouping on the
faculty.
This committee appoints the
members of all other academic
committees, and, furthermore, the
president appoints "a Dean of
Graduate Study, who shall be ex
officio chairman of the Graduate
Study Committee."
Thus, of the 10 members of the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, three owe their
allegiance to the president, as
does the chairman of one of the
most important academic com
mittees.
The Advisory Board, a com
pletely independent body, has the
appearance of a supreme court of
the University, but, as has already
been pointed out, the president is
required only to submit the act
of firing an appointed professor
to them—or, for that matter, to
the Board of Trustees.
There are indications that the
actual working of the University
organization does not exactly fol
low the last-published laws, but
more than a few professors have
indicated that the president has
absolute power in the University.
Aroused Protest
Tt was the exercise of this abso
lute power by the president—in
the face of the recommendations
of the Political Science Depart
ment and the Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences—that
aroused the protest of the stu
dents.
On the whole, students are a
docile lot, willing to believe what
they are told by those they trust.
But it seemed to them that the
department and the dean of the
school should be somewhat trust
worthy in such a case. Their cu
riosity as to why this was not so
seems to be justified.

appointment was still under con
sideration.
Apparently the president did
not feel responsible to the feelings
of this small group, for no ex
planation was made when he de
cided not to hire Dr. Sibley.
In case of appointment, the next
step would have been the submis
sion of the recommendation to the
Advisory Board — a committee
elected from the faculty — and
then on to the Board of Trustees
for final approval.
Under the Articles of Organiza
tion of the Faculty, as revised
Sept. 1, 1957, the president is not
obligated to submit any "execu
tive acts of general importance
such as recommendations for ap
pointments, promotions and dis
missals, for the creation of new
departments or chairs, and for the
abolition of departments or
chairs" to Ihe Advisory Board un
less he wants them approved, with
the one exception of dismissal of
an appointed professor.
Absolute Veto
Thus the president exercises ab
solute veto power on all Univer
sity business, with that one excep
tion.
It may be argued that the Ad
visory Board "may, by a vote of
five of its members, appeal to the
trustees any differences between
the president and itself," but in a
case similar to Sibley's the Ad
visory Board could not be expect
ed to take action because it would
have no information about the af
fair—nor is the president under
any legal obligation to provide
them with such information, any
more than he is to do so to the
students.
It may further be argued that
the Advisory Board "shall have
the power to convene the Aca
demic Council at any time."
However, assuming the Advi

sory Board was alarmed over the
Sibley case and called the Aca
demic Council together, the presi
dent's power is so great in the
council that, should he wish, no
action could be taken.
According to the articles, the
organization of the University has
the deceptive appearance of a con
stitutional democracy, with a sys
tem of checks and balances.
Two Houses
The two houses are: (1) the
administrative committees, ap
pointed directly by the president,
including such crucial committees
as those on Financial Awards,
General Studies, and Research
( Supplementary Research
Grants); (2) the academic com
mittees, including Admissions,
Graduate Study, and Independent
Study.
The chief academic committee
is culled the "Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council"and
consists of the president, the reg
istrar, the academic secretary and
seven other members—one from
each department grouping on the
faculty.
This committee appoints the
members of all other academic
committees, and, furthermore, the
president appoints "a Dean of
Graduate Study, who shall be ex
officio chairman of the Graduate
Study Committee."
Thus, of the 10 members of the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, three owe their
allegiance to the president, as
does the chairman of one of the
most important academic com
mittees.
The Advisory Board, a com
pletely independent body, has the
appearance of a supreme court of
the University, but, as has already
been pointed out, the president is
required only to submit the act
of firing an appointed professor
to them—or, for that matter, to
the Board of Trustees.
There are indications that the
actual working of the University
organization does not exactly fol
low the last-published laws, but
more than a few professors have
indicated that the president has
absolute power in the University.
Aroused Protest
Tt was the exercise of this abso
lute power by the president—in
the face of the recommendations
of the Political Science Depart
ment and the Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences—that
aroused the protest of the stu
dents.
On the whole, students are a
docile lot, willing to believe what
they are told by those they trust.
But it seemed to them that the
department and the dean of the
school should be somewhat trust
worthy in such a case. Their cu
riosity as to why this was not so
seems to be justified.

(Tomorrow —an analysis of
the history of the president's
power at the University, stem
ming from the Founding Grant
itself, and a discussion of the
possible interpretations of the
Sibley decision by the Univer
sity community and the public
at large.
(Subsequent articles in this
series will discuss the role of
the University, the intentions
of the founders, the role of the
faculty, and concrete proposals
for possible remedies of the sit
uation. The author will at all
times attempt to use the Sibley
case as an example.)
(Editor's Note: William Bro
der, u graduate student in the
English Department, will ana
lyze some of the issues involved
in the Sibley case, and their re
lation to University problems,
in this and other articles of a
series.)
The case of the non-appoint
ment of Mulford Q. Sibley is not
closed, nor will it be closed as long
as a doubt remains in the mind
of one citizen of this community.
If Stanford University purports
to uphold the liberal democratic
tradition of Western culture, it
must recognize that its decision
in this case is open to question,
and it should encourage intelli
gent opposition.
By stating that the case is
closed, and hiding behind what
appears to be a specious secrecy,
the University is setting itself up
as an irresponsible power, a pre
tender to infallibility of decision.
Loses Power
Authority is not buttressed by
wielding it as a club; in fact, by
such means the president loses
his greatest powder —that of com
manding voluntary assent — and
at the same time betrays the fear
that his power might be under
mined.
Decisions need not be put to a
vote. Re-evaluation and revision
are possible without the loss of
authority by convincing the mem
bers of Stanford University that
the Sibley decision is in keeping
with the ultimate goals of that
institution.
This can only be done by mak
ing all the information of this
case accessible to the whole com
munity. Lack of information,
however, is no excuse for inaction
on the part of the members of
the institution.
In view of the information that
the President's Office has seen fit
tf> divulge about the Sibley case
to the community at large, every
responsible citizen of that com
munity should protest both the
decision itself and the manner in
which the entire Sibley affair has
been handled.
While the case is admittedly
unique in recent years, it displays
a basic lack of evaluation of the
goals of this University.
Not Unique
The attitudes revealed by this
situation are not at all unique.
The President's Office has han
dled the students with parental
despotism, either deflecting their
dissatisfaction to irrelevancies or
reminding them that their proper
place is in the classroom and the
playing field rather than as citi
zens of a community.
The faculty has displayed an
apparent ineffectuality; few, if
any, of them have come forth to
challenge or even to openly dis
cuss the problems involved. Those
members of the faculty who have
been questioned by students claim
that they have no information on
the affair.
This can only be interpreted as
an inadequate sense of responsi
bility toward the institution as a
whole; they should have made it
their business to obtain the neces
sary information, and have acted
upon it.
An admittedly small and not
very strong number of students
are the only members of this in
stitution who have shown them
selves responsible. Their two
main protest meetings in Union

court display the results of years
of training in a democratic so
ciety.
These meetings embodied the
ideal of a seminar in the best
sense of that word.
The students were orderly, yet
everyone had the opportunity to
speak and disagree; the views ex
pressed were highly intelligent,
even astute, dealing not only with
the problem of Dr. Sibley's non
appointment but also with the
principles involved—the weakness
of the University structure and
possibilities of remedying those
weaknesses.
Most significant, however, was
the sense of humor displayed by
the group; it was a humility, a
form of self-criticism deeply un
derlaid by responsibility.
These students wanted, not a
reversal of the Sibley decision,
but an explanation. A satisfac
tory explanation has still not been
made.
The consideration of Dr. Sibley
for the Political Science Depart
m en t began in the customary
manner: the recommendation
stemming from joint action of
the department and the dean of
the school was handed to the Pres
ident's Office for approval, where
it remained for approximately two
months.
Sign Petition
During this time about 300 stu
dents indicated their concern for
Dr. Sibley's future by signing a
petition—which was not turned
in to the president, but of which
he was fully aware. It was not
turned in for fear it might be
detrimental to Sibley while his
appointment was still under con
sideration.
Apparently the president did
not feel responsible to the feelings
of this small group, for no ex
planation was made when he de
cided not to hire Dr. Sibley.
In case of appointment, the next

case as an example.)
(Editor's Note: William Bro

in the Sibley case, and their re

in this and other articles of a
series.)
The case of the non-appoint
ment of Mulford Q. Sibley is not
closed, nor will it be closed as long
as a doubt remains in the mind
of one citizen of this community.
If Stanford University purports
to uphold the liberal democratic
tradition of Western culture, it
must recognize that its decision
in this case is open to question,
and it should encourage intelli
gent opposition.
By stating that the case is
closed, and hiding behind what
appears to be a specious secrecy,
the University is setting itself up
as an irresponsible power, a pre
tender to infallibility of decision.
Loses Power
Authority is not buttressed by
wielding it as a club; in fact, by
such means the president loses
his greatest powder —that of com
manding voluntary assent — and
at the same time betrays the fear
that his power might be under
mined.
Decisions need not be put to a
vote. Re-evaluation and revision
are possible without the loss of
authority by convincing the mem
bers of Stanford University that
the Sibley decision is in keeping
with the ultimate goals of that
institution.
This can only be done by mak
ing all the information of this
case accessible to the whole com
munity. Lack of information,
however, is no excuse for inaction
on the part of the members of
the institution.
In view of the information that
the President's Office has seen fit
tf> divulge about the Sibley case
to the community at large, every
responsible citizen of that com
munity should protest both the
decision itself and the manner in
which the entire Sibley affair has
been handled.
While the case is admittedly
unique in recent years, it displays
a basic lack of evaluation of the
goals of this University.
Not Unique
The attitudes revealed by this
situation are not at all unique.
The President's Office has han
dled the students with parental
despotism, either deflecting their
dissatisfaction to irrelevancies or
reminding them that their proper
place is in the classroom and the
playing field rather than as citi
zens of a community.
The faculty has displayed an
apparent ineffectuality; few, if
any, of them have come forth to
challenge or even to openly dis
cuss the problems involved. Those
members of the faculty who have
been questioned by students claim
that they have no information on
the affair.
This can only be interpreted as
an inadequate sense of responsi
bility toward the institution as a
whole; they should have made it
their business to obtain the neces
sary information, and have acted
upon it.
An admittedly small and not
very strong number of students
are the only members of this in
stitution who have shown them
selves responsible. Their two
main protest meetings in Union

court display the results of years
of training in a democratic so
ciety.
These meetings embodied the
ideal of a seminar in the best
sense of that word.
The students were orderly, yet
everyone had the opportunity to
speak and disagree; the views ex
pressed were highly intelligent,
even astute, dealing not only with
the problem of Dr. Sibley's non
appointment but also with the
principles involved—the weakness
of the University structure and
possibilities of remedying those
weaknesses.
Most significant, however, was
the sense of humor displayed by
the group; it was a humility, a
form of self-criticism deeply un
derlaid by responsibility.
These students wanted, not a
reversal of the Sibley decision,
but an explanation. A satisfac
tory explanation has still not been
made.
The consideration of Dr. Sibley
for the Political Science Depart
m en t began in the customary
manner: the recommendation
stemming from joint action of
the department and the dean of
the school was handed to the Pres
ident's Office for approval, where
it remained for approximately two
months.
Sign Petition
During this time about 300 stu
dents indicated their concern for
Dr. Sibley's future by signing a
petition—which was not turned
in to the president, but of which
he was fully aware. It was not
turned in for fear it might be
detrimental to Sibley while his
appointment was still under con
sideration.
Apparently the president did
not feel responsible to the feelings
of this small group, for no ex
planation was made when he de
cided not to hire Dr. Sibley.
In case of appointment, the next
step would have been the submis
sion of the recommendation to the
Advisory Board — a committee
elected from the faculty — and
then on to the Board of Trustees
for final approval.
Under the Articles of Organiza
tion of the Faculty, as revised
Sept. 1, 1957, the president is not
obligated to submit any "execu
tive acts of general importance
such as recommendations for ap
pointments, promotions and dis
missals, for the creation of new
departments or chairs, and for the
abolition of departments or
chairs" to Ihe Advisory Board un
less he wants them approved, with
the one exception of dismissal of
an appointed professor.
Absolute Veto
Thus the president exercises ab
solute veto power on all Univer
sity business, with that one excep
tion.
It may be argued that the Ad
visory Board "may, by a vote of
five of its members, appeal to the
trustees any differences between
the president and itself," but in a
case similar to Sibley's the Ad
visory Board could not be expect
ed to take action because it would
have no information about the af
fair—nor is the president under
any legal obligation to provide
them with such information, any
more than he is to do so to the
students.
It may further be argued that
the Advisory Board "shall have
the power to convene the Aca
demic Council at any time."
However, assuming the Advi

sory Board was alarmed over the
Sibley case and called the Aca
demic Council together, the presi
dent's power is so great in the
council that, should he wish, no
action could be taken.
According to the articles, the
organization of the University has
the deceptive appearance of a con
stitutional democracy, with a sys
tem of checks and balances.
Two Houses
The two houses are: (1) the
administrative committees, ap
pointed directly by the president,
including such crucial committees
as those on Financial Awards,
General Studies, and Research
( Supplementary Research
Grants); (2) the academic com
mittees, including Admissions,
Graduate Study, and Independent
Study.
The chief academic committee
is culled the "Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council"and
consists of the president, the reg
istrar, the academic secretary and
seven other members—one from
each department grouping on the
faculty.
This committee appoints the
members of all other academic
committees, and, furthermore, the
president appoints "a Dean of
Graduate Study, who shall be ex
officio chairman of the Graduate
Study Committee."
Thus, of the 10 members of the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, three owe their
allegiance to the president, as
does the chairman of one of the
most important academic com
mittees.
The Advisory Board, a com
pletely independent body, has the
appearance of a supreme court of
the University, but, as has already
been pointed out, the president is
required only to submit the act
of firing an appointed professor
to them—or, for that matter, to
the Board of Trustees.
There are indications that the
actual working of the University
organization does not exactly fol
low the last-published laws, but
more than a few professors have
indicated that the president has
absolute power in the University.
Aroused Protest
Tt was the exercise of this abso
lute power by the president—in
the face of the recommendations
of the Political Science Depart
ment and the Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences—that
aroused the protest of the stu
dents.
On the whole, students are a
docile lot, willing to believe what
they are told by those they trust.
But it seemed to them that the
department and the dean of the
school should be somewhat trust
worthy in such a case. Their cu
riosity as to why this was not so
seems to be justified.

dents indicated their concern for
Dr. Sibley's future by signing a
petition—which was not turned
in to the president, but of which
he was fully aware. It was not
turned in for fear it might be
detrimental to Sibley while his
appointment was still under con
sideration.
Apparently the president did
not feel responsible to the feelings
of this small group, for no ex
planation was made when he de
cided not to hire Dr. Sibley.
In case of appointment, the next
step would have been the submis
sion of the recommendation to the
Advisory Board — a committee
elected from the faculty — and
then on to the Board of Trustees
for final approval.
Under the Articles of Organiza
tion of the Faculty, as revised
Sept. 1, 1957, the president is not
obligated to submit any "execu
tive acts of general importance
such as recommendations for ap
pointments, promotions and dis
missals, for the creation of new
departments or chairs, and for the
abolition of departments or
chairs" to Ihe Advisory Board un
less he wants them approved, with
the one exception of dismissal of
an appointed professor.
Absolute Veto
Thus the president exercises ab
solute veto power on all Univer
sity business, with that one excep
tion.
It may be argued that the Ad
visory Board "may, by a vote of
five of its members, appeal to the
trustees any differences between
the president and itself," but in a
case similar to Sibley's the Ad
visory Board could not be expect
ed to take action because it would
have no information about the af
fair—nor is the president under
any legal obligation to provide
them with such information, any
more than he is to do so to the
students.
It may further be argued that
the Advisory Board "shall have
the power to convene the Aca
demic Council at any time."
However, assuming the Advi

sory Board was alarmed over the
Sibley case and called the Aca
demic Council together, the presi
dent's power is so great in the
council that, should he wish, no
action could be taken.
According to the articles, the
organization of the University has
the deceptive appearance of a con
stitutional democracy, with a sys
tem of checks and balances.
Two Houses
The two houses are: (1) the
administrative committees, ap
pointed directly by the president,
including such crucial committees
as those on Financial Awards,
General Studies, and Research
( Supplementary Research
Grants); (2) the academic com
mittees, including Admissions,
Graduate Study, and Independent
Study.
The chief academic committee
is culled the "Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council"and
consists of the president, the reg
istrar, the academic secretary and
seven other members—one from
each department grouping on the
faculty.
This committee appoints the
members of all other academic
committees, and, furthermore, the
president appoints "a Dean of
Graduate Study, who shall be ex
officio chairman of the Graduate
Study Committee."
Thus, of the 10 members of the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, three owe their
allegiance to the president, as
does the chairman of one of the
most important academic com
mittees.
The Advisory Board, a com
pletely independent body, has the
appearance of a supreme court of
the University, but, as has already
been pointed out, the president is
required only to submit the act
of firing an appointed professor
to them—or, for that matter, to
the Board of Trustees.
There are indications that the
actual working of the University
organization does not exactly fol
low the last-published laws, but
more than a few professors have
indicated that the president has
absolute power in the University.
Aroused Protest
Tt was the exercise of this abso
lute power by the president—in
the face of the recommendations
of the Political Science Depart
ment and the Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences—that
aroused the protest of the stu
dents.
On the whole, students are a
docile lot, willing to believe what
they are told by those they trust.
But it seemed to them that the
department and the dean of the
school should be somewhat trust
worthy in such a case. Their cu
riosity as to why this was not so
seems to be justified.

(Tomorrow —an analysis of
the history of the president's
power at the University, stem
ming from the Founding Grant
itself, and a discussion of the
possible interpretations of the
Sibley decision by the Univer
sity community and the public
at large.
(Subsequent articles in this
series will discuss the role of
the University, the intentions
of the founders, the role of the
faculty, and concrete proposals
for possible remedies of the sit
uation. The author will at all
times attempt to use the Sibley
case as an example.)
(Editor's Note: William Bro
der, u graduate student in the
English Department, will ana
lyze some of the issues involved
in the Sibley case, and their re
lation to University problems,
in this and other articles of a
series.)
The case of the non-appoint
ment of Mulford Q. Sibley is not
closed, nor will it be closed as long
as a doubt remains in the mind
of one citizen of this community.
If Stanford University purports
to uphold the liberal democratic
tradition of Western culture, it
must recognize that its decision
in this case is open to question,
and it should encourage intelli
gent opposition.
By stating that the case is
closed, and hiding behind what
appears to be a specious secrecy,
the University is setting itself up
as an irresponsible power, a pre
tender to infallibility of decision.
Loses Power
Authority is not buttressed by
wielding it as a club; in fact, by
such means the president loses
his greatest powder —that of com
manding voluntary assent — and
at the same time betrays the fear
that his power might be under
mined.
Decisions need not be put to a
vote. Re-evaluation and revision
are possible without the loss of
authority by convincing the mem
bers of Stanford University that
the Sibley decision is in keeping
with the ultimate goals of that
institution.
This can only be done by mak
ing all the information of this
case accessible to the whole com
munity. Lack of information,
however, is no excuse for inaction
on the part of the members of
the institution.
In view of the information that
the President's Office has seen fit
tf> divulge about the Sibley case
to the community at large, every
responsible citizen of that com
munity should protest both the
decision itself and the manner in
which the entire Sibley affair has
been handled.
While the case is admittedly
unique in recent years, it displays
a basic lack of evaluation of the
goals of this University.
Not Unique
The attitudes revealed by this
situation are not at all unique.
The President's Office has han
dled the students with parental
despotism, either deflecting their
dissatisfaction to irrelevancies or
reminding them that their proper
place is in the classroom and the
playing field rather than as citi
zens of a community.
The faculty has displayed an
apparent ineffectuality; few, if
any, of them have come forth to
challenge or even to openly dis
cuss the problems involved. Those
members of the faculty who have
been questioned by students claim
that they have no information on
the affair.
This can only be interpreted as
an inadequate sense of responsi
bility toward the institution as a
whole; they should have made it
their business to obtain the neces
sary information, and have acted
upon it.
An admittedly small and not
very strong number of students
are the only members of this in
stitution who have shown them
selves responsible. Their two
main protest meetings in Union

court display the results of years
of training in a democratic so
ciety.
These meetings embodied the
ideal of a seminar in the best
sense of that word.
The students were orderly, yet
everyone had the opportunity to
speak and disagree; the views ex
pressed were highly intelligent,
even astute, dealing not only with
the problem of Dr. Sibley's non
appointment but also with the
principles involved—the weakness
of the University structure and
possibilities of remedying those
weaknesses.
Most significant, however, was
the sense of humor displayed by
the group; it was a humility, a
form of self-criticism deeply un
derlaid by responsibility.
These students wanted, not a
reversal of the Sibley decision,
but an explanation. A satisfac
tory explanation has still not been
made.
The consideration of Dr. Sibley
for the Political Science Depart
m en t began in the customary
manner: the recommendation
stemming from joint action of
the department and the dean of
the school was handed to the Pres
ident's Office for approval, where
it remained for approximately two
months.

During this time about 300 stu

Dr. Sibley's future by signing a

he was fully aware. It was not

power at the University, stem

Sibley decision by the Univer
sity community and the public
at large.

case as an example.)
(Editor's Note: William Bro
der, u graduate student in the
English Department, will ana

in the Sibley case, and their re
lation to University problems,
in this and other articles of a
series.)
The case of the non-appoint
ment of Mulford Q. Sibley is not
closed, nor will it be closed as long
as a doubt remains in the mind
of one citizen of this community.
If Stanford University purports
to uphold the liberal democratic
tradition of Western culture, it
must recognize that its decision
in this case is open to question,
and it should encourage intelli
gent opposition.
By stating that the case is
closed, and hiding behind what
appears to be a specious secrecy,
the University is setting itself up
as an irresponsible power, a pre
tender to infallibility of decision.
Loses Power
Authority is not buttressed by
wielding it as a club; in fact, by
such means the president loses
his greatest powder —that of com
manding voluntary assent — and
at the same time betrays the fear
that his power might be under
mined.
Decisions need not be put to a
vote. Re-evaluation and revision
are possible without the loss of
authority by convincing the mem
bers of Stanford University that
the Sibley decision is in keeping
with the ultimate goals of that
institution.
This can only be done by mak
ing all the information of this
case accessible to the whole com
munity. Lack of information,
however, is no excuse for inaction
on the part of the members of
the institution.
In view of the information that
the President's Office has seen fit
tf> divulge about the Sibley case
to the community at large, every
responsible citizen of that com
munity should protest both the
decision itself and the manner in
which the entire Sibley affair has
been handled.
While the case is admittedly
unique in recent years, it displays
a basic lack of evaluation of the
goals of this University.
Not Unique
The attitudes revealed by this
situation are not at all unique.
The President's Office has han
dled the students with parental
despotism, either deflecting their
dissatisfaction to irrelevancies or
reminding them that their proper
place is in the classroom and the
playing field rather than as citi
zens of a community.
The faculty has displayed an
apparent ineffectuality; few, if
any, of them have come forth to
challenge or even to openly dis
cuss the problems involved. Those
members of the faculty who have
been questioned by students claim
that they have no information on
the affair.
This can only be interpreted as
an inadequate sense of responsi
bility toward the institution as a
whole; they should have made it
their business to obtain the neces
sary information, and have acted
upon it.
An admittedly small and not
very strong number of students
are the only members of this in
stitution who have shown them
selves responsible. Their two
main protest meetings in Union

court display the results of years
of training in a democratic so
ciety.
These meetings embodied the
ideal of a seminar in the best
sense of that word.
The students were orderly, yet
everyone had the opportunity to
speak and disagree; the views ex
pressed were highly intelligent,
even astute, dealing not only with
the problem of Dr. Sibley's non
appointment but also with the
principles involved—the weakness
of the University structure and
possibilities of remedying those
weaknesses.
Most significant, however, was
the sense of humor displayed by
the group; it was a humility, a
form of self-criticism deeply un
derlaid by responsibility.
These students wanted, not a
reversal of the Sibley decision,
but an explanation. A satisfac
tory explanation has still not been
made.
The consideration of Dr. Sibley
for the Political Science Depart
m en t began in the customary
manner: the recommendation
stemming from joint action of
the department and the dean of
the school was handed to the Pres
ident's Office for approval, where
it remained for approximately two
months.
Sign Petition
During this time about 300 stu
dents indicated their concern for
Dr. Sibley's future by signing a
petition—which was not turned
in to the president, but of which
he was fully aware. It was not
turned in for fear it might be
detrimental to Sibley while his
appointment was still under con
sideration.
Apparently the president did
not feel responsible to the feelings
of this small group, for no ex
planation was made when he de
cided not to hire Dr. Sibley.
In case of appointment, the next
step would have been the submis
sion of the recommendation to the
Advisory Board — a committee
elected from the faculty — and
then on to the Board of Trustees
for final approval.
Under the Articles of Organiza
tion of the Faculty, as revised
Sept. 1, 1957, the president is not
obligated to submit any "execu
tive acts of general importance
such as recommendations for ap
pointments, promotions and dis
missals, for the creation of new
departments or chairs, and for the
abolition of departments or
chairs" to Ihe Advisory Board un
less he wants them approved, with
the one exception of dismissal of
an appointed professor.
Absolute Veto
Thus the president exercises ab
solute veto power on all Univer
sity business, with that one excep
tion.
It may be argued that the Ad
visory Board "may, by a vote of
five of its members, appeal to the
trustees any differences between
the president and itself," but in a
case similar to Sibley's the Ad
visory Board could not be expect
ed to take action because it would
have no information about the af
fair—nor is the president under
any legal obligation to provide
them with such information, any
more than he is to do so to the
students.
It may further be argued that
the Advisory Board "shall have
the power to convene the Aca
demic Council at any time."
However, assuming the Advi

sory Board was alarmed over the
Sibley case and called the Aca
demic Council together, the presi
dent's power is so great in the
council that, should he wish, no
action could be taken.
According to the articles, the
organization of the University has
the deceptive appearance of a con
stitutional democracy, with a sys
tem of checks and balances.
Two Houses
The two houses are: (1) the
administrative committees, ap
pointed directly by the president,
including such crucial committees
as those on Financial Awards,
General Studies, and Research
( Supplementary Research
Grants); (2) the academic com
mittees, including Admissions,
Graduate Study, and Independent
Study.
The chief academic committee
is culled the "Executive Commit
tee of the Academic Council"and
consists of the president, the reg
istrar, the academic secretary and
seven other members—one from
each department grouping on the
faculty.
This committee appoints the
members of all other academic
committees, and, furthermore, the
president appoints "a Dean of
Graduate Study, who shall be ex
officio chairman of the Graduate
Study Committee."
Thus, of the 10 members of the
Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, three owe their
allegiance to the president, as
does the chairman of one of the
most important academic com
mittees.
The Advisory Board, a com
pletely independent body, has the
appearance of a supreme court of
the University, but, as has already
been pointed out, the president is
required only to submit the act
of firing an appointed professor
to them—or, for that matter, to
the Board of Trustees.
There are indications that the
actual working of the University
organization does not exactly fol
low the last-published laws, but
more than a few professors have
indicated that the president has
absolute power in the University.
Aroused Protest
Tt was the exercise of this abso
lute power by the president—in
the face of the recommendations
of the Political Science Depart
ment and the Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences—that
aroused the protest of the stu
dents.
On the whole, students are a
docile lot, willing to believe what
they are told by those they trust.
But it seemed to them that the
department and the dean of the
school should be somewhat trust
worthy in such a case. Their cu
riosity as to why this was not so
seems to be justified.
