Editor, The Daily:
Here in Berkeley we have just been celebrating
Academic Freedom Week. In the spirit of the
occasion I must offer you my warmest congratu
lations for your front page editorial on the denial
by the Stanford administration of an appoint
ment to Dr. Mulford Q. Sibley. It is a fine edi
torial, one of which you may justly be proud now
and when you look back on it in a few years.
I am delighted to learn that you and your fel
low students, as well as members of the Political
Science Department, have recognized so rapidly
the extraordinary quality of Professor Sibley's
mind, his moral courage, and his teaching abili
ties. While this seems very awkward and, in our
day of smooth sophistication, archaic, the obser
vation which most seems to fit him is that he is

a virtuous man. As a student and later a col
league of Professor Sibley at the University of
Minnesota, I was impressed by the almost uni
versal respect he commanded as one of the inde
pendent thinkers and as perhaps the outstanding
lecturer on the faculty of a distinguished institu
tion. Not only you at Stanford but all of us in
this area will be Ihe losers when Minnesota wel
comes him back. I find it difficult not to believe
that Stanford has damaged its reputation by its
mishandling of this proposed appointment.
Nevertheless, it is very encouraging to those
of us who are teachers to learn that students
really are interested in academic freedom. You
are quite light in insisting that possible lapses
in this area concern students.
