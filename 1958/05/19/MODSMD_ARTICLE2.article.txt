# NOSE CONE
## Army Missile Re-entry Test Successful 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/!>)
Another missile age milestone
was passed yesterday when the
Army launched a thundering Ju
piter rocket through space and
recovered its elaborately equip
ped nose cone in the Atlantic
Ocean 4Vi hours later.
It marked the first lime that a
full-scale nose cone the heart of
a ballistic missile tiad been re
trieved intact after apparently
functioning perfectly during its
flight.
The Defense Department an
nounced in Washington that a
preliminary evaluation indicated
I lie re-entry test was a complete
success.
Even though the missile's re
entry course was slighted, the re
covery operation took several
hours.
This was because the waiting
ships usually are some live to 10
miles away from Ihe impact area.
In addition, frogmen check the
cone thoroughly under water for
damage before it is hoisted gently
aboard a ship.
Jupiter, an intermediate range
weapon, surged aloft from the
nation's missile test center with
an ear-splitting roar at 12:06 a.m.
Its fiery ascent illuminated the
Florida coast for miles around.
The mission was to prove the
warhead of a lightning-fast ballis
tic missile can withstand the in
tense friction when it cuts back
from space through the earth's
atmosphere on the final leg of its
trip on target.
The test should give the Army
a final entry to the Jupiter re
entry problem.
