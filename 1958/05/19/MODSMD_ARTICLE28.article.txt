# Cunliffe Best Of Indians at Coliseum Meet
## 
### 
Four Stanford runners came up
with fairly good races, but
against some of the world's finest
performers in Friday's Los Ange
les Coliseum Relays, the show
ings didn't produce any victories.
Ernie Cunliffe looked the best
of the quartet as he ran third in
a blanket-finish 880. As is his
habit, Cunliffe took ihe lead from
the gun.
His first-lap time was a little
slower than he hoped for, but he
came by the 660 mark on schedule
with a blazing 26 for the third
220. Cunliffe held onto his lead
around the final curve and into
the home stretch, but then the
field caught him.
North Carolina's Dave Scur
lock went by first, and won in
1:50.5. Tom Carroll of the Yale
frosh battled Cunliffe all the way
in, and Jim Cerveny of the Oxy
frosh flailed up on the outside.
The judges finally gave Cer
veny second, Cunliffe third and
Carroll fourth. Although official
timers had three-tenths between
second and fourth, Ihe unofficial
consensus was that all three hit
1:50.9.
Chuck Cobb, still in the late re
covery stages from his pneumo
nia bout, got a bad start in the
high hurdles. He came on fast
at the end, but his fourth-place
14.2 was three-tenths behind win
ner Elias Gilbert.
Maury Graves ran one of his
better two-miles of the year, but
his 9:09.1 was good enough for
only fifth. Graves hung near
Alex Henderson for Ihe first mile,
but the 4:27 pace told as Graves
then fell steadily back. Hender
son's winning 8:47.9 was a new
U.S. collegiate record.
Norman Lloyd ran an excellent
1320, but the pace and competi
tion hurt as Lloyd fell back in the
final 440, clocking 4:13 for his
mile.

at the end, but his fourth-place
14.2 was three-tenths behind win
ner Elias Gilbert.
Maury Graves ran one of his
better two-miles of the year, but
his 9:09.1 was good enough for
only fifth. Graves hung near
Alex Henderson for Ihe first mile,
but the 4:27 pace told as Graves
then fell steadily back. Hender
son's winning 8:47.9 was a new
U.S. collegiate record.
Norman Lloyd ran an excellent
1320, but the pace and competi
tion hurt as Lloyd fell back in the
final 440, clocking 4:13 for his
mile.
Four Stanford runners came up
with fairly good races, but
against some of the world's finest
performers in Friday's Los Ange
les Coliseum Relays, the show
ings didn't produce any victories.
Ernie Cunliffe looked the best
of the quartet as he ran third in
a blanket-finish 880. As is his
habit, Cunliffe took ihe lead from
the gun.
His first-lap time was a little
slower than he hoped for, but he
came by the 660 mark on schedule
with a blazing 26 for the third
220. Cunliffe held onto his lead
around the final curve and into
the home stretch, but then the
field caught him.
North Carolina's Dave Scur
lock went by first, and won in
1:50.5. Tom Carroll of the Yale
frosh battled Cunliffe all the way
in, and Jim Cerveny of the Oxy
frosh flailed up on the outside.
The judges finally gave Cer
veny second, Cunliffe third and
Carroll fourth. Although official
timers had three-tenths between
second and fourth, Ihe unofficial
consensus was that all three hit
1:50.9.
Chuck Cobb, still in the late re
covery stages from his pneumo
nia bout, got a bad start in the
high hurdles. He came on fast
at the end, but his fourth-place
14.2 was three-tenths behind win
ner Elias Gilbert.
Maury Graves ran one of his
better two-miles of the year, but
his 9:09.1 was good enough for
only fifth. Graves hung near

but the 4:27 pace told as Graves
