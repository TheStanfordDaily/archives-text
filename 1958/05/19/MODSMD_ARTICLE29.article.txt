Joel Newkirk accounted for two
seventh-inning runs after Stan
ford had loaded the bases. The
rally was halted when Bob
Dwight got thrown out trying to
score from second on Newkirk's
bunt.
In the eighth, singles by Shaw,
Holding and Parker Olsen, plus
doubles by Rodda and Avery,
shoved across the three runs the
Indians needed to win.
After eight masterful innings,
Avery weakened in the ninth.
Pepperdine loaded the bases, and
then Avery walked a run in.
That finished him, and Wil
liams again came in. After a
strikeout, he yielded singles that
made the score 5-4. But with the
tying and go-ahead runs on first
and second, he retired the side on
a routine fly ball.

games remaining.
