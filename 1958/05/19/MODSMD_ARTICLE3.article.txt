# Graham Hits Escapism
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
"The current revival of interest
in religion on the college cam
puses is a natural result of the
changing world conditions and
the pessimism of the modern age
and cannot be correlated with a
specific movement or crusade,"
the Rev. Billy Graham comment
ed in a special interview with The
Daily following his sermon in Me

morial Church yesterday.
In his sermon, entitled "Prob
lems That Science Has Not
Solved," Graham said that the
American people, now at the
highest economic standard in his
tory, have created a new word—
"escapism"—which has resulted
in such effects as dope, drunken
ness and tranquilizers.
Addressing an overflow congre
gation of students, faculty and
area residents, some listening via
loudspeakers in Inner Quad, Gra
ham said there is little wonder
for the mental chaos in the world
today.
"There is neither peace nor the
prospect of peace. Intellectual
thinkers agree that our problems
are beyond us. Scientists jsuch as
Einstein have said that there is
no defense in science today
against the weapons that have
been created.
"The only answer is that given
first by Buddha: a search for
truth."
lie emphasized that though we
cannot prove the existence of God
—"We cannot put God in a test
tube or establish His identity in a
mathematical formula" — faith
goes beyond rationalization. The
creed for which students are
searching may only be found in
Christ.
"If each of you will strike your

match of light for Christ, that
light will spread from person to
person and create a moral and
spiritual power that shall sweep
the country," he concluded.
Asked if he had any plans for a
visit to Russia in the near future,
he replied that "there is nothing
vaguely in the offing."
"I did receive a telegram this
morning from Bob Pierce, my as
sociate who is now in Moscow,
stating that special prayers are
being offered in the Baptist
churches throughout Russia for
the success of the San Francisco
crusade."

"The current revival of interest
