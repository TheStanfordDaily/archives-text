# Bruin, Trojan Net Teams Win Again
## 
### John Schwarz 
Once again the USC and UCLA tennis machines moved into the
Bay Area and cleaned out all of Stanford's upset hopes for anofher
season. The Trojans won a close 6-3 match Friday and the Bruins
took a decisive 8-1 win Saturday.
The USC match produced some very exciting tennis as expected,

with five of the nine matches go
ing three sets. SC got off to a
quick start when their one and
three men, A 1 Olmedo and Ed At
kinson, whipped Stanford's Jack
Douglas and Brooks Rawlins in
straight sets.
Nelson Best
Junior Dave Nelson, who with
out a doubt played Stanford's best
tennis of the weekend, had a real
slugfest with SC's Gordon Davis,
but finally dumped the Trojans'
second man, 6-3, 7-5.
After Nelson's win, the real
truning point of the match oc
curred. Jim Jeffries and Lowell
Carruth of Stanford, in the fourth
and fifth singles spots, both lost
three-set matches which put the
Trojans completely out of grasp.
The first doubles match be
tween Olmedo and Atkinson
against Douglas and Rawlins
kept the fans 00-ing and ah-ing
through 28 games in the first set,
with Olmedo and Atkinson finally
winning, 15-13. With the confi
dence of the first set behind
them, the Trojans ripped off a 6-4
second-set win to ice it.
Only Douglas Wins
Stanford's lone winner Satur
day was Douglas. A little mad
dened from his Friday loss, he
treated the fans to a variety of
ground strokes as he besled UC
LA's surprise first man, John
Lesch, 6-3, 9-7.
Nelson, who played so well Fri
day, gave another good effort
Saturday but couldn't quite give
enough to beat John Cranston.
Rawlins met with misfortune
when he had to face Mike Franks,
still UCLA's best player, in the
third singles. Carruth had a
rough time also as he had to meet
Mike Green. Both Stanford men
were easy victims of UCLA's
aces.
