# Heels, Whites Deadlock
## 
### 
A rrowrl of 3000 saw the Reds
battle Iho Whites to a 21-21 tie at
the Stanford Stadium Saturday
in an intrasquad game that fin
ished up the spring grid practice.
Coach Jack Curtice singled out
Jim Honeywell's punting and cen
ter Doug Pursell's linebacking
for commendation. He was
pleased wilh the performances of
all the quarterbacks—Bob Nico
let and Dick Norm&n for the
Whites, and Sid Garber, Chuck
Butler and Rod Sears for the
Reds— but added that there was
no one standout.
The point after touchdown still
seems to bother Stanford as Cur
tice tried bolh the kick conver
sion and the new two-point run
or pass over-the-goal conversion
after each touchdown. However,

the two teams made only two
kicking conversions in six at
tempts and made the same num
ber via the alternate route. Kirk
Reid did the kicking for both
teams.
The Rods scored first on a de
flected Garber pass to Rick Mc-
Millen. A Butler to J. T. Jones
pass made it 12-0, but then the
Whites came back to take the
lead on touchdowns by end Tim
Alexander, a plunge by Vic Va
glienle, and Wally Honeywell's
14-yard run.
Both conversions were good,
making the score 21-12. Jim By
rer led a return Red drive in the
fourth period which culminated
in a touchdown and three points'
worth of conversions that pro
duced the final tie score.
