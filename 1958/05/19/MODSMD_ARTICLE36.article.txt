# RUSSIAN CLASSIC
## Asiatic, Slavic Studies, 'Sequoia' to Sponsor Film 
### Terry Rentz 
Sequoia magazine and the De
partment of Asiatic and Slavic
Studies are co-sponsoring a free
showing of Sergei Eisenstein's
classic Russian film "Alxander
Nevsky" Wednesday at 7:3U p.m.
in Cubberley Auditorium.
The movie was made in 1938
with the intention of arousing
Russian nationalism in prepara
tion for defense against Nazi Ger
many. The story is based on an

invasion of Russia by the knights
of the Teutonic Order in the 13th
century and their repulse by the
Russian people united under their
heroic prince, Alexander Nevsky.
The gory two and a quarter
hours climaxes with the famous
Battle on the Ice, supposedly pat
terned on the battle in heaven in
Milton's "Paradise Lost." This
scene was shot in July heat, with
ice made of asphalt, water glass,
white sand and chalk, constructed
so that it could sink (at will) into
the lake with its load of German
knights.
Sergei Prokofiev wrote the mu
sic for the film, working closely
with Eisenstein. It has since been
recorded as the "Alexander Nev
sky Cantata." The sound track is
in Russian, but there are English
subtitles.
The title role is filled by Niko
lai Cherkassov, who at the time
was the Leningrad representative
to the Supreme Soviet. Photogra
phy is by Eduard Tisse.
