# Students Probe Teacher Evaluation
## 
### Wally Simpson 
(Editor's Note: This is llie
fifth in a series of articles cov
ering" a panel discussion held a
week ago today between stu
dents and faculty members on
the question of research versus
teaching as criteria for faculty
appointments.)

Simpson: "Dr. Terman stated 4
that the qualifications for a Stan
ford faculty member are based
upon both scholarship and teach
ing. What methods did you use
to evaluate the teaching ability
of Dr. Sibley? Exactly what cri
teria do you u-se to evaluate teach
ing?"
Terman: (Answer off the rec
ord).
Broiise: "Why is it not good to
talk about this in the open?"
Terman: "In some cases people
attempt to use teaching as a sub
stitute for scholarship. These are
the people who give us the great
bother around the University, peo
ple who are pretty fair teachers
but not outstanding scholars."
Draper: "I want to read a quo
tation from the Study of Under
graduate Education: 'An undue!

amount of poor and incompetent I
teaching is done ... by members
of the faculty who are recognized
and perhaps distinguished in oth
er areas of professional interest.
" 'It is simply a fact that the
teaching of many able men is dis
tinctly poor. Some, perhaps a ma
jority, of these able men are not
really college teachers at all. how
ever competent they may be in
conducting research and in guid
ing graduate students.'
"Is the central emphasis on re
search rather than on teaching at
Stanford?"
Walker: :, This report was pre

pared as a very frank statement
of our strengths and weaknesses.
I repeat what I said before—that
we recognize the state of the prob
lem here. The University is pre
pared to recognize distinguished
teaching and has stated that this
report has been written for our
purposes.
"One of the things that happens
in a university—and this happens
anywhere—people are often pro
posed for promotion because of
personal attachments, because
they are hard workers and cooper
ative in the department; so that
people who are not distinguished

teachers are advanced.
"One of our problems at Stan
ford until a half-dozen years ago
was that there were not enough
reviews of these proposed ap
pointments and promotions ;it the
top level. Those universities of
the highest reputation arc those
in which the top administration is
the most effective in reviewing
proposed tenure appointments."

(Editor's Note: This is llie
fifth in a series of articles cov
ering" a panel discussion held a
week ago today between stu
dents and faculty members on
the question of research versus
teaching as criteria for faculty
appointments.)

Simpson: "Dr. Terman stated 4
that the qualifications for a Stan
ford faculty member are based
upon both scholarship and teach
ing. What methods did you use
to evaluate the teaching ability
of Dr. Sibley? Exactly what cri
teria do you u-se to evaluate teach
ing?"
Terman: (Answer off the rec
ord).
Broiise: "Why is it not good to
talk about this in the open?"
Terman: "In some cases people
attempt to use teaching as a sub
stitute for scholarship. These are
the people who give us the great
bother around the University, peo
ple who are pretty fair teachers
but not outstanding scholars."
Draper: "I want to read a quo
tation from the Study of Under
graduate Education: 'An undue!

amount of poor and incompetent I
teaching is done ... by members
of the faculty who are recognized
and perhaps distinguished in oth
er areas of professional interest.
" 'It is simply a fact that the
teaching of many able men is dis
tinctly poor. Some, perhaps a ma
jority, of these able men are not
really college teachers at all. how
ever competent they may be in
conducting research and in guid
ing graduate students.'
"Is the central emphasis on re
search rather than on teaching at
Stanford?"
Walker: :, This report was pre

pared as a very frank statement
of our strengths and weaknesses.
I repeat what I said before—that
we recognize the state of the prob
lem here. The University is pre
pared to recognize distinguished
teaching and has stated that this
report has been written for our
purposes.
"One of the things that happens
in a university—and this happens
anywhere—people are often pro
posed for promotion because of
personal attachments, because
they are hard workers and cooper
ative in the department; so that
people who are not distinguished

teachers are advanced.
"One of our problems at Stan
ford until a half-dozen years ago
was that there were not enough
reviews of these proposed ap
pointments and promotions ;it the
top level. Those universities of
the highest reputation arc those
in which the top administration is
the most effective in reviewing
proposed tenure appointments."
