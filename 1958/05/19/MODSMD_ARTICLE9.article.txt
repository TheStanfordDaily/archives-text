# 26th ANNUAL CONFERENCE
## 'Time for Reappraisal,' President Tells Alumni 
### 
Reports by President Wallace
Sterling and other faculty mem
bers on national and international
problems were the feature attrac
tions of last weekend's 2Gth an
nual alumni conference.
Over 1500 alumni, dating back
to the class of 1892, participated
in the weekend of lectures, social
activities, alumni meetings and
reunions.
In his keynote address, Presi
dent Sterling stressed that now
was the "time for reappraisal of
national values in the concepts of
human dignity and freedom."
He cited the fact that Ameri
cans pay more for alcohol, tobac
co and recreation than they do
for education. Consequently they
are "starving their prime source
of leadership and prosperity."
Sterling dealt with the problem
of increased enrollment in the na
tion's universities and the conse
quent problems of finance, admis

sion standards and qualifications
of faculty members.
Sterling questioned Ihe alumni
delegates as to whether "all those
to whom college doors were open
had the proper ability, incentive
and preparation." A recent sur
vey taken by Stanford showed a
great variety in entrance qualifi
cations, with some requiring only
a high school credential, in tax
supported colleges.
He said the present increase in
enrollment will mean doubling
the number of teachers in the
country. Teachers he said are the
"group who have produced and
will continue to prouce the knowl
edge for this country's progress,
for its prosperity and for its de
fenses." To attract qualified
teachers their present salaries
should be raised.
Preceding the luncheon Fred
Rohrnert, '33, was elected presi
dent of the Alumni Association
succeeding retiring president
John Robert White, '25. Other of
ficers elected were Milton Teague,
first vice-president, and Lucy Lit
ter, second vice-president.
Newly elected members of the
Alumni Executive Board were
Otis Chandler, Gardiner Symonds,
Katharine Kennedy Bidwell, Gor
don Hampton. Ivan C. Heron and
Marion R. .Reich.

Reports by President Wallace
Sterling and other faculty mem
bers on national and international
problems were the feature attrac
tions of last weekend's 2Gth an
nual alumni conference.
Over 1500 alumni, dating back
to the class of 1892, participated
in the weekend of lectures, social
activities, alumni meetings and
reunions.
In his keynote address, Presi
dent Sterling stressed that now
was the "time for reappraisal of
national values in the concepts of
human dignity and freedom."
He cited the fact that Ameri
cans pay more for alcohol, tobac
co and recreation than they do
for education. Consequently they
are "starving their prime source
of leadership and prosperity."
Sterling dealt with the problem
of increased enrollment in the na
tion's universities and the conse
quent problems of finance, admis

sion standards and qualifications
of faculty members.
Sterling questioned Ihe alumni
delegates as to whether "all those
to whom college doors were open
had the proper ability, incentive
and preparation." A recent sur
vey taken by Stanford showed a
great variety in entrance qualifi
cations, with some requiring only
a high school credential, in tax
supported colleges.
He said the present increase in
enrollment will mean doubling
the number of teachers in the
country. Teachers he said are the
"group who have produced and
will continue to prouce the knowl
edge for this country's progress,
for its prosperity and for its de
fenses." To attract qualified
teachers their present salaries
should be raised.

dent of the Alumni Association

ter, second vice-president.
