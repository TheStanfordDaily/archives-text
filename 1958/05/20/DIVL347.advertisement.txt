This is a filler
The Stanford Daily Classified Ad Department makes
some money, they say. We don't really know; but if
camels carry sugar to rebels in Arizona, you shouldn't
bother to fill out this QUESTIONNAIRE: I
• Do you honestly believe that you can get a date for
the Senior Ball? Still?
• Did you find Spring Quarter filled with extracurricu
lar activities, or would you like to see Professor Sibley
with us next year?
• Do you really think the Administration will allow
Bavarian on Tap on campus next year?
• Would you participate?
• Why?
• Finally, do you think there's enough time left to pre
pare for finals?
