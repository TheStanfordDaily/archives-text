# Doctors Enact Unusual 5 Year Med Program
## 
### 
A revolutionary plan to give more emphasis to broad education in
the humanities for pre-med students was overwhelmingly approved
by the faculty of the Stanford Medical School last night.
The school's new dean, Dr. Robert Alway, explained that the pro
posed curriculum revisions would work in this manner:

For the first three years of
medical school, students would
spend one-half of their time on
non-medical courses—such as the
humanities, sciences related to
medicine and the behavioral sci
ences.
Also, medical students would
be introduced to clinical prob
lems in.their first year, he said.
Under the present setup, they
complete nearly two years of
study before they are able to
work with the human cadaver.
Alway Favors
Dr. Alway said he personally
favors this earlier introduction to
such training because the first
two years of medical school are
often considered an "obstacle
course" of laboratory ocurses in
such subjects as anatomy and
physiology.
"This has meant an avoidance
of human beings," he said. "It's
all been theory and laboratory
work. This change would put
them in touch with the problems
of a doctor and his patients much
sooner."
"It's foolish for the medical
school not to take advantage of
all the Stanford facilities," Alway
said. "The campus should pro
vide a stimulating and exciting
environment for the medical stu
dent."
Five-Year Program
Under the present plan, most
students are accepted to med
school after four college years,
and they continue their studies
for four additional years.
Under the new Stanford plan,
the majority of students will be
accepted after three college years
into a five-year medical school
program.
It is also possible for students
to be accepted into the new plan
after four college years, and
those doing so will be working
toward their master's as well as
their M.D. degree.
The change will go into effect
in the fall of 1959. This will co
incide with the opening of the $22
million Stanford Medical Center
in Palo Alto.

lems in.their first year, he said.
Under the present setup, they
complete nearly two years of
study before they are able to
work with the human cadaver.
Alway Favors
Dr. Alway said he personally
favors this earlier introduction to
such training because the first
two years of medical school are
often considered an "obstacle
course" of laboratory ocurses in
such subjects as anatomy and
physiology.
"This has meant an avoidance
of human beings," he said. "It's
all been theory and laboratory
work. This change would put
them in touch with the problems
of a doctor and his patients much
sooner."
"It's foolish for the medical
school not to take advantage of
all the Stanford facilities," Alway
said. "The campus should pro
vide a stimulating and exciting
environment for the medical stu
dent."
Five-Year Program
Under the present plan, most
students are accepted to med
school after four college years,
and they continue their studies
for four additional years.
Under the new Stanford plan,
the majority of students will be
accepted after three college years
into a five-year medical school
program.
It is also possible for students
to be accepted into the new plan
after four college years, and
those doing so will be working
toward their master's as well as
their M.D. degree.
The change will go into effect
in the fall of 1959. This will co
incide with the opening of the $22
million Stanford Medical Center
in Palo Alto.
A revolutionary plan to give more emphasis to broad education in
the humanities for pre-med students was overwhelmingly approved
by the faculty of the Stanford Medical School last night.
The school's new dean, Dr. Robert Alway, explained that the pro
posed curriculum revisions would work in this manner:

For the first three years of
medical school, students would
spend one-half of their time on
non-medical courses—such as the
humanities, sciences related to
medicine and the behavioral sci
ences.
Also, medical students would
be introduced to clinical prob
lems in.their first year, he said.
Under the present setup, they
complete nearly two years of
study before they are able to
work with the human cadaver.
