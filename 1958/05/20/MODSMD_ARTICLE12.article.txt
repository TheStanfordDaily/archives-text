# Pole Explorer To Address Tuesday Series
## 
### 
Robert A. Hslliwell, a pioneer
in establishing radio equipment
at the South Pole, will give an il
lustrated talk on his recent trip
to the Pole in Memorial Audito
rium tonight at 7:30 as part of
the Tuesday Evening Series.
Professor Helliwell, Stanford
radio engineer, left just before
Christmas last year for Antarc
tica to set up his special radio sig
nal equipment at Byrd Station,
600 miles east of Little America,
as part of Stanford's contribution
to the International Geophysical
Year.
His radio receivers calibrate
and analyze the mysterious "whis
tlers" of outer spaceâ€”naturally
caused radio signals generated by
lightning.
At the South Pole, he found
that the "whistles" penetrate as
far as 20,000 miles into space be
fore bouncing back to earth along
the lines of magnetic force which
girdle the planet.
A Stanford alumnus, Helliwell
said Antarctic cold was nothing
compared to the enforced idle
ness, monotony and boredom that
South Pole duty means.
