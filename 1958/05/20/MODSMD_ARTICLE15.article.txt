# De Gaulle Wants Extensive Powers
## Desires to Keep Algeria Criticizes Party System 
### 
PARIS (/P) —General Charles de Gaulle yesterday renounced any
role of dictator but said he would require extraordinary powers if
he took the helm of government.
"I am a man alone," de Gaulle asserted, "because I am tied to
no party nor to any organization. ... I am a man who belongs to

no one and who belongs to every
one."
Shrugging aside a question on
public liberties, the general asked:
"Have I ever attacked funda
mental public liberties? No, I re
stored them when they had disap
peared. How would you have me,
at 67, start a career as dictator?"
Algeria Policy
De Gaulle was asked a general
question on what he would do in
Algeria—in the nationalist rebel
lion situation now complicated by
the French military-colonialist re
bellion against Premier Pierre
Pflimlin's Paris government. He
replied:
"I envisage the case where the
French people might ask me to
act as an arbitrator," he replied.
He declared Algeria must be
kept from separating from
France—"something which Alge
ria does not want, nor France
either."
He declared the French politi
cal party system "is not solving
and will not solve the enormous
problems confronting us."
After his statement General de
Gaulle and his wife returned to
their country home.
Political Ferment
1-Ie left: political ferment behind
him in Paris.
To demonstrate its opposition,
organized labor slowed or stopped
Paris subways, buses and produc
tion lines in factories. This was
in response to a call by the Com
munists, who depict de Gaulle as
striving for one-man rule.
Immediate reaction among
French politicians was that the
general's declaration was moder
ate. But deputies, following the
port of his news conference, re
mained suspicious of his inten
tions. The "exceptional proce
dure" he asked for did not seem
compatible for investiture under
the existing form, where a major
ity of deputies must vote in a new
premier.
Other Impediments
There were other impediments.
Premier Pierre Pflimlin's govern
ment is still in office and shows
no immediate signs of quitting,
although many urged it to do so.
Any victory of de Gaulle at this
stage would be bound to be con
sidered victory for the rebellious
French generals in Algeria.
But it might not need any de
cision on Pflimlin's part to open
a way for de Gaulle. He could be
defeated on a parliamentary con
fidence vote like most of the oth
er 24 postwar governments pre
ceding him.
And the weapon was ready at
hand. Pflimlin must seek from
the National Assembly today an
extension of the emergency pow
ers needed to counter the Moslem
nationalist uprising in Algeria.
Each new government must have
these renewed within 10 days o£
taking office.
