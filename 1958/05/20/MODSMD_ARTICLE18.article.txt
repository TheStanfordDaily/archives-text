# 'TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Days of Trouble 
### Walter Lippmann 
Now that the Vice President and his wife are
hack home, and all the official regrets and apolo
gies have been received and accepted, the imme
diate question before us is how it happened that
the Nixons were exposed to these outrages. It is
manifest that the whole South American tour
was misconceived, that it was planned by men
who did not know what was the state of mind in
the cities the Vice President was to visit. For
what has happened should never have been al
lowed to happen, and those who are responsible
for the management of our relations with South
America must answer to the charge of gross
incompetence.
It is essential that this charge he investigated
either by the Foreign Relations Committee of
the Senate or, perhaps preferably, hy a panel id'
specially qualified private citizens. VVe must fix
and we must correct the causes which led our
officials into this fiasco —into what it would not
he exaggeration to call a diplomatic Pearl Harbor.
Unless and until this is done, there is no chance
that we shall profit by the lessons of this bitter
experience. VVe must know why the planners of
the trip were so ignorant—so ignorant about so
many countries, so ignorant of what it is suitable
and what it is not suitable for the Vice President
of the United States to do when he goes abroad.
Before we can do anything to improve our
position in Latin America, we must deal with
those who have made such a mess of our position.

It is almost certainly a coincidence that simul
taneously there are crises in Lebanon and in
Algeria, and that in each there have been violent
manifestations against the United States. In
South America the hostility that has been shown
is directed primarily at our own acts of omission
and commission. In Lebanon and in Algeria we
are not principals but are entangled in the quar
rels of others.
About Lebanon the evidence is not clear, but
there are grounds for suspecting that there are

Syrians and Egyptians who are intervening in a
bitter internal struggle which centers on the re
election of President Chamoun. There are reports
that as many as 500 have infiltrated themselves
into Lebanon. The violence they are perpetuating
has a strong resemblance to the raids—for the
present suspended—against Israel.
So far as we are concerned, it is clear enough
that the Eisenhower Doctrine —which has a lot
of fine print underneath its resounding declara
tions —does not apply. The Lebanese case is one
for the United Nations; it may be for a special
session of the General Assembly.

The events in Algeria are the most important
of all. They may well be the central crisis in the
North African story, the crisis which leads either
to catastrophe or to the beginning of recovery.
Until now there has never been a government in
Paris which was strong enough to win the Al
gerian war or strong enough to negotiate a
settlement of the war. The center parties in
France, which lie between the Communists on
the left and the semi-Fascists on the right, have
befcn paralyzed by a very powerful minority com
posed of the French settlers in Algeria, the vested
interests in France which do business there, and
portions of the French army.
In the present crisis, the adventurous and ex
tremist wing of this minority have seized power
in Algeria and are attempting to impose their
Algerian policy on the government in Paris. It is
hard to see bow this issue can be compromised—
as it was a little while ago when the Tunisian
town of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef was bombed and the
Paris government <1 id not dare to disavow the act.
For then the defiance of the French government
was concealed; now the defiance is open and
avowed.
So there is at issue now the sovereignty of the
French Republic.
