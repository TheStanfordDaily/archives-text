20 Yards to Pick a Crape
Editor, The Daily:
Someone in Ihe Administration must have a
special place in his heart for Stanford's old nick
name "The Farm." lie, or they, have placed
Stanford's new German experiment on a farm.
Driving or walking when the snows of winter
are not cleared off the mile and a half up the
steep, twisting, one-lane dirt road from Beutels
bach, the students will find themselves on the top
of a hill, with vineyards climbing steeply down
either side. The 63 students will be well able to
build their little "Stanford in Germany," immu
nized completely in an "atmosphere conducive to
study."
Beutelsbach, the population center of Stan
ford's experiment in cultural living abroad, is a
typical German wine-locale of about 5000 people.
It has its points of interest: if the Stanfordites
wish to climb down their mile and a half of road
or vineyards, they can congregate in one of the
many taverns (there is no age limit, as we know
it, here) and discuss peasant life over Ihe possible
saving grace of good 10-cent glasses of beer.
Or maybe one of the school's two Volkswagen
buses will offer transportation to the bar.
The Landgut-Burg was previously occupied by
n German language school for foreigners. The
director at that time told me he had closed the

school in Eeutelsbach because Ihere had been no
chance for the students to comc in contact with
the German population, due to the location of the
Landgut.
On the other hand, the Landgut's owner said
she had asked the school to leave because the stu
dents were too destructive. Maybe ihey were
.just bored.
Stuttgart lies a half-hour from Beutelsbach,
Tubingen about an hour and a half. Of interest
to engineering students is that there is no uni
versity in Stuttgart, but a "Technische Hoch
schule," or technical institute, which has little
in common with German universities.
Also, Stuttgart is often considered by German
students to be a "provincial city" in spite of its
size. Of interest to liberal arts students is the
distance to the Eberhard-Karls University in Tu
bingen and ihe frequency of "exchanges" with
its students.
Of interest to German students is the 33 to 30
ratio at Beutelsbach and its effect on the isola
tion of the Stanford community in Europe.
In any case, the Stanfordites will have a good
view over the very prelty Remstal from the new
classroom building and will need to walk but 20
yards to pick a grape.
