# Sterling's Veto Power 'Absolute'

structure of Stanford's admin
istration.)

The exercise of the president's
absolute veto power on the nomi
nation of Mulford Q. Sibley has
aroused student protest, and it
might be well to examine the
founding documents of the Uni
versity to determine whether the
exercise of this power is in ac
cordance with the spirit of the
founders.
The Founding Grant and two
subsequent amendments by Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford indicate a
strong belief in the absolute pow
er of the president, controlled
only by his responsibility to the
Board of Trustees.
Policy Modification
However, in Mrs. Stanford's
third, and last, amendment she
saw fit to modify this policy con
siderably :
"The Board of Trustees should
adopt such a plan for the nomi
nation and appointment of pro
fessors and teachers, and the de
termination of their salaries, as
experience of this and similar in
stitutions may prove to be desir
able. During my administration
the President of the University
shall continue to have the exclu
sive control over the appointment
and dismissal of professors and
teachers, as he had heretofore."
"Highest Wisdom"
A careful reading of the suc
cessive amendments to the Found
ing Grant will reveal Mrs. Stan
ford to have been a woman of the
highest wisdom, willing to learn—
from the actual operation of the
University—that the well-motivat
ed prejudices of the founders of
an institution cannot be perpetu
ated. but that the spirit can.
The following quotation ap
pears at least twice in the later
amendment:
"Inasmuch as it was the para
mount purpose of the Founders
of Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity to promote the public wel
fare by founding, endowing and
having maintained a University
. . . all other directions or reser
vations in the Founding Grant
and all amendments or attempted
amendments thereof by the Foun
ders, or by all survivors of them,
shall be deemed incidental and
subordinate to that paramount
purpose. . .
Trustees Implement Will
On March 30, 1906, the trustees
implemented Mrs. Stanford's last
directions in the following man
ner [boldfacing is Broder'sJ:
"Whereas, it is desirable that
all nominations for appointments
and promotions of members of
the teaching staff at the Univer
sity and all recommendations for
dismissals be made by or through
the President of the University,
the Board of Trustees taking no
initiative in these matters; and
"Whereas, it is undesirable that
either the power of appointment
or of removal should vest abso
lutely in the hands of a single
person, it is resolved and agreed
by the Board of Trustees and the
President of Leland Stanford Jun
ior University that so long as
nominations for appointments and
promotions of members of the
teaching .staff at the University
are made by or through the Presi
dent of the University, no dismis
sals shall be made without the
concurrence of a majority of the
Trustees, at which a quorum shall
be present."
Motivation
Unquestionably the central mo
tivation of this resolution was the
fear of centralization of power "in
the hands, of a single individual."
It has already been pointed out

that the present University organ
ization is in accordance with this
resolution regarding the removal
of an appointed professor.
Legally, the case of the non
appointment of Mulford Sibley
would not fall under this resolu
tion, which deals only with ap
pointments.
However, it is not farfetched to
interpret the phrase "power of
appointment" to include the ir
revocable veto of a nomination
made by the Political Science De
partment and the Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
President's Obligations
In an analysis of the organiza
tion of Stanford, it is crucial to
understand that the president is,
by the present laws, obligated to
submit only those "executive
acts" to the trustees that he wants
approved, with the single excep
tion of the removal of an appoint
ed professor.
This deprives the trustees of
any effectual control of the Uni
versity by channeling all Univer
sity information and controversy
through one man.
Difficult to Justify
Nevertheless, even if the presi
dent is legally justified in his ac
tion, upon careful reconsideration
he will find it difficult to justify
the attitude and action of his of
fice subsequent to the Sibley de
cision.
This is not a question of mo
live; Ihere would be no reason for
the president to take any action
which would not, in his opinion,
be for the good of the University.
The two principal actions that
broke the will of the students in
this case were: (1) the taking of
five students into confidence and
revealing secret material to them;
(2) the calling of a closed meeting
to discuss "Teaching versus Re
search," at which meeting certain
remarks were made "off the rec
ord."
There is no doubt these actions
were taken in good faith as an
honest attempt to deal with the
students as responsible adults.
However, there is something in
trinsically destructive of moral
fiber in the confidential appeal to
loyalty and the diversion of jus
tified protest onto an admittedly
crucial, but so far irrelevant, sub
ject.
One Interpretation
In view of the information the
president has seen fit 1o divulge
to the rest of the University com
munity, there is but one possible
interpretation that can be made.
It must be supposed—not only
by the University community but
by every prospective professor
and student of this University,

and by the public at large—that
Mulford Sibley was dismissed be
cause of his active and outspoken
political life.
It was not merely that he is a
Socialist but that he is an active
Socialist; not only that he is
against further H-bomb testing
but that he has actively campaign
ed for the banning of the H-bomb.
Careful Examination
Presumably Dr. Sibley's history,
character and achievements, both
as scholar and as teacher, were
all carefully examined before he
was asked to come to this Univer
sity for a year's trial period.
Presumably his own depart
ment and the Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences felt
that his qualifications as scholar
and teacher were all that could
be desired.
The president could be expected
to be the most responsible judge
of the effect of Dr. Sibley's ap
pointment on the reputation of
the school as a whole.
No Question
If one examines ihe opinions
not only of Dr. Sibley's colleagues
and his students at this Univer
sity but also the opinions of his

colleagues and students of years
past, there appears to be no ques
tion concerning his character.
The president must have felt
that the outspoken political life
of Dr. Sibley was not in keeping
with the tradition of Stanford or
with its present character.
Faculty Not Outspoken
Today this is a perfectly true
statement: Stanford does not
have an outspoken faculty, either
in terms of administrative policies
or national politics; and Stanford
has a long tradition of professo
rial tact and decorum in these
fields dating back to specific re
marks by Mrs. Stanford on this
subject.
It is open to question whether
this condition is in accordance
with the "paramount purposes of
the Founders."
