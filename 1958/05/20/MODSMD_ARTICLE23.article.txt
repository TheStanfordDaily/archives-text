which will compete in Ihe Pacific Coast Conference championship
meet Friday and Saturday at California's Edwards Field oval.

events. ' I* ■
Biggest news from the announcement is that Norman Lloyd will

run in both the 880 and mile. Ear
lier speculation was that Stan
ford's Canadian distance star
would go in only one of the two
races.
No Word on Bowden
There's still no definite word
from Calif or n i a concerning
whether or not Don Bowden will
be in both races. He's a sure
starter in the 880, however.
Lloyd will be the only Indian
scheduled to triple, adding a relay
leg to his other two races. There's
a chance Dick Lassen will go in
the 440, 880 and relay, but the
odds are against his running the
two-lapper.
Seven others will be in two
events, with Don Chesarek anoth
er two • event possibility. His
pulled muscle still isn't complete
ly healed, so he may be saved for
otdy the relay.
