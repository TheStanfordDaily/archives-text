# Indians Host Cal; Fight for Second in CIBA
## 
### 
The final Big Game of the baseball season and a red-hot battle for
second plate in the CIBA will be on tap today at 3:15 p.m. when
Stanford and California meet in the Sunken Diamond.
Dutch Fehring's Indians go into their third-from-last loop tilt at
6-7; George Wolfman's Bears are 8-7, and it's their final CIBA game

of the year. Stanford winds up
its season Friday and Saturday
against Santa Clara, so Ihe Tribe
will need victories in all three
games if it is to grab off the sec
ond spot undisputed.
Bob Leopold, the only Tribe
hurler who has mastered the
Bears this year, will go for Stan
ford. Dave Draheim, the husky
right-hander who mastered Stan
ford late last month, will go for
Cal.
One Good, One Bad
Leopold has had one good and
one bad performance against the
Bears this season after his two
victories of last year. It took him
eight days to gain a 14-inning 6-1

victory, but only an hour and one
half to lose a 6-3 decision.
April 25, Leopold was touched
for an unearned run, then shut
out Cal for 12 innings as the two
clubs fought to a 1-1 tie that was
halted by darkness.
When the game was resumed
May 2, the Indians got five runs
for Leopold and he hold Cal score
less in the bottom of the 14th for
the victory.
Leopold kept right on pitching
in the regularly-scheduled game
of the 2nd, but he wasn't too ef
fective as Cal pounded him for
five runs on eight hits, all hough
only three of the tallies were
earned.
Nothing Earned
Draheim opposed Leopold in
that game, and all three of the
runs he gave up were unearned,
although he was in trouble almost
every inning. Cal also won a May
3 game, 6-4.
Ralph Holding continues to
lead Stanford hitters who have
played regularly all season with
a .327 mark. Rut of the relative
newcomers, Dick Williams at .370
and Harry Rodda at .345 are out
in front.
The runs-batted-in leader is still
A 1 Shaw, who has chased across
34. Shaw also leads the home-run
hitters with five —three of which
have sailed out of the Sunken
Diamond.
