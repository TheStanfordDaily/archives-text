# Frosh to Host Hypnotic Act
## 
### 
For the first time, in many
years, a hynotist will visit the
campus to put on his show at
Memorial Auditorium May 29 and
30.
The show will be sponsored by
the class of 1961. Tickets will go
on sale early next week with
three price ranges: 75 cents for
frosh class card holders, $1 for
upper classes and $1.25 for oth
ers. Tickets will be available for
Peninsula residents the third day
of the sale.
The hypnotist, Dr. Zarro, has
presented his show in most parts
of the nation, and last year gave
a show on Treasure Island which
attracted 5000 customers.
He will demonstrate a type of
subliminal perception and will
put a person in a hypnotic state
during which the volunteer's body
will be made rigid enough to sup
port a heavy weight.
