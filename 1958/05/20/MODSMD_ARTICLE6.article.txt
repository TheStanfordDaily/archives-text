In a regular weekly meeting
last night at the Beta Theta Chi
house the Interfraternity Council
discussed alternates to the pro
posed fraternity cluster plan.
According to Neal Seheidell,
IFC president, Dean of Men Wil
liam Craig told the IFC in a con
ference yesterday that the door
is not closed to economically feas
ible alternatives to the cluster
housing plan.
Representatives from the IFC
and Wilbur Head Sponsor Dwight

time this week to discuss specific
plans. The fraternities hope that
a compromise plan might be
found by which individual houses
may be retained without sacrific

four-house clusters.
In other business (he IFC dis
cussed plans for next year's IFC
Dance, rushing plans for next
