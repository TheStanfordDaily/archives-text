# PCC ACTION
## Washington, SC Eligible For Roses 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore. (A 3 )- Wash
ington and Southern California
were forgiven for their athletic
sins yesterday by the Pacific
Coast Conference and returned to
good standing—an action which
makes their football teams eligi
ble for the Rose Bowl in 1959.
UCLA, which drew a three-year
probation for similar offenses,
must remain outside the pale for
another season .
All three were placed on proba
tion in 1956 for illegal payments
to athletes. The two forgiven
schools, however, still must re
ceive approval of their return to
grace from the National Colle
giate Athletic Association.
After the conference acted in
1956, the NCAA also placed the
pair on probation — Washington
until August, USC until Novem
ber, 1958. The conference will ask
the NCAA to approve the action.
Still a knotty problem facing
the conference at this spring
meeting is how to pick the 1960
Rose Bowl team and how to cut
up the game's financial melon.
The conference still holds a
contract to provide teams to meet
the Big Ten representative in
1959 and 1960.
Eight teams, exclusive of UC
LA, will be eligible in the 1959
game. Only six will be eligible in
1960 unless the conference makes
some provision to consider the
three withdrawing schools—Cal,
USC and UCLA.
