# Premier Pflimlin Granted Power to Oppose Algerians

### 
PARIS (/I 5 ) —Premier Pierre
Pflimlin last night bolstered his
hand at the helm of France with
a ringing parliamentary triumph
over the challenging but numeri
cally thin forces of Charles de
(Jaulle.
The National Assembly voted
Pflimlin special emergency pow
ers to fight the Algerian national
ist rebellion.
But, paradoxically, Algeria re
mained in the firm grip of mili
tary-colonialist forces, opposed to
the Pflimlin government.
And the military commander at
Algiers—dictator over the whole
great French North African re
gion—got a new endorsement of
faith from Pflimlin.
Thus the French on tho Euro
pean side of the Mediterranean
were firmly under civil and quasi
military control of the Paris gov
ernment.
Against Paris
The French across the sea in
North Africa wore in rebellion
against Paris and in tho midst of
the 3 Vy-year-old Algerian national
ist rebellion—also against Paris
rule.
The Assembly vote was 745 to
100. It was the premier's best
showing yet in a busy and turbu
lent six days in office. Together
with the special state of emer
gency powers he wields in France
itself, it left Pflimlin in a stronger
position than any other post war
premier.
Virtually all the right-of-center
Independent Republicans voted
for Pflimlin. The Communists did
too, although he has said he
spurns their support. Only the
Gaullists, the extreme right Pou
jadists and a handful of others
opposed him.
In a statement just before the
vote. Pflimlin made clear that he
would leave the application of the
special powers in the hands of
Gen. Raoul Salan, commander in
chief in Algeria, at least for the
time being.
No Change
He said the Cabinet has no in
tention of changing the army's
present control of Algeria.
So far as General Salan's per
sonal role is concerned, he said, it
is too early to pass any judgment.
