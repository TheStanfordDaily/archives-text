The University of Cincinnati News Record col
umnist Aliceann George tells about a fellow stu
dent who recently returned from Texas. There
she saw many Fords with the sign: "This Ford
w;*s made in Texas by Texans."
This was topped, Miss George says, by a Volks
wagen in Cincinnati with the notice: "This Volks
wagen was made in der Black Forest by der
elves."

Weber College Signpost editors view with
alarm the new design of the chemise. They pro
did at the Ogdcn, Utah, school a "mass termina
tion of the education of many talented males" if
their coed classmates persist in wearing outfits
making them look like "stovepipes with hair."
No comment.

Dr. Edward Teller, "father of the H-bomb," is
reported by the Reserve Tribune, Western Re
serve University, to have said, "Whoever is fore
most in the world of science, their way will be
the world's way."
"Russian children have a very real incentive
for becoming scientists," he said. "Only in the

scientific field can thoy be reasonably certain of
comfort, security and respect."
In America, Dr. Teller contrasted, children
learn education is boring, illogical and difficult.
Football offers many more tangible rewards than
does science.
There may well be a terrible truth in Dr. Tel
ler's words.

Kay Mullen recently did an article on "Women's
Colleges on Way Out?" She notes that statisti
cians have predicted that women's colleges are
on their way out as the result of "fuel-injection,
TV teachers, nuclear trains and a trillion-dollar
economy—a general face-lifting."
The Rev. Gerald Desmond, a sociology teacher,
countered by saying that "Women aren't about
to give up their colleges. They like them. Their
parents like them. Women enjoy being exclu
sive."
Persona] note: College women won't have to
worry about getting the MRS in the future ei
ther. There will still be one million more men
than women between 20 and 24 in the 1980's.
