Intuition Is Intellection
Editor, The Daily:
I hog of you the opportunity to correct an error
made in my talk on the San Francisco renais
sance on the Stanford campus.
In describing aesthetics as specifically intui
tional, the ecstatic nature of this act led me to
speak of it as a mode of volition rather than of
intellection. This is not so. Intuition is actually
the highest mode of intellection, though its term
is indeed ecstasy, a going out of oneself, a union
between the soul and the participated beatitude
inherent in the object by virtue of its origin in
the Creator. »
The corresponding ecstasy in the volition, and
hence in the sensibility, is by way of redundance.
This clarification strengthens rather than weak
ens my case, converging both aspects of the being
in I he trans-rational; but I do regret and apolo
gize for my error.

Stopping Tests Increases Danger
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the present concern over nuclear
tests, we believe that it is desirable to examine
the pertinent issues. Il has been held, for ex
ample, that nuclear tests are a serious threal to
human health. While it is true that large doses
of radiation are biologically harmful, the amount
of radiation received from nuclear tests is small
compared to the natural background radiation *o
which we have always been exposed.
In fact, the increase of radiation due to fallout
is about equal to the increase in cosmic radiation
received by moving from sea level to an altitude
of 1000 feet.
The amount of radiation from strontium 00 in

the course of a year is about one-tenth of that
which we receive from potassium 40 in our body
and about one-twentieth the amount we receive
from radium in drinking water. The amount of
increase due to fallout is about 2 per cent of the
natural background radiation.
II is not, however, the biological aspect which
primarily concerns those who most desire A hah
to nuclear tests. Rather, they believe that the
halting of tests would advance the cause of world
peace.
This, we believe, is a mistake. Nothing short
of world domination can satisfy the Soviets. This
goal and the means of achieving it are very
clearly stated in the writings of Lenin, Stalin and
others and are fully implemented in practice.
It would follow that the deaths of millions of
Americans would be as justified as the mass kill
ing of millions of Ukranians during the '30's; and
a small price to pay for ihe final triumph of com
munism. Any agreement, in Iheir eyes, must
serve this goal, and to honor an agreement when
it does not serve their purpose to do so would be
"bourgeois sentimentalism."
Against such an adversary, the best hope of
avoiding war is to make it clear that a war would
not be to his advantage. Without continued test
ing. the deterrent power of our atomic weapons
would vanish.
It is known, for example, that Ihe Russians
tested many now devices in their most recent
series, including missiles with nuclear warheads.
The United States must continue testing in order
to develop the necessary variety of nuclear weap
ons weapons with greatly reduced fallout—and
missiles with nuclear warheads.
We conclude that to halt nuclear weapons now
would advance not Ihe cause of world peace but
of Soviet imperialism, and thus increase the
danger of war.

which we receive from potassium 40 in our body
and about one-twentieth the amount we receive
from radium in drinking water. The amount of
increase due to fallout is about 2 per cent of the
natural background radiation.
II is not, however, the biological aspect which
primarily concerns those who most desire A hah
to nuclear tests. Rather, they believe that the
halting of tests would advance the cause of world
peace.
This, we believe, is a mistake. Nothing short
of world domination can satisfy the Soviets. This
goal and the means of achieving it are very
clearly stated in the writings of Lenin, Stalin and
others and are fully implemented in practice.
It would follow that the deaths of millions of
Americans would be as justified as the mass kill
ing of millions of Ukranians during the '30's; and
a small price to pay for ihe final triumph of com
munism. Any agreement, in Iheir eyes, must
serve this goal, and to honor an agreement when
it does not serve their purpose to do so would be
"bourgeois sentimentalism."
Against such an adversary, the best hope of
avoiding war is to make it clear that a war would
not be to his advantage. Without continued test
ing. the deterrent power of our atomic weapons
would vanish.
It is known, for example, that Ihe Russians
tested many now devices in their most recent
series, including missiles with nuclear warheads.
The United States must continue testing in order
to develop the necessary variety of nuclear weap
ons weapons with greatly reduced fallout—and
missiles with nuclear warheads.
We conclude that to halt nuclear weapons now
would advance not Ihe cause of world peace but
of Soviet imperialism, and thus increase the
danger of war.

Intuition Is Intellection
Editor, The Daily:
I hog of you the opportunity to correct an error
made in my talk on the San Francisco renais
sance on the Stanford campus.
In describing aesthetics as specifically intui
tional, the ecstatic nature of this act led me to
speak of it as a mode of volition rather than of
intellection. This is not so. Intuition is actually
the highest mode of intellection, though its term
is indeed ecstasy, a going out of oneself, a union
between the soul and the participated beatitude
inherent in the object by virtue of its origin in
the Creator. »
The corresponding ecstasy in the volition, and
hence in the sensibility, is by way of redundance.
This clarification strengthens rather than weak
ens my case, converging both aspects of the being
in I he trans-rational; but I do regret and apolo
gize for my error.

Editor, The Daily:
In view of the present concern over nuclear
tests, we believe that it is desirable to examine
the pertinent issues. Il has been held, for ex
ample, that nuclear tests are a serious threal to
human health. While it is true that large doses
of radiation are biologically harmful, the amount
of radiation received from nuclear tests is small
compared to the natural background radiation *o
which we have always been exposed.
In fact, the increase of radiation due to fallout
is about equal to the increase in cosmic radiation
received by moving from sea level to an altitude
of 1000 feet.
The amount of radiation from strontium 00 in

the course of a year is about one-tenth of that
which we receive from potassium 40 in our body
and about one-twentieth the amount we receive
from radium in drinking water. The amount of
increase due to fallout is about 2 per cent of the
natural background radiation.
