case.)

The President has argued that
1 ho evidence upon which he based
his decision must be kept secret,
both to protect Dr. Sibley's repu
tation and the confidence of those
who might have communicated
relevant material about his past
activities and his character.
Certainly Dr. Sibley's reputa
tion has been harmed infinitely
more by Ihis secrecy than by any
pertinent information. If one dis
misses his political action, his
scholarship, his teaching ability
and the testimony of many men
who have known him for years,
one is left with the appalling con
clusion that the President has dis
covered some secret about Dr.
Sibley's character of which no
one else has the slightest indica
tion.
Confront Sibley
If there is such a secret, either
Dr. Sibley should be confronted
with it., or the President should,
in all conscience, dismiss it from
his consideration.
If there is something question
able about Dr. Sibley's past, the
fact that he has elected to remain
silent, rather than to thank tlie
students tactfully and end their
protest, indicates clearly thai
whatever Dr. Sibley's moral fail
ures, he is willing as a fallible
man to stand by them.
Secrecy, sanctity of personal
files and limitation of informa
tion to "those who need to know"
are traditional prejudices in our
society, and until they are chal
lenged, the public institutions of
the United States will never em
body the liberal democratic ideals
of our culture.
Open Files
It is difficult to envisage a time
when the University, the school,
the department will see Ihe ne
cessity of opening their files to
the penetrating ga/.e of the Uni
versity as a whole, but until that
time decisions w'ill be prey to
prejudice, politics and hidden in
fluence rather than the only true
measure: the goals of the Univer
sity.
Legally Stanford may be a pri
vate entity, but morally it is a
public institution. The "para
mount purpose" of the founders
was "to promote the public wel
fare." The Trustees are directed
by the Founding Grant to:
"Annually report all their pro
ceedings to the person who for
the time being shall fill the office
of Governor of the State of Cali
fornia."
And in her last amendment
Mrs. Stanford states:
"The University was not made
independent of state control be
cause of any purpose of the
Founders inconsistent with its
character as a state institution,
but because they believed that its
purposes could be better and
more surely accomplished
through a Board of Trustees . . ."

The Founding Grant states that
the "nature" of this University is
the "cultivation and enlargement
of the mind." that its object is "to
qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in
life," and its purposes "to pro
mote the public welfare by exer
cising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teach
ing the blessings of liberty regu
lated by law, and inculcating love
and reverence for the groat prin
ciples of government as derived
from the inalienable rights of
man 1o life, liberty, and the pur
suit of happiness."
A member of the faculty has
written:
". . . Rut the question of lit
erature aside, most of the great
minds in science, philosophy, and
history will be found in the Uni
versities these are not men who
have taken flight from the mod
ern world, but sometimes for bet
ter and sometimes for worse they
are the men who are making it.
Center of World
"The university is the intellec
tual and spiritual center of our
world. It is likewise a national
institution; in fact it was, until
the New Order appeared in Fu
rope, an international institution,
and it will be again. It offers a
concrete embodiment, an institu
tional representation, of the most
important ideals of humanity: of
the belief in absolute truth; of the
importance in spite of human fal
libility, of the perpetual, though
necessarily imperfect, effort to
approximate truth; of intellectual
freedom and integrity; of the dig
nity of man.
Without the fairly explicit rec
ognition of these ideals, the uni
versity would collapse. . . . The
academic ideals are frequently
violated, but they remain as
ideals, as standards of judgment,
and as Ihe chief cohesive force in
our civilization; and the scholar is
their professional guardian."
(Yvor Winters, "In Defense of
Reason," University of Denver
Press, 1937. 1947; pp. 569-570.)
At Very Core
Undeniably, the faculty stands
at the very core of the university,
and the faculty ought to be the
determining factor in its charac
ter. There is a spirit that ought
to pervade a university, determin
ing the purchase of the smallest
desk. And unless the "academic
ideals" as embodied in the minds
and hearts of the faculty is the
origin of that spirit, this institu
tion will not take its rightful
place as one of the great univer
sities in America.
There has been much talk
about the aridity of the intellec
tual climate at Stanford. A pos
sible explanation might be that
the University's character is de
termined by its administrators
and not by its faculty.
President Sterling performs a
dual role. It is important to re

member that he not only is chief
administrator but lie also is "ex
officio head of the faculty" and
his sincere attempt to perform
both roles has never been ques
tioned by faculty or students.
It appears that he is limited in
his role as head of the faculty by
the very administrative organiza
tion he has inherited. There is
evidence in the climate of Stan
ford that its policies do not ade- j
quately reflect the values of its
faculty. Perhaps a comment by
John Dewey might be relevant:
". . . it still is true that inca
pacity to assume responsibilities
involved in having a voice in
shaping policies is bred and in
creased by conditions in which
that responsibility is denied."

both to protect Dr. Sibley's repu

If there is such a secret, either
Dr. Sibley should be confronted

in all conscience, dismiss it from
his consideration.
If there is something question
able about Dr. Sibley's past, the
fact that he has elected to remain
silent, rather than to thank tlie

whatever Dr. Sibley's moral fail

Secrecy, sanctity of personal

It is difficult to envisage a time

prejudice, politics and hidden in
fluence rather than the only true

Legally Stanford may be a pri

public institution. The "para

was "to promote the public wel

by the Founding Grant to:
"Annually report all their pro

of Governor of the State of Cali

And in her last amendment
Mrs. Stanford states:
"The University was not made
independent of state control be
cause of any purpose of the
Founders inconsistent with its
character as a state institution,
but because they believed that its
purposes could be better and
more surely accomplished
through a Board of Trustees . . ."

The Founding Grant states that
the "nature" of this University is
the "cultivation and enlargement
of the mind." that its object is "to
qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in
life," and its purposes "to pro
mote the public welfare by exer
cising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teach

origin of that spirit, this institu

There has been much talk
about the aridity of the intellec

sible explanation might be that
the University's character is de
termined by its administrators
and not by its faculty.
President Sterling performs a
dual role. It is important to re

member that he not only is chief
administrator but lie also is "ex
officio head of the faculty" and
his sincere attempt to perform
both roles has never been ques

It appears that he is limited in
his role as head of the faculty by
the very administrative organiza
tion he has inherited. There is
evidence in the climate of Stan
ford that its policies do not ade- j
quately reflect the values of its
faculty. Perhaps a comment by
John Dewey might be relevant:
". . . it still is true that inca

involved in having a voice in

creased by conditions in which
that responsibility is denied."

1 ho evidence upon which he based
his decision must be kept secret,
both to protect Dr. Sibley's repu
tation and the confidence of those
who might have communicated
relevant material about his past
activities and his character.
Certainly Dr. Sibley's reputa
tion has been harmed infinitely
more by Ihis secrecy than by any
pertinent information. If one dis
misses his political action, his
scholarship, his teaching ability
and the testimony of many men
who have known him for years,
one is left with the appalling con
clusion that the President has dis
covered some secret about Dr.
Sibley's character of which no
one else has the slightest indica
tion.
Confront Sibley
If there is such a secret, either
Dr. Sibley should be confronted
with it., or the President should,
in all conscience, dismiss it from
his consideration.
If there is something question
able about Dr. Sibley's past, the
fact that he has elected to remain
silent, rather than to thank tlie
students tactfully and end their
protest, indicates clearly thai
whatever Dr. Sibley's moral fail
ures, he is willing as a fallible
man to stand by them.
Secrecy, sanctity of personal
files and limitation of informa

are traditional prejudices in our
society, and until they are chal

the United States will never em

of our culture.
Open Files
It is difficult to envisage a time
when the University, the school,
the department will see Ihe ne
cessity of opening their files to
the penetrating ga/.e of the Uni
versity as a whole, but until that
time decisions w'ill be prey to
prejudice, politics and hidden in
fluence rather than the only true
measure: the goals of the Univer
sity.
Legally Stanford may be a pri
vate entity, but morally it is a
public institution. The "para
mount purpose" of the founders
was "to promote the public wel
fare." The Trustees are directed
by the Founding Grant to:
"Annually report all their pro
ceedings to the person who for
the time being shall fill the office
of Governor of the State of Cali
fornia."
And in her last amendment
Mrs. Stanford states:
"The University was not made
independent of state control be
cause of any purpose of the
Founders inconsistent with its
character as a state institution,
but because they believed that its
purposes could be better and
more surely accomplished
through a Board of Trustees . . ."

The Founding Grant states that
the "nature" of this University is
the "cultivation and enlargement
of the mind." that its object is "to
qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in
life," and its purposes "to pro
mote the public welfare by exer
cising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teach
ing the blessings of liberty regu
lated by law, and inculcating love
and reverence for the groat prin
ciples of government as derived
from the inalienable rights of
man 1o life, liberty, and the pur
suit of happiness."
A member of the faculty has

"The university is the intellec

the belief in absolute truth; of the

freedom and integrity; of the dig

Without the fairly explicit rec

At Very Core
Undeniably, the faculty stands
at the very core of the university,
and the faculty ought to be the
determining factor in its charac

to pervade a university, determin
ing the purchase of the smallest
desk. And unless the "academic
ideals" as embodied in the minds
and hearts of the faculty is the
origin of that spirit, this institu
tion will not take its rightful
place as one of the great univer
sities in America.
There has been much talk
about the aridity of the intellec
tual climate at Stanford. A pos
sible explanation might be that
the University's character is de
termined by its administrators
and not by its faculty.
President Sterling performs a
dual role. It is important to re

member that he not only is chief
administrator but lie also is "ex
officio head of the faculty" and
his sincere attempt to perform
both roles has never been ques
tioned by faculty or students.
It appears that he is limited in
his role as head of the faculty by
the very administrative organiza
tion he has inherited. There is
evidence in the climate of Stan
ford that its policies do not ade- j
quately reflect the values of its
faculty. Perhaps a comment by
John Dewey might be relevant:
". . . it still is true that inca
pacity to assume responsibilities
involved in having a voice in
shaping policies is bred and in
creased by conditions in which
that responsibility is denied."

who might have communicated
relevant material about his past
activities and his character.
Certainly Dr. Sibley's reputa
tion has been harmed infinitely
more by Ihis secrecy than by any
pertinent information. If one dis
misses his political action, his
scholarship, his teaching ability
and the testimony of many men
who have known him for years,
one is left with the appalling con
clusion that the President has dis
covered some secret about Dr.
Sibley's character of which no
one else has the slightest indica
tion.
Confront Sibley
If there is such a secret, either
Dr. Sibley should be confronted
with it., or the President should,
in all conscience, dismiss it from
his consideration.
If there is something question
able about Dr. Sibley's past, the
fact that he has elected to remain
silent, rather than to thank tlie
students tactfully and end their
protest, indicates clearly thai
whatever Dr. Sibley's moral fail
ures, he is willing as a fallible
man to stand by them.
Secrecy, sanctity of personal
files and limitation of informa
tion to "those who need to know"
are traditional prejudices in our
society, and until they are chal
lenged, the public institutions of
the United States will never em
body the liberal democratic ideals
of our culture.
Open Files
It is difficult to envisage a time
when the University, the school,
the department will see Ihe ne
cessity of opening their files to
the penetrating ga/.e of the Uni
versity as a whole, but until that
time decisions w'ill be prey to
prejudice, politics and hidden in
fluence rather than the only true
measure: the goals of the Univer
sity.
Legally Stanford may be a pri
vate entity, but morally it is a
public institution. The "para
mount purpose" of the founders
was "to promote the public wel
fare." The Trustees are directed
by the Founding Grant to:
"Annually report all their pro
ceedings to the person who for
the time being shall fill the office
of Governor of the State of Cali
fornia."
And in her last amendment
Mrs. Stanford states:
"The University was not made
independent of state control be
cause of any purpose of the
Founders inconsistent with its
character as a state institution,
but because they believed that its
purposes could be better and
more surely accomplished
through a Board of Trustees . . ."

The Founding Grant states that
the "nature" of this University is
the "cultivation and enlargement
of the mind." that its object is "to
qualify its students for personal
success, and direct usefulness in
life," and its purposes "to pro
mote the public welfare by exer
cising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teach
ing the blessings of liberty regu
lated by law, and inculcating love
and reverence for the groat prin
ciples of government as derived
from the inalienable rights of
man 1o life, liberty, and the pur
suit of happiness."
A member of the faculty has
written:
". . . Rut the question of lit
erature aside, most of the great
minds in science, philosophy, and
history will be found in the Uni
versities these are not men who
have taken flight from the mod
ern world, but sometimes for bet
ter and sometimes for worse they
are the men who are making it.
Center of World
"The university is the intellec
tual and spiritual center of our
world. It is likewise a national
institution; in fact it was, until
the New Order appeared in Fu
rope, an international institution,
and it will be again. It offers a
concrete embodiment, an institu
tional representation, of the most
important ideals of humanity: of
the belief in absolute truth; of the
importance in spite of human fal
libility, of the perpetual, though
necessarily imperfect, effort to
approximate truth; of intellectual
freedom and integrity; of the dig
nity of man.
Without the fairly explicit rec
ognition of these ideals, the uni
versity would collapse. . . . The
academic ideals are frequently
violated, but they remain as
ideals, as standards of judgment,
and as Ihe chief cohesive force in
our civilization; and the scholar is
their professional guardian."
(Yvor Winters, "In Defense of
Reason," University of Denver
Press, 1937. 1947; pp. 569-570.)
At Very Core
Undeniably, the faculty stands
at the very core of the university,
and the faculty ought to be the
determining factor in its charac
ter. There is a spirit that ought
to pervade a university, determin
ing the purchase of the smallest
desk. And unless the "academic
ideals" as embodied in the minds
and hearts of the faculty is the
origin of that spirit, this institu
tion will not take its rightful
place as one of the great univer
sities in America.
There has been much talk
about the aridity of the intellec
tual climate at Stanford. A pos
sible explanation might be that
the University's character is de
termined by its administrators
and not by its faculty.
President Sterling performs a
dual role. It is important to re

member that he not only is chief
administrator but lie also is "ex
officio head of the faculty" and
his sincere attempt to perform
both roles has never been ques
tioned by faculty or students.
It appears that he is limited in
his role as head of the faculty by
the very administrative organiza
tion he has inherited. There is
evidence in the climate of Stan
ford that its policies do not ade- j
quately reflect the values of its
faculty. Perhaps a comment by
John Dewey might be relevant:
". . . it still is true that inca
pacity to assume responsibilities
involved in having a voice in
shaping policies is bred and in
creased by conditions in which
that responsibility is denied."

(Editor's Note: This is the
third in a series of articles deal
ing with the powers and struc
ture of Stanford's Administra
tion, as reflected in tlie Sibley
case.)

The President has argued that
1 ho evidence upon which he based
his decision must be kept secret,
both to protect Dr. Sibley's repu
tation and the confidence of those
who might have communicated
relevant material about his past
activities and his character.
Certainly Dr. Sibley's reputa
