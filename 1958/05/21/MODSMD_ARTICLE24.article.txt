# Cal Edges Tribe 8-6 as Late Rally Fails
## 
### Dick Barnes Sports Editor 
First baseman John Balaam's fine running catch of Don Robinson's short foul slice killed a ninth
inning Stanford rally and gave California an 8-6 decision here yesterday.
The victory was Cal's third of the year over the Indians. Slanford won once. George Wolfman's
Bears also cinched second place in the CIBA race, finishing 9-7. Stanford is 6-8, and needs two week
end victories over Santa Clara to finish at the .500 level.
California teed off early on Stanford starter Bob Leopold, picking up five second-inning runs that

overcame ihe pair .the Cards had
scored in the first.
Stanford pecked away to make
the count 5-4 after four frames,
but the Bears got their three-run
margin back with two fifth-frame
runs. They added one more in the
seventh, but Parker Olsen got
that one back for the Indians with
a 410-foot blast over the left-field
wall in the bottom of Ihe eighth.
Dick Williams walked with one
down in the ninth to open the
Indian rally that never material
ized. He was forced at second,
but, with two away, Joel Newkirk
came through with a single.
Robinson Ends Rally
Art Von Wronski pinch-hit for
shortstop Bob Dwight, and he
worked Bob Bandetini, the second
Cal hurler, for a free pas-*. Rob
inson stepped in, took one called
strike and then sliced the foul
that Balaam snagged to end the
ball game.
Sloppiness was the order of the
day as each side committed four
fielding errors and threw in a few
mental blunders. But counteract
ing these were five well-executed
double plays three of them by
California.
Stanford got its short-lived load
on three long blows to left field
that gave loft-fielder Hei nle Simp
son all sorts of trouble. With two
out, A 1 Shaw doubled and Simp
son fell down getting to the ball.
Then Ralph Holding lofted a
long triple off the embankment
just below the fence, while Simp
son lay prostrate on the hill trying
to reach the ball.
Williams raised another long
ball that Simpson went in and out
for, finally letting it fall off his
glove for a three-base error. But

that was it so far as Tribe lead,
were concerned.

Avery Relieves
Balaam walked, Ed Masearin
doubled, starter Dave Draheim
singled. Simpson walked, Mike
White and Bob Puccinelli singled,
and the score was 5-2. That fin
ished Leopold and brought in
George Avery.
He was only moderately effec
tive, yielding the pair of runs that
kept Cal ahead. Williams came to
the mound from left field in the
seventh alter Avery was removed
for a pinch-batter. He looked the
best of the Stanford hurlers, giv
ing up one run on two hits in his
three-inning stint.
First baseman John Balaam's fine running catch of Don Robinson's short foul slice killed a ninth
inning Stanford rally and gave California an 8-6 decision here yesterday.
The victory was Cal's third of the year over the Indians. Slanford won once. George Wolfman's
Bears also cinched second place in the CIBA race, finishing 9-7. Stanford is 6-8, and needs two week
end victories over Santa Clara to finish at the .500 level.
California teed off early on Stanford starter Bob Leopold, picking up five second-inning runs that

overcame ihe pair .the Cards had
scored in the first.
Stanford pecked away to make
the count 5-4 after four frames,
but the Bears got their three-run
margin back with two fifth-frame
runs. They added one more in the
seventh, but Parker Olsen got
that one back for the Indians with
a 410-foot blast over the left-field
wall in the bottom of Ihe eighth.
Dick Williams walked with one
down in the ninth to open the
Indian rally that never material

but, with two away, Joel Newkirk
came through with a single.
Robinson Ends Rally
Art Von Wronski pinch-hit for
shortstop Bob Dwight, and he
worked Bob Bandetini, the second
Cal hurler, for a free pas-*. Rob
inson stepped in, took one called
strike and then sliced the foul
that Balaam snagged to end the
ball game.
Sloppiness was the order of the
day as each side committed four
fielding errors and threw in a few
mental blunders. But counteract
ing these were five well-executed
double plays three of them by
California.
Stanford got its short-lived load
on three long blows to left field
that gave loft-fielder Hei nle Simp
son all sorts of trouble. With two
out, A 1 Shaw doubled and Simp
son fell down getting to the ball.
Then Ralph Holding lofted a
long triple off the embankment
just below the fence, while Simp
son lay prostrate on the hill trying
to reach the ball.
Williams raised another long
ball that Simpson went in and out
for, finally letting it fall off his
glove for a three-base error. But

that was it so far as Tribe lead,

First baseman John Balaam's fine running catch of Don Robinson's short foul slice killed a ninth
inning Stanford rally and gave California an 8-6 decision here yesterday.
The victory was Cal's third of the year over the Indians. Slanford won once. George Wolfman's
Bears also cinched second place in the CIBA race, finishing 9-7. Stanford is 6-8, and needs two week
end victories over Santa Clara to finish at the .500 level.
California teed off early on Stanford starter Bob Leopold, picking up five second-inning runs that

overcame ihe pair .the Cards had
scored in the first.
Stanford pecked away to make
the count 5-4 after four frames,
but the Bears got their three-run
margin back with two fifth-frame
runs. They added one more in the
seventh, but Parker Olsen got
that one back for the Indians with
a 410-foot blast over the left-field
wall in the bottom of Ihe eighth.
Dick Williams walked with one
down in the ninth to open the
Indian rally that never material
ized. He was forced at second,
but, with two away, Joel Newkirk
came through with a single.
Robinson Ends Rally
Art Von Wronski pinch-hit for
shortstop Bob Dwight, and he
worked Bob Bandetini, the second
Cal hurler, for a free pas-*. Rob
inson stepped in, took one called
strike and then sliced the foul
that Balaam snagged to end the
ball game.
Sloppiness was the order of the
day as each side committed four
fielding errors and threw in a few
mental blunders. But counteract
ing these were five well-executed
double plays three of them by
California.
Stanford got its short-lived load
on three long blows to left field
that gave loft-fielder Hei nle Simp
son all sorts of trouble. With two
out, A 1 Shaw doubled and Simp
son fell down getting to the ball.
Then Ralph Holding lofted a
long triple off the embankment
just below the fence, while Simp
son lay prostrate on the hill trying
to reach the ball.
Williams raised another long
ball that Simpson went in and out
for, finally letting it fall off his
glove for a three-base error. But

that was it so far as Tribe lead,
were concerned.

by Tom Palma and a walk to
Charlie Thompson, Leopold got
Roger Gregg to hit into'a run
scoring double play. Then the
trouble started.
Avery Relieves
Balaam walked, Ed Masearin
doubled, starter Dave Draheim
singled. Simpson walked, Mike
White and Bob Puccinelli singled,
and the score was 5-2. That fin
ished Leopold and brought in
George Avery.
He was only moderately effec
tive, yielding the pair of runs that
kept Cal ahead. Williams came to
the mound from left field in the
seventh alter Avery was removed
for a pinch-batter. He looked the
best of the Stanford hurlers, giv
ing up one run on two hits in his
three-inning stint.
