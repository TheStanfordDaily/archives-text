# USC Favored in PCC Track Meet
## 
### 
Friday and Saturday's Pacific Coast Conference track and field
championships at Berkeley are a cinch to provide a team triumph for
Soul hern California, but there's no certainty at all about some of the
individual duels on tap.
Who's tops among the four southern schools is reasonably certain

from the results of dual meet
competition among the four—hut
the principal question is: Just
where are the northerners going
to fit in?
Midseason marks from Oregon,
OSC, Washington, WSC and Idaho
are traditionally far behind those
from this area. But when the late
season big meets roll around, the
five usually come through with
some surprises. Last year's PCC
meet provided a typical example
of this when Oregon upset UCLA
for the second spot.
Oregon looks equally potent
this year, off its 10-point victory
in the PCC Northern Division
meet last Saturday. Jim Grelle,
a miler, is tin 1 best of the Ducks.
Grelle Tough in .Mile
Grelle's winning time Saturday
wa« 4:06.1, indicating he's on his
way to a good outdoor season,
after some campaigning on the
boards during the winter.
He'll go into the mile only the
third choice behind Cal's Don
Bowden and Stanford's Norman
Lloyd, but he'll of course lie the
second choice if Bowden sticks to
just the 880.
Oregon also boasts a talented
stable of sprinters. Footballer
Jack Morris was the top man Sat
urday as he won the ND 100. He
has an all-time best of 9.5, so he
might even give Cal's Willie
White a good chase for the cen
tury title. Morris will certainly
be a big threat for the No. 2 spot,
along with Dave James of UCLA

and Dean Smith of Stanford.
And Oregon also has Steve An
derson and Otis Davis to send in
in both dashes. They're actually
about even with Morris most of
the time, so the Ducks could con
ceivably come up with 9 points in
the 100 alone.
Tobacco Defends 410
Biggest northern threat to Jack
Yerman and Ted Smith in the 440
will be Washington's Terry To
bacco. Tobacco is the defending
PCC champ, but he didn't face
sophomores Yerman and Smith in
last year's race.
The PCC isn't blessed with any
outstanding and consistent broad
jumpers this season, so Washing
ton's Tony Softli could be the man
to bring home the marbles. He
went 24-6% last Saturday to win
the ND meet.
Stanford's Mike Franchetti will
not be the only short man in the
pole vault. Washington State has
Don Ellingsen, and he's only 5-7.
Ellingsen should be well remem
bered by Indian fans for the dam
age he did at end and halfback in
the Cougars' 21-18 football victory
here last fall. He went 13-6 on
Saturday.
Another miler who could cause
plenty of trouble is Washington'**
Jack Larson. He was less than
1 second behind Grelle in the divi
sion meet and is also expected to
show plenty of late-season im
provement.

sophomores Yerman and Smith in
last year's race.
The PCC isn't blessed with any
outstanding and consistent broad
jumpers this season, so Washing
ton's Tony Softli could be the man
to bring home the marbles. He
went 24-6% last Saturday to win
the ND meet.
Stanford's Mike Franchetti will
not be the only short man in the
pole vault. Washington State has
Don Ellingsen, and he's only 5-7.
Ellingsen should be well remem
bered by Indian fans for the dam
age he did at end and halfback in
the Cougars' 21-18 football victory
here last fall. He went 13-6 on
Saturday.
Another miler who could cause
plenty of trouble is Washington'**
Jack Larson. He was less than
1 second behind Grelle in the divi
sion meet and is also expected to
show plenty of late-season im
provement.
Friday and Saturday's Pacific Coast Conference track and field
championships at Berkeley are a cinch to provide a team triumph for
Soul hern California, but there's no certainty at all about some of the
individual duels on tap.
Who's tops among the four southern schools is reasonably certain

from the results of dual meet
competition among the four—hut
the principal question is: Just
where are the northerners going
to fit in?
Midseason marks from Oregon,
OSC, Washington, WSC and Idaho
are traditionally far behind those
from this area. But when the late
season big meets roll around, the
five usually come through with
some surprises. Last year's PCC
meet provided a typical example
of this when Oregon upset UCLA
for the second spot.
Oregon looks equally potent
this year, off its 10-point victory
in the PCC Northern Division
meet last Saturday. Jim Grelle,
a miler, is tin 1 best of the Ducks.
Grelle Tough in .Mile
Grelle's winning time Saturday
wa« 4:06.1, indicating he's on his
way to a good outdoor season,
after some campaigning on the
boards during the winter.
He'll go into the mile only the
third choice behind Cal's Don
Bowden and Stanford's Norman
Lloyd, but he'll of course lie the
second choice if Bowden sticks to
just the 880.
Oregon also boasts a talented
stable of sprinters. Footballer
Jack Morris was the top man Sat
urday as he won the ND 100. He
has an all-time best of 9.5, so he
might even give Cal's Willie
White a good chase for the cen
tury title. Morris will certainly
be a big threat for the No. 2 spot,
along with Dave James of UCLA

and Dean Smith of Stanford.
And Oregon also has Steve An
derson and Otis Davis to send in
in both dashes. They're actually
about even with Morris most of
the time, so the Ducks could con
ceivably come up with 9 points in
the 100 alone.
Tobacco Defends 410
Biggest northern threat to Jack
Yerman and Ted Smith in the 440
will be Washington's Terry To
bacco. Tobacco is the defending
PCC champ, but he didn't face
sophomores Yerman and Smith in
last year's race.
