# Card Mermen Picked For PCC Swim Win
## 
### 
PCC swimming championship
time is here again for the Stan
ford varsity mermen. Defending
champion and holder of the
Soul hern Division title for the
past eight years, the Indians are
again favorites to win this year's
meet to he held at the University
of California, Thursday through
Saturday.
Wilh top men in every event
the Indians easily should be able
to avenge last month's dual meet
loss to the University of Southern
California. USC is the only
school that has a ghost of a
chance to pull an upset and at
that the Trojans will be needing
a near miracle to do it.
Four Records
Four new records will auto
matically go into the record
books, due to rule changes. A
new NCAA ruling which makes
the breast-stroke a surface stroke
will mean that the winning marks
in the 100- and 200-yard breast
stroke, the 200 - yard individual
medley and the 400-yard medley
relay will go down as meet rec
ords and will likely be recorded
as conference records, after a
comparison is made with best
dual meet times.
1500 First Race
First competition starts with
the staging of the 1500-meter fi
nals at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Start
ing times for both Friday and
Saturday will be 10 a.m. and 3:30
p.m. Meats will be in the morn
ing, with finals in the afternoon.
This long and lone 1500-meter
race will be a tight one. Indians'
Jim Muir has a 21:00 time this
season but will have to look up
to Cal's Jim Small with a 19:19

which should win the race.
Small's teammate Lloyd Ibbetson
is only a minute off his best mark
with 20:12. Muir will probably
fight it out with Trojans' Ken
Starbird, who has hit 21:05 for
third, but could put a second.
Moore to Shine
Man of the meet will be Stan
ford's Robin Moore. Moore is the
only PCC swimmer who ranks
among the best in the world.
Holding PCC records in the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles, he should
sweep effortless victories in the
50. 100 and 220.
The breast stroke races seem to
be strictly Stanford's this year
with Bill Fuller and Tom Peter
son boasting creditable 2:3o's.
Gus Damon and Gary Weaver
should finish third and fourth re
spectively. Both Stanford relays
are also favored to be winners.
Competing in Ihe meet will be
USC, Cal, UCLA and Stanford.
Each team may enter four men in
each event and one man may not
enter more than three events. Six
men shall qualify for the finals in
each event.
