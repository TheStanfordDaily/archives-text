# Stephen Gets Another Year
## 
### 
Roy Stephen, substitute back
on the 1 957 Stanford football
team, was granted an additional
year of eligibility by the Pacific
Coast Conference, in the loop's
meeting Monday in Portland.
Stephen was out nearly all of
the 1955 season flue to an injury,
so he got the year back. Califor
nia track star Monte Upshaw also
regained a year because of a 1956
leg injury.
The loop's year-old eligibility
rule which said that an athlete
transferring from one member in
stitution to another would have
no further eligibility was scrap
ped in favor of the old rule, which
penalizes him just one year.
Stanford will host Ihe 1958 PCC
cross-country meet Nov. 29. as a
result of further Conference ac
tion. Decision on 1959-60 basket
ball scheduling was put off until
the December meeting of the
league.
