# Encina Interior to Be Razed
## 
### 
Students should climb the
grand staircase in Encina Hall
during this month if they ever
want to ascend the steps where
Grandpa held his legendary water
fights.
Preparation is well under way
for completely razing the interior
of the old dormitory's central sec
tion. Preliminary work, such as

moving offices to new locations,
is now being performed and dis
mantling operations will begin at
the end of this quarter.
In another year a modern of
fice building of steel and concrete
will be tucked in between the
same sandstone walls which used
to contain the brick and oak dor
mitory.
Even the roof will be stripped
away and replaced with a lower
one which will have no attic win
dows.
The wings will continue in serv
ice during the rebuilding but will
likewise undergo the "surgeon's
knife" as soon as the central por
tion is compelted.
The west wing, closest to the
Quad, will contain Blackie's cof
fee shop, the laundry, barber
shop, director of residences, busi
ness office and purchasing de

partment.
The central wing, formerly the
Encina lounge and bull pen, will
contain ftOTC offices in the base
ment and the cashier's office and
part of the controller's office on
the main floor.
Access to these offices will be
made by a temporary stairway in
the courtyard behind Encina din
ing hall.
In the east wing will be the con
troller's and public exercises of
fices.
The "scoop-out" method of re
building Encina is similar to the
process employed in converting
the Administration Building into
the Law School in 1949 and of
1 renovating the White House in
â€¢ 1951.
Encina, first men's dormitory,
was built in 1891 on the plans of
- an Austrian Alps hotel.
