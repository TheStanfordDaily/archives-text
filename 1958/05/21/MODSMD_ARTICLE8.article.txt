# Paltry Pulp Published Again
## 
### 
Stanford spendthrifts who
did not use up all their pennies
two weeks ago on the bogus
sports magazine will have a
chance to learn all about the
Billy Graham crusade today for
35 cents.
Today's Chappie also fea
tures an expose of (dare we
mention it?) off-campus living.
Some readers may even enjoy
the several exchange queens
the pulp has dredged up for
this issuer
