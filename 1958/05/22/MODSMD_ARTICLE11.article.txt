## 
### Camilla Petersen 
Frost Amphitheater will be transformed into the Athens of ancient
times tonight at 8:30 when the rising lights open the Stanford Play
ers' first out-of-doors production, "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
by William Shakespeare.
Twenty-one dancing wood nymphs wil augment the 41-student cast.

The wood nymphs are fifth and
sixth graders from local schools.
Tickets for the presentations to
night through Saturday are on
sale at Memorial Auditorium box
office at $2, $1.75 and $1.50. All
performances begin at 8:30 p.m.
There was a law in the city of
Athens which gave its citizens the
power of compelling their daugh
ters to marry whomsoever they
pleased. Upon the girls refusal,
the father was empowered by
this law to have her put to death.
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"
opens with Egeus (Robert Lehr
er) complaining to Theseus, Duke
of Athens (Tim Haggerty), that
his daughter Hermia (Nancy
Cole) has refused to marry De
metrius (Dick Lamb) because she
is in love with Lysander (James
Frei burger). Helena < Betsy
Flint), Ilermia's dear friend, is
in love with Demetrius.
The merriment begins when
Hermia and Lysanricr run away
through the woods on the way to
his aunt's so they can bo married.
They are followed by the jealous
Demetrius and lovesick Helena.
IMot Thickens
While in the woods the lovers
unknowingly become involved
with the rulers of fairyland, Ti
tania and Oberon. Oberon (Tom
Luce) wishes as his henchman a
small hoy who is under Titania's
care. This is only another stick
heaped upon their pile of marital
troubles because we learn that
Titania (Celia Howard) has been
infatuated with Theseus and
Oberon with Hippolyta (Doris
Viola) whom Theseus is about to
marry.
Adding to the colorful fairy
land scenes are the antics of the
knavish sprite, .Robin Goodfellow,
better known as Puck (Lair Par
ent). It is through his mistake
that both Demetrius and Lysan
der come to seek Helena's love,
thus turning the four former
friends to further fighting.
The play within the play is pre
sented by the rude mechanicles,
"hard-handed men that work in
Athens." They are bent on giving
a play for great Theseus' wedding
day. It is while they are practic
ing in the wood that they too be
come involved with the fairies ...
Characters'
Other rustics are Mark Ham
mer as Quince the carpenter, W.
R. Brunner as Snug the joiner,
Russ Coombs as Flute the bel
lows-mender, Barry McCrae as
Snout the tinker, and Steve Berry
as Starveling the tailor.

nia's head fairy. Other fairies

Peaseblossom, Niki Record as
Cobweb, Lynn Averill as Mus
tardseed, and Yvonne Yarcho as
Moth.

Lyons as Philostrate, master of

terson, Jackie Pattison and Lynn
Gallagher as Oberon's dancers.

"A Midsummer Night's Dream"
opens with Egeus (Robert Lehr
er) complaining to Theseus, Duke
of Athens (Tim Haggerty), that
his daughter Hermia (Nancy
Cole) has refused to marry De
metrius (Dick Lamb) because she
is in love with Lysander (James
Frei burger). Helena < Betsy

in love with Demetrius.
The merriment begins when
Hermia and Lysanricr run away
through the woods on the way to
his aunt's so they can bo married.

Demetrius and lovesick Helena.
IMot Thickens
While in the woods the lovers
unknowingly become involved
with the rulers of fairyland, Ti
tania and Oberon. Oberon (Tom
Luce) wishes as his henchman a
small hoy who is under Titania's
care. This is only another stick
heaped upon their pile of marital
troubles because we learn that
Titania (Celia Howard) has been
infatuated with Theseus and
Oberon with Hippolyta (Doris
Viola) whom Theseus is about to
marry.
Adding to the colorful fairy
land scenes are the antics of the
knavish sprite, .Robin Goodfellow,
better known as Puck (Lair Par
ent). It is through his mistake
that both Demetrius and Lysan
der come to seek Helena's love,
thus turning the four former
friends to further fighting.
The play within the play is pre
sented by the rude mechanicles,
"hard-handed men that work in
Athens." They are bent on giving

tania and Oberon. Oberon (Tom
Luce) wishes as his henchman a
small hoy who is under Titania's
care. This is only another stick
heaped upon their pile of marital
troubles because we learn that
Titania (Celia Howard) has been
infatuated with Theseus and
Oberon with Hippolyta (Doris
Viola) whom Theseus is about to
marry.
Adding to the colorful fairy
land scenes are the antics of the
knavish sprite, .Robin Goodfellow,
better known as Puck (Lair Par
ent). It is through his mistake
that both Demetrius and Lysan
der come to seek Helena's love,
thus turning the four former
friends to further fighting.
The play within the play is pre
sented by the rude mechanicles,
"hard-handed men that work in
Athens." They are bent on giving
a play for great Theseus' wedding
day. It is while they are practic
ing in the wood that they too be
come involved with the fairies ...
