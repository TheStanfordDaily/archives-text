# Toward Being a Conscience
## 
### 
The special supplement on undergraduate
education at Stanford which appears in today's
Daily is a lirst attempt by the undergraduates
themselves to describe the University and the
educational experience it offers, in terms more
realistic than the chauvinism of the typical
"official publication."
We do not claim that today's supplement
gives a complete or even wholly accurate pic
ture of Stanford; lirst efforts are never perfect.
But we feel that the supplement is an excellent
step toward making The Daily what it can and
should he: the "conscience" of the University.
The general conclusion which most of the
writers of the supplement articles seem to
arrive at is that Stanford—its students, faculty,
facilities and general situation —has a great
potential, whose realization is lagging far be
hind what il should he.

The Daily also has this potential, and its
realization can greatly aid the intellectual de
velopment of the University. Stanford does not
need a newspaper (in the sense of a "bulletin
board" announcing campus events) ; it needs a
journal of opinion, which would serve as a
much-needed focal point for the University's
intellectual life.
However, the wishes of the Daily staff are
not enough to insure this sort of publication.
Members of the Stanford community must
come to regard The Daily as a proper vehicle
for expressing their opinions, in articles as well
as in letters to the editor. The faculty in par
ticular must overcome its reticence to speak out
in The Daily's columns.
We wish to thank those who contributed to
today's "first-attempt" supplement. We hope
it will become an annual Daily tradition.
