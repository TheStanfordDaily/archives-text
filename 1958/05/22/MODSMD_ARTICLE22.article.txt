Suggestions to Advisory Committee
Editor, The Daily:
Following is a copy of a letter sent to William
McCord, Associate Dean of Humanities:
In response to the notice in The Daily inviting
written suggestions for submission to the Presi
dent's Student Advisory Committee, I would like
to submit the following:
(1) Change admissions policy to admit a great
er number of scholars and fewer of the more
average "well-rounded" type.
(2) Request the Admissions Office to cam
paign vigorously among the high schools and
high school lobby at the state Legislature for
development of individuality in high schools.
(3) Require more individual Ihought. from nil
students.
(4) Give successful students as well as alh
letes publicity in The Daily, try to build prestige
for scholars.
<r>) Provide an attractive and central meeting
place on campus for spare-time exchange of
ideas, being realistic and serving low-alcohol-con
tent beer.
((J) Eliminate big-time football and present
boys' camp atmosphere in fraternities.
(7) Reverse present trend toward mass dormi
tory living and mass feeding—individualize these.
(8) Encourage vigorous partisanship in politi
cal and religious affairs on campus.
(9» Increase the work load to nearly the limit,
relieving thereby the need to fill spare time wilh
trivia and eliminating thereby the resulting con
formity influence.

Application fttr Sibley Post
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to submit my application for the
post in the Political Science Department that is

to he vacated by Professor Sibley. I feel that I
have qualifications that would entirely suit the
wishes of the Administration of Stanford Univer
sity.
My bntire life has been spent in research. As
a youth, while the oilier children were wasting
their time playing baseball, I compiled an anno
luted biography of Charles Comiskey which was
published by Pedantic Press, Ltd., and led to my
appointment to the faculty at my present college
(the name of which slips my mind for a mo
ment).
Since that time, I have spent my time in inves
tigation of prehistoric theories of government.
This study has produced a 16-volume work and
an international reputation.
It is Irue that I have a slight speech impedi
ment. My students are often confused by the
fact that I pronounce my "s's" as though they
were "f's." This is entirely due to the fact that
I was educated by reading 18th century political
tracts.
Some of them are further confused by the fact
that I speak only Latin. It is also true that the
enrollment in my classes is small, but many a
diligent father who has wanted his son to go
into the field of prehistoric theories of govern
ment has sent his boy to me.
The increased revenue that this brought in
for my employers should not be ignored. Stan
ford could use a new basketball pavilion.
Although as an open-minded scholar I hold no
political beliefs, I would like to state boldly at
this time that if anyone is able to bring about a
perfect state and a perfect electorate, my exten
sive background will enable me to know how to
govern it.
