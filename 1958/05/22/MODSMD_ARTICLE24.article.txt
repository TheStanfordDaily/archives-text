# Power Setup Justifies Reticence on Officials

(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth unit final article in a sc
ries analyzing the power struc
ture of Stanford's Administra
tion, as reflected in the Sibley
case.)

The reticence of the Stanford
faculty in matters of internal ad
ministration and national politics
seems justified in view of the
present power structure and the
traditions of the University.
It is not justified in terms of
the paramount purpose of the
Founding Grant or the role of a
university in our society today.
The students have no tradition
of outspoken debate, no power in
the University structure, not even
a national association to protect
their rights, and yet this year
they have shown themselves the
only truly responsible members of
this institution.
Today's supplement in The
Daily, undertaken with full recog
nition of local, national and inter
national problems, shows the type
of criticism that will redound to
the good of the entire University.
Silencing Debate
The fear of baring Stanford's
problems to the public, to the
Board of Trustees, or to perspec
tive donors has continuously si
lenced intelligent debate —the
most effective method for arriv
ing at a union of fact and value.
Certainly the professors of this
University often express criticism
of its policies, but these criticisms
are almost always off the record
and not for publication.
When pressed they reply that
their suggestions will be offered
through proper channels. Proper
channels often have dead ends.
Public opinion is the greatest
force leading to effective imple
mentation of such suggestions,
and The Daily is the organ of pub
lic opinion at this University.
Members of the faculty have
noticed an apparent renaissance
of student intelligence and respon
sibility in the past three or four
years, culminating in the H-bomb
discussion and the protest over
Mulford Sibley's reappointment.
Student Energy
The student energy over these
two problems can either be har
nessed for the good of the Univer
sity or it can be so crushed that
any intellectual effort on the part
of next year's student body will
be fortuitous.
If the president and the faculty
remain silent until the end of this
quarter, Ihey will be able safely
to forget this year's problems and
begin next year with a clean slate
and status quo.
However, in order to make Stan
ford a leader in the reform of
American education, and a school
of which every intelligent student
and every great professor in the
nation would wish to become
members, the president and the
faculty should take immediate ac
tion at the coming meeting of the
Academic Council.
Crisis Similar
The crisis which the United
States faces in the world is essen
tially the same crisis which Stan
ford University faces: the prob
lem of instituting democratic val
ues into an administrative organi
zation traditionally allied with
self-interest, autocracy and arbi
trary power.

The effect of the United States
as an exporter of values is con
tinually defeated by the traditions
of nationalism; the effect of Stan
ford as a university is continually
defeated by the traditions of 19th
century corporate structure, of
which the present administrative
structure seems to be an example.
The following suggestions are
in no way definitive; only through
free and open discussion, based
upon complete information, may
solutions become so.
The case of Dr. Sibley's appoint
ment should be brought before
the Academic Council as a whole,
and a recommendation, along with
the president's opinion, should be
sent through the Advisory Coun
cil to ihe Board of Trustees.
Recommendation
The council's recommendation
need not be unanimous; it should
include both a majority and a dis
senting opinion.
In view of the present informa
tion, any reversal of the Sibley de
cision by the President's Office
would not jeopardize authority.
The Articles of Organization of
the Faculty should be examined,
and a suggestion for their revi
sion, giving effective power to the
Advisory Council, should be for
warded in the same manner as
Dr. Sibley's appointment.
Leading students of the Univer
sity should be invited to attend
the council meeting to express
their opinions. They need be given
no other power than the expres
sion of opinion based on full
knowledge of what is taking
place.
Admissions Policies
The admissions policies should
he reviewed and overhauled to
give effective control to the fac
ulty. Stanford is directed by the
Founding Grant to "qualify its
students for personal success,"
and the development of an intel
lectual community of students is
essential to this.
A permanent committee should
be established as part of the Ad
visory Council, for continuous ex
amination of University functions
and for the evaluation of all Uni
versity decisions in accordance
with a unified philosophy of edu
cation.
A recent writer states that the
"aspects of education which the
administration must take into ac
count" are "concerned with rela
tions of the school to the public
that supports it, of the schools to
society, of education to political
Iheory in general, as well as with
the details of educational admin
istration and organization — the
cost of education or even school
buildings may be affected by cer
tain philosophical points of view.
Education, Philosophy
"... It is precisely because these
determining factors have been
neglected in the study of educa
tional philosophy that public edu
cation has encountered many of
its recent difficulties and that so
many conflicts have arisen on aca
demic freedom, controversial is
sues and social change through
education" (I. L. Kandel, "Philoso
phy of Education," Harvard Edu
cational Review, vol. XXVI, No. 2.
spring 1956, p. 135).
The examination committee of
the Advisory Council must in
clude members of the Administra
tion, the faculty and the student
body. It must have free access to

all information. Its function
would be to propose legislation to
the council, to publish all perti
nent information to the commu
nity at large and to examine the
slate of public opinion upon this
information.
Politics
Mrs. Stanford proposed th e
question fairly to the faculty in
an amendment to tin 1 Founding
Grant on Oct. 3. 1902, stating that,
in her opinion, "the true reason
why professors of other universi
ties have nearly altogether ab
stained from entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion
of political and other questions
upon which public feeling runs
high and upon which the public is
itself divided" is that "he is being
deemed by his hearers, or any of
them, to be speaking for his uni
versity and voicing its views."
In the last 10 years especially
it has been established that pro
fessors do not represent the spe
cific views of the University, ei
ther in the classroom or upon a
public rostrum.
The University endorses no spe
cific legislation or ideas—it en
dorses a way of thinking, a meth
od of free and open debate.
Students learn as much from
the personality of a professor as
they do from his ideas, and until
the professor shows himself as an
outspoken, effectual citizen, the
American image of the bumbling,
absent-minded, disorganized pro
fessor will never be laid to rest.
Quest for Truth
The argument that a professor
is devoted to the quest for truth,
that it is highly unprofessional to
take a stand on any issue upon
which only partial truth is avail
able, assumes that there are solu
t ion s of absolute certainty. If
scholars proceeded according to
this method, however, there would
never be an article published.
It is the duty of every man to
act on partial truths, just as it is
his duty to find out as much truth
as possible before he acts.
Dr. Sibley's discussions about
the H-bomb indicated that he is
qualified to discuss the problem,
and his willingness to answer op
position shows his belief in the
most basic values of American
society.
Dr. Sibley would be a great
asset to Stanford University, and
it is the duty of every citizen of
this community to assure him—
and others like him—a place in
our midst.

the professor shows himself as an
outspoken, effectual citizen, the
American image of the bumbling,
absent-minded, disorganized pro
fessor will never be laid to rest.
Quest for Truth
The argument that a professor
is devoted to the quest for truth,
that it is highly unprofessional to
take a stand on any issue upon
which only partial truth is avail
able, assumes that there are solu
t ion s of absolute certainty. If
scholars proceeded according to
this method, however, there would
never be an article published.
It is the duty of every man to
act on partial truths, just as it is
his duty to find out as much truth
as possible before he acts.
Dr. Sibley's discussions about
the H-bomb indicated that he is
qualified to discuss the problem,
and his willingness to answer op
position shows his belief in the
most basic values of American
society.
Dr. Sibley would be a great
asset to Stanford University, and
it is the duty of every citizen of
this community to assure him—
and others like him—a place in
our midst.
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth unit final article in a sc
ries analyzing the power struc
ture of Stanford's Administra
tion, as reflected in the Sibley
case.)

The reticence of the Stanford
faculty in matters of internal ad
ministration and national politics
seems justified in view of the
present power structure and the
traditions of the University.
It is not justified in terms of
the paramount purpose of the
Founding Grant or the role of a
university in our society today.
The students have no tradition
of outspoken debate, no power in
the University structure, not even
a national association to protect
their rights, and yet this year
they have shown themselves the
only truly responsible members of
this institution.
Today's supplement in The
Daily, undertaken with full recog
nition of local, national and inter
national problems, shows the type
of criticism that will redound to
the good of the entire University.
Silencing Debate
The fear of baring Stanford's
problems to the public, to the
Board of Trustees, or to perspec
tive donors has continuously si
lenced intelligent debate —the
most effective method for arriv
ing at a union of fact and value.
Certainly the professors of this
University often express criticism
of its policies, but these criticisms
are almost always off the record
and not for publication.
When pressed they reply that
their suggestions will be offered
through proper channels. Proper
channels often have dead ends.
Public opinion is the greatest
force leading to effective imple
mentation of such suggestions,
and The Daily is the organ of pub
lic opinion at this University.
Members of the faculty have
noticed an apparent renaissance
of student intelligence and respon
sibility in the past three or four
years, culminating in the H-bomb
discussion and the protest over
Mulford Sibley's reappointment.
Student Energy
The student energy over these
two problems can either be har
nessed for the good of the Univer
sity or it can be so crushed that
any intellectual effort on the part
of next year's student body will
be fortuitous.
If the president and the faculty
remain silent until the end of this
quarter, Ihey will be able safely
to forget this year's problems and
begin next year with a clean slate
and status quo.
However, in order to make Stan
ford a leader in the reform of
American education, and a school
of which every intelligent student
and every great professor in the
nation would wish to become
members, the president and the
faculty should take immediate ac
tion at the coming meeting of the
Academic Council.
Crisis Similar
The crisis which the United
States faces in the world is essen
tially the same crisis which Stan
ford University faces: the prob
lem of instituting democratic val
ues into an administrative organi
zation traditionally allied with
self-interest, autocracy and arbi
trary power.

The effect of the United States
as an exporter of values is con
tinually defeated by the traditions
of nationalism; the effect of Stan
ford as a university is continually
defeated by the traditions of 19th
century corporate structure, of
which the present administrative
structure seems to be an example.
The following suggestions are
in no way definitive; only through
free and open discussion, based
upon complete information, may
solutions become so.
The case of Dr. Sibley's appoint
ment should be brought before
the Academic Council as a whole,
and a recommendation, along with
the president's opinion, should be
sent through the Advisory Coun
cil to ihe Board of Trustees.
Recommendation
The council's recommendation
need not be unanimous; it should
include both a majority and a dis
senting opinion.
In view of the present informa
tion, any reversal of the Sibley de
cision by the President's Office
would not jeopardize authority.
The Articles of Organization of
the Faculty should be examined,
and a suggestion for their revi
sion, giving effective power to the
Advisory Council, should be for
warded in the same manner as
Dr. Sibley's appointment.
Leading students of the Univer
sity should be invited to attend
the council meeting to express
their opinions. They need be given
no other power than the expres
sion of opinion based on full
knowledge of what is taking
place.
Admissions Policies
The admissions policies should
he reviewed and overhauled to
give effective control to the fac
ulty. Stanford is directed by the
Founding Grant to "qualify its
students for personal success,"
and the development of an intel
lectual community of students is
essential to this.
A permanent committee should
be established as part of the Ad
visory Council, for continuous ex
amination of University functions
and for the evaluation of all Uni
versity decisions in accordance
with a unified philosophy of edu
cation.
A recent writer states that the
"aspects of education which the
administration must take into ac
count" are "concerned with rela
tions of the school to the public
that supports it, of the schools to
society, of education to political
Iheory in general, as well as with
the details of educational admin
istration and organization — the
cost of education or even school
buildings may be affected by cer
tain philosophical points of view.
Education, Philosophy
"... It is precisely because these
determining factors have been
neglected in the study of educa
tional philosophy that public edu
cation has encountered many of
its recent difficulties and that so
many conflicts have arisen on aca
demic freedom, controversial is
sues and social change through
education" (I. L. Kandel, "Philoso
phy of Education," Harvard Edu
cational Review, vol. XXVI, No. 2.
spring 1956, p. 135).
The examination committee of
the Advisory Council must in
clude members of the Administra
tion, the faculty and the student
body. It must have free access to

all information. Its function
would be to propose legislation to
the council, to publish all perti
nent information to the commu
nity at large and to examine the
slate of public opinion upon this
information.
Politics
Mrs. Stanford proposed th e
question fairly to the faculty in
an amendment to tin 1 Founding
Grant on Oct. 3. 1902, stating that,
in her opinion, "the true reason
why professors of other universi
ties have nearly altogether ab
stained from entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion
of political and other questions
upon which public feeling runs
high and upon which the public is
itself divided" is that "he is being
deemed by his hearers, or any of
them, to be speaking for his uni
versity and voicing its views."
In the last 10 years especially
it has been established that pro
fessors do not represent the spe
cific views of the University, ei
ther in the classroom or upon a
public rostrum.
The University endorses no spe
cific legislation or ideas—it en
dorses a way of thinking, a meth
od of free and open debate.
Students learn as much from
the personality of a professor as
they do from his ideas, and until
the professor shows himself as an
outspoken, effectual citizen, the
American image of the bumbling,
absent-minded, disorganized pro
fessor will never be laid to rest.

slate of public opinion upon this
information.
Politics
Mrs. Stanford proposed th e
question fairly to the faculty in
an amendment to tin 1 Founding
Grant on Oct. 3. 1902, stating that,
in her opinion, "the true reason
why professors of other universi
ties have nearly altogether ab
stained from entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion
of political and other questions
upon which public feeling runs
high and upon which the public is
itself divided" is that "he is being
deemed by his hearers, or any of
them, to be speaking for his uni
versity and voicing its views."
In the last 10 years especially
it has been established that pro
fessors do not represent the spe
cific views of the University, ei
ther in the classroom or upon a
public rostrum.
The University endorses no spe
cific legislation or ideas—it en
dorses a way of thinking, a meth
od of free and open debate.
Students learn as much from
the personality of a professor as
they do from his ideas, and until
the professor shows himself as an
outspoken, effectual citizen, the
American image of the bumbling,
absent-minded, disorganized pro
fessor will never be laid to rest.
Quest for Truth
The argument that a professor
is devoted to the quest for truth,
that it is highly unprofessional to
take a stand on any issue upon
which only partial truth is avail
able, assumes that there are solu
t ion s of absolute certainty. If
scholars proceeded according to
this method, however, there would
never be an article published.
It is the duty of every man to
act on partial truths, just as it is
his duty to find out as much truth
as possible before he acts.
Dr. Sibley's discussions about
the H-bomb indicated that he is
qualified to discuss the problem,
and his willingness to answer op
position shows his belief in the
most basic values of American
society.
Dr. Sibley would be a great
asset to Stanford University, and
it is the duty of every citizen of
this community to assure him—
and others like him—a place in
our midst.
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth unit final article in a sc
ries analyzing the power struc
ture of Stanford's Administra
tion, as reflected in the Sibley
case.)

The reticence of the Stanford
faculty in matters of internal ad
ministration and national politics
seems justified in view of the
present power structure and the
traditions of the University.
It is not justified in terms of
the paramount purpose of the
Founding Grant or the role of a
university in our society today.
The students have no tradition
of outspoken debate, no power in
the University structure, not even
a national association to protect
their rights, and yet this year
they have shown themselves the
only truly responsible members of
this institution.
Today's supplement in The
Daily, undertaken with full recog
nition of local, national and inter
national problems, shows the type
of criticism that will redound to
the good of the entire University.
Silencing Debate
The fear of baring Stanford's
problems to the public, to the
Board of Trustees, or to perspec
tive donors has continuously si
lenced intelligent debate —the
most effective method for arriv
ing at a union of fact and value.
Certainly the professors of this
University often express criticism
of its policies, but these criticisms
are almost always off the record
and not for publication.
When pressed they reply that
their suggestions will be offered
through proper channels. Proper
channels often have dead ends.
Public opinion is the greatest
force leading to effective imple
mentation of such suggestions,
and The Daily is the organ of pub
lic opinion at this University.
Members of the faculty have
noticed an apparent renaissance
of student intelligence and respon
sibility in the past three or four
years, culminating in the H-bomb
discussion and the protest over
Mulford Sibley's reappointment.
Student Energy
The student energy over these
two problems can either be har
nessed for the good of the Univer
sity or it can be so crushed that
any intellectual effort on the part
of next year's student body will
be fortuitous.
If the president and the faculty
remain silent until the end of this
quarter, Ihey will be able safely
to forget this year's problems and
begin next year with a clean slate
and status quo.
However, in order to make Stan
ford a leader in the reform of
American education, and a school
of which every intelligent student
and every great professor in the
nation would wish to become
members, the president and the
faculty should take immediate ac
tion at the coming meeting of the
Academic Council.
Crisis Similar
The crisis which the United
States faces in the world is essen
tially the same crisis which Stan
ford University faces: the prob
lem of instituting democratic val
ues into an administrative organi
zation traditionally allied with
self-interest, autocracy and arbi
trary power.

The effect of the United States
as an exporter of values is con
tinually defeated by the traditions
of nationalism; the effect of Stan
ford as a university is continually
defeated by the traditions of 19th
century corporate structure, of
which the present administrative
structure seems to be an example.
The following suggestions are
in no way definitive; only through
free and open discussion, based
upon complete information, may
solutions become so.
The case of Dr. Sibley's appoint
ment should be brought before
the Academic Council as a whole,
and a recommendation, along with
the president's opinion, should be
sent through the Advisory Coun
cil to ihe Board of Trustees.
Recommendation
The council's recommendation
need not be unanimous; it should
include both a majority and a dis
senting opinion.
In view of the present informa
tion, any reversal of the Sibley de
cision by the President's Office
would not jeopardize authority.
The Articles of Organization of
the Faculty should be examined,
and a suggestion for their revi
sion, giving effective power to the
Advisory Council, should be for
warded in the same manner as
Dr. Sibley's appointment.
Leading students of the Univer
sity should be invited to attend
the council meeting to express
their opinions. They need be given
no other power than the expres
sion of opinion based on full
knowledge of what is taking
place.
Admissions Policies
The admissions policies should
he reviewed and overhauled to
give effective control to the fac
ulty. Stanford is directed by the
Founding Grant to "qualify its
students for personal success,"
and the development of an intel
lectual community of students is
essential to this.
A permanent committee should
be established as part of the Ad
visory Council, for continuous ex
amination of University functions
and for the evaluation of all Uni
versity decisions in accordance
with a unified philosophy of edu
cation.
A recent writer states that the
"aspects of education which the
administration must take into ac
count" are "concerned with rela
tions of the school to the public
that supports it, of the schools to
society, of education to political
Iheory in general, as well as with
the details of educational admin
istration and organization — the
cost of education or even school
buildings may be affected by cer
tain philosophical points of view.
Education, Philosophy
"... It is precisely because these
determining factors have been
neglected in the study of educa
tional philosophy that public edu
cation has encountered many of
its recent difficulties and that so
many conflicts have arisen on aca
demic freedom, controversial is
sues and social change through
education" (I. L. Kandel, "Philoso
phy of Education," Harvard Edu
cational Review, vol. XXVI, No. 2.
spring 1956, p. 135).
The examination committee of
the Advisory Council must in
clude members of the Administra
tion, the faculty and the student
body. It must have free access to

all information. Its function
would be to propose legislation to
the council, to publish all perti
nent information to the commu
nity at large and to examine the
slate of public opinion upon this
information.

Education, Philosophy
"... It is precisely because these

its recent difficulties and that so
many conflicts have arisen on aca
demic freedom, controversial is

The examination committee of
the Advisory Council must in
clude members of the Administra
tion, the faculty and the student
body. It must have free access to

all information. Its function
would be to propose legislation to
the council, to publish all perti
nent information to the commu
nity at large and to examine the
slate of public opinion upon this
information.
Politics
Mrs. Stanford proposed th e
question fairly to the faculty in
an amendment to tin 1 Founding
Grant on Oct. 3. 1902, stating that,
in her opinion, "the true reason
why professors of other universi
ties have nearly altogether ab
stained from entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion
of political and other questions
upon which public feeling runs
high and upon which the public is
itself divided" is that "he is being
deemed by his hearers, or any of
them, to be speaking for his uni
versity and voicing its views."
In the last 10 years especially
it has been established that pro
fessors do not represent the spe
cific views of the University, ei
ther in the classroom or upon a
public rostrum.
The University endorses no spe
cific legislation or ideas—it en
dorses a way of thinking, a meth
od of free and open debate.
Students learn as much from
the personality of a professor as
they do from his ideas, and until
the professor shows himself as an
outspoken, effectual citizen, the
American image of the bumbling,
absent-minded, disorganized pro
fessor will never be laid to rest.
Quest for Truth
The argument that a professor
is devoted to the quest for truth,
that it is highly unprofessional to
take a stand on any issue upon
which only partial truth is avail
able, assumes that there are solu
t ion s of absolute certainty. If
scholars proceeded according to
this method, however, there would
never be an article published.
It is the duty of every man to
act on partial truths, just as it is
his duty to find out as much truth
as possible before he acts.
Dr. Sibley's discussions about
the H-bomb indicated that he is
qualified to discuss the problem,
and his willingness to answer op
position shows his belief in the
most basic values of American
society.
Dr. Sibley would be a great
asset to Stanford University, and
it is the duty of every citizen of
this community to assure him—
and others like him—a place in
our midst.
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth unit final article in a sc
ries analyzing the power struc
ture of Stanford's Administra
tion, as reflected in the Sibley
case.)

The reticence of the Stanford
faculty in matters of internal ad
ministration and national politics
seems justified in view of the
present power structure and the
traditions of the University.
It is not justified in terms of
the paramount purpose of the
Founding Grant or the role of a
university in our society today.
The students have no tradition
of outspoken debate, no power in
the University structure, not even
a national association to protect
their rights, and yet this year
they have shown themselves the
only truly responsible members of
this institution.
Today's supplement in The
Daily, undertaken with full recog
nition of local, national and inter
national problems, shows the type
of criticism that will redound to
the good of the entire University.
Silencing Debate
The fear of baring Stanford's
problems to the public, to the
Board of Trustees, or to perspec
tive donors has continuously si
lenced intelligent debate —the
most effective method for arriv
ing at a union of fact and value.
Certainly the professors of this
University often express criticism
of its policies, but these criticisms
are almost always off the record
and not for publication.
When pressed they reply that
their suggestions will be offered
through proper channels. Proper
channels often have dead ends.
Public opinion is the greatest
force leading to effective imple
mentation of such suggestions,
and The Daily is the organ of pub
lic opinion at this University.
Members of the faculty have
noticed an apparent renaissance
of student intelligence and respon
sibility in the past three or four
years, culminating in the H-bomb
discussion and the protest over
Mulford Sibley's reappointment.
Student Energy
The student energy over these
two problems can either be har
nessed for the good of the Univer
sity or it can be so crushed that
any intellectual effort on the part
of next year's student body will
be fortuitous.
If the president and the faculty
remain silent until the end of this
quarter, Ihey will be able safely
to forget this year's problems and
begin next year with a clean slate
and status quo.
However, in order to make Stan
ford a leader in the reform of
American education, and a school
of which every intelligent student
and every great professor in the
nation would wish to become
members, the president and the
faculty should take immediate ac
tion at the coming meeting of the
Academic Council.
Crisis Similar
The crisis which the United
States faces in the world is essen
tially the same crisis which Stan
ford University faces: the prob
lem of instituting democratic val
ues into an administrative organi
zation traditionally allied with
self-interest, autocracy and arbi
trary power.

The effect of the United States
as an exporter of values is con
tinually defeated by the traditions
of nationalism; the effect of Stan
ford as a university is continually
defeated by the traditions of 19th
century corporate structure, of
which the present administrative
structure seems to be an example.
The following suggestions are
in no way definitive; only through
free and open discussion, based
upon complete information, may
solutions become so.
The case of Dr. Sibley's appoint
ment should be brought before
the Academic Council as a whole,
and a recommendation, along with
the president's opinion, should be
sent through the Advisory Coun
cil to ihe Board of Trustees.
Recommendation
The council's recommendation
need not be unanimous; it should
include both a majority and a dis
senting opinion.
In view of the present informa
tion, any reversal of the Sibley de
cision by the President's Office
would not jeopardize authority.
The Articles of Organization of
the Faculty should be examined,
and a suggestion for their revi
sion, giving effective power to the
Advisory Council, should be for
warded in the same manner as
Dr. Sibley's appointment.
Leading students of the Univer
sity should be invited to attend
the council meeting to express
their opinions. They need be given
no other power than the expres
sion of opinion based on full
knowledge of what is taking
place.
Admissions Policies
The admissions policies should
he reviewed and overhauled to
give effective control to the fac
ulty. Stanford is directed by the
Founding Grant to "qualify its
students for personal success,"
and the development of an intel
lectual community of students is
essential to this.
A permanent committee should
be established as part of the Ad
visory Council, for continuous ex
amination of University functions
and for the evaluation of all Uni
versity decisions in accordance
with a unified philosophy of edu
cation.
A recent writer states that the
"aspects of education which the
administration must take into ac
count" are "concerned with rela
tions of the school to the public
that supports it, of the schools to
society, of education to political
Iheory in general, as well as with
the details of educational admin
istration and organization — the
cost of education or even school

and a suggestion for their revi
sion, giving effective power to the
Advisory Council, should be for
warded in the same manner as
Dr. Sibley's appointment.
Leading students of the Univer
sity should be invited to attend
the council meeting to express
their opinions. They need be given
no other power than the expres
sion of opinion based on full
knowledge of what is taking
place.
Admissions Policies
The admissions policies should
he reviewed and overhauled to
give effective control to the fac
ulty. Stanford is directed by the
Founding Grant to "qualify its
students for personal success,"
and the development of an intel
lectual community of students is
essential to this.
A permanent committee should
be established as part of the Ad
visory Council, for continuous ex
amination of University functions
and for the evaluation of all Uni
versity decisions in accordance
with a unified philosophy of edu
cation.
A recent writer states that the
"aspects of education which the
administration must take into ac
count" are "concerned with rela
tions of the school to the public
that supports it, of the schools to
society, of education to political
Iheory in general, as well as with
the details of educational admin
istration and organization — the
cost of education or even school
buildings may be affected by cer
tain philosophical points of view.
Education, Philosophy
"... It is precisely because these
determining factors have been
neglected in the study of educa
tional philosophy that public edu
cation has encountered many of
its recent difficulties and that so
many conflicts have arisen on aca
demic freedom, controversial is
sues and social change through
education" (I. L. Kandel, "Philoso
phy of Education," Harvard Edu
cational Review, vol. XXVI, No. 2.
spring 1956, p. 135).
The examination committee of
the Advisory Council must in
clude members of the Administra
tion, the faculty and the student
body. It must have free access to

all information. Its function
would be to propose legislation to
the council, to publish all perti
nent information to the commu
nity at large and to examine the
slate of public opinion upon this
information.
Politics
Mrs. Stanford proposed th e
question fairly to the faculty in
an amendment to tin 1 Founding
Grant on Oct. 3. 1902, stating that,
in her opinion, "the true reason
why professors of other universi
ties have nearly altogether ab
stained from entering upon the
public rostrum in the discussion
of political and other questions
upon which public feeling runs
high and upon which the public is
itself divided" is that "he is being
deemed by his hearers, or any of
them, to be speaking for his uni
versity and voicing its views."
In the last 10 years especially
it has been established that pro
fessors do not represent the spe
cific views of the University, ei
ther in the classroom or upon a
public rostrum.
The University endorses no spe
cific legislation or ideas—it en
dorses a way of thinking, a meth
od of free and open debate.
Students learn as much from
the personality of a professor as
they do from his ideas, and until
the professor shows himself as an
outspoken, effectual citizen, the
American image of the bumbling,
absent-minded, disorganized pro
fessor will never be laid to rest.
Quest for Truth
The argument that a professor
is devoted to the quest for truth,
that it is highly unprofessional to
take a stand on any issue upon
which only partial truth is avail
able, assumes that there are solu
t ion s of absolute certainty. If
scholars proceeded according to
this method, however, there would
never be an article published.
It is the duty of every man to
act on partial truths, just as it is
his duty to find out as much truth
as possible before he acts.
Dr. Sibley's discussions about
the H-bomb indicated that he is
qualified to discuss the problem,
and his willingness to answer op
position shows his belief in the
most basic values of American
society.
Dr. Sibley would be a great
asset to Stanford University, and
it is the duty of every citizen of
this community to assure him—
and others like him—a place in
our midst.
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth unit final article in a sc
ries analyzing the power struc
ture of Stanford's Administra
tion, as reflected in the Sibley
case.)

The reticence of the Stanford
faculty in matters of internal ad
ministration and national politics
seems justified in view of the
present power structure and the
traditions of the University.
It is not justified in terms of
the paramount purpose of the
Founding Grant or the role of a
university in our society today.
The students have no tradition
of outspoken debate, no power in
the University structure, not even
a national association to protect
their rights, and yet this year
they have shown themselves the
only truly responsible members of
this institution.
Today's supplement in The
Daily, undertaken with full recog
nition of local, national and inter
national problems, shows the type
of criticism that will redound to
the good of the entire University.
Silencing Debate
The fear of baring Stanford's
problems to the public, to the
Board of Trustees, or to perspec
tive donors has continuously si
lenced intelligent debate —the
most effective method for arriv
ing at a union of fact and value.
Certainly the professors of this
University often express criticism
of its policies, but these criticisms
are almost always off the record
and not for publication.
When pressed they reply that
their suggestions will be offered
through proper channels. Proper
channels often have dead ends.
Public opinion is the greatest
force leading to effective imple
mentation of such suggestions,
and The Daily is the organ of pub
lic opinion at this University.
Members of the faculty have
noticed an apparent renaissance
of student intelligence and respon
sibility in the past three or four
years, culminating in the H-bomb
discussion and the protest over
Mulford Sibley's reappointment.
Student Energy
The student energy over these
two problems can either be har
nessed for the good of the Univer
sity or it can be so crushed that
any intellectual effort on the part
of next year's student body will
be fortuitous.
If the president and the faculty
remain silent until the end of this
quarter, Ihey will be able safely
to forget this year's problems and
begin next year with a clean slate
and status quo.
However, in order to make Stan
ford a leader in the reform of
American education, and a school
of which every intelligent student
and every great professor in the
nation would wish to become
members, the president and the
faculty should take immediate ac
tion at the coming meeting of the
Academic Council.
Crisis Similar
The crisis which the United
States faces in the world is essen
tially the same crisis which Stan
ford University faces: the prob
lem of instituting democratic val
ues into an administrative organi
zation traditionally allied with
self-interest, autocracy and arbi
trary power.

The effect of the United States
as an exporter of values is con
tinually defeated by the traditions
of nationalism; the effect of Stan
ford as a university is continually
defeated by the traditions of 19th
century corporate structure, of
which the present administrative
structure seems to be an example.
The following suggestions are
in no way definitive; only through
free and open discussion, based
upon complete information, may
solutions become so.
The case of Dr. Sibley's appoint
ment should be brought before
the Academic Council as a whole,
and a recommendation, along with
the president's opinion, should be
sent through the Advisory Coun
cil to ihe Board of Trustees.
Recommendation
The council's recommendation
need not be unanimous; it should
include both a majority and a dis
senting opinion.
In view of the present informa
tion, any reversal of the Sibley de
cision by the President's Office
would not jeopardize authority.
The Articles of Organization of
the Faculty should be examined,
and a suggestion for their revi
sion, giving effective power to the
Advisory Council, should be for
warded in the same manner as
Dr. Sibley's appointment.
Leading students of the Univer
sity should be invited to attend
the council meeting to express
their opinions. They need be given
no other power than the expres
