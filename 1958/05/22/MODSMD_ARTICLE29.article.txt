## 
### 
Some of the finest collegiate
golfers in tho country will be seen
in action this week end on the
Stanford Golf Course, ihe site of
the first All-Pacific Coast Confer
ence Tournament in history. Play
will commence tomorrow morning
at 7:30 and continue through Sat
urday.
Each school of the regular PCC
will he represented by a six-man
team, exc e p t for Washington
State with four. There will be 72
total holes of play- 36 each day—
with teeing-off times for the first
foursomes at 7:30 a.m. and 12:30
p.m.
A trophy will be awarded to the
winning team, the one with the
four lowest men. The individual
winner and the runner-up will be
awarded medals. Some indication
should also be given as to which
schools will send teams to repre
sent them in the NCAA tourna
ment in June.
Good Spectator Kvent
The tournament should prove
a good spectator event in view of
the quality of competition entered.
Many of ihe players are rated
highly in national amateur stand
ing, and the teams are all quite
strong. There is no gallery fee.
Rated to win it with some strug
gle is the powerful University of
Southern California squad. Back
ed by National Junior and Cali
fornia Amateur stars Bob McCal
lister and Allen Geiberger, they
have both the strength and the
depth to score a significant vic
tory.
Tight Battle
Right on their heels, however,
are the squads from Stanford, Or
egon, Idaho and UCLA. Oregon
won the Northern Division dual
match championship this year
and is undefeated in collegiate
play. The Foote brothers from
UCLA Dick and Bill -also are
standouts in southern California
amateur play and should prove a
tough combination to beat.
Idaho also has a brother team,
their first and second men, Dick
and Rusty Sheppard. Dick holds
the Idaho course record of 59 for
a par 70 course. The teams from
California, Washington, Oregon
State and Washington State are
also given a chance to sneak in.
but their squads lack the neces
sary depth.
Regular Indian Team
Playing for Stanford will be the
regular six men—Bill Seanor, Bob
Bither, Alf Burtleson, Bernie Mag
nussen, Woodgie Reich and Mike
Shanahan. Seanor is expected to
have recovered partially from the
knee injury he suffered last week,
and has a good chance to «neak
away with the individual title.
So far this season the Card
team has lost only two matches,
both the same week end, to USC
and UCLA. They suffered close
defeats, losing to both by 1 point.
Against Cal they won twice, 23 1 -
3V 2 and 19-8. They have not play
ed any of the schools in the North
ern Division yet this season.
Among other victims of this
year's Stanford linksters are the
San .lose Spartans. The Indians
have whipped the Spartans twicc
this year by fairly decisive scores.

State with four. There will be 72
total holes of play- 36 each day—
with teeing-off times for the first
foursomes at 7:30 a.m. and 12:30
p.m.
A trophy will be awarded to the
winning team, the one with the
four lowest men. The individual
winner and the runner-up will be

Good Spectator Kvent
The tournament should prove
a good spectator event in view of
the quality of competition entered.
Many of ihe players are rated
highly in national amateur stand
ing, and the teams are all quite
strong. There is no gallery fee.
Rated to win it with some strug
gle is the powerful University of
Southern California squad. Back
ed by National Junior and Cali
fornia Amateur stars Bob McCal
lister and Allen Geiberger, they
have both the strength and the
depth to score a significant vic
tory.
Tight Battle
Right on their heels, however,
are the squads from Stanford, Or
egon, Idaho and UCLA. Oregon
won the Northern Division dual
match championship this year
and is undefeated in collegiate
play. The Foote brothers from
UCLA Dick and Bill -also are
standouts in southern California
amateur play and should prove a
tough combination to beat.
Idaho also has a brother team,
their first and second men, Dick
and Rusty Sheppard. Dick holds
the Idaho course record of 59 for
a par 70 course. The teams from
California, Washington, Oregon
State and Washington State are
also given a chance to sneak in.
but their squads lack the neces
sary depth.
Regular Indian Team
Playing for Stanford will be the
regular six men—Bill Seanor, Bob
Bither, Alf Burtleson, Bernie Mag
nussen, Woodgie Reich and Mike
Shanahan. Seanor is expected to
have recovered partially from the
knee injury he suffered last week,
and has a good chance to «neak
away with the individual title.
So far this season the Card
team has lost only two matches,
both the same week end, to USC
and UCLA. They suffered close
defeats, losing to both by 1 point.
Against Cal they won twice, 23 1 -
3V 2 and 19-8. They have not play
ed any of the schools in the North
ern Division yet this season.
Among other victims of this
year's Stanford linksters are the
San .lose Spartans. The Indians
have whipped the Spartans twicc
this year by fairly decisive scores.
