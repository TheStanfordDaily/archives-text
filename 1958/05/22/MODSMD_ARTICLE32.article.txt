# Nelson, Douglas to Play In PCC Net tourney
## 
### 
Dave Nelson and Jack Douglas
will carry all of Stanford's tennis
hopes in the first annual PCC
tennis championships to be held
in Seattle this week end.
Each of the PCC schools will
send two representatives to the
tourney and will enter two men
in singles and one doubles team.
UCLA's two-man team, consist
ing of Mike Franks and John
Cranston, are pre-tourney favor
ites to cop the title over USC's
combo of A 1 Olmedo and Gordon
Davis. Stanford appears to be the
dark - horse selection again, but
probably will finish third behind
the southlanders.
After Stanford, USC and UCLA,
the rest of the conference pre
sents only a very small amount
of talent. Washington's team of
Larry Mounger and Dave Kono
could pull a surprise, but the
chances are very slim.
Nelson Impressive
Dave Nelson won his berth in
the tourney through some top
notch play of late. He has stead
ily improved all year long and
has been the only consistent win
ner on the Indian team. In the
two matches over last week end
between USC, UCLA and Stan
ford, Nelson looked very impres
sive.
He defeated SC's Gordon Davis
and the following day put up a
tough light against UCLA's John
Cranston. Nelson played the Cran
ston match under the handicap of
a slight foot blister, which he
hopes will bo healed by tomorrow.
However, even in top shape Nel
son will still have a real tough

time defeating Cranston, if he
should meet him in tourney play.
Jack Douglas, whose game has
been fluctuating quite a bit this
season, will have to be in one of
his better streaks if Coach Ren
ker's team is going to do any bet
ter than finish third.
Last week end, against UCLA's
John Lesch, Douglas looked in
fairly good shape. When he need
ed to, Douglas was able to pour
placement after placement past
Lesch. The only trouble Douglas
had was with his continual hin
drance his serve. In the second
set Lesch broke Ihe Santa Moni
can's serve practically at will.
New Serve
In hopes of strengthening his
serving game, Douglas has done
.some work this past week on a
new second serve. In hitting this
serve, he uses a great deal more
•spin than he has ever used before.
Nelson and Douglas will team
up together in the doubles com
petition. So far this year Nelson
has played almost entirely with
Lowell Carruth as his doubles
partner, and Douglas has played
with Brooks Rawlins. However,
last year Nelson and Douglas
played together in the No. 1 dou
bles spot and are therefore •some
what acquainted with each other's
doubles game.
In the doubles competition last
year Douglas and Nelson combin
ed to win six of 10 matches, but
the majority of their wins were
over very weak opponents. The
one feature that floes stand in
their favor, however, is the phe
nomenal improvement of Nelson
this year.

John Lesch, Douglas looked in
fairly good shape. When he need
ed to, Douglas was able to pour
placement after placement past
Lesch. The only trouble Douglas
had was with his continual hin
drance his serve. In the second
set Lesch broke Ihe Santa Moni
can's serve practically at will.
New Serve
In hopes of strengthening his
serving game, Douglas has done
.some work this past week on a
new second serve. In hitting this
serve, he uses a great deal more
•spin than he has ever used before.
Nelson and Douglas will team
up together in the doubles com
petition. So far this year Nelson
has played almost entirely with
Lowell Carruth as his doubles
partner, and Douglas has played
with Brooks Rawlins. However,
last year Nelson and Douglas
played together in the No. 1 dou
bles spot and are therefore •some
what acquainted with each other's
doubles game.
In the doubles competition last
year Douglas and Nelson combin
ed to win six of 10 matches, but
the majority of their wins were
over very weak opponents. The
one feature that floes stand in
their favor, however, is the phe
nomenal improvement of Nelson
this year.
Dave Nelson and Jack Douglas
will carry all of Stanford's tennis
hopes in the first annual PCC
tennis championships to be held
in Seattle this week end.
Each of the PCC schools will
send two representatives to the
tourney and will enter two men
in singles and one doubles team.
UCLA's two-man team, consist
ing of Mike Franks and John
Cranston, are pre-tourney favor
ites to cop the title over USC's
combo of A 1 Olmedo and Gordon
Davis. Stanford appears to be the
dark - horse selection again, but
probably will finish third behind
the southlanders.
After Stanford, USC and UCLA,
the rest of the conference pre
sents only a very small amount
of talent. Washington's team of
Larry Mounger and Dave Kono
could pull a surprise, but the
chances are very slim.
Nelson Impressive
Dave Nelson won his berth in
the tourney through some top
notch play of late. He has stead
ily improved all year long and
has been the only consistent win
ner on the Indian team. In the
two matches over last week end
between USC, UCLA and Stan
ford, Nelson looked very impres
sive.
He defeated SC's Gordon Davis
and the following day put up a
tough light against UCLA's John
Cranston. Nelson played the Cran
ston match under the handicap of
a slight foot blister, which he
hopes will bo healed by tomorrow.
However, even in top shape Nel
son will still have a real tough

time defeating Cranston, if he
should meet him in tourney play.
Jack Douglas, whose game has
been fluctuating quite a bit this
season, will have to be in one of
his better streaks if Coach Ren
ker's team is going to do any bet
ter than finish third.
Last week end, against UCLA's
John Lesch, Douglas looked in
fairly good shape. When he need
ed to, Douglas was able to pour
placement after placement past
Lesch. The only trouble Douglas
had was with his continual hin
