WE PAY
$100.00 EACH
For Certain Lincoln Head Pennies
Do you sort your change at the cashier's or the grocer's? You have perhaps
found or handled a valuable United States coin. Just to illustrate: Certain
Indian head Pennies are worth $600 each; ccrtain Lincoln head Pennies,
$100 each; Nickels, $7,000 each; Dimes, $2,500 each; Quarters, $2,500
each; Half-Dollars, $3,250 each; Silver Dollars, $2,500 each. Their date
does not imply great age or antiquity, as ccrtain coins minted as recently
as the 1930's are worth Ten Dollars each, the reason due to the increasing
number of coin collectors and investors every year. We have prepared a
catalogue listing these coins and their values; we are prepared to pay any
one finding valuable coins. Our book contains the prices we offer. We
offer our valuable catalogue for One Dollar, which we shall rapidly refund
on our first Twenty-five Dollar purchase we make from you. Most coins
arc now in circulation and can be found by anyone. This is an honest and
interesting business offer. Send $1.00 today to the Viroqua Coin Co.,
Dept. BA-413, Viroqua, Wisconsin.
