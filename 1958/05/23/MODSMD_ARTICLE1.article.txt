# Symphony Plays Concert Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's Symphony Orchestra will present one of its final two
concerts of the 1937-58 season tonight at 8:30 in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
The program will consist of Haydn's Symphony No. 104 in D major
and the Ravel orchestration of Moussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhi-

bition."
Charles Cushing's "Poem for
Baritone and Orchestra" has been
added to the program. The work
was world-premiered by the Stan
ford Symphony Orchestra at the
University of California's Morri
son Music Festival and received
such acclaim that it was decided
to repeat it for a Stanford audi
ence, a spokesman said.
Based on Sonnet
Cushing, a faculty member of
the University of California mu
sic department, took for his text
Andrew Marvell's famous Eliza
bethan sonnet, "To His Coy Mis
tress," and composed an orches
tral accompaniment intended to
balance and complement the
poem.
Critics of the Berkeley per
formance said the orchestra was
"the best yet," and showed "much
life and spirit."
Sunday Concert
Sunday's concert, which begins
at 4 p.m., will substitute Ran
dall Thompson's "Ode to the Vir
ginian Voyage" for the Cushing
work. It will be given as a spe
cial tribute to the composer, who
has been a campus visitor this
week, and will be sung by the
University Chorus under the di
rection of Professor Harold C.
Schmidt.
In addition, the Sunday con
cert will include the Haydn and
Moussorgsky works.
The orchestra is under the di
rection of Sandor Salgo.
Tickets for both this evening's
and Sunday afternoon's concerts
are on sale at the auditorium and
the Peninsula Box Office in the
Town and Country Village at $1
for general admission, and 50
cents for students.
