# TROY HEAVILY FAVORED
## PCC Spike Championships Open Today at Berkeley 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford and seven other Pacific Coast Conference schools will
chase USC to the loop track and field championship today and to
morrow at Berkeley's Edwards Stadium.
Today's preliminaries in the sprints, hurdles, 410, weights and
broad jump will begin at 4 p.m. Finals will start tomorrow at 2.

Potency in the field events is
expected to be the key to another
Trojan team championship—their
17th in 18 yeai^s—but California
has the most first-place potential
on the track.
Strength on Track
Stanford's points will also come
primarily in the running events,
where the strongest part of the
18-man Indian team lies.
Individual battles should be
close in most of the events, with
only Willie White of Cal, two
miler Max Truex, high-jumper
Charlie Dumas and discus-throw
er .Rink Babka of USC, and pole
vaulter George Roubanis of UC
LA among the near-sure winners.
The Indians' Norman Lloyd
will renew his middle - distance
battles with California's Don
Bowden—the only catch is that
it's still not definite where they'll
meet.
Where's Bowden?
Lloyd will definitely go in the
880 and mile, but Brutus Hamil
ton keeps changing his mind, pub
licly at least, as to whether he'll
run Bowden in one or both of the
races.
No matter where the two meet,
they'll have more competition
than just each other. In the 880,
Ernie Cunliffe of Stanford, Jerry
Siebert of Cal and Wayne Lemons
of Troy can all offer strong re
sistance. If Bowden and Lloyd
have already run the mile before
the two-lapper comes around, up
set possibilities will be especially
good.
Hopes* for Repeat
Cunliffe, the perennial pace-set
ter, would like nothing better
than to repeat his Big Meet sur
prise. Then, he opened up such a
long lead that Bowden never
could catch him. Cunliffe's 1:50.2
is behind Lloyd's 1:49.2 and Bow
den's 1:49.8, but ahead of Sie
bert's 1:50.3 and Lemons' 1:50.9.
In the mile, Bowden has the
best seasonal mark 4:03.5 but
Lloyd, at 4:05.3, and .Tim Grelle
of Oregon, at 4:06.1, aren't far
back. And Jack Larson, the.4:07.2
sophomore from Washington,
can't bo counted out either.
White will try to become the
first man to ever win three events
in the PCC title meet. He should
have no trouble in the 100 and
220, but he'll face stiff competi
tion from Stanford's Chuck Cobb
in the low hurdles.
The big question mark about
Cobb is his physical condition.
Looking back on his pneumonia
attack, it's apparent that he was
a lot sicker than most people
thought. Since recovering, he's
still had trouble getting rapid
starts, and this could prove fatal
against the speedy White.
Cobb will also need to be tops
to beat out a good field in the
highs. He has a seasonal best of
13.9, but three olher men have
run 14.1 or 14.2.
Tribe Sprint Threat
Stanford's chief sprint threat is
Dean Smith. He could finish any
where from second to fifth in
both dashes, so closely buniched
is the field behind White.
Surest second-place man for the
Tribe is two-miler Maury Graves
—and he'll have a fair long-shot
chance to upset Truex. Graves
surprised Ihe Trojan ace two
years ago in the PCC meet, and
could win if the pace is even.
Strongest field event for the
Cards is the broad jump, where
Kent Hansen, John Kelly and A 1
Peterson each have a chance to
score against an unpredictable
field.
The rest of the Stanford en
tries:
100 and 220—Norm Pease, Ben
Anixter; 440—Dick Lassen; two
mile— Bob Monzingo; highs —
Skip Face; lows—Kelly; relay—
Cunliffe, Lloyd, Lassen and one
to be selected; pole vault —Mike
Franchetti, John Stahlcr; shot
put--Jerry Winters, Chris Plain;
javelin— Jim Backstrand, Hansen.

ERNIE CUNLIFFE
Dark Horse in 880
Stanford and seven other Pacific Coast Conference schools will
chase USC to the loop track and field championship today and to
morrow at Berkeley's Edwards Stadium.
Today's preliminaries in the sprints, hurdles, 410, weights and
broad jump will begin at 4 p.m. Finals will start tomorrow at 2.

Potency in the field events is
expected to be the key to another
Trojan team championship—their
17th in 18 yeai^s—but California
has the most first-place potential
on the track.
Strength on Track
Stanford's points will also come
primarily in the running events,
where the strongest part of the
18-man Indian team lies.
Individual battles should be
close in most of the events, with
only Willie White of Cal, two
miler Max Truex, high-jumper
Charlie Dumas and discus-throw
er .Rink Babka of USC, and pole
vaulter George Roubanis of UC
LA among the near-sure winners.
The Indians' Norman Lloyd
will renew his middle - distance
battles with California's Don
Bowden—the only catch is that
it's still not definite where they'll
meet.
Where's Bowden?
Lloyd will definitely go in the
880 and mile, but Brutus Hamil
ton keeps changing his mind, pub
licly at least, as to whether he'll
run Bowden in one or both of the
races.
No matter where the two meet,
they'll have more competition
than just each other. In the 880,
Ernie Cunliffe of Stanford, Jerry
Siebert of Cal and Wayne Lemons
of Troy can all offer strong re
sistance. If Bowden and Lloyd
have already run the mile before
the two-lapper comes around, up
set possibilities will be especially
good.
Hopes* for Repeat
Cunliffe, the perennial pace-set
ter, would like nothing better
than to repeat his Big Meet sur
prise. Then, he opened up such a
long lead that Bowden never
could catch him. Cunliffe's 1:50.2
is behind Lloyd's 1:49.2 and Bow
den's 1:49.8, but ahead of Sie
bert's 1:50.3 and Lemons' 1:50.9.
In the mile, Bowden has the
best seasonal mark 4:03.5 but
Lloyd, at 4:05.3, and .Tim Grelle
of Oregon, at 4:06.1, aren't far
back. And Jack Larson, the.4:07.2
sophomore from Washington,
can't bo counted out either.
White will try to become the
first man to ever win three events
in the PCC title meet. He should
have no trouble in the 100 and
220, but he'll face stiff competi
tion from Stanford's Chuck Cobb
in the low hurdles.
The big question mark about
Cobb is his physical condition.
Looking back on his pneumonia
attack, it's apparent that he was
a lot sicker than most people
thought. Since recovering, he's
still had trouble getting rapid
starts, and this could prove fatal
against the speedy White.
Cobb will also need to be tops
to beat out a good field in the
highs. He has a seasonal best of
13.9, but three olher men have
run 14.1 or 14.2.
Tribe Sprint Threat
Stanford's chief sprint threat is
Dean Smith. He could finish any
where from second to fifth in
both dashes, so closely buniched
is the field behind White.
Surest second-place man for the
Tribe is two-miler Maury Graves
—and he'll have a fair long-shot
chance to upset Truex. Graves
surprised Ihe Trojan ace two
years ago in the PCC meet, and
could win if the pace is even.
Strongest field event for the
Cards is the broad jump, where
Kent Hansen, John Kelly and A 1
Peterson each have a chance to
score against an unpredictable
field.
The rest of the Stanford en
tries:
100 and 220—Norm Pease, Ben
Anixter; 440—Dick Lassen; two
mile— Bob Monzingo; highs —
Skip Face; lows—Kelly; relay—
Cunliffe, Lloyd, Lassen and one

Dark Horse in 880
Stanford and seven other Pacific Coast Conference schools will
chase USC to the loop track and field championship today and to
morrow at Berkeley's Edwards Stadium.
Today's preliminaries in the sprints, hurdles, 410, weights and
broad jump will begin at 4 p.m. Finals will start tomorrow at 2.

Potency in the field events is
expected to be the key to another
Trojan team championship—their
17th in 18 yeai^s—but California
has the most first-place potential
on the track.
Strength on Track
Stanford's points will also come
primarily in the running events,
where the strongest part of the
18-man Indian team lies.
Individual battles should be
close in most of the events, with
only Willie White of Cal, two
miler Max Truex, high-jumper
Charlie Dumas and discus-throw
er .Rink Babka of USC, and pole
vaulter George Roubanis of UC
LA among the near-sure winners.
The Indians' Norman Lloyd
will renew his middle - distance
battles with California's Don
Bowden—the only catch is that
it's still not definite where they'll
meet.
Where's Bowden?
Lloyd will definitely go in the
880 and mile, but Brutus Hamil
ton keeps changing his mind, pub
licly at least, as to whether he'll
run Bowden in one or both of the
races.
No matter where the two meet,
they'll have more competition
than just each other. In the 880,
Ernie Cunliffe of Stanford, Jerry
Siebert of Cal and Wayne Lemons
of Troy can all offer strong re
sistance. If Bowden and Lloyd
have already run the mile before
the two-lapper comes around, up
set possibilities will be especially
good.
Hopes* for Repeat
Cunliffe, the perennial pace-set
ter, would like nothing better
than to repeat his Big Meet sur
prise. Then, he opened up such a
long lead that Bowden never
could catch him. Cunliffe's 1:50.2
is behind Lloyd's 1:49.2 and Bow
den's 1:49.8, but ahead of Sie
bert's 1:50.3 and Lemons' 1:50.9.
In the mile, Bowden has the
best seasonal mark 4:03.5 but
Lloyd, at 4:05.3, and .Tim Grelle
of Oregon, at 4:06.1, aren't far
back. And Jack Larson, the.4:07.2
sophomore from Washington,
can't bo counted out either.
White will try to become the
first man to ever win three events
in the PCC title meet. He should
have no trouble in the 100 and
220, but he'll face stiff competi
tion from Stanford's Chuck Cobb
in the low hurdles.
The big question mark about
Cobb is his physical condition.
Looking back on his pneumonia
attack, it's apparent that he was
a lot sicker than most people
thought. Since recovering, he's
still had trouble getting rapid
starts, and this could prove fatal
against the speedy White.
Cobb will also need to be tops
to beat out a good field in the
highs. He has a seasonal best of
13.9, but three olher men have
run 14.1 or 14.2.
Tribe Sprint Threat
Stanford's chief sprint threat is
Dean Smith. He could finish any
where from second to fifth in
both dashes, so closely buniched
is the field behind White.
Surest second-place man for the
Tribe is two-miler Maury Graves
—and he'll have a fair long-shot
chance to upset Truex. Graves
surprised Ihe Trojan ace two
years ago in the PCC meet, and
could win if the pace is even.
Strongest field event for the
Cards is the broad jump, where
Kent Hansen, John Kelly and A 1
Peterson each have a chance to
score against an unpredictable
field.

tries:
