# TROY HEAVILY FAVORED
## PCC Spike Championships Open Today at Berkeley 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Stanford and seven other Pacific Coast Conference schools will
chase USC to the loop track and field championship today and to
morrow at Berkeley's Edwards Stadium.
Today's preliminaries in the sprints, hurdles, 410, weights and
broad jump will begin at 4 p.m. Finals will start tomorrow at 2.

Potency in the field events is
expected to be the key to another
Trojan team championship—their
17th in 18 yeai^s—but California
has the most first-place potential
on the track.
Strength on Track
Stanford's points will also come
primarily in the running events,
where the strongest part of the
18-man Indian team lies.
Individual battles should be
close in most of the events, with
only Willie White of Cal, two
miler Max Truex, high-jumper
Charlie Dumas and discus-throw
er .Rink Babka of USC, and pole
vaulter George Roubanis of UC
LA among the near-sure winners.
The Indians' Norman Lloyd
will renew his middle - distance
battles with California's Don
Bowden—the only catch is that
it's still not definite where they'll
meet.
Where's Bowden?
Lloyd will definitely go in the
880 and mile, but Brutus Hamil
ton keeps changing his mind, pub
licly at least, as to whether he'll
run Bowden in one or both of the
races.
No matter where the two meet,
they'll have more competition
than just each other. In the 880,
Ernie Cunliffe of Stanford, Jerry
Siebert of Cal and Wayne Lemons
of Troy can all offer strong re
sistance. If Bowden and Lloyd
have already run the mile before
the two-lapper comes around, up
set possibilities will be especially
good.
Hopes* for Repeat
Cunliffe, the perennial pace-set
ter, would like nothing better
than to repeat his Big Meet sur
prise. Then, he opened up such a
long lead that Bowden never
could catch him. Cunliffe's 1:50.2
is behind Lloyd's 1:49.2 and Bow
den's 1:49.8, but ahead of Sie
bert's 1:50.3 and Lemons' 1:50.9.
In the mile, Bowden has the
best seasonal mark 4:03.5 but
Lloyd, at 4:05.3, and .Tim Grelle
of Oregon, at 4:06.1, aren't far
back. And Jack Larson, the.4:07.2
sophomore from Washington,
can't bo counted out either.
White will try to become the
