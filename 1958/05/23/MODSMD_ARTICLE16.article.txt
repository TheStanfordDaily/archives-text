# Nike Base Devastated; Blast Kills 7

### 
MIDDLETOWN, N.J. (/P) — A
Nike guided missile blew up at
its base here yesterday and ex
ploded six others in a tremendous
blast of fire and fury. Seven per
sons were known dead and three
others were missing.
The explosion apparently dis
integrated nearly all humanity
within range of its force. Only
one person was reported injured.
A great orange ball of fire
mushroomed above the missile
pads and cast an eerie, atomic
like pall over the scene. However,
the missiles did not have atomic
warheads. They had convention
al ones with shrapnel and high
explosives.
One of the sleek, liquid-fueled
rockets launched itself during the
instant of the explosion. It curved
in a sinister, unguidod flight path
for two miles over populated
areas but spent itself harmlessly
in open terrain.
The missiles were not supposed
to explode except by manual di
rection. There was no immediate
explanation of what touched
them off in the first mishap of its
kind since the Nike system be
came the mailed fist of U.S. aerial
defense.
However, the missiles were be
ing worked on at the time by a
team of experts. They were to be
replaced next year by Hercules
missiles capable of carrying atom
ic warheads.
