# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Mr. Dulles Over-Burdened 
### Walter Lippmann 
After his agreeable experience at the NATO
meeting in Copenhagen about two weeks ago—
agreeable because everyone present seemed to
agree with him—Secretary of State Dulles has
had a most disagreeable week. There is trouble
in Indonesia, in Lebanon, in Algeria and France,
and in Latin America. In all of them there is a
challenge to the existing position and policy of
this country. And in all of them the responsi
bility for deciding what to do next is centered
upon Mr. Dulles himself.
This should, I believe, raise in our minds the
question of whether the conduct of our foreign
policy has not become concentrated to a danger
ous degree—whether responsibility is not con
centrated to an unworkable degree in the mind
and conscience of one man. I think it has become
too concentrated, and that the price we pay for
it is that in large areas of the work! —as in the
Latin-American republics to the south of us and
in Canada to the north of us —tlie issues and our
interests and their interests are neglected. In
other areas which are immediately vital, as in
the Middle East and in continental Europe, our
appreciation of events is out of date and our poli
cies are vulnerable to the kind of surprise which
the French crisis and the advent of General De
Gaulle would surely bring.
•* <:• -si-
It is necessary to look candidly at our situa
tion; for the crucial difficulty in our dealing with
the multitude of problems is that Mr. Dulles has
more problems to decide than any man can pos
sibly attend to and know about and master.
Mr. Dulles himself is a marvel of endurance
and of intellectual vitality. But lie conducts his
office in a way which is plainly, as events are
showing, beyond human power. As President
Eisenhower's energy and interest have declined,
Mr. Dulles has received from the President the
greater part of the presidential powers in foreign
affairs — the powers which under our system
should be exercised by the President himself.
The result is that, for all practical purposes, ex
cepting only now ami then, the Secretary of State
does not have the support and comfort of know
ing that the final decision is with the President.
At the same time, Mr. Dulles is curiously sepa
rated from the State Department and the foreign
service. He has been, to an extraordinary degree,
his own ambassador. Is it any wonder that he

cannot attend to everything at once; that what
he does not attend to is neglected? Is it any
wonder that, with such an abnormal concentra
tion of responsibility in one man, our policies—
which need fresh analysis and reflection—are, as
in Latin America, for example, so complacent
and so insensitive?
* * *
One hesitates to suggest what might be done
to better this situation. Experience shows that
such suggestions are usually resented. Only
President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles can do any
thing about anything, and they are set in their
ways.
But it can be said, I think, that in the American
system things do not work well if in the conduct
of foreign affairs the President abdicates most
of his authority and lets it fall to his Secretary
of State. There are many reasons why this does
not work. One of them, the most important per
haps, is that the conduct of foreign relations re
quires not only negotiation abroad but the po
litical leadership of Congress at home. Half of
the underlying grievances of South America, for
example, are due to acts of omission and com
mission by the Congress. President Eisenhower
cannot fulfill the duties of his office by letting
Mr. Dulles try to perform them. President Eisen
hower needs somehow to have the means of doing
his own work, perhaps by calling into the White
House his own adviser in foreign affairs.
This is not meant as a way to supersede Mr.
Dulles, hut as a way to relieve him of an impos
sible burden. It is not at all a reflection on his
ability—which is high—unless it be a reflection
to say of any man that his powers have limits,
and that he cannot do everything.
* -IS- «
In my view, it is urgent that there should occur
at the center of the Administration reforms
which will, in effect, return to the White House
its necessary authority and to the Secretary of
State the time and the freedom to ponder the
great issues. It. is urgent because there is every
reason to think that the crisis in Algeria and in
France is not just another political crisis but is
in fact a crisis of the French system of govern
ment. If it is that, it will involve Europe and
NATO and mark the beginnning of a new chapter
in our foreign policy.

bility for deciding what to do next is centered
upon Mr. Dulles himself.
This should, I believe, raise in our minds the
question of whether the conduct of our foreign
policy has not become concentrated to a danger
ous degree—whether responsibility is not con
centrated to an unworkable degree in the mind
and conscience of one man. I think it has become
too concentrated, and that the price we pay for
it is that in large areas of the work! —as in the
Latin-American republics to the south of us and
in Canada to the north of us —tlie issues and our
interests and their interests are neglected. In
other areas which are immediately vital, as in
the Middle East and in continental Europe, our
appreciation of events is out of date and our poli
cies are vulnerable to the kind of surprise which
the French crisis and the advent of General De
Gaulle would surely bring.

It is necessary to look candidly at our situa
tion; for the crucial difficulty in our dealing with
the multitude of problems is that Mr. Dulles has
more problems to decide than any man can pos
sibly attend to and know about and master.
Mr. Dulles himself is a marvel of endurance
and of intellectual vitality. But lie conducts his
office in a way which is plainly, as events are
showing, beyond human power. As President
Eisenhower's energy and interest have declined,
Mr. Dulles has received from the President the
greater part of the presidential powers in foreign
affairs — the powers which under our system
should be exercised by the President himself.
The result is that, for all practical purposes, ex
cepting only now ami then, the Secretary of State
does not have the support and comfort of know
ing that the final decision is with the President.
At the same time, Mr. Dulles is curiously sepa
rated from the State Department and the foreign
service. He has been, to an extraordinary degree,
his own ambassador. Is it any wonder that he

cannot attend to everything at once; that what
he does not attend to is neglected? Is it any
wonder that, with such an abnormal concentra
tion of responsibility in one man, our policies—
which need fresh analysis and reflection—are, as
in Latin America, for example, so complacent
and so insensitive?
* * *
One hesitates to suggest what might be done
to better this situation. Experience shows that
such suggestions are usually resented. Only
President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles can do any
thing about anything, and they are set in their
ways.
But it can be said, I think, that in the American
system things do not work well if in the conduct
of foreign affairs the President abdicates most
of his authority and lets it fall to his Secretary
of State. There are many reasons why this does
not work. One of them, the most important per
haps, is that the conduct of foreign relations re
quires not only negotiation abroad but the po
litical leadership of Congress at home. Half of
the underlying grievances of South America, for
example, are due to acts of omission and com
mission by the Congress. President Eisenhower
cannot fulfill the duties of his office by letting
Mr. Dulles try to perform them. President Eisen
hower needs somehow to have the means of doing
his own work, perhaps by calling into the White
House his own adviser in foreign affairs.
This is not meant as a way to supersede Mr.
Dulles, hut as a way to relieve him of an impos
sible burden. It is not at all a reflection on his
ability—which is high—unless it be a reflection
to say of any man that his powers have limits,
and that he cannot do everything.

In my view, it is urgent that there should occur
at the center of the Administration reforms
which will, in effect, return to the White House
its necessary authority and to the Secretary of
State the time and the freedom to ponder the
great issues. It. is urgent because there is every
reason to think that the crisis in Algeria and in
France is not just another political crisis but is
in fact a crisis of the French system of govern
ment. If it is that, it will involve Europe and
NATO and mark the beginnning of a new chapter
in our foreign policy.

it is that in large areas of the work! —as in the
Latin-American republics to the south of us and
in Canada to the north of us —tlie issues and our
interests and their interests are neglected. In
other areas which are immediately vital, as in
the Middle East and in continental Europe, our
appreciation of events is out of date and our poli
cies are vulnerable to the kind of surprise which
the French crisis and the advent of General De
Gaulle would surely bring.

It is necessary to look candidly at our situa
tion; for the crucial difficulty in our dealing with
the multitude of problems is that Mr. Dulles has
more problems to decide than any man can pos
sibly attend to and know about and master.
Mr. Dulles himself is a marvel of endurance
and of intellectual vitality. But lie conducts his
office in a way which is plainly, as events are
showing, beyond human power. As President
Eisenhower's energy and interest have declined,
Mr. Dulles has received from the President the
greater part of the presidential powers in foreign
affairs — the powers which under our system
should be exercised by the President himself.
The result is that, for all practical purposes, ex
cepting only now ami then, the Secretary of State
does not have the support and comfort of know
ing that the final decision is with the President.
At the same time, Mr. Dulles is curiously sepa
rated from the State Department and the foreign
service. He has been, to an extraordinary degree,
his own ambassador. Is it any wonder that he

cannot attend to everything at once; that what
he does not attend to is neglected? Is it any
wonder that, with such an abnormal concentra
tion of responsibility in one man, our policies—
which need fresh analysis and reflection—are, as
in Latin America, for example, so complacent
and so insensitive?
* * *
One hesitates to suggest what might be done
to better this situation. Experience shows that
such suggestions are usually resented. Only
President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles can do any
thing about anything, and they are set in their
ways.
But it can be said, I think, that in the American
system things do not work well if in the conduct
of foreign affairs the President abdicates most
of his authority and lets it fall to his Secretary
of State. There are many reasons why this does
not work. One of them, the most important per
haps, is that the conduct of foreign relations re
quires not only negotiation abroad but the po
litical leadership of Congress at home. Half of
the underlying grievances of South America, for
example, are due to acts of omission and com
mission by the Congress. President Eisenhower
cannot fulfill the duties of his office by letting
Mr. Dulles try to perform them. President Eisen
hower needs somehow to have the means of doing
his own work, perhaps by calling into the White
House his own adviser in foreign affairs.
This is not meant as a way to supersede Mr.
Dulles, hut as a way to relieve him of an impos
sible burden. It is not at all a reflection on his
ability—which is high—unless it be a reflection
to say of any man that his powers have limits,
and that he cannot do everything.

In my view, it is urgent that there should occur
at the center of the Administration reforms
which will, in effect, return to the White House
its necessary authority and to the Secretary of
State the time and the freedom to ponder the
great issues. It. is urgent because there is every
reason to think that the crisis in Algeria and in
France is not just another political crisis but is
in fact a crisis of the French system of govern
ment. If it is that, it will involve Europe and
NATO and mark the beginnning of a new chapter
in our foreign policy.

After his agreeable experience at the NATO
meeting in Copenhagen about two weeks ago—
agreeable because everyone present seemed to
agree with him—Secretary of State Dulles has
had a most disagreeable week. There is trouble
in Indonesia, in Lebanon, in Algeria and France,
and in Latin America. In all of them there is a
challenge to the existing position and policy of
this country. And in all of them the responsi
bility for deciding what to do next is centered
upon Mr. Dulles himself.
This should, I believe, raise in our minds the
question of whether the conduct of our foreign
policy has not become concentrated to a danger
ous degree—whether responsibility is not con
centrated to an unworkable degree in the mind
and conscience of one man. I think it has become
too concentrated, and that the price we pay for
it is that in large areas of the work! —as in the
Latin-American republics to the south of us and
