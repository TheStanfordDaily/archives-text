Thank You am/ Farewell
Editor, The Daily:
It is difficult for many of us to understand how
Ihe University can afford not to keep a man who
has made such a valuable contribution to Stan
ford in his few months here, but the decision has
been made. Perhaps it is not for us to pass the
final judgment as to its wisdom. As students
we can only count the loss to ourselves, to Stan
ford. and to those who might have known him
here. Indeed, the loss seems rather great to those
of us who have known Dr. Sibley as a teacher and
a friend; we must express our tribute to him for
all he has meant 1o us.
We will always remember him as a man who
has opened our minds to new thoughts, a wider
perspective, and a more complete understanding
of tho world of men. He has offered us the kind
of stimulation which is often so absent here at
Stanford. He has heightened our interest in

knowledge; he has encouraged us to read and
Ihink and talk and write as most of us have
never done before; he has driven us to want to
learn through our own efforts, for he has given
meaning to education. It has not been only in
his lectures that he has made his contribution,
but also in his endless hours of conversation wilh
students in his office and in his willingness to
work with student groups. In short, he has been
what we think a teacher should be.
N'o doubt greater teachers have lived, but nol
many students have found a teacher who has
meant more to them; and only a handful have
meant as much. We are grateful for what Dr.
Sibley has done in his one year here and can re
ceive some consolation in knowing that even
though he cannot be at Stanford in the future
lie will always be sharing with students some
where the same sort of wisdom and stimulation
which he has shared with us.
In memoriam, we say thank you and farewell.
