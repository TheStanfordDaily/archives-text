### Jerry Wisot

the Stanford course in the Pacific Coast Conference's first league;
tournament in history.
As yet, the recent period of rainy weather has not had its effect J

on the course and Stanford Coach
Bud Finger stated that summer
rules would still be In effect.
Play will continue through to
morrow evening. Thirty-six holes
are scheduled for each day, with
the first threesome teeting off at.
7:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. There j
