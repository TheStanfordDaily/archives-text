# Bruins Choice In Conference Tennis Play
## 
### 
Play in the first annual PCC
tennis championships gets under
way this afternoon at Seattle,
with representatives from all nine
conference schools seeing action.
The singles tourney has been re
stricted to 18 players—two from
each sch o o I—and the doubles
tourney will have nine entries.
Favorites for singles title are
USC's A 1 Olmedo, UCLA's John
Cranston and Mike Franks, and
Stanford's Jack Douglas and Dave
Nelson.
The winning team will probably
have to place two players into the
semifinals, and it appears that
UCLA should have best chance of
doing this, with their strong warn
of Franks and Cranston.
