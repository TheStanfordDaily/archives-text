### Alan Miller 
Defending champion Stanford mermen face SC, UCLA and Cal this
afternoon and Saturday in the annual PCC Southern Division swim
ming championships at Berkeley where they are again favored to
win the title.
"Southern Cal, who beat us last month, is our only worry," com-

merited Indian head - man Tom
Haynie, "but I think we have the
depth and power to get by them
and win the championship again."
Four new league marks will au
tomatically be set this week end.
As the new NCAA ruling makes
the breast stroke a sur face stroke,
winning times in the 100 and 200-

yard breast strokes, 200-yard in
dividual medley and 400-yard med
ley relay will go down in the
books.
Backbone of the squad, Robin
Moore, who holds the conference
records of 22 flat in the 50 free
and 48.9 in the 100, is expected to
take honors in the 50, 100 and 220
for Stanford.
Tom Peterson, Treat Cafferata

and Denny Stimson look for
places in the 50 but will have to
pour 011 the steam to beat Mau
rice Kaplan and Bela Lugosi of
SC. Hank Fourcade and Caffer
ata should pull fourth and fifth
to Lugosi and Kaplan in the 100.
Jim Muir and Fourcade should
take fourth in the 440, with Ben
Jackson possibly taking sixth for
the warriors.
Tim Timkin, boasting the
league's best times of :57.0 and
2:16.0 in the 100- and 200-yard
butterflies, respectively, should
win these two top events for Stan
ford. A close finish for second in
both events among Winston Black
and John Gibbs of Stanford and
Fred Tissue and Pete McGeah of
USC is likely.
Another two first • places are
waiting for Stanford in the 100-
and 200-yard breast strokes, with
Tom Peterson and Bill Fuller
fighting it out.

Jim Muir posted Iris best time
of the season, 20:52, in the 1500-
meter free-style final, the only
race field yesterday, but was
able to grab only a fourth place,
netting the Indians 3 points.
Winner was Jim Small of Cal
in 18:15 —jnst three seconds off
the PCC record.

"Southern Cal, who beat us last month, is our only worry," com-

merited Indian head - man Tom
Haynie, "but I think we have the
depth and power to get by them
and win the championship again."
Four new league marks will au
tomatically be set this week end.
As the new NCAA ruling makes
the breast stroke a sur face stroke,
winning times in the 100 and 200-

yard breast strokes, 200-yard in
dividual medley and 400-yard med
ley relay will go down in the
books.
Backbone of the squad, Robin
Moore, who holds the conference
records of 22 flat in the 50 free
and 48.9 in the 100, is expected to
take honors in the 50, 100 and 220
for Stanford.
Tom Peterson, Treat Cafferata

and Denny Stimson look for
places in the 50 but will have to
pour 011 the steam to beat Mau
rice Kaplan and Bela Lugosi of
SC. Hank Fourcade and Caffer
ata should pull fourth and fifth
to Lugosi and Kaplan in the 100.
Jim Muir and Fourcade should
take fourth in the 440, with Ben
Jackson possibly taking sixth for
the warriors.
Tim Timkin, boasting the
league's best times of :57.0 and
2:16.0 in the 100- and 200-yard
butterflies, respectively, should
win these two top events for Stan
ford. A close finish for second in
both events among Winston Black
and John Gibbs of Stanford and
Fred Tissue and Pete McGeah of
USC is likely.
Another two first • places are
waiting for Stanford in the 100-
and 200-yard breast strokes, with
Tom Peterson and Bill Fuller
fighting it out.

Jim Muir posted Iris best time
of the season, 20:52, in the 1500-
meter free-style final, the only
race field yesterday, but was
able to grab only a fourth place,
netting the Indians 3 points.
Winner was Jim Small of Cal
in 18:15 —jnst three seconds off
the PCC record.
Defending champion Stanford mermen face SC, UCLA and Cal this
afternoon and Saturday in the annual PCC Southern Division swim
ming championships at Berkeley where they are again favored to
win the title.
