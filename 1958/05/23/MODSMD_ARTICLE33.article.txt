# Frosh Baseballers Finish
## 
### 
Pave Carter and Terry Linde
man are scheduled to pitch the
last freshman games of the sea
son. Carter will start against
Harry Ellis High of Richmond
this afternoon at 3:15, and Linde
man will go against Sacred Heart
of San Francisco tomorrow at 10.
The Papooses go after wins
number 11 and 12 and will he out
on the Sunken Diamond to do it.
Carter has a 1-0 record going into
today's game while Lindeman
stands at 5-1.

The freshmen expert a real
battle on their hands in both
games, but especially from Sacred
Heart, which has three City All-
Stars and is in the finals against
St. Ignatius for the San Francisco
title.
If the Papoose sluggers keep
blasting the ball around as they
have in their last four wins, how
ever, they should easily grab
their final two victories.
