# French, Tunisian Troops Clash; Crisis for Pflimin
## De Gaullists Demonstrate In Algeria 
### 
PARIS (/P) — An outburst of
fighting between French and Tu
nisian troops in Tunisia yester day
saddled Premier Pierre Pflimlin
with a new crisis in turbulent
North Africa.
President Habib Bourguiba of
Tunisia broadcast news of the
fighting as Pflimlin struggled to
regain control of Algeria from
rightists who demand a govern
ment headed by General Charles
de Gaulle.
Pflimlin's cabinet approved a
series of proposed constitutional
amendments intended to
strengthen the executive branch
and thus take some of the wind
out of de Gaulle's sails.
Amendments
The ministers gave Pflimlin au
thority to make adoption of the
amendments an issue of confi
dence—meaning .the government
will stand or falljon the outcome
in parliament. They decided to
seek a in the National
Assembly Tuesday.
Fall of Pflimlin's government
now would almost certainly open
the way for President Rene Coty
to call de Gaulle to the nation's
leadership. The premier seemed
confident this wouldn't happen.
Demonstrations
De Ga u 11 is t demonstrations
rolled on in Algeria. About 100,-
000 persons in Oran cheered Gaul
list leader Jacques Soustelle and
the civilian-military junta when
they arrived in that western city.
Bourguiba said fighting broke
out this morning between the
French and Tunisian forces at
Gafsa. He said trouble was build
ing up again at Remada, south of
Gafsa and near the Libyan bor
der. He demanded again that
French troops clear out of Tuni
sia, former French protectorate.
