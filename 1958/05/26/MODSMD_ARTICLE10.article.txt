## 1000 Sign Anti-H Bomb Test Petition

SAN FRANCISCO (/P)â€”Signa
tures on petitions demanding that
President Eisenhower stop U.S.
nuclear weapon tests reached
more than 1000 at San Francisco
State College yesterday as stu
dents and faculty members clam
ored to "halt this march toward
annihilation at once."
The petitions, which began cir
culating at the college last month,
will be sent to Eisenhower later
this week.
During the period, students and
professors have taken part in
campus debates on the subject of
stopping tests, and on Friday 62
professors placed a full-page ad
vertisement in the campus news
paper calling for a halt.
Among signers of the ad were
novelist Walter Van Tilburg
Clark, author of "The Ox Bow In
cident"; Herbert Blau, director of
"Waiting for Godot," Ihe play to
bo presented at the B r ussels
World's Fair; and S. I. Hayakawa,
famous semanticist and editor of
"Etc."
Russia's suspension of tests and
announcement that she would
submit to inspection if a universal
ban were imposed, the professors
said, may be sincere, or, "if it is
a bluff, let's call it."
