# SCRATCH SHEET
## General Study Courses Evaluation to Go on Sale 
### 
The Scratch Sheet, students'
evaluations of the General Stud
ies courses, goes on sale today.
The 19-page publication will be
sold for 15 cents in front of the
Library, said John Lawrence, edi
tor.
Lawrence was assisted by Herb
Enderton, associate editor. The
two merged efforts to write an
editorial which asserts that Stan
ford students have become disil
lusioned by the events of the past
year. However, they feel that
there may be a solution.
Jim Kurth is business manager
of the spring edition and the edi
torial board includes Jerry Clin
ton, Rod Day, Frank Hart man.
Martin Horwitz and Tom Mahan.
The Scratch Sheet covers 32
General Studies courses and the
Humanities Ho nors Program.
The Scratch Sheet staff compiled
the final evaluation from those
turned in by selected students in
the various courses.

For each subject the Scratch
Sheet describes (he requirements
and attempts to evaluate the ef
fectiveness of teaching. Most
courses are summed up with a
general statement. For instance,
Political Science 1 is described
as "well organized, intelligently
taught, and should be seriously
considered by every student. . .
Other courses do not receive
such favorable ratings. For Psy
chology 1 the Scratch Sheet has
this to say: "This course will
probably destroy any interest the
student has in the subject. The
dull reading list will do little to
demonstrate the potentialities of
the subject. This course should
be quarantined until renovated."
On the cover of today's publi
cation, the editors have printed a
quotation from Dante's "Para
diso": "For if at first your words
are bitter, when digested, they
will have a vital nourishment."
