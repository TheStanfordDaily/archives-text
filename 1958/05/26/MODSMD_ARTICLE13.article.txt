# Troubles Mount for French Premier
## Insurgents Claim New Wins Against Pflimlin 
### 
PARIS (/P)—' Troubles multiplied by the hour yesterday for the
embattled government of Premier Pierre Pflimlin.
Rightist insurgents in Algeria and Corsica claimed new successes.
They said their movement to return General Charles de Gaulle to
power was spreading.
Renewed fighting between French and Tunisian forces in southern

Tunisia raised grave problems.
The Communist ■ led General
federation of Labor — France's
biggest union — called for its
members working in government
arsenals to "meet immediately to
plan counteraction against the
fascist aggression."
Emergency Session
The pressure mounted on the
eve of an emergency session Mon
day of the National Assembly,
called to deal with the spreading
insurrection.
The session was called late Sat
urday by Premier Pierre Pflimlin
after Algeria - type public safety
committees, apparently directed
by Algiers insurgents, took con
trol in Corsica.
In an emergency session, Pflim
lin's cabinet Saturday branded the
Corsica move seditious insurrec
tion. In an extraordinary radio
broadcast to his country after
midnight, Pflimlin said the move
threatened civil war in France.
After another emergency ses
sion yesterday, the cabinet de
clared government officials and
military personnel who took part
in the Corsica uprising will be
fined and jailed.
Troubles for Pflimlin
As Pflimlin and his cabinet
struggled to assert its authority
there were these developments
thai pounded at the Paris govern
ment:
1. French labor unions issued
calls for their members to meet
Monday and deal with what they
called plots threatening the re
public. France's largest union,
the Communist-led General Con
federation of Labor, singled out
workers in government arsenals
calling for them to plan to defend
the republic "against fascist ag
gression."
A clash of de Gaulle supporters
with workers of the three big un
ions, including non - Communist
workers, which strongly oppose
de Gaulle, pointed up the danger
of bloodshed.
Supports Insurgents
2. The French naval command
er in the Mediterranean voiced
support for the Algerian insur
gents. The Paris government, in
turn, ordered four of its ships
just back from Atlantic Alliance
Mediterranean exercises to sail
from Malta for France.
3. Tunisian President Hab ib
Bourguiba's government charged
that French planes flew in waves
from Algerian fields to bomb Tu
nisian outposts. He charged the
air attacks came after new clash
es between Tunisian and French
troops in southern Tunisia .A
state of emergency was declared
in that North African nation.
4. Jubilant insurgent leaders in
Algiers hailed the Corsica action
as liberation of the island. They
said their de Gaullist movement
is spreading into French West
and Equatorial Africa, and hinted
that France itself is ripe for their
public safety committee type of
government takeover.
Regular Session
The emergency parliament ses
sion today (2 a.m. PDT) was
called in advance of a regularly
scheduled session tomorrow to
deal with Pflimlin's program to
give the government more power.
France's tough interior minis
ter, Socialist Jules Moch, was in
constant contact with Pflimlin.
Moch's 50,000 security troops —
the men with the shiny, dark hel
mets and the weapons of an army
represent about the last "sure"
aimed manpower readily avail
able to the cabinet. Moch and
Pflimlin met earlier in the day
with Socialist leader Guy Mollct
and Justice Minister Robert Lc
court.

Corsica move seditious insurrec

broadcast to his country after
midnight, Pflimlin said the move
threatened civil war in France.
After another emergency ses

Troubles for Pflimlin
As Pflimlin and his cabinet
struggled to assert its authority
there were these developments
thai pounded at the Paris govern
ment:
1. French labor unions issued
calls for their members to meet
Monday and deal with what they
called plots threatening the re
public. France's largest union,
the Communist-led General Con
federation of Labor, singled out
workers in government arsenals
calling for them to plan to defend
the republic "against fascist ag
gression."
A clash of de Gaulle supporters
with workers of the three big un
ions, including non - Communist
workers, which strongly oppose
de Gaulle, pointed up the danger
of bloodshed.
Supports Insurgents
2. The French naval command
er in the Mediterranean voiced
support for the Algerian insur
gents. The Paris government, in
turn, ordered four of its ships
just back from Atlantic Alliance
Mediterranean exercises to sail
from Malta for France.
3. Tunisian President Hab ib
Bourguiba's government charged
that French planes flew in waves
from Algerian fields to bomb Tu
nisian outposts. He charged the
air attacks came after new clash
es between Tunisian and French
troops in southern Tunisia .A
state of emergency was declared
in that North African nation.
4. Jubilant insurgent leaders in
Algiers hailed the Corsica action
as liberation of the island. They
said their de Gaullist movement
is spreading into French West
and Equatorial Africa, and hinted
that France itself is ripe for their
public safety committee type of
government takeover.
Regular Session
The emergency parliament ses
sion today (2 a.m. PDT) was
called in advance of a regularly

constant contact with Pflimlin.
Moch's 50,000 security troops —
the men with the shiny, dark hel
mets and the weapons of an army
represent about the last "sure"
aimed manpower readily avail
able to the cabinet. Moch and
Pflimlin met earlier in the day
with Socialist leader Guy Mollct
and Justice Minister Robert Lc
court.
