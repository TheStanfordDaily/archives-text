Points oj Agreement
Editor, The Daily:
In their lettpr about H-bomb tests, Mr. Harrison
and Mr. Wood present two concerns, which we
share. They are: to avoid war and to avoid Soviet
domination of the world. They seem to conclude
that ending H-bomb tests would make both Soviet
domination and a war more likely. Wc disagree
with both these conclusions.
We have reached a point in the arms race
where war is no longer to the advantage of either
side. Military experts (see the Holifield hearings,
for example) seem to agree that both Russia and
the United States have enough nuclear power to
destroy all major centers of civilization. We have
fulfilled the purpose of these who argue for an
arms race: that is, to make the United States
strong enough that it would not be to an enemy's
advantage to attack.
So the threat of war seems to be no longer that
a nation will start a war as a rational means to
further her political ambitions. In this era of
nuclear power, war more probably will come
irrationally through an accident, or a mistaken
fear of attack, or a limited war suddenly ex
panded into total war. The continued develop
ment of destructive power to split-second pre
cision and the spreading of nuclear weapons to
more and more countries increase the possibili
ties of a war from these irrational causes.
But we must not forget our second concern—•
Soviet domination. Soviet expansion comes by
economic and political means as well as by war.
Our foreign policy, weighted so heavily with mili
tary considerations, leaves us with an inadequate
approach to world problems. Furthermore, our
continued amassing of greater weapons makes
the "peaceful" peace actions which we do carry
out seem unconvincing. It also leaves us without
the money and manpower for needed actions in
other areas.
We should also consider the fact that it is im
possible to rely on this military commitment, for
ever; an arms race has to stop somewhere. Fur
thermore, it seems that we have now reached a
place where a continued increase in our energy
directed toward military considerations decreases
our chances of avoiding war and Soviet expan
sion. The problem is to find some place where
both sides can stop the arms build-up under re
liable international inspection. We believe that
stopping H-bomb testing provides this safe, test
able and practical place. The longer we wait, the
harder it will be to make an agreement with re
liable checks.
This agreement between Russia and the United
States would set up a machinery of international
control on a comparatively simple level. It would
allow them the much-needed chance to practice
cooperation in a situation where the sincerity of
each could be vigorously tested. The United States
and Russia have already been cooperating for
several years on little-known economic agree
ments. Russia has agreed to the testing of in
spection stations on her soil, and government in
vestigations (under Dr. Killian's direction) report
that an effective testing system is possible.
We are glad that the Government seems to be
moving in the direction of making such an agree
ment.

Editor, The Daily:
The 10 foreign students on the ASSU foreign

scholar program at Stanford don't know how to
thank YOU — students, faculty, Administration
and organizations—for your hospitality, friend
ship and help that have made our stay at Stanford
such an unforgettable one.
We all have had a wonderful time, with lots of
fun but also with a tremendous exchange of
thoughts and understanding.
A word of special thanks is certainly deserved
by the Foreign Scholar Commission, under the
co-chairmanship of Mardy Keyes and Brian
O'Hara. which did a wonderful job as our tem
porary parents wilh their well-planned program.
Also we should like very much to thank the
different fraternities, dormitories and eating
clubs where we lived for one quarter and which
gave us the opportunity to meet as many students
as possible and to get a good idea of the different
ways the students live. They all did a great deal
to make us feel at home and help us enjoy our
stay here at Stanford.
We hope that more people will have the oppor
tunity to come over to the U.S.A. (or to go from
the U.S.A. to other countries) in order to get and
to promote a better understanding between the
different countries and the U.S.A.
Our experiences have made us understand bet
ter the importance of an intensive exchange be
tween the different parts of the world in order
to keep, or to get, a world peace, because there
are not many basic differences between the peo
ple all over the world.
If you visit one of our countries, be sure and
drop in. Our addresses are at the ASSU office.
Many thanks again. Your foreign friends,

The Stanford Affiliation Committee at the Free
University in Berlin is pleased to be able to tell
the editor of The Stanford Daily that the special
Berlin edition of The Daily has been most warmly
welcomed by our student body among which your
2000 copies were distributed recently. We are
most certain that the special edition has broad
ened and deepened the contacts between our two
universities by showing students at the Free Uni
versity some of the daily happenings at Stanford,
but especially because students here realize that
there is a genuine interest in our city among stu
dents of our partner university.
Since vacation time is close, the members of
the Stanford Affiliation Committee would like to
be of help to Stanford students traveling in Eu
rope this summer. Those students planning on
visiting Berlin during their trip to Europe are
requested to notify the Stanford committee ap
proximately three weeks in advance of their ar
rival in Berlin, under the following address: Stan

ties of a war from these irrational causes.
But we must not forget our second concern—•
Soviet domination. Soviet expansion comes by
economic and political means as well as by war.
Our foreign policy, weighted so heavily with mili
tary considerations, leaves us with an inadequate
approach to world problems. Furthermore, our
continued amassing of greater weapons makes
the "peaceful" peace actions which we do carry
out seem unconvincing. It also leaves us without
the money and manpower for needed actions in
other areas.
We should also consider the fact that it is im
possible to rely on this military commitment, for
ever; an arms race has to stop somewhere. Fur
thermore, it seems that we have now reached a
place where a continued increase in our energy
directed toward military considerations decreases
our chances of avoiding war and Soviet expan
sion. The problem is to find some place where
both sides can stop the arms build-up under re
liable international inspection. We believe that
stopping H-bomb testing provides this safe, test
able and practical place. The longer we wait, the
harder it will be to make an agreement with re
liable checks.
This agreement between Russia and the United
States would set up a machinery of international
control on a comparatively simple level. It would
allow them the much-needed chance to practice
cooperation in a situation where the sincerity of
each could be vigorously tested. The United States
and Russia have already been cooperating for
several years on little-known economic agree
ments. Russia has agreed to the testing of in
spection stations on her soil, and government in
vestigations (under Dr. Killian's direction) report
that an effective testing system is possible.
We are glad that the Government seems to be
moving in the direction of making such an agree

The 10 foreign students on the ASSU foreign

scholar program at Stanford don't know how to
thank YOU — students, faculty, Administration
and organizations—for your hospitality, friend
ship and help that have made our stay at Stanford
such an unforgettable one.
We all have had a wonderful time, with lots of
fun but also with a tremendous exchange of
thoughts and understanding.
A word of special thanks is certainly deserved
by the Foreign Scholar Commission, under the
co-chairmanship of Mardy Keyes and Brian
O'Hara. which did a wonderful job as our tem
porary parents wilh their well-planned program.
Also we should like very much to thank the
different fraternities, dormitories and eating
clubs where we lived for one quarter and which
gave us the opportunity to meet as many students
as possible and to get a good idea of the different
ways the students live. They all did a great deal
to make us feel at home and help us enjoy our
stay here at Stanford.
We hope that more people will have the oppor
tunity to come over to the U.S.A. (or to go from
the U.S.A. to other countries) in order to get and
to promote a better understanding between the
different countries and the U.S.A.
Our experiences have made us understand bet
ter the importance of an intensive exchange be
tween the different parts of the world in order
to keep, or to get, a world peace, because there
are not many basic differences between the peo
ple all over the world.
If you visit one of our countries, be sure and

In their lettpr about H-bomb tests, Mr. Harrison
and Mr. Wood present two concerns, which we
share. They are: to avoid war and to avoid Soviet
domination of the world. They seem to conclude
that ending H-bomb tests would make both Soviet
domination and a war more likely. Wc disagree
with both these conclusions.
We have reached a point in the arms race
where war is no longer to the advantage of either
side. Military experts (see the Holifield hearings,
for example) seem to agree that both Russia and
the United States have enough nuclear power to
destroy all major centers of civilization. We have
fulfilled the purpose of these who argue for an
arms race: that is, to make the United States
strong enough that it would not be to an enemy's
advantage to attack.
So the threat of war seems to be no longer that
a nation will start a war as a rational means to
further her political ambitions. In this era of
nuclear power, war more probably will come
irrationally through an accident, or a mistaken
fear of attack, or a limited war suddenly ex
panded into total war. The continued develop
ment of destructive power to split-second pre
cision and the spreading of nuclear weapons to
more and more countries increase the possibili
ties of a war from these irrational causes.
But we must not forget our second concern—•
Soviet domination. Soviet expansion comes by

The 10 foreign students on the ASSU foreign

scholar program at Stanford don't know how to
thank YOU — students, faculty, Administration
and organizations—for your hospitality, friend
ship and help that have made our stay at Stanford
such an unforgettable one.
We all have had a wonderful time, with lots of
fun but also with a tremendous exchange of
thoughts and understanding.
A word of special thanks is certainly deserved
by the Foreign Scholar Commission, under the
co-chairmanship of Mardy Keyes and Brian
O'Hara. which did a wonderful job as our tem
porary parents wilh their well-planned program.
Also we should like very much to thank the
different fraternities, dormitories and eating
clubs where we lived for one quarter and which
gave us the opportunity to meet as many students
as possible and to get a good idea of the different
ways the students live. They all did a great deal
to make us feel at home and help us enjoy our
stay here at Stanford.
We hope that more people will have the oppor
tunity to come over to the U.S.A. (or to go from
the U.S.A. to other countries) in order to get and
to promote a better understanding between the
different countries and the U.S.A.
Our experiences have made us understand bet
ter the importance of an intensive exchange be
tween the different parts of the world in order
to keep, or to get, a world peace, because there
are not many basic differences between the peo
ple all over the world.
If you visit one of our countries, be sure and
drop in. Our addresses are at the ASSU office.

Editor, The Daily:
In their lettpr about H-bomb tests, Mr. Harrison
and Mr. Wood present two concerns, which we
share. They are: to avoid war and to avoid Soviet
domination of the world. They seem to conclude
that ending H-bomb tests would make both Soviet
domination and a war more likely. Wc disagree
with both these conclusions.
We have reached a point in the arms race
where war is no longer to the advantage of either
side. Military experts (see the Holifield hearings,
for example) seem to agree that both Russia and
the United States have enough nuclear power to
destroy all major centers of civilization. We have
fulfilled the purpose of these who argue for an
arms race: that is, to make the United States
strong enough that it would not be to an enemy's
advantage to attack.
So the threat of war seems to be no longer that
a nation will start a war as a rational means to
further her political ambitions. In this era of
nuclear power, war more probably will come
irrationally through an accident, or a mistaken
fear of attack, or a limited war suddenly ex
panded into total war. The continued develop
ment of destructive power to split-second pre
cision and the spreading of nuclear weapons to
more and more countries increase the possibili
ties of a war from these irrational causes.
But we must not forget our second concern—•
Soviet domination. Soviet expansion comes by
economic and political means as well as by war.
Our foreign policy, weighted so heavily with mili
tary considerations, leaves us with an inadequate
approach to world problems. Furthermore, our
continued amassing of greater weapons makes
the "peaceful" peace actions which we do carry
out seem unconvincing. It also leaves us without
the money and manpower for needed actions in
other areas.
We should also consider the fact that it is im
possible to rely on this military commitment, for
ever; an arms race has to stop somewhere. Fur
thermore, it seems that we have now reached a
place where a continued increase in our energy
directed toward military considerations decreases
our chances of avoiding war and Soviet expan
sion. The problem is to find some place where
both sides can stop the arms build-up under re
liable international inspection. We believe that
stopping H-bomb testing provides this safe, test
able and practical place. The longer we wait, the
harder it will be to make an agreement with re
liable checks.
This agreement between Russia and the United
States would set up a machinery of international
control on a comparatively simple level. It would
allow them the much-needed chance to practice

clubs where we lived for one quarter and which
gave us the opportunity to meet as many students
as possible and to get a good idea of the different
ways the students live. They all did a great deal
to make us feel at home and help us enjoy our
stay here at Stanford.
We hope that more people will have the oppor
tunity to come over to the U.S.A. (or to go from
the U.S.A. to other countries) in order to get and
to promote a better understanding between the
different countries and the U.S.A.
Our experiences have made us understand bet
ter the importance of an intensive exchange be
tween the different parts of the world in order
to keep, or to get, a world peace, because there
are not many basic differences between the peo
ple all over the world.
If you visit one of our countries, be sure and
drop in. Our addresses are at the ASSU office.
Many thanks again. Your foreign friends,

Warmly Welcomed
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Affiliation Committee at the Free
University in Berlin is pleased to be able to tell
the editor of The Stanford Daily that the special
Berlin edition of The Daily has been most warmly
welcomed by our student body among which your
2000 copies were distributed recently. We are
most certain that the special edition has broad
ened and deepened the contacts between our two
universities by showing students at the Free Uni
versity some of the daily happenings at Stanford,
but especially because students here realize that
there is a genuine interest in our city among stu
dents of our partner university.
Since vacation time is close, the members of
the Stanford Affiliation Committee would like to
be of help to Stanford students traveling in Eu
rope this summer. Those students planning on
visiting Berlin during their trip to Europe are
requested to notify the Stanford committee ap
proximately three weeks in advance of their ar
rival in Berlin, under the following address: Stan

Points oj Agreement
Editor, The Daily:
In their lettpr about H-bomb tests, Mr. Harrison
and Mr. Wood present two concerns, which we
share. They are: to avoid war and to avoid Soviet
domination of the world. They seem to conclude
that ending H-bomb tests would make both Soviet
domination and a war more likely. Wc disagree
with both these conclusions.
We have reached a point in the arms race
where war is no longer to the advantage of either
side. Military experts (see the Holifield hearings,
for example) seem to agree that both Russia and
the United States have enough nuclear power to
destroy all major centers of civilization. We have
fulfilled the purpose of these who argue for an
arms race: that is, to make the United States
strong enough that it would not be to an enemy's
advantage to attack.
So the threat of war seems to be no longer that
a nation will start a war as a rational means to
further her political ambitions. In this era of
nuclear power, war more probably will come
irrationally through an accident, or a mistaken
fear of attack, or a limited war suddenly ex
panded into total war. The continued develop
ment of destructive power to split-second pre
cision and the spreading of nuclear weapons to
more and more countries increase the possibili
ties of a war from these irrational causes.
But we must not forget our second concern—•
Soviet domination. Soviet expansion comes by
economic and political means as well as by war.
Our foreign policy, weighted so heavily with mili
tary considerations, leaves us with an inadequate
approach to world problems. Furthermore, our
continued amassing of greater weapons makes
the "peaceful" peace actions which we do carry
out seem unconvincing. It also leaves us without
the money and manpower for needed actions in
other areas.
We should also consider the fact that it is im
possible to rely on this military commitment, for
ever; an arms race has to stop somewhere. Fur
thermore, it seems that we have now reached a
place where a continued increase in our energy
directed toward military considerations decreases
our chances of avoiding war and Soviet expan
sion. The problem is to find some place where
both sides can stop the arms build-up under re
liable international inspection. We believe that
stopping H-bomb testing provides this safe, test
able and practical place. The longer we wait, the
harder it will be to make an agreement with re
liable checks.
This agreement between Russia and the United
States would set up a machinery of international
control on a comparatively simple level. It would
allow them the much-needed chance to practice
cooperation in a situation where the sincerity of
each could be vigorously tested. The United States
and Russia have already been cooperating for
several years on little-known economic agree
ments. Russia has agreed to the testing of in
spection stations on her soil, and government in
vestigations (under Dr. Killian's direction) report
that an effective testing system is possible.
We are glad that the Government seems to be
moving in the direction of making such an agree
ment.

Scholars Say 'Thanks'
Editor, The Daily:
The 10 foreign students on the ASSU foreign

scholar program at Stanford don't know how to
thank YOU — students, faculty, Administration
and organizations—for your hospitality, friend
ship and help that have made our stay at Stanford
such an unforgettable one.
We all have had a wonderful time, with lots of
fun but also with a tremendous exchange of
thoughts and understanding.
A word of special thanks is certainly deserved
by the Foreign Scholar Commission, under the
co-chairmanship of Mardy Keyes and Brian
O'Hara. which did a wonderful job as our tem
porary parents wilh their well-planned program.
Also we should like very much to thank the
different fraternities, dormitories and eating
clubs where we lived for one quarter and which
gave us the opportunity to meet as many students
as possible and to get a good idea of the different
ways the students live. They all did a great deal
to make us feel at home and help us enjoy our
stay here at Stanford.
We hope that more people will have the oppor
tunity to come over to the U.S.A. (or to go from
the U.S.A. to other countries) in order to get and
to promote a better understanding between the
different countries and the U.S.A.
Our experiences have made us understand bet
