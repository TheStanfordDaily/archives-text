# ON SALE TODAY
## Story on Oppenheimer Featured in Sequoia 
### 
The spring issue of Sequoia
will be sold today, tomorrow and
Wednesday at tables on Quad
and around the campus. Price is
40 cents per copy.
Included is a provocative arti
cle on Princeton's "Bicker," tho
annual process (analogous to
Stanford fraternity rushing) by
which the eating clubs select their
members. The article was origi
nally written for the Harvard
Crimson by John McNees, a soph
omore at Harvard.
McNees remarks, "Perhaps the
real victims of Bicker are the
hundreds of students who happily
make the most respectable and
desirable clubs on the street. It
is they who have consented to
build their prestige ... on the
hypocrisy, inhumanity, servility
and sheer unreason upon which
Princeton's club system and Bick
er procedure are obviously
based."
A second article, "An Open
Mind," by David Egger, a Stan
ford senior majoring in physics,
critically reviews the Oppenheim
er security hearings. Egger
clearly describes the famous
physiicst's growth to political
awareness, discussing both the
unfortunate effects of his former

immaturity and the dangers of
(he United Slates' failure to take
advantage of iiis full maturity.
Stories in Sequoia include Loe
Tuax's "A Man Alone," a sensi
tive love story which provides a
perceptive picture of the complex
racial conflicts suffered by a Ne
gro soldier in the American occu
pation of Germany, and"The
tSoryteller," by Charles Court
ney, a drama of aspiration and
frustration as it worked out in
the life of an unusual protago
nist.
Poems by Tom Ferrell, Francis
Fike and Eleanor Ogden, a for
mer Sequoia editor, complete the
contributed material for the
spring issue.
Using the recent Palo Alto Di-
Sibio case as an illustration, the
editor discusses the need for a
more efficient program of train
ing and hiring teachers who
know what to teach as well as
how to teach.
