# Trojans Sweep Individual, Team Honors in PCC Golf
## 
### Jerry Wisot 
Slightly favored Southern California displayed amazing power as it virtually walked away from the
rest ol the competition to take both team and individual honors in the PCC golf championships on the
Stanford course this weekend.
Led by junior A 1 Geiberger's two-over-par effort for 72 holes, the Trojans took the load in the first
round and continued to widen the gap, finishing 2tt strokes better than runner-up Stanford. U( LA

was third, 51 strokes off the pace.
Geiberger was medalist for Fri
day's first round when he came
into the lttth hole even par and
put his second shot, a 200-yard
three iron, in the hole for prob
ably the only eagle two ever
scored on that hole. He came
back that afternoon with a one
under par 70 but was now in sec
ond place despite being three un
der.
Karly Leader
UCLA's Dick Foole, with a 71
for the morning round, had
passed Geiberger with an amaz
ing five-under-par 6G, two strokes
off the competitive course record
held by Harvie Ward. Foote's hot
round came as the result of bir
dies on the first, second, fourth,
seventh, tenth, 12th, 15th and
16th holes and the long four-par
fifth hole.
On the second day of play, both
Foote and Geiberger finished the
morning round with 74's. In the
afternoon round Foote dropped
lo a 75 while Geiberger came
through with a fine 73 to tie il up
and send the two into a sudden
death playoff.
Deadlock First
They tied the first hole of the
playoff on birdie fours but on
Ihe four-par second, Foote hooked
his drive into the rough and took
an extra stroke to get clear of it.
Geiberger was on in two and two
putted to become the first PCC
individual champion.
After the first day of play
Stanford was only eight strokes
behind the Trojans and had a
good chance of catching them.
But the tiring 36 holes each day
took its toll and the Trojans be
gan to pull away, leading by 16
strokes after three rounds and
finishing with 1107 to the Cards'
1195.
Bernie Magnussen was low man
for the Indians, capturing fifth
place with rounds of 73, 72, 74
and 75. The other three men to
count in Stanford's total were
Bill Seanor with 298. Alt' Burtle
son with 300 and Mike Shanahan
with 303. Shanahan had the best
second-day round with a two-un
der-par 09.
