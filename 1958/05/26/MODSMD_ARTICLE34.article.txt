# Track Team Finishes 4th
## 
### 
Dean Smith pulled in the most
points, John Kelly was the biggest
surprise and Norm Lloyd made
the biggest comeback for Stan
ford as it finished fourth in the
PCC track and field champion
ships Friday and Saturday in
Berkeley.
Three meet records were set as
Southern California easily gained
its 17th team title in 18 meets.
Smith, running with his usual
slow start and closing surge, grab
bed second in the 100 and third in
the 220 as Cal's Willie White won
both races in 9.6 and 21.1, respec
tively.
Moves Up
After qualifying third in the
broad jump prelims with a leap
of 23-6%., Kelly came through in
the final round with a 21 • foot
jump that got him second place
behind Dick Knaub of UCLA.
Lloyd returned to get second
place in a rough half-mile, after
he had run last in the mile. He
had stuck with Cal's Don Bowden
through two laps in the mile, but
the two-minute pace proved too
much.
Lloyd fell back steadily on the
third lap; then, knowing he had
to run the 880, he coasted through
his final quarter as the rest of the
field passed him.
But the half-mile was a differ
ent story. The Tribe's Ernie Cun
liffe took the early lead and was
through the first quarter in 54.5,
with Lloyd right behind.
Maynard Orme of Cal moved
ahead during the third 220, and
then Washington's Bill Moser
went after Orme as Lloyd and
Cunliffe hung light.
All Even
Orme fell back going into the
fourth turn. As the field moved
to within 1.30 yards of the tape,
Cunliffe, Lloyd, Moser and Jerry
Siebert of Cal were all even.
Siebert and Lloyd pulled ahead
first, but Siebert took command

with 80 yards to go, and won it in
1:51.0, five-tenths ahead of Lloyd. j
Cunliffe finished fourth, a yard j
behind Bob Holland of UCLA.
Stanford's fourth second • place
was turned in by Maury Graves
in the two-mile. He stuck with
the Trojans' Max Truex for near
ly a mile, then fell far behind, and
finally had to go all out to get the
runner-up spot from Ken Riding
of UCLA. Graves ran only 9:39.3.
Other Points
The rest of the Indians' 26 I >>
points were won by Kent Hansen
(fourth In the broad jump at 23-
7V«). the relay team of Cunliffe,
Lloyd, Smith and Dick Lassen
(fourth in 3:17.0), Jerry Winters
(fifth in the shot-put at 53-6 Ms)
and Mike Franchetti (tie for fifth
in the pole vault at 13-6).
The Craziest races of the meet
were all the heats and finals in
the hurdles. First, Charley Du
mas was eliminated in his highs
| heat when he clobbered the ninth

hurdle. Then Stanford's Chuck
j Cobb tried to run just fast enough
to qualify in the lows, and got
nipped for the fourth and last
spot by White, who was loafing
along in last.
In the highs final, Rafer John
son scratched, Ken Thompson and
Cobb fell, and Joe Griffin ran
around the last hurdle, leaving
only four men for five places.
Cobb actually got up and stag

i gored across Hip lino fifth, but ho
ran out of his lane.
The lows were a judging moss
as Bob Lawson of USC was
I picked for first, third and fourth
by different judges. Dave Hoi
lingsworth of Troy finally got the
win, but it's subject to movies.
The final three spots in the 100
also will bo decided by pictures.
Moot records set wore by Row
den in the mile (4:03.7), Johnson
in the javelin (243-10 1 > and Rink
Babka in the discus (18(5-8).

ton's Terry Tobacco in the 440,
USC in the relay, Lawson in the
highs, Dave Davis of USC in the
shot, UCLA's George Roubanis in
Hie polo vault and Dumas in the
high jump.
