# Dekes' Car Takes Gas— But Station Variety
## 
### Doug Willis 
The South rose again, two cam
pus jalopies were razed and sev
eral Crothers men arose early
during the past weekend as
spring quarter, in all of its vio
lent glory, rode across the Stan
ford campus.
It all began Friday morning at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity house
when, in preparation for the Dix
ie Ball on Saturday night, the
KA's seceded from the union.
At noon Friday, General Grant
was hanged in effigy at the KA
house and that afternoon an im
promptu Union army marched on
the KA's from upper Row. With
the aid of the Delta Kappa Epsi
lons' 1936 Plymouth and the Kap
pa Sigmas' 1928 Chandler as bat
tering rams, the Union assaulted
the barricades of the KA fortress.
About 11:30 p.m. Friday, the
first of the mobile units of the af
ternoon's Union army met a vio
lent end. Unknown persons
poured gasoline into the Deke
Plymouth and moments later
sent it up in flames.
According to the Dekes, the car,
owned by Rich Lange and War
ner Henry, was completely de
stroyed. Twenty minutes later
the Kappa Sig Chandler, owned
by Terman Eichner, was also in
flames and the Stanford Fire De
partment was on the move again.
The Chandler was also filled
with gasoline and the interior
was gutted by flames, but no se
rious damage was done anrl the
car was in action again Saturday.
The fraternities suspected no con

nection between the burnings and
the earlier "Civil War."
At about 3:15 a.m. Saturday
the campus center of action
moved to Crothers Hall where
three rooms were bombed with
Army ROTC M-80 practice charg
es. Windows and blinds were
blown out by the charges, the
woodwork was burned, and the
linoleum on the floor was loos
ened by the blasts.
The practice charges used were
powder charges used to simulate
shell and bomb blasts in military
training maneuvers.
