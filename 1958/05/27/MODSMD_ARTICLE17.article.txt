Dear Brother Antoninus
Editor, The Daily:
I thank you dear Brother Antoninus,
For correcting my views so erroneous.
But your letter, you see,
Meant nothing to me;
'Twas muddled, confused, but euphonious.

Editor, The Daily:
At nearly every university commencement ex
ercise, some illustrious educator or noted citizen
will speak of the commendability and the urgency
of our learning to think independently of the
prejudices of our society; accolades are redun
dantly presented to those who dare to probe be
yond the ordinary, to those who remain unfet
tered by the comforts of conformity. We hear in
hundreds of our classrooms praises raised to the
individual who is both able and willing to regard
human issues with honesty, free from hypocrisy
and free from the petty fears which restrict the
mediocre man from new or different thoughts.
But this individual whose merits we theoreti
cally exalt is either an abstract, non existent per
son of today or a specific person of the past
whose contribution to us we may enjoy and ven
erate without anxiety that his uncommon charac
teristics will ever again upset our placidity. Given
a real live person, here and now, who has a pene
trating understanding of certain human issues,
who has outstanding abilities for teaching and
giving and doing, who is guided by an absolute
sense of fair play and fellow love—given such an
individual, the paltry fears of a few small-think
ing people wallow themselves into operation,
clamp down with a blind, commanding claw, and
effect to perpetuate that heinous force which con
stricts potentially all of mankind, which limits
our precious efforts toward spiritual expansion.
Stanford has had the privilege of one of these
rare human-knowing and human-loving individ
uals for the past year in the presence of Dr.
Mulford Q. Sibley; and the dingy fears, steeped
in mediocrity, have apparently groveled once
again into action to turn away this man, lest he
possess too much those golden qualities of Ihe
great and those divine qualities of the good.

In Support of Mediocrity
Editor, The Daily:
After a flay or two of puzzling over the decision
of the Administration in the Sibley case, I have
arrived at a possible answer. Assuming your in
terest, I then take this opportunity to tell you, in
brief, not only what this answer is, but by what

means I arrived at it.
It. all began with a thought that often crosses
my mind: I am a mediocre student. You applaud
my honesty? Well, it's really nothing. I just
came to believe all my friends.
At any rate, this thought led to wondering why
T am as I am, and. wishing to put the blame
somewhere other than on my parents, I forced
myself into accrediting our democracy with the
guilt.
I did it in this way (with some help from de
Tocqueville): Equality underlies democracy. De
mocracy breeds strong public opinion. Both
equality and strong public opinion breed con
formity. Conformity breeds monotony, and, it
seems to me, monotony breeds mediocrity. Ergo,
democracy breeds mediocrity.
You see. I am saved, or at least understood, and
it is in this way that I think our Administration
can be understood. Let me explain.
I have heard the argument that the Adminis
tration was justified in not rehiring Professor
Sibley because there is no one of equal ability
to take the opposite side of the political theory
picture. Hence, with just one side being pre
sented so well, there is no real intellectual free
dom for the average, gullible, mediocre student.
But the propounders of this argument go on
to say that the school should import some pro
fessor who could very ably present the other side,
instead of exporting the exceptional Professor
Sibley. It is with this that I wish to disagree
(thus supporting the Administration).
By ridding Stanford of such as Professor Sib
ley, the faculty will be kept as close to that line
of mediocrity as possible. Obviously, a mediocre
faculty will tend to produce mediocre students—
i.e., proper, democratic citizens. Could the Ad
ministration shoot for a higher goal? I think not.
Harry Cain
Stanford Basks in Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
About two years ago (if my memory serves me
welli the New York Times ran an article about
Stanford being—at that time—in line for a sub
stantial amount of federal money for work in
atomic research. The article also mentioned some
concern in Washington as to whether Stanford
might have on its faculty any well-known men
who might be embarrassing to the military aspect
of nuclear science.
Stanford, I understand, has received much fed
eral money for nuclear research. It is now, I
understand, planning and/or building what will
be the largest nuclear accelerator of its kind in
the world.
It is fortunate that Stanford can bask in aca
demic freedom, since it does not rely on state
funds for support.

means I arrived at it.
It. all began with a thought that often crosses
my mind: I am a mediocre student. You applaud
my honesty? Well, it's really nothing. I just
came to believe all my friends.
At any rate, this thought led to wondering why
T am as I am, and. wishing to put the blame
somewhere other than on my parents, I forced
myself into accrediting our democracy with the
guilt.
I did it in this way (with some help from de
Tocqueville): Equality underlies democracy. De
mocracy breeds strong public opinion. Both
equality and strong public opinion breed con
formity. Conformity breeds monotony, and, it
seems to me, monotony breeds mediocrity. Ergo,
democracy breeds mediocrity.
You see. I am saved, or at least understood, and
it is in this way that I think our Administration
can be understood. Let me explain.
I have heard the argument that the Adminis
tration was justified in not rehiring Professor
Sibley because there is no one of equal ability
to take the opposite side of the political theory
picture. Hence, with just one side being pre
sented so well, there is no real intellectual free
dom for the average, gullible, mediocre student.
But the propounders of this argument go on
to say that the school should import some pro
fessor who could very ably present the other side,
instead of exporting the exceptional Professor
Sibley. It is with this that I wish to disagree
(thus supporting the Administration).
By ridding Stanford of such as Professor Sib
ley, the faculty will be kept as close to that line
of mediocrity as possible. Obviously, a mediocre
faculty will tend to produce mediocre students—
i.e., proper, democratic citizens. Could the Ad
ministration shoot for a higher goal? I think not.

Stanford Basks in Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
About two years ago (if my memory serves me
welli the New York Times ran an article about
Stanford being—at that time—in line for a sub
stantial amount of federal money for work in
atomic research. The article also mentioned some
concern in Washington as to whether Stanford
might have on its faculty any well-known men
who might be embarrassing to the military aspect
of nuclear science.
Stanford, I understand, has received much fed
eral money for nuclear research. It is now, I
understand, planning and/or building what will
be the largest nuclear accelerator of its kind in
the world.
It is fortunate that Stanford can bask in aca
demic freedom, since it does not rely on state
funds for support.

At nearly every university commencement ex

dantly presented to those who dare to probe be
yond the ordinary, to those who remain unfet

hundreds of our classrooms praises raised to the
individual who is both able and willing to regard
human issues with honesty, free from hypocrisy
and free from the petty fears which restrict the
mediocre man from new or different thoughts.
But this individual whose merits we theoreti
cally exalt is either an abstract, non existent per
son of today or a specific person of the past
whose contribution to us we may enjoy and ven
erate without anxiety that his uncommon charac

a real live person, here and now, who has a pene

who has outstanding abilities for teaching and
giving and doing, who is guided by an absolute
sense of fair play and fellow love—given such an
individual, the paltry fears of a few small-think

clamp down with a blind, commanding claw, and
effect to perpetuate that heinous force which con

our precious efforts toward spiritual expansion.
Stanford has had the privilege of one of these
rare human-knowing and human-loving individ

I thank you dear Brother Antoninus,
For correcting my views so erroneous.

Meant nothing to me;
'Twas muddled, confused, but euphonious.

At nearly every university commencement ex
ercise, some illustrious educator or noted citizen
will speak of the commendability and the urgency
of our learning to think independently of the
prejudices of our society; accolades are redun
dantly presented to those who dare to probe be
yond the ordinary, to those who remain unfet
tered by the comforts of conformity. We hear in
hundreds of our classrooms praises raised to the
individual who is both able and willing to regard
human issues with honesty, free from hypocrisy
and free from the petty fears which restrict the
mediocre man from new or different thoughts.
But this individual whose merits we theoreti
cally exalt is either an abstract, non existent per
son of today or a specific person of the past
whose contribution to us we may enjoy and ven
erate without anxiety that his uncommon charac
teristics will ever again upset our placidity. Given
a real live person, here and now, who has a pene
trating understanding of certain human issues,
who has outstanding abilities for teaching and
giving and doing, who is guided by an absolute
sense of fair play and fellow love—given such an
individual, the paltry fears of a few small-think
ing people wallow themselves into operation,
clamp down with a blind, commanding claw, and
effect to perpetuate that heinous force which con
stricts potentially all of mankind, which limits
our precious efforts toward spiritual expansion.
Stanford has had the privilege of one of these
rare human-knowing and human-loving individ
uals for the past year in the presence of Dr.
Mulford Q. Sibley; and the dingy fears, steeped
in mediocrity, have apparently groveled once
again into action to turn away this man, lest he
possess too much those golden qualities of Ihe
great and those divine qualities of the good.

In Support of Mediocrity
Editor, The Daily:
After a flay or two of puzzling over the decision
of the Administration in the Sibley case, I have
arrived at a possible answer. Assuming your in
terest, I then take this opportunity to tell you, in
brief, not only what this answer is, but by what

means I arrived at it.
It. all began with a thought that often crosses
my mind: I am a mediocre student. You applaud
my honesty? Well, it's really nothing. I just
came to believe all my friends.
At any rate, this thought led to wondering why
T am as I am, and. wishing to put the blame
somewhere other than on my parents, I forced
myself into accrediting our democracy with the
guilt.
I did it in this way (with some help from de
Tocqueville): Equality underlies democracy. De
mocracy breeds strong public opinion. Both
equality and strong public opinion breed con
formity. Conformity breeds monotony, and, it
seems to me, monotony breeds mediocrity. Ergo,
democracy breeds mediocrity.
You see. I am saved, or at least understood, and
it is in this way that I think our Administration
can be understood. Let me explain.
I have heard the argument that the Adminis
tration was justified in not rehiring Professor
Sibley because there is no one of equal ability
to take the opposite side of the political theory
picture. Hence, with just one side being pre
sented so well, there is no real intellectual free
dom for the average, gullible, mediocre student.
But the propounders of this argument go on
to say that the school should import some pro
fessor who could very ably present the other side,
instead of exporting the exceptional Professor
Sibley. It is with this that I wish to disagree
(thus supporting the Administration).
By ridding Stanford of such as Professor Sib
ley, the faculty will be kept as close to that line
of mediocrity as possible. Obviously, a mediocre
faculty will tend to produce mediocre students—
i.e., proper, democratic citizens. Could the Ad
ministration shoot for a higher goal? I think not.

About two years ago (if my memory serves me
welli the New York Times ran an article about
Stanford being—at that time—in line for a sub
stantial amount of federal money for work in
atomic research. The article also mentioned some
concern in Washington as to whether Stanford
might have on its faculty any well-known men
who might be embarrassing to the military aspect
of nuclear science.
Stanford, I understand, has received much fed
eral money for nuclear research. It is now, I
understand, planning and/or building what will
be the largest nuclear accelerator of its kind in
the world.

demic freedom, since it does not rely on state
