# Pacifism Politics the Only 'Realism'
## 
### Dr. Mulford Q. Sibley Visiting Professor of Political Science 
It is a commonplace to say that
we live in a world standing on
the brink of ruin. A single super
bomb can destroy all life within
an area of 300 square miles.
Chemical and bacteriological war
fare services are making enor
mous progress in their ghastly
trades. In terms of their poten
tial destructive power, there has
been a greater development in
weapons between the end of
World War II and lOfiS than there
was between the Civil War and
World War 11.
Yet in the face of this possible
disaster, our political thinking re
mains primitive, contradictory
and ambivalent; and our divided
minds and wills make it impos
sible to act effectively within the
framework of an integrated sys
tem of ideals.
On the one hand, the policy of
terror seems to assume that we
can threaten, without ever using,
instruments of mass destruction;
on the other, we realize that
threats without readiness and
willingness to use those instru
ments are rather hollow.
Policy Contradicts
Our religious tradition empha
sizes meekness and non-violence;
our foreign policy contradicts at
almost every level that tradition
—ironically, moreover, at a time
of burgeoning church member
ship, and under the auspices of a
leading churchman as Secretary
of State.
Our ideology proclaims the god
lessness of the Soviet Union and
the superiority of our own alleged
godliness; while in the means we
are willing to use—wholesale and
indiscriminate destruction of hu
manity—we do not differ from
our so-called enemies.
Minds Divided
• Thus divided in our own minds
and in the public consciousness,
we stumble on in the arms race,
recognizing that competitions of
this kind usually lead to war and
yet, fatalistically, discerning no
alternative.
Increasingly, it may be argued,
the real alternatives before Amer
ica are, on the one hand, the poli
tics of the wholehearted accept
ance of war and the war State;
or, on the other, the revolution
ary politics of pacifism. We can
not in the long run carry water
on both shoulders, for if we at
tempt to do so we are effective

neither as makers of war nor as
peace-makers.
The politics of the war State,
completely accepted, would imply
at least one hundred billions for
shelters; a much stricter regi
mentation than we know today;
and, ultimately, "preventive" war
(for the side which first destroys
cities is presumably in a very ad
vantageous position, given the as
sumption that "victory" is pos
sible), Our efforts in war prepa
ration today are picayunish com
pared with what they ought to
be—if we really have faith in the
efficacy and legitimacy of war.
Religious Appeal
If we rebel against the impli
cations of a thorough-going prep
aration for war, on whatever
grounds (ethical, military, eco
nomic or political), then it would
seem that the only real alterna
tive is the politics of pacifism.
That politics would appeal to the
religious tradition which we all
share and would attempt to inte
grate our foreign and defense pol
icies, with respect to both means
and ends, around humanitarian
principles. Once we opted for the
politics of pacifism, we could re
vive moral enthusiasm and dis
card our present ambivalences
and contradictions.
Fundamental Change
What is the politics of paci
fism? In minimum terms it
would imply:
(1) A fundamental change in
attitude tbward our political "en
emies." Instead of stereotyping
them as scheming, evil and intel
ligent men who always act hypo
critically, we would see them as
partially perplexed, often stupid,
frequently fearful and sometimes
sincere — politicians very much
like ourselves, though operating
within a totalitarian system. We
would begin to examine their pro
posals seriously and ndt always
assume that they are full of "gim
micks." We would ardently seek
agreement wherever possible —
on H-bomb testing, for example,
as a preliminary to wider agree
ments on disarmament.
(2) Whether we attained agree
ment or not, however, we should
immediately change the character
of our national policy. Instead of
placing central reliance on mili
tary force, we should disarm uni
laterally.
(3) Accompanying this unilat
eral disarmament would be a
scheme for gigantic economic de
velopment under the United Na
tions. Thirty billions a year would

be turned over to the UN to be
used for relief, resettlement of
refugees and economic develop
ment.
(4) A part of the resources now
used to prepare for a futile and
suicidal war would be utilized for
peace research, training of lead
ers in non-violent resistance, and
the organization of a scheme of
non • violent resistance (strikes,
civil disobedience and non-co-op
eration) to possible invasion. The
Army, Air Force and Navy Acad
emies would be transformed into
training schools for non-violent
resistance leaders; and many of
those leaders would undoubtedly
come from the ranks of able and
dedicated former military, air
force and naval officers. A vast
educational scheme in the nature
of non-violent resistance would be
undertaken. Men would be pre
pared to die in resisting non-vio
lent ly but would be trained not
to kill.
Disarmament the Rule
(5) Long before non-violent re
sistance tactics had to be used, of
course, the world political climate
would have been drastically
changed. Competitive disarma
ment would become the rule (al
ready the pressures in this direc
tion are enormous). Ties of iron
curtain countries with the Soviet
Union, already tenuous, would
snap; for the basic propaganda
appeal of American "encircle
ment" would have been removed.
International political agreements
would be facilitated and the Unit
ed Nations, now freed from the
unrealistic politics of the arms

rare, could carry on its construc
tive activities unmenaeed by the
competition of either NATO or
the Warsaw Pact.
Utopian? In one sense, yes.
But in another and more funda
mental sense, only a policy of this
kind can be "realistic" —realistic
in protecting peace, freedom and
human life itself.
In terms of the individual's re
sponsibility, pacifism is a chal
lenge. It calls upon us to dedi
cate our lives to peace-making
and to consider seriously whether
wo can, as moral beings, partici
pate in armies, navies and air
forces and whether it is morally
legitimate to elect vocations pri
marily devoted to the making of
munitions of war.
In the end, peace will come
only when men refuse to fight.
Freedom will be extended only to
the extent that we eliminate slav
ishness in our minds and refuse
to subordinate ourselves to poten
tial tyrants—in large degree,
there are no tyrants but only
slaves.
