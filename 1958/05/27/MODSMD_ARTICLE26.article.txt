flecting his strong batting surge
over the final few games of the
season.

best earned-run average of the
regular pitchers 2.76. Dick Wil
liams won eight and lost only one
for the best percentage. Leopold
led in strikeouts with 94, and Wil

A comparison of this year's sta
tistics and those of last season
makes it evident that the current

Indian dub wielded quite a potent
hat.
The 19.18 team hatting average
of .295 is 43 points higher than
last season's. Six regulars hit over
.300, compared to just two last
year.
This year's team collected 101
more runs-batted-in, 7 more home
runs, 16 more triples, 20 more
doubles, 130 more hits and 111
more runs than last year's.
100 Points Higher
As would he expected, the won
loss record of 23-12 was nearly
100 percentage points higher than
last year's 17-13 mark. And, while
some critics might look at the
seven losses to Cal and USC as
indicative of a poor season, the
over-all .657 record is better than
the average mark of a pennant
winner in organized baseball.

liams yielded the fewest walks
among the regulars.
A comparison of this year's sta
tistics and those of last season
makes it evident that the current

Indian dub wielded quite a potent
hat.
The 19.18 team hatting average
of .295 is 43 points higher than
last season's. Six regulars hit over
.300, compared to just two last
year.
This year's team collected 101
more runs-batted-in, 7 more home
runs, 16 more triples, 20 more
doubles, 130 more hits and 111
more runs than last year's.
100 Points Higher
As would he expected, the won
loss record of 23-12 was nearly
100 percentage points higher than
last year's 17-13 mark. And, while
some critics might look at the
seven losses to Cal and USC as
indicative of a poor season, the
over-all .657 record is better than
the average mark of a pennant
winner in organized baseball.
Ralph Holding is batting cham
pion of the 1958 Stanford baseball
team, and A 1 Shaw is the leader
in six major departments.
Final statistics released today
show Holding finished at .358, re
flecting his strong batting surge
over the final few games of the
season.
Shaw led the Indians in rnns
with 11. tied for the hit lead wilh
44, had 10 doubles, 5 home runs,
batted in 38 counters, and drew
30 bases-on-balls—all tops for the
club.
Holding was co-holder of the
hit leadership with Shaw and Joel
Newkirk and had the most triples
•—six.
Top ERA
Lefty Bob Leopold compiled the
best earned-run average of the
regular pitchers 2.76. Dick Wil
liams won eight and lost only one
for the best percentage. Leopold
led in strikeouts with 94, and Wil
liams yielded the fewest walks
among the regulars.
