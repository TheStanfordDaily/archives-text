# Van Brocklin to Eagles for 2 Men
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (/P) â€” The
Philadelphia Eagles yesterday ac
quired quarterback Norm Van
Brocklin from the Los Angeles
Rams for two first-string players
and the Eagles' number one draft
choice in next year's player draft.
The Eagles gave up Bud Lans
ford, star offensive tackle; Jim
Harris, defensive back; and a fu
lure draft choice in an effort to
plug the weakest link in the
squad, quarterback.
The Eagles in the process of re
building were in desperate need
of a passer. Newly appointed
Coach Buck Shaw of the Eagles
was quoted recently as having
said, "I've got to have a veteran
passing quarterback."
Vince McNally, Philadelphia
general manager, said the deal
was three months in the making,
and that the Eagles had to outbid
three other teams to land the 32-
year-old ex-Oregon star.
The Rams decided to trade Van
Brocklin last winter when he an
nounced that he would no longer
play for the Rams if Sid Gillman
was their coach.
