Topnotch pitching by Dave Car
ter and Terry Lindeman helped
the Stanford freshman baseball
squad take its 11th and 12th vic
tories of the season over Harry
Ells and Sacred Heart highs last
weekend. Carter's 3-1 victory over
Harry Ells and Lindeman's 8-0

In Friday's game, Carter struck

help from Ed Hailey's double to
left and Bill Jensen's booming
two-bagger to right.
Lindeman went all Ihe way for
the frosh in his four-hit shutout.
He won his sixth and ends up the
top Papoose chucker with a 6-1
record.
John Hurlbut with two for two
and Bill Jensen with two for three
were the big hitters in the frosh
eight-run, 10-hit attack.
