# Top Track Stars Will Compete at Modesto
## 
### 
Pay ton Jordan will send only
one Stanford relay team to the
California Relays Saturday night
at Modesto, but 15 men will com
pete in individual events in a meet
that looks like northern Califor
nia's best of the year.
Conspicuous by his absence
from the Indian entries will be
Norman Lloyd. He's had tooth
trouble, so is having the problem
removed and won't race the rest
of this month.
Norm Pease, the No. 2 Stanford
sprinter, is also out of action—
with a pulled muscle he received
in his 100-yard dash heat in the
PCC Championships.
440 Team
Bon Anixter, Chuck Cobb, Skip
Face and Dean Smith will com
bine for Stanfords' only baton
entry. They'll go in the 440 relay.
Jordan also named seven defi
nite starters in the NCAA Cham
pionships June 13-14 at Berkeley.
Those who'll go are Smith
(sprints), Cobb (hurdles), Lloyd
(880 or mile), Ernie Cunliffe
(880), Maury Graves (two-mile),
Jerry Winters (shot-put) and
John Kelly (broad jump).
The Cal Relays will co-feature
the mile run and 100-yard dash.
Exciting 100
A five-barreled entry of stars
cotdd make for history's first le
gitimate 9.2 century. The sure
entries are Duke's Dave Sime,
Olympic champion Bobby Mor
row, San Jose's Ray Norton, Fres
no State's Mike Agostini and Cal's
Willie White. The first four have
all run 9.3, and White has run 9.4
and beaten Morrow.
Australians Herb Flliott and
Merv Lincoln will be the big mile
attractions. Elliott had no trou
ble winning the Coliseum Relays
in 3:57.8 and could get under Der
ek Ibbotson's unofficial world rec
ord of 3:57.2.
Elliott has been working in
northern California since ihe Col
iseum meet and should be well
prepared for the race. He and his
coach, Percy Cerutty, did take
time out to view the PCC meet
last Saturday.
