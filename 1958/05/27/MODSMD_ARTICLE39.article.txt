# Band to Present Final Concert
## 
### Camille Petersen 
The Stanford Symphonic Band
will present* a concert J line 1,
bringing to a close band activities
which have been participated in
by over 160 students during the
year.
The Symphonic Band is com
posed of 69 instrumentalists, who
have "auditioned and passed, thus
proving they are capable of per
forming the kind of music the
way we want it done," according
to Julius Shuchat, director.
In addition to this band, which
meets during winter and spring
quarters, there are five other
bands in which students may par
ticipate.
In the autumn there is the 110-
piece all-male Marching Band.
This group presents half-time
shows as well as playing in the
stands during the football season.
They make the annual trip south
to Los Angeles to support the
team and play at student rallies.
During Big Game rally night in

San Fra.tcisco, the Football Band
makes the rounds of all the alum
ni rallies at the hotels, playing a
few numbers for each group be
fore proceeding to Union Square
for the student rally.
The band holds a High School
Band Day each year. Last autumn
was the first time that the massed
band changed formations. Partici
pation in the band day is by in
vitation only.
Half - time stunts are planned
during spring quarter for the
football season by committees
headed by the senior band man
ager. The committee is formed of
members of all the bands, the jun
ior manager, the drum major and
Shuchat.
Forty-seven Members
Forty - seven members of the
Football Band play in the Sym
phonic Band.
During winter quarter there are
three bands. Concert, Symphonic
and Basketball, the latter two con
tinuing through the spring. Girls
are eligible to participate in the
Symphonic and Concert bands.
This year there were 35 in the
Concert Band. It is composed of
those who wish to play lighter
music than is played in the Sym
phonic Band, those who have not
yet reached proficiency or those
who are waiting for an opening
in their section of the Symphonic.
Basketball Band
The "red - vested" Basketball
Band was composed of 33 musi
cians, 31 of whom also played in
the Football Band last season.
This group plays at all home
games and follows the team to
Los Angeles and Berkeley.
Highlighting their trip to Los
Angeles this year was a guest ap
pearance at "Disneyland," after
which they were treated to free
rides.
The band only attempted to
reach Berkeley. The bus they
were riding got stuck in mud be
fore it left campus, and only two
of the members—who happened
to have driven cars up—arrived to
play for the game.
The ROTC Band is continuous

throughout the year and is com
posed primarily of AF-ROTC low
er division students and a few
from the Army ROTC program.
They rehearse once weekly during
drill and play for Air Force re
treat parades. Thirteen of the 24
in this band also participated in
the Football Band last season.
During World War II the bands
were discontinued, since football
was discontinued and the athletic
department had sponsored them.
In 1946 the bands were included
under the Music Department, and
Shuchat became director. Mem
bers earn one unit of credit.
The bands started with 60 mu
sicians, mostly returning veterans,
and all of the bands were com
posed of the same players.
In 3947 the group tried to pre
sent a concert at Frost Amphi
theater . . . never again! It seems
that there was so much competi
tion from private planes buzzing
down to see what was going on
that the music was lost in the
noise. All following concerts were
presented in Memorial Audito
rium. The June 1 concert will be
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The bands rehearse in the band
house, one of the more ancient
buildings on campus, located
across from the Pavilion and be

hind the men's tennis courts. Up
until this winter, there had been
no heat in the building, which
made rehearsing during winter
quarter difficult.
Financial support of the band
program comes from the athletic
department and from one donor
who had a son in one of the bands
and who yearly sends the bands a
Christmas check. This money is
used to buy music and help with
upkeep of instruments.
Basketball Band uniforms have
been bought by Kappa Kappa Psi,
band fraternity, which sponsors
the band. The student director of
the Basketball Band is elected
each year by Kappa Kappa Psi at
the end of autumn quarter. The
past year Bill Spuck was director.
Band officers for next year are:
senior manager, David Korten;
junior manager, Harvey Hundt;
drum major, Robert Capron;
properties, Kent Kepler; public re
lations, Curt Russell; and person
nel, Ernie Kirchner.
