graduates, it was announced,
Beginning next fall quarter,
sophomores will bo given priority
in filling vacancies in Stern and
Toyon halls. This and other
changes in the men's housing pro
gram were announced yesterday
by Dean of Men William G. Craig.
Students moving into Stern,
Toyon, Crothers and Crothers Me
morial next September will agree
to occupy their rooms for the
three quarters of the academic
year, it was announced. This will
not apply to current residents.
A student who wishes to move
out during the year may be re
lieved of his obligation if he se
cures a replacement, subject to
University approval. Exceptions
will bo worked out to meet emer
gencies and the rule does not ap
ply to those graduating or leav
ing school.
Men in these dorms who pledge
a fraternity during next autumn
quarter may move to the frater
nity at the end of the quarter.
Heretofore, priority to Stern
and Toyon has been based on the
length of time a man has lived j
off campus, in effect giving first '

call to seniors and juniors.
The new policy is based on Ihe
assumption that completion of the
two Stern wings will make it pos
sible lo accommodate all sopho
mores who wish to live in Stern
and Toy on.
On the same assumption, the
Village will be closed to sopho
mores. This provision will also
go into effect fall quarter unless
an adjustment period proves nec
essary.
The sophomore priority will
not cause eviction of any Stern
or Toyon residents, Dean Craig
emphasized. It applies only to
filling vacancies.
To implement development of
the house system, meal tickets
for the Stern dining room will be
limited to Stern men. The only
exception will be Village under
graduates in recognition of the
University's obligation to stu
dents living in a University resi
dence where food is not served.
Efforts will be made to provide
food service elsewhere for a lim
ited number of off-campus under
graduates, it was announced,
