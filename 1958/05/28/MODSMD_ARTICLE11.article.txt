# Pflimlin Wins Support But Wants Resignation
## Coty Seeks New Premier 
### 
PARIS, Wednesday (/P) — Pre
mier Pflimlin won'strong support
in the National Assembly today
but immediately tried to quit his
job in the face of General de
Gaulle's bold challenge for power.
Pflimlin was persuaded by
President Rene Coty to stay on
until a new government is ready
to take over.
Coty then started talks in an
effort to find a new premier.
There were these fast develop
ments:
New Developments
1. The National Assembly de
fied rightist-military leaders de
manding de Gaulle's return and
gave Pflimlin a firm vote of con
fidence.
2. Pflimlin called an emergency
Cabinet meeting.
3. From the Cabinet meeting
the Premier went to call on Presi
dent Coty at Elysee Palace and
offered to resign.
Refuses Resignation
4. President Coty refused to ac
cept the resignation, saying that
it would not be acceptable until
a new government is ready to
take over.
5. Coty began urgent consulta
tions in an effort to find a pre
mier to replace Pflimlin. He did
not accept the resignation since
he wished to avoid any gap be
tween governments.
I)e Gaulle Wants Power
De Gaulle towered over all po
tential candidates but there was
doubt whether he could muster
majority approval in the Assem
bly. The general has said he
wants to take power but only
through legal means.
This raised the grave question
of a continuing impasse in
France's greatest postwar crisis.
The Assembly endorsement ap
peared to give Pflimlin more
time to deal with the myriad
problems confronting the French
government. But the Premier's
decision that he wanted out
brought new confusion.
"Important Group"
Leaving Coty, Pflimlin told
newsmen he had tried to quit be
cause an "important group" of
supporters—the Conservative In
dependents — had deserted the
government on the latest Assem
bly vote and the party's three rep
resentatives in the Cabinet had
resigned.
"Thus the government finds it
self weakened at the moment
when it must face tasks which
are heavier and heavier," he said.
Pflimlin added, however, that
he would stay in office rather
than create a gap in power in the
present dynamite - charged situa
tion.

"Important Group"
Leaving Coty, Pflimlin told
newsmen he had tried to quit be
cause an "important group" of
supporters—the Conservative In
dependents — had deserted the
government on the latest Assem
bly vote and the party's three rep
resentatives in the Cabinet had
resigned.
"Thus the government finds it
self weakened at the moment
when it must face tasks which
are heavier and heavier," he said.
Pflimlin added, however, that
he would stay in office rather
than create a gap in power in the
present dynamite - charged situa
tion.

In Paris, Pflinilin Seeks Resignation as Premier, Crisis Continues
PARIS, Wednesday (/P) — Pre
mier Pflimlin won'strong support
in the National Assembly today
but immediately tried to quit his
job in the face of General de
Gaulle's bold challenge for power.
Pflimlin was persuaded by
President Rene Coty to stay on
until a new government is ready
to take over.
Coty then started talks in an
effort to find a new premier.
There were these fast develop
ments:
New Developments
1. The National Assembly de
fied rightist-military leaders de
manding de Gaulle's return and
gave Pflimlin a firm vote of con
fidence.
2. Pflimlin called an emergency
Cabinet meeting.
3. From the Cabinet meeting
the Premier went to call on Presi
dent Coty at Elysee Palace and
offered to resign.
Refuses Resignation
4. President Coty refused to ac
cept the resignation, saying that
it would not be acceptable until
a new government is ready to
take over.
5. Coty began urgent consulta
tions in an effort to find a pre
mier to replace Pflimlin. He did
not accept the resignation since
he wished to avoid any gap be
tween governments.
I)e Gaulle Wants Power
De Gaulle towered over all po
tential candidates but there was
doubt whether he could muster
majority approval in the Assem
bly. The general has said he
wants to take power but only
through legal means.
This raised the grave question
of a continuing impasse in
France's greatest postwar crisis.
The Assembly endorsement ap
peared to give Pflimlin more
time to deal with the myriad
problems confronting the French
government. But the Premier's
decision that he wanted out
brought new confusion.
