## 
### 
WASHINGTON (&)— President
Eisenhower yesterday signed into
law the biggest postal rate in
crease ever voted by Congress.
The bill, which he approved
even while noting objectionable
provisions, also carries the big
gest postal pay increase ever vot
ed. Most postal workers will get
approximately a 10 per cent raise,
retroactive to last Jan. 1.
Of most interest to the mail
using public is the fact that first
class letters will require a four
cent stamp, instead of three, ef
fective Aug. 1. Airmail will go
up from the present six cents to
seven cents, post cards from two
to three.
The administration had favored
higher rates than Congress voted,
and not so large a pay increase.
In that connection, Eisenhower
said in a statement:
"Although the bill adopts the
policy that postal revenues shall
be approximately equal to postal
expenditures other than those in
curred in performing certain pub
lic services, the rate adjustments
provided therein fail by several
hundred million dollars to bring
the postal account into balance."
