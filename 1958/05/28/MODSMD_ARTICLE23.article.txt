A Deeply Etched Impression
Editor, The Daily:
Without entering into the merits and demerits
of the case which has involved my name, and
which has been discussed in The Daily for about
three weeks, I should like to make two points
about the peripheral discussion:
(1) One phase of the discussion seems to set
teaching over against research. This is unfortu
nate. for research is the basis of BOTH teaching
and writing. We should refuse to accept any
formula which makes the central issue teaching
VERSUS research.
(2) Another allegation is the supposed distinc
tion between "undergraduate" and "graduate"
teaching. It seems to be assumed that a "8.A."
behind one's name makes one a different creature
and that the teaching process is accordingly
altered.
This I deny—on the basis of experience which
includes teaching some 100 undergraduate and
GO graduate students each quarter and acting as
Ph.D. and M.A. adviser to more than 20 each year.
Problems of teaching at the two levels are simi
lar, although naturally the graduate student is
usually older and is somewhat better prepared to
move immediately into advanced problems.
In conclusion, I wish to thank The Daily for its
remarkably able presentation of educational prob
lems and for the intelligence and vigor with
which it has supported its position. Life at Stan
ford will undoubtedly be affected by the discus
sion of the past weeks.
May I also take this opportunity to thank most
warmly all the students who. by their questions,
comments and encouragement, have made these
months a memorable time for me? While I shall
not be with you next year. I shall take with me
to another great university a profound and deeply
etched impression of your eagerness to learn,
your feeling for humanity and your genuine
quest for freedom. Your kindness I shall never
forget.

Supplement Outstanding
Editor, The Daily:
The supplement of your May 22 edition is
really outstanding! Congratulations to the con
tributors, staff editor Hicks and yourself.

Responsibility Is Students
Editor, The Daily:
The May 22 Daily supplement on education
impressed me very favorably. Though it may
appear rash to some that students should want
to change the way their teachers teach (who,
after all, have had some experience in this field),
the fact that "a very sizable minority of students
are questioning Stanford's educational practices"
shows that they are interested in more than an
official education.
The supplement would have done well to in
clude an article on the students' failings. It seems
to be assumed that academic apathy at Stanford
is largely the fault of teachers and adminis
trators.
I think this is looking at the problem from the
wrong viewpoint. Serious talk outside of the
classroom is taboo. There is a nearly hysterical
fear of becoming a "student," with the result that
few become students. The common boast and
sign of success is to have gotten a good grade

without hard work. Are these attitudes the
faculty's fault? To some extent. But no basic
chance would result with the importation of
many high-powered teachers.
Let us not make a fetish of good teaching. Too
often we want a dynamic, stimulating teacher
who is TOO good: as he scintillates the material
at us, it .seems interesting. We make notes, smile,
acquire knowledge. The stimulation stops with
the bell, and, like a Pavlov dog, so do our mental
processes.
I do not ask for a boring teacher—only that we
remember that the teacher is not the central part
of a course. Good teaching, it seems to me, helps
make the student eager to continue his study,
read extra material, discuss and evaluate it with
others. The largest part of the responsibility and
initiative for learning rests with the student, not
the teacher.
At some eastern colleges students desiring to
realize the full potential of their educational op
portunity have agreed to meet informally, with
or without a faculty member, to discuss course
material, extra reading and outside research.
These discussion groups were not required by
anything except the students' desire to help them
selves to a fuller understanding of the subjects
they study.
A similar development at Stanford would show
that we are not content merely to criticize, but
want to do something constructive ourselves. One
suspects that this "stimulation" idea works both
ways—that the faculty itself can be encouraged
and stimulated,

We Deserve Better
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to publicly criticize Quad editor Michael
Roemer and his staff for the haphazard job they
did on the 1958 yearbook. Many persons in the
pictures were wrongly identified, the pictures
were very often just different camera angles
from the other pictures, and the captions were
for the most part inane and unimaginative. We
deserve better than that for our money.

Tliey Keep Their Noses Clean
Editor, The Daily:
We read that 62 professors at San Francisco
State College placed a full-page advertisement in
the campus newspaper calling for cessation of
nuclear weapons testing. Why is the Stanford
faculty so strangely silent?
Those who have sounded faculty opinion know
that a good segment of Stanford professors are
opposed to continued 11-bomb tests. Yet when the
student demonstration occurred here, only five
or six of them so much as wrote letters to The
Daily.
Similarly, when the news broke that Dr. Sibley
was not to be rehired, a great many faculty mem
bers were alarmed at the dictatorial powers of a
few administrative officials. Nevertheless, while
the student body seethed, the faculty sat tight
and trembled.
Freedom does not exist when men are afraid
to speak. Private universities have traditionally
been the strongholds of free speech. If freedom
does not exist here, where, in fact, does it exist?
In a world confused and violent, we look to the
wise for leadership. The wise are prudently
silent. They shall be rehired. They shall be pro
moled. They shall study 15th-century literature
and keep their noses clean.
