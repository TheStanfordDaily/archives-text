# LASSU Passes Budget; IIR Appropriations Cut
## 
### Leo Krulitz 
Legislature last week passed a budget for the Assneiated Students
totaling more than $35,000. The 1958-59 master budget cut the lIR
appropriation nearly $1000 under this year's figure and expanded
the Hostel program sponsored by Cardinals.
Budgeting $2768 to the lIR, as compared to $3708.70 this year.

Legislature increased the number
of delegates to the Model United
Nations from 10 to 12 and warned
in a footnote that, because of the
loss of $850 on the Affiliations
Scholars Benefit Concert th is
year, lIR would have to raise
$2000 if the Berlin and Keio schol
ar exchange program were to con
tinue in 1959-60.
Cutting the speakers' revolving
fund of the Stanford Political
Union from $373.38 to $150, a foot
note explained: "Political Union
may request LASSU to appropri
ate more funds when the $150 has
been used. In this way Legisla
ture can keep aware of the speak
er program, and the relative
worth of the speakers can be eval
uated from time to time."
