# Class of '58 Plaque-laying To Be June 14
## 
### Susan Geary 
On Class Day, June 14, the class
of 1958 will hold the traditional
plaque-laying ceremony in front
of Memorial Church, with a dedi
cation by President Sterling and
senior class president Gerry Bays.
Buried in an airtight box and
tube made by the Corporation
Yard will be this year's Quad,
Frosh Book, class directory, scroll,
class papers. Chappies and com
mencement programs.
This tradition was initiated by
the class of 1896, which, wishing
to leave something to he remem
bered by, painted "'96" in large
white numerals on a University
building.
Rainy weather blurred the nu
merals, and the class treasurer
conceived a more permanent mon
ument—a bronze plaque laid in a
place of honor directly in front of
the center entrance to Memorial
Church.
Stealing Glory
Later a visiting member of the
class of 1895, strolling among the
memories of Inner Qua d, was
startled by the bronze "disfigure
ment" in the pavement. The word
was spread among his graduated
class of the attempt of the young
er generation to steal their glory.
One night two daring members
of the class of '95—rumored to be
C. S. Burnell, now a Los Angeles
superior court judge, and Oliver
Morton, Los Angeles attorney—
painted their numeral on Inner
Quad directly in front of the north
entrance.
Again nature proved more pow
erful than man's endeavor to be
remembered, and the "95" was
washed into oblivion.
The class compromised, and a
bronze plaque was set late in the
evening "without public announce
ment or alien witness." It remains
in front of Memorial Church
ahead of '96 and a little off-center.
Class of '92
The reverse movement halted
for 15 years, and many a fresh
man attending Sunday church
services thought '95 was the ear
liest Stanford class.
Then in 1916 the class of '92
planted its monument, and in 1919
on Alumni Day '93 and '94 laid
their plaques.
In 1920 Ben Facciolla, an immi
grant from Italy, became linked
with the tradition. From 1920 to
1950 Facciolla, Stanford mason,
was present at the ceremonies to
trowel the concrete around the
plaques. During the war years he
enabled the tradition to go on by
fabricating the plaques out of a
rich, red-colored concrete mixture
to replace the scarce bronze.
Bronze Plaque
This spring a bronze plaque
with figure "1958" in gray metal
will be laid in the pattern set by
the class of '96—as was predicted
by David Starr Jordan in 1899.
According to the Daily Palo
Alto, Dr. Jordan said at the '99
ceremony, "In the nature of
things, when the fair year of 2517
comes, we shall find ourselves at
this point again."
When four other series of red
brown squares are filled, it will
be the year 5097, Dr. Jordan said;
and when, by switching to a dif
ferent-colored metal for the plate,
the gray squares are filled, it will
be 8297.
