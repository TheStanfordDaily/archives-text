Alter viewing the color movies,
Robert Gordon Sproul, California
president and head judge, and
Harold Berliner, the meet refer
ee, did a complete flip-flop and
moved the announced winner,
Southern California's Dave Hol
lingsworth, to fifth place.
Walt Arlt of Washington State,
ruled the second - place finisher-
Saturday, was declared the win
ner with Steve Anderson, Oregon,
second; Bob Lawson. USC. third,
and Monte Upshaw, California,
fourth.

the finishers on the spot. They
guessed, but were wrong.

second. The third spot went to
