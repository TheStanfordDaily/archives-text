# FOUR-MAN TEAM
## Setters Look Ahead To NCAA Tourney 
### 
With the first annual PCC tennis championships in the history
books and the regular dual match competition completed, the Stan
ford varsity netters are now looking forward to the NCAA cham
pionships which will take place next month at the U.S. Naval Acad
emy in Annapolis, Md.
Stanford's hopes at Annapolis will be carried by a four-man team

consisting of Jack Douglas, Dave
Nelson, Brooks Rawlins and Jim
Jeffries.
All four men will compete in
the singles tourney and Nelson
will pair up with Douglas and Jef
fries with Rawlins for ihe doub
les competition.
USC Strong
The Indians who have had
much trouble this year with col
leges located in ihe Los Angeles
area should find one of these
schools their strongest opposition
at Annapolis. UCLA is ineligible
for the big tourney due to ath
letic probation placed on them by
the NCAA but USC, which had
been on probation until lately,
will be there ready to vie for the
title.

The Trojans' A 1 Olmedo will be
favored to regain the NCAA sin
gles crown which he won two
years ago but which he had to
give up last year when his school
was ineligible for competition.
Along with Olmedo other top
collegiate entries who may fare
well in singles are Ronny Ilolm
berg and Crawford Henry who
will be representing a strong Tu
lane team, Art Andrews from the
University of lowa, Ted N'eely
from Georgia Tech and Donald
Dell of Yale.
Nelson Can Win
Bolh Dave Nelson and Jack
Douglas also have outstanding
chances to do well in the tourney.
Nelson, the Indian junior who has
come on so well in the second half
of the season, was the only netter
to lake a set off Olmedo in the
PCC tourney last weekend and
although it would be surprising
for him to defeat the Peruvian
Ihe possibilities are still there.
Douglas will probably be seeded
in the top Ihree tourney spots
and he also could go all the way.
His luck against Olmedo has been
rather poor this year but he has
beaten him in the past.
Outside of Olmedo, Douglas
should also find his hands full
with Davis Cupper Ronny Holm
berg who can be extremely tough.
Coach Renker, who has done
his usual top-notch job with this
year's leam, can look very en
thusiastically to next year for he
will have practically his same
team back.
