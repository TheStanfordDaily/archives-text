# Top Event: Topping Dons
## 
### Dick Barnes, Sports Editor 
Upsets are a vital life-blood of sports;
without them, sports could become com
pletely predictable—interest would die.
Each sports season produces many little
upsets and a few major ones. The Daily
sports staff has chosen one of the year's
biggest reversals as the Outstanding Stan
ford Sports Event of 1957-58.
It all started routinely enough on Dec.
17 at the Cow Palace as the University of
San Francisco picked up early 3-4-5-point
leads over Howie Dallmar's Indian basket
bailers. Sure, Stanford had led 1-0, but that
didn't mean much.
There wasn't much question that USE
would win this early-season game. The
Dons were ranked fourth in the nation;
Stanford was an erratic, sophomore-laden
team that didn't even have a senior on it.
And just Ihe night before in this same Cow
Palace, the Cards had been bombed 67-45 by
a fairly good Santa Clara team—but the
Bronocs weren't nearly as good as USE.
By half time, it was 29-20, USE, and most
of the 6500 fans anticipated a final margin
of about twice that. But the Indians reeled
off six straight points at the start of the
second half. USE pulled out again, but
couldn't seem to get the one bucket that
would put the game out of reach.
Pretty soon the Don margin was running
in the 2-3-4 range. And then there were 16
seconds to go and San Francisco had a
seemingly-safe 49 46 lead. But with 15 sec

onds left it was 49-18 as John Arrillaga
threw in two points.
And in another eight seconds, Paul Neu
mann was stealing the ball from Gene
Brown and throwing it back down to Ar
rillaga, standing at the baseline 14 feet from
the hoop.
Arrillaga Scores
lie didn't have time to do anything ex
cept shoot, lie did. lie also scored, and
Stanford led 50-49 with three ticks left on
the clock. USE tried some fancy down
court maneuvers, but to no avail. And the
Indians had their victory, the Dons had
their national reputation smeared, and the
sports scribes had plenty to write about.
Probably the saddest thing about the
Stanford event of the year was that it took
place during the Christmas vacation, and
no more than a handful of students were
on hand to see it. But they heard about it.
There were plenty of other good mo
ments, plus the bad ones, that gave the
USE upset close competition for the event
of the year title.
A Big Game victory is always a big thing
here, and this year's 14-12 squeaker was
no exception. And, too, there was the 20-0
retribution handed UCLA. But for sheer
football drama, there was no matching the
27-26 loss to Oregon.
Basketball had its other thrilling mo
ments, too — like the wins over Oregon
State, UCLA and USC. Baseball's best took

eight days to oomo about, but Stanford fi
nally got five runs in the 14th to beat Cali
fornia in that darkness-interrupted battle.
Lloyd, Cobb Sot Records
Either of Norm Lloyd's school records in
the 880 and mile, Chuck Cobb's 13.9 in the
high hurdles or Maury Graves' Texas Re
lays victory in record two-mile time could
qualify as the track topper. And don't for
get the 3:11.4 relay victory that beat Fres
no State here.
Another PCC swimming crown and even
the off-the-field search for a football coach
can't be omitted, and there were plenty
more big moments that made 1957-58 an
other exciting, though not always winning,
sports year here at Stanford.
