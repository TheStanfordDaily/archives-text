# Braves Gain 1 on Giants
## 
### 
Richie Ashburn proved the Giant killer
as he led his Philadelphia Philly teammates
to a 5-1 victory over the San Franciscans
by going three for three at the plate includ
ing a booming triple.
The defeat, coupled with a Milwaukee 3-2
win over St. Louis, moved the Braves to
only one game away from the Giants and
the league lead.
Pinch-hitting Joe Adcock smashed a two
run homer with two out in the ninth to
produce the winning Brave runs. The blow
climaxed an uphill battle by Milwaukee
over their old Card nemesis, Sad Sam Jones.
