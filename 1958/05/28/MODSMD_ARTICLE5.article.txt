# Administration Announces Loans Policy
## 
### 
A new policy, extending long
term loans to sophomores and
juniors, has been outlined by Rob
ert Huff, director of financial
aids.
Huff said previously loans pay
able after graduation were avail
able only to seniors.
Students with a C average may
borrow up to $335 a quarter or
$670 a year, with a total of $2010
during their undergraduate years.
Arrangements may be made,
Huff said, to repay the loans in
monthly installments beginning
about six months after gradua
tion. Extensions up to five years
will be available for those doing
graduate work or entering the
military service, or otherwise not
going to work immediately after
graduation.
"Every student who needs fi
nancial aid next year should ap
ply for it," Huff said. "Not only
are scholarships available, but
also grants-in-aid and loans. The
April 15 scholarship deadline has
been extended to the end of the
quarter because so many stu
dents are affected by the in
creased tuition and room and
board," he said.
Huff explained that students
should apply first for a scholar
ship and reminded that the schol
arship blanks have a section to be
filled out by parents. He said that
students not qualifying for a
scholarship will be considered for
other financial aid.
