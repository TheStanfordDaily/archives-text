# Student Magazine To Feature Sibley
## 
### 
The spring issue of the Bridge,
a student magazine of interna
tional opinions, will go on sale
Thursday and Friday.
It will feature an article by
Mulford Q. Sibley, professor of
political science, on "Non-Violent
Power in a World of Violence."
Sibley was recently the center of
controversy when he was not
asked to remain at the University
next year.
Other articles concern a stand
against Communism by Stewart
Brand, a solution to the Algerian
crisis by Hubert J. Morel-Scy
toux and a criticism of the Oki
nawan occupation.
The magazine will be sold in
the Law School lounge and in
front of the Cellar and the Main
Library for 25 cents.
