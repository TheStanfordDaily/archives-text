# Astronomer Gives Look At Universe
## 
### Bob Latham 
Nicholas U. Mayall gave last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
audience a glimpse into the uni
verse and the field of astronomy.
Several slides and a movie
showed the construction of "Lick
Observatory's 120-Inch Telescope
and Plans for Its Work on Nebu
lae."
Lick Observatory, which is lo
cated on Mt. Hamilton about 30
miles east of Stanford, will be
the site of the world's second
largest telescope when it is com
pleted later this year.
The structure, composed of a
mammoth dome which houses
the huge telescope and its 120-
inch mirror, was financed by Cali
fornia ptate funds at a cost of
$2,500, OpO.
The telescope will provide a
valuable means of research into
the billions of galaxies that are
too faint to be seen by other
means.
The theory of "red shift."
which holds that stars whose
spectrums show predominantly
infra-red are moving away from
the earth, will also be tested.
