# Navy Sends New Moon Up
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/P)
â€”A Navy Vanguard rocket shot
skyward last night, carrying a
21 Mi-pound satellite equipped to
solve the secrets of ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.
The latest Vanguard rocket
was the first in a series of seven
designed to shoot man - made
moons into orbit as part of this
country's contribution to the In
ternational Geophysical Year.
Its 20-inch gold-plated sphere is
tiny compared with Russia's IV->-
ton Sputnik 111, but it is capable
of relaying vital information
about the sun back to scientists
on earth.
The satellite houses delicate in
struments to measure ultraviolet
hydrogen known as Lyman al
pha rays shooting from the sun
in solar flares.
Scientists suspect that sudden
bursts of this radiation cause phe
nomena in the earth's ionosphere
which affect weather and radio
communications.
