# Dr. Wright Says De Gaulle Will Leave France Divided

Dr. Gordon Wright of the History Department
predicted yesterday that General Charles de Gaulle
will become premier of France "within the week,"
that his cabinet "will last a very short time- prob
ably only a few months," and that when de Gaulle
falls from power "France will be even more di
vided than it is now."
Wright, an expert on France, told The Daily that
"things in France have slipped into a very deep
pit. Sides have been chosen, and it is almost im
possible to get out unless an outsider is brought
in to act as arbiter."
The Algerian group, he said, "has gone so far
it can't back down, and the Paris group can't let
them get away with it."
Wright thinks "things may have reached the
point where there seems to be no alternative to a
bloody upheaval except Gaullism, which might
give temporary rest, but in the long run would
create more problems."
The French general has made no policy state
ments since he controlled France's provisional
government after World War 11, and no one knows
exactly what he might do as premier.
Wright believes de Gaulle would try, for one
thing, to change the present electoral system, as
a way to insure a stronger, more stable govern
ment, since "there is not much point in holding
elections under the present systemâ€”the same
groups are returned to power."
But Wright observed that "thinking elections
are a way out is comparable to seeing lightning
about to hit you and getting on your knees and
praying."
France's problems in North Africa would cer
tainly be one of de Gaulle's main concerns, and
Wright thinks most of de Gaulle's followers would
be "disillusioned" by his conduct of the Algerian
crisis.
Wright noted that some Gaullists believe their
hero would give Algeria its independence, while
other supporters expect de Gaulle to wage an all

out fight with both Algeria and Tunisia to keep
them under French control.
Obviously, de Gaulle cannot do both, and Ihe
probability is that he would do neither. Wright
feels he would try to negotiate with the Algerians
and Tunisians to form a North African federation
under French tutelage.
Wright sees this as "one of the few favorable
results one might hope for from a Gaullist gov
ernment."
President Rene Coty has been putting pressure
on the Socialists and the MRP ("Popujar Republi
can" party of the center), Wright said, to force
them to accept de Gaulle.
Coty believes that if de Gaulle is rejected, a
"popular front" government would foilow in
which case he would resign.
An old-style conservative, Coty thinks a strong
government is necessary as the only alternative
to civil war.
Wright said the French Communists during the
current crisis are "making a great show of being
the defenders of democracy" by refusing to accept
de Gaulle, in order to effect a rapprochement with
the parties of the moderate left.
If de Gaulle becomes premier, the Communists
will "wait for a few months until his cabinet is in
trouble, and then demand a popular front govern
ment."
Some observers feel de Gaulle might try to
"make up" to Russia, but Wright thinks a "stiff
neck" policy is more likely. "De Gaulle will co
operate with Russia on his own terms."
His government would "set back the European
unity movement. He hasn't much sympathy with
it."
Wright is not sure who would take part in a
Gaullist cabinet. He said he would have suspected
until last week that de Gaulle would enlist former
premier Pierre Mendes-France to reform France's
economy, but Mendes-France has declared himself
against the Gaullist movement.
In any case, Wright said de Gaulle "will not be
run by his cabinet. He has always done as he
wished, and he always will."
