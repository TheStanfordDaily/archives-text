# SENATE CHALLENGE
## House Passes Alaska Statehood Bill 208-166 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP) â€”The House yesterday passed 208-166 a bill to
admit Alaska to statehood.
In a dramatic reversal of form, the House twice rejected efforts to
send the bill back to the House Insular Affairs Committee. It also
defeated on a voice vote the decision by which it voted tentatively

Tuesday to kill the bill.
The action sent the bill to the
Senate where it faces a new and
possibly stronger challenger. An
Alaska bill, as well as one to ad
mit Hawaii, has been on the Sen
ate calendar since last June.
The statehood bill is opposed by
most Southern Senators who cite
various reasons. But it is gener
ally recognized that the Southern
ers mainly fear that the addition
of new Senate seats would upset
their balance of power in the Sen
ate.
However, it was considered like
ly the bill will come up in the
Senate by mid-June.
Also in Congress, the Senate
passed and sent to the White
House yesterday a bill authoriz
ing federal advances to the states
to finance a temporary extension
of unemployment benefits.
The vote was 80-0 on passage,
after various counter proposals
were turned down.
It permits the federal govern
ment to advance funds to the
states to extend by as much as
one-half the number of weeks in
which workers eligible for unem
ployment insurance may draw
benefits.
The amount and duration of
payments vary from state to
state, but in more than half the
states this would amount to 13 ad
ditional weeks.
