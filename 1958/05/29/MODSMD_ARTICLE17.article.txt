Tiif.*Daii.y is through for another year, ami wo
will try to avoid the danger of becoming senti
mental over its passing.
There wasn't enough time to make Volume
133 what we thought it should he last February;
yet some days we thought the quarter would
never end.
We regret all the things we meant to do ami
didn't, and we apologize for all the things we

did hut shouldn't have.
Although we attacked the system every morn
ing regularlv, we shall probably join the ranks
of nostalgic alumni before long.
We end on a note of hope: slowly, very slowly,
things are improving. We wish the best of luck
to the very capable Editorial Board of next
fall's Daily and hope they can help effect- fur
ther improvement.
