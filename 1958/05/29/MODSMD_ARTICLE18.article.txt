6 Class of \l>ft Speaks Vp 9
Editor, The Daily:
I was struck, in a recent feature by The Nation.
"The Class of '58 Speaks Up," at how revealing
the four student-written articles were about their
respective alma maters, even though the article-s
all dealt with the general topic "Is There a Life
After Graduation?"
The writer from Dartmouth gave one the im
pression of a small, homogeneous student body,
united by their great respect for a few professors
and their opinions. The student from the Univer
sity of Washington was most concerned with
eking out an education in the midst of the un
stimulative student body of a state school.
The article from Stanford by David Egger and
Ellen Maytag drew its illustrations of the world
after graduation from what was learned in deal
ing with a sluggish, sometimes unsympathetic
Administration, plus a thumbnail sketch of Mr.
Stanford Rough acting with the same short-term
values held had he never come to college. He is
common in the world outside; he also happens to
be in the majority on this campus.
What the article omitted was interesting, espe
cially in the light of the article from Yale: de
tailed comments on the quality of their educa
tion. The Yale student devoted himself to prais
ing his coherent liberal arts training and the
stimulation gained from having faculty live in
the dorms.
The Administration is not convinced that more
contact with scholars and more demands made on
the students will help the tone of the University;
that living conditions and companionship have
anything to do with encouraging the interested
students; or will even admit that Stanford educa
tion lacks something. . . .
More use could be made of our own faculty in
panel discussions such as were recently given by
the econ department. The more interesting fig
ures of the department as well as faculty of other
fields were included on the panels. There was a
long period devoted to questions from students.
Money could be made more available—raised by
students as some scholarships are each year, if
necessary—to bring more speakers and documen
tary movies to the campus.
I was impressed that the lIR gave students an
opportunity to talk with James Reston when he
was here, and that Stanford faculty led discus
sions after one of his talks.
In dorms the freshmen could learn what good
courses to look forward to and could see that
there is an alternative to "Well, you have to
major in something" by living with upperclass
men, some of whom are bound to be interested in

their fields and know what reputation courses
have. . . .
Finally, as a last-quarter senior, I feel an acute
need for some kind of summing up. I wish I were
studying now for a comprehensive exam in my
major. At the highest level, the Administration
is most concerned with getting money to carry on
the existing plant and building programs. The
fact that this must consume most of their time
does not mean that it should be valued in itself.
If the University had a burning interest in the
quality of education here, the least imaginative
proposals of the S.U.E. would not have been
chosen for the General Studies Program.
The point of this windy letter is to congratulate
The Daily on its education supplement, with the
hope that other similar things can be done next
year. . . .
One has tcs dig for stimulation at Stanford.
I have done this quietly with mild success for
four years, only to have younger interested stu
dents tell me they are having trouble finding an
interesting place to live on campus, getting infor
mation about courses and events of interest in
the city, and controlling their exasperation in the
more inane lower-division courses of their major.
Is the situation growing worse, or are the stu
dents getting brighter? I am graduating bitter—
something I would not have expected a year ago
—and am jealous of Yale. Perhaps changes will
come in the next few years.

'Would JSot Be Allowed*
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's Daily there was a letter headed
"They Keep Their Noses Clean," comparing the
outspoken faculty of San Francisco State College
(which placed a full-page advertisement in the
school paper calling for the cessation of I-I-bomb
tests) with the quiescent Stanford faculty.
During this quarter's H-bomb demonstration a
group of faculty members sent an anti-nuclear
bomb telegram to President Eisenhower. When
I, as a Daily reporter at the time, inquired about
1 his telegram, one professor said, "We would not
be allowed—," then embarrassedly changed his
statement to "It would be in poor taste" for
faculty members to publicize the fact that they
had participated in such a controversial political
activity.
Not wishing to be responsible for the sudden
termination of a faculty member's career, I acted
as requested and did not report the story to The
Daily.
