# THE
						SILENT GENERATION ANSWERS:
## We Are Heirs to Disillusion'- Help Us Profit From the Past 
### David Egger Ellen Maytag 
(Editor's Note: The following'
is a reprint of an article writ
ten for the May 17 issue of The
Nation.)
If I were in charge of gradua
tion ceremonies, I would invite as
speaker a man who had proved
his understanding of our genera
tion by writing something that
made sense to us.
But rather than listen passively
to his analysis of our strengths
and weaknesses, and his call to
action, I would like to have an op
portunity to question him, to give
my own point of view where I be
lieved his to be incorrect.
Perhaps my classmates would
speak up, too. We are a thought
ful generation and cautious, but
we are not silent.
Listen:
Speaker: You, the graduates of
1958. are potentially • the worst
generation this country has ever
had. Each graduating class has
been faced with problems it did
not create, but you are the first
generation to know that your fail
ure will mean the destruction of
mankind.
Nuclear Control
If you do not find a method of
controlling nuclear weapons, civi
lization will disappear. While
•some members of my generation
believed themselves free to ignore
Hitler's rise, or the Spanish civil
war, none of you is free to ignore
Khrushchev or the hydrogen
bomb.
Fortunately, you have strong
assets. You grew up in time of
war. You learned how senseless,
how beastly civilized peoples
could be. Perhaps you accepted
too readily mass murders, nuclear
destruction and cold war. But at
least you have faced, all your life,
what your parents still do not
understand — that this is a new
world, a world which "finds noth
ing sacred in the sheer nakedness
of being human."
Pat Solutions
Fortunately, too, you have seen
that pat solutions—socialism, pac
ifism, communism and democracy
—are naive and unfeasible: that
one cannot, perfect but only im
prove. You are precocious real
ists, heirs to your parents' disillu
sion. Because you have listened
to them and learned from their
mistakes, you do not act as they
did. The very fact that you have
profited from their advice makes
you a mystery to them.
You are sophisticated, but what
disturbs my generation most is
your apparent apathy. It looks as
if many of you are planning to
take the easy way. Unlike the
young of my day—who wanted to
save the world, to make a million
dollars, or to write the great
American novel — you aim no
higher than a two-car garage, a
suburban bungalow, a job with
General Motors.
Where is your ambition? I am
not calling for revolutionary zeal;
you have learned early and well
that the world is not easily or
safely changed. I only fear that
your sophistication will lead not
to mature action but to paralysis.
Complex Problems
International problems ARE
enormous. Modern life grows
more and more complex. But pa
ralysis means self-destruction.
You are too prone to identify the
present with the permanent. The
problems facing this country will
not wait. Unless you can take the
step from intelligent analysis to
purposeful aclion, you will lose
the world by default.
First Student: Wait a minute!
What's wrong with my wanting
a house in the suburbs? If I don't
look out for myself, who will?
I can't make a fortune, because of
the income tax. Anyway, I don't

want the headaches connected
with a lot of money as long as I
can buy everything I want with
my salary.
As for politics, what can 1 do?
The o d d s against me are too
great. For one thing, the prob
lems are too complicated; for an
other, national politics is dirty
business. I'm better off seeing
that my community has adequate
schools and that the Junior Cham
ber- of Commerce has some life
in it.
These are things that I CAN
do; they're the only things that
hold much meaning for 1 me. As
for employment in a large corpo
ration, well, I have to eat. I want
a wife and children. And I don't
want to work all my life, only to
starve when I'm 60.
When my parents were young,
they didn't think ahead. I'm not
going to repeat their mistake.
What's wrong with General Mo
tors? It's an exciting organiza
tion, pioneering in research. It
offers good money and quick pro
motions. I'll conform eight hours
a day and be a free man in my
own home. The world will prob
ably be better off without my
messing in it.
The experts seem confused, but
they're probably doing their best.
If they blow us up, it's too ba\i.
But what can I do?
Second Student: Not all of us
want the suburbs. Some of us
want to make this a world that
doesn't threaten to fly apart at
any minute. Don't tell us the
problems. Tell us what we can do
about them.
Real Ignorance
Our sophistication hides real ig
norance. We're too serious for
football games and rallies; we're
too smart for panaceas and share
the-wealth. It seems stupid to
waste energy in the pointless
scurrying around that your gen
eration was so fond of. If we
could find -something that made
sense, something that would be of
real benefit to ourselves and to
mankind, we would do it.
But no one, least of all you,
seems to know what to do. Sure,
we've learned from the mistakes
you've made. But. you spend too
much time telling us things we
already know. Tell us what you
have learned as adults. Help us
to profit from your experience.
We know we can't trust report
ers, announcers, or telecasters.
When the Russians publish lies
about their country, our Govern
ment answers with its own lies.
It's hard to see the difference.
Our professors perpetuate lies;
our University's Administration
has fed us on a four-year diet of
half-truths. For example, Admin
istration spokesmen assure us
that "the University is very sensi
tive to student opinion." But
when the student body makes a
request, it is turned down with a
curt "The University is not a
weather vane." Everyone gives us
reasons, but they're not reasons.
Anti-Seniitism
It's not only Stanfo,rd. At
Princeton the club-rushing season
is the occasion for flagrant anti-
Semitism. In the face of adverse
publicity, the Interclub Commit
tee there recently issued a pious
statement saying that it disap

proved of discrimination on moral
grounds; the president of the uni
versity happily agreed. •
The president said that discrim
ination at Princeton was "greatly
exaggerated, but this statement
should help redress the balance
in that regard." This beast never
existed, and we killed it!
Whenever some of us try to ef
fect changes at, our own Univer
sity. we are stymied by hypocrisy
in high places.
When faculty and students ad
vocated that the University use
achievement tests in screening its
applicants, the Administration
agreed, as it usually does. But
nothing happened because, as
they insisted, "academic changes
take a long time."
We suggested that the Univer
sity invite Dr. J. Robert Oppen
heimer to speak at our commence
ment. The reply: "Graduation is
no time to flex our academic free
dom muscles."
We would like to \believe what
we are told, but how can. we? We
can spdt a facade, but we can't
see behind it. We can analyze,
but few of us can act.
Speaker: In the first place, you
can't expect to believe in anything
completely. You know a lot about
what is wrong; go ahead and try
to fix it.
Spoiled Generation
Your generation is spoiled. You
tire too easily. You can't expect
to know how to take big steps
until you've practiced by taking
little ones.
It took 30 years and two world
wars to establish the United Na
tions. Are you going to let it fail?
A strengthened UN is our only
hope, but you won't get it from
the suburbs. Some of you must
go out and work for it. We must
find out more about our and
our enemies.

Why don't you join the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union and help
open up travel to China?
Demonstrate against the hydro
gen bomb. If we are to have ef
fective control, you must de
mand it.
Where to lteyin?
Where should you begin if you
want to improve your University,
or your Government? Power usu
ally resides at the top. If you get
nowhere with a secretary, go to
the vice-president. If the vice
president is an ass, see the presi
dent.
It is only men who make the
decisions; it i« only men with
whom you must deal. Few of my
generation justify their actions
simply by saying, "It's always
been done this way." Some of us
try to be reasonable. Keep after
us if you believe our reasons are
faulty. Some of us find it easier
to lie. Expose us!
Don't be afraid to praise or to
blame. If you do this, people will
dislike you. But you must work
for what you believe is right.
Be immoderate sometimes, and
expect to make mistakes. How
else will you learn? You are so
phisticated and intelligent. You
claim a hatred for hypocrisy. You
are realistic enough to see prob
lems in all their complexities.
This is to your advantage if you
do not yield to the conviction thai
there is nothing you can do.
You've graduated; now go to
wdrk! The future of mankind will
depend upon your imagination
and gut«.
