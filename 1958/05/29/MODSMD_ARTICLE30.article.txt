# Sibley Given Memorial Book Fund by Students
## 
### 
Professor Mulford Q. Sibley
was presented last night with a
memorial fund for the purchase
of books for West Memorial Po
litical Science Library.
The fund of $304 was given to
Sibley during the annual banquet
for Pi Sigma Alpha, the national
political science honorary society.
Sibley gave the major address
which was entitled "Political
Progress: Real or Imaginary?"
Collected quietly among the
friends and students of Sibley,
the fund came as a surprise to
him. It was presented by gradu
ate student William McCraw "in
appreciation to you and as a me
morial to carry on your influence
here."
Money for Books
The money will be used to buy
books which have been selected
by Sibley and each book selected
will bear an identifying label.
The signatures of the subscrib
ers to the fund were also present
ed to Sibley in a memorial which
read, "Presented to Mulford Q.
Sibley with appreciation and af
fection from his students and
friends at Stanford University,
1957-58. A teacher affects eter
nity: he cannot tell where his in
fluence ends."
McCraw also said that the fund
would remain open until the end
of the quarter and that those who
still wish to contribute may do so
in the office of the Political Sci
ence Department. Contributions
may also be mailed.
