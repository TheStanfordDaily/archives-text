Cleaning Oul the Notebook
Scorns like the sports year should only be about half over, but
here il is the end of the line, wiih only a few more national champion
ship meets left* to go. That and the fact that today's Daily is the last
of the year means it's time for the last column not one of those
xickeningly. sentimental things, but just the product of cleaning out
the notebook and column files box.
First, a gripe about the FCC and NCAA track championships;
more specifically, a complaint about the 220-yard low hurdles. Why
run the race around a curve? I'CC says they did it because NCAA
does. Then the buck passes to what is called the "Olympic Formula,"
which specifies one turn for the 220 and two for the 440. But since
when are the 220 lows being r un in the Olympics?
.Running them around a curve makes for an unfair race. The
man running on the far outside gets to approach his hurdles at a
far better angle than the man who has to run the sharper curves on
the inside of the track.
Hut the man on the inside has a huge advantage over everybody
else because he can take full advantage of body lean running on the
curve. A man running a curve naturally leans in as he runs. He
also runs in the left side of his lane to gain full benefit from his
staggered start.
But a -hurdler in any lane except one, if he leans and runs on the
left side of his lane, is going to clobber the hurdle in the lane to his
left, as simple geometry will prove. But the man in lane one—no
extra barriers for him.
Willie White of Cal was unquestionably the best low hurdler in
the I'CC field. And he can also run a curve, as he's often demon
strated in a flat 220. But the hurdles on the curve fouled him up, and
the best man ran sixlh.
Let's get the things back on the straightaway where they belong,
and where they're run 99 per cent of the time.
Tribute to Holding
The baseball barbecue at Adrian Stickney's Atherton home last
weekend was quite an event. The awards were especially interesting
particularly the Bush Award bestowed on King Bob Cole. One new
award, presented by 1 he alumni of the team of '36, was impressively
worded "To the player who consistently has displayed the best atti
tude toward improving his ability and contributing his best to the
team a< all times, this award is made to ltalph Holding."

Most year-end awards go either to team events or consistently
good playing. But Stanford also had plenty of individual one-game
achievements, both from the men who were good all year and from
those who didn't get to play or star all the time.
Al Shaw's two Sunken Diamond home runs in a seven-inning
game aaginst UCLA were especially noteworthy—he was only the
second man in Stanford history to knock two out of the park in one
contest:. And he even drove another deep fly to left besides being
intentionally walked twice by cautious Bruin hurlers.
All the track records set this year were thrillers, but Norm Lloyd's
1:49.2 in the tight 880 with Occidental could hardly be topped. Un
less it was by underdog Lrnie Cunliffe's tremendous hall-mile vic
tory over Don Bowden in the Big Meet. It was the lirst half lhat
Bowden ever lost.
Throw in Robin Moore's triple PCC win, fleorge Harrison's na
tional frosh records, Mike Tipton's sometimes-spectacular play as
a basketball sub, and it all adds up to a taste of what happened
individually in the past year.
* * *
Three months to rest now, and then we can all come back to see
a Rose Bowl football team (four of the last five new coaches weirt
their first year), a PCC championship basketball team (if it plays
like the last four games of '58), a track team that beats USC (il
another great crop of sophs comes along), and a CIBA championship
baseball team (if the hitters and pitchers get together).
Oh well, we can always hope.
