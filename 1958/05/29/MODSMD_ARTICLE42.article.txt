# Daily Chooses Douglas '57- 58 Athlete of Year
## 
### John Schwarz 
The 19;"j7-58 sport scene at Stan
ford produced many top athletes
to add to the long list of previous
Stanford greats. Topping this
year's competitors is a 21-year
old, 5-foot 10-inch senior from
Santa Monica, Jon Alexander
Douglas.
"Jack" Douglas, probably one of
Stanford's greatest two-sport men
in history, certainly ranks with
such Stanford g feat a as Ted
Srhroeder, George Yardlcy, John
Brodie, Frankio Albert and many
more.
For two years Douglas had to
sit on the bench behind Brodie,
but finally in his senior year he
took over the varsity quarterback
reins and proved himself a great
field leaden and a talented foot
ball player.
Always Fascinating
To the Stanford football fan
Douglas always was a fascinating
athlete to watch.
Most fans who saw him in the
warm-up drills couldn't figure out
what this 167-pounder was doing
among tire giant 200 • pounders.
But. once the game began, and
Douglas started to run option
plays around one side and the
other, throw jump passes, throw
long passes, or just work a tricky
hand-off, one .never doubted his
presence on the field.
Led West Victory
All season long Douglas turned
an excellent job at the quarter
back .spot for Stanford. When the
season was over Douglas followed
in the footsteps of previous In
d i a n field generals Brodie and
Bobby Garrett and led the West
squad to a victory over the East
erners in the annual Shrine game.
In the springtime one always
found Douglas down at the tennis
courts pound in g his smooth
ground strokes back across the
net. Jack is one of Stanford's all
time great tennis stars and was
in one of the top two positions on
the team all three of his varsity
years.
One of the outstanding attri
butes of Douglas the tennis player

is his topnotch form and spar
kling speed. lie carries a lot of
his football spirit over to his ten
nis game—which is always evi
dent in his tremendous desire to
win.
Besides being a topnotch per
former on the field, Douglas also
put on a fine show off the field
and in the classroom. Last week
the Card ace was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa — which leaves one
with nothing further to say about
his academic ability.
Plenty of Reasons
It is for these reasons—plus nu
merous others too plentiful to
print—that the Daily sports staff
has chosen Jack Douglas as Stan
ford's Athlete of the Year.
Besides Douglas, there have
been many other athletes who per
formed very ably this year. Seven
have been selected by The Daily
as most valuable in their major
sport.
In football Douglas got the nod
for his efficient job at quarter
back.
In basketball junior Dick Ilaga
was selected, but had a close race
with several other candidates. The
closeness of the voting was a good
indication of what kind of a team
i this year's squad was. There was
no one outstanding individual, but
a well-balanced team. Haga cop
ped the award for the top job he
did as a rebounder and a center
against consistently taller foes.
A 1 Shaw was the unanimous
pick in baseball. Shaw, scrappy
senior second - baseman of this
year's Indians, led the team in six
major hitting departments and
put on a good show at second all
season. He finished the campaign
hitting at a .321 clip and hit five
circuit clouts. On one afternoon
Shaw pulled the phenomenal feat
of hitting two blasts put of the
Sunken Diamond.
Close in Track
Track presented somewhat of a
problem with -such top individual
performers as Chuck Cobb. Norm
Lloyd and Dean Smith. The final
selection was given to sophomore
Smith, who has turned in the
most consistent performances all

year. There was never a day when
Smith didn't eome through as ex
pected, and several times (such as
the PCC meet) he surprised with
unexpected performances. Cobb
and Lloyd had some outstanding
performances 'of their own, hut:
neither was as consistent as
Smith, although Cobb was ham
pered greatly by a midseason
pneumonia attack.
Dave Nelson, like Smith, showed
the greatest consistency in his
sport—tennis. Nelson, a junior,
never let down all year and sur
prised many with his rapid im
provement. By midseason lie had
the reputation of being the Pacific
Coast's big upsetter. In two team
losses to USC, Nelson was able to
regain some honor for Stanford
by winning both his matches. In
the recent PCC tourney Nelson
was the only conference netter to
take a set off Alex Olmedo; and,
although Douglas is still probably
Stanford's best netter, Nelson's
consistency gains him the nod as
the MVP.
Seanor in Golf
Bill Seanor has been right on
top of the golf ladder all year
long and on various occasions this
year has carded excellent scores.
He led the team to a fine northevn
California season and is this
year's most valuable golfer.
From Stanford's PCC Confer
ence swimming champs, the very
versatile Robin Moore is the unan
imous MVP pick. Moore was coach
Tom Haynie's No. 1 handyman—
and a top handyman at that. He
came through in the clutch with
a triple gold medal winning per
formance in this yea r's PCC
Championships and all year pro*
duced winning efforts for the
tankmen.

Smith didn't eome through as ex
pected, and several times (such as
the PCC meet) he surprised with
unexpected performances. Cobb
and Lloyd had some outstanding
performances 'of their own, hut:
neither was as consistent as
Smith, although Cobb was ham
pered greatly by a midseason
pneumonia attack.
Dave Nelson, like Smith, showed
the greatest consistency in his
sport—tennis. Nelson, a junior,
never let down all year and sur
prised many with his rapid im
provement. By midseason lie had
the reputation of being the Pacific
Coast's big upsetter. In two team
losses to USC, Nelson was able to
regain some honor for Stanford
by winning both his matches. In
the recent PCC tourney Nelson
was the only conference netter to
take a set off Alex Olmedo; and,
although Douglas is still probably
Stanford's best netter, Nelson's
consistency gains him the nod as
the MVP.
Seanor in Golf
Bill Seanor has been right on
top of the golf ladder all year
long and on various occasions this
year has carded excellent scores.
He led the team to a fine northevn
California season and is this
year's most valuable golfer.
From Stanford's PCC Confer
ence swimming champs, the very
versatile Robin Moore is the unan
imous MVP pick. Moore was coach
Tom Haynie's No. 1 handyman—
and a top handyman at that. He
came through in the clutch with
a triple gold medal winning per
formance in this yea r's PCC
Championships and all year pro*
duced winning efforts for the
tankmen.

The 19;"j7-58 sport scene at Stan
ford produced many top athletes
to add to the long list of previous
Stanford greats. Topping this
year's competitors is a 21-year
old, 5-foot 10-inch senior from
Santa Monica, Jon Alexander
Douglas.
"Jack" Douglas, probably one of
Stanford's greatest two-sport men
in history, certainly ranks with
such Stanford g feat a as Ted
Srhroeder, George Yardlcy, John
Brodie, Frankio Albert and many
more.
For two years Douglas had to
sit on the bench behind Brodie,
but finally in his senior year he
took over the varsity quarterback
reins and proved himself a great
field leaden and a talented foot
ball player.
Always Fascinating
To the Stanford football fan
Douglas always was a fascinating
athlete to watch.
Most fans who saw him in the
warm-up drills couldn't figure out
what this 167-pounder was doing
among tire giant 200 • pounders.
But. once the game began, and
Douglas started to run option
plays around one side and the
other, throw jump passes, throw
long passes, or just work a tricky
hand-off, one .never doubted his
presence on the field.
Led West Victory
All season long Douglas turned
an excellent job at the quarter
back .spot for Stanford. When the
season was over Douglas followed
in the footsteps of previous In
d i a n field generals Brodie and
Bobby Garrett and led the West
squad to a victory over the East
erners in the annual Shrine game.
In the springtime one always
found Douglas down at the tennis
courts pound in g his smooth
ground strokes back across the
net. Jack is one of Stanford's all
time great tennis stars and was
in one of the top two positions on
the team all three of his varsity
years.
One of the outstanding attri
butes of Douglas the tennis player

is his topnotch form and spar
kling speed. lie carries a lot of
his football spirit over to his ten
nis game—which is always evi
dent in his tremendous desire to
win.
Besides being a topnotch per
former on the field, Douglas also
put on a fine show off the field
and in the classroom. Last week
the Card ace was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa — which leaves one
with nothing further to say about
his academic ability.
Plenty of Reasons
It is for these reasons—plus nu
merous others too plentiful to
print—that the Daily sports staff
has chosen Jack Douglas as Stan
ford's Athlete of the Year.
Besides Douglas, there have
been many other athletes who per
formed very ably this year. Seven
have been selected by The Daily
as most valuable in their major
sport.
In football Douglas got the nod
for his efficient job at quarter
back.
In basketball junior Dick Ilaga
was selected, but had a close race
with several other candidates. The
closeness of the voting was a good
indication of what kind of a team
i this year's squad was. There was
no one outstanding individual, but
a well-balanced team. Haga cop
ped the award for the top job he
did as a rebounder and a center
against consistently taller foes.
A 1 Shaw was the unanimous
pick in baseball. Shaw, scrappy
senior second - baseman of this
year's Indians, led the team in six
major hitting departments and
put on a good show at second all
season. He finished the campaign
hitting at a .321 clip and hit five
circuit clouts. On one afternoon
Shaw pulled the phenomenal feat
of hitting two blasts put of the
Sunken Diamond.
Close in Track
Track presented somewhat of a
problem with -such top individual
performers as Chuck Cobb. Norm
Lloyd and Dean Smith. The final
selection was given to sophomore
Smith, who has turned in the
most consistent performances all

year. There was never a day when
Smith didn't eome through as ex
pected, and several times (such as
the PCC meet) he surprised with
unexpected performances. Cobb

Beta Kappa — which leaves one
with nothing further to say about
his academic ability.
Plenty of Reasons
It is for these reasons—plus nu
merous others too plentiful to
print—that the Daily sports staff
has chosen Jack Douglas as Stan
ford's Athlete of the Year.
Besides Douglas, there have
been many other athletes who per
formed very ably this year. Seven
have been selected by The Daily
as most valuable in their major
sport.
In football Douglas got the nod
for his efficient job at quarter
back.
In basketball junior Dick Ilaga
was selected, but had a close race
with several other candidates. The
closeness of the voting was a good
indication of what kind of a team
i this year's squad was. There was
no one outstanding individual, but
a well-balanced team. Haga cop
ped the award for the top job he
did as a rebounder and a center
against consistently taller foes.
A 1 Shaw was the unanimous
pick in baseball. Shaw, scrappy
senior second - baseman of this
year's Indians, led the team in six
major hitting departments and
put on a good show at second all
season. He finished the campaign
hitting at a .321 clip and hit five
circuit clouts. On one afternoon
Shaw pulled the phenomenal feat
of hitting two blasts put of the
Sunken Diamond.
Close in Track
Track presented somewhat of a
problem with -such top individual
performers as Chuck Cobb. Norm
Lloyd and Dean Smith. The final
selection was given to sophomore
Smith, who has turned in the
most consistent performances all

year. There was never a day when
Smith didn't eome through as ex
pected, and several times (such as
the PCC meet) he surprised with
unexpected performances. Cobb
and Lloyd had some outstanding
performances 'of their own, hut:
neither was as consistent as
Smith, although Cobb was ham
pered greatly by a midseason
pneumonia attack.
Dave Nelson, like Smith, showed
the greatest consistency in his
sport—tennis. Nelson, a junior,
never let down all year and sur
prised many with his rapid im
provement. By midseason lie had
the reputation of being the Pacific
Coast's big upsetter. In two team
losses to USC, Nelson was able to
regain some honor for Stanford
by winning both his matches. In
the recent PCC tourney Nelson
was the only conference netter to
take a set off Alex Olmedo; and,
although Douglas is still probably
Stanford's best netter, Nelson's
consistency gains him the nod as
the MVP.
Seanor in Golf
Bill Seanor has been right on
top of the golf ladder all year
long and on various occasions this
year has carded excellent scores.
He led the team to a fine northevn
California season and is this
year's most valuable golfer.
From Stanford's PCC Confer
ence swimming champs, the very
versatile Robin Moore is the unan
imous MVP pick. Moore was coach
Tom Haynie's No. 1 handyman—
and a top handyman at that. He
came through in the clutch with
a triple gold medal winning per
formance in this yea r's PCC
Championships and all year pro*
duced winning efforts for the
tankmen.

The 19;"j7-58 sport scene at Stan
ford produced many top athletes
to add to the long list of previous
Stanford greats. Topping this
year's competitors is a 21-year
old, 5-foot 10-inch senior from
Santa Monica, Jon Alexander
Douglas.
"Jack" Douglas, probably one of
Stanford's greatest two-sport men
in history, certainly ranks with
such Stanford g feat a as Ted
Srhroeder, George Yardlcy, John
Brodie, Frankio Albert and many
more.
For two years Douglas had to
sit on the bench behind Brodie,
but finally in his senior year he
took over the varsity quarterback
reins and proved himself a great
field leaden and a talented foot
ball player.
Always Fascinating
To the Stanford football fan
Douglas always was a fascinating
athlete to watch.
Most fans who saw him in the
warm-up drills couldn't figure out
what this 167-pounder was doing
among tire giant 200 • pounders.
But. once the game began, and
Douglas started to run option
plays around one side and the
other, throw jump passes, throw
long passes, or just work a tricky
hand-off, one .never doubted his
presence on the field.
Led West Victory
All season long Douglas turned
an excellent job at the quarter
back .spot for Stanford. When the
season was over Douglas followed
in the footsteps of previous In
d i a n field generals Brodie and
Bobby Garrett and led the West
squad to a victory over the East
erners in the annual Shrine game.
In the springtime one always
found Douglas down at the tennis
courts pound in g his smooth
ground strokes back across the
net. Jack is one of Stanford's all
time great tennis stars and was
in one of the top two positions on
the team all three of his varsity
years.
One of the outstanding attri
butes of Douglas the tennis player

is his topnotch form and spar
kling speed. lie carries a lot of
his football spirit over to his ten
nis game—which is always evi
dent in his tremendous desire to
win.
Besides being a topnotch per
former on the field, Douglas also
put on a fine show off the field
and in the classroom. Last week
the Card ace was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa — which leaves one
with nothing further to say about
his academic ability.
