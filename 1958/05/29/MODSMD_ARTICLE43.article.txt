# GREAT JOB WITH GREEN CLUB
## Coach of Year Honor Goes to Howie Dallmar 
### 
A team begins the year as an inexperienced, mistake-prone group.
It pulls off one hig upset, but no seniors, three juniors and a fistful
of sophomores just aren't ready to meet and beat consistently good
opponents.
But about two-thirds of the year through the season, the club

starts to look different. It's ac-1
quired confidence, poise and
teamwork. Each man is doing his
job better; the team is winning |
games. And il ends the season ]
with four straight wins over sup
posedly-superior opponents.
Story Behind Story
That was the story of the 1957-
58 Stanford basketball team. But
the story behind the story is one
of how coach Howie Dallmar
stuck with his green team, made
order from disorder, and gave
Stanford a team that, at the end |
of the season, was among the
best in the West.
For his groat job with the
Tribe cagers, The Daily has j
named Dallmar Stanford's coach
of the year for 1957-58.
The 36-year-old Card coach (his !
birthday was last Saturday) is
really only at the half-way point |
of a two-year program.
Everyone Back
With the entire squad return
ing next winter, Dallmar and the ,
team should be able to pick up
where they left off. With an ex
perienced club going from the
I first buzzer, the outlook is for
Stanford to fight it out with
Washington for the PCC cham
pionship.
Dallmar has completed four
seasons of coaching here, but
first gained fame as a star on
Stanford's 19-12 NCAA champion
ship quintet. He .was named
player of the tournament in the
national championship games,
and is a consensus member of
the All-Time Stanford Team.
After a service hitch, Dallmar
played pro basketball with ihc
Philadelphia Warriors, then took
over as head coach at Penn. lie
was.there for six years before
moving to Stanford in 1954.
