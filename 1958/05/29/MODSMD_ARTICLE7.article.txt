# De Gaulle Role in French Government Is Unknown

### 
PARIS, (A 3 ) — General Charles
de Gaulle and the leaders of par
liament met in secret early today
at the direction of President Rene
Coty to seek a way of putting de
Gaulle in power.
Their meeting broke up with
out announced results.
Thousands of demonstrators in
milling Paris street crowds shout
ed anti-Gaullist slogans to empha
size his mass unpopularity.
The dour, hawk - nosed World
War II hero went into a huddle
near midnight with the speakers
of the National Assembly and
Senate to determine whether he
could be made acceptable to par
liament. Then his date with des
tiny was deferred.
Heads for Country
When the meeting broke up de
Gaulle unexpectedly headed back
to his country home, whence he
had come yesterday at Coty's
summons, presumably to head
France's 26th postwar govern
ment.
There was no official announce
ment of the outcome of these
first consultations.
Informed sources said the
speakers—Radical Socialist Gas
ton Monnerville of the Senate and
Socialist Andre le Toquer of the
Assembly—were pessimistic.
No Results
They were reported to have told
Coty they did not expect any re
sults for the moment.
Street demonstrations had
made plain the opposition of a
large segment of the French peo
ple to de Gaulle.
But his many foes in parlia
ment were under pressure to ac
cept him as the only choice in
France's gravest crisis since the
war.
De Gaulle is bidding for power
at the height of a crisis which
Premier Pierre Pflimlin, who pre
sented his resignation early yes
terday, says threatens civil war.
Overcome Opposition
It is up to le Troquer and Mon
nerville to see if they can over
come the normally great parlia
mentary opposition to de Gaulle
and rightist ideas of authorita
rian government.
Meanwhile, in Was hi n g to n,
President Eisenhower broke his
own rule of silence on the French
crisis yesterday and publicly de
clared he liked General de Gaulle.
This personal endorsement of
the central and most controver
sial figure in France's political
turmoil was apparently uninten
tional. It seemed that when con
fronted with a direct question Ei
senhower simply wanted to say
something nice about a wartime
colleague.
In Algeria, the Algerian insur
gents hailed the resignation of
Pflimlin, and predicted de Gaulle
would soon take power.
