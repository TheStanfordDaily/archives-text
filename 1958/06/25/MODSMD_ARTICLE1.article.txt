# Lagunita Court Hosts Reg Hop
## 
### 
The first annual Summer Quarter Registration Dance was held
Monday night, June 23, in Lagunita Court. The dance, which was en
hanced by warm weather and a clear sky, was a stag informal affair
which about 300 students attended.
Mike Erlin, pre-registration chairman, headed the dance commit

tee, assisted by Barbie Baer and
Barbara Norman. Ron Simpson
and his band played for the af
fair, which lasted from 9 until 12.
This event was the first of
many social functions which will
highlight the summer quarter so
cial calendar. Erlin was pleased
with the diversified turn-out for
the dance, and noted especially
the number of graduate students
who attended the function.
It is hoped that this will be
come an annual event for sum
mer students, to serve as yet an
other "get-acquainted" function.
