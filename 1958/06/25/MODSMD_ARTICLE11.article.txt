# R-TV Institute Offers Practice In S.F. Studios
## 
### 
One of the many special pro
grams offered during summer
quarter at Stanford is the Radio-
Television Institute. This year
over 50 students from 11 states,
as well as from Canada and
Switzerland, have registered for
this program.
These 50 students were selected
from hundreds of applicants.
They were chosen because of
their work and interest in broad
casting and telecasting. In their
ranks may be found teachers,
school administrators, and people
already working in the industry.
Many students from Stanford
and other universities who are
still on the graduate or under
graduate level are also in attend
ance.
The Institute is neither purely
academic nor strictly a workshop,
but a combination of the two. On
Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
classes are held on campus, fea
turing lectures by the regular in
structors and guest speakers
from the industry. On Tuesday
and Thursday the students head
for San Francisco and the studios
of KPIX, KQED and KNBC.
Here they are given an opportu
nity to gain practical experience
in radio and television production
techniques.
