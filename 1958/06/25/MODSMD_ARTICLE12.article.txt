This promises to be the busiest
summer quarter we have ever
had at Stanford. Although our
enrollment was larger in the four
or five years immediately follow
ing World War 11, our summer
offerings are considerably richer
now than in that period.
I am glad to extend a most cor
dial welcome to our summer visi
tors, including students and fac
ulty members from other col
leges and universities, and to our
students who have been in resi
dence during the year, as well as
those who are returning from
previous summer quarters. I
hope that all will find their work
stimulating intellectually, and
that they also will find some time
to enjoy the cultural and recrea
tional activities which are a part
of the summer program.
