# How the Other Half Lives ...
## Study Center in Stuttgart Welcomes 63 Farm Students 
### 
On June 17th 63 Stanford stu
dents boarded a chartered flight
bound from San Francisco to their
new campus near Stuttgart, Ger
many, to open the first European
branch of any major American
university. Accompanying the 30
women and 33 men were four fac
ulty advisers headed by Prof. Rob
ert A. Walker of the Political Sci
ence department and general stud
ies adviser.
The Stanford Study Center, as
it is now called, is located on a 30-
acre estate called Landgut Burg,
in the Rems Valley 12 miles out
side Stuttgart. Stanford President
J. E. Wallace Sterling will be with
the students in the converted ba
ronial home, which has been fitted
for dormitory, study lounge and
cafeteria facilities.
The new Stanford campus was
officially dedicated yesterday by
President Sterling before a crowd
of students and German and
American government officials.
Dr. Sterling hopes this extension
of the University's general stud
ies program will make available
to students the opportunity of
"living, studying and traveling
abroad" without interrupting the
usual four-year undergraduate
course.
The curriculum at Stanford-in-
Germany will be the same as that
offered here, but our "other half"
will obviously profit from the Eu
ropean setting for many of their
courses. Intensive courses in Ger
man will be given by German in
structors.
The founding students, headed
by Wally Honeywell and a four
man legislative body, will begin
classes on June 30 and will end
their studies before the Christmas
holidays. They will return here
to The Farm as a new group
heads for the Study Center to
attend winter and spring quar
ters of 1959. The faculty will also
rotate on this twice-a-year basis.

At Landgut Burg the students
and staff will dine together, four
meals a day—European style. The
former estate overlooks the Rems
Valley — renowned for vineyards
surrounding the winding Rems, a
tributary of the Neckar River. It
is near rail connections to Vienna,
Rome, Paris. Switzerland and the
remainder of westei'n Europe.
Presidents of both the nearby
University of Tubingen and a
technical institute have assured
their fullest cooperation in sched
uling visiting lectures and making
facilities available to their new
neighbors.
Prof. F. W. Strothmann, execu
tive head of the University's Mod
ern European Languages depart
ment; Asso. Prof. Kurt Steiner, of
the Political Science department,
and Frederic O. Glover, assistant
to Dr. Sterling, are the faculty
members who are helping to es
tablish the campus.
The big day for our other sum
mer session across the seas was
yesterday, when at 2:30 p.m. Dr.
Sterling opened the dedication
ceremonies with a welcome to rep
resentatives of both German and
American governments in behalf
of the University. The new Cen
ter's resident director, Dr. Peter
Boerner, former assistant director
of the Goethe Museum in Dussel
dorf, presided.
From time to time the Stanford
Weekly will receive communiques
from its reporters in Stuttgart to
keep The Farm informed as to
how "the other half lives."
