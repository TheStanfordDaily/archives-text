ing place.
Dr. Meyer said in an interview,
"This is not a pessimistic talk but
rather a realistic assessment of
the fact that the West will have
to face reorientation in her point
of view." He further added that
the speech was not just for his
torians, but concerned a subject
which should be of interest to ev
eryone today.
"I assume that everyone has
had contact with Western Civili
zation courses," Meyer remarked.
"Well, this is just Western Civili
zation plus, or 'Why take Western
Civ?' "
