						Welcome From The ASSU Officers

### 
On behalf of the Stanford sum
mer quarter legislature, I would
like to extend to all students a
welocme to the Stanford campus.
The experience of a summer at
Stanford is one which should be
enjoyed by all students, as it af
fords an unusual opportunity to
met and know many types of peo
ple with many interests.
It is the responsibility of the
legislature to provide social ac
tivities for all types of students.
This job, which will provide en
joyment as well as a challenge,
can only be accomplished through
the active interest and participa
tion of representatives on the leg
islature. These representatives,
from the living areas and the var
ious colleges within the Univer
sity, will be selected on Wednes
day and Thursday afternoons,
June 25 and 20, through tryouts.
I would like to urge all students
to apply for a legislature position,
thus affording a better over-all
representation in planning events.
We will welcome the opinions and
suggestions of interested ex-offi
cio members and other students.
We are pleased with the great
enrollment this summer, and
hope that we can serve you in a
constructive and enjoyable way.
