# Campus Reception At Bowman This Afternoon
## 
### 
A "get-acquainted" reception for
all Stanford summer quarter stu
dents will be held this afternoon
at Bowman Alumni House from 4
to 5:30 p.m. This reception, which
will be hosted by the summer
Legislature, is an informal affair
to which all faculty and students
are invited.
Chairman T. Richard Sandke
has announced that all visiting
professors and department heads
have been invited, thus affording
a chance for faculty and students
to meet on a casual basis.
The reception will be held on
the shaded patio behind Bowman,
and casual clothes and cool re
freshments should help combat
the June heat.
Greeting the guests will be John
Phelps, student-body president;
Claire Nemoede, ASSU vice-presi
dent; Mike Erlen, pre-registration
chairman; Paul Archambeault,
open-house chairman; and recep
tion chairman Sandke.
Sandke remarked, "We want to
especially invite off-campus, grad
uate and foreign students to this
reception."
