# Legislature Hears Dean
## 
### 
The first meeting of the Stan
fo r d Summer Legislature was
held last Saturday evening in the
women's gym. Student-body pres
ident John Phelps and vice-presi
dent Claire Nemoede presided.
This nucleus of the Summer
Legislature heard reports on pre
registration plans, the forthcom
ing open houses-at Bowman and
Lagunita Court and a report on
the Summer Weekly.
Special guest at the meeting
was H. Donald Winhigler, dean of
students. Dean Winhigler told the
Legislature lhat an increase of
400 students was expected over
last summer's enrollment of 2364.
He noted that, as usual, not all of
these students will be full-time,
matriculated persons.
Winhigler noted the increasing
number of special workshops and
conferences which are drawing
men and women to Stanford this
summer. It was also remarked
that the enrollment has increased
astronomically when the fact is
taken into consideration that this
is the first summer there are no
freshmen.
The question of the purpose
and value of summer quarter was
proposed to Dean Winhigler. In
answering, he stressed the dual
nature of the program. It is meant
to be a fourth quarter for those
students regularly enrolled at the
University as well as a place for
visitors to come and enjoy any
special programs that are offered.
Dean Winhigler further remark
ed that summer session at Stan
ford is unusual in another way:
it is the only time during the year
that the "center of gravity shifts
from History Corner to the Edu
cation Department."
