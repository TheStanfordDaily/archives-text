# â€˜In Love and War,' New Fox Film, Features Stanford Theme, Setting
## 
### 
The Stanford campus was
turned into a movie set on Satur
day, June 28, as 57 students par
ticipated in the filming of scenes
for "In Love and War," a 20th
Century Fox production. The
movie, filmed in Cinemascope and
Technicolor, stars Bradford Dill
man, Jeffrey Hunter, Robert Wag
ner, Hope Lang, Sheree North,
France Nyen and Dona Winter.
Dillman and Miss Nuyen took part
in the shooting on Saturday.
"In Love and War," adapted
from"The Big War" by Anton
Myrer, is the story of three Ma
rines during World War II and
how the war affects their lives,
their loves, and their points of
view. Dillman plays the part of a
Stanford student, torn by con
flicting material and intellectual
desires. As Alan Newcomb, a phi
losophy student at the University
in the early 40's, he is drafted and
sent to the South Pacific. Accord
ing to Dillman, the role is built
around the idea of "intellect and
conscience trying to find some
meaning in the war." Influenced
by a materialistic father and an
intellectually driven philosophy
teacher, Alan Newcomb makes a
transition in his thinking during
the story. He is wounded while
overseas and sent to a hospital in
San Francisco where he meets an
Hawaiian nurse, Kalai Ducanne,
played by Miss Nuyen.
His two friends in the Marines
are played by Wagner and Hunter.
Wagner is cast as an Irish boy
from San Francisco, an essentially
weak person, who goes to fight in
order to prove himself.
Hunter, the son of a Monterey
fisherman, is a professional Ma
rine. His marriage to Hope Lang
highlights the story, as does Wag
ner's romance with Sheree North.
Producer, Director Named
The screen play was written by
Edward Anhalt. who did the sce
nario for "The Young Lions." Di
recting the movie is Phillip Dunn,

tor of "Johnny Belinda," "Mildred

Eugene O'Niell's autobiographical
play.

Four Locations Used
Four locations on the campus
were used in the movie. The first
was in front of Hoover Tower,
followed by seene-s in Memorial
Court, in front of the Main Li
brary and in Inner Quad near the
Political Science department. For
each shooting, nearly all the stu
dent "extras" were employed.
Johnny Graham, unit produc
tion manager in charge of ar
rangements for the movie, said
I hat Stanford was chosen bccause
of its natural beauty and suita
bility for Technicolor photogra
phy.
The movie will be released
around Thanksgiving, according
to John Campbell, 20th Century

Fox publicity director. Campbell
added that this movie is following
the recent trend towards young
actors and ideas which has been
prompted by statistics which show
that 70 per cent of 1he movie audi
ence are people under 25 years of
age. In the movies today there
is a "definite accent on youth,"
Campbell said.
