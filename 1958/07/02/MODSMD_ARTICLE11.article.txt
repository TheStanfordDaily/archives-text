# Excuse Our Dust!

Find yourself tripping over
planks and coming face to face
with giant machinery while walk
ing on the Stanford campus? Has
the roar of the generators and the
jackhammers in front of the li
brary been interfering with your
studying this summer? This is
not a measure to aggravate stu
dents, in spite of what it may ap
pear to be. Stanford is having her
face lifted, and like any beauty
treatment, it is certain that the
end result will make the discom
fort. worthwhile.
The overhaul of Stanford's Me
morial Court arcades, the gate
way to the Inner Quad and Me
morial Church, started Monday,
June 16. and will be completed
by December 16.
Both sides of the arcade were
shored up during the rainy season
with heavy bridge timbers in prep
aration for removal of the roof
tiles and reconstruction of the
roof supports, according to El
dridge T. Spencer, director of plan
ning for the University.
During this summer, two Mathe
matics Department buildings and
the Classics Department will be
remodeled. They will be converted
to two stories and new lighting,
heating and ventilating systems
will be installed.
The projects are part of a con
tinuing University program of
modernization of campus build
ings, so excuse our dust, don't
trip over our beams, and watch
for the improvements which will
be made during the face lifting!
