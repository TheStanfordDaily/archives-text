# Book Rebates Worth Saving
## 
### 
Don't throw away the little or
ange slips of paper which the
Bookstore gives you at the time
of your purchase! They mean
money in your pocket later on.
New students at Stanford may
not be familiar with the rebate
system practiced by the campus
Bookstore.
The practice of giving rebates
for purchases made by students
at the Bookstore allows the stu
dents a share in the profits of the
store.
The rebates are returned on a
percentage basis, according to the
amount spent by the customer
during the year. Return is also
computed from the total volume
of sales registered by the Book
store during the year.
Rebates usually are returned at
the rate of 12 to 20 per cent of the
customers' spending.
The summer student who is
regularly enrolled at Stanford
should save his rebates and add
them to the ones he will gain dur
ing the rest of the year.
Students who are completing a
program at the end of the sum
mer. or are summer-only students,
can receive their rebates in one
of two ways: they may procure
from the Bookstore a rebate re
turn envelope at the end of the
summer and leave the rebates
with the Bookstore; or they may
take the rebates with them and
mail them or turn them in on the
due date, May 1, 1959.
In either case, a stamped self
addressed envelope should be left
if the rebates cannot be picked up
in person. Rebates will be return
ed in June to those students ob
taining them in person, and will
be mailed in the early fall to those
who leave an envelope.
Those not wishing to file for
the rebate should put their re
bates in the charity box, rather
than throw them away.
