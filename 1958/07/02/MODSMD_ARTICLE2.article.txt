# Camera Records A Bit of History

### 
The intricate and complex Cine
mascope camera, filming the
Stanford Memorial Court with a
wide angle lens and in Techni
color, slowly traveled the length
of the entrance to Inner Quad. At
the call of "action," the students
participating in the filming of "In
Love and War" began milling
around as the camera's highly
sensitive eye followed them. The
camera stopped for a moment to
focus on students crossing the en
trance from right to left, and in
doing so rested for a moment on
one of the many plaques which
decorate the sandstone of Uni
versity buildings.
The cameramen were not aware
of the importance of this plaque,
which has become worn and mossy
through the years and was no
doubt unreadable through the lens.
This tablet, unnoticed for the most
part, was erected in 1929 "In
commemoration of the motion
picture research conducted in 1878
and 1879 at the Palo Alto Farm,
now the site of Stanford Univer
sity.
In this experiment at the Farm,
24 cameras with electroshutters
were used to capture photos simu
lating movement as a horse ran
around tlie work ring. As a result
of the test which this plaque hon
ors, steps were taken by John D.
Issacs and Eadweard Muybridge
towards the perfection of the first
movie camera, the grandfather of
today's giant complex Cinema-
Scope equipment.
