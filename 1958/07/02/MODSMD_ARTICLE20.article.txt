# Gallery Shows Childrens' Art
## 
### 
"Large Pictures by Small Chil
dren." one of the most unusual
art shows ever hung at the Stan
ford University Art Gallery, will
be on view through July 14 in its
premiere display.
The title is a literal description
—all the "canvasses" are approxi
mately nine feet square, done on
paper in poster paint by young
sters age 5 through 11 at the Pre
sidio Hill Elementary School, San
Francisco.
The all-school are project is the
idea of Relf B. Case, who attended
Stanford during the war years. As
the school's art teacher, he used
the pre-indoctrination technique in
this project—not to tell the young
sters what to paint. Instead, he
discussed and had the children
learn about the subjects first, and
in many cases visit them.
Out of this came a host of sub
jects pertinent to the child's real
ity—the circus, the gas station,
the grocery store, the family, the
seasons, birthdays and Christmas,
a-3 well as school life.
The Stanford display is the first
appearance off the school grounds.
II will be shown in New York this
fall under the sponsorship of the
American Federation of Artists.
Art gallery hours are Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m. and Sundays 12 to 4 p.m.
The gallery is closed Mondays. Ad
mission is free.
