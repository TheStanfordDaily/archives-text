# Library Receives Book Collections
## 
### 
Several extensive and valuable
collections of manuscripts and
books have been presented to the
Stanford Libraries.
The first is the personal library
of Bertram E. Alanson of San
Francisco, which includes his col
lection of original manuscripts of
W. Somerset Maugham. The
Maugham memorabilia was be
queathed to the University by
Alanson, and now forms the core
of the world's largest Maugham
collection. This exhibition is on
view in the Bender Room of the
Main Library, and will be open to
the public until August 1.
The $150,000 collection contains
manuscripts, first editions, and
association copies of such famous
Maugham stories as "Of Human
Bondage," "Cakes and Ale," "Mrs.
Craddock," "The Moon and Six
pence." "Rain," "The Trembling
of a Leaf," and other major works.
The second collection, compris
ing nearly 5,000 volumes in the
field of general literature, be
longed to the late Judge John Gar
ber, one of the founding fathers
of the city of Berkeley and one of
its first mayors. The gift of a
granddaughter, Mrs. Philip M.
Lansdale of Woodside, Judge Gar
ber's library has an estimated
value of $5,000. Included in the
gift was a lifesize portrait of the
donor and some of the judge's Vic
torian furniture and bric-a-brac.
Approximately 2,000 volumes
are source books, some of which
date back to the year 1800. Among
them are complete sets of the
works of dramatists Beaumont
and Fletcher, now difficult to find,
acording to R. C. Swank, director
of the University libraries.
Among other recent important
gifts to the library are books from
the estate of the late professor
Henry David Gray and from Mrs.
Byra J. Wreden. The Gray collec
tion, containing 711 volumes is
valued at $2,500. It contains many
source books of Elizabethan and
Shakespearean dramas which are
out of print and virtually unob
tainable, library officials said.
Mrs. Wreden's gift of 3,500 vol
umes, although largely in the
fields of physical and natural sci
ence. contains two unusual items
â€”Anatole France's handwritten
lecture notes and Madame de Pom
padour's personal copy of a
French geneological history.
