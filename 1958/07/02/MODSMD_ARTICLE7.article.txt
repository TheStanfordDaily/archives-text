# 300 Attend Open House
## 
### 
Saturday night, June 28, was the date for the annual all-campus
open house held at Lagunita Court. Contrary to information pub
lished in last issue of the Weekly, the dance was stag and strictly
casual, with about 300 people attending.

Name cards were given out at
the door, and guests passed into
the Lagunita courtyard, romanti
cally illuminated by overhead
lights in the trees. Although pre
dominantly an undergraduate af
fair, a great many graduate stu
dents and teachers enjoyed danc
ing under the almost-full moon to
music provided by Ron Simpson
and his band from Palo Alto high
school.
The get-together was scheduled
to begin at 8:30, but did not really
get under way until 9:15. The high
light of the evening was a bonfire
in the middle of the court, with
Simpson's guitarist leading the
folk singing. After the fire had
taken the chill out of the air, the
band played a little jazz, featuring
an electric guitar, and finally
switched to more conventional

dance music for the remainder of
the evening.
Chairman of the event Paul
Archambeault was pleased with
the way students mixed together,
in spite of the ever-present ratio.
He hoped that the turnout for the
open house was indicative of the
interest of the student body in
future dances.
