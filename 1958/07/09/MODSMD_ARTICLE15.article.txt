# How the Other Half Lives...
## Sequoia Tree Marks Dedication Of Stanford-in-Germany Campus 
### 
Latest news as to how our "other half lives" at the Stanford Study
Center in Landgut-Berg, Germany, reveals that the students and
faculty have been busy with dedication ceremonies and orientation
programs.
The following bits of news were gleaned from a letter written by
Fred Glover, assistant to President J. E. Wallace Sterling, describing

publicity arrangements and other
aspects of the dedication June 24
of the Stanford branch campus in
Germany:
"We had things arranged so
that the South German Radio,
Southwest German Radio, Voice
of America. American Forces Net
work. South German TV and Fox
Movietone arrived at slightly stag
gered times—with radio coming
first and TV later. . . . We set up
a press room in the social room—
now officially dubbed the 'Stan
ford Rathskeller' and met the
American and German press
there.
"It began to rain about 1 p.m.
This complicated traffic and han
dling of the people once they had
arrived. Let me add here that the
students were wonderful. They
spent the day before the dedica
tion in a 'Con Home' workday op
eration, turning to with shovels to
put gravel in low places in the
road; weeding; etc.
"The uncertain weather we
have been having ever since the
students arrived eliminated any
hopes of moving the dedication
program outdoors. . . . The dedi
cation itself was held in the lec
ture hall in the administration
building. Dr. Peter Boerner, resi
dent director of Stanford-in-Ger
many, presided, introducing the
mayor of Beutelsbach, the mayor
of Stuttgart and Dr. Wolfgang

Haussman, who represented the
slate president, Gerhard Mueller.
"The speeches were short and
excellent. I was particularly
touched by the simple dignity and
poise of Herman Plessing. mayor
of Beutelsbach. He spoke of the
local people's affection for this
beautiful and friendly community
and suggests that village life of
fers much that is unique."
In the text of President Ster
ling's speech, sent along with
Glover's letter, Sterling concludes
with the following remark: "So
I conclude by repeating our grati
tude to all of you who have made
us so very welcome, by assuring
you of our pleasure in being here
and by expresisng the high hope
that this undertaking will forge
new bonds of affection and com
mon purpose between Stanford
University in California and Bad
en-Wuerttemberg in Germany."
The ceremonies were officially
ended when Dr. Sterling and Wal
iy Honeywell, Stanford-in-Germa
ny ASSU president, planted a
small redwood tree on the lawn
adjoining the administration
building. Students sang the Stan
ford Hymn, and Dr. Sterling con
cluded with the remark that he
hoped the tree, in its long life,
would be a symbol of the sturdi
ness of Stanford's program there.
Glover's letter adds that life is
now falling into a normal routine
at our "other half." He wrote,
"This looks to be a most promis
ing undertaking, and I can echo
the official speeches at the dedi
cation in forecasting a wonderful
experience for all who participate
in Stanford-in-Germany."

students were wonderful. They
spent the day before the dedica

put gravel in low places in the

"The uncertain weather we
have been having ever since the
students arrived eliminated any
hopes of moving the dedication
program outdoors. . . . The dedi

mayor of Beutelsbach, the mayor
of Stuttgart and Dr. Wolfgang

Haussman, who represented the
slate president, Gerhard Mueller.
"The speeches were short and
excellent. I was particularly
touched by the simple dignity and
poise of Herman Plessing. mayor
of Beutelsbach. He spoke of the
local people's affection for this
beautiful and friendly community
and suggests that village life of
fers much that is unique."
In the text of President Ster

Glover's letter, Sterling concludes
with the following remark: "So
I conclude by repeating our grati
tude to all of you who have made
us so very welcome, by assuring
you of our pleasure in being here
and by expresisng the high hope
that this undertaking will forge
new bonds of affection and com
mon purpose between Stanford
University in California and Bad

The ceremonies were officially
ended when Dr. Sterling and Wal

adjoining the administration
building. Students sang the Stan
ford Hymn, and Dr. Sterling con
cluded with the remark that he
hoped the tree, in its long life,
would be a symbol of the sturdi
ness of Stanford's program there.
Glover's letter adds that life is
now falling into a normal routine
at our "other half." He wrote,
"This looks to be a most promis
ing undertaking, and I can echo
the official speeches at the dedi

experience for all who participate
in Stanford-in-Germany."
