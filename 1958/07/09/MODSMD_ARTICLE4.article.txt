Josh White, famous American
folk singer, will appear at Stan

Trained in the South under the
surveillance of men like Blind Joe
Taggert, the immortal guitarist
and street singer, White's fame
began to ascend in the 1940'5. His
personal appearance tours began

White dedicated his famous song
"The Man Who Couldn't Walk
Around" to him.
In 1950 Eleanor Roosevelt took
Josh as her protege on a concert
tour of Europe. In England, Nor
way, Sweden, Denmark and Scot
land, he sang to sell-out crowds.
Fifty thousand people showed up
for one concert in Stockholm. At
an ambassador's party in Copen
hagen, even the King of Denmark
sat on the floor and joined in sing
ing spirituals. In England Prin
cess Margaret asked Josh to sing.
His scholarly research into the
origin and development of many
folk songs was rewarded with an
honorary Doctor of Folklore de
gree from Fisk University, Ten
nessee.
