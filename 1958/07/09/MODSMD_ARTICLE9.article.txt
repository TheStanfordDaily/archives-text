# Cubberley Conference Will Conclude 2-Day Talks Today
## 
### 
Nearly 300 high school teachers and administrators from all over
the United Slates have gathered on the Stanford campus to discuss
"New Directions for the American High School" at the Cubberley
Lecture and Conference.
The opening session was conducted in conjunction with the Tues
day Evening Series last night, at which Paul Witty, professor of

education at Northwestern Uni
versity, discussed "The Gifted
Student in the American High
School." Dean I. James Quillen of
the Stanford School of Education
extended an official welcome at
that time.
Today four more general ses
sions as well as general discussion
groups are on the agenda.
Opening at 9 a.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium will be Lloyd Michael,
superintendent of Evanston High
School, Evanston, 111., on "New Di
rections for the High School Cur
riculum." Chairman is Norman
B. S c h a r er, superintendent of
schools, Santa Barbara County.
The 2 p.m. session this after
noon in Cubberley will be address
ed by J. Lloyd Trump, professor
of education at the University of
Illinois and director of the Na
tional Association of Secondary
School Principals commission on
experimental study of secondary
school staff utilization. He will
speak on "New Directions in
Scheduling and Use of Staff in
High Schools."
Trump is a proponent of the
theory of instruction that includes
reducing the class load of teachers
by scheduling groups of approxi
mately 100 students to meet about
120 minutes per week for presen
tation and assimilation of subject
matter in a given class. Accord
ing to Trump, this would allow
more time for teacher and stu
dent to devote to developing an
independent responsibility for
learning.
Chairman of the final general
session at 8 p.m. tonight in Din
kelspiel Auditorium will be Rob
ert N. Bush, Stanford professor
of education and conference co
ordinator.
In addition to summarizing the
conference, Bush will moderate a
panel on high school-college re
lations, consisting of Rixford K.
Snyder, Stanford director of ad
missions; Bernard F. Haley, pro
fessor of economics and member
of the Stanford Admissions Com
mittee; Edward H. Redford, as
sistant superintendent of high
schools for San Francisco City
Schools; and Craig B. Vittetoe,
head of the English Department,
Palo Alto High School.
Discussion groups covering the
English language arts, foreign
languages, health, physical edu
cation and recreation, mathemat
ics, practical arts, science, social
studies, and visual and perform
ing arts will be chaired by mem
bers of the Stanford School of
Education faculty.
