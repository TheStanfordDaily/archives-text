# Guitarist-Singer Josh White At Mem Aud Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
Josh White, versatile guitarist-singer of American traditional folk
songs, will appear tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
White, whose record albums are well known to folk song enthus
asts, began his career in Greenville, North Carolina, acting as a guide
for blind guitar-playing street singers. With them he toured the

South, traveling and learning on
what he now calls "The Glory
Road." He cut his first record at
eleven, playing second guitar with
Blind Joe Taggart in Chicago.
Three years later when he re
turned to his family's home, a
record scout found him and of
fered to send him to New York
for a recording session. There he
recorded spirituals under his own
name, and made several blues rec
ords under the pseudonym "Pine
Wood Tom." These blues records
established his reputation as a
singer.
These records were followed
by radio jobs in New York, but
his career was cut short by an
accident to his right hand. Three
fingers were severely cut, and the
doctors demanded amputation.
Because of his guitar technique,
which employs all the fingers of
his right hand, White refused to
consent to the operation. He took
a job operating an elevator and
slowly nursed his nearly paralyzed
hand back to health. After four
ypars, he landed a part in a Broad
way show, "John Henry," and the
critics applauded his art.
Since then his fame has spread
through night club engagements,
movies and record albums. His
songs of the South became fam
ous, and with "One Meatball" he

made world famous the little man
who had only fifteen cents to
spend for dinner and got no bread
with one meatball. A close friend
ship with the Roosevelts event
ually led to a concert tour in 1950
as the protege of Mrs. Roosevelt.
During this European tour he set
an unusual record in England
when the British Broadcasting
Corporation booked him for all
three classes of their radio pro
grams, the Light, Home and Third
Programme.
Tickets for the Josh White con
cert tomorrow evening may be
procured at the Memorial Audi
torium box office for $1 and $1.-

der the auspices of the Committee
on Public Exercises.

These records were followed
by radio jobs in New York, but
his career was cut short by an
accident to his right hand. Three
fingers were severely cut, and the
doctors demanded amputation.
Because of his guitar technique,
which employs all the fingers of
his right hand, White refused to
consent to the operation. He took
a job operating an elevator and
slowly nursed his nearly paralyzed
hand back to health. After four
ypars, he landed a part in a Broad
way show, "John Henry," and the
critics applauded his art.
Since then his fame has spread
through night club engagements,
movies and record albums. His
songs of the South became fam
ous, and with "One Meatball" he

made world famous the little man
who had only fifteen cents to
spend for dinner and got no bread
with one meatball. A close friend
ship with the Roosevelts event
ually led to a concert tour in 1950
as the protege of Mrs. Roosevelt.
During this European tour he set
an unusual record in England
when the British Broadcasting
Corporation booked him for all
three classes of their radio pro
grams, the Light, Home and Third
Programme.
Tickets for the Josh White con

for blind guitar-playing street singers. With them he toured the

South, traveling and learning on

Road." He cut his first record at

recorded spirituals under his own
name, and made several blues rec

established his reputation as a
singer.
