# Three Suspended By Judicial Body
## 
### 
The Judicial Council suspended
three students for Honor Code
violations and acquitted another.
A graduate student was found
guilty of plagiarism and mutilat
ing and stealing library mate
rials. He paraphrased a number
of articles in writing a research
paper without footnoting, al
though he did list those articles
in his bibliography. In addition,
he had cut an article from a
bound volume of magazines. He
was suspended for the rest of the
summer and for fall quarter,
given an "F" in the course, and
was required to pay for replacing
the damaged library materials.
Another student was found
guilty of copying the answers on
a final examination from the per
son next to him. He was given an
"F" in the course and suspended
for fall and winter quarters. The
person from whom he had copied
was acquitted of rendering un
permitted aid.
The third violation occurred in
a course in which final examina
tions are given to different sec
tions at different times. A stu
dent who was not enrolled in the
course went to one of the earlier
sections to procure a copy of the
final for a friend in one of the
later sections. The student was
suspended for three quarters, be
ginning in the summer, and was
placed on probation for the rest of
his University career.
