# 'Atomic Age' Is Hostel Subject
## 
### 
The last hostel of the summer
quarter will tentatively be held
July 27. Featured during the one
day meet will be Jeffery Smith,
humanities professor, discussing
"The Implications of the Atomic
Age." Sign-ups will be posted in
the ASSU office next week, and
the hostel is limited to 15 to 20
students.
Student hostels, now a regular
part of Stanford's academic and
social life, were begun in April,
1956, at a temporary site in the
Santa Cruz Mountains. Since this
time, under the direction of Car
dinals and George Abel, a perma
nent site has been procured.
The philosophy behind the hos
tels centered around the idea of
improving student-faculty rela
tions. Even in a University the
size of Stanford, classes often
times become no more than for
mal lectures and there is lack of
personal contact between student
and teacher. The original work
was done by Abel and Werner
Warmbrunn, foreign student ad
viser, in the hope of bettering
exchange between foreign and
American students as well as al
lowing all students to know the
faculty on a more casual basis.
For two years the hostels have
been conducted by professors
from all departments in the Uni
versity, and have touched on sub
jects from "Sex and Ethics" to
"Extrasensory Perception."
This special summer program
of hostels featured Professor Mul
ford Q. Sibley discussing "The
Formation of Values" on July 12,
and will close with the forthcom
ing hostel on July 27. The sum
mer program is under the direc
tion of Dick Coffing and Abel.
Abel remarked, "We strongly
urge the visiting as well as the
regular Stanford student to take
advantage of this unusual oppor
tunity."
