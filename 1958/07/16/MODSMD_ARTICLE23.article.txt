# Two Small Items Of Great Interest

(Editor's Note: The following
news story was submitted by
Andreas Tiiriik, Stanford stu
dent from Hungary. The article
is a translation of an article in
the June 1 issue of the "Iro
dalmi Ujsag," published by the
Hungarian Literary Gazette,
Ltd., London, England.)
"Among the news items recent
ly arrived from Hungary there
were two which touched us in a
special manner. They deal with
two very small affairs, and one
could say that both are insignifi
cant. The one is that the wives
of the imprisoned Hungarian
writers are denied all job possi
bilities which practically means
that they are sentenced to death
by starvation; the other is that
the Kadar regime maintains near
Szekesfehervar (a city in west
ern Hungary) a concentration
camp for children.
No Jobs for Writers' Wives
"The details of the two news
items sadly fit the reality of a
people's democracy. The wives of
the unlawfully imprisoned writ
ers are free to live in theory, but
not in practice. A high level party
decision was made by which their
getting a "suitable job" would not
be prevented. But in vain do they
go from door to door, nobody
dares to employ them . . ."
The article goes on to state the
instance of the vain attempts of
two of the wives to procure em
ployment in places ranging from
factories to taxicab companies.
At each place they were refused
as being too dangerous. Personal
property confiscation was exe
cuted in respect to their husbands'
belongings, and they have come
to sell their own clothes in order
to live.
Interned Children's Fate
"The fate of the Interned chil
dren gives even more cause to
worry. Youngsters who had par
ticipated in the revolution or who
had returned from the West and
the 10-16-year-old children of the
imprisoned freedom fighters were
locked, 'to be re-educated,' behind
wire fences. The situation of the
child-prisoners is by far worse
than that of the adult prisoners.
Officially these children do not
exist, hence they cannot get food
parcels. Secondly, by a recent
regulation, it is forbidden to phys
ically mistreat a prisoner serving
his sentence; but this does not
apply to the child-prisoners who
need to be re-educated: it is per
mitted, even advised, to give them
a thorough beating several times
a day.
"Publishing the two news
items we do not wish to utter any
ethical judgment of values. This
is superfluous. Even less do we
desire to arouse hateful passions.
This would not serve any purpose.
But we know from experience
that that the world which — be
lievably sensing its own helpless
ness—goes back with a shrug to
its daily routine after witnessing
great tragedies, sometimes reacts
to the minute details of these
tragedies with surprising sensi
tivity. We guess that in the two
matters related above the world
perhaps wants to and maybe evm
can help."
