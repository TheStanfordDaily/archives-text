# ASSU Plans All-Campus Dance Friday, July 25, at Rickey's
## 
### 
In a special session held Saturday, July 12, the ASSU summer
quarter legislature vote'd unanimously to reschedule the forthcom
ing Wilbur Dance to Friday, July 25, at Rickey's Studio Inn in
Palo Alto.

Legislature President John
Phelps called the special meeting
to discuss the alternatives to hold
ing a dance in Wilbur Hall. Due
to the varied inteersts of the stu
dent body this quarter, it was felt
that more interest could be
aroused if the dance were held off
campus. Jeff Commons, ex-offi
cio member from spring quarter,
looked into the possibility of hold
ing the dance at the California
Country Club or at Adobe Creek.
Sara Larson, Lagunita social
chairman, suggested Rickey's as a
possible location, and she and
George Roupe, Crothers social
chairman, gathered information
on this plan.
After about an hour, a coffee
bj'eak was held, with orders be
ing sent for seven black coffees,
one tea, and a goodie (for Harry
Roberts). During the break,
Phelps opened the floor to sug
gestions as to acquiring a new
gavel in place of the old, rather
rusty water closet float used in
previous meetings.
After the break, Legislature
voted affirmatively to hold the
dance at Rickey's. It will be stag
or drag and held on Friday, July
25, so that those interested may
have the use of the Rickey's pool.
Terry Sandke, Wilbur representa
tive, stated that the price would
be $2 for dinner and dance, and
$1 for the dance alone.
Dress for the affair will be
dressy sport for the women (cot
ton dress and heels) and coats
and ties for the men. This "Ren
dezvous at Rickey's," will begin
at 4 p.m. and last until 1 a.m., al
lowing time for plenty of swim
ming, enjoyment of dinner and
leisurely relaxation and dancing.
