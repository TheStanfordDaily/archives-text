# Tresidder Union Plans Final Construction Begins This Fall
## 
### 
Construction is scheduled to start this fall at Stanford on a new
bookstore and post office, two buildings of a proposed nine-building
student activity complex.
Working drawings for the $430,000 bookstore and $186,000 post
office have been ordered by the Board of Trustees from architect John

C. Warnecke.
First building of the activity
center is the Florence Hellman
Dinkelspiel Memorial Audito
rium, an acoustically-perfect mu
sic theater dedicated in May 1957.
Scheduled for the future as
funds permit will be the Tresid
der Memorial Union, which will
be constructed in two phases near
the intersection of Santa Teresa
and Duena Streets. First unit will
be a recreation pavilion and the
second will contain student of
fices.
"The activity center is designed
to focus student life around a
pleasing, functional group of
buildings," said Eldridge T. Spen
cer, University planning director.
"The cultural, student govern
ment, and other participation op
portunities provided will make a
major contribution to the stu
dents' educalional experiences."
All the proposed structures will
carry forward Stanford's tradi
tional architectural themes of red
tile roofs and buff exterior walls.
Construction may be spread over
10 years.
The bookstore will go up on
Lasuen St. next door to the pres
ent bookstore. The post office
will be built next to it, directly
across the street from the pres
ent site.
The existing post office, erect
ed in 1900, will be razed. To make
way for the post office, the Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
house will bo moved to an adjoin
ing vacant lot, until the chapter's
quarters in one of the new frater
nity clusters are ready.
Shortly after the death in Jan
uary 1948 of Stanford's third

president, Dr. Donald B. Tresid
der, the new student activity
center plan began to take shape.
Dr. Tresidder's widow and her
mother established the Tresidder
Memorial Union fund in his mem
ory. With their continuing sup
port, the fund has since risen to
more than $1 million, bolstered
by student assessments, Stanford
Union profits, gifts, and invest
ment income.
Completing the nine - building
project will be the remodeling of
the three buildings around the
Union courtyard and the con
struction of the bookstore annex.
Automobile traffic will be di
verted to Campus Drive, a pe
ripheral road, and the activity
center area will become a land
scaped pedestrian mall.


Tltis is how the new student activity center at
Stanford will look when it is completed in an es
timated 10 years. Construction starts this fall
on the new bookstore (1) and post office (2).
Reading clockwise, other buildings are Dinkel
spiel Auditorium (3), completed in 1957; pro
posed Phase I (4) and Phase II (5) of Tresidder
Memorial Union; remodeled existing Union

buildings (6) and Women's Clubhouse (7); and
proposed bookstore annex (8). All auto traffic
will be routed to peripheral roads and pedestrian
mall will be landscaped by architect Thomas
Church. Architect John C. Warnecke is now
proceeding with working drawings for post of
fice and bookstore. Also shown are engineering
laboratories (9) and Corporation Yard (10).

Shortly after the death in Jan
uary 1948 of Stanford's third

president, Dr. Donald B. Tresid
der, the new student activity
center plan began to take shape.
Dr. Tresidder's widow and her
mother established the Tresidder
Memorial Union fund in his mem
ory. With their continuing sup
port, the fund has since risen to
more than $1 million, bolstered
by student assessments, Stanford
Union profits, gifts, and invest
ment income.
Completing the nine - building
project will be the remodeling of
the three buildings around the
Union courtyard and the con
struction of the bookstore annex.
Automobile traffic will be di
verted to Campus Drive, a pe
ripheral road, and the activity
center area will become a land
scaped pedestrian mall.


Tltis is how the new student activity center at
Stanford will look when it is completed in an es
timated 10 years. Construction starts this fall
on the new bookstore (1) and post office (2).
Reading clockwise, other buildings are Dinkel
spiel Auditorium (3), completed in 1957; pro
posed Phase I (4) and Phase II (5) of Tresidder
Memorial Union; remodeled existing Union

buildings (6) and Women's Clubhouse (7); and
proposed bookstore annex (8). All auto traffic
will be routed to peripheral roads and pedestrian
mall will be landscaped by architect Thomas
Church. Architect John C. Warnecke is now
proceeding with working drawings for post of
fice and bookstore. Also shown are engineering
laboratories (9) and Corporation Yard (10).
Construction is scheduled to start this fall at Stanford on a new
bookstore and post office, two buildings of a proposed nine-building
student activity complex.
Working drawings for the $430,000 bookstore and $186,000 post
office have been ordered by the Board of Trustees from architect John

C. Warnecke.
First building of the activity
center is the Florence Hellman
Dinkelspiel Memorial Audito
rium, an acoustically-perfect mu
sic theater dedicated in May 1957.
Scheduled for the future as
funds permit will be the Tresid
der Memorial Union, which will
be constructed in two phases near
the intersection of Santa Teresa
and Duena Streets. First unit will
be a recreation pavilion and the
second will contain student of
fices.
"The activity center is designed
to focus student life around a
pleasing, functional group of
buildings," said Eldridge T. Spen
cer, University planning director.
"The cultural, student govern
ment, and other participation op
portunities provided will make a
major contribution to the stu
dents' educalional experiences."
All the proposed structures will
carry forward Stanford's tradi
tional architectural themes of red
tile roofs and buff exterior walls.
Construction may be spread over
10 years.
The bookstore will go up on
Lasuen St. next door to the pres
ent bookstore. The post office
will be built next to it, directly
across the street from the pres
ent site.
The existing post office, erect
ed in 1900, will be razed. To make
way for the post office, the Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
house will bo moved to an adjoin
ing vacant lot, until the chapter's
quarters in one of the new frater
nity clusters are ready.
