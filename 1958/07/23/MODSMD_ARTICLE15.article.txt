# The Plight of Mr. Siegfried
## 
### 
This story concerns William
Siegfried. He is not related to the
legendary Siegfried which Mr.
Wagner immortalized, but there
are certain elements of tragedy to
his story which could remind the
reader of the dragon-slayer.
The story begins simply. Wil
liam Siegfried stood quietly in the
bookstore last Wednesday morn
ing, contemplating a purchase.
With him at that time was a dear
friend, but one who has not been
seen since. The friend was Sieg
fried's wallet, and with it went
more than $300 and an Air Force
Officer's "identification card, is
sued by the adjutant general.
William Siegfried lives alone to
day in Crothers Hall, room 222.
He misses his friend. If the wal
let or the contents are seen, please
tell him, or contact Dean I. James
Quillen of the Education Depart
ment. No questions will be asked.
