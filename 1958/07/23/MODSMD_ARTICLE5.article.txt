Ten young Soviet university

They are a part of an interna

the Council on Student Travel,
under which 40 American stu
dents have gone to Russia this
summer.
They will be on the campus
today and stay through Tuesday,
July 29, at the Sigma Nu frater
nity house, 664 San Juan St. They
will be accompanied by a chape
rone-interpreter.
They plan to visit both the
Stanford and University of Cali
fornia campuses, industrial
plants, city halls, community cen
ters, and farms.
The visit by Russian students is
one phase of the Lisle Fellow
ship's summer program.
American members of various
Lisle contingents staying at Stan
ford are studying juvenile courts,
youth detention facilities, hous
ing developments, and other so
ciological aspects of the Penin

rector of student activities at the
University of Michigan.
