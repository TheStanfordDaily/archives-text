# 'Midsummer Night's Dream' Is Lagunita Dance August 9
## 
### 
"Midsummer Night's Dream," the gala Lagunita Court summer
dance, will be held Saturday night, August 9, from 9 to 12 in the
inner court of Lagunita.
Jack Fisher and his orchestra will play for the semi-formal dance,

which will cost 50 cents per
couple. Tickets will be on sale at
Lagunita Court from 11 to 12 a.m.
and from 5 to 6 p.m. each day,
and members of the dance com
mittee will be selling tickets on
campus during the week. Tickets
may be obtained beginning today,
from Sandy Tevis, Kerin von Des
sonneck, Sharon Johnston, Sara
Larson and Carol Blake, or daily
at 11 a.m. in front of the Cellar.
The decorations are quite elab
orate, and in concert with the

theme of the dance. Decorations
chairman is Miss Tevis, and the
publicity and theme idea were
contributed by Diane Rudin.
The girl's must take the initia
tive in securing a date for the
party. In fact, this is what dance
chairman Sharon Johnston has
been trying to do for the last
four weeks. Her picture, and that
of Bill Cottrell, which have been
gracing the front page of the
Weekly, shows the extent to
which some people will go to get
a date for the dance. In a spe
cially recorded taped conversation
overheard between the two, Miss
Johnston was recorded as saying,
"Although to you this may seem
to be much ado about nothing,

I am sure that in this Stanford
hamlet the success of this party
will be as you like it It may re
quire the taming of a shrew to
acquire a date, don't 'wait until
the twelfth night to accept her.
Midsummer Night's Dream is for
each Romeo and Juliet on the
entire campus."
All members of the faculty are
cordially invited as Lagunita's
guests to attend the event pro
vided the dance chairman is no
tified previous to the dance in
order to make proper arrange
ments.
The highlight of the evening
will be the waltz contest, the
trophy for which will be a beauti
ful engraved silver tray, the dona
tion of Miss Tevis. The contest
will be judged by outstanding
campus and faculty celebraties,
yet to be revealed. Arthur Mur
ray was unable to make it.
The purpose of the dance, ac
cording to Miss Johnston, is to
incorporate last year's sophisti
cated dance setting with the pre
vious year's gaiety. Last year's
dance was "Danse Des Pallions",
and the 1956 party was "The Most
Happy Fellow". The evening has
been so planned to make it a
pleasureable event with appeal to
all tastes in rhythm, sound and
color, according to Miss Johnston.
The editor heard her exclaim
as she slipped off the front page,
"Remember, LSMFT â€” Lagunita
Semi - Formal Means Fabulous
Time."
