service in behalf of poets and
poetry.
The Spokane Spokesman-Re
view commented about the vol
ume of poetry, "These verses re
turn to the earlier tradition of
American poetry." The title poem
is printed below.
Who But Tho Earth
When all the pageantry has been
forgot
And cold the tyrant moulds in
deep repose,
None but the earth would shed
upon his plot
A tear of dew from off a scarlet
rose.
A flowered vine to line his grey
retreat,
A grove of fern to fan his tor
tured brow,
An ant hill kingdom laboring at
his feet,
A streamlet there to praise, a tree
to bow.
When all the world forsook and
then forgot
And left its hatred here to curse
his sleep,
Who but the good earth saw he
suffered not,
Who but the earth to bring its
soul and weep?
DUANE MARS DAVIS
