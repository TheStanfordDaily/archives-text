### 
Who'll be first to put a man on
the moon?
Some informed answers to that
query will be offered at Stanford
University Monday and Tuesday,
August 13 and 19, when the west
ern regional meeting of the Amer
ican Astronautical Society holds
its annual session at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The "man on the moon" sympo
sium will be chairmanned by Dr.
Samuel B. Batdorf of the Defense
Department's Advanced Research
Projects Agency, Washington. It
will close the two-day session at
which at least 100 space-flight
technicians, scientists, and engi
neers are expected to be present.
The topics to be discussed at
the symposium include bio-satel
lites and early research, flight
mechanics of a lunar vehicle, en
vironment control, propulsion and
structures, guidance and control,
communication problems, lunar
landing, and earth recovery.
Delegates will be welcomed by
Krafft A. Ehricke, assistant to the
technical director, Convair Astro
nautics.
Some of the provacative papers
to be read include "Some Prob
lems of Round Trip Manned
Flight Outside the Earth's Atmos
phere," "Man's Operational En
vironment in Space," "Satellite
Propulsion Systems," a prelimi
nary report of "Laboratory Ex
periments in Hydromagnetic Pro
pulsion,' "Design Aspects of an
Interplanetary Exploratory Ve
hicle," a preliminary analysis of
"Current Satellite Observations,"
"Maneuverable Satellites," and
"Around the Moon in 80 Hours."
Speakers and panelists repre
sent major U.S. industrial and air
craft firms, the Office of Naval
Research, the Wright Field Aero-
Medical Laboratory, Stanford
University, the University of Cali
fornia, California Institute of
Technology's Jet Propulsion Lab
