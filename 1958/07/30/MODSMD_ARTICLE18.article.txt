### 
Many sports tournaments will
continue to highlight the remain
der of the summer quarter.
The volleyball tournament con
tinues, and both tournaments will
be reaching a climax next week.
At the time of this writing, only
one game for Man's Doubles play
tomorrow can be scheduled in this
column. No mixed games can be
scheduled yet for next Tuesday
because results of the first round
of play are not in.
All winning teams are asked to
watch the bulletin boards at the
Men's Gym and Lagunita Court
for complete schedules. These
will be posted as soon as possible.
Winning teams are also reminded
that they must post game results
on the chart in the Men's Gym.
The single game officially
scheduled from 4:30 p.m. tomor
row at Wilbur is: Read-Hegler vs.
Taggart-Morris.
The prizes for winning teams
are free shakes and burgers at
Kirk's. For any further informa
tion, call Ken Green, DA 3-7469.
Summer Golf Tournament de
termined a winner finally on
Tuesday, July 15. Playing against
what seemed to be insurmount
able odds, before a spectator
crowd of thousands, Ron Emer
zian and Francis Kafka were
pitted against each other in a sud
den death play-off. The tension
mounted as the two sun-helmeted
and bermuda-shorted men stood
poised at the tee-off place. The
cheers rang out as Emerzian
tipped the ball from the tee in fine
form. Kafka followed before the
eyes of the spectators, who knew
then that the game was over, for
Emerzian had won the low net
trophy on the first hole.
The chess tournament continues
to hop along, and the round robin
tournament is now reduced to
two teams. Co-favorites in the
play-offs are Bill Cottrell and A 1
Richardson, and the other team is
Bob Guild and Jeff Commons.
The crucial decision will be
reached in the next two weeks as
these two teams finally meet.
