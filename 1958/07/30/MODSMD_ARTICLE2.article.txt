# Council Revises Honor System
## 
### 
A new interpretation has been
offered to the Stanford Honor
Code, allowing students to report
unfair academic situations to the
student Judicial council in the
same way that violations of the
code are reported.
The Academic Council has ask
ed professors not to repeat sub
stantial portions of examinations
from previous quarters and to
make copies of exams given pre
viously available to students upon
request. They felt that since some
students will always have access
to information regarding old ex
ams, repeating them or refusing
to make copies available to give
information about them creates
an unfair situation.
These or any other unfair situ
ations may be reported by leaving
a message at the Judicial Council
office in the Union or by notify
ing a member of Judicial Coun
cil or the Dean of Students' Of
fice. The Administration will en
courage the professors concerned
to remedy such occurences.
