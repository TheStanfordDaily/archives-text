# AEC Grants New Nuclear Reactor
## 
### 
A grant of $150,000 from the
Atomic Energy Commission will
finance installation of a 10-kilo
watt teaching reactor for nuclear
engineering studies on the Stan
ford University campus, accord
ing to Dean-elect Joseph M. Pet
tit of the School of Engineering.
In addition, $25,000 has been
given by the C. F. Braun Trust
of Alhambra for housing the re
actor and its related facilities.
Stanford's reactor will either be
the "swimming pool" type or
some similar water-moderated
model, Dean Pettit said. It will be
part of the Nuclear Technology
Laboratory located in the Ryan
igh Voltage Laboratory building.
Among other equipment, the
laboratory already has a sub-crit
ical nuclear assembly fueled with
$80,000 worth of uranium loaned
by the AEC. This device does
not sustain a nuclear chain reac
tion, however.
The new teaching reactor not
only will sustain a chain reaction,
but also will provide a neutron
beam. These features will be used
for engineering training and for
various studies in physics and
radiochemistry.
Such reactors have a number
of built-in safeguards to prevent
a "runaway" chain reaction. Al
so, they are so designed that even
if all safeguards were removed
and the reactor ran uncontrolled,
no damage could result except
perhaps to the interior of the re
actor itself.
