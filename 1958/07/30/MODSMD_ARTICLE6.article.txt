# August 2 Hostel Features Smith
## 
### 
Sign-ups will continue the rest
of this week in the ASSU office
for this Saturday's student hostel.
The topic for this final hostel of
summer quarter is "Implications
of the Atomic Age," and will be
discussed by Jeffery Smith of the
Humanities department.
For a fee of $1.50, students will
leave Bowman Alumni House at
8:45 Saturday morning, will spend
the day at the Rivindell hostel
site, and will be back on campus
by 9 p. m.
So far, students have shown
little interest in this unique op
portunity to associate with fac
ulty members on a casual basis,
but George Abel, co-director of
the program, hopes to see the
hostel sign-ups filled.
