AX akm uoicds OF ui i.comk have been extended from all corners"
of llie University to the (llassol 1962. As (lie official publication
of tin* Associated Students ol Stanford University, I lie Stanford
Dailv, 100, would like to extend greetings to you entering fresh*
ineii, Our band (jiies out to you, and Ibe red door of tbe Daily
Sliaek is always open to your visits.
I hrougli tbe Associated IVess teletype service, Ibe Daily
serves tbe campus willi news from all parts of tbe state, nation
ami world. I bis is one of tbe many windows of tbe world open
to Stanford students. Our experience iu working witb off-campus
news is one of tbe reasons we feel keenly about tbe need for
students to take advantage of tbe numerous opportunities for
learning outside of tbe classroom.
You are lure to become educated citizens: everywhere you
turn, during l're-|{cg Week and tbe coming niontbs, you will be
told to apply yourselves to your studies in order to accomplish
your goals. Hut education is not found only in books. You will
lie told this, too, bill il is easy to forget; and in a university where
scholarship competition is al its highest, students tend to bury
themselves in the well-known "Ivory Toyver" of studies. One of
the uiosl difficult tasks of incoming students is to learn to budget
their lime to allow for study and fun in the proper proportions.
We shall not attempt to list here all tbe opportunities for you
to expand your educational horizons beyond tbe classroom —The
Daily will tell von of many opportunities iu its news columns.
Hul Id us urge you to sec floors other than those of the classroom
or study room; to see books other than the textbook; to find out
not only what happened hundreds of years ago, but also what is
happening today. The world is rapidly changing, and the need
to keep up to date on world affairs is great.
This may seem to be a needless caution, but students have
often been known to bury themselves in books for the four years.
u (College days are happy days"—true enough, and not all your
spare lime should be spent in contemplating crises alter crises
which compose the world situation. But four years hence let it
nol be said that you were one to emerge from the sheltered college
arcades to be disillusioned in finding that tbe "cold cruel world"'
can be cold and cruel to those who come upon it unprepared.
Nol only should you look beyond the formal scholarly pursuits,
but also beyond yourselves. Look to your roommates, your class
males, your professors and other friends you will make here.
Stanford draws students, faculty and guests with a wide variety
of backgrounds and talents. Each person on campus has some
thing to offer to you— in your general education, appreciation of
the arts, development of new ideas. They will be willing to share
themselves with vou if you want them to.
And, just as others will be giving of themselves to you, so
should sou also be yvilling to give of yourself. Your ideas will aid
others in their thoughts; \our talents should not lie in the h ack
ground, for it is by expressing yourself through words and deeds
thai vou will find the best channels available for your future
development.
A> President Sterling told you Wednesday night, a great uni
versity is an exciting place to live. The availability of San Fran
cisco culture and life makes Stanford doubly exciting. You can't
do everything offered to von, hut the more excited you become
llie more you will be able to do and the more you will develop
yourseh es.
