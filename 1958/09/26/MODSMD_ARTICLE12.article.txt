No agency can work effectively
without the thoughtful support of
its members. No more can the rep
resentatives of student opinion in
the student body organization hope
themselves to conceive and carry
to completion necessary and con
structive 1 plans for the benefit of
the students. We must depend on
the interest and creativity of all
the students here at Stanford. The
purpose of this column, therefore,
is to make the student body, collec
tively and individually, conscious
of student government, its capa
bilities, mechanics and operation.
Stimulate Interest
When student problems and is
sues arise, moreover, I hope, by
objectively analyzing ihose prob
lems and submitting the facts and
proposed solution to the student
body, to stimulate interest and pro
vide a basis for informed, con
structive suggestions and criti
cism. It is only by tapping your
ideas and utilizing your willing
ness to participate that student
government can work effectively.

| But oven with an informed, in
terested student body and willing
I representatives, unless the stu-
I dents themselves USE their gov
i ernment organization to effectuate
their ideas, there is really little
that it can do. Let me here en
courage all of you to make use of
! your student government to the
fullest extent. It exists as one of
the most effective channels of
| communication between the Ad
i ministration and the students, and
potentially the single most effec
tive avenue of action for student
ideas.
Close Cooperation
Let me also urge you to make
I use of all of your student officers.
I Your class, living group and stu
-1 dent body representatives are all
anxious to do what they can to fur-
I ther student objective-s. The suc
cess of our student government de
! pends upon the close cooperation
l among these representatives, but
; in order for them to make the max
imum contribution to a success
fully functioning student adminis
tration. they must have a sound
knowledge of the wishes of their
constituencies. By expressing
yourselves to them, each of you i
can help.
We at the Associated Students
Office hope that you will not be
hesitant in coming in and offering
us your suggestions. We are look
ing forward to a big year.

government can work effectively.

| But oven with an informed, in
terested student body and willing
I representatives, unless the stu-
I dents themselves USE their gov
i ernment organization to effectuate
their ideas, there is really little
that it can do. Let me here en
courage all of you to make use of
! your student government to the
fullest extent. It exists as one of
the most effective channels of
| communication between the Ad
i ministration and the students, and
potentially the single most effec
tive avenue of action for student
ideas.
Close Cooperation
Let me also urge you to make
I use of all of your student officers.
I Your class, living group and stu
-1 dent body representatives are all
anxious to do what they can to fur-
I ther student objective-s. The suc
cess of our student government de
! pends upon the close cooperation
l among these representatives, but
; in order for them to make the max
imum contribution to a success
fully functioning student adminis
tration. they must have a sound
knowledge of the wishes of their
constituencies. By expressing
yourselves to them, each of you i
can help.
We at the Associated Students
Office hope that you will not be
hesitant in coming in and offering
us your suggestions. We are look
ing forward to a big year.

No agency can work effectively
without the thoughtful support of
its members. No more can the rep
resentatives of student opinion in
the student body organization hope
themselves to conceive and carry
to completion necessary and con
structive 1 plans for the benefit of
the students. We must depend on
the interest and creativity of all
the students here at Stanford. The
purpose of this column, therefore,
is to make the student body, collec
tively and individually, conscious
of student government, its capa
bilities, mechanics and operation.
Stimulate Interest
When student problems and is
sues arise, moreover, I hope, by
objectively analyzing ihose prob
lems and submitting the facts and
proposed solution to the student
body, to stimulate interest and pro
vide a basis for informed, con
structive suggestions and criti
cism. It is only by tapping your
ideas and utilizing your willing
ness to participate that student
government can work effectively.
