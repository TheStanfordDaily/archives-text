# Fund-Raising Kicks Off In $700,000 Campaign
## 
### 
Response "looks very good so
far" to Stanford's 23rd annual
University Fund drive as first
returns have started coming in.
according to the General Secre
tary's Office.
Figures are not yet available.
Goal of the drive is $700,000 to he
raised from more than 50,000
alumni by personal and written
solicitations.
Personal solicitation starts in
mid-October under Lawrence W.
Harris Jr., '32. Both campaigns
are expected to be complete by
Dec. 31.
Last year's response was $607,-
000 with 21.3 per cent of the
alumni contributing.
Sights have been raised this
year in the hope that 24 per cent
of the alumni will give, according
to Gene K. Walker, '28, president
of Stanford Associates.
"The Fund is the base on which
all the University's gift programs
rest." Walker said. "It is Stan
ford's main source of unrestricted
support."
Even though annual tuition has
been raised to $1005, this income
still covers less than 50 per cent
of the cost of a student's educa
tion. drive officials pointed out.
The University provides the
balance from gifts and income
from endowment.
Of 1956-57's $22,000,000 operat

ing expenses, endowment income
accounted for only $2,800,000, or
about 13 per cent.
Income Increased
In a recent talk to a group of
volunteers, business School Dean
Ernest C. Arbuckle, then a trus
tee. explained:
"The increase in tuition from
$750 to $1005 a year will add an
estimated $2,000,000 to Ihe Uni
versity's 1958 59 income.
"Of this amount, 40 per cent
will go into faculty salaries and
additions; 30 per rent is ear
marked for student aid; 25 per
cent is set aside for physical plant
maintenance and improvement,
! and 5 per cent for smaller, mis
! cellaneous items."
Separate Drives
Separate but co-ordinated fund
: drives have been renewed for the
I 1958 year by the Schools of Busi
: ness, Engineering. Law, Medicine,
j and Mineral Sciences.
Also aiding are committees of
non-alumni parents of current
