Expansion of graduate studies
in science and engineering is j
needed to keep United States!
technology abreast of Russia's, I
Provost Frederick E. Terman told j
the Institute of Aeronautical Sci- I
ences at its summer convention.
Terman, a member of the Na
tional Research Council and Ihe
National Academy of Sciences,
hr us h e d aside the "so-called
shortage of engineers."
"In our technological race with
the Russians we depend on those !
with graduate training for lead
ership and creative advances," he
said.
'■Although the Russians outpro
duce us two-to-one in turning out
engineers with the bachelor's de
give, we turn out more Ph.D. en- j
gineers than they do. By keeping ;
our graduate programs strong,
and developing them sti 11 further,
we can lick the Russians where it |
really makes a difference."
About one engineer in five now

goes on to earn a master's degree,
and one in 15 completes the work
for a doctorate. He said this
should be increased to one in
three receiving master's degrees
and one in every five or ten re
ceiving doctorates.
"Industry eagerly seeks men
with advanced training and is
willing to pay a very substantial
premium for them," he said.
