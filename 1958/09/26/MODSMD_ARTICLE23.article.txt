campus.
The following are excerpts
from his remarks:
"May I say a word about Stan
ford University? By European
standards it is young. It was
founded in 1885 by Mr. and Mrs.
Leland Stanford in memory of
their son who died at the age of
16. Mr. Stanford was a distin
guished public servant; he was
governor of the State of Califor
nia and subsequently a senator in
Washington, D.C. He had been a
pioneer in the economic develop
ment of California and had made
a great fortune. When his son
died he and Mrs. Stanford dedi

cated their fortune to the educa
tion of American youth by estab
lishing the University which
bears their son's name.
. . It seems to us that in
coming now to Beutelsbach we
are but extending the educational
opportunities of American youth
in accord with the intent of Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford.
". . . We were attracted to the
larger area of Baden-Wuerttem
berg not only by its beauty but
also by the quality and enterprise
of its industry with much of
which we hope our students will
become acquainted.
. . We were attracted here
also by the great humanistic tra
ditions that constitute a rich part
of your history.

. . So I conclude by repeat
ing our gratitude to all of you
who have made us so very wel
come by assuring you of our
pleasure in being here and by ex
pressing the high hope that this
undertaking will forge new bonds
of affection and common purpose
between Stanford University in
California and Baden - Wuerttem
berg in Germany."
