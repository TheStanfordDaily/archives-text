lIIJST COLUMN, FALL OF 'SS: About two weeks ago it seemed,
to this writer anyway, that September 2r> (our first day of work >
would never come. And now it's here and gone by this reading. All
summer you lliink and observe try to set up the first of these
weekly typewriter sessions. Little notebooks surround you, each one
full of quips from here and thereabouts. You'll start with these, then
make a statement of policy. Every new editor does. Then you'll open
your big, crystal-ball eyes and predict a nine-month future in sports,
Stanford sports, PCX' sports, intramural sports, maybe.
But then the lime comes. You can't wait any longer to let ideas
accumulate, and now's the time to write them out. So you look back
through all the little notes, and half of them are useless now; they're
so old. Half, who're you kidding? Most all.
Taking a second thought you realize that not everyone who reads
this (and you half-heartedly expect that some people will) will not
know about these notes. So you rationalize into the idea that they
don't know about any a 1 all; all of them will be little news gems.
You know it's too late to pick up any more, so these get the dust
wiped off and you're off into another sports season.
HACK INTO SL'MMKR; First note dates way back to days of
conscientiousness in the early summer when you planned to be on
top of the sports-writing game all along. It reads "Curtice at Clin
ics." An extremely popular guy around the coaching world, Jack
Curtice did put in quite a few football clinic appearances this
ciimrvioi' Chin nf 1 hn«p tnnk Him

summer, une 01 mese iook mm
down to Santa Barbara, another
1o Hawaii. He really knows this
(jiinu) <il fool ha 11, he's a top-notch
dinner table philosopher, and he's
one of the most humorous guys
around.
And another point you know
about is former coach, and now
Assistant Director of Athletics,
Chuck Taylor's summer cornp for
kiddies here on the Coast. Hav
ing lived in Ihe same hall (Toyon)
with these fellows for six weeks
you know how much they
thought of having the opportu
nity 10 work with Taylor, Dutch
Fehring, Mickey Holznian, Herm
Meister, Ilowie Dallmar and oth
er members of the Department
of Athletics whom you don't want
to offend by having forgotten
just how many of them did teach
;it the camp. But in your own
way you know how they feel be
cause you work with these people
too, though in another capacity,

and you don't have to be told that they are some of the nicest guys
you'll ever work with.
REALLY A CURSE? And you're laughing at what happened just
aboul a week ago. On the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine the
name "Stanford"—and you're pretty much shook up. Thinking back
you remember that in the past people or teams which SI has featured
have, by some stroke of fate, had lousy seasons following write-ups.
And you remember last year's Sports Editor Dick Barnes' impas
sioned plea to SI to leave us off their cover.
But now that we've laughed at SI, let's compliment them on a
fine story in the current issue. "A Cactus IMant in Stanford's Ivy"
reads the title on a story about new Head Coach Curtice. Well writ
ten, by dames Murray, the story gets into Curtice's philosophy of
what we will see on successive Saturdays out there on the turf. It
rails the Stanford alumni "defeat-conditioned," which is okay by
me, but he forgets to say, early enough, that Stanford still plays a
- real percentage of the Coast's 1 most exciting and colorful ball.
But if you were the sort to let superstition bother you, you'd be
cheered at a few other facts which have about as much import as a
!>!)-yard touchdown run when there's no defensive team on the field.
This year the Indians will be trucaptained. Bob Nicolet, Bob Pe
tersou and Eric ITotiva —to mention names. This year the Indians
have a new coach. Alone these facts don't mean much, but looking
into history: five of the last six Stanford head coaches took their
first squads into Pasadena for New Year celebrations; the last time
the Cards had three captains was in '51, Taylor's first year and a
Rosy year it was! But I'll leave it to you to be the superstitious
kind, I can't see it myself. But just in case, does anyone want to in
vite me to Pasadena for the holidays?
.MORE FROM SUMMER: You don't want to forget some personal
.'i<■(•< mplishments made this summer by Stanfordites and those of
formei years. Ann Quast, golfer from this campus, was a headliner
in sports pages across the nation 1 his summer as she managed to
fop 11 if ■ C.S. National Amateur Women's Golf Championship. You'll
congratulate her but still let her know you're marl because she won't
let you do a feature-length story on her. And ex-QB Jackie Douglas
was a growing figure in the tennis world this summer, on the tour
nament circuit back East. He won the World Tennis (magazine)
"Personality of the Yflar" award. And hopes for a short career in
tennis will keep Douglas from heading back to the Farm this year
for graduate work in law.
. . . Awl Where I) \a Go?
But you can't go on about the past; there is a present and a future
foi you to think about, and maybe even worry about a little. So
you quickly get rid of the present by telling your readers that your
policy, if such a one exists, will be to look around the sports scene
that pertains to the coast college world. You don't really know
much about the national picture, and you don't really care much for
professional baseball, so Major League and World Scries scores are
probably the most they'll get along those lines. But you're open to
requests for more if they should come.
AND THEN TIIIO FUTURE: Now you're up against it pretty
much. You'll make like a predictor and tell them what's in store.
And you'll start by saying you think the Indians will come to life
tomorrow in their home stadium and get the victory for Jokin'
Cacius Jack that they wanted so much last week. Rice is a fine
team, defending champions in the Southvvst Conference, but you
believe the Indians have a potential that came nowhere near mate
rializing up in Pullman last week. Your big complaint with that
game was simply that the Cards didn't have a chance to test the
plays they'll have to use this year.
You could go on to single out individuals on the team but that
has to stop somewhere before you get through the whole roster, and
it's more than fitting to complement the entire team for the work
they've done so far. All through spring, and since September 1
they've been trying their hardest to show us the best. And if they
don't show us a victory, they will show us spirit and some of the
( oast's best ball. And as a group, this is one of the finest groups
on Stanford land. They manage to make a football trip a mighty
enjoyable experience.
So regardless of what may happen you stop to wish them a very
enjoyable (and you hope successful! season. To them, and new Head
Com b Curtice: THE VERY BEST!
FURTHER AHEAD: Skipping lightly over football for the pros
out (you'll be with it for eight plus weeks now) you come to basket
ball and you can't help but notice the gleam in Ilowie Dallmar's
eves. All around you people are whispering "THIS is THE YEAR"
lor the hoopsters. And it'fc pretty hard to sec; any reason why it
houldn't be. Check the starting lineups from last, year, then look
around you to see the faces —they're still here. And they finished in
a blaze last lime around. Note to that secretary again: I think you
can order the blanket of roses. I see the team coming down the
home stretch without much competition in sight.
AND FURTHER YET: There are other sports which should comi
through to make it an all-around successful year for Stanford. Goll
Coach IJud Finger can expect to find some good men out on the link. 1
this year. Swim Mentor Tom llaynie has lost the services of AAU
chump Robin Moore, but his future is brightened considerably by
George Harrison who tinned in some amazing marks as a frosh last
veai Dutch Fehring will have a well-rounded baseball squad return
in/' A few holes yet to be filled, but a long time to fill them. Payton
Jordan starts his third year as track coach and should come up with
another ol his usual fine, well-rounded and exciting squads alone
v ith hit colorful and masterly run nicety.

for graduate work in law.
. . . Awl Where I) \a Go?
But you can't go on about the past; there is a present and a future
foi you to think about, and maybe even worry about a little. So
you quickly get rid of the present by telling your readers that your
policy, if such a one exists, will be to look around the sports scene
that pertains to the coast college world. You don't really know
much about the national picture, and you don't really care much for
professional baseball, so Major League and World Scries scores are
probably the most they'll get along those lines. But you're open to
requests for more if they should come.
AND THEN TIIIO FUTURE: Now you're up against it pretty
much. You'll make like a predictor and tell them what's in store.
And you'll start by saying you think the Indians will come to life
tomorrow in their home stadium and get the victory for Jokin'
Cacius Jack that they wanted so much last week. Rice is a fine
team, defending champions in the Southvvst Conference, but you
believe the Indians have a potential that came nowhere near mate
rializing up in Pullman last week. Your big complaint with that
game was simply that the Cards didn't have a chance to test the
plays they'll have to use this year.
You could go on to single out individuals on the team but that
has to stop somewhere before you get through the whole roster, and
it's more than fitting to complement the entire team for the work
they've done so far. All through spring, and since September 1
they've been trying their hardest to show us the best. And if they
don't show us a victory, they will show us spirit and some of the
( oast's best ball. And as a group, this is one of the finest groups
on Stanford land. They manage to make a football trip a mighty
enjoyable experience.
So regardless of what may happen you stop to wish them a very
enjoyable (and you hope successful! season. To them, and new Head

around you to see the faces —they're still here. And they finished in

can order the blanket of roses. I see the team coming down the

lIIJST COLUMN, FALL OF 'SS: About two weeks ago it seemed,
to this writer anyway, that September 2r> (our first day of work >
would never come. And now it's here and gone by this reading. All
summer you lliink and observe try to set up the first of these
weekly typewriter sessions. Little notebooks surround you, each one
full of quips from here and thereabouts. You'll start with these, then
make a statement of policy. Every new editor does. Then you'll open
your big, crystal-ball eyes and predict a nine-month future in sports,
Stanford sports, PCX' sports, intramural sports, maybe.
But then the lime comes. You can't wait any longer to let ideas
accumulate, and now's the time to write them out. So you look back
through all the little notes, and half of them are useless now; they're
so old. Half, who're you kidding? Most all.
Taking a second thought you realize that not everyone who reads
this (and you half-heartedly expect that some people will) will not
know about these notes. So you rationalize into the idea that they
don't know about any a 1 all; all of them will be little news gems.
You know it's too late to pick up any more, so these get the dust
wiped off and you're off into another sports season.
HACK INTO SL'MMKR; First note dates way back to days of
conscientiousness in the early summer when you planned to be on
top of the sports-writing game all along. It reads "Curtice at Clin
ics." An extremely popular guy around the coaching world, Jack
Curtice did put in quite a few football clinic appearances this
ciimrvioi' Chin nf 1 hn«p tnnk Him

summer, une 01 mese iook mm
down to Santa Barbara, another
1o Hawaii. He really knows this
(jiinu) <il fool ha 11, he's a top-notch
dinner table philosopher, and he's
one of the most humorous guys
around.
And another point you know
about is former coach, and now
Assistant Director of Athletics,
Chuck Taylor's summer cornp for
kiddies here on the Coast. Hav
ing lived in Ihe same hall (Toyon)
with these fellows for six weeks
you know how much they
thought of having the opportu
nity 10 work with Taylor, Dutch
Fehring, Mickey Holznian, Herm
Meister, Ilowie Dallmar and oth
er members of the Department
of Athletics whom you don't want
to offend by having forgotten
just how many of them did teach
;it the camp. But in your own
way you know how they feel be
cause you work with these people
too, though in another capacity,

and you don't have to be told that they are some of the nicest guys
you'll ever work with.
REALLY A CURSE? And you're laughing at what happened just
aboul a week ago. On the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine the
name "Stanford"—and you're pretty much shook up. Thinking back
you remember that in the past people or teams which SI has featured
have, by some stroke of fate, had lousy seasons following write-ups.
And you remember last year's Sports Editor Dick Barnes' impas
sioned plea to SI to leave us off their cover.
But now that we've laughed at SI, let's compliment them on a
fine story in the current issue. "A Cactus IMant in Stanford's Ivy"
reads the title on a story about new Head Coach Curtice. Well writ
ten, by dames Murray, the story gets into Curtice's philosophy of
what we will see on successive Saturdays out there on the turf. It
rails the Stanford alumni "defeat-conditioned," which is okay by
me, but he forgets to say, early enough, that Stanford still plays a
- real percentage of the Coast's 1 most exciting and colorful ball.
But if you were the sort to let superstition bother you, you'd be
cheered at a few other facts which have about as much import as a
!>!)-yard touchdown run when there's no defensive team on the field.
This year the Indians will be trucaptained. Bob Nicolet, Bob Pe
tersou and Eric ITotiva —to mention names. This year the Indians
have a new coach. Alone these facts don't mean much, but looking
into history: five of the last six Stanford head coaches took their
first squads into Pasadena for New Year celebrations; the last time
the Cards had three captains was in '51, Taylor's first year and a
Rosy year it was! But I'll leave it to you to be the superstitious
kind, I can't see it myself. But just in case, does anyone want to in
vite me to Pasadena for the holidays?
.MORE FROM SUMMER: You don't want to forget some personal
.'i<■(•< mplishments made this summer by Stanfordites and those of
formei years. Ann Quast, golfer from this campus, was a headliner
in sports pages across the nation 1 his summer as she managed to
fop 11 if ■ C.S. National Amateur Women's Golf Championship. You'll
congratulate her but still let her know you're marl because she won't
let you do a feature-length story on her. And ex-QB Jackie Douglas
was a growing figure in the tennis world this summer, on the tour
nament circuit back East. He won the World Tennis (magazine)
"Personality of the Yflar" award. And hopes for a short career in
tennis will keep Douglas from heading back to the Farm this year

dinner table philosopher, and he's
one of the most humorous guys
around.
And another point you know
about is former coach, and now
Assistant Director of Athletics,
Chuck Taylor's summer cornp for
kiddies here on the Coast. Hav
ing lived in Ihe same hall (Toyon)
with these fellows for six weeks
you know how much they
thought of having the opportu
nity 10 work with Taylor, Dutch
Fehring, Mickey Holznian, Herm
Meister, Ilowie Dallmar and oth
er members of the Department
of Athletics whom you don't want
to offend by having forgotten
just how many of them did teach
;it the camp. But in your own
way you know how they feel be
cause you work with these people
too, though in another capacity,

and you don't have to be told that they are some of the nicest guys
you'll ever work with.
REALLY A CURSE? And you're laughing at what happened just
aboul a week ago. On the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine the
name "Stanford"—and you're pretty much shook up. Thinking back
you remember that in the past people or teams which SI has featured
have, by some stroke of fate, had lousy seasons following write-ups.
And you remember last year's Sports Editor Dick Barnes' impas
sioned plea to SI to leave us off their cover.
But now that we've laughed at SI, let's compliment them on a
fine story in the current issue. "A Cactus IMant in Stanford's Ivy"
reads the title on a story about new Head Coach Curtice. Well writ
ten, by dames Murray, the story gets into Curtice's philosophy of
what we will see on successive Saturdays out there on the turf. It
rails the Stanford alumni "defeat-conditioned," which is okay by
me, but he forgets to say, early enough, that Stanford still plays a
- real percentage of the Coast's 1 most exciting and colorful ball.
But if you were the sort to let superstition bother you, you'd be
cheered at a few other facts which have about as much import as a
!>!)-yard touchdown run when there's no defensive team on the field.
This year the Indians will be trucaptained. Bob Nicolet, Bob Pe
tersou and Eric ITotiva —to mention names. This year the Indians
have a new coach. Alone these facts don't mean much, but looking
into history: five of the last six Stanford head coaches took their
first squads into Pasadena for New Year celebrations; the last time
the Cards had three captains was in '51, Taylor's first year and a
Rosy year it was! But I'll leave it to you to be the superstitious
kind, I can't see it myself. But just in case, does anyone want to in
vite me to Pasadena for the holidays?
.MORE FROM SUMMER: You don't want to forget some personal
.'i<■(•< mplishments made this summer by Stanfordites and those of
formei years. Ann Quast, golfer from this campus, was a headliner
in sports pages across the nation 1 his summer as she managed to
fop 11 if ■ C.S. National Amateur Women's Golf Championship. You'll
congratulate her but still let her know you're marl because she won't
let you do a feature-length story on her. And ex-QB Jackie Douglas
was a growing figure in the tennis world this summer, on the tour
nament circuit back East. He won the World Tennis (magazine)
"Personality of the Yflar" award. And hopes for a short career in
tennis will keep Douglas from heading back to the Farm this year
for graduate work in law.
. . . Awl Where I) \a Go?
But you can't go on about the past; there is a present and a future
foi you to think about, and maybe even worry about a little. So
you quickly get rid of the present by telling your readers that your
policy, if such a one exists, will be to look around the sports scene
that pertains to the coast college world. You don't really know
much about the national picture, and you don't really care much for
professional baseball, so Major League and World Scries scores are
probably the most they'll get along those lines. But you're open to
requests for more if they should come.
AND THEN TIIIO FUTURE: Now you're up against it pretty
much. You'll make like a predictor and tell them what's in store.
And you'll start by saying you think the Indians will come to life
tomorrow in their home stadium and get the victory for Jokin'
Cacius Jack that they wanted so much last week. Rice is a fine
team, defending champions in the Southvvst Conference, but you
believe the Indians have a potential that came nowhere near mate
rializing up in Pullman last week. Your big complaint with that
game was simply that the Cards didn't have a chance to test the
plays they'll have to use this year.
You could go on to single out individuals on the team but that
has to stop somewhere before you get through the whole roster, and
it's more than fitting to complement the entire team for the work
they've done so far. All through spring, and since September 1
they've been trying their hardest to show us the best. And if they
don't show us a victory, they will show us spirit and some of the
( oast's best ball. And as a group, this is one of the finest groups
on Stanford land. They manage to make a football trip a mighty
enjoyable experience.
So regardless of what may happen you stop to wish them a very
enjoyable (and you hope successful! season. To them, and new Head
Com b Curtice: THE VERY BEST!
FURTHER AHEAD: Skipping lightly over football for the pros
out (you'll be with it for eight plus weeks now) you come to basket
ball and you can't help but notice the gleam in Ilowie Dallmar's
eves. All around you people are whispering "THIS is THE YEAR"
lor the hoopsters. And it'fc pretty hard to sec; any reason why it
houldn't be. Check the starting lineups from last, year, then look
around you to see the faces —they're still here. And they finished in
a blaze last lime around. Note to that secretary again: I think you
can order the blanket of roses. I see the team coming down the
home stretch without much competition in sight.
AND FURTHER YET: There are other sports which should comi
through to make it an all-around successful year for Stanford. Goll
Coach IJud Finger can expect to find some good men out on the link. 1
this year. Swim Mentor Tom llaynie has lost the services of AAU
chump Robin Moore, but his future is brightened considerably by
George Harrison who tinned in some amazing marks as a frosh last
veai Dutch Fehring will have a well-rounded baseball squad return
in/' A few holes yet to be filled, but a long time to fill them. Payton
Jordan starts his third year as track coach and should come up with
another ol his usual fine, well-rounded and exciting squads alone

summer you lliink and observe try to set up the first of these
weekly typewriter sessions. Little notebooks surround you, each one
full of quips from here and thereabouts. You'll start with these, then
make a statement of policy. Every new editor does. Then you'll open
your big, crystal-ball eyes and predict a nine-month future in sports,
Stanford sports, PCX' sports, intramural sports, maybe.
But then the lime comes. You can't wait any longer to let ideas
accumulate, and now's the time to write them out. So you look back
through all the little notes, and half of them are useless now; they're
so old. Half, who're you kidding? Most all.
Taking a second thought you realize that not everyone who reads
this (and you half-heartedly expect that some people will) will not
know about these notes. So you rationalize into the idea that they
don't know about any a 1 all; all of them will be little news gems.
You know it's too late to pick up any more, so these get the dust
wiped off and you're off into another sports season.

COACH JACK CURTICE
Where l.)"Ya Slarl .. .
lIIJST COLUMN, FALL OF 'SS: About two weeks ago it seemed,
to this writer anyway, that September 2r> (our first day of work >
would never come. And now it's here and gone by this reading. All
summer you lliink and observe try to set up the first of these
weekly typewriter sessions. Little notebooks surround you, each one
full of quips from here and thereabouts. You'll start with these, then
make a statement of policy. Every new editor does. Then you'll open
your big, crystal-ball eyes and predict a nine-month future in sports,
Stanford sports, PCX' sports, intramural sports, maybe.
But then the lime comes. You can't wait any longer to let ideas
accumulate, and now's the time to write them out. So you look back
through all the little notes, and half of them are useless now; they're
so old. Half, who're you kidding? Most all.
Taking a second thought you realize that not everyone who reads
this (and you half-heartedly expect that some people will) will not
know about these notes. So you rationalize into the idea that they
don't know about any a 1 all; all of them will be little news gems.
You know it's too late to pick up any more, so these get the dust
wiped off and you're off into another sports season.
HACK INTO SL'MMKR; First note dates way back to days of
conscientiousness in the early summer when you planned to be on
top of the sports-writing game all along. It reads "Curtice at Clin
ics." An extremely popular guy around the coaching world, Jack
Curtice did put in quite a few football clinic appearances this
ciimrvioi' Chin nf 1 hn«p tnnk Him

summer, une 01 mese iook mm
down to Santa Barbara, another
1o Hawaii. He really knows this
(jiinu) <il fool ha 11, he's a top-notch
dinner table philosopher, and he's
one of the most humorous guys
around.
And another point you know
about is former coach, and now
Assistant Director of Athletics,
Chuck Taylor's summer cornp for
kiddies here on the Coast. Hav
ing lived in Ihe same hall (Toyon)
with these fellows for six weeks
you know how much they
thought of having the opportu
nity 10 work with Taylor, Dutch
Fehring, Mickey Holznian, Herm
Meister, Ilowie Dallmar and oth
er members of the Department
of Athletics whom you don't want
to offend by having forgotten
just how many of them did teach
;it the camp. But in your own
way you know how they feel be
cause you work with these people
too, though in another capacity,

and you don't have to be told that they are some of the nicest guys
you'll ever work with.
REALLY A CURSE? And you're laughing at what happened just
aboul a week ago. On the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine the
name "Stanford"—and you're pretty much shook up. Thinking back
you remember that in the past people or teams which SI has featured
have, by some stroke of fate, had lousy seasons following write-ups.
And you remember last year's Sports Editor Dick Barnes' impas
sioned plea to SI to leave us off their cover.
But now that we've laughed at SI, let's compliment them on a
fine story in the current issue. "A Cactus IMant in Stanford's Ivy"
reads the title on a story about new Head Coach Curtice. Well writ
ten, by dames Murray, the story gets into Curtice's philosophy of
what we will see on successive Saturdays out there on the turf. It
rails the Stanford alumni "defeat-conditioned," which is okay by
me, but he forgets to say, early enough, that Stanford still plays a
- real percentage of the Coast's 1 most exciting and colorful ball.
But if you were the sort to let superstition bother you, you'd be
cheered at a few other facts which have about as much import as a
!>!)-yard touchdown run when there's no defensive team on the field.
This year the Indians will be trucaptained. Bob Nicolet, Bob Pe
tersou and Eric ITotiva —to mention names. This year the Indians
have a new coach. Alone these facts don't mean much, but looking
into history: five of the last six Stanford head coaches took their
first squads into Pasadena for New Year celebrations; the last time
the Cards had three captains was in '51, Taylor's first year and a
Rosy year it was! But I'll leave it to you to be the superstitious
kind, I can't see it myself. But just in case, does anyone want to in
vite me to Pasadena for the holidays?
.MORE FROM SUMMER: You don't want to forget some personal
.'i<■(•< mplishments made this summer by Stanfordites and those of
formei years. Ann Quast, golfer from this campus, was a headliner
in sports pages across the nation 1 his summer as she managed to
fop 11 if ■ C.S. National Amateur Women's Golf Championship. You'll
congratulate her but still let her know you're marl because she won't
let you do a feature-length story on her. And ex-QB Jackie Douglas
was a growing figure in the tennis world this summer, on the tour
nament circuit back East. He won the World Tennis (magazine)
"Personality of the Yflar" award. And hopes for a short career in
tennis will keep Douglas from heading back to the Farm this year
for graduate work in law.
. . . Awl Where I) \a Go?
But you can't go on about the past; there is a present and a future
foi you to think about, and maybe even worry about a little. So
you quickly get rid of the present by telling your readers that your
policy, if such a one exists, will be to look around the sports scene
that pertains to the coast college world. You don't really know
much about the national picture, and you don't really care much for
professional baseball, so Major League and World Scries scores are
probably the most they'll get along those lines. But you're open to
requests for more if they should come.
AND THEN TIIIO FUTURE: Now you're up against it pretty
much. You'll make like a predictor and tell them what's in store.
And you'll start by saying you think the Indians will come to life
tomorrow in their home stadium and get the victory for Jokin'
Cacius Jack that they wanted so much last week. Rice is a fine
team, defending champions in the Southvvst Conference, but you
believe the Indians have a potential that came nowhere near mate
rializing up in Pullman last week. Your big complaint with that
game was simply that the Cards didn't have a chance to test the
plays they'll have to use this year.
You could go on to single out individuals on the team but that
has to stop somewhere before you get through the whole roster, and
it's more than fitting to complement the entire team for the work
they've done so far. All through spring, and since September 1
they've been trying their hardest to show us the best. And if they
don't show us a victory, they will show us spirit and some of the
( oast's best ball. And as a group, this is one of the finest groups
on Stanford land. They manage to make a football trip a mighty
enjoyable experience.
So regardless of what may happen you stop to wish them a very
enjoyable (and you hope successful! season. To them, and new Head

cheered at a few other facts which have about as much import as a
!>!)-yard touchdown run when there's no defensive team on the field.
This year the Indians will be trucaptained. Bob Nicolet, Bob Pe
tersou and Eric ITotiva —to mention names. This year the Indians
have a new coach. Alone these facts don't mean much, but looking
into history: five of the last six Stanford head coaches took their
first squads into Pasadena for New Year celebrations; the last time
the Cards had three captains was in '51, Taylor's first year and a
Rosy year it was! But I'll leave it to you to be the superstitious
kind, I can't see it myself. But just in case, does anyone want to in
vite me to Pasadena for the holidays?
.MORE FROM SUMMER: You don't want to forget some personal
.'i<■(•< mplishments made this summer by Stanfordites and those of
formei years. Ann Quast, golfer from this campus, was a headliner
in sports pages across the nation 1 his summer as she managed to
fop 11 if ■ C.S. National Amateur Women's Golf Championship. You'll
congratulate her but still let her know you're marl because she won't
let you do a feature-length story on her. And ex-QB Jackie Douglas
was a growing figure in the tennis world this summer, on the tour
nament circuit back East. He won the World Tennis (magazine)
"Personality of the Yflar" award. And hopes for a short career in
tennis will keep Douglas from heading back to the Farm this year
for graduate work in law.
. . . Awl Where I) \a Go?
But you can't go on about the past; there is a present and a future
foi you to think about, and maybe even worry about a little. So
you quickly get rid of the present by telling your readers that your
policy, if such a one exists, will be to look around the sports scene
that pertains to the coast college world. You don't really know
much about the national picture, and you don't really care much for
professional baseball, so Major League and World Scries scores are
probably the most they'll get along those lines. But you're open to
requests for more if they should come.
AND THEN TIIIO FUTURE: Now you're up against it pretty
much. You'll make like a predictor and tell them what's in store.
And you'll start by saying you think the Indians will come to life
tomorrow in their home stadium and get the victory for Jokin'
Cacius Jack that they wanted so much last week. Rice is a fine
team, defending champions in the Southvvst Conference, but you
believe the Indians have a potential that came nowhere near mate
rializing up in Pullman last week. Your big complaint with that
game was simply that the Cards didn't have a chance to test the
plays they'll have to use this year.
You could go on to single out individuals on the team but that
has to stop somewhere before you get through the whole roster, and
it's more than fitting to complement the entire team for the work
they've done so far. All through spring, and since September 1
they've been trying their hardest to show us the best. And if they
don't show us a victory, they will show us spirit and some of the
( oast's best ball. And as a group, this is one of the finest groups
on Stanford land. They manage to make a football trip a mighty
enjoyable experience.
So regardless of what may happen you stop to wish them a very
enjoyable (and you hope successful! season. To them, and new Head
Com b Curtice: THE VERY BEST!
FURTHER AHEAD: Skipping lightly over football for the pros
out (you'll be with it for eight plus weeks now) you come to basket
ball and you can't help but notice the gleam in Ilowie Dallmar's
eves. All around you people are whispering "THIS is THE YEAR"

houldn't be. Check the starting lineups from last, year, then look
around you to see the faces —they're still here. And they finished in
a blaze last lime around. Note to that secretary again: I think you
can order the blanket of roses. I see the team coming down the
home stretch without much competition in sight.
AND FURTHER YET: There are other sports which should comi
through to make it an all-around successful year for Stanford. Goll

COACH JACK CURTICE
Where l.)"Ya Slarl .. .
lIIJST COLUMN, FALL OF 'SS: About two weeks ago it seemed,
to this writer anyway, that September 2r> (our first day of work >
would never come. And now it's here and gone by this reading. All
summer you lliink and observe try to set up the first of these
weekly typewriter sessions. Little notebooks surround you, each one
full of quips from here and thereabouts. You'll start with these, then
make a statement of policy. Every new editor does. Then you'll open
your big, crystal-ball eyes and predict a nine-month future in sports,
Stanford sports, PCX' sports, intramural sports, maybe.
But then the lime comes. You can't wait any longer to let ideas
accumulate, and now's the time to write them out. So you look back
through all the little notes, and half of them are useless now; they're
so old. Half, who're you kidding? Most all.
Taking a second thought you realize that not everyone who reads
this (and you half-heartedly expect that some people will) will not
know about these notes. So you rationalize into the idea that they
don't know about any a 1 all; all of them will be little news gems.
You know it's too late to pick up any more, so these get the dust
wiped off and you're off into another sports season.
HACK INTO SL'MMKR; First note dates way back to days of
conscientiousness in the early summer when you planned to be on
top of the sports-writing game all along. It reads "Curtice at Clin
ics." An extremely popular guy around the coaching world, Jack
Curtice did put in quite a few football clinic appearances this
ciimrvioi' Chin nf 1 hn«p tnnk Him

summer, une 01 mese iook mm
down to Santa Barbara, another
1o Hawaii. He really knows this
(jiinu) <il fool ha 11, he's a top-notch
dinner table philosopher, and he's
one of the most humorous guys
around.
And another point you know
about is former coach, and now
Assistant Director of Athletics,
Chuck Taylor's summer cornp for
kiddies here on the Coast. Hav
ing lived in Ihe same hall (Toyon)
with these fellows for six weeks
you know how much they
thought of having the opportu
nity 10 work with Taylor, Dutch
Fehring, Mickey Holznian, Herm
Meister, Ilowie Dallmar and oth
er members of the Department
of Athletics whom you don't want
to offend by having forgotten
just how many of them did teach
;it the camp. But in your own
way you know how they feel be
cause you work with these people
too, though in another capacity,

and you don't have to be told that they are some of the nicest guys
you'll ever work with.
REALLY A CURSE? And you're laughing at what happened just
aboul a week ago. On the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine the
name "Stanford"—and you're pretty much shook up. Thinking back
you remember that in the past people or teams which SI has featured
have, by some stroke of fate, had lousy seasons following write-ups.
And you remember last year's Sports Editor Dick Barnes' impas
sioned plea to SI to leave us off their cover.
But now that we've laughed at SI, let's compliment them on a
fine story in the current issue. "A Cactus IMant in Stanford's Ivy"
reads the title on a story about new Head Coach Curtice. Well writ
ten, by dames Murray, the story gets into Curtice's philosophy of
what we will see on successive Saturdays out there on the turf. It
rails the Stanford alumni "defeat-conditioned," which is okay by
me, but he forgets to say, early enough, that Stanford still plays a
- real percentage of the Coast's 1 most exciting and colorful ball.
But if you were the sort to let superstition bother you, you'd be
cheered at a few other facts which have about as much import as a
!>!)-yard touchdown run when there's no defensive team on the field.
This year the Indians will be trucaptained. Bob Nicolet, Bob Pe
tersou and Eric ITotiva —to mention names. This year the Indians
