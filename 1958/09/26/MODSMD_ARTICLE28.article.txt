### 
Rice Institute'* Owls will arrive
at the San Francisco International
Airport today at 1:50 p.m. After
their arrival they will move down
the Peninsula to their Rickey's
Studio Inn headquarters.
Coach Jess Neely has slated a
workout for the Owls in the Stan
ford Stadium for some time be
tween 3 and 5 p.m. today.
Rice athletic publicity director
Bill Whitmore has noted that the
workout will most likely not be a
closed one. He said that it is
coach Neely's policy to have a
warm-up session upon arrival in a
strange city and that in the past
these have not been secret ses
sions of anv kind.

The moon's highest known
mountain is five miles above its
average surface level.
