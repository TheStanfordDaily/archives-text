OUTSTANDING OWLS â€” Quarterback Larry
Dueitt and end Buddy Dial are figured to turn
in standout performances when the Rice Insti
tute Owls make their Bay Area debut in Stan
lord Stadium on Saturday. Dueitt, who played
at the Owls' left halfback slot last year, has the

unenviable job of filling shoes left by top-notch
quarterbacks Frank Ryan arid King Hill. Dial,
an Ail-American candidate this year, led Use
Southwest Conference with 21 catches for 508
yards and four TD's last year. Both [Mayers are
seniors.
