# Bohn Welcomes Class of '62
## 
### 
"Tim Stanford Spirit is an in
tangible thing. When you come
here don't export it to drop down
on top you as you swing off
Palm Drive. You may not even
sense it after you've been to
your first Jolly-Up or Iteg dance,
or met your counselor or wing
mates. It may not be evident
until you have yelled the Axe
yell, or sung the Stanford Ilymn.
Hut some place along the line
you will pick it up and will say
to yourself, 'I know what it is
now.' "
Perhaps in your eagerness to
understand the whys and where
fores of Stanford you missed this
passage in the Stanford Handbook.
To me it is the central theme un
derlying all else that happens on
or about the campus.
Maybe you have heard about the
spirit, or maybe it was the aca
demie standards or the sports pro
gram, or even just the campus it
' i !t, iwhich at first interested you
in coming to Stanford. Whatever
it was, each part of the Stanford
picture is necessary to the whole
a whole to which each of you now
belongs. I am glad to have the op
porlunity to say hello and to ex
lend a cordial welcome to the Clas. 1
of 1%2, the youngest generatior
of the Stanford Family. We like it
here. I sincerely think you will
too.
