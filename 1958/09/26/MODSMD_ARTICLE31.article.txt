# Card Eleven Picks Captains
## 
### 
'For the first time since 1951, the
varsity football team has elected
three players as co-captains. Quar
terback Bob Nicolet, guard Bob
Peterson and tackle Eric Protiva
will share the honors.
Peterson is a senior and the
only returning letterman who ac
tually played guard on last sea
son's squad. He weighs in at 185
pounds, -small for a lineman, but
makes up for his lack of weight
with good speed, fine tackling and
good blocking.
Protiva, also a senior, had more
actual playing time than any oth
' er Indian lineman last season, to
| taling 314 minutes. A native of
Teheran, Iran, he weighs 222 and
is also very agile.
Nicolet, another senior, playing
! in the Brodie-Douglas era of Stan
ford quarterbacks, has only had
150 minutes of playing time, but
I completed seven of 19 passes for
j two TD's last year.
