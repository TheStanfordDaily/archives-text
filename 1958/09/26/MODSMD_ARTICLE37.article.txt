Saturday's PCC football card
I shows all of the West Coast's
squads playing important inter
; sectional games.
Five members of the conference
will meet foes from the Big Ten.
The UCLA Bruins, trying to re
bound off their weak showing
against Pitt last week, will travel
to Illinois to play the University
of Illinois.
The Bruins' crosstown neigh
bors from USC will also travel to
the Midwest. The "Trojans will
take th e i r sophomore • studded
team to Ann Arbor, Mich., where
they will take on the Wolverines
from the University of Michigan.
The three other PCC members
who will meet up with Big Ten
opponents are the University of
YVashington. which squares off
against the Minnesota Gophers;
I the Washington State 1 College

Cougars, who will face Northwest-1
ern; and California's Golden
Bears, who will tangle with Michi
gan State.
Michigan SiuU» Strong
Cal, in playing Michigan State, i
will find itself up against one of
the preseason choices for the
No. 1 spot in college football. The
Spartan,-; from Lansing, Mich.,
have three possible All - America
candidates in end Stan Williams,
tackle Fran O'Brien and halfback
Dean Look. The Bears, who could
not handle COP last week, should
hi 1 in for a lot of trouble.
Last year's PCC Rose Bowl
team, the Oregon Webfoots, will
meet up with Bud Wilkinson's
football machine, the University
of Oklahoma.
Oklahoma, still loaded with a
great offensive unit, 1 a e k s its
usual defensive mastery and
therefore will not be as strong as
in previous years. However, re
gardless of its defects, the Okla

homans will still be heavy favor
ites to l ip Oregon.
Missouri Vs. Idaho
The University of Missouri will
play host to the Idaho Vandals in
another of the week-end tilts. The
Missourians in last week's NCAA
televised game, lost to Vanderbilt
and will be out to gain revenge
against Idaho.
The remaining game on the
PCC schedule sees the Oregon
State Beavers playing the Kansas
Jay hawks.
In one other game of local in
terest, the COP Tigers, conquer
ors of Cal last week, meet Arizona
State. The men from Arizona
were one of two teams last year
who completed the season unde
feated and untied. This year they
have a new coach along with plen
ty of talent imported from the
high schools of southern Califor
nia, and will provide COP with
much more competition than they
had in their opener.
