# FCC WARNING
## KZSU Gets Indefinite Suspension 
### 
Another in a series of repri
mands from the Federal Commu
nications Commission has been
the final factor in a University de
cision to indefinitely suspend op
eration of campus radio station
KZSU V
The latest warning from the
FCC came on the heels of reports
of alleged wrongdoing by station
staff members and at a time when
the University's radio - television
committee was surveying the
value of the station tp Stanford.
Complaints from the FCC were
based on evidence that KZSU was
transmitting on its closed circuit
lines with more power than it
could legally use.
Other Reprimands
Assistant -speech and drama pro
fessor George Willey told The
Daily that the FCC had previously
reprimanded the station several
times for its attempts to reach a
greater portion of the campus
through use of transmitters which
had excessive radiation.
The latest warning, based on a
June test, was contained in a "cor
rect or cease operation" letter to
President Wallace Sterling and
contained the suggestion that Sta
tion KZSU switch to FM opera
tion.
Shutdown Ordered
Since it was apparent that pre
vious warnings had not corrected
the situation, and since the station
was in a controversial situation
on the other two fronts, Univer
sity officials ordered the shut
down.
Present plans are for speech
and drama instructor John With
erspoon to head a department
group which will meet periodi
cally with former staff members
in an attempt to form a sound
basis for reactivation of the sta
tion.
Recommendations from these
meetings will be studied by the
University and its radio-television
committee. Then, according to
dean of students H. Donald Win
bigler, a final re-evaluation of
KZ S U's organization, functions
and future will be made.
