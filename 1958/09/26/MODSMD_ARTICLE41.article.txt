# Class of '62 Finds Welcome on the Farm
## 
### 
Wednesday morning, Sept. 27,
the members of the Class of '62
moved into their new homes.
Frosh, sponsors and parents all
had a busy and exciting day and
Branner freshman Vicki Reifler
from Seattle, Wash., summed up
the whole day pretty well when
she told The Daily, "I was
scared."
Wally Hawley, Wilbur sponsor,
did a good job of telling how
things looked from the sponsor's
viewpoint. "I thopght everything
was organized at five minutes
BEFORE eight, but at five af
ter!!"
Agnes Peterson, Albany: "Stan
ford is so different from what I
am used to. It looks like an over
grown Spanish mission."
Marjorie Halms, Evanston, 111.:
"They really make an event out
of freshmen. My older sister is
at lowa and it wasn't like this at
all when she entered . . . they let
her forage for herself."
Newt Crumley, a father, Reno:
"Everyone was friendly and co
operative when my daughter

moved into Branner. The recep
tion of the freshmen was well or
ganized and efficient and I've
been very favorably impressed by
everything that I have seen here
today."
Marcia Loer, San Marino: "The
campus is so much more lovely
than I remembered and everyone
has been so friendly and help
ful."
Perry Loer, a father, San Ma
rino: "I'm pleased with the won
derful hospitality shown by the
students and the way in which
they handle the girls. Having men
here to help them move in is won
derful."
Carol Pearson, Branner spon
sor: "The girls are wonderful
and they all seem to know what
they are doing . . . they are not
confused at all. I'm really im
pressed."
Alexis Corfino, a father, Los
Angeles: "I wish I were a stu
dent rather than a parent. Now
I'd be willing to do what I wasn't
willing to do 20 years ago —
study."

Ed Eiseman, Northbrook, 111.:
"Well, it's beautiful. I heard this
would be the brown season, but
I think this is swell. I'm glad to
be here."
Mr. and Mrs. A. I*. Jay Fee,
Bangkok, Siam: "Our daughter
Marcia never had it so good. The
way in which the girls have been
moved into Roble shows real or
ganization. It was marvelous to
have the boys here to help and
the former Roble girls to show
the new arrivals around."
Mary Dungan, Branner spon
sor: "They all look like I felt
when I was a freshman . . . ex
cited and a little scared."
Judy Phillips, Branner spon
sor: "It is a delightful hodge
podge of people. I wish the halls
were a little wider and I could
run a little faster. If we can get
all the boxes and suitcases un
packed maybe we can get to know
each other."
Sheila VViese, Phoenix, Ariz.: I
think we should meet with advis
ers before placement. I do like my
single room and the color. All of

the girls seem friendly and the
sponsors are helpful.
Jeanne Mayo, Long Beach: The
rooms are awfully small. I'm on
the bottom bunk and I have to sit
in the middle of my bed to com
pletely make it. I was at a board
ing school in the East, and I
thought those rooms were small
until I saw these.
Charlotte Ford, San Francisco:
The Pre-Reg activities seem to be
very well organized — everything
from the tours to the help moving
into the dorm.
Robin Daniels, Rutherford: The
most impressive thing so far, I
think, was Convocation. Dr. Ster
ling's speech was very good, and
so was the Choir.
Pepper Brown, Long Beach: The
rooms seem awfully small, and
there just doesn't seem to be any
closet space in this double-single.
Mariana Masterson, Evanston,
111.: Everyone makes you feel
j right at home. I was surprised
that so big a university could have


Forgotten anything? Twelve hundred forty
freshmen invaded the campus Wednesday, bag
and baggage, to take part in a week of orienta
tion and getting acquainted with sponsors and

advisers l»et'ore first classes Oct. 1. The frosh
were officially welcomed in a Convocation
speech by President J. E. Wallace Sterling in
Frost Amphitheater Wednesday evening.



New residents of the Stanford campus survey their domain from
Hoover Tower, points of interest explained by a member of the
Pre-Reg Committee. The tower will be open to new students, 1 to
5 p.m., on Monday.

Last-minute instructions and remembering things left behind wen
familiar scenes at freshman dormitories Wednesday as parents and
members of Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity helped the frosli
move in.
such a small-campus atmosphere.
My high school was 3,200, and il
had a much more formal atmos
phere than seems to prevail here.
And the food is good too.
Jim Moc, Minneapolis, Minn.:
This is the nicest dorm I've ever
seen anywhere; but breakfast
comes too early in the morning,
nobody wakes you up in the morn
ing and you've got to get your own
alarm clock.
Ted Foyri, Dundee, Til.: Well, 1
don't know what I think yet. They
keep us moving and the orienta
tion program is really efficient.
John llalm, Beverly Hills: Ev
erything is really, really great ex
cept the food, my roommate, the
dorm, the sponsors and the women
and, on top of that, my feet hurt.
Bill Kuhn, Seattle, Wash.: Fe
male companionship needed.
Please call Wilbur Hall, room J
