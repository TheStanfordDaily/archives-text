The Seein' Season

(Editor's Note: As The Daily
begins a new year, anil as I lie
Class of starts on ils Univer
sity career, we take (his oppor
tunity to introduce a new col
umn. "With llolli Eyes Open"
will be published regularly
throughout Volume 184 and will
include a wide variety of inter
esting thoughts and events that
make history on The Farm.)
'Tis time to wish again the age
old wish for more hours in the day.
Each and every one of us will then
see more that way. And if there
ever was one, THIS is The Seein'
Season.
September . . . and with it, fall
... and with that, pre-reg, reg, Sat
urdays in stadia, organization, Gai
eties, bonfires . . . handshakes . . .
but, most of all, wide-open eyes.
This week we greet that latest
Class of the Bulgin' Eyeballs. But
it isn't only the newest residents
of Wilbur, Roble and Branner who
don't mi-ss a visual trick—it's open
season for lookin', and everybody's
seein' just as much as their eyes
can hold. Fill 'em up again, Joe;
I just can't seem to get enough
these days.

Though they're not alone, the
newest kiddies in the village—and
soon to be called Papooses (or is it
Papeese?)—have the very most to
see.
How They Look
They look in awe and wonder
ment at halls, and sponsors, too.
Checking into rooms where lots
will happen ere their year is fin
ished. Getting settled is a chore—
there are decorations to buy . . .
study lamps, maybe curtains;
some buy rugs. And it's laughable
to think how many will buy, or
have bought — before the special
sales start, or before their mail
boxes are full of discount cards—
free 'burgers and 'shakes.
What is my sponsor like? Or,
boasting, he's just great! An Al
pha Delt, a Sigma Chi, or possi
bly a Zete. Big wheels, these, who
guide the frosh. Good-looking
sponsor dolls. A tough job ahead
of them, but high hopes, lots of
work and little but success.
What future do they see for Ro
ble Hall, or Branner, even Wilbur?
Most likely they have pictured
what areffs will come about. And
if they haven't, it's foolish to bet
that it won't take long. By now
they've also seen what food will be
coming their way—the fussy ones

may have a gripe, but il won't hist
for long. They soon learn the
"take or starve" existence. And
the girlies—pardon mo. WOMEN
—well, they live on cottage cheese
salads, toast and tea. anyway. Ex
cept, of course, the ones who golf,
or swim, or climb trees. Too bad
there isn't a training table for
some women, huh?
Questions, Questions
And then, of course, they get to
know their roommates, what they
are like. Where are you from?
Your major? Why did you come
here? Taking ROTC? I hear Civ
is onehelluva course! Is everybody
in Physics or Engineering? Drink
[sshhhh]? Smoke? Have a hula
hoop?
LEFT OUT TOO LONG: Bui
there's another kind of lookin' go
in' on—the kind that Freud con
dones. You've got to beat that
ratio, and there's not a better time.
Check the pairs of sexes in the
campus tours line. They're learn
ing; they've got the good word.
The hustlers end up dating, while
the draggers learn how quiet t he
week ends in the library can be.
Three-to-one; my, but these girls •
pardon me, WOMEN have it
good. But, then, 1 can't understand
why some still get left ;it home.
Not too riaive! But the women
have ii best of ;ill surely one out
of their three will be a hero. I
Think ?
OTHER SIGHTS THEY WILE
SEE: This is Engineering Corner,
where one might find anything
from a touring Rusky to a toilet
bowl, a Chappie (is it really fun
ny?) to ;i Billy Graham campaign
poster- (he didn't win). And ovei
there Encina-sylum (a« they called
it long ago) just offices now
wherein your money flows. But
once iilive oh, the tales they tel
of thai old hall! Immortal 21's
Doodles Weaver and many private
jokes.
There's the Bookstore lines
and lines. Impossible to beat. Un
less you wait until too' late, or
scoot on back a day or two ahead
ol when you should. Don't throw
out rebate slips! Twenty per cent,
or maybe only 12.
Hoover Tower! Landmark! A
shining light to guide you all home
when you're lost??? The bells . . .
they ring at strangest times . . .
few know just when or why .. . but
it's always fun to hear the strains
r ing out up in the sky.
Civ Coiner (really History, but
"CIV" to most of the frosh > ... the
classrooms in "the hole" . . . lee
lures in Mem Aud . . . and don't
forget abbreviations: Flo Hel Dink
Mom Aud Spiel, the best of all.
Mem Church; the Physics Lec
ture Hall ... a strange one, to be
sure. The Daily Shack; a road
through Lag; new arches on the
Quad. They'll all get out, buy root
ers' caps, with megaphones for
free. And Stanford jackets, don't
forget — but buy the right kind,
now.
Come Saturday—a foot ba 11
game. Their first a.s students here.
Supporting leader Stanford, they'll
do a "Coach Jack" cheer. Coach.
Coach Jack, Coach Jack Curtice!
Many rahs. Hold onto your hats—
the second time is fast and plenty
loud.
ANOTHER THOUGHT: They
are looking around at one another,
but also looked at, too. Nothing
makes a returning student feel
just a shade elevated as seeing a
new class slide in under him. Or
two or three. You don't look down
your nose it isn't right. In fact,
you're out there hustlin' —or there
will he no date tonight.
Relurnees feel just that much
older; just that much more's been
done. And lookin' at the newest
class can be a lot of fun. Men for
get about such a thing as class
standing and the upperclasswom
en get mad because they do. And
still more talk about "Stanford
women" . . . and this makes the
upperclasswomen madder yet.
Watch out!
SIGHTS THEY WON'T SEE:
The Daily complimenting the
Chappie rivalry, you know! A
Bookstore at the quarter's start
without a line. Signs on Hoover
Tower, or the Roos Atkins shack
not that it isn't there, but it's
been such a mystery to so many
Right by I he Bookstore, but how
many will find it soon? And there
will be no uniforms tomorrow
when the bandsmen start to play, j

and not oven any card stunts —
seems it always starts this way.
AND IN THE FUTURE: They
will see themselves in offices of
great import here'bouts. Future
editors, presidents, all-stars, and
the like. Things still in the future,
but they think about them now.
Jobs on Rally Com, on Exeom, the
history they'll make. And this
makes it more exciting for them;
their world begin* anew. They're
jetter off in Red and White than
n Gold and Blue.
LUMINARIES, TOO: In tht
•lass the names shine out. There's-
Cottle, Football, Southland . . .
Krumley, Holiday Inn, Reno . . .
Fullenwider, ABC, everywhere .. .
bankers' sons, actresses' daugh
rers, kids from world-wide homes.
They'll make the class a standout
one. Well, isn't every one?
MORE SEEIN': The upperclass
men are back — seein' how they
can sneak into the Jollyup, Movie,
Songfest, co-rec. But the most of
them will not succeed, though try
their very hardest. And then Con
grats to those who'll see that they
stay out. And even further to those
who worked to set up the show;
to John Phelps, pre-reg boss, and
to all who worked with him.
MEMO TO THE FROSH: For
months you'll continue to see
•something new every day. Don't
ever close your eyes. There's too
much to miss—and it's really too
easy to miss it.
And as for us: Welcome, '62—
we're glad to SEE you.
