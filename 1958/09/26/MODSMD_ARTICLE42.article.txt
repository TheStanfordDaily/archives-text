The Seein' Season

(Editor's Note: As The Daily
begins a new year, anil as I lie
Class of starts on ils Univer
sity career, we take (his oppor
tunity to introduce a new col
umn. "With llolli Eyes Open"
will be published regularly
throughout Volume 184 and will
include a wide variety of inter
esting thoughts and events that
make history on The Farm.)
'Tis time to wish again the age
old wish for more hours in the day.
Each and every one of us will then
see more that way. And if there
ever was one, THIS is The Seein'
Season.
September . . . and with it, fall
... and with that, pre-reg, reg, Sat
urdays in stadia, organization, Gai
eties, bonfires . . . handshakes . . .
but, most of all, wide-open eyes.
This week we greet that latest
Class of the Bulgin' Eyeballs. But
it isn't only the newest residents
of Wilbur, Roble and Branner who
don't mi-ss a visual trick—it's open
season for lookin', and everybody's
seein' just as much as their eyes
can hold. Fill 'em up again, Joe;
I just can't seem to get enough
these days.

Though they're not alone, the
newest kiddies in the village—and
soon to be called Papooses (or is it
Papeese?)—have the very most to
see.
How They Look
They look in awe and wonder
ment at halls, and sponsors, too.
Checking into rooms where lots
will happen ere their year is fin
ished. Getting settled is a chore—
there are decorations to buy . . .
study lamps, maybe curtains;
some buy rugs. And it's laughable
to think how many will buy, or
have bought — before the special
sales start, or before their mail
boxes are full of discount cards—
free 'burgers and 'shakes.
What is my sponsor like? Or,
boasting, he's just great! An Al
pha Delt, a Sigma Chi, or possi
bly a Zete. Big wheels, these, who
guide the frosh. Good-looking
sponsor dolls. A tough job ahead
of them, but high hopes, lots of
work and little but success.
What future do they see for Ro
ble Hall, or Branner, even Wilbur?
Most likely they have pictured
what areffs will come about. And
if they haven't, it's foolish to bet
that it won't take long. By now
they've also seen what food will be
coming their way—the fussy ones

may have a gripe, but il won't hist
for long. They soon learn the
"take or starve" existence. And
the girlies—pardon mo. WOMEN
—well, they live on cottage cheese
salads, toast and tea. anyway. Ex
cept, of course, the ones who golf,
or swim, or climb trees. Too bad
there isn't a training table for
some women, huh?
Questions, Questions
And then, of course, they get to
know their roommates, what they
are like. Where are you from?
Your major? Why did you come
here? Taking ROTC? I hear Civ
is onehelluva course! Is everybody
in Physics or Engineering? Drink
[sshhhh]? Smoke? Have a hula
hoop?
LEFT OUT TOO LONG: Bui
there's another kind of lookin' go
in' on—the kind that Freud con
dones. You've got to beat that
ratio, and there's not a better time.
Check the pairs of sexes in the
campus tours line. They're learn
ing; they've got the good word.
The hustlers end up dating, while
the draggers learn how quiet t he
week ends in the library can be.
Three-to-one; my, but these girls •
pardon me, WOMEN have it
