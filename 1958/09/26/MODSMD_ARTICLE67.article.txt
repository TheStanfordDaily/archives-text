A new Department of Genetics
in the University School of Medi
cine will be headed by Dr. Joshua
Lederberg. Lederberg's appoint
ment, announced by Dean Robert
H. Alway, will be effective in
April.
Lederberg, presently head of
the medical genetics department

foremost young geneticists in the
United States. He was graduated

noted it as a further move toward
integration of the med school

pected to stimulate collaboration
among the various specialists
working here.
