# Cards Meet Rice Owls In 1958 Home Debut
## 
### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
Saturday's Rice-Stanford (ill in
Stanford Stadium can bo billed hs
but little more than one in which
two teams arc trying to rebound
from season-opening upsets. Not
upsets in the won or lost column,
necessarily, but upsets on the
scoreboards.
Last weekend about this time
nobody figured the Indians would
take a 40-6 trouncing ;it the hands
of the Washington State College
Cougars. And pretty much in the
same vein, you could probably
have gotten any number of Texas
oilmen to bet an oil well that the
Rice-LSU point spread wouldn't
be over six points. The Owls
dropped it

Cloach Jack Curtice took the
Indians behind (lie green walls
011 Thursday tor a "closcd ses
sion" workout in preparation
for Saturday's game. During
the session lie reportedly
worked on a few "special plays"
for the Owls.

Here in Ihe Stanford area the
Card-WSC game vv;is compared to

show on the road before opening
it under New York lights. Pur
pose: to iron the hugs out.
A C»ood Show
Out of Rice this week comes a
press release stating: There is
an old show business axiom that
a poor dress rehearsal means a
good show.
