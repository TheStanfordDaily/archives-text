# Cards Meet Rice Owls In 1958 Home Debut

### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
Saturday's Rice-Stanford (ill in
Stanford Stadium can bo billed hs
but little more than one in which
two teams arc trying to rebound
from season-opening upsets. Not
upsets in the won or lost column,
necessarily, but upsets on the
scoreboards.
Last weekend about this time
nobody figured the Indians would
take a 40-6 trouncing ;it the hands
of the Washington State College
Cougars. And pretty much in the
same vein, you could probably
have gotten any number of Texas
oilmen to bet an oil well that the
Rice-LSU point spread wouldn't
be over six points. The Owls
dropped it

Cloach Jack Curtice took the
Indians behind (lie green walls
011 Thursday tor a "closcd ses

for Saturday's game. During
the session lie reportedly
worked on a few "special plays"
for the Owls.

Jle'U riin Hie Indians Sntnrdiiy
tice, Stanford's head coach, were
Broadway producers, they'd have
more to worry about this week
after ihe flops their teams played
in last time around.
Neither the Owls nor the In
dians got enough of a test in their
opening tilts to know just what's
liable to come off when they clash
heads here on Saturday.
Not Enough Plays
Against the Cougars ihe Cards
ran only 44 plays, hardly enough
to give this season's repertoire a
good test. Against the LSU Ben
gals Rice got off a few more, and
came away from the game with
the same complaint. So it looks
like the Stadium will continue to
be a testing ground come Satur
day.
But for this reason the game
will be just that much closer to
an even go. On paper- the defend
ing Southwest Conference cham
pions, who will look less like
champions only because of the
loss of their ace quarterback team
of Frank Ryan and King Hill,
should be aide to walk away with
a real easy triumph.
Steele Out
Both squads have exactly the
same number of lettermen re
turning, 19. Many of the Owl re
turnees, however, were full-tim
ers on the '57 squad. Only four of
the Card returnees were regulars,
and one of these, Russ Steele, will
not play in the game. He suf
fered a knee injury late in the
week and will be replaced by
Don Dawson at the guard slot.
Quarterbacks for both squads
will be the men to watch Satur
day. Curtice will be starting
sophomore Dick Norman while
senior and co-captain Bob Nicolet
watches from the sidelines, still
suffering from a shoulder-point
er he picked up last Saturday in
Pullman.
Quarterback Puzzle
Norman, Nicolet and junior Sid
Garber were all in the thick of the
fight for the play-caller spot right
up to the week before the Cougar
tilt when Nicolet grabbed it off.
Norman replaced him up north
and shaped up well after a rocky
start. He completed seven of 15
passes for 64 yards, though he
had two intercepted. Garber saw
the least service of the quarter
backs in the game, but did con
nect on the lone five-yard pass he
threw.
Sophomore Gil Dowd has been
elevated to the fullback spot in
the Indian backfield. His impres
sive showing in the north (33
yards in 10 tractor-like carries)
helped him to oust Doug Dick
al that spot. He stands 6-1 and
weighs 200 pounds.
At the halfback spots Curtice
will have soph Rick McMillen and
senior Jim Byrer. McMillen ran
up the highest rushing average
last week with 20 yards in three
carries for a 6.7 average. Byrer
is considered one of the classiest
runners on the squad.
Two Still Out
With veterans Ben Robinson
and Joel Fries still out of their
end spots due to leg injuries, Cur -
tice will go again with Chris Bur
ford and Irv Nikolai. Burford
was the top receiver last week,
grabbing three passes, and
turned in a stellar performance
both offensively and defensively.
Nikolai's two receptions were
good for 19 yards.
Troy Barbee and Eric Protiva,
Stanford tackles, could well shape
up to be two of the Coast's finest
linemen. Barbee has been men
tioned for All-American consider
ation. Both are seniors with
plenty of rough and tough expe
rience.
Guards Bob Peterson and Don
Dawson are not newcomers to
Stanford play either. Peterson
was a regular at the position last
year. Dawson replaces Steele who
will be out, and has shown prom
ice of some fine play to come this
year.
Pursell at Center
At this writing it appears that
Doug Pursell will open in the cen
ter slot. If so ihe impressive
sophomore, who really surprised
everyone in spring practice, and
came back to keep up the pace in

fall drills and the Cougar game,
will be ousting regular Roch
Conklin from the spot. Conklin
had suffered a leg injury before
the WSC trip.
Rice will go with veterans Pat
Bailey and Bill Bucek at the half
back spots. They and substitutes
Sonny Searcey and Gordon Speer
have been real toss-ups for the ;
assignment. Rice is deep here.
At fullback Neely will start sen
ior yardage - eater Ray Chilton.
All - SWC end Buddy Dial will
team with Gene Jones at the end
positions. These two are a dan
gerous pair of targets and the
Cards will be out to stop their ef
fectiveness.
Tackles J. D. Smith and Gene
Miller make impressive sights in
the Rice line at 238 and 224
pounds. But at guard and center
the Owls consider themselves
weak. Rufus King, a sophomore,
nudged his way into a starting
role at guard after the LSU tilt
and Cliff McCraw will hold the
other spot at guard. Charley Pol
lard will be the Owl center.
Stanford scout Andy Everest,
who saw the Owl-Bengal tilt, re
ports that it, like the Card-Cou
gar battle, was no indication of
what Rice will show in the Sta
dium Saturday.
Everest also reports that the
traditional rivalry air had a part
in the outcome of - the game.

senior Jim Byrer. McMillen ran
up the highest rushing average
last week with 20 yards in three
carries for a 6.7 average. Byrer
is considered one of the classiest
runners on the squad.
Two Still Out
With veterans Ben Robinson
and Joel Fries still out of their
end spots due to leg injuries, Cur -
tice will go again with Chris Bur
ford and Irv Nikolai. Burford
was the top receiver last week,
grabbing three passes, and
turned in a stellar performance
both offensively and defensively.
Nikolai's two receptions were
good for 19 yards.
Troy Barbee and Eric Protiva,
Stanford tackles, could well shape
up to be two of the Coast's finest
linemen. Barbee has been men
tioned for All-American consider
ation. Both are seniors with
plenty of rough and tough expe
rience.
Guards Bob Peterson and Don
Dawson are not newcomers to
Stanford play either. Peterson
was a regular at the position last
year. Dawson replaces Steele who
will be out, and has shown prom
ice of some fine play to come this
year.
Pursell at Center
At this writing it appears that
Doug Pursell will open in the cen
ter slot. If so ihe impressive
sophomore, who really surprised
everyone in spring practice, and
came back to keep up the pace in

fall drills and the Cougar game,
will be ousting regular Roch
Conklin from the spot. Conklin
had suffered a leg injury before
the WSC trip.
Rice will go with veterans Pat
Bailey and Bill Bucek at the half
back spots. They and substitutes
Sonny Searcey and Gordon Speer
have been real toss-ups for the ;
assignment. Rice is deep here.
At fullback Neely will start sen
ior yardage - eater Ray Chilton.
All - SWC end Buddy Dial will
team with Gene Jones at the end
positions. These two are a dan
gerous pair of targets and the
Cards will be out to stop their ef
fectiveness.
Tackles J. D. Smith and Gene
Miller make impressive sights in
the Rice line at 238 and 224
pounds. But at guard and center
the Owls consider themselves
weak. Rufus King, a sophomore,
nudged his way into a starting
role at guard after the LSU tilt
and Cliff McCraw will hold the
other spot at guard. Charley Pol
lard will be the Owl center.
Stanford scout Andy Everest,
who saw the Owl-Bengal tilt, re
ports that it, like the Card-Cou
gar battle, was no indication of
what Rice will show in the Sta
dium Saturday.
Everest also reports that the
traditional rivalry air had a part
in the outcome of - the game.

Jle'U riin Hie Indians Sntnrdiiy
tice, Stanford's head coach, were
Broadway producers, they'd have
more to worry about this week
after ihe flops their teams played
in last time around.
Neither the Owls nor the In
dians got enough of a test in their
opening tilts to know just what's
liable to come off when they clash
heads here on Saturday.
Not Enough Plays
Against the Cougars ihe Cards
ran only 44 plays, hardly enough
to give this season's repertoire a
good test. Against the LSU Ben
gals Rice got off a few more, and
came away from the game with
the same complaint. So it looks
like the Stadium will continue to
be a testing ground come Satur
day.
But for this reason the game
will be just that much closer to
an even go. On paper- the defend
ing Southwest Conference cham
pions, who will look less like
champions only because of the
loss of their ace quarterback team
of Frank Ryan and King Hill,
should be aide to walk away with
a real easy triumph.
Steele Out
Both squads have exactly the
same number of lettermen re
turning, 19. Many of the Owl re
turnees, however, were full-tim
ers on the '57 squad. Only four of
the Card returnees were regulars,
and one of these, Russ Steele, will
not play in the game. He suf
fered a knee injury late in the
week and will be replaced by
Don Dawson at the guard slot.
Quarterbacks for both squads
will be the men to watch Satur
day. Curtice will be starting
sophomore Dick Norman while
senior and co-captain Bob Nicolet
watches from the sidelines, still
suffering from a shoulder-point
er he picked up last Saturday in
Pullman.
Quarterback Puzzle
Norman, Nicolet and junior Sid
Garber were all in the thick of the
fight for the play-caller spot right
up to the week before the Cougar
tilt when Nicolet grabbed it off.
Norman replaced him up north
and shaped up well after a rocky
start. He completed seven of 15
passes for 64 yards, though he
had two intercepted. Garber saw
the least service of the quarter
backs in the game, but did con
nect on the lone five-yard pass he
threw.
Sophomore Gil Dowd has been
elevated to the fullback spot in
the Indian backfield. His impres
sive showing in the north (33
yards in 10 tractor-like carries)
helped him to oust Doug Dick
al that spot. He stands 6-1 and
weighs 200 pounds.
At the halfback spots Curtice
will have soph Rick McMillen and
senior Jim Byrer. McMillen ran
up the highest rushing average
last week with 20 yards in three
carries for a 6.7 average. Byrer
is considered one of the classiest
runners on the squad.

Jle'U riin Hie Indians Sntnrdiiy
tice, Stanford's head coach, were
Broadway producers, they'd have
more to worry about this week
after ihe flops their teams played
in last time around.
Neither the Owls nor the In
dians got enough of a test in their
opening tilts to know just what's
liable to come off when they clash
heads here on Saturday.
Not Enough Plays
Against the Cougars ihe Cards
ran only 44 plays, hardly enough
to give this season's repertoire a
good test. Against the LSU Ben
gals Rice got off a few more, and
came away from the game with
the same complaint. So it looks
like the Stadium will continue to
be a testing ground come Satur
day.
But for this reason the game
will be just that much closer to
an even go. On paper- the defend
ing Southwest Conference cham
pions, who will look less like
champions only because of the
loss of their ace quarterback team
of Frank Ryan and King Hill,
should be aide to walk away with
a real easy triumph.
Steele Out
Both squads have exactly the
same number of lettermen re
turning, 19. Many of the Owl re
turnees, however, were full-tim
ers on the '57 squad. Only four of
the Card returnees were regulars,
and one of these, Russ Steele, will
not play in the game. He suf
fered a knee injury late in the
week and will be replaced by
Don Dawson at the guard slot.
Quarterbacks for both squads
will be the men to watch Satur
day. Curtice will be starting
sophomore Dick Norman while
senior and co-captain Bob Nicolet
watches from the sidelines, still
suffering from a shoulder-point
er he picked up last Saturday in
Pullman.
Quarterback Puzzle
Norman, Nicolet and junior Sid
Garber were all in the thick of the
fight for the play-caller spot right
up to the week before the Cougar
tilt when Nicolet grabbed it off.
Norman replaced him up north
and shaped up well after a rocky
start. He completed seven of 15
passes for 64 yards, though he
had two intercepted. Garber saw
the least service of the quarter
backs in the game, but did con
nect on the lone five-yard pass he
threw.
Sophomore Gil Dowd has been
elevated to the fullback spot in
the Indian backfield. His impres
sive showing in the north (33
yards in 10 tractor-like carries)
helped him to oust Doug Dick
al that spot. He stands 6-1 and
weighs 200 pounds.
At the halfback spots Curtice
will have soph Rick McMillen and
senior Jim Byrer. McMillen ran
up the highest rushing average
last week with 20 yards in three
carries for a 6.7 average. Byrer
is considered one of the classiest
runners on the squad.
Two Still Out
With veterans Ben Robinson
and Joel Fries still out of their
end spots due to leg injuries, Cur -
tice will go again with Chris Bur
ford and Irv Nikolai. Burford
was the top receiver last week,
grabbing three passes, and
turned in a stellar performance
both offensively and defensively.
Nikolai's two receptions were
good for 19 yards.
Troy Barbee and Eric Protiva,
Stanford tackles, could well shape
up to be two of the Coast's finest
linemen. Barbee has been men
tioned for All-American consider
ation. Both are seniors with
plenty of rough and tough expe
rience.
Guards Bob Peterson and Don
Dawson are not newcomers to
Stanford play either. Peterson
was a regular at the position last
year. Dawson replaces Steele who
will be out, and has shown prom
ice of some fine play to come this
year.
Pursell at Center
At this writing it appears that
Doug Pursell will open in the cen
ter slot. If so ihe impressive
sophomore, who really surprised
everyone in spring practice, and
came back to keep up the pace in

fall drills and the Cougar game,
will be ousting regular Roch
Conklin from the spot. Conklin
had suffered a leg injury before
the WSC trip.
Rice will go with veterans Pat
Bailey and Bill Bucek at the half
back spots. They and substitutes
Sonny Searcey and Gordon Speer
have been real toss-ups for the ;
assignment. Rice is deep here.
At fullback Neely will start sen
ior yardage - eater Ray Chilton.
All - SWC end Buddy Dial will
team with Gene Jones at the end
positions. These two are a dan
gerous pair of targets and the
Cards will be out to stop their ef
fectiveness.
Tackles J. D. Smith and Gene
Miller make impressive sights in
the Rice line at 238 and 224
pounds. But at guard and center
the Owls consider themselves
weak. Rufus King, a sophomore,
nudged his way into a starting
role at guard after the LSU tilt
and Cliff McCraw will hold the
other spot at guard. Charley Pol
lard will be the Owl center.
Stanford scout Andy Everest,
who saw the Owl-Bengal tilt, re
ports that it, like the Card-Cou
gar battle, was no indication of
what Rice will show in the Sta
dium Saturday.
Everest also reports that the
traditional rivalry air had a part
in the outcome of - the game.
Saturday's Rice-Stanford (ill in
Stanford Stadium can bo billed hs
but little more than one in which
two teams arc trying to rebound
from season-opening upsets. Not
upsets in the won or lost column,
necessarily, but upsets on the
scoreboards.
Last weekend about this time
nobody figured the Indians would
take a 40-6 trouncing ;it the hands
of the Washington State College
Cougars. And pretty much in the
same vein, you could probably
have gotten any number of Texas
oilmen to bet an oil well that the
Rice-LSU point spread wouldn't
be over six points. The Owls
dropped it

Cloach Jack Curtice took the
Indians behind (lie green walls
011 Thursday tor a "closcd ses
sion" workout in preparation
for Saturday's game. During
the session lie reportedly
worked on a few "special plays"
for the Owls.

SOI'IIOIMORF, qiIAKTKKRACK DIC K NOI{.MAN
Jle'U riin Hie Indians Sntnrdiiy
tice, Stanford's head coach, were
Broadway producers, they'd have
more to worry about this week
after ihe flops their teams played
in last time around.
Neither the Owls nor the In
dians got enough of a test in their
opening tilts to know just what's
liable to come off when they clash
heads here on Saturday.
Not Enough Plays
Against the Cougars ihe Cards
ran only 44 plays, hardly enough
to give this season's repertoire a
good test. Against the LSU Ben
gals Rice got off a few more, and
came away from the game with
the same complaint. So it looks
like the Stadium will continue to
be a testing ground come Satur
day.
But for this reason the game
will be just that much closer to
an even go. On paper- the defend
ing Southwest Conference cham
pions, who will look less like
champions only because of the
loss of their ace quarterback team
of Frank Ryan and King Hill,
should be aide to walk away with
a real easy triumph.
Steele Out
Both squads have exactly the
same number of lettermen re
turning, 19. Many of the Owl re
turnees, however, were full-tim
ers on the '57 squad. Only four of
the Card returnees were regulars,
and one of these, Russ Steele, will
not play in the game. He suf
fered a knee injury late in the
week and will be replaced by
Don Dawson at the guard slot.
Quarterbacks for both squads
will be the men to watch Satur
day. Curtice will be starting
sophomore Dick Norman while
senior and co-captain Bob Nicolet
watches from the sidelines, still
suffering from a shoulder-point
er he picked up last Saturday in
Pullman.
Quarterback Puzzle
Norman, Nicolet and junior Sid
Garber were all in the thick of the
fight for the play-caller spot right
up to the week before the Cougar
tilt when Nicolet grabbed it off.
Norman replaced him up north
and shaped up well after a rocky
start. He completed seven of 15
passes for 64 yards, though he
had two intercepted. Garber saw
the least service of the quarter
backs in the game, but did con
nect on the lone five-yard pass he
threw.
Sophomore Gil Dowd has been
elevated to the fullback spot in
the Indian backfield. His impres
sive showing in the north (33
yards in 10 tractor-like carries)
helped him to oust Doug Dick
al that spot. He stands 6-1 and
weighs 200 pounds.
At the halfback spots Curtice
will have soph Rick McMillen and
senior Jim Byrer. McMillen ran
up the highest rushing average
last week with 20 yards in three
carries for a 6.7 average. Byrer
is considered one of the classiest
runners on the squad.
Two Still Out
With veterans Ben Robinson
and Joel Fries still out of their
end spots due to leg injuries, Cur -
tice will go again with Chris Bur
ford and Irv Nikolai. Burford
was the top receiver last week,
grabbing three passes, and
turned in a stellar performance
both offensively and defensively.
Nikolai's two receptions were
good for 19 yards.
Troy Barbee and Eric Protiva,
Stanford tackles, could well shape
up to be two of the Coast's finest
linemen. Barbee has been men
tioned for All-American consider
ation. Both are seniors with
plenty of rough and tough expe
rience.
Guards Bob Peterson and Don
Dawson are not newcomers to
Stanford play either. Peterson
was a regular at the position last
year. Dawson replaces Steele who
will be out, and has shown prom
ice of some fine play to come this
year.
Pursell at Center
At this writing it appears that
Doug Pursell will open in the cen
ter slot. If so ihe impressive
sophomore, who really surprised
everyone in spring practice, and
came back to keep up the pace in

fall drills and the Cougar game,
will be ousting regular Roch
Conklin from the spot. Conklin
had suffered a leg injury before
the WSC trip.
Rice will go with veterans Pat
Bailey and Bill Bucek at the half
back spots. They and substitutes
Sonny Searcey and Gordon Speer
have been real toss-ups for the ;
assignment. Rice is deep here.
At fullback Neely will start sen
ior yardage - eater Ray Chilton.
