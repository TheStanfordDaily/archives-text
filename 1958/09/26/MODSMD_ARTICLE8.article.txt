# University Life 'Exciting' Says Sterling
## 
### 
"I know of no more exciting
place in which to live than in a
great university," President J. E.
Wallace Sterling told the fresh
men Wednesday night at frosh
convocation in the Frost Amphi
theatre.
The Class of '62 had its first
glimpse of the educational life of
the University as the academic
procession, led by Leland Chapin,
University marshal, and Robert
Minto, chaplain, filed through the
amphitheatre.
In his address to the 1246 fresh
men, President Sterling pointed
out: "You will find much freedom
here — more than some of you
have ever had. You can enjoy it
and benefit from it, and thus en
hance your own development, or
you can abuse it. You cannot do
both. The choice is yours."
Opportunities Many
Sterling pointed out that a uni
versity offers manifold opportuni
ties for liveliness, good spirits and
a good time.
"But it is exciting in other as
pects as well," he added. "It is a
vantage point from which you can
resurvey the course which man
kind has run, for in a university
there is the accumulated knowl
edge of what man has learned and
done — knowledge which is con
stantly available for review and
reinterpretation."
Siny Hymn
A first for the Class of '62 came
at the convocation when, together
with the University Choir, mem
bers of the academic procession
and other members of the audi
ence, they joined in singing the
Stanford Hymn.
The choir offered two additional
selections — "Hallelujah, Amen"
and "Now Thank We All Our
God."
Chaplain Minto offered the in
vocation and the benediction. Or
ganist was Herbert B. Nanney.
