# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## A 						Week in a Night 
### 
Trying to got a daily newspa
per on the road after a summer
is a challenging experience, espe
cially if it must be done before
the entire staff has returned, but
entire staff has returned, but
though besieged with problems,
meetings and the like, as we are,
we find time to think of our read
ers from other than a news stand
point.
It is somewhat gratifying to be
asked, "When does The Daily
come out?" It makes us feel that
the efforts are not going unno
ticed. Just aiter the first issue
went to press early Friday morn
ing we began thinking of the
manhours (and woman hours)
which are put into The Daily each
day to insure that it will be placed
within our readers' grasp every
morning, Monday through Fri
day. Though certainly not vital
to the reading of The Daily, the
figures make an interesting com
parison.
Each night our staff is com
posed of a night editor (NE)
whose responsibility it is to de
cide what stories- and pictures
to use and where they should
be placed in the paper. An as
sistant night editor (ANE)
works closely with the NE to
see that all headlines are writ
ten and the copy is in the best
possible form.
The Daily receives news re
leases from organiations and pub
lic relations offices which must
be edited and sometimes con
densed to correspond with Daily
style. Here the copy editor <CE)
finds his job.
A similar system is in effect on
the sports side where a sports
desk editor (SDEi is in charge.
Supervising the whole night's
work is an editorial board mem
ber.
The NE, ANE, CE, SDE and
edit board member report for
work at 2:30 p.m. and remain at
the Shack until about 11:30 p.m.,
a total of nine hours apiece or 45
hours.
In addition, an estimated 30
hours are put in by reporters'
who are writing stories for the
particular issue and aiding in
the h e a d Ii n e writing, proof
reading and rewriting.
At least eight hours a day
are spent by photographers and
the darkroom technician.
Behind each day's stories is an
assignment sheet prepared by the
Managing Editor—an average of
another three hours daily. The
Sports Editor performs the same
function, and the Photo Editor
prepares a photography schedule,
another six hours daily.
Overseeing the entire process is
the Editor whose estimated time
at Ihe Shack and representing

The Daily at various meetings
totals somewhere around seven
hours a day.
So far we have a total of 99
hours and we haven't yet touched
on the business staff whose hours
collecting and writing ads, keep
ing accounts, etc., are practically
uncountable, but for our purpose
will be estimated at 32 hours a
day.
Allowing 21 hours for type
setting and page make-up in
what is known as the "Back
shop," another eight hours east
ing mats and mounting pictures
and still another eight hours
for the press run, we find the
total growing. (The last 37
hours mentioned are the work
of five professional printers.)
We cannot include but will men
tion the hours spent by the As
sociated Press in their service
here. Our teletype machine runs
11 hours daily and behind the
wire are the AP'.s crews who com
pile the news from all corners of
the world.
Let's total once again: 168
hours or one week of work for
The Daily which the reader takes
for granted with his morning cof
fee.
And how much time does the
reader spend with his Daily?
Though surveys have never been
made, we like to think of an aver
age of 10 minutes daily. At 8500
readers, we find that 1416 hours
are spent reading The Daily. This
is nearly nine times the number'
of hours spent preparing The
Daily, but the number of readers
is 188 times the number of staff
members working each day. The
average number of hours per
staff member per night is four,
compared with the 10 minutes
the reader spends between sips
of coffee the next morning.
Sounds disc o ii raging, a
week's work in one day, ending
in lining wastebaskets, but
somehow it isn't. There's some
thing different every day and
readers' compliments and criti
cisms make our work worth
while.
We make occasional mistakes
(the reader says, '"There goes
The Daily again") but they are
rare compared with our accuracy
and considering that few on the
staff have had any actual journal
istic experience prior to their
work.on The Daily. Besides we're
all human.
Speaking of humanity — those
who followed the University cal
endar instead of The Daily may
as well forget about the Rice
game; it was last Saturday, in
stead of Oct. 4 as the calendar
said. The Commiltee on Public
Exercises erred, but we're all for
giving souls.

The Daily receives news re

The NE, ANE, CE, SDE and
edit board member report for
work at 2:30 p.m. and remain at
the Shack until about 11:30 p.m.,
a total of nine hours apiece or 45
hours.
In addition, an estimated 30
hours are put in by reporters'
who are writing stories for the
particular issue and aiding in
the h e a d Ii n e writing, proof
reading and rewriting.
At least eight hours a day
are spent by photographers and
the darkroom technician.
Behind each day's stories is an
assignment sheet prepared by the
Managing Editor—an average of
another three hours daily. The
Sports Editor performs the same
function, and the Photo Editor
prepares a photography schedule,
another six hours daily.
Overseeing the entire process is
the Editor whose estimated time
at Ihe Shack and representing

The Daily at various meetings
totals somewhere around seven
hours a day.
So far we have a total of 99
hours and we haven't yet touched
on the business staff whose hours
collecting and writing ads, keep
ing accounts, etc., are practically
uncountable, but for our purpose
will be estimated at 32 hours a
day.
Allowing 21 hours for type
setting and page make-up in
what is known as the "Back
shop," another eight hours east
ing mats and mounting pictures
and still another eight hours
for the press run, we find the
total growing. (The last 37
hours mentioned are the work
of five professional printers.)
We cannot include but will men
tion the hours spent by the As
sociated Press in their service
here. Our teletype machine runs
11 hours daily and behind the
wire are the AP'.s crews who com
pile the news from all corners of
the world.
Let's total once again: 168
hours or one week of work for
The Daily which the reader takes
for granted with his morning cof
fee.
And how much time does the
reader spend with his Daily?
Though surveys have never been
made, we like to think of an aver
age of 10 minutes daily. At 8500
readers, we find that 1416 hours
are spent reading The Daily. This
is nearly nine times the number'
of hours spent preparing The
Daily, but the number of readers
is 188 times the number of staff
members working each day. The
average number of hours per
staff member per night is four,
compared with the 10 minutes
the reader spends between sips
of coffee the next morning.
Sounds disc o ii raging, a
week's work in one day, ending
in lining wastebaskets, but
somehow it isn't. There's some
thing different every day and
readers' compliments and criti
cisms make our work worth
while.
We make occasional mistakes
(the reader says, '"There goes
The Daily again") but they are
rare compared with our accuracy
and considering that few on the
staff have had any actual journal
istic experience prior to their
work.on The Daily. Besides we're
all human.
Speaking of humanity — those
who followed the University cal
endar instead of The Daily may
as well forget about the Rice
game; it was last Saturday, in
stead of Oct. 4 as the calendar
said. The Commiltee on Public
Exercises erred, but we're all for
giving souls.
Trying to got a daily newspa
per on the road after a summer
is a challenging experience, espe
cially if it must be done before
the entire staff has returned, but
entire staff has returned, but
though besieged with problems,
meetings and the like, as we are,
we find time to think of our read
ers from other than a news stand
point.
It is somewhat gratifying to be
asked, "When does The Daily
come out?" It makes us feel that
the efforts are not going unno
ticed. Just aiter the first issue
went to press early Friday morn
ing we began thinking of the
manhours (and woman hours)
which are put into The Daily each
day to insure that it will be placed
within our readers' grasp every
morning, Monday through Fri
day. Though certainly not vital
to the reading of The Daily, the
figures make an interesting com
parison.

are spent by photographers and
the darkroom technician.
Behind each day's stories is an
assignment sheet prepared by the
Managing Editor—an average of
another three hours daily. The
Sports Editor performs the same
function, and the Photo Editor
prepares a photography schedule,
another six hours daily.
Overseeing the entire process is
the Editor whose estimated time
at Ihe Shack and representing

The Daily at various meetings
totals somewhere around seven
hours a day.
So far we have a total of 99
hours and we haven't yet touched
on the business staff whose hours
collecting and writing ads, keep
ing accounts, etc., are practically
uncountable, but for our purpose
will be estimated at 32 hours a
day.
Allowing 21 hours for type
setting and page make-up in
what is known as the "Back
shop," another eight hours east
ing mats and mounting pictures
and still another eight hours
for the press run, we find the
total growing. (The last 37
hours mentioned are the work
of five professional printers.)
We cannot include but will men
tion the hours spent by the As
sociated Press in their service
here. Our teletype machine runs
11 hours daily and behind the
wire are the AP'.s crews who com
pile the news from all corners of
the world.
Let's total once again: 168
hours or one week of work for
The Daily which the reader takes
for granted with his morning cof
fee.
And how much time does the
reader spend with his Daily?
Though surveys have never been
made, we like to think of an aver
age of 10 minutes daily. At 8500
readers, we find that 1416 hours
are spent reading The Daily. This
is nearly nine times the number'
of hours spent preparing The
Daily, but the number of readers
is 188 times the number of staff
members working each day. The
average number of hours per
staff member per night is four,
compared with the 10 minutes
the reader spends between sips
of coffee the next morning.
Sounds disc o ii raging, a
week's work in one day, ending
in lining wastebaskets, but
somehow it isn't. There's some
thing different every day and
readers' compliments and criti
cisms make our work worth
while.
We make occasional mistakes
(the reader says, '"There goes
The Daily again") but they are
rare compared with our accuracy
and considering that few on the
staff have had any actual journal
istic experience prior to their
work.on The Daily. Besides we're
all human.
Speaking of humanity — those
who followed the University cal
endar instead of The Daily may
as well forget about the Rice
game; it was last Saturday, in
stead of Oct. 4 as the calendar
said. The Commiltee on Public
Exercises erred, but we're all for
giving souls.
Trying to got a daily newspa
per on the road after a summer
is a challenging experience, espe
cially if it must be done before
the entire staff has returned, but
entire staff has returned, but
though besieged with problems,
meetings and the like, as we are,
we find time to think of our read
ers from other than a news stand
point.
It is somewhat gratifying to be
asked, "When does The Daily
come out?" It makes us feel that
the efforts are not going unno
ticed. Just aiter the first issue
went to press early Friday morn
ing we began thinking of the
manhours (and woman hours)
which are put into The Daily each
day to insure that it will be placed
within our readers' grasp every
morning, Monday through Fri
day. Though certainly not vital
to the reading of The Daily, the
figures make an interesting com
parison.
Each night our staff is com
posed of a night editor (NE)
whose responsibility it is to de
cide what stories- and pictures
to use and where they should
be placed in the paper. An as
sistant night editor (ANE)
works closely with the NE to
see that all headlines are writ
ten and the copy is in the best
possible form.
The Daily receives news re
leases from organiations and pub
lic relations offices which must
be edited and sometimes con
densed to correspond with Daily
style. Here the copy editor <CE)
finds his job.
A similar system is in effect on
the sports side where a sports
desk editor (SDEi is in charge.
Supervising the whole night's
work is an editorial board mem
ber.
The NE, ANE, CE, SDE and
edit board member report for
work at 2:30 p.m. and remain at
the Shack until about 11:30 p.m.,
a total of nine hours apiece or 45
hours.
In addition, an estimated 30
hours are put in by reporters'
who are writing stories for the
particular issue and aiding in
the h e a d Ii n e writing, proof
reading and rewriting.
