# Building a 'Beta' Bonfire; 40 Days or 40 Dollars?
## 
### 
On April 1 this year The Daily
"burned down" Rossotti's—"-every
timber—and few people noticed
and nobody cared. But Thursday
morning. Sept. 24, 10 Beta Theta
Pi's burned down just v a small part
of Rossotti's —for a good cause—
and RossbHi got mad, local police
got interested and the Betas got
hooked for $40 for damages.
It all started Wednesday eve
ning when the Betas went out to
Rossotti's Beer Garden, 3915 Al
pine Road, for an outdoor party
and bonfire in Rossotti's gardens.
By 3 the next morning owner
Enrico Rossotti became curious
about what was keeping the
healthy bonfire going, and dis
covered that for combustion at 3
a.m. six are necessary:
1) Brooks C. Dyer, 21; 2i Thomas
R. Brown. 20; 3> Richard T. Wold.
23; and three picnic tables.
A few minutes later the Betas
were pointing out to deputies
from the sheriff's office the logic
behind the situation. "We ran out
of fuel," explained one. "and we

had -only the best intentions, but
there was nothing else we could
do."
Rossotti said that he wouldn't
press charges if the students
would pay S4O to replace the
tables.
Certainly, agreed the Betas.
And everyone went home think
ing about how it will be cheaper
to hold the next party at Trader
Vic's.
