# France Accepts de Gaulle's Constitution by Huge Vote
## Even Algeria Voles in Favor of New Regime; Record Number Ballot 
### 
PARIS (/P) —Premier fie Gaulle
Sunday won an overwhelming vic
tory for his new constitution and
for himself.
The vote paved the way for es
tablishment of the Fifth French
Republic with strong executive
powers. Many persons believe De
Gaulle may be the first President
of the new republic.
Complete Returns
Complete official returns from
all of France's 90 departments
gave 17,767,408 yes votes and 4,-
661,858 no votes.
There was a record turnout of
84.99 per cent of the country's
registered voters, and 78.56 per
cent of them voted yes.
Mounting returns from Algeria,
covering a tenth of the registered
voters in that rebellious area,
gave the constitution 97 per cent
approval. The count was 280,654
yes and 6459 no, with about 83
per cent of registered voters par
ticipating. From 12 to 14 per cent
of the voters stayed away in most
Algerian areas.
Secret Ballots?
The fact that the Moslems of
Algeria voted under the scrutiny
of helmeted French soldiers and
green-bereted Foreign Legion
naires clouded the Algerian re
sults somewhat.
The massive vote in France it
self was a tremendous defeat for
the Communists, the only big or
ganized opposition. They dropped
heavily and widely in voting per
centages.
The constitution offered the
overseas territories—but not Al
geria, which the French consider
a part of France proper — the
chance to declare themselves
partners under the Tricolor or
vote independence from the moth
er country.
