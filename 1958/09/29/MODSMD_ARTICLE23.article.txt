# Court May Back Lease Of Little Rock Schools
## 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (/P) Au
thorities labored Sunday to open
Little Rock's fouV high schools
quickly, but their efforts to begin
segregated classes on a private
school basis ran head-on into a
new court crisis.
The court move could result in
further delay in sending students
back to classes.
But the private school plan will
be attacked Monday morning in
Omaha, Neb. There a two-judge
federal court will hear an injunc
tion plea seeking to stop tlie Little
Rock School Board from leasing
its properties to a private corpo
ration.
Won't Open Monday
It appeared the four schools,
with their enrollment of 3,698 be
fore transfers began, cannot open
Monday because the lease still is
being negotiated. But the nego
tiators pledged all possible speed.
Classes originally were sched
uled to begin four weeks ago.
They were delayed pending court
decisions, and an opening date of
Sept. 15 was set.
Gov. Orval Faubus then closed
them before they opened. He said
he acted to prevent the same kind
of violence that occurred at Cen
tral High School last fall. The
U.S. Supreme Court had denied a
plea that integration be delayed.
Filed by ISAACP
The petition for an injunction
against the lease plan was filed
with the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals by Wiley Branton. an
attorney for the National Asso
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People.
His petition also asks that the
court prevent any transfer of

school properties without court
approval, and that Negroes he ad
mitted to any private school con
verted from a public school if the
court should approve the Little
Rock lease plan.
May ll«' Significant
Branton's petition easily could
start a whole new round of lili-

gat ion as significant as the origi
nal Supreme Court ruling that
school segregation is unconstitu
tional.
During that litigation the ques
tion of when the four schools
could open might remain in doubt.
Faubus has said he will keep any

schcJol closed if it faces forced in
tegration either by a court order
or military action.
The ballot total in Saturday's
referendum was 19,470 to 7,561 in
favor of maintaining segregation
in schools.
Negro voters obviously made
themselves felt on the integration
side of the issue, but they have
only about one-sixth of the ballot
strength of whites in Little Rock.
Greatest pro-integration vote was
in predominantly Negro precincts.

The petition for an injunction
against the lease plan was filed
with the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals by Wiley Branton. an
attorney for the National Asso
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People.
His petition also asks that the
court prevent any transfer of

school properties without court
approval, and that Negroes he ad
mitted to any private school con
verted from a public school if the
court should approve the Little
Rock lease plan.

Branton's petition easily could
start a whole new round of lili-

gat ion as significant as the origi
nal Supreme Court ruling that
school segregation is unconstitu
tional.
During that litigation the ques
tion of when the four schools
could open might remain in doubt.
Faubus has said he will keep any

schcJol closed if it faces forced in
tegration either by a court order
or military action.
The ballot total in Saturday's
referendum was 19,470 to 7,561 in
favor of maintaining segregation
in schools.
Negro voters obviously made
themselves felt on the integration
side of the issue, but they have
only about one-sixth of the ballot
strength of whites in Little Rock.
Greatest pro-integration vote was
in predominantly Negro precincts.
