# Owls: Heat? What Heat?
## 
### John Schwarz 
"Heat? Man, you don t know
what that word means until you
have run a few laps out in the 97
per cent humidity like we get
down in Houston. Why, this
weather was almost delightful."
These were the sentiments of
the highly successful Rice foot
ball team as they returned to the
clubhouse after their decisive win
over the Stanford Indians Satur
day. One might have thought the
Rice men had just won the Rose
Bowl the way the squad hooped it
up in the clubhouse.
Rice coach Jess Neely was also
extremely pleased with the after
noon's football results. His team
hadn't played too well in their
opener a week back when they
lost a 26-6 decision to LSU, but
this week Neely felt that all his
players did a fine job.
"We didn't stress too much
fancy stuff in our practices this
week, but kept to some funda
mental plays and the basic essen
tials, and it paid off. We tried to
do what we did with top effi
ciency."
Perhaps the most decisive dif
ference in the two teams, as Neely
saw it, was the much more pol
ished bench that the Owls had.
"We just had more good players
than Jack |Curtice | did, and as a
result were less tired as the heat
bore down in the second half,"
said Neely.

The only factors in the Rice at
tack which disappointed the Texas
mentor were the failure of his
three quarterbacks to generate
any kind of a passing game and
the failure of some of his defen
sive linemen to move quickly
enough.
"If we only had a quarterback
who had confidence and who could
throw, we'd be 100 per cent better.
All three of our quarterbacks—
Dueitt, Schnable and Rodgers —
can handle the ball well, and the
first two are both fine runners,
but none of them can throw any
thing like Frank Ryan or King
Hill, whom we had at quarterback
last year."
When asked if the Stanford
passing attack, which hit for nine
in a row in the first half, hurt
Rice at all, coach Neely comment
ed that too many of the passes
were too short to do a great deal
of damage, and that he'd let the
opposition have all those kind that
they wanted, provided they didn't
score.
Neely also noted that Bill Bu
cek, the boy who kicked the 30-
yard field goal, was kicking in
actual competition for the first
time. He worked on it all week
in practice, but hadn't had an ac
tual test until he successfully
scored the three-pointer in the
second quarter.
"With all this one- and two
point business, we d o n't know
exactly what's happening yet, so

we decided to try to cash in on a
few three • pointers to help out
with the one- and two-pointers,"
commented Neely.
As a reward for a job well done,
the entire Rice squad spent the
evening at Bimbo's in San Fran
cisco, where Lily St. Cyr is cur
rently appearing.

Rice coach Jess Neely was also
extremely pleased with the after
noon's football results. His team
hadn't played too well in their
opener a week back when they
lost a 26-6 decision to LSU, but
this week Neely felt that all his
players did a fine job.
"We didn't stress too much
fancy stuff in our practices this
week, but kept to some funda
mental plays and the basic essen
tials, and it paid off. We tried to
do what we did with top effi
ciency."
Perhaps the most decisive dif
ference in the two teams, as Neely
saw it, was the much more pol
ished bench that the Owls had.
"We just had more good players
than Jack |Curtice | did, and as a
result were less tired as the heat
bore down in the second half,"
said Neely.

The only factors in the Rice at
tack which disappointed the Texas
mentor were the failure of his
three quarterbacks to generate
any kind of a passing game and
the failure of some of his defen
sive linemen to move quickly
enough.
"If we only had a quarterback
who had confidence and who could
throw, we'd be 100 per cent better.
All three of our quarterbacks—
Dueitt, Schnable and Rodgers —
can handle the ball well, and the
first two are both fine runners,
but none of them can throw any
thing like Frank Ryan or King
Hill, whom we had at quarterback
last year."
When asked if the Stanford
passing attack, which hit for nine
in a row in the first half, hurt
Rice at all, coach Neely comment
ed that too many of the passes
were too short to do a great deal
of damage, and that he'd let the
opposition have all those kind that
they wanted, provided they didn't
score.
Neely also noted that Bill Bu
cek, the boy who kicked the 30-
yard field goal, was kicking in
actual competition for the first
time. He worked on it all week
in practice, but hadn't had an ac
tual test until he successfully
scored the three-pointer in the
second quarter.
"With all this one- and two
point business, we d o n't know
exactly what's happening yet, so

we decided to try to cash in on a
few three • pointers to help out
with the one- and two-pointers,"
commented Neely.
As a reward for a job well done,
the entire Rice squad spent the
evening at Bimbo's in San Fran
cisco, where Lily St. Cyr is cur
rently appearing.
"Heat? Man, you don t know
what that word means until you
have run a few laps out in the 97
per cent humidity like we get
down in Houston. Why, this
weather was almost delightful."
These were the sentiments of
the highly successful Rice foot
ball team as they returned to the
clubhouse after their decisive win
over the Stanford Indians Satur
day. One might have thought the
Rice men had just won the Rose
Bowl the way the squad hooped it
up in the clubhouse.
