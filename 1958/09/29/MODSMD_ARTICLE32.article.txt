# RICE 30, STANFORD 7
## Indians Came a Long Way— But Have a Long Way to Go 
### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
Flags are still flying at half
mast in the Stanford Indians'
camp today after the locals' 30-7
dumping at the hands of the Rice
Institute Owls on Saturday. But
there won't be as much gloom in
the village this week; or at least
there shouldn't be as much, any
way.
Coach Jack Curtice's Indians,
who may at this time have the
highest scoring tackles in the
country (it was tackle Troy Bar
bee who scored Saturday and
tackle Phil Burkland who recov
ered the Washington State fum
ble in the Cougar end /one a week
ago), came a long way over the
weekend; but it turns out there's
still a long way to go before Stan
ford chn boast a winner this sea
son. '
For two and one-half quarters
the Curtice-coached Indians put
together a fair, almost-good, of
fensive and defensive showing;
then what looked like some other
team put on those cardinal and
white uniforms and let the visit
ing Owls walk away with the big
30-7 win.
Comparatively Good
Compared to the Cards' show
ing a week previous in Pullman,
Wash., the Rice game was a good
game. Up north the Cards made
no showing whatsoever; not a
good one, not a bad one—they
just played.
On Saturday, behind sopho
more quarterback Dick Norman,
•Stanford pulled off some well-ex
ecuted plays, showed themselves
and coach Curtice that they can
look like a football team and gave
promise—or a hint of it, at least
—that it might not be a 0-10 sea
son.
There were so many factors
entering into the Stanford loss
that even Monday-morning quar
terbacks are at a loss to get all
of them in in one breath. The
heat, the Owl reserves, the lack
of depth behind whal still looks
like a semi-green Stanford first
team, an inexperienced sopho
more quarterback, a lack of de
fensive tackling and alertness,
speed, and even some sloppy of
fensive play will have to be added
to the list that starts with Nor
man and Chris Burford fumbles.
And even these don't get all of
t hem.
Some Bright Notes
But the game is over and
there's no way to wiri it back. De
spite the coast - to - coast embar
rassment it had some bright
notes, and that "inexperienced,
sophomore quarterback" was one
of the brighter.
It appeared that the Cards
were in a deep hole at the quar
terback position this year but
Norman posted a 68 per cent com
pletion mark on hitting for 17 out
of 25 and 112 yards. And he's still
really a second unit man.

Norman went the first 25 min
utes of the game, hitting nine
straight passes, before one of his
tosses fell incomplete. This
stretch included the Cards' im
pressive touchdown drive which
was bolstered by five aerials to
taling 34 yards.
Rice completed five out of
and picked up 101 yards this way,
but when you take out the Hart
man-to-Jones 69-yarder this mark
is not too impressive. And the
reason it wasn't more impressive
was that the Injun pass defense,
which fell apart under* Bobby
Newman a week before, was
sharper on Saturday — though
when the locals slip up here they
really slip.
81 Rushing Plays
Though Stanford only pulled
off 31 rushing plays on Saturday
the Cards mixed their plays well
and finally got the feel of what
they will have to work with this
season.
Without a doubt the Injuns dis
covered they have a lot to do with
their rushing game and they
probably wish they'd been able to
do something with Rice's. These
statistics tell pretty much the
whole story.
On the ground the Big Bird Ma
chine rolled up 344 yards; Stan
ford gathered in a sickly 107.
There seemed to be no holding
back Owls Dueitt (84 yards),
Chilton (55), Schneider (52),
Schnable (45) and a host of oth
ers who picked up sizeable marks
in their 54 rushing plays.
No Stops-
Rice was able to peck out yard
age anywhere it wanted. And the
damage to be done was inevitable
when it became evident that the
Card front line was leaving its
job to the secondary.
In the midst of these miserable
facts, however, a dim light shim
mers. Another sophomore, full
back Gil Dowd, came through
again as leading ground gainer
for the Cards.
Against Rice Dowd carried six
times and plowed through for a
net of 38 yards, averaging 6.3. T.
Halfbacks Roy Stephen and Dick
Bowers followed Dowd at 6.25
and 6.0 averages respectively.
It's embarrassing, though, to com
pare these to 16.6, 15.0 and 6.11
averages posted by the top Rice
bulldozers.
The fate of sidelined ends Joel
Fries and Ben Robinson is still a
question, though it has begun to*
look like these men will not see
action this year. In their places
Chris Burford and Irv Nikolai
have been impressive. Burford
grabbed five passes out of the air
and ran off with 52 yards on Sat
urday while Nikolai pulled in
four for 25 yards.
Highlights
Rice came off well in the high
lights column, grabbing off the
LONGEST RUN (Dueitt, 59

yards), the LONGEST PASS
(Ilartman-to-Jones, 69 yards), the
LONGEST PUNT (Bailey, 63
yards), and the LONGEST KICK
OFF (Bailey, 60 yards).
Despite the disappointments in
the Card line there were a couple
of Indians who showed up. Larry
Lacey, junior college transfes
from Stockton, was picked by as
sistant coach Dutch Fehring as
one of the line standouts. It was
Lacey who,grabbed Wade Rogers'

pass on the Rice 37 and brought
it to the 17.
Don Dawson, starting in place
of Russ Steele, gained a niche on
the popularity pole when he
blocked Bill Bucek's kick aftPr
the initial Owl TD.
Stanford starts today to make
plans to rake in Northwestern
next Saturday—with one consola
tion more. The Cards didn't put
anyone on the injured list after
Saturday's tussle.

net of 38 yards, averaging 6.3. T.
Halfbacks Roy Stephen and Dick
Bowers followed Dowd at 6.25
and 6.0 averages respectively.
It's embarrassing, though, to com
pare these to 16.6, 15.0 and 6.11
averages posted by the top Rice
bulldozers.
The fate of sidelined ends Joel
Fries and Ben Robinson is still a
question, though it has begun to*
look like these men will not see
action this year. In their places
Chris Burford and Irv Nikolai
have been impressive. Burford
grabbed five passes out of the air
and ran off with 52 yards on Sat
urday while Nikolai pulled in
four for 25 yards.
Highlights
Rice came off well in the high
lights column, grabbing off the
LONGEST RUN (Dueitt, 59

yards), the LONGEST PASS
(Ilartman-to-Jones, 69 yards), the
LONGEST PUNT (Bailey, 63
yards), and the LONGEST KICK
OFF (Bailey, 60 yards).
Despite the disappointments in
the Card line there were a couple
of Indians who showed up. Larry
Lacey, junior college transfes
from Stockton, was picked by as
sistant coach Dutch Fehring as
one of the line standouts. It was
Lacey who,grabbed Wade Rogers'

pass on the Rice 37 and brought
it to the 17.
Don Dawson, starting in place
of Russ Steele, gained a niche on
the popularity pole when he
blocked Bill Bucek's kick aftPr
the initial Owl TD.
Stanford starts today to make
plans to rake in Northwestern
next Saturday—with one consola
tion more. The Cards didn't put
anyone on the injured list after
Saturday's tussle.


AND ANOTHER TACKLE SCORES

Flags are still flying at half
mast in the Stanford Indians'
camp today after the locals' 30-7
dumping at the hands of the Rice
Institute Owls on Saturday. But
there won't be as much gloom in
the village this week; or at least
there shouldn't be as much, any
way.
Coach Jack Curtice's Indians,
who may at this time have the
highest scoring tackles in the
country (it was tackle Troy Bar
bee who scored Saturday and
tackle Phil Burkland who recov
ered the Washington State fum
ble in the Cougar end /one a week
ago), came a long way over the
weekend; but it turns out there's
still a long way to go before Stan
ford chn boast a winner this sea
son. '
For two and one-half quarters
the Curtice-coached Indians put
together a fair, almost-good, of
fensive and defensive showing;
then what looked like some other
team put on those cardinal and
white uniforms and let the visit
ing Owls walk away with the big
30-7 win.
Comparatively Good
Compared to the Cards' show
ing a week previous in Pullman,
Wash., the Rice game was a good
game. Up north the Cards made
no showing whatsoever; not a
good one, not a bad one—they
just played.
On Saturday, behind sopho
more quarterback Dick Norman,
•Stanford pulled off some well-ex
ecuted plays, showed themselves
and coach Curtice that they can
look like a football team and gave
promise—or a hint of it, at least
—that it might not be a 0-10 sea
son.
There were so many factors
entering into the Stanford loss
that even Monday-morning quar
terbacks are at a loss to get all
of them in in one breath. The
heat, the Owl reserves, the lack
of depth behind whal still looks
like a semi-green Stanford first
team, an inexperienced sopho
more quarterback, a lack of de
fensive tackling and alertness,
speed, and even some sloppy of
fensive play will have to be added
to the list that starts with Nor
man and Chris Burford fumbles.
And even these don't get all of
t hem.
Some Bright Notes
But the game is over and
there's no way to wiri it back. De
spite the coast - to - coast embar
rassment it had some bright
notes, and that "inexperienced,
sophomore quarterback" was one
of the brighter.
It appeared that the Cards
were in a deep hole at the quar
terback position this year but
Norman posted a 68 per cent com
pletion mark on hitting for 17 out
of 25 and 112 yards. And he's still
really a second unit man.

Norman went the first 25 min
utes of the game, hitting nine
straight passes, before one of his
tosses fell incomplete. This
stretch included the Cards' im
pressive touchdown drive which
was bolstered by five aerials to
taling 34 yards.
Rice completed five out of
and picked up 101 yards this way,
but when you take out the Hart
man-to-Jones 69-yarder this mark
is not too impressive. And the
reason it wasn't more impressive
was that the Injun pass defense,
which fell apart under* Bobby
Newman a week before, was
sharper on Saturday — though
when the locals slip up here they
really slip.
81 Rushing Plays
Though Stanford only pulled
off 31 rushing plays on Saturday
the Cards mixed their plays well
and finally got the feel of what
they will have to work with this
season.
Without a doubt the Injuns dis
covered they have a lot to do with
their rushing game and they
probably wish they'd been able to
do something with Rice's. These
statistics tell pretty much the
whole story.
On the ground the Big Bird Ma
chine rolled up 344 yards; Stan
ford gathered in a sickly 107.
There seemed to be no holding
back Owls Dueitt (84 yards),
Chilton (55), Schneider (52),
Schnable (45) and a host of oth
ers who picked up sizeable marks
in their 54 rushing plays.
No Stops-
Rice was able to peck out yard
age anywhere it wanted. And the
damage to be done was inevitable
when it became evident that the
Card front line was leaving its
job to the secondary.
In the midst of these miserable
facts, however, a dim light shim
mers. Another sophomore, full
back Gil Dowd, came through
again as leading ground gainer
for the Cards.
Against Rice Dowd carried six
times and plowed through for a
net of 38 yards, averaging 6.3. T.
Halfbacks Roy Stephen and Dick
Bowers followed Dowd at 6.25

tosses fell incomplete. This
stretch included the Cards' im
pressive touchdown drive which
was bolstered by five aerials to
taling 34 yards.
Rice completed five out of
and picked up 101 yards this way,
but when you take out the Hart
man-to-Jones 69-yarder this mark
is not too impressive. And the
reason it wasn't more impressive
was that the Injun pass defense,
which fell apart under* Bobby
Newman a week before, was
sharper on Saturday — though
when the locals slip up here they
really slip.
81 Rushing Plays
Though Stanford only pulled
off 31 rushing plays on Saturday
the Cards mixed their plays well
and finally got the feel of what
they will have to work with this
season.
Without a doubt the Injuns dis
covered they have a lot to do with
their rushing game and they
probably wish they'd been able to
do something with Rice's. These
statistics tell pretty much the
whole story.
On the ground the Big Bird Ma
chine rolled up 344 yards; Stan
ford gathered in a sickly 107.
There seemed to be no holding
back Owls Dueitt (84 yards),
Chilton (55), Schneider (52),
Schnable (45) and a host of oth
ers who picked up sizeable marks
in their 54 rushing plays.
No Stops-
Rice was able to peck out yard
age anywhere it wanted. And the
damage to be done was inevitable
when it became evident that the
Card front line was leaving its
job to the secondary.
In the midst of these miserable
facts, however, a dim light shim
mers. Another sophomore, full
back Gil Dowd, came through
again as leading ground gainer
for the Cards.
Against Rice Dowd carried six
times and plowed through for a
net of 38 yards, averaging 6.3. T.
Halfbacks Roy Stephen and Dick
Bowers followed Dowd at 6.25
and 6.0 averages respectively.
It's embarrassing, though, to com
pare these to 16.6, 15.0 and 6.11
averages posted by the top Rice
bulldozers.
The fate of sidelined ends Joel
Fries and Ben Robinson is still a
question, though it has begun to*
look like these men will not see
action this year. In their places
Chris Burford and Irv Nikolai
have been impressive. Burford
grabbed five passes out of the air
and ran off with 52 yards on Sat
urday while Nikolai pulled in
four for 25 yards.
Highlights
Rice came off well in the high
lights column, grabbing off the
LONGEST RUN (Dueitt, 59

yards), the LONGEST PASS
(Ilartman-to-Jones, 69 yards), the
LONGEST PUNT (Bailey, 63
yards), and the LONGEST KICK
OFF (Bailey, 60 yards).
Despite the disappointments in
the Card line there were a couple
of Indians who showed up. Larry
Lacey, junior college transfes
from Stockton, was picked by as
sistant coach Dutch Fehring as
one of the line standouts. It was
Lacey who,grabbed Wade Rogers'

pass on the Rice 37 and brought
it to the 17.
Don Dawson, starting in place
of Russ Steele, gained a niche on
the popularity pole when he
blocked Bill Bucek's kick aftPr
the initial Owl TD.
Stanford starts today to make
plans to rake in Northwestern
next Saturday—with one consola
tion more. The Cards didn't put
anyone on the injured list after
Saturday's tussle.


AND ANOTHER TACKLE SCORES

Flags are still flying at half
mast in the Stanford Indians'
camp today after the locals' 30-7
dumping at the hands of the Rice
Institute Owls on Saturday. But
there won't be as much gloom in
the village this week; or at least
there shouldn't be as much, any
way.
Coach Jack Curtice's Indians,
who may at this time have the
highest scoring tackles in the
country (it was tackle Troy Bar
bee who scored Saturday and
tackle Phil Burkland who recov
ered the Washington State fum
ble in the Cougar end /one a week
ago), came a long way over the
weekend; but it turns out there's
still a long way to go before Stan
ford chn boast a winner this sea
son. '
For two and one-half quarters
the Curtice-coached Indians put
together a fair, almost-good, of
fensive and defensive showing;
then what looked like some other
team put on those cardinal and
white uniforms and let the visit
ing Owls walk away with the big
30-7 win.
Comparatively Good
Compared to the Cards' show
ing a week previous in Pullman,
Wash., the Rice game was a good
game. Up north the Cards made
no showing whatsoever; not a
good one, not a bad one—they
just played.
On Saturday, behind sopho
more quarterback Dick Norman,
•Stanford pulled off some well-ex
ecuted plays, showed themselves
and coach Curtice that they can
look like a football team and gave
promise—or a hint of it, at least
—that it might not be a 0-10 sea
son.
There were so many factors
entering into the Stanford loss
that even Monday-morning quar
terbacks are at a loss to get all
of them in in one breath. The
heat, the Owl reserves, the lack
of depth behind whal still looks
like a semi-green Stanford first
team, an inexperienced sopho
more quarterback, a lack of de
fensive tackling and alertness,
speed, and even some sloppy of
fensive play will have to be added
to the list that starts with Nor
man and Chris Burford fumbles.
And even these don't get all of
t hem.
Some Bright Notes
But the game is over and
there's no way to wiri it back. De
spite the coast - to - coast embar
rassment it had some bright
notes, and that "inexperienced,
sophomore quarterback" was one
of the brighter.
It appeared that the Cards
were in a deep hole at the quar
terback position this year but
Norman posted a 68 per cent com
pletion mark on hitting for 17 out
of 25 and 112 yards. And he's still
really a second unit man.

Norman went the first 25 min
utes of the game, hitting nine
straight passes, before one of his
tosses fell incomplete. This
stretch included the Cards' im
pressive touchdown drive which
was bolstered by five aerials to

ing Owls walk away with the big
30-7 win.
Comparatively Good
Compared to the Cards' show
ing a week previous in Pullman,
Wash., the Rice game was a good
game. Up north the Cards made
no showing whatsoever; not a
good one, not a bad one—they
just played.
On Saturday, behind sopho
more quarterback Dick Norman,
•Stanford pulled off some well-ex
ecuted plays, showed themselves
and coach Curtice that they can
look like a football team and gave
promise—or a hint of it, at least
—that it might not be a 0-10 sea
son.
There were so many factors
entering into the Stanford loss
that even Monday-morning quar
terbacks are at a loss to get all
of them in in one breath. The
heat, the Owl reserves, the lack
of depth behind whal still looks
like a semi-green Stanford first
team, an inexperienced sopho
more quarterback, a lack of de
fensive tackling and alertness,
speed, and even some sloppy of
fensive play will have to be added
to the list that starts with Nor
man and Chris Burford fumbles.
And even these don't get all of
t hem.
Some Bright Notes
But the game is over and
there's no way to wiri it back. De
spite the coast - to - coast embar
rassment it had some bright
notes, and that "inexperienced,
sophomore quarterback" was one
of the brighter.
It appeared that the Cards
were in a deep hole at the quar
terback position this year but
Norman posted a 68 per cent com
pletion mark on hitting for 17 out
of 25 and 112 yards. And he's still
really a second unit man.

Norman went the first 25 min
utes of the game, hitting nine
straight passes, before one of his
tosses fell incomplete. This
stretch included the Cards' im
pressive touchdown drive which
was bolstered by five aerials to
taling 34 yards.
Rice completed five out of
and picked up 101 yards this way,
but when you take out the Hart
man-to-Jones 69-yarder this mark
is not too impressive. And the
reason it wasn't more impressive
was that the Injun pass defense,
which fell apart under* Bobby
Newman a week before, was
sharper on Saturday — though
when the locals slip up here they
really slip.
81 Rushing Plays
Though Stanford only pulled
off 31 rushing plays on Saturday
the Cards mixed their plays well
and finally got the feel of what
they will have to work with this
season.
Without a doubt the Injuns dis
covered they have a lot to do with
their rushing game and they
probably wish they'd been able to
do something with Rice's. These
statistics tell pretty much the
whole story.
On the ground the Big Bird Ma
chine rolled up 344 yards; Stan
ford gathered in a sickly 107.
There seemed to be no holding
back Owls Dueitt (84 yards),
Chilton (55), Schneider (52),
Schnable (45) and a host of oth
ers who picked up sizeable marks
in their 54 rushing plays.
No Stops-
Rice was able to peck out yard
age anywhere it wanted. And the
damage to be done was inevitable
when it became evident that the
Card front line was leaving its
job to the secondary.
In the midst of these miserable
facts, however, a dim light shim
mers. Another sophomore, full
back Gil Dowd, came through
again as leading ground gainer
for the Cards.
Against Rice Dowd carried six
times and plowed through for a
net of 38 yards, averaging 6.3. T.
Halfbacks Roy Stephen and Dick
Bowers followed Dowd at 6.25
and 6.0 averages respectively.
It's embarrassing, though, to com
pare these to 16.6, 15.0 and 6.11
averages posted by the top Rice
bulldozers.
The fate of sidelined ends Joel
Fries and Ben Robinson is still a
question, though it has begun to*
look like these men will not see
action this year. In their places
Chris Burford and Irv Nikolai
have been impressive. Burford
grabbed five passes out of the air
and ran off with 52 yards on Sat
urday while Nikolai pulled in
four for 25 yards.
Highlights
Rice came off well in the high
lights column, grabbing off the
LONGEST RUN (Dueitt, 59

yards), the LONGEST PASS
(Ilartman-to-Jones, 69 yards), the
LONGEST PUNT (Bailey, 63
yards), and the LONGEST KICK
OFF (Bailey, 60 yards).
Despite the disappointments in
the Card line there were a couple
of Indians who showed up. Larry
Lacey, junior college transfes
from Stockton, was picked by as
sistant coach Dutch Fehring as
one of the line standouts. It was
Lacey who,grabbed Wade Rogers'

pass on the Rice 37 and brought
it to the 17.
Don Dawson, starting in place
of Russ Steele, gained a niche on
the popularity pole when he
blocked Bill Bucek's kick aftPr
the initial Owl TD.
Stanford starts today to make
plans to rake in Northwestern
next Saturday—with one consola
tion more. The Cards didn't put
anyone on the injured list after
Saturday's tussle.


AND ANOTHER TACKLE SCORES

Flags are still flying at half
mast in the Stanford Indians'
camp today after the locals' 30-7
dumping at the hands of the Rice
Institute Owls on Saturday. But
there won't be as much gloom in
the village this week; or at least
there shouldn't be as much, any
way.
Coach Jack Curtice's Indians,
who may at this time have the
highest scoring tackles in the
country (it was tackle Troy Bar
bee who scored Saturday and
tackle Phil Burkland who recov
ered the Washington State fum
ble in the Cougar end /one a week
ago), came a long way over the
weekend; but it turns out there's
still a long way to go before Stan
ford chn boast a winner this sea
son. '
For two and one-half quarters
the Curtice-coached Indians put
together a fair, almost-good, of
fensive and defensive showing;
then what looked like some other
team put on those cardinal and
white uniforms and let the visit
ing Owls walk away with the big
30-7 win.
