# Conference Clubs Find Intersectionals Tough
## 
### Associated Press 
Pacific Coast Conference teams ventured deep into the intersec
tional woods over the weekend and fared no better than Little Red
Riding Hood.
True, there were a couple of upsets. UCLA beat Illinois 18-14 and
Washington knocked off powerful Minnesota 24-21. Other results

were about as expected, with the
exception of underdog Northwest
ern beating Washington State 29-
28.
And some PCC teams aren't out
of the dratted nonconferenee for
est yet. These games are sched
uled next weekend:
Washington at Ohio State, Ore
gon at Oklahoma. North Carolina
at Southern California, Stanford
at Northwestern, Washington
State at California. Idaho at Utah
and UCLA at Oregon State.
The UCLA Bruins snapped
back from last week's beating by

Pittsburgh to upset the Illini. Phil
Barstow was the game hero, rac
ing 98 yards with a pass intercep
tion for one touchdown and start
ing another TD drive with a fum
ble recovery.
Washington unrolled a first
half display of running and pass
ing power, then held off the Go
phers in the last half. A last-min
ute fumble by Minnesota helped.
At Ann Arbor, Southern Cali
fornia pulled a fourth - quarter
rally but failed to catch Michigan,
which won 20-19. Missed opportu
nities and penalties slowed but
never stopped the Trojans. If
USC learns to hold the ball it may
go a long w r ay in the PCC race.
Michigan State applied power
to overrun the University of Cali
fornia 32-12. Michigan State, scor
ing in every period, stuck mainly
to a methodical ground attack.
Northwestern an easy mark
last year in the Big Ten was too
much for favored Washington
State. Two fast touchdowns near
the end of the first half and a 61-
yard scoring run by halfback Ron
Burton were enough to stage off
a 22-point Cougar rally.
Quarterback Phil Snowden
went over from the one-yard line
in the last 30 seconds to give Mis
souri a 14-10 win over Idaho.
Oregon State, stopped four
times on the goal by Kansas
Jayhawks, persisted to win 12-0.
The Staters spent almost the en
tire game in Kansas territory.

The Staters spent almost the en
tire game in Kansas territory.
Pacific Coast Conference teams ventured deep into the intersec
tional woods over the weekend and fared no better than Little Red
Riding Hood.
True, there were a couple of upsets. UCLA beat Illinois 18-14 and
Washington knocked off powerful Minnesota 24-21. Other results

were about as expected, with the
exception of underdog Northwest
ern beating Washington State 29-
28.
And some PCC teams aren't out
of the dratted nonconferenee for
est yet. These games are sched
uled next weekend:
Washington at Ohio State, Ore
gon at Oklahoma. North Carolina
at Southern California, Stanford
at Northwestern, Washington
State at California. Idaho at Utah
and UCLA at Oregon State.
The UCLA Bruins snapped
back from last week's beating by

Pittsburgh to upset the Illini. Phil
Barstow was the game hero, rac
ing 98 yards with a pass intercep
tion for one touchdown and start
ing another TD drive with a fum
ble recovery.
Washington unrolled a first
half display of running and pass
ing power, then held off the Go
phers in the last half. A last-min
ute fumble by Minnesota helped.
At Ann Arbor, Southern Cali
fornia pulled a fourth - quarter
rally but failed to catch Michigan,
which won 20-19. Missed opportu
nities and penalties slowed but
never stopped the Trojans. If
USC learns to hold the ball it may
go a long w r ay in the PCC race.
Michigan State applied power
to overrun the University of Cali
fornia 32-12. Michigan State, scor
ing in every period, stuck mainly
to a methodical ground attack.
Northwestern an easy mark
last year in the Big Ten was too
much for favored Washington
State. Two fast touchdowns near
the end of the first half and a 61-
yard scoring run by halfback Ron
Burton were enough to stage off
a 22-point Cougar rally.
Quarterback Phil Snowden
went over from the one-yard line
in the last 30 seconds to give Mis
souri a 14-10 win over Idaho.
Oregon State, stopped four
times on the goal by Kansas
Jayhawks, persisted to win 12-0.
