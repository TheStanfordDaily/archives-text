# Owls' Depth Major Factor
## 
### Dick Barnes 
"I'd like to play them 11 to 11,"
commented Jack Curtice, and
from the looks of Rice's 30-7 whip
ping of Stanford here Saturday,
that's about the best chance his
Indians would have had to keep
up with the Owls.
The superiority of the Rice re
serves was evident to all wha
watched, and Curtice had no
doubt that it was in this area that
the Owls took charge.
A 99-degree temperature read
ing 011 the stadium floor didn't
help the Indian cause any, neces
sitating as it did frequent substi
tutions in order to keep the front
liners as fresh as possible. Troy
Barbee, Doug Pursell and Chris
Burford were particularly hard
hit by the unseasonal and unco
operative* sun, and when they
were out, Stanford fortunes suf
fered.
Despite#the bench troubles, Cur
tice post-mortemed that the Tribe
could still have turned a loose
game into a tight one but for two
key plays: Sid Garber's fumble
on a third-and-one situation that
broke up a mounting Stanford
drive, and a fumble by Burford
that almost surely cost the Cards
a second-half touchdown.
The good half of football thp
Indians turned in during the first
30 minutes was encouraging for
Curtice and his staff. He termed
it a 100 per cent improvement
over last week's debacle a I Wash
ington State and called it an
"overall good job."
Curtice praised Norman's poise,
and noted that with another two
seasons to go after the current
one, he would appear to have "the
makings of a real good quarter
back." Principal reason his com
pletion average fell in the second
half was the collapse of his pro

tection. Where the Owls had
trouble penetrating in the first
half, they swarmed through al
most untouched late in the game.
Of the running backs, Gil Dowd

, was highest on Curtice's praise
list. Offensively, ends Chris Bur
ford and Irv Nicolai impressed,
each with several fine catches of
Norman aerials.

Curtice praised Norman's poise,
and noted that with another two
seasons to go after the current
one, he would appear to have "the
makings of a real good quarter
back." Principal reason his com
pletion average fell in the second
half was the collapse of his pro

tection. Where the Owls had
trouble penetrating in the first
half, they swarmed through al
most untouched late in the game.
Of the running backs, Gil Dowd

, was highest on Curtice's praise
list. Offensively, ends Chris Bur
ford and Irv Nicolai impressed,
each with several fine catches of
Norman aerials.
"I'd like to play them 11 to 11,"
commented Jack Curtice, and
from the looks of Rice's 30-7 whip
ping of Stanford here Saturday,
that's about the best chance his
Indians would have had to keep
up with the Owls.
The superiority of the Rice re
serves was evident to all wha
watched, and Curtice had no
doubt that it was in this area that
the Owls took charge.
A 99-degree temperature read
ing 011 the stadium floor didn't
help the Indian cause any, neces
sitating as it did frequent substi
tutions in order to keep the front
liners as fresh as possible. Troy
Barbee, Doug Pursell and Chris
Burford were particularly hard
hit by the unseasonal and unco
operative* sun, and when they
were out, Stanford fortunes suf
fered.
Despite#the bench troubles, Cur
tice post-mortemed that the Tribe
could still have turned a loose
game into a tight one but for two
key plays: Sid Garber's fumble
on a third-and-one situation that
broke up a mounting Stanford
drive, and a fumble by Burford
that almost surely cost the Cards
a second-half touchdown.
The good half of football thp
Indians turned in during the first
30 minutes was encouraging for
Curtice and his staff. He termed
it a 100 per cent improvement
over last week's debacle a I Wash
ington State and called it an
"overall good job."
