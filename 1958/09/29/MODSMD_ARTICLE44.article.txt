# Playwrights To Be Aided
## 
### 
Stanford University has been
chosen by the Ford Foundation as
one of three American universi
ties to assist its "aid to strug
gling playwrights" program.
The foundation's Humanities
and Arts program plans to sub
sidize the production of 10 plays
in professional, academic and
community theaters this autumn.
One of them will be produced by
the Speech and Drama Depart
ment, according to Professor
Norman D. Philbriek.
The 10 winning playwrights
will be chosen after a nationwide
contest limited to playwrights
who have previously written but
not necessarily produced two full
length plays.
