# Freshmen Must Face Farm Fact Of Too Many Men Per Woman
## 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Comes a time in every Stanford
freshman's life when ho must face
a fact a grim, never • changing
fact of his life on The Far m: this
place has more men than women.
Seven hundred eighty-two male
newcomers got a taste of the prob
lems this simple numerical fact
can cause when they attended
their first Stanford dance a nice
little frosh Jolly •Up Saturday
riight.
It was axe • your • buddy time,
with the arithmetical ratio of
1.683 frosh men to every frosh
woman somehow inconsistent
with the accepted social and bio
logical standard of 1 to 1.
This year's Jolly-Up was actu
ally among the calmest of all
timo so far as atlempte/l break-ins
were concerned. And it wasn't
any wonder, what with J. Edgar
I Phelps' pre • rog bo y s checking
name tags, meal tickets, dance
tickets, driver's licenses and birth
! certificates and taking blood tc

before (hoy let any men into Iho
place. But their vigilance paid
off, a« most crashing attempts
failed miserably.
At first shy and clinging togeth
er in groups of three and four,
the frosh dollies took quick ad
vantage of their newly-found stat
us as belles of the campus. They
were mixed, they were mingled,
they were integrated; and they'll
probably enjoy that attention for
four years.
But back to the poor frosh male.
If he thinks competing at the 1.0-
10-l level was bad, wait until the
targets of his amour become prey
for the rest of the lurking upper
classmen and the 1.6 multiplies to
something more like -1.8.
There's something this poor vic
tim of circumstance can do, how
ever- besides detonating the Ad
missions Office, that is: he can
get a job on Pro-Reg Com and
beat everybody to the punch when
the newer and botter-than-cver
Class of 'G3 girls comes to Stan
ford next September.
