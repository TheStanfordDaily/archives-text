The jackhammers, piles of lum-
and outside bracings on sev
eral buildings on campus are all
part of a large constuction pro
gram under the auspices of the
University Planning Office.
The center of the construction
is the proposed nine-building stu
dent activity center. The first
building of the center to be com
pleted is the Florence Hellman
Dinkclspiel Memorial Auditor l
ium, dedicated in May, 1957. Con
struction is scheduled to start this
fall on a new bookstore, next
door to the present one, and a new
postoffice across the street from
the present site.. To make way for
the construction, the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity house was
moved to an adjoining lot.
Overhaul of the Memorial Court
arcades began the day after June
Commencement. Both sides of
the arcade were shored up during
the rainy season with heavy
timbers in preparation for remov
al of the roof tiles and reconstruc
tion of the roof supports. Certain
key sandstone columns on each
arcade will be dismantled and
reinstalled around a center shaft
of reinforcing steel.
Work will start this fall on the
first phase of the married student
