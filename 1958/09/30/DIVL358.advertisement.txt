No. I—Econ Made Simple
1. Supply — Kepler sells books (the inexpensive paper-bounds),
art prints, and studio cards.
2. Incentive —Kepler knows that man doesn't live by bread alone,
but he (and the little Keplers) do like to eat.
3. Demand —You read books (if required to do so), enjoy art, and
startle your friends with fantastic studio cards.
4. Free Market—Kepler wants to sell you his books, prints and
cards, but so do all other booksellers. Hence . . .
5. Advertising—Kepler prostitutes himself and the arts in order:
6. Consumption—to sell to you. ;
And that, students is BUSINESS.
