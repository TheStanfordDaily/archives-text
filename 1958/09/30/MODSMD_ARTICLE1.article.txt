### 
BULLETIN
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (/P) —
School officials in Little Kock,
in the grip of complete confu
sion, refused to say Monday
night whether the high schools
will open Tuesday morning.
WASHINGTON (/P) — The Su
preme Court told resisting South
erners and all others Monday that
"evasive schemes for segrega
tion" cannot nullify orders of the
Court. The unanimous opinion
pointed straight toward just such
things as the lease of Little
Rock's four high schools for pri
vate, segregated operation. The

Court's opinion, given in a 17-
page document, asserted:
"The constitutional rights of
children not to be discriminated
against in school admission on
grounds of race or color . . . can
neither be nullified openly and di
rectly by state legislators or state
executive or judicial officers, nor
nullified indirectly by them
through evasive schemes for seg
regation whether attempted in
geniously or ingenuously. . . .
"State support of segregated
schools through any arrange
ment, management, funds, or
property cannot be equated with
the 14th amendment's command
that no state shall deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."
Must Integrate
Meanwhile, in Omaha. Federal
Circuit Court Judges Harvey M.
Johnson and Joseph W. Wood
rough ordered Monday that the
integrated status of Little Rock
senior high schools must be re
tained.
The order was directed against
members of the Little Rock School
Board, Supt. Virgil Blossom and
"officers, agents, servants, em
ployees, attorneys and all in ac
tive concert or participation with
them."
It declared they are "restrained
from taking any further action to
transfer possession, control or op
eration. directly or indirectly, of
the senior high schools of the
Little Rock School District, or in
any way alter the status quo of
the senior high schools insofar as
their integrated status is con
cerned."
The Little Rock School Board
Monday morning transferred the
schools to a private corporation,
which intends to operate them on
a segregated basis starting today.
Open Today?
Confusion spread rapidly, not
only among the officials concern
ed but among the 3700 high school
students and their parents, as to
whether the schools would open
today.
Dr. T. J. Raney, president of the
private school corporation which
leased the high schools, said ear
lier that they would.
He stuck to that position even
after word reached Little Rock of
the decision in Omaha. He said
his attorneys advised him that the
ruling of the federal judges did
not alter the situation.
During the hearing in Omaha
Monday, Justice Department at
torney Donald Mac Guineas said
the Little Rock school lease had
been executed in haste to com
plete action before the hearing.
The court order was made ef
fective Sept. 25 apparently to nul
lify any legal advantage sought
by the quick transfer.
Hearing Soon
The restraining order is in force
until Oct. 6. when a three-judge
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
panel will meet in St. Louis to
hear the case for a temporary in
junction.
The temporary injunction would
remain in force until the general
school transfer issues are disposed
of as part, of a case initiated in
Arkansas earlier this month.
The restraining order was asked
by attorneys of the National Asso
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People on behalf of Negro
children seeking to attend Central
High School in Little Rock.
"Unless this court acts, I know
of no procedure by which we can
protect the rights of the Negro
children." NAACP chief counsel
Thurgood Marshall argued.

Dr. T. J. Raney, president of the
private school corporation which
leased the high schools, said ear

He stuck to that position even
after word reached Little Rock of
the decision in Omaha. He said
his attorneys advised him that the
ruling of the federal judges did
not alter the situation.
During the hearing in Omaha
Monday, Justice Department at
torney Donald Mac Guineas said
the Little Rock school lease had
been executed in haste to com
plete action before the hearing.
The court order was made ef

Hearing Soon
The restraining order is in force

Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
panel will meet in St. Louis to

junction.
The temporary injunction would
remain in force until the general

of as part, of a case initiated in

The restraining order was asked
by attorneys of the National Asso

High School in Little Rock.
"Unless this court acts, I know

BULLETIN
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (/P) —
School officials in Little Kock,
in the grip of complete confu

night whether the high schools
will open Tuesday morning.
WASHINGTON (/P) — The Su
preme Court told resisting South
erners and all others Monday that
"evasive schemes for segrega
tion" cannot nullify orders of the
Court. The unanimous opinion
pointed straight toward just such
things as the lease of Little
Rock's four high schools for pri
vate, segregated operation. The

Court's opinion, given in a 17-
page document, asserted:
"The constitutional rights of
children not to be discriminated
against in school admission on
grounds of race or color . . . can
neither be nullified openly and di
rectly by state legislators or state
executive or judicial officers, nor
nullified indirectly by them
through evasive schemes for seg
regation whether attempted in
geniously or ingenuously. . . .
"State support of segregated
schools through any arrange
ment, management, funds, or
property cannot be equated with
the 14th amendment's command
that no state shall deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."

Meanwhile, in Omaha. Federal
Circuit Court Judges Harvey M.
Johnson and Joseph W. Wood
rough ordered Monday that the
integrated status of Little Rock
senior high schools must be re
tained.
The order was directed against
members of the Little Rock School
Board, Supt. Virgil Blossom and
"officers, agents, servants, em
ployees, attorneys and all in ac

them."
It declared they are "restrained
from taking any further action to
transfer possession, control or op
eration. directly or indirectly, of
the senior high schools of the
Little Rock School District, or in
any way alter the status quo of
the senior high schools insofar as
their integrated status is con

The Little Rock School Board
Monday morning transferred the
schools to a private corporation,
which intends to operate them on
a segregated basis starting today.
