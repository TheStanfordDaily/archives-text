## The 						Fifth Republic

TllF. atom age, tlie Spare Age, ami now tlx* Fifth Republic.
French voters have overwhelmingly placed their trust in
Charles de Gaulle, the 67-year-ohl World War II leader who came
out of retirement to take power last May. I hey have approved
his proposed constitution, with its strong executive, and have
given him almost dictatorial powers for the coming four months
in order lo get it into operation.
The powers of the multi-party system which has caused the
fall of 25 governments since World War II have been clipped.
The President of the republic will appoint the premier and the
ministers ol state. Ihe premier will still be responsible lo the
National Assembly under the new constitution, which will take
effect wilh ils publication in the official journal Sunday.
More stability for the French government is I)e Gaulle's aim
in writing the constitution. It is feared in some quarters that lliis
stability will end in a dictatorship by De Gaulle. Ihe new consti
tution gives him complete power in a "national crisis. What he
v. ill do with his power remains to be seen.
Hut one of the most encouraging results of the French vote is
the massive blow dealt to the Communists. The Keds have con
stantly gained seals in the National Assembly since the war. I*or
instance, in 1950 they held 99 seats, while in 1956 they had 144.
To Americans this should be gratifying. While the campaign
against Communists in this country is being conducted more
quietly than in the past, much of the nation still harbors a deep
fear of the Keds in our midst. Accompanying this is the fear that
our allies might turn to the Communist camp.
I)e Gaulle's victory erases this possibility for the time being,
bul even the French are aware of the changeable quality of the
French voters. Elections to the new National Assembly must now
take place, and then it will be possible to gauge the amount of
damage done to the French Communist party.
