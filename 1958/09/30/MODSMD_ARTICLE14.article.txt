THE BURG—"Ich freue mich
Sie kennenzulernen" was the sen
tence all 63 of us feverishly re
peated under our breaths as the
Air France plane broke through
ihe clouds and neared the Stutt
gart airport.
Expecting some exotic German
phrase from the trim, green-clad
customs officer, we were some
what disappointed when he stern
ly asked in good English as he
walked up the aisle of the plane,
"Have you any coffee or tea?"
After a confident "nein," we piled
off the plane and into the airport
to find wine and Coca-Cola wait
ing.
As a part of the informal cere
monies, the American Consul
made a short welcoming speech
and the American Forces Network
(AFN) interviewed a few stu
dents. But the rest of us busied
ourselves with our glasses.
Waiting Busses
Two busses from Herr Danne
man of Strumpfelbach, with
whom we have become good
friends and in whose recent wed
ding several of us marched, were
waiting outside to transport the
group to The Burg.
While we on one bus were peer
ing out the windows at the threat
ening skies, Karl Saeger, a resi
dent of Stuttgart and the student
al the Technical School, gave us
a Griiss Gott greeting (the typical
greeting of the Swabian people)
and welcomed us to the "City be
tween Forest and Vineyard."
The busses went through Stutt
gart and entered the Remstal
(valley of the Rems river). Bad-
Cannstatt, Fellbach, Waiblingen,
Rommelshausen, Stetten, Ender
sbach and Beutelsbach passed by,
names which undoubtedly will be
familiar to all future passengers
of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.
Passing out of Beutelsbach vue
were all surprised and pleased to
see some of Dr. Strothmann's
h a n d i work: two strategically
p lace d "Stanford-in-Germany"
signs.
Precarious Hide
After what seemed a precarious
ride up the narrow and twisting
road, we arrived at Landgut Burg
in time to have an Abendessen
that gut schmeckte.
With the help of Dr. Boerner,
our resident director and der gute
Geist des Hauses, the turmoil of
finding our rooms and where
everything was located passed.

We all settled down to the enjoy
able routine of The Burg, includ
ing four meals a day with tea at
four.
(However, this is a sore point
at the moment, as there is a minor
war going on between the "Brot
chen for breakfast" faction which
favors retaining tea and the
"Eggs for Breakfast" forces who
want to sacrifice tea and Kuehen
for morning Eier.
This very important point has
not yet been decided, and as we
left for our between quarter
break, the number stood at 28 to
28. Perhaps in the next communi
que we can give you the results
of this long, drawn-out conflict
which Dr. Strothmann is calmly
refereeing.)
Opening Rites
During the first days most of
our attention was focused on the
opening ceremonies which were
held June 24.
Looking back at the friendships
we all have made these past three
months and forward to their con
tinuance next quarter, President
Sterling's statement opening day
was a fitting preface:
"You made us feel welcome
even before we had arrived, and
since we have come, you have
made us feel that you are glad to
have us here."
President Sterling spoke to a
crowded classroom, for despite
the rainy weather opening day,
nearly all of the invited guests
arrived, including the Oberbur
germeister of Stuttgart and the
Btirgermeister of Beutelsbach.
As the cars pulled into the park
ing lot, we organized an umbrella
brigade with our 30 Madle as
pretty guides to the classroom,
where the major part of the cere
monies was held amidst a maze
of radio and TV wiring.
Tree Planted
Culminating the ceremonies
was the planting of the Sequoia
tree or Mammut Baum President
Sterling brought with him from
Palo Alto. At first the two foot
Mammut Baum (mammoth tree)
disappeared in the three-foot hole,
but a hasty shovel remedied the
oversight and the ceremony fit
tingly ended with us singing the
"Alma Mater."
The only disappointing thing
about the opening day was the
drizzle. The wet weather pre
vented the guests from touring
the grounds which had been met
iculously manicured the previous
day or Werktag. Die Knaben,had
trimmed the hedges and die Mad
chen had put flowers in all the
rooms, while everyone swept up
afterwards with great zeal.
Nevertheless, although most of
the effort went unnoticed by our
guests, we all left the Burg for a
five-day vacation before classes
began with clear consciences and
anticipation of new experiences.

THE BURG—"Ich freue mich
Sie kennenzulernen" was the sen
tence all 63 of us feverishly re
peated under our breaths as the
Air France plane broke through
ihe clouds and neared the Stutt
gart airport.
Expecting some exotic German
phrase from the trim, green-clad
customs officer, we were some
what disappointed when he stern
ly asked in good English as he
walked up the aisle of the plane,
"Have you any coffee or tea?"
After a confident "nein," we piled
off the plane and into the airport
to find wine and Coca-Cola wait
ing.
As a part of the informal cere
monies, the American Consul
made a short welcoming speech
and the American Forces Network
(AFN) interviewed a few stu
dents. But the rest of us busied
ourselves with our glasses.
Waiting Busses
Two busses from Herr Danne
man of Strumpfelbach, with
whom we have become good
friends and in whose recent wed
ding several of us marched, were
waiting outside to transport the
group to The Burg.
While we on one bus were peer
ing out the windows at the threat
ening skies, Karl Saeger, a resi
dent of Stuttgart and the student
al the Technical School, gave us
a Griiss Gott greeting (the typical
greeting of the Swabian people)
and welcomed us to the "City be
tween Forest and Vineyard."
The busses went through Stutt
gart and entered the Remstal
(valley of the Rems river). Bad-
Cannstatt, Fellbach, Waiblingen,
Rommelshausen, Stetten, Ender
sbach and Beutelsbach passed by,
names which undoubtedly will be
familiar to all future passengers
of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.
Passing out of Beutelsbach vue
were all surprised and pleased to
see some of Dr. Strothmann's
h a n d i work: two strategically
p lace d "Stanford-in-Germany"
signs.
Precarious Hide
After what seemed a precarious
ride up the narrow and twisting
road, we arrived at Landgut Burg
in time to have an Abendessen
that gut schmeckte.
With the help of Dr. Boerner,
our resident director and der gute
Geist des Hauses, the turmoil of
finding our rooms and where
everything was located passed.

We all settled down to the enjoy
able routine of The Burg, includ
ing four meals a day with tea at
four.
(However, this is a sore point
at the moment, as there is a minor
war going on between the "Brot
chen for breakfast" faction which
favors retaining tea and the
"Eggs for Breakfast" forces who
want to sacrifice tea and Kuehen
for morning Eier.
This very important point has
not yet been decided, and as we
left for our between quarter
break, the number stood at 28 to
28. Perhaps in the next communi
que we can give you the results
of this long, drawn-out conflict
which Dr. Strothmann is calmly
refereeing.)
Opening Rites
During the first days most of
our attention was focused on the
opening ceremonies which were
held June 24.
Looking back at the friendships
we all have made these past three
months and forward to their con
tinuance next quarter, President
Sterling's statement opening day
was a fitting preface:
"You made us feel welcome
even before we had arrived, and
since we have come, you have
made us feel that you are glad to
have us here."
President Sterling spoke to a
crowded classroom, for despite
the rainy weather opening day,
nearly all of the invited guests
arrived, including the Oberbur
germeister of Stuttgart and the
Btirgermeister of Beutelsbach.
As the cars pulled into the park
ing lot, we organized an umbrella
brigade with our 30 Madle as
pretty guides to the classroom,
where the major part of the cere
monies was held amidst a maze
of radio and TV wiring.
Tree Planted
Culminating the ceremonies
was the planting of the Sequoia
tree or Mammut Baum President
Sterling brought with him from
Palo Alto. At first the two foot
Mammut Baum (mammoth tree)
disappeared in the three-foot hole,
but a hasty shovel remedied the
oversight and the ceremony fit
tingly ended with us singing the
"Alma Mater."
The only disappointing thing
about the opening day was the
drizzle. The wet weather pre
vented the guests from touring
the grounds which had been met
iculously manicured the previous
day or Werktag. Die Knaben,had
trimmed the hedges and die Mad
chen had put flowers in all the
rooms, while everyone swept up
afterwards with great zeal.
Nevertheless, although most of
the effort went unnoticed by our
guests, we all left the Burg for a
five-day vacation before classes
began with clear consciences and
anticipation of new experiences.

Air France plane broke through
ihe clouds and neared the Stutt
gart airport.
Expecting some exotic German
phrase from the trim, green-clad
customs officer, we were some
what disappointed when he stern
ly asked in good English as he
walked up the aisle of the plane,
"Have you any coffee or tea?"
After a confident "nein," we piled
off the plane and into the airport
to find wine and Coca-Cola wait
ing.
As a part of the informal cere
monies, the American Consul
made a short welcoming speech
and the American Forces Network
(AFN) interviewed a few stu
dents. But the rest of us busied
ourselves with our glasses.
Waiting Busses
Two busses from Herr Danne
man of Strumpfelbach, with
whom we have become good
friends and in whose recent wed
ding several of us marched, were
waiting outside to transport the
group to The Burg.
While we on one bus were peer
ing out the windows at the threat
ening skies, Karl Saeger, a resi
dent of Stuttgart and the student
al the Technical School, gave us
a Griiss Gott greeting (the typical
greeting of the Swabian people)
and welcomed us to the "City be
tween Forest and Vineyard."
The busses went through Stutt
gart and entered the Remstal
(valley of the Rems river). Bad-
Cannstatt, Fellbach, Waiblingen,
Rommelshausen, Stetten, Ender
sbach and Beutelsbach passed by,
names which undoubtedly will be
familiar to all future passengers
of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.
Passing out of Beutelsbach vue
were all surprised and pleased to
see some of Dr. Strothmann's
h a n d i work: two strategically
p lace d "Stanford-in-Germany"
signs.
Precarious Hide
After what seemed a precarious
ride up the narrow and twisting
road, we arrived at Landgut Burg
in time to have an Abendessen
that gut schmeckte.
With the help of Dr. Boerner,
our resident director and der gute
Geist des Hauses, the turmoil of
finding our rooms and where
everything was located passed.

We all settled down to the enjoy
able routine of The Burg, includ
ing four meals a day with tea at
four.
(However, this is a sore point
at the moment, as there is a minor
war going on between the "Brot
chen for breakfast" faction which
favors retaining tea and the
"Eggs for Breakfast" forces who
want to sacrifice tea and Kuehen
for morning Eier.
This very important point has
not yet been decided, and as we
left for our between quarter
break, the number stood at 28 to
28. Perhaps in the next communi
que we can give you the results
of this long, drawn-out conflict
which Dr. Strothmann is calmly
refereeing.)
Opening Rites
During the first days most of
our attention was focused on the
opening ceremonies which were
held June 24.
Looking back at the friendships
we all have made these past three
months and forward to their con
tinuance next quarter, President
Sterling's statement opening day
was a fitting preface:
"You made us feel welcome
even before we had arrived, and
since we have come, you have
made us feel that you are glad to
have us here."
President Sterling spoke to a
crowded classroom, for despite
the rainy weather opening day,
nearly all of the invited guests
arrived, including the Oberbur
germeister of Stuttgart and the
Btirgermeister of Beutelsbach.
As the cars pulled into the park
ing lot, we organized an umbrella
brigade with our 30 Madle as
pretty guides to the classroom,
where the major part of the cere
monies was held amidst a maze
of radio and TV wiring.
Tree Planted
Culminating the ceremonies
was the planting of the Sequoia
tree or Mammut Baum President
Sterling brought with him from
Palo Alto. At first the two foot
Mammut Baum (mammoth tree)
disappeared in the three-foot hole,
but a hasty shovel remedied the
oversight and the ceremony fit
tingly ended with us singing the
"Alma Mater."
The only disappointing thing
about the opening day was the
drizzle. The wet weather pre
vented the guests from touring
the grounds which had been met
iculously manicured the previous
day or Werktag. Die Knaben,had
trimmed the hedges and die Mad
chen had put flowers in all the
rooms, while everyone swept up
afterwards with great zeal.
Nevertheless, although most of
the effort went unnoticed by our
guests, we all left the Burg for a
five-day vacation before classes
began with clear consciences and
anticipation of new experiences.
