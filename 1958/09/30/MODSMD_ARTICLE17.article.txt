# Health Service Ready to Go With Flu, Polio Vaccinations
## 
### 
Large quantities of flu and
polio vaccine are now available to
students, announces Dr. George
Houck, Health Service director.
Although a flu epidemic such
as last year's is unlikely, Dr.
Houck encouraged two groups of
students to take advantage of the
free flu vaccine: those who had
some vaccine last year or who
had flu so that their immunity is
now gone, who need only one in
jection, and those who had no
vaccine last year, who need two
injections, a week apart.
Polio vaccine, for which stu
dents pay $1 .23 per injection,
cannot be given within two
weeks of any other vaccine. This
series consists of three injections,
the second being one month after
the first, the third, seven months
later. A fourth injection has not
yet been determined necessary,
Dr. Houck stated.
Students are urged to get the
vaccine today and Wednesday be
fore the freshman physicals cause

an increased rush of activity. The
Health Center is open from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
