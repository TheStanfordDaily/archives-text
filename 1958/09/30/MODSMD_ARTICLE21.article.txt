## France Thoughtful as De Gaulle Assumes Power 
### 
PARIS (A')- The power of Premier rle Gaulle was bolstered Mon
day by the greatest vote of approval since Frenchmen succumbed to
the charm of Napoleon 111 a century ago. Some Frenchmen were
having sober second thoughts.
De Gaulle's overwhelming 4-1 victory margin for his constitution

for the Fifth Republic sent the
Paris stock market up. Police
relaxed after the pre-referendum
battles with Algerian terrorists.
Aver a g e Frenchmen breathed
sighs of relief.
But this giant victory for De
Gaulle, in which French Commu
nists suffered a crushing blow—
and the tremendous powers voted
into his hands for the next four
months — weighed heavily on
some French minds.
The editor of the respected
Paris newspaper Le Monde, Hu
bert Beuve - Mery, noted soberly
lhat De Gaulle's powers now have
"no other limit than the wisdom
of a man."
De Gaulle, back at his desk
after hearing the first results in
the seclusion of his country home,
moved immediately to keep prom
ises made during his sweeping
campaign for a constitution with
strong executive powers.
lie dispatched a communique
to Premier Sekou Toure of
French Guinea recognizing that
that territory nestled on the rain
swept West Coast of Northwest
Africa had voted for independ
ence.
The communique curtly told
Toure that French administrators
would get out within the next two
months and that French econom
ic aid would be cut off.
