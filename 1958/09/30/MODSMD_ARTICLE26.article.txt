# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
The iiig Question
The big question in Stanford football this week—and it's a natu
ral one, considering the results of the first two games—is what are
ilu? prospects for breaking into the victory column this year?
A quick glance at the 40-6 and 30-7 figures on the scoreboard
could make the prospects for the rest ol the season look pretty dim.
But fortunately, Jack Curtice's men did get in a good half of football
against Kite, and showed plenty of improvement over their miser
able opening effort against Washington Stale.
What's evident, however, is that there will have to be at least
again as much improvement this week against Northwestern if the
locals want to have much of a chance to ring up something on the
win side.
Before the season began, the Indians' schedule looked made to
order' for a team that obviously needed rebuilding in certain spots and
also needed to learn the new system of a new coach. With two fairly
tough but not impossible games in the opening weeks, it appeared
that Curtice would have ample chance to see just where his team
would need bolstering.
The two openers were tough, all right—a good deal tougher than
most observers anticipated. But during the pre-season glance at the
schedule, Ihese next three games looked to be just what the doctor
would order for Stanford—three relatively weak opponents against
whom the Cards would be able to try all the new tricks in their
book and against whom they could probably pick up enough confi
dence in their own abilities to carry through against the live tougher
opponents on the final half of the slate.
So what happens but the three supposedly-weak sisters, North
western, Washington and the Air Force, all turn out to have teams
ili.il aren't soft touches for anybody -especially Stanford.
There's a very direct, and not too encouraging, comparison which
shows what the Wildcats can do. One week after WSC routs the
Cards, NW turns around and smacks down Bobby Newman and his
mates, 29-28. To be sure, the game was played in friendly Evanston—
but that's just where the Indians have to go.
Washington, winner of only three games last year, was Ihe con
sensus pick for the PCC cellar at the start of the year. So what do
the Huskies do but bounce a fairly decent Minnesota team. 24-21.
And past experience shows that an PCC team which licks a Big 10
club has to be reckoned with.
That leaves the Air Force, a relatively new club on the nation's
football horizon, and one that has seniors for the first time in its
short history. The Flyboys didn't show much last year in an outing
against UCLA, and they've got the same team back. But that impor
tant factor called experience has apparently worked wonders, be
cause the Air Force opened up the current slate with a rousing 37-6
victory over Detroit. Of course that's Detroit U. and not the Lions,
but the dope from the Midwest was that they had a pretty good club.
Conditioning llie Answer
But still the question—what's the future for the Cards? There
won'l be any soft touches against whom to experiment, and the team
as it stands is obviously not a winner.
Curtice probably had the best answer to the situation as he re
flected in the locker room following Saturday's scorchesr. He noted
lhat lhe first unit would simply have to get itself in good enough
shape to stand the gaff of 50- or 60-minute football. Why? Because
the Stanford bencn is simply not strong enough to effectively contain
I lie opposition while the firsts get a break.
Physical conditioning isn't the only problem Curtice will have in
Hie condition department: there's the problem of mental condition
ing.
He recognized this himself on Saturday, observing that "Well
have to get hard mentally as well as physically."
it's this mental situation which could be a key to Stanford's prob
lem of needing improvement. Specifically, the Indians will have to
not give up if they're interested in winning this year. Sure, it's a
lot harder to come back from a pair of one-sided losses than from
some sweet victories. But the improvements the team did come up
with against Rice should serve as sufficient encouragement to help
u come up with as good a relative improvement against this week's
foe. Like the Cactus man said, "We'll get somebody if they don't
give up."
SUDDEN THOUGHT—I'm pretty aggravated at Sports Illus
trated for mentioning Stanford's name on their cover. After all, it
was only a year ago that I specifically asked them not to do that,
after seeing what happened to Bobby Cox and Oklahoma. Seriously,
though, their article on new head man Curtice was well done, al
-1 hough it did make Stanford sound a bit too hepped up on losing all
Ihe time. But Ihen maybe SI will sometime do a piece on our win
ning teams, like the golfers, swimmers and tennismen. Or something
on Dutch Feb ring's power hitters. Then, too, I'm looking for Howie
Dullmar's gang to kick up a bit of a winning storm this winter.
GOOD NEWS The word that Dick Stanford and his yell leading
out fit have adopted realism as their byword is mighty welcome. Now
if they can just do an effective job of keeping Ihe yelling in line with
the lempo of the game situation, and also not feel obligated to yell
Iwice per play, the Indian rooting situation will be in good shape.
