# No New injuries as Cards Prepare for Northwestern
## 
### 
Stanford may not have won
Saturday's Rice game, hut Jack
Curtice's boys did win their week
ly battle against old man injury.
And it was a shutout for the
Cards as no one suffered any
thing that will keep him out of
action Saturday when Stanford
takes the long trek to Evanston,
111., to meet Northwestern.
A day or two of lighter-than
usual workouts for the heat pros
tration victims of Saturday has
been lined up by trainer Connie
Jarvis, but that's about the extent
of the trouble.
The news isn't quite so good as
regards Ben Robinson and Joel
Freis, hurt before the opener, and
Bob Nicolet, who was racked up
in the Washington State game.
Awaiting
The final verdict still hasn't
come in yet, but it now looks as
though the two veteran ends will
be out for the year. Freis, victim,
of a muscle split, has the better
chance of the two to see a bit of
action at season's, end, but his
chance is a slim one.
Robinson is almost assuredly
out for the year, and may even
have to be operated on by the
time Big Game rolls around. He
was at first thought to have liga
ment trouble, but now the diag
nosticians aren't sure just what
the problem is in the vicinity of
his troubled knee.
Nicolet Belter
Nicolet is quite a bit better off,
although still bothered by his
shoulder pointer. He may he well
enough to throw a little by the
end of the week, but the condi
tion of his arm would not be good
enough to risk using him against
the Wildcats.
He should be ready to go by the
time Washington invades the
local arena Oct. 11.
Stanford is expected to find it
self at least a one-touchdown un
derdog against a Northwestern
team that originally figured as
the doormat of the Big Ten.

The 'Cats didn't win anything j
last fall, dropping a 26-6 decision
to the Cards in the Stanford Sta
dium in the process. Ara Parseg
hian has apparently done a good
deal of overhauling of his club,
because it was strong enough to
upset Washington State, 29-28, in
Saturday's opener.

The 'Cats didn't win anything j
last fall, dropping a 26-6 decision
to the Cards in the Stanford Sta
dium in the process. Ara Parseg
hian has apparently done a good
deal of overhauling of his club,
because it was strong enough to
upset Washington State, 29-28, in
Saturday's opener.
Stanford may not have won
Saturday's Rice game, hut Jack
Curtice's boys did win their week
ly battle against old man injury.
And it was a shutout for the
Cards as no one suffered any
thing that will keep him out of
action Saturday when Stanford
takes the long trek to Evanston,
111., to meet Northwestern.
A day or two of lighter-than
usual workouts for the heat pros
tration victims of Saturday has
been lined up by trainer Connie
Jarvis, but that's about the extent
of the trouble.
The news isn't quite so good as
regards Ben Robinson and Joel
Freis, hurt before the opener, and
Bob Nicolet, who was racked up
in the Washington State game.
Awaiting
The final verdict still hasn't
come in yet, but it now looks as
though the two veteran ends will
be out for the year. Freis, victim,
of a muscle split, has the better
chance of the two to see a bit of
action at season's, end, but his
chance is a slim one.
Robinson is almost assuredly
out for the year, and may even
have to be operated on by the
time Big Game rolls around. He
was at first thought to have liga
ment trouble, but now the diag
nosticians aren't sure just what
the problem is in the vicinity of
his troubled knee.
Nicolet Belter
Nicolet is quite a bit better off,
although still bothered by his
shoulder pointer. He may he well
enough to throw a little by the
end of the week, but the condi
tion of his arm would not be good
enough to risk using him against
the Wildcats.
He should be ready to go by the
time Washington invades the
local arena Oct. 11.
Stanford is expected to find it
self at least a one-touchdown un
derdog against a Northwestern
team that originally figured as
the doormat of the Big Ten.
