ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH
Today begins my fifth year of writing this column, and what an
eventful five years it has been! What things have these old eyes
not seen! What great discoveries have rocked the world—the
anti-proton, for instance, and the anti-neutron, and high-low
split, and Brigitte Bardotl
In these five years it has also been discovered that American
smokers like two kinds of cigarettes—filter and non-filter. 1 he
Philip Morris Company makes both kinds. I mention the
Philip Morris Company because they pay me to mention the
Philip Morris Company. They sponsor this column. I write it
and then they give me money. Then I take the money and pay
my grocer, my butcher, my gardener, and my four madrigal
singers. In this way full employment is maintained and w<*
avoid a repetition of the Panic of 1873 when bread riots killed
over 98 million people in Muncie, Indiana, and millions of others
were reduced to ghost-writing Ph. D. theses to keep body and
soul together.
But enough of gloom. Let us get back to cheerful subjects,
like the products of the Philip Morris Company. For those of
you who wish filter cigarettes there is Marlboro, which now,
more than ever, gives you a lot to like —a brand new improved
filter and a wonderful flavor that comes breezing right through.
For those of you who wish non-filter cigarettes, there is Philip
Morris, a mild natural blend, flavorful, fresh, and thoroughly
agreeable. For those of you who can't decide between filters or
non-filters but have an affinity for packages, I should like to
point out that both Marlboro and Philip Morris come in both
the crashproof Flip-Top Box and the good old-fashioned Soft
Pack, and you will surely want several of each for your collection.
Speaking for myself, I smoke both Marlboro and Philip
Morris in both packs. What I do is make kind of a fun thing
out of it. In my bedroom I have four signs, one on each wall,
which say in turn: "PHILIP MORRIS-SOFT PACK",
fPHILIP MORRIS-FLIP-TOP," "MARLBORO—SOFT
PACK" and "MARLBORO-FLIP-TOP". When I get up in
the morning I put on a blindfold and then my faithful cat Rover
spins me around six times and then, with many a laugh and
cheer, I walk forward with my finger outstretched and the first
sign I touch is the cigarette I smoke that day 1

As you can imagine, this little game has been a great, source
of merriment to Rover and me, except for one untoward in
cident one morning. I was stumbling around in my blindfold
and fell out the window right on top of a man named 1 red R.
Timken, a census taker, and broke all his lead pencils. Tie was
cross as a bear, and though I offered him both Philip Morris
and Marlboro in both the Flip-Top Box and Soft Pack, he
refused to be mollified. In fact, he refused to put my name
down in the census, so when you read population figures of the
United States, will you please add one?
But T digress. We were speaking of Philip Morris and
Marlboro who w ill bring you this column throughout the school
year. In this space 1 will take up vital aspects of undergraduate
"life, like high-low split and Brigitte Bardot, and it is my fondest
hope that the column will be half as much fun for you as it is
for me. • Mm Shu,,n,M »
