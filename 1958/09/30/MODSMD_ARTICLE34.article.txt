# â€˜Lone Women' Now Allowed To Enter Men's Residences
## 
### 
Women's Council Chairman
Laura Kassoff announced Mon
day that women are not allowed
above the first floor of any men's
residence. The social regulations

state, "A woman may enter the
downstairs social area of a man's
residence. The act of entering
this area is in itself neither ac
ceptable nor unacceptable; it be
comes unacceptable when a wom
an's conduct is inconsistent with
the Fundamental Standard."
The rule was written to replace
the "lone woman rule" that has
been in effect in the past. The
latter rule required that any
woman must be accompanied by
another even if she only wished
to hang a poster.
It is emphasized that the new
rule involves no question of mor
als; the regulation is designed to
protect the privacy of the men's
residence living area.
If any men's group wishes to
have a specific open house or spe
cific open house hours weekly, it
is asked to register any such de
cision with ASSU Vice-President
Clee Houser.
