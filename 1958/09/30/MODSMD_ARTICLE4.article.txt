# Bullet Pierces Senior's Chest
## 
### 
John R. Daniels, a senior pre
med student, was shot in the
chest Sunday by a target pistol he
was carrying. The bullet entered
his chest, missed his windpipe by
less than an inch, and lodged in
his shoulder.
Daniels will be able to register
for classes Friday, according to
doctors at Peninsula Hospital
where he was taken for treat
ment.
Daniels' mother, Mrs. Dorothy
Daniels, said her son had just re
turned from a hiking trip and was
carrying some gear, including the
target pistol, from his Burlin
gamc home to a nearby garage.
The safety catch was on prior to
the accident, said Mrs. Daniels.
