## Reds Claim U.S. Missile Hit Plane 
### 
TOKYO (/P)—Red China claims
one of its warplanes has been
knocked down by an American
Sidewinder missile fired from a
Nationalist China plane.
A Peiping radio broadcast
heard in Tokyo Monday said the
action ocurred last Wednesday.
It was the first time the Commu
nists have charged the National
ists with using the U.S. Navy
made air-to-air guided missile.
There has been speculation that
the Nationalists were using Side
winders, but Nationalist Air
Force officials have denied the re
ports.
Peiping said parts of missiles
were found near Wenchow, in
cluding the nose that receives in
frared rays that help guide the
missile to its target. The missile
parts have been put on exhibition
in Peiping, the broadcast said.
In Washington, the Pentagon
wouldn't say yes or no when
asked whether the Chinese Na
tionalists do have Sidewinders.

TAIPEI (/P)—President Chiang
Kai-shek told a rare news confer
ence Monday he would send his
bombers against the mainland
only if that is necessary to save
the soldiers and civilians on Que
moy.
"There will also be no call for
American ground forces," he said.
"All we expect from our Ameri
can friends is material and moral
support and such naval and air
support as they are giving us to
day."
The 71-year-old leader's pledge
to strike back at Red China only
as a last, dire resort appears to be
a bow to public opinion in the
United States.
