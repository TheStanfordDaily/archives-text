## Rocket Fuel Experiment Blows Up 
### 
Ronald Schneider, recipient of
the Outstanding Freshman Chem
istry Award last year, was almost
fatally injured Monday evening
when an experiment he was con
ducting in his Redlands home lab
oratory blew up.
Schneider, whose Stanford rec
ord as a General Motors scholar
is described by Professor Hutch
inson of the Chemistry Depart
ment as "brilliant" and "remark
able," has lost the end of hi-s right
thumb, all of his right index fin
ger and the ends of two more
fingers.
His legs and chest are seriously
burned and his abdomen riddled
with glass fragments. One eye
has been injured but will proba
bly be saved; the other is com
pletely unharmed.
The experiment was one which
Schneider had performed many
times before, but it was "extreme
ly dangerous," according to Hut
chinson. Schneider was mixing
magnesium and potassium chlo
rate as part of an experimental
rocket fuel.
Friends described Schneider as
"very careful," but he was dress
ed only in a bathing suit at the
time, while working in his garage.
Doctors estimate that he will not
be able to return to school for at
least six months.
Schneider is at the Loma Linda
Hospital. He will be able to ap
preciate cards and letters within
a few days.
