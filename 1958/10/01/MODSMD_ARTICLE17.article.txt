Ji,if Till*: past two and one-half years, members of tlie Pacific
Coast Conference had been involved in an endless round of sur
face squabbling and basic disagreements which, from the start,
appeared serious enough to threaten the very existence ol the
nine-school association.
Now, to the surprise of virtually no one, the PCC finds itsell
in the midst of its final season. Final riles will be performed in
June, this decision having been reached by conference lathers
during the past summer.
We wish now to congratulate the University for the part it
played during the past, few months as the conference moved
toward its orderly dissolution.
At the time the University of Southern California, the Univer
sities of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles, and the Univer
sity of Washington were announcing their intentions to withdraw
from I lie PCC, President Wallace Sterling said Stanford would
remain in the conference at least until distribution of conference
funds, a method for securing game officials and other business
details had been worked out in a sensible fashion.
Alter reviewing the PCC situation and the statements of Dr.
Sterling regarding Stanford s position, I be Daily editorially rec
ommended on January 10 that Stanford work as quickly as pos
sible toward an orderly dissolution of the conference.
Al that time Washington had taken the lead in moving toward
a March dissolution, and it appeared that Stanford could best
help by working closely with the Seattle school.
Continued disagreements kept the final move to dissolve from
coming until this summer, but when the motion was made, it was
Stanford that made it. And it was Stanford that played a key role
in assuring that the breaking up was done fairly and efficiently,
not haphazardly as would have been the case if schools had
dropped out by ones and twos over a period of several years.
Again, to University officials—congratulations for clear-headed
action on a difficult problem. One question, however, remains—
what's next in Stanford athletic affiliations?
