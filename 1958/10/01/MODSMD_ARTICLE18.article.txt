## With Both Eyes Open Things from Reg Lines 
### 
You sometimes meet the strangest people (and hear the strangest
tilings) in reg lines. It'll take about a quarter before you have a
chance to test this theory, if it be a theory, but remember to listen
next time you have a chance.
TIDBIT: Two froshwomen awaiting those few-paged ("and my,
don't ihey seem to get larger every quarter?"—or is it smaller?)
booklets on Monday: "Gee, I like this ratio busines; I don't know
when I've had so many dates in so short a time. And you should see
my social calendar! I think I'm going to every social function on
campus this quarter." Well, girlie, tell this to mom when she sees
the cinch notices; I'm sure she'll sympathize. Youbetcha!
Couldn't help but laugh at the 30-plus-year-old grad students who
galhered in as much of these same Papoosemaiden sights as possible,
noting: "Say, look at her; what a beautiful tan! And check those
clothes. Enjoy the summer at Malibu?" I looked: nice tan, nice
clothes, yea, Malibu —or anywhere.
BOOK LINE LAMENT: "Oh, heavens, what a line! I think I'll
come back later when it's not so long." Okay by me; but you'll need
ihose books this quarter, not next. Well, maybe it'll clear up in a
day or so. Wannabet?
Funnier, though, was the girl, asked by a male friend where she
was living and what her phone number was. Good, red-blooded Amer
ican questions—no questioning that. She, a little flustered, and
pretty anxious to jump at the chance to give out this info, wanted to
leave a permanent record. Fumbling for a pad she couldn't find, she
finally takes a piece of paper from inside one of his books, jots down
the info, tears paper in half, gives him half, writes her booklist on
other, and turns that half of his $30-plus rebate slip in. You're a doll!
It wasn't worth it!
At the A Phi O book exchange the old-timers scrutinize like an
tique dealers (and face it, some of 'em are), the Papooses grab off
anything that looks like a bargain. And just outside the door the
frosh make idle-ish chatter about same exchange.
"How much did you pay for so-and-so?" "Only 90 cents, and it's
just like new. What a bargain!" News for you, my dear new price:
95 cents. I was took!
To answer a question. Same group, 'nother frosh. "Has anyone
seen a Russian book anywhere?" Sure; try Hoover Tower. Lots
of 'cm.
GOT THE COURSE: Troubled because you have no car? Not
even a prospect of one to borrow? Enroll in C.E. 257, Transportation
Problems. We have a winner here!
WIDE OPEN: Spotted, and chatted with, Rice yellgirl Margie
Moore after Saturday's f'ball fiasco. Register one vote for female
yell loaders, 'specially when they come from .Rice, are called Margie
Moore, have a honey-sweet Southern drawl. If we recruit football
players, why not yell leaders? Okay? Swell! First Prospect Report:
Moore, Margie. Comes from Rice. Looks nice in pictures.
PORTENT: Looking back through the scrapbook and chuckling
at a headline in the Chappie's takeoff on this paper. Theirs called
The Stanfraud Daily. Big yuk-yuk story about local campus station
powered by light bulb which burns out. Headlined "KZSU to Go Off
the Air Indefinitely." So look in your crystal ball, Chappies, and tell
us if we'll win a game this year.
NEW EDITIONS: Too often you just can't get rid of a book
you've bought. Somebody goes and changes the edition on you. And
all because the author changes a few words, they say. Oh. well,
so you build a library. On second thought: AVAILABLE (from
yours truly, and great numbers of others, no doubl), ALL SORTS
OF PROFOUND BOOKS. ALL SHAPES, ALL SIZES, LOW PRICES.
- Some never even read I shamefully admit.
SOMETHING NEW: As if old-timers hadn't seen it times aplenty,
Ihere are still people who walk out of the post office, turn to a friend
or acquaintance, look back at Stanford's venerable Sigma Alpha Ep
silon house and say, "Say. has that always been there? I thought it
was down there . . (and then they spot the gaping hole where yes,
it once was there).
SAEers must also be proud to draw attention to Leo and his wife,
Lions, you know, who now adorn their porch. First person to blow
up this pair in the mid of night will sure make the boys mad.
Meanwhile, back at the Farm. So you start classes this morning.
And the quad picture at 8 o'clock is composed mainly of the frosh;
what upperclassman in other than a confused state of mind - or
taking a required course—-would put in an appearance at that too
early hour. Why that's almost an impossible thing to do—to face the
world at S a.m. WITH BOTH EYES OPEN.

leave a permanent record. Fumbling for a pad she couldn't find, she
finally takes a piece of paper from inside one of his books, jots down
the info, tears paper in half, gives him half, writes her booklist on
other, and turns that half of his $30-plus rebate slip in. You're a doll!
It wasn't worth it!
At the A Phi O book exchange the old-timers scrutinize like an
tique dealers (and face it, some of 'em are), the Papooses grab off
anything that looks like a bargain. And just outside the door the
frosh make idle-ish chatter about same exchange.
"How much did you pay for so-and-so?" "Only 90 cents, and it's
just like new. What a bargain!" News for you, my dear new price:
95 cents. I was took!
To answer a question. Same group, 'nother frosh. "Has anyone
seen a Russian book anywhere?" Sure; try Hoover Tower. Lots
of 'cm.
GOT THE COURSE: Troubled because you have no car? Not
even a prospect of one to borrow? Enroll in C.E. 257, Transportation
Problems. We have a winner here!
WIDE OPEN: Spotted, and chatted with, Rice yellgirl Margie
Moore after Saturday's f'ball fiasco. Register one vote for female
yell loaders, 'specially when they come from .Rice, are called Margie
Moore, have a honey-sweet Southern drawl. If we recruit football
players, why not yell leaders? Okay? Swell! First Prospect Report:
Moore, Margie. Comes from Rice. Looks nice in pictures.
PORTENT: Looking back through the scrapbook and chuckling
at a headline in the Chappie's takeoff on this paper. Theirs called
The Stanfraud Daily. Big yuk-yuk story about local campus station
powered by light bulb which burns out. Headlined "KZSU to Go Off
the Air Indefinitely." So look in your crystal ball, Chappies, and tell
us if we'll win a game this year.
NEW EDITIONS: Too often you just can't get rid of a book
you've bought. Somebody goes and changes the edition on you. And
all because the author changes a few words, they say. Oh. well,
so you build a library. On second thought: AVAILABLE (from
yours truly, and great numbers of others, no doubl), ALL SORTS
OF PROFOUND BOOKS. ALL SHAPES, ALL SIZES, LOW PRICES.
- Some never even read I shamefully admit.
SOMETHING NEW: As if old-timers hadn't seen it times aplenty,
Ihere are still people who walk out of the post office, turn to a friend
or acquaintance, look back at Stanford's venerable Sigma Alpha Ep
silon house and say, "Say. has that always been there? I thought it
was down there . . (and then they spot the gaping hole where yes,
it once was there).
SAEers must also be proud to draw attention to Leo and his wife,
Lions, you know, who now adorn their porch. First person to blow
up this pair in the mid of night will sure make the boys mad.
Meanwhile, back at the Farm. So you start classes this morning.
And the quad picture at 8 o'clock is composed mainly of the frosh;
what upperclassman in other than a confused state of mind - or
taking a required course—-would put in an appearance at that too
early hour. Why that's almost an impossible thing to do—to face the
world at S a.m. WITH BOTH EYES OPEN.
You sometimes meet the strangest people (and hear the strangest
tilings) in reg lines. It'll take about a quarter before you have a
chance to test this theory, if it be a theory, but remember to listen
next time you have a chance.
TIDBIT: Two froshwomen awaiting those few-paged ("and my,
don't ihey seem to get larger every quarter?"—or is it smaller?)
booklets on Monday: "Gee, I like this ratio busines; I don't know
when I've had so many dates in so short a time. And you should see
my social calendar! I think I'm going to every social function on
campus this quarter." Well, girlie, tell this to mom when she sees
the cinch notices; I'm sure she'll sympathize. Youbetcha!
Couldn't help but laugh at the 30-plus-year-old grad students who
galhered in as much of these same Papoosemaiden sights as possible,
noting: "Say, look at her; what a beautiful tan! And check those
clothes. Enjoy the summer at Malibu?" I looked: nice tan, nice
clothes, yea, Malibu —or anywhere.
BOOK LINE LAMENT: "Oh, heavens, what a line! I think I'll
come back later when it's not so long." Okay by me; but you'll need
ihose books this quarter, not next. Well, maybe it'll clear up in a
day or so. Wannabet?
Funnier, though, was the girl, asked by a male friend where she
was living and what her phone number was. Good, red-blooded Amer
ican questions—no questioning that. She, a little flustered, and
pretty anxious to jump at the chance to give out this info, wanted to

at a headline in the Chappie's takeoff on this paper. Theirs called
The Stanfraud Daily. Big yuk-yuk story about local campus station
powered by light bulb which burns out. Headlined "KZSU to Go Off
the Air Indefinitely." So look in your crystal ball, Chappies, and tell
us if we'll win a game this year.
NEW EDITIONS: Too often you just can't get rid of a book
you've bought. Somebody goes and changes the edition on you. And
all because the author changes a few words, they say. Oh. well,
so you build a library. On second thought: AVAILABLE (from
yours truly, and great numbers of others, no doubl), ALL SORTS
OF PROFOUND BOOKS. ALL SHAPES, ALL SIZES, LOW PRICES.
- Some never even read I shamefully admit.
SOMETHING NEW: As if old-timers hadn't seen it times aplenty,
Ihere are still people who walk out of the post office, turn to a friend
or acquaintance, look back at Stanford's venerable Sigma Alpha Ep
silon house and say, "Say. has that always been there? I thought it
was down there . . (and then they spot the gaping hole where yes,
it once was there).
SAEers must also be proud to draw attention to Leo and his wife,
Lions, you know, who now adorn their porch. First person to blow
up this pair in the mid of night will sure make the boys mad.
Meanwhile, back at the Farm. So you start classes this morning.
And the quad picture at 8 o'clock is composed mainly of the frosh;
what upperclassman in other than a confused state of mind - or
taking a required course—-would put in an appearance at that too
early hour. Why that's almost an impossible thing to do—to face the
world at S a.m. WITH BOTH EYES OPEN.
You sometimes meet the strangest people (and hear the strangest
tilings) in reg lines. It'll take about a quarter before you have a
chance to test this theory, if it be a theory, but remember to listen
next time you have a chance.
TIDBIT: Two froshwomen awaiting those few-paged ("and my,
don't ihey seem to get larger every quarter?"—or is it smaller?)
booklets on Monday: "Gee, I like this ratio busines; I don't know
when I've had so many dates in so short a time. And you should see
my social calendar! I think I'm going to every social function on
campus this quarter." Well, girlie, tell this to mom when she sees
the cinch notices; I'm sure she'll sympathize. Youbetcha!
Couldn't help but laugh at the 30-plus-year-old grad students who
galhered in as much of these same Papoosemaiden sights as possible,
noting: "Say, look at her; what a beautiful tan! And check those
clothes. Enjoy the summer at Malibu?" I looked: nice tan, nice
clothes, yea, Malibu —or anywhere.
BOOK LINE LAMENT: "Oh, heavens, what a line! I think I'll
come back later when it's not so long." Okay by me; but you'll need
ihose books this quarter, not next. Well, maybe it'll clear up in a
day or so. Wannabet?
Funnier, though, was the girl, asked by a male friend where she
was living and what her phone number was. Good, red-blooded Amer
ican questions—no questioning that. She, a little flustered, and
pretty anxious to jump at the chance to give out this info, wanted to
leave a permanent record. Fumbling for a pad she couldn't find, she
finally takes a piece of paper from inside one of his books, jots down
the info, tears paper in half, gives him half, writes her booklist on
other, and turns that half of his $30-plus rebate slip in. You're a doll!
It wasn't worth it!
At the A Phi O book exchange the old-timers scrutinize like an
tique dealers (and face it, some of 'em are), the Papooses grab off
anything that looks like a bargain. And just outside the door the
frosh make idle-ish chatter about same exchange.
"How much did you pay for so-and-so?" "Only 90 cents, and it's
just like new. What a bargain!" News for you, my dear new price:
95 cents. I was took!
To answer a question. Same group, 'nother frosh. "Has anyone
seen a Russian book anywhere?" Sure; try Hoover Tower. Lots
of 'cm.
GOT THE COURSE: Troubled because you have no car? Not
even a prospect of one to borrow? Enroll in C.E. 257, Transportation
Problems. We have a winner here!
WIDE OPEN: Spotted, and chatted with, Rice yellgirl Margie
Moore after Saturday's f'ball fiasco. Register one vote for female
yell loaders, 'specially when they come from .Rice, are called Margie
Moore, have a honey-sweet Southern drawl. If we recruit football
players, why not yell leaders? Okay? Swell! First Prospect Report:
Moore, Margie. Comes from Rice. Looks nice in pictures.
