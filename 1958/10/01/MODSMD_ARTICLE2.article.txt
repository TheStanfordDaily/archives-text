### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (.4 s )—Little
Rock's high schools were still
closed Tuesday hut the leader of
the group that sought to operate
them on a private basis said new
plans are being drawn to contnue
the fight for segregation.
A legal authority close to Fau
bus said, however:
"We are at the end of the line."
Dr. T. J. Raney, president of the
Little Rock Private School Cor
poration, offically stated Tuesday
that the schools would not open.
Monday, before the federal judges
acted in Omaha, he set Tuesday
as the opening date.
"We are far from finished,"
said Raney. "We can't quit."
Raney gave no indication of
the nature of his plan.

Shortly afterward, Raney or
dered signs posted on the grounds
of the four high schools.
"This school closed by order of
the federal government," they
read.
Meets Press
Raney met newsmen in the of
fice of the principal of Central
High, scene of the riots last year,
and the focal point n the harsh
situation now.
He looked tired and angry. He
read a statement, on a single
sheet of paper, charging the fed
eral government and the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People with responsi
bility for closing the schools.
"Through the concerted efforts
of the government of the United
States and the NAACP, teh Little
Rock Private School Corporation
has now been enjoined and pro
hibited from operating Central
High, Hall High, Technical High
and Horace Mann High," Raney's
statement said.
"The closing of our senior high
schools is now the full responsi
bility of the federal government
and the NAACP. It is quite evi
dent that they are ready to sacri
fice the educational opportunities
of 4000 students to satisfy their
consuming desire to mix the races
in our schools, public and pri
vate."
Actually, they wore closed Sept.
12 by proclamation of the gover
nor.
Pupils and parents telephoned
the schools asking if they would
be open.
No Teachers
No teachers appeared. They
were warned by their attorneys
not to work with the private cor
poral ion.
Principals answered the tele
phones and told the callers there
would be no school.
Governor Orval E. Faubus said,
"A way will be found" to reopen
Ihe schools on a segregated basis.
He urged the people to stand firm
after federal judges Monday
blocked the private school opera
tion with a temporary restraining
order.
"We think the action of the fed
eral government is illegal but if
the injunctive action is made per
manent, t will make our efforts
more difficult but not at all im
posible," Faubus said.
"As long as the people stand
firm, a way will be found to pre
serve our traditions and educate
our children."
He gave no indication of his
