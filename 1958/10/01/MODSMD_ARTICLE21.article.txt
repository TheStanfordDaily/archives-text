# Letters to the Editor

### 
Editor, The Daily:
I was very surprised to read
what I had allegedly "announced"
as reported in yesterday's Daily.
This letter is an attempt to clarify
the position of Women's Council
in regard to women upstairs in
men's residences.
First of all. Women's Council
cannot and does not make new
rules. We are an educative and
interpretive group. Women's so
cial regulations are made by the
women students through the
AWS social regulations commit
tee.
Council is bound to interpret
these regulations in the spirit in
which they were made. The reg
ulation permitting women in the
downstairs area of a man's resi
dence did not mention the up
stairs area, because it was as
sumed that women would have
no reason to be up there. The up
stairs area was considered the
men's private domain, except in
case of scheduled open houses de
cided upon by a majority of resi
dents.
Last year there was confusion
about this whole issue. To avoid
continuing confusion, Council
wanted to explain its interpreta
tion of this regulation that has
been established for several
years. A woman who enters the
upstairs area of a man's resi

dence is committing an act that is
in "willful disgregard of social

regulations" as they were wri 11
by the AWS social regulations
committee.
