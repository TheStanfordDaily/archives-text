# Curtice Planning Platoon-like System
## 
### 
The national rules committee;
hasn't put the free substitution
rule back on the books yet, but
Jack Curtice is going to see* what
tie can do about developing some
platoon football by Saturday
when his Stanford Indians run
into a hungry Northwestern
Wildcat in Evanston.
Curtice was a bit surprised at
some Tuesday morning reports
which credited him with saying

that Larry Lacey would move
into Bob Peterson's guard spot
and Dick Bowers would take over
for Hick McMillen at halfback.
"'l'm just trying to set up an of
fensive and defensive platoon,"
was his only comment on the sup
posed switches.
"I'm Just trying to set up an
offensive and defensive platoon,"

posed switches.

Lacey's excellent performance
against Rice was the big factor in
his promotion to top man on the
defensive list. In addition to in
tercepting a pass, he was in on
more than his share of the few
good stops the Card line did
make.
Curtice's problems in figuring
a way to beat the surprisingly po
tent Wildcats are somewhat mag
nified by the fact that he has just

[ one scout report to go on, since
NW opened their season only last
week.
Assistant coach Bob Ghilotti
saw the 29-28 edging of Washing
ton State, and his report has made
Curtice wary of the 'Cat running
halfbacks and quarterback.
Biggest threat of the runners
is Willmer Fowler, the most valu
able player on the non-winning
1957 team. Even without his elu
siveness, his speed would pose a
problem for the slow Indian
backs.

Fowler, the Big Ten 100-yard
dash champion, will also cause
Stanford's passing attack trouble
if the Indians try to throw any
thing long.
There was a thread of good
news for Stanford fortunes in the
passing department as ailing Bob
Nicolet began to cut loose in
Tuesday's practice.
Also on the practice field,
though only in sweats, was end
Joel Freis, whose muscle injury
now appears to be a severe pull
instead of a split.
