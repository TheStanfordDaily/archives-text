11*8 an Annual Question
Who has the best team in the Pacific Coast Conference?
Now, that preceding statement, while being a pretty unimagina
tive way to open the year's first column, seems to be a pretty fair
question. And don't expect me to answer it here. It would be easier
to say who's not the best. Idaho's not. Stanford's not. Now then,
that really narrows things down, doesn't it?
DOUBTFUL CARDS: Unfortunately, it looks like the Big Red
isn't the Toast of the Coast this year ... which they should have been
each of the two preceding years. And to you-know-where with that
"tradition" that a new Stanford coach always takes his team to the
Rose Bowl in his first year. Nowadays, with college football coach
ing as high-powered an occupation as they come, it is indeed a rarity
for the new coach at a major school to inherit a real winner. In fact,
if the fate of last year's three FCC coaching rookies is any indica
tion of what's in store this season, woe be it to flack Curtice. Note:
Don Clark at Southeren California (1-9), Fete Elliott at California
(1-9) and Jim Owens at Washington (3-6-1).
But also note: all three of those coaches are still around this year.
And their fortunes are looking a bit better. In fact, Clark is building
the loop's real "sleeper" at USC. Washington, on the strength of last
week's upset of Minnesota, looks a good deal stronger, for the
Huskies lost to the Gophers, 46-7, last season. As for Pete Klliott, his
Bears were beaten too badly by Michigan State and not badly at all
by College of Pacific. And this year's start (0-2 so far) is getting to
be pretty typical for Cal. Be patient, Stanfordites.
THE PREVIOUS QUESTION: Which all brings us back, if a bit
indirectly, to the original question. That is, is the best team
in the FCC? A week ago, all hands seemed to point to the "thrill
boys" from Fullnian . . . -Inn Sutherland's Washington State Cougars.
Then, a not-so-hapless Northwestern came along. (WSC 40, Stanford
6; Northwestern 29, WSC 28. Stanford's next foe: Northwestern.)
Today, we find nine different hands pointing in nine different direc
tions. Things are even more befuddled now than they were before
the season started.
All Right, Who Is Best?
BEAVKRS? Up in Corvallis, they were calling this the best Ore
gon State team yet under Tommy Prothro. (That right there was
quite a boast, for Prothro lists two straight PCC titles.) But, so far,
the Orange has looked like considerably less- than that. An expected
push-over, USC, demolished the Beavers, 21-0, in the opener: but that
might have been passed off as OSC's demonstrated tendency to get
upset. . . once a year. But last weekend, the Prothro-men were quite
unspectacular in topping by 12-0 a Kansas team that was licking its
wounds from a 42-0 lashing by Texas Christian a week earlier. We
may know more about OSC by Saturday, when UCLA invades Bea
verland.
BRUINS? Maybe for half a season, they said, would the Bruins
be best. But that half season forecasters were talking about . . . when
seniors Dick Wallen and friends were playing their five games . . .
is going on right now. They opened the season taking a 27-6 shelling
from a "so-so" Pittsburgh team and last week had to rally to nip un
heralded Illinois, 18-14. What's going to happen in four weeks, when
the five-gamers call it a season? (Stanford gets first shot at the new
Bruins*.) Maybe they miss the "inspirational leadership" of Red
Sanders at West wood.
COUGARS? The Northwestern game could mean several things:
that the Wildcats are much stronger than anticipated; that the Cou
gars still have those glaring defensive weaknesses; or that it was
just one of those days. Nobody can deny WSC's fantastic passing at
tack. The Cougars can score . . . and fast (remember 3 minutes and
33 seconds of offensive display in Stanford Stadium last fall?). Any
one for defense?
DUCKS? These boys will get quite a test Saturday when they
take on Oklahoma. But look for a good showing by the Ducks. They
really lost very little through graduation . . . and that tremendous
backfield speed is still there. One thing a Len Casanova-coached
Oregon team has never lacked is defense. Oregon opened its season
by smashing Idaho, 27-0 . . . about twice as badly as expected.
TROJANS? And here we may have the answer. From 8-2 to 1-9
in one season, and maybe back again. Now that Troy has blasted
OSC and scared the daylights out of Michigan, we hear a bit of ra
tionalization: after all, only Stanford (rah!) and Notre Dame
dumped the Trojans badly last year. Who said sophomores can't
make a winner?
INDIANS? This position, sixth, is where the prognosticators
placed the Tribe at season's eve. The picture has changed. But woe
fully inexperienced teams such as this have a habit of coming on
with a rush late in the year (look out, Cal). Cactus has a great
offense, and now all he needs is the horses to make it go. (Bob New
mans, Lee Grosscnps and John Brodies don't grow on trees, you
know.) In two games the Cards are already showing improvement.
As one of the lucky (?) few who got to witness both the WSC and
Rice field days, let me assure you . . . they were much, much better
against Rice.
HUSKIES? A repeat of last year's up-and-down club was ex
pected this year in Seattle. Then the Puppies knocked off Minnesota.
Whether or not Minnesota is up or down, you must admit that a vic
tory over a Big Ten team is a victory over a Big Ten team . . . some
thing to write home about. We'll see. They visit Ohio State this
week.
BKARS? Nobody can say that the Golden Bears aren't about due
to come up with a winner. But with WSC coining up Saturday, Pete's
boys may have to wait a little longer for that first victory. The
Bears have a track team backfield which may cause trouble, and
now that Joe Kapp is back in the starting lineup where he belongs,
the record should be improved at Berkeley.
VANDALS? Idaho could be the Cleveland Browns in disguise and
still wouldn't win the PCC crown, because the Vandals play only
three conference games. In the old days, that was a good deal, for
the opponents were oft-weak WSC, OSC and Oregon.
HOW ABOUT ALL THAT? There, fans, you have the Pacific.
Coast Conference football race for 1958. The above commentary
most certainly should clear things up in everyone's minds. At least
one thing seems reasonably certain: that, as long as it may be for
Stanford, this should prove to be a most interesting swan song for
the PCC.
