SAN FRANCISCO (/P)â€”Guards
lowered on ropes searched shore
line caves of Alcatraz Island
Tuesday for a missing convict.
And the FBI put out a nation
wide alert- a concession that Aa
ron Walter Burgett 28, Missouri
gunman, just might have accom
plished the unbelievable: a swim
of more than a mile through cold,
tide-swept waters of San Fran
cisco Bav to the mainland.
