## U.S. Policy On China May Ease 
### 
WASHINGTON MV-Secretary
of State Dulles Tuesday heralded
a possible major shift in Amer
ica's China policy. He offered to
try trimming Nationalist military
strength in the Formosa Strait
| offshore islands if the Commu
: nists quit shooting.
Dulles told his news conference
Chiang Kai-shek was foolish to
; commit one-third of his National
! ist armed forces to Quemoy and
the other offshore islands now
being pounded by Red artillery.
' But Dulles conceded this govern
ment acquiesced.
"I feel that there is a slight
j tendency toward a stabilization of
; the situation, and I feel on the
whole that there is less likelihood
! of the hostilities intensifying and
enlarging than I thought was the
| case a couple of weeks ago," he
! said.
Dulles' words were not strong
| enough to be taken as U.S. accept
ance of two Chinas, or even of a
policy shift already decided upon.
But his conciliatory approach in
dicated movement toward a pos
sible basis for negotiation at U.S.-
Red China ambassadorial talks in
Warsaw.
Defense authorities confirmed
yesterday that Chinese National
ist Air Force planes are equipped
with U.S. Sidewinder guided mis
siles. They said this came under
a modernization program begun
months ago.
A few hours earlier Dulles said
at his news conference that the
Sidewinders have been turned
over to the Chinese Nationalists.
The Chinese Communists have
complained bitterly that the Unit
ed States was showing bad faith
in equipping the Nationalist air
planes with Sidewinders, at the
time of U.S.-Red China negotia
tions on a cease-fire at Warsaw.
