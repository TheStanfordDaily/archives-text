The problems of dust, lint, and static buildup on phono
records and pickup styli have been solved by this
ingenious new invention which cleans the record as it is
being played. The Dust Bug pad is slightly moistened with
special, harmless fluid supplied in a replaceable applicator.
This helps to loosen groove dust and dirt so it can be
collected by the pad. It also eliminates the static
charge present in all records. Every point on an LP
record is cleaned by the wide Dust Bug pad approximately
one hundred times during a single play. A special model
is available for record changers.
Standard model (above), complete with
fluiiMn applicator only $5.75

Acclaimed in two hemispheres!
"Has probably done more to preserve the life of records'
and stylus points than anything we have yet come across,
even including super lightweight pickups!"
— HI-FI YEAR BOOK (London)
"After half a dozen plays, the surface of the disc looks
exactly like a.new, unplayed record. Noise, pops, and clicks are
gone... Highly recommended...should be on every turntable"
—AUDIO (New York)
