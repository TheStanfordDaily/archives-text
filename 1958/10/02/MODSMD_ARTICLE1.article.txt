# Cal, Stanford Initiate Grad Unit Exchange
## 
### Jack Winkler, Associate Editor 
Stanford and the University of California today start a graduate
exchange program which presents exciting possibilities for doctoral
candidates in each school to take specialized courses at the other
without any additional fees.

The plan, worked out this sum
three-year trial basis and so far
has started on a very conserva
tive basis, with only one student
from each university taking ad
vantage of the plan.
James E. Gill, a graduate stu
dent in Stanford's Physics De
partment, has enrolled in a phys
ics course at Cal and just yester
day John P. Kirscht, a doctoral
candidate in psychology at Cal,
registered in Psychology 212,
Prof. Festinger's Advanced Social
Psychology.
The formal statement of the
agreement says: "Plans call for
each university to make its edu
cational facilities more available
to graduate students at the other

mer by a joint committee, is on a

and particularly to permit more
effective utilization of academic
personnel by graduate students in
this period when the scarcity of
faculty is becoming critical."
No Money Exchanged
An important part of the pro
gram is that it costs the exchang
ing student nothing more than
the normal fees at his "home"
university. There is not even an
exchange of money between the
universities.
It is anticipated that there will
be an equal number of students
from each school participating in
the exchange. Most of the courses
taken will be seminars though ev
ery course offered is open to the
exchanging student.
The new arrangement is simi
lar to that now operating between
Harvard and Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology. There are ad
ditional problems in the Cal-Stan
ford plan, however, because of
the greater distance between the
schools and Cal's status as a tax
supported university.
More Details
Additional details of the plan
are:
• It will start on a small scale
this fall and hopefully will be ex
panded during (he rest of the
three-year trial period.
• It applies only to regular
university periods and not to
summer sessions.
• Each exchanging student
must be in residence at the
■'home" university during the
time he is taking courses at the
"host."
• The "home" department will
determine the credit to be grant
ed, but presumably it will be done
on the standard three quarter
units for two semester units sys
tem.
• The "host" faculty member
who taught the course taken in
the exchange may serve on a
qualifying examination and on a
thesis or dissertation committee.
• Transcripts will be given to
the student and his university.
• The students will pay then
regular home fees.
There are other agreements
which do not pertain particularly
to graduate courses. There are
planned exchanges of information
on special lectureships and visit
ing professors, schedules of the
Committees on Public Exercises,
lists of organized research units
and official catalogues.
Student plays and musicals
may give performances at the
other university in the future and
plans are being made for co-oper
ation on the use of library facili
ties.

the exchange. Most of the courses
taken will be seminars though ev
ery course offered is open to the
exchanging student.
The new arrangement is simi
lar to that now operating between
Harvard and Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology. There are ad
ditional problems in the Cal-Stan
ford plan, however, because of
the greater distance between the
schools and Cal's status as a tax
supported university.
More Details
Additional details of the plan
are:
• It will start on a small scale
this fall and hopefully will be ex
panded during (he rest of the
three-year trial period.
• It applies only to regular
university periods and not to
summer sessions.
• Each exchanging student
must be in residence at the
■'home" university during the
time he is taking courses at the
"host."
• The "home" department will
determine the credit to be grant
ed, but presumably it will be done
on the standard three quarter
units for two semester units sys
tem.
• The "host" faculty member
who taught the course taken in
the exchange may serve on a
qualifying examination and on a
thesis or dissertation committee.
• Transcripts will be given to
the student and his university.
• The students will pay then
regular home fees.
There are other agreements
which do not pertain particularly
to graduate courses. There are
planned exchanges of information
on special lectureships and visit
ing professors, schedules of the
Committees on Public Exercises,
lists of organized research units
and official catalogues.
Student plays and musicals
may give performances at the
other university in the future and
plans are being made for co-oper
ation on the use of library facili
ties.
Stanford and the University of California today start a graduate
exchange program which presents exciting possibilities for doctoral
candidates in each school to take specialized courses at the other
without any additional fees.

The plan, worked out this sum
three-year trial basis and so far
has started on a very conserva
tive basis, with only one student
from each university taking ad
vantage of the plan.
James E. Gill, a graduate stu
dent in Stanford's Physics De
partment, has enrolled in a phys
ics course at Cal and just yester
day John P. Kirscht, a doctoral
candidate in psychology at Cal,
registered in Psychology 212,
Prof. Festinger's Advanced Social
Psychology.
The formal statement of the
agreement says: "Plans call for
each university to make its edu
cational facilities more available
to graduate students at the other

mer by a joint committee, is on a

and particularly to permit more
effective utilization of academic
personnel by graduate students in
this period when the scarcity of
faculty is becoming critical."
No Money Exchanged
An important part of the pro
gram is that it costs the exchang
ing student nothing more than
the normal fees at his "home"
university. There is not even an
exchange of money between the
universities.
It is anticipated that there will
be an equal number of students
from each school participating in
the exchange. Most of the courses
taken will be seminars though ev
ery course offered is open to the
exchanging student.
