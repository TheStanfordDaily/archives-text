# Book Lines End Next Fall?
## 
### 
Stanford students are currently
spending their last fall quarter in
Bookstore lines—if all goes ac
cording to the plans of Bookstore

manager Mrs. Aglena T. Bauchou.
Although lines this quarter are
running shorter than in past
years, they'll be a thing of the

past a year from now when the
text and general book portion of
a new bookstore is scheduled to
be completed.
Mrs. Bauchou estimates there is
a 75 per cent chance that what
she terms "an A-l store" will be
ready to go with its new self
service system by the target date.
Present plans call for construc
tion on the new facility to begin
by the first of the year.
A general book department the
area of the entire present Book
store will feature the new layout.
In all the new store will be two
and one-half to three times as
large as today's crowded building.
Despite an increase in volume
this quarter. Mrs. Bauchou attrib
utes the shorter lines to students
taking advantage of the 8 p.m.
closing hours. The Bookstore will
return to its normal 5 p.m. clos
ing Friday.
More student help has also
been hired for the beginning of
tho quarter rush this year, noted
Mrs. Bauchou. While from 10 to
IfS people have been preparing for
the rush since August, the staff
for this week has been increased
to 20 to speed operations.
