# Permanent Lake Rumors False; Banks Reinforced

Lake Lagunita will soon be made into a permanent lake said the
rumors. The presence of a leveling crew on the dry lake bed didn't

hurt the rumors, either.
Rally Com, according to Herk I
a new tradition during Big Gam
with the Navy to secure the
barge Ticonderoga and build the
freshman bonfire on it, then tow
the mass of wood to the center of
the lake and light it.
Protection of the volatile col
lection of wood would have been
almost unnecessary, with the lake
all around it. Most of the fresh
man men would have been able
to sleep that night, rather than
having to maintain the traditional
night-long vigilance against ma
rauders.
Rumors Fly
But alas! All the preparation
and the furor was in vain. The
lake will not be made into a per
manent body of water, according
to Corporation Yard Supervisor
Carroll L. Blacker.
Last spring, seepage from the
lake through the north bank
caused some worry for the safety
of Roble Hall and Lagunita Court,
for fear that the bank would
eventually give way. The Dam
Inspector of Northern California
had warned the University pre
viously, according to Blacker, so
this summer it was decided to
have the bank repaired.
All the dirt - moving machines
that are at present working on
Lake Lagunita's floor belong to
Oscar Holmes, Inc., of Redwood
City. The company has been hired
by the University to merely rein
force the north hank of the lake.
Clay Blanket
The machines dug a 12-foot
trench around the edge of the
lake and replaced the porous dirt
with not -so - porous clay. Now
they are laying a clay "blanket"
over the north bank which will
widen the rim of the lake.
The lake bed, says the construc
tion crew, will be all ready for the
Class of '62 to build their Big
Game Bonfire on November 20.
