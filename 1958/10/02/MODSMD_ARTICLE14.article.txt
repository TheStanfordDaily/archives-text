city to join the union's negotia
tions with General Motors, which

President John D. Leary said the
Chrysler terms followed lines of
the UAW settlement with Ford
Motor Company two weeks ago.
This includes improved com
pany-paid layoff pay, a new sever
ance plan, and wage increases to
cover cost of living and produc
tivity improvement. The Ford
agreement will provide an esti

contract that will give Chrysler
greater employment stability.
