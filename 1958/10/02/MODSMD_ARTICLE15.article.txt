.I tun* .'JO, 1959. Though circumstances of distrust and disagreement
among member schools of the Pacific Coast Conference have
spelled death for the league, this demise has provided Stanford
with the opportunity to examine its future in athletics free I rom
entangling alliances with oilier schools.
Implications drawn from statements and actions by the Uni
versity during the lime of I'CC strile indicate that Stanford has
no intention of de-emphasizing the athletic program; neither
will there be any moves toward the "full ride or a "win at all
costs" philosophy in this area.
Assuming, then, that Stanford will continue to field teams
against representative and top-level competition while at the same
time maintaining a reasonable hold on its aid program, the basic
decision which remains is whether to follow this course as an
independent or as a member of an organized conference.
Our sincerest hope is that ihe University will act carefully and
with long deliberation before committing itself to affiliation with
any conference.
There would appear to be only three possible groups which
Stanford could consider joining; Iwo of these have such apparent
drawbacks that we feel anv move in their direction would be a
mistake.
The first, a nation-wide conference of football powers, has been
suggested many times in the past. It was again in the headlines
the past summer, with Stanford named among the 15 or so pos
sible members of such a group.
UCLA, California and Southern California —three of the PCC
bolters —have also been mentioned prominently as potential
schools for such a league, along with !\olre Dame, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania State and the three service academies. The latter
group all now rank among the leading independents in the
country.
The impracticality of such a league for any sport except foot
ball is one obvious disadvantage. Joining such a group would in
110 way solve the more acute need of sports such as basketball for
league competition.
The fact that practically all of the other schools mentioned
as possible members of such an organization adhere to aid policies
far more liberal than Stanford's would also serve to place the
University in ;i somewhat unfair position regarding actual on-the
field competition. And it's certainly no pleasure to be a doormat
for anybody.
Considered during the period before the dissolution of the
PCC was continued alignment of Stanford and four of the North
west schools—Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State and Idaho.
Since the death of the league, most mention of such a setup as
this has vanished, and it is well that it has, simply because of the
unnatural geographic situation which would result from four
members at one end of the map and a fifth "lone wolf at the
oilier.
The old PCC was geographically bad; with Stanford s three
neighbors out of the fold, any alignment with only Northwest
schools would be worse.
There remains, of course, the obvious group for Stanford to
join—the new "Big Four*' of Washington, California, UCLA and
Southern California. This group, too, has a single member out
on a long limb, but if \\ ashington's happy, then there's no reason
for the others to worry about it.
From the standpoint of traditional rivalries and past on-the
field history, Stanford would be doing well for itself if it could
make the Big Four into the Big Five.
But more important than these considerations are the philoso
phies and trusts upon which the new conference is built.
Il is a relatively loose confederation of members who have all
inferred a desire to abide by a very liberal athlete-aid code. Ihe
Big Four has no overseeing agency, rather depending on each
school to police itself in regard to limitations set up by the league.
Its members proclaim a spirit of mutual trust.
\\ hen we note, however, that hardly a week after the founding
of the new league a coach at one member school broke into the
office of a coach at another league school with charges of illegal
recruiting, it begins to appear that the spirit of mutual trust is
hardly worth the paper upon which it is professed.
Stanford has just emerged from more than two years of con
stunt disagreement, within the PCC, with the same schools now
making up the Big Four. Their basic positions have not measur
ably changed; neither have those of Stanford. Il would hardly
seem logical to rush into a new alliance with these same schools
before basic differences in athletic philosophy have been resolved.
We would hope that these differences can be resolved in the
foreseeable future. There is no doubt that benefits exist in league
membership, for all other sports as well as football. I here is also
no doubt that the ideal league alignment is with one's traditional
and natural geographic rivals.
But as Stanford officials consider the merits and debits of any
such alignment, we ask, and are confident, that they will cause
no unreasonable or unnecessary compromise of University athletic
principles.

We would hope that these differences can be resolved in the
foreseeable future. There is no doubt that benefits exist in league
membership, for all other sports as well as football. I here is also
no doubt that the ideal league alignment is with one's traditional
and natural geographic rivals.

such alignment, we ask, and are confident, that they will cause
no unreasonable or unnecessary compromise of University athletic
principles.

Assuming, then, that Stanford will continue to field teams
against representative and top-level competition while at the same

decision which remains is whether to follow this course as an
independent or as a member of an organized conference.
Our sincerest hope is that ihe University will act carefully and
with long deliberation before committing itself to affiliation with
any conference.
There would appear to be only three possible groups which
Stanford could consider joining; Iwo of these have such apparent
drawbacks that we feel anv move in their direction would be a
mistake.
The first, a nation-wide conference of football powers, has been
suggested many times in the past. It was again in the headlines
the past summer, with Stanford named among the 15 or so pos
sible members of such a group.
UCLA, California and Southern California —three of the PCC
bolters —have also been mentioned prominently as potential
schools for such a league, along with !\olre Dame, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania State and the three service academies. The latter
group all now rank among the leading independents in the
country.
The impracticality of such a league for any sport except foot
ball is one obvious disadvantage. Joining such a group would in
110 way solve the more acute need of sports such as basketball for
league competition.
The fact that practically all of the other schools mentioned
as possible members of such an organization adhere to aid policies
far more liberal than Stanford's would also serve to place the
University in ;i somewhat unfair position regarding actual on-the
field competition. And it's certainly no pleasure to be a doormat
for anybody.
Considered during the period before the dissolution of the
PCC was continued alignment of Stanford and four of the North
west schools—Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State and Idaho.
Since the death of the league, most mention of such a setup as
this has vanished, and it is well that it has, simply because of the
unnatural geographic situation which would result from four
members at one end of the map and a fifth "lone wolf at the
oilier.
The old PCC was geographically bad; with Stanford s three
neighbors out of the fold, any alignment with only Northwest
schools would be worse.
There remains, of course, the obvious group for Stanford to
join—the new "Big Four*' of Washington, California, UCLA and
Southern California. This group, too, has a single member out
on a long limb, but if \\ ashington's happy, then there's no reason
for the others to worry about it.
From the standpoint of traditional rivalries and past on-the
field history, Stanford would be doing well for itself if it could
make the Big Four into the Big Five.
But more important than these considerations are the philoso
phies and trusts upon which the new conference is built.
Il is a relatively loose confederation of members who have all
inferred a desire to abide by a very liberal athlete-aid code. Ihe
Big Four has no overseeing agency, rather depending on each
school to police itself in regard to limitations set up by the league.
Its members proclaim a spirit of mutual trust.
\\ hen we note, however, that hardly a week after the founding
of the new league a coach at one member school broke into the
office of a coach at another league school with charges of illegal
recruiting, it begins to appear that the spirit of mutual trust is
hardly worth the paper upon which it is professed.
Stanford has just emerged from more than two years of con
stunt disagreement, within the PCC, with the same schools now
making up the Big Four. Their basic positions have not measur
ably changed; neither have those of Stanford. Il would hardly
seem logical to rush into a new alliance with these same schools

office of a coach at another league school with charges of illegal
recruiting, it begins to appear that the spirit of mutual trust is
hardly worth the paper upon which it is professed.
Stanford has just emerged from more than two years of con
stunt disagreement, within the PCC, with the same schools now
making up the Big Four. Their basic positions have not measur
ably changed; neither have those of Stanford. Il would hardly
seem logical to rush into a new alliance with these same schools
before basic differences in athletic philosophy have been resolved.
We would hope that these differences can be resolved in the
foreseeable future. There is no doubt that benefits exist in league
membership, for all other sports as well as football. I here is also
no doubt that the ideal league alignment is with one's traditional
and natural geographic rivals.
But as Stanford officials consider the merits and debits of any
such alignment, we ask, and are confident, that they will cause
no unreasonable or unnecessary compromise of University athletic
principles.

among member schools of the Pacific Coast Conference have
spelled death for the league, this demise has provided Stanford
with the opportunity to examine its future in athletics free I rom
entangling alliances with oilier schools.
Implications drawn from statements and actions by the Uni
versity during the lime of I'CC strile indicate that Stanford has
no intention of de-emphasizing the athletic program; neither
will there be any moves toward the "full ride or a "win at all
costs" philosophy in this area.
Assuming, then, that Stanford will continue to field teams
against representative and top-level competition while at the same
time maintaining a reasonable hold on its aid program, the basic
decision which remains is whether to follow this course as an
independent or as a member of an organized conference.
Our sincerest hope is that ihe University will act carefully and
with long deliberation before committing itself to affiliation with
any conference.
There would appear to be only three possible groups which
Stanford could consider joining; Iwo of these have such apparent
drawbacks that we feel anv move in their direction would be a
mistake.
The first, a nation-wide conference of football powers, has been
suggested many times in the past. It was again in the headlines
the past summer, with Stanford named among the 15 or so pos
sible members of such a group.
UCLA, California and Southern California —three of the PCC
bolters —have also been mentioned prominently as potential
schools for such a league, along with !\olre Dame, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania State and the three service academies. The latter
group all now rank among the leading independents in the
country.
The impracticality of such a league for any sport except foot
ball is one obvious disadvantage. Joining such a group would in
110 way solve the more acute need of sports such as basketball for
league competition.
The fact that practically all of the other schools mentioned
as possible members of such an organization adhere to aid policies
far more liberal than Stanford's would also serve to place the
University in ;i somewhat unfair position regarding actual on-the
field competition. And it's certainly no pleasure to be a doormat
for anybody.
Considered during the period before the dissolution of the
PCC was continued alignment of Stanford and four of the North
west schools—Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State and Idaho.
Since the death of the league, most mention of such a setup as
this has vanished, and it is well that it has, simply because of the
unnatural geographic situation which would result from four
members at one end of the map and a fifth "lone wolf at the
oilier.
The old PCC was geographically bad; with Stanford s three
neighbors out of the fold, any alignment with only Northwest
schools would be worse.
There remains, of course, the obvious group for Stanford to
join—the new "Big Four*' of Washington, California, UCLA and
Southern California. This group, too, has a single member out
on a long limb, but if \\ ashington's happy, then there's no reason
for the others to worry about it.
From the standpoint of traditional rivalries and past on-the
field history, Stanford would be doing well for itself if it could
make the Big Four into the Big Five.
But more important than these considerations are the philoso
phies and trusts upon which the new conference is built.
Il is a relatively loose confederation of members who have all
inferred a desire to abide by a very liberal athlete-aid code. Ihe
Big Four has no overseeing agency, rather depending on each
school to police itself in regard to limitations set up by the league.
Its members proclaim a spirit of mutual trust.
