## Overcoming the Age Chasm

Humanities, 7957-58
A university is a community of
students, young and old. The
High School graduate becomes at
once a member of the family; W.
F. Durand and Bailey Willis, at
90, were undimmed lights. In the
vast sweep of the human quest,
age is not of the essence. The
problem is nol: how old? but:
how true? Ecclesiastes, Jonah,
Job are more modern than
William Dean Howells, Edith
Wharton or Grace Metallious.
In my very pleasant experience
as resurrected professor, a few
months ago, I found that we
could overcome the age chasm by
ignoring it. Nothing in our dis
cussions was dismissed as juve
nile or antiquated: every thought
was considered on its s own merits.
As a friend of mine liked to put
it:"I have known freshmen who
were senile, and emeriti who
were puerile."

That is why I have always
thought that the Stanford Daily,
while remaining strictly a stu
dents' enterprise, should welcome
the cooperation of the faculty,
from the half-fledged assistants
to the unfledged emeriti, or
Struldbrugs. Your editor had been
struck with the same thought,
and she invited me to open the
way. It was suggested that the
best contribution might be a re
port of work in progress, whether
it be a misguided missile to Mars
or "Comparative Frequency of
the Letters L and R in Piers
Plowman."
I am engaged on two main jobs.
The first is a large scale history
of France for the Michigan Press.
It has to be revised again, and
brought up to the minute. I am
anxiously waiting for General de
Gaulle to make history before I
write it down. The 10 previous
years could easily have been
summed up: SNAFU.
Total Reworking
The second is a total reworking
of my old "Avenir de Paris." The
first version, in the form of mag
azine articles, appeared in 1918-
1919; the second, as a book, in

1929. In the last 30 years, Paris
and I have changed a great
deal: not fast enough, and not in
variable in the right direction.
This is a book hard to clas
sify. The study is historical and
esthetic: how to preserve the
charm of that incomparable city.
But it goes into the practical as
pects of city planning, for old
Paris can be saved only through
a bold and rational development
of the new.
So the book has its technical
side: I have long been accepted
by the Paris planners as one of
their craft, even through in part
ibus. But it is also a personal
record of my memories and of my
dreams. I have long ceased to be
a Frenchmen, and become a citi
zen of the world and of Santa
Clara County. But I am still a
Parisian. A labor of love inevit
able has an element of self-love:
La Rochefoucauld thought that
up some 300 years ago.
I have also a few historical and
literary essays in mind; and I
hope to keep up my reviewing for
The New York Times, The Key
Reporter of Phi Beta Kappa, and
Books Abroad.

I am engaged on two main jobs.
The first is a large scale history
of France for the Michigan Press.
It has to be revised again, and
brought up to the minute. I am
anxiously waiting for General de

write it down. The 10 previous
years could easily have been
summed up: SNAFU.

The second is a total reworking
of my old "Avenir de Paris." The
first version, in the form of mag
azine articles, appeared in 1918-
1919; the second, as a book, in

1929. In the last 30 years, Paris
and I have changed a great
deal: not fast enough, and not in
variable in the right direction.
This is a book hard to clas
sify. The study is historical and
esthetic: how to preserve the
charm of that incomparable city.
But it goes into the practical as
pects of city planning, for old
Paris can be saved only through
a bold and rational development
of the new.
So the book has its technical
side: I have long been accepted
by the Paris planners as one of
their craft, even through in part
ibus. But it is also a personal
record of my memories and of my
dreams. I have long ceased to be
a Frenchmen, and become a citi
zen of the world and of Santa
Clara County. But I am still a
Parisian. A labor of love inevit
able has an element of self-love:
La Rochefoucauld thought that
up some 300 years ago.
I have also a few historical and
literary essays in mind; and I
hope to keep up my reviewing for
The New York Times, The Key
Reporter of Phi Beta Kappa, and
Books Abroad.

A university is a community of
students, young and old. The
High School graduate becomes at
once a member of the family; W.
F. Durand and Bailey Willis, at
90, were undimmed lights. In the
vast sweep of the human quest,
age is not of the essence. The
problem is nol: how old? but:
how true? Ecclesiastes, Jonah,
Job are more modern than
William Dean Howells, Edith
Wharton or Grace Metallious.
In my very pleasant experience
as resurrected professor, a few
months ago, I found that we
could overcome the age chasm by
ignoring it. Nothing in our dis
cussions was dismissed as juve
nile or antiquated: every thought
was considered on its s own merits.
As a friend of mine liked to put
it:"I have known freshmen who
were senile, and emeriti who
were puerile."

That is why I have always
thought that the Stanford Daily,
while remaining strictly a stu
dents' enterprise, should welcome
the cooperation of the faculty,
from the half-fledged assistants
to the unfledged emeriti, or
Struldbrugs. Your editor had been

Reporter of Phi Beta Kappa, and
Books Abroad.
