# Plea No. 3
## 
### 
Well, here we are again with
another of our marvellously
clever stories to entice you to
the Daily Shack. This' is No. 3
in the series we run every year
at this time to try to snag off
as many students interested in
journalism as we can.
There are two reasons. First,
we are getting pretty tired of
putting out this paper with a
small staff and would like to
see it grow; a.v it grows we do
less and less work while all you
new people do more and more.
The second reason is that we
hope to steal as many prospec
tive Chaparral start' members
as we can. After all, you don't
want to work for a rag like
that!
So drop by the Shack any
time soon, or come to a meet
ing this Sunday, Oct. 5, at 1:30
p.m. in Room <>111, Inner Quad.
