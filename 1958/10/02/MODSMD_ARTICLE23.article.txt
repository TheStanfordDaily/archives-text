# Tribe Leaves for Evanston Today
## 
### 
Thirty-seven Stanford Indians
stari tlie loiik trip toward what
they hope will be the season's
first victory today at 10:45 a.m.
when they leave for Evanston,
111., and a Saturday engagement
with Northwestern.
Ara Parseghian's improved
Wildcats are now up to 14-point
favorites on the national line.
Hut the shuffling Jack Curtice
has given his Cards is looking
good this week perhaps good
enough to knock off a few of
those 14 points.
The big move offensively has
been to establish the right hall
back as the regular l'lanker. Cur
tice had been employing both his
halfbacks as flankers, depending
on whether the Indians were
shifted left or right.
Kond at Flanker
John Bond, Mac Wylie and
Tommy Williams have been as
signed to the pass-catching and
blocking flanker position, with
Bond rating the edge for the
starting berth.
Dick Bowers, Rick McMillen
and Roy Stephen will inherit the
ball-carrying duties at the run
ning, or left, halfback slot.
Bowers has the tiniest of edges
on McMillen right now but both
will undoubtedly see plenty of ac
tion. McMillen figured as the top
running halfback at the start of
the season, but his signal has
been called surprisingly little this
year, perhaps partly the result of
his being out on the flank some
of the time. Now, however, he'll
have ample time to display the
form that made him Stanford's
best ball-carrying sophomore in
1 957.
Jim Byrer has also been moved,
switching from halfback to full,
lie joins Gil Dowd and Doug
Dick.
Wildcats Boast Size
The (jard runners will find
themselves piling into a veteran
Northwestern line that weighs in
at 211 pounds per man. Anchor
ing it are a pair of 230-pound
tackles, Andy Cvercko and Gene
Gossage.

Thirty-seven Stanford Indians
stari tlie loiik trip toward what
they hope will be the season's
first victory today at 10:45 a.m.
when they leave for Evanston,
111., and a Saturday engagement
with Northwestern.
Ara Parseghian's improved
Wildcats are now up to 14-point
favorites on the national line.
Hut the shuffling Jack Curtice
has given his Cards is looking
good this week perhaps good
enough to knock off a few of
those 14 points.
The big move offensively has
been to establish the right hall
back as the regular l'lanker. Cur
tice had been employing both his
halfbacks as flankers, depending
on whether the Indians were
shifted left or right.
Kond at Flanker
John Bond, Mac Wylie and
Tommy Williams have been as
signed to the pass-catching and
blocking flanker position, with
Bond rating the edge for the
starting berth.
Dick Bowers, Rick McMillen
and Roy Stephen will inherit the
ball-carrying duties at the run
ning, or left, halfback slot.
Bowers has the tiniest of edges
on McMillen right now but both
will undoubtedly see plenty of ac
tion. McMillen figured as the top
running halfback at the start of
the season, but his signal has
been called surprisingly little this
year, perhaps partly the result of
his being out on the flank some
of the time. Now, however, he'll
have ample time to display the
form that made him Stanford's
best ball-carrying sophomore in
1 957.
Jim Byrer has also been moved,
switching from halfback to full,
lie joins Gil Dowd and Doug
Dick.
