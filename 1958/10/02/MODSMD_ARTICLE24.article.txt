Stanford's best hope here is
that experience has not helped
the Wildcats too much. Last
year's 'Cat line didn't prove to
be very tough for the Indians to
crack as Stanford rang up 409
yards in its 20-6 victory—2sl of
them on the ground.
The Northwestern backfield
looks like it will give the Indians'
thus-far ineffective forward wall
some trouble.
Wilmer Fowler is the big break
away threat — he's faster than
anyone on the Stanford squad and
has the shiftiness to go with it.
Fowler holds the Big Ten 100-
yard dash crown.
But the workhorse for the Ev
anston boys, at "least against
Washington State, was Ron Bur
ton. He carried an amazing 28
times, rolling up 164 yards for
nearly a six-yard average.
Burton will probably be the
man to do most of the work again
Saturday particularly since Fowl
er is still nursing an ankle in
jury.
The word from Evanston, how
ever is that Fowler and every
other member of the Wildcat
squad will be ready to go Satur
day.
Center Jim Andreotti, while tip
ping the scales at only 199
pounds, is a standout in the mid
dle of the Wildcats' otherwise
large forward wall. As a sopho
more last season, Andreotti log
ged 355 minutes of playing time,
a total exceeded only by Cvercko
among returning lettermen.
Chip Holcomb, son of Athletic
Director Stu Holcomb, and John
Talley shared the quarterback
role last season but have encoun
tered real competition this year
from sophomore Dick Thornton.
