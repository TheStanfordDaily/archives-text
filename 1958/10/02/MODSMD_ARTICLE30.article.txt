MILWAUKEE (JP) â€” The Mil
waukee Braves jumped out in
front in the World Series Wednes
day as they defeated the New
York Yankees 4-3 in the 10-inning
opener with Bill Bruton driving
in the deciding run.
Bruton, who was sidelined by a
knee injury when the Braves de
feated the Yankees in seven
games a year ago, connected with
one of Ryne Duten's fast balls
and scored Joe Adcock from sec
ond.
A capacity crowd of 46,367 saw
Warren Spahn and Whitey Ford,
ace southpaws, battle on nearly
even terms through eight innings.
In the eighth Ford weakened. He
walked Eddie Mathews and Hank
Aaron doubled.
Manager Casey Stengel called
in fireball thrower Duren to re
lieve Ford. Duren got out of the
hole but not before the tying run
had been scored by the Braves on
Wes Covington's sacrifice fly.
Bruton, benched at the start be

cause left handed Ford was pitch
ing .came on as a pinehhitter for
Andy Pdfko in the ninth but
fanned. Given another chance
after Adcock and Del Crandall
singled in the 10th, Bruton came
through with a hit that could well
have gone for a double, had it
been necessary.
