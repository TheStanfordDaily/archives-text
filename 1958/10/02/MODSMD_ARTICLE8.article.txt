# Nationalists Refuse U.S. Formosa Peace Formula
## Chiang Opposes Reduction Of Off-shore Island Manpower 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa (/P) —President Chiang Kai-shek balked at the
U.S. formula for peace in Formosa Strait, and his Nationalist gov
ernment then flatly rejected it Thursday.
Chiang made clear in an interview he is opposed to reducing the
garrisons of the off-shore islands as the price of a cease-fire. He

implied he would be free to ig
nore any cease-fire negotiated by
the United States and Red China.
An official statement from
Chiang's Foreign Ministry said
troop cuts would clear the way
for a Red invasion of Formosa
and therefore "we cannot counte
nance the reduction of this defen
sive strength."
Chiang and his Foreign Office
aimed their shafts at a statement
by Secretary of State Dulles in a
Washington news conference on
Tuesday. Dulles proposed a cut
in the Nationalist off-shore garri
sons in exchange for a cease fire.
He was backed up Wednesday by
President Eisenhower.
The policy split between the
United States and Nationalist
China Wednesday threatens U.S.
efforts to find a compromise way
out of the Formosa crisis.
The issue on which they fo
cused attention is the future of
the Nationalist • held coastal is
lands, Quemoy and Matsu.
Negotiation Offer
In essence, Dulles made clear
the United States would be will
ing to negotiate over future use
of the islands if the Chinese Com
munists stop their attacks on
Quemoy and thus establish a
cease-fire in the region. The Reds
have had Quemoy under bombaid
ment since Aug. 23.
The status of Quemoy and Ma
tsu thus becomes a bargaining
point in Dulles' efforts to quell
the danger of a more general war
in the Far East.
The Formosa Foreign Ministry,
after an all-night series of meet
ings, called the Quemoy and Ma
tsu off-shore island groups indis
pensable shields to Formosa.
Defense Necessary
"For this reason we must de
fend them to the best of our abil
ity" the statement said. "The
Chinese Communists have always
wanted to invade these islands as
a prelude to what they have re
peatedly declared to be an inva
sion of Taiwan (Formosa) itself."
The question sharply posed by
Chiang's response is how Dulles
can bargain at all without the co
operation and support of Nation
alist China — co-operation and
support which the generalissimo,
on the basis of Wednesday's in
terview, apparently intends to
deny.
Chiang challenged the whole
concept of trying to get the Chi
nese Reds to accept a cease-fire.
