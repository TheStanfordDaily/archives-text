# U.S. Starts Reinforcing Of Quemoy Supply Lines
## Dulles Reassures Nationalists In Wake of Chiang's Outcry 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa (/P)— A U.S. campaign began rolling Thursday
to give (he Nationalists the muscle to break Red China's blockade
of Quemoy.
Five of 16 promised C-119 Flying Boxcars arrived for duly on
air-drop missions. They will be manned by Nationalists.

Sea convoys were being rigged
with new equipment to keep sup
plies going to the offshore island
despite heavy seas that now play
ally to the Red Chinese shelling.
Jet Bombers Seen
Four U.S. twin-jet 857 light
bombers, part of the Tactical Air
Command's striking force de
ployed in the Far East, were re
ported seen on a northern For
mosa air base for the first time.
They presumably flew in from
Okinawa or bases in the Philip
pines.
Red mainland guns rained 5580
shells on Quemoy during the
morning, the Defense Ministry
said. Most of the shells were
aimed at one area.
More Supplies
The question of supply to Que
moy was believed the subject of
top-level conferences between
President Chiang Kai-shek and
U.S. officers in Formosa. It was
the first meeting of Chiang with
the U.S. generals and admirals
since his statement Wednesday
balking at Secretary of State Dul
les' suggestion that the offshore
island garrisons might be reduced
in event Red China agrees to a
cease-fire.
WASHINGTON (/P)—Secretary
of State Dulles sought to reassure
Chiang Kai-shek Thursday of con
tinued U.S. support for his Na
tionalist China government.
Dulles sent a message to For
mosa in the wake of Chiang's out
cry Wednesday against state
ments by Dulles the day before.
Dulles said Thursday he wanted
to straighten out confusion com
pounded—what he called "an ex
aggerated idea of a shift of posi
tion on our part . . . misinterpret
ing the misinterpretation."
