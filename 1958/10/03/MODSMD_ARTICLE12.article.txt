## 
### 
The Rev. Charles B. Foelsch,
president of the Pacific Lutheran
Theological Seminary in Berke
ley, will he the guest preacher
this Sunday at Memorial Church
for the 11 a.m. Matriculation Sun
day service, the first regular serv
ice of the academic year. His ser
mon title is "Witnesses."
Reading the scripture lessons
will be John Bohn and Clee Hou
ser, president and vice-president
of the ASSU.
Dr. Foelsch, who was graduated
from Chicago Lutheran Seminary
and received the Ph.D. degree
from the University of Pitts
burgh, has served churches in
Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C.,
Charleston and New York City.
He was president of the Chicago
Lutheran Seminary for five years,
and since 19:52 has been president
of the new Pacific Lutheran Sem
inary.
At this service the University
will also honor the memory of
two retired professors who died
during the summer, William Fred
erick Durand, emeritus professor

of mechanical engineering and
dean of American aeronautical
engineering, and Aurelio M. Espi
nosa, former head of the Romanic
Languages Department.
Dr. Durand, who taught at
Stanford from 1904 until his re
tirement in 1924, was 99 years of
age at the time of his death on
Aug. 11. An honor graduate of
the U.S. Naval Academy in 1880,
his career ranged from naval of
ficer to scientist, teacher, author,
architect and inventor. Among
his most noted inventions are
semi-logarithm paper, a type of
graph paper now used as a T
square, and the theory of ship
propellers, a discovery which led
him into the field of aviation. At
the age of 82 Dr. Durand was
called to Washington, D.C., to or
ganize the World War II program
for designing and producing jet
propelled engines.
Provost Frederick C. Terman
said of Dr. Durand, "He has con
tributed as much as any man to
the development of the airplane.
He represents to a high degree

the type of creative, pioneering
mind that has been the true
strength of American engineer
ing and science. Stanford is
proud to have counted him a
member of its faculty for more
than half a century and joins the
entire engineering world in
mourning his death."
