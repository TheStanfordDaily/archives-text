## Signs Unnecessary 
### 
There are two "sentinels" guarding the women of Lagunita —
and they are not Honor and Discretion nor the two women who
lock the door each night promptly at 2:30.
We speak rather of the STOP signs on either side of the dorm,
put up a year and a half ago to "protect" Lag women and visitors
from cars speeding out to Los Arboles Road as a short cut to
Foothill Road.
At the time, these signs served as a safety measure and were
effective in the job. That was a proper use of STOP signs, and
that was also a year and a half ago.
Last September, however, Los Arboles Road was closed. What
was a short cut became a dead end. What was once a speedway
became a private drive for the women of Lagunita and Roble.
No longer do cars pass Lagunita; they all stop there. For all
practical purposes, it is the end of the road.
The reason for which the STOP signs were put up is no longer
valid, and they have become only a nuisance.
We would like to see our Police Department be as hasty in
taking down the signs which have outlived their usefulness as it
was diligent and efficient in putting them up when they were
needed.
