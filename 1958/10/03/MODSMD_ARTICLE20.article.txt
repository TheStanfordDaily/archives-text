## Knowland's Chances For Governor Slim 
### Leo Krulitz 
To many people the political
question foremost in their mind
as the fall elections approach is
how does Senator William Know
land actually expect to make up
the 600,000 - vote deficit that
showed up in his primary record
last June.
To 1 h e s e people candidate
Knowland and his campaign
forces had an answer ready.
First, to alleviate a little of the
pessimism, the Knowland group
dusted off the official records of
another gubernatorial race back
in 1934. The race between Repub
lican Governor Frank Merriam
and Democrat Upton Sinclair, the
controversial a u th o r-politician,
showed the Democratic candidate
leading in the primaries by more
than 900,000 votes.
Of course Governor Merriam
reversed this in November and
was re-elected by 259,083 votes.
Statistically speaking, Know
land explained where he was go
ing to make up those 600,000 votes
this way:
!. He hopes to hold the 300,-
000 Democrats that voted for
him in tin; primaries and ex
pand that number to 500,000 or
000,000.
2. Two million people didn't
vote in the primary election and
Knowland is hoping to get the
greater share of them this* No
vember.
3. Knowland hopes to recap
ture about half of the Repub
licans that voted for Brown.

The Democrat drew about 24
per cent of llie Republican <«uli
ernatorial vote and Knowland
wants to en I it to 10 per cent in
November.
Knowland doesn't give the rea
sons why a large number of Dem
ocrats will vote for him in Nov
ember and at this time no new
issue has developed that would
indicate this switch.
Perhaps Knowland will get a
large number of the people that
didn't vote in the primaries but
with registration figures that
show one million more Democrats
than Republicans in the state, the
simple odds are that the majority
of people not voting were Demo
crats.
The Republicans that voted for
Brown probably did so because of
Knowland's stand on the Right to
Work issue. If this is the case
it might be pretty hard to change
a persons mind on as controver
sial an issue as this.
S ii m in in g up—Knowland's
chances of making up (500,000
votes are at best a "maybe,
hut...".
To Whom It May Concern:
The California Prohibition Party
held their state convention in
August. Seven delegates present.
A Republican assemblyman,
Charles E. Chapel ( R.-Inglewood t
in an aside credited "One of our
idiots" with unifying the Cali
fornia Democrats. "Idiot" not
identified.
According to Attorney General
Brown, his opponent is "Weasel
ing Will" Knowland.
