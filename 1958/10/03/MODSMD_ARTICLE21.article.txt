Freshmen here don't know how
lucky they are. Stanford seems
to be one of the few schools with
no freshman hazing. At the U. of
Connecticut, freshmen are wel
comed (?) with a "Pied Piper Pa
rade," for which required dress
for women is "a skirt to reach no
longer than six inches above the
knees, a largo hair ribbon, pref
erably blue and white, a bar of
soap and some type of stuffed
animal." The men wear "paja
mas or a night shirt, any type of
neckwear and a towel." Can't you
just see something like THAT
promenading around Inner
Quad?
A "Symphony of Sneezes 1 " is
being performed on the Univer
sity of Kansas campus accord
ing to the Daily Kansaiv. "In
strumentalists" are students af
flicted with hay fever, caused
by the amount of ragweed in
the area, their health service
states. The campus apparently
has no lack of "musicians,"
though the article doesn't men
lion if they're all in the same
key. Let's hope such an orches
tra isn't begun here, for with
Prof. Salgo 011 leave no telling
what hick of harmony would
result!
"Are We the 'Beat' Genera
lion?" inquires the Rocky Moun
tain Collegian, newspaper of Col
orado State. Its answer is "NO!"
and it cites excerpts from essays
by Princeton graduates of 1957 as

proof. These include such desires
as a creative vocation, an increas
ing awareness, a religion. Bel the
North Beaehers wouldn't blink an
eye or move a whisker over that.
One hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($150,000) to burn up
some trash! Sound incredible?
That's the sum that Washington
State has just spent for its newly
constructed incinerator. The first
test of usage found it "passing
with flying smokestack," the Ev
ergreen reports, as GOOO pounds
of varied discards were burned in
an hour and 45 minutes.
I'm afraid the editor of the
University Daily Kansan must
be rather disillusioned about
life. About freshmen, anyway.
In his opening editorial lie
states that the reasons fresh
men enter college are, in order,
parties, social climbing, hus
band-hunting, draft-dodging, a
four - year vacation with the
privileges of adulthood and
none of the responsibilities, and
last and least, education.
He says "they |freshmen] will
fill our favorite bars with the nox
ious sounds of rock and roll, hill
billy music, and their own yap
ping voices. They will talk inter
minably at the drop of a cliche
about psychology, sex, beer, sex,
parties, sex, religion, fraternities
and sex." I'm glarl WE don't have
any freshmen that fit this descrip
tion!

any freshmen that fit this descrip

Freshmen here don't know how
lucky they are. Stanford seems
to be one of the few schools with
no freshman hazing. At the U. of
Connecticut, freshmen are wel
comed (?) with a "Pied Piper Pa
rade," for which required dress
for women is "a skirt to reach no
longer than six inches above the
knees, a largo hair ribbon, pref
erably blue and white, a bar of
soap and some type of stuffed
animal." The men wear "paja
mas or a night shirt, any type of
neckwear and a towel." Can't you
just see something like THAT
promenading around Inner
Quad?
A "Symphony of Sneezes 1 " is

"Are We the 'Beat' Genera

orado State. Its answer is "NO!"
and it cites excerpts from essays
by Princeton graduates of 1957 as

proof. These include such desires
as a creative vocation, an increas

North Beaehers wouldn't blink an
eye or move a whisker over that.
One hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($150,000) to burn up
some trash! Sound incredible?
That's the sum that Washington
State has just spent for its newly
constructed incinerator. The first
test of usage found it "passing
with flying smokestack," the Ev
ergreen reports, as GOOO pounds
of varied discards were burned in
an hour and 45 minutes.
I'm afraid the editor of the
University Daily Kansan must
be rather disillusioned about
life. About freshmen, anyway.
In his opening editorial lie
states that the reasons fresh
