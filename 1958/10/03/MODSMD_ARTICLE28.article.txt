A repeat performance of the
1957 showing of "Stanford-North
western" will be the best tonic the
J Indians could get Sat urday in
Evanston, Illinois, when they
make their third try for victory
I number one of the year.
One-sided losses to Washington
State (40-6) and Rice (30-7), plus
Northwestern's surprising 29-28
win over the same WSC club have
| combined to make Ara Parsegh
ian's men 14-point favorites.
It all adds up to quite a switch
! from a month ago, when it looked
as though the Wildcats would be
i one team Stanford could beat
without too awfully much trouble.
Unfavorable Odds
Though the odds are against
I hem, ihe Cards do have history
On their side. In what was rated
as a toss-up last year, the team of
then-coach Chuck Taylor came up
with one of their best offensive
' shows of the season to register
I an easy 26-6 victory.

Looking further back to the
other two meetings between the
two clubsâ€”both in the '30's one
finds a 20-0 triumph for Stanford
and a scoreless tie.
Jack Curtice's biggest problem
after the first two games has been
to repair the sieve which has
served as a defensive line.
Nobody Told
A corps of letterman returnees
was supposed to make the line a
strong point of the '58 Cards, but
apparantly someone forgot to tell
this to Washington State and
Rice.
The two winners averaged 282.5
yards each against the porous
Indian line to give Stanford the
second-worse rush defense in the
Pacific Coast Conference.
If North western's ground-gain
ing figures against WSC are any
indication, though, this already
poor figure for the Cards may be
even worse by Saturday night.
Good Yardage
The Wildcats picked up a whop
ping 336 yards on the ground
against an admittedly-not-too
strong Cougar line, with halfback
Ron Burton contributing 164 of
the yards.
In an effort to bolster the sag
ging defense, Jack Curtice, has

split his men into a platoon setup.
He'll take advantage of this year's
liberalized substitution rules to
use what is nominally his first
team on offense.
But whenever the firsts need a
rest, they'll get it in a situation
where the second unit can go in
on defense.
Defense
Moved onto this defensive spe
cialist unit are ends Trev Grimm
and Tom McDonald, tackles Dean
Hinshaw and Chris Plain, guards
Don Dawson and Larry Lacey,
linebackers Doug Pursell and
Doug Dick, halfbacks Mac Wylie
and Roy Stephen, and safetyman
Sid Garber.
The first, or offensive team,
will probably be made up of ends
Chris Burford and lrv Nicolai,
tackles Troy Bar bee and Eric
Protiva, guards Bob Peterson and
Russ Steele, center Roch Conklin,
quarterback Dick Norman, half
backs John Bond and Dick Bow
ers, and fullback Gil Dowd.
A key question which will need
a "yes" answer if Stanford is to
have much hope for the rest of
the year concerns Norman. His
passing, though not long, has been
effective and consistent in two
games against teams not noted

for having the strongest of pass
defense.
If he can maintain his 60 per
cent completion average against
a team that beat Bobby Newman,
the best passer in the country,
then it will begin to look for sure
that Norman is here to stay as a
top thrower.
Curtice has worked this week
on trying to install something in
the long-pass department that will
work for Stanford. Lack of speed
among the receivers has limited
Norman to short tosses. Unless a
little variety can be developed in
the aerial game, it won't take
future opponents long to stack
their defenses against the short
stuff.
Little Doubt
There can be little doubt that
the Indians will need to make a
creditable, if not winning, show
ing to salvage something for the
rest of the season.
A third straight one-sided loss
could make it tough for Curtice
to keep things happy in the
morale department. On the other
hand if Stanford can come up
with as much improvement this
week as it displayed in the first
half against Rice last Saturday,
it at least won't be a non-winning
season.
