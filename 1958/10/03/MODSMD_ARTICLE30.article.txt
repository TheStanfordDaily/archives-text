# KEY LOOP CLASHES
## WSC-Cal, Bruins-OSC Highlight Grid Weekend 
### 
Two league games and more of those tough intersectionals are on
tap for Pacific Coast Conference teams this week. Washington State,
although upset last week by Northwestern, carries a 1-0 league mark
into action against winless California in Berkeley while the single
wing powers, Oregon State and UCLA, clash in the other conference
tilt, at Corvallis. I

In non-conference action, where
PCC schools posted a 3-5 record
last week, Oregon draws a real
test in Oklahoma, Southern Cali
fornia hosts North Carolina,
Washington meets powerful Ohio
State, Idaho meets Utah and
Stanford travels to Northwest
ern.
A great battle of quarterbacks
looms in the Cougar-Bear clash.
WSC's Bobby Newman, defending
national total offense champion

and the Coast's top passer, will be
up against Cal's versatile Joe
Kapp, who currently a
slight edge in PCC total offense
figures. The Cougars romped
over Stanford, 40-6, to open their
season but were waylayed by
Northwestern last week, 29-28. It
will be the first conference game
for the Bears, who have been
dumped by College of Pacific and
Michigan State thus far.
At Corvallis, two sputtering
teams rated 1-2 in the loop at the
season's start come together.
Both OSC and UCLA were upset
in openers and came back to score
tight victories in intersectional
action last week.
Oregon runs into the nation's
! No. 1 team when it travels to
I Norman, Okla., to meet the Soon
j ers. Oklahoma hammered a
strong West Virginia team, 47-14,
in its opener last week. Oregon
has played only one game, dump
ing Idaho, 27-0, two weeks ago.
Surprising Washington, the
league's only other unbeaten
eleven, is in almost as tough a
spot with Ohio State, currently
No. 2 in the land. The Huskies al
ready hold one Big Ten upset this
year, knocking off Minnesota, 24-
20, last Saturday.
Jim Tatum's North Carolina
Tarheels bring a 0-2 record to
the Coliseum to meet the vastly
improved Trojans. NC was ex
pected to have one of its finest
seasons this year, but was
knocked off on successive Satur
days by North Carolina State and
Clemson. USC, after its smashing
21-0 triumph over OSC in the
opener, dropped a one-point de
cision to Michigan last week.
Idaho will be seeking its first
victory tomorrow night against a
weakened Utah team. After its
opening loss to Oregon, the Van
dals were nipped, 14-10, by Mis
souri last Saturday.
