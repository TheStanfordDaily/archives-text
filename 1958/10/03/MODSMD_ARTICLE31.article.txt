# Milwaukee Now Two Up on Yankees; Burdette Helps Self With 2-on Homer
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE f/P) — Lew Bur
dette, still a hero, smashed a
three-run homer capping a seven
run first inning Thursday that
carried the Milwaukee Braves to
a 13-5 victory over the New York
Yankees and a 20 lead in the
World Series.
Burdette, the angular right
hander who whipped the Yanks

three times last year, Jost his
scoreless inning streak at 24 to
an unearned run in the first in
ning and; leading 13-2, was rocked
for three runs in the ninth on
homers by Hank Bauer and Mick
ey Mantle.
He allowed seven hits, struck
out five, walked one and retired

15 batters in order between the
fourth and ninth in pitching his
victory over the American
fourth straight complete game
League champions.
Don Lar.sen, the perfect game
pitcher of the 1956 series, will
pitch for the Yanks in the third
game. Handicapped by a sore
right elbow, Larsen returned to
duty in late September.
Manager Fred Haney said he
would not announce his third

game pitcher until after Friday's
workout. The best guess was
Carlton Willey, 27. a rookie who
completed a 9-7 record after his
recall from Wichita in mid-May.
The veteran Bob Rush—lo-6—also
was a possibility.
