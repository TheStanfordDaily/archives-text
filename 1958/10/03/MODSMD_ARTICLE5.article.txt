### 
MOSCOW (/P) — I The Soviet Un
ion announced Thursday night it
has resumed nuclear test bla-sting,
after a six-month suspension.
The Soviet acknowledgment
came within an hour after Wash
ington had announced detection of
the second pair of Soviet blasts
this week. The first were Tuesday.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko had announced before
the Supreme Soviet March 31 the
decision to stop the tests.
Tass news agency accused the
United States and Britain of using
the Soviet test suspension "to se
cure the greatest possible military
advantage for their side, thus ig
noring the will of the peoples."
"This is evidenced," it added,
"by the fact that precisely after
March 31—that is, the moment
the Soviet Union suspended nu
clear tests and called upon other
countries to follow suit—the gov
ernments of the United States and
the United Kingdom undertook
the biggest ever series of tests of
atomic and hydrogen weapons.
"The United States alone has
set off about 40 nuclear shots dur
ing this period.
"Considering this," Tass added,
"the Soviet government cannot
allow the security interests of the
Soviet state to suffer because of
such actions of the United States
and the United Kingdom."
