(Editor's Note: This article
is tin* first of a series on the
problem of integration. Our in
tention in presenting the series
is to inform Stanford students
about the integration problem
as it exists in the South, and
about the opinions of others,
including their own political
leaders and candidates, in or
der that they may vote in the
Nov. I election with concrete
regard to one of the issues in
volved.)

"I think we must obey the law;
that is the important thing. Bit'
in Little Rock they arc Southern
ers first and Americans second, so
they don't care about the law set
by the Supreme Court."
That is the view of a Juno 1958
graduate of Little Rock's contro
versially integrated Central High
School now attending Stanford as
a freshman.
"All of my friends were in favor
of integration," she said. "There
wore only about 70 students out
of a student body of 2000 who
were agitators.
"Some of the kids there had
never conceived of Negroes as hu
man beings, and they still don't.
They consider them slaves, and
there are some churches there
which preach that the Negro was

meant to be a slave.
"But the student leaders in Cen
tral High all wondered, 'What can
I do to help?' "
This girl, whose life was later
threatened for inviting a Negro
to sit at her lunch table, said that
tilings were quiet among the stu
dents as soon as they found they
couldn't get away with anything.
"1 admired those e i g h t Ne
groes," she said, "more than any
other human beings, for all that
I hey went through.
"There were rumors they were
paid to go to that school, but this
wasn't true. Nobody would go
through what they did for money.
!foods, )" Students
"The kids who caused trouble
and led the fight against integra
tion were the lower-class 'hoods.'
They were the 'D'-student type
who used horrible, dirty language
and were not respected in school.
"But most of us wondered what
we could (h» to help. The more re
ceded girls invited the Negro
girls to join their teams in class,
but we couldn't he too friendly
because that created more ten
sion.
"The students at Central High
were aware of the world implica
tions of what happened there,"
she said, "but we couldn't do any
thing about it. These were many
kids who were strongly in favor

of integration whose parents were
more strongly opposed lo it. That
I was the problem.

"Anything that students wanted
to say to the press had to be
cleared through the principal's of

fice. I heard that some kids were
paid up to $100 for stories.
"Things were quiet most of the
year. There were Guardsmen
around the school all the time,
but not much happened.
l\o Socializing
"There was no socializing; the
Negroes didn't go to any of our
dances, and I don't think they
went to any of our football games.
"We all thought that all of the
pressures which had been build
ing up all year might explode at
graduation, but fortunately noth
ing happened.
"There was a huge crowd at
school the first day last year
photographers, newsmen, police.
But there was no real violence.
"The first day the Negroes were
not admitted to school; they final
ly came on the fourth day and
stayed about half the day. They
were always brought in cars and
they always came late, because
people were so irritated. On the
first day a lot of white mothers
came to school to get their kids.
"Really, it looked funny; to
come to school and find it re
inforced with Guardsmen and ma
chine guns sort of ridiculous.
Ignorant of Kcason
"Outside of the school t here
were mobs. You could tell that
most of them weren't from Little

Rock. They wero .junky people
people whom you could toll wore
ignorant of reason, l'aets."
From the viewpoint of one who
has seen strong feelings on into
gration, and who favors it herself,
she explains why she thinks that
Southerners oppose integration.
"The people are afraid that if
the Negroes are educated they
will be able to act as a group and
take over. But I think that if they
are educated they would change
and there would He no danger.
"I know a very righteous, up
right Christian man in our church,
and that is why he is sincerely
opposed to integration.
"There are very strong feelings.
The Southern Baptist church got
up a petition against integration,
but our Southern Presbyterian
church united for integration ;o
Faubus called our ministers Com
munists.
"Our churches wanted to hold
off integration until they could
educate the people teach from
the pulpit but they couldn't.
