### A Review By C.L. Payne 
"Inside the Democratic Par
ty" (319 pp.) —Jack Redding'.
Bobbs-Merrill ($4 .50).
In this swiftly-moving book
Jack Redding combines his inti
mate knowledge of the goings-on
within the Democratic Party with
his own journalistic ability to pro
duce an enlightening and very
readable study of the practical as
pects of party politics in the
United States today.
Reddings credentials both as
a writer and as an authority on
the Democratic Party consist of
his experiences as publicity direc
tor of the Democratic National
Committee during the famous up
set campaign of 1948.
In holding this position Redd
ing not only produced copy for
public release, but he obtained a
comprehensive grasp of practical
politics as they are practiced with
in his party.
Election Day
With a chapter strongly resem
bling the climax of Edwin
O'Connor's The Last Hurrah, the
book opens at convention head
quarters on election day, Nov. 2.
1948. And in spite of knowing
that the election's outcome is a
foregone conclusion, the reader
becomes involved in the excite
ment of the early returns, the op
timism of Dewey, the indulgent
attitude of the press, and the
first signs of a trend toward
Truman. The excitement is main
tained through the "mislaying" of
25,000 votes in Ohio, the winning
of Illinois and the importance
of the returns from California.
The chapter ends with the con
cession of Dewey, the victory
statements of the Democrats, and
the almost incoherent voice of
India Edwards shouting "The best
man won! The best man won!"
Campaign View
Redding t hen proceeds to
present a view of the campaign as
seen by one who, while not a can
didate himself, was aclively part
icipating in the winning of the
election and in a position to ob
serve those who were the candi
dates. Moreover, Redding is in
terested nol so much in the in
herent value of the issues in
volved in the campaign, but in
the most effective means, both
fair and foul, by which these
issues were used to help the Dem
ocrats and harm the Republicans.
As a result the reader is afforded
insight into the importance of
minority-groups and how one goes
about getting their votes, the
value of good campaign movies
and how one coerces the movie
indusHry into "donating" Ihem
to the party, and the value of rec
ognizing the mistakes of one's
opponents and knowing how to
capitalize on them.
As a word of caution, the
reader must be prepared for Red

ding's undisguised bias in favor of
all things Democratic and against
all things Republican, Moreover,
Redding's personal regard for
Harry Truman is so high that the
former president appears to be a
candidate for canonization. This
lack of objectivity, however, in no
way impairs the value of the book.
"Inside the Democratic Party"
should be required reading for all
those who have any interest at
all in the American political scene,
no matter what their party affili
ation might be, for the insights
.Redding affords are not restricted
by party boundries. Moreover, the
book should be read by all persons
who intend, either now or in the
future, to lay claim to their right
to vote, for here the voter will
find the factors which the political
professionals think determine the
way we vote as individuals and
as a people.

mate knowledge of the goings-on
within the Democratic Party with
his own journalistic ability to pro
duce an enlightening and very
readable study of the practical as
pects of party politics in the
United States today.
Reddings credentials both as
a writer and as an authority on
the Democratic Party consist of
his experiences as publicity direc
tor of the Democratic National
Committee during the famous up
set campaign of 1948.
In holding this position Redd
ing not only produced copy for
public release, but he obtained a
comprehensive grasp of practical
politics as they are practiced with
in his party.
Election Day
With a chapter strongly resem
bling the climax of Edwin
O'Connor's The Last Hurrah, the
book opens at convention head
quarters on election day, Nov. 2.
1948. And in spite of knowing
that the election's outcome is a
foregone conclusion, the reader
becomes involved in the excite
ment of the early returns, the op
timism of Dewey, the indulgent
attitude of the press, and the
first signs of a trend toward
Truman. The excitement is main
tained through the "mislaying" of
25,000 votes in Ohio, the winning
of Illinois and the importance
of the returns from California.
The chapter ends with the con
cession of Dewey, the victory
statements of the Democrats, and
the almost incoherent voice of
India Edwards shouting "The best
man won! The best man won!"
Campaign View
Redding t hen proceeds to
present a view of the campaign as
seen by one who, while not a can
didate himself, was aclively part
icipating in the winning of the
election and in a position to ob
serve those who were the candi
dates. Moreover, Redding is in
terested nol so much in the in
herent value of the issues in
volved in the campaign, but in
the most effective means, both
fair and foul, by which these
issues were used to help the Dem
ocrats and harm the Republicans.
As a result the reader is afforded
insight into the importance of
minority-groups and how one goes
about getting their votes, the
value of good campaign movies
and how one coerces the movie
indusHry into "donating" Ihem
to the party, and the value of rec
ognizing the mistakes of one's
opponents and knowing how to
capitalize on them.
As a word of caution, the
reader must be prepared for Red

ding's undisguised bias in favor of
all things Democratic and against
all things Republican, Moreover,
Redding's personal regard for
Harry Truman is so high that the
former president appears to be a
candidate for canonization. This
lack of objectivity, however, in no
way impairs the value of the book.
"Inside the Democratic Party"
should be required reading for all
those who have any interest at
all in the American political scene,
no matter what their party affili
ation might be, for the insights
.Redding affords are not restricted
by party boundries. Moreover, the
book should be read by all persons
who intend, either now or in the
future, to lay claim to their right
to vote, for here the voter will
find the factors which the political
professionals think determine the
way we vote as individuals and
as a people.
