# Seniors, juniors, Sophomores Hold Reunions; Freshmen Meet in Library
## 
### 
Fall quarter, 1958, and Stanford
students fell into the "old grind"
and traditional routine with spir
it, vigor and enthusiasm.
The seniors, serious and wise in
their old age, started their first
week end back on The Farm at
3 p.m. Friday at The Cellar as
senior class president John Wil
helmy began the 11th annual
Olympic Day race as the first of
21 toga-clad, torch - bearing run
ners.
The runners relayed the torch
from The Cellar past the golf
course and along Alpine Road to
its final resting place at Ros
sotti's.
The 20 senior men, accompa
nied by a cavalcade of cars, passed
the torch to Miss X, who was
waiting a few hundred yards from
the finish point. She ran through
Rossotti's and extinguished the
torch which had caused a cer
tain amount of confusion among
the patrons in the toilet bowl of
the women's rest room.

Junior Reunion
Feeling their responsibilities as
newly-arrived upperclassmen, the
juniors rose to the cause, aban
doned their beloved bridge games
early in the day and distinguished
themselves in the finest Stanford
tradition.
The sophomore class held its
annual reunion Saturday after

noon from 2 to 6 at Mama Gar
cia's. Special guests of the sopho
more class this year were two
"good-will" representatives from
the ABC, who were the toasts of
the almost toastless party.
The freshman class meanwhile
held its first big function of the
year on campus. The Freshman
Party was held Saturday, from 8
a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday, 1 to 5
p.m.. in the stacks, the reserve
book room and the reading room
of the Main Library.
