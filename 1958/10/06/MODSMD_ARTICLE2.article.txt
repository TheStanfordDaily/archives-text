# New Construction Includes Medical Center, Stern Wings, Profs' Residences
## 
### Jack Clumeck 
The face of the Stanford cam
pus seems ever to be changing as
new construction seems always to
be in progress. Ranging from a
Medical Center to professors'
homes and undergraduate resi
dences, the Stanford campus is
growing daily to meet the chang
ing needs of an up-to-date univer
sity.
Outstanding among the addi
tions to the campus is the $20 mil
lion Medical Center, one of the
largest medical construction pro
grams undertaken in the United
States. Ready for use bv students
of medicine and by the Palo AHo-
Stanford Hospital in September
of 1959, the first s'age of the cen
ter will include over 12 acres of
floor space.
Seven Buil 3'n;vs
Initially the three-story center
will consist of three hospital and
four Medical School buildings, all
interconnected aro un d op en
courtyards and patios to form a
"garden hospital."
By all indications, work is pro
ceeding according to schedule. A
good part of the concrete exterior
of the "first-stage" construction
is completed.
"Stage-two" construction, slat
ed tf> begin a Per the Medical
Center begins operations, will in
clude an additional medical sci
ence building and space for the
pro-clinical departments anato
my, bacteriology and physiology
already located on campus in
existing buildings. Including en
dowment, cost of this expansion
would be another $20 million.
Pine liill Homes
On the other side of the cam
pus, beyond Wilbur Mali out in
the fields below Pine Hill Road,
lies another area of current con
struction. The Pine Hill subdi
vision is to provide a much
needed housing area for many of
Stanford's professors.
Professors build I heir homes on
Stanford land, rented on a long
term basis, and it is obvious from
the growing number of homes in
(his area that many are taking
advantage of this opportunity.
For the most part, streets and
sewers are laid, and homes are in
various stages of completion:
from foundations and excava
tions, to framed houses and near
ly-ready-for-occupancy homes of
one or two floors.
This development will continue
to grow as Stanford's instruction
al stciff enlarges, providing hous
ing for a good many years to
come.
Stem Hall Wings
About mid-way between these
two new developments are Ihe
final two wings of Lucie Stern
Hall for undergraduate men.
Housing 191 men, the three-story j
buildings have all but 10 double
rooms, providing a bed, desk,
wardrobe closet and built-in fa
cilities for each occupant.
The final wings cost approxi
mately $1 million, with Iho Uni
versity sharing the cost with the
Stern estate. Completed for oceu-1
paney at the opening of this quar- j
ter, telephone service is at pres-1
ent being extended into the new
wings. i

lion Medical Center, one of the
largest medical construction pro
grams undertaken in the United
States. Ready for use bv students
of medicine and by the Palo AHo-
Stanford Hospital in September
of 1959, the first s'age of the cen
ter will include over 12 acres of
floor space.
Seven Buil 3'n;vs
Initially the three-story center
will consist of three hospital and
four Medical School buildings, all
interconnected aro un d op en
courtyards and patios to form a
"garden hospital."
By all indications, work is pro
ceeding according to schedule. A
good part of the concrete exterior
of the "first-stage" construction
is completed.
"Stage-two" construction, slat
ed tf> begin a Per the Medical
Center begins operations, will in
clude an additional medical sci
ence building and space for the
pro-clinical departments anato
my, bacteriology and physiology
already located on campus in
existing buildings. Including en
dowment, cost of this expansion
would be another $20 million.
Pine liill Homes
On the other side of the cam
pus, beyond Wilbur Mali out in
the fields below Pine Hill Road,
lies another area of current con
struction. The Pine Hill subdi
vision is to provide a much
needed housing area for many of
Stanford's professors.
Professors build I heir homes on
Stanford land, rented on a long
term basis, and it is obvious from
the growing number of homes in
(his area that many are taking
advantage of this opportunity.
For the most part, streets and
sewers are laid, and homes are in
various stages of completion:
from foundations and excava
tions, to framed houses and near
ly-ready-for-occupancy homes of
one or two floors.
This development will continue
to grow as Stanford's instruction
al stciff enlarges, providing hous
ing for a good many years to
come.
Stem Hall Wings
About mid-way between these
two new developments are Ihe
final two wings of Lucie Stern
Hall for undergraduate men.
Housing 191 men, the three-story j
buildings have all but 10 double
rooms, providing a bed, desk,
wardrobe closet and built-in fa
cilities for each occupant.
The final wings cost approxi
mately $1 million, with Iho Uni
versity sharing the cost with the
Stern estate. Completed for oceu-1
