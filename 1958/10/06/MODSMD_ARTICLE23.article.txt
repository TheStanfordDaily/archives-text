# NEW ERA BEGINS
## Fifth Republic Now Official; Elections in Four Months 
### 
PARIS (/P) â€”The Fifth French Republic came into being Sunday.
Frenchmen hope it will give them a more stable government and
renewed confidence from abroad.
The republic's constitution, approved a week ago in a referendum,
was published Sunday in the government journal. Thus Oct. 5, 1958,

for history's sake, becomes the
birthday of the Fifth Republic.
Within the next four months
elections will be held for a new
parliament that Premier Charles
de Gaulle will establish. Many
expect the 67-year-old premier to
be a candidate for the presidency.
The presidency will be a much
more powerful office than it has
been heretofore.
In the next six months, a new
French "community of nations"
will be established, including
those eligible overseas territories
which approved the constitution.
Only Guinea in West Africa
turned it down and thus became
independent.
The new constitution takes
much power from Parliament
and invests it in the executive,
shared by a president and a pro

mier. Parliament will probably
have about 460 members instead
of the present 595 and will not be
able to unseat a premier with
such irresponsible ease as in the
past. France had 26 governments
in the 13 years si/ice World War
11.
The official government jour
nal also published final figures
for last Sunday's empirewide ref
erendum. The constitution was
approyed by a vote, of 31,066,502
to 5,419,749.
