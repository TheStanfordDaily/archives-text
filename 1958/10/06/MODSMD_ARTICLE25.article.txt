considered a top contender for

sy's "Wow Boys" in 1941.
Gary Craig of Riverside, Calif.,
and Hal Steuber from Long Beach
will make halfback competition

tough, while Toby Hecker of Al
tadena looms high in the picture
at end. Chris Cottle of Morning
side High in Los Angeles and Jim
Moe of Edina, Minn., figure
prominently at tackle, and Dave
Nolan of San Carlos is rated high
at guard.
A candidate for halfback is Pat
Wilkinson from Norman, Okla.,
son of the most successful coach
in football today, Bud Wilkinson
of teh Oklahoma Sooners. There
are also two prospects from Pu
nahou School in Honolulu, end
