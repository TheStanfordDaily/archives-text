# SPAHN AGAIN, 3-0
## Braves Need One More 
### 
NEW YORK (/Pi — Warren
Spahn shut out the New York
Yankees on two hits Sunday as
the Milwaukee Braves won the
fourth game of the World Series,
3-0. This puts the Braves ahead
in games 3 to 1.
Red Schoendienst, Braves sec
ond baseman, stopped a Yankee
rally in the fourth with a spar
kling stop of a hard smash by
Vogi Berra and sf ; up the Braves'
first score in the sixth with a
booming triple to center. He
scored when Johnny Logan's
grounder went through Tony Ku
bek's legs for an error.
The Braves need only one more
victory to win their second con
secutive world championship. The
i wo teams meet again Monday,
with Bob Turley pitching for the
Yankees and Lew Burdette for
the Braves.
The Braves scored one run in

the seventh when Del Crandall ]
drew a base on balls, went to third
on Andy Pafko's double and came
home on Spahn's single.
Milwaukee scored again in the
eighth on consecutive doubles by
Logan and Eddie Mathews.
Spahn also won the first game
of the series, 4-3. in 10 innings.
Sunday he issued only two walks
and struck out seven.
The Yankees, trailing 3-1 in
games, now find themselves in
most desperate straits. Only once
has a team come back to win a
seven-game Series a 112 t e r losing
three games. That was Pittsburgh
against Washington in 1925. Ear
lier, the 1903 Boston Red Sox
made a similar recovery against
Pittsburgh in a best-of-nine set.
Shaky defensive play by left
fielder Norm Siebern, who fal
tered, stumbled and failed to catch
four balls in his area, contributed

to Yankee pitcher Whitey Ford's
downfall.
The young man had such a
rough day in the sunny field that
some of the 71,503 fans grumbled,
"Take him out." When he finally
grabbed Logan's long fly for the
last out in the ninth, there was a
rousing cheer.
Spahn simply was superb in
turning back the Yanks for the
second time in this Series, lie was
sharper than he was on opening
day, when he bested Ford and
Ryne Duron in 10 innings, 4-3.
The clever veteran drew a tre
mendous cheer from the big crowd
when he came to the plate to lead
off the ninth inning.
For the knockout punch in Mon
day's fifth game at Yankee Sta
dium. manager Fred Haney has
Lew Burdelte, his Yankee-killer,
who has beaten the club four
straight times.
