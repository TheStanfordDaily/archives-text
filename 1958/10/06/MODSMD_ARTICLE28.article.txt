# Bears, Beavers Record Loop Victories; Oh-So-Close for Webfoots, Huskies
## 
### 
California catapulted into the
Rose Bowl picture, Oregon State's
rugged Beavers dug in for their
second straight shutout and Ore
gon once again showered itself
with glory only to fall short of
victory in the weekend's Pacific
Coast Conference football action.
In other games involving loop
teams, Washington nearly pulled
a major upset but had to absorb
its first defeat of the season, a
12-7 loss to Ohio State; North
Carolina journeyed across the
country to knock off Southern
California, 8-7, on the strength
of a two - point conversion, aad
Idaho completely stifled Lee
Grosscup and his Utah mates
again, 20-0.
Elliott Gets llide
Cal coach Pete Elliott was given
his second ride from the field in
two years- for it was the Bears'
second victory in that period
after his club had hammered a
favored Washington State team,
34-14. It was the Cougars' first

conference loss and gave them a
1-2 record for the season.
WSC, with star ends Gail Cog
dill and Don Ellingsen sidelined
for almost the entire game with
injuries, outgained the Bears dur
ing the game hut bogged down in
touchdown territory. Cougar
passer Boh Newman completed
22 of 35 attempts, two of them
to Laßoy Rath for scores. But in
the overall picture, Cal's Joe
Kapp won quarterbacking hon
ors.
The Bears were given a number
of "breaks," but capitalized on
all of them. Early in the second
period, Jack Hart picked off a
Newman sideline pass and ran 55
yards unmolested for the score
that may have broken the Cou
gars' backs, putting the Bears
ahead, 14-0.
Beaver Defense Shines
Although sputtering once again
on offense, the Oregon State Bea
vers flexed their defensive mus
cles and knocked over UCLA, 14-
0, in Corvallis. A 50-yard pass in
terception runback by center
Bruce Hake broke up a scoreless
tie in the third period and sent
the Orange on the way to victory.
Last week, OSC had shut out
Kansas, 12-0. The triumph gave
the Beavers a 1-1 loop record.
•• It was a Sadly familiar story
for Oregon in Norman, Okla., as
the Ducks were nosed out by the
nation's No. 1 team, Oklahoma,
G-0. Last New Year's Day, the
Webfoots laughed at tremendous
odds and outplayed top - ranked
Ohio State in the Rose Bowl, only
to fall, 10-7. The story was simi
lar Saturday. The Sooners scored
their lone touchdown in the first
period, thanks to an Oregon fum
ble on the 17-yard line. The
Ducks outgained the Sooners,
261-156.
Huskies Nipped
Washington came just as close,
succumbing to a final quarter
touchdown for a 12-7 loss at Ohio
State. A pass interception in the
first period and a blocked punt

late in the third quarter led to
both OSU scores. Ear-h time, the
No. 3 ranked Buckeyes had to
drive 27 yards in seven plays.
At Los Angeles Friday night,
Southern California scored first
and kicked its extra point for a
7-0 lead. Then North Carolina
scored and made good on a two
point conversion for an 8-7 ad
vantage. From that point on, the
previously winless Tarheels held
tough to preserve an upset tri
umph.
Idaho, which rushed Lee Gross
cup into near-ineffectiveness last
year, had little trouble again in
setting down the Skyline Confer
ence kings, 20-0. Stubby Ken Hall
scored two touchdowns and
kicked two extra points in the
victory.
Conference action will be step
ped up this week as the season
nears the halfway mark. USC
meets Oregon in an important
battle Saturday night in Port
land. Washington State will try
to get back on the win trail, host
ing the tough Idaho Vandals, and
the surprisingly powerful Wash
ington Huskies meet Stanford in
the Indians' home grounds.
