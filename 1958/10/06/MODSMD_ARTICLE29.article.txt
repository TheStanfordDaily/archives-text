# No Jokes in Tribe Shower After Third Straight Loss
## 
### 
There isn't very much a coach i
can say after his team has drop
ped its third straight one-sided
football game. So that's what
Jack Currice had to say after
Stanford's 28-0 loss to Northwest
ern Saturday not very much.
Only two bright the In
dians' play came to Curtice's mind
in the brief and non-joke-filled
post mortem: (1) the quarter
backing of Bob Nieolet during
Stanford's belated first-half drive
that stopped on the one; and (2)
the punting of Rick McMillen.
Second-Hull Woes
Curtice said Saturday's perform
ance was like the Rice game in
that the Cards just ran out of gas
in the second half. Only this time,
the weather was a breezy and
clear 74 degrees instead of the
muggy 99 of a week ago.
Stanford worked all week on
perfecting its four-man umbrella
pass defense, and it looked good
part of the time. "But our guys
just don't rotate right all the
lime," noted Curtice. And that
cost the Cards a 45-yard TD pass
plus a few other nice gainers by
Northwestern.
Up in the line, there wasn't any

question of superiority. "Yes, I
think they outcharged us," Cur
tice said. He added that the sit
uation was just the opposite of
last year's, when the Indian for
ward wall manhandled the Wild
cats' line and gave Stanford a
one-sided victory.
Northwestern kept bambooz
ling the Indian quarterbacks with
a now-lay-back, now-red-dog de
fense that had Stanford continu
ally guessing. Could these tactics
have worked against an experi
enced team? Curtice was asked.
"No, I don't think so," he said.
As it was, the Wildcats would
leave themselves open in differ
ent areas, but the Tribe's play
calling failed to capitalize on
these shifting weaknessses.
Passing Is Off
With the exception of Nicolet's
brief spurt, the Stanford quarter
backs were well off in their pass
ing. Nieolet, Dick Norman and
Sid Garber all saw a fair amount
of action, but their showings left
Curtice with an "I haven't any
idea" reply when he was asked
who'd start against Washington
on Saturday.
