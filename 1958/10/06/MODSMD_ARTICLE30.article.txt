TON, 111., Oct. 4 — Stanford has
seven chances left to win a foot
ball game in 1958. But if the
Indians don't show more than
they did here today in a 28-0 loss
to Northwestern, even one vic
tory is going to be hard to get.
As in the Cards' two previous
losses this year, it was a case
of no sustained offensive and no
consistency on defense. North
western quickly found a weak
spot around the California ends,
and capitalized on this through
out the game to score once in
each period before 25,132 in per
fect 74-degree weather.
The loss was Stanford's first
shut-out defeat in 31 games, Ore
gon State having last adminis
tered the trick, 10-0, in 1955.
Close, But Not Quite
But the Cards did come close
to taking the big zero off the
scoreboard. Completed passes by
Dick Norman and Bob Nicolet,
plus an interference penalty
against Northwestern, put Stan
ford on the Wildcat 10-yard line
with three seconds to go in the
half.
Nicolet threw again, this itme
to Irv Nikolai, who made a bril
liant leaping catch in the coffin
corner but was knocked out on
the one-foot line as the gun sound
the one - foot line as the gun
sounded.
This one brief burst by Nicolet,
some excellent punting by Rick
McMillen and greatly improved
tackling on the part of the entire
Indian team were the only bright
spots in the showing against a
Northwestern club which has now
whipped two PCC foes this year
after going winless in 1957.
Although Northwestern had
been favored by two touchdowns
going into the battle, the final
margin was a big surprise since
the Wildcats didn't even use their
best breakaway runner. Wilmer
Fowler, a speedster halfback and
one of only two regular seniors in
the Wildcat line-up, was held out
because of a damaged leg.
Helped the Kicks
Although losing the opening
toss and thus kicking off, Stan
ford did get a wind advantage
during the first period. And it
looked as though this might pay
off early when the Wildcats were
held in check but could punt out
to only their own 48.
But here one of several un
timely and costly penalties hit the
Tribe, and the Indians eventually
wo un d up quick-kicking from
their own 33.
Jack Curtice's new version of
the quickie, where his quarter
back pitches out to a halfback
who then boots, worked a little
too well.
McMillen's low kick traveled 70
yards, rolling dead 3 yards into
the end zone.
After another kick exchange,
Ihe Wildcats began in earnest on
a 15-play drive that led to the
first touchdown.
Northwestern successfully pick
ed up first downs three times in
a row on third-down plays, mov
ing to the Stanford 20. The In
dians nearly held on their 12, but
halfback Mike Stock, playing in
Fowler's spot, picked up 3 on a
pitch-out. Two carries by work
horse halfback Ron Burton push-

Ed the ball on across the goal line,
with 2:08 to go in the period.
It didn't take the Wildcats long
to add to their score. Taking over
on their 22 after another good
McMillen quick kick. Northwest
ern moved to the Stanford 48 in
three plays.
And then it was like Rice all
over again when the Indians' four
man umbrella pass defense didn't
rotate the right way. End Fred
Williamson took advantage of the
left corner-backer's lapse to streak
into the open and take a perfect
throw from quarterback Dick
Thornton for the score.
After missing an earlier place
ment attempt, the Wildcats re
verted to the two-point conversion
try and succeeded, making the
score 14-0.
Not Much Else
Little happened during the rest
of the second period until Niro
let's last-minute splurge—but ii
was a few seconds late and a foot
short.
In the second half Stanford
couldn't do any more against the
shifting Wildcat defense than it
had in the first half. Northwest
ern effectively mixed up a line
backer rush and six-man lay-back
—and most of the time Stanford
was caught doing the wrong thing
against it.
The Indians got the ball for
only 11 plays in the entire third
quarter. Meanwhile Northwestern
got rolling on a 48-yard drive that
culminated when Burton picked
up his second touchdown on a 1-
yard slant at right end, 1:47 be
fore the end of the stanza.
What—Field Goal?
The game's most surprising
play came on a Stanford fourth
and-10 situation on the Wildcat 42
early in the final period.
Bob Nicolet lined up in tight
punt formation, but instead drop
kicked the ball in an apparent
field goal attempt. The ball went
off to the left and sputtered out
of bounds on the NW 1-yard line.
Midway through the fourth
quarter Stanford had another
good chance to avoid a blanking.
A poor punt put Stanford in con
trol on the Northwestern 29.
A 17-yard Nicolet-to-Tom Wil
liams pass moved the Indians to
the 12, but here Ihree incomplete
passes and an illegal forward lat
eral halted the short march.
Northwestern managed a final
score just seconds before the end
of the game as Ray Purdin bulled
over on a 1-vard plunge.
