## Parseghian Sees Cards In Same Cycle He Met 
### 
NORTHWESTERN' LOCKER
ROOM, EVANSTON, 111., Oct. 4-
Jn 1957, Ara Parsoghian had a
green team at Northwestern that
didn't win a game, but this year,
the same outfit hasn't lost yet.
Parseghian thinks Stanford is hit
ting this same cycle a year later,
after seeing his Wildcats man
handle the Indians today.
Parseghian didn't'think the 28-0
score was much of an indication
of the teams' respective abilities.
"They gave us fits," he said.
"Give them that first-half touch
down they just missed and a few
of the passes that were dropped,
and it would have been a tight
game."
Experience Hurts
Stanford was hurt by lack of
experience, he noted, just as was
his own team of a year ago. "But
as soon as they find themselves,
they'll be a tiger on somebody's
field."
Gil Dowd and Dick Norman
stood out in Parseghian's mind as
the best of the Cards. "Dowd will
be a good fullback," he said, "and
with seasoning, Norman will be a
good quarterback."
On his own side of the ledger,
Parseghian was "proud of our
young kids more than anything
else." Northwestern had only
one senior who played more than
a few minutes.

He gave full credit for Ihe de
fensive calls to center Jim Andre
otti, whose excellent mixing-up of
lay-hacks and red dogs frustrated
the Stanford attack, particularly
early in the game.
End Runs Work
The Wildcats had particular
success running around Stan
ford's ends. Was this in their
minds before the game? "No,"
said Parseghian. '"But when we
saw it worked so well, we natu
rally capitalized on it."
A surprise was Wilmer Fowl
er's not playing at all. Although
his leg trouble was no secret, it
was believed that Fowler would
see plenty of action. But Parse
ghian revealed that he had no in
tention of using his speedy half
back, even had the game been
close.
