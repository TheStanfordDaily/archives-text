# Cactus Wants Changes
## 
### 
There are going to be a few
changes made on the Stanford
practice field this week. That was
the word yesterday from head
coach Jack Curtice as he and his
Indians flew home from Illinois,
grimly facing the prospect of
meeiing a Washington team that
lost to Ohio State only 12-7.
Curtice said, after a night of
contemplation on his team's 28-0
loss to Northwestern, that he was
going to "find some guys who
can move the ball."
lie told his audience of Bay
Area sports writers that "if you
have the ball, you don't need de
fense."
To put some life into a thus-far
sagging offense, Curtice said he
was going to simplify the whole
system. "We might cut down to

about five plays that work," he
exclaimed.
By doing this, Curtice feels he'll
be able to improve the play-call
ing of his quarterbacks. The
Cards have been getting into so
many similar third-down situa
tions that opponents have had an
easy time getting ready to stop a
particular play.
Curtice noted that "the boys
have confidence we can move the
ball. Our own mistakes have been
the big problem so far."
Personnel-wise, injuries to Lar
ry Lacey and Dick Bowers will
necessitate some shuffling. Russ
Steele will go to right guard and
Gary Pike and Don Dawson will
switch to the left guard slot.
In the backfield, Jim Byrer will
move back to his left half spot,

and Mac Wylie shift to full.
Looking back at the Wildcat
game, Curtice found one more
ihing to be happy about- the In
dian tackling. This week, Card
defender s were more often
knocking the ball-carrier back in
stead of riding with him for three
or four yards.
The only problem seemed to be
getting close enough to the ball
carrier, especially when he ran
around the ends.
And, too, Curtice pointed up the
play of half hack Tom Williams,
who looked to be the best of the
Indians as far as shiftiness and
drive in open-field situations
were concerned.
Curtice said he planned to keep
the 145-pound Williams at the
flanker-half spot.

fense."
To put some life into a thus-far
sagging offense, Curtice said he
was going to simplify the whole
system. "We might cut down to

about five plays that work," he
exclaimed.
By doing this, Curtice feels he'll
be able to improve the play-call
ing of his quarterbacks. The
Cards have been getting into so
many similar third-down situa
tions that opponents have had an
easy time getting ready to stop a
particular play.
Curtice noted that "the boys
have confidence we can move the
ball. Our own mistakes have been
the big problem so far."
Personnel-wise, injuries to Lar
ry Lacey and Dick Bowers will
necessitate some shuffling. Russ
Steele will go to right guard and
Gary Pike and Don Dawson will
switch to the left guard slot.
In the backfield, Jim Byrer will
move back to his left half spot,

and Mac Wylie shift to full.
Looking back at the Wildcat
game, Curtice found one more
ihing to be happy about- the In
dian tackling. This week, Card
defender s were more often
knocking the ball-carrier back in
stead of riding with him for three
or four yards.
The only problem seemed to be
getting close enough to the ball
carrier, especially when he ran
around the ends.
And, too, Curtice pointed up the
play of half hack Tom Williams,
who looked to be the best of the
Indians as far as shiftiness and
drive in open-field situations
were concerned.
Curtice said he planned to keep
the 145-pound Williams at the
flanker-half spot.
