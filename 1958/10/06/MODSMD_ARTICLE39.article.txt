# Law Students to Receive Small Group Instruction
## 
### 
First â€¢ year law students may,
find themselves enjoying the life
of a guinea pig when a new and
cleverly contrived system of in
struction goes into effect this
quarter.
In his office Monday and Tues
day. Law Dean Carl 13. Spaeth told
incoming students that beginning
this year they would receive
small-group instruction in one of
the four major first-year courses.

Smaller groups scheduled consist
of not more than 36 pupils.
"The system has been set up in
an attempt to provide closer con
tact between students and faculty
as well as to iron out personal
study problems," Spaeth stated.
As a part of this more personal-1
ized instruction, examinations will;
be held throughout the year in |
preparation for the yearly finals
in June.
