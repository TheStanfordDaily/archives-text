## 
### 
| CLINTON, Tenn. (A 3 ) Three quick pre-dawn dynamite explosions
wrecked the interior of racially integrated Clinton High School Sun
day. Police Chief Francis Moore said, "It was a professional job."
"There's no doubt," he said, "that this dynamiting is connected
with integration of the school."
At Nashville, Governor Frank Clement termed the blasting "a

cowardly act" and offered a $5000
reward for the arrest and convic
tion of persons responsible for it.
Clinton and Anderson County of
ficials also said they would post
rewards, amounts to be deter
mined later.
Clement summoned Anderson
County ofifcials to Nashville for a
conference on the dynamiting.
It was the first sign of violence
at this school, nestled in this Cum
berland plateau town of 4000,
since sporadic disturbances broke
out when nine Negroes first were
admitted along with white stu
dents two years ago. Clinton is
20 miles northwest of Knoxville
in east Tennessee.

The explosions ripped apart 1(>
of 20 classrooms in the building.
Dist. Atty. Gen. J. H. McCartt,
after a personal inspection of the
structure, estimated the damage
at $300,000. Officials had estimat
ed the 33-ycar-old building, with
several recent additions, would
cost at least $800,000 to replace.
Classes for 850 white pupils and
10 Negroes were suspended indef
initely.
County Supt. James A. New
man said the Hoard of Education,
which supervises Clinton High,

held in it. Principal W. D. Hu
man said four churches offered
their facilities for temporary
classrooms.
The Tennessee Bureau of Iden
tification and State Highway Pa

Moore said lie had called in the

have a complete official report
before making any statement."
This was the second school
blast in Tennessee. A year ago
last September the Ilattie Cotton
Elementary School in Nashville
was damaged heavily by a similar
explosion. It came shortly after
the first grade of some of the
capital city's schools, including
Hat tie Cotton, admitted Negroes
and whites together.

previously all-white Clinton High
in August, 1956, under a U.S. Dis
