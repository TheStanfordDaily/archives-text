## Education Suffers 
### 
Onk of thf. greatest tragedies of the Little Rock segregation
fight is that it is the schools which must bear the brunt of the
conflict, and that these schools must be closed while the problems
are being worked out.
The students themselves have repeatedly said that they want
to be in school. While some have stated they would resent the
presence of Negroes in their classrooms, the majority have indi
cated they believe that integration in the high schools would
move smoothly if freed from outside influences, l ime has shown
that young people of mixed races can grow up together and bridge
racial gaps. They can learn to live and work together without
thought of race —such has been the case in the North and West,
and could happen in the South if given an opportunity. I hus it
should be; but, as with all traditions, the traditional position of
the Negro in the South is difficult to erase from the minds of
Southerners.
The current problem involves political, not merely social, con
flict. Would the Negro "take over" the political life of the South
to tin* detriment of the white population? If the tide were sud
denly to turn and the Negro became dominant politically, with
attitudes toward the whites similar to those of the whites toward
the Negroes, the whites' position could become a most trying one.
Hut living together comes with understanding and education, not
only for the whites but also for the Negroes. Each race must learn
to work with the other, not against it; and to do this they must
begin learning early—in the homes and in the schools.
While whites and Negroes alike may wish to keep to their own
social circles, just as within any society there are certain social
groupings, the growth of the South as well as the nation will
depend upon the utmost use of the talents and abilities of all its
citizens. The Negroes have produced great contributors to science,
thought and culture. We cannot and must not relegate a segment
of our population into the background because of skin color,
tradition, or political fears. They not only have the right to
opportunities to express themselves, but national security and
growth of the nation demand that they be permitted to do so.
Meanwhile, Governor Faubus, under political pressure from
the segregationists, closes the high schools of Little Rock, causing
the loss, week after week, of formal scientific and cultural back
ground of ALL students of the area.
When education, politics and social tradition are jumbled
under the guise of one problem, the conflict is recognizably diffi
cult to resolve. We are firm in our belief that integration must be
effected now in the South. We arc in some sympathy with the
Southerners; it is difficult to change one's attitudes overnight.
Hut Little Rock's present stand indicates that these attitudes would
not be touched in the two-and-a-half-year delay of integration
which they have asked. The delay would only prolong the con
flict and make it even more difficult two and a half years hence
to carrv out the Supreme Court's decision. The people of Little
Hock should have begun preparing themselves for integration
when the court first declared segregation unconstitutional, as was
done in other areas of the South where integration is now suc
cessful. They have seen integration coining for years; they are
not ready. Will they he any more ready in another two and a half
years?
It is becoming too late to begin a systematic intellectual proc
ess of learning to live in an integrated Southern society, and it
appears that experience will have to teach the people of Little
Hock that it is possible to live and work side by side with skins
of another color.
Integration of the public schools and other areas of life is vital
to the welfare of the nation, for we must have unity at home in
order to urge unity abroad. Quiet integration is most desirable,
and we earnestly hope that state and federal authorities will find
a calm and sane solution. But if a temporary force of armed
guards is necessary to open Little Hock schools on an integrated
basis, let the action come NOW, before more time has elapsed
and the situation becomes even more difficult.

the loss, week after week, of formal scientific and cultural back
ground of ALL students of the area.
When education, politics and social tradition are jumbled
under the guise of one problem, the conflict is recognizably diffi
cult to resolve. We are firm in our belief that integration must be
effected now in the South. We arc in some sympathy with the
Southerners; it is difficult to change one's attitudes overnight.
Hut Little Rock's present stand indicates that these attitudes would
not be touched in the two-and-a-half-year delay of integration
which they have asked. The delay would only prolong the con
flict and make it even more difficult two and a half years hence
to carrv out the Supreme Court's decision. The people of Little
Hock should have begun preparing themselves for integration
when the court first declared segregation unconstitutional, as was
done in other areas of the South where integration is now suc
cessful. They have seen integration coining for years; they are
not ready. Will they he any more ready in another two and a half
years?
It is becoming too late to begin a systematic intellectual proc
ess of learning to live in an integrated Southern society, and it
appears that experience will have to teach the people of Little
Hock that it is possible to live and work side by side with skins
of another color.
Integration of the public schools and other areas of life is vital
to the welfare of the nation, for we must have unity at home in
order to urge unity abroad. Quiet integration is most desirable,
and we earnestly hope that state and federal authorities will find
a calm and sane solution. But if a temporary force of armed
guards is necessary to open Little Hock schools on an integrated
basis, let the action come NOW, before more time has elapsed
and the situation becomes even more difficult.
Onk of thf. greatest tragedies of the Little Rock segregation
fight is that it is the schools which must bear the brunt of the
conflict, and that these schools must be closed while the problems
are being worked out.
The students themselves have repeatedly said that they want
to be in school. While some have stated they would resent the
presence of Negroes in their classrooms, the majority have indi
cated they believe that integration in the high schools would
move smoothly if freed from outside influences, l ime has shown
that young people of mixed races can grow up together and bridge
racial gaps. They can learn to live and work together without
thought of race —such has been the case in the North and West,
and could happen in the South if given an opportunity. I hus it
should be; but, as with all traditions, the traditional position of
the Negro in the South is difficult to erase from the minds of
Southerners.
The current problem involves political, not merely social, con
flict. Would the Negro "take over" the political life of the South
to tin* detriment of the white population? If the tide were sud
denly to turn and the Negro became dominant politically, with
attitudes toward the whites similar to those of the whites toward
the Negroes, the whites' position could become a most trying one.
Hut living together comes with understanding and education, not
only for the whites but also for the Negroes. Each race must learn
to work with the other, not against it; and to do this they must
begin learning early—in the homes and in the schools.
While whites and Negroes alike may wish to keep to their own
social circles, just as within any society there are certain social
groupings, the growth of the South as well as the nation will
depend upon the utmost use of the talents and abilities of all its
citizens. The Negroes have produced great contributors to science,
thought and culture. We cannot and must not relegate a segment
of our population into the background because of skin color,
tradition, or political fears. They not only have the right to
opportunities to express themselves, but national security and
