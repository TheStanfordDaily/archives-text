# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## Hipsters Seen Next 
### 
Get ready for the "Hip Genera
tion"â€” that's what This Week
writer Joe Hyams says is replac
ing the Beat Generation. Hyams
quotes eomeciian Mort Sahl, who
was one of the original San Fran
cisco Beats: "The Beat
tion thrives on the fact that it is
uncommon. Once they become
common they no longer are Beat.
Success will spoil the Beat Gener
ation because it can't cope with
it."
The Beats have become a cu
riosity for tourists. One of the
authors popularizing the Beat
Generation, Jack Kerouac, has
published three books, and roy
alties are pouring in to him and
others'. Because of the increas
ing popularity of the Beat Gen
eration, its destruction is in
sight, says writer Hyams.
So now we prepare for the hip
ster who is "so aware of things
average people are not aware of
and do not see that you are con
temptuous of them." Who will
come after the Hip Generation?
Who knows? It makes interest
ing reading for those of us who
don't claim to be either "Beat" or
"Hip."

Pete Grothe's article in the
October issue of the Stanford
Review points up a frightening
fact: If anything is repeated
often enough, people will come
to believe it. As Grot he notes,
a- person can even be convinced
that the moon is green. Grothe,
a member of the Class of '53,
now working on his doctorate
in political science, illustrates*
| the position of the worker in
Kast. Germany in regard to
these pressures in his article,
"Words CAN Hurt Us.' '
While certainly not serious as
is the subject of Grothe's article,
there is a local case which we
noted Thursday evening while
waiting for the Democrats to get
through their local campaign
speeches in order to hear Adlai
Stevenson. If the aspiring woman
candidate from the 16th Disstrict
in Oakland continues to tell her
self and others that election day
is Nov. 5 (for those who haven't
checked their calendars lately, it's
Tuesday, Nov. 4) she may believe
it herself and not make it to the
polls. Her colleagues should tell
her; after all. she. at least, should
get to vote for herself.
