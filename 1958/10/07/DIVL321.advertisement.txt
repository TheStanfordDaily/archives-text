THE DAILY NEEDS YOI1
Hi-Fi and
Most
Parties
When we go to a party, in
variably we find that we're
cornered somewhere by quite
a few people asking questions
about the type of high-fidelity
equipment that they should
buy. Somehow, people l>egin to
feel that the high-fidelity busi
ness is like the medical profes
sion where, if you are able to
describe your symptoms to a
doctor at a party, you save a
five-dollar office call.
Well, this is very flattering,
and when we are hard pressed
we will admit that we do a
good .job of prescribing the
right equipment to give you
the best music reproduction for
your hard-earned dollar.
But we would much rather
stand around at parties and
talk about how the world won't
last another ten years at this
rate.
And it doesn't cost anything
to come into our store and talk
to us while we have the full
demonstration facilities to help
you decide on what to buy. For
one thing, we have a complete
switchboard so that you can
hear instantaneous compari
sons between amplifiers and
speakers. For example, we
have the full line of University
speakers and nearly every na
tionally advertised hi-fi prod
uct on display.
Finally, there's never much
of a sales pitch. We'll help you
and advise you, but we want
you to relax and take your
time. We're open every night
until nine, and we'll be glad to
| see you.
