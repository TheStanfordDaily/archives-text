# Krutch Criticizes School and Church
## 
### Diana Smith 
The present day school and church have largely abandoned their
traditional function of directing society, and now seem content mere
ly to follow it, Joseph Wood Krutch asserted last evening in the
opening West Memorial Lecture, "The Average and the Normal."
"They talk more and more about 'adjustment' and mean by that

'adjustment to things as they
are. . . .' If the normal is only
the average; the good life what
the majority thinks (or has been
persuaded to think) that it is; if
what men should do is what they
do do, then the desirable is what
is most widely desired . . . he
declared.
Krutch observed that before
the average became synonymous
with the normal, the average was
something to be risen above, not
to cling to. That which gets the
most votes is not the only pos
sible standard of values, he sug
gested.
Krutch emphasized the present
urgency of this question in a con
temporary society "in which the
pressures and persuasions calcu
lated lo win consent are stronger,
better co-ordinated and more con
sciously manipulated than they
ever were before."
Educators he charged with
preoccupation with establishing
norms based upon the present,
that is, desirable, condition of
man. If education is a prepara
lion for life, and if life means the
kind of life now led by the aver
age man, then "the aims of the
educator and the advertising man
are nearly identical," he affirmed.
Facing the question, "If the
normal is not the average then
what is it?" Krutch pointed out
that former normatives, the will
of God, right reason and human
nature, have been generally dis
credited. He dedicated his second
lecture to an examination of one
possible "normal" which might
he a standard by which the usual
may be judged, a fulfillment rath
er than a statement.
"If resistance is still possible,
it is more than usually difficult,
and it demands to an unusual de
gree the individual's faith in the
reality and importance of his own
individuality." We must refuse to
be convinced that our sincerely
held convictions are merely preju
dices that the enlightened must
reject, Krutch asserted.

what men should do is what they
do do, then the desirable is what
is most widely desired . . . he
declared.
Krutch observed that before
the average became synonymous
with the normal, the average was
something to be risen above, not
to cling to. That which gets the
most votes is not the only pos
sible standard of values, he sug
gested.
Krutch emphasized the present
urgency of this question in a con
temporary society "in which the
pressures and persuasions calcu
lated lo win consent are stronger,
better co-ordinated and more con
sciously manipulated than they
ever were before."
Educators he charged with
preoccupation with establishing
norms based upon the present,
that is, desirable, condition of
man. If education is a prepara
lion for life, and if life means the
kind of life now led by the aver
age man, then "the aims of the
educator and the advertising man
are nearly identical," he affirmed.
Facing the question, "If the
normal is not the average then
what is it?" Krutch pointed out
that former normatives, the will
of God, right reason and human
nature, have been generally dis
credited. He dedicated his second
lecture to an examination of one
possible "normal" which might
he a standard by which the usual
may be judged, a fulfillment rath
er than a statement.
"If resistance is still possible,
it is more than usually difficult,
and it demands to an unusual de
gree the individual's faith in the
reality and importance of his own
individuality." We must refuse to
be convinced that our sincerely
held convictions are merely preju
dices that the enlightened must
reject, Krutch asserted.


JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH DELIVERS MEMORIAL LECTURE
Large, Enthusiastic Crowd Attends Speech
The present day school and church have largely abandoned their
traditional function of directing society, and now seem content mere
ly to follow it, Joseph Wood Krutch asserted last evening in the
opening West Memorial Lecture, "The Average and the Normal."
"They talk more and more about 'adjustment' and mean by that

'adjustment to things as they
are. . . .' If the normal is only
the average; the good life what
the majority thinks (or has been
persuaded to think) that it is; if
what men should do is what they
do do, then the desirable is what
is most widely desired . . . he
declared.
