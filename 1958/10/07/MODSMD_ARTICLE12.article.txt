# Boiler Plant Furnishes Steam Heat for Campus
## 
### 
Relatively unheard-of construction, the new $1,400,000 steam heat
ing system and the Stanford Research Institute's $2,225,000 first per
manent building, forms an important part of the future growth of
the Stanford campus and its environs.
Nearing completion is a $900,000 boiler plant, the nucleus of a new

and improved sleam heating sys
tem for Ihe campus.
The four-boiler plant will de
liver 160,000 pounds of steam
pressure an hour to (he new Stan
ford Medical Center and the Palo
Alto - Stanford Hospital through
about 6500 feet of existing trunk
line. The steam pipes will be
routed so as to improve service
to existing campus buildings, in
addition to the medical center
and the hospital.
BUILT THIS SUMMER
The tan-stone building which
houses the boilers and controls is
located near the west end of
Serra Street, and was built
around the installed boilers dur
ing the summer.
The first permanent building of
t lie Stanford Research Institute
is the first of the series of build
ings which will ultimately replace
the temporary army hospital
units which the SRI has called
home since its founding in 1946.
30-ACRE SITE
Located on a 30-acre site in
Menlo Park, the 563 • foot - long
two-story building is composed of
five 144 - foot - long wings, sepa
rated by breezeways and by large
interior courtyards. Occupancy of
the new structure took place late
last month when approximately
one-third of the Institute's 1330
locally - based employees moved
into the 110,000-square-foot build
ing.
Eventual expansion plans call
for additional construction to
house t he remaining two-thirds of
the staff still quartered in the
temporary buildings. When com
pleted, SRl's research facilities
will contain about 750,000 square
feet, and will be valued some
where between $14 and $20 mil
lion.

Alto - Stanford Hospital through
about 6500 feet of existing trunk
line. The steam pipes will be
routed so as to improve service
to existing campus buildings, in
addition to the medical center
and the hospital.
BUILT THIS SUMMER
The tan-stone building which
houses the boilers and controls is
located near the west end of
Serra Street, and was built
around the installed boilers dur
ing the summer.
The first permanent building of
t lie Stanford Research Institute
is the first of the series of build
ings which will ultimately replace
the temporary army hospital
units which the SRI has called
home since its founding in 1946.
30-ACRE SITE
Located on a 30-acre site in
Menlo Park, the 563 • foot - long
two-story building is composed of
five 144 - foot - long wings, sepa
rated by breezeways and by large
interior courtyards. Occupancy of
the new structure took place late
last month when approximately
one-third of the Institute's 1330
locally - based employees moved
into the 110,000-square-foot build
ing.
Eventual expansion plans call
for additional construction to
house t he remaining two-thirds of
the staff still quartered in the
temporary buildings. When com
pleted, SRl's research facilities
will contain about 750,000 square
feet, and will be valued some
where between $14 and $20 mil
lion.

NEYV HEATING PLANT COST IS $1,400,000
Steam System to Serve New Stanford Med Center
Relatively unheard-of construction, the new $1,400,000 steam heat
ing system and the Stanford Research Institute's $2,225,000 first per
manent building, forms an important part of the future growth of
the Stanford campus and its environs.
Nearing completion is a $900,000 boiler plant, the nucleus of a new

and improved sleam heating sys
tem for Ihe campus.
The four-boiler plant will de
liver 160,000 pounds of steam
pressure an hour to (he new Stan
ford Medical Center and the Palo
Alto - Stanford Hospital through
about 6500 feet of existing trunk
line. The steam pipes will be
