# SAE's Make 'Hell Week' 'Help Week'
## 
### 
Fraternity "Hell Week" at Stan
ford, severely and often criticized
by University officials, is this
week being dealt a blow by the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon actives and
pledges.
The traditional week of much
hazing and little sleep is being re
placed by a community "Help
Week" wherein the 20 SAE
pledges are assigned constructive
and useful jobs. This year, they
are working in Palo Alto with the
local YMCA, Sea Scouts and City
Engineer.
"The SAE's plan is construc
tive and the house is to he com
mended," stated Dean of Men
William Craig. He continued,
"This program can make a real
contribution to the community
and to the fraternity members.
"You lose a week of studying
during Ilell Week and you lose
another' week just to catch up on
your sleep," said Bob Sangster,
chapter secretary.
Sangster believes that most of
the other fraternities on campus
will follow suit if not this year
then next, or the year after.
Dean Craig provided an appro
priate ending to this story of the
revolution in fraternity initiation
practices by e on c 1 u ding that
"These are all steps in the right
direction."
