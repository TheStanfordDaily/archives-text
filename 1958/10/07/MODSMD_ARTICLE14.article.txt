# No KZSU--Yet

Stanford radio station KZSU
will not resume broadcasting for
an undetermined length of time.
At a meeting attended by staff
members, personnel and adminis
trators, plans for a planning and
research program were outlined
by George Bealy, acting director.
A class, Radio Station Opera
tion," is now open to interested
students. It will carry two units
of credit and will meet once a
week. This group will investi
gate radio operations and prob
lems on other campuses as well
as probing the local situation and
seeking solutions for the prob
lem.
In addition, a planning commit
tee of five members was chosen
to act in official capacity and rep
resent KZSU in dealings with the
administration. Phil Figler, chief
engineer; John Hayes, business
manager; Liill De Armond, ala

tion manager; Mike Chambreau
rind Mike McCaskey 'comprise
this intermediary group.
The technical problem which
attracted the attention of the
Federal Communicaions Commis
sion too high transmitting pow
er which caused radiation could
he resolved by a cut-back in pow
er. However, adjustments con
cerning personnel, organization
and administration must be made
before the station will be able to
resume transmitting.
Dean Philip Rhinelander ex
pressed hope that the group
would be able to plan a set-up
that would "stand the stress and
strain" of the various problems it
must cope with. He approved of
the committee's goals and stated
that the administration would
"look to the committee for their
recommendations."
