UNIVERSITY campuses should, ideally, stimulate thought to sucli
a decree thai every issue, large or small, have two sides.
According to formal debate procedure, for every resolution
there is an affirmative and a negative argument, each with its own
merits. According to current American tradition, knowledge of
the facts in any dispute, he it campus housing or U.S. policy on
Formosa, is incidental lor should one say ""accidental t) ami
rather pedantic. The one qualification for discussing anything,
from Stanford's chances at the Hose Howl to the present relation
ship between Red China and the Soviet Union, is that one have
"an opinion."
Few take the pains to study the origin of their cherished
opinions, whether these convictions he 10 years or 10 minutes old.
When disagreed with, resentment is quickly aroused, and one seeks
every manner of excuse to cling to his expressed opinion. I( dis
cussion continues, any reasoning all too olten consists of finding
arguments for going on believing as one already does.
Criticism of the other fellow's viewpoint is simple—a standard
procedure. Faults are more obvious, it seems, than virtues. Lack
ing real understanding of the question, which may never have
concerned either person before—suggestions for positive and con
structive action are woefully nonexistent.
The result is a step imperceptivelv, but irrevocably, backward
in intellectual progress. Criticism is rendered valueless—useless
unless followed up by suggestions of a more acceptable policy for
nil conccrned. Criticism by itsell is stalemate: dissatisfying and
discouraging. Constructive criticism is hope, action, under
standing.
Individually, suggestions for a better Stanford or a better
world won't immediately solve the problems of either—that is not
expected. Eventually, however, universities and nations won't find
themselves stvmied by trying to please everyone and thereby fail
ing to please anyone. Agreements may be reached only by con
cessions 011 both sides, and action may he taken down the road
of diplomatic compromise.
Constructive criticism is an altitude that would do well to
replace blind negativism. A way of life deserves that much, at
least.
