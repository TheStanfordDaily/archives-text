# PRESIDENT'S REPORT
## Projects Progress 
### John Bohn ASSU President 
This Thursday at 7:15 p.m. the
first meeting of the ASSU Legis
lature for 1958-1959 will convene
at Bowman Alumni House. Since
this will be our first meeting, the
Legislature itself has not yet had
an opportunity to examine with
care those problems with which it
will shortly be concerned. Some
preliminary work has been done,
however, in an attempt to delin
eate those areas of general in
terest to the student body. I
sfiould like here to present a sum
mary of our progress to date.
i As you have already learned,
the plans for the new Bookstore
have received final approval of
the Bookstore board and the new
Bookstore should be far enough
along by next fall quarter to per
mit student use. It will have an
area of about four times that of
our present one and from the
sketches I have seen there seems
to be a great improvement in ef
ficiency as well.
LIBRARY STUDY
Last quarter a committee was
appointed, consisting of Joy Nel
son, Jeff Commons, Ann Coolev
and Stew Toy, to study ways in
which the students might help
the cause of obtaining and im
proving a new undergraduate li
brary. To date they have not re
ported to me what progress they
have made, though they have
been working on the project. Per
haps they could take the lead in
preparing a report to be submit
ted to the University which would
embody the students' views on
what such a library should con
lain in regard to facilities, its gen
eral layout and so forth. I hope
you who are interested in the
project will contact these people
witir your suggestions and com
ments. More about this later.
Up for discussion in the next

few weeks will be the proposed
changes in the athletic awards
system and, as a matter of fact,
almost the whole sport system as
well. Each of the members of the
Legislature will be provided with
a copy of the proposed system on
Thursday, and I urge yo\i all to
contact these people for any in
formation you would like. Prob
ably the first discussion of the
proposal will not take place until
next week. This should give
those of you who are interested
I an opportunity to look it over and
make suggestions.
APPOINTMENTS DUE
There are a number of appoint
ments which still remain to be
made. Particularly important are
two positions on the Union Plan
ning Board, which, in the next
few months, will play an impor
! tant role in the fate of our Union
| plans. Perhaps even more impor
tant, there still remains unfilled
the position of Election Chair
man. His job is perhaps the sin
gle most important one as far as
co-ordination and stimulation of
student interest in government
are concerned. In the past this
job has been performed with
varying degrees of success. There
is. however, a significant need fqr
increased efficiency and pre-plan
ning. Those of you who are in
terested please drop by the AS
SU oft'icc or call and leave word.
Important needs also exist for
student representation on the
Public Exercises subcommittee on
the Tuesday Evening Series and
on the Film Series. Here is a
chance for students to have a
voice in what topics and which
guest speakers they would like to
have.
Let me here extend an invita
tion to all of you who may be in
terested to come over and attend
all of our Legislature meelings.
We all hope you will feel free to
offer us your suggestions.

will shortly be concerned. Some
preliminary work has been done,
however, in an attempt to delin
eate those areas of general in
terest to the student body. I
sfiould like here to present a sum
mary of our progress to date.
i As you have already learned,
the plans for the new Bookstore
have received final approval of
the Bookstore board and the new
Bookstore should be far enough
along by next fall quarter to per
mit student use. It will have an
area of about four times that of
our present one and from the
sketches I have seen there seems
to be a great improvement in ef
ficiency as well.
LIBRARY STUDY
Last quarter a committee was
appointed, consisting of Joy Nel
son, Jeff Commons, Ann Coolev
and Stew Toy, to study ways in
which the students might help
the cause of obtaining and im
proving a new undergraduate li
brary. To date they have not re
ported to me what progress they
have made, though they have
been working on the project. Per
haps they could take the lead in
preparing a report to be submit
ted to the University which would
embody the students' views on
what such a library should con
lain in regard to facilities, its gen
eral layout and so forth. I hope
you who are interested in the
project will contact these people
witir your suggestions and com
ments. More about this later.
Up for discussion in the next

few weeks will be the proposed
changes in the athletic awards
system and, as a matter of fact,
almost the whole sport system as
well. Each of the members of the
Legislature will be provided with
a copy of the proposed system on
Thursday, and I urge yo\i all to
contact these people for any in
formation you would like. Prob
ably the first discussion of the
proposal will not take place until
next week. This should give
those of you who are interested
I an opportunity to look it over and
make suggestions.
APPOINTMENTS DUE
There are a number of appoint
ments which still remain to be
made. Particularly important are
two positions on the Union Plan
ning Board, which, in the next
few months, will play an impor
! tant role in the fate of our Union
| plans. Perhaps even more impor
tant, there still remains unfilled
the position of Election Chair
man. His job is perhaps the sin
gle most important one as far as
co-ordination and stimulation of
student interest in government
are concerned. In the past this
job has been performed with
varying degrees of success. There
is. however, a significant need fqr
increased efficiency and pre-plan
ning. Those of you who are in
terested please drop by the AS
SU oft'icc or call and leave word.
Important needs also exist for
student representation on the
Public Exercises subcommittee on
the Tuesday Evening Series and
on the Film Series. Here is a
chance for students to have a
voice in what topics and which
guest speakers they would like to
have.
Let me here extend an invita
tion to all of you who may be in
terested to come over and attend
all of our Legislature meelings.
We all hope you will feel free to
offer us your suggestions.
This Thursday at 7:15 p.m. the
first meeting of the ASSU Legis
lature for 1958-1959 will convene
