# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
From Dim to Dark
A week ago, this column took note of the surprising showings
being made this season by football teams which will be meeting
Stanford later in the fall. If this look was a bit dim a week ago, it's
downright daik black now after looking at what happened Saturday.
First there's Washington, the outfit which will invade Stanford
Stadium on Saturday for a joust with the locals.
As a blanket statement which can cover any of the past four sea
sons and presumably the present one also, any team which loses to
Ohio State by only five points must be pretty good. And that's just
what Washington was Saturday when the Buckeyes were lucky to
get away with a 12-7 victory before the home folks in Columbus.
Hutch Fehring scouted the Huskies for Stanford, then met the
Indians in Chicago and flew home with them. His report was that
Washington unveiled a six-formation offensive attack and a defen
sive that held the Buckeyes to less than 200 yards net.
At that, it took a pass interception and blocked kick to set up
the two touchdowns that downed Washington.
Washington's switch to unbalanced lines and flankers to either
side is something new for .Jim Owens 1 ' team. Even in their opener
against San Jose State, the Huskies stuck to the straight-T they had
used in 1957.
Hut the new plays must have worked well for the apparently
underrated Huskies, who amassed nearly 300 yards against a line
that ranks among the toughest in the Itig Ten.
Then there's the Air Force. Their trained falcon may have es
caped during a halftime demonstration, hut the flyboys didn't let
anything else get away as they held heavily-favored lowa to a 13-13
tie.
Considering that the Hawkeyes only a week ago routed TCU, the
nation's 1 hen-fifth-ranked team, 17-0, it begins to look like bad trouble
for Stanford come a week from Saturday.
So What Does Jack Do?
So what can Jack Curtice do to get his troops into the win column
before the year runs out?
Curtice figures the answer lies in getting the offense inlo gear,
even if it means simplifying it to the bone. He said he's going to get
the four backs who move the ball best onto the first unit and just
not worry about defense.
His theory, basically, is that if you've got the ball, then you don't
need to worry about defense. But if your offense is no good, then
you won't have the ball and you will have to worry about defense.
So—develop an offense and keep the ball. Curtice also says that even
with the world's best defense, if the other team has the ball enough
times, it's going to crack through.
Possibly the biggest of the Stanford offensive problems has been
play selection. With three quarterbacks who are all short on game
experience, it's not too surprising that this should be the case. Not
that it's anyone's fault—it's just the way things are.
Curtice figures the best way to straighten up the signal calling
is to cut down on the number of plays. And that's just what is going
to happen this week. He's threatened to cut down to as little as five
basic plays—but there'll probably be just a few more left in the Indian
portfolio.
One thing we'll hope is that any new systems of play-calling
result in Gil Dowd's being used more often. Dowd has been good for
three or four yards nearly every time he carries—his average is 4.3—
but he isn't used nearly as often as was fullback Chuck Shea a year
ago.
The quick pitch-outs also work reasonably well—when they're
done fast enough to get the ball carrier around end before the In
dians' lack of speed catches up with them.
But what seems to happen? First down, and Dowd goes for four
or five, or the quick pitch gains the same thing. Then comes second
down, and some of the slower wide stuff that hasn't worked all year
still doesn't work. So, it's third and five or six, and everyone sits
back and waits for the pass.
As was said, no one's terribly at fault; it's just a problem of inex
perience that may be solved by simplification. Lot's hope this works.

On the lighter side, there was Bob Nicolet's attempted field goal
Saturday—not a normal run-of-the-mill type field goal, but the drop
kick type that went out of style 20 or 30 years ago.
Stanford was in a fourth-and-ten situation on the Northwestern
42 when Nicolet—the only kicker in the game at the time—stepped
back for his effort.
Curtice said later that when he saw the Indians in what seemed
to be a closed instead of open punt formation, he almost fell off the
end of the bench. "My, tlvc boys ARE getting confused," was what
ran through his mind.
Unfortunately, Nicolet's kick was off the side of his foot and
didn't come close to getting three points on the scoreboard. But lo
and behold it did roll out on the one-yard line as could have been
done by only the most perfect of punts.
"We work on perfecting a punt that'll hit and roll out," laughed
Curtice, "and then that drop-kick does* the job."
Thinking back to last year, though, it doesn't seem so unlikely
that Nic would make the drop-kick effort. When the Indians were in
ihe throes of their P.A.T. problems (at least they were coming close
enough to have P.A(.T. problems) Nic used to work for 15 or 20 min
utes a day on drop-kicks from all over the field. Saturday's was his
first chance to use one in actual play.

Looking back again to similar circumstances in all three of the
year's losses, Bob Peterson may be right when he observes that
Uiings would be a lot better for the Tribe if it would get one early
good break.
The opening breaks have all been bad so far—a kickoff fumble
against WSC, a 57-yard run in the Rice game that should have gone
for five, and a penalty in the Wildcat game that stopped a close-in
drive before it ever began.
If a nice break of this nature would come along on the Stanford
side of the ledger and give the Cards an early lead, Ihe reaction
might be just good enough to gel the hall rolling for a good healthy
victory.
