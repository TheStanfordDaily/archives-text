# Cards Start Drills for Husky Tilt
## 
### 
Out of the frying pan and into
the lire. That is beginning to look
like the week-to-week story of the
1958 football season for Stanford.
This Saturday the haven't-come
close-yet Indians host one of the
real surprises of the Pacific Coast
Conferenceâ€”Jim Owens'. Univer
sity of Washington Huskies.
Washington, like several other
teams on the Tribe schedule, look
ed like a victory three weeks ago
. . . before the season started. But
the developments in the mean
time have caused the picture to be
reversed. A green Stanford team
turned out to be "further away"
than expected, and the Huskies
are looking like anything but a
repeat of last year's overrated
eleven, as shown by their 12-7 loss
to Ohio State last week.
The Cards, able to keep fairly
free of the game injury jinx in
their first two games, got a double
blow Saturday against Northwest
ern. Junior guard Larry Lacey
and halfback Dick Bowers will be
out for at least one week.
Preliminary reports said that
Lacey, rapidly-improving transfer
from Stockton College, would
have to undergo surgery for his
knee and be out for the season.
However, further examination re
vealed that the injury was not as
bad as suspected, and he will be
back in action for the last half of
the season.
Bowers' injury, torn knee liga
ments, is the more serious of the
two.
Joel Freis, two-year veteran end
who has been out all season with
a muscle split, donned the pads
yesterday and may be ready Sat
urday.
Speed and depth, biggest weak
spots in the Stanford story so far
this season, are commodities the
Huskies are showing in abun
dance. The improved depth is
most evident in their lightning
fast back field, where the Cards
will have to cope with the dashes
of such speedsters as Mike Me-
Cluskey, Luther Carr, Sam Hur
wort h. Carver Gayton, George
Fleming and Don M c K e t a,


SAM HURWORTH
Washington Fullback
