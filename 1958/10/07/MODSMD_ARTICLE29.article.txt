# Turley Shuts Out Braves
## 
### 
NEW YORK (/P) — New York's aroused Yankees shattered Lew
Burdette's spell Monday and kept alive in the World Series on Bob
Turley's five-hit, 7-0 shutout of the Milwaukee Braves. It was the
Yanks' second victory—both by shutouts—in the first five games.
Turley, the sturdy, 21-game winner who was routed in the seven-

run first inning of the second
game, had the Braves in hand all
the way. Firing a sizzling fast
ball and a back-breaking curve
with his no-windup action, he
struck out 10 Milwaukee batters.
McDoug-ald Homers
The Yanks nudged Burdette,
their four-time conqueror, for the
first hit and run in the third in
ning—a home run against the left
field foul screen by Gil McDou
gald.
They really caught up with
their tormentor in the sixth when
they rattled him loose during a
six-run explosion. The charm and
skill that had carried him to four
straight over the Yanks deserted
him as New York's long slumber
ing bats finally came alive.
This third straight shutout
game in Yankee Stadium sent the
clubs back to Milwaukee with the
Braves leading, 3-2.
Pitchers Uncertain
Neither manager was definite
about his pitcher for Wednesday's
game. Casey Stengel hinted it
might be Ryne Duren, his right
handed relief ace. Fred Haney,
boss of the Braves, was expected
to pick Bob Rush, another right
hander.
"I probably won't know for sure
until Wednesday," said Stengel.
"I want to see how Larsen |Don|
works out. He don't feel too good.
I've got Art Ditmar and Duren
I Ryne | ready, and possibly Kucks
j Johnny |."
