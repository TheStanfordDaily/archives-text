# Program Enables Students To Do Mental Health Work
## 
### 
A new extra-curricular activity,
the Mental Health Field Work
program, will organize students
who will spend two to three
hours every other week doing
recreation work with patients at
Agnew State Mental Hospital, lo
cated a short distance from cam
pus.
The activity's organizer, Judy
Vollmar, feels that the primary
appeal is to the student who is

interested in people. He must be
u friend to people who literally
have no friends.
Students who participate in the
program will be asked to spend a
minimum of two hours every oth
er week on convenient afternoons
or on Wednesday evenings at the
hospital. They will help with
simple crafts, folk dance with the
patients, talk to them as a friend
representing the world outside,
sing with them, and enter into
simple dramatic projects and
games.
No previous skill or experience
in any of these areas or in psy
chology is necessary.
A second and more intensive
program, similar to this one, is
being considered also. This proj
ect is designed to appeal to stu
dents contemplating occupations
concerned with mental health
clinical psychology, counseling,
psychiatry or psychiatric nurs
ing, occupational or recreational
therapy and social work.
The project will be presented
more fully in some social science
courses next week. Students who
are interested in further infor
mation now may get in contact
with Judy Vollmar, DA 6-1520,
Ext. 67.
