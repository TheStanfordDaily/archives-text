## Conflicting Integration Views Told

(Editor's Nolo: This is the
second in a series on the prob
lem of integration in (lie South
ern schools.)

Segregationist opinion centers
in the idea that the Negro is, by
virtue of his race, inferior to the
white man. It takes these major
forms:
The South must keep intact its
old traditions of the separation of
the black and white races. This
is often tempered by the "sepa
rate but equal" attitude toward
the Negro which is incorporated
in the present Southern school
system.
ECONOMIC INFERIORITY
The Negro, if allowed to rise
out. of his position of social and
economic inferiority (Negroes
are employed in large percentage
in the South in positions of low
social prestige), will usurp the
positions occupied now by the
whites in business, politics and
the professions. In many of the
Southern statess, such as Missis
sippi, the large population major
ity of Negroes over whites is of
fered as proof of this eventuality.
The Negro does not keep his
communities in decent repair, and
is himself a dirty person. The ar
gument that property values will
sink as a result of this if Negroes
move into a white community is
also used.
"What would you think if your
sister went out with a Negro?" is
often used as an argument
against any social mingling. Many
segregationists have a fear of in
termarriage.
SEGREGATION ATTITUDE
An attitude of many segrega
tionists is that "the worst white
man is better than the best Ne
gro." The Darwinists among the
segregationists often use the the
ory of evolution to prove that the
N'egro is closer to the ape than
is the white.
The case for integration of the
Negro into the white community
is often made even by those who
are personally prejudiced. Some
arguments in favor of integration
are:
The Constitution says that all
men are equal before the law, and
that they should have equal op
portunity for personal achieve
ment. There is no mention in it
of "separate but equal."
INTELLIGENCE
There is no difference in intelli
gence between the Negro and the
white. The Negro is less educat
ed, and fewer rise to positions of
prestige only because of inferior
schools and status to which the
race is subjected.
Prejudice is an unnatural atti
tude, and can be done away with
as soon as the first or second gen
eration of children educated in in
tegrated schools has grown up
and become parents.
The segregationist has no need
to worry about intermarriage on
any great scale for a long while,
as the black and white races will
generally keep to themselves so
cially by preference.
