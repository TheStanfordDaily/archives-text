# Pope Pius XII Suffers Stroke; Condition Continues Critical
## Pontiff Reportedly Receives Final Rites of Roman Church 
### 
CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (/P) —Pope Pius XII suffered a stroke
Monday, lapsed into a coma, then rallied and was "appreciably im
proved" by nightfall.
An evening medical bulletin said the 82-year-old leader of the
Roman Catholic Church once more had shown the remarkable stam-

ina that brought him through a
grave illness four years ago.
There were reports the Pope
had received extreme unction, the
last rites of the Roman Catholic
Church. These came from the
Vatican Press Office which later
said, however, that it could not
confirm the report.
Normally such rites would be
administered as a matter of
course to a Catholic in danger of
death.
The first heartening news came
shortly after noon from Monsi
gnor Angelo dell'Acqua, Vatican
substitute secretary of state. He
said the Pope had shown a slight
improvement at noon. He added,
however, that it "would be ab
surd to say anything more ex
plicit. The Pope's condition natu
rally continues to be grave."
OTHER REPORTS
Other reports at about noon
said the pontiff had roused brief
ly from the coma, opened his eyes
and murmured a few words.
These reports, which could not
be officially confirmed, said the
Pope had asked that he be re
turned to Vatican City as soon as
possible.
Early Monday morning, al
though weary and troubled by
gastritis and attendant hiccups
that had taken a toll of his ener
gies, he was able to say mass at
his little private chapel and to re
ceive Holy Communion. He had
been suffering for several days
from gastritis, the stomach ail
ment that brought him to the
verge of death in 1954.
MEDICAL BULLETIN
Then, just as he was to begin
his daily work, he was struck
down. The morning medical bul
letin said the attack, described as
"cerebral circulatory disturb
ances," had come at 8:30 a.m.
For the first time since the
Pope came to this town 18 miles
southeast of Rome this summer,
there was only silence in the
square below his summer resi
dence.
Police were stationed at all en
trances to the square. They re
layed word of the pontiff's illness
to all tourists, who traditionally
come to the square to cheer the
Pope.
Specialists urgently summoned
to the pontiff's bedside, in addi
tion to his private physician, Ga
leazzi-Lisi, were Gasbarrini, Prof.
Ferdinando Frugoni, a heart spe
cialist, and Dr. Ferdinando Co
relli, specialist in internal disor
ders.
Gasbarrini told waiting report
ers: "All is in the hands of God."
Vatican Radio broadcast a plea

itual ruler of the world's Roman
Catholics for 18 years.
CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (/P) —Pope Pius XII suffered a stroke
Monday, lapsed into a coma, then rallied and was "appreciably im
proved" by nightfall.
An evening medical bulletin said the 82-year-old leader of the
Roman Catholic Church once more had shown the remarkable stam-

ina that brought him through a
grave illness four years ago.
There were reports the Pope
had received extreme unction, the
last rites of the Roman Catholic
Church. These came from the
Vatican Press Office which later
said, however, that it could not
confirm the report.
Normally such rites would be
administered as a matter of
course to a Catholic in danger of
death.
The first heartening news came
shortly after noon from Monsi
gnor Angelo dell'Acqua, Vatican
substitute secretary of state. He
said the Pope had shown a slight
improvement at noon. He added,
however, that it "would be ab
surd to say anything more ex
plicit. The Pope's condition natu
rally continues to be grave."
OTHER REPORTS
Other reports at about noon
said the pontiff had roused brief
ly from the coma, opened his eyes
and murmured a few words.
These reports, which could not
be officially confirmed, said the
Pope had asked that he be re
turned to Vatican City as soon as
possible.
Early Monday morning, al
though weary and troubled by
gastritis and attendant hiccups
that had taken a toll of his ener
gies, he was able to say mass at
his little private chapel and to re
ceive Holy Communion. He had
been suffering for several days
from gastritis, the stomach ail
ment that brought him to the
verge of death in 1954.
MEDICAL BULLETIN
Then, just as he was to begin
his daily work, he was struck
down. The morning medical bul
letin said the attack, described as
"cerebral circulatory disturb
ances," had come at 8:30 a.m.
For the first time since the
Pope came to this town 18 miles
southeast of Rome this summer,
there was only silence in the
square below his summer resi
dence.
Police were stationed at all en
trances to the square. They re
layed word of the pontiff's illness
to all tourists, who traditionally
come to the square to cheer the
Pope.
Specialists urgently summoned
to the pontiff's bedside, in addi
tion to his private physician, Ga
leazzi-Lisi, were Gasbarrini, Prof.
Ferdinando Frugoni, a heart spe
cialist, and Dr. Ferdinando Co
relli, specialist in internal disor
ders.
Gasbarrini told waiting report
ers: "All is in the hands of God."
Vatican Radio broadcast a plea
throughout the world for prayers
for the Pope, who has been spir
itual ruler of the world's Roman
Catholics for 18 years.
