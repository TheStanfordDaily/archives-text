# Sun Telescope Unveiled to Press
## Radio Propagation Lab Project to Probe Space 
### Jack Clumeck 
A historic unveiling occurred
yesterday, as Prof. Ronald N.
Bracewell of Stanford's Radio
Propagation Laboratory and his
associates showed their new type
of radio telescope to the press in
a meadow west of campus.
As representatives from the As
sociated Press, UPI and local
newspapers looked on and photo
graphe 1, Dr. Bracewell explained
the operation and purpose of his
radio telescope system: study of
the sun's atmosphere. When com
pleted, the telescope will possess
the highest resolving power, or
focal clarity, of any radio tele
scope in the U.S., according to Dr.
Bracewell.

Prof. Braeewell and his asso
ciates have been working on the
Stanford radio telescope project
for about three years. His prin
cipal aides have been Clark H.
Sphar, research associate, Chi
Chrun Lee, research assistant,
and graduate students Roger S.
Colvin of Palo Alio, Kwang-shi
Yang of Formosa, David Kuda
beck of Berkeley, and Swarup.
Stanford's contribution to the
project, according to Prof. Brace
well, was the land (previously a
meadow leased to a dairy), an ac
cess road to the site, a foundation
for the headquarters building,
the quonset - hut headquarters,
and electricity and water.
Sixteen Antennas
Only half built, the device at
present consists of 16 solid alumi
num "dish" antennas intercon
nected mechanically by a drive
shaft assembly, and electronically
through an intricate wiring sys
tem. Each antenna is 10 feet in
diameter and is mounted on its
own concrete pedestal. Placed in
a 375-foot row across a meadow
off Alpine Road near the Ladera
Shopping Center, they are syn
chronized to move in unison, fol
lowing the sun's movements
through the sky.
In four to five months, a match
ing row will be completed and
will bisect the existing 16 anten
nas, making a huge cross of 32
saucer antennas on the ground.
Pedestals are presently in place
and dishes and drive mechanisms
arc awaiting assembly. Then the
telescope will, in effect, provide
the same service as a massive
"steerable" dish antenna 375 feet
in diameter.
$1(10,000 Cost,
The cost of the system, which
is financed by grants from the
Air Force Office of Scientific Re
search, is approximately $400,000.
A movable, saucer-shaped anten
na of such a size would be quite
impractical and expensive to
build, Prof. Braeewell pointed
out. The largest built thus far,
according to Govinda Swarup of
India, a graduate student par
ticipating in the project, is a 250-
foot diameter dish in England
which cost ofer $2'/a million.
The reason for increasing size
of radio telescopes was told by
Braeewell. A radio telescope's
"beam" or resolving power varies
inversely with its size, he ex
plained. Thus, the larger the an
tenna, the smaller its beam and
the sharper its eye.
To Study Chromosphere
The system is designed prima
rily for study of the solar chro
mosphere a billowing layer of

in candescence I hat rises to
heights of 6000 milos above the
sun's surface. A "horn" attached
to a gooseneck wave guide in the
center of each dish is attuned to
3000 - megacycle radiation, corre
sponding to microwaves from this
portion of the sun.
In its diameter, the beam of
Stanford's radio telescope is now
about one-fifteenth of a degree in
one dimension and two and one
half degrees in the other. With
its second row of dishes working,
the beam will be only one-fif
teenth of a degree both dimen
sions.
This will enable it to scan the
sun, much as a TV camera scans
its subject, using a beam area no
bigger than three-thousandths of
one square degree. The results
may be recorded on paper tape,
or a radio photograph of the en
tire solar orb can be completed in
about 30 minutes. Clouds will not
affect antenna efficiency.

Stanford's contribution to the
project, according to Prof. Brace
well, was the land (previously a
meadow leased to a dairy), an ac
cess road to the site, a foundation
for the headquarters building,
the quonset - hut headquarters,
and electricity and water.
Sixteen Antennas
Only half built, the device at
present consists of 16 solid alumi
num "dish" antennas intercon
nected mechanically by a drive
shaft assembly, and electronically
through an intricate wiring sys
tem. Each antenna is 10 feet in
diameter and is mounted on its
own concrete pedestal. Placed in
a 375-foot row across a meadow
off Alpine Road near the Ladera
Shopping Center, they are syn
chronized to move in unison, fol
lowing the sun's movements
through the sky.
In four to five months, a match
ing row will be completed and
will bisect the existing 16 anten
nas, making a huge cross of 32
saucer antennas on the ground.
Pedestals are presently in place
and dishes and drive mechanisms
arc awaiting assembly. Then the
telescope will, in effect, provide
the same service as a massive
"steerable" dish antenna 375 feet
in diameter.
$1(10,000 Cost,
The cost of the system, which
is financed by grants from the
Air Force Office of Scientific Re
search, is approximately $400,000.
A movable, saucer-shaped anten
na of such a size would be quite
impractical and expensive to
build, Prof. Braeewell pointed
out. The largest built thus far,
according to Govinda Swarup of
India, a graduate student par
ticipating in the project, is a 250-
foot diameter dish in England
which cost ofer $2'/a million.
The reason for increasing size
of radio telescopes was told by
Braeewell. A radio telescope's
"beam" or resolving power varies
inversely with its size, he ex
plained. Thus, the larger the an
tenna, the smaller its beam and
the sharper its eye.
To Study Chromosphere
The system is designed prima
rily for study of the solar chro
mosphere a billowing layer of

in candescence I hat rises to
heights of 6000 milos above the
sun's surface. A "horn" attached
to a gooseneck wave guide in the
center of each dish is attuned to
3000 - megacycle radiation, corre
sponding to microwaves from this
portion of the sun.
In its diameter, the beam of
Stanford's radio telescope is now
about one-fifteenth of a degree in
one dimension and two and one
half degrees in the other. With
its second row of dishes working,
the beam will be only one-fif
teenth of a degree both dimen
sions.
This will enable it to scan the
sun, much as a TV camera scans
its subject, using a beam area no
bigger than three-thousandths of
one square degree. The results
may be recorded on paper tape,
or a radio photograph of the en
tire solar orb can be completed in
about 30 minutes. Clouds will not
affect antenna efficiency.

arc awaiting assembly. Then the
telescope will, in effect, provide
the same service as a massive
"steerable" dish antenna 375 feet
in diameter.
$1(10,000 Cost,
The cost of the system, which
is financed by grants from the
Air Force Office of Scientific Re
search, is approximately $400,000.
A movable, saucer-shaped anten
na of such a size would be quite
impractical and expensive to
build, Prof. Braeewell pointed
out. The largest built thus far,
according to Govinda Swarup of
India, a graduate student par
ticipating in the project, is a 250-
foot diameter dish in England
which cost ofer $2'/a million.
The reason for increasing size
of radio telescopes was told by
Braeewell. A radio telescope's
"beam" or resolving power varies
inversely with its size, he ex
plained. Thus, the larger the an
tenna, the smaller its beam and
the sharper its eye.
To Study Chromosphere
The system is designed prima
rily for study of the solar chro
mosphere a billowing layer of

in candescence I hat rises to
heights of 6000 milos above the
sun's surface. A "horn" attached
to a gooseneck wave guide in the
center of each dish is attuned to
3000 - megacycle radiation, corre
sponding to microwaves from this
portion of the sun.
In its diameter, the beam of
Stanford's radio telescope is now
about one-fifteenth of a degree in
one dimension and two and one
half degrees in the other. With
its second row of dishes working,
the beam will be only one-fif
teenth of a degree both dimen
sions.
This will enable it to scan the
sun, much as a TV camera scans
its subject, using a beam area no
bigger than three-thousandths of
one square degree. The results
may be recorded on paper tape,
or a radio photograph of the en
tire solar orb can be completed in
about 30 minutes. Clouds will not
affect antenna efficiency.

A historic unveiling occurred
yesterday, as Prof. Ronald N.
Bracewell of Stanford's Radio
Propagation Laboratory and his
associates showed their new type
of radio telescope to the press in
a meadow west of campus.
As representatives from the As
sociated Press, UPI and local
newspapers looked on and photo
graphe 1, Dr. Bracewell explained
the operation and purpose of his
radio telescope system: study of
the sun's atmosphere. When com
pleted, the telescope will possess
the highest resolving power, or
focal clarity, of any radio tele
scope in the U.S., according to Dr.
Bracewell.

Prof. Braeewell and his asso
ciates have been working on the
Stanford radio telescope project
for about three years. His prin
cipal aides have been Clark H.
Sphar, research associate, Chi
Chrun Lee, research assistant,
and graduate students Roger S.
Colvin of Palo Alio, Kwang-shi
Yang of Formosa, David Kuda
beck of Berkeley, and Swarup.
Stanford's contribution to the
project, according to Prof. Brace
well, was the land (previously a
meadow leased to a dairy), an ac
cess road to the site, a foundation
for the headquarters building,
the quonset - hut headquarters,
and electricity and water.
Sixteen Antennas
Only half built, the device at
present consists of 16 solid alumi
num "dish" antennas intercon
nected mechanically by a drive
shaft assembly, and electronically
through an intricate wiring sys
tem. Each antenna is 10 feet in
diameter and is mounted on its
own concrete pedestal. Placed in
a 375-foot row across a meadow
off Alpine Road near the Ladera
Shopping Center, they are syn
chronized to move in unison, fol
lowing the sun's movements
through the sky.
In four to five months, a match
ing row will be completed and
will bisect the existing 16 anten
nas, making a huge cross of 32
saucer antennas on the ground.
Pedestals are presently in place
and dishes and drive mechanisms
arc awaiting assembly. Then the
telescope will, in effect, provide
the same service as a massive
"steerable" dish antenna 375 feet
in diameter.
