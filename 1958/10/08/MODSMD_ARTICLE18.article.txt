## Get Busy, Joe 
### 
ThEKE IIAVE HEEN a lot of guys named Joe around lately t»'llinj£
iik what a mess tiiis world is in and how we are i11to tin* dogs.
Ourselves, we cannot say much for the whole world, hut we do
know a little about the Stanford campus. And we agree it is in
a mess and is rapidly going to the dogs, cats, bees, flies and any
thing else which happens to like good, unblemished garbage.
Most of the mess we are talking about lies right in I rout ol
The Cellar a monstrous daily collection of paper cups, cigarette
butts, napkins, candy wrappers, newspapers and old test papers.
This old-fashioned, material, paper mess may not he ol much
interest to those philosophic guys named Joe, hut it sure is a
whale of an attraction to those bees.
We are getting sick and tired of sharing our coffee with dozens
of assorted animals that come around for the free eats in the
Stanford handout line. Besides that, I he Cellar is beginning to
look like the collection point for a new peacetime paper drive.
Let's face up to it, these guys named Joe are right- it is a mess.
And the sad part of it is that, unlike the philosophic troubles,
this Cellar mess is just due to negligence. There are plenty of
trash receptacles around the Cellar and Union Court areas, and
all that is needed is to use them.
Stanford spends $28,000-$30,000 a year just in campus clean-up
and maintenance. A good piece of that goes lor picking up after
students who each day carelessly scatter trash around the campus
like tall stories in a political campaign.
The Cellar is not the only place —it is just the most conspicu
ous. The real problem is everywhere, all over Stanford grounds.
And it is an easy problem to spot —it is usually colored white and
it lies at your feet. You can't miss it if you open your eyes.
Mul it's the kind of thing you won't miss when it's gone. And
all it takes to GET HID of the paper lying around is to GET
INTO the habit of using the trash receptacles.
There are three men who do the cleaning up at The Cellar,
and together they spend over 60 hours a week picking up mis
placed trash. This is extra work and expense that could be
eliminated.
So, to all Stanford's casual Tootsie Roll eaters, wherever you
are: it is never very far to the nearest trash can —and there is
no loss of energy or dignity if you make sure that wrapper goes
inside the receptacle. Then maybe we can stop all these \\ I'A
food lines for the neighborhood insects outside I he Cellar.

like tall stories in a political campaign.
The Cellar is not the only place —it is just the most conspicu
ous. The real problem is everywhere, all over Stanford grounds.
And it is an easy problem to spot —it is usually colored white and
it lies at your feet. You can't miss it if you open your eyes.
Mul it's the kind of thing you won't miss when it's gone. And
all it takes to GET HID of the paper lying around is to GET
INTO the habit of using the trash receptacles.
There are three men who do the cleaning up at The Cellar,
and together they spend over 60 hours a week picking up mis
placed trash. This is extra work and expense that could be
eliminated.
So, to all Stanford's casual Tootsie Roll eaters, wherever you
are: it is never very far to the nearest trash can —and there is
no loss of energy or dignity if you make sure that wrapper goes
inside the receptacle. Then maybe we can stop all these \\ I'A
food lines for the neighborhood insects outside I he Cellar.
ThEKE IIAVE HEEN a lot of guys named Joe around lately t»'llinj£
iik what a mess tiiis world is in and how we are i11to tin* dogs.
Ourselves, we cannot say much for the whole world, hut we do
know a little about the Stanford campus. And we agree it is in
a mess and is rapidly going to the dogs, cats, bees, flies and any
thing else which happens to like good, unblemished garbage.
Most of the mess we are talking about lies right in I rout ol
The Cellar a monstrous daily collection of paper cups, cigarette
butts, napkins, candy wrappers, newspapers and old test papers.
This old-fashioned, material, paper mess may not he ol much
interest to those philosophic guys named Joe, hut it sure is a
whale of an attraction to those bees.
We are getting sick and tired of sharing our coffee with dozens
of assorted animals that come around for the free eats in the
Stanford handout line. Besides that, I he Cellar is beginning to
look like the collection point for a new peacetime paper drive.
Let's face up to it, these guys named Joe are right- it is a mess.
And the sad part of it is that, unlike the philosophic troubles,
this Cellar mess is just due to negligence. There are plenty of
trash receptacles around the Cellar and Union Court areas, and
all that is needed is to use them.
Stanford spends $28,000-$30,000 a year just in campus clean-up
and maintenance. A good piece of that goes lor picking up after
students who each day carelessly scatter trash around the campus
like tall stories in a political campaign.
