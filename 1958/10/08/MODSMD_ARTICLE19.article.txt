# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Issues to Play Key Role in State Vote 
### Leo Krulitz 
Elections are won or lost on
issues and California voters have
a large number (his year with
which to measure their candi
dates.
Presumably the biggest issue
is Proposition 18, the Right-to-
VVork measure that would outlaw
the union shop in California. To
Ihe union man, and the employer
this one issue may be enough and
they will vote for the candidate
that agrees with their view; but
to the union man's wife this isn't
enough because chances are that
she and a lot of others like her
can't make up their minds on this
issue.
They probably agree with Sena
tor William Knowland's principle
that each man should have the
l ight to decide if he wants to join
a union or not, but they also feel
it isn't right to have "freeloaders"
working along side their hus
bands.
Their vote on Proposition 18
will be a hurried yes or no and
they will select between Mr.
Knowland and Mr. Brown on
the basis of the stands they
have taken on other issues.
They will quite naturally ask
themselves which of the two men
would make the better adminis
trator. Senator Knowland has
charged that Brown has handled
the Attorney General's office
badly and insinuated that the
Democrat is responsible for Calif
ornia's rising crime rate.
Brown on the other hand has
suggested that Knowland has
been out of the state for 13 years
and has lost contact here. The
Democrats point out also that it
is rumored Knowland will use the
Governor's office as a springboard
to the Presidency and will only
serve two of his four years.
Knowland denies this and says if
elected he will run for re-election
in 1962.
To some thinking voters the
political philosophies of the two
men might make some differ
ence —Knowland's eonservatism
vs. Brown's liberalism. Others
might simply resort to the party
label.
Some people might be con
cerned with Knowland's reference
to his opponent as "Buster
Brown" after making the state
ment that he had never retorted
to name calling or personalities
throughout his 25 years of public

life and wouldn't start now.
On the other hand the fact that
Brown has refused to debate
Knowland might be an issue that
could influence the votes of some
people.
Important, too, as the voters go
to the polls will be the economic
condition of the country and
California.
In any event, several million
dollars will be spent to help the
voter make up his mind.
Stevenson Speech
Most news services that covered
Adlai Stevenson's speech in Oak
land last week failed to report the
most important section, in this
writer's opinion — his final com
ments on the trip he made to Rus
sia this past summer.
The first part of Stevenson's
speech drew the cheers and ap
plause of the enthusiastic audi
ence, but as he started to talk
about Russia the rally sobered
and became suddenly serious, be
cause what the governor was say
ing was serious and vitally impor
tant to the future of the world.
He told them of a new Russia
and a vibrant, determined peo
ple. He tried to dispel the idea
from the minds of his listeners
that there could ever he a re
bellion of the Russian people.
There never will be, he said,
and added, "In the language of
mid-America, 'it just ain't so.' "
Stevenson described the tremen
dous economic growth of the
country, the rapidly growing
cities that spread from Moscow
to Siberia, economic growth for
her own people and the people
friendly to her. He suggested
that it was the field of economic
advancement of the people of the
world that we must concern our
selves with. This is the field
where the Russia challenge is the
greatest, he concluded.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
A lot of interesting things get
said in the heat of a political rally.
From the Democratic rally in
Oakland we give you these gems:
A Little 'OL Lady Candidate:
'"I'm tackling the lions den when
I tackle the East Bay Utility
District." Same lady, "Now. if you
pay your water bill to the East
Ray Mud, you get to vote for the
East Bay Mud Director."
And then there was the candi
date that would like to recall the
old adverb oh, pardon me, pro
verb.

can't make up their minds on this
issue.
They probably agree with Sena
tor William Knowland's principle
that each man should have the
l ight to decide if he wants to join
a union or not, but they also feel
it isn't right to have "freeloaders"
working along side their hus
bands.
Their vote on Proposition 18
will be a hurried yes or no and
they will select between Mr.
Knowland and Mr. Brown on
the basis of the stands they
have taken on other issues.
They will quite naturally ask
themselves which of the two men
would make the better adminis
trator. Senator Knowland has
charged that Brown has handled
the Attorney General's office
badly and insinuated that the
Democrat is responsible for Calif
ornia's rising crime rate.
Brown on the other hand has
suggested that Knowland has
been out of the state for 13 years
and has lost contact here. The
Democrats point out also that it
is rumored Knowland will use the
Governor's office as a springboard
to the Presidency and will only
serve two of his four years.
Knowland denies this and says if
elected he will run for re-election
in 1962.
To some thinking voters the
political philosophies of the two
men might make some differ
ence —Knowland's eonservatism
vs. Brown's liberalism. Others
might simply resort to the party
label.
Some people might be con
cerned with Knowland's reference
to his opponent as "Buster
Brown" after making the state
ment that he had never retorted
to name calling or personalities
throughout his 25 years of public

life and wouldn't start now.
On the other hand the fact that
Brown has refused to debate
Knowland might be an issue that
could influence the votes of some
people.
Important, too, as the voters go
to the polls will be the economic
condition of the country and
California.
In any event, several million
dollars will be spent to help the
voter make up his mind.
Stevenson Speech
Most news services that covered
Adlai Stevenson's speech in Oak
land last week failed to report the
most important section, in this
writer's opinion — his final com
ments on the trip he made to Rus
sia this past summer.
The first part of Stevenson's
speech drew the cheers and ap
plause of the enthusiastic audi
ence, but as he started to talk
about Russia the rally sobered
and became suddenly serious, be
cause what the governor was say
ing was serious and vitally impor
tant to the future of the world.
He told them of a new Russia
and a vibrant, determined peo
ple. He tried to dispel the idea
from the minds of his listeners
that there could ever he a re
bellion of the Russian people.
There never will be, he said,
and added, "In the language of
mid-America, 'it just ain't so.' "
Stevenson described the tremen
dous economic growth of the
country, the rapidly growing
cities that spread from Moscow
to Siberia, economic growth for
her own people and the people
friendly to her. He suggested
that it was the field of economic
advancement of the people of the
world that we must concern our
selves with. This is the field
where the Russia challenge is the
greatest, he concluded.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
A lot of interesting things get
said in the heat of a political rally.
From the Democratic rally in
Oakland we give you these gems:
A Little 'OL Lady Candidate:
'"I'm tackling the lions den when
I tackle the East Bay Utility
District." Same lady, "Now. if you
pay your water bill to the East
Ray Mud, you get to vote for the
East Bay Mud Director."
And then there was the candi
date that would like to recall the
old adverb oh, pardon me, pro
verb.
Elections are won or lost on
issues and California voters have
a large number (his year with
which to measure their candi
dates.
Presumably the biggest issue
is Proposition 18, the Right-to-
VVork measure that would outlaw
the union shop in California. To
Ihe union man, and the employer
this one issue may be enough and
they will vote for the candidate
that agrees with their view; but
to the union man's wife this isn't
enough because chances are that
she and a lot of others like her
can't make up their minds on this
issue.

themselves which of the two men
would make the better adminis
trator. Senator Knowland has
charged that Brown has handled
the Attorney General's office
badly and insinuated that the
Democrat is responsible for Calif
ornia's rising crime rate.
Brown on the other hand has
suggested that Knowland has
been out of the state for 13 years
and has lost contact here. The
Democrats point out also that it
is rumored Knowland will use the
Governor's office as a springboard
to the Presidency and will only
serve two of his four years.
Knowland denies this and says if
elected he will run for re-election
in 1962.
To some thinking voters the
political philosophies of the two
men might make some differ
ence —Knowland's eonservatism
vs. Brown's liberalism. Others
might simply resort to the party
label.
Some people might be con
cerned with Knowland's reference
to his opponent as "Buster
Brown" after making the state
ment that he had never retorted
to name calling or personalities
throughout his 25 years of public

life and wouldn't start now.
On the other hand the fact that
Brown has refused to debate
Knowland might be an issue that
could influence the votes of some
people.
Important, too, as the voters go
to the polls will be the economic
condition of the country and
California.
In any event, several million
dollars will be spent to help the
voter make up his mind.
Stevenson Speech
Most news services that covered
Adlai Stevenson's speech in Oak
land last week failed to report the
most important section, in this
writer's opinion — his final com
ments on the trip he made to Rus
sia this past summer.
The first part of Stevenson's
speech drew the cheers and ap
plause of the enthusiastic audi
ence, but as he started to talk
about Russia the rally sobered
and became suddenly serious, be
cause what the governor was say
ing was serious and vitally impor
tant to the future of the world.
He told them of a new Russia
and a vibrant, determined peo
ple. He tried to dispel the idea
from the minds of his listeners
that there could ever he a re
bellion of the Russian people.
There never will be, he said,
and added, "In the language of
mid-America, 'it just ain't so.' "
Stevenson described the tremen
dous economic growth of the
country, the rapidly growing
cities that spread from Moscow
to Siberia, economic growth for
her own people and the people
friendly to her. He suggested
that it was the field of economic
advancement of the people of the
world that we must concern our
selves with. This is the field
where the Russia challenge is the
greatest, he concluded.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
A lot of interesting things get
said in the heat of a political rally.
From the Democratic rally in
Oakland we give you these gems:
A Little 'OL Lady Candidate:
'"I'm tackling the lions den when
I tackle the East Bay Utility
District." Same lady, "Now. if you
pay your water bill to the East
Ray Mud, you get to vote for the
East Bay Mud Director."
And then there was the candi
date that would like to recall the
old adverb oh, pardon me, pro
verb.
Elections are won or lost on
issues and California voters have
a large number (his year with
which to measure their candi
dates.
Presumably the biggest issue
is Proposition 18, the Right-to-
VVork measure that would outlaw
the union shop in California. To
Ihe union man, and the employer
this one issue may be enough and
they will vote for the candidate
that agrees with their view; but
to the union man's wife this isn't
enough because chances are that
she and a lot of others like her
can't make up their minds on this
issue.
They probably agree with Sena
tor William Knowland's principle
that each man should have the
l ight to decide if he wants to join
a union or not, but they also feel
it isn't right to have "freeloaders"
working along side their hus
bands.
Their vote on Proposition 18
will be a hurried yes or no and
they will select between Mr.
Knowland and Mr. Brown on
the basis of the stands they
have taken on other issues.
They will quite naturally ask
themselves which of the two men
would make the better adminis
trator. Senator Knowland has
