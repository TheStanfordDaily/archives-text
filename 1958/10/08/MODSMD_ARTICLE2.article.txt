A "painful inadequacy" exists
in the translation of modern Per
sian literature, said Sidney Glazer
in last night's Tuesday Evening
Series lecture.
By giving the audience several
quotations and excerpts from re
cent Persian literature, Dr. Gla
zer displayed its versatility, high
quality and realism. In contrast
to the classical period, which was
composed mainly of great poetry,
the modern period is characterized
by prose.
According to Dr. Glazer, the rev
olution in Persian literature had,
and continues to exert, considera
ble influence in Ihe political field.
Modern literature is noted for its
concern with social conditions and
is often critical of both the gov
ernment and general attitudes.
Dr. Glazer said that the modern
literature deserves more attention
from Persian translators than is
presently being given. In spite of
the fact that Persian stories are
set in their native background,
much worthwhile insight into hu
man nature is provided.
