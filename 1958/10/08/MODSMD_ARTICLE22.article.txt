# With Both Eyes Open
## 
### gene stevens 
Wide-open eyes giving forth a
light the intensity of which seems
unbelievable, teeth like cultured
pearls lining the Grand Canyon,
a rasping, grating voice that on
anyone else would be a handicap.
2300 people feeling an electric ex
citement and generating same—
Louis Armstrong at Mem Aud.
This writer is hard put to think
of a better way to start off a
quarter than with a big enter
tainment feature of this sort at
the Aud. You have to go back to
appearances of Stan Kenton and
the Gateway Singers to remem
ber times as good as last Satur
day eve.
And going that far back it's
still pretty hard to say that Ken
ton or the Gateways put on as
enjoyable a show. Armstrong is
tops. He's all spirit, all joy, ac
claimed as one of America's great
ambassadors, possibly the great
est, and as one of the land's great
entertainers; great's a good word.
I wonder if it's good enough.
It's exciting to feel a Mem
Audful of people swaying to a
rhythm, tapping out a beat with
toes and hands alike, smiling as
this man of many faces and lots

of "huzzah, huzzah" and "oyezz,
oyezz" cavorts through some two
and one-half hours of great Amer
ican enjoyment.
This is the Yankee who set the
English on their ears a while
back when, \tfh-ile playing a com
mand performance before the
royal twosome and the nobility
started off a number with a nod
to King George and a "This one's
for you, Rex."
Or the same vibrant personality
who played a song for "a special
fan" (Princess Margaret > and
ended up swinging a little bit of
"Mahogany h[all Stomp." named
for a famous brolhel of the Loui
siana Creole days. And they
probably never knew, and if they
did, they didn't care.
What a feeling to join the 2299
other people in the auditorium to
applaud as Louis sings what he
thinks will he his good-night, say
ing good-night for T r u m m y
Young, trombone; Billy Kyle,
piano; Danny Barcelona, drums;
Peanuts Lovyry, clarinet; Mort
Huber, bass; and roly-poly, love
able. 100 per cent enjoyable wife
Velma Middleton.
But you know all the time that

this isn't the last number on the
program, so you don't move
when he leaves the stage, you ap
plaud, longer, harder. It happens
too seldom and it's over too soon
for you to give in that easily, and
sure enough he comes back.
Long encore over, you're on
your way, many of you to return
shortly to a local record store to
hunt down a record, any record
that'll serve as a reminder of the
guy.
And as you do you think, along
with so many more, Give Us More
of this, more big name entertain
ment, and especially more of this
guv who sings WITH BOTH
EYES OPEN.

appearances of Stan Kenton and
the Gateway Singers to remem
ber times as good as last Satur
day eve.
And going that far back it's
still pretty hard to say that Ken
ton or the Gateways put on as
enjoyable a show. Armstrong is
tops. He's all spirit, all joy, ac
claimed as one of America's great
ambassadors, possibly the great
est, and as one of the land's great
entertainers; great's a good word.
I wonder if it's good enough.
It's exciting to feel a Mem
Audful of people swaying to a
rhythm, tapping out a beat with
toes and hands alike, smiling as
this man of many faces and lots

of "huzzah, huzzah" and "oyezz,
oyezz" cavorts through some two
and one-half hours of great Amer
ican enjoyment.
This is the Yankee who set the
English on their ears a while
back when, \tfh-ile playing a com
mand performance before the
royal twosome and the nobility
started off a number with a nod
to King George and a "This one's
for you, Rex."
Or the same vibrant personality
who played a song for "a special
fan" (Princess Margaret > and
ended up swinging a little bit of
"Mahogany h[all Stomp." named
for a famous brolhel of the Loui
siana Creole days. And they
probably never knew, and if they
did, they didn't care.
What a feeling to join the 2299
other people in the auditorium to
applaud as Louis sings what he
thinks will he his good-night, say
ing good-night for T r u m m y
Young, trombone; Billy Kyle,
piano; Danny Barcelona, drums;
Peanuts Lovyry, clarinet; Mort
Huber, bass; and roly-poly, love
able. 100 per cent enjoyable wife
Velma Middleton.
But you know all the time that

this isn't the last number on the
program, so you don't move
when he leaves the stage, you ap
plaud, longer, harder. It happens
too seldom and it's over too soon
for you to give in that easily, and
sure enough he comes back.
Long encore over, you're on
your way, many of you to return
shortly to a local record store to
hunt down a record, any record
that'll serve as a reminder of the
guy.
And as you do you think, along
with so many more, Give Us More
of this, more big name entertain
ment, and especially more of this
guv who sings WITH BOTH
EYES OPEN.
Wide-open eyes giving forth a
light the intensity of which seems
unbelievable, teeth like cultured
pearls lining the Grand Canyon,
a rasping, grating voice that on
anyone else would be a handicap.
2300 people feeling an electric ex
citement and generating same—
Louis Armstrong at Mem Aud.
