# GOALS, PROGRAM ESTABLISHED
## Students, Faculty Bridge Gap 
### 
Each year, a group of 13 stu
dents and faculty members meet
weekly to promote a closer rela
tionship between faculty and stu
dents.
Formally known as the "Stu
dent Faculty Commission," an
ASSU organization under the
Constitution, the group early each
year establishes a number of
goals, and aims toward bridging
the gap between professors and
students.
Begun in 1955 by a group of
students earnestly desiring to
get to know the Stanford faculty
better, the commission has suc
ceeded in establishing programs
such as the luncheon plan, facili
tating the process of inviting fac
ulty to residence meals, and in

vestigating student-faculty lounge
prospects.
Last year committee members
were each assigned a project to
complete during the year. In
cluded among the projects were
the following:
1-Dean's Fund—working with
the Dean of Students to deter
mine the most efficient plan for
allowing students the money
needed for having faculty guests
to dinner, and in turn for allow
ing faculty money needed to en
tertain students.
2-Play Day—planning a day of
recreation for both faculty and
students; 3-Advisor Program—
aiding advisors in becoming bet
ter acquainted with their ad
visees: 4-Lounges- investigating

the possibility of finding rooms
suitable to use as Student-Fac
ulty lounges; 5-Dinner and Lunch
Plan s—eliminating "red tape"
which might deter students from
inviting faculty guests to dinner.
The newest undertaking of the
commission is to work out a pro
gram whereby a number of fac
ulty members would be invited
by the students of a particular
dormitory to eat meals at that
resident at any time. These fac
ulty guests would be invited to at
tend house meetings, and would
become a part of the house as
much as possible. According to
Sallyanne Durr, commission
chairman, this will be the biggest
project of the group this year.
Commission undertakings also
extend to the graduate level. One
graduate member is a permanent
member of the group. Last year,
a branch of the commission was
formed in the graduate school.

gram whereby a number of fac
ulty members would be invited
by the students of a particular
dormitory to eat meals at that
resident at any time. These fac
ulty guests would be invited to at
tend house meetings, and would
become a part of the house as
much as possible. According to
Sallyanne Durr, commission
chairman, this will be the biggest
project of the group this year.
Commission undertakings also
extend to the graduate level. One
graduate member is a permanent
member of the group. Last year,
a branch of the commission was
formed in the graduate school.
Each year, a group of 13 stu
dents and faculty members meet
weekly to promote a closer rela
tionship between faculty and stu
dents.
Formally known as the "Stu
dent Faculty Commission," an
ASSU organization under the
Constitution, the group early each
year establishes a number of
goals, and aims toward bridging
the gap between professors and
students.
Begun in 1955 by a group of
students earnestly desiring to
get to know the Stanford faculty
better, the commission has suc
ceeded in establishing programs
such as the luncheon plan, facili
tating the process of inviting fac
ulty to residence meals, and in

vestigating student-faculty lounge
prospects.
Last year committee members
were each assigned a project to
complete during the year. In
cluded among the projects were
the following:
1-Dean's Fund—working with
the Dean of Students to deter
mine the most efficient plan for
allowing students the money
needed for having faculty guests
to dinner, and in turn for allow
ing faculty money needed to en
tertain students.
2-Play Day—planning a day of
recreation for both faculty and
students; 3-Advisor Program—
aiding advisors in becoming bet
ter acquainted with their ad
visees: 4-Lounges- investigating

the possibility of finding rooms
suitable to use as Student-Fac
ulty lounges; 5-Dinner and Lunch
Plan s—eliminating "red tape"
which might deter students from
inviting faculty guests to dinner.
The newest undertaking of the
commission is to work out a pro
gram whereby a number of fac
ulty members would be invited
by the students of a particular
dormitory to eat meals at that
resident at any time. These fac
ulty guests would be invited to at
tend house meetings, and would
