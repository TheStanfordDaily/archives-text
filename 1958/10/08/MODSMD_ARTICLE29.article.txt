Wait till Next Year
The slock ol' second-year coaches in the Pacific (-'oast Conference
is rising ever so rapidly. As pointed out in this column last week,
the three coac hing "rookies" of the league last year were victims of
dismal seasons, and hardly had the new season started before they
were already redeeming themselves.
lion Clark, 1-9 at Southern California last year, opened the now
season with a totally unexpected 21-0 slaughter of conference favorite
Oregon State and then pressed an always-potent Michigan outfit
before losing. 20-19. Things at Troy went in the wrong direction last
week when a previously winless North Carolina team upset the
Trojans, 8-7, but nevertheless Clark has already at least equaled last
season's mark.
Then, we have California's Pete Elliott, who was carried off the
field for the second time in two years last Saturday after his team
had run a favored Washington State team off the field to the tune
ol 34-1 1. The significance of these two free rides to Pete is that they
came following the only two victories of his PCC coaching career,
for he too had a 1-9 mark in his maiden ( ?) year. But from the looks
ol Saturday's results, maybe Mr. Elliott hasti't had his last ride.
Concerning that Cal-YVSC clash: these are the same Cougars who
murdered Stanford weeks back, 40-6. But something that was hidden
pretty well from the public's eye in local accounts was that two of

WSC's three great receivers of B.
Newman passes (Jail Cogdill (11
receptions, 359 yards and 4 Til's
in the first two games) and Don
Ellingsen (45 grabs last year and
(bird-team Ail-American) —spent
almost the entire game on the
sidelines with injuries. Therefore,
the third Jack Fanning (9 TD
passes last season, one an unfor
gettable H7-yard jaunt against
Stanford) and his reserve end
cohorts had to play almost every
minute. Since Cougar ends run
miles on every play, this can get
to be tiring.
Which brings us to our third
second-year man, .lim Owens of
this week's Card foe, Washington.
Here we must offer a word of en
couragement to Big Red fans:
take a look at Owens' beginning
last year before passing judgment
on Cactus .lack Curtice's first
year. It doesn't have to be a 1-9
season, you know.
Last year Owens, with a "dark

horse" ball club (like Cactus was
supposed to have), opened with a fairly promising 0-6 fie with tough
Colorado. Admittedly, this beats Stanford's recent opening. But then
the Huskies showed up for two straight games with Kig Ten teams
. . . and showed up is about all they did . . . for they lost to Minnesota,
4f>-7, and Ohio State, 35-7. Swinging into conference action, they lost
to UCLA and Stanford, giving them an 0-5 record.
Look What Happened
Then, fans, look what happened. Washington gave league leader
Oregon State an easy, quick touchdown and then settled down and
proceeded to outplay the Beavers the rest of the way for a 19-(> win.
If anyone cares to draw a parallel: Stanford meets UCLA in its sixth
game.
The situation dropped back to normal a week later when the
Huskies were dumped by Southern California, 19-12. This must have
been the day Don Clark got a ride, for it was the Trojans 'lone victory
of the year. But the Huskies weren't down long, for a week later they j
paraded into Portland's Multnomah Stadium and disgraeed eventual
co-champion Oregon (co-champ with OSC) with a very convincing
13-6 victory.
This win, by the way, was followed by a 35-27 triumph over Cali- !
fornia in quite a scoring match. Good fortune ended with the season- j
closing traditional against YVSC, for the Huskies never even were in
that one and lost, 27-7.
So, if anyone is a believer in "omens" (?), this all might mean
thai, any flay now, Cactus -lack's dormant charges will break loose
and slap -somebody down. It isn't entirely out of the question.
And if Jack Curtice's PCC coaching career is going to parallel
•lim Owens' any further, take a look at this season. It is a 2-1 mark
for the Huskies, with that one loss being by only 12-7 to Ohio State,
the club rated No. 1 in the land at the season's start. These develop
ments tend to make the Huskies a pretty solid favorite at Stanford
Stadium this week.
A FFLLOW TO WATCH: With all this business about two-point
conversions, not too many teams are settling for the old-style one
pointers made with the toe. USC did last Friday, and shouldn't
have. But the University of Washington is acting as if it never heard
of the new rule. The Huskies have yet to try for a two-point con
version. This is not madness, or stubborn resistance to the new rule,
but only the presence of a sophomore halfback named George Flem
ing. He wears No. 25, and you'd better watch him Saturday.
Fleming hails from Dallas, Tex., and played at East Los Angeles
J< last year. He is an outstanding running back and will surely fill
in beautifully for Luther Carr and Mike McCluskey next season.
Kill what Fleming is really good at is kicking. As mentioned, Wash
ington has tried for nothing but one-point conversions this year.
George Fleming has tried all of them and he has made all of them.
Six for-six so far. And he also has a field goal, which helped edge
Minnesota.
So if Washington scores Saturday—and recent happenings make
it pretty certain they will—watch for George Fleming and his edu
cated toe.
