## Red Planes Over Straits Peril Truce 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa (/P) —Commu-
nist planes swooped over Quemoy
and touched off a hail of National
ist antiaircraft fire Tuesday,
straining the Red-proclaimed
cease-fire in Formosa Strait.
The Nationalist firing was the
first since Red China had pro
claimed a week-long halt in its
artillery pounding of the offshore
islands effective early Monday.
No further clashes were reported
then, and the Nationalists had
taken advantage of the truce to
push in more supplies by air and
sea.
AP correspondent Gene Kramer
reported from-Quemoy that Red
planes made two passes through
a high overcast Tuesday, but did
not open fire.
Ma.j. Gen. I. Fu-en, Nationalist
Air Force intelligence chief, said
both jets and propeller planes
may have been involved. This
raised speculation that the slower,
propeller craft may have taken
photographs while MIG fighters
provided cover.
