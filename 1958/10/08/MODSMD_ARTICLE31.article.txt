# Washington is New Title Threat
## 
### 
On paper, this year's University
of Washington Huskies do not
differ markedly from last sea
son's edition, but in fact they are
proving an entirely different team
and right now represent a real
"dark horse" threat for Pacific
Coast Conference honors.
With the graduation of a num
ber of last year's stalwarts, in
cluding All-Coast fullback Jimmy
Jones, the Huskies were rated a
bit weaker 1 for this season. But
they apparently don't read the
newspapers, for a host of out
standing sophomores and trans
fers have combined with a good
nucleus of veterans to get off to
an impressive start.
Washington scored a fairly un
impressive 14-6 win over San Jose
State in its opener, but has re
bounded to dump Minnesota, 24-
20, and battled top â€¢ rated Ohio
State to the wire before losing,
12-7. ,
Many Sophs
Surprising performance from a
number of sophomores off of last
season's undefeated freshman
eleven have bolstered coach Jim
Owens' attack. Four sophs have
already cracked the starting line
up this season- tackles Kurt Geg
ner and Bill K in nun e, guard
Chuck Allen and fullback Sam
Hurworth.

Pressing four letterman ends is
Stan Chappie, outstanding prep
star in Seattle, and soph quarter
backs Bob Schloredt and Phil Bor
ders are in a three-way battle for
starting duties.

The Huskies may prove the [
fastest team the Cards will face [
this season, and speed has been I
woefully lacking at Stanford. Not J
only will the Tribe have to stop {
the jet-propelled starting tandem
of Luther Carr and Mike McClus
key, but behind them are two
more speedsters, Carver Gayton
and George Fleming.
Three Deep
At fullback, although Jones can
not be replaced, Owens is three
deep with Hurworth, veteran Kirk
Wilson and Don McKeta, a 24-
year-old Pennsylvania sophomore,
who tallied the lone touchdown
against Ohio State.
But if any position holds the
key to the surprising Husky suc
cess, it would have to be quarter
back. A glaring weak spot for
Washington last year, it is now
being handled admirably by three;
boys with no varsity experience I

until this year. Bib Hivner, trans
fer from Compton JC, and Schlo
redt have done most of the signal
calling, while Borders is seeing
plenty of defensive action.
George Pitt, Jones' understudy
at fullback last year, is the Hus
kies' starting center this season.
At guard, Don Armstrong may be

I the line standout, and both of last
season's starting ends, Bruce Cla
ridge and Duane Lowell, are back.
Despite the graduation loss of
last year's line stalwarts, Dick
Day, Whitey Core and Don Mc-
Cumby, the Husky performance
so far indicates the new forward
i wall is more than adequate.
