# FIFTY TURN OUT
## Frosh Meet New Coach 
### Ron Rapoport 
"Oh, for a nice quiet Western
Civ class," and"The first four
years ace the hardest," were two
oJ' the representative comments
overheard on the freshman loot
hall practice field Tuesday.
Coach Hornet Smith has wasted
no time in getting his squad start
ed practicing the bruising funda
mentals of foot hall. While the
linemen were having a ferocious
session whamming into tackling
dummies and into each other, the
backs were busy flinging long
passes and tossing pitehou's.
IiIGGER, TOUGHER
"On paper our three opponents
(Gal, SC and UCLA) are bigger
and tougher than we are," Coach
Smith said. "Our biggest job in
the next four weeks will be to
get tough enough to make a good
showing." Smith said that he
was starting t-he team right out
running plays and using regular
defensive patterns so that he can
see right away what each player
can do.
In commenting on the Curtice
sysem which the frosh are using,
Smith said that the trend in col
lege ball is to the wide open type
of football which Curtice uses.
He said that it is not a difficult
system to learn. "We have to
convince our players that they
can score in any two-minute pe
riod in a game."
THREE GAMES
According to conference regu
lations the frosh have a schedule
of three games this year 1 . On Nov.
1, SC frosh journey here to open
the season. On Nov. 7, the Pa
pooses fly to Los Angeles for a
contest with the UCLA frosh. The
season closes on Nov. 15 with the
Little Big Game against Cal frosh
at Stanford.
The two home games will be
played at 10:45 a.m. in the Sta
dium. Ticket of admission will
be a ticket to the varsity game on
that flay.
Smith said that he was very
happy with what he had seen so
far and that all the frosh have to
do is lear n the plays and "tough
en up."
"HIT 'EM"
"Back to the tackling dummies,
guys, and hit 'em like you meant
it."
It is figured that this year's
frosh squad will be bolstered by
quarterback candidates Jim Smith
of Grants Pass, Ore., and Stanley
Lindskog of Vancouver, 8.C.;
halfbacks Gary Craig of Riverside
and Hal Steuber of Long Beach;
and tackles Chris Cottle of Los
Angeles and Jim Moe of Edina.
Minn.
Lindskog is the son of Vic Lind
skog, star center of the Clark
Shaughnessy-coached Wow Boys.

Stanford has two new football
coaches this year. To a large ex
tent, the success of the new var
sity coach, Jark Curtice, depends
on the success of the new fresh
man coach and director of incom
ing student athlete activities,
Homer Smith.
Both Activities directly affect
future varsity football teams, and
the importance of neither can be
overestimated.
As frosh football coach, it is the
responsibility of Homer Smith to
indoctrinate future varsity ball
players in the Curtice football sys
tem. As director of incoming ath
lete activities, it is the. responsi
bility of Smith to help bring to
Stanford good football players to
whom to teach the Curtice system.
A Salesman
Smith says he feels that ihere
are many good high school stu
dents who are good athletes.
These are the boys whom lie con
tacts and tries to sell on Stanford.
About coaching at Stanford,
Smith said recently: "This is an
ideal spot for a coach. At Stan
ford we play major college foot
ball, yet keep in mind that foot
ball teams are not what Stanford
exists for. This is in line with my
feelings on how football should
fit into the university picture.
Smith spent his undergraduate
days at Princeton, where he cap
tained his freshman team in 1950
and the varsity team in 1953. lie
holds the Ivy League single-game
record for rushing with 273 yards,
which he set against Harvard in
1952.
The Difference
A major difference between Ivy
League and West Coast football,
Smith said, is accounted for by
the Buck Club members and by
alumni scouts, about 1000 of
whom are constantly calling the
attention of the coaching staff to
good high school football players.
Smith is enrolled in the Gradu
ate School of Business and was a
student coaching assistant last
year. His younger brother. Dean,
was an outstanding sprinter on
the Stanford track team la-st year
as a sophomore. Another brother,
Roy, graduated from Stanford in
1956.
Smith has been serving as an
assistant varsity coach prior to
having his freshman team report.
He will probably continue in that
capacity, though he will now de
vote full time to the Papooses.
He comes from Independence,
Mo., is married, and the father of
a baby girl.
