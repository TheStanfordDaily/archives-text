# Spahn Goes For Braves
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE (/P) — Wane n
Spahn, 37-year-old Milwaukee ace,
will try to clinch the World Series
Wednesday with only two days of
rest when he faces the New York
Yankees in the sixth game. Casev
Stengel did not announce a defi
nite starter, but hinted strongly it
might be Whiley Ford instead of
Art Ditmar or Don Larsen.
Although Spahn normally works
every fourth day, and never start
ed all season with only two days
off, manager Fred Haney decided
to shoot the works with his best.
If it goes to a seventh game, he
always has Lew Burdette, his 1957
Yankee killer.
Trailing 3-2 in this best-of-seven
series in the enemy territory of
County Stadium, Stengel said he
wouldn't name his starter until
after he watched his men warm
up Wednesday.
COMPARE
"You've got 1o get a pitcher to
compare with Spahn," said Sten
gel. "Ford told me he is ready.
I'm going to talk to Larsen. 1
don't like to use him, with two or
three days' rest. He has had a
sore arm ever since I got him."
"I think Ford expects to pitch.
He always thinks I've got a weak
head if I don't pitch him. They
kicked away a game for him, oth
erwise we'd be ahead of them.
"But then Ditmar is the best
rested."
TWO DAYS OFF
If Ford works, he also will be
pitching with only two days off.
He was beaten Sunday by Spahn
when Norm Siebern messed up
three or four fly balls.
Larsen, the big right-hander
who pitched the perfect game in
1956, whipped the Braves Satur
day 4-0. However, he has been
troubled by an inflamed elbow all
season. He tired and had to be
taken out after seven innings Sat
urday.
FROM KANSAS
Ditmar, a right-hander who
came to the Yanks from Kansas
City early last year, has a 9-8 sea
son record. A year ago he was
highly effective in two bull-pen
jobs against the Braves, holding
them scoreless for a total of six
innings in 'two games.
The decision to pitch Spahn
was announced after a clubhouse
meeting that lasted only three
minutes. All Haney needed was a
chance to ask Spahn if he was
ready.
"I had Spahn in mind all
along," said Haney. "But I didn't
know for sure until I talked to
him."

"You've got 1o get a pitcher to
compare with Spahn," said Sten
gel. "Ford told me he is ready.
I'm going to talk to Larsen. 1
don't like to use him, with two or
three days' rest. He has had a
sore arm ever since I got him."
"I think Ford expects to pitch.
He always thinks I've got a weak
head if I don't pitch him. They
kicked away a game for him, oth
erwise we'd be ahead of them.
"But then Ditmar is the best
rested."
TWO DAYS OFF
If Ford works, he also will be
pitching with only two days off.
He was beaten Sunday by Spahn
when Norm Siebern messed up
three or four fly balls.
Larsen, the big right-hander
who pitched the perfect game in
1956, whipped the Braves Satur
day 4-0. However, he has been
troubled by an inflamed elbow all
season. He tired and had to be
taken out after seven innings Sat
urday.
FROM KANSAS
Ditmar, a right-hander who
came to the Yanks from Kansas
City early last year, has a 9-8 sea
son record. A year ago he was
highly effective in two bull-pen
jobs against the Braves, holding
them scoreless for a total of six
innings in 'two games.
The decision to pitch Spahn
was announced after a clubhouse
meeting that lasted only three
minutes. All Haney needed was a
chance to ask Spahn if he was
ready.
"I had Spahn in mind all
along," said Haney. "But I didn't
know for sure until I talked to
him."
