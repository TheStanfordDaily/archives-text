# Entrance Requirements Upped Again

High school seniors will have to
work harder to qualify for Stan
ford, because in 1960 there will be
three changes in the University's
high school subject requirements.
There has been a growing tend
ency among high school students
to get required "solid" subjects
out of the way early, so that
heavy studying will not put a
damper on senior year social ac
tivities. Finding that this slack
ening of mental effort in the sen
ior year makes the all-important
first year at Stanford more diffi
cult, the University will now re
quire that at least three of the
15 units in the college prepara
tory program be taken in the sen
ior year.
The two other changes are less
meaningful, since they set stand
ards most incoming Stanford stu
dents already meet. First, a unit
of laboratory science will be man
datory, enlarging the required
list to eight; the others are three
in English, two in a foreign lan
guage, and two in math. Second,
the remaining units must be dis
tributed among solid subjects—
those listed above plus history or
social sciences.
