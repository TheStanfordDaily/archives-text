# Stewart Appointed To Supreme Court
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (IP)—Potter Stewart of Cincinnati, a 43-year-old
federal circuit judge who likes "to be thought of as a lawyer," was
named to the Supreme Court Tuesday by President Eisenhower.
This was Eisenhower's fifth appointment to the nine-man court.
Stewart will take the place of Harold H. Burton, a fellow Ohioan

and fellow Republican, immedi
ately upon the 70-year-old Bur
ton's retirement next Monday.
Controversy Expected
The Stewart appointment will
be subject to Senate confirmation
when Congress returns in Janu
ary. It is likely to be given close
study, in view of controversies
that have swirled around the court
in recent years.
Here's a quick sum-up of the
new justice: Michigan-born, Yale
educated, a naval lieutenant in
World War 11, a judge for four
years with a background of law
practice in New Yqrk and Cincin
nati, an Episcopalian, married and
the father of three children.
There was a considerable ele
ment of surprise in the appoint
ment.
Monday afternoon—before Bur
ton's retirement plans were an
nounced— -Atty. Gen. William Rog
ers telephoned Stewart in Cincin
nati and asked if he could come
to Washington immediately.
At 8:30 Tuesday morning Stew
art and Rogers conferred at the
White House with Eisenhower.
Replacement Sworn
Soon after appointing Stewart,
Eisenhower looked on as Wilton
B. ("Jerry") Persons was sworn
in as the new No. 1 presidential
assistant.
But Sherman Adams, who re
signed the top White House staff
job under fire, is staying around
for a while to help Persons out.
Adams solemnly looked on from
the back of the room as Atty. Gen.
Rogers administered the oath of
office to the lean, 62-year-old,
graying retired major general.
Adams didn't stick around to join
the line of well-wishers congratu
lating Persons after the cere
mony.
