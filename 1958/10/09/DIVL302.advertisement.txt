surface, its products, peoples and
their distribution. For example, to
go from Quad to Kepler's Books Cr

slightly right, then left (avoid the
underpass) (watch out for oncoming
and outgoing traffic!.
Now head up El Camino Real in
a northeasterly direction (toward
Menlo Park, that is). One geograph
ical mile- along the Real will take
you past Kepler's. So turn around
and go back * to MacFarlane's Can
dies. There, just 2do feet northwest
of the Guild Theatre, 1 is Kepler's
Books & Magazines, home of the
Peninsula's only complete collection
of paperbound books.
If you've followed this lesson to

book?
1 Whose products include ALL the
paperbound books, art prints and
portfolios, the quarterlies, etc.
