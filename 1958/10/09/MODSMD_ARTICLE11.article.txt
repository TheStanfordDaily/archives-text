# Pope Pius XII Succumbs To Stroke, Pneumonia
## Pontiff Dies at 6:52 p.m. Wednesday; New Pope to Be Chosen in 10 Days 
### 
CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (/P) —Pope Pius XII died Thursday at
his summer palace. The Vatican radio said death occurred at 3:52
a.m. Thursday (6:52 p.m. PST Wednesday).
He had lingered and even rallied for a time after a cerebral stroke
Monday morning. He suffered a second stroke Wednesday.

Hope was given up Wednesday
night for the 82-year-old head of
the Roman Catholic Church.
At 3:20 a.m. Thursday (6:20
PST Wednesday) the Vatican ra
dio speaker, broadcasting from
the pontiff's antechamber, said
the final death agony began at
2:45 a.m. and that first signs of
the final collapse had appeared
five minutes earlier.
After his second cerebral at
tack early Wednesday his life
ebbed away.
11l Last Week
The pontiff became ill last week
with a stomach disorder and hic
cups but he continued his regular
strenuous work schedule until
Sunday.
On Monday a first cerebral cir
culatory attack struck him. He
rallied slightly but the second at
tack Wednesday was more than
his frail body could stand.
The Pope came to his summer
residence here July 27 to avoid
liome's heavy summer heat. But
he did not reduce his arduous
schedule of audiences and
speeches.
Early Thursday morning a
Mass for the dying was celebrat
ed in the chapel adjoining his
death chamber and Romans were
told to stand by for the fateful
news.
Second (Irave Illness
It was the Pope's second grave
illness in four years. He had sur
vived the first in 1954 and re
sumed full activities.
He had been Pope 19 years.
Pope Pius XII was the 261st
head of the Roman Catholic
Church. He was the first Pope
to die outside Rome since the 18th
century.
No Pope had ever died in the
summer residence here, about 18
miles from Vatican City, but Pius
XII in an apostolic constitution
which he prepared in 1945 speci
fied rules for conduct in such an
event.
Born in liome
Pius XII was born Eugenio Pa
cclli in Rome March 2, 1876. A
grandfather was a papal official
who founded L'Osservatore Ro
mano, the Vatican newspaper; his
father was a consistorial advocate
who pleaded canon law before
church courts, and Eugenio was
an altar boy at 10. He was or

dained to the priesthood at 23 and
became an assistant at the Vati
can.
The constitution specifies thai
the body of a pope dying outside
of Vatican City shall be taken
back there with decorum and dig
nity.
This could be in the form of a
tremendous procession that
would provide one of the most
moving events ever witnessed in
the history of the church.
The pontiff lapsed into uncon
sciousness about sundown Wed
nesday and the Vatican said:
"There no longer is hope."
The College of Cardinals, now
numbering 55, will elect the new
Pope—likely within the next 10
days.
Cardinals to Gather
Directed by their dean, French
born Eugene Cardinal Tisserant,
cardinals in Rome will gather as
soon as possible upon procedure
for the "interregnum," the period
from the death of the Pope to the
election of a new pontiff.
One of their first tasks will be
to arrange for the nine-day period
of solemn mourning that will he
followed by burial in the Vatican
grottos. The Pope's sepulcher
will be near the spot where
church records say St. ePter, con
sidered by Roman Catholics as
the first Pope, was buried.
