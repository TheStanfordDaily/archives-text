Tom<;ht student govkunment gels under way officially for 1958-
.'9 vvilli 11le first Legislature meeting. We say "officiallv," for since
last spring's elections John Holm an<l his stall have heen working
behind the scenes to formulate plans for the year. Tonight's Legis
lature meeting is the first time the representatives of the campus
living groups will have a chance to express opinions of their
const ituents.
In the past, attacks have been leveled at tlit- Legislature, with
complaints that LASSU meinhers operate as a group unto them
selves and never accomplish anything. W hat is the ''■something'
which Iliese attackers would have accomplished? I hey do not say.
They only sit back and cry about the ineffectiveness of student
government.
Let us look at some of the things the Legislature does accom
plish. Its committees, such as the Committee on the Undergradu
ate Library, work closely with the Administration to bring student
ideas to the Administration's attention. Athletic awards fall under
the jurisdiction of the Legislature, and this fall a survey of the
sports system is planned. More than $38,(MM) is budgeted for the
Associated Students each year, and Legislature members spend
long, tedious hours evaluating the budgets submitted by student
organizations in order to determine the best use for this money.
ASSU through its Legislature has been instrumental in raising
funds for the Tresidder Union and will be pushing this fall to get
construction started.
Hut it is difficult in a university, where opinions and ideas
cover a wide range, for one person to adequately represent his
living group if he does not know their desires.
By the ASSU constitution, each Legislature representative is
commissioned to "contact his constituents and discuss with tliein
current ASSU issues and report their opinions to the Legislature.
Legislature representatives should keep their constituents in
formed, hut they can do this only if their electors are willing
to listen.
Participation in student government provides valuable experi
ence for those who hold office, but it is also valuable to those who
elect. Active discussion of student affairs is a prelude to partici
pation in the future community of the graduate. Obviously not
everyone can hold a position in government; but just as impor
tant is the one who votes, the one who must decide whom lie wants
to represent him and why. He must evaluate his own goals for
government —then, instead of waiting for his representative to
carrv the burden alone, make his voice heard regarding the issues.

Legislature representatives should keep their constituents in
formed, hut they can do this only if their electors are willing
to listen.
Participation in student government provides valuable experi
ence for those who hold office, but it is also valuable to those who
elect. Active discussion of student affairs is a prelude to partici
pation in the future community of the graduate. Obviously not
everyone can hold a position in government; but just as impor
tant is the one who votes, the one who must decide whom lie wants
to represent him and why. He must evaluate his own goals for
government —then, instead of waiting for his representative to
carrv the burden alone, make his voice heard regarding the issues.
Tom<;ht student govkunment gels under way officially for 1958-
.'9 vvilli 11le first Legislature meeting. We say "officiallv," for since
last spring's elections John Holm an<l his stall have heen working
behind the scenes to formulate plans for the year. Tonight's Legis
lature meeting is the first time the representatives of the campus
living groups will have a chance to express opinions of their
const ituents.
In the past, attacks have been leveled at tlit- Legislature, with
complaints that LASSU meinhers operate as a group unto them
selves and never accomplish anything. W hat is the ''■something'
which Iliese attackers would have accomplished? I hey do not say.
They only sit back and cry about the ineffectiveness of student
government.
Let us look at some of the things the Legislature does accom
plish. Its committees, such as the Committee on the Undergradu
ate Library, work closely with the Administration to bring student
ideas to the Administration's attention. Athletic awards fall under
the jurisdiction of the Legislature, and this fall a survey of the
sports system is planned. More than $38,(MM) is budgeted for the
Associated Students each year, and Legislature members spend
long, tedious hours evaluating the budgets submitted by student
organizations in order to determine the best use for this money.
ASSU through its Legislature has been instrumental in raising
funds for the Tresidder Union and will be pushing this fall to get
construction started.
Hut it is difficult in a university, where opinions and ideas
cover a wide range, for one person to adequately represent his
living group if he does not know their desires.
By the ASSU constitution, each Legislature representative is
commissioned to "contact his constituents and discuss with tliein
current ASSU issues and report their opinions to the Legislature.
