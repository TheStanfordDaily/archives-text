# San Francisco Seen As Great Influence
## 
### William MrCord Assistant Dean of Humanities Sciences 
It is always hazardous for a
social scientist to attempt a pre
diction. Nevertheless, at the risk
that history will prove the judge
ment to be the height of foolish
ness (and at the perhaps equally
serious risk of being taken as a
hireling of the Chamber of Com
merce) I am willing to argue
Ihat intellectual, financial and
political power in America is in
creasingly shifting to the Pacific-
Coast — specifically to our own
"Bay Area." Indeed, within the
next quarter century, 1 would
venture the guess that San Fran
cisco will become of greater in
fluence, for good or evil, in Amer
ican life than the presently-dom
inant "golden trio" of New York,
Washington, and Boston.
Consider these facts:
In terms of population, Calif
ornia is attracting over 50,000
people a month. They come for
a variety of reasons: seeking sun,
money, challenge, peace and ten
sion. They are discontented
people—as San Francisco's rates
of alcoholism and suicide, the
highest in the world, testify. Yet
discontent has always been the
seed-bed of social creativity.
Wealth Increases
Financially, California's wealth
is burgeoning. Aircraft, agricul
ture,, electronics; Disneylands,
"Heavenly Acres," and the
"Giants" are sprouting luxuri
antly. At the same moment, tex
tiles are dying in Massachusetts;
coal mines are closing in Penn
sylvania; and the baseball teams
are deserting New York. At this
rate, Montgomery Street may
soon equal Wall Street.
Politically, California has he
roine second only to New York in
electrical power; and time is run
ing out for the East. At the next
shuffling of the House of Repre
sentatives, California will gain
Ihree seats; Massachusetts will
lose one. To the Supreme Court,
we have contributed a Warren; to
the Republicans, Nixon and Know
land; and to the radicals, an Up
ton Sinclair. It is not unlikely
that the next decade will bring a
Californian to the presidential
chair. With the rise of Asia to
world significance, San Francisco
is likely to become even more im

portant as the West's link to the
East.
Intellectually (and I, committed
to the intellectual life, regard this
as most significant) the West is
becoming a new fount of culture.
The Beatniks, equipped with
motorcycle boots, zen-buddhism,
and marijuana, have surpassed
Greenwich Village in the pro
duction of such masterpieces as,
"An ode to President Eisenhower
in honour of a dinner commemor
ating his Impeachment." More
seriously, Stanford and the Uni
versity of California have entered
the ranks of the world's great
centers of productive research.
In natural science, the West is
clearly dominant; in the social
sciences; it is rising fast; and in
the humanistic disciplines, writers
like our own Yvor Winters and
Wallace Stegner continue to pro
duce nationally significant works.
The conjunction of these trends
is, of course, no accident. Popula
tion growth leads to prosperity
and political influence; prosperity
leads to the expansion of intellec
tual life; the cultural ethos, in
turn, gives meaning and purpose
to the rest.
Becomes Center
For me, the conclusion is in
escapable: the West is becoming.
! although it is not yet, the crea
tive center of American life; on
San Francisco, as the traditional
leader of the West, falls the main
burden for the direction of these
trends. For you, as new or old
students, this phenomenon has
two implications. First, it means
that your opportunities, as mem
bers of what we must recognize
as the West's "educational elite,"
are unlimited. Second, because of
your position, it means that you
have extraordinary responsibili
! ties. For the West, as we are
I forced to admit, is still raw. We
j have a tradition made up of such
! diverse figures as Mark Twain
and Jack London; Stanford and
| Crocker; "Billy the Kid" and Fre
mont; mission priests and "self
| realization - h am bu rge r - stand"
mystics; Marilyn Monroe and
I Marlon Brando; forty-niners and
Oakies.
Which tradition will prevail,
which kind of civilization—-intel-
I lectually, politically, and socially
j will be created, depends on what
you do with the unlimited oppor
tunities offered by "Baghdad by
i the Bay."

"Bay Area." Indeed, within the
next quarter century, 1 would
venture the guess that San Fran
cisco will become of greater in
fluence, for good or evil, in Amer
ican life than the presently-dom
inant "golden trio" of New York,
Washington, and Boston.
Consider these facts:
In terms of population, Calif
ornia is attracting over 50,000
people a month. They come for
a variety of reasons: seeking sun,
money, challenge, peace and ten
sion. They are discontented
people—as San Francisco's rates
of alcoholism and suicide, the
highest in the world, testify. Yet
discontent has always been the
seed-bed of social creativity.
Wealth Increases
Financially, California's wealth
is burgeoning. Aircraft, agricul
ture,, electronics; Disneylands,
"Heavenly Acres," and the
"Giants" are sprouting luxuri
antly. At the same moment, tex
tiles are dying in Massachusetts;
coal mines are closing in Penn
sylvania; and the baseball teams
are deserting New York. At this
rate, Montgomery Street may
soon equal Wall Street.
Politically, California has he
roine second only to New York in
electrical power; and time is run
ing out for the East. At the next
shuffling of the House of Repre
sentatives, California will gain
Ihree seats; Massachusetts will
lose one. To the Supreme Court,
we have contributed a Warren; to
the Republicans, Nixon and Know
land; and to the radicals, an Up
ton Sinclair. It is not unlikely
that the next decade will bring a
Californian to the presidential
chair. With the rise of Asia to
world significance, San Francisco
is likely to become even more im

portant as the West's link to the
East.
Intellectually (and I, committed
to the intellectual life, regard this
as most significant) the West is
becoming a new fount of culture.
The Beatniks, equipped with
motorcycle boots, zen-buddhism,
and marijuana, have surpassed
Greenwich Village in the pro
duction of such masterpieces as,
"An ode to President Eisenhower
in honour of a dinner commemor
ating his Impeachment." More
seriously, Stanford and the Uni
versity of California have entered
the ranks of the world's great
centers of productive research.
In natural science, the West is
clearly dominant; in the social
sciences; it is rising fast; and in
the humanistic disciplines, writers
like our own Yvor Winters and
Wallace Stegner continue to pro
duce nationally significant works.
The conjunction of these trends
is, of course, no accident. Popula
tion growth leads to prosperity
and political influence; prosperity
leads to the expansion of intellec
tual life; the cultural ethos, in
turn, gives meaning and purpose
to the rest.
Becomes Center
For me, the conclusion is in
escapable: the West is becoming.
! although it is not yet, the crea
tive center of American life; on
San Francisco, as the traditional
leader of the West, falls the main
burden for the direction of these
trends. For you, as new or old
students, this phenomenon has
two implications. First, it means
that your opportunities, as mem
bers of what we must recognize
as the West's "educational elite,"
are unlimited. Second, because of
your position, it means that you
have extraordinary responsibili
! ties. For the West, as we are
I forced to admit, is still raw. We
j have a tradition made up of such
! diverse figures as Mark Twain
and Jack London; Stanford and
| Crocker; "Billy the Kid" and Fre
mont; mission priests and "self
| realization - h am bu rge r - stand"
mystics; Marilyn Monroe and
I Marlon Brando; forty-niners and
Oakies.
Which tradition will prevail,
which kind of civilization—-intel-
I lectually, politically, and socially
j will be created, depends on what
you do with the unlimited oppor
tunities offered by "Baghdad by
i the Bay."
It is always hazardous for a
social scientist to attempt a pre
diction. Nevertheless, at the risk
that history will prove the judge
ment to be the height of foolish
ness (and at the perhaps equally
serious risk of being taken as a
hireling of the Chamber of Com
merce) I am willing to argue
Ihat intellectual, financial and
political power in America is in
creasingly shifting to the Pacific-
Coast — specifically to our own

a variety of reasons: seeking sun,
money, challenge, peace and ten
sion. They are discontented
people—as San Francisco's rates
of alcoholism and suicide, the
highest in the world, testify. Yet
discontent has always been the
seed-bed of social creativity.
Wealth Increases
Financially, California's wealth
is burgeoning. Aircraft, agricul
ture,, electronics; Disneylands,
"Heavenly Acres," and the
"Giants" are sprouting luxuri
antly. At the same moment, tex
tiles are dying in Massachusetts;
coal mines are closing in Penn
sylvania; and the baseball teams
are deserting New York. At this
rate, Montgomery Street may
soon equal Wall Street.
Politically, California has he
roine second only to New York in
electrical power; and time is run
ing out for the East. At the next
shuffling of the House of Repre
sentatives, California will gain
Ihree seats; Massachusetts will
lose one. To the Supreme Court,
we have contributed a Warren; to
the Republicans, Nixon and Know
land; and to the radicals, an Up
ton Sinclair. It is not unlikely
that the next decade will bring a
Californian to the presidential
chair. With the rise of Asia to
world significance, San Francisco
is likely to become even more im

portant as the West's link to the
East.
Intellectually (and I, committed
to the intellectual life, regard this
as most significant) the West is
becoming a new fount of culture.
The Beatniks, equipped with
motorcycle boots, zen-buddhism,
and marijuana, have surpassed
Greenwich Village in the pro
duction of such masterpieces as,
"An ode to President Eisenhower
in honour of a dinner commemor
ating his Impeachment." More
seriously, Stanford and the Uni
versity of California have entered
the ranks of the world's great
centers of productive research.
In natural science, the West is
clearly dominant; in the social
sciences; it is rising fast; and in
the humanistic disciplines, writers
like our own Yvor Winters and
Wallace Stegner continue to pro
duce nationally significant works.
The conjunction of these trends
is, of course, no accident. Popula
tion growth leads to prosperity
and political influence; prosperity
leads to the expansion of intellec
tual life; the cultural ethos, in
turn, gives meaning and purpose
to the rest.
Becomes Center
For me, the conclusion is in
escapable: the West is becoming.
! although it is not yet, the crea
tive center of American life; on
San Francisco, as the traditional
leader of the West, falls the main
burden for the direction of these
trends. For you, as new or old
students, this phenomenon has
two implications. First, it means
that your opportunities, as mem
bers of what we must recognize
as the West's "educational elite,"
are unlimited. Second, because of
your position, it means that you
have extraordinary responsibili
! ties. For the West, as we are
I forced to admit, is still raw. We
j have a tradition made up of such
! diverse figures as Mark Twain
and Jack London; Stanford and
| Crocker; "Billy the Kid" and Fre
mont; mission priests and "self
| realization - h am bu rge r - stand"
mystics; Marilyn Monroe and
I Marlon Brando; forty-niners and
Oakies.
Which tradition will prevail,
which kind of civilization—-intel-
I lectually, politically, and socially
j will be created, depends on what
you do with the unlimited oppor
tunities offered by "Baghdad by
i the Bay."
It is always hazardous for a
social scientist to attempt a pre
diction. Nevertheless, at the risk
that history will prove the judge
ment to be the height of foolish
ness (and at the perhaps equally
serious risk of being taken as a
hireling of the Chamber of Com
merce) I am willing to argue
Ihat intellectual, financial and
political power in America is in
creasingly shifting to the Pacific-
Coast — specifically to our own
"Bay Area." Indeed, within the
next quarter century, 1 would
venture the guess that San Fran
cisco will become of greater in
fluence, for good or evil, in Amer
ican life than the presently-dom
inant "golden trio" of New York,
Washington, and Boston.
