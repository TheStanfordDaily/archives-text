# Morse Code Is On Way Out

(Editor's Not*': Tin* National
Geographic Society vends The
Daily a number of news re
leases each week. The follow
ing' article is one of many of
general interest to students.)
Morse code, now the specialty
of a retiring group of older men,
seems destined eventually to have
as few living users as Sanskirt.
The Morse operator, with a
tobacco can stuck in his "bug" as
a sound box and a pride in his
"fist" (his own style of sending!,
is being pushed aside by an army
of machines.
Teleprinters, facsimile circuits,
and automatic translators that re
quire no rare skill than typing,
are taking over. Today's begin
ning telegrapher doesn't need to
know Morse at all, the National
Geographic Society notes.
Has Special Uses-
Some of the old telegraph keys
are still in action, often at sport
ing events such as golf tourna
ments and regattas, where they
are more economical lhan heavier
installations. But the trend is seen
in major league baseball parks, a
favorite spot of the old Morse,
men, now converted to key-board
sending. This development has

brought women operators into the
press boxes, traditionally an all
male sanctuary.
One by one, the railroads are
abandoning the code that revolu
tionized traffic safety and schedu
ling. On the international airways
some Morse is still heard, but
much of that is both coded and
transmitted by machine.
Even the Boy Scouts of
America, long Morse devotees,
have lessened the Morse require
ments for their amateur-radio
merit badge. Scout officials had
considered dropping it completely,
but changed their minds after, ap
peals from the armed forces.
Soldiers have saved their lives by
a rudimentary knowledge of the
code.
Morse Mortem
Morse does not click-clack to
ward the grave unsung. The
Morse Telegraph Club of
America, made up of some 6.000

present and former Morse tele
graphers, gathers in 42 chapters
across the country to talk over
old limes and contribute to the
history of their craft.
National President W. B. Pat
terson. of 5244 Rockland Avenue,
Los Angeles, California, sadly
points out that club members are
part of "a dying art and profes
sion. . . Morse is all but finished
as a method of commercial com
munication."

quire no rare skill than typing,
are taking over. Today's begin
ning telegrapher doesn't need to
know Morse at all, the National
Geographic Society notes.
Has Special Uses-
Some of the old telegraph keys
are still in action, often at sport
ing events such as golf tourna
ments and regattas, where they
are more economical lhan heavier
installations. But the trend is seen
in major league baseball parks, a
favorite spot of the old Morse,
men, now converted to key-board
sending. This development has

brought women operators into the
press boxes, traditionally an all
male sanctuary.
One by one, the railroads are
abandoning the code that revolu
tionized traffic safety and schedu
ling. On the international airways
some Morse is still heard, but
much of that is both coded and
transmitted by machine.
Even the Boy Scouts of
America, long Morse devotees,
have lessened the Morse require
ments for their amateur-radio
merit badge. Scout officials had
considered dropping it completely,
but changed their minds after, ap
peals from the armed forces.
Soldiers have saved their lives by
a rudimentary knowledge of the
code.
Morse Mortem
Morse does not click-clack to
ward the grave unsung. The
Morse Telegraph Club of
America, made up of some 6.000

present and former Morse tele
graphers, gathers in 42 chapters
across the country to talk over
old limes and contribute to the
history of their craft.
National President W. B. Pat
terson. of 5244 Rockland Avenue,
Los Angeles, California, sadly
points out that club members are
part of "a dying art and profes
sion. . . Morse is all but finished
as a method of commercial com
munication."

Morse code, now the specialty
of a retiring group of older men,
seems destined eventually to have
as few living users as Sanskirt.
The Morse operator, with a
tobacco can stuck in his "bug" as
a sound box and a pride in his
"fist" (his own style of sending!,
is being pushed aside by an army
of machines.
