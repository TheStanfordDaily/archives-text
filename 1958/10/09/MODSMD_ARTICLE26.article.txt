# Nicolet Back; Cards Passing
## 
### 
i Stanford has been known as a passing team. Jack Curtice has been
! known as a passing coach, and the emphasis has been on passing in
Card drills this week as they prepare for Saturday's invasion by the
j University of Washington Huskies.
Bob Nicolet, senior from Whitefish Bay, Wise., has worked his way

! back into the starting quarterback
position he held at the first of the
season. Nicolet, forced to play
two years behind John Brodie and
Jack Douglas, opened the season
in the signal-calling role against
Washington State but was side
lined by a shoulder pointer before
the first half was over.
Last week, he came off the
bench to lead the Tribe on its
only serious offensive threat
against Northwestern. Dick Nor
man, whose 24 completions put
him second in Coast Conference,
will be ready to back Nicolet.
Another Boost
The Indians' passing attack got
another boost this week with the
return of Joel Freis, two-year let
terman at end. Freis has yet to
see action this season because of
a muscle-split but has taken an
active part in drills this week and
should be ready by Saturday. One
of the fastest wingmen on the
squad, his speed should help the
long-pass threat in the attack.
Only Cards definitely out of
Saturday's clash are halfback
Dick Bowers and guard Larry

Lacey, who both came up with
knee injuries at Northwestern.
Improving reserve end Trev
Grimm came up with an ankle in
jury yesterday and his status is
doubtful.
Also Missing
Also missing from yesterday's
practice was sophomore fullback
Gil Dowd, leading ground gainer
to date. Dowd was suffering from
a slight foot strain but will also
be ready for the game.
Washington will be one of four
PCC clubs left of the Card sched
ule to use the split-T attack.
Husky coach Jim Owens learned
the offense first-hand from Bud
Wilkinson at Oklahoma and as
sistants Bert Clark and Dick
lleatly are also former Sooners.
The Huskies, however, have
been very effective in straying
from the standard split-T to an
unbalanced line. This formation
was effective in several clashes
last season and was a key to the
success against both Minnesota
and Ohio State.
Ileavies
Heaviest man in the Husky
starling forward wall this season
has been 205-pound sophomore
tackle Bill Kinnune, and his run
ning mate, sophomore Kurt Geg
ner, 200, is the only other first
liner to tip 200. But ihe light for
wards typical of many split-T
powersâ€”held their own against
Ohio State, although outweighed
by 20 pounds to the man.
Card quarterbacks will have to
contend with a Husky secondary
which has intercepted six enemy
passes so far this season to lead
the PCC in that department.
Only California has been lip
against more passing than the
Huskies, despite the fact that San
Jose State has been the only real
"pass-minded" team Washington
has met.
In contrast. Stanford ranks at
the bottom of the loop in pass de
fense. yielding 409 yards through
the air, with only two intercep
tions. In rushing defense, the
Huskies are near ihe top again,
ranking second behind Oregon.
The Cards are a distant eighth in
this department, just a notch
above California.
