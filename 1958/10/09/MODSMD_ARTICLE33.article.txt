# Voltage, Length of Linear Accelerator Will Be Upped
## 
### 
Preliminary work is presently
under way on Stanford's Mark 111
linear accelerator in an $850,000
project which will lengthen the
atom-smasher from 220 to 310
i feet and step up its power to
more than a billion volts.
Work currently under way in
cludes additions to the High En
ergy Physics Laboratory that
houses the accelerator. A rein
forced concrete vault building of
900 square feet of floor space, for
the operating crew, is nearly
completed at the east end of the
laboratory. The accelerator's con
trol panel, formerly housed in the
front of the lab building, is at
present, being re-installed inside
the new vault building.
New Wing
A two-floor, $300,000 wing of
12,000 square feet will be added
across the front. It will extend 42
feel out to the present parking
lot and spread 144 feet across, ac
cording to information from the
planning office. A landscaped
new main entrance will be located
on the west side.
This work is tentatively sched
uled for completion by the end of
this year. After this, another six
months of scientific work is
scheduled: adding 90 feet to the
accelerator and installing 10 more
klystron tubes to power the elec
tron beam.
The remodeled, billion-plus-volt,
310-foot, 31-klystron atom smash
er should be ready to resume op
erations for nuclear research
within nine months, scientists es
timate.
Support for work on the accel
erator comes from the joint pro
gram of the U.S. Navy's Office of
Naval Research, the Atomic En
ergy Commission, and the Air
Force Office of Scientific Re
search. Stanford will finance the
$300,000 addition to the existing
laboratory.
Three Accelerators
Stanford now has three linear
accelerators in use on the cam
pus, plus a smaller version at the
School of Medicine in San Fran
cisco. The Mark 111 is the largest
of its type ever built, but a Stan
ford proposal to build a similar
multi-billion-volt machine is now
pending before government agen
cies.

gram of the U.S. Navy's Office of
Naval Research, the Atomic En
ergy Commission, and the Air
Force Office of Scientific Re
search. Stanford will finance the
$300,000 addition to the existing
laboratory.
Three Accelerators
Stanford now has three linear
accelerators in use on the cam
pus, plus a smaller version at the
School of Medicine in San Fran
cisco. The Mark 111 is the largest
of its type ever built, but a Stan
ford proposal to build a similar
multi-billion-volt machine is now
pending before government agen
cies.


INSTALLING CONTROLS
Technician works at accelerator
Preliminary work is presently
under way on Stanford's Mark 111
linear accelerator in an $850,000
project which will lengthen the
atom-smasher from 220 to 310
i feet and step up its power to
more than a billion volts.
Work currently under way in
cludes additions to the High En
ergy Physics Laboratory that
houses the accelerator. A rein
forced concrete vault building of
900 square feet of floor space, for
the operating crew, is nearly
completed at the east end of the
laboratory. The accelerator's con
trol panel, formerly housed in the
front of the lab building, is at
present, being re-installed inside
the new vault building.
New Wing
A two-floor, $300,000 wing of
12,000 square feet will be added
across the front. It will extend 42
feel out to the present parking
lot and spread 144 feet across, ac
cording to information from the
planning office. A landscaped
new main entrance will be located
on the west side.
This work is tentatively sched
uled for completion by the end of
this year. After this, another six
months of scientific work is
scheduled: adding 90 feet to the
accelerator and installing 10 more
klystron tubes to power the elec
tron beam.
The remodeled, billion-plus-volt,
310-foot, 31-klystron atom smash
er should be ready to resume op
erations for nuclear research
within nine months, scientists es
timate.

erator comes from the joint pro
gram of the U.S. Navy's Office of

ergy Commission, and the Air

search. Stanford will finance the
