## 
### Associated Press 
A federal judge Wednesday
slammed another door on the
South's hopes to escape racial in
tegration of classrooms when he
ruled publicly paid teachers must
not work in Virginia's makeshift
private schools as long as they
are segregated.
Already denied use of public
school buildings for private
classes in Arkansas, segregation
ists thus had the second major
prop knocked from beneath their
private school plans.

And in Charlotte, N.C., integra
tion moved another quiet step
forward when Fannie Waterman
entered the l(Hh grade at Central
High School and was cordially
greeted at the door by two or
three white girls.
At Harrisonburg, Judge John
Paul ruled that private schools
already operated on a make-do
basis at Charlottesville and plan
ned for Warren County must ad
mit Negroes or stop using teach
ers idled when schools in those
areas were closed by the state
after being ordered to admit Ne
groes.
Little Rock
In Little Rock, apparently ac
cepting the position of Ihe federal
courts that publicly owned build
ings and public money cannot be
used for segregated school oper
ations, Governor Faubus of Ar
kansas disclosed that ho and Dr.
T. J. Raney, president of the cor
poration seeking to establish pri
vate schools to replace Little
Rock's closed ones, are preparing
thousands of letters asking for
money. They are to be mailed in
about three days, on the gover
nor's stationery, to persons who
have written or wired Faubus
urging him to continue to uphold
segregation in the schools.
