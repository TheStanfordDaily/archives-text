## U.S. Hopes Cease-fire Permanent 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP)—'The Unit
ed States announced Wednesday
a halt in its Formosa Strait con
voy operations and readied an ef
fort to make Red China's cease
fire a permanent one.
The announcement was fore
shadowed by a Peiping radio
broadcast noting an absence of
U.S. warships and aircraft in the
Quemoy area.
The State Department said,
however, that the convoying "will
be resumed forthwith to the ex
tent necessary" if Red China
again starts bombarding Quemoy.
May Extend Cease-fire
Reports were that Soviet diplo
mats in Europe were saying Red
China would extend its cease-fire
beyond the seven days originally
fixed by Peiping. The week ex
pires Sunday.
With the Nationalists pledging
not to shoot unless shot at. Ameri
cans in Formosa expressed grow
ing hope the truce could be ex
tended, perhaps for months. Pei
ping originally promised only a
seven-day let up.
The Nationalists did not share
the U.S. optimism. Taipei officials
said the Reds would break the
cease fire whenever it suited them.
Islands Supplied
Nationalist ships and planes
continued tunneling tons of am
munition and other supplies to
the battered offshore island, its
stocks depleted by the 44-day Red
artillery blockade that ended last
Sunday midnight.
State Department press officer
Lincoln White announced that
U.S. convoys had been withdrawn
from the Quemoy run. He warned
they would start quickly if the
Reds started shooting again, but
expressed the hope the cease-fire
would continue.
Ambassadors to Confer
On Friday U.S. ambassador Ja
cob Beam will again confer at
Warsaw with Red Chinese ambas
sador Wang Ping-nan.
Secretary of State Dulles has
promised that U.S. - China policy
might change if the situation for
which it was designed changes.
He has said it would be foolish,
if there was a dependable cease
fire, for Nationalist China to
maintain its garrisons of 120,000
troops on Quemoy, M a t s u and
other islands lying along the
China coast.
The implication was that the
United States might seek to per
suade Nationalist President Chi
ang Kai-shek to thin out his coast
al island forces, possibly even
eventually withdrawing them
completely.
