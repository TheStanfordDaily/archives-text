spoke Joseph Wood Krutch at an
informal discussion of modern
drama held in the Little Theatre
yesterday afternoon.
Krutch spoke enthusiastically
of the rise of little theaters
in the United States. Their coun
terpart in New York is seen in
the little theaters "off Broadway."
Covering briefly the history of
drama since the turn of the cen
tury, or more precisely from 1915,
at which time he emerged in the
New York critic circle, Krutch
spoke of the effective originality
of such plays as "What Price
Glory?" "Mr. .Roberts" is but a
sea-going, World War II version
of this World War I play, he as
serted.
Krutch hinted that he thought
dramatists of the 1930's were per
haps too concerned with being so
cial critics or left-wingers to pro
duce memorable drama, though
he acknowledged such plays as
Odets' "Awake and Sing."
Krutch could not point out any
reason why no prominent drama
tists of the Barrie tradition are
writing in America today, as they
are in Europe, "except, perhaps,
we in America are too nervous to
produce comedy writing. But,"
reasoned Krutch, "Europe should
certainly have no less excuse for
nervousness than we." The cur
rent American play closest to this
Barrie - type of comedy, though
still quite different, is "The Sev
en-Year-Itch," he claimed.
