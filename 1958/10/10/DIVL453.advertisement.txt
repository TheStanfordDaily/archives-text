Ever meet a Doubting Thomas ?
A college senior once remarked to a Bell System inter
viewer: "A telephone career must be a mirage. I liear talk
about fabulous training, fascinating work, grade-A job se
curity, and rapid advancement in management. Sounds a
bit too rosy. What's the real story?"
The interviewer knew mere talk wouldn't sell a skeptic.
So he showed him some "profiles" of recent college graduates
who had enjoyed that fabulous training, had worked at
intriguing jobs, and had won early management promotions.
Our once-skeptical friend has been with the Bell System
years now—and is currently supervising the work of 55
people.
We've converted a host of Doubting Thomases. Whether
doubtful or not, you'll learn a lot about rewarding telephone
careers by talking with the Bell System interviewer when he
visits your campus. Also read the Bell Telephone booklet on
file in your Placement Oflicc, or write for "Challenge and
Opportunity" to:
