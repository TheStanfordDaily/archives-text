# U.S. Presses Red China To Extend Cease-fire
## Chiang Kai-shek Says Red Hostilities May Hasten End of Communist Rule 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) Secretary of State Dulles evidently instruct
ed the U.S. ambassador at Warsaw Thursday to press Red China for
an extension of its ceasefire in the Formosa Strait beyond next
Sunday.
The Red Chinese suspended last Sunday their bombardment of

Chinese Nationalist-held Quemoy
Island and announced the suspen
sion would continue for seven
days. They said the action was
taken for humanitarian reasons
to permit the Nationalists to
build up supplies on the island.
State Department press officer
Lincoln White told a news con
ference Thursday "we have no in
formation" that the cease-fire will
be prolonged beyond next week
end. Noting the Reds claimed it
was instituted for humanitarian
reasons, White added: "I am un
aware that something in the in
terest of humanity began on Sun
day and ends on Sunday."
Dulles said on Tuesday they
would draw worldwide condemna
tion if they started up hostilities
again.

TAIPEI, Formosa (TP) — Presi
dent Chiang aKi-shek told his peo
ple Friday Communist resump
tion of the attack on Quemoy
would hasten the end of Commu
nist rule in Peiping.
Red enlargement of the hostili
ties would "invite common action
by the free world's antiaggres
sion forces, and this concentrated
attack would hasten the end of
the Chinese Communists."
This was the gist of a 1500-word
message to troops and civilians
celebrating Nationalist China's

Independence Day—the 47th an
niversary of the 1911 revolution
that led to the establishment of
the Republic of China.
Foreign Minister Huang Shao
ku declared in an Independence
Day speech the Nationalists will
never give up Quemoy and Matsu
as the price for a permanent
cease-fire. He said the Commu
nists have concentrated 400,000
troops opposite the islands and
made virtually impossibel any re
duction in "our Nationalist forces
. . . less than one-fifth" that
strong.

WASHINGTON (/P) Secretary of State Dulles evidently instruct
ed the U.S. ambassador at Warsaw Thursday to press Red China for
an extension of its ceasefire in the Formosa Strait beyond next
Sunday.
The Red Chinese suspended last Sunday their bombardment of

Chinese Nationalist-held Quemoy
Island and announced the suspen
sion would continue for seven
days. They said the action was
taken for humanitarian reasons
to permit the Nationalists to
build up supplies on the island.
State Department press officer
Lincoln White told a news con
ference Thursday "we have no in
formation" that the cease-fire will
be prolonged beyond next week
end. Noting the Reds claimed it
was instituted for humanitarian
reasons, White added: "I am un
aware that something in the in
terest of humanity began on Sun
day and ends on Sunday."
Dulles said on Tuesday they
would draw worldwide condemna
tion if they started up hostilities
again.

TAIPEI, Formosa (TP) — Presi
dent Chiang aKi-shek told his peo
ple Friday Communist resump
tion of the attack on Quemoy
would hasten the end of Commu
nist rule in Peiping.
Red enlargement of the hostili
ties would "invite common action
by the free world's antiaggres
sion forces, and this concentrated
attack would hasten the end of
the Chinese Communists."
This was the gist of a 1500-word
message to troops and civilians
celebrating Nationalist China's

Independence Day—the 47th an
niversary of the 1911 revolution
that led to the establishment of
the Republic of China.
Foreign Minister Huang Shao
ku declared in an Independence
Day speech the Nationalists will
never give up Quemoy and Matsu
as the price for a permanent
cease-fire. He said the Commu
nists have concentrated 400,000
troops opposite the islands and
made virtually impossibel any re
duction in "our Nationalist forces
. . . less than one-fifth" that
strong.
