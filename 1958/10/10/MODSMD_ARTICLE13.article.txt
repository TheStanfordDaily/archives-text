# Legislature Alters ‘S’ Sweater Awards
## Initial Session Sees Changes 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
Like the buffalo on the plains,
the red and white varsity letter
sweaters of Stanford appear to be
on the way out.
Revisions of the athletic awards
system, presented to Legislature
at its first meeting of the year
last night, appear headed for ap
proval, and they will replace the
sweaters with block "S" rings and
blankets.
The proposals, which were
steered into the bylaws committee
for consideration, provide for:
• Block "S" blanket to be pre
sented at the end of total varsity
competition.
• Engraved block "S" ring to be
awarded at the time the varsity
season has been completed.
• Four-inch chenille block "S",
indicating sport involved and year
earned, to be placed on blanket
when presented.
There is a comment on modern
culture involved in the recommen
dation, which says:"The typical
Stanford athlete no longer wishes
to be marked as different from
his fellow students. The existing
sweater award is therefore rarely
seen or worn . . . and if they are
considered inappropriate, some
other award should be made."
Legislature also postponed for
a week discussion on a motion to
put The Axe permanently on dis
play in the Library.
The problem comes down to a
decision between bids by two bur
glar alarm companies and wheth
er the alarm would be effective
in stopping a theft. It would be
connected to the Palo Alto police
station, with the guarantee of an
officer on the scene in one to five
minutes.
