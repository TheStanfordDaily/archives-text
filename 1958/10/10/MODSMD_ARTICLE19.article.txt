## Tradition Broken 
### 
A TRADITION OF long STANDING, practiced throughout tlie country,
has i broken for tin* first time at Stanford. This year llie
groups of men with red-rimmed eyes and bleary expressions
periodically to he seen wandering around Quad will he decreased
hv one as the Sigma Alpha Kpsilon fraternity initiates its pledges
in a Help Week rather than the usual Hell Week.
The 20 pledges have been turned over to the City of I'alo Alto
as available manpower for this week. I nder the direction ol the
eitv engineer, tliev are policing roads and parks lor litter, re
painting the Sea Scout buildings at the Yacht Harbor, and land
scaping the new . M.C.A. site. I hey are also repainting the SAk
house. To combat tin* usual mortality on studies on lose a
week of studying during Hell Week and another week just to
catch up on sleep"—the pledges are required to put in a mini
mum of three hours' studying each night.
Hell Week has been a firmly established tradition, true, but
what real purpose does it serve? Sure I \ the spirit and customs
of each particular fraternity can he passed on to the pledge classes
by methods less trying ami destructive, both to pledges and to
actives. Confining initiation activities to each fraternity's house
does not lessen the useless hazing. More often than not, initiation
is a matter of whether the pledges "can take it.
As one fraternity man said, Hell Week probably keeps going
mostly because someone who's been through it once wants to
administer it too.
One of the most commendable aspects of this Help Week is
that it is being conducted iu the spirit of the Honor Code, in that
the pledges are under their own supervision to do the jobs. No
active members are needed to stand watch over them.
The idea of a Help Week is not a new one. 11 has been used
by various fraternities on other campuses for years —sometimes
at the instigation of the fraternity members, sometimes at the
request of university or college officials. But this is the first time
it has been seen on this campus, and we heartily congratulate the
SAk's for being the first to find a method of constructive initiation
more in the real spirit of brotherhood for which fraternities were
first founded.
