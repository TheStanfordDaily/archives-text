# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Knight's Campaign Upsets Own Party 
### Leo Krulitz 
Desperate and disgusting are
perhaps the two words that best
discribe the campaign Governor
Goodwin Knight is conducting and
it is upsetting to Democrats and
Republicans alike.
Republicans are upset because
Knight is at least partially re
ponsible for what has developed
into the Democrats biggest issue
of the campaign, an argument
that runs something like "If the
Republicans can't agree on issues
and policy, and if the would-be
governor and the would-be sen
ator don't get along together, how
are they to run the state effi
ciently and 'get what there is to
get from the federal govern
ment'."
The biggest stumbling block
lias been Knight's refusal to en
dorse Senator William Know
land for the governorship, even
after Vice-President Nixon po
litely suggested it would be a
good idea, before lie flew hack
to Washington after trying to
breathe a little fire into a Re
publican campaign that's gone
cold.
(Only 200 people attended a
rally of precinct chairmen and
workers in San Jose's big Civic
Auditorium, and the Keynoter,
Edward Shattuck, a GOP National
Committeeman commented,"This
hall should be full." Knowland
was the featured speaker and
about 1500 had been expected.)
Knight has given the Demo
crats their answer to Senator
Knowland's chief campaign issue,
the crime wave in California.
Knight says there isn't one. They
differ on the Right-to Work issue,
also.
It would be wrong to hold
Knight completely responsible for
the Republican's disharmony. He
was worked into the race for the
Senate to please Knowland, and
Knowland's statements about the
deficit in the California finances
which Knight vigorously denies
hasn't helped matters. However,
Knight's continuous refusal to
support Knowland publicily keeps
ihe GOP splintered in the eyes of
the people.
The Democrats have been
able to sit on the sidelines while
the Republicans fight out the
issues with each other.
Other objections have been
leveled at the type of campaign
Knight has been waging against
Congressman Clare Engle it has

been a campaign of vicious
attacks and superficial issues.
Thumbing through the press
clippings of the campaign, one
would guess that the main reason
that Knight feels Engle isn't qual
ified to represent California in the
Senate is because Engle is what
Knight has termed a "Cinderella
Colonel."
Knight claims Engle hasn't the
right to call himself a veteran,
and in a speech to the veterans of
Foreign Wars, Knight made the
comment: "True service is no 30-
day public relations tour to make
political capital for later elections.
A political candidate who would
do so invites the scorn and the
true repudiation of veteran s
everywhere."
Engle's answer was simply
that he has never claimed to be
a veteran. He is a lieutenant
colonel with the air national
guard and is also co-author of
of the World War II c;i Bill and
the Korean Bill of Rights. He
toured Korea during the war.
Governor Knigh4 has ham
mered at this irrelevant issue un
ceasingly, and the rest of his
campaign has followed these same
lines. He promised in June after
his victory over Mayor George
Christopher, "a vigorous and a
very searching and interesting
campaign." Perhaps it has been
interesting hut not very informa
tive.
And Knight's political doc
trine? He has termed it "Family
Faith" and explained it this way:
"In the family circle are em
bodied all the principles and
hopes to which I am dedicated.
The ideals of the family, the joys
of the family, its warmth, its love,
its reward—have been the fabric
of my life."
A nice political philosophy de
signed to appeal to nice American
families. But what does it tell us?
It simply affirms our belief that
Knight's campaign is based on po
litical tricks and tactics, and not
much more.
Statements like Engle is "dis
honest with the people in his at
tempt to win an election," and,
Engle is trying to make the people
believe he already is a United
States Senator — are about all
Knight has offered.
Maybe he's too busy politicking
to be concerned with telling the
people what he'll do back in Wash
ington. Maybe he's desperate. In
any event his campaign has been,
well- just a little disgusting.

get from the federal govern
ment'."
The biggest stumbling block
lias been Knight's refusal to en
dorse Senator William Know
land for the governorship, even
after Vice-President Nixon po
litely suggested it would be a
good idea, before lie flew hack
to Washington after trying to
breathe a little fire into a Re
publican campaign that's gone
cold.
(Only 200 people attended a
rally of precinct chairmen and
workers in San Jose's big Civic
Auditorium, and the Keynoter,
Edward Shattuck, a GOP National
Committeeman commented,"This
hall should be full." Knowland
was the featured speaker and
about 1500 had been expected.)
Knight has given the Demo
crats their answer to Senator
Knowland's chief campaign issue,
the crime wave in California.
Knight says there isn't one. They
differ on the Right-to Work issue,
also.
It would be wrong to hold
Knight completely responsible for
the Republican's disharmony. He
was worked into the race for the
Senate to please Knowland, and
Knowland's statements about the
deficit in the California finances
which Knight vigorously denies
hasn't helped matters. However,
Knight's continuous refusal to
support Knowland publicily keeps
ihe GOP splintered in the eyes of
the people.
The Democrats have been
able to sit on the sidelines while
the Republicans fight out the
issues with each other.
Other objections have been
leveled at the type of campaign
Knight has been waging against
Congressman Clare Engle it has

been a campaign of vicious
attacks and superficial issues.
Thumbing through the press
clippings of the campaign, one
would guess that the main reason
that Knight feels Engle isn't qual
ified to represent California in the
Senate is because Engle is what
Knight has termed a "Cinderella
Colonel."
Knight claims Engle hasn't the
right to call himself a veteran,
and in a speech to the veterans of
Foreign Wars, Knight made the
comment: "True service is no 30-
day public relations tour to make
political capital for later elections.
A political candidate who would
do so invites the scorn and the
true repudiation of veteran s
everywhere."
Engle's answer was simply
that he has never claimed to be
a veteran. He is a lieutenant
colonel with the air national
guard and is also co-author of
of the World War II c;i Bill and
the Korean Bill of Rights. He
toured Korea during the war.
Governor Knigh4 has ham
mered at this irrelevant issue un
ceasingly, and the rest of his
campaign has followed these same
lines. He promised in June after
his victory over Mayor George
Christopher, "a vigorous and a
very searching and interesting
campaign." Perhaps it has been
interesting hut not very informa
tive.
And Knight's political doc
trine? He has termed it "Family
Faith" and explained it this way:
"In the family circle are em
bodied all the principles and
hopes to which I am dedicated.
The ideals of the family, the joys
of the family, its warmth, its love,
its reward—have been the fabric
of my life."
A nice political philosophy de
signed to appeal to nice American
families. But what does it tell us?
It simply affirms our belief that
Knight's campaign is based on po
litical tricks and tactics, and not
much more.
Statements like Engle is "dis
honest with the people in his at
tempt to win an election," and,
Engle is trying to make the people
believe he already is a United
States Senator — are about all
Knight has offered.
Maybe he's too busy politicking
to be concerned with telling the
people what he'll do back in Wash
ington. Maybe he's desperate. In
any event his campaign has been,
well- just a little disgusting.
Desperate and disgusting are
perhaps the two words that best
discribe the campaign Governor
Goodwin Knight is conducting and
it is upsetting to Democrats and
Republicans alike.
Republicans are upset because
Knight is at least partially re
ponsible for what has developed
into the Democrats biggest issue
of the campaign, an argument
that runs something like "If the
Republicans can't agree on issues
and policy, and if the would-be
governor and the would-be sen
ator don't get along together, how
are they to run the state effi
ciently and 'get what there is to
get from the federal govern
ment'."

was the featured speaker and
about 1500 had been expected.)
Knight has given the Demo
crats their answer to Senator
Knowland's chief campaign issue,
the crime wave in California.
Knight says there isn't one. They
differ on the Right-to Work issue,
also.
It would be wrong to hold
Knight completely responsible for
the Republican's disharmony. He
was worked into the race for the
Senate to please Knowland, and
Knowland's statements about the
deficit in the California finances
which Knight vigorously denies
hasn't helped matters. However,
Knight's continuous refusal to
support Knowland publicily keeps
ihe GOP splintered in the eyes of
the people.
The Democrats have been
able to sit on the sidelines while
the Republicans fight out the
issues with each other.
Other objections have been
leveled at the type of campaign
Knight has been waging against
Congressman Clare Engle it has

been a campaign of vicious
attacks and superficial issues.
Thumbing through the press
clippings of the campaign, one
would guess that the main reason
that Knight feels Engle isn't qual
ified to represent California in the
Senate is because Engle is what
Knight has termed a "Cinderella
Colonel."
Knight claims Engle hasn't the
right to call himself a veteran,
and in a speech to the veterans of
Foreign Wars, Knight made the
comment: "True service is no 30-
day public relations tour to make
political capital for later elections.
A political candidate who would
do so invites the scorn and the
true repudiation of veteran s
everywhere."
Engle's answer was simply
that he has never claimed to be
a veteran. He is a lieutenant
colonel with the air national
guard and is also co-author of
of the World War II c;i Bill and
the Korean Bill of Rights. He
toured Korea during the war.
Governor Knigh4 has ham
mered at this irrelevant issue un
ceasingly, and the rest of his
campaign has followed these same
lines. He promised in June after
his victory over Mayor George
Christopher, "a vigorous and a
very searching and interesting
campaign." Perhaps it has been
interesting hut not very informa
tive.
And Knight's political doc
trine? He has termed it "Family
Faith" and explained it this way:
"In the family circle are em
bodied all the principles and
hopes to which I am dedicated.
The ideals of the family, the joys
of the family, its warmth, its love,
its reward—have been the fabric
of my life."
A nice political philosophy de
signed to appeal to nice American
families. But what does it tell us?
It simply affirms our belief that
Knight's campaign is based on po
litical tricks and tactics, and not
much more.
Statements like Engle is "dis
honest with the people in his at
tempt to win an election," and,
Engle is trying to make the people
believe he already is a United
States Senator — are about all
Knight has offered.
Maybe he's too busy politicking
to be concerned with telling the
people what he'll do back in Wash
ington. Maybe he's desperate. In
any event his campaign has been,
well- just a little disgusting.
Desperate and disgusting are
perhaps the two words that best
discribe the campaign Governor
Goodwin Knight is conducting and
it is upsetting to Democrats and
Republicans alike.
Republicans are upset because
Knight is at least partially re
ponsible for what has developed
into the Democrats biggest issue
of the campaign, an argument
that runs something like "If the
Republicans can't agree on issues
and policy, and if the would-be
governor and the would-be sen
ator don't get along together, how
are they to run the state effi
ciently and 'get what there is to
get from the federal govern
ment'."
The biggest stumbling block
lias been Knight's refusal to en
dorse Senator William Know
land for the governorship, even
after Vice-President Nixon po
litely suggested it would be a
good idea, before lie flew hack
to Washington after trying to
breathe a little fire into a Re
publican campaign that's gone
cold.

rally of precinct chairmen and
workers in San Jose's big Civic
Auditorium, and the Keynoter,
