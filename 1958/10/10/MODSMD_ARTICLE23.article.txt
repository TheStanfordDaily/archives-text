# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Primarily Political Game 
### WALTER LIPPMAN 
(Editor's Note: The Daily is
proud to once again present the
news analysis' of Walter I,ipp
mann. Lippmann's years of ex
perience in Washington make
him well qualified to discuss
current affairs.)
The move made by the Chinese
Communists, which is to order a
cease-fire at Quemoy for seven
days, is a spectacular reminder
that the game at Quemoy is pri
marily political, and that the Pei
pirig government, which holds the
high cards in the offshore island,
knows how to play them skill
fully.
Since they hold the military in
itative at Quemoy, they can turn
on the bombardment or turn it
off, as if it were a water tap. By
turning off the bombardment
without waiting to negotiate a
cease-fire, they have put Chiang
in the position where he can hard
ly refuse to supply the garrison
and civilians on Quemoy, yet
must do that only as a favor gran
ted to him by Peiping. This is,
and no doubt this is intended to
be, a very dramatic way of dem
onstrating to the Chinese on For
mosa that Red China is militarily
predominant in the area of the
offshore islands.
The Communist gambit be
came possible when Mr. Dulles
acknowledged publicly that the
United States would not carry
the war to the mainland in or
der to raise the artillery block
ade of Quemoy. The real issue
here is not always well under
stood in this country. All the
talk about "defending" Quemoy
and about not "retreating" has
contained a large dose of na
ivete in view of the real atti
tude taken by the Administra
tion. What we have been grit
ting our teeth and clenching our
fists about was the decision to
defend the island against an
invasion. There are no indica
tions that the Red Chinese have
intended to invade the island.
Our declarations and defiance
have never meant, however,
that we would defend Quemoy
against the bombardment it
self —that we would authorize
Chiang to lead us into an aerial
vtrike against the artillery pos
itions in Fukien Province.
The fact of the matter is that |
the President and Mr. Dulles have
been willing to accept the bomb- j
ardment of Quemoy and to an-1
swer it only by measures to run !
the blockade.
Their decision not to make war

against the mainland gave the
Red Chinese the initiative at
Quemoy. It.js this initiative which
Peiping is now exploiting politi
cally.
The political objective of the
Communists is to convince the
Chinese in Formosa that their
future lies with the mainland and
not in continuing to be a client of
the United States. The cease
fire, which .they "nave just insti
tuted, is accompanied by an offer
to negotiate with Chiang about
a settlement of the offshore is
lands. It is probably implied in
the statement that Peiping
wishes to negotiate with the
United States at Warsaw about
the specifically Chinese-American
issues.
The offer to Chiang follows
closely upon, and is no doubt re
lated to, what was said by Presi
dent Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles '
at their press conference last
week. They said a lot. They
knocked out the idea that Chiang
will return to the mainland, and
in doing this they destroyed the
fiction that he is in truth the
legitimate government of China.
For a sovereign who has no hope
of government is like a king who
has lost his throne. Peiping has
been quick to point out to Chiang
and to the Chinese on Formosa
that their choice is between exile
in Formosa and a deal with the
mainland.
This does not mean that there
will soon be a deal between the
two Chinese factions. There
will be much maneuvering, no
doubt, both publicly and pri
vately. But it does mean that
the ground has been prepared
and the seeds have been planted
for a Chinese deal. This should
surprise no one. It has long
been most probable that as we
were playing the game with
Chiang, the end would be a deal
in which we would be left on
the outside.
The fatal error of our policy
has been refusal to see that the
military threat to Formosa was
negligible, given our indisput
able command of the sea but
that Formosa could not be saved
from absorption by ihe mainland
if we staked everything on

Chiang. Without a policy disen
gaged from Chiang and designed
to maintain some kind of auton
omy in Formosa after he departs,
we have no tenable policy of our
own. We are tied to Chiang and
what happens to our interests
will be determined by Chiang or
his successors.
Our misleading preoccupation
with the military defense of For
mosa has been and is a grave
handicap to lucid thinking in this
field. The President, for example,
has no legal authority to use
American power in Quemoy ex
cept as he can say with good con
science that what happens at
Quemoy is related to the military
defense of Formosa. Mr. Dulles
tried for a while to construct a
legal position for him.
As for (lie United States hav
ing to prove its courage, or to
lose all ils friends, I would say
■ that what we do about Quemoy
is a test of the courage of the
United States only if we an
nounce to the world that we re
{ gard it as- a test of our courage.
The world knows that we have
fought three big wars in the
past fifty years and the world,
friendly, hostile and neutral,
will have no doubt about the
courage of this country.
Otherwise, the problem of Que
moy is a practical problem which
could and should be treated not
as if we stood at Armageddon
but coolly, calmly, and with com
mon sense. Quemoy is not like
Berlin any more than it is like
London, Paris, or Washington.
Evacuating Quemoy is not like
the appeasement at Munich. For
Czechoslovakia was an indepen
dent nation which was set up by
a treaty and guaranteed by the
Allies. Quemoy is an island of no
political significance within a
harbor on the Chinese mainland.
Czechoslovakia was a country
which contained the strategic bas
tion of Central and Eastern
Europe. Strategically, Quemoy
is negligible. It is negligible for
the defense of Formosa. It is
negligible for the defense of the
mainland. It is merely a minor
nuisance.

him well qualified to discuss

The move made by the Chinese
Communists, which is to order a
cease-fire at Quemoy for seven
days, is a spectacular reminder
that the game at Quemoy is pri
marily political, and that the Pei
pirig government, which holds the
high cards in the offshore island,
knows how to play them skill
fully.
Since they hold the military in
itative at Quemoy, they can turn
on the bombardment or turn it
off, as if it were a water tap. By
turning off the bombardment
without waiting to negotiate a
cease-fire, they have put Chiang
in the position where he can hard
ly refuse to supply the garrison
and civilians on Quemoy, yet
must do that only as a favor gran
ted to him by Peiping. This is,
and no doubt this is intended to
be, a very dramatic way of dem
onstrating to the Chinese on For
mosa that Red China is militarily
predominant in the area of the
offshore islands.
The Communist gambit be
came possible when Mr. Dulles
acknowledged publicly that the
United States would not carry
the war to the mainland in or
der to raise the artillery block
ade of Quemoy. The real issue
here is not always well under
stood in this country. All the
talk about "defending" Quemoy
and about not "retreating" has
contained a large dose of na
ivete in view of the real atti
tude taken by the Administra
tion. What we have been grit
ting our teeth and clenching our
fists about was the decision to
defend the island against an
invasion. There are no indica
tions that the Red Chinese have
intended to invade the island.
Our declarations and defiance
have never meant, however,
that we would defend Quemoy
against the bombardment it
self —that we would authorize
Chiang to lead us into an aerial
vtrike against the artillery pos
itions in Fukien Province.
The fact of the matter is that |
the President and Mr. Dulles have
been willing to accept the bomb- j
ardment of Quemoy and to an-1
swer it only by measures to run !
the blockade.
Their decision not to make war

against the mainland gave the
Red Chinese the initiative at
Quemoy. It.js this initiative which
Peiping is now exploiting politi
cally.
The political objective of the
Communists is to convince the
Chinese in Formosa that their
future lies with the mainland and
not in continuing to be a client of
the United States. The cease
fire, which .they "nave just insti
tuted, is accompanied by an offer
to negotiate with Chiang about
a settlement of the offshore is
lands. It is probably implied in
the statement that Peiping
wishes to negotiate with the
United States at Warsaw about
the specifically Chinese-American
issues.
The offer to Chiang follows
closely upon, and is no doubt re
lated to, what was said by Presi
dent Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles '
at their press conference last
week. They said a lot. They
knocked out the idea that Chiang
will return to the mainland, and
in doing this they destroyed the
fiction that he is in truth the
legitimate government of China.
For a sovereign who has no hope
of government is like a king who
has lost his throne. Peiping has
been quick to point out to Chiang
and to the Chinese on Formosa
that their choice is between exile
in Formosa and a deal with the
mainland.
This does not mean that there
will soon be a deal between the
two Chinese factions. There
will be much maneuvering, no
doubt, both publicly and pri
vately. But it does mean that
the ground has been prepared
and the seeds have been planted
for a Chinese deal. This should
surprise no one. It has long
been most probable that as we
were playing the game with
Chiang, the end would be a deal
in which we would be left on
the outside.
The fatal error of our policy
has been refusal to see that the
military threat to Formosa was
negligible, given our indisput
able command of the sea but
that Formosa could not be saved
from absorption by ihe mainland
if we staked everything on

Chiang. Without a policy disen
gaged from Chiang and designed
to maintain some kind of auton
omy in Formosa after he departs,
we have no tenable policy of our
own. We are tied to Chiang and
what happens to our interests
will be determined by Chiang or
his successors.
Our misleading preoccupation
with the military defense of For
mosa has been and is a grave
handicap to lucid thinking in this
field. The President, for example,
has no legal authority to use
American power in Quemoy ex
cept as he can say with good con
science that what happens at
Quemoy is related to the military
defense of Formosa. Mr. Dulles
tried for a while to construct a
legal position for him.
As for (lie United States hav
ing to prove its courage, or to
lose all ils friends, I would say
■ that what we do about Quemoy
is a test of the courage of the
United States only if we an
nounce to the world that we re
{ gard it as- a test of our courage.
The world knows that we have
fought three big wars in the
past fifty years and the world,
friendly, hostile and neutral,
will have no doubt about the
courage of this country.
Otherwise, the problem of Que
moy is a practical problem which
could and should be treated not
as if we stood at Armageddon
but coolly, calmly, and with com
mon sense. Quemoy is not like
Berlin any more than it is like
London, Paris, or Washington.
Evacuating Quemoy is not like
the appeasement at Munich. For

Otherwise, the problem of Que
moy is a practical problem which
could and should be treated not
as if we stood at Armageddon
but coolly, calmly, and with com
mon sense. Quemoy is not like
Berlin any more than it is like
London, Paris, or Washington.
Evacuating Quemoy is not like
the appeasement at Munich. For
Czechoslovakia was an indepen
dent nation which was set up by
a treaty and guaranteed by the
Allies. Quemoy is an island of no
political significance within a
harbor on the Chinese mainland.
Czechoslovakia was a country
which contained the strategic bas
tion of Central and Eastern
Europe. Strategically, Quemoy
is negligible. It is negligible for
the defense of Formosa. It is
negligible for the defense of the
mainland. It is merely a minor
nuisance.

him well qualified to discuss

The move made by the Chinese
Communists, which is to order a
cease-fire at Quemoy for seven
days, is a spectacular reminder
that the game at Quemoy is pri
marily political, and that the Pei
pirig government, which holds the
high cards in the offshore island,
knows how to play them skill
fully.
Since they hold the military in
itative at Quemoy, they can turn
on the bombardment or turn it
off, as if it were a water tap. By
turning off the bombardment
without waiting to negotiate a
cease-fire, they have put Chiang
in the position where he can hard
ly refuse to supply the garrison
and civilians on Quemoy, yet
must do that only as a favor gran
ted to him by Peiping. This is,
and no doubt this is intended to
be, a very dramatic way of dem
onstrating to the Chinese on For
mosa that Red China is militarily
predominant in the area of the
offshore islands.
The Communist gambit be
came possible when Mr. Dulles
acknowledged publicly that the
United States would not carry
the war to the mainland in or
der to raise the artillery block
ade of Quemoy. The real issue
here is not always well under
stood in this country. All the
talk about "defending" Quemoy
and about not "retreating" has
contained a large dose of na
ivete in view of the real atti
tude taken by the Administra
tion. What we have been grit
ting our teeth and clenching our
fists about was the decision to
defend the island against an
invasion. There are no indica
tions that the Red Chinese have
intended to invade the island.
Our declarations and defiance
have never meant, however,
that we would defend Quemoy
against the bombardment it
self —that we would authorize
Chiang to lead us into an aerial
vtrike against the artillery pos
itions in Fukien Province.
The fact of the matter is that |
the President and Mr. Dulles have
been willing to accept the bomb- j
ardment of Quemoy and to an-1
swer it only by measures to run !
the blockade.
Their decision not to make war

against the mainland gave the
Red Chinese the initiative at
Quemoy. It.js this initiative which
Peiping is now exploiting politi
cally.
The political objective of the
Communists is to convince the
Chinese in Formosa that their
future lies with the mainland and
not in continuing to be a client of
the United States. The cease
fire, which .they "nave just insti
tuted, is accompanied by an offer
to negotiate with Chiang about
a settlement of the offshore is
lands. It is probably implied in
the statement that Peiping
wishes to negotiate with the
United States at Warsaw about
the specifically Chinese-American
issues.
The offer to Chiang follows
closely upon, and is no doubt re
lated to, what was said by Presi
dent Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles '
at their press conference last
week. They said a lot. They
knocked out the idea that Chiang
will return to the mainland, and
in doing this they destroyed the
fiction that he is in truth the
legitimate government of China.
For a sovereign who has no hope
of government is like a king who
has lost his throne. Peiping has
been quick to point out to Chiang
and to the Chinese on Formosa
that their choice is between exile
in Formosa and a deal with the
mainland.
This does not mean that there
will soon be a deal between the
two Chinese factions. There
will be much maneuvering, no
doubt, both publicly and pri
vately. But it does mean that
the ground has been prepared
and the seeds have been planted
for a Chinese deal. This should
surprise no one. It has long
been most probable that as we
were playing the game with
Chiang, the end would be a deal
in which we would be left on
the outside.
The fatal error of our policy
has been refusal to see that the
military threat to Formosa was
negligible, given our indisput
able command of the sea but
that Formosa could not be saved
from absorption by ihe mainland
if we staked everything on

Chiang. Without a policy disen
gaged from Chiang and designed
to maintain some kind of auton
omy in Formosa after he departs,
we have no tenable policy of our
own. We are tied to Chiang and
what happens to our interests
will be determined by Chiang or
his successors.
Our misleading preoccupation
with the military defense of For
mosa has been and is a grave
handicap to lucid thinking in this
field. The President, for example,
has no legal authority to use
American power in Quemoy ex
cept as he can say with good con
science that what happens at
Quemoy is related to the military
defense of Formosa. Mr. Dulles
tried for a while to construct a
legal position for him.
As for (lie United States hav
ing to prove its courage, or to
lose all ils friends, I would say
■ that what we do about Quemoy
is a test of the courage of the
United States only if we an
nounce to the world that we re
{ gard it as- a test of our courage.
The world knows that we have
fought three big wars in the
past fifty years and the world,
friendly, hostile and neutral,
will have no doubt about the
courage of this country.
Otherwise, the problem of Que
moy is a practical problem which

lose all ils friends, I would say
■ that what we do about Quemoy
is a test of the courage of the
United States only if we an
nounce to the world that we re
{ gard it as- a test of our courage.
The world knows that we have
fought three big wars in the
past fifty years and the world,
friendly, hostile and neutral,
will have no doubt about the
courage of this country.
Otherwise, the problem of Que
moy is a practical problem which
could and should be treated not
as if we stood at Armageddon
but coolly, calmly, and with com
mon sense. Quemoy is not like
Berlin any more than it is like
London, Paris, or Washington.
Evacuating Quemoy is not like
the appeasement at Munich. For
Czechoslovakia was an indepen
dent nation which was set up by
a treaty and guaranteed by the
Allies. Quemoy is an island of no
political significance within a
harbor on the Chinese mainland.
Czechoslovakia was a country
which contained the strategic bas
tion of Central and Eastern
Europe. Strategically, Quemoy
is negligible. It is negligible for
the defense of Formosa. It is
negligible for the defense of the
mainland. It is merely a minor
nuisance.

proud to once again present the
news analysis' of Walter I,ipp
mann. Lippmann's years of ex
perience in Washington make
him well qualified to discuss
current affairs.)
The move made by the Chinese
Communists, which is to order a
cease-fire at Quemoy for seven
days, is a spectacular reminder
that the game at Quemoy is pri
marily political, and that the Pei
pirig government, which holds the
high cards in the offshore island,
knows how to play them skill
fully.
Since they hold the military in
itative at Quemoy, they can turn
on the bombardment or turn it
off, as if it were a water tap. By
turning off the bombardment
without waiting to negotiate a
cease-fire, they have put Chiang
in the position where he can hard
ly refuse to supply the garrison
and civilians on Quemoy, yet
must do that only as a favor gran
ted to him by Peiping. This is,
and no doubt this is intended to
be, a very dramatic way of dem
onstrating to the Chinese on For
mosa that Red China is militarily
predominant in the area of the
offshore islands.
The Communist gambit be
came possible when Mr. Dulles
acknowledged publicly that the
United States would not carry
the war to the mainland in or
der to raise the artillery block
ade of Quemoy. The real issue
here is not always well under
stood in this country. All the
talk about "defending" Quemoy
and about not "retreating" has
contained a large dose of na
ivete in view of the real atti
tude taken by the Administra
tion. What we have been grit
ting our teeth and clenching our
fists about was the decision to
defend the island against an
invasion. There are no indica
tions that the Red Chinese have
intended to invade the island.
Our declarations and defiance
have never meant, however,
that we would defend Quemoy
against the bombardment it
self —that we would authorize
Chiang to lead us into an aerial
vtrike against the artillery pos
itions in Fukien Province.
The fact of the matter is that |
the President and Mr. Dulles have
been willing to accept the bomb- j
ardment of Quemoy and to an-1
swer it only by measures to run !
the blockade.
Their decision not to make war

against the mainland gave the
Red Chinese the initiative at
Quemoy. It.js this initiative which
Peiping is now exploiting politi
cally.
The political objective of the
Communists is to convince the
Chinese in Formosa that their
future lies with the mainland and
not in continuing to be a client of
the United States. The cease
fire, which .they "nave just insti
tuted, is accompanied by an offer
to negotiate with Chiang about
a settlement of the offshore is
lands. It is probably implied in
the statement that Peiping
wishes to negotiate with the
United States at Warsaw about
the specifically Chinese-American
issues.
The offer to Chiang follows
closely upon, and is no doubt re
lated to, what was said by Presi
dent Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles '
at their press conference last
week. They said a lot. They
knocked out the idea that Chiang
will return to the mainland, and
in doing this they destroyed the
fiction that he is in truth the
legitimate government of China.
For a sovereign who has no hope
of government is like a king who
has lost his throne. Peiping has
been quick to point out to Chiang
and to the Chinese on Formosa
that their choice is between exile
in Formosa and a deal with the
mainland.
This does not mean that there
will soon be a deal between the
two Chinese factions. There
will be much maneuvering, no
doubt, both publicly and pri
vately. But it does mean that
the ground has been prepared
and the seeds have been planted
for a Chinese deal. This should
surprise no one. It has long
been most probable that as we
were playing the game with
Chiang, the end would be a deal
in which we would be left on
the outside.
The fatal error of our policy
has been refusal to see that the
military threat to Formosa was
negligible, given our indisput
able command of the sea but
that Formosa could not be saved
from absorption by ihe mainland
if we staked everything on

Chiang. Without a policy disen
gaged from Chiang and designed
to maintain some kind of auton
omy in Formosa after he departs,
we have no tenable policy of our
own. We are tied to Chiang and
what happens to our interests
will be determined by Chiang or
his successors.
Our misleading preoccupation
with the military defense of For
mosa has been and is a grave
handicap to lucid thinking in this
field. The President, for example,
has no legal authority to use
American power in Quemoy ex
cept as he can say with good con
science that what happens at
Quemoy is related to the military
defense of Formosa. Mr. Dulles
tried for a while to construct a
legal position for him.
As for (lie United States hav
ing to prove its courage, or to
lose all ils friends, I would say
■ that what we do about Quemoy
