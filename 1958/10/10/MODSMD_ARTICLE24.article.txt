HOW GREEN WAS MY CAMPUS
Don't tell me: I know how busy you've been! I know all the
things you've had to do in the opening days of the school year
registering, paying fees, finding lodgings, entering a drag race,
getting married, building a cage for your raccoon. But now,
with all these essentials out of tlie way, let us pause and join
hands and take, for the first time, a long, leisurely look at our
campus.
Ready? Let's go!
We begin our tour over hero on this lovely stretch of green
sward called The Mall. The Mall, as we all know, was named in
honor of our distinguished alumnus Fred Mall, inventor of the
opposing thumb. Before Mr. Mall's invention, the thumb could
not be pressed or clicked against the other fingers. As a result,
millions of Castanet makers were out of work. Today however,
thanks to Mr. Mall, one out of every three Americans is gain
fully employed making castanets. (The other two make croquet
wickets.) Mr. Mall is now 100 years old and living in seclusion
on a sea cliff in Wellington, Kansas, hut the old gentleman is
far from idle. He still works twelve hours a day in his labora
tory, and in the last year has invented the tuna, the cuticle,
and lint.

Jk old 6crtl£m is w{tvM ic//e^
Hut I digress. Lot, us resume our tour. At the end of The
Mull we see a handsome edifice called The Library. Here books
are kept. By "kept" 1 mean "kept." There is no way in the
world for you to get a book out of the library ... No, I'm
wrong. If you have a stack permit you can take out a book,
but stack permits are issued only to widows of Presidents of the
United States. (That lady you see coming out of the library
with ;i copy of (lirl of tin Litnberlosl is Mrs. Millard Fillmore.)
Next to The Library we see the Administration Building.
Here one finds the president of the university, the deans, and
the registrar. According to ancient academic usage, the president
is always called "Prexy." Similarly, the deans are called "Dixie"
and the registrar is called "Roxy." Professors are called "Proxy"
and housemothers are called "Hoxy-Moxy." Students are
called "Algae."
I )iagonallv across The Mall we see the Students Union. It is
n gay mad place, frankly dedicated to the fun and relaxation
of we undergraduates. Here we undergraduates may enjoy
ourselves in one of two ways —with filter or without. We under
graduates who prefer filters, prefer Marlboro, of course. Oh,
what a piece of work is Marlboro! The filter filters, the taste is
smooth but not skimpy, mild but not meagre.
We undergraduates who prefer non-filters, prefer Philip
Morris, of corris. It is a natural smoke, a clean smoke, a flavor
ful, zestful, pure and peaceful smoke ... Now hear this: Philip
Morris and Marlboro each come in a choice of two packs —
crush proof Flip-Top Box or the familiar Soft Pack.
So now, as the setting sun casts a fierv aura over the spires
and battlements of our beloved campus, let us hie ourselves to
our tobacconist's and lay in a night's supply of Marlboro or
Philip Morris, and then let us, lowing, wind slowly o'er the lea
to our dormitories and sit upon our army surplus cots, spent
but content, and smoke and dream and hark the curfew toll the
knell of parting day. Aloha, fair campus, aloha!

I )iagonallv across The Mall we see the Students Union. It is
n gay mad place, frankly dedicated to the fun and relaxation
of we undergraduates. Here we undergraduates may enjoy
ourselves in one of two ways —with filter or without. We under
graduates who prefer filters, prefer Marlboro, of course. Oh,
what a piece of work is Marlboro! The filter filters, the taste is
smooth but not skimpy, mild but not meagre.
We undergraduates who prefer non-filters, prefer Philip
Morris, of corris. It is a natural smoke, a clean smoke, a flavor
ful, zestful, pure and peaceful smoke ... Now hear this: Philip
Morris and Marlboro each come in a choice of two packs —
crush proof Flip-Top Box or the familiar Soft Pack.
So now, as the setting sun casts a fierv aura over the spires
and battlements of our beloved campus, let us hie ourselves to
our tobacconist's and lay in a night's supply of Marlboro or
Philip Morris, and then let us, lowing, wind slowly o'er the lea

HOW GREEN WAS MY CAMPUS
Don't tell me: I know how busy you've been! I know all the
things you've had to do in the opening days of the school year
registering, paying fees, finding lodgings, entering a drag race,
getting married, building a cage for your raccoon. But now,
with all these essentials out of tlie way, let us pause and join
hands and take, for the first time, a long, leisurely look at our
campus.
Ready? Let's go!
We begin our tour over hero on this lovely stretch of green
sward called The Mall. The Mall, as we all know, was named in
honor of our distinguished alumnus Fred Mall, inventor of the
opposing thumb. Before Mr. Mall's invention, the thumb could
not be pressed or clicked against the other fingers. As a result,
millions of Castanet makers were out of work. Today however,
thanks to Mr. Mall, one out of every three Americans is gain
fully employed making castanets. (The other two make croquet
wickets.) Mr. Mall is now 100 years old and living in seclusion
on a sea cliff in Wellington, Kansas, hut the old gentleman is
far from idle. He still works twelve hours a day in his labora
tory, and in the last year has invented the tuna, the cuticle,
and lint.

Jk old 6crtl£m is w{tvM ic//e^
Hut I digress. Lot, us resume our tour. At the end of The
Mull we see a handsome edifice called The Library. Here books
are kept. By "kept" 1 mean "kept." There is no way in the
world for you to get a book out of the library ... No, I'm
wrong. If you have a stack permit you can take out a book,
but stack permits are issued only to widows of Presidents of the
United States. (That lady you see coming out of the library
with ;i copy of (lirl of tin Litnberlosl is Mrs. Millard Fillmore.)
Next to The Library we see the Administration Building.
Here one finds the president of the university, the deans, and
the registrar. According to ancient academic usage, the president
is always called "Prexy." Similarly, the deans are called "Dixie"
and the registrar is called "Roxy." Professors are called "Proxy"
and housemothers are called "Hoxy-Moxy." Students are
called "Algae."
