# Married Student Housing Project Ground Broken
## 
### Jack Clumeck 
Ground has been broken, and in
a big way, at the site of Stanford's
new married students' housing
area. Graders and earth movers
are working daily to smooth the
42-acre area in preparation for the
construction of 250 apartments
housed in 54 buildings.
Work is being done by the firm
of Williams & Burrows of Bel
mont, whose bid of $2,163,634 was
the lowest received. This figure
was within 1 per cent of the proj
ect's estimated cost, reported El
dridge T. Spencer, University di
rector of planning.
Rehouse Gratis
The new housing area, in the
fields bounded by Stanford Ave
nue and Escondido Road, will con
sist of 56 one-bedroom, 140 two
bedroom and 54 three â€¢ bedroom
apartments, designed mainly for
married graduate students who
must be rehoused before Stanford
Village closes in 1965.
If all goes as planned, the first
phase of construction will be
ready for use for autumn quarter
of next year. Construction of the
building is slated to begin within
a month, or as soon as roads are
staked and foundations laid out.
Target Date
The fall target date for com
pletion is coordinated with the
opening of the Stanford Medical
Center, so that the housing will
be available for medical students
and families as well as for other
married graduate students.
Future plans for further devel
opment of this area call for 1000
to 1250 more living units. Plan
ning director Spencer called at
tention to the need for the mar
ried students' housing by citing
figures showing that "1532, or
nearly one-fifth of our students,
are married. . . . Their children
number 1579."
