# Question: Will ‘Red’ Man Bite Dog?

Stanford gets a chance to stop one of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence's most improved football team« tomorrow when the University
of Washington Huskies come to Stanford Stadium for their first
league test. Came time is 2 p.m.
Not figured prominently in title talk at the start of the season,
ihe Huskies have vaulted into real contention during the past two
weeks on the strength of performances against respected Big Ten
foes. First, they dumped Minnesota, 24-20, and then last week were
beaten only 12-7 by an Ohio State team rated by many as the nation's
finest.
Meanwhile, the Cards were absorbing two more one-sided losses
and they currently stand 0-3, with 13 points scored and 98 against.
Sophs, Transfers in Lineup
The Huskies, figured in the "building" and "doubtful" stage this
season, have cashed in on a number of outstanding sophomores from
last year's unbeaten freshman team, plus key transfers, to be the
league's real surprise team. At least four sophomores and one trans
fer are expected to be in Coach Jim Owens' starting lineup tomorrow,
with that many more in front-line reserve roles.
Stanford hopes to pass against the Huskies. Quarterbacks Bob
Nicole! and Dick Norman will pose a two-deep aerial threat against
a Husky secondary which has already intercepted six passes.
Nicolet, senior tri-eaptain, returned to the lineup against North
western last week after being sidelined by injuries since the Wash
ington State game. Touted as the longest passer of the Tribe quarter
backs, his presence will bolster the air game, along with that of senior
end Joel Freis, expected to see his first action of the season tomorrow.
Freis is the fastest of the Card ends and should present the long
pass threat, which has been conspicuously missing from the attack.
Assistant coach Dutch Fehring, who scouted the Huskies against
Ohio State last week, reports that Washington's young, light line
forced the Buckeyes to punt 13 times during the game. "This is quite
a performance, considering Ohio State is always one of the country's
lop running teams," Fehring said. "As our ground game has yet to
get going this season, we figure it will be tough to run against the
Huskies . . . so we're going to try to pass."
Dowtl's Foot O.K.
The Indians' leading ground gainer this season, sophomore full
back Gil Dowd, is expected to be ready for action tomorrow, although
he has missed several practices this week because of a foot strain.
Lack of sound quarterbacking and variety in the attack was the
major handicap to the Huskies last season. But this year three totally
new signal callers Bob Hivner of South Gate, a transfer from Comp
ton JC; Bob Schloredt of Gresham, Ore., and home-grown Phil Bor
ders have been more than adequate in filling the void.
As for the attack, Fehring counted six different formations
against Ohio State, running from their conventional split-T to spreads,
flankers and unbalanced lines.
The Huskies' "fleet fleet" of halfbacks may be the fastest the
Cards will face this year. Equally dangerous as running backs or
flankers are veteran seniors Luther Carr and Mike McCluskey, not
to mention their outstanding reserves, George Fleming and Carver
Gayton. Fleming also kicks one-point conversions and has not missed
this year.
Two sophomores, Don McKeta of Robertsdale, Pa., and Sam Hur
worth, have pushed letterman Kirk Wilson out of the picture at
fullback.
In the line, three sophomores will be starting for the Huskies.
Both tackles, Bill Kinnune and Kurt Gegner, are first-year men. and
yearling guard Chuck Allen is touted as a future standout. Stanford's
line will outweigh the Husky forwards, 209-197, but this same Wash
ington line gave away 20 pounds to Ohio State and spent an afternoon
pushing Buckeyes all over the field.

Dowtl's Foot O.K.
The Indians' leading ground gainer this season, sophomore full
back Gil Dowd, is expected to be ready for action tomorrow, although
he has missed several practices this week because of a foot strain.
Lack of sound quarterbacking and variety in the attack was the
major handicap to the Huskies last season. But this year three totally
new signal callers Bob Hivner of South Gate, a transfer from Comp
ton JC; Bob Schloredt of Gresham, Ore., and home-grown Phil Bor
ders have been more than adequate in filling the void.
As for the attack, Fehring counted six different formations
against Ohio State, running from their conventional split-T to spreads,
flankers and unbalanced lines.
The Huskies' "fleet fleet" of halfbacks may be the fastest the
Cards will face this year. Equally dangerous as running backs or
flankers are veteran seniors Luther Carr and Mike McCluskey, not
to mention their outstanding reserves, George Fleming and Carver
Gayton. Fleming also kicks one-point conversions and has not missed
this year.
Two sophomores, Don McKeta of Robertsdale, Pa., and Sam Hur
worth, have pushed letterman Kirk Wilson out of the picture at
fullback.
In the line, three sophomores will be starting for the Huskies.
Both tackles, Bill Kinnune and Kurt Gegner, are first-year men. and
yearling guard Chuck Allen is touted as a future standout. Stanford's
line will outweigh the Husky forwards, 209-197, but this same Wash
ington line gave away 20 pounds to Ohio State and spent an afternoon
pushing Buckeyes all over the field.
Stanford gets a chance to stop one of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence's most improved football team« tomorrow when the University
of Washington Huskies come to Stanford Stadium for their first
league test. Came time is 2 p.m.
Not figured prominently in title talk at the start of the season,
ihe Huskies have vaulted into real contention during the past two
weeks on the strength of performances against respected Big Ten
foes. First, they dumped Minnesota, 24-20, and then last week were
beaten only 12-7 by an Ohio State team rated by many as the nation's
finest.
Meanwhile, the Cards were absorbing two more one-sided losses
and they currently stand 0-3, with 13 points scored and 98 against.
Sophs, Transfers in Lineup
The Huskies, figured in the "building" and "doubtful" stage this
season, have cashed in on a number of outstanding sophomores from
last year's unbeaten freshman team, plus key transfers, to be the
league's real surprise team. At least four sophomores and one trans
fer are expected to be in Coach Jim Owens' starting lineup tomorrow,
with that many more in front-line reserve roles.
Stanford hopes to pass against the Huskies. Quarterbacks Bob
Nicole! and Dick Norman will pose a two-deep aerial threat against
a Husky secondary which has already intercepted six passes.
Nicolet, senior tri-eaptain, returned to the lineup against North
western last week after being sidelined by injuries since the Wash
ington State game. Touted as the longest passer of the Tribe quarter
backs, his presence will bolster the air game, along with that of senior
end Joel Freis, expected to see his first action of the season tomorrow.
Freis is the fastest of the Card ends and should present the long
pass threat, which has been conspicuously missing from the attack.
Assistant coach Dutch Fehring, who scouted the Huskies against
Ohio State last week, reports that Washington's young, light line
forced the Buckeyes to punt 13 times during the game. "This is quite
a performance, considering Ohio State is always one of the country's
lop running teams," Fehring said. "As our ground game has yet to
get going this season, we figure it will be tough to run against the
Huskies . . . so we're going to try to pass."
