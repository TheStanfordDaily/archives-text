MILWAUKEE (/P) — Manager
Fred Haney refused to alibi the
Braves' World Series collapse
Thursday, saying, "Instead of
moaning, let's talk about how
good their pitchers were."
The clubhouse was relaxed.
There even was some horseplay in
the showers and wisecracks by in
dividual players.
"I give them all the credit in
the world. I have no alibis, and
neither do my players. We had
our chances. They beat us. They
deserved to win. To the victor
belongs the spoils.
"The turning point was in our
bats. We scored 17 runs in out
first two games and only seven
in the last five.

"Let's not talk about our bat
ting slump," he said. "Let's talk
about their pitching. Bob Turley
pitched greal ball. So did Whitey
Ford, only he was unlucky.
