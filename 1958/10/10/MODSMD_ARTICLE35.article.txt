### 
MILWAUKEE (/P) — Strong
armed Bob Turley led the revived
New York Yankees to the great
est baseball comeback in 33 years
Thursday as they stormed back
from a 3-1 deficit to dethrone Mil
waukee in the seventh game of
the World Series.
Turley, working his third
straight game, dazzled the Braves
with a two-hit relief job over 6%

innings while the Yanks clubbed
Lew Burdetie for a (5 2 victory.
It was sweel revenge for the
Yanks, three-time losers to Bur
dette a year ago, as they ripped
into their tormentor for four big
runs in the eighth inning, break
ing a 2-2 tie.
Burdette had yielded two un
earned runs in the second but the
Braves scored first off shaky Don

Larson and tied ihe score on Dol
Crandall's homer off Turley in
the sixth.
Two men were out when the
Yankee uprising started with a
long double to right by Yogi
Berra that just missed being a
home run by about two feet. The
drive bounced off a padding high
on the right field barrier.
Elston Howard fouled off one
pitch and looked at a ball before
he bounced a single over second
base. Berra hustled home with
the big winning run.
Andy Carey, hit less in 11 I rips,
smashed a single off Eddie Math
ews' glove into, short left before

Bill Skowron hammered a 22
pitch far and away over the fence
in the left center field for a 415-
foot three-run homer.
Burdette bowe d his head,
pawed at the dirt resignedly, and
finally closed out the inning by
striking out Tony Kubek.
Crandall's homer with two out
in the sixth was the only hit off
the Yanks' 21-game winner until
Joe Adcock sliced a pinch single
to left with two gone in the ninth.
When Mickey Mantle gathered in
Red Schoendienst's fly to center
for the final out, the short reign
of the Braves had ended.
