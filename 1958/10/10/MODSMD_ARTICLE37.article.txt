East Hay Wind

From across the Bay comes a rather strange-smelling wind these
days- especially from the editorial pages of the University of Cali
fornia's Daily California!). That newspaper, or—it looks like—that
school's Administration, has gone to bat in some pretty high-sounding
terms for the new Athletic Association of Western Universities and
Cal's position therein.
This writer, though he would find it pretty hard to find a good
deal of actual worth in the way that organization is presently being
constituted, is rather amazed that a group terming their publication
"The Monarch of the College Dailies" would support it in the terms
they use.
The Cal situation was touched off by an editorial in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle on Sept. 19 entitled "Obituary Note on the Dying
PCC." It mentions changes in the conference brought on by "Los
angelism," a virus which was eventually to kill the PCC.
The editorial went on to say:
"In some mysterious manner, the four offending universities
suddenly came to the conclusion that the PCC was too lax in its
standards. They withdrew, declaring that they were in search of
higher goals than those maintained by the conference. . . .
"The mystery has deepened. California has joined witli USC,
UCLA and Washington in forming a new football league. USC does
not have the same admission standards as California. Neither do
most of the other teams which have been suggested to fill empty
spaces on California's schedule for future noneonference years. Their
common interest seems to be principally large, full stadiums and
winning teams.
"Thus the erstwhile academic saint has turned up unexpectedly
in the company of the pack of athletic rascals. Losangelist 'realism'
has won. Good-by, Pacific Coast Conference! Good luck, Fast Bay
Packers!"
The Daily Cal came back with a multi-part article intended to give
the Berkeley athletic picture a nice white and the cleanest pair of
hands this side (or any side) of an Ivory soap bar.
It starts by referring to the "so-called" scandal in the PCC. "So
called," maybe, because that's exactly what it was. But this is minor.
The article goes on to add that "California university officials fought
hard to hold the PCC together." And then the obvious question of
"When?" arises. Was it while they were violating conference regu
lations on aid and services to athletes? Or was it after they'd been
discovered and were trying every last trick to save a little hit of a
pretty scarred face?
The same article purports that the university tried to got some
of the other universities' basic philosophies accepted by the confer
ence to try to save it. And about the only comeback to this is that,
while basic, some of these philosophies were pretty athletically base.
When the PCC didn't accept the California 5-point program, the
Berkeley school, its sister campus in L.A. and USC bolted the con
ference in a "Let's not play at all if we can't play with our rules in
our backyard" attitude.
Now the "higher ideals" boys are running through dictionaries
talking about the AAWU. The Daily Cal opens its mouth wide enough
to have a battalion of feet shoved into it when it admits that "A brief
look at the setup of the new Athletic Association of Western Univer
sities gives a good indication of the direction in which California is
headed in the future." Then it makes these points:
No. I—Under1 —Under the AAWU, each member university will be respon
sible for honestly conducting its own athletic program. To which I
must add that they couldn't do it before, and I don't know that a
responsibility pill has appeared on the market in the meantime.
No. 2 —There are no penalties. If doubts about another school's
policies arise, the two schools confer directly, and if dissatisfied a
school can drop the other from its schedule. So this is what California
wanted in the way of penalties in the first place; they'd have gotten
off much cheaper three years ago. And, as for schools conferring . . .
well, George Dickerson has shown us the value of this theory.
No. B—The8 —The AAWU will be founded on mutual trust rather than
the mutual distrust implied in the PCC. Any mutual distrust of the
PCC would have had to come from the schools who dumped on one
another, and pretty rightly so.
No. 4 —Academic standards similar to Cal's will be required before
that school is scheduled. This is ridiculous before it even gets started.
Washington and USC and a host of prospective intersectionals don't
begin to measure up to the fine school that Cal really is. The Daily
Cal article attempts to say that "facts do not indicate that USC and
Washington are very far below California, which, it must be remem
bered, is rated the third best university in the nation."
Oh, come on, now! SC, it says, "has recently established a mini
mum of 800 on the College Fntranee Board test as a requirement for
admission. Stanford has the same minimum." There are a few points
to be made here to rectify this abortion.
Stanford has no minimum as such. A student below a certain
point will not be considered, but the CEB is only a part of the Stan
ford requirements. Not only that, but the medium on the CEB is
1000; competition at Stanford has made the average entrant a much
higher scorer than even that. And 800 does not seem too significant
where 1600 points are possible, 400 is usually an absolute low and
1000 is average. For out-of-state entrants, Cal itself requires 1000
points.
It appears that Cal took a beating in the PCC stink and is now
trying to pour gallons of 10c-aquart smeller on the AAWU, which
really isn't any more sweet-smelling than its predecessor.
