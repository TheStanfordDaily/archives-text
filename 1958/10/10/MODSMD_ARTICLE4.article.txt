## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/!')â€”
The United States and its West
ern allies are proposing suspen
sion of all nuclear weapons tests
while attempts are made to nego
tiate a permanent ban.
Informed sources said Thurs
day night this is a key part of a
U.S. resolution to be introduced
Friday in the U.N. General As
sembly's 81-nation Political Com
mittee.
The move obviously is aimed to
bring pressure on the Soviet Un
ion, which has resumed tests in
advance of U.S. - British - Soviet
talks due to start in Geneva Oct.
31.
There has been speculation that
the Rusians may be getting ready
to scuttle the talks on ending
tests under an international in
spection system.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko said on Monday that the
Russians feel free to continue
tests until they reach the total of
the United States and Britain
combined since March 31. That is
the date the Russians announced
a unilateral decision to end tests.
