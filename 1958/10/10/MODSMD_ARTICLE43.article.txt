# Yanks Loud After 6-2 Series Win

### 
MILWAUKEE (A y ) â€” "Now wo
look like we could play in the
National League!"
A proud, beaming Casey Sten
gel shouted this jibe across the
hilarious New York dressing room
after the Yankees beat the Mil
waukee Braves, 6-2, to win the
World Series Thursday.
The mob of writers, photogra
phers and radio-TV men looked
like a bunch of dogs in a butcher
shop trying to settle on a hero.
Moose Skowron, whose three
run homer in the eighth killed the
Braves for keeps, was the center
of most attention.
But Elston Howard, who sin
gled home Yogi Berra to start the
Yanks' four-run eighth after two
were out, also was mobbed. So
were Bob Turley, who allowed
only two hits in a splendid relief
role, and the great-fielding Gil
McDougald.
Speechless
The 68-year-old Stengel's eyes
were sparkling, and for an instant
he appeared speechless. Then the
torrent of words came:
"Didn't that fellow Turley pitch
a whale of a game?
"This was a great series victory
because we started so poorly.
Then we came together. Now we
look like the real New York
Yankees.
Play in National
"Now we look like we could
play in the National League."
This was a slam at Milwaukee
pitcher Lew Burdette. who said,
after winning the second series
game, "I'd like to see the Yankees
in the National League. I think
our league has two or three teams
as tough as the Yankees."
This also was the thought of a
lot of observers who believed the
Yankees had a breeze in the
American League and would have
had quite a struggle in the Na
tional loop.
Manager Fred Haney of the
Braves visited the Yankee dress
ing room to congratulate his rival
manager.
