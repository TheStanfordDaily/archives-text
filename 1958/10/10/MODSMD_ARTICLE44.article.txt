Almost
Defending co-champion Oregon
"almost" made history again last
week, dropping a 6-0 decision to
No. 1-ranked Oklahoma. In do
ing so, the Ducks outgained the
Sooners by 100 yards and in two
games have yielded an average of
only 135 yards a game. USC,
meanwhile, was dropping its sec
ond straight intersectional, this
time to North Carolina, 8-7.
Both Oregon and USC are 1-0
in conference play. The Trojans
opened with a 21-0 shocker over
OSC and Oregon topped Idaho,
27-0. in its lid-lifter.
Washington State's mighty air
attack will try to get back in high
gear against a very rugged Idaho
team in the annual "Battle of the
Palouse." After their smashing
opening triumph over Stanford
the Cougars were nipped by
Northwestern and 1 a s t wee k
rudely bounced by California, 34-
14.
Idaho bounced back from two

opening losses to squelch Utah
last week, 20-0. The Vandals ap
parently have found a passer in
Joe Espinoza and should pose a
real test for Bob Newman and
mates.
(al'OSSCtip
California will be up against a
fabled passer for the second
straight week when ii hosts Utah
and Lee Grosseup. WSC's New
man had little trouble completing
passes against the Bears last
week, but a rugged defense and
an explosive offense gave Oal its
first win of the season.
Seeking its third straight shut
out triumph, OSC meets Skyline
favorite Wyoming at Laramie.
The Beavers rebounded from the
opening loss to USC to stop Kan
sas, 12-0, and UCLA, 14-0.
The mis-firing Bruins take on
Southeastern Conference power
Florida tonight in the Los Ange
les Coliseum.
