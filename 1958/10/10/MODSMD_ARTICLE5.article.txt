# Krutch Speaks Of Man's Mind In 3rd Lecture
## 
### Diana Smith 
Joseph Wood Krutch asserted
that the notion of the human
"mind" as a blank slate capable
only of registering the expe
riences of its existence is an un
satisfying one, in the second of
the 1958 West Memorial Lectures
last night at Memorial Audito
rium.
"Tabula Rasa, or How Blank Is
the Slate?" was the noted critic's
subject in a lecture which criti
cized the theory that man is what
ever his environment makes of
him.
Three Classes
"There are . . . not just two
classes of animal behavior, inborn
and learned, but also a third and
enormously important one—
learning ability itself." Krutch
explianed that this third alterna
tive is a capacity of the mind for
discriminating among human ex
periences and forming judgments
about them.
He quoted Alexander Pope:
"Nature affords at least a glim
m'ring light;/The lines, though
touched but faintly, are drawn
right." In this special sense of a
capacity to exercise moral judg
ments, Krutch claimed that there
is such a thing as "human na
ture."
No Innate Ideas
The human mind has no innate
ideas, but. it has the capacity to
be happy with certain ideas. The
lines of human nature are touch
ed too faintly to be obvious; they
are rather a latent image ready
to be developed, he observed.
"To distinguish correctly be
tween true nature and habit is one
of the most difficult tasks we
could set ourselves, but it also
might be one of the most impor
tant."
No Prejudices
"To try to live without 'moral
prejudices'—that is, without mak
ing value judgments, is to try to
live in a condition so repugnant
to our nature that it cannot for
long be endured." Krutch pro
posed this view in favorable con
trast to the doctrine embraced by
our society, ". . . that morals are
no more than customs."
The behaviorist psychologists
have defined morality as behavior
which is approved of by a particu
lar society, said Krutch. He added
they should also point out that no
society which has learned this def
inition of morality has ever lasted
long.
