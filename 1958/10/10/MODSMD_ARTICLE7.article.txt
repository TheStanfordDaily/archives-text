## Mourners Pay Honor To Pontiff 
### Associated Press 
Thousands of mourners filed
past the body of Pope Pius XII
Thursday night in humble obei
sance to the pontiff who died ear
lier in the day.
Death of the 82-year-old pontiff
after 19 Vis years as head of the
Roman Catholic Church plunged
much of the Christian world into
mourning.
A crowd of 15,000 men, women
and children pushed through the
main square of Castel Gandolfo
and began filtering at dusk
through the doors of the pontifi
cal summer palace.
Channel Throng
Inside, Swiss Guards in blue,
red and orange uniforms sought
to channel the great throng into
a narrow column going up the
broad main marble stairway to
ward the Swiss Hall on the top
folor of the four-story building.
In addition to the residents of
Castel Gandolfo and the sur
rounding area specifically invited
to file past the remains of the
Pope who died in their midst,
there were many persons from
other parts of Italy in the throng
and also some foreigners.
The public viewing of the body
was delayed two hours because
the embalming had not been com
pleted.
St. Peter's
The body will be taken to Rome
privately Friday at the start of
nine days of mourning. It will be
placed in a crypt below St. Pe
ter's Basilica Sunday or Monday.
At the Vatican, cardinals from
in and around Rome chose Bene
detto Cardinal Aloisi Masella as
papal chamberlain to administer
church affairs until a new pope
is chosen.
Msgr. Alberto de Jorio, regent
of the sacred college's secretariat,
was named secretary of the con
sistory of cardinals that will elect
the new pope. The cardinals must
meet within 18 days to begin se
lection of the new pontiff.
