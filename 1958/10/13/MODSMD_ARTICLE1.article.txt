# Tribe Sees First Win; Whacks Huskies 22-12
## McMillen Big In Card Win; Nicolet Shines 
### Bob Payne 
It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk
lin, Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson,
Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni
kolai and Freis.
Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for
