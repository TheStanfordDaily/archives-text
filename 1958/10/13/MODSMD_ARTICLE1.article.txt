# Tribe Sees First Win; Whacks Huskies 22-12
## McMillen Big In Card Win; Nicolet Shines 
### Bob Payne 
It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk
lin, Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson,
Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni
kolai and Freis.
Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for

Washington Huskies in the Stadium on Saturday.
the first time this season at a one
point placement conversion try.
Then came the turning point of
the ball game. Others may place
this time-honored weekly incident
much later, but here, with barely
five minutes played, it began to
unfold.
Washington coach Jim Owens,
understandably thinking at this
point that things were indeed go
ing off as scheduled, inserted his
vsecond unit. Then things started
happening. Nicolet passed incom
plete, narrowly missing an inter
ception. This was followed by a
short pitchout to McMillen, who
tore around right end for 17
yards, a first down and an indica
tion of things to come.
Like Old Times
Then McMillen got one at cen
ter. Nicolet found Joel Freis for
11) yards and another first down.
McMillen packed the leather three
straight times — for 5, 4 and 9
yards—and yet another first down
. . . on the Husky 24. Things really
looked like old times when Nicolet
struck to John Bond for a 17-yard
gain to the Washington 7. On the
next play McMillen fumbled, Kirk
Wilson of Washington recovered
and the drive ended.
Rut, although disguised at the
time, the turning point had just
popped up, because this had been
by far the best Indian sustained
drive of the season 53 yards in
eight simple plays.
Forced to Punt
The Huskies fought their way
out to the 38 before Ihe Tribe
stiffened and forced them to punt.
Nicolet started the next drive with
a 9-yard toss to Bond. Gains by
Gil Dowd and McMillen moved the
Stanfords into Husky territory,
and I he now-rampaging Rick took
his favorite pitchout, this time
around the left side, and dashed
27 yards down to the 15.
After an incomplete pass, Mc-
Millen got 10 yards at left end to
narrowly miss a first down and
followed with 5 more at the same
place for a touchdown. Skip Face's
perfect conversion made it 7-G.
Not the First
This was not the first time the
Cards h;id led this season. Two
weeks earlier they had held an
identical advantage by virtue of
Face's kick against Rice. The final
on that one was 30-7, Owls.
However, this Stanford score
had been gained by two, not one,
beautiful drives, and the Tribes
men were finding s u c h drives
amazingly easy.
Bad Man Break rooted his ugly
head again immediately after the
next kickoff when Indians, either
Dick Norman or Doug Dick by
name, were whistled down for a
questionable pass interference in
fraction that gave the Huskies a
first down on the Card 20. Wash
ington scored from there in five
plays, with quarterback Bob Iliv

ner sneaking for the final 2 yards.
The conversion—not by Fleming
—missed again, and the Huskies
were back in front, 12-7.
It appeared now that maybe
Lady Luck would never get to
gether with the Tribe. For then,
started by a 16-yard gainer by
McMillen, the Cards drove to the
Washington 9, where Doug Dick's
fumble was recovered by Husky
Bill Kinnune. The running of Mc-
Millen and Dick and two Nicolet
to - Irv Nikolai passes propelled
this just-short drive.
Hopeful Anticipation
So ended the half, and it was
with hopeful anticipation that the
Stanford rooters sat as the third
quarter opened.
Immediately, good things hap
pened for the Tribe. On Washing
ton's second play after taking the
kick, Nicolet intercepted a Hivner
aerial on the 37 and returned to
the Husky 25. After an incom
plete pass and a 5-yard pop by
Dick, McMillen demonstrated he
had forgotten nothing during the
half time and sped 20 yards around
the right side for a touchdown.
Face was accurate again and the
Cards were ahead to stay; only
1':42 had elapsed.
McMillen, Again
The remainder of the third
quarter was taken up by a double
exchange of punts, the last of
w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole
again.
A Stanford offside penally and
two very short line plays got the
Huskies a few yards when, on
third-and-4, quarterback Phil Bor
ders was separated from the ball,
and center Roch Cotiklin pounced
on it at the 20. Doug Dick and
Jim Byrer got short yardage, and
then Nicolet hit—of all people—
McMillen for a 15-yard gain to the
1-yard line. At that point "Nick,"
really showing the colors of a true
Card quarterback, fired to John
Bond on a flare pattern for the
touchdown.
Two Points
Just to -show they could do ev
erything, the Indians lined up for
a two-point conversion, and Nico
let came through, striking to
Chris Burford for the final points.
With 13 minutes and 25 seconds
left, Washington was going to
have to do more than score a
touchdown and even a two-point
conversion.
In the statistical column, add
Nicolet's 15-for-29 passing mark
for 127 yards, and Dick's 48 clutch
rushing pickups to McMillen's big
rushing figure, and the result is
300 of the 378 Tribe total yards.
But if defensive performance
can be measured statistically,
compare the Huskies' 207 net
yards to the 267 they gained
against big, bad Ohio State the
previous week. No, it won't be
the last win.

Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni

Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for

the first time this season at a one
point placement conversion try.
Then came the turning point of
the ball game. Others may place
this time-honored weekly incident
much later, but here, with barely
five minutes played, it began to
unfold.
Washington coach Jim Owens,
understandably thinking at this
point that things were indeed go
ing off as scheduled, inserted his
vsecond unit. Then things started
happening. Nicolet passed incom
plete, narrowly missing an inter
ception. This was followed by a
short pitchout to McMillen, who
tore around right end for 17
yards, a first down and an indica
tion of things to come.
Like Old Times
Then McMillen got one at cen
ter. Nicolet found Joel Freis for
11) yards and another first down.
McMillen packed the leather three
straight times — for 5, 4 and 9
yards—and yet another first down
. . . on the Husky 24. Things really
looked like old times when Nicolet
struck to John Bond for a 17-yard
gain to the Washington 7. On the
next play McMillen fumbled, Kirk
Wilson of Washington recovered
and the drive ended.
Rut, although disguised at the
time, the turning point had just
popped up, because this had been
by far the best Indian sustained
drive of the season 53 yards in
eight simple plays.
Forced to Punt
The Huskies fought their way
out to the 38 before Ihe Tribe
stiffened and forced them to punt.
Nicolet started the next drive with
a 9-yard toss to Bond. Gains by
Gil Dowd and McMillen moved the
Stanfords into Husky territory,
and I he now-rampaging Rick took
his favorite pitchout, this time
around the left side, and dashed
27 yards down to the 15.
After an incomplete pass, Mc-
Millen got 10 yards at left end to
narrowly miss a first down and
followed with 5 more at the same
place for a touchdown. Skip Face's
perfect conversion made it 7-G.
Not the First
This was not the first time the
Cards h;id led this season. Two
weeks earlier they had held an
identical advantage by virtue of
Face's kick against Rice. The final
on that one was 30-7, Owls.
However, this Stanford score
had been gained by two, not one,
beautiful drives, and the Tribes
men were finding s u c h drives
amazingly easy.
Bad Man Break rooted his ugly
head again immediately after the
next kickoff when Indians, either
Dick Norman or Doug Dick by
name, were whistled down for a
questionable pass interference in
fraction that gave the Huskies a
first down on the Card 20. Wash
ington scored from there in five
plays, with quarterback Bob Iliv

ner sneaking for the final 2 yards.
The conversion—not by Fleming
—missed again, and the Huskies
were back in front, 12-7.
It appeared now that maybe
Lady Luck would never get to
gether with the Tribe. For then,
started by a 16-yard gainer by
McMillen, the Cards drove to the
Washington 9, where Doug Dick's
fumble was recovered by Husky
Bill Kinnune. The running of Mc-
Millen and Dick and two Nicolet
to - Irv Nikolai passes propelled
this just-short drive.
Hopeful Anticipation
So ended the half, and it was
with hopeful anticipation that the
Stanford rooters sat as the third
quarter opened.
Immediately, good things hap
pened for the Tribe. On Washing
ton's second play after taking the
kick, Nicolet intercepted a Hivner
aerial on the 37 and returned to
the Husky 25. After an incom
plete pass and a 5-yard pop by
Dick, McMillen demonstrated he
had forgotten nothing during the
half time and sped 20 yards around
the right side for a touchdown.
Face was accurate again and the
Cards were ahead to stay; only
1':42 had elapsed.
McMillen, Again
The remainder of the third
quarter was taken up by a double
exchange of punts, the last of
w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole
again.
A Stanford offside penally and
two very short line plays got the
Huskies a few yards when, on
third-and-4, quarterback Phil Bor
ders was separated from the ball,
and center Roch Cotiklin pounced
on it at the 20. Doug Dick and
Jim Byrer got short yardage, and
then Nicolet hit—of all people—
McMillen for a 15-yard gain to the
1-yard line. At that point "Nick,"
really showing the colors of a true
Card quarterback, fired to John
Bond on a flare pattern for the
touchdown.
Two Points
Just to -show they could do ev
erything, the Indians lined up for
a two-point conversion, and Nico
let came through, striking to
Chris Burford for the final points.
With 13 minutes and 25 seconds
left, Washington was going to
have to do more than score a
touchdown and even a two-point
conversion.
In the statistical column, add
Nicolet's 15-for-29 passing mark
for 127 yards, and Dick's 48 clutch
rushing pickups to McMillen's big
rushing figure, and the result is
300 of the 378 Tribe total yards.
But if defensive performance
can be measured statistically,
compare the Huskies' 207 net
yards to the 267 they gained
against big, bad Ohio State the
previous week. No, it won't be
the last win.


HIM AGAIN —Junior halfback Kick McMillen is
on his way toward Stanford's first touchdown in
the second quarter of Saturday's game after get-

ting by Husky end Bruce ( laridge. McMillen
gained 185 yards in 26 carries for a 7.1-yards
per-carry game average.


40 YARDS —Pass interference is called on Stanford quarterback
Hick Norman as he takes Washington halfback Nicholl ont of con
tention while teammate Doug Dick reaches for the ball. The play

It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk

ing off as scheduled, inserted his
vsecond unit. Then things started
happening. Nicolet passed incom
plete, narrowly missing an inter
ception. This was followed by a
short pitchout to McMillen, who
tore around right end for 17
yards, a first down and an indica
tion of things to come.
Like Old Times
Then McMillen got one at cen
ter. Nicolet found Joel Freis for
11) yards and another first down.
McMillen packed the leather three
straight times — for 5, 4 and 9
yards—and yet another first down
. . . on the Husky 24. Things really
looked like old times when Nicolet
struck to John Bond for a 17-yard
gain to the Washington 7. On the
next play McMillen fumbled, Kirk
Wilson of Washington recovered
and the drive ended.
Rut, although disguised at the
time, the turning point had just
popped up, because this had been
by far the best Indian sustained
drive of the season 53 yards in
eight simple plays.
Forced to Punt
The Huskies fought their way
out to the 38 before Ihe Tribe
stiffened and forced them to punt.
Nicolet started the next drive with
a 9-yard toss to Bond. Gains by
Gil Dowd and McMillen moved the
Stanfords into Husky territory,
and I he now-rampaging Rick took
his favorite pitchout, this time
around the left side, and dashed
27 yards down to the 15.
After an incomplete pass, Mc-
Millen got 10 yards at left end to
narrowly miss a first down and
followed with 5 more at the same
place for a touchdown. Skip Face's
perfect conversion made it 7-G.
Not the First
This was not the first time the
Cards h;id led this season. Two
weeks earlier they had held an
identical advantage by virtue of
Face's kick against Rice. The final
on that one was 30-7, Owls.
However, this Stanford score
had been gained by two, not one,
beautiful drives, and the Tribes
men were finding s u c h drives
amazingly easy.
Bad Man Break rooted his ugly
head again immediately after the
next kickoff when Indians, either
Dick Norman or Doug Dick by
name, were whistled down for a
questionable pass interference in
fraction that gave the Huskies a
first down on the Card 20. Wash
ington scored from there in five
plays, with quarterback Bob Iliv

ner sneaking for the final 2 yards.
The conversion—not by Fleming
—missed again, and the Huskies
were back in front, 12-7.
It appeared now that maybe
Lady Luck would never get to
gether with the Tribe. For then,
started by a 16-yard gainer by
McMillen, the Cards drove to the
Washington 9, where Doug Dick's
fumble was recovered by Husky
Bill Kinnune. The running of Mc-
Millen and Dick and two Nicolet
to - Irv Nikolai passes propelled
this just-short drive.
Hopeful Anticipation
So ended the half, and it was
with hopeful anticipation that the
Stanford rooters sat as the third
quarter opened.
Immediately, good things hap
pened for the Tribe. On Washing
ton's second play after taking the
kick, Nicolet intercepted a Hivner
aerial on the 37 and returned to
the Husky 25. After an incom
plete pass and a 5-yard pop by
Dick, McMillen demonstrated he
had forgotten nothing during the
half time and sped 20 yards around
the right side for a touchdown.
Face was accurate again and the
Cards were ahead to stay; only
1':42 had elapsed.
McMillen, Again
The remainder of the third
quarter was taken up by a double
exchange of punts, the last of
w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole
again.
A Stanford offside penally and
two very short line plays got the
Huskies a few yards when, on
third-and-4, quarterback Phil Bor
ders was separated from the ball,
and center Roch Cotiklin pounced
on it at the 20. Doug Dick and
Jim Byrer got short yardage, and
then Nicolet hit—of all people—
McMillen for a 15-yard gain to the
1-yard line. At that point "Nick,"
really showing the colors of a true
Card quarterback, fired to John
Bond on a flare pattern for the
touchdown.
Two Points
Just to -show they could do ev
erything, the Indians lined up for
a two-point conversion, and Nico
let came through, striking to
Chris Burford for the final points.
With 13 minutes and 25 seconds
left, Washington was going to
have to do more than score a
touchdown and even a two-point
conversion.
In the statistical column, add
Nicolet's 15-for-29 passing mark
for 127 yards, and Dick's 48 clutch
rushing pickups to McMillen's big
rushing figure, and the result is
300 of the 378 Tribe total yards.
But if defensive performance
can be measured statistically,
compare the Huskies' 207 net
yards to the 267 they gained
against big, bad Ohio State the
previous week. No, it won't be
the last win.


HIM AGAIN —Junior halfback Kick McMillen is
on his way toward Stanford's first touchdown in
the second quarter of Saturday's game after get-

ting by Husky end Bruce ( laridge. McMillen
gained 185 yards in 26 carries for a 7.1-yards
per-carry game average.


40 YARDS —Pass interference is called on Stanford quarterback
Hick Norman as he takes Washington halfback Nicholl ont of con
tention while teammate Doug Dick reaches for the ball. The play
gave the Huskies 40 yards and sent them on their TD way.
It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk
lin, Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson,
Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni
kolai and Freis.
Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for

Then came the turning point of
the ball game. Others may place

on that one was 30-7, Owls.
However, this Stanford score
had been gained by two, not one,
beautiful drives, and the Tribes
men were finding s u c h drives
amazingly easy.
Bad Man Break rooted his ugly
head again immediately after the
next kickoff when Indians, either
Dick Norman or Doug Dick by
name, were whistled down for a
questionable pass interference in
fraction that gave the Huskies a
first down on the Card 20. Wash
ington scored from there in five
plays, with quarterback Bob Iliv

ner sneaking for the final 2 yards.
The conversion—not by Fleming
—missed again, and the Huskies
were back in front, 12-7.
It appeared now that maybe
Lady Luck would never get to
gether with the Tribe. For then,
started by a 16-yard gainer by
McMillen, the Cards drove to the
Washington 9, where Doug Dick's
fumble was recovered by Husky
Bill Kinnune. The running of Mc-
Millen and Dick and two Nicolet
to - Irv Nikolai passes propelled
this just-short drive.
Hopeful Anticipation
So ended the half, and it was
with hopeful anticipation that the
Stanford rooters sat as the third
quarter opened.
Immediately, good things hap
pened for the Tribe. On Washing
ton's second play after taking the
kick, Nicolet intercepted a Hivner
aerial on the 37 and returned to
the Husky 25. After an incom
plete pass and a 5-yard pop by
Dick, McMillen demonstrated he
had forgotten nothing during the
half time and sped 20 yards around
the right side for a touchdown.
Face was accurate again and the
Cards were ahead to stay; only
1':42 had elapsed.
McMillen, Again
The remainder of the third
quarter was taken up by a double
exchange of punts, the last of
w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole
again.
A Stanford offside penally and
two very short line plays got the
Huskies a few yards when, on
third-and-4, quarterback Phil Bor
ders was separated from the ball,
and center Roch Cotiklin pounced
on it at the 20. Doug Dick and
Jim Byrer got short yardage, and
then Nicolet hit—of all people—
McMillen for a 15-yard gain to the
1-yard line. At that point "Nick,"
really showing the colors of a true
Card quarterback, fired to John
Bond on a flare pattern for the
touchdown.
Two Points
Just to -show they could do ev
erything, the Indians lined up for
a two-point conversion, and Nico
let came through, striking to
Chris Burford for the final points.
With 13 minutes and 25 seconds
left, Washington was going to
have to do more than score a
touchdown and even a two-point
conversion.
In the statistical column, add
Nicolet's 15-for-29 passing mark
for 127 yards, and Dick's 48 clutch
rushing pickups to McMillen's big
rushing figure, and the result is
300 of the 378 Tribe total yards.
But if defensive performance
can be measured statistically,
compare the Huskies' 207 net
yards to the 267 they gained
against big, bad Ohio State the
previous week. No, it won't be
the last win.


HIM AGAIN —Junior halfback Kick McMillen is
on his way toward Stanford's first touchdown in
the second quarter of Saturday's game after get-

ting by Husky end Bruce ( laridge. McMillen
gained 185 yards in 26 carries for a 7.1-yards
per-carry game average.


40 YARDS —Pass interference is called on Stanford quarterback
Hick Norman as he takes Washington halfback Nicholl ont of con
tention while teammate Doug Dick reaches for the ball. The play
gave the Huskies 40 yards and sent them on their TD way.
It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk
lin, Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson,
Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni
kolai and Freis.
Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for

the first time this season at a one
point placement conversion try.
Then came the turning point of
the ball game. Others may place
this time-honored weekly incident
much later, but here, with barely
five minutes played, it began to
unfold.
Washington coach Jim Owens,
understandably thinking at this
point that things were indeed go
ing off as scheduled, inserted his
vsecond unit. Then things started
happening. Nicolet passed incom
plete, narrowly missing an inter
ception. This was followed by a
short pitchout to McMillen, who
tore around right end for 17
yards, a first down and an indica
tion of things to come.
Like Old Times
Then McMillen got one at cen
ter. Nicolet found Joel Freis for
11) yards and another first down.
McMillen packed the leather three
straight times — for 5, 4 and 9
yards—and yet another first down
. . . on the Husky 24. Things really
looked like old times when Nicolet
struck to John Bond for a 17-yard
gain to the Washington 7. On the
next play McMillen fumbled, Kirk
Wilson of Washington recovered
and the drive ended.
Rut, although disguised at the
time, the turning point had just
popped up, because this had been
by far the best Indian sustained
drive of the season 53 yards in
eight simple plays.
Forced to Punt
The Huskies fought their way
out to the 38 before Ihe Tribe
stiffened and forced them to punt.
Nicolet started the next drive with
a 9-yard toss to Bond. Gains by
Gil Dowd and McMillen moved the
Stanfords into Husky territory,
and I he now-rampaging Rick took
his favorite pitchout, this time
around the left side, and dashed
27 yards down to the 15.
After an incomplete pass, Mc-
Millen got 10 yards at left end to
narrowly miss a first down and
followed with 5 more at the same
place for a touchdown. Skip Face's
perfect conversion made it 7-G.
Not the First
This was not the first time the
Cards h;id led this season. Two

w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole
again.
A Stanford offside penally and
two very short line plays got the
Huskies a few yards when, on
third-and-4, quarterback Phil Bor
ders was separated from the ball,
and center Roch Cotiklin pounced
on it at the 20. Doug Dick and
Jim Byrer got short yardage, and
then Nicolet hit—of all people—
McMillen for a 15-yard gain to the
1-yard line. At that point "Nick,"
really showing the colors of a true
Card quarterback, fired to John
Bond on a flare pattern for the
touchdown.
Two Points
Just to -show they could do ev
erything, the Indians lined up for
a two-point conversion, and Nico
let came through, striking to
Chris Burford for the final points.
With 13 minutes and 25 seconds
left, Washington was going to
have to do more than score a
touchdown and even a two-point
conversion.
In the statistical column, add
Nicolet's 15-for-29 passing mark
for 127 yards, and Dick's 48 clutch
rushing pickups to McMillen's big
rushing figure, and the result is
300 of the 378 Tribe total yards.
But if defensive performance
can be measured statistically,
compare the Huskies' 207 net
yards to the 267 they gained
against big, bad Ohio State the
previous week. No, it won't be
the last win.


HIM AGAIN —Junior halfback Kick McMillen is
on his way toward Stanford's first touchdown in
the second quarter of Saturday's game after get-

gained 185 yards in 26 carries for a 7.1-yards
per-carry game average.


40 YARDS —Pass interference is called on Stanford quarterback

tention while teammate Doug Dick reaches for the ball. The play
gave the Huskies 40 yards and sent them on their TD way.
It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk
lin, Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson,
Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni
kolai and Freis.
Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for

Washington Huskies in the Stadium on Saturday.
the first time this season at a one
point placement conversion try.
Then came the turning point of
the ball game. Others may place
this time-honored weekly incident
much later, but here, with barely
five minutes played, it began to
unfold.
Washington coach Jim Owens,
understandably thinking at this
point that things were indeed go
ing off as scheduled, inserted his
vsecond unit. Then things started
happening. Nicolet passed incom
plete, narrowly missing an inter
ception. This was followed by a
short pitchout to McMillen, who
tore around right end for 17
yards, a first down and an indica
tion of things to come.
Like Old Times
Then McMillen got one at cen
ter. Nicolet found Joel Freis for
11) yards and another first down.
McMillen packed the leather three
straight times — for 5, 4 and 9
yards—and yet another first down
. . . on the Husky 24. Things really
looked like old times when Nicolet
struck to John Bond for a 17-yard
gain to the Washington 7. On the
next play McMillen fumbled, Kirk
Wilson of Washington recovered
and the drive ended.
Rut, although disguised at the
time, the turning point had just
popped up, because this had been
by far the best Indian sustained
drive of the season 53 yards in
eight simple plays.
Forced to Punt
The Huskies fought their way
out to the 38 before Ihe Tribe
stiffened and forced them to punt.
Nicolet started the next drive with
a 9-yard toss to Bond. Gains by
Gil Dowd and McMillen moved the
Stanfords into Husky territory,
and I he now-rampaging Rick took
his favorite pitchout, this time
around the left side, and dashed
27 yards down to the 15.
After an incomplete pass, Mc-
Millen got 10 yards at left end to
narrowly miss a first down and
followed with 5 more at the same
place for a touchdown. Skip Face's
perfect conversion made it 7-G.
Not the First
This was not the first time the
Cards h;id led this season. Two
weeks earlier they had held an
identical advantage by virtue of
Face's kick against Rice. The final
on that one was 30-7, Owls.
However, this Stanford score
had been gained by two, not one,
beautiful drives, and the Tribes
men were finding s u c h drives
amazingly easy.
Bad Man Break rooted his ugly
head again immediately after the
next kickoff when Indians, either
Dick Norman or Doug Dick by
name, were whistled down for a
questionable pass interference in
fraction that gave the Huskies a
first down on the Card 20. Wash
ington scored from there in five
plays, with quarterback Bob Iliv

ner sneaking for the final 2 yards.
The conversion—not by Fleming
—missed again, and the Huskies
were back in front, 12-7.
It appeared now that maybe
Lady Luck would never get to
gether with the Tribe. For then,
started by a 16-yard gainer by
McMillen, the Cards drove to the
Washington 9, where Doug Dick's
fumble was recovered by Husky
Bill Kinnune. The running of Mc-
Millen and Dick and two Nicolet
to - Irv Nikolai passes propelled
this just-short drive.
Hopeful Anticipation
So ended the half, and it was
with hopeful anticipation that the
Stanford rooters sat as the third
quarter opened.
Immediately, good things hap
pened for the Tribe. On Washing
ton's second play after taking the
kick, Nicolet intercepted a Hivner
aerial on the 37 and returned to
the Husky 25. After an incom
plete pass and a 5-yard pop by
Dick, McMillen demonstrated he
had forgotten nothing during the
half time and sped 20 yards around
the right side for a touchdown.
Face was accurate again and the
Cards were ahead to stay; only
1':42 had elapsed.
McMillen, Again
The remainder of the third
quarter was taken up by a double
exchange of punts, the last of
w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole

It took about eight minutes Sat
urday afternoon for the Stanford
Indians to realize that the bark of
the Washington Husky was indeed
more frightening than the bite—
and then the victory -s t a rv e d
Tribesmen proceeded to apply
their own lately-discovered bite to
the upstart Puppies and sent them
yelping home, victims of a sound
2212 lashing. This, in the journal
istic realm or otherwise, consti
tutes news.
News, because:
• It was Stanford's first victory
of the season and, moreover, its
first display of any offensive or
defensive might.
• It was the first victory of
Cactus Jack Cur t i c e's young
coaching reign on the Farm.
• It was a Washington team
which a week earlier had embar
rassed high-ranked Ohio State by
forcing 13 punts and losing by
only 12 to 7.
• And news because it was sup
posed to be merely an addition to
a growing line of lopsiders against
the Indians.
Junior halfback Rick McMillen,
who tore around and ran over
Huskies for an amazing 185 yards,
and senior quarterback Bob Nico
let, who turned in a performance
delightfully like those Stanford
has been used to getting from its
signal callers for the past few
years, showed their "teeth" most
to the invaders.
Team Effort
But it was truly a team effort.
McMillen got very able assistance
in his ground wars from Doug
Dick, and Nicolet had great re
ception on his passes from John
Bond, Irv Nikolai, Chris Burford,
Joel Freis—and, of course, Mc-
Millen.
In the line both ways everyone
stood out, stopping the fleet Hus
ky runners and executing near
perfect blocking to spring McMil
len loose time and time again. All
real heroes Saturday: Roch Conk
lin, Doug Pursell, Bob Peterson,
Russ Steele, Don Dawson, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee, Chris Plain.
Jim Ukropina, and Burford (who
logged 59 minutes of action), Ni
kolai and Freis.
Suffice to say that most of the
25,000 onlookers were astonished
by the amazingly effortless tri
umph—most all of them except
the players themselves, that is;
for they needed few "breaks" to
get their scores and were victims
of quite a few themselves.
Not the Last
But, above the joy of victory,
the most satisfying result of the
Saturday afternoon in the Stadi
um was: the Stanfords went home
with the comfortable feeling that
this win certainly would not be
the season's last.
The afternoon started off as if
no news at all was going to be
made. Stanford received the open
ing kickoff, gained 3 yards in
three plays and had to punt. The
Huskies, reputed to be only so-so
but very fast on offense, took the
ensuing punt and from their 46-
yard line had a touchdown in eight
plays. Don Nicholl scored it from
4 yards. With 4 minutes and 56
seconds gone, Washington led, 6-0.
Most encouraging thing for the
Tribe so far was the fact that
Husky George Fleming failed for

the first time this season at a one
point placement conversion try.
Then came the turning point of
the ball game. Others may place
this time-honored weekly incident
much later, but here, with barely
five minutes played, it began to
unfold.
Washington coach Jim Owens,
understandably thinking at this
point that things were indeed go
ing off as scheduled, inserted his
vsecond unit. Then things started
happening. Nicolet passed incom
plete, narrowly missing an inter
ception. This was followed by a
short pitchout to McMillen, who
tore around right end for 17
yards, a first down and an indica
tion of things to come.
Like Old Times
Then McMillen got one at cen
ter. Nicolet found Joel Freis for
11) yards and another first down.
McMillen packed the leather three
straight times — for 5, 4 and 9
yards—and yet another first down
. . . on the Husky 24. Things really
looked like old times when Nicolet
struck to John Bond for a 17-yard
gain to the Washington 7. On the
next play McMillen fumbled, Kirk
Wilson of Washington recovered
and the drive ended.
Rut, although disguised at the
time, the turning point had just
popped up, because this had been
by far the best Indian sustained
drive of the season 53 yards in
eight simple plays.
Forced to Punt
The Huskies fought their way
out to the 38 before Ihe Tribe
stiffened and forced them to punt.
Nicolet started the next drive with
a 9-yard toss to Bond. Gains by
Gil Dowd and McMillen moved the
Stanfords into Husky territory,
and I he now-rampaging Rick took
his favorite pitchout, this time
around the left side, and dashed
27 yards down to the 15.
After an incomplete pass, Mc-
Millen got 10 yards at left end to
narrowly miss a first down and
followed with 5 more at the same
place for a touchdown. Skip Face's
perfect conversion made it 7-G.
Not the First
This was not the first time the
Cards h;id led this season. Two
weeks earlier they had held an
identical advantage by virtue of
Face's kick against Rice. The final
on that one was 30-7, Owls.
However, this Stanford score
had been gained by two, not one,
beautiful drives, and the Tribes
men were finding s u c h drives
amazingly easy.
Bad Man Break rooted his ugly
head again immediately after the
next kickoff when Indians, either
Dick Norman or Doug Dick by
name, were whistled down for a
questionable pass interference in
fraction that gave the Huskies a
first down on the Card 20. Wash
ington scored from there in five
plays, with quarterback Bob Iliv

ner sneaking for the final 2 yards.
The conversion—not by Fleming
—missed again, and the Huskies
were back in front, 12-7.
It appeared now that maybe
Lady Luck would never get to
gether with the Tribe. For then,
started by a 16-yard gainer by
McMillen, the Cards drove to the
Washington 9, where Doug Dick's
fumble was recovered by Husky
Bill Kinnune. The running of Mc-
Millen and Dick and two Nicolet
to - Irv Nikolai passes propelled
this just-short drive.
Hopeful Anticipation
So ended the half, and it was
with hopeful anticipation that the
Stanford rooters sat as the third
quarter opened.
Immediately, good things hap
pened for the Tribe. On Washing
ton's second play after taking the
kick, Nicolet intercepted a Hivner
aerial on the 37 and returned to
the Husky 25. After an incom
plete pass and a 5-yard pop by
Dick, McMillen demonstrated he
had forgotten nothing during the
half time and sped 20 yards around
the right side for a touchdown.
Face was accurate again and the
Cards were ahead to stay; only
1':42 had elapsed.
McMillen, Again
The remainder of the third
quarter was taken up by a double
exchange of punts, the last of
w hi c h was a 49-yarder by. of
course, McMillen which bounded
out of bounds on the 11-yard line
and had the Huskies in a hole
again.
A Stanford offside penally and
two very short line plays got the
Huskies a few yards when, on
third-and-4, quarterback Phil Bor
ders was separated from the ball,
and center Roch Cotiklin pounced
on it at the 20. Doug Dick and
Jim Byrer got short yardage, and
then Nicolet hit—of all people—
McMillen for a 15-yard gain to the
1-yard line. At that point "Nick,"
really showing the colors of a true
Card quarterback, fired to John
Bond on a flare pattern for the
touchdown.
Two Points
Just to -show they could do ev
erything, the Indians lined up for
a two-point conversion, and Nico
let came through, striking to
Chris Burford for the final points.
With 13 minutes and 25 seconds
left, Washington was going to
have to do more than score a
touchdown and even a two-point
conversion.
In the statistical column, add
Nicolet's 15-for-29 passing mark
for 127 yards, and Dick's 48 clutch
rushing pickups to McMillen's big
rushing figure, and the result is
300 of the 378 Tribe total yards.
But if defensive performance
can be measured statistically,
compare the Huskies' 207 net
yards to the 267 they gained
against big, bad Ohio State the
previous week. No, it won't be
the last win.
