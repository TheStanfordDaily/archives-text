## Let's See the Axe 
### 
Vi i. wan TTO Sl-.K I Ik* A\K. Not hi necessary is tin* actual visibility
of tlic Ave, hut rather knowing that tangible evidence ol the
Stanford spirit exists. The Axe itself is of little material value,
hut the spirit it symbolizes is brought into the realm of reality
bv the Axe's existence. To have it locked in a vault, away from
view, is to virtuallv lock the spirit out of the minds of the students.
To be sure, the Axe is not the only bond ol Stanford pride and
tradition. (Saturday's football victory over Washington renews
the traditional faith of the University in its football team.) Ihe
Axe stands as a symbol of football supremacy, at least oxer (!al,
and it extends its powers throughout the University.
The Axe Society has realized that the Axe is a tie binding tlie
intangible Stanford spirit and is at present developing plans to
have the Axe placed on display. At I hursday nights Legislature
meeting, Axe Society president (.buck White presented tentative
plans to the Legislature. While difficulties are still being worked
out, the filial decision will rest with the Legislature and the stu
dents which the members of the Legislature represent, lor the
Legislature must appropriate the fuiid> with which to carry out
the plans.
After hearing the various plans of the Axe Society and the
additional proposals made by the Legislature, we advocate:
1. Placing the Axe in the lobby of the Library. While Hoover
Institution, as suggested, is more burglar-proof, the Library is
more centered on student activities. Ihe (.ellar facilities are too
limited for adequate display.
2. Not onlv a direct burglar alarm to local police, but also an
all-campus warning system. Ihe most feasible plan thus far pro
posed is to tie up the alarm to the air horn at the fire department.
There is additional cost for this, but we don t want to wake up
some morning to find the Axe missing: we want to be able to stop
any would-be (.aI heroes.
The work of the Axe Society is to be commended. But the Axe
is not only THEN? concern: it is the concern of the entire student
body, who must make their wishes known to their representatives.

limited for adequate display.
2. Not onlv a direct burglar alarm to local police, but also an
all-campus warning system. Ihe most feasible plan thus far pro
posed is to tie up the alarm to the air horn at the fire department.
There is additional cost for this, but we don t want to wake up
some morning to find the Axe missing: we want to be able to stop
any would-be (.aI heroes.
The work of the Axe Society is to be commended. But the Axe
is not only THEN? concern: it is the concern of the entire student
body, who must make their wishes known to their representatives.
Vi i. wan TTO Sl-.K I Ik* A\K. Not hi necessary is tin* actual visibility
of tlic Ave, hut rather knowing that tangible evidence ol the
Stanford spirit exists. The Axe itself is of little material value,
hut the spirit it symbolizes is brought into the realm of reality
bv the Axe's existence. To have it locked in a vault, away from
view, is to virtuallv lock the spirit out of the minds of the students.
To be sure, the Axe is not the only bond ol Stanford pride and
tradition. (Saturday's football victory over Washington renews
the traditional faith of the University in its football team.) Ihe
Axe stands as a symbol of football supremacy, at least oxer (!al,
and it extends its powers throughout the University.
The Axe Society has realized that the Axe is a tie binding tlie
intangible Stanford spirit and is at present developing plans to
have the Axe placed on display. At I hursday nights Legislature
meeting, Axe Society president (.buck White presented tentative
plans to the Legislature. While difficulties are still being worked
out, the filial decision will rest with the Legislature and the stu
dents which the members of the Legislature represent, lor the
Legislature must appropriate the fuiid> with which to carry out
the plans.
After hearing the various plans of the Axe Society and the
additional proposals made by the Legislature, we advocate:
1. Placing the Axe in the lobby of the Library. While Hoover
Institution, as suggested, is more burglar-proof, the Library is
more centered on student activities. Ihe (.ellar facilities are too
limited for adequate display.
2. Not onlv a direct burglar alarm to local police, but also an
all-campus warning system. Ihe most feasible plan thus far pro
posed is to tie up the alarm to the air horn at the fire department.
There is additional cost for this, but we don t want to wake up
some morning to find the Axe missing: we want to be able to stop
any would-be (.aI heroes.
The work of the Axe Society is to be commended. But the Axe
is not only THEN? concern: it is the concern of the entire student
body, who must make their wishes known to their representatives.
