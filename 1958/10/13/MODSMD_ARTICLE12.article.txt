# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## Admission Rough 
### 
It's becoming more and more
difficult to get into colleges and
universities these days. Stanford
has once again upped entrance re
quirements to insist that high
school students take at least three
units of the 15 college prepara
tion courses be taken in the sen
ior year.
The thought behind this is that
students tend to leave their sen
ior year free in order to have a
good time and the new require
ment will avoid a year's gap be
tween the junior year of studying
and the freshman year of college.
Even though high school study is
usually very unlike the demand
ing college course, chances are
good that a more serious and less
overwhelmed class of freshmen
will enter in 1960.
In the same vein, Jack Beach,
'35, chairman of the admissions
committee of the Alumni Asso
ciation, tries to explain to alum
ni why their offspring did not
make it to Stanford, in the Oc
tober issue of the Stanford Re
view.
As Beach points out, no one
likes to be told his child is stu
pid, even if he is, and alumni are
no exception. He points out that
while, of all applicants, more are
rejected than admitted, of all leg
achies (children of alumni) who
apply, more are admitted than
rejected. He concludes his article ■
by noting that few students who
apply are stupid, but many of
them, if thrown into a "rugged
competitive situation" before
they're ready, may never find
1 hemselves.
Where do the multitudes who,
must be turned away from Stan-;
ford go? In an article in Oct. 6 ;
Life magazine, Henry M. Wriston
former president of Lawrence
College and Brown University and
now head of the American As
sembly, an organization which
holds conferences on U.S. prob
lems, points out that too many
aim for the big name universities
(though Stanford is not men
tioned, the statement applies).
Wriston notes that schools such
as Occidental and Mills here on
the West Coast have had to hold
their enrollment open past the

usual June 1 deadline in older to
complete their registration.
The author advocates that
students look into the possibili
ties of the smaller but still aca
demically high schools, but he.
adds that universities must pre
pare themselves to take larger
numbers. In addition to fund
raising, which he admits most
are hard at work doing, Wris
ton suggests that they reduce
the number of courses offered.
He urges this cut in number on
the basis- that teaching time
and energy could be more ef
fectively distributed. He notes
that a public teachers college
lists more than 800 courses in
"education" alone.
This cutting of the number of
classes is also advocated quite
firmly by Mortimer Smith, one
of the founders of the Council for
Basic Education. Writing on
"How to Teach the California
Child" for the September Atlan
tic. Smith levels his attack chiefly
against the public high schools of
the state who offer such courses
as a home and family relations
course which includes a mock
wedding in which the students
play the roles of bride, groom,
minister, attendants, etc. He does
not ignore higher education, how
ever, as he mentions the case of
the college football player who
could not graduate with his class
because he could not pass a
course in movie appreciation.
Smith also notes ihe regulation
adopted by the California State
Board of Education in 1951: No
foreign language shall be re
quired by a state college as a
con d i t ion for graduation. Of
course, this caused difficulties
among language departments
which were then illegally requir
ing language for a degree iti lan
guages, so this year the restric
tion was modified for the individ
ual departments.
All this makes one wonder
what the college student of the
future will be studying. It ap
pears that his courses will all
concern how to get along wilh
his fellow citizens, with perhaps
a degree in "In • Law Relation
ships."

Board of Education in 1951: No
foreign language shall be re
quired by a state college as a
con d i t ion for graduation. Of
course, this caused difficulties
among language departments
which were then illegally requir

what the college student of the

his fellow citizens, with perhaps
a degree in "In • Law Relation

It's becoming more and more
difficult to get into colleges and
universities these days. Stanford
has once again upped entrance re
quirements to insist that high
school students take at least three
units of the 15 college prepara
tion courses be taken in the sen
ior year.
The thought behind this is that
students tend to leave their sen
ior year free in order to have a
good time and the new require
ment will avoid a year's gap be
tween the junior year of studying
and the freshman year of college.
Even though high school study is
usually very unlike the demand
ing college course, chances are
good that a more serious and less
overwhelmed class of freshmen
will enter in 1960.
In the same vein, Jack Beach,
'35, chairman of the admissions
committee of the Alumni Asso

ni why their offspring did not
make it to Stanford, in the Oc

view.
As Beach points out, no one
likes to be told his child is stu
pid, even if he is, and alumni are
no exception. He points out that
while, of all applicants, more are
rejected than admitted, of all leg
achies (children of alumni) who
apply, more are admitted than
rejected. He concludes his article ■
by noting that few students who
apply are stupid, but many of
them, if thrown into a "rugged
competitive situation" before
they're ready, may never find

Where do the multitudes who,
must be turned away from Stan-;

Life magazine, Henry M. Wriston
former president of Lawrence
College and Brown University and
now head of the American As
sembly, an organization which
holds conferences on U.S. prob
lems, points out that too many
aim for the big name universities
(though Stanford is not men
tioned, the statement applies).
Wriston notes that schools such
as Occidental and Mills here on
the West Coast have had to hold
their enrollment open past the

usual June 1 deadline in older to
complete their registration.
The author advocates that
students look into the possibili
ties of the smaller but still aca
demically high schools, but he.
adds that universities must pre
pare themselves to take larger
numbers. In addition to fund
raising, which he admits most
are hard at work doing, Wris
ton suggests that they reduce
the number of courses offered.
He urges this cut in number on
the basis- that teaching time
and energy could be more ef
fectively distributed. He notes
that a public teachers college
lists more than 800 courses in
"education" alone.
This cutting of the number of
classes is also advocated quite
firmly by Mortimer Smith, one
of the founders of the Council for
Basic Education. Writing on
"How to Teach the California
Child" for the September Atlan
tic. Smith levels his attack chiefly
against the public high schools of
the state who offer such courses
as a home and family relations
course which includes a mock
wedding in which the students
play the roles of bride, groom,
minister, attendants, etc. He does
not ignore higher education, how
ever, as he mentions the case of
the college football player who
could not graduate with his class
because he could not pass a
course in movie appreciation.

"How to Teach the California
Child" for the September Atlan
tic. Smith levels his attack chiefly
against the public high schools of
the state who offer such courses
as a home and family relations
course which includes a mock
wedding in which the students
play the roles of bride, groom,
minister, attendants, etc. He does
not ignore higher education, how
ever, as he mentions the case of
the college football player who
could not graduate with his class
because he could not pass a
course in movie appreciation.
Smith also notes ihe regulation
adopted by the California State
Board of Education in 1951: No
foreign language shall be re
quired by a state college as a
con d i t ion for graduation. Of
course, this caused difficulties
among language departments
which were then illegally requir
ing language for a degree iti lan
guages, so this year the restric
tion was modified for the individ
ual departments.
All this makes one wonder
what the college student of the
future will be studying. It ap
pears that his courses will all
concern how to get along wilh
his fellow citizens, with perhaps
a degree in "In • Law Relation
ships."
It's becoming more and more
difficult to get into colleges and
universities these days. Stanford
has once again upped entrance re
quirements to insist that high
school students take at least three
units of the 15 college prepara
tion courses be taken in the sen
ior year.
The thought behind this is that
students tend to leave their sen
ior year free in order to have a
good time and the new require
ment will avoid a year's gap be
tween the junior year of studying
and the freshman year of college.
Even though high school study is
usually very unlike the demand
ing college course, chances are
good that a more serious and less
overwhelmed class of freshmen
will enter in 1960.
In the same vein, Jack Beach,
'35, chairman of the admissions
committee of the Alumni Asso
ciation, tries to explain to alum
ni why their offspring did not
make it to Stanford, in the Oc
tober issue of the Stanford Re
view.
As Beach points out, no one
likes to be told his child is stu
pid, even if he is, and alumni are
no exception. He points out that
while, of all applicants, more are
rejected than admitted, of all leg
achies (children of alumni) who
apply, more are admitted than
rejected. He concludes his article ■
by noting that few students who
apply are stupid, but many of
them, if thrown into a "rugged
competitive situation" before
they're ready, may never find
1 hemselves.
Where do the multitudes who,
must be turned away from Stan-;
ford go? In an article in Oct. 6 ;
Life magazine, Henry M. Wriston
former president of Lawrence
College and Brown University and
now head of the American As
sembly, an organization which
holds conferences on U.S. prob
lems, points out that too many
aim for the big name universities
(though Stanford is not men
tioned, the statement applies).
Wriston notes that schools such
as Occidental and Mills here on
the West Coast have had to hold
their enrollment open past the

usual June 1 deadline in older to
complete their registration.
The author advocates that
students look into the possibili
ties of the smaller but still aca
demically high schools, but he.
adds that universities must pre
pare themselves to take larger
numbers. In addition to fund
raising, which he admits most
are hard at work doing, Wris
ton suggests that they reduce
the number of courses offered.
He urges this cut in number on
the basis- that teaching time
and energy could be more ef
fectively distributed. He notes
that a public teachers college
lists more than 800 courses in
"education" alone.
This cutting of the number of
classes is also advocated quite
firmly by Mortimer Smith, one
of the founders of the Council for
Basic Education. Writing on
"How to Teach the California
Child" for the September Atlan
tic. Smith levels his attack chiefly
against the public high schools of
the state who offer such courses
as a home and family relations
course which includes a mock
