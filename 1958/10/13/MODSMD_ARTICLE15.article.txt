SAE's Not First'
Editor, The Daily:
In last Friday's Daily, it was
stated in the editorial column thai
the SAE fraternity had recorded
a campus "first" by substituting
a socalled "Help Week" for the
more traditional "Hell Week."
Now certainly we old grads can
not expect the Daily staff to re
call every news event since the
days of the legendary Warren
Wonka, so when a slip-up occurs,
it is obviously our responsibility
to direct the attention of the pres
ent Daily staff to this error. I
therefore refer you to the Oaily
of Oct. 12, 1953. The front page
of this issue contained two large
pictures, side by side. One depicts
pledges of the AKL fraternity
zealously painting the boat house,
while the other portrays x a
masked pledge from another fra
ternity chained to a fireplug. The
captions (for which the editor
later apologized) beneath the two
pictures were respectively headed
"These Pledges Helped" and
"This Pledge Couldn't." An ar
ticle accompanying the pictures
explained that Ihe AKL frater
nity. forgoing the usual "Hell
Week." had embarked upon a

''Help Week" instead, the final re
sult of which is, I presume, 1 ho
most recent coat of paint the
Boathouse has seen. The pictures,
sans captions, were later reprint
ed in the December, 1953, issue
of the Stanford Review.
The idea, apparently, did not
catch on.
