# Wallace in Form
## 
### 
"About as expected," was the
reaction of Pay ton Jordan to Fri
day's first competitive showing of
his 1958 Stanford cross-country
forces.
Keith Wallace ran to a narrow
victory over the Stan
ford golf course route as the In
dians garnered four of the first
10 places in a non-scoring meet
involving San Jose State, San
Jose City College, Sacramento
State, Santa Clara Valley Youth
Village and Palo Alio High
School.
Wallace picked up where he
left off last fall when, as a fresh
man, he was top man on the
Stanford seven. But for the most
part, the Cards showed that
they'll need plenty of work be
fore the PCC opener in two
weeks.
Jordan said (he realized most
of his team weren't in shape, but
that ihe meet was good in that
11 let everyone know just what
work is cut out for him.
Wallace and George Linn of
Palo Alto battled through the ear
ly stages of the race, but then

Will King of the Youth Village,
formerly of Stanford, moved up
on the leaders. He took the lead
with about a mile to go, but Wal
lace quickly moved ahead again
and widened his final margin to
five seconds.
