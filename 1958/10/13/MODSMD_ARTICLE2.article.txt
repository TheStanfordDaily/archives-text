# SINCE OCT. 1
## Stanford Libes Inaugurate Industry Exchange Plan 
### 
A system for aiding local industries when they use the University
Libraries has been functioning well since Oct. 1, according to George
Vedovin, director of the new Technical Information Service.
In the past, local industry purchased a "special" library card for
$10. They then used the library just as any other card holder.

Under the new system, to which
almost all of the major industries
in the area have subscribed, the
University furnishes photostats
of the requested material. Thus
the danger of congestion, with
students, faculty and industry all
clamoring for the same volume,
is avoided.
The members of the Service are
also members of Stanford Indus
trial Library Associates, which
wili channel subscriber requests
for specific library purchases and
other suggestions to the Univer
sity Libraries.
Each industry pays the Univer
sity a "fairly healthy fee," accord
ing to Vedovin. Out of this de
posit, each firm will be charged
for each purchase.
Credits will be allowed each
time the University Libraries bor
row a technical report, govern
ment contract research report, or
similar item from a subscriber.
Many of the local industries have
their own libraries, housing tech
nical journals to which the Uni
versity does not subscribe.
Each subscribing industry will
be issued regular cards for its
personnel, at no additional
charge.
