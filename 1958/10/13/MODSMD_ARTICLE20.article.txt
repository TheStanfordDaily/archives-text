# This Week They Worked
## 
### John Anderson 
The offensive and defensive
strategy which worked so suc
cessfully against Washington was
basically the same as in the three
previous games this quarter only
this time things just clicked.
"We added a few new wrin
kles," said Indian Coach Curtice
in the locker room following the
Cards' 2212 victory over the litis

kies Saturday. "The kids seem to
be catching on now."
Apparently the only worry that
Curtice had after the game,
which he described as the "nicest
win of tlie year," was the condi
tion of fullback Gil Dowd. The
standout sophomore will be out
for ;t minimum of three weeks
wilti a toin ligament in the knee.
The coach said he didn't know

at the prerent who would replace
Dowd.
"Today's game was a fine ex
ample of why athletics are worth
while," Curtice stated. "Stanford
was a team that had absorbed
three tough loses, but the kids
worked hard and this paid off."
In answer to questions concern
ing the why and wherefore of
Stanford's outstanding offensive
and defensive game, the coach
said that "Washington played as
we expected; their offense had
no surprises and we had them
well defeased.
"We expected them to use the
same defense as they used against
Ohio State. This is just what
Washington did." Hut the six
Husky defensive patterns which
forced the Buckeyes to punt K5
times couldn't stop the Stanford
pitch-out which Rick McMillen
took for an average carry of 7.1
yards.
"We could have run that play
all day," smiled Curtice.
"This was a team victory," said
the Stanford head mentor, hesi
tating from singling out individ
ual players. However, he did com
ment on the fine 59-mimite effort
of end Chris Burford and the
blocking of John Bond which
made the pitch-out so effective.

The coach said he didn't know

at the prerent who would replace
Dowd.
"Today's game was a fine ex
ample of why athletics are worth
while," Curtice stated. "Stanford
was a team that had absorbed
three tough loses, but the kids
worked hard and this paid off."
In answer to questions concern
ing the why and wherefore of
Stanford's outstanding offensive
and defensive game, the coach
said that "Washington played as
we expected; their offense had
no surprises and we had them
well defeased.
"We expected them to use the
same defense as they used against
Ohio State. This is just what
Washington did." Hut the six
Husky defensive patterns which
forced the Buckeyes to punt K5
times couldn't stop the Stanford
pitch-out which Rick McMillen
took for an average carry of 7.1
yards.
"We could have run that play
all day," smiled Curtice.
"This was a team victory," said
the Stanford head mentor, hesi
tating from singling out individ
ual players. However, he did com
ment on the fine 59-mimite effort
of end Chris Burford and the
blocking of John Bond which
made the pitch-out so effective.
