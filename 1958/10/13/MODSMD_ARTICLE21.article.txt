## Washington Didn't Have Enough Snap or Drive 
### Ron Rapoport 
"Good teams don't let down
from one week to the next, and
today we just were not a good
team."
Such were the after-game mus
ings of Washington Coach Jiin
Owens in the visitors' dressing
room after Saturday's game
where he watched his Huskies
outplayed and outscored by an
underdog Stanford Indian squad.
"We just didn't have the drive
or the snap we had in our other
games. Sure the loss of Carr hurt
us |Luther Carr, the Huskies' top
halfback, who was out with a
knee injury], but he wouldn't;
have made any difference in the i
score." Carr will return to the
lineup next week when Washing-1
ton tackles UCLA.
In trying to compare the poor
showing Washington made
against the Cards with their near
upset of nationally ranked Ohio
State last weekend, Owens said
that his team had shown 10 times
more desire to win in Ihe Ohio
State game than they had shown
against Stanford.
Owens had nothing but praise
for the amazing running of Rick
McMillen and the inspired quar
terbacking of Bob Nicolet.

I "We didn't think they'd run the
! ends so much. They really have
| put tin 1 pieces together. They're
bound to improve more as time
goes on."
Owens complained of poor exe
cution of Husky plays and of lack
of help from the secondary unit.
He did single out Kurt'Gegner
and Don Armstrong for' having
I turned in a good game defensive
ly.
Commenting on the free-for-all
PCC title race, Owens said that it
is wide open and that anyone
could win. As for his own
chances, he didn't concede to any
one.
"We've got as good a chance as
anyone," he said.
