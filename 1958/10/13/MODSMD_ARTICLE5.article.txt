# Sextet Offers Unique Styling

The unique stylings of Allyn
Ferguson's Chamber Jazz Sextet
were enthusiastically received by
a small but appreciative audience
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium Sun
day afternoon.
The sextet's performance was
versatile both in tempo and mood.
Selections ranged from a recog
nizable "Bewitched, Bothered and
Bewildered" to a way-out "You
Stepped Out of a Dream."
In addition to adapting pop
songs, the group spotlighted a
number of original arrange
ments. These were especially in
teresting for their oriental styl
ing, bass harmonies and "lopsided
rhythm."
Allyn Ferguson, leader of the
sophisticated ensemble, displayed
a fine "touch and timing on the
piano. Robert Envoldsen, on the
trumpet, also stood out for his
expert musicianship.
The only detraction from a fine
performance was a too-heavy de
pendence on the drums which
tended, at times, to be overpow
ering.
