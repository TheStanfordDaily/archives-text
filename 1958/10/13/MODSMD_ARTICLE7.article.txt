WASHINGTON (/Pj- America's shoot-for-the-moon missile plum
meted back toward earth and almost certain destruction Sunday
after a record-shattering 78,720-mile surge into space.
U.S. scientists forecast that the U.S. Air Force missile, named Pio
neer, will re-enter the earth's atmosphere at 10 a.m. PST today and
will immediately burn up.
So will end, in a blaze of only partly frustrated triumph, mankind's
most ambitious attempt thus far to explore the universe—a scientific
achievement that won praise from President Eisenhower and from
scientists in many parts of the world.
The U.S. scienifie autopsy, given in a news conference at the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, reported two main things wrong with
the effort to send the 85-pound instrument carier within TV range
of the moon:
1. Pioneer didn't have quite the enormous rocket push needed to
make the journey of more than 200,000 miles to the moon. The moon
missile was supposed to develop a speed of 35,250 feet per second
after launching from Cape Canaveral, Fla., early Saturday. Dr. Louis
G. Dunn, president of the Space Technological Laboratories, said it
looked as if the space craft didn't hit more than 34,400.

2. The projectile went a bit off
course. Brig. Gen. O. J. Ritland,
vice-commander of the Air Force
ballistic missile division, said Pio
neer- a "lunar probe" is what the
scientists call it deviated "above
the planned trajectory"—that is,
didn't quite follow its flight plan.
Another expert said the missile
began its bullet-like course 3Vj de
grees higher than expected.
There had been earlier specula
tion that Pioneer might orbit
around the earth after failing to
become the first moon satellite.
Fed Back Data
Nonetheless Pioneer fed back
by radio a considerable amount of
data vastly beyond the reach of
other measuring devices. In so
doing it undoubtedly brought
nearer the day when man may
venture into space.
Pioneer was blasted aloft in a
three-stage Thor-Able rocket at
6:42 a.m. PST Saturday.
It was a magnificently success
ful launching, from the stand
point of getting an object into
space, but the takeoff angle
proved a few degrees off and Pio
neer — thrusting ahead at 25,000
miles per hour at first — veered
away from the moon's gravity
pull.
80,000-Mile Climb
Instead the instrument car
riage, shaped like a child's top,
began to circle back toward earth
—but not before approaching a
height of 80,000 miles, 30 times
farther into space than man had
ever plumbed.
British scientists were inclined
to credit Pioneer with achieving
an even greater height.
Prof. A. C. Lovell of the Jodrell
Bank radio telescope in England
said it could be between 110,000
and 150,000 miles out.
If all had gone well Pioneer
would have come within 50,000
miles or less of the moon, and its
built-in "slow down" rocket would
have been fired some time Mon
day in the hope that the lunar
probe would become a moon sat
ellite.
Temperature changes resulting
from the missile's taking an un
expected course affected the tem
perature inside the device and the
batteries which could have set off
the standby rocket failed to work.
Another such foulup frustrated
one of the scientists' more cher
ished dreams — getting pictures,
however crude, of the moon at
relatively closc range and espe
cially of the dark side which has
never been seen by man.

around the earth after failing to
become the first moon satellite.
Fed Back Data
Nonetheless Pioneer fed back
by radio a considerable amount of
data vastly beyond the reach of
other measuring devices. In so
doing it undoubtedly brought
nearer the day when man may
venture into space.
Pioneer was blasted aloft in a
three-stage Thor-Able rocket at
6:42 a.m. PST Saturday.
It was a magnificently success
ful launching, from the stand
point of getting an object into
space, but the takeoff angle
proved a few degrees off and Pio
neer — thrusting ahead at 25,000
miles per hour at first — veered
away from the moon's gravity
pull.
80,000-Mile Climb
Instead the instrument car
riage, shaped like a child's top,
began to circle back toward earth
—but not before approaching a
height of 80,000 miles, 30 times
farther into space than man had
ever plumbed.
British scientists were inclined
to credit Pioneer with achieving
an even greater height.
Prof. A. C. Lovell of the Jodrell
Bank radio telescope in England
said it could be between 110,000
and 150,000 miles out.
If all had gone well Pioneer
would have come within 50,000
miles or less of the moon, and its
built-in "slow down" rocket would
have been fired some time Mon
day in the hope that the lunar
probe would become a moon sat
ellite.
Temperature changes resulting
from the missile's taking an un
expected course affected the tem
perature inside the device and the
batteries which could have set off
the standby rocket failed to work.
Another such foulup frustrated
one of the scientists' more cher
ished dreams — getting pictures,
however crude, of the moon at
relatively closc range and espe
cially of the dark side which has
never been seen by man.
WASHINGTON (/Pj- America's shoot-for-the-moon missile plum
meted back toward earth and almost certain destruction Sunday
after a record-shattering 78,720-mile surge into space.
U.S. scientists forecast that the U.S. Air Force missile, named Pio
neer, will re-enter the earth's atmosphere at 10 a.m. PST today and
will immediately burn up.
So will end, in a blaze of only partly frustrated triumph, mankind's
most ambitious attempt thus far to explore the universe—a scientific
achievement that won praise from President Eisenhower and from
scientists in many parts of the world.
The U.S. scienifie autopsy, given in a news conference at the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, reported two main things wrong with
the effort to send the 85-pound instrument carier within TV range
of the moon:
1. Pioneer didn't have quite the enormous rocket push needed to
make the journey of more than 200,000 miles to the moon. The moon
missile was supposed to develop a speed of 35,250 feet per second
after launching from Cape Canaveral, Fla., early Saturday. Dr. Louis
G. Dunn, president of the Space Technological Laboratories, said it
looked as if the space craft didn't hit more than 34,400.

2. The projectile went a bit off
course. Brig. Gen. O. J. Ritland,
vice-commander of the Air Force
ballistic missile division, said Pio
neer- a "lunar probe" is what the
scientists call it deviated "above
the planned trajectory"—that is,
didn't quite follow its flight plan.
Another expert said the missile
began its bullet-like course 3Vj de
grees higher than expected.
