# Mem Court Pillars Sliced, Reinforced
## 
### Mary Lou McKinley 
When Memorial Court was
originally built, according to a
picture in the Planning Office,
the supports used then were simi
lar to those seen in the Court
today. The present supports were
put up last winter to overhaul the
Court's weakening arcades.
This remodeling has involved
the removal of the roof above the
walkways, substituting steel
beams for the old wooden ones,
and putting on all new tile, as
well as disecting eight of the sand
stone pillars.
Stones Mapped
The pillars themselves were
sliced in half, then quartered, and
hollowed out slightly to accomo
date a steel "I" beam. These
beams within the pillars meet a
larger beam placed across the
top of the walkway from side to
side, and arc further connected
across the bottom by means of
a concrete "path." To hold this
concrete, portions of the walk
had to be removed and a trench
dug across the walkway from
each of the four pillars to the
opposite ones.
The stones and pillars then
wore eemcntcd back together and
the walk replaced. Construction
on the left arcade has been fin
ished. but work still is being done
on the right, wilh completion and
return to normalcy expected by
December 16.

Both sides of the arcade were
shored up during last year's
rainy season with heavy bridge
timbers, in preparation for con
struction. Work began in June
under the firm of Wagner and
Martinez.
Continuing the program of
modernizing the quad, three class
room buildings were remodeled
over the summer and Encina Hall
also was given a new lift.
Double-Decking
Two Mathematics buildings and
the Classics department were
completely renovated, with new
lighting, heating, and ventilating
systems installed, as well as the
addition of second floors to each.
The Campus' traditional architec
ture of red-titled, high-peaked
roofs lends itself especially well
to this double-decking with room
even for a third floor if the Uni
versity should expand more.
Funds for this remodeling,
which cost $450,000, came from a
Ford Foundation "accomplish
ment grant," awarded to certain
universities in recognition of pro
gress in raising faculty salaries.
