## Remodeled Encina Will Be Ready in September 
### 
The complete overhaul of Encina, begun this summer, will prob
ably be completed in September, 1959, at a cost of $1,350,000. Four
floors in the central section will be redone, and an elevator will be
Installed, according to Alf E. Brandin, University business manager.
The wings are to be left for future remodeling at an additional

estimated cost of $1,800,000. In
the meantime, they will be used
for storage or emergency hous
ing.
Encina was built in 1891 to co
incide with the opening of the
University. At first it was used
as the dormitory for all campus
men, then, as the student body
grew and other residence halls
were built, it became the home
of freshmen men.
Before the last of Encina fresh
men moved out on January 3,
1956, to take up quarters in Wil
bur, most of the main floor and
basement had been taken over by
such administrative functions as
personnel, controller, and busi
ness offices. These will remain
in the remodeled structure.
Following renovation, academic
space on the Inner and Outer
Quads will be made available
when the General Secretary's
offices, the Planning Office, the
Placement Service, the News and
Publications Service, and the Food
Research Institution move to
Encina.
Gaining the vacated quad space
will be the Geography and
Asiatic and Slavic Studies dept
ments, now in temporary build
ings. The Navel ROTC detach
ment, now in the Education
Building, will move to Encina and
its space in Cubberley will be
taken by the Psychology Depart
ment.
Though the cost for preserving
Encina will approach new con
struction cost, sentimental attach
ments for Encina and its strategic
location on campus were factors
in the decision to remodel it.
