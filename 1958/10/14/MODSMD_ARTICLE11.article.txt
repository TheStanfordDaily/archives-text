# Atom Reactor To Be Installed
## 
### 
A grant of $150,000 from the
Atomic Energy Commission will
finance installation of a 10-kilo
watt teaching reactor for nuclear
engineering studies, according to
Dean-elect Joseph M. Petti t of the
School of Engineering.
In addition, $25,000 has been
given by the C. F. Braun Trust
of Alhambra for housing the re
actor and its related facilities.
Stanford's reactor will be either
ihe "swimming pool" type or
some similar water-moderated
model. Dean Pettit said. It will
be part of the Nuclear Technology
Laboratory located in the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory build
ing.
Among other equipment, the
laboratory already has a sub
critical nuclear assembly fueled
with $80,000 worth of uranium
loaned by the A EC. This device
does not sustain a nuclear chain
reaction, however.
