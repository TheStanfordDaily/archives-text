# Pope Buried In St. Peter's
## 
### 
VATICAN CITY (/P)â€”With awe
some ceremony, the Roman Cath
olic church yesterday committed
Pope Pius XII to eternal rest near
the tomb of St. Peter, in the laby
rinthine grottoes of St. Peter's
Basilica.
This location, selected by the
cardinals, was a sign of their vast
esteem for Pius XII.
The decision to place Pope Pius
near the burial place of St. Peter
was a quick one. Earlier it had
been expected that the pope would
be placed near the original burial
place of Pope Pius X, whose saint
hood he had proclaimed in 1954.
Pius XII had expressed a desire
to be buried in that place.
The bells of St. Peter tolled as
the few thousand people who had
witnessed the burial of the 261st
pope slowly left the basilica.
All but two of 55 Catholic cardi
nals probably will participate in
the conclave to elect a new pope.
