# Failure Prompts New Try To Go Round the Moon
## May Send Man Soon 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) U.S. Air
Force scientists speeded work on
a new 'round • the - moon project
Monday within hours after moon
rocket No. 1 fell short and plung
ed to flaming destruction.
Unofficial word from tlie Capo
Canaveral, Fla., launching silo
was that the new try would bo
made between Nov. 8 and 11 the
next dates when the moon will In
closest to the earth in its 28-day
orbit.
They were talking, too, in terms
of sending human beings out into
space—a possibility less remole
than before in view of radioed
data from the short-lived Pioneer
indicating that radiation danger
decreases as a missile forces far
ther and farther into space.
Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever,
chief of the Air Force Ballistic
Missile Division, said this new in
formation "will be of great assist
ance in improving instruments for
future space and lunar probes and
for putting man into space."
Pioneer, man's first moon-bound
missile to crack through earth's
atmosphere, soared to an unheard
of 79,120 miles before plunging
back to unobserved disintegration
over the South Pacific early Mon
day.
Renewed Confidence
This space - pioneering venture
did not disappoint scientists, even
though it groped only a third of
the distance to the moon. It re
inforced their confidence thai
they can "shoot the moon" and
eventually reach the planets and
even the center of the solar sys
tem, the sun.
The Air Force has one more
chance, in the immediate future,
to try putting a flying laboratory
like Pioneer in the vicinity of the
moon. It has been assigned three
such lunar probe shots. The first
attempt failed Aug. 17 when the
rocket exploded 77 seconds after
take-off. The partially successful
Pioneer was the second attempt.
More Speed
Whichever service "hits" the
moon first, it will have to hurtle
its rocket aloft just a bit but a
do-or-die bit — faster than Pio
neer's formidable speed.
One of the country's leading as
tronomers, Dr. I. M. Levitt, direc
tor of Philadelphia's Fels Plane
tarium, said Monday that Pioneer
was sent off at a speed of 34,400
feet a second. This was 850 feet a
second short of the velocity need
ed to shoot it out of the earth's
main gravitational pull, he said.
Other scientists said the mis
sile's speed was reduced because
it climbed at an angle slightly
steeper than the planned one.
In any case, Pioneer didn't quite
make it, and the efforts of scien
tists on the ground to slow its
fall—and thus give it a chance to
orbit around the earth were un
successful.
The explanation was prosaic:
Pioneer's batteries were too cold
to respond to signals from earth.
