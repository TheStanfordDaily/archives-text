Running down a hill to catch
a train at 5 a.m. lugging suitcases
is not much fun; but when Paris
is waiting al the end of the trip,
the complaints are few.
A hearty group of 17 left Lund
gut Burg the day after the open
ing ceremonies to spend five days
in the French capital. School did
not begin until the following Mon
day. so most of us took advantage
of the free time to get our first
look at Europe. We scattered to
Brussels, Paris, Zurich and many
parts of Deutschland itself.
It was with a sigh of relief that
Prof. Strothmann saw the last of
the students come up the hill ear
ly Monday morning, and we all
prepared for a quarter of study
and fun.
Exploration
After a few days, we got settled
in our rooms and dug in for the
six months ahead. Also there was
much exploration of the Burg and
the surrounding area, one of the
main objects being to spot cherry
and apple trees which would later
lie open to invasion.
Four days a week were devoted
to classes last quarter, with four
hours each day being spent in the
classroom. Every student took
two hours of German a day, part
of that time for grammar and
part for conversation, except for
the advanced class which was all
conversation.
We also have the opportunity
to learn German with the Beutels
bachers, with people we have
met, and by using as much
Deutsch as possible among our
selves. The only difficulty about
speaking to the people here is
that they speak Swabisch, a dia
lect of German which nobody but
the Swabs can understand. Usu-'
ally they use hoch Deutsch to
speak to us, but occasionally a
few Swabisch words manage to
sneak in.
More Sales
We have gotten along quite
well with the people of Beutels
bach. Our arrival has boosted
their towel, notebook, stationery
and pastry business. The volume
of mail at the post office has in
creased severalfold, due to the
prolific writers on the Burg.
But more important than this i
are the numerous friendships we j
have made with the townspeople, j
We have become an accepted part j
of their community, and they are j
as eager to meet us as we are to [
meet them. Some of us have been j
invited into their homes or have

talked with them in Gasthauser
I (restaurants). A large number of
| them have come to the Burg for
| parties, on Sunday afternoon
walks or on per sonal invitation.
Several days after school start
ed, the people of Beutelsbach
! treated us to a tour of the town.
!We were inter ested to see two
: beautiful new churches, a good
j school and many houses with
modern conveniences in such a
small town. The main pride of
I the villagers is a new co-operative
wine cellar which presses the
! grapes brought in from the sur
j rounding vineyards and makes
; wine for which this area is noted.
Tables Spread
We were all treated to samples
of the various wines made in the
cellar, and then the big surprise
was sprung. In die Krone, the
Rossotti's of Beutelsbach, the
tables were bulging with delicious
sandwiches, a 15-piece band was
i playing, and an infinite number'
of wine bottles was awaiting us.
One of the Stanford women.
Nancy Marik, asked the band
leader if she might lead the band.
Much to the amazement of the
villagers and the band, she did as
well as their leader.
Several hours and hundreds of
songs later, we left for the Burg
having made many new friends
and feeling that we had been ac
cepted as Beutelsbachers.
However, our acquaintance
with German people has extended
much further than this one vil
lage. Through the work of the
Stanford Club in Stuttgart, many
people have heard about the
school and have sent invitations
to the students ranging from one
or two days at their homes to
spending Christmas with them. In
fact, one committee here, headed
by Edith Pascoe, does nothing but
arrange those invitations, of
which there are hundreds, and
try to match interests with those
of the students.
Eager Exchange
It has really been surprising to
us how eager 1 the people are to
have us visit them, and how easy
it has been to make friends. One
major difficulty, of course, was
the difference in language, but
that is being remedied as we be
come better able to express our
selves in German and to under
stand it.
The conversations we've had
with the people here have en
| abled us to under stand Germany
j much better and them to learn a
| little more about America than
[ what they read in the papers.
These contacts with Germans
i form one of the most important
j parts of our being here, and we
are in agreement that it has been
! as greatly successful as the rest
i of the program.
