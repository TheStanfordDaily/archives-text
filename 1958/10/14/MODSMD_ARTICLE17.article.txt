In the "llow-Far-Can-This-Go"
Department, the University Daily
Kansan reports that a noted psy
chiatrist has recently said that
automobiles are sex symbols.
First it was women, then certain
magazines, now it's cars. "Can
you imagine the candy store cam
pus wolves going into ecstasy at
the sight of a sex symbol potently
zooming by with her top down,
gaily decorated in red and her
tail fins provocatively vibrating?"
Jeeesh!
At the U. of Connecticut stu
dents are worrying about their
Union Snack Bar being too well
lit. They want "closed curtains
and wine bottle candle holders"
yet! And here we'd just be satis
fied to have a Place, any Place,
which would have good coffee
(expresso, too, should be added)
that would be open until a reason
able hour!
We hear so much about to
day's intellectual college stu
dents, always' keeping their
noses to the grindstone, not con
cerning themselves with frivo
lous pleasures. Ila! A recent
highlight on the Duke Univer
sity campus was- a Hula-hoop
Contest. "Coeds are beginning
to swing in public/' the Duke
Chronicle reports. The paper
also gives a prediction that
"The Return of the Boomer
ang" is next. .FUST what we
need.
One city reaching from Tijuana
to Santa Barbara. That's the pre
diction of a recent UCLA Bureau
of Governmental Research sur
vey, which reports that only ihe
Camp Pendleton area in San

, Diego County and the Irvine and
other ranch holdings in Orange
County are impeding the joining
of the Los Angeles-Orange Coun
ty metropolitan area with thai
of San Diego. Some people have
BIG ideas.
Did you know that the Stan
ford freshman ratio is 168.')
men to every woman? So says
the Oregon Daily Emerald,
quoting our Daily's article on
the Jolly-up and omitting just
one little dot. (Actual ratio â€”
1.685 to 1.) With such a ratio
we would have one-half a wom
an in our entire enrollment!
And the Stanford men think
things are bad now?
We note that one of the serv
ice stations near the campus ol
I Our Neighbor to the North has
I advertised 100 free gallons of gas
oline for guessing the right game
score each Saturday. If all Cal
students are optimists, the sta
tion appears not to have too much
cause for worry.
More than $3 million was spent
this summer at USC in housing
facilities, which include two worn
en's dorms, one men's dorm and
one men's dorm addition. Fea
tures include Danish modern fur
niture, "abundant storage space,"
| etc., etc. But before you all gr
; running to transfer, you might be
interested in a recent Daily Tro
jan headline: "Probation Lists
Hit Record High; Registrar Says
j Spring Failures Up 100 Per Cent.'
I Probation status exists for all
j sludents with grade averages un
! rler 2, and last June the number
hit 18(i3.
