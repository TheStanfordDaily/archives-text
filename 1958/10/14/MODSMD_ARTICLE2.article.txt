## De Gaulle: Army Out Of Politics 
### 
PARIS (/P) Premier Charles cle
Gaulle has ordered the French
Army to withdraw immediately
from political action in Algeria
and to clear the way for free elec
tions there Nov. 23.
It was de Ga u 1 1 e's sternest
crackdown on officers who former!
a Committee of Public Safety aft
er the politico-military revolt of
May 13 in Algiers. The committee
raised a cry for de Gaulle's return
to power which led the way for
him to take. Now fie Gaulle stern
ly wrote to the French command
er for Algeria, Gen. Raoul Salan:
Moment Has Come
"The moment has come . . . for
the military to stop taking part in
any organization which has a po
litical character whatever may
be the reasons which, under the
exceptional circumstances which
swept Algeria since the month of
May, motivate their participation.
Nothing will henceforth justify
their belonging to such organiza
tions. I order them to withdraw
without delay."
De Gaulle told General Salan
further that he insists on having
free elections for all persons liv
ing in Algeria, whatever their
views may be.
"The only persons excluded will
be those who participate in ter
rorism and, because of this fact,
are liable to prosecution," he said.
Political Elite
"The objective to be achieved is
the discovery, freely obtained, of
an Algerian political elite," de
Gaulle went on. "In this manner
the void which has opened the
way for the leaders of the rebel
lion may be filled."
Voting in Algeria is to be con
ducted through party lists, de
Gaulle said, to guarantee a two
thirds majority of Algerians. In
France balloting will be for indi
viduals rather than parties, as in
the past.
"The best interests of the coun
try demand that the consultation
take place under conditions of ab
solute freedom and sincerity," de
Gaulle told Salan, "and that lists
representative of all tendenciesâ€”
I say, all tendencies- be allowed
concurrently and equally to solicit
the suffrage of the electorate."
Competition Important
Asserting he attached extreme
importance to a real competition,
rle Gaulle said the "worst danger
would be the formation of lists
solely favored by the official au
thority."
That statement may have been
aimed at the conduct of the Sept.
28 referendum on the new consti
tution for the Fifth Republic.
Algeria gave de Gaulle an over
whelming victory, but. foreign
newsmen noted that Algerian vot
ers in many cases were taken to
polling places by the Army and
that the Army's psychological
warfare branch had campaigned
for a yes vote.
De Gaulle's orders to Salan also
said there was to be no seizure
of newspapers unless articles in
volved were subject to criminal
action.
