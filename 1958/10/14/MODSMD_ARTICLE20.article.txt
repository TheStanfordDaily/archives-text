# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Shouldn't Count Chickens 
### 
According to Gen. Laurence
Kuter, speaking in an interview
at Tokyo where he is Air Com
mander in the Pacific, the reason
why Peiping has instituted a
seven-day cease-fire is "failure of
the announced and boasted Chi
nese Communist intent to take
the offshore islands." This is not
a convincing contribution to a dif
ficult situation, and the General,
if he feels that it is proper for
generals to make political state
ments, should at least not count
the chickens until some of them
are hatched. For if it is true that
'he Red Chinese have failed at
Quemoy, why did they put a time
1 imit of seven days on the cease
fire ?
Conceivably it may be a bluff
and if it is, they are, considering
Chiang's attitude, taking an enor
mous risk of having their bluff
called. It seems unlikely that
his is the explanation. If the
Chinese Communists are unable
to renew the bombardment, it
would have been so easy and so
much less risky for them to ac
cepted the Dulles proposal for' an
unlimited cease-fire to be followed
:>y a withdrawal of Nationalist
troops.
There are two other import
ant reasons why Gen. Kuter
would have done well to refrain
from claiming victory. The first
is that with the strategic limit
ations at Quemoy —Chiang he- '
ing unable to take the offen- |
s'ive —there can he no such thing
as a victory. There can be a
pause to bring up ammunition
and guns. The bombardment
can be renewed whenever the
Communists are ready, and
there is nothing that Chiang
can do about it. The local initi- {
alive, provided they do not in
vade but only bombard Que
moy, is with tlie Communists'.
The other reason why Gen. 1
Kuter was talking out of turn is !
that he has made it more difficult
for this government to do what

it is trying to do in the offshore
islands. What the government is
trying to do is to obtain a cease
fire after which, our being no
longer at the point of a gun, we
can bring about a disengagement
at Quemoy. Our own position is
that we will not make our con
cession while there is shooting.
It will be the part of wisdom
on both sides to remember "be
not rash; a golden bridge is for
a flying enemy."
The immediate practical quest
ion is what is to happen at the end
of the seven-day cease-fire. In try
ing to answer this question we
can, to the best of my knowledge,
define the present position as
follows. We have asked for' a gen
eral and unlimited cease-fire to be
followed by disengagement in the
offshore islands. Peiping has re
plied by instituting a limited
cease-fire combined with a pro
posal for direct negotiations with
Chiang about withdrawal from
those islands. Along with this and,
so to speak, parallel with this,
there is reason to believe that
Peiping does not regard the For-

mosa question us immediate and
urgent, and that there is not now
or in the immediate future a For
mosa crisis.
Presumably, then, the answer
to the question of whether (h<*
cease-fire is to continue at the
end of the seven days is that it
will probably continue if some
how —perhaps at Warsaw, per
haps through intermediaries at
the United Nations or elsewhere
—Peiping is told that a bargain
can he struck about Quemoy.
[Editor's Note: Red China has
extended the cease-fire for two
weeks'. |
The possibilities open to us in
this phase of the whole affair are
disengagement in the offshore is
lands and a de factor standstill in
Formosa. This would not be a
lasting settlement. But it could
be a provisional settlement which
lasted for some time. That would
be something. Not much perhaps
but more than can be achieved by
any other method that anyone
has proposed.
