Make Paths Safe
Editor, The Daily:
If the Stanford police do intend
to enforce their ruling which re
quires bicyclists to use the side
paths along Palm Drive, they
might also require the Corpora
tion Yard to make paths reason
ably safe for bicycling. Loose
and rough gravel in the dry
we a th e r, mud holes in wet
weather, and deceptively danger
ous entry and exit ramps make
these paths the most difficult
bicycling area on campus. Com
mon sense and his instinct for
self-preservation should instruct

! the bicyclist to keep off the paths
i until they have been paved.

Not Sir James
Editor, The Daily:
Lest your reporter, Duane
Davis, mislead readers as to the
"Barrie" mentioned in the review
of Joseph Wood Krutch's Liltle
Theatre discussion on Oct. 8. this
is the late Philip Barry, not Sir
James Barrie.
The other comic dramatist
paired b\; Mr. Krutch and others
in the discussion was Samuel
Behrman.
