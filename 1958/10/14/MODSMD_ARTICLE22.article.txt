### A Review By C.L. Payne 
"Til 10 OKDI A 1 OF WOOnitOU
WILSON" — II e r l> <» r ( Hoover
.VleClraw-llill, $(>, HIS pp.
The thesis developed by former-
President Hoover in this sympa
thetic study of an obviously ad
mired man is that in Wilson's
j\personal defeat at the Versailles
Peace Conference we see enacted
the defeat of New World idealism
and innocence at the hands of old
world intrigue and selfish inter
est. For it is Hoover's contention
that in the struggle between Pres
ident Wilson on the one hand and
the European Allies led by Clem
: enceau on the other we have ex
traordinary idealism and cynical
; intrigue embodied in combat.
Wilson Crippled
In addition to being hampered
by the deliberate designs of the
| European politicians, Wilson was
crippled by his own political in
eptitude. Mr. Hoover presents in
documented detail the happenings
from the time Wilson first en
unciated his Fourteen Points for
peace through to the eventual
failure of the United States Sen
ate to ratify the League of Na
tions Covenent. Throughout all
of this an attempt is made to
show that the members of the Old
World Order forced Wilson to
compromise his ideals and thus
to sacrifice a major portion of
his program for a "just peace" in
order to obtain support for the
League of Nations, and that
Wilson in turn forced the Senate
to destroy the very thing of im
portance he had saved by his own
refusal to compromise on a mat
ter infringing upon the sover
eignty of the United States (Art
icle X of the League Covenent).
Though unstated, the unavoid
able conclusion reached is that
Wilson's ordeal was in a large
measure brought upon himself.
Documentation
In addition to the novelty of
recording what one former presi

dent has to say about another,
Mr. Hoover's book is greatly en
hanced by the vast amount of
documentation offered to sup
port the contentions it contains.
Moreover, the reader is able to
see Wilson through the eyes of
one who w as actually present on
the scene at the time in a posi
tion of importance'. On the other
hand, the chief weakness of the
book lies in the fact that much
of the documentation and infor
mation given is concerned so
particularly with what Mr.
Hoover was doing at the time
that the reader sometimes won
ders exactly which of the former
presidents is really the subject of
the work.
There is no real question, how
ever, as to the merits of the book
and its importance to anyone
reasonably concerned with the
men and events that irrevocably
committed this nation to ;i major
position in world affairs.
