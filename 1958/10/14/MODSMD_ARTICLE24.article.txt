# Memorial Church Policy Emphasizes Unity
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The follow
ing is- presented in an attempt
to clarify the position of the
Memorial Church in relation to
the denominational religious
groups on the campus.)
"The University must be for
ever' maintained upon a strictly
non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis.
"It must never become an in
strument in the hands of any po
litical party or any religious sect
or organization. I believe that the
moral and religious development
of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free
from all denominational alliances,
however slight the bond may be."
This statement, made by Jane
Lathrop Stanford in Oct., 1902,
in an amendment to the Founding
Grant, has continued to be the
guiding policy for the Memorial
Church. In accordance with it,
public denominational meetings
may not be held individually but
may only take place under co
operative enterprise, a policy
which has led to misunderstand
ing among some groups.

"This is not negative prohibi
tion but positive opportunity,"
said the Reverend Robert M,
Minto, chaplain. "The purpose of
Memorial Church is to empha
size church unity and coopera
tive activity."
Jane Stanford's statement, how
ever, was made as a prohibition—
a prohibition against the secta
rian rivalries of her day; rival
ries which have sometimes led
to religious competition, but
which are subdued today.
According to Chaplain Minto,
"The mark' of religion in our
time is cooperation between
churches — the founding of the
World Council of Churches, the
ecumenical movement, the unit
ing of churches. The university
campus ought to be the place
where students encounter this
same cooperation and where,
through mixing with fellow stu
dents of different religious back
grounds, reach a better under
standing of their own faith and a
more sympathetic view of the
religion of others."
The interpreting body for Mrs.

Stanford's regulations is the Pub
lic Exercises Committee, a fac
ulty committee with representa
tives from each department. This
group, which has jurisdiction
over every public gathering on
campus, has, through vetoing
denominational meetings as such,
approved private meetings for
group members only without an
outside advisor and without ad
vertising. Meetings such as those,
however, cannot be held in build
ings owned and operated by the
University, which leaves only the
Women's Clubhouse, the Men's
F acuity Club, and Bowman
Alumni House available.
If a denominational group
wishes to hold a public meeting,
present a program or noted
speaker, it must get the approval
of the Committee on Religious
Affairs, a student body composed
of the president or a representa
tive from every religious group,
including the YWCA and the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.
This committee has in the past
sponsored such speakers as
Father Gustav Weigle and Bis
hop Manikam and will present
Canon Bryon Green on November
2

The Memorial Church,
"entirely free from all denomina
tional alliances" as Mrs. Stanford
wished, carries on an extensive
student program and is a "true
cooperative enterprise."
A ten minute prayer service is
held at noon daily and is led
by studeirts of different denomin
ational groups. A half-hour
Candlelight Service, with short

scripture readings and organ
music is held on Wednesdays at
9:30 p.m., and the new Vesper-
Service, a more liturgical one,
is held on Tuesdays at the same
time. Two services are held each
Sunday, Communion at 9 a.m. and
the regular morning worship at
11 a.m.
The Memorial Church choir is
iir cooperation with the Music

Department and may count for
group activity credit, while the
student-taught Church School, a
program for kindergarten
through junior high age, is in co
operation with the education de
partment.

Weekly study groups which
meet in the dormitories with de
nominational advisors as leaders
are another facet of the Church
program.
In addition, the University pro
vides for instruction on an aca
demic level in the field of religion.

The Memorial Church,
"entirely free from all denomina
tional alliances" as Mrs. Stanford
wished, carries on an extensive
student program and is a "true
cooperative enterprise."
A ten minute prayer service is
held at noon daily and is led
by studeirts of different denomin
ational groups. A half-hour
Candlelight Service, with short

scripture readings and organ
music is held on Wednesdays at
9:30 p.m., and the new Vesper-
Service, a more liturgical one,
is held on Tuesdays at the same
time. Two services are held each
Sunday, Communion at 9 a.m. and
the regular morning worship at
11 a.m.
The Memorial Church choir is
iir cooperation with the Music

Department and may count for
group activity credit, while the
student-taught Church School, a
program for kindergarten
through junior high age, is in co
operation with the education de
partment.

Weekly study groups which
meet in the dormitories with de
nominational advisors as leaders
are another facet of the Church
program.
In addition, the University pro
vides for instruction on an aca
demic level in the field of religion.
(Editor's Note: The follow
ing is- presented in an attempt
to clarify the position of the
Memorial Church in relation to
the denominational religious
groups on the campus.)
"The University must be for
ever' maintained upon a strictly
non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis.
"It must never become an in
strument in the hands of any po
litical party or any religious sect
or organization. I believe that the
moral and religious development
of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free
from all denominational alliances,
however slight the bond may be."
This statement, made by Jane
Lathrop Stanford in Oct., 1902,
in an amendment to the Founding
Grant, has continued to be the
guiding policy for the Memorial
Church. In accordance with it,
public denominational meetings
may not be held individually but
may only take place under co
operative enterprise, a policy
which has led to misunderstand
ing among some groups.

"This is not negative prohibi
tion but positive opportunity,"
said the Reverend Robert M,
Minto, chaplain. "The purpose of
Memorial Church is to empha
size church unity and coopera
tive activity."
Jane Stanford's statement, how
ever, was made as a prohibition—
a prohibition against the secta
rian rivalries of her day; rival
ries which have sometimes led
to religious competition, but
which are subdued today.
According to Chaplain Minto,
"The mark' of religion in our
time is cooperation between
churches — the founding of the
World Council of Churches, the
ecumenical movement, the unit
ing of churches. The university
campus ought to be the place
where students encounter this
same cooperation and where,
through mixing with fellow stu
dents of different religious back
grounds, reach a better under
standing of their own faith and a
more sympathetic view of the
religion of others."
The interpreting body for Mrs.

Stanford's regulations is the Pub
lic Exercises Committee, a fac
ulty committee with representa
tives from each department. This
group, which has jurisdiction
over every public gathering on
campus, has, through vetoing
denominational meetings as such,
approved private meetings for
group members only without an
outside advisor and without ad
vertising. Meetings such as those,
however, cannot be held in build
ings owned and operated by the
University, which leaves only the
Women's Clubhouse, the Men's
F acuity Club, and Bowman
Alumni House available.
If a denominational group
wishes to hold a public meeting,
present a program or noted
speaker, it must get the approval
of the Committee on Religious
Affairs, a student body composed
of the president or a representa
tive from every religious group,
including the YWCA and the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.

through mixing with fellow stu
dents of different religious back
grounds, reach a better under
standing of their own faith and a
more sympathetic view of the
religion of others."
The interpreting body for Mrs.

Stanford's regulations is the Pub
lic Exercises Committee, a fac
ulty committee with representa
tives from each department. This
group, which has jurisdiction
over every public gathering on
campus, has, through vetoing
denominational meetings as such,
approved private meetings for
group members only without an
outside advisor and without ad
vertising. Meetings such as those,
however, cannot be held in build
ings owned and operated by the
University, which leaves only the
Women's Clubhouse, the Men's
F acuity Club, and Bowman
Alumni House available.
If a denominational group
wishes to hold a public meeting,
present a program or noted
speaker, it must get the approval
of the Committee on Religious
Affairs, a student body composed
of the president or a representa
tive from every religious group,
including the YWCA and the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.
This committee has in the past
sponsored such speakers as
Father Gustav Weigle and Bis
hop Manikam and will present
Canon Bryon Green on November
2

The Memorial Church,
"entirely free from all denomina
tional alliances" as Mrs. Stanford
wished, carries on an extensive
student program and is a "true
cooperative enterprise."
A ten minute prayer service is
held at noon daily and is led
by studeirts of different denomin
ational groups. A half-hour
Candlelight Service, with short

scripture readings and organ
music is held on Wednesdays at
9:30 p.m., and the new Vesper-
Service, a more liturgical one,
is held on Tuesdays at the same
time. Two services are held each
Sunday, Communion at 9 a.m. and
the regular morning worship at
11 a.m.
The Memorial Church choir is
iir cooperation with the Music

Department and may count for
group activity credit, while the
student-taught Church School, a
program for kindergarten
through junior high age, is in co
operation with the education de
partment.

Weekly study groups which
meet in the dormitories with de
nominational advisors as leaders
are another facet of the Church
program.
In addition, the University pro
vides for instruction on an aca
demic level in the field of religion.
(Editor's Note: The follow
ing is- presented in an attempt
to clarify the position of the
Memorial Church in relation to
the denominational religious
groups on the campus.)
"The University must be for
ever' maintained upon a strictly
non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis.
"It must never become an in
strument in the hands of any po
litical party or any religious sect
or organization. I believe that the
moral and religious development
of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free
from all denominational alliances,
however slight the bond may be."
This statement, made by Jane
Lathrop Stanford in Oct., 1902,
in an amendment to the Founding
Grant, has continued to be the
guiding policy for the Memorial
Church. In accordance with it,
public denominational meetings
may not be held individually but
may only take place under co
operative enterprise, a policy
which has led to misunderstand
ing among some groups.

"This is not negative prohibi
tion but positive opportunity,"
said the Reverend Robert M,
Minto, chaplain. "The purpose of
Memorial Church is to empha
size church unity and coopera
tive activity."
Jane Stanford's statement, how
ever, was made as a prohibition—
a prohibition against the secta
rian rivalries of her day; rival
ries which have sometimes led
to religious competition, but
which are subdued today.
According to Chaplain Minto,
"The mark' of religion in our
time is cooperation between
churches — the founding of the
World Council of Churches, the
ecumenical movement, the unit
ing of churches. The university
campus ought to be the place
where students encounter this
same cooperation and where,
through mixing with fellow stu
dents of different religious back
grounds, reach a better under
standing of their own faith and a
more sympathetic view of the
religion of others."
