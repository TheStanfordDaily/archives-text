A Nice Time to Be Wrong
It's usually not a very gratifying experience to be wrong, but I
was awfully happy to have been wrong in picking Washington to beat
the Indians Saturday. On the other hand, how were we supposed to
know that Jack Curtice would turn loose a completely different team
against the Huskies than the one which had stumbled its way through
three lopsided losses?
The names and numbers may have been the same, but that was
abou! the only resemblance the Cards of Saturday bore to the Cards
of the weeks before.
( ui tlce stuck to his guns in his decision to'simplify the play-call
ing for the Indian quarterbacks. It must have worked in Bob Nic<>-
let's case, at any rate, because he called a far better game than Stan
ford had seen before in 1958.
The biggest improvement in the play-calling was the throwing out
ol most of the wide plays that took too long to develop. The one
quick-developer, the quick pitch to Kick McMillen, did stay, and look
what it did.
Nicole! also discarded many of the flat pass plays that had failed
for lack of speed. But he did fairly often rely on the 10-yard flare-out
pass to li'v Nikolai, and it worked despite the repetition.
Nicolet mixed up his tools so that the Indians weren't getting into
the scores of third-and-seven situations they had faced earlier in the
year.
Finding an explanation for the offensive success is pretty easy.
But why or how did the defense suddenly become a tiger that yielded
one long drive in the opening minutes, then settled down to allow
almost nolhing to the Huskies?
Cliehe-ish as it sounds, plenty of hard work looks to have been the
answer.
One more note which has been generally overlooked in the glare
of victory. How about those conversion successes? Two for-two by
Skip Face in the kicking department, then a two-pointer makes
things look pretty nice. Coming on top of the 14-12 Big Game victory
of lasi year, it means that successful PAT work has played a key
role in the past two Stanford wins.
Plenty of people wondered why Stanford bothered to try for two
points after the third touchdown when another successful kick would
have given the Tribe a nine-point margin that would have put Wash
ington more than a TD and conversion in arrears.
After the game, Curtice was asked if the decision had been the
roaches'. "Well," lie cracked,"we didifl send the tee in so I guess it
must have been ours."
"Yon look back over the past couple ol* years and you'll see that
two or three conversion kicks in a row are pretty rare around here.
I figured maybe the chances were against us kicking that third one."
Thus, Curtice's Casey Stengel-type reason for going after two points.
Snips and Snails and Falcon's Tales
Best off-season news for Stanford track fans this fall hasn't had
anything to do with athletes. Rather, it was the discovery that the
Stadium track has been widened to eight lanes at all points.
The old six-lane track had been wide enough for large champion
ship meets 20 years ago, but wasn't up to par in recent times. Now,
with the combination of the track widening and installation of a new
running surface, track coach Payton Jordan reports that Stanford
will immediately try to lure meets such as PCC and NCAA to the
local oval.

While on the subject of Jordan's runners, his long distance men
are now ready to go on their fall cross-country schedule. Not count
ing Friday's warm-up meet, three attractive races are scheduled for
I he Stanford golf course.
The first of these will be Saturday morning against the Air Force
Academy. It's the first intersectional cross-country meet in Stanford
history, and shapes up as an excellent race. The Air Academy has
made great strides in both high-power and low-power sports in its
three years of competition, and looks about ready to step in as a
national power all along the line.
The harriers' annual triangular with USC and California is on the
calendar for Nov. 1. But the biggest local meet of the year will be
the Nov. 20 PCC championships. A conference-wide cross-country
meel was inaugurated only last year, and was a big success. Unfor
tunately, this second meet will also be the last—at least until the
time that some new league set-up may develop.

Speaking again of the Air Force, athletes and school officials
won't be the only passengers on their flight to California. Their
falcon mascot will also make the trip—unless he's under disciplinary
act ion.
It seems that the bird is trained to put on a half-time show of
flight maneuvers and so forth. He's trained to operate on commands
from the ground, and it's apparently quite an impressive and unique
performance.
But something went haywire at lowa two weeks ago when the
bird put on his act. Seems the crowd wasn't quiet enough, and so
instead of coming down, the falcon went soaring out of the stadium.
Along about the fourth quarter, his handlers ran him down some
distance away from his stage.

Speaking now of passengers on team flights, here's a big vote of
approval to assistant athletic director Chuck Taylor's policy of taking
selected non-athletes along on Stanford trips. Taylor's idea, and it's
just another in a productive line of public relations plans, is to let
more people on campus become associated with Stanford athletics.
It's bound to lead to more understanding between the campus and
I lie teams, and should help prevent the isolation of athletes which
has come into style at more than a few large schools.
On the Northwestern trip, for example, in addition to the team,
coaches and press, passengers included ASSU president John Bohn,
head yell leader Dick Stanford, Dean of Men William Craig and Asso
ciate General Secretary Jack Shepard. The cast will vary for each
trip, but the idea will remain the same—let more people gain a first
hand experience with Stanford athletics.
* * *
And while speaking of votes of approval, here's another one to
the athletic department for returning to the 25-cent football pro
grams. Last year, I talked with Athletic Publicity Director Don
l.iebendorfer and devoted a column to his ideas concerning programs.
At the time, he was very much in favor of the 25-cent type, with
line-ups, pictures and essential information —not a magazine full
of ads.
Then came the home opener against Rice, and the price was a big
DO cents. Frankly, it wasn't a 50-cent value. But things were back
to normal against Washington with a concise, relevant two-bit pro
gram, and the fans are happy again.
