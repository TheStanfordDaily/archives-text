# Gridders Back at Work Prepping for Falcons
## 
### 
It was a week of hard practices
tnd one hard-played game that
Accounted for Stanford's upset
win over Washington last Satur
iay. But the Indian squad will
have to work harder this week in
preparation for the undefeated
Falcons of the Air Force Acad
emy.
Saturday's game will initiate
the series between the Cards and
I he Academy.
After three struggling years,
the Falcons finally have a win
ning team and seniors on the
squad roster. The three tough
year? have paid off in the form of
a well balanced, experienced team
which for the most part has been
working together since they were
freshmen.
Smooth Running Offense
Indian coach Jack Curtice says
the Cards will work hard on both
offense and defense during the
week, with special emphasis on
stopping the smooth running Air
Force offense.
This offense consists of two
equally good teams, led respec
tively by quarterbacks John Kun
zel and Rich Mayo. Each can pre
sent a well balanced attack.
Another of the big factors that
have helped the Falcons pile up
their undefeated string this year
is the hard charging play of tackle
Brock Strom. Strom, the captain,
is a tough 217-pounder. Besides
being a topnotbh football player,
he also rates as an excellent stu
dent and made last year's Aca
demic All-American team.
The Indian line, led by stand
outs Doug Purcell, Russ Steele
and Roch Conklin, which stopped
cold the Washington attack, will
have to be just as tough if not
tougher to hold the more experi
enced, platooned Falcon machine
which Strom leads.
Basic Plays
Stanford's use of just a few
basic plays will be continued, re
ports Curtice, "but we may add
one or two new patterns."
The only serious injury as a
result of the Washington game is
the torn knee ligaments of full
back Gil Dowd, who will not see
action for at least three weeks.
The Stanford squad suffered a lot
of bruises and other minor in
juries, but none which will keep
anyone else out of this Saturday's
clash.
The hole left in the Indian back
field by Dowd's injury will most
likely be filled by seniors Jim
Byrer and Doug Dick, according
to Curtice. Hard charging Dick
turned in a fine performance
against the Huskies last week end.
Watched Films
Last night the Indian team
watched films of the Air Force in
their games against lowa and Col
orado State. The Falcons tied the
high ranking Hawkeyes two
weeks ago, 13-13. Last week they
had no trouble in overwhelming
nearby Colorado State, 36-0.
This will be the second time the
Air Force has ventured into the
Pacific Coast Conference, the last
time being a year ago when they

were crushed, 47-0, by UCLA in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
However, this year the Acad
emy will come to the Coast as fa
vorites to even their series with
West Coast teams, and if all the
press releases arid records are 100
per cent accurate the Cards will
probably be facing their toughest
opponent of the year on Satur
day.
