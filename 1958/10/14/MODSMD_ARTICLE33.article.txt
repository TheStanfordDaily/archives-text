# Elliott Lauds SC at Grid Luncheon
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO </P> Three
of four winners showed up at the
northern California grid writers'
luncheon Monday and after a few
pleasant comments, lapsed into
predictions of grief for the coming
week end.
"Southern California is twice as
good as they were last year," said
California's Pete Elliott. "The
Trojans have one of the strongest
lines I've seen. They have size,
speed and they really hit." The
teams play Saturday in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
Cul Improving?
Well, if SC is that much im
proved, what about Cal? Both
teams won only one game last
season. This year SC has beaten
only Oregon State. California has
big victories over Washington
State and Utah. Elliott declined
an answer.
Stanford's Jack Curtice's play
ers carried him off the Jjeld Sat
urday after beating Washington,
22-12, for their first win.
"It all balances out," Curtice
quipped. "You get kicked off one
week and carried off the next."
lie said the Indians will play
the undefeated Air Force Acad
emy at Stanford without fullback
Gil Dowd and halfback Dick Bow
ers, both on the injured list.
Air Force Strong-
Marty Reiseh, the academy
publicist, put a "50 Per Cent Im
proved" sign on the Falcons de
spite a record that includes a 13-13
"no fluke" tie with strong lowa.
The Air Force had a 3-6-1 record
last year.
The third winner, San Francisco
State's Joe Verducci, considered
his Friday night victory over Oc
cidental sheer luck. He said he'd
need more of the same to beat
Nevada this Saturday night ai
Reno. "They have a good first
unit and then drop off just like
we do," Verducci said.
Dick Bass, the nation's leading
rusher from College of the Pa
c if i c, suffered a slight muscle
bruise in his shoulder in COP's
triumph over Brigham Young, but
should not even miss practice, re
ported Bill Tunnell, the Tiger tub
thumper.
"It's definitely not a crippling
injury," Tunnell said.
Torn Ligaments
But he noted that Wayne Haw
kins, first-string right tackle, tore
some ligaments in a knee and will
be lost for t he season.
Bass and company play Cincin
nati Saturday night in COP's
homecoming. It's a rivalry that
dates back to 1949. Each team
always has won on its home field.

speed and they really hit." The
teams play Saturday in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
Cul Improving?
Well, if SC is that much im
proved, what about Cal? Both
teams won only one game last
season. This year SC has beaten
only Oregon State. California has
big victories over Washington
State and Utah. Elliott declined
an answer.
Stanford's Jack Curtice's play
