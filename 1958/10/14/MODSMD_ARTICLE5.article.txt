## High Court Refuses to Hear Cases 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) — The Su
preme Court Monday knocked
down appeals for reviews of three
cases stemming from School inte
gration. The high court:
• Denied Louisiana school offi
cials review of a decision striking
down a requirement for a certifi
cate of eligibility before admis
sion to state institutions of higher
learning. The decision had been
handed down by the U.S. Circuit
Court in New Orleans on suits by
Negroes who successfully con
tended that their constitutional
rights had been violated.
• Refused the Delaware State
Board of Education review of an
order to draw up a plan of de
segregation for all school districts
which have not admitted Negroes.
The board had contended that un
der Delaware law the power to
effect desegregation lies not with
it but with local school boards.
Monday's review denial uphold a
U.S. circuit court which had said
it -saw no merit in such a conten
tion.
• Denied Arkansas Gov. Orval
E. Faubus review of an injunction
barring use of National Guards
men at Little Rock's Central High
School a year ago last month.
Faubus had claimed that U.S. Dis
trict Judge Ronald E. Davies, who
issued the injunction, had acted
without legal authority. Faubus
also had claimed the Justice De
partment had no right to ask for
the injunction because the depart
ment was not "the real party in
interest."
The three cases were listed rou
tinely among a large number
which the Supreme Court refused
to review.
In another case, the high court
agreed to review a U.S. district
court decision that voided three
Virginia laws aimed at the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People.
Two of the state laws required
organizations which engage in ra
cial litigation or collect funds for
such purposes to register with the
state. The third provided punish
ment for stirring up litigation.
