# $174,500 Helps Medical Study

### 
Deeper study of the chemistry
and functions of the brain is one
of four research projects now be
ing carried out in the area of
study of the human body by Uni
versity departments. Grants and
apparatus with a total value of
$174,500 are assisting the re
searchers.
Studies of the septum, a part of
the "primitive" forebrain, and of
the adrenal hormones are being
undertaken under the direction
of Professor Ronald Grant of
the Physiology Department, as
part of a new research program
in physiology.
The septum and the adrenal
hormones, which are found in the
glands and in the brain, may be
involved with emotional behavior,
Dr. Grant has suggested. He has
received $16,900 from the U. S.
Public Health Service for research
on the septum, and $25,000 from
the Office of Naval Research for
study of the adrenal hormones.
Dr. Grant's associates on the
brain physiology research pro
gram include Dr. Milton Rose,
Palo Alto psychiatrist and phys
iologist, and Dr. Henry P. Ward
of the Stanford physiology depart
ment, and Professor John M.
Warren, Jr., who is cooperating
in studies of the effects of brain
injuries on monkeys.
Heart X Rays
New apparatus of a value of
$100,000 is allowing Stanford Med
ical School radiologists to make
X-ray motion picture studies of
the heart in three dimensions. The
project was financed by the Nat

ional Heart Institute of the U. S.
Public Health Service, and is
under the direction of Professor
Herbert L. Adams.
The new equipment, built in
Holland, employs two 11-inch
"image intensifiers" at right
angles to each other, allowing the
cardiac motion and blood through
the heart, lungs, and great ves
sels to be studied in two planes
simultaneously.
The 11-inch image intensifiers
are the largest in use. Three
other 11-inchers are in use in
European medical centers, but
Stanford's is the first installation
designed for simultaneous two
plane studies.
Studies with the apparatus are
usually performed with a cathe
ter, or plastic tube, inserted into
the heart through a vein. An
opaque substance is rapidly and
automatically injected through
the catheter into the heart cham
ber.
Images Filmed
Meantime X-ray tubes, suspen
ded from the ceiling, beam their
rays at right angles through the
patient directly into the image
intensifiers. The two images pro
duced are caught on epecially pro
cessed 35-mm motion picture film,
and record the movement of the
opaque material through the
heart, lungs, and great vessels.
The two separate film strips
resulting from this process show
the same motion from different
angles. They can be studied or
projected together to give dimcn
sions of the cardiac chambers in
two planes simultaneously.
Dr. Abrams is currently check
ing performance of the apparatus
with animals in preparation for
experimental studies of the heart
and blood vessels. The equipment
will also be applied to clinical
problems with patients to eval
uate its usefulness in this field.
Diseases of the nervous system,
including multiple sclerosis will
be carried on in a new Medical
School laboratory established by
funds from Daniel E. Koshland,
president of Levi Strauss and Co.
This Koshland Laboratory of
Neuroehemistry will be located on
the Palo Alto campus. A grant of
$33,000 from the U. S. Public
Health Service will help maintain
the first three years of the pro
gram.
Dr. Elizabeth Roboz will head
the new laboratory. She was for
merly associate professor of bio
chemistry at Georgetown Univer
sity School of Medicine, and is
known for her investigations in
neuroehemistry.
The activities of the laboratory
will have both a clinical and ex
perimental approach. The clini
cal approach will develop pro
cedures to determine the chemical
makeup of cerebrospinal fluid and
will apply these procedures in the
diagnosis of neurological diseases.
The experimental approach con
cerns Dr. Roboz' studies of protein
subtances she has taken from the
spinal cords of cattle. When these
substances are injected into ex
perimental animals, a diseased
condition similar to multiple scler
osis is developed. Study of this
condition may throw light on the
human disease.
Tests of a highly poisonous
drug which may be useful in the
treatment of muscular disease are
now being made by a Stanford
Medical School investigator, Dr.
William W. Hofmann.
The work on the drug, vera
trine, which is obtained from the
root of a desert herb, is supported
by a $1,100 grant from the non
profit Myasthenia Gravis Found
ation.
