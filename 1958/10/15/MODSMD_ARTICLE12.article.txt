UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/Piâ€”
Britain Tuesday accused the So
viet Union of confronting the
U.N. with an ultimatum by
threatening to go ahead with nu
clear weapons tests unless the
Western powers agree to Soviet
proposals.
Commander Allan Noble, Brit
ish minister of state, told the
General Assembly's 81-nation Po
litical Committee the Russians
are trying to stampede the U.N.
into hasty action that might en
danger the chances of Big Three
agreement on suspending tests.
Soviets Reply
Soviet Deputy foreign Minis
ter Valerian A. Zorin immediate
ly denied the ultimatum charge.
He declared the United States and
Britain had issued ultimatums by
attaching conditions for cessation
of tests. He called on the U.N. to
approve a Soviet - proposed rec
ommendation that the Big Three
suspend tests immediately and
unconditionally for all time.
Soviet Threats
Noble said the Soviet govern
ment is threatening to go ahead
with nuclear tests "unless the
Western powers here and now
agree to the Soviet proposals."
He declared this amounted to an
ultimatum.
"I can only hope that the So
viet government will reconsider
its position and will not do any
thing to prevent a suspension of
tests from Oct. 31," Noble added.
That is the date the United
States, Britain and the Soviet Un
ion open talks in Geneva on nego
tiating a suspension under a con
trol system already worked out
by East-West experts. The Unit
ed States and Britain have an
nounced they will suspend tests
for a year heginning Oct. 31, pro
vided the Russians do the same.
Allies Assure Suspension
Noble said Britain's offer of a
one-year suspension still holds
good and was not affected by the
recent resumption of tests by the
Soviet Union.
"Once the negotiations begin in
Geneva as planned, if the Soviet
government does not continue
testing after that date, then our
own tests will stop anyhow for
another year," he added.
"And if satisfactory progress is
made in the matters we have
specified, there is no reason why
the suspension should not go on
indefinitely."
The United States has given
similar assurances before the
committee.
