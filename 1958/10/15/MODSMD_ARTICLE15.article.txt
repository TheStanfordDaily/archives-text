# Red China Guilty Of Deceit--Dulles
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)â€”Secretary
of State Dulles accused Red China
Tuesday of propaganda and sub
versive activity, under cover of
its Formosa Strait cease-fire, to
drive a wedge between the United
States and Nationalist China.
"The main theme constantly re
iterated is that the Americans
must abandon Taiwan (Formosa)
. . . and go home," Dulles said.
"The United States remains
loyal*to its treaty of mutual se
curity with the Republic of
China."

On the subject of politics,
Dulles said he hoped both Repub
licans and Democrats would re
frain from discussing current as
pects of foreign policy in the 1958
Congressional campaign.
A reporter quoted a statement
by Vice-President Nixon at Chi
cago Monday night in which N'ix
on said, "The Acheson foreign
policy resulted in war and the Ei

senhower-Dulles policy resulted
in peace."
Urges No Force Reduction
Dulles said he has no plans
whatsoever for urging a reduc
tion of National forces on China's
coastal islands. On the surface,
this appeared to be a reversal of
his statement two weeks ago that
it would be foolish to maintain
the current garrison strength on
the Nationalist islands if Red
China agreed to a dependable
cease-fire.
But Dulles did not picture it as
a reversal. He quoted statements
hy Red Chinese leaders last Sun
day, when Peiping's earlier one
week suspension of shelling w;is
extended for two additional
weeks. These statements invited
defenders of Quemoy and the oth
er coastal islands to build up
their arms and supplies during
the cease-fire.
"Matter of Indifference"
Dulles said the Communists
thus treated the islands "as a
matter of indifference." He said
the question of withholding Na
tionalist troops from them could
not therefore be considered a bar
gaining issue or the price of a
Red cease-fire.
The Secretary refused to say
what the United States might of
fer as an inducement for contin
uing the cease-fire.
