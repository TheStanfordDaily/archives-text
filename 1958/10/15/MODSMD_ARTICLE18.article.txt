## THE 						POLITICAL EYE 'Hate Measures' Get Consideration 
### Leo Krulitz 
A wide variety of propositions
that could drastically alter- the
economic and political future of
California will be placed before
Ihe voters Nov. 4. These propo
sitions range from allowing box
ing on Sundays to the controver
sial right-to-work issue.
Three of the 18 propositions
have been placed on the ballot by
initiative, tlie three so-called "hate
measures," 16, 17 and 18.
Proposition 18, concerning
the right-to-work issue, is prob
ably the most controversial.
The main provision of this
proposition is the clause that
would outlaw the union shop
in California. The union shop
which can be negotiated by
labor requires all employees
working for a firm to join the
union within 30 days after they
have been hired.
People urging a "Vote Yes" on
Proposition 18 argue that it
should be a basic right of each
individual to determine if he
wants to join a union or not. Peo
ple opposed to the proposition
suggest lhat all people working
in the plant should bear the cost
of the contract negotiations.
The Republican Party has ta
ken no stand on this measure.
Senator William Knowland sup
ports it and Governor Knight is
opposed to it. The Democratic
platform and most Democratic
candidates oppose the measure.
Proposition 10 is the taxa
tion ol private schools initiative
and would place the property
of religious schools of less than
collegiate standing on the s-tate
tax rolls. The exemption was
granted in 1952 by a public ref
erendum.

Catholic and Protestant
churches are opposed to the meas
ure arguing, among other things,
that to tax the schools would
really increase the taxes of Cali
fornians. More than 340,000 stu
dents are now educated in non
profit schools.
Those in favor of the measure
suggest that to exempt religious
school property is to give special
privileges to the church.
Proposition 17 would reduce
the sales tax in California from
3 to 2 per cent and would in
crease the income tax on upper
incomes. It has been estimated
by the state comptroller, Rob
ert Kirkwood, that passage of
this measure would result in
the loss of about $50 million to
the state.
This proposition was intro
duced by the California State
Federation of Labor to supposed
ly divert the money and efforts
of the proponents of the right-to
work measure. Labor has spent
less than $8000 to support this
measure as compared to the hun
dreds of thousands of dollars be
ing spent by opponents of Pr opo
sition 17. And much to the sur
prise of both sides, polls indicate
that the measure has a chance of
passing—a measure that has had
virtually no financial backing.
The plight of this proposition
suggests two things: first, per
haps it doesn't always take a lot
of money to conduct a successful
campaign, and, secondly, the
truth might be that Californians
feel the sales tax is unfair. In
any event, it appears that if the
measure does pass the state will
have a real financial problem on
its hands.

Friday: The Remaining Prop
ositions.
A wide variety of propositions
that could drastically alter- the
economic and political future of
California will be placed before
Ihe voters Nov. 4. These propo
sitions range from allowing box
ing on Sundays to the controver
sial right-to-work issue.
Three of the 18 propositions
have been placed on the ballot by
initiative, tlie three so-called "hate
measures," 16, 17 and 18.
Proposition 18, concerning
the right-to-work issue, is prob
ably the most controversial.
The main provision of this
proposition is the clause that
would outlaw the union shop
in California. The union shop
which can be negotiated by
labor requires all employees
working for a firm to join the
union within 30 days after they
have been hired.
People urging a "Vote Yes" on
Proposition 18 argue that it
should be a basic right of each
individual to determine if he
wants to join a union or not. Peo
ple opposed to the proposition
suggest lhat all people working
in the plant should bear the cost
of the contract negotiations.
The Republican Party has ta
ken no stand on this measure.
Senator William Knowland sup
ports it and Governor Knight is
opposed to it. The Democratic
platform and most Democratic
candidates oppose the measure.
Proposition 10 is the taxa
tion ol private schools initiative
and would place the property
of religious schools of less than
collegiate standing on the s-tate
tax rolls. The exemption was
granted in 1952 by a public ref
erendum.

Catholic and Protestant
churches are opposed to the meas
ure arguing, among other things,
that to tax the schools would
really increase the taxes of Cali
fornians. More than 340,000 stu
dents are now educated in non
profit schools.
Those in favor of the measure
suggest that to exempt religious
school property is to give special
privileges to the church.
Proposition 17 would reduce
the sales tax in California from
3 to 2 per cent and would in
crease the income tax on upper
incomes. It has been estimated
by the state comptroller, Rob
ert Kirkwood, that passage of
this measure would result in
the loss of about $50 million to
the state.
This proposition was intro
duced by the California State
Federation of Labor to supposed
ly divert the money and efforts
of the proponents of the right-to
work measure. Labor has spent
less than $8000 to support this
measure as compared to the hun
dreds of thousands of dollars be
ing spent by opponents of Pr opo
sition 17. And much to the sur
prise of both sides, polls indicate
that the measure has a chance of
passing—a measure that has had
virtually no financial backing.
The plight of this proposition
suggests two things: first, per
haps it doesn't always take a lot
of money to conduct a successful
campaign, and, secondly, the
truth might be that Californians
feel the sales tax is unfair. In
any event, it appears that if the
measure does pass the state will
have a real financial problem on
its hands.
