## With Both Eyes Open 
### 
When it get around to that
point where it's hard to keep the
two little opticals open I begin to
realize that the quarter has begun
in earnest. Now if I only had. too,
we'd all be in fine shape. So I join
in a salute to all who have yet
to crack more than one book bind
ing and invite you all to join me
at some institution come Spring
semester.
Glad to see the old Cardinal
waving high after last Saturday;
'Iwas surely about time—and a
rather welcomed change from
what many of us had come to
visualize as a season record. But
it's not an easy job attributing
much of that win to a rather
Idon'tcare student body.
It's so hard to get away from
red-hotism when you talk about
rallies, but it's pretty important
that we don't have any more like
Ihe Dinkl parking lot phlopasco
Friday night. Count one vote here
for continuation of rallies, but
note a dissent in place, time, pro
gram. etc. How about a Rossotti's
Rally with Lilli St. Cyr as head
yell leader and Rudy Salvini's
band playing "Sons of the Stan
ford Red" (eyes).
But seriously, it seems that
Rally Com can come up with a
lollapolooza without waiting for
Big Game Time. After all, every
one goes to the two Big Game
rallies (one in Lake Lag, other in
S. F.) because there are more
things to watch, listen to, do, So,
Rally Com. . . . Then, too, now
that we've won one. ... So let's
DRINK a toast to the death of
apalhy-raising dullies.
SORRY SIGHT—RaIIy Com
and or Cardinals do not appear
on my list this week, but I do
have one more item for them.
Head Coach Jack Curtice on his

way to the rally last Fri. left to
go it alone, no escort, no actual
knowledge of where it was to be,
no nothing.
BIG NEWS — WHO CARES
DEPT.—Sales of aerosol shaving
preparations will account for 66
per cent of the shaving cream
market this year. If they only
knew how much of this wasn't
used on faces. If they'd only put
a little more power in the shots.
If they only cared.
I CARE — Don't know how old
this news will be, but think it's
interesting. So many people kid
about no one knowing where the
Roos Shack on Campus is; well,
how about the University's pub
lic dining room. Ever hear of
such a thing? There is one,
though. In the Union, right off
the court. Funny how these
things slip by without too many
knowing—or caring, I suppose.
BEAR I) NIKS — North Beach
has its characters, we're growing
our crop here, too. How dissap
pointed the shaving -cream-in-cans
people would be if they only
knew. Sociologists and psychol
ogists are at a loss to explain the
on-wave of facial hair. Seems
they're torn between inferiority
complexes and a desire to hide
from the world, a need for more
body warmth at nights on sleep
ing porches, and lack of enough
money or energy to shave'em off.
I'll buy that!
MEMO TO THE FLICKS
MGR.—Dear Sir: You have a
good selection of motion pictures
lined up this quarter, but you
have bit the dust on cartoons, boy.
After "The Little Red Hen," "The
Birds' Symphony" and"The Pam
pered Pussycat" I think it'll be
hard to remain in my seat WITH
BOTH EYES OPEN.
