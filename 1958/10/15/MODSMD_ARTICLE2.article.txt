# Tunisia, Egypt Threaten Split
## 
### 
CASABLANCA, Morocco (/P)—
A deep and perhaps fateful split
in the Arab North African world
appeared to be in the works Tues
day night. It is growing out of
an intense feud between Presi
dent Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia
and President Gamal Abdel Nas
ser of the United Arab Republic.
In Tunis, it was officially an
nounced that Tunisia is consider
ing a break in diplomatic rela
tions with Nasser's Cairo govern
ment.
In Cairo, U.A.R. delegates re
turned to the Arab League coun
cil table after leaving in a huff
Saturday when Tunisia accused
Nasser of trying to dominate oth
er countries.
Tunisian delegates still were
boycotting the league after the
bust-up Saturday. The league had
been called into session mainly to
welcome Tunisia and Morocco as
new members, making it a 10-na
tion group.
Morocco and Tunisia have usu
ally acted in concert, before and
since they won independence
from French ruie, and both sup
port the rebellion in neighboring
Algeria against the French. One
complicating factor now is that
the rebel exile government is
based in Cairo.
