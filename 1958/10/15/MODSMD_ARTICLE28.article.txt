# FUTURE STARS
## Papooses Shape Up After Week 
### Ron Rapoport 
In the week and a half that the
freshman football team has been
practicing, frosh coach Homer
Smith and his staff have been in
turn impressed, surprised and,
for a moment, very worried.
Impressive have been tackles
Chris Cottle from Morningskle
High School in Los Angeles and
Jim Moe from Edina, Minn.
Smith says, "They are not only
the best prospects at their posi
tions, but are also the hardest
workers at their positions."
Surprising are end Bob Muller
of Punahou High School in Hono
lulu and quarterback Bob Price
from LaVerne, Calif. According
to Smith they have looked very
sharp in practice so far and have
exceeded coaches' expectations.
Craig Injured
Worrisome for a moment was
the fact that Gary Craig of Riv
erside was hurt in a scrimmage
with the varsity last week. Craig,
termed by Smith the fastest back
on the squad, looked as though he
might have suffered a serious in
jury, but ended up with a turned
ankle and should be ready to play
again soon.
The frosh have been scrimmag
ing against each other and
against the varsity in what has
been another tough week of prac
tice. Smith says that after this
week the coaches will have a
pretty sound idea of what each
boy can do and that the team will
be doing less contact work in the
following weeks.
Afler Monday's defensive
scrimmage against the varsity,
Smith singled out guard Tom
Walsh of Portland, Ore., and Joe
Blum, an end from San Jose, as
having looked especially impres
sive on defense.
Trobabes First
The frosh open their season on
Saturday, N'ov. 1, against South
ern Cal frosh as a preview to the
Stanford-SC varsity clash. Smith
said that they will not have a
chance to scout the SC frosh and
will assume that they will use
the same offensive and defensive
patterns as the SC varsity.
The freshmen travel to Los An
geles for a game with the UCLA
frosh on Nov. 7 and end their sea
son with the annual Little Big
Came against Cal frosh on Nov.
15 in Stanford Stadium.

Blum, an end from San Jose, as
having looked especially impres
sive on defense.
Trobabes First
The frosh open their season on
Saturday, N'ov. 1, against South
ern Cal frosh as a preview to the
Stanford-SC varsity clash. Smith
said that they will not have a
chance to scout the SC frosh and
will assume that they will use
the same offensive and defensive
patterns as the SC varsity.
The freshmen travel to Los An
geles for a game with the UCLA
frosh on Nov. 7 and end their sea
son with the annual Little Big
Came against Cal frosh on Nov.
15 in Stanford Stadium.
In the week and a half that the
freshman football team has been
practicing, frosh coach Homer
Smith and his staff have been in
turn impressed, surprised and,
for a moment, very worried.
Impressive have been tackles
Chris Cottle from Morningskle
High School in Los Angeles and
Jim Moe from Edina, Minn.
Smith says, "They are not only
the best prospects at their posi
tions, but are also the hardest
workers at their positions."
Surprising are end Bob Muller
of Punahou High School in Hono
lulu and quarterback Bob Price
from LaVerne, Calif. According
to Smith they have looked very
sharp in practice so far and have
exceeded coaches' expectations.
Craig Injured
Worrisome for a moment was
the fact that Gary Craig of Riv
erside was hurt in a scrimmage
with the varsity last week. Craig,
termed by Smith the fastest back
on the squad, looked as though he
might have suffered a serious in
jury, but ended up with a turned
ankle and should be ready to play
again soon.
The frosh have been scrimmag
ing against each other and
against the varsity in what has
been another tough week of prac
tice. Smith says that after this
week the coaches will have a
pretty sound idea of what each
boy can do and that the team will
be doing less contact work in the
following weeks.
Afler Monday's defensive
scrimmage against the varsity,
Smith singled out guard Tom
Walsh of Portland, Ore., and Joe
Blum, an end from San Jose, as
having looked especially impres
sive on defense.
