# Cards Face Major job In High-Flying Falcons
## 
### 
If the Stanford Indians thought
they had a tough time with any
one team in their first three
games, they'll probably have it
doubly tough this Saturday when
they meet what amounts to two
teams from the Air Force Acad
emy.
The Falcons' new coach Ben
Martin has been running the Air
Force team on a unit system
something like that employed by
many of the nation's grid powers
and which has worked especially
well at Oklahoma.
Both of Martin's first two units
are considered almost equal in
ability, but surprisingly the sec
ond unit has piled up seven touch
downs to only five for the first
team.
Good Quarterbacks
The Falcons are fortunate in
having two fine quarterbacks to
lead the units in John Kuenzel
and John Mayo of Eureka, Calif.
Another California boy, Steve
Galios from Napa, is an impor
tant cog in the Falcon offense.
Galios, an 184-pound senior half-
back, is extremely quick. His
sophomore year he averaged 6.8
yards per carry.
In hopes of containing this
strong Falcon attack Stanford
coach Jack Curtice has his squad
working at the same rugged pace
that featured the practices before
last week's victory.
As this week's practice at Stan
ford pulled into its second day
Coach Curtice attempted to ex
periment with three halfbacks in
hopes that he can find a capable
alternate for Rick McMillen. Mc-
Millen, who played a great game
last week, was forced to go prac
tically the whole way. If an am
ple substitute could be found to
spell McMillen for short rests
now and then, there's no telling
how well he could do.
Three Prospects
The three backs who hope to
work into that halfback spot are
Skip Face, Tom Williams and
John Bessey. Face, who currently
is doing the place kicking for the
squad, had a standout career as
a high school back in San Marino.
Unfortunately a back injury
slowed him down the last two
years, but he has a strong chance
to be the ample fill-in.
Williams has been all over the
Stanford backfield this year. He
reported as a quarterback but
was soon moved to halfback.
