We are concerned with the
needs of modern industry, tech
nology and economics, hut not
with the needs of men, said Jo
seph Wood Kruteh last evening
in the final lecture of the West
Memorial series. Know-how has

replaced wisdom, he asserted.
The needs of men can only be
discovered in an examination of
the nature of man, Krutch ex
plained, warning that the nature
of man can only be inferred, not
defined. "Human nature is very
plastic, but not infinitely so."
Krutch referred to his previous
citation of the capacity to make
value judgments as a fundamen
tal characteristic of human na
ture. "Man is a creature who
tends to want more than the ma
terial," he proposed as a second
characteristic.
Further lines of inquiry into
the nature of man might be: the
problems of whether men desire
justice, not merely their own in
terests, and whether men need a
"natural" environment, Krutch
suggested.
He emphasized that we should
not be concerned over disagree
ments about the nature of man
nearly so much as a refusal to be
lieve that inquiry into man's na
ture is meaningful.
The behavior of man has been
exhaustively investigated in our
century, but. not the nature of
man, he pointed out. If we have
achieved what we thought we
wanted and are still "anxious" in
our age, then perhaps we ought
to ask again what we want, he
added. "If we ever want a new
world we will have to find a faith
that will make it."
