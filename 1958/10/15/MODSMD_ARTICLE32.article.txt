# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Conklin, senior letter-winner,
was one of the Card stalwarts
in lasts week's upset win over
Washington. His recovery of a
Husky fumble on the UW 20-
yard line led to Stanford's third
and clinching TD. A part-time
starter in 1956, he missed all
last year with injuries.

Injuries have been the big
gest menace to Roy's grid ca
reer at Stanford. In his first,
two varsity seasons, he totaled
less than five minutes and was
granted an extra year of eligi
bility by the Pacific Coast Con
ference. A driving runner and
excellent defender.
