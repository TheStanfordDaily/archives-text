# Space Probers Confident Moon Can Be Reached
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —U.S. space probers are more confident than
ever that they can reach the moon. They may try again early next
month.
Although no official date has been set for a new moon shot, there
were reports that the next rocket may be launched at Cape Cana-

veral, Fla., between Nov. 8 and
11. During that period the moon
will swing closer to earth than at
any other time in its 28-day orbit.
The Air Force directed last
weekend's spectacular shot which
sent Pioneer — the first moon
bound rocket to clear the earth's
atmosphere — 79,120 miles into
space. After losing speed, Pio
neer turned back and disintegrat
ed in the atmosphere over the
South Pacific early Monday.
Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schrie
ver, chief of the Air Force Ballis
tics Missile Division, said he
could not disclose just when an
other rocket would be sent aloft.
But he added: "I can assure you
we're not going to waste any
time."
In a Los Angeles dispatch, the
Now York Times said the Air
Force is reported to have received
authority for two additional
space probes early next year.
One, the newspaper said, may be
an attempt to obtain scientific
data in the vicinity of Venus.
Venus and the earth come with
in 26 million miles of each other
in the closest approach on their
orbits around the sun.
Pioneer soared one-third of the
distance to the moon, which at
the near point of its orbit is about
221,500 miles away.
The Pentagon's Advance Re
search Projects Agency said it in
structed the Air Force some time
ago to provide two Thor - Able
rocket combinations for some un
specified future investigation.
But officials declined comment
on the report the rockets might
be used for possible shots toward
the planet Venus.

MOON ROCKET PIONEER RE ENTERS ATMOSPHERE
Next attempt to probe moon —Nov. 12
WASHINGTON (/P) —U.S. space probers are more confident than
ever that they can reach the moon. They may try again early next
month.
Although no official date has been set for a new moon shot, there
were reports that the next rocket may be launched at Cape Cana-

veral, Fla., between Nov. 8 and
11. During that period the moon
will swing closer to earth than at
any other time in its 28-day orbit.
The Air Force directed last
weekend's spectacular shot which
sent Pioneer — the first moon
bound rocket to clear the earth's
atmosphere — 79,120 miles into
space. After losing speed, Pio
neer turned back and disintegrat
ed in the atmosphere over the
South Pacific early Monday.
Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schrie
ver, chief of the Air Force Ballis
tics Missile Division, said he
could not disclose just when an
other rocket would be sent aloft.
But he added: "I can assure you
we're not going to waste any
time."
In a Los Angeles dispatch, the
Now York Times said the Air
Force is reported to have received
authority for two additional
space probes early next year.
One, the newspaper said, may be
an attempt to obtain scientific
data in the vicinity of Venus.
Venus and the earth come with
in 26 million miles of each other
in the closest approach on their
orbits around the sun.
Pioneer soared one-third of the
distance to the moon, which at
the near point of its orbit is about
221,500 miles away.
The Pentagon's Advance Re
search Projects Agency said it in
structed the Air Force some time
ago to provide two Thor - Able
rocket combinations for some un
specified future investigation.
But officials declined comment
on the report the rockets might
be used for possible shots toward
the planet Venus.
