SACRAMENTO (/P) — "Bath
ing suits permitted but not re
quired. Please do not use this
part of beach if it will offend
you."
The Stale Park Commission
is due to decide at its meeting
in Riverside Friday whether
this sign will go up—and swim
ming suits off —on part of a
state beach near Santa Cruz.
The American Sunbathing
Association, who s e members
prefer bathing sans suits, have
asked the commission to set off
a portion of the beach for their
use — and anyone else who
wants a complete sun tan.
