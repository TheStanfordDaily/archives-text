# Thief Steals Greek Coins, Rare Jewels
## 
### 
Stanford police are investigat
ing an unusual theft of Greek
coins and rare Greek jewelry
items from the Stanford Museum,
Ghief Gordon Davis has disclosed.
The date of the theft has not
been determined, said Davis, be
cause the display cases the items
were taken from were not dam
aged. Apparently the theft oc
curred sometime during the last
few weeks.
The missing coins are of fairly
recent vintage and are not con
sidered of high value, said Davis,
but the missing jewelry pieces are
irreplaceable collectors' items and
have no definite value. Other less
valuable items in the same cases
were not taken, reported Davis.
The missing items were taken
from two museum cases, and po
lice are investigating how the
cases were opened. They were
not pried open, Davis said.
It is a matter of opinion what
these items are worth, said Davis,
but apparently the thief knew
what he wanted.
An inventory is being conduct
ed by museum officials to deter
mine the exact items taken.
