# UAR, Tunisia Sever Relations
## 
### 
TUNIS (/P)-â€”Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with the United
Arab Republic Wednesday in a bitter feud that is expected to have
repercussions throughout the Arab world.
It was a clear test of strength between pro-Western President
Habib Bourguiba and President Nasser of the U.A.R.

Tunisia has accused Nasser of
meddling in its internal affairs
and harboring mortal enemies of
Bourguiba. But no note on the
diplomatic break was made pub
lic, and no reason was given im
mediately.
The dispute, however, is expect
ed to get a public airing Thursday
when Bourguiba addresses the
National Assembly in what has
been described as a major speech.
A Defiant Action
The Jit tie North African coun
try, which won its independence
from France only 2Va years ago,
took its defiant action against the
bigger, more powerful U.A.R.
after an angry exchange in Cairo
Saturday at a meeting of the
Arab League.
The Tunisian delegate, Ilabib
El-Chatty, had accused the U.A.R.
of trying to dominate the smaller
countries and particularly of giv
ing shelter to enemies of Bourgui
ba. The U.A.R. delegation walked
out of the meeting. So did the
Tunisians.
Besides striking a sharp blow
at Arab political unity, the Tuni
sian move may have a preponder
ant influence on the course of the
four-year-old rebellion in Algeria,
next door to Tunisia.
Bourguiba vs. Nasser
The Algerian government - in
exile has been shifting between
Cairo and Tunis. The break in re
lations now may force Algerian
rebel Premier Ferhat Abbas to
choose between the two capitals.
If he should install himself in
Tunis he would come under the
more moderate influence of Bour
guiba and escape from the anti-
Western extremism of Nasser.
He may choose Tunis because Tu
nisia is a vital supply base for
Algerian rebels fighting the
French.
Bourguiba is actively seeking to
line up the support of Morocco's
King Mohamed V iir the Arab
power struggle.
At stake is the Maghreb or un
ion of North African states which
Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are
in the process of forming.
The Tunisian president is pic
tured as fearful of Nasser's at
tempting to control the Maghreb
as lie has the Arab countries of
the Middle East.
