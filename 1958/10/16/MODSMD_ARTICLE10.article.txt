vice - premier, was hailed widely
by Lebanese politicians and the
press.
The night curfew remained in
force but Karami said he hoped
to lift it soon. He put police pa
trols on the streets to hurry the
peace - making process as dissi

barricades and shops reopened.
The Christian President Fuad
Chehab decreed an extraordinary
session of Parliament beginning
Wednesday and extending
through Oct. 20. Speaker Adel
Osseiran set the confidence vote
for Friday morning.
There was still some question
whether the .1700 U.S. troops re
