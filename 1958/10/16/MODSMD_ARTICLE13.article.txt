# Golden Spike Still Safe Alter Attempted Theft
## Police Find Safe Damaged, Pitted Glass 
### Doug Willis 
An apparently well planned hat
unsuccessful attempt to steal the
historic gold railroad spike from
the Stanford Museum was re
vealed by the Stanford Police De
partment Wednesday.
The spike, valued at $600, was
driven by Senator Stan I' or d in
Utah in 18G9 to complete the first
transcontinental railroad, and it
is on permanent display in a spe
cially designed glass-fronted safe
in the Stanford Museum.
The attempted theft of the
spike came to light yesterday
when deputies from the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office be
gan their investigation of the
theft of valuable jewelry and
coins from the museum.
Jewelry Theft Tied In
Damage to the safe, which mu
seum officials had previously at
tributed to vandalism, was then
tied into the jewelry theft and po
lice surmised that they occurred
at the same time.
Scratches and a % - inch - deep
cut had been made in the four
inch-thick bullet-proof glass fronl
of the safe. Police discovered
that hinges and the lock had also
been tampered with.
It was revealed Tuesday tha 1
partially gold Greek coins and
jewelry, valued at $2100, had been
stolen from the museum prior to
the beginning of fall quarter.
Stanford police have been qui
etly conducting a preliminary in
vestigation of the jewelry and
coin theft since Oct. 5, when it
came to the attention of museum
officials. Specialists from the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Of
fice were called in by the Stan
ford police to supplement the in
vestigation.
Pictures Circulated
Pictures have been circulated
of the jewelry.
The thief displayed particular
care in stealing the jewelry and
coins and did "very neat" work
on the coin case, detectives said,
but the attempt at the safe was
"very amateurish."
Police suppose that the thief
somehow entered the museum at
night.
The thief apparently removed
six screws from the case contain
ing the coins, and then carefully
replaced them exactly as they
were before.
But apparently a sharp instru
ment was used in the futile at
tempt to break through the thick
safety galss. Scratches and the
dime-sized pit dug into the glass
were probably made by a long
punch and a hammer.
This is the only successful theft
from the Stanford Museum in
more than 30 years.

The thief displayed particular
care in stealing the jewelry and
coins and did "very neat" work
on the coin case, detectives said,
but the attempt at the safe was
"very amateurish."
Police suppose that the thief
somehow entered the museum at
night.
The thief apparently removed
six screws from the case contain
ing the coins, and then carefully
replaced them exactly as they
were before.
But apparently a sharp instru
ment was used in the futile at
tempt to break through the thick
safety galss. Scratches and the
dime-sized pit dug into the glass
were probably made by a long
punch and a hammer.
This is the only successful theft
from the Stanford Museum in
more than 30 years.

at the Stanford Museum shows a dime-sized hole in the four-inch
bullet-proof glass. Presumably the attempt to shatter the glass
was made by driving a sharp instrument into the glass with a
hammer.

An apparently well planned hat
unsuccessful attempt to steal the
historic gold railroad spike from
the Stanford Museum was re
vealed by the Stanford Police De
partment Wednesday.
The spike, valued at $600, was
driven by Senator Stan I' or d in
Utah in 18G9 to complete the first
transcontinental railroad, and it
is on permanent display in a spe
cially designed glass-fronted safe
in the Stanford Museum.
The attempted theft of the
spike came to light yesterday
when deputies from the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office be
gan their investigation of the
theft of valuable jewelry and
coins from the museum.
Jewelry Theft Tied In
Damage to the safe, which mu
seum officials had previously at
tributed to vandalism, was then
tied into the jewelry theft and po
lice surmised that they occurred
at the same time.
Scratches and a % - inch - deep
cut had been made in the four
inch-thick bullet-proof glass fronl
of the safe. Police discovered
that hinges and the lock had also
been tampered with.
It was revealed Tuesday tha 1
partially gold Greek coins and
jewelry, valued at $2100, had been
stolen from the museum prior to
the beginning of fall quarter.
Stanford police have been qui
etly conducting a preliminary in
vestigation of the jewelry and
coin theft since Oct. 5, when it
came to the attention of museum
officials. Specialists from the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Of
fice were called in by the Stan
ford police to supplement the in
vestigation.
