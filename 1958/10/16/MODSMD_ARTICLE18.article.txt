## Athletic Attitudes 
### 
S'l\ M'OHD's Department of Physical Fducat ion has petitioned llu*
A SSL I ,egislat lire to make some much-needed changes in the Stan
lord Athletic Code as outlined in the ASSU hyl aws.
This petition calls lor changes reflecting new attitudes toward
snorts: good and had attitudes.
For some reason, our particular society has seen lit to frown
upon the wearing of varsitv letter sweaters. I hough once a symbol
of achievement. they have now become a cue for ridicule.
11 is discouraging to consider that in such a society, where
achievement motive lead- to such a hijjch decree of drive and
ambition, one tvpe of achiever is restricted in his attempt to he
proud of an accomplishment.
The athlete may not wear his letter sweater, although it does
indicate that a considerable number of hard-worked hours have
been invested in a particular activity â€”and this along with study
hours sufficient to reflect a qualifying academic grade.
The scholar, though, may flount his Phi Beta Kappa
ke\ and excite oohs and abbs from the same society which
chastises tin* athlete for ostensibly the same thing. And
ibis achievement may at times reflect little more than con
centrated studv in a world where "well-roundedness is an
essential.
True, the problem is not peculiar to Stanford, though it is not
widespread. Stanford, however, has seen fit to do something
about it. something commendable.
Feeding that the sum expended for an inappropriate award
could better be channeled into a more appreciated or useful
award, the Department of Physical Education has substituted a
block "S" ring to be awarded in place of the old sweater.
Stanford athletes, we feel, are coining out of this problem
better ofT. The new award is more permanent, more attractive.
Ii will be something they can proudly wear. We invite them to
wear the new rings that way, despite a certain degree of unappre
ciativeness we feel is bound to he reflected in certain members of
the student body.
Overlooked when discussion of the Athletic Code change
is mentioned is still another important part of the petition.
Perhaps this is even a more significant part of it.
No longer will Stanford athletics he classified "major'" and
"minor" sports. The main reason behind this move is a desire
lo do awav a class structuring of participants rather than sports.
We feel this is an important move, a necessary and too long
in-coming move.
It is difficult, rather impossible, to classify a sport "major or
"minor." If the classification is made from revenue or attendance
figures, this is no basis.
Serious participation in athletics means a great deal of work
for any man in anv sport. A man chooses the sport he wishes
to compete in: to him it is a major sport. For outstanding per
formance in this sport, carried on iu the name of the I diversity,
he deserves as much credit as anv man in any other sport.
