# University Exists To Serve Tradition
## 
### Alexander Miller Professor or Religion 
There can be—in fact there has
been— such a thing as a Univer
sity without any students. It is
not a consummation devoutly to
be desired, though at odd mo
ments the faculty may think so:
but in Great Britain during
Work! War 11, for example, there
were universities in which the
flow of students to all intents
and purposes dried up. The Uni
versity did not forthwith shut up
shop. The faculty went on with
its work, having the character of
a Guild of Scholars, for the time
being without any apprentices.
I'm not sure that this proves any
thing very final, since over a long
pull every guild does need ap
prentices. In any event it de
pends on more adequate endow
ments than any American uni
versity can claim. If it does prove
anything it is that the University
does not exist for the sake of the
students. Students are. at least
over the short run, dispensable,
though they are entirely welcome
when they come around. But
they are welcome on conditions:
the condition, chiefly, that they
earn their keep and justify the
time they take by applying them
selves to the work of learning
the scholar's trade.
Needs Faculty
The University does not exist
for the sake of the students. It
can get along, at least in principle
it' not in permanant practice,
without them. The University
cannot get along without faculty,
unless it is argued that you have
in the library a congealed stock
of learning, a sort of fresh-frozen

i faculty. But the University does
! not exist for the sake of its fac
ulty. They too have to justify
j their existence by reference to
something which is bigger than
both of us—more substantial and
less dispensable than either stu
dents or faculty. And I do not
mean the American way of life,
or even Democracy—unless it be
! what Chesterton called "the de
mocracy of the dead" rather than
of those few who "simply happen
; to be walking about."
Serves Tradition
The University does not exist
! for the sake of any part of it, or
for the sake of anything extrin
! sic to itself, but for the service of
ja tradition (a live word and not
a dead one) out of which the Uni
versity itself was born. The
University's business is to appro
priate, improve and transmit the
heritage of wisdom — humanly
; speaking because life is impov
| Qrished without it, Christianly
speaking because it is the gift of
j God.
The University experience
properly begins when this is un
derstood and to understand it
often takes something analogous
to a religious conversion. For we
all tend to begin by asking, of the
University experience as of every
thing else: "What's in it for me?"
i We are on the way to being citi
zens of the Republic of Letters,
craftsmen and apprentices worth
I our place in a Guild of Scholars,
when we ask instead: "What's in
me for it?" "Do I have the mental
stamina, the spiritual and intel
lectual guts it takes to undergo
| the rigors of the scholarly life, to
| walk worthy of the scholarly vo
-1 cation wherewith I am called?"
