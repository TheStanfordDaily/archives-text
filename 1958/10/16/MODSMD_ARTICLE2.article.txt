# Row Discontinues Annual Carnival
## 
### 
The Row Carnival, originally
scheduled for Friday night, has
been canceled. According to Sue
Solomon, social chairman of the
row, the carnival was rather un
successful last year and no one
seemed interested in repeating it.
Although a large amount of
money was taken in, the costs
were so high that there was little
profit.
The row intends to sponsor
some other money-raising project
this year although plans for it are
not yet definite.
