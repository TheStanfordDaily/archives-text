"To Win the Minds of Men," by
Peter Grot he. Stanford graduate
and teaching assistant in political
science, has been published re
cently by Pacific Books.
Theme of the book is that the
winning of the minds of men is
the "most important business of
the 20th century, and that Amer
ica, the greatest advertising coun
try in the world, is losing the
propaganda war."
The book describes the Com
munist propaganda war in East
Germany and its effect on the
people there. Grothe attempts to
explain what America can do to
regain the propaganda advantage.
Grothe lived two years in Ber
lin and has made trips into East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and the
Soviet Union.
Professor Frank Freidel of the
H ar v a r d History Department,
formerly of Stanford, commented,
"It is seldom that a young man
combines so successfully the at
tributes of journalist and scholar
as has Grothe in writing this
book."
