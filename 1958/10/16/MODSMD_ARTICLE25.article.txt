The AAUW . . . Oh, Well
Last Friday's sports page devotees were treatetd to a rather brief
hui quite outstanding column by Sports Editor Steve Baffrey which
not so playfully tore to pieces the Berkeley-hatched alibi which is
by now more comical than it is ridiculous.
The replies that most certainly may come drifting in over Steve's
"East Bay Wind" should prove most interesting. But if Berkeleyites
use their better judgment, they might us well keep their mouths shut
. . . because there's no room for any more feet in them anyway.
Believe me, we understand why Cal and UCLA and Southern Cal
and Washington want to run off and form their own conference.
(Known by the quite assuming title of ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION
OF WESTERN UNIVERSITIES.) And any realist in the Northwest,
sans tho brainwashed Seattle area . . . which is in on it anyway,
understands, too. We really can't blame them. So, it's OK. OK, but
unfortunate.
Actually, it was pretty much inevitable;. The population-enroll
ment factor made it that way, since the four break-away schools have
enrollments well into five figures and Stanford and Oregon State
lead the rest with barely 8000. Oregon and Washington State are
back unedr 6000 and Idaho's enrollment totals less than 4000.
OUT OF PLACE VANDALS: Idaho never belonged in this con
ference. Its "full vote" and three loop football games particularly
irked the big shots. And in recent years the Vandals have enjoyed
some of their greatest football teams, but unfortunately for them,
likewise have those three traditional opponents: OSC, Oregon and
VVSC. The Vandals can't win for losing. With its small enrollment,
Idaho would have been very much at home . . . and on equal terms
... in the Skyline Conference, where each year two or three clubs
fall before the Vandals.
No, we can hardly blame the rebels for running off with their
football stadiums, seeing they want things their own way. They
like money. They make money in their big stadiums: 102,000 for
UCLA and USC, 80,000 for Cal and 55,000 for Washington. They don't
make money playing in the sub-25,000-seat homes of OSC, Oregon
and WS(I. N'o matter' how tough the Northerners get to be, UCLA
could draw more to a traditional with Cal or USC, no matter how
weak those teams are. (One win apiece last year.)
Liking money is just fine, being an all-too-common human char
acteristic. Certainly, dear Californians, we understand your wanting
to take off. Most everyone does. We don't necessarily approve, but
we understand.
So why in the world must you try to force this absurdity about
the purity and beauty of this new "federation" down our throats?
Come On, Let IJs Make the Rules
We know why you and your buddies were penalized, Cal. And this
is why you pulled out. Same reason. PCC codes were particularly
distasteful, sxÂ» we'll take our ball and go home ami make our own
rules. There was nothing unsound about the codes of the old PCC.
The only thing that was unsound, in football, was the poor popula
tion balance of the league. That couldn't be helped.
WHY' FOOTBALL? It is unfortunate that football is deemed so
far above the other sports. When we come to basketball, the shoe
changes feet. The population and enrollment figures stay the same,
but the size of the arenas most certainly does not.
A Southland superiority in basketball has never been clearly es
tablished, as a look at the nearly equal balance of loop crowns will
show. And only California of the southern schools (Stanford in
cluded) can boast of a basketball pavilion anywhere near large.
(Cal's gym might be laughed at in many parts of the Northwest.)
USC and UCLA have had no home floor of their own. The Bruins'
Westwood gym was condemned some time ago, and their great teams
of several years back played home games on a high school floor.
This is BIG TIME athletics?
So, (Cal and buddies), what if Oregon State had trotted off with
its Coliseum of 11,000 seats, or Oregon with its gym of 10,000? Even
WSC and Idaho push 6000. They like money, too, you know. And
how is the new ally, Washington, going to take to this association
of small gyms? The Huskies have a 13,000-seat pavilion.
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS: But how did the Huskies get in there
in the first place? The Seattle motives for tagging along can be
narrowed down to one, just like the rest. The Huskies' football
schedule for the next six years has not changed in the least from
what it is now. OSC, Oregon and WSC ... all big draw games for
the Huskies . . . are still on the schedule, and even Idaho reappears
next year. The new "association" teams are there, as in the past,
and so is Stanford and an intersectional or two. Nothing different.
If the University of Washington Daily opens its mouth like the
Daily Cal so foolishly did, it might be an all-time high for absurdity.
We give the UW writers credit for a good deal more sense than that,
for il would take a truly magnificent piece of propaganda to convince
anyone but themselves that Washington isn't breaking away for any
other reason than to take off merrily into the no-holds-barred recruit
ing wars. I Where they have practiced for years already.)
Things weren't all complacent in the Northwest this summer.
Seattle's press found little sympathy among its colleagues of the
area. It was the sum of the opinion of the Portland (Oregon-OSC)
and Spokane (WSC-Idaho) scribes that: Washington should try to
establish something resembling consistent superiority over its out
cast neighbors (with less than half Washington's enrollment) before
launching into a high-sounding entanglement with their fellow rebels
(with equal or larger enrollments).
IT'LL BE FUN TO WATCH: At any rate, the Athletic Associa
tion of Western Universities, even if it by some chance would be
come Stanford's conference, should prove a most interesting attempt
at rules-at-a-minimum organization. But the only difference for the
rebels between a loss to Michigan State, Notre Dame or Oklahoma
and a loss to Oregon State, Oregon or Washington State will be . . .
there will be more fans there to see it.
