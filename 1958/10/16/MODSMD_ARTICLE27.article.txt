# Air Force Displays Top Offense
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORT SCENE 
### 
Ever since the Detroit Lions:
| won the National Football Con-'
ference last year with the aid of
two able quarterbacks, Bobby
Layne and Tobin Rote, it seems
to be the style among the pros to
be fortified with two able quar
terbacks just to insure the con
sistency of the offense.
It appears this year that this
two - quarterback idea has been
(•all ied over into college football
circles at least at the Air Force
Academy.
The Falcons have come up with ;

two very fine quarterbacks. The
starting quarterback is Johnny
Kuenzel, a rangy 6-foot two-inch
junior from St. Mary's, Ohio.

Kuenzel, a southpaw thrower,
has completed 18 passes in 28 at
tempts this year for 1(58 yards
and a very impressive 64 per cent
completion record.
Just in case things don't go so
well for Mr. Kuenzel, the Falcons
have Jimmy Mayo, a very quick
and agile sophomore, to come to
the rescue. Actually Mayo is the
quarterback for the Academy's
second unit which has piled up
more points than the first unit.
Mayo personally has accounted
for four touchdowns while hitting
on 20 of 34 passing attempts.
These 20 completions have ac
counted for 274 yards and these
combined with Kuenzel's 168
place the Air Force Academy

ninth in the nation in passing.
Just to make things tough on
the defensive baekfield the Fal
cons have a whole host of top re
ceivers to haul in these passes.
Of the 40 pass receptions for the
Falcons this year, 20 have been
grabbed off by backs and 20 by
ends, and in no game have fewer
than eight men caught passes.
The one outstanding receiver,
however, is sophomore end Bob
Brick e y who has nabbed 20
passes.
As a running team the Falcons
rank even higher than they do in
passing. So far this season they
have averaged 2.77 yards on the
ground, placing them seventh in
the nation in this department.

passes.
As a running team the Falcons
rank even higher than they do in
passing. So far this season they
have averaged 2.77 yards on the
ground, placing them seventh in
the nation in this department.
Ever since the Detroit Lions:
| won the National Football Con-'
ference last year with the aid of
two able quarterbacks, Bobby
Layne and Tobin Rote, it seems
to be the style among the pros to
be fortified with two able quar
terbacks just to insure the con
sistency of the offense.
It appears this year that this
two - quarterback idea has been
(•all ied over into college football
circles at least at the Air Force
Academy.
The Falcons have come up with ;

two very fine quarterbacks. The
starting quarterback is Johnny
Kuenzel, a rangy 6-foot two-inch
junior from St. Mary's, Ohio.

Kuenzel, a southpaw thrower,
has completed 18 passes in 28 at
tempts this year for 1(58 yards
and a very impressive 64 per cent
completion record.
Just in case things don't go so
well for Mr. Kuenzel, the Falcons
have Jimmy Mayo, a very quick
and agile sophomore, to come to
the rescue. Actually Mayo is the
quarterback for the Academy's
second unit which has piled up
more points than the first unit.
Mayo personally has accounted
for four touchdowns while hitting
on 20 of 34 passing attempts.
These 20 completions have ac
counted for 274 yards and these
combined with Kuenzel's 168
place the Air Force Academy

ninth in the nation in passing.
Just to make things tough on
the defensive baekfield the Fal
cons have a whole host of top re
ceivers to haul in these passes.
Of the 40 pass receptions for the
Falcons this year, 20 have been
grabbed off by backs and 20 by
ends, and in no game have fewer
than eight men caught passes.
The one outstanding receiver,
however, is sophomore end Bob
Brick e y who has nabbed 20
passes.
