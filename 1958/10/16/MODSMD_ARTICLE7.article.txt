# Civil Agency May Absorb Army Space-Missile Labs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P> President Eisenhower indicated Wednesday
it may be some time before he decides whether 1 to let the new civilian
space agency skim off the cream of the Army's space talent and in
stallations.
The final decision will be his, Eisenhower told his news conference.

But the question, he s;tid, has not
come before him yet and won't
until it's studied.
The reported plan to break up
the Army's space-missile team,
built around a group of German
scientists who came here after
World War II, brought cries of
protests from the scientists them
selves. One predicted mass resig
nations if the plan is carried out.
Officials said Tuesday night Dr.
Keith Glennan, administrator of
the new space agency, had asked
Secretary of the Army Brucker
to turn over about 2100 missile
scientists and engineers employed
at Redstone Arsenal at Hunts
ville, Ala. They said he also asked
the Army to surrender the entire
facilities and personnel of its Jet
Propulsion Laboratory at Los An
geles.
The No. 1 U.S. space scientist,
Dr. Wernher von Braun, director
of the Army Ballistic Missile Ag
ency at Redstone, commented:
"It would seem something less
than prudent to risk the dissolu
tion of such an asset at a time
when the national security and
prestige demand a unified effort
to achieve and maintain suprem
acy in rocket and space technol
