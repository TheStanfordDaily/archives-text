le world's most famous axe will go
back into the Cellar case from
which it was stolen two years ago,
but with an improved burglar
alarm.
Much of the credit for finally
getting The Axe out whore we
can see it goes to the Axe Society,
custodians of the famed trophy,
and to the society's energetic pres
ident, Chuck White, who was the
moving force in getting the facts
on which the decision was made.
The only questions that came
in for much debate were WHERE
and WHEN The Axe should be
shown.
Location Narrowed
The choice of location narrowed
down to the Main Library or The
Cellar, after Hoover Tower was
discarded because of the many
irreplaceable documents it con
tains. Installation cost in The .Cel
lar is only $25, because the case is
already there. To move it to the
Library would cost $250; so the
decision was mainly a monetary
one.
The alarm itself, owned by Cali
fornia Burglar Alarm Co., costs
$85.80 to install, with a yearly
maintenance cost of $158.88 — in
years when Stanford possesses
The Axe, nothing when it does
not.
After Legislature appropriated
$280 rait of its contingency fund,
it came to the question of when
to start showing The Axe. The
decision was reached to sign the
contract for the alarm after Big
Game, if we won it, because (1)
it would cost $25 to unbolt The
Axe from its wall for showing at:
Big Game, and (2) it would delay
the expenditure of the $280 to a
future year, even though the mon
ey had already been appropriated
from this year's contingency fund.
Now Alarm System
The new alarm system guaran
tees that a police officer will be
on the scene within one to five
minutes of the first tampering
with the case. Bulletproof glass
will shield the trophy, and The
Axe itself as well as the plaque
which holds it will be bolted into
solid cement.
This new warning system guar
antees protection against the way
in which The Axe was last stolen
heating the bulletproof glass,
Ihen throwing cold water on it—
by placing sensitive tin-foil strips
in the glass panel.

to start showing The Axe. The
decision was reached to sign the
contract for the alarm after Big
Game, if we won it, because (1)
it would cost $25 to unbolt The
Axe from its wall for showing at:
Big Game, and (2) it would delay
the expenditure of the $280 to a
future year, even though the mon
ey had already been appropriated
from this year's contingency fund.
Now Alarm System
The new alarm system guaran
tees that a police officer will be
on the scene within one to five
minutes of the first tampering
with the case. Bulletproof glass
will shield the trophy, and The
Axe itself as well as the plaque
which holds it will be bolted into
solid cement.
This new warning system guar

in which The Axe was last stolen

by placing sensitive tin-foil strips
in the glass panel.

le world's most famous axe will go

alarm.
Much of the credit for finally
getting The Axe out whore we
can see it goes to the Axe Society,
custodians of the famed trophy,

on which the decision was made.
The only questions that came
in for much debate were WHERE
and WHEN The Axe should be
shown.
Location Narrowed
The choice of location narrowed
down to the Main Library or The
Cellar, after Hoover Tower was
discarded because of the many
irreplaceable documents it con
tains. Installation cost in The .Cel
lar is only $25, because the case is
already there. To move it to the
Library would cost $250; so the
decision was mainly a monetary
one.
The alarm itself, owned by Cali
fornia Burglar Alarm Co., costs
$85.80 to install, with a yearly
maintenance cost of $158.88 — in
years when Stanford possesses
The Axe, nothing when it does
not.
