# Football Activities to Highlight Weekend as Thousands Arrive
## 39 Bands Will Present Formations At Half-Time Ceremonies Saturday 
### Camille Petersen Staff Editor 
The pageantry and color of the
British Grenadier Guards will be
matched if not surpassed when
2200 high school band musicians
and 170 majorettes take the field
during half-time at the football
game Saturday to present the
fourth annual Stanford High
School Band Day.
Thirty-nine bands, ranging in
size from the 97-piece Ceres High
School unit to the 30-piece West
more High School Band from
Daly City, will perform.
Students from Eureka, the most
distant school to be represented,
will arrive tonight and not leave
for their home until Sunday eve
ning.
In contrast, Palo Alto High
School Band will form at their
own band house and simply
march across the street to take
part in the pageant.

Saturday's half - time forma
tions will be the most difficult as
yet undertaken by such a massed
company on the Stanford field,
according to band manager David
Korten. For the first time the
bands will move through several
formations on the field while
playing well-known marches.
One thousand instrumentalists
will outline the playing field
while two groups of 600 each
form formations on either side
of the 50-yard line. Two Stanford
Block "S's" and the playing of
"New Colonial March" open the
show.
Outline Field
The bands move into two huge
bells and play "Liberty Bell"
march and then form two crosses
which are accompanied by
"March Religiose." The show
closes with a salute to the United
States Air Force as the bands
form two gigantic jet bombers
and play the "Air Force March."
Since the first band day, more
and better bands have applied for
places in the program. Many are
deferred to the following year as
the quota is quickly filled. Par
ticipation is by invitation only.
The Athletic Department pays
the expenses of Band Day and fur
nishes the visiting students with
a supplement to their sack
lunches consisting of a hot dog,
frozen orange and candy bar. The
department arranges for moving
equipment and pre-game practice
facilities.
Responsibility for the stunts,
music and execution is in the
hands of tho Stanford Marching
Band and Kappa Kappa Psi, hon
orary band fraternity, and band
director Julius Shuehat.
I're-Game
A Stanford band member is as
signed to each visiting band to
see that iiis group has no trouble
in following the given directions
for such things as placement and
to answer questions of all kinds.
The 112-piece Stanford March
ing Band will present a salute to
the Air Force in its pre-game
show. For its entry onto the
field, half of the band will enter
from each end to a drum cadence
played from the 50-yard line. As

the two halves meet in the center
of the field they will break into
the letters USAF and play "Air
Force March."
They will then go into the
Axe formation playing "Stanford
Scalp Song" before going into the
regular formation of the national
anthem.
