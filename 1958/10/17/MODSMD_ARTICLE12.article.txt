# Card, Falcon Tilt Rated Even Up
## 
### John Anderson 
Stanford's toughest hat tic of
the year looms ahead this Satur
day when tho Cards try to con
tain the high-flying Falcons of
the Air Force Academy in Stan
ford Stadium.
The Indians who shocked ev
eryone last Saturday hy over
whelming Washington 22-12 have
had their most spirited practices
of the year this week. However,
injuries have kept Coach Jack
Curtice from getting his team to
gether.
Center Doug Pursell put on
pads for the first time yesterday.
Pursell's recurring muscle strain
won't keep him out of the game
but he still can't run hard.
Bob Nicolet, who most likely
will have the starting quarter
back position, missed the first
two days of practice because of a
wisdom tooth extraction. By
Saturday, however, it shouldn't
bother him.
It was the fine signal calling of
Nicolet which was instrumental
in Stanford's win last week and if
the lack of practice should ham
per the effectiveness of the sen
ior quarterback it could be disas
trous for the Indians.
Tomorrow's game will inaugu
rate the series between the Acad
emy and Stanford. But the game
will have a greater significance
than that. If the Indians come
out with a victory it will prove
that last Saturday's upset was no
fluke and that the Cards are in
deed a fine football team which
can't be counted out.
The Air Force of course will be
fighting just as hard for the win
