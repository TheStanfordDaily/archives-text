# Card, Falcon Tilt Rated Even Up
## 
### John Anderson 
Stanford's toughest hat tic of
the year looms ahead this Satur
day when tho Cards try to con
tain the high-flying Falcons of
the Air Force Academy in Stan
ford Stadium.
The Indians who shocked ev
eryone last Saturday hy over
whelming Washington 22-12 have
had their most spirited practices
of the year this week. However,
injuries have kept Coach Jack
Curtice from getting his team to
gether.
Center Doug Pursell put on
pads for the first time yesterday.
Pursell's recurring muscle strain
won't keep him out of the game
but he still can't run hard.
Bob Nicolet, who most likely
will have the starting quarter
back position, missed the first
two days of practice because of a
wisdom tooth extraction. By
Saturday, however, it shouldn't
bother him.
It was the fine signal calling of
Nicolet which was instrumental
in Stanford's win last week and if
the lack of practice should ham
per the effectiveness of the sen
ior quarterback it could be disas
trous for the Indians.
Tomorrow's game will inaugu
rate the series between the Acad
emy and Stanford. But the game
will have a greater significance
than that. If the Indians come
out with a victory it will prove
that last Saturday's upset was no
fluke and that the Cards are in
deed a fine football team which
can't be counted out.
The Air Force of course will be
fighting just as hard for the win
which will keep their undefeated
string going. This is the first
year that seniors on the squad
which puts them on equal
grounds with other institutions.
Rut the three years of previous
experience are paying off now.
The Falcons had no trouble in
overcoming Detroit; they tied a
strong lowa team 13-13 in a game
which saw the Hawkeyes come
from behind, and last week Colo
rado State fell 36-6.
Indians Can't Let Up
"We won't be able to let down
in this one," said assistant coach
Andy Everest, who did the scout
ing of Air Force last week against
Colorado State and the week be
fore against lowa. "If we let
them get the jump on us as
Washington did last week it will
be tough battling back."
The Falcons came out of the
Colorado State game without any
injuries and will be at full
strength Saturday. With two Fal
con platoons at full strength il
will be a battle for Stanford,
which just last weekend found a
first team that will click.

The Air Force runs a very wide
open, speedy offense with flanker
ends and backs. There is a man
in motion on every play. Accord
ing to Everest one series of plays
with a double wing and man in
motion is very reminiscent of the
Pop Warner teams of old. If the
Academy is near as effective at
running this type of play as were
the Stanford teams under War
ner then the Indians will have to
put on a better defensive effort
than last week.
Each platoon of the Air Force
is directed by a very able quar
terback. John Kuenzel leads the
first squad and Jim Mayo the sec
ond. Both are sophomores. In
the win over Colorado State
Kuenzel hit for nine straight
completions good for 102 yards.
The whole team racked up 464
yards total offense and 29 first
downs.
"We made a lot of errors
against Colorado State last Sat
urday," said Air Force coach Ben
Martin, but he was quick to add
that it was good when a team
could make mistakes and still
come out on the long end of the
score.

The Indians' new found defense
didn't get a chance to show its
effectiveness in stopping passes
against the Huskies last week.
The real test will be tomorrow.
Of course the Falcon defenders
will have no easy time of it in
containing the aerial game of Bob
Nicolet and the fine running of
Rick McMillen. The spectators on
Saturday can expect to see more
of the lateral series and tricky
pass patterns which crushed the
Huskies, with perhaps a few new
wrinkles.
Bui-ford Looks Good
Indian end Chris Burford
looked good in practice this week.
Against the Huskies he played 59
minutes and had several fine re
ceptions; being in top shape to
morrow could make it plenty
tough for the Falcon defenders.
Also of notice on the practice
field yesterday was the extra
point kicking of Pursell who was
putting them through the up
rights consistently. It looks as
though the Cards will have no dif
ficulty in the one-pointer depart
ment as the number one conver
sionist, Skip Face, is three for
three so far this year.

could make mistakes and still
come out on the long end of the
score.

The Indians' new found defense
didn't get a chance to show its
effectiveness in stopping passes
against the Huskies last week.
The real test will be tomorrow.
Of course the Falcon defenders
will have no easy time of it in
containing the aerial game of Bob
Nicolet and the fine running of
Rick McMillen. The spectators on
Saturday can expect to see more
of the lateral series and tricky
pass patterns which crushed the
Huskies, with perhaps a few new
wrinkles.
Bui-ford Looks Good
Indian end Chris Burford
looked good in practice this week.
Against the Huskies he played 59
minutes and had several fine re
ceptions; being in top shape to
morrow could make it plenty
tough for the Falcon defenders.
Also of notice on the practice
field yesterday was the extra
point kicking of Pursell who was
putting them through the up
rights consistently. It looks as
though the Cards will have no dif
ficulty in the one-pointer depart
ment as the number one conver
sionist, Skip Face, is three for
three so far this year.
Stanford's toughest hat tic of
the year looms ahead this Satur
day when tho Cards try to con
tain the high-flying Falcons of
the Air Force Academy in Stan
ford Stadium.
The Indians who shocked ev
eryone last Saturday hy over
whelming Washington 22-12 have
had their most spirited practices
of the year this week. However,
injuries have kept Coach Jack
Curtice from getting his team to
gether.
Center Doug Pursell put on
pads for the first time yesterday.
Pursell's recurring muscle strain
won't keep him out of the game
but he still can't run hard.
Bob Nicolet, who most likely
will have the starting quarter
back position, missed the first
two days of practice because of a
wisdom tooth extraction. By
Saturday, however, it shouldn't
bother him.
It was the fine signal calling of
Nicolet which was instrumental
in Stanford's win last week and if
the lack of practice should ham
per the effectiveness of the sen
ior quarterback it could be disas
trous for the Indians.
Tomorrow's game will inaugu
rate the series between the Acad
emy and Stanford. But the game
will have a greater significance
than that. If the Indians come
out with a victory it will prove
that last Saturday's upset was no
fluke and that the Cards are in
deed a fine football team which
can't be counted out.
The Air Force of course will be
fighting just as hard for the win
which will keep their undefeated
string going. This is the first
year that seniors on the squad
which puts them on equal
grounds with other institutions.
Rut the three years of previous
experience are paying off now.
The Falcons had no trouble in
overcoming Detroit; they tied a
strong lowa team 13-13 in a game
which saw the Hawkeyes come
from behind, and last week Colo
rado State fell 36-6.
Indians Can't Let Up
"We won't be able to let down
in this one," said assistant coach
Andy Everest, who did the scout
ing of Air Force last week against
Colorado State and the week be
fore against lowa. "If we let
them get the jump on us as
Washington did last week it will
be tough battling back."
The Falcons came out of the
Colorado State game without any
injuries and will be at full
strength Saturday. With two Fal
con platoons at full strength il
will be a battle for Stanford,
which just last weekend found a
first team that will click.

The Air Force runs a very wide
open, speedy offense with flanker
ends and backs. There is a man
in motion on every play. Accord
ing to Everest one series of plays
with a double wing and man in
motion is very reminiscent of the
Pop Warner teams of old. If the
Academy is near as effective at
running this type of play as were
the Stanford teams under War
ner then the Indians will have to
put on a better defensive effort
than last week.
Each platoon of the Air Force
is directed by a very able quar
terback. John Kuenzel leads the
first squad and Jim Mayo the sec
ond. Both are sophomores. In
the win over Colorado State
Kuenzel hit for nine straight
completions good for 102 yards.
The whole team racked up 464
yards total offense and 29 first
downs.
"We made a lot of errors
against Colorado State last Sat
urday," said Air Force coach Ben
Martin, but he was quick to add
that it was good when a team

con platoons at full strength il
will be a battle for Stanford,
which just last weekend found a
first team that will click.

The Air Force runs a very wide
open, speedy offense with flanker
ends and backs. There is a man
in motion on every play. Accord
ing to Everest one series of plays
with a double wing and man in
motion is very reminiscent of the
Pop Warner teams of old. If the
Academy is near as effective at
running this type of play as were
the Stanford teams under War
ner then the Indians will have to
put on a better defensive effort
than last week.
Each platoon of the Air Force
is directed by a very able quar
terback. John Kuenzel leads the
first squad and Jim Mayo the sec
ond. Both are sophomores. In
the win over Colorado State
Kuenzel hit for nine straight
completions good for 102 yards.
The whole team racked up 464
yards total offense and 29 first
downs.
"We made a lot of errors
against Colorado State last Sat
urday," said Air Force coach Ben
Martin, but he was quick to add
that it was good when a team
could make mistakes and still
come out on the long end of the
score.

The Indians' new found defense
didn't get a chance to show its
effectiveness in stopping passes
against the Huskies last week.
The real test will be tomorrow.
Of course the Falcon defenders
will have no easy time of it in
containing the aerial game of Bob
Nicolet and the fine running of
Rick McMillen. The spectators on
Saturday can expect to see more
of the lateral series and tricky
pass patterns which crushed the
Huskies, with perhaps a few new
wrinkles.
Bui-ford Looks Good
Indian end Chris Burford
looked good in practice this week.
Against the Huskies he played 59
minutes and had several fine re
ceptions; being in top shape to
morrow could make it plenty
tough for the Falcon defenders.
Also of notice on the practice
field yesterday was the extra
point kicking of Pursell who was
putting them through the up
rights consistently. It looks as
though the Cards will have no dif
ficulty in the one-pointer depart
ment as the number one conver
sionist, Skip Face, is three for
three so far this year.
Stanford's toughest hat tic of
the year looms ahead this Satur
day when tho Cards try to con
tain the high-flying Falcons of
the Air Force Academy in Stan
ford Stadium.
The Indians who shocked ev
eryone last Saturday hy over
whelming Washington 22-12 have
had their most spirited practices
of the year this week. However,
injuries have kept Coach Jack
Curtice from getting his team to
gether.
Center Doug Pursell put on
pads for the first time yesterday.
Pursell's recurring muscle strain
won't keep him out of the game
but he still can't run hard.
Bob Nicolet, who most likely
will have the starting quarter
back position, missed the first
two days of practice because of a
wisdom tooth extraction. By
Saturday, however, it shouldn't
bother him.
It was the fine signal calling of
Nicolet which was instrumental
in Stanford's win last week and if
the lack of practice should ham
per the effectiveness of the sen
ior quarterback it could be disas
trous for the Indians.
Tomorrow's game will inaugu
rate the series between the Acad
emy and Stanford. But the game
will have a greater significance
than that. If the Indians come
out with a victory it will prove
that last Saturday's upset was no
fluke and that the Cards are in
deed a fine football team which
can't be counted out.
The Air Force of course will be
fighting just as hard for the win
which will keep their undefeated
string going. This is the first
year that seniors on the squad
which puts them on equal
grounds with other institutions.
Rut the three years of previous
experience are paying off now.
The Falcons had no trouble in
overcoming Detroit; they tied a
strong lowa team 13-13 in a game
which saw the Hawkeyes come
from behind, and last week Colo
rado State fell 36-6.
Indians Can't Let Up
"We won't be able to let down
in this one," said assistant coach
Andy Everest, who did the scout
ing of Air Force last week against
Colorado State and the week be
fore against lowa. "If we let
them get the jump on us as
Washington did last week it will
be tough battling back."
