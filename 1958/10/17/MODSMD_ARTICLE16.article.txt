## THE 						POLITICAL EYE Three Propositions To Change Process 
### Leo Krulitz 
While the three "Hate Meas-1
ures," Propositions 16, 17 and 18, j
have received most of the pub
licity, there are three other prop
ositions that are of the utmost
importance to the state Legisla
ture as well as the state itself.
These are Propositions 5, 9 and
12, which would enact measures
to change the legislative process
and allow members of the Legis
lature to set their own salary.
Probably the biggest reason the
first 15 propositions haven't re
ceived as much attention as the
others is that these are referen
dums instead of initiatives. Ref
erendums are measures presented
to the people by the Legislature
for consideration, while initiatives |
are measures introduced by peo
ple through petition for consider-!
ation of the electorate.
Also included in the first 15 j
propositions are several proposed
constitutional amendments that
Ihe Legislature is submitting to
Ihe people for consideration.
Proposition 5, the measure
fhat would allow the legislators
to advance their salaries to a
figure equal to the average of
the salaries paid the county su
pervisors in the five most pop
ulous counties, is perhaps the
most controversial of the 15
propositions.
The state legislators now re- j
ceive an annual salary of $6000.
The maximum salary they would
be allowed to vote themselves
would be $10,800.
Legislators also receive by law ■
at present an expense account of j
$1S daily while in session and $20 :
daily for committee work. There 1
is also a travel allowance of 5 j
cents a mile for the trip to Sacra
mento and 15 cents per mile for
travel on state business.
Legislators and people support
ing Proposition 5 argue that the
reimbursements to the legislators
aren't sufficient to cover their ex- j
penses, let alone the loss of other
income while they serve in thej
Legislature. They say the busi- J
ness of the state has increased
and requires more of their time
lhan it has in years past.
Opponents argue that it would
be a basic fault to let the legis
lators set their own salary and
that it wouldn't be good business j
practice.
Proposition 9 would abolish
California's somewhat antiquat
ed "split-session" meeting of the
Legislature. Presently it meets
for 30 days and then recesses
for 30 days to "discuss pending

legislation that lias been intro
duced, with their constituents."
After this recess legislators may
not introduce more than two bills
without consent of three-fourths
of the House. Currently there are
many bills introduced during the
first session simply because the
legislator feels he "might" want
them enacted and wouldn't be
able to introduce them later.
Consequently many bills never
gel acted on, and the state must
still bear the cost of their print
ing. Proposition 9. according to
the legislators, would alleviate
this situation.
Proposition 12 would allow a
legislator to hold the position
of notary public. This would he
merely a convenience .for them
and help to conserve their time.
The remaining propositions are
primarily bond issues.
• Proposition 1 is a bond issue
calling for $300,000,000 to use for
loans to veterans who want to
purchase homes or farms.
• Proposition 2 is a bond issue
of $220,000,000 for loans to school
districts for building and remodel
ing schools.
• Proposition 3 provides for
bonds of $200,000,000, the funds
from which will be used ta con
struct state buildings, including
some at tire University of Cali
fornia.
• Proposition 4 is a harbor
development bond issue calling
for $60,000,000, of which $50,-
000,000 would be used in San
Francisco Harbor.
• Proposition 6 calls for news
paper advertising of bond issues.
• Proposition 7 provides for
state government in time of dis
aster.
• Proposition 8 would allow per
sons who have resided in the state
for 54 days the right to vote for
the U.S. President but not for
other officers until county and
precinct residence requirements
are met.
• Proposition 10 would give
school* districts or governments
operating airports the right to use
personal property while eminent
domain proceedings are going on.
• Proposition 11 would allow
cities to bond for construction
of roads.
• Proposition 13 would make
the office of superintendent of
public instruction an appointive
office instead of elective.
• Proposition 14 would allow
the Legislature to raise the sal
aries of local government officials
while they are in office.
• Proposition 15 would allow
boxing matches on Sunday.
