# ON OTHER CAMPI
## Group Activity? 
### Marilyn Moore 
Either students aren't star gaz
ing any more or they're doing it
on their own time. The Daily
Trojan reports only four men are
working for their A.B. degrees in
astronomy at USC. Maybe they
should start giving group activity
credit for it. . . .
Sadness prevails on the Univer
sity of Connecticut campus. Jon
athan collapsed at the annual pa
rade. Not only that, he had a
lemperature and a warm dry
nose. And so Jonathan will go
the way of all good huskies, and
ihe Connecticut football team
will be forced, for the first lime
in nine years, to got a new mas
cot. And this, seeing as how dogs
of 1 his type usually cost more
than $200, is creating a Major
problem. Rut if they think they
have troubles, they should pity
Ihe poor S.F. State team, the Alli
gators. They must REALLY have
trouble getting a mascot!
Seek Jokers
"Berkeley fire and police de
partments stepped up a hunt for
University 'Greek Row' practical
jokers who have been sending city
emergency vehicles and private
ambulances on false runs," states
the Daily Cal. Seems fire engines
have raced to the Fiji and Theta
Delt houses, among others, only
to find no sign of a fire, and a
false burglary was reported at
ihe ATO house. Perhaps the re
minder of a $1000 fine and/or a

year in jail for poisons caught
and convicted of making false re
ports will have some effect.
"Smokers" are being held at
Pembroke this fall. Now before
you start wondering, they are
meetings defined as "a special
way of acquainting freshmen
with the internal working of par
ticular student organizations," a
series of hrief looks into all of the
! campus organizations. Ah, well,
a rose by any other name, etc.,
etc.
Recounts Myth
A review worth quoting ap
peared in the U. of Akron Buch
telite of the article by John Dos
Passos in this month's copy of
"Esquire." Dos Passos recounts
the myth of James Dean and at
tributes the craze and the burst
of juvenile delinquency in the
post-war years to a common
; source.
"He | Dos Passos] does not ad
vocate swift punishment for er
ring youth, but neither does he
string along with Dr. Spock. He
places the blame on the egg-shell
I thin lives of this sixth decade of
the twentieth century and the
break-neck pace which brings ul
cers to forty-year-olds on Madison
Avenue. The speed and shallow
ness are part of the ceremony
the display of faith to ultra-mod
ern religion, Commercialism. (Ev
erybody, make the sign of the
$1.)"
