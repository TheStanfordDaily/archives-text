# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## The 						Position of Strength 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Most probably, Red China has
extended the ceasefire for an
other two weeks in order to pro
mote American negotiations with
Chiang for a disengagement at
Quemoy. The statement by the
official Communist news agency
does not say this. In fact, it calls
for a direct talk between the two
Chinese governmentsâ€”the Uniled
States excluded and ignored as an
interloper. But Peiping knows
perfectly well that the concrete
question is whether Chiang will
withdraw his troops from Que
moy, and that it is Washington,
not Peiping, which alone can per
suade him to do this.
The American policy is to per
suade him to bring his troops
back to Formosa when there is a
cease-fire. The Rod Chinese have
for the second time ordered a
cease - fire, manifestly because
they now expect us to make
moves to carry out our part of
the bargain.
Moreover, the Red Chinese
have accompanied the cease-fire
with strong intimations that their
military objective is Quemoy and
the offshore islands, not For
mosa, and that they do not have
military plans against Formosa
itself. These intimations, which
come from many quarters, are
meant to relieve the President of

any commitment to preserve Que-1
moy, since it is only in relation to ;
the defense of Formosa that he |
has any right or duty to intervene j
at Quemoy.
The crucial question for us is :
whether we should lake as- the
basis of our policy the proposi
tion that Formosa is separate
from the offshore islands. In
saying; that we should deal with
them separately, we do not
need to rely on what Peiping
has been saying - to neutral gov
ernments and perhaps in veiled
i language to us 1 . The conclusive
reason for believing that the
| Chinese Communists will not
attack Formosa is that they
lark any military capacity to at
! tack Formosa.
This is, as it used to be fash-1
ionable to say, a position of
strength upon which American
policy should be based. What is
the objective of our policy? In I
the last analysis it is to preserve |
Formosa's independence from the
mainland, to preserve it as an in
dependent center of non-Commu
nist culture and to keep it mili
tarily neutralized.
Even if it is not formally
agreed to, the United States
has the power to maintain a
two-China policy de facto. For
Mao cannot invade Formosa

and Chiang cannot invade the
mainland. In terms of the pow
er politics which underlie the
whole problem, a separate For
mosa, unentangled on the
mainland and its offshore is
lands, is l for the time being as
feasible as it' is desirable.
What is far from clear is
whether Formosa, which cannot
be conquered from the mainland,
will by an internal revolution de
cide to join the mainland. This is
what the Red Chinese are propos
ing, and all their hopes of absorb
ing Formosa rest on this idea.
In this disaster, brought on
by some kind of foolishness like
that at Quemoy, there would be
a deal by Chinese politicians
who have more to gain from
Peiping than from Washington.
If this is not to happen, it can
best be avoided by insisting that
Chiang concentrate on the devel
opment of Formosa, renouncing
his illusions about the mainland,
ceasing to waste his resources in
places like Quemoy, and then re
ducing his army to a size suitable
for the internal security of For
mosa itself. If that were to hap
pen, there might be a fair chance
that Formosa will maintain its
independence.
