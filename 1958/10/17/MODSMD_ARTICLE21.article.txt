As an example of a typical alio

given toward the completion of a
$45,000 student hostel in Karachi,
Pakistan. Karachi students were
encouraged by this gift and went

the money themselves with the
help of the World University
Service by requesting money
from their own government and
by holding fund-raising drives
both within and outside their own
university community.
