the hospital every other week.
The mental hospital volunteer
program has been met with the
support of almost 200 Stanford
students. Three groups have been
formed to carry out the program.
One group will go to Agnews
State Hospital each Wednesday
evening and work with a variety
of patients on the wards from 7
to 10 p.m. Leaders for this group
include Nina Elkind, Carol Schu
maker, Charlotte Wallace (all
from Lagunita), Sharon Peters
(Moore), Sue Koessler (Union I
and Bruce Anderson (Los Arcos).
The second group will go to the
hospital Tuesday afternoons from
2:15 to 5. A small group will leave
at 3:10 p.m. to accommodate stu
dents with 2:15 classes, also. This
group will assist elderly patients
with simple crafts and will also
lead them in singing. Day lead
ers for this group are Carolyn
Duniway (Moore), Kay Klitz (Un
ion) and George Westerman (Chi
Psi).
A third group designed espe
cialy for psychology majors and
those who have had abnormal
psychology courses is meeting
Tuesday evenings to combine
work at the hospital with consul
tations with the faculty and hos
pital staff. Student leaders for
this group are Judy Vollmar
(Moore) and Craig Allen (Stern).
Since many interested students
were unable to attend the meet
ings held this week, those who
are still interested in participat
ing in the program should con
tact one of the leaders to make
necessary arrangements. Leaders
stress the importance of all in
terested students contacting them
as soon as possible, as the first
hospital trips will take place
Tuesday afternoon and Wednes
day evening, Oct. 21 and 22.
Group activity credit will be
given to students who go to the
hospital once a week for 2V>
hours. Extra time may be made
up through attendance at the oc
casional meetings. Those who
are not seeking credit may go to
the hospital every other week.
