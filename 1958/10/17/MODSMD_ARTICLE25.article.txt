# Fry's 'Venus' Try outs Set
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Stanford Play
ers' production of "Venus Ob
served" by Christopher Fry will
be held on the main stage of Me
morial Auditorium next Monday
and Tuesday evenings from 7 to
11:30, according to the director,
A. D. Sensenbach.
This sophisticated and witty
comedy by England's new poetic
dramatist contrasts the varieties
of conventional and unconven
tional love.
Written with parts for six men
and four women, it is the tale of
a widower who wants to remarry
and seeks his son's aid in the se
lection of a wife. The candidates
are the father's three ex-mis
tresses.
