Hi *z Day for Stanford
P J

Saturday will bp a big day for Stanford's Indians, probably the
biggest they've had this year, maybe the biggest they will have. But
well mixed with this writer's usually happy, optimistic feelings come
a weekend there are reservations this week, some pretty serious ones.
Convinced that Head Coach Jack Curtice really does have some
thing in his Tribe, I felt 100 per cent sure at this time last week that
the Huskies- would be no match for a fired-up Stanford ball club. It
was a pleasure to be on top of the heap come 4:30 last Saturday. And
it was even more pleasurable to have been convinced that it would
happen rather than take a mere shot-in-the-dark, let's-support-the
old-red-and-white attitude.
This week I'm out on that same limb for a couple of good reasons.
Again I feel that Stanford, with enough effort, will knock the Air
Force Academy Falcons from atop a pretty impressive perch. The
Indians have been the club to do this to other opponents in the past
and it seems likely that it will happen again.
Then, too, about six weeks ago I predicted a rags-to-riches finish
for what 1 hoped would be the Cinderella club of the final stage of
the Pacific Coast Conference—and I plan to stay with lhat idea, for a
while at least.
Lastly, and probably the least sports-minded of them all, is a feel
ing I have about this Stanford club. It is, without reservation, the
finest group of athletes 1 have ever met. There is something about
this Stanford ball club which pushes it much more than the prover
bial head and shoulders above the rest. More fitting would be to
place it some feet-to-head above any other club I've had occasion
to meet.
Just what the reason for this is, would be hard to pinpoint. Per
haps it is Stanford's unique attitude toward athletics: an attitude
which brings to Stanford educated football players who play football
as a sidelight to their college careers rather than allow a college
education to sidelight a grid career.
Or maybe it's because year after year nobody, or very few people
at least, picks, the Indians to sweep other teams out of national head
lines. Sure, in T>(» a few of the football magazines failed to see how
any other PCC club could make the Pasadena trip, but all of them
had reservations included which detracted from their conviction so
that when you boiled it all down these glosies really weren't positive
that Stanford would goa all the way at all, and if they did it was sure
that they wouldn't top a Big Ten squad in the ruckus for the roses.
From this I find more reason to admire Stanford. I get the im
pression that these fellows realize they don't have a national cham
pionship team in their midst but they get a big kick out of making
the country's sportswriters and broadcasters eat a little crow from
time to time. And these are the times when they come up with an
upset win that really sets a few eyeballs to rolling. Take the upset
wins over Ohio State, 6-0, in 1955; Southern California, 27-19, in 1956;
and the outstanding topping of the late Red Sanders' Sniogland
Bruins, 20-6, last year.
Undoubtedly there are more reasons which lend themselves to
my admiration of Stanford teams in general and this year's squad
in particular. It could be their unity and spirit which keeps them
going long after they should seemingly give up. or maybe their deep
depression after having let their fans down, not so much a personal
feeling for themselves, but more a sense of how disappointed they
have left their followers.
Or it could be that quality of this club which most impresses me
is the one which is more dominant on trips than here on home
ground. How enjoyable they make the trip for themselves, for co
travelers. They are an impressive group, personality-wise; co-opera
tive, as few ball players seem to be, interesting, and interested.
Combining all these aspects, they total up to one more reason why
I will not pick against the Stanford squad: I know them.
Nice Guys Don't Always Make Good
But nice guys don't always make good or great ballplayers simply
by being nice. It takes a little more than that, and this is where my
reservations come in. It takes a good week or more of hard work
to win a ball game. Long hard hours working on some fundamentals
which have been forgotten, or seldom put to use. Perfecting those
passing and running plays so that there is little doubt in anyoine's
mind just what his assignment is.
But most of all, putting together a winning effort come Saturday
will take the same drive that was present last Saturday, a push and
drive that is pretty hard to get up week in and week out, but not an
impossible one. I involves confidence and temper in the right pro
portions.
You can't get cocky now that you've hit the win column —you're
pretty liable to have seen the last one if you do. You've got to go out
and prove thai the Washington win wasn't a fluke; and it's going to
be pretty hard to do that.
This Air Force club has been a sleeper this season; it's played
some outstanding ball—considering what was expected of it. But
beyond its tie with lowa it hasn't really met any of this nation's out
standing teams. Its ranking, and the odds on tomorrow's game, will
come from what has been an impressive season of wins and tnes
without considering whom these were against. At least that's how
I see it.
Winning a football game takes playing your own assignment, and
maybe someone else's—should he miss it—lots of good hard blocking
and tackling and stopping those other guys while you open holes lot
your own runners. Bid most of all it takes forgetting about the rosy
complexion dabbed on you all by the sportswriters last week, and
trying to see that they put a fresh coat on come Sunday the other
has washed off.
So, once again this week it's out on the limb we go, feeling that
Stanford, with what it has material-wise and play-wise, can be the
better team if everybody on the squad puts out as a sign in the squad
room says, "110% and 5 more."
REASONS Why did this writer pick North Carolina over South
ern Cal and Florida over UCLA? Intuition? Well, maybe, but 1 have
another conviction. I just don't think that USC or UCLA actually
have much this year; at least not as much as people are saying. But
then I don't think Pete Elliott has much at California either, and 1
figure that SC and Cal are a fairly even match in LA this weekend,
so I'm taking the longer shot and going for SC.

better team if everybody on the squad puts out as a sign in the squad
room says, "110% and 5 more."
REASONS Why did this writer pick North Carolina over South
ern Cal and Florida over UCLA? Intuition? Well, maybe, but 1 have
another conviction. I just don't think that USC or UCLA actually
have much this year; at least not as much as people are saying. But
then I don't think Pete Elliott has much at California either, and 1
figure that SC and Cal are a fairly even match in LA this weekend,
so I'm taking the longer shot and going for SC.

Hi *z Day for Stanford
P J

Saturday will bp a big day for Stanford's Indians, probably the
biggest they've had this year, maybe the biggest they will have. But
well mixed with this writer's usually happy, optimistic feelings come
a weekend there are reservations this week, some pretty serious ones.
Convinced that Head Coach Jack Curtice really does have some
thing in his Tribe, I felt 100 per cent sure at this time last week that
the Huskies- would be no match for a fired-up Stanford ball club. It
was a pleasure to be on top of the heap come 4:30 last Saturday. And
it was even more pleasurable to have been convinced that it would
happen rather than take a mere shot-in-the-dark, let's-support-the
old-red-and-white attitude.
This week I'm out on that same limb for a couple of good reasons.
Again I feel that Stanford, with enough effort, will knock the Air
Force Academy Falcons from atop a pretty impressive perch. The
Indians have been the club to do this to other opponents in the past
and it seems likely that it will happen again.
Then, too, about six weeks ago I predicted a rags-to-riches finish
for what 1 hoped would be the Cinderella club of the final stage of
the Pacific Coast Conference—and I plan to stay with lhat idea, for a
while at least.
Lastly, and probably the least sports-minded of them all, is a feel
ing I have about this Stanford club. It is, without reservation, the
finest group of athletes 1 have ever met. There is something about
this Stanford ball club which pushes it much more than the prover
bial head and shoulders above the rest. More fitting would be to
place it some feet-to-head above any other club I've had occasion
to meet.
Just what the reason for this is, would be hard to pinpoint. Per
haps it is Stanford's unique attitude toward athletics: an attitude
which brings to Stanford educated football players who play football
as a sidelight to their college careers rather than allow a college
education to sidelight a grid career.
Or maybe it's because year after year nobody, or very few people
at least, picks, the Indians to sweep other teams out of national head
lines. Sure, in T>(» a few of the football magazines failed to see how
any other PCC club could make the Pasadena trip, but all of them
had reservations included which detracted from their conviction so
that when you boiled it all down these glosies really weren't positive
that Stanford would goa all the way at all, and if they did it was sure
that they wouldn't top a Big Ten squad in the ruckus for the roses.
From this I find more reason to admire Stanford. I get the im
pression that these fellows realize they don't have a national cham
pionship team in their midst but they get a big kick out of making
the country's sportswriters and broadcasters eat a little crow from
time to time. And these are the times when they come up with an
upset win that really sets a few eyeballs to rolling. Take the upset
wins over Ohio State, 6-0, in 1955; Southern California, 27-19, in 1956;
and the outstanding topping of the late Red Sanders' Sniogland
Bruins, 20-6, last year.
Undoubtedly there are more reasons which lend themselves to
my admiration of Stanford teams in general and this year's squad
in particular. It could be their unity and spirit which keeps them
going long after they should seemingly give up. or maybe their deep
depression after having let their fans down, not so much a personal
feeling for themselves, but more a sense of how disappointed they
have left their followers.
Or it could be that quality of this club which most impresses me
is the one which is more dominant on trips than here on home
ground. How enjoyable they make the trip for themselves, for co
travelers. They are an impressive group, personality-wise; co-opera
tive, as few ball players seem to be, interesting, and interested.
Combining all these aspects, they total up to one more reason why
I will not pick against the Stanford squad: I know them.
Nice Guys Don't Always Make Good
But nice guys don't always make good or great ballplayers simply
by being nice. It takes a little more than that, and this is where my
reservations come in. It takes a good week or more of hard work
to win a ball game. Long hard hours working on some fundamentals
which have been forgotten, or seldom put to use. Perfecting those
passing and running plays so that there is little doubt in anyoine's
mind just what his assignment is.
But most of all, putting together a winning effort come Saturday
will take the same drive that was present last Saturday, a push and
drive that is pretty hard to get up week in and week out, but not an
impossible one. I involves confidence and temper in the right pro
portions.
You can't get cocky now that you've hit the win column —you're
pretty liable to have seen the last one if you do. You've got to go out
and prove thai the Washington win wasn't a fluke; and it's going to
be pretty hard to do that.
This Air Force club has been a sleeper this season; it's played
some outstanding ball—considering what was expected of it. But
beyond its tie with lowa it hasn't really met any of this nation's out
standing teams. Its ranking, and the odds on tomorrow's game, will
come from what has been an impressive season of wins and tnes
without considering whom these were against. At least that's how
I see it.
Winning a football game takes playing your own assignment, and
maybe someone else's—should he miss it—lots of good hard blocking
and tackling and stopping those other guys while you open holes lot
your own runners. Bid most of all it takes forgetting about the rosy
complexion dabbed on you all by the sportswriters last week, and
trying to see that they put a fresh coat on come Sunday the other
has washed off.
So, once again this week it's out on the limb we go, feeling that
Stanford, with what it has material-wise and play-wise, can be the
better team if everybody on the squad puts out as a sign in the squad
room says, "110% and 5 more."

come from what has been an impressive season of wins and tnes
without considering whom these were against. At least that's how
I see it.
Winning a football game takes playing your own assignment, and
maybe someone else's—should he miss it—lots of good hard blocking
and tackling and stopping those other guys while you open holes lot
your own runners. Bid most of all it takes forgetting about the rosy
complexion dabbed on you all by the sportswriters last week, and
trying to see that they put a fresh coat on come Sunday the other
has washed off.
So, once again this week it's out on the limb we go, feeling that
Stanford, with what it has material-wise and play-wise, can be the
better team if everybody on the squad puts out as a sign in the squad
room says, "110% and 5 more."
REASONS Why did this writer pick North Carolina over South
ern Cal and Florida over UCLA? Intuition? Well, maybe, but 1 have
another conviction. I just don't think that USC or UCLA actually
have much this year; at least not as much as people are saying. But
then I don't think Pete Elliott has much at California either, and 1
figure that SC and Cal are a fairly even match in LA this weekend,
so I'm taking the longer shot and going for SC.

Hi *z Day for Stanford
P J

Saturday will bp a big day for Stanford's Indians, probably the
biggest they've had this year, maybe the biggest they will have. But
well mixed with this writer's usually happy, optimistic feelings come
a weekend there are reservations this week, some pretty serious ones.
Convinced that Head Coach Jack Curtice really does have some
thing in his Tribe, I felt 100 per cent sure at this time last week that
the Huskies- would be no match for a fired-up Stanford ball club. It
was a pleasure to be on top of the heap come 4:30 last Saturday. And
it was even more pleasurable to have been convinced that it would
happen rather than take a mere shot-in-the-dark, let's-support-the
old-red-and-white attitude.
This week I'm out on that same limb for a couple of good reasons.
Again I feel that Stanford, with enough effort, will knock the Air
Force Academy Falcons from atop a pretty impressive perch. The
Indians have been the club to do this to other opponents in the past
and it seems likely that it will happen again.
Then, too, about six weeks ago I predicted a rags-to-riches finish
for what 1 hoped would be the Cinderella club of the final stage of
the Pacific Coast Conference—and I plan to stay with lhat idea, for a
while at least.
Lastly, and probably the least sports-minded of them all, is a feel
ing I have about this Stanford club. It is, without reservation, the
finest group of athletes 1 have ever met. There is something about
this Stanford ball club which pushes it much more than the prover
bial head and shoulders above the rest. More fitting would be to
place it some feet-to-head above any other club I've had occasion
to meet.
Just what the reason for this is, would be hard to pinpoint. Per
haps it is Stanford's unique attitude toward athletics: an attitude
which brings to Stanford educated football players who play football
as a sidelight to their college careers rather than allow a college
education to sidelight a grid career.
Or maybe it's because year after year nobody, or very few people
at least, picks, the Indians to sweep other teams out of national head
lines. Sure, in T>(» a few of the football magazines failed to see how
any other PCC club could make the Pasadena trip, but all of them
had reservations included which detracted from their conviction so
that when you boiled it all down these glosies really weren't positive
that Stanford would goa all the way at all, and if they did it was sure
that they wouldn't top a Big Ten squad in the ruckus for the roses.
From this I find more reason to admire Stanford. I get the im
pression that these fellows realize they don't have a national cham
pionship team in their midst but they get a big kick out of making
the country's sportswriters and broadcasters eat a little crow from
time to time. And these are the times when they come up with an
upset win that really sets a few eyeballs to rolling. Take the upset
wins over Ohio State, 6-0, in 1955; Southern California, 27-19, in 1956;
and the outstanding topping of the late Red Sanders' Sniogland
Bruins, 20-6, last year.
Undoubtedly there are more reasons which lend themselves to
my admiration of Stanford teams in general and this year's squad
in particular. It could be their unity and spirit which keeps them
going long after they should seemingly give up. or maybe their deep
depression after having let their fans down, not so much a personal
feeling for themselves, but more a sense of how disappointed they
have left their followers.
Or it could be that quality of this club which most impresses me
is the one which is more dominant on trips than here on home
ground. How enjoyable they make the trip for themselves, for co
travelers. They are an impressive group, personality-wise; co-opera
tive, as few ball players seem to be, interesting, and interested.
Combining all these aspects, they total up to one more reason why
I will not pick against the Stanford squad: I know them.
Nice Guys Don't Always Make Good
But nice guys don't always make good or great ballplayers simply
by being nice. It takes a little more than that, and this is where my
reservations come in. It takes a good week or more of hard work
to win a ball game. Long hard hours working on some fundamentals
which have been forgotten, or seldom put to use. Perfecting those
passing and running plays so that there is little doubt in anyoine's
mind just what his assignment is.
But most of all, putting together a winning effort come Saturday
will take the same drive that was present last Saturday, a push and
drive that is pretty hard to get up week in and week out, but not an
impossible one. I involves confidence and temper in the right pro
portions.
You can't get cocky now that you've hit the win column —you're
pretty liable to have seen the last one if you do. You've got to go out
and prove thai the Washington win wasn't a fluke; and it's going to
be pretty hard to do that.
This Air Force club has been a sleeper this season; it's played
some outstanding ball—considering what was expected of it. But
beyond its tie with lowa it hasn't really met any of this nation's out
standing teams. Its ranking, and the odds on tomorrow's game, will
come from what has been an impressive season of wins and tnes
without considering whom these were against. At least that's how

drive that is pretty hard to get up week in and week out, but not an
impossible one. I involves confidence and temper in the right pro
portions.
You can't get cocky now that you've hit the win column —you're
pretty liable to have seen the last one if you do. You've got to go out
and prove thai the Washington win wasn't a fluke; and it's going to
be pretty hard to do that.
This Air Force club has been a sleeper this season; it's played
some outstanding ball—considering what was expected of it. But
beyond its tie with lowa it hasn't really met any of this nation's out
standing teams. Its ranking, and the odds on tomorrow's game, will
come from what has been an impressive season of wins and tnes
without considering whom these were against. At least that's how
I see it.
Winning a football game takes playing your own assignment, and
maybe someone else's—should he miss it—lots of good hard blocking
and tackling and stopping those other guys while you open holes lot
your own runners. Bid most of all it takes forgetting about the rosy
complexion dabbed on you all by the sportswriters last week, and
trying to see that they put a fresh coat on come Sunday the other
has washed off.
So, once again this week it's out on the limb we go, feeling that
Stanford, with what it has material-wise and play-wise, can be the
better team if everybody on the squad puts out as a sign in the squad
room says, "110% and 5 more."
REASONS Why did this writer pick North Carolina over South
ern Cal and Florida over UCLA? Intuition? Well, maybe, but 1 have
another conviction. I just don't think that USC or UCLA actually
have much this year; at least not as much as people are saying. But
then I don't think Pete Elliott has much at California either, and 1
figure that SC and Cal are a fairly even match in LA this weekend,
so I'm taking the longer shot and going for SC.

Hi *z Day for Stanford
P J

Saturday will bp a big day for Stanford's Indians, probably the
biggest they've had this year, maybe the biggest they will have. But
well mixed with this writer's usually happy, optimistic feelings come
a weekend there are reservations this week, some pretty serious ones.
Convinced that Head Coach Jack Curtice really does have some
thing in his Tribe, I felt 100 per cent sure at this time last week that
the Huskies- would be no match for a fired-up Stanford ball club. It
was a pleasure to be on top of the heap come 4:30 last Saturday. And
it was even more pleasurable to have been convinced that it would
happen rather than take a mere shot-in-the-dark, let's-support-the
old-red-and-white attitude.
This week I'm out on that same limb for a couple of good reasons.
Again I feel that Stanford, with enough effort, will knock the Air
Force Academy Falcons from atop a pretty impressive perch. The
Indians have been the club to do this to other opponents in the past
and it seems likely that it will happen again.
Then, too, about six weeks ago I predicted a rags-to-riches finish
for what 1 hoped would be the Cinderella club of the final stage of
the Pacific Coast Conference—and I plan to stay with lhat idea, for a
while at least.
Lastly, and probably the least sports-minded of them all, is a feel
ing I have about this Stanford club. It is, without reservation, the
finest group of athletes 1 have ever met. There is something about
this Stanford ball club which pushes it much more than the prover
bial head and shoulders above the rest. More fitting would be to
place it some feet-to-head above any other club I've had occasion
to meet.
Just what the reason for this is, would be hard to pinpoint. Per
haps it is Stanford's unique attitude toward athletics: an attitude
which brings to Stanford educated football players who play football
as a sidelight to their college careers rather than allow a college
education to sidelight a grid career.
Or maybe it's because year after year nobody, or very few people
at least, picks, the Indians to sweep other teams out of national head
lines. Sure, in T>(» a few of the football magazines failed to see how
any other PCC club could make the Pasadena trip, but all of them
had reservations included which detracted from their conviction so
that when you boiled it all down these glosies really weren't positive
that Stanford would goa all the way at all, and if they did it was sure
that they wouldn't top a Big Ten squad in the ruckus for the roses.
From this I find more reason to admire Stanford. I get the im
pression that these fellows realize they don't have a national cham
pionship team in their midst but they get a big kick out of making
the country's sportswriters and broadcasters eat a little crow from
time to time. And these are the times when they come up with an
upset win that really sets a few eyeballs to rolling. Take the upset
wins over Ohio State, 6-0, in 1955; Southern California, 27-19, in 1956;
and the outstanding topping of the late Red Sanders' Sniogland
Bruins, 20-6, last year.
Undoubtedly there are more reasons which lend themselves to
my admiration of Stanford teams in general and this year's squad
in particular. It could be their unity and spirit which keeps them
going long after they should seemingly give up. or maybe their deep
depression after having let their fans down, not so much a personal
feeling for themselves, but more a sense of how disappointed they
have left their followers.
Or it could be that quality of this club which most impresses me
is the one which is more dominant on trips than here on home
ground. How enjoyable they make the trip for themselves, for co
travelers. They are an impressive group, personality-wise; co-opera
tive, as few ball players seem to be, interesting, and interested.
Combining all these aspects, they total up to one more reason why
I will not pick against the Stanford squad: I know them.
Nice Guys Don't Always Make Good
But nice guys don't always make good or great ballplayers simply
by being nice. It takes a little more than that, and this is where my
reservations come in. It takes a good week or more of hard work
to win a ball game. Long hard hours working on some fundamentals
which have been forgotten, or seldom put to use. Perfecting those
passing and running plays so that there is little doubt in anyoine's
mind just what his assignment is.
But most of all, putting together a winning effort come Saturday
will take the same drive that was present last Saturday, a push and
drive that is pretty hard to get up week in and week out, but not an
impossible one. I involves confidence and temper in the right pro
portions.
