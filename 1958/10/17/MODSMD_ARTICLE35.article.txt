## Cal, SC Battle Looms As Top Weekend Game 
### 
California's "resurging" Bears,
suddenly right in the middle of
the Pacific Coast Conference title
chase and Rose Bowl picture,
meet the still-dangerous South
ern California Trojans in Los
Angeles and leader Oregon plays
Washington State in the "big
ones" of tomorrow's conference
action.
With Stanford the only team in
international play, UCLA travels
to Washington and hapless Ore
gon State takes on a rugged
Idaho eleven.
Cal will he seeking its second
straight loop win against the Tro
jans, who are smarting from a
25-0 shellacking at the hands of
Oregon last week. The Bears
started the season close to form,
losing to College of Pacific and
Michigan State, but then astound
ed everybody by hammering
WSC, 34-14, and last week topped
Utah, 36-21.
SC lias Lost Three
It has been a somewhat oppo
site year for USC. The Trojans
opened with their "upset" of OSC
and dropped tight one-pointers to
Mishigan and North Caroina be
fore last week's Oregon Drub
bing.
A Cal victory would give the
Bears a good jump on the other
Pasadena-eligibles, but the Tro
jans are also still in the Bowl
picture.
Oregon's more-than-stingy de
fense will get a real test tomor
row in hosting the free-wheeling
WSC Cougars. But the Ducks
got a break when Cougar passing
star Bob Newman was injured
j last week against Idaho. Newman
will be replaced by Dave Wilson,
who has completed only eight
passes, bul for 204 yards and
three touchdowns.
WSC will be the first wide-open
passing team the Ducks will have
met this season. Last year, co
j champ Oregon squeaked out a
14-13 win over the Cougars but
j were almost snowed under by an
! all-out passing assult in the final

quarter.
The conference's most puzzling
team, Oregon State, faces any
thing but a breather in Idaho
tomorrow. The Beavers were run
off the field by an expected brush
over, Wyoming, last week, 28-0,
and hold unimpressive triumphs
over Kansas and UCLA.
Idaho at 1-1
Idaho has only one victory, an
easy triumph over Utah, but were
beaten badly only by Oregon.
Last week the Vandals were stop
ped by rival Washington State,
8-0, and it was notable that this
was the first time in two years
the Cougars had been held to less
than two touchdowns.
And an almost more puzzling
club, UCLA, will have the serv
ices of its five-game seniors for
the last time against Washington
in Seattle. The Bruins have
scored only one win this season,
that a close one over Illinois, and
will have to go the rest of the
way without their seniors.

Washington, off to a great i
start this season, was taken down j
a few notches by Stanford last j
week and hopes to rebound.

row in hosting the free-wheeling
WSC Cougars. But the Ducks
got a break when Cougar passing
star Bob Newman was injured
j last week against Idaho. Newman
will be replaced by Dave Wilson,
who has completed only eight
passes, bul for 204 yards and
three touchdowns.
WSC will be the first wide-open
passing team the Ducks will have
met this season. Last year, co
j champ Oregon squeaked out a
14-13 win over the Cougars but
j were almost snowed under by an
! all-out passing assult in the final

quarter.
The conference's most puzzling
team, Oregon State, faces any
thing but a breather in Idaho
tomorrow. The Beavers were run
off the field by an expected brush
over, Wyoming, last week, 28-0,
and hold unimpressive triumphs
over Kansas and UCLA.
Idaho at 1-1
Idaho has only one victory, an
easy triumph over Utah, but were
beaten badly only by Oregon.
Last week the Vandals were stop
ped by rival Washington State,
8-0, and it was notable that this
was the first time in two years
the Cougars had been held to less
than two touchdowns.
And an almost more puzzling
club, UCLA, will have the serv
ices of its five-game seniors for
the last time against Washington
in Seattle. The Bruins have
scored only one win this season,
that a close one over Illinois, and
will have to go the rest of the
way without their seniors.

Washington, off to a great i
start this season, was taken down j
a few notches by Stanford last j
week and hopes to rebound.

It has been a somewhat oppo

A Cal victory would give the
