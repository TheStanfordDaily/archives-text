# Series Cash Split

### 
NEW YORK (>P) â€” The New
York Yankees cut their World
Series shares into 32 full slices
with each worth $8759, baseball
commissioner Ford Frick revealed
Thursday.
Each full losing share for 31
Milwaukee Braves amounted to
$5896. So Bob Turley's fine relief
job and the four-run rally in the
eighth inning of the seventh game
meant $2863 for the Yanks.
