# Dressing Room Redecorated
## 
### Camille de Campos 
"Whatever has happened to Ihe
gold sequins?" or "I'lease don't
step on those costumes" might
have been a familiar wail of last
year's Gaieties production crews,
but should not be heard as this
season's work goes on in the
Ram's Head room.
According to a Gaieties vet
eran, "The place was once chaos."
Now the all-purpose room is an
orderly example of good student
planning.
It seems that the spirit of reno-
I vating, rebuilding and redecorat
| ing that has dominated campus
j life since last spring must have
been contagious. At any rate,
i Ram's Head, a Stanford student
! dramatic organization, caught the
i fever and now has a newly re
done work room for its efforts.
Two students, Frank Colt art
j and Terry Sandke, worked

throughout Ihe summer on the
project — rebuilding, organizing
and painting the room which is
located in the basement of Memo
rial Auditorium. At a cost of
$000. they managed to complete
the job in time for use this au
tumn.
Fluorescent lighting improves
Ihe rather spotty light-and-shad
ow effect of last year, and the
gay and flashy 1 hough somewhat
disconcerting effects of red,
green, blue and black walls have
given way this year to a pleasant
light-toned beige color- all over.
The former amiable clutter of
costumes, supplies and props
which littered Ihe floor is no
longer a familiar sight.
The spacious room now has fa
eilities for mosi Ram's Head ac
tivities and projects. It is fur-1
nished with all the needs of cos-)
tume construction — a. lull-length,

miror, dross forms, sewing ma
chines and work tables. There is
a large walk-in costume ward
robe which houses a several sea
sons' backlog of outfits.
Formerly, the costumes were
kept in boxes, scattered "helter
skelter" on the floor or inade
quate shelves. The new facilities
also have special closets for
make-up and supplies.
The room is outfitted with a
piano for moments of dramatic
inspiration, practice or .just fun.
The room fills many purposes
for Ram's Head members. It
serves as a center for costume
construction and storage.
Ram's Head business manager
Carol Cosgrove summed up the
group's feeling on their revamped
headquarters: "It's a boon to us.
It serves as a definite nucleus
from which our activities can ra
diate."
