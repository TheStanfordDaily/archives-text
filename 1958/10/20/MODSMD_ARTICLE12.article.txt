# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## Whose Will Be Done? 
### 
What could become a danger
ous phrase slipped out at Thurs
day night's meeting of the Legis
lature.
"The will of the Legislature."
We maintain in our editorial
that the "will of the Legislature"
prevailed in the question of The
Axe. And we raise doubts as to
whether this is the "will of the
students." Certainly the will of
the students is reflected by the
Legislature as far as monetary
matters are concerned. No one
wants to see his money tossed
around haphazardly. And while
our personal feeling is htat The
Axe should be placed in the Li
brary, we are sympathetic with
the Legislature view that it would
be an unnecessary cost consider
ing there is already a display case
in the Cellar, and that The Axe
may conceivably be placed in
Tresidder Memorial Union some
day.
But we wonder if it is the
will of the students that The
Axe he brought out at all.
Again, our personal feeling is
that it would contribute consider
ably to the spirit of competition
with Cal and to the general tradi
tion of the University. If we are
supported in this view, we then
wonder about the will of the stu
dents as to when they want The
Axe out.
We've talked to student leaders
and members of the Axe Society
who have been instrumental in
formulating the plans thus far.
They want to see The Axe out
NOW.
But Thursday night it was
the "will of the Legislature"
which prevailed.
And the "will of the Legisla
ture" will continue to prevail if
students do not make il known
that the members of Legislature
represent their constituencies and
not merely their personal views.
One of the objects of a repre
sentative body is to sort out the
emotional demands made by con
stituencies which are often likely
to act on whims. But this does
not mean that Legislature mem
bers are the final authority. It
does mean that they can become
so, if given the opportunity.
The "will of the Legislature"

is a disheartening phrase. We'd
like to see the "will of the stu
dents" become the "will of the
Legislature" and not the other
way around.
The caretakers of the funds
were placed in a difficula posi
tion Thursday night. It seems
that Cardinals and Rally Com
have both been planning rallies
for Homecoming—Rally Com, the
traditional Friday night rally in
Frost Amphatheater and Cardi
nals. a Saturday morning rally on
the Row. Both groups proceeded
with their separate plans, al
though they did try briefly to get
together.
The difficulty arose from lack
of budgeting last year on the part
of Cardinals. Their budget al
lowed for $25 for Homecoming
activities; Thursday night they
asked the Legislature for an ad
ditional $250 from the contin
gency fund.
Cardinals, with an informal
agreement with another organiza
tion to pay costs, has sent out
some 45,000 letters to Stanford
alumni, inviting them to Home
coming activities, including the
Saturday morning rally. Thurs
day night it developed that pet
haps the other organization will
not pay after all, so the Legisla
ture must foot the bill for the let
ters, plus entertainment costs.
While we question the wisdom
of planning two major rallies at
all. we see the chief fault in the
lack of pre-planning and in not
getting a definite commitment on
the costs before acting.
Rally Com sticks to its guns
on the "traditional" rally and
Cardinals moves ahead with its

plans. On whose shoulders
does (lie major portion of the
blame lie?
As things stand now, it's too
late to blame anyone, and we can
only hope both events are well at
tended and worth the time, mon
ey and confusion spent on them.

The caretakers of the funds
were placed in a difficula posi
tion Thursday night. It seems
that Cardinals and Rally Com
have both been planning rallies
for Homecoming—Rally Com, the
traditional Friday night rally in
Frost Amphatheater and Cardi
nals. a Saturday morning rally on
the Row. Both groups proceeded
with their separate plans, al
though they did try briefly to get
together.
The difficulty arose from lack
of budgeting last year on the part
of Cardinals. Their budget al
lowed for $25 for Homecoming
activities; Thursday night they
asked the Legislature for an ad
ditional $250 from the contin
gency fund.
Cardinals, with an informal
agreement with another organiza
tion to pay costs, has sent out
some 45,000 letters to Stanford
alumni, inviting them to Home
coming activities, including the
Saturday morning rally. Thurs
day night it developed that pet
haps the other organization will
not pay after all, so the Legisla
ture must foot the bill for the let
ters, plus entertainment costs.
While we question the wisdom
of planning two major rallies at
all. we see the chief fault in the
lack of pre-planning and in not
getting a definite commitment on
the costs before acting.
Rally Com sticks to its guns
on the "traditional" rally and
Cardinals moves ahead with its

plans. On whose shoulders
does (lie major portion of the
blame lie?
As things stand now, it's too
late to blame anyone, and we can
only hope both events are well at
tended and worth the time, mon
ey and confusion spent on them.

"The will of the Legislature."
We maintain in our editorial
that the "will of the Legislature"
prevailed in the question of The
Axe. And we raise doubts as to
whether this is the "will of the
students." Certainly the will of
the students is reflected by the
Legislature as far as monetary
matters are concerned. No one
wants to see his money tossed
around haphazardly. And while
our personal feeling is htat The
Axe should be placed in the Li
brary, we are sympathetic with
the Legislature view that it would
be an unnecessary cost consider
ing there is already a display case
in the Cellar, and that The Axe
may conceivably be placed in
Tresidder Memorial Union some
day.
But we wonder if it is the
will of the students that The
Axe he brought out at all.
Again, our personal feeling is
that it would contribute consider
ably to the spirit of competition
with Cal and to the general tradi
tion of the University. If we are
supported in this view, we then
wonder about the will of the stu

Axe out.

day night it developed that pet
haps the other organization will
not pay after all, so the Legisla
ture must foot the bill for the let
ters, plus entertainment costs.
While we question the wisdom
of planning two major rallies at
all. we see the chief fault in the
lack of pre-planning and in not
getting a definite commitment on
the costs before acting.
Rally Com sticks to its guns
on the "traditional" rally and
Cardinals moves ahead with its

plans. On whose shoulders
does (lie major portion of the
blame lie?
As things stand now, it's too
late to blame anyone, and we can
only hope both events are well at
tended and worth the time, mon
ey and confusion spent on them.
