Rditor, The Daily:
As a faculty member In con
tact with the Danforth Founda
tion in the capasity of Danforth
Associate at Stanford, may I take
the opportunity to correct some
possible misapprehensions which
might arise from the article on
Danforth Graduate Fellowship in
The Daily.
First of all, it is Danforth
Foundation, not Danvvorth. But
this is of no importance. Two
major errors ought to be noted.
The Dean of the Graduate Divi
sion has previously been liaison
officcr for Stanford. Since we
now have no Dean of the Grad
uate Division, the liaison officer, S
whom prospective applicants
should consult, is Dean William
S. McCord, the Assistant Dean
of Humanities and Sciences.
The other error is in the quali
fications. The announcement
sheet specifies the following:
"This national program lias been
established to bring into higher
education a larger number of
young men, thoroughly trained
according to highest scholastic
standards, who are aware of the
place for moral and religious
values in teaching and counsel
ing." And in the list of qualifica
tions which were mentioned, your
reporter failed to list a rather
crucial one. The sentence runs as
follows: "Selection is made on
the basis of outstanding academic
ability, personality congenial to
the classroom, and integrity and
character, including serious in- j
quiry within the Christian tradi
tion." The specifications of the

fellowships therefore require of
the applicant, not necessarily
total commitment to the Christian
tradition, but at least serious in
quiry within it and commitment
to the significance of "religious
values" in higher education.
1 bring these corrections to
your attention so lhat prospective
applicants will not he disappoint
ed when they discover these
further conditions.
