# AF Harriers Fall to Cards
## 
### 
The first intersectional cross
country meet in Stanford history
turned into a rousing success for
Keith Wallace and the Indians as
they whipped a young Air Force
Academy team, 19-38, on the local
golf course Saturday.
The finishers split into groups
of four as Stanford took the ini
tial four places, the Falcons grab
bed the next four, the Cards cap
tured ninth through 12th, and the
rest of the Academy men brought
up the rear.
Wallace led from the opening
gun, eventually winning in 21:-
33.2, well behind his own course
record. He finished more than a
minute ahead of Bob Monzingo,
who was second in 22:34.
Monzingo came along well in
the middle stages of the race to
pass Doug Martin, who finished
third, and Larry Suelzle, the
fourth-place man.
