# Falcons Call Indians Slowest Opponent; 'Too Deep and Too Quick'—Curtice
## SPORT CENE The 						Stanford Daily 
### Roy Lawson John Schwarz 
The guards said it and so did
the halfbacks: "They're the slow
est team we've played this sea
son."
And unless Stanford doses on
mercury this week, similar com
ment may ensue Saturday as
USAF dissolves to UCLA.
The Falcons, pleased as punch
with their 16-0 win over the In
dians, felt the big obstacle toward
an undefeated season has been
hurdled.
Clear Road Ahead
"I don't see anyone, with the
exception of Oklahoma State or
possibly Colorado, that can stop
us now," said fullback Steve Ga
lios, of Napa, following Satur
day's game.
"They were going for the first
fake on our belly series," said Ga
lios, "and it helped spring our
runners loose."
"Their pass defense was good,
but our swing pass was open
most of the game," he said. Galios
caught a 15-yard swing pass for
the Falcons' final touchdown.
Quarterback John K ueii7.el
thought the Indians' pass defense
was good and directed the attack
through the interior line. "Our
plays right up the middle were
working best," he explained.
"I'll say this," offered fullback
Larry Thomson, "in Ihe first half
their line was as tough as any
we've run against."
Line Weakens
The injury-riddled Stanford
line weakened in the final half,
Thomson felt. "I don't know
whether we beat them down with
our unit substitution or what, but
it was a little easier in the sec
ond half," he said.
Tackle Brock Strom was called
"the light that our other players
rallied around" by head coach Ben
Martin. Strom is the heaviest
man on the greyhound Air Force
team at 217 pounds.
"The lowa line was a lot bigger
and faster," Strom said in com

paring the Indian forward wall.
"That No. 58 |Doug Pursell| who
played over me was a good line
backer," he said.
"Their reactions were slower
than other teams we've played
this season," felt guard Randy
Cubero. "Their linemen were
stunting quite a bit, but they
were doing it in a pattern and we
adjusted to it,"he continued.

Locker room din subsided then
and the Falcon zoomed into the
wild blue yonder. He left a hap
less Indian on the ground with a
400 - mile trudge to — Ihe script
says—the lair of the notorious
baby blue-eyed Bruin.

"They just hit too hard, had too
much depth and were too quick,"
commented Stanford Coach Jack
Curtice whiie discussing his
team's 16-0 defeat at the hands of
the Air - Force Academy.
"They are a real good team and
probably have even more balance
and depth than Rice had. We have
no excuses except that they were
too tough."
"I do hope," continued Curtice,
"that we get in mote solid prac
tice sessions this week before we
meet UCLA next Saturday. Look
what happened to us last week,
six of our regulars had to miss
two or more workouts due to
minor injuries."
While the subject of injuries
was in the air Curtice was re
lieved to find out that .Rick Mc-
Millen, Stanford's best running
back, was not seriously injured
and would be back in action at
Los Angeles.
McMillen had strained a mus
cle early in Saturday's game and
spent practically Hie full GO min
utes on ihe bench.
Stanford's drubbing did, how
ever', bring a few glitters into ihe
eyes of Coach Curtice.
"How did you like the way old
Pete |Bob Peterson| got down
field on those kicks. It seemed no
sooner did the receiver catch the
ball than he caught old Pete
along with it," mentioned Curtice.
The many injuries that plagued
the Stanford regulars did bring
into action many of the younger
members of the squad, giving
them much needed experience.
