# UN 						WEEK BEGINS
## WUS Solicitation Starts With Luncheon Today 
### 
The World University Service organization's drive for funds starts
today as part of the United Nations Week observance, according to
Michael Praetorius, chairman for the drive.
To begin the week-long drive, a luncheon is scheduled today for all
solicitors at the Women's Clubhouse. The group will have as guest

speaker Dr. K. Baskara Rao, WUS
Regional Executive of the West
Coast area, according to Praeto
rius.
Dr. Rao is also scheduled to ad
dress the following living groups:
Union, Monday during dinner;
Roble (all house) following din
ner; Branner, Tuesday during
lunch, and Stern, Wednesday dur
ing dinner.
About the drive, President J. E.
Wallace Sterling said, "Many
events in this world inspire fear
and anxiety; others inspire hope
and confidence. Eminent in the
latter category is the aid being
given to worthy students of all
nations, through the World Uni
versity Service, by their more
fortunate fellows in other lands."
"As members of an American
university community, we enjoy
manifold blessings which others
do not share," said Sterling. "This
week, when our student volun
teers conduct Stanford's seventh
annual World University drive
for funds, it would be well for us
to count our blessings and seri
ously consider the advantage of
sharing them with others," he
concluded.
Solicitors have been assigned
to each of the on-campus living
groups.
