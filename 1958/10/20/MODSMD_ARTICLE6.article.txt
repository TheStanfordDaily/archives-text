### 
ROME (/I') Secretary of State

Force KCI3S .jet tanker Sunday
on a polar flight to Formosa and
talks with President Chiang Kai
shek.
He will stop in Britain for a
dinnertime meeting with British
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.
U.S. Embassy officials iir London
asid the meeting was expected to
last three hours and that there
| would be no communique after
ward.
I'ope's Funeral

for memorial services for Pope
Pius XII in Vatican City. He took
the occasion for talks with Pre
mier- Amintore Fanfani and For
eign Ministers Heinrich von Bren
tano of West Germany and Mau
rice Couve de Murville of France.
The Formosa crisis and Dulles'
forthcoming talks with Chiang
were assumed to have figured
high in those talks, and probably
will with Lloyd.
Dulles' 8200-mile flight, with a
stop also at Nielson air base in
Alaska, is expected to put him in
Taipei Tuesday morning, For
mosa time.
During the two days in For
mosa, Dulles probably will assure
Chiang there has been no change

Power Cut
But the big question still un
answered is whether Chieng will
agree to a manpower cut on the
offshore island of Quemoy to re
lieve Communist fears of a Na
tionalist invasion of the main
land.
The United States is reported
to feel that if these fears can be
removed, a dependable ceasefire
can be achieved. The self-imposed
Communist case-fire around Que
moy goes into its third week Mon
day. It is due to end next Sunday.
1 The Taipei meetings also are
aimed at dispelling any Commit
■nisi idea that the United States
