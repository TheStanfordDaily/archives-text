# Stanford Stopped Cold By Hugged AF Eleven
## Falcons Earn 16-0 Triumph 
### John Anderson 
No go on offense kept Stanford
out of the scoring column and
put them on the short end of a
16-0 score against the Air Force
Academy here Saturday.
The game, watched by an esti
mated 40,000 spectators including
2350 high school bandsmen and
1200 Parents' Day guests, left
little for Stanford supporters to
cheer about. The Indians were
never able to penetrate farther
than their- opening drive to the
Air Force 38 which was stopped
by Bob Nicolet's fumble.
Exciting Bird
In fact, the most exciting show
for many people probably oc
curred before the initial kick-off
when the Academy unleashed its
trained falcon. The mascot, Mark
I, swooped down and around the
huge stadium twice buzzing a
Stanford end during the prc-game
warm-up.
But the Air Force needed no
help from the bird as they stop
ped cold everything Stanford had
to offer and found enough holes
in (he Indian defense to score two
touchdowns and one field goal.
Nine points out of the 10 scored
by the Falcons came in the fourth
quarter which attests somewhat
to the good defense played by the
Indians during most of the game.
Three times the Academy drove
within (he Cards' 30-yard line but
then the Stanford line stiffened
forcing a field goal attempt on
fourth down.

Stanford's offense undoubtedly
was hurt by 11 le loss of Rich Mc-
Millen. A muscle strain during
the play which scored the Air
Force's first touchdown kept Mc-
Millen, who ran for a 182-yard
total and average of 7.1 against
Washington last week, from play
ing the remainder of the contest.
He will probably be out for a
week.
However, Ihe presence of the
junior halfback most likely would
not have changed the outcome of
Ihe game. The Falcons' two
equally fine units, changing re
gardless of position of the ball,
were just too much for the In
dians.
Stanford started off very im
pressively after a touchback on
the opening kickoff put the ball
on the Indian 20. Running by Mc-
Millen and Doug Dick and a pass
from Nicolet to Chris Burford put
ihe ball on the 50.
Nicolet-to-Nikolai
Then end Irv Nikolai went high
in the air to make a beautiful re
ception of Nicolet's pass to put
the Cards on the Air Force 38.
Two plays later the fumble ended
the most impressive offensive
show that the Indians could mus
ter all afternoon.
After the recovery by Chuck
Rodger, on the first play from
scrimmage Kuenzel pitched out
to left: halfback Mike Quinlan
around right end for 34 yards.
Five plays later the Falcons were
on I ho Indian two-yard line where

Quinlan ran it- over. Right half
George Pupich kicked the extra
point.
At this point the second unit
came into the game for the Acad
emy led by quarterback Rich
Mayo, who during the course of
the game ran for 14 yards, passed
for 67 and engineered a touch
down drive and a successful field
goal attempt.
Tough Defense
The third quarter was high
lighted by the defensive play of
Stanford who for the first time
since early in the game really put
the stops on the Falcon offense.
Roch Conklin and Troy Barbee
were the mainstays in the line
and the rushitng of Nikolai and
Burford knocked down several
pass attempts by both Kuenzel
and Mayo.
A fumble by halfback Skip
Face midway through the third
period on the Indian 39 gave the
Academy a break. But the now
very effective Stanford defense
forced the Falcons to go for their
second field goal try by Pupich—
this one again too far to the right.
The elusive field goal was fi
nally attained by Pupich in the
fourth quarter when a Falcon
drive bogged down on the Staf
ford 13. The 10-0 lead apparently
icde the game for the Air Force.
The Cards couldn't move after
the kickoff and Nicolet punred to
the Falcon 35. From here Mayo
engineered a 65-yard touchdown
march in 10 plays, the score com
ing on a swing pass from Mayo
to fullback Sieve Galios.
