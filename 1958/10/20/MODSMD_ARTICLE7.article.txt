# Stanford Stopped Cold By Hugged AF Eleven
## Falcons Earn 16-0 Triumph 
### John Anderson 
No go on offense kept Stanford
out of the scoring column and
put them on the short end of a
16-0 score against the Air Force
Academy here Saturday.
The game, watched by an esti
mated 40,000 spectators including
2350 high school bandsmen and
1200 Parents' Day guests, left
little for Stanford supporters to
cheer about. The Indians were
never able to penetrate farther
than their- opening drive to the
Air Force 38 which was stopped
by Bob Nicolet's fumble.
Exciting Bird
In fact, the most exciting show
for many people probably oc
curred before the initial kick-off
when the Academy unleashed its
trained falcon. The mascot, Mark
I, swooped down and around the
huge stadium twice buzzing a
Stanford end during the prc-game
warm-up.
But the Air Force needed no
help from the bird as they stop
ped cold everything Stanford had
to offer and found enough holes
in (he Indian defense to score two
touchdowns and one field goal.
Nine points out of the 10 scored
by the Falcons came in the fourth
quarter which attests somewhat
to the good defense played by the
Indians during most of the game.
Three times the Academy drove
within (he Cards' 30-yard line but
then the Stanford line stiffened
forcing a field goal attempt on
fourth down.
