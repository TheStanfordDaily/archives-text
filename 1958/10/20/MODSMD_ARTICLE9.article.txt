## Why Wait? 
### 
Oxi: OF Tin; Fl NOTIONS of the A SSI I Legislature is to keep watch
over llie funds of llie ASSU. Tliis is admittedly a «lnl\ involving
great responsihilily. The more than $38,000 in the ASSI budget
inusl he spent with care.
Mill we'd like to propose another function of the Legislature.
II is this: To keep in touch with the SPIRII of the University
and ils traditions. And, w i 111 this iu mind, we ask the Legislature
\\ h\ il appropriated $2HO to put The Axe on display and then
derided to "wail and see whether Stanford wins llie Big Came
before actually spending the funds.
Why a ppropriate the money out of this year's contingency
fund if il is felt I hat llie expense is nol justified nou? II e
propose thai llie Legislature act I'd in this manner because llie
mem hers knew what the sentiments toward llie Axe liare
been I radii tonally and did nol want lo ignore them, hat lliey
were trying to be completely practical in a situation which
includes tradition as well as practicality. The SI'I HIT of I lie
Axe is as important as how much il will cost to display il.
In view of the Legislature members* reaction to the Axe Society
proposal lo display The Axe, it's a wonder they even appropriated
the money. Only two voices were willing to flout tradition and
vole against bringing The Axe out of ils vault, but the general
feeling seemed lo be: It isn't worth it. but this is what we are
expected to do.
II il is the cost with which Legislature members are concerned,
there is no reason lo bring lite Axe out of its safety in the Ameri
can Trust Company vault, for the company is guarding The Axe
for the publicity il receives by doing so.
IJul we maintain that the cost should nol be llie decisive factor
in lliis case, Certainly we do not advocate spending $280 without
serious thought. Legislature, looking ahead to the day when The
Axe may be placed in the Tresidder Memorial Union, decided that
the cost of putting in a new case in llie Library was not justified
\s hen there already is a case in The Cellar. But, also looking
ahead, with pessimistic prophecies on Big Came, they decided
111 a I the initial expense, plus the $25 needed to take Ihe Axe out
of its case for showing at Big Game, was also not justified if we
were to lose The Axe this year.
11 is the. pessimism evinced by Legislature members which
is most disturbing. The SPIRIT of The Axe is not one of
pessimism but of optimism. The Axe ) ell is for limes of
crises—when a football game is at a critical point we "Give
Em the Axe." Stanford's football record this season does not
I'licil great hope for llig (fame but all the more reason to
"(rive 'Em the Axe.''
That The Axe is an object of traditional optimism is shown
in the work of the Immortal 21 and in attempts by Cal students
lo steal The Axe. These have felt the SPIRIT behind llie Axe.
To say that we will "wait and see" whether we win is to reveal
that our optimism is failing; our pride in the great traditions of
Stanford and The Axe is shaky.
( While it takes more than optimism to win a football game,
Came lias often been a contest isolated from the regular season
play : removed from seasonal competition by the SPIRIT of Stan
lord and Cal students. Bringing out llie Axe would contribute
10 this sense of SPIR IT for Big Game and other student acti\ ilies.
The Legislature's "wait and see" policy is only a recommenda
tion, but it carries the force of an instruction to the student finan
cial manager not lo sign any contracts until they've "seen."' This
"recommendation" will be ignored onlv if the students feel keenly
enough about The Axe to pressure Legislature into immediate
act ion.
This action should be to put The Axe on display no later
than llig dame Heck—with proper ceremony. Part of Stan
ford, and part of llig Game in particular, is the SPIRI T sym
bolized by The Axe. To go through llig (fame It eek with a
negative attitude, such as lliat shown by the Legislature, is to
spell defeat, possibly on the gridiron, but more certainly to
the I radii ion itself.
Some of the opposition against displaying The Axe at all has
stemmed from the possibility of attempts of Cal students lo steal
11 and the lack of positive assurance against the success of such an
attempt. If students are so little concerned will) the tradition of
The \xe, wliv should lhc\ be so concerned about possible theft?
True, the sight of The Axe is tempting to would-be thieves,
bill also the sight of The Axe is conducive to greater SPIRII
\\ i 111i11 llie student body. As we noted last week, the material
existence of The Axe is not important in itself: rather it is the
intangible feelings which it conveys, and this year, wilh football
competition bringing the accompanying spirits to a low, these
intangible feelings cannot be captured in one quick view of The
Axe at Big Game.
The tradition of The Axe is an integral part of the SPIRIT
of the I niversit\ and needs only a little rekindling to make it live.
To bring The Axe lo the students before Rig Game will be to
provide the needed flame of spirit.

were trying to be completely practical in a situation which
includes tradition as well as practicality. The SI'I HIT of I lie
Axe is as important as how much il will cost to display il.
In view of the Legislature members* reaction to the Axe Society
proposal lo display The Axe, it's a wonder they even appropriated
the money. Only two voices were willing to flout tradition and
vole against bringing The Axe out of ils vault, but the general
feeling seemed lo be: It isn't worth it. but this is what we are
expected to do.
II il is the cost with which Legislature members are concerned,
there is no reason lo bring lite Axe out of its safety in the Ameri
can Trust Company vault, for the company is guarding The Axe
for the publicity il receives by doing so.
IJul we maintain that the cost should nol be llie decisive factor
in lliis case, Certainly we do not advocate spending $280 without
serious thought. Legislature, looking ahead to the day when The
Axe may be placed in the Tresidder Memorial Union, decided that
the cost of putting in a new case in llie Library was not justified
\s hen there already is a case in The Cellar. But, also looking
ahead, with pessimistic prophecies on Big Came, they decided
111 a I the initial expense, plus the $25 needed to take Ihe Axe out
of its case for showing at Big Game, was also not justified if we
were to lose The Axe this year.
11 is the. pessimism evinced by Legislature members which
is most disturbing. The SPIRIT of The Axe is not one of
pessimism but of optimism. The Axe ) ell is for limes of
crises—when a football game is at a critical point we "Give
Em the Axe." Stanford's football record this season does not
I'licil great hope for llig (fame but all the more reason to
"(rive 'Em the Axe.''
That The Axe is an object of traditional optimism is shown
in the work of the Immortal 21 and in attempts by Cal students
lo steal The Axe. These have felt the SPIRIT behind llie Axe.
To say that we will "wait and see" whether we win is to reveal
that our optimism is failing; our pride in the great traditions of
Stanford and The Axe is shaky.
( While it takes more than optimism to win a football game,
Came lias often been a contest isolated from the regular season
play : removed from seasonal competition by the SPIRIT of Stan
lord and Cal students. Bringing out llie Axe would contribute
10 this sense of SPIR IT for Big Game and other student acti\ ilies.
The Legislature's "wait and see" policy is only a recommenda
tion, but it carries the force of an instruction to the student finan
cial manager not lo sign any contracts until they've "seen."' This
"recommendation" will be ignored onlv if the students feel keenly
enough about The Axe to pressure Legislature into immediate
act ion.
This action should be to put The Axe on display no later
than llig dame Heck—with proper ceremony. Part of Stan
ford, and part of llig Game in particular, is the SPIRI T sym
bolized by The Axe. To go through llig (fame It eek with a
negative attitude, such as lliat shown by the Legislature, is to
spell defeat, possibly on the gridiron, but more certainly to
the I radii ion itself.
Some of the opposition against displaying The Axe at all has
stemmed from the possibility of attempts of Cal students lo steal
11 and the lack of positive assurance against the success of such an
attempt. If students are so little concerned will) the tradition of
The \xe, wliv should lhc\ be so concerned about possible theft?
True, the sight of The Axe is tempting to would-be thieves,
bill also the sight of The Axe is conducive to greater SPIRII

existence of The Axe is not important in itself: rather it is the
intangible feelings which it conveys, and this year, wilh football
competition bringing the accompanying spirits to a low, these
intangible feelings cannot be captured in one quick view of The
Axe at Big Game.
The tradition of The Axe is an integral part of the SPIRIT
of the I niversit\ and needs only a little rekindling to make it live.
To bring The Axe lo the students before Rig Game will be to
provide the needed flame of spirit.

IJul we maintain that the cost should nol be llie decisive factor
in lliis case, Certainly we do not advocate spending $280 without
serious thought. Legislature, looking ahead to the day when The
Axe may be placed in the Tresidder Memorial Union, decided that
the cost of putting in a new case in llie Library was not justified
\s hen there already is a case in The Cellar. But, also looking
ahead, with pessimistic prophecies on Big Came, they decided
111 a I the initial expense, plus the $25 needed to take Ihe Axe out
of its case for showing at Big Game, was also not justified if we
were to lose The Axe this year.
11 is the. pessimism evinced by Legislature members which
is most disturbing. The SPIRIT of The Axe is not one of
pessimism but of optimism. The Axe ) ell is for limes of
crises—when a football game is at a critical point we "Give
Em the Axe." Stanford's football record this season does not
I'licil great hope for llig (fame but all the more reason to
"(rive 'Em the Axe.''
That The Axe is an object of traditional optimism is shown
in the work of the Immortal 21 and in attempts by Cal students
lo steal The Axe. These have felt the SPIRIT behind llie Axe.
To say that we will "wait and see" whether we win is to reveal
that our optimism is failing; our pride in the great traditions of
Stanford and The Axe is shaky.
( While it takes more than optimism to win a football game,
Came lias often been a contest isolated from the regular season
play : removed from seasonal competition by the SPIRIT of Stan

The Legislature's "wait and see" policy is only a recommenda
tion, but it carries the force of an instruction to the student finan
cial manager not lo sign any contracts until they've "seen."' This
"recommendation" will be ignored onlv if the students feel keenly
enough about The Axe to pressure Legislature into immediate
act ion.
This action should be to put The Axe on display no later
than llig dame Heck—with proper ceremony. Part of Stan
ford, and part of llig Game in particular, is the SPIRI T sym
bolized by The Axe. To go through llig (fame It eek with a
negative attitude, such as lliat shown by the Legislature, is to
spell defeat, possibly on the gridiron, but more certainly to
the I radii ion itself.
Some of the opposition against displaying The Axe at all has
stemmed from the possibility of attempts of Cal students lo steal

attempt. If students are so little concerned will) the tradition of

True, the sight of The Axe is tempting to would-be thieves,
bill also the sight of The Axe is conducive to greater SPIRII

existence of The Axe is not important in itself: rather it is the
intangible feelings which it conveys, and this year, wilh football
competition bringing the accompanying spirits to a low, these
intangible feelings cannot be captured in one quick view of The
Axe at Big Game.
The tradition of The Axe is an integral part of the SPIRIT
of the I niversit\ and needs only a little rekindling to make it live.
To bring The Axe lo the students before Rig Game will be to
provide the needed flame of spirit.
