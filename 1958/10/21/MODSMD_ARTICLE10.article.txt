# Quemoy Under Fire Again
## Reds Break Cease-fire; Peace Talks Uncertain 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa (/P)—Red China's siege guns barked out an end
to its self-imposed cease-fire around Quemoy Monday, laying a grave
new situation before Secretary of State Dulles in his talks with Na
tionalist Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek.
The Reds broke their 15-day cease-fire by pouring in more than

11,000 shells on Quemoy and oth
er islands in two hours and 45
minutes. Later their guns turned
to the Tan islets, a few miles off
the Red island bastion of Amoy.
Nationalist supply ships caught
at Quemoy beaches when the bar
rage opened were slightly dam
aged, the Nationalists said.
The reinforced Nationalist gar
risons on Quemoy answered the
Red fire. There was no report,
however, on the intensity of the
return fire.
Reds Blame U.S.
The Communists tried to blame
the end to the cease-fire on the
United States. A Peiping broad
cast said the cease-fire was in
valid on the grounds that the Na
tionalists had "introduced U.S.
naval vessels to provide escort"
into Quemoy waters Sunday night
and early Monday morning.
The U.S. Taiwan (Formosa)
Defense Command called the
charge false and issused a catego
rical denial. The command said
that "U.S. naval forces have scru
pulously abided by the U.S. order
to stop escorting operations since
the cessation of Communist shell
ing.
In Washington, the U.S. State
Department said the United
States has not resumed convoy
ing Chinese Nationalist supply
ships to Quemoy and will not re
vive the U.S. escort system unless
compelled to do so by military
necessity.
Dry dock Afloat
A spokesman for the Taiwan
Defense Command acknowledged
that an American floating dry
dock, known as a landing ship
dock, had carried three 80-ton Na
tionalist supply ships in its water
filled hold across the Formosa
Strait and launched them to Que
moy.
But, he said, the LSD and a
non-escorting American destroy
er, the McCain, had stayed 15
miles away from Quemoy. He
said the ships were careful to
avoid violating "even the claimed
territorial waters"—referring to
Red China's claim of a 12 - mile
coastal limit.
Reports from Quemoy said Red
China's bombardment caught the
island napping and a number of
civilians were listed among casu
alties. The report gave no fig
ures.
Caught Off-Guard
Renewal of the bombardment
began before the Nationalists
were able to warn people to take
shelter. Civilians were caught in
fields and roads. Troops working
i?i the fields also were caught in
the momentary panic that grip
ped the island, Quemoy sources
said.
There was widespread feeling
in Taipei that the Communists
had used the presence of an
American LSD in the general
area as a ready-made excuse to
resume bombardment on the eve
of Dulles' arrival.
The Nationalist Chinese have
called all of the Red actions a
campaign to drive a wedge be
tween the United States and Na
tionalist China.
Nationalists see the cease-fire
termination as putting a crimp in
U.S. talk of persuading Chiang to
reduce Nationalist troop strength
in the offshore islands as a means
of coaxing Red China to make the
cease-fire permanent.

Shu Van Lost Right Arm from Communist Shelling
TAIPEI, Formosa (/P)—Red China's siege guns barked out an end
to its self-imposed cease-fire around Quemoy Monday, laying a grave
new situation before Secretary of State Dulles in his talks with Na
tionalist Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek.
The Reds broke their 15-day cease-fire by pouring in more than

11,000 shells on Quemoy and oth
er islands in two hours and 45
minutes. Later their guns turned
to the Tan islets, a few miles off
the Red island bastion of Amoy.
Nationalist supply ships caught
at Quemoy beaches when the bar
rage opened were slightly dam
aged, the Nationalists said.
The reinforced Nationalist gar
risons on Quemoy answered the
Red fire. There was no report,
however, on the intensity of the
return fire.
Reds Blame U.S.
The Communists tried to blame
the end to the cease-fire on the
United States. A Peiping broad
cast said the cease-fire was in
valid on the grounds that the Na
tionalists had "introduced U.S.
naval vessels to provide escort"
into Quemoy waters Sunday night
and early Monday morning.
The U.S. Taiwan (Formosa)
Defense Command called the
charge false and issused a catego
rical denial. The command said
that "U.S. naval forces have scru
pulously abided by the U.S. order
to stop escorting operations since
the cessation of Communist shell
ing.
In Washington, the U.S. State
Department said the United
States has not resumed convoy
ing Chinese Nationalist supply
ships to Quemoy and will not re
vive the U.S. escort system unless
compelled to do so by military
necessity.
Dry dock Afloat
A spokesman for the Taiwan
Defense Command acknowledged
that an American floating dry
dock, known as a landing ship
dock, had carried three 80-ton Na
tionalist supply ships in its water
filled hold across the Formosa
Strait and launched them to Que
moy.
But, he said, the LSD and a
non-escorting American destroy
er, the McCain, had stayed 15
miles away from Quemoy. He
said the ships were careful to
avoid violating "even the claimed
territorial waters"—referring to
Red China's claim of a 12 - mile
coastal limit.
Reports from Quemoy said Red
China's bombardment caught the
island napping and a number of
civilians were listed among casu
alties. The report gave no fig
ures.
Caught Off-Guard
Renewal of the bombardment
began before the Nationalists
were able to warn people to take
shelter. Civilians were caught in
fields and roads. Troops working
i?i the fields also were caught in
the momentary panic that grip
ped the island, Quemoy sources
said.
There was widespread feeling
in Taipei that the Communists
had used the presence of an
American LSD in the general
area as a ready-made excuse to
resume bombardment on the eve
of Dulles' arrival.
The Nationalist Chinese have
called all of the Red actions a
campaign to drive a wedge be
tween the United States and Na
tionalist China.
Nationalists see the cease-fire
termination as putting a crimp in
U.S. talk of persuading Chiang to
reduce Nationalist troop strength
in the offshore islands as a means
of coaxing Red China to make the
cease-fire permanent.
