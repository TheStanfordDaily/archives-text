# Thief's Loot Still Untraced
## 
### 
The investigation is still pend
ing, reports the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Of fire, of the re
cent burglary of the Stanford Mu
seum.
Rare Greek jewelry and coins,
valued at $2100, were stolen from
(he Museum before this quarter
began, and a futile attempt was
made to steal Stanford's historic
gold spike, which is on display in
a specially designed safe in the
Museum.
According to the Sheriff's Of
fice, negative results were ob
tained from fingerprinting, and
no results have come from pic
tures which have been distributed
to pawnbrokers and antique deal
ers of the jewelry.
Apparently the thief used a key
to enter and leave the Museum,
report the investigators, and
there is evidence that he discon
nected the burglar alarm system
from the inside of the building as
an added precaution.
Gold jewelry and coins were
taken from two display cases in
the Museum and the thief failed
in his attempt, to break through
the safety glass on the front of
the safe in which the spike was
displayed.
