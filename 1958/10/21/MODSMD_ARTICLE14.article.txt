Tin Worm) Umvkksity Skkyici: is a not-unfamiliar organization
fo this University campus ami many others like it throughout the
world. Il is not a charity in the usual sense ol the word, however
- a fact obscured bv the connotative term "W US Drive.
Soliciting money for charities of all descriptions is a well
estahlished American tradition. On most college campuses, and
Stanford particularly, the quest for money is conducted at one
time a consolidated drive. WIS lias its own drive, rightly
enough, for the philosophy of this organization is not simply to
give to those who need, hut to supplement the resources of those
who have not quite enough. "Helping others to liclp themselves
seems a trite explanation, hut correct.
Those who receive \\ US help are not unfamiliar to us at Stan
ford, or to the legions of university ami college students through
out the world who have given so generously since the huropean
Student Kelief was estahlished in I ( >2<> to meet urgent material
needs among miiversitv students caused by the first World War.
Assistance lo students and universities in need was neither careless
charity nor prejudiced politics. I lien, as now. il was administered
on sound economic lines. Kxcept where students were physically
11uaide to work, money was not giyen directly hut used as capital
In slarl self-help enterprises.
Aid teas provided without any discrimination on
grounds of race, creed, or nationality. Ability and proven
need (done icere the criteria. If I S. officially founded in
I')!)(), has carried oil the tradition of its parent organi
zation.
W US is farsighted, too. allotting its funds so as lo solve basic
problems rather than temporary, present needs. Ihe work of
W US lodav is planned under four fields ol action, through which
programs and work are integrated within university communities
in 41 countries: I) student lodging and living, 2) student health,
| educational facilities and equipment, and II individual and
emergency aid. Ihe Administration and faculty of Stanford plan
and provide these essentials for us —and have done admirably,
eonsidcring the disproportionate increase of recognized need over
available finances — but the students of less fortunate circum
stances, notahlv in southeastern Asia, the far hast and the Middle
hast, must attempt to provide these for themselves.
(riving to W US, then, has more far-reaching effects than would
appear on the surface. Students in underdeveloped or war-torn
areas feel a real moral obligation to obtain education in order that
they may prov ide their countries \\ il ll the wise leadership requi
site to stability, unity and prosperity. They are willing to sacrifice
a great deal to obtain knowledge: W US gives them a helping hand
with no strings attached. It is hoped that with this assistance the
students will reach their goal. Usually those who have received
give WIS valuable information concerning successful approaches
lo meeting urgent needs —and they give money, too. when they
are able.

Til rough HIS. people of many different rates,
nations, and political and religions beliefs even former
enemies have been inspired to work shoulder to shoul
der. learning that there might be something to say for
the oilier man's point of view; that in this world there
are feu' cases of black and white.
\\ e who contribute at Stanford are participants of university
communities of seven major regions of I lie world, joined to pro
vide material assistance which inevitabh and increasingly will
lead lo new contributions to education lor international uiuler
slamlin<£ and collaboration. Il is a small ellorl which nia\ well
accomplish a long-sought world peace.
