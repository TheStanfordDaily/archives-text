# PRESIDENT'S REPORT
## Next Step for Axe 
### John Bohn ASSU President 
What shall we do with The
Axe? This question is the current
major concern of the Legislature.
Though it was decided, after
lengthy discussion, against in
stilling The Axe in the Cellar be
fore Big Game, the money has
already been appropriated and
awaits disposal.
It is important here to point
out some of the reasons why Leg
islature decided as il did. As soon
;is we put The Axe in the Cellar,
we begin our contract obligation
with ihe California Burglar
Alarm Company. The possibility
arises I hat we might make a capi
tal outlay of $280 to install The
Axe for only two or three weeks
of this year. By waiting until
after the game or until Stanford
is assured of possession of The
Axe for the following year, we
delay the assumption of this obli
gation. The only monetary saving
in such a policy, however, is con
tingent on the possibility that (1 >
the original cost of (he installa
tion remains the same when the
decision is finally made to install
The Axe; and (2) by delaying the
assumption of the contract, an
extra year may be obtained from
the contract at the same yearly
cost as quoted at the beginning of
the contract period. In addition,
each time The Axe is removed Ihe
ASSIJ incurs an expense of $25.
It is important to note that

no money is actually being
saved by waiting milil alter the
gallic beyond the $25 mentioned.
However, members of tin* Leg
islature spent the week previ
to last Thursday night's discus
sion in gathering student opin
ion oil The Axe question. It'
their findings are in error, then
it is the responsibility of the
student body to correct them.
Elections are the next order of
j business. John Richards, Elec
-1 lions Commission chairman, has
| already begun work on them and
I primary elections are tentatively
| scheduled for Nov. 12 and 13.
Richards has- shown a great
deal of industry and has done a
good deal of preliminary work
already. It is his hope and mine
that students interest e d in
working on the Election Com
mission will contact either him
or me as soon as possible. The
announcement of formal try
outs will lie made in a few days.
The other important item on
I our agenda last week was the
! proposed Athletic Board changes,
j Recognizing the inadequacy of
the proposed measure with re
j gard to an over-all athletic pro
j gram at Stanford, the Legislature
tabled the proposed changes in
order to allow them, through con
ference with those concerned, a
chance to develop an over-all and
comprehensive athletic program,
i I meet with the Dean this after-
I noon for the first of a series of
I discussions on this question.

However, members of tin* Leg
islature spent the week previ
to last Thursday night's discus
sion in gathering student opin
ion oil The Axe question. It'
their findings are in error, then
it is the responsibility of the
student body to correct them.
Elections are the next order of
j business. John Richards, Elec
-1 lions Commission chairman, has
| already begun work on them and
I primary elections are tentatively

Richards has- shown a great
deal of industry and has done a
good deal of preliminary work
already. It is his hope and mine
that students interest e d in
working on the Election Com
mission will contact either him
or me as soon as possible. The
announcement of formal try
outs will lie made in a few days.
The other important item on
I our agenda last week was the
! proposed Athletic Board changes,
j Recognizing the inadequacy of
the proposed measure with re
j gard to an over-all athletic pro
j gram at Stanford, the Legislature
tabled the proposed changes in
order to allow them, through con
ference with those concerned, a
chance to develop an over-all and
comprehensive athletic program,
i I meet with the Dean this after-
I noon for the first of a series of
I discussions on this question.
What shall we do with The
Axe? This question is the current
major concern of the Legislature.
Though it was decided, after
lengthy discussion, against in
stilling The Axe in the Cellar be
fore Big Game, the money has
already been appropriated and
awaits disposal.
It is important here to point
out some of the reasons why Leg
islature decided as il did. As soon
;is we put The Axe in the Cellar,
we begin our contract obligation
with ihe California Burglar
Alarm Company. The possibility
arises I hat we might make a capi
tal outlay of $280 to install The
Axe for only two or three weeks
of this year. By waiting until
after the game or until Stanford
is assured of possession of The
Axe for the following year, we
delay the assumption of this obli
gation. The only monetary saving
in such a policy, however, is con
tingent on the possibility that (1 >
the original cost of (he installa
tion remains the same when the
decision is finally made to install
The Axe; and (2) by delaying the
assumption of the contract, an
extra year may be obtained from
the contract at the same yearly
cost as quoted at the beginning of
the contract period. In addition,
each time The Axe is removed Ihe
ASSIJ incurs an expense of $25.
