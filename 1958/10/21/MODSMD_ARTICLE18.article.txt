### WALTER LIPPMANN 
On behalf of Mr. Dulles, whose ]
press conferences have such a be
wildering variety, we must re
member that he is doing some
thing which has rarely, if ever,
been done before. He is conduct
ing a delicate and difficult three
cornered negotiation — with the
two Chinese governments and
with our principal European al
lies. Parallel with it, he is con
ducting a series of press confer
ences. In these he is concerned
not so much with the disclosure
of the facts as with saving face
in Formosa, in Washington, on
Mr. Nixon's circuit, and among
his critics at home and abroad.
The trouble lies in 1 li*» at
tempt to combine an intricate
secret negotiation with a con
tinual outpouring of public pro
nouncements. Thus, it is evi
dent that it' there is to be any
kind of understanding with Pei
ping, it will have to be one in
which nothing is agreed to in
principle though concessions
are made in fact. It is evident,
too, that if concessions are to
be made, Mr. Dulles must in
duce Chiang to make them
without forcing Chiang to ad
mit that he has made them.
Granting that this is all neces
sary, is it also necessary to ac
company it by so many contradic
tory public statements? For
while most people have rather
short memories, there are a large
number of responsible people in
the capitals of the world who can
remember what was said from
one week to the next.
These people would rather be
told honestly that the negotia
tions are delicate and must be

secret than to be told so many j
different things'.
Mr. Dulles is much concerned,
and fairly enough, with saving i
Chiang's face. He is much con
cerned, and rightly, that Red
China should not think that he
is running away. He is much con
cerned, excesively perhaps, with
avoiding having a compromsie
called appeasement. But he
should also be concerned that the
word of the Secretary of State
is believed and is trusted.
It would be a great relief, and

jit would enhance (he prestige of
i this country, if the Secretary of
State announced that the situa
tion had entered a phase where
the issues are too delicate and
critical to be discussed in public
statements. Most people would
believe him. Most people would
accept his decision. And a great
deed of the embarrassment caused
by the twisting and turning
would be avoided.

Mr. Dulles is much concerned,
and fairly enough, with saving i
Chiang's face. He is much con
cerned, and rightly, that Red
China should not think that he
is running away. He is much con
cerned, excesively perhaps, with
avoiding having a compromsie
called appeasement. But he
should also be concerned that the
word of the Secretary of State
is believed and is trusted.
It would be a great relief, and

jit would enhance (he prestige of
i this country, if the Secretary of
State announced that the situa
tion had entered a phase where
the issues are too delicate and
critical to be discussed in public
statements. Most people would
believe him. Most people would
accept his decision. And a great
deed of the embarrassment caused
by the twisting and turning
would be avoided.

On behalf of Mr. Dulles, whose ]
press conferences have such a be
wildering variety, we must re
member that he is doing some
thing which has rarely, if ever,
been done before. He is conduct
ing a delicate and difficult three
cornered negotiation — with the
two Chinese governments and
with our principal European al
lies. Parallel with it, he is con
ducting a series of press confer
ences. In these he is concerned
not so much with the disclosure
of the facts as with saving face
in Formosa, in Washington, on
Mr. Nixon's circuit, and among
his critics at home and abroad.
The trouble lies in 1 li*» at
tempt to combine an intricate
secret negotiation with a con
tinual outpouring of public pro
nouncements. Thus, it is evi
dent that it' there is to be any
kind of understanding with Pei
ping, it will have to be one in
which nothing is agreed to in
principle though concessions
are made in fact. It is evident,
too, that if concessions are to
be made, Mr. Dulles must in
duce Chiang to make them
without forcing Chiang to ad
mit that he has made them.
Granting that this is all neces
sary, is it also necessary to ac
company it by so many contradic
tory public statements? For
while most people have rather
short memories, there are a large
number of responsible people in
the capitals of the world who can
remember what was said from
one week to the next.
