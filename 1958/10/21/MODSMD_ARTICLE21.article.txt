### Dick Barnes 
The Fall of Tradition—Mavbe

A young tradition will go down the drain Saturday in Los Angeles
when some Indians and Bruins' have a contest on the Coliseum turf
that is, it'll go down the drain if the game isn't a tie.
The nasty young tradition is that a coach in his first year at one
of the four major California universities doesn't win more than one
game.
It all started last year. Don Clark could salvage only a 19-12 vic
tory over Washington in his maiden season at USC, and his first-year
counterpart at California, Pete Elliott, could gain only a win over the
hapless Trojans.
Then came 1958, and new coaches at Stanford and UCLA. It's no

secret what has happened here:
one win for ( actus .lack. Down at \
UCLA, the boys came up with a i
victory for (Jeorge Dickerson
against Illinois. But the shock of |
that, added to his previous one- i
man rampage to the Bay Area,
must have been too much for
(ieorge, because now he's in the
IICI.A medical center, the victim
of nervous exhaustion.
So, Billy Barnes moved into the |
head man's job at Bruinville. :
Bill went out for his win pretty £
early, getting ii in only his second £
game at the helm.
This victory for him folded up
the script, because now when
Curtice and Barnes face off Sat
urday, one of them is going to
wind up with a second win in his
first season unless there's a tie.
Come to think of it, though,
the tradition isn't really very nice
seems like a sort of mean wayL
in treat newcomers. About theß
best way explode it would beß
for the big "2" to go up in the|
Curtice conquest column.

Curtice has stressed simplicity of offense the past two weeks, but
maybe the play he needs is the one used a couple of Saturdays ago
by Warwick, N.Y., High School. Here, from the Newark, N.J., Sun
day News is the full story.
WARWICK, N.Y. —Army's "lonely end" lias nothing: on George
Danbcrt, tin* capricious center of Warwick High's football team.
In Warwick's 40-6 rout of Franklin [N.J.| here yesterday, Dau
ber! carried the ball twice from his center post, once for eight
yards and again for 22 yards and a touchdown.
The play worked like this-:
Daubert passed the ball to T-quarterback Dave Morgan, who
appeared to fumble intentionally. Daubert scooped up the pigskin
and ran with it.
After the touchdown, Franklin's co-captain Bob Edwards pro
tested in vain to the officials as Warwick went on to rack up the
most one-sided victory margin in the school's 50-year rivalry.
Yes, this sounds just like what we need. And looking at Stanford
bobble stats, maybe the fumble would look pretty natural.
# « #
There may not have been much to cheer about Saturday, but one
thing that looked impressive was Bob Peterson's work under Indian
punts. On three separate occasions, Peterson .smashed into Falcon
receivers about one-tenth of a second after the ball was caught.
It's by far the best the Indians have seen on punt coverage this
season. Combined with Rick McMillen's good kicking in the first
three games (he was hurt, so didn't punt Saturday), Stanford is
showing potential of being top-flight in at least one department of
the game.
Harriers Seek a Fifth
The football team isn't the only outfit around here that will have
b) put in a lot of work this week before heading for the Southland.
Payton Jordan's cross-country forces, although winning easily over
the Air Force here Saturday, showed two big weaknesses which can
stand correction.
First, the Cards need to develop a strong fifth man to go along
with the top four of Keith Wallace, Bob Monzingo, Doug Martin and
Larry Suelzle.
These four took the top spots against the Falcons, but four Air
Force men got home before the fifth Indian crossed the line. Against
ihe stronger Bruins and Trojans this weekend, such a lag could cost
the Tribe plenty in the scoring column.
Jordan is concerned about the situation, and said he'll have to run
a special race today over the full four-mile course to determine what
other three men will accompany the first four south.
The other area where the Indians need work is in hill-climbing.
Even on the not-too-steep hill portion of the Stanford course, too
many of the locals lost ground to the Academy boys. Noting that the
UCI.A course is much steeper than the one here, Jordan said he'd
have his men running hills all week to get ready for the Saturday
meet.
Back to the fifth-man problem, it doesn't look as if Jordan will
find him on his "second" team of harriers. In another race Saturday
morning, the second team was trounced by Palo Alto High, 18-43. Of
course Paly has the best prep team in the state, and probably in the
nation. But when two 15-year-olds come in 20 seconds ahead of the
first Stanford finisher, it begins to look like its time for some run
ners to get to work.

must have been too much for
(ieorge, because now he's in the

of nervous exhaustion.
So, Billy Barnes moved into the |

Bill went out for his win pretty £
early, getting ii in only his second £
game at the helm.
This victory for him folded up
the script, because now when
Curtice and Barnes face off Sat
urday, one of them is going to
wind up with a second win in his
first season unless there's a tie.
Come to think of it, though,
the tradition isn't really very nice
seems like a sort of mean wayL
in treat newcomers. About theß
best way explode it would beß
for the big "2" to go up in the|
Curtice conquest column.

Curtice has stressed simplicity of offense the past two weeks, but
maybe the play he needs is the one used a couple of Saturdays ago
by Warwick, N.Y., High School. Here, from the Newark, N.J., Sun
day News is the full story.
WARWICK, N.Y. —Army's "lonely end" lias nothing: on George
Danbcrt, tin* capricious center of Warwick High's football team.
In Warwick's 40-6 rout of Franklin [N.J.| here yesterday, Dau
ber! carried the ball twice from his center post, once for eight
yards and again for 22 yards and a touchdown.
The play worked like this-:
Daubert passed the ball to T-quarterback Dave Morgan, who
appeared to fumble intentionally. Daubert scooped up the pigskin
and ran with it.
After the touchdown, Franklin's co-captain Bob Edwards pro
tested in vain to the officials as Warwick went on to rack up the
most one-sided victory margin in the school's 50-year rivalry.
Yes, this sounds just like what we need. And looking at Stanford
bobble stats, maybe the fumble would look pretty natural.
# « #
There may not have been much to cheer about Saturday, but one
thing that looked impressive was Bob Peterson's work under Indian
punts. On three separate occasions, Peterson .smashed into Falcon
receivers about one-tenth of a second after the ball was caught.
It's by far the best the Indians have seen on punt coverage this
season. Combined with Rick McMillen's good kicking in the first
three games (he was hurt, so didn't punt Saturday), Stanford is
showing potential of being top-flight in at least one department of
the game.
Harriers Seek a Fifth
The football team isn't the only outfit around here that will have
b) put in a lot of work this week before heading for the Southland.
Payton Jordan's cross-country forces, although winning easily over
the Air Force here Saturday, showed two big weaknesses which can
stand correction.
First, the Cards need to develop a strong fifth man to go along
with the top four of Keith Wallace, Bob Monzingo, Doug Martin and
Larry Suelzle.
These four took the top spots against the Falcons, but four Air
Force men got home before the fifth Indian crossed the line. Against
ihe stronger Bruins and Trojans this weekend, such a lag could cost
the Tribe plenty in the scoring column.
Jordan is concerned about the situation, and said he'll have to run
a special race today over the full four-mile course to determine what
other three men will accompany the first four south.
The other area where the Indians need work is in hill-climbing.
Even on the not-too-steep hill portion of the Stanford course, too
many of the locals lost ground to the Academy boys. Noting that the
UCI.A course is much steeper than the one here, Jordan said he'd
have his men running hills all week to get ready for the Saturday
meet.
Back to the fifth-man problem, it doesn't look as if Jordan will
find him on his "second" team of harriers. In another race Saturday
morning, the second team was trounced by Palo Alto High, 18-43. Of
course Paly has the best prep team in the state, and probably in the
nation. But when two 15-year-olds come in 20 seconds ahead of the
first Stanford finisher, it begins to look like its time for some run
ners to get to work.

Only Salvaged One
The Fall of Tradition—Mavbe

A young tradition will go down the drain Saturday in Los Angeles
when some Indians and Bruins' have a contest on the Coliseum turf
that is, it'll go down the drain if the game isn't a tie.
The nasty young tradition is that a coach in his first year at one
of the four major California universities doesn't win more than one
game.
It all started last year. Don Clark could salvage only a 19-12 vic
tory over Washington in his maiden season at USC, and his first-year
counterpart at California, Pete Elliott, could gain only a win over the
hapless Trojans.
Then came 1958, and new coaches at Stanford and UCLA. It's no

secret what has happened here:

best way explode it would beß
for the big "2" to go up in the|
Curtice conquest column.

Curtice has stressed simplicity of offense the past two weeks, but
maybe the play he needs is the one used a couple of Saturdays ago
by Warwick, N.Y., High School. Here, from the Newark, N.J., Sun
day News is the full story.
WARWICK, N.Y. —Army's "lonely end" lias nothing: on George
Danbcrt, tin* capricious center of Warwick High's football team.
In Warwick's 40-6 rout of Franklin [N.J.| here yesterday, Dau
ber! carried the ball twice from his center post, once for eight
yards and again for 22 yards and a touchdown.
The play worked like this-:
Daubert passed the ball to T-quarterback Dave Morgan, who
appeared to fumble intentionally. Daubert scooped up the pigskin
and ran with it.
After the touchdown, Franklin's co-captain Bob Edwards pro
tested in vain to the officials as Warwick went on to rack up the
most one-sided victory margin in the school's 50-year rivalry.
Yes, this sounds just like what we need. And looking at Stanford
bobble stats, maybe the fumble would look pretty natural.
# « #
There may not have been much to cheer about Saturday, but one
thing that looked impressive was Bob Peterson's work under Indian
punts. On three separate occasions, Peterson .smashed into Falcon
receivers about one-tenth of a second after the ball was caught.
It's by far the best the Indians have seen on punt coverage this
season. Combined with Rick McMillen's good kicking in the first
three games (he was hurt, so didn't punt Saturday), Stanford is
showing potential of being top-flight in at least one department of
the game.
Harriers Seek a Fifth
The football team isn't the only outfit around here that will have
b) put in a lot of work this week before heading for the Southland.
Payton Jordan's cross-country forces, although winning easily over
the Air Force here Saturday, showed two big weaknesses which can
stand correction.
First, the Cards need to develop a strong fifth man to go along
with the top four of Keith Wallace, Bob Monzingo, Doug Martin and
Larry Suelzle.
These four took the top spots against the Falcons, but four Air
Force men got home before the fifth Indian crossed the line. Against
ihe stronger Bruins and Trojans this weekend, such a lag could cost
the Tribe plenty in the scoring column.
Jordan is concerned about the situation, and said he'll have to run
a special race today over the full four-mile course to determine what
other three men will accompany the first four south.
The other area where the Indians need work is in hill-climbing.
Even on the not-too-steep hill portion of the Stanford course, too
many of the locals lost ground to the Academy boys. Noting that the
UCI.A course is much steeper than the one here, Jordan said he'd
have his men running hills all week to get ready for the Saturday
meet.
Back to the fifth-man problem, it doesn't look as if Jordan will
find him on his "second" team of harriers. In another race Saturday
morning, the second team was trounced by Palo Alto High, 18-43. Of
course Paly has the best prep team in the state, and probably in the
nation. But when two 15-year-olds come in 20 seconds ahead of the
first Stanford finisher, it begins to look like its time for some run
ners to get to work.

The Fall of Tradition—Mavbe

A young tradition will go down the drain Saturday in Los Angeles
when some Indians and Bruins' have a contest on the Coliseum turf
that is, it'll go down the drain if the game isn't a tie.
The nasty young tradition is that a coach in his first year at one
of the four major California universities doesn't win more than one
game.
It all started last year. Don Clark could salvage only a 19-12 vic
tory over Washington in his maiden season at USC, and his first-year
counterpart at California, Pete Elliott, could gain only a win over the
hapless Trojans.
Then came 1958, and new coaches at Stanford and UCLA. It's no

secret what has happened here:
one win for ( actus .lack. Down at \
UCLA, the boys came up with a i
victory for (Jeorge Dickerson
against Illinois. But the shock of |
that, added to his previous one- i
man rampage to the Bay Area,
must have been too much for
(ieorge, because now he's in the
IICI.A medical center, the victim
of nervous exhaustion.
So, Billy Barnes moved into the |
head man's job at Bruinville. :
Bill went out for his win pretty £
early, getting ii in only his second £
game at the helm.
This victory for him folded up
the script, because now when
Curtice and Barnes face off Sat
urday, one of them is going to
wind up with a second win in his
first season unless there's a tie.
Come to think of it, though,
the tradition isn't really very nice
seems like a sort of mean wayL
in treat newcomers. About theß
best way explode it would beß
for the big "2" to go up in the|
