## Bruins Plan Surprises 
### 
LOS ANGELES (>P) â€” Head
Coach Billy Barnes of UCLA
Monday promised more surprises
when his team plays Stanford
here Saturday.
Barnes came up with a surprise
spread formation last week that
the coach said was the key to the
Bruins' 20-0 victory over Wash
ington.
"Yes, we plan to put in some
thing new for Stanford. I know
we were well scouted at Seattle
and I am sure Stanford can fash
ion a solid defense for our spread.
"So we'll add a few new wrin
kles to go with what we have."
Is he abandoning the single

wing attack installed and per
fected at UCLA by the late coach,
Red Sanders?
"Definitely not," Barnes replied
quickly.
Six seniors played out their
limit of five games at Seattle, in
payment of penalties imposed by
the Pacific Coast Conference
against UCLA.
Barnes said he hoped to elevate
the underclasssmen to carry on.
His starting backfield against
Stanford will probably be Chuck
Kendall or Jim Steffen at left
half, Marvin Luster at right half,
Ray Smith at fullback and Dave
Peterson at quarterback.
