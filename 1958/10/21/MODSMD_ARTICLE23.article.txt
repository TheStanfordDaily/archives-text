## Juggled UCLA Next Card Foe 
### 
UCLA, probably the most juggled-up team in the nation, is the
next foe for Stanford's slightly crippfed and still hungry Indians.
The Bruins will have to send a senior-less lineup into action as
I hey try to stop the Tribe's Southland invasion Saturday.
Troubles started this summer when Coach Red Sanders died

shortly before the season started.
Sanders was replaced by his top
assistant, George Dickerson, but
the season had hardly started be
fore Dickerson was hospitalized
with a nervous condition and lost
for the season.
Anot h e r ex - assistant, Bill !
Barnes, is now the Bruin head
coach. But the calamity of Ihe |
whole situation became evident ;i
week ago when Jim Dawson, in- {
jured senior tackle, was hired as
an assistant coach.
For that matter, UCLA may
now have six more excellent
coaches, as that many Bruin live
game seniors played their last
collegiate game last week against
Washington. Performing their
duties for the last time in Seattle
were All-American end Dick Wal

len, tailback Don Long, tackle
Bill Leeka, center Dick Butler,
guard Clint Whitfield and block
ing back Steve Ger\sman.
On the Stanford side, star half
hack Rick McMillen is expected to
be ready for action Saturday.
After his fabulous showing
against Washington two weeks
ago, the junior speedster came up
I with a severely sprained ankle
! early in Saturday's Air Force en
counter. The injury was diag
nosed as sprined ankle ligaments
and trainer Connie Jarvis report
ed McMillen should he ready by
Saturday.
The Cards will he facing one of
the several puzzling Pacific Coast
Conference teams. Only once so
far this season have the {Jruins
shown the class expected of them
at season's start.
UCLA's one convincing show
i ing came last week, when it
I ruined Washington's Ilomecom
| ing with a decisive 20-0 victory.
Previously, the Bruins had beat
en only Illinois, in an 18-14,
; squeaker, and had been pasted by
Pittsburgh, Oregon State and Flor
ida.
But Don Long, the lad who I
fashioned the BIG conquest in the
north, is out of this one. Long
closed his career by racking up j
157 yards in total offense and was
generally the whole show against
the Huskies.
The senior tailback had given :
UCLA some of its finest passing
in history . . . especially in the |
era of the Sanders-installed single
wing. His main target, Dick Wal
len, is another of the seniors now
out of the picture. Two weeks
I ago, Wallen cracked a Bruin rec
ord with 10 receptions against
Florida.
But all along the Bruins have
taken insurance measures for the
i loss of Long by slowly working
end Jim Steffen into the tailback
position. Steffen saw a little ac
tion against Oregon State and
then teamed with Long against
Florida to set a new UCLA record
for pass completions. Long was
14-for-20 and Steffen 6-for-14 to
shatter a 16-year-old record of 16
completions.
Both of the Bruin triumphs this
season were on the road. They
bring a 1-1 conference record and
an 0-2 Coliseum mark into Satur-1
day's game.
