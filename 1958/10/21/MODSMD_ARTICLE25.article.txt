GENEVA (/P) â€” The Swiss Ice
Hockey Federation has decided to
ban the participation of a Rusian
team in an international tourna
ment in Geneva next month, the
Conservative newspaper "Tri
bune de Genevre" reported Mon
day.

The paper said the ban "has
nothing whatever to do with sport
and is most regrettable and em
barrassing to the organizers."
