# Cal's Bears Smell Roses
## 
### 
California's Golden Bear's ap
parently like that long • absent
taste of victory, for they
squeaked out their third straight
win, 14-12, over Southern Califor
nia Saturday and made them
selves suddenly the No. 1 Pacific*
Coast Conference Rose Bowl con
tender.
But while Berkeleyites were
wiping the dust off of their Pasa
dena maps, Wasshington State re
minded everybody it was still
around with a stunning 6 0 upset

of Oregon in Eugene. This also
left Cal alone on top in loop
standings with a 2-0 mark.
Elsewhere, Oregon State re
bounded to club Idaho, 20 6, and
UCLA's seniors finished with a
20-0 win over Washington.
So, while all of the eligibles are
still in the race for the Roses—
statistically — all indications be
gan to point to a Bear-Cougar
duel for the unenviable task of
taking on the Big Ten's best on
New Year's.
Cal thumped WSC, 34-14, two
weeks ago, but the Cougars have
n't been scored upon since. And
it was a much different Washing
ton State team at Oregon, for
their newly-discovered defensive
might was threatened only one.
And even more remarkable: WSC
tried only 10 passes in the Oregon
rain (completing six) and ground
out 207 yards rushing.
The Bears were still the team
to catch, however, as they scored
two early TD's and then hung on
grimly to make those points
stand up through the final three
quarters. It was Cal's first Los
Angeles win since 1950.
WSC used its injured passing
star, Bobby Newman, only long
enough to score a lone second
quarter TD. Newman plunged
one yard to cap an 88-yard Cou
gar drive. Only two of the 10

plays in the drive were passes.
Showing its biggest offensive
of tlie season, OSC spotted Idaho
a first - quarter score and then
came back for a 20-6 triumph in
Moscow. Beaver fullback Nub
Beamer crashed for two of the
touchdowns. In Seattle, with six
seniors playing their final college
games, UCLA finally looked like
it was supposed to, thumping
staggering Washington, 20-0. Sen
ior tailback Don Long made his
swan song a memorable one, ac
counting for 157 yards running
and passing.

seniors playing their final college
games, UCLA finally looked like
it was supposed to, thumping
staggering Washington, 20-0. Sen
ior tailback Don Long made his
swan song a memorable one, ac
counting for 157 yards running
and passing.
California's Golden Bear's ap
parently like that long • absent
taste of victory, for they
squeaked out their third straight
win, 14-12, over Southern Califor
nia Saturday and made them
selves suddenly the No. 1 Pacific*
Coast Conference Rose Bowl con
tender.
But while Berkeleyites were
wiping the dust off of their Pasa
dena maps, Wasshington State re
minded everybody it was still
around with a stunning 6 0 upset

of Oregon in Eugene. This also
left Cal alone on top in loop
standings with a 2-0 mark.
Elsewhere, Oregon State re
bounded to club Idaho, 20 6, and
UCLA's seniors finished with a
20-0 win over Washington.
So, while all of the eligibles are
still in the race for the Roses—
statistically — all indications be
gan to point to a Bear-Cougar
duel for the unenviable task of
taking on the Big Ten's best on
New Year's.
Cal thumped WSC, 34-14, two
weeks ago, but the Cougars have
n't been scored upon since. And
it was a much different Washing
ton State team at Oregon, for
their newly-discovered defensive
might was threatened only one.
And even more remarkable: WSC
tried only 10 passes in the Oregon
rain (completing six) and ground
out 207 yards rushing.
The Bears were still the team
to catch, however, as they scored
two early TD's and then hung on
grimly to make those points
stand up through the final three
quarters. It was Cal's first Los
Angeles win since 1950.
WSC used its injured passing
star, Bobby Newman, only long
enough to score a lone second
quarter TD. Newman plunged
one yard to cap an 88-yard Cou
gar drive. Only two of the 10

plays in the drive were passes.
Showing its biggest offensive
of tlie season, OSC spotted Idaho
a first - quarter score and then
came back for a 20-6 triumph in
Moscow. Beaver fullback Nub
Beamer crashed for two of the
touchdowns. In Seattle, with six
