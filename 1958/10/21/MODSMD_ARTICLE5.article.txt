## Ike Urges End to Feud In California 
### 
LOS ANGELES (/P)—President
Eisenhower flew into California
Monday in a frank effort to end
feuding between the top Republi
can candidates—Senator William
F. Knowland, who is running for
governor, and Governor Goodwin
J. Knight, who is after Know
land's Senate seat.
A crowd estimated by Los An
geles police at 75,000 gave the
President an enthusiastic wel
come—complete with showers of
confetti and paper streamers —as
the Presidential motorcade moved
through downtown Los Angeles.
Eisenhower sounded a unity
appeal early in his address at the
Shrine Auditorium.
Family Bickering
"Let's have no more family
bickering—fancied or real," the
President urged. "It just helps
defeat what we want."
Then he went on, in an all-out
endorsement of the campaign tac
tics of Vice - President Nixon,
which have been criticized by
some Democrats:
"If only all of us go full out. as
our fine Vice - President, Dick
Nixon, has — we, together, will
achieve victory."
Eisenhower, until now, on a
coast -to • coast campaign swing
that began last Friday morning,
has avoided mentioning either his
own party or the Democrats by
name.
Foreign Policy
Turning to foreign policy, a
major issue in the 19.38 campaign,
Eisenhower said that under the
Republicans, "during six years of
serious international stress,
America has remained at peace"
—and that today from Lebanon
to Quemoy "those in the world
who would do us harm know that
America will not be bullied."
"They know that America will
not countenance a territorial ex
pansion by force," Eisenhower
said. "They know that America
will not desert her friends.
Appeasement Allergy
"America is allergic to appease
ment. There will be no appeasing
Communist aggression while I
am President. The record shows
that for six years no new victim
has fallen to Communist impe
rialism."
Monday night's address was the
first major speech in which the
White House's newest speech
writer, Malcolm Moos, had a
hand. It was evident from the
tone of the speech that something
new has been added to the Eisen
hower repertoire—a sort of Marry
S. Truman type give - 'em • hell
vigor in contrast with Eisenhow
er's mild and sometimes non-ex
istent endorsement of some GOP
candidates earlier in his current
3300-mile tour.
President Eisenhower will
speak at the Cow Palace in San
Francisco today at 12 noon.
