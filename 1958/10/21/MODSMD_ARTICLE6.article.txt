# Segregation Is Political Crutch, Declares Negro
## 
### 
"The integration problem in Little Rock is entirely political. With
out the term 'segregation' most Southern politicians wouldn't have
a leg to stand on."
That is how Ernest Green, a freshman at Michigan State Univer
sity and the only Negro graduate of Little Rock's Central High

School, explained the Little Rock
segregation problem at an NAA
CP Freedom Rally held Sunday
afternoon in Oakland.
"The libraries, universities,
busses and stores have all been
integrated in Little Rock without
incident; there was no reason for
violence when the schools were
integrated," explained Green. "It
was spurred on by political mo
tives, I'm sure."
Duly to Belter Self
Explaining why he and eight
other Negroes attended Central
High in the face of violence and
protest, Green sjiid, "It was our
duty to attend, because as Ameri
cans we have a right and duty to
better ourselves in the field of
education.
"The only students who caused
trouble in the school were rabble
rousers anyway, but the student
leaders, athletes and all were nice
to us.
"There arc a great number in
the South going out of their way
for the rights of other human be
ings. They know that integration
will come; % today, next year or
ten years from now."
Cites California
"There would be no trouble,"
said Green, "if every place were
like California."
On the same program with
Green were Dr. Clark Kerr, presi
dent of the University of Califor
nia, and Rafer Johnson, now stu
dent body president of UCLA and
world's decathlon champion.
