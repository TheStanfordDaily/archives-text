# Ike Tells Need For GOP Unity
## 
### Leo Krulitz 
President Dwight Eisenhower blamed Democrats yesterday for
scuttling his labor program and declared that leadership corruption
in unions "must be fumigated."
He went on to promise that in the next session of Congress he
would press for legislation to safeguard union funds and insure fair

practices in union proceedings.
The President urged the people
of California and the nation to
give him a Republican Congress
that would pass his labor meas
ures.
Turning to California politics,
Eisenhower said, "California
must be run by Californians and
not by some far-off bureaucracy
in Washington." He outlined how
the federal government is tied to
California by the defense of its
coast line, the federal highways
and many other things.
He explained, "As you grow,
there will be further demands for
additional federal services — and
it is necessary that these things
are provided for here at home."
Sane, Sound Government
The President suggested that
the conservatism of Knowland
and Knight would accomplish
this. He said that the Republi
cans will "maintain sane, sound
government that becomes con
servative when it comes to fi
nances. Republicans are opposed
to a patronizing government.
This reflects our fight against
radicalism in America,"he added.
"The over - riding question of
the day is peace," Eisenhower
said. Diverting from his prepared
text and explaining that he want
ed to deliver a more "homey
talk," the President went on to
outline the basic principles for
foreign policy that he said all
Americans agree on.
No War
This change in plans might
have resulted from a large rally
that took place in front of the
Civic Auditorium to urge "No
War Over Quemoy."
Eisenhower said he was sure
the Americans he was addressing
wouldn't be stampeded by fear.
Americans agree, he said, that
there must be an avoidance of the

use of force as an instrument of
public policy. We must keep our
force strong to maintain a firm
position from which to negotiate,"
he added. "We must stand on
principle."
"Peace requires a rising stand
ard of living throughout the
world," he went on. "We want
a peace that supports the dignity
of man."
Eisenhower gave warm praise
to Vice • President N'ixon before
the estimated 5400 people that
didn't fill the big Civil Audito
rium.
No Original Ideas
The President was introduced
by Governor Goodwin Knight
who spoke briefly of his own
campaign for the Senate. Knight
said, "I rest my case on Engle's
statement that there hasn't been
an original idea in the White
House since Harry Truman."
Senator William Knowland and
Knight sat on opposite sides of
the stage and posed briefly after
Eisenhower's speech with the
President. No comment was made
at the rally concerning the party
split, after Eisenhower had plead
ed in a speech in Los Angeles
for an end to "family bickering."
Knight was reported as having
told newsmen on the trip from
Los Angeles to San Francisco
aboard the President's plane that
"nothing has changed" between
himself and Knowland.
