## Millions for UN's Death, Says Davis 
### Duane Davis 
Millions of Americans would
like to see the United Nations die,
asserted Howard Pierce Davis, au
thoritative UN observer and high
light speaker for the lIR-sponsor
ed United Nations Week, last eve
n in g in Memorial Auditorium,
"but the presence of earnest men,
milling like ants in the UN Plaza
in New York, symbolizing man
kind's every need, creed, group
frustration, historic grudge, ten
sion, and noble yearnings and
dreams—this is the best argument
for the United Nations."
The League of Nations faded;
the United Nations might cease
existence, but the need it is ful
filling, the cause it is serving, is
always present, and an organiza
tion of similar function would rise
the very minute its predecessor
fell. Davis said.
Miserable Conditions
Davis emphasized the miserable
conditions in which most of the
world's population exists. "The
prevalence of ignorance and illit
eracy among the underprivileg
ed," he said, "and their lack of
food, clothing, homes and cultural
necessities has widened the gap
between these peoples anil such
centers of privilege as the U.S.
"Toward these centers, colonial
peoples left in the wake of the
industrial revolution, peoples in
the confusion of newly granted in
dependence, peoples frustrated by
want and poverty are directed
under the camouflage of national
ism.
"Because of their enormity, the
problems or tensions the UN is
striving to solve or mediate seem
unsolvable to people in America.
This is why UN is accused of im
polency, and its death anticipated.
"American newspapers are neg
ative toward UN endeavors; head
lines emphasize UN failings, while
little or no attention is drawn to
the progress of lesser agency proj
ects."
Mental Cycle
"This ignorant point of view,"
Davis asserted, "is due to an in
evitable mental cycle taking place
in the minds of the uninformed:
'don't know, don't, care, don't un
derstand, don't like.'
"The UN has helped needy na
tion s in technical assistance,"
Davis stated. "Millions of acres
have been reclaimed; 10 million
malaria and yaws shots have been
given; eastern Asia rice paddies
have been profitably stocked with
fish; 5500 experts from 80 nations
have been distributed in appropri
ate areas; 170,000 Hungarian ref
ugees have been resettled. The
UN has made available 17,403
scholarships for students."

striving to solve or mediate seem
unsolvable to people in America.
This is why UN is accused of im
polency, and its death anticipated.
"American newspapers are neg
ative toward UN endeavors; head
lines emphasize UN failings, while
little or no attention is drawn to
the progress of lesser agency proj
ects."
Mental Cycle
"This ignorant point of view,"
Davis asserted, "is due to an in
evitable mental cycle taking place
in the minds of the uninformed:
'don't know, don't, care, don't un
derstand, don't like.'
"The UN has helped needy na
tion s in technical assistance,"
Davis stated. "Millions of acres
have been reclaimed; 10 million
malaria and yaws shots have been
given; eastern Asia rice paddies
have been profitably stocked with
fish; 5500 experts from 80 nations
have been distributed in appropri
ate areas; 170,000 Hungarian ref
ugees have been resettled. The
UN has made available 17,403
scholarships for students."
Millions of Americans would
like to see the United Nations die,
asserted Howard Pierce Davis, au
thoritative UN observer and high
light speaker for the lIR-sponsor
ed United Nations Week, last eve
n in g in Memorial Auditorium,
"but the presence of earnest men,
milling like ants in the UN Plaza
in New York, symbolizing man
kind's every need, creed, group
frustration, historic grudge, ten
sion, and noble yearnings and
dreams—this is the best argument
for the United Nations."
The League of Nations faded;
the United Nations might cease
existence, but the need it is ful
filling, the cause it is serving, is
always present, and an organiza
tion of similar function would rise
the very minute its predecessor
fell. Davis said.
Miserable Conditions
Davis emphasized the miserable
conditions in which most of the
world's population exists. "The
prevalence of ignorance and illit
eracy among the underprivileg
ed," he said, "and their lack of
food, clothing, homes and cultural
necessities has widened the gap
between these peoples anil such
centers of privilege as the U.S.
"Toward these centers, colonial
peoples left in the wake of the
industrial revolution, peoples in
the confusion of newly granted in
dependence, peoples frustrated by
want and poverty are directed
under the camouflage of national
ism.
"Because of their enormity, the
problems or tensions the UN is
striving to solve or mediate seem
unsolvable to people in America.

polency, and its death anticipated.
