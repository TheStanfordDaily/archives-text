Expansion
Plans are now being made to
expand the organization to Latin
America, and committees have
been formed to investigate just
how much can be done in this
area, Dr. Rao said.
Dr. Rao has been with the WUS
for the past four years and was
connected with the organization in
India before that time. A seminar
held in Mysore, India, in 1917 was
responsible for his interest in the
movement.

"It is my general feeling that
the results of the World Univer
sity Service drive at Stanford Uni
versity will be overwhelming this
year," states Dr. K. Bhaskara Rao,
WUS regional executive for the
West Coast area.
"As a result of last year's drive
here, WUS has gained considera
ble momentum." Dr. Rao contin
ues. "There is increasing aware
ness of the need of a service such
as the WUS offers, and students
and faculty alike are eager to be
come a part of this organization,
whicn helps meet the needs of stu
dents and faculty members in 42
countries.
Widespread Participation
"There are about 1000 campuses
in the United States which are
now participating in the World
University Service, including a
number of junior colleges. WUS
is definitely a 100 per cent stu
dent-faculty project.
"WUS expresses a world con
cern for those less fortunate, and
our philosophy may be summed
up in a few words: it is better to
light a candle than to curse the
darkness."
This year marks a return visit
to Stanford for Dr. Rao. Last year
he spoke to, the various on-campus
living groups, just as he is doing
this year.
Dr. Rao's last appearances will
be today, when he speaks at Wil
bur in Arroyo lounge after lunch
and at Guthrie during dinner.
More Understanding
According to Dr. Rao, WUS not
only brings material relief to stu
dents, but assists their intellectual
development as well. Seminars for
students from various universities
are held, in which they discuss
their problems and thus help to
increase understanding so neces
sary throughout the world.
Also, each year there is a gen
eral assembly, in which one mem
ber nation is host to all participat
ing members, Dr. Rao explained.
This year's host was Canada, with
Nigeria slated to be host for the
1959 meeting.
