TAIPEI, Formosa (A y ) â€” Secretary of State Dulles and President
Chiang Kai-shek Tuesday opened talks made more urgent by rising
Red military action across Formosa Strait.
While Red artillery rained more than 3000 shells on Quemoy and
jets tangled over the strait, Dulles and Chiang held three meetings

totaling more than three and one
half hours. They met again on
Wednesday.
A joint communique after the
end of the conferences is expected
to express continued U.S.-Nation
alist solidarity in the face of Poi
ping's campaign to split the two
allies and force U.S. armed might
out of the western Pacific.
Seeks Common Policy
What Dulles called his "search
for a dependable cease-fire" re
quires a common U.S.-Nationalist
policy. This might include the
U.S. desire that Chiang thin his
forces on the offshore islands in
the hope that Red China would
accept a permanent cease-fire.
The Nationalist Defense Minis
try said six MlG's had tried to in
tercept eight Sabrejets on patrol.
The encounter was brief and the
Nationalist planes returned un
scathed, the ministry said.
There was a growing feeling on
Formosa that the end of the cease
fire had made it impractical to go
into topics which Dulles had plan
ned. halfway around the world, to
take up with Chiang.
Nationalists Object
Without a better idea of Red
China's latest intentions, some
topics appeared too difficult to
discuss. These include the ques
tion of reducing garrisons on Que
moy in an attempt to coax Red
China to make its cease-fire per
manent.
Another possibility is that they
may proclaim a new cease-fire, ac
companying it with a fresh invi
tation for direct talks with the
Nationalists. The latter have re
fused steadfastly to talk with the
Peiping regime.
Vice-President Chen Cheng said
that cutting the size of the off
shore island garrisons or pulling
out of the islands "would definite
ly lead to a large-scale war."
