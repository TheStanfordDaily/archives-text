( Mi'i'.D Nations Wkkk. is being observed this week on our campus,
across the nation, and throughout the world, in coininemoration
of its loundinji l.'i vears ago in San Francisco, Oct. 21, 191.").
Since its first session in London in 1 ( )46, the I N lias been in

limelight is its unceasing work through its specialized agencies

deep-rooted problems.
" I lie United Nations charter represents man s most
determined and promising effort to save humanity from
llie scourge oj war and to establish justice between the
nations." This was Secretary of Stale John Foster Dulles
era/nation of the I\ in 1 ( >54 — one that many icould
accept today, despite that organization''s shortcomings.
The problem of achieving an integrated world in a world of
national interests and resistance to change is a thorny one. Fir
every step forward, there seem to have been at least two steps
backward, a discouraging record on the surface —but not an indi
cation that the organization is a farce, conceived in an aura ol
false hope.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again . . . and even critics
of the UN must admit that the niore-than-80 member nations are
trying.
When the UN charter was adopted, the \\ est stood at the helm. |
Today voices out of the East are growing in strength. Ihe great
powers fell out with each other; the small nations filled the
breach. Discord and balance-of-power shifting are inevitable—but j
that in no way lessens the need for compromise and cooperation.
The nations of the West cannot turn their backs on a United j
Nations grown unrulv, because it is no more than a mirror ol an
equally unruly and chaotic world. Ihe nations ol the Fast cannot
gain anything from adolescently insisting that they alone were J
destined to dominate the world.
I lie UN General Assembly has been cynically referred
to as a podium for hot heads and icindbags who endlessly
air their grievances, and who have no real confidence.
that even a small majority of the members will agree to
their selfish ami narrowly nationalistic demands. II ould
it not be shortsighted to advocate the dissolution oj inter
national machinery for understanding on the basis oj this
criticism alone?
One should be reminded that the real work of any body of
such divergent economic, social and political systems as those coin
posing the roster of the United Nations is accomplished not in the
assemblv room but in the headquarters corridors; not in publicly
addressed statements but in private, informal conversations. A J
meeting of the minds cannot he achieved en masse, hut on an
individual basis.
The United Nations has more than the one function of public
debate. It's the relatively unrecognized field work—improvement
of transportation and communication facilities, social welfare,
relief and reconstruction, stability and full employment, cultural
cooperation and refugee placement that has more than justified
the establishment of the United Nations.
United Nations Week serves to remind the peoples of the world
of the formidable scope of the organization. Achievement, as well
as failure, is part of the record. It could well be called a week of
assessment and evaluation —for each of us. \\ ill you take advan
tage of informing voursell about the United Nations this iceek? \
Il*s up to you.
