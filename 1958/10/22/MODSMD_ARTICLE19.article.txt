# THE
						POLITICAL EYE
## Campaign Woes Plague Candidate 
### Leo Krulitz 
Californians these past few
weeks have been observing how
a man is attempting to save a
successful political career that
spanned over 25 years of service
and lead to the position of Senate
Majority Leader. It hasn't been
a pleasant thing to watch for
most of the people concerned.
The struggle was officially
opened with an announcement of
a change in campaign plans:
"From now on I will be found
in the factories, the shopping cen
ters and on the corner cross
roads of California. My coat is
off and I will be ringing door
bells wherever a doorbell is in
reach."
The change is evident: "(My
opponents's program) means
a little New Deal on a program
of spend and spend, tax and
tax, elect and elect, and will
lead to state control of prices,
wages, and production," lie add
ed.
The California voters have two
alternatives, he stated, "They can
vote for the individual freedom
with unlimited opportunity for
which I stand, or the final domin

ation of the labor bosses can be
accepted by voting for my oppon
ent."
He said that the program of his
opponent resmbles totalitarian
ism more than liberalism.
And My Democratic oppon
ent is a "worried, timid candidate
who has panicked."
The current chapter is being
written to link together tin*
Democratic National Commit
teeman, Paul Ziffren; the prom
inent San Francisco hotel man,
lien Swig; the Democratic gub
ernatorial candidate; and the
Chicago gangsters of the HMO's.
This is Ihe new campaign ap
proach to preserve a man in poli
tics, but many feel it is simply
destroying the name of a once
great statesman and fixing more
firmly the date of demise of a
long poliical career.
TO WHOM IT MAY CON
CEKN: The front pages of the
Chronicle reported a scandal in
City Hall recently. The city's chief
administrator found that a jani
tor had been brewing coffee and
washing dishes for personnel in
the assessor's office. The janitor
assurred the administrator, how
ever. that he hadn't drank any.
