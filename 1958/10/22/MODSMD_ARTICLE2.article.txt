# Air Defense Missiles Soar
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (/P)â€”
Two blazing Bomarc air defense
missiles roared across the Atlan
tic within 13 seconds Tuesday,
triggered by a button-pusher and
a giant electronic computer 1500
miles away.
The Bomarc double-header was
the first multiple-missile launch
ing at the Cape since it opened
eight years ago.
The Boeing missiles zoom along
at'extreme altitudes at three
times the speed of sound. They
use a unique radar homing device
to roar in on target with deadly
accuracy.
For test purposes the two Bo
marcs veci'ed away from the in
tended targets at the last split
second. The drone bombers were
flying at different ranges and al
titudes.
Aii - Force crewmen serviced the
missiles at the Cape, but their
launchings were accomplished by
one of the world's largest com
puters, at Kingston, N.Y.
