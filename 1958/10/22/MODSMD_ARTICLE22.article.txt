COLORAMA — You've got to
hand it to the Stanford band when
it comes to putting on a fair—and
I mean good — halftime show.
When they take on a project they
take it on whole hog. Last Satur
day's High School Band Day fes
tivities were colorful, pleasing to
the ear, certaintly an eyeful, and
at points just as funny as a three
ring circus squared.
Admittedly, all parties agree,
it was a mistake to put all the
flag wavers, baton twirlers, and
girlie-kickers together in the mid
dle of the field like that, but I
don't know when I've laughed as
much.
'All these groups come prepared
to steal the show for themselves
and it sort of breaks their heart
when they can't do it. But when
they end up foiling one another
then, brother, you've lit the fuse.
And when Tracy's girlie-kickers
kick a hole in Live Oak's flags,
setting off a chain reaction which
knocks batons out of Gonzales'
Union's hands —then, again, bro
ther, listen to it fizzle. If only
dirty looks could be stored up—
boy I'd have a potful.
QUOTEABLE—and still on the
subject. Listening to some of us
kid about the multitude of high
school musicians assembled for
last Saturday's game. A bright
witted little lady comes out with:
"48.000 high school musicians as
sembled here today. The Stadium
will now leave as they take their
places on the field." Ilikeit!
JOIvEABLE —There's always a
clown in a group. In the midst of
a discussion on the Little Rock
crisis the other day a participator
asks: "Are they going to school
down there now?" He's answered:
"No, only by TV." To which the
joker responds: "Colored TV?"
I SAW IT REALLY — Now I
can see one antenna on a car,
maybe even two on some of the
newer ones—for looks, you know
but I'm darned if five have to do
the trick, but I saw it—both eyes
full, really. One each on front
fender, one each on back fender,
and just as natural as can be for
balance and aesthetic grace, you
know right in the middle of the
top. How's the reception?
DlLEMMA—Wondered and
wondered how the Rickey's
people would solve the "no-host
cocktail party" problem at the
Air Force game. You know the
line: "Alumni and friends of —
are invited to a no-host cocktail
party immediately following to
day's game at Rickey's Studio
Inn just three miles south of the
Stadium on El Camino Real."—
You've heard it ahundredtimes!
So thev're not so dumb: "Person

nel and friends of the Air Force"
the rest you know!
OOPS! — I wonder if whoever
ordered them made, realizes that
all the signs that point the way
to Stanford Stadium on Satur
day afternoons are and you'll
pardon me, of course— 1 should
even think of mentioning—blue
and gold.
THOSE TEXAN JOKES—
Alaska hasn't put an end to all
Texan jokes, even though it
makes them (Texans, that is!)
squirm a little. This item not a
'bad one: Texan all outfitted for
a day of golf; arrives at course to
be told, "I'm sorry, sir, but you
won't be able to play golf today—

we haven't any Caddies." "Oh
that's alright, "he answers, "I
don't mind taking tlie Buick to
day." Ohhhhhhhh, pain!
STOP ANI) THlNK—Staffer
here on the Daily carries a note
book around with him for express
purpose of jotting down interest
ing quotes he hears from day to
day. Filching one and the best
of 'em 'cause it sort of has a hid
den meaning when you think
about it. From a new froshwo
men: "For the first time my steps
and the cracks in the sidewalk
were the same length today—l
felt like I belonged here." And
you know, she does!
