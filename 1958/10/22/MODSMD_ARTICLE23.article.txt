# UN 						Interpreters' Knowledge Wide
## 
### Associated Press 
The United Nations delegate,
proud of his florid oratory, de
livered a long speech with each
word rich and consciously beauti
ful.
When ho concluded, a UN in
terpreter read (he French trans
lation — clear, lucid, but neatly
pruned of excessive verbiage.
The delegate rushed up. "That's
not what I said," he protested
furiously.
"Monsieur," replied the interp
reter smoothly, "that is what you
ought to have said."
This is the favorite story of the
United Nations' Interpretive Sec
tion, but in practice the 70-odd
translators have little time or in
clination to edit speeches. Mostly
they just try to keep up with
them.
Seems Simple
It might seem simple to merely
translate sentences word for
word as a speaker mouths them.
Actually, much more is re
quired of a UN interpreter. Many
know almost as much about the
subject under discussion as the
speaker. About a third of the in
terpretive staff numbering 70 are
Ph. D's. Most own degrees in law,
economics, political science, math
ematics comparative literature,
or some other learned specialty.
"The minimum requirement
for an interpreter is fluency in
three languages and most of our
staff can handle more than that,"
says George L. Sherry, acting
chief of the section.
It takes more than a flair for
languages 1o make a good UN
interpreter. Sherry says. At the

world organization, two types of
interpretation are used. One is
simultaneous, when the interp
reter translates as the speech
goes along. The other is consecu
tive, when he does his interpre
tation at'ler the speech is finished.
"You can compare either one to
broadcasting a basketball game,"
says Sherry. "You must have the
ability to analyze things on the
fly."
"Bloody Boys"
Once Sherry was making a
simultaneous translation of a
speech by the late Andrei Vishin
sky, with the Soviet delegate
charging the Western powers
I with causing bloodshed. He used
' the phrase, "bloody boys before
;my eyes" a reference Sherry in
| stantiy recognized as a quotation
from Boris Godunov, the Russian
classic.
A literal translation would
have meant nothing to listeners,
so Sherry nimbly substituted an
appropriate quotation from Mac
beth, about "bloody instructions
which, being taught, return to
plague the inventor." All this
while he was translating at a clip
of 200 words a minute.
Slips by interpreters occasional
ly provide some merriment, as
when an English interpreter dur
ing a Security Council session
quoted Andrei Gromyko as call
ing for a "reduction of argu
ments" instead of armaments.
The Russian joined the laughter
and said 1 hat perhaps the interp
reter had the better idea.

Seems Simple
It might seem simple to merely
translate sentences word for
word as a speaker mouths them.
Actually, much more is re
quired of a UN interpreter. Many
know almost as much about the
subject under discussion as the
speaker. About a third of the in
terpretive staff numbering 70 are
Ph. D's. Most own degrees in law,
economics, political science, math
ematics comparative literature,
or some other learned specialty.
"The minimum requirement
for an interpreter is fluency in
three languages and most of our
staff can handle more than that,"
says George L. Sherry, acting
chief of the section.
It takes more than a flair for
languages 1o make a good UN
interpreter. Sherry says. At the

world organization, two types of
interpretation are used. One is
simultaneous, when the interp
reter translates as the speech
goes along. The other is consecu
tive, when he does his interpre
tation at'ler the speech is finished.
"You can compare either one to
broadcasting a basketball game,"
says Sherry. "You must have the
ability to analyze things on the
fly."
"Bloody Boys"
Once Sherry was making a
simultaneous translation of a
speech by the late Andrei Vishin
sky, with the Soviet delegate
charging the Western powers
I with causing bloodshed. He used
' the phrase, "bloody boys before
;my eyes" a reference Sherry in
| stantiy recognized as a quotation
from Boris Godunov, the Russian
classic.
A literal translation would
have meant nothing to listeners,
so Sherry nimbly substituted an
appropriate quotation from Mac
beth, about "bloody instructions
which, being taught, return to
plague the inventor." All this
while he was translating at a clip
of 200 words a minute.
Slips by interpreters occasional
ly provide some merriment, as
when an English interpreter dur
ing a Security Council session
quoted Andrei Gromyko as call
ing for a "reduction of argu
ments" instead of armaments.
The Russian joined the laughter
and said 1 hat perhaps the interp
reter had the better idea.
The United Nations delegate,
proud of his florid oratory, de
livered a long speech with each
word rich and consciously beauti
ful.
When ho concluded, a UN in
terpreter read (he French trans
lation — clear, lucid, but neatly
pruned of excessive verbiage.
The delegate rushed up. "That's
not what I said," he protested
furiously.
"Monsieur," replied the interp
reter smoothly, "that is what you
ought to have said."
This is the favorite story of the
United Nations' Interpretive Sec
tion, but in practice the 70-odd
translators have little time or in
clination to edit speeches. Mostly
they just try to keep up with
them.
