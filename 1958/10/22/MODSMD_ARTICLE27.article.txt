THE TRUE AND HARROWING FACTS
ABOUT RUSHING
It is well enough to sit in one's Morris chair and theorize about,
sorority rushing, but if one really wishes to know the facts, one
must leave one's Morris chair and go out into the field. My
Morris chair, incidentally, was given tome by the makers of Philip
Morris. They also gave me my Philip chair. They are great
hearted folk, the makers of Philip Morris, as millions of you
know whu -liave enjoyed their excellent cigarettes. Only from
bountiful souls could come such mildness, such flavor, such
pleasure, as you will find in Philip Morris! For those who prefer
crush proof boxes, Philip Morris is available in crush proof boxes.
For those who prefer soft packs, Philip Morris is available in
soft packs. For those who prefer to buy their cigarettes in bulk,
please contact Emmett R. Sigafoos, friendly manager of our
factory in Richmond, Virginia.
But I digress. I was saying that in order to know the true
facts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and in
vestigate. Consequently, 1 went last week to the Indiana
College of Spot Welding and Belles-Lettres and interviewed
several million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund
McKeever. (ft is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story
about how she came to be named Gerund.) It seems that her
father, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than any
thing in the world, and so he named all liis children after parts
of speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named
Preposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative
Case. The airls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their
names, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and
was finally found one night dangling from a participle. Alter
this tragic event, the father abandoned ltis practice of gram
matical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently
born to him—eight in all—were named Everett.
But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named
Gerund McKeever. "Gerund," I said, "were you rushed by a
sorority?"
"Yes, mister," she said, "I was rushed by a sorority."
"Did they give you a high-pressure pitch?" I asked. "Did
they use the hard sell?"'
"Xo, mister," she replied. "It was all done with quiet
dignity. They simply talked to me about the chapter and the
girls for about three minutes and then I pledged."
"My goodness'." I said. "Three minutes is not very long for
a sales talk!"
"It is when they are holding you under water, mister," said
Gerund.

"Well, Gerund," I said, "how do you like the house?"
"I like the house fine, mister," she replied. "But I don t live
there. Unfortunately, they pledged more girls than they have
room for, so they are sleeping some of us in the hell tower.
"Isn't that rather noisy?" 1 said.
"Only on the quarter-hour," said Gerund.
"Well, Gerund," I said, "it has certainly been a pleasure
talking to you," 1 said.
"Likewise, mister," she said, and with many a laugh and
cheer we went our separate ways she to the campanile, 1 to

hearted folk, the makers of Philip Morris, as millions of you
know whu -liave enjoyed their excellent cigarettes. Only from
bountiful souls could come such mildness, such flavor, such
pleasure, as you will find in Philip Morris! For those who prefer
crush proof boxes, Philip Morris is available in crush proof boxes.
For those who prefer soft packs, Philip Morris is available in

But I digress. I was saying that in order to know the true
facts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and in
vestigate. Consequently, 1 went last week to the Indiana
College of Spot Welding and Belles-Lettres and interviewed
several million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund
McKeever. (ft is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story
about how she came to be named Gerund.) It seems that her
father, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than any
thing in the world, and so he named all liis children after parts
of speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named
Preposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative
Case. The airls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their
names, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and
was finally found one night dangling from a participle. Alter
this tragic event, the father abandoned ltis practice of gram
matical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently
born to him—eight in all—were named Everett.
But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named
Gerund McKeever. "Gerund," I said, "were you rushed by a
sorority?"
"Yes, mister," she said, "I was rushed by a sorority."
"Did they give you a high-pressure pitch?" I asked. "Did
they use the hard sell?"'
"Xo, mister," she replied. "It was all done with quiet
dignity. They simply talked to me about the chapter and the
girls for about three minutes and then I pledged."
"My goodness'." I said. "Three minutes is not very long for
a sales talk!"
"It is when they are holding you under water, mister," said
Gerund.

"Well, Gerund," I said, "how do you like the house?"
"I like the house fine, mister," she replied. "But I don t live
there. Unfortunately, they pledged more girls than they have
room for, so they are sleeping some of us in the hell tower.
"Isn't that rather noisy?" 1 said.
"Only on the quarter-hour," said Gerund.
"Well, Gerund," I said, "it has certainly been a pleasure
talking to you," 1 said.
"Likewise, mister," she said, and with many a laugh and
cheer we went our separate ways she to the campanile, 1 to
the Morris chair. © io/w m»x shuiman

THE TRUE AND HARROWING FACTS
ABOUT RUSHING
It is well enough to sit in one's Morris chair and theorize about,
sorority rushing, but if one really wishes to know the facts, one
must leave one's Morris chair and go out into the field. My

Morris. They also gave me my Philip chair. They are great
