# Law and Order Stanford Style
## 
### Ceci Wittman 
Some people think that Captain
Midnight is a comic strip charac
ter. But Stanford students know
differently. Captain Midnight to
them is a traffic policeman who
is a well dressed Brando who goes
jazzin' around campus on a three
ton Harley.
Midnight, known to Chief Gor
don Davis as Carl Gielitz, has
been giving out tickets for legal
and illegal parking around Stan
ford for many full moons.
Surprisingly, he regards his
name, which he acquired in some
obscure way in '52, as a "term of
affection." (It also gives him a
certain degree of recognition.) "I
don't mind what they call me as
long as it's printable," he says.
He is well known for being the
most - dressed policeman on the
Peninsula: lid, shades (even at
night), immaculate blue shirt
jodhpurs with creases that look
wired in, patent leather boots and
assorted incidental items that no
cop trying out for the Best-
Dressed awards should be with
out: whistle, two blackjacks, po
lice special, chrome badge.
Neat and Respectable
"Part of my job is to look re
spectable and maintain a neat ap
pearance," Midnight said.
He also has the largest gun col
lection on the Peninsula—9o, to
be exact. He gives talks on gun
lore, and is planning to start a
gun collectors' club.
This pseudo-ladies' man is 39,
has just bought a house, and has
no steady girl friend. In his
words, "I'm available (chuckle)."
In addition to being a plain or
dinary traffic cop, he often takes
it upon himself to single-handedly
quiet down riots, fights and gen
eral out-of-the-ordinary uproar.
An example: the Phi Kaps' fa
mous Aqua Wazoo, which got
most disastrously demolished last
year. Arriving on the scene,
Sherlock Gielitz made a brilliant
deduction upon seeing debris
scattered for a radius of 100
yards: "I think someone put a
bomb in that boat."
KA Secession
Also last spring: Kappa Alpha
was holding a quiet, orderly se
cession from the Union on the
Row. Grant was being hung in
effigy, the Southern flag was fly
ing. the street was barricaded and
was marching for Vicksburg. A
Upper Row (the Union army)
crucial water fight followed.
In action: Joe Friday Midnight
came spinning onto lawn on cy
cle, hitting people with rubber
slapper. After running people
into hedges, etc., etc.. Midnight
finally called for reinforcements
from the department. "They
were creating a traffic jam," he
said. I just quieted them down a
bit."
Carl the Campus Cop
It is rumored that Carl the
Campus Cop, as Carl Gielitz Mid
night is also known, entered the
force on Aug. 23. 1949. However,
when questioned on this matter,
he would swear on his Police
man's Manual that he entered in
June.
Another evidence of his short
memory is the '55 fire at Encina,
which was started when a frosh
tried to soften a can of shoe pol
ish over a flame. It seems that
Midnight was in the courtyard di
recting traffic and making a gen
eral nuisance of himself when he
got hit with a bucketful of water.
Understandably irked, he
bombed over to his motor, got his
übiquitous ticket book and scram
bled madly up to the fifth floor—
only to be locked out.
Unprofitable?
His deeds have not always been
unproftable to Stanford students.
When George Ralph ran for stu
dent body president in '55, his
campaign stunt was a motorcycle
caravan around the Quad. (In
case you haven't noticed, traffic
is not allowed.) Midnight, buck
ing for a promotion, saw his
chance to give out a complete
book of tickets and then some.
Whether Carl was promoted for
this is uncertain, but Ralph got
elected.
In spite of being bull's ej'e for
numerous water balloons play
fully thrown by fraternity boys,
and having his toes run over
while directing traffic out by the
post office, he says that after ten
hell-raising years here, he plans
to stay another 20 mora. "I get a
big kick out of their pranks," he
said as he polished his deputy
marshal's badge.

obscure way in '52, as a "term of
affection." (It also gives him a
certain degree of recognition.) "I
don't mind what they call me as
long as it's printable," he says.
He is well known for being the
most - dressed policeman on the
Peninsula: lid, shades (even at
night), immaculate blue shirt
jodhpurs with creases that look
wired in, patent leather boots and
assorted incidental items that no
cop trying out for the Best-
Dressed awards should be with
out: whistle, two blackjacks, po
lice special, chrome badge.
Neat and Respectable
"Part of my job is to look re
spectable and maintain a neat ap
pearance," Midnight said.
He also has the largest gun col
lection on the Peninsula—9o, to
be exact. He gives talks on gun
lore, and is planning to start a
gun collectors' club.
This pseudo-ladies' man is 39,
has just bought a house, and has
no steady girl friend. In his
words, "I'm available (chuckle)."
In addition to being a plain or
dinary traffic cop, he often takes
it upon himself to single-handedly
quiet down riots, fights and gen
eral out-of-the-ordinary uproar.
An example: the Phi Kaps' fa
mous Aqua Wazoo, which got
most disastrously demolished last
year. Arriving on the scene,
Sherlock Gielitz made a brilliant
deduction upon seeing debris
scattered for a radius of 100
yards: "I think someone put a
bomb in that boat."
KA Secession
Also last spring: Kappa Alpha
was holding a quiet, orderly se
cession from the Union on the
Row. Grant was being hung in
effigy, the Southern flag was fly
ing. the street was barricaded and
was marching for Vicksburg. A
Upper Row (the Union army)
crucial water fight followed.
In action: Joe Friday Midnight
came spinning onto lawn on cy
cle, hitting people with rubber
slapper. After running people
into hedges, etc., etc.. Midnight
finally called for reinforcements
from the department. "They
were creating a traffic jam," he
said. I just quieted them down a
bit."
Carl the Campus Cop
It is rumored that Carl the
Campus Cop, as Carl Gielitz Mid
night is also known, entered the
force on Aug. 23. 1949. However,
when questioned on this matter,
he would swear on his Police
man's Manual that he entered in
June.
Another evidence of his short
memory is the '55 fire at Encina,
which was started when a frosh
tried to soften a can of shoe pol
ish over a flame. It seems that
Midnight was in the courtyard di
recting traffic and making a gen
eral nuisance of himself when he
got hit with a bucketful of water.
Understandably irked, he
bombed over to his motor, got his
übiquitous ticket book and scram
bled madly up to the fifth floor—
only to be locked out.
Unprofitable?
His deeds have not always been
unproftable to Stanford students.
When George Ralph ran for stu
dent body president in '55, his
campaign stunt was a motorcycle
caravan around the Quad. (In
case you haven't noticed, traffic
is not allowed.) Midnight, buck
ing for a promotion, saw his
chance to give out a complete
book of tickets and then some.
Whether Carl was promoted for
this is uncertain, but Ralph got
elected.
In spite of being bull's ej'e for
numerous water balloons play
fully thrown by fraternity boys,
and having his toes run over
while directing traffic out by the
post office, he says that after ten
hell-raising years here, he plans
to stay another 20 mora. "I get a
big kick out of their pranks," he
said as he polished his deputy
marshal's badge.

Greetings, Captain!
Some people think that Captain
Midnight is a comic strip charac

differently. Captain Midnight to
them is a traffic policeman who
is a well dressed Brando who goes
jazzin' around campus on a three

Midnight, known to Chief Gor

ford for many full moons.

out: whistle, two blackjacks, po
lice special, chrome badge.
Neat and Respectable
"Part of my job is to look re
spectable and maintain a neat ap
pearance," Midnight said.
He also has the largest gun col
lection on the Peninsula—9o, to
be exact. He gives talks on gun
lore, and is planning to start a
gun collectors' club.
This pseudo-ladies' man is 39,
has just bought a house, and has
no steady girl friend. In his
words, "I'm available (chuckle)."
In addition to being a plain or
dinary traffic cop, he often takes
it upon himself to single-handedly
quiet down riots, fights and gen
eral out-of-the-ordinary uproar.
An example: the Phi Kaps' fa
mous Aqua Wazoo, which got
most disastrously demolished last
year. Arriving on the scene,
Sherlock Gielitz made a brilliant
deduction upon seeing debris
scattered for a radius of 100
yards: "I think someone put a
bomb in that boat."
KA Secession
Also last spring: Kappa Alpha
was holding a quiet, orderly se
cession from the Union on the
Row. Grant was being hung in
effigy, the Southern flag was fly
ing. the street was barricaded and
was marching for Vicksburg. A
Upper Row (the Union army)
crucial water fight followed.
In action: Joe Friday Midnight
came spinning onto lawn on cy
cle, hitting people with rubber
slapper. After running people
into hedges, etc., etc.. Midnight
finally called for reinforcements
from the department. "They
were creating a traffic jam," he
said. I just quieted them down a
bit."
Carl the Campus Cop
It is rumored that Carl the
Campus Cop, as Carl Gielitz Mid
night is also known, entered the
force on Aug. 23. 1949. However,
when questioned on this matter,
he would swear on his Police
man's Manual that he entered in
June.
Another evidence of his short
memory is the '55 fire at Encina,
which was started when a frosh
tried to soften a can of shoe pol
ish over a flame. It seems that
Midnight was in the courtyard di
recting traffic and making a gen
eral nuisance of himself when he
got hit with a bucketful of water.
Understandably irked, he
bombed over to his motor, got his
übiquitous ticket book and scram
bled madly up to the fifth floor—
only to be locked out.
Unprofitable?
His deeds have not always been
unproftable to Stanford students.
When George Ralph ran for stu
dent body president in '55, his
campaign stunt was a motorcycle
caravan around the Quad. (In
case you haven't noticed, traffic
is not allowed.) Midnight, buck
ing for a promotion, saw his
chance to give out a complete
book of tickets and then some.
Whether Carl was promoted for
this is uncertain, but Ralph got
elected.
In spite of being bull's ej'e for
numerous water balloons play
fully thrown by fraternity boys,
and having his toes run over
while directing traffic out by the
post office, he says that after ten
hell-raising years here, he plans
to stay another 20 mora. "I get a
big kick out of their pranks," he
said as he polished his deputy
marshal's badge.

Greetings, Captain!
Some people think that Captain
Midnight is a comic strip charac
ter. But Stanford students know
differently. Captain Midnight to
them is a traffic policeman who
is a well dressed Brando who goes
jazzin' around campus on a three
ton Harley.
Midnight, known to Chief Gor
don Davis as Carl Gielitz, has
been giving out tickets for legal
and illegal parking around Stan
ford for many full moons.
Surprisingly, he regards his
name, which he acquired in some
obscure way in '52, as a "term of
affection." (It also gives him a
certain degree of recognition.) "I
don't mind what they call me as
long as it's printable," he says.
He is well known for being the
most - dressed policeman on the
Peninsula: lid, shades (even at
night), immaculate blue shirt
jodhpurs with creases that look
wired in, patent leather boots and
assorted incidental items that no
cop trying out for the Best-
Dressed awards should be with
out: whistle, two blackjacks, po
lice special, chrome badge.
