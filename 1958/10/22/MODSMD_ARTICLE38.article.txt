## 
### 
California's Joe Kapp. top rush
er in the Pacific Coast Confer
; ence, pulled into the lead this
| week in the conference's total-of-
I fense department.
Kapp, who has carried the ball
for 279 yards and has passed for
a total of 293 yards, leads his
nearest competitor, Washington
State's Bob Newman, by 100 yards
—572 to 472.
Close behind the two leaders is
UCLA's Don Long with 459 yards.
However, Long, who is a five
game senior, played his last game
last Saturday and will not have
an opportunity to catch the
leaders.
Nicolet Leads Stanford
The No. 1 man in total offense
for Stanford is quarterback Bob
Nicolet, who has amassed a total
of 291 yards, ranking him sixth in
the league.
Right behind Kapp in total rush
ing is USC's Rex Johnston, with
248 yards. The fiflh player in
total rushing is Stanford's Rick
McMillen, with 230 yards. McMil
len's 6.2 average per carry is bet
ter than the two leaders.
In passing, Newman — despite
an injury which prevented his
playing more than a few minutes
last week, still leads the league.
He has completed 49 passes in 75
attempts for a .653 percentage and
511 yards. A little over 100 yards j
and 13 completions behind New

man is Long with 393 yards, hav
ing completed 36 of 64 attempts.
The league's third and fourth
passers are Stanford's Dick Nor
man and Nicolet. Norman ha-.s 35
completions in (>8 attempts for
252 yards and a .570 average. Ni
colet has hit on 31 of 63 attempts
for a .402 average and 299 yards.
Top Receivers
Dick Wallen of UCLA is setting
the pace in the pass-receiving de
partment. The great Uclan end
has hauled in 19 passes for 211
yards and three touchdowns.
Wallen, like teammate Long,
has played in his last game thi-s
year, leaving the runner-up, Stan
ford's Chris Bui ford, an excellent
opportunity to take the lead. Bur
ford has caught 17 passes for 155
yards. Two spots beknV Burford,
in the fourth spot, is Stanford's
Irv Nikolai, who has 14 receptions
for 121 yards.
Cal's Bill Pat ton is setting a fan
tastic pace in the league's scoring
department. He has already scor
ed 50 points on eight touchdowns
and one 2-point conversion.
If Patton were to keep up this
phenomenal pace, he would prob
ably break 100 points and be only
the third player- in PCC history to
do so. The previous two who have
made 100 or more points are Jon
Arnett and Hugh McElhenny.

Dainard Paulson leads the con
ference in punting with a 42.8 av
erage, but is closely pursued by
Stanford's McMillen, who has
kicked for a 38.4 average.
Phil Parslow of UCLA has done
a superb job in the interception
department. Parslow has nabbed
three enemy pitches and has re
turned them for a total of 117
yards and one touchdown. Six
other players have caught two
opponents' passes.

do so. The previous two who have
made 100 or more points are Jon
