## 
### 
Fall practice for the Stanford
University baseball team has
moved into full swing as the
squad prepares for next season's
rigorous 35-game schedule in the
California Intercollegiate Base
ball Association, a league which
has produced two national cham
pions in the last two years.
The G5 men vying for positions
on the varsity and freshman
squads are being drilled in base
ball fundamentals by coaches
Mickey Holzman and Bill Alhouse
and assistants Ralph Holding,
who represented Stanford at
catcher on last year's All-America
team, and Mike Aker, former
Stanford ballplayer now in the
professional ranks.
The varsity, which finished
third last season in the CIBA
while winning 23 games and drop
ping 12. will have returning vet
erans in pitcher Bob Leopold,
catcher Art Von Wronski, infield
ers Jim Burk and Joel Newkirk,
and outfielders Rich De Fabio
and Harry Rodda.
Strong challengers for posi
tions on the team are catcher Jay
Winter, up from the junior var
sity; catcher Mike Magee, a prod
uct of the freshman team of '56,
and infielder Ed Parks, a junior
college transfer.
The freshmen, who last season
won 12 games while dropping
three, have outstanding prospects
in Skip Lawrence, an All-Confer
ence second baseman fromJordan
High of Long Beach, and Bob Ov
erman, highly - regarded catcher
from Los Altos High.
The varsity season will begin in
the third week of February with
the annual alumni game. The sea
son will be highlighted by the tra
ditional rivalries with USC, UC
LA and California, and by a tour
nament planned by the Camp
Pendleton Marine Base, which
would bring together many of
California's top collegiate teams.
