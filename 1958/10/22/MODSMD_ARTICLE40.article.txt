### JON FROST 
As the fall intramural sports at
Stanford roll into full swing, it
appears that touch football will be
the most popular of the nine
sports offered this quarter.
The 13 leagues, about 80 teams,
are organized by natural division
into those sponsored by fraterni
ties, Wilbur, Stern, eating clubs,
grad schools, etc., each group be
ing allowed two playing teams,
designated as A and B.
Dual, Individual Sports
Four bowling leagues, meeting
Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Thursdays, have eight teams
each signed up for the quarter,
but some have not paid their de
posits to the intramural depart
ment. Also, on the two Stanford
alleys Wilbur has eight active
teams in its league.
Two-man volleyball teams have
begun elimination tournaments
for a total of 62 teams, and the
last of the first round of hand
ball will be deadlined at 5 p.m. to
night to Bugge.
