Handbook for All-Americans
Tf there were such a thing as a Dandy Handy Handbook for Pa
cific Coast Football Players, the following essentials would surely he
included:
The Four Points of making an All-American team . . .
(1) Hire a personal agent.
(2) Get on a winning team (making sure, of course, that there is
a minimum of other great All-American prospects of your stature.)
(31 Play your best football in the first six games.
(4) Very important play a hang up game somewhere in the East
or Midwest.
That seems simple enough. And the time for those wonderful all
star aggregations to be selected is rapidly drawing near.
Looking back at recent A-A elevens (one magazine graciously
selects an A-A twenty-two, which isn't any simpler than eleven . . .
only you get to look a! more pictures) we West Coasters must sadly
admit that the above-mentioned four points are becoming pretty
much essential to attain national

acclaim.
Point No. 1 has been particu
larly brutal on Stanford tackles
in recent years and the current
Card line standout, Troy Barbee,
is taking it on the chin this year.
It seems that somebody is work
ing overtime in Corvallis.
Last season, Barbee, as a jun
ior, was a unanimous All-Coast
selection, and his junior running
mate, Bill Leeka of UCLA, was
on almost all of the selections,
too. This most certainly meant
PCC tackles will be classy 1 his
year.
Rut . . . when 1958 rolled around
and the newsstands were flooded
with the annual deluge of foot
ball magazines and the prominent
weeklies slipped in their gridiron
previews, where was Troy Bar
bee? For that matter, where was
Bill Leeka? Troy and Bill were
there, all right, but we find that
from out of nowhere Ted Bales
of Oregon State is now rated

the finest tackle on the' Coast and by some the finest in the nation.
Doubtless there are many Beaverites about the land who held
these beliefs about Ted Bates last season. And Ted Bates? proved one
whale of a football player last season. But seeing that he was almost
universally rated behind Barbee and I.eeka last season, why did it
become an almost universal opinion this year that Bates would sud
denly rise from the PCC's third best to the nation's very best?
Some Make It, Some Don't
Two years ago, OSC gave John Witte the big push at tackle, and
managed to swing most of the A-A pickers to his side. This despite
the prevailing Pacific Coast belief that Stanford had a much better
tackle in Paul Wiggin.
In fact, one Northwest sportswriter, after watching Idaho spend
an afternoon pushing Witte all over the field, devoted a full column
to the subject of this gross example of overrating and entitled it
aptly: "Some Make It, Some Don't." The"it" is All American rank
ing.
Witte had point No. 2 working in his favor, too. He was on a
winning team. Because OSC had rather come from nowhere to take
the PCC title, A-A pickers frantically needed a Beaver for their
squads and Witte was the handiest . . . since he had been shoved
into their faces at the season's start, anyway.
Paid Wiggin was hampered somewhat by the fact that there was
another real All-American on his team: John Brodie. Here we arrive
at the big sin of the A-A picker: giving too much attention to one
team, especially a non-title team. It is conceivable that had Stanford
won the PCC, Wiggin would have replaced Witte on most of the A-A
selections and, yes, two Cards would have been first-team choices.
Then, too, since most of the teams had pretty well taken shape
by the time the season was barely half over, selectors missed out on
seeing late-season slumps by numerous of their choices. Witte was
manhandled by Idaho in his next-to-last game.
Finally, why should I bring this up now, two years later? Is it
kicking a dead horse? Maybe, but then I take a look at Witte's 1 and
Wiggin's fortunes in pro football and the sore opens again. Wiggin,
an early draft choice by the then-champion Cleveland Browns during
his junior year, is now a defensive stalwart for the powerful Brown
ies. To gain his starting position, he unseated an all-time defensive
star, Lennie Ford. Witte? Well, the San Francisco 49ers are one
of three teams (the other two Canadian) who have cut him during
an uneventful career.
Play Where ilie Pickers Are
But more and more these days the key factor to a West Coast ball
player's A-A aspirations is a great game in the Fast, before ihe eyes
of 90 per cent of the pickers, who refuse to believe anybody out of
their area can be a halfway decent football player.
There is no doubt that this was the biggest factor in John Brodle's
miraele-of-miracles of 1956: nosing out already All-American Paul
Hornung of Notre Dame for consensus A-A honors. Early in the
season, John turned in a fabulous passing show before the many
thousands at Ohio State, and it's one they're still talking about in
Columbus. That show put him in the pickers' eyes.
Last season. Jack Curtice's passing whiz at Utah, Fee Grosscup,
won his national mention in exactly the same way. Grosscnp was
under the almost impossible handicap (when it comes to A-A honors)
of playing for a Skyline Conference school. For a Skyliner to make
even one A-A team, let alone all those that flrosscnp made, has be
come a truly miraculous achievement . . . because Skyline teams
seldom leave their area.
Lee had the remedy for the situation. Utah played one game in
the Fast last year . . . with Army. That afternoon Grosscnp had one
of the greatest days a passing quarterback could possibly dream of,
with his team losing to the heavily favored Cadets by 39-33 in the
season's wildest game. By chance, the Eastern writers had seen a
performance far better than any their local quarterbacks were turn
ing in.
Grosscnp was splashed onto All-American teams right and left
. . . because of just one game. With due respect to the great Ule
tosser, it must be said that the lucky quarterback might have been
Bob Newman of Washington State or even -lack Douglas of Stanford,
had they happened to play their greatest game of the season in the
Fast, or Midwest.
But despite all this, All-American teams are lots of fun and they'll
be around as long as college football hangs on. So let's just forget
these crazy circumstances and sit back and enjoy the pictures and
rest on the satisfaction that we know our guys are best anyway.

even one A-A team, let alone all those that flrosscnp made, has be
come a truly miraculous achievement . . . because Skyline teams
seldom leave their area.
Lee had the remedy for the situation. Utah played one game in
the Fast last year . . . with Army. That afternoon Grosscnp had one
of the greatest days a passing quarterback could possibly dream of,
with his team losing to the heavily favored Cadets by 39-33 in the
season's wildest game. By chance, the Eastern writers had seen a
performance far better than any their local quarterbacks were turn
ing in.
Grosscnp was splashed onto All-American teams right and left
. . . because of just one game. With due respect to the great Ule
tosser, it must be said that the lucky quarterback might have been
Bob Newman of Washington State or even -lack Douglas of Stanford,
had they happened to play their greatest game of the season in the
Fast, or Midwest.
But despite all this, All-American teams are lots of fun and they'll
be around as long as college football hangs on. So let's just forget
these crazy circumstances and sit back and enjoy the pictures and
rest on the satisfaction that we know our guys are best anyway.



TROY BARBER
Corvallis' Latest Victim
Handbook for All-Americans
Tf there were such a thing as a Dandy Handy Handbook for Pa
cific Coast Football Players, the following essentials would surely he
included:
The Four Points of making an All-American team . . .
(1) Hire a personal agent.
(2) Get on a winning team (making sure, of course, that there is
a minimum of other great All-American prospects of your stature.)
(31 Play your best football in the first six games.
(4) Very important play a hang up game somewhere in the East
or Midwest.
That seems simple enough. And the time for those wonderful all
star aggregations to be selected is rapidly drawing near.
Looking back at recent A-A elevens (one magazine graciously
selects an A-A twenty-two, which isn't any simpler than eleven . . .
only you get to look a! more pictures) we West Coasters must sadly
admit that the above-mentioned four points are becoming pretty
much essential to attain national

acclaim.
Point No. 1 has been particu
larly brutal on Stanford tackles
in recent years and the current
Card line standout, Troy Barbee,
is taking it on the chin this year.
It seems that somebody is work
ing overtime in Corvallis.
Last season, Barbee, as a jun
ior, was a unanimous All-Coast
selection, and his junior running
mate, Bill Leeka of UCLA, was
on almost all of the selections,
too. This most certainly meant
PCC tackles will be classy 1 his
year.
Rut . . . when 1958 rolled around
and the newsstands were flooded
with the annual deluge of foot
ball magazines and the prominent
weeklies slipped in their gridiron
previews, where was Troy Bar
bee? For that matter, where was
Bill Leeka? Troy and Bill were
there, all right, but we find that
from out of nowhere Ted Bales
of Oregon State is now rated

the finest tackle on the' Coast and by some the finest in the nation.
Doubtless there are many Beaverites about the land who held
these beliefs about Ted Bates last season. And Ted Bates? proved one
whale of a football player last season. But seeing that he was almost
universally rated behind Barbee and I.eeka last season, why did it
become an almost universal opinion this year that Bates would sud
denly rise from the PCC's third best to the nation's very best?
Some Make It, Some Don't
Two years ago, OSC gave John Witte the big push at tackle, and
managed to swing most of the A-A pickers to his side. This despite
the prevailing Pacific Coast belief that Stanford had a much better
tackle in Paul Wiggin.
In fact, one Northwest sportswriter, after watching Idaho spend
an afternoon pushing Witte all over the field, devoted a full column
to the subject of this gross example of overrating and entitled it
aptly: "Some Make It, Some Don't." The"it" is All American rank
ing.
Witte had point No. 2 working in his favor, too. He was on a
winning team. Because OSC had rather come from nowhere to take
the PCC title, A-A pickers frantically needed a Beaver for their
squads and Witte was the handiest . . . since he had been shoved
into their faces at the season's start, anyway.
Paid Wiggin was hampered somewhat by the fact that there was
another real All-American on his team: John Brodie. Here we arrive
at the big sin of the A-A picker: giving too much attention to one
team, especially a non-title team. It is conceivable that had Stanford
won the PCC, Wiggin would have replaced Witte on most of the A-A
selections and, yes, two Cards would have been first-team choices.
Then, too, since most of the teams had pretty well taken shape
by the time the season was barely half over, selectors missed out on
seeing late-season slumps by numerous of their choices. Witte was
manhandled by Idaho in his next-to-last game.
Finally, why should I bring this up now, two years later? Is it
kicking a dead horse? Maybe, but then I take a look at Witte's 1 and
Wiggin's fortunes in pro football and the sore opens again. Wiggin,
an early draft choice by the then-champion Cleveland Browns during
his junior year, is now a defensive stalwart for the powerful Brown
ies. To gain his starting position, he unseated an all-time defensive
star, Lennie Ford. Witte? Well, the San Francisco 49ers are one
of three teams (the other two Canadian) who have cut him during
an uneventful career.
Play Where ilie Pickers Are
But more and more these days the key factor to a West Coast ball
player's A-A aspirations is a great game in the Fast, before ihe eyes
of 90 per cent of the pickers, who refuse to believe anybody out of
their area can be a halfway decent football player.
There is no doubt that this was the biggest factor in John Brodle's
miraele-of-miracles of 1956: nosing out already All-American Paul
Hornung of Notre Dame for consensus A-A honors. Early in the
season, John turned in a fabulous passing show before the many
thousands at Ohio State, and it's one they're still talking about in
Columbus. That show put him in the pickers' eyes.
Last season. Jack Curtice's passing whiz at Utah, Fee Grosscup,
won his national mention in exactly the same way. Grosscnp was
under the almost impossible handicap (when it comes to A-A honors)
of playing for a Skyline Conference school. For a Skyliner to make
even one A-A team, let alone all those that flrosscnp made, has be
come a truly miraculous achievement . . . because Skyline teams

his junior year, is now a defensive stalwart for the powerful Brown
ies. To gain his starting position, he unseated an all-time defensive
star, Lennie Ford. Witte? Well, the San Francisco 49ers are one
of three teams (the other two Canadian) who have cut him during
an uneventful career.
Play Where ilie Pickers Are
But more and more these days the key factor to a West Coast ball
player's A-A aspirations is a great game in the Fast, before ihe eyes
of 90 per cent of the pickers, who refuse to believe anybody out of
their area can be a halfway decent football player.
There is no doubt that this was the biggest factor in John Brodle's
miraele-of-miracles of 1956: nosing out already All-American Paul
Hornung of Notre Dame for consensus A-A honors. Early in the
season, John turned in a fabulous passing show before the many
thousands at Ohio State, and it's one they're still talking about in
Columbus. That show put him in the pickers' eyes.
Last season. Jack Curtice's passing whiz at Utah, Fee Grosscup,
won his national mention in exactly the same way. Grosscnp was
under the almost impossible handicap (when it comes to A-A honors)
of playing for a Skyline Conference school. For a Skyliner to make
even one A-A team, let alone all those that flrosscnp made, has be
come a truly miraculous achievement . . . because Skyline teams
seldom leave their area.
Lee had the remedy for the situation. Utah played one game in
the Fast last year . . . with Army. That afternoon Grosscnp had one
of the greatest days a passing quarterback could possibly dream of,
with his team losing to the heavily favored Cadets by 39-33 in the
season's wildest game. By chance, the Eastern writers had seen a
performance far better than any their local quarterbacks were turn
ing in.
Grosscnp was splashed onto All-American teams right and left
. . . because of just one game. With due respect to the great Ule
tosser, it must be said that the lucky quarterback might have been
Bob Newman of Washington State or even -lack Douglas of Stanford,
had they happened to play their greatest game of the season in the
Fast, or Midwest.
But despite all this, All-American teams are lots of fun and they'll
be around as long as college football hangs on. So let's just forget
these crazy circumstances and sit back and enjoy the pictures and
rest on the satisfaction that we know our guys are best anyway.



TROY BARBER
Corvallis' Latest Victim
Handbook for All-Americans
Tf there were such a thing as a Dandy Handy Handbook for Pa
cific Coast Football Players, the following essentials would surely he
included:
The Four Points of making an All-American team . . .
(1) Hire a personal agent.
(2) Get on a winning team (making sure, of course, that there is
a minimum of other great All-American prospects of your stature.)
(31 Play your best football in the first six games.
(4) Very important play a hang up game somewhere in the East
or Midwest.
That seems simple enough. And the time for those wonderful all
star aggregations to be selected is rapidly drawing near.
Looking back at recent A-A elevens (one magazine graciously
selects an A-A twenty-two, which isn't any simpler than eleven . . .
only you get to look a! more pictures) we West Coasters must sadly
admit that the above-mentioned four points are becoming pretty
much essential to attain national

acclaim.
Point No. 1 has been particu
larly brutal on Stanford tackles
in recent years and the current
Card line standout, Troy Barbee,
is taking it on the chin this year.
It seems that somebody is work
ing overtime in Corvallis.
Last season, Barbee, as a jun
ior, was a unanimous All-Coast
selection, and his junior running
mate, Bill Leeka of UCLA, was
on almost all of the selections,
too. This most certainly meant
PCC tackles will be classy 1 his
year.
Rut . . . when 1958 rolled around
and the newsstands were flooded
with the annual deluge of foot
ball magazines and the prominent
weeklies slipped in their gridiron
previews, where was Troy Bar
bee? For that matter, where was
Bill Leeka? Troy and Bill were
there, all right, but we find that
from out of nowhere Ted Bales
of Oregon State is now rated

the finest tackle on the' Coast and by some the finest in the nation.
Doubtless there are many Beaverites about the land who held
these beliefs about Ted Bates last season. And Ted Bates? proved one
whale of a football player last season. But seeing that he was almost
universally rated behind Barbee and I.eeka last season, why did it
become an almost universal opinion this year that Bates would sud
denly rise from the PCC's third best to the nation's very best?
Some Make It, Some Don't
Two years ago, OSC gave John Witte the big push at tackle, and
managed to swing most of the A-A pickers to his side. This despite
the prevailing Pacific Coast belief that Stanford had a much better
tackle in Paul Wiggin.
In fact, one Northwest sportswriter, after watching Idaho spend
an afternoon pushing Witte all over the field, devoted a full column
to the subject of this gross example of overrating and entitled it
aptly: "Some Make It, Some Don't." The"it" is All American rank
ing.
Witte had point No. 2 working in his favor, too. He was on a
winning team. Because OSC had rather come from nowhere to take
the PCC title, A-A pickers frantically needed a Beaver for their
squads and Witte was the handiest . . . since he had been shoved
into their faces at the season's start, anyway.
Paid Wiggin was hampered somewhat by the fact that there was
another real All-American on his team: John Brodie. Here we arrive
at the big sin of the A-A picker: giving too much attention to one
team, especially a non-title team. It is conceivable that had Stanford
won the PCC, Wiggin would have replaced Witte on most of the A-A
selections and, yes, two Cards would have been first-team choices.
Then, too, since most of the teams had pretty well taken shape
by the time the season was barely half over, selectors missed out on
seeing late-season slumps by numerous of their choices. Witte was
manhandled by Idaho in his next-to-last game.
Finally, why should I bring this up now, two years later? Is it
kicking a dead horse? Maybe, but then I take a look at Witte's 1 and
Wiggin's fortunes in pro football and the sore opens again. Wiggin,
an early draft choice by the then-champion Cleveland Browns during
his junior year, is now a defensive stalwart for the powerful Brown
ies. To gain his starting position, he unseated an all-time defensive

Witte had point No. 2 working in his favor, too. He was on a
winning team. Because OSC had rather come from nowhere to take
the PCC title, A-A pickers frantically needed a Beaver for their
squads and Witte was the handiest . . . since he had been shoved
into their faces at the season's start, anyway.
Paid Wiggin was hampered somewhat by the fact that there was
another real All-American on his team: John Brodie. Here we arrive
at the big sin of the A-A picker: giving too much attention to one
team, especially a non-title team. It is conceivable that had Stanford
won the PCC, Wiggin would have replaced Witte on most of the A-A
selections and, yes, two Cards would have been first-team choices.
Then, too, since most of the teams had pretty well taken shape
by the time the season was barely half over, selectors missed out on
seeing late-season slumps by numerous of their choices. Witte was
manhandled by Idaho in his next-to-last game.
Finally, why should I bring this up now, two years later? Is it
kicking a dead horse? Maybe, but then I take a look at Witte's 1 and
Wiggin's fortunes in pro football and the sore opens again. Wiggin,
an early draft choice by the then-champion Cleveland Browns during
his junior year, is now a defensive stalwart for the powerful Brown
ies. To gain his starting position, he unseated an all-time defensive
star, Lennie Ford. Witte? Well, the San Francisco 49ers are one
of three teams (the other two Canadian) who have cut him during
an uneventful career.
Play Where ilie Pickers Are
But more and more these days the key factor to a West Coast ball
player's A-A aspirations is a great game in the Fast, before ihe eyes
of 90 per cent of the pickers, who refuse to believe anybody out of
their area can be a halfway decent football player.
There is no doubt that this was the biggest factor in John Brodle's
miraele-of-miracles of 1956: nosing out already All-American Paul
Hornung of Notre Dame for consensus A-A honors. Early in the
season, John turned in a fabulous passing show before the many
thousands at Ohio State, and it's one they're still talking about in
Columbus. That show put him in the pickers' eyes.
Last season. Jack Curtice's passing whiz at Utah, Fee Grosscup,
won his national mention in exactly the same way. Grosscnp was
under the almost impossible handicap (when it comes to A-A honors)
of playing for a Skyline Conference school. For a Skyliner to make
even one A-A team, let alone all those that flrosscnp made, has be
come a truly miraculous achievement . . . because Skyline teams
seldom leave their area.
Lee had the remedy for the situation. Utah played one game in
the Fast last year . . . with Army. That afternoon Grosscnp had one
of the greatest days a passing quarterback could possibly dream of,
with his team losing to the heavily favored Cadets by 39-33 in the
season's wildest game. By chance, the Eastern writers had seen a
performance far better than any their local quarterbacks were turn
ing in.
Grosscnp was splashed onto All-American teams right and left
. . . because of just one game. With due respect to the great Ule
tosser, it must be said that the lucky quarterback might have been
Bob Newman of Washington State or even -lack Douglas of Stanford,
had they happened to play their greatest game of the season in the
Fast, or Midwest.
But despite all this, All-American teams are lots of fun and they'll
be around as long as college football hangs on. So let's just forget
these crazy circumstances and sit back and enjoy the pictures and
rest on the satisfaction that we know our guys are best anyway.



TROY BARBER
Corvallis' Latest Victim
Handbook for All-Americans
Tf there were such a thing as a Dandy Handy Handbook for Pa
cific Coast Football Players, the following essentials would surely he
included:
The Four Points of making an All-American team . . .
(1) Hire a personal agent.
(2) Get on a winning team (making sure, of course, that there is
a minimum of other great All-American prospects of your stature.)
(31 Play your best football in the first six games.
(4) Very important play a hang up game somewhere in the East
or Midwest.
That seems simple enough. And the time for those wonderful all
star aggregations to be selected is rapidly drawing near.
Looking back at recent A-A elevens (one magazine graciously
selects an A-A twenty-two, which isn't any simpler than eleven . . .
only you get to look a! more pictures) we West Coasters must sadly
admit that the above-mentioned four points are becoming pretty
much essential to attain national

acclaim.
Point No. 1 has been particu
larly brutal on Stanford tackles
in recent years and the current
Card line standout, Troy Barbee,
is taking it on the chin this year.
It seems that somebody is work
ing overtime in Corvallis.
Last season, Barbee, as a jun
ior, was a unanimous All-Coast
selection, and his junior running
mate, Bill Leeka of UCLA, was
on almost all of the selections,
too. This most certainly meant
PCC tackles will be classy 1 his
year.
Rut . . . when 1958 rolled around
and the newsstands were flooded
with the annual deluge of foot
ball magazines and the prominent
weeklies slipped in their gridiron
previews, where was Troy Bar
bee? For that matter, where was
Bill Leeka? Troy and Bill were
there, all right, but we find that
from out of nowhere Ted Bales
of Oregon State is now rated

the finest tackle on the' Coast and by some the finest in the nation.
Doubtless there are many Beaverites about the land who held
these beliefs about Ted Bates last season. And Ted Bates? proved one
whale of a football player last season. But seeing that he was almost
universally rated behind Barbee and I.eeka last season, why did it
become an almost universal opinion this year that Bates would sud
denly rise from the PCC's third best to the nation's very best?
Some Make It, Some Don't
Two years ago, OSC gave John Witte the big push at tackle, and
managed to swing most of the A-A pickers to his side. This despite
the prevailing Pacific Coast belief that Stanford had a much better
tackle in Paul Wiggin.
In fact, one Northwest sportswriter, after watching Idaho spend
an afternoon pushing Witte all over the field, devoted a full column
to the subject of this gross example of overrating and entitled it
aptly: "Some Make It, Some Don't." The"it" is All American rank
ing.
