# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Bessey saw his first varsity
competition against the Air
Force last week, and though he
looked good the statistics don't
favor him with more than a â€”1
rushing average. He caught
one 11-yard pass. Bessey is fast
and this is a welcomed change
in the Card back field. Should
see more action this season.

Forced to sit out last year,
Jones found quite a bit of com
petition ahead of him when he
reported for practice this year.
He has seen spotted action this
year while Jack Curtice has
tried to shape up the end posi
tions. Should fig u r e mo r e
strongly for '59 season. Stands
6-1, weighs 193.
