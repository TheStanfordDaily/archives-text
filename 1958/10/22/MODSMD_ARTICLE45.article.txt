# Smith Pleased With Early Play of Strong Frosh Line
## 
### 
'I'hc hard boneerushing practice sessions which have marked ihe
freshman football team's workouts up until this week have given
way to the ironing out of defensive difficulties and the polishing up
of offensive finesse.
This is the word from Coach Homer Smith's frosh camp. Smilh

says he and the coaches are satis
fied with the results of the scrim
maging to date and will spend
from now until their first game,
Saturday, Nov. 1, perfecting
plays.
Especially impressive is the
frosh defensive line. In several
practice scrimmages against the
varsity secondary, Bill Muller,
Bob Drakulick, Tom Walsh and
Dave Nolan have been very effec
tive in stopping the opposition's
offense. Linebackers Chris Cottle
and Hal Steuber have also done
fine jobs in the practice sessions.
One big change which Smith
has made on offense is the -switch
ing of Bill Kuhn from his wing

back spot to fullback. Smith says
this change will take advantage of
Kuhn's powerful running ability
that he has shown to date. Kuhn
has also been outstanding on de
fense.
"We are especially pleased with
our quarterbacking," Smith add
ed. "It looks like the Jim Smith
to - Marlin Walling combination

The freshman football team
will play its annual game
against the second-string var
sity this Friday on the frosh
practice field. Starting time is
4 p.m.

will be a good one." Smith, who is
from Grant-s Pass, Ore., is making
a strong bid for starting-quarter
back. and Walling at end is rated
as the No. 1 target on passes.
The frosh open their season in
Stanford Stadium Saturday, Nov.
1, against the Trobabes from
southern California.
