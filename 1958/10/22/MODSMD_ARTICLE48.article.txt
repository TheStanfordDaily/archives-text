# Bruins Add New Look With Plenty of Passes
## 
### 
There will be all kinds of new
things coming out of the UCLA
I side of the Coliseum this Saturday
I when Stanford squares off against
■ the Baby Blue Bruins in Los An
i geles.
In addition to the revamped
! lineup made necessary by the five
game senior penalties, coach Bill
Barnes will unveil for the home
folks the "new look" ho installed
in the single wing offense last
week against Washington.
Taking liberties with what is
traditionally known as a power of
fense, Barnes added a split end
and flanker wingback to the at
tack to take advantage (if the tal
ent that had made this the "pass
ing-est" of the Bruin single-wing
teams.
But the big passer-receiver com
bina ion of (he new-found aerial
attack Don Long throwing to
Dick Wallen had to call it a sea
son after last week's game.
Kendall to Take Over
Chuck Kendall, senior letter
man, has been handed the task of
filling the void left by Long. Ken
dall has seen only limited action
ihis season but last year topped
Bruin rushers with 388 net yards
and a 3.96 average. A knee injury
has hampered him this year, but
he came out of the Washington
clash in good shape.
If Kendall were to falter the
Bruins will have Kirk Wilson who
can also fill in adequately at the
tailback spot. Wilson was 1956
collegiate punting champion and
is a good thrower as well.
Wallen will lie replaced by two
year letterman John Brown, who
hasn't been exactly sitting around
this season. Brown has grabbed
off eight passes for a healthy 162
yards. Remaining at the other end
will be Jim Steffen, who can also
fill in at the tailback slot.
Experienced men will take over
at two of the vacated line posi
tions, wit h sophomore Harry Bald
win getting the call at center to
replace Dick Butler. Paul Ogles
by, the largest Bruin forward, at
223 pounds, steps into a big void
at tackle, where he replaces All-
Coast Bill Leeka; and Bob King
replaces Clint Whitfield at guard.
Both Oglesby and King are jun
iors.
Peterson at Blocking' Back
Blocking-back Steve Gertsman,
the sixth five-game senior, has al
ready been replaced in the lineup
by senior Dave Peterson. Gerts
man suffered a knee injury early
in the season and saw only brief
action against Washington.
With a record of just 2 wins
against 3 losses, UCLA may be off

to its worst season in 10 years, i
The first three years of the Red I
Sanders regime saw just three |
losses apiece. For the next four |
years, the team lost only five!
games, including two tight Rose j
Bowl thrillers to Michigan State. 1
The 1956 outfit posted a 7-3
mark, including a heartbreaking
14-13 triumph over Stanford, and
last season's club was dumped by
only Oregon and Ihe Cards, in

rolling to an 8-2 record.
For coach Jack Curtice, it will
be the first Southland invasion as
Indian mentor and the first of the j
three big California rivalries he'll
have to prepare for each year.
While at Utah, however, Curtice
almost pulled a major upset over
the Bruins. His 1956 Redskins
opened the season by dropping a
narrow 13-7 decision to the Baby j
Blue in the Coliseum.

There will be all kinds of new
things coming out of the UCLA
I side of the Coliseum this Saturday
I when Stanford squares off against
■ the Baby Blue Bruins in Los An
i geles.
In addition to the revamped
! lineup made necessary by the five
game senior penalties, coach Bill
Barnes will unveil for the home
folks the "new look" ho installed
in the single wing offense last
week against Washington.
Taking liberties with what is
traditionally known as a power of
fense, Barnes added a split end
and flanker wingback to the at
tack to take advantage (if the tal
ent that had made this the "pass
ing-est" of the Bruin single-wing
teams.
But the big passer-receiver com
bina ion of (he new-found aerial
attack Don Long throwing to
Dick Wallen had to call it a sea
son after last week's game.
Kendall to Take Over
Chuck Kendall, senior letter
man, has been handed the task of
filling the void left by Long. Ken
dall has seen only limited action
ihis season but last year topped
Bruin rushers with 388 net yards
and a 3.96 average. A knee injury
has hampered him this year, but
he came out of the Washington
clash in good shape.
If Kendall were to falter the
Bruins will have Kirk Wilson who
can also fill in adequately at the
tailback spot. Wilson was 1956
collegiate punting champion and
is a good thrower as well.
Wallen will lie replaced by two
year letterman John Brown, who
hasn't been exactly sitting around
this season. Brown has grabbed
off eight passes for a healthy 162
yards. Remaining at the other end
will be Jim Steffen, who can also
fill in at the tailback slot.
Experienced men will take over
at two of the vacated line posi
tions, wit h sophomore Harry Bald
win getting the call at center to
replace Dick Butler. Paul Ogles
by, the largest Bruin forward, at
223 pounds, steps into a big void
at tackle, where he replaces All-
Coast Bill Leeka; and Bob King
replaces Clint Whitfield at guard.
Both Oglesby and King are jun
iors.
Peterson at Blocking' Back
Blocking-back Steve Gertsman,
the sixth five-game senior, has al
ready been replaced in the lineup
by senior Dave Peterson. Gerts
man suffered a knee injury early

action against Washington.
