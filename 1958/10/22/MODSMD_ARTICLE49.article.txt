## 
### Associated Press 
Texas, Auburn and Mississippi,
voted into the fourth, fifth and
sixth spots in the Associated
Press college football poll this
week, had better have a care.
Those spots are exceedingly vul
nerable.
As the unbeaten Army power
house again was voted the No. 1
spot by the sportswriters and
sportscasters, the previous hold
ers of these three positions drop
ped from the top 10 entirely, all
' victims in games last Saturday.
Wisconsin lost to lowa, Michi
| gan State to Purdue, and Navy
, was upset by Tulane.
On the strength of its victory,
; lowa jumped from 13th place to
I 7th this week. Northwestern mov
ed from 17th to Bth as a result of
its tremendous showing in trounc
ing Michigan, and Oklahoma mov
ed up from 11th to 9th, the voters
obviously impressed by the Soon
ers' lopsided victory over Kansas.
Army received — first - place
votes —68 more than Louisiana
i State, which climbed from 9th po
sition to 3rd and was second in
the number of votes for the No. 1
position.
Ohio State Up
Ohio State, moving from 3rd to
; 2nd, received only 14 votes for the
No. 1 spot, but it had tremendous
support for the lesser positions in
| the top 10.
The tie with Georgia Tech was
; costly to Auburn, which dropped
| from 2d a week ago to sth, right
i behind Texas. The Longhorns
j jumped from 7th to 4th.
Only No. 1 Army and No. 10
; Clemson retained their positions
over a week end which saw a
I wave of upsets sweep the nation's
J gridirons.

Some of the leaders face real
trouble this week. An Army team
that may be minus its star back,
Pete Dawkins, meets a deep and
t ugged Pittsburgh eleven, a n d
Ohio State takes on a good Wis
consin team which is smarting
from its first loss, to Iowa.
Louisiana State takes on Flor
ida. which has won 2, tied 1 and
lost 1. Texas and Auburn will be
favored over Rice and Maryland,
respectively, and Mississippi is a
top-heavy choice over Arkansas.
Iowa and Northwestern, the
No. 7 and No. 8 teams, tangle in
what promises to be a thriller,
based on the performances of the
two teams last week. Oklahoma
figures to outdistance Kansas
State, hut Clemson may find
South Carolina tougher than its
record might indicate particular
ly when the intense rivalry is con
sidered.
The second 10 are Notre Dame,
Colorado, Wisconsin, Air Force
Academy, Purdue, Texas Chris
tian, Georgia Tech, Navy, Missis
sippi State and Michigan State.
