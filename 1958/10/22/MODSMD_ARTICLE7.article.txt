## Send the Chappie Home; Dad Knows the Jokes 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
The never-say-die boys in the
little shack across the street are
at it again — this time with a
brand-new volume to work on.
Those of us who know better
will be squinting this morning to
avoid the glare of the bright red
Chaparral covers which now deco
rate the columns of the Quad.
Freshmen and others new to the
campus will probably be fleeted
of a hard-earned 35 cents because
they just don't know any better.
The unaware will be congregat
ing around the corners of the
Quad and the Post Office. The
aware will be congregating around
the unaware, knowing that a free
look at a record low in campus
humor may be had with a casual,
over-l he-shoulder technique.
Like most campus publication
people, Blarney Google and his
buddies have found it hard to dig
up new material for the first issue
—so that, with a few exceptions,
they have rewritten some of the
more successful stories of last
year. (This is qualitatively said:
last year's work wasn't the best
we've seen, ergo . . .)
Then, there's the Queen. A
FRESHMAN PHYSICS MAJOR?

But The? Old Boy must take his
opportunity while no one is look
ing to poke fun at The Daily. We
would like to inquire thus: If, in
his slightly senile state of mind,
he thinks The Daily is an example
of humor and is good for laughs,
why does the Chappie bother to
come out at all?
We do, however, agree with The
Old Boy that his theme for this
issue is a "kind of general back-to
the-rut number." Then we try to
define the rut as exemplified last
year. Well . . .
