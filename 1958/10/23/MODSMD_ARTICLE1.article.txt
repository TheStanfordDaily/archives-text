### Dallas Young 
United States foreign aid was criticized sharply by members of
the lIR panel last night at Los Arcos eating club.
Panel members were Julie Beard, United States; Ramasesha Bha
rat, India; Leo Paul de Alvarez, Philippines; Ali A. Seif, United Arab
Republic; and Phil Stohr, moderator.

Bharat claimed that U.S. for
eign aid has too many strings at
tached. Countries desperately
needing aid to save their starving
people accept it whether it comes
from the U.S. or Russia, he said.
The U.S. is too hesitant in offer
ing aid to such unsure invest
ment prospects as Burma, he
added.
According to Seif, the U.A.R. is
accepting aid from Russia be
cause it fears the threat of U.S.
domination in the Middle East.
All the Arabs want is freedom to
have their own internal and for
eign policy, he said.
They need money to educate
their 80 per cent illiterate popu
lation, and to build roads and
health centers, Seif explained.
An informal question and an
swer period followed the formal
panel discussion.
