more than 40 living groups, a "great turnout" according to decora-

tions chairman Sam Bradt.
Crepe paper ordered earlier
this week by living groups for
use in decorations can be picked
up Friday afternoon at the Alpha
Delt house, said Bradt.

antee that more can be ordered,
however.
Additional supplies, such as
lumber and chicken wire, may
also be obtained through Bradt.

types of decorations tying in with

take shape on campus soon," ac
