ANZIO, Italy (4>) — A British
turboprop airliner and an Italian
jet fighter collided in a cloudless
sky four miles over this World
War II battlefield Wednesday.
The 31 persons in the passenger
plane plummeted to death. The
fighter pilot parachuted into the
sea and was rescued.
An airline spokesman said the
collision tore open the front of
the airliner's fuselage. The
plane's pressurized cabin was de
compressed suddenly, and most
of the passengers were sucked
out into the air.
The Viscount plunged onto an
Italian army artillery range about
500 yards from the Mediterranean
and burst into flames. Pieces of
wreckage flew over an area of
more than a mile.
Twenty-seven bodies were scat
tered around the plane. Three
bodies were found inside the
burned fuselage.
There were 26 passengers and
a crew of five on the plane. It
was en route from London to Na
ples and Malta.
