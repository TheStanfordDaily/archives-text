# Army Sends Up New Satellite
## Contact Lost With Jupiter-C As 2nd Stage Due to Ignite

from the ground, but when the
signals were lost it was not
known what had happened to the
satellite high in space.
"It is expected that no further
information will be available be
fore 5 a.m. PST Thursday," offi
cials said one hour after the
launching.
Detailed examination of all in
strumentation data was under
way.
Thus, the whereabouts of the
unique balloon satellite called
"Beacon" was a mystery.
The mighty rocket climbed
slowly at first atop a huge tail of
yellow flame. It rose steadily, ac
celerating rapidly.
Speeds East
After 60 seconds the rocket
curved gracefully high in the
black Florida sky and sped to
ward the east. It was still speed
ing across the sky steadily for
more than 2Vs minutes before a
bright flash was seen. This ap
peared to be burnout of the first
stage Redstone booster rocket at
an altitude of about 250 miles.
The rocket was in sight for
about three minutes before it dis
appeared from the view of press
observers watching the spectacu
lar launching from a tower about
two miles from the launching
site.
Late Launching
The launching came 21 minutes
after the designated zero hour.
This meant that several slight
delays were called during the
count-down to adjust minor tech
nical problems.
If everything went well, the
United States would have the first
satellite visible to the naked eye.
Even at maximum altitude, the
12-foot diameter balloon while re
flecting the sun should be as
bright as the stars in the Big Dip
per. It will glow brighter as it
descends toward earth in its orbit,
and will be observable just before
dawn and at twilight.
During that time, scientists
hope to track Beacon visually to
learn more about the behavior of
the varying density of the earth's
atmosphere at extreme altitudes.
Most Complex Missile
The balloon - equipped satellite
and its propelling rocket vehicle
comprise perhaps the most com
plex long-range missile ever fired
from this testing ground. Four
rocket stages had to fire in se
quence before the satellite case,
weighing 28.6 pounds, was finally
hurled into orbit at an 1800-mile
an-hour speed.
The 9'4-pound balloon, called
Beacon by the sponsoring Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, was made of a
tough plastic called mylar with a
thin coat of aluminum.

bright as the stars in the Big Dip
per. It will glow brighter as it
descends toward earth in its orbit,
and will be observable just before
dawn and at twilight.
During that time, scientists
hope to track Beacon visually to
learn more about the behavior of
the varying density of the earth's
atmosphere at extreme altitudes.
Most Complex Missile
The balloon - equipped satellite
and its propelling rocket vehicle
comprise perhaps the most com
plex long-range missile ever fired
from this testing ground. Four
rocket stages had to fire in se
quence before the satellite case,
weighing 28.6 pounds, was finally
hurled into orbit at an 1800-mile
an-hour speed.
The 9'4-pound balloon, called
Beacon by the sponsoring Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration, was made of a
tough plastic called mylar with a
thin coat of aluminum.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/P) —The Army launched a balloon sat
ellite toward space Wednesday night but signals were lost 10 seconds
before the second stage of the mighty Jupiter-C launching rocket was
due to ignite.
The spectacular launching at 7:21 p.m. PST appeared to be perfect
from the ground, but when the
signals were lost it was not
known what had happened to the
satellite high in space.
"It is expected that no further
information will be available be
fore 5 a.m. PST Thursday," offi
cials said one hour after the
launching.
Detailed examination of all in
strumentation data was under
way.
Thus, the whereabouts of the
unique balloon satellite called
"Beacon" was a mystery.
The mighty rocket climbed
slowly at first atop a huge tail of
yellow flame. It rose steadily, ac
celerating rapidly.
Speeds East
After 60 seconds the rocket
curved gracefully high in the
black Florida sky and sped to
ward the east. It was still speed
ing across the sky steadily for
more than 2Vs minutes before a
bright flash was seen. This ap
peared to be burnout of the first
stage Redstone booster rocket at
an altitude of about 250 miles.
The rocket was in sight for
about three minutes before it dis
appeared from the view of press
observers watching the spectacu
lar launching from a tower about
two miles from the launching
site.
Late Launching
The launching came 21 minutes
after the designated zero hour.
This meant that several slight
delays were called during the
count-down to adjust minor tech
nical problems.
If everything went well, the
United States would have the first
satellite visible to the naked eye.
Even at maximum altitude, the
12-foot diameter balloon while re
flecting the sun should be as
bright as the stars in the Big Dip
per. It will glow brighter as it
descends toward earth in its orbit,
and will be observable just before
dawn and at twilight.
