Area Young Democrats yester

Lopez, who is attempting to
break the Republican Party's 49-
year hold on the secretaryship,
said inadequate registration pro
cedures and acute commuter
problems keep people who wish
to vote from the polls.
Lopez also proposed simplifica
tion of the ballot, abolition of
cross-filing, and statewide instal
lation of voting machines. He de

harbingers of false prosperity,

strongesst it has been at any time
during the last decade.
