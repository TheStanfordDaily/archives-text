# Living Groups Compete In WUS Funds Drive
## 
### 
big push, the drive has brought in
about $700 in the first two days,
Praetorius added.
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students, has this to say about
the drive: "World University
Service is essentially a program
of self-help. Every dollar invested
starts a chain reaction which re
sults in many dollars' worth of
benefits.
"Stanford students have marie
an imposing record in promot
ing international understanding
through the lIR, the ASSU For
eign Scholarship program, the
Model UN Assembly and many
other activities. Our contribu
tions to WUS may seem a bit re
mote, but they are as important
as anything we can do. I hope
that every Stanford student will
respond to this appeal."

The drive for World University Service funds has resulted in com
petition among the casas in Lagunita, and inter-wing competition at
both Branner and Roble, according to Mike Praetorius, drive chair
man.
With several of the living groups not yet making their final

Checks payable to the Stanford
Relief Fund may be mailed to the
ASSU office by both faculty and
off campus students, Praetorius
added.
