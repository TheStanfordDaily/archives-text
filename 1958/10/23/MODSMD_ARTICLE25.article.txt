To Host Alumni
Editor; Tin* Daily:
This letter is to clarify the ap
parent confusion of having two
major "rallies" for Homecoming.
First of all, the Friday night
rally is a student affair in the
traditional sense. Saturday morn
ing is an ALUMNI PROGRAM—
something new in the realm of
Stanford's Homecomings.
The Saturday Alumni program
wasMesigned to draw Alumni and
Stanford friends to the Campus.
The vast majority of these people
arrive here Saturday morning,
not Friday night. In the past the
tendency has been for this crowd
to come by train to Palo Alto, go
directly to the stadium, and go
directly home after the game
without seeing any more of the
campus than the stadium. They
feel that there is nothing new or
different enough to warrant walk
ing all the way to the center of
Campus.
We are trying to cement rela
tions for the school by having
Alumni and friends really see
the school, and making it more
real to them. We also feel that
they will gain interest from con
tact with students and old class
mates.
The Saturday program, which
lasts from 10 a.m. to game time,
will include the pompon girls,
coaches, cheerleaders, co-captains
and the band. The alumni will
not have had the opportunity to
see or meet any of them before,
and the alums are quite anxious
to see rallies. The program is not
limited to the "rally". Over an
hour of entertainment by campus
groups, members of the Hall of
F a m e, and announcement of
house decoration winners will
also be part of the program.
The Athletic Department, the
Alumni Association, the General
Secretary's office. Rally Com. and
Legislature have all given cooper
ation, advice, and support.
Since Big Game is not here this
year, Homecoming will be the
only time this year when we will
have a chance to meet our alumni.
Only $2") was budgeted for this

year's Homecoming because the
new program was not anticipated
last year. We have financed most
of the venture through the gener
osity of several sources. With pos
sible commissions on various pro
jects that we have undertaken,
there is a definite possibility that
we will come out even on the pro- |
gram. We only asked that Legis
lature underwrite the amount we i
are not sure of.
Will it work? We hope so, and
we definitely feel that it is worth j
a try. We have reached 78,000
alumni and Penninsula homes in
an effort to promote the program.
The Alumni wants our support
just as much as we want theirs!
In an attempt to make Home-;
coming "Bigger and better than
ever." we have planned the above
program for alumni and visitors
as well as for the student Body.
We hope that the entire student
body will support this campus
wide activity and suggestions are
always welcome.

He was just a sad-smiling boy j
until recently, when he received
the peculiar suffix: late Mr. S. D.
He could easily make friends be
cause he was modest, gentle, i
helpful and kind. Popular in the
wing of his dorm, bearing the;
burden of having been a refugee
from a Communist country, he
could not cope with the horrible
heritage of that inhuman system:
he was taken to a mental hospital
early this year after an attempted
suicide.
The case is terribly familiar for
those from behind the Iron Cur
tain: his mother had been molest
ed by the Secret Police back home
because of her son in this coun- 1
try. The boy had some remem- j
brances and could vividly imagine ;
what it meant. His already wreck- j
ed life did not promise him more !
than a few troublesome years in ;
the mental institution. He got j
worse every week as the terror
grew in his country: life became

unbearably complicated for him.
Was there any way out?
Terror, which so kills even in a
free country while pretending co
existence, has now another wit
ness against itself. Be God merci
ful to him and to us.

My soul is warmed to see a
great campus personality at last
receive proper recognition. The
legion of motorized students will
join me in congratulating The
Daily on the fine article applaud
ing Captain Midnight.
Carl is like the telephone —
ubiquitous and full of quaint little
quirks, like the spreading of
Christmas cheer by leaving little
white envelopes on the wind
shields of his favorite patrons in
place of sending cards. . . . We
love him!
We have garnished his path to
success with palm leaves from
our checkbooks. We are glad that
our sacrifice has not been in vain.

are not sure of.
Will it work? We hope so, and
we definitely feel that it is worth j
a try. We have reached 78,000
alumni and Penninsula homes in
an effort to promote the program.
The Alumni wants our support
just as much as we want theirs!
In an attempt to make Home-;

He was just a sad-smiling boy j
until recently, when he received
the peculiar suffix: late Mr. S. D.
He could easily make friends be
cause he was modest, gentle, i
helpful and kind. Popular in the
wing of his dorm, bearing the;
burden of having been a refugee
from a Communist country, he
could not cope with the horrible
heritage of that inhuman system:
he was taken to a mental hospital
early this year after an attempted
suicide.
The case is terribly familiar for
those from behind the Iron Cur
tain: his mother had been molest
ed by the Secret Police back home
because of her son in this coun- 1
try. The boy had some remem- j
brances and could vividly imagine ;
what it meant. His already wreck- j
ed life did not promise him more !
than a few troublesome years in ;
the mental institution. He got j
worse every week as the terror
grew in his country: life became

unbearably complicated for him.
Was there any way out?
Terror, which so kills even in a
free country while pretending co
existence, has now another wit
ness against itself. Be God merci
ful to him and to us.

Editor; Tin* Daily:
This letter is to clarify the ap
parent confusion of having two
major "rallies" for Homecoming.
First of all, the Friday night
rally is a student affair in the
traditional sense. Saturday morn
ing is an ALUMNI PROGRAM—
something new in the realm of
Stanford's Homecomings.
The Saturday Alumni program
wasMesigned to draw Alumni and
Stanford friends to the Campus.
The vast majority of these people
arrive here Saturday morning,
not Friday night. In the past the
tendency has been for this crowd
to come by train to Palo Alto, go
directly to the stadium, and go
directly home after the game
without seeing any more of the
campus than the stadium. They
feel that there is nothing new or
different enough to warrant walk
ing all the way to the center of
Campus.
We are trying to cement rela
tions for the school by having
Alumni and friends really see
the school, and making it more
real to them. We also feel that
they will gain interest from con
tact with students and old class
mates.
The Saturday program, which
lasts from 10 a.m. to game time,
will include the pompon girls,
coaches, cheerleaders, co-captains
and the band. The alumni will
not have had the opportunity to
see or meet any of them before,
and the alums are quite anxious
to see rallies. The program is not
limited to the "rally". Over an
hour of entertainment by campus
groups, members of the Hall of
F a m e, and announcement of
house decoration winners will
also be part of the program.
The Athletic Department, the
Alumni Association, the General
Secretary's office. Rally Com. and
Legislature have all given cooper
ation, advice, and support.
Since Big Game is not here this
year, Homecoming will be the
only time this year when we will
have a chance to meet our alumni.
Only $2") was budgeted for this

year's Homecoming because the
new program was not anticipated
last year. We have financed most
of the venture through the gener
osity of several sources. With pos
sible commissions on various pro
jects that we have undertaken,
there is a definite possibility that
we will come out even on the pro- |
gram. We only asked that Legis

Editor; Tin* Daily:
This letter is to clarify the ap
parent confusion of having two
major "rallies" for Homecoming.
First of all, the Friday night
rally is a student affair in the
traditional sense. Saturday morn
ing is an ALUMNI PROGRAM—
something new in the realm of
Stanford's Homecomings.
The Saturday Alumni program
wasMesigned to draw Alumni and
Stanford friends to the Campus.
The vast majority of these people
arrive here Saturday morning,
not Friday night. In the past the
tendency has been for this crowd
to come by train to Palo Alto, go
directly to the stadium, and go
directly home after the game
without seeing any more of the
campus than the stadium. They
feel that there is nothing new or
different enough to warrant walk
ing all the way to the center of
Campus.
We are trying to cement rela
tions for the school by having
Alumni and friends really see
the school, and making it more
real to them. We also feel that
they will gain interest from con
tact with students and old class
mates.
The Saturday program, which
lasts from 10 a.m. to game time,
will include the pompon girls,
coaches, cheerleaders, co-captains
and the band. The alumni will
not have had the opportunity to
see or meet any of them before,
and the alums are quite anxious
to see rallies. The program is not
limited to the "rally". Over an
hour of entertainment by campus
groups, members of the Hall of
F a m e, and announcement of
house decoration winners will
also be part of the program.
The Athletic Department, the
Alumni Association, the General
Secretary's office. Rally Com. and
Legislature have all given cooper
ation, advice, and support.
Since Big Game is not here this
year, Homecoming will be the
only time this year when we will
have a chance to meet our alumni.
Only $2") was budgeted for this

year's Homecoming because the
new program was not anticipated
last year. We have financed most
of the venture through the gener
osity of several sources. With pos
sible commissions on various pro
jects that we have undertaken,
there is a definite possibility that
we will come out even on the pro- |
gram. We only asked that Legis
lature underwrite the amount we i
are not sure of.
Will it work? We hope so, and
we definitely feel that it is worth j
a try. We have reached 78,000
alumni and Penninsula homes in
an effort to promote the program.
The Alumni wants our support
just as much as we want theirs!
In an attempt to make Home-;
coming "Bigger and better than
ever." we have planned the above
program for alumni and visitors
as well as for the student Body.
We hope that the entire student
body will support this campus
wide activity and suggestions are
always welcome.

He was just a sad-smiling boy j
until recently, when he received
the peculiar suffix: late Mr. S. D.
He could easily make friends be
cause he was modest, gentle, i
helpful and kind. Popular in the
wing of his dorm, bearing the;
burden of having been a refugee
from a Communist country, he
could not cope with the horrible
heritage of that inhuman system:
he was taken to a mental hospital
early this year after an attempted
suicide.
The case is terribly familiar for
those from behind the Iron Cur
tain: his mother had been molest
ed by the Secret Police back home
because of her son in this coun- 1
try. The boy had some remem- j
brances and could vividly imagine ;
what it meant. His already wreck- j
ed life did not promise him more !
than a few troublesome years in ;
the mental institution. He got j
worse every week as the terror
grew in his country: life became

unbearably complicated for him.
Was there any way out?
Terror, which so kills even in a
free country while pretending co
existence, has now another wit
ness against itself. Be God merci
ful to him and to us.
