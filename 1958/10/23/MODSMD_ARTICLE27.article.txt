# UN 						Weathers 13 Years of Change
## 
### C. Easton Rothwell Director, Hoover Institution 
Tho United Nations will be 13
years old Friday. It is about five
years younger than the average
member of the Stanford freshman
class. Yet within its brief life have
occurred some of the most sweep
ing and tumultuous changes of
the 20th century. These changes
have been accompanied by much
tension and some violence, as
nations great and small, young
and old, have contended for posi
tion, power territory, ideas, even
survival. The changes have been
revolutionary in effect. In 13
years they have produced an
essentially new order of things,
as we Americans realize when
we contemplate our tax bill.
The United Nations has suc
ceeded in growing up at the heart
of these changes. It has made
some gains in strength, although
not enough to satisfy all of its
critics. It has almost doubled its
membership. It has blunted some
of the conflicts growing out of
mid-century change, and eased
some of the adjustment. It has
made more peaceful the drive of
Asian, African, and some Western
Hemisphere peoples towards nat
ional independence of self-govern
ment. It has helped the less dev
eloped peoples of the world to
realize some of their rising ex
pectations.
Fails Function
Yet, thus far, it has failed in
some of its most important func
tions — for example, to bring
about the regulation of arma
ments and the control of nuclear
weapons.
Birthdays are appropriate occa
sions for stock-taking. Before we
judge the United Nations as it
enters its 14th year, however, we
would do well to remember what
it is and what it is not. It is not,
as some people mistakenly be
lieve, a superstate with power to
override its members. Such a
superstate has not proved politi
cally feasible in the middie of the
20th century, despite whatever
advantages it would offer in an
age nuclear warheads and moon
missiles. Nor does the United
Nations have about it some kind
of mystical quality that enables
it to pursue peace and well-being
except as this is willed by its
members, each of whom calcu
lates its will with one eye on its
own national interest.
81 Nations
The United Nations is really
an association of 81 nations. Mem
bership is voluntary, although it
is necessary to be voted into the
"club by two-thirds of the present
members, after having obtained
the unanimous approval of the
veto - wielding members of the

Security Council. Nations may
withdraw, although none have
since 19-15. Instead, there has been
a waiting list of applicants, many
of them new nations born since
194:5. The nations value member
ship because the advantages of
being "in the club" far outweigh
any disadvantags.
The United Nations, because it
is a voluntary association, can
not compel its members or other
states to do things. The Charter,
to be sure, provides that when one
or more states are actually threat
ening the peace, the Security
Council can require the members
to apply certain sanctions against
those states. These provisions
have never been put into effect,
however, and probably never will
be. Instead, the United Nations
will probably rely in the future
as in the past, upon voluntary
cooperation to get things done.
The most important purpose of
the United Nations is to maintain
peace and security. During the
past 13 years the organization has
been used to halt several small
but dangerous wars. UN pres
sures and sanctions have also
been applied to obtain the settle
ment of threatening disputes, or,
in the case of Korea, to repell ag
gression. For many reasons, not
least the heavy costs in blood and
gold of the Korean police action,
the use of so drastic a measure
will probably not be attempted
again soon, despite its history
making significance.
Peaceful Ways
Instead the United Nations will
probably be used in the future in
creasingly to help find peaceful
ways to settle conflicts, and to
provide means for releasing ten
sions.
In 13 years the Secretariat of
the United Nations together with
the men and women who repre
sent their own governments in
New York, have gained experi
ence and seasoning. The wiser of
them know that Constructive ad
justment and peace-building are
seldom advanced by flamboyant
debate and frantic vote-taking.
Rather, they are achieved by
quiet consultation and by skilled,
imaginative negotiation on the
part of men whose knowledge of
the issues and of the forces at
work is sound and full.
The second great purpose of
the United Nations is to reduce
the probabilities of conflict by
elevating standards of well-being
and education throughout the
world. When the Charter was
drawn, the founding nations as
sumed that frustrated aspirations
could produce conflict among in
dividuals and among states. The
task of improving well-being and
and helping to meet aspirations
was given both to the United

Nations itself and to a circle of
specialized agencies such as the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agriculture Organiza
tion, and UNESCO.
Exceeds Scope
It is not feasible within the com
pass of this article to summarize
what has been done during the
past 13 years to improve human
well-being on this planet. Perhaps
it is sufficient to say that the
amount of constructive interna
tional cooperation carried out dur
ing the short life-term of the
United Nations exceeds in scope
and quantity all that had gone
before.
The impressive and hopeful
character of this work is exempli
fied in a distinguished visitor
who spent some hours at Stan
ford last week. He is Mr. Maurice
Pate, who began his relief act
ivities many years ago with Her
bert Hoover, and who is presently
director of the United Nations In
ternational Childrens Emergency
Fund (UNICEF).
Today UNICEF is improving
the health and welfore of child
ren and expectant mothers in 100
countries. To do this it works

through the governments of these
countries. It obtains the collabor
ation of the World Health Organ
ization and other agencies.
And it spends each year $25
by governments, foundations, and
individuals.
Weathered Decade
In its 13th year, 1933, the
League of Nations was beginning
its first phase of disintegration
under the impact of destructive
nationalistic forces and a great
depression. Today, at the end of
its 13th year, the United Nations
has weathered a decade of Cold
War, of various and contentions
young nationalism, of spectacu
lar and dangerous technological
advance, and of shifting configur
ations of power. It shows no evi
dence of weakening or disinte
grating. On the contrary, no self
respecting Secretary of State or
Foreign Minister would miss the
opportunity to lead his nation's
delegation to the annual General
Assembly. He can't find any
where in the world a better ros
trum and as many of the men and
women to whom and about whom
he wants to talk.

least the heavy costs in blood and
gold of the Korean police action,
the use of so drastic a measure
will probably not be attempted
again soon, despite its history
making significance.
Peaceful Ways
Instead the United Nations will
probably be used in the future in
creasingly to help find peaceful
ways to settle conflicts, and to
provide means for releasing ten
sions.
In 13 years the Secretariat of
the United Nations together with
the men and women who repre
sent their own governments in
New York, have gained experi
ence and seasoning. The wiser of
them know that Constructive ad
justment and peace-building are
seldom advanced by flamboyant
debate and frantic vote-taking.
Rather, they are achieved by
quiet consultation and by skilled,
imaginative negotiation on the
part of men whose knowledge of
the issues and of the forces at
work is sound and full.
The second great purpose of
the United Nations is to reduce
the probabilities of conflict by
elevating standards of well-being
and education throughout the
world. When the Charter was
drawn, the founding nations as
sumed that frustrated aspirations
could produce conflict among in
dividuals and among states. The
task of improving well-being and
and helping to meet aspirations
was given both to the United

Nations itself and to a circle of
specialized agencies such as the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agriculture Organiza
tion, and UNESCO.
Exceeds Scope
It is not feasible within the com
pass of this article to summarize
what has been done during the
past 13 years to improve human
well-being on this planet. Perhaps
it is sufficient to say that the
amount of constructive interna
tional cooperation carried out dur
ing the short life-term of the
United Nations exceeds in scope
and quantity all that had gone
before.
The impressive and hopeful
character of this work is exempli
fied in a distinguished visitor
who spent some hours at Stan
ford last week. He is Mr. Maurice
Pate, who began his relief act
ivities many years ago with Her
bert Hoover, and who is presently
director of the United Nations In
ternational Childrens Emergency
Fund (UNICEF).
Today UNICEF is improving
the health and welfore of child
ren and expectant mothers in 100
countries. To do this it works

through the governments of these
countries. It obtains the collabor
ation of the World Health Organ
ization and other agencies.
And it spends each year $25
by governments, foundations, and
individuals.
Weathered Decade
In its 13th year, 1933, the
League of Nations was beginning
its first phase of disintegration
under the impact of destructive
nationalistic forces and a great
depression. Today, at the end of
its 13th year, the United Nations
has weathered a decade of Cold
War, of various and contentions
young nationalism, of spectacu
lar and dangerous technological
advance, and of shifting configur
ations of power. It shows no evi
dence of weakening or disinte
grating. On the contrary, no self
respecting Secretary of State or
Foreign Minister would miss the
opportunity to lead his nation's
delegation to the annual General
Assembly. He can't find any
where in the world a better ros
trum and as many of the men and
women to whom and about whom
he wants to talk.
Tho United Nations will be 13
years old Friday. It is about five
years younger than the average
member of the Stanford freshman
class. Yet within its brief life have
occurred some of the most sweep
ing and tumultuous changes of
the 20th century. These changes
have been accompanied by much
tension and some violence, as
nations great and small, young
and old, have contended for posi
tion, power territory, ideas, even
survival. The changes have been
revolutionary in effect. In 13
years they have produced an
essentially new order of things,
as we Americans realize when
we contemplate our tax bill.
The United Nations has suc
ceeded in growing up at the heart
of these changes. It has made
some gains in strength, although
not enough to satisfy all of its
critics. It has almost doubled its
membership. It has blunted some
of the conflicts growing out of
mid-century change, and eased
some of the adjustment. It has
made more peaceful the drive of
Asian, African, and some Western
Hemisphere peoples towards nat
ional independence of self-govern
ment. It has helped the less dev
eloped peoples of the world to
realize some of their rising ex
pectations.
Fails Function
Yet, thus far, it has failed in
some of its most important func
tions — for example, to bring
about the regulation of arma
ments and the control of nuclear
weapons.
Birthdays are appropriate occa
sions for stock-taking. Before we
judge the United Nations as it
enters its 14th year, however, we
would do well to remember what
it is and what it is not. It is not,
as some people mistakenly be
lieve, a superstate with power to
override its members. Such a
superstate has not proved politi
cally feasible in the middie of the
20th century, despite whatever
advantages it would offer in an
age nuclear warheads and moon
missiles. Nor does the United
Nations have about it some kind
of mystical quality that enables
it to pursue peace and well-being
except as this is willed by its
members, each of whom calcu
lates its will with one eye on its
own national interest.
81 Nations
The United Nations is really
an association of 81 nations. Mem
bership is voluntary, although it
is necessary to be voted into the
"club by two-thirds of the present
members, after having obtained
the unanimous approval of the
veto - wielding members of the

Security Council. Nations may
withdraw, although none have
since 19-15. Instead, there has been
a waiting list of applicants, many
of them new nations born since
194:5. The nations value member
ship because the advantages of
being "in the club" far outweigh
any disadvantags.
The United Nations, because it
is a voluntary association, can
not compel its members or other
states to do things. The Charter,
to be sure, provides that when one
or more states are actually threat
ening the peace, the Security
Council can require the members
to apply certain sanctions against
those states. These provisions
have never been put into effect,
however, and probably never will
be. Instead, the United Nations
will probably rely in the future
as in the past, upon voluntary
cooperation to get things done.
The most important purpose of
the United Nations is to maintain
peace and security. During the
past 13 years the organization has
been used to halt several small
but dangerous wars. UN pres
sures and sanctions have also
been applied to obtain the settle
ment of threatening disputes, or,
in the case of Korea, to repell ag
gression. For many reasons, not
least the heavy costs in blood and
gold of the Korean police action,
the use of so drastic a measure
will probably not be attempted
again soon, despite its history

and old, have contended for posi
tion, power territory, ideas, even
survival. The changes have been
revolutionary in effect. In 13
years they have produced an
essentially new order of things,
as we Americans realize when
we contemplate our tax bill.
The United Nations has suc
ceeded in growing up at the heart
of these changes. It has made
some gains in strength, although
not enough to satisfy all of its
critics. It has almost doubled its
membership. It has blunted some
of the conflicts growing out of
mid-century change, and eased
some of the adjustment. It has
made more peaceful the drive of
Asian, African, and some Western
Hemisphere peoples towards nat
ional independence of self-govern
ment. It has helped the less dev
eloped peoples of the world to
realize some of their rising ex
pectations.
Fails Function
Yet, thus far, it has failed in
some of its most important func
tions — for example, to bring
about the regulation of arma
ments and the control of nuclear
weapons.
Birthdays are appropriate occa
sions for stock-taking. Before we
judge the United Nations as it
enters its 14th year, however, we
would do well to remember what
it is and what it is not. It is not,
as some people mistakenly be
lieve, a superstate with power to
override its members. Such a
superstate has not proved politi
cally feasible in the middie of the
20th century, despite whatever
advantages it would offer in an
age nuclear warheads and moon
missiles. Nor does the United
Nations have about it some kind
of mystical quality that enables
it to pursue peace and well-being
except as this is willed by its
members, each of whom calcu
lates its will with one eye on its
own national interest.
81 Nations
The United Nations is really
an association of 81 nations. Mem
bership is voluntary, although it
is necessary to be voted into the
"club by two-thirds of the present
members, after having obtained
the unanimous approval of the
veto - wielding members of the

Security Council. Nations may
withdraw, although none have
since 19-15. Instead, there has been
a waiting list of applicants, many
of them new nations born since
194:5. The nations value member
ship because the advantages of
being "in the club" far outweigh
any disadvantags.
The United Nations, because it
is a voluntary association, can
not compel its members or other
states to do things. The Charter,
to be sure, provides that when one
or more states are actually threat
ening the peace, the Security
Council can require the members
to apply certain sanctions against
those states. These provisions
have never been put into effect,
however, and probably never will
be. Instead, the United Nations
will probably rely in the future
as in the past, upon voluntary
cooperation to get things done.
The most important purpose of
the United Nations is to maintain
peace and security. During the
past 13 years the organization has
been used to halt several small
but dangerous wars. UN pres
sures and sanctions have also
been applied to obtain the settle
ment of threatening disputes, or,
in the case of Korea, to repell ag
gression. For many reasons, not
least the heavy costs in blood and
gold of the Korean police action,
the use of so drastic a measure
will probably not be attempted
again soon, despite its history
making significance.
Peaceful Ways
Instead the United Nations will
probably be used in the future in
creasingly to help find peaceful
ways to settle conflicts, and to
provide means for releasing ten
sions.
In 13 years the Secretariat of
the United Nations together with
the men and women who repre
sent their own governments in
New York, have gained experi
ence and seasoning. The wiser of
them know that Constructive ad
justment and peace-building are
seldom advanced by flamboyant
debate and frantic vote-taking.
Rather, they are achieved by
quiet consultation and by skilled,
imaginative negotiation on the
part of men whose knowledge of
the issues and of the forces at
work is sound and full.
The second great purpose of
the United Nations is to reduce
the probabilities of conflict by
elevating standards of well-being
and education throughout the
world. When the Charter was
drawn, the founding nations as
sumed that frustrated aspirations
could produce conflict among in
dividuals and among states. The
task of improving well-being and
and helping to meet aspirations
was given both to the United

Nations itself and to a circle of
specialized agencies such as the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agriculture Organiza
tion, and UNESCO.
Exceeds Scope
It is not feasible within the com
pass of this article to summarize
what has been done during the
past 13 years to improve human
well-being on this planet. Perhaps
it is sufficient to say that the
amount of constructive interna
tional cooperation carried out dur
ing the short life-term of the
United Nations exceeds in scope
and quantity all that had gone
before.
The impressive and hopeful
character of this work is exempli
fied in a distinguished visitor
who spent some hours at Stan
ford last week. He is Mr. Maurice
Pate, who began his relief act
ivities many years ago with Her
bert Hoover, and who is presently
director of the United Nations In
ternational Childrens Emergency
Fund (UNICEF).
Today UNICEF is improving
the health and welfore of child
ren and expectant mothers in 100
countries. To do this it works

through the governments of these
countries. It obtains the collabor
ation of the World Health Organ
ization and other agencies.
And it spends each year $25
by governments, foundations, and
individuals.
Weathered Decade
In its 13th year, 1933, the
League of Nations was beginning
its first phase of disintegration
under the impact of destructive
nationalistic forces and a great
depression. Today, at the end of
its 13th year, the United Nations
has weathered a decade of Cold
War, of various and contentions
young nationalism, of spectacu
lar and dangerous technological
advance, and of shifting configur
ations of power. It shows no evi
dence of weakening or disinte
grating. On the contrary, no self
respecting Secretary of State or
Foreign Minister would miss the
opportunity to lead his nation's
delegation to the annual General
Assembly. He can't find any
where in the world a better ros
trum and as many of the men and
women to whom and about whom
he wants to talk.
Tho United Nations will be 13
years old Friday. It is about five
years younger than the average
member of the Stanford freshman
class. Yet within its brief life have
occurred some of the most sweep
ing and tumultuous changes of
the 20th century. These changes
have been accompanied by much
tension and some violence, as
nations great and small, young
and old, have contended for posi
tion, power territory, ideas, even

the United Nations together with
the men and women who repre
sent their own governments in
New York, have gained experi
ence and seasoning. The wiser of
them know that Constructive ad
justment and peace-building are
seldom advanced by flamboyant
debate and frantic vote-taking.
Rather, they are achieved by
quiet consultation and by skilled,
imaginative negotiation on the
part of men whose knowledge of
the issues and of the forces at
work is sound and full.
The second great purpose of
the United Nations is to reduce
the probabilities of conflict by
elevating standards of well-being
and education throughout the
world. When the Charter was
drawn, the founding nations as
sumed that frustrated aspirations
could produce conflict among in
dividuals and among states. The
task of improving well-being and
and helping to meet aspirations
was given both to the United

Nations itself and to a circle of
specialized agencies such as the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agriculture Organiza
tion, and UNESCO.
Exceeds Scope
It is not feasible within the com
pass of this article to summarize
what has been done during the
past 13 years to improve human
well-being on this planet. Perhaps
it is sufficient to say that the
amount of constructive interna
tional cooperation carried out dur
ing the short life-term of the
United Nations exceeds in scope
and quantity all that had gone
before.
The impressive and hopeful
character of this work is exempli
fied in a distinguished visitor
who spent some hours at Stan
ford last week. He is Mr. Maurice
Pate, who began his relief act
ivities many years ago with Her
bert Hoover, and who is presently
director of the United Nations In
ternational Childrens Emergency
Fund (UNICEF).
Today UNICEF is improving
the health and welfore of child
ren and expectant mothers in 100
countries. To do this it works

through the governments of these
countries. It obtains the collabor
ation of the World Health Organ
ization and other agencies.
And it spends each year $25
by governments, foundations, and
individuals.
Weathered Decade
In its 13th year, 1933, the
League of Nations was beginning
its first phase of disintegration
under the impact of destructive
nationalistic forces and a great
depression. Today, at the end of
its 13th year, the United Nations
has weathered a decade of Cold
War, of various and contentions
young nationalism, of spectacu
lar and dangerous technological
advance, and of shifting configur
ations of power. It shows no evi
dence of weakening or disinte
grating. On the contrary, no self
respecting Secretary of State or
Foreign Minister would miss the
opportunity to lead his nation's
delegation to the annual General
Assembly. He can't find any
where in the world a better ros
trum and as many of the men and
women to whom and about whom
he wants to talk.
Tho United Nations will be 13
years old Friday. It is about five
years younger than the average
member of the Stanford freshman
class. Yet within its brief life have
occurred some of the most sweep
ing and tumultuous changes of
the 20th century. These changes
have been accompanied by much
tension and some violence, as
nations great and small, young
and old, have contended for posi
tion, power territory, ideas, even
survival. The changes have been
revolutionary in effect. In 13
years they have produced an
essentially new order of things,
as we Americans realize when
we contemplate our tax bill.
The United Nations has suc
ceeded in growing up at the heart
of these changes. It has made
some gains in strength, although
not enough to satisfy all of its
critics. It has almost doubled its
membership. It has blunted some
of the conflicts growing out of
mid-century change, and eased
some of the adjustment. It has
made more peaceful the drive of
Asian, African, and some Western
Hemisphere peoples towards nat
ional independence of self-govern
ment. It has helped the less dev
eloped peoples of the world to
realize some of their rising ex
pectations.
Fails Function
Yet, thus far, it has failed in
some of its most important func
tions — for example, to bring
about the regulation of arma
ments and the control of nuclear
weapons.
Birthdays are appropriate occa
sions for stock-taking. Before we
judge the United Nations as it
enters its 14th year, however, we
would do well to remember what
it is and what it is not. It is not,
as some people mistakenly be
lieve, a superstate with power to
override its members. Such a
superstate has not proved politi
cally feasible in the middie of the
20th century, despite whatever
advantages it would offer in an
age nuclear warheads and moon
missiles. Nor does the United
Nations have about it some kind
of mystical quality that enables
it to pursue peace and well-being
except as this is willed by its
members, each of whom calcu
lates its will with one eye on its
own national interest.
81 Nations
The United Nations is really
an association of 81 nations. Mem
bership is voluntary, although it
is necessary to be voted into the
"club by two-thirds of the present
members, after having obtained
the unanimous approval of the
veto - wielding members of the

Security Council. Nations may
withdraw, although none have
since 19-15. Instead, there has been
a waiting list of applicants, many
of them new nations born since
194:5. The nations value member
ship because the advantages of
being "in the club" far outweigh
any disadvantags.
The United Nations, because it
is a voluntary association, can
not compel its members or other
states to do things. The Charter,
to be sure, provides that when one
or more states are actually threat
ening the peace, the Security
Council can require the members
to apply certain sanctions against
those states. These provisions
have never been put into effect,
however, and probably never will
be. Instead, the United Nations
will probably rely in the future
as in the past, upon voluntary
cooperation to get things done.
The most important purpose of
the United Nations is to maintain
peace and security. During the
past 13 years the organization has
been used to halt several small
but dangerous wars. UN pres
sures and sanctions have also
been applied to obtain the settle
ment of threatening disputes, or,
in the case of Korea, to repell ag
gression. For many reasons, not
least the heavy costs in blood and
gold of the Korean police action,
the use of so drastic a measure
will probably not be attempted
again soon, despite its history
making significance.
Peaceful Ways
Instead the United Nations will
probably be used in the future in
creasingly to help find peaceful
ways to settle conflicts, and to
provide means for releasing ten
sions.
