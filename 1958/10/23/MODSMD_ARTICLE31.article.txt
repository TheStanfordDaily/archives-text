# PCC STATS
## Washington Stale Leads Total Offense Scramble 
### 
Washington State has regained
the leadership in total Pacific
Coast Conference offense accord
ing to statistics released by the
PCC commissioner's office.
The Cougars have an average
of 335 yards gained which puts
them less than 15 yards in front
of league-leading California. Last
week's leader. Oregon, has drop
ped to the third spot with an aver
age of 305 yards.
California leads in total yards
gained rushing with 240 yards
and the Cougars with 106 yards
are in the fifth spot. However,
thanks to the passing of Bobby
Newman, the Washington State
eleven is far enough ahead in the
passing department to take the
total offense leadership. The Cou
gars have an average of 168 yards
gained passing with the Bruins of
UCLA in the second spot with
146 yards. Cal is down in the fifth
spot averaging just over 100
yards per game.
Stanford finds itself in the un
enviable position of second from
the bottom in the total offense
spot with a 219-yard average
which puts the Indians just above
cellar-dwelling Idaho.
The Cards are sevenlh in total
rushing with an average of 106
yards per game, but pick up some
ground in the passing statistics
with a 112-yards-per-game aver
age, good for third place in the
conference standings.
Leader in the defensive depart
ment is Oregon, having allowed

their opponents 191 yards per
game. Second is that Washington
State team again, having allowed
211 yards. Stanford is second
| from the bottom here too, having
1 allowed 367 yards per game,
! which is enough to nose out Cal
i which is rock bottom defensively,
having allowed 390 yards per
game. The Bears are tailenders
in both passing and rushing de
fense.
UCLA leads the PCC in pass in
terceptions as the Bruins have
snagged no less than 11 confer
ence opponents' passes, returning
