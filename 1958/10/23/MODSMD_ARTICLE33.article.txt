LOS ANGELES â€” Compli
mentary fingers were pointed
yesterday toward quarterback Joe
Kapp of California and sopho
more end Marlin McKeever of
Southern California as candidates
for All-America consideration.
Local critics, after watching the
versatile Kapp perform and win
over USC last Saturday, were
convinced the 202-pound senior
from nearby Newhall is a one
man show.
McKeever, twin brother of Tro
jan Mike McKeever at right
guard, has reaped praise in every
game this season.
Evaluations were made by
members of the Associated Press
regional board which screens All-
America hopefuls.
Said Sid Ziff, sports editor of
the Los Angeles Mirror-News:
"I think Marlin McKeever is an
absolute standout. I don't agree
in every way with Don Clark, the
Trojan coach, but I certainly
agree when he says Marlin is the
best end in the nation.
"As for Joe Kapp, he is the
California team. Where would
California be without him? They
would be nowhere."
McKeever has caught four
passes for 73 yards and one touch
down.
