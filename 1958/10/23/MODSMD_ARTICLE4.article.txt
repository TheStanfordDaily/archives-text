TAIPEI, Fomosa (/P) â€”Secretary of State Dulles and President
Chiang Kai-shek agreed Wednesday night that their countries must
stand together against Communist China.
An exchange of toasts at a state dinner cleared the way for a new
statement of solidarity expected after their Thursday wind-up con-

ference on the Formosa crisis.
The second day brought a
warning from Dulles that U.S.
warships may return to escort
duty on the supply run to Que
moy because of renewed Commu

nist shelling.
Throughout the day mainland
Red gunners and Nationalists on
Quemoy Island engaged in a
fierce artillery duel, but the firing
dropped off at nightfall.
Chiang said a Red China cam
paign to divide the two allies
"makes it of paramount impor
tance to reaffirm our joint stand
of solidarity and resoluteness vis
a-vis the enemy."
The Nationalist information of
fice quoted Dulles as replying
that the downfall of Red China
depends on the free world's deter
mination, courage and dedication.
The information bureau said
Dulles also had reaffirmed as his
"real conviction" a statement at
San Francisco last year that
Communist rule in mainland
China is a passing phase and
Americans "should contribute to
that passing."
