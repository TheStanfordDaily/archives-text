# Chiang Agrees To Cut Forces
## 
### 
TAIPEI (/P) -Chiang Kai-shek ruled out force Thursday as the
main means of returning to (he China mainland and reportedly
agreed to trim his offshore garrisons slightly.
Chiang's renunciation of force was announced in a communique
at the windup of three days of talks with Secretary of State Dulles.

A competent authority said this
was the plan:
The Nationalist offshore garri
sons would be cut by 15,000 to 20.-
000 from the 100,000 reported as
there now. Thewe garrisons then
would be streamlined with mod
ern weapons for defense.
No time for the start of troop
cuts was set. It would depend
partly on whether the Commu
nis Is relieved pressure on the
islands. It would be scheduled so
as to give no appearance of yield
ing to Rod threats and would be
coordinated with the arrival of
modern weapons.
U.S. Commitment
The communique went a step
closer to a U.S. commitment to
defend the offshore islands.
It said the United States and
the Nationalist regime "recognize
that under' present conditions the
defense of the Quemoys together
with the Matsus is closely related
to the defense of Taiwan | For
mosa | and Penghu, the Pescadore
islands in Formosa Strait."
It added that the Chinese Com
munists and the Russians "cannot
possibly succeed" in trying to con
quer Formosa, eliminate National
ist China and expel the United
States from the western Pacific.
"No Force"
It added also that the principal
ways to recover the mainland are
through nationalism, democracy
and social well-being, "not the use
of force." The communique cited
those methods as the three peo
ple's principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
founder' of the Republic of China.
It was understood that Dulles
considered this statement ex
tremely important in removing
fears in the West that the Na
tionalists are bent on war.
The United States, since 1955,
ha-s been trying to get the Chinese
Communists to renounce the use
of force in Formosa Strait. A
Communist refusal ( to do so re
suited in a breakup of U.S.-Red
China talks in Geneva almost a
year ago.
It has been reported that the
United States is seeking this again

in negotiations in Warsaw be
tween U.S. Ambassador Jacob
Beam and Red China's Wang
Ping-nan.
On Quemoy, meanwhile. Red
gunfire slackened considerably
after heavy barrages Wednesday
night.

at the windup of three days of talks with Secretary of State Dulles.

A competent authority said this
was the plan:
The Nationalist offshore garri
sons would be cut by 15,000 to 20.-
000 from the 100,000 reported as
there now. Thewe garrisons then
would be streamlined with mod
ern weapons for defense.
No time for the start of troop
cuts was set. It would depend
partly on whether the Commu
nis Is relieved pressure on the
islands. It would be scheduled so
as to give no appearance of yield
ing to Rod threats and would be
coordinated with the arrival of
modern weapons.
U.S. Commitment
The communique went a step
closer to a U.S. commitment to
defend the offshore islands.
It said the United States and
the Nationalist regime "recognize
that under' present conditions the
defense of the Quemoys together
with the Matsus is closely related
to the defense of Taiwan | For
mosa | and Penghu, the Pescadore
islands in Formosa Strait."
It added that the Chinese Com
munists and the Russians "cannot
possibly succeed" in trying to con
quer Formosa, eliminate National
ist China and expel the United
States from the western Pacific.
"No Force"
It added also that the principal
ways to recover the mainland are
through nationalism, democracy
and social well-being, "not the use
of force." The communique cited
those methods as the three peo
ple's principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
founder' of the Republic of China.
It was understood that Dulles
considered this statement ex
tremely important in removing
fears in the West that the Na
tionalists are bent on war.
The United States, since 1955,
ha-s been trying to get the Chinese
Communists to renounce the use
of force in Formosa Strait. A
Communist refusal ( to do so re
suited in a breakup of U.S.-Red
China talks in Geneva almost a
year ago.
It has been reported that the
United States is seeking this again

in negotiations in Warsaw be
tween U.S. Ambassador Jacob
Beam and Red China's Wang
Ping-nan.
