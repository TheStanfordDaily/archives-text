The day's events include an all-campus dance from 8 to 11 in Din

the International Center, and a UN I'lag-rai.sing ceremony in front

of the Main Library.
Officiating at. tho flagâ€¢ raising
ceremony will he the Stanford
ROTC. The UN flag will be raised
in the morning.
After a week of many discus
sions. religious programs and lec
tures about the United Nations, it
was hoped students will under
stand more fully the work and
purpose of the IIR on campus and
will take advantage of the oppor
tunities it provides to deal with
international affairs. 11 R pro
grams are open to all students.
The dance tonight will provide
an excellent chance to get ac
quainted with Stanford foreign
students and others interested in
international relations. "Under the
trees and beneath the stars," the
music will be provided by high
fidelity records, and the dress is
informal. The"I" Club will serve
coffee at 5 cents a cup in the In
ternational Center, across the
street.
The"I" Club coffee hour is open
to all interested students, and a

faculty member will direct a
short, informal discussion on the
United Nations. This will be the
last of the many panels that have
been presented in the various liv
ing groups this week.
Students attending the UCLA-
Stanford game at Los Angeles on
Saturday will see UN card stunts
and band formations performed
by UCLA at the request of Stan
ford lIR officers.
