# Transfer Credit, Applications Due
## 
### 
Today is the last clay for filing
petitions for an evaluation of
transfer credit during autumn
quarter. Forms are available at
the information desk, Registrar's
Office, Room 111-A, Inner Quad.
Petitions of old returning stu
dents are being processed by the
Registrar's Office. New students
need not petition, however. Any
one who has had the equivalent
of a Stanford course while in the
service may petition.
