# Tribe Hopes to De-Claw Bruins in Coliseum Clash
## Uclan Seniors To Miss Game 
### Bob Payne 
Thirty-seven hopeful Indians
and many of their followers take
off on their annual Southland sor
tie today ... to meet (he also
hopeful UCLA Bruins in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
It's PCC play the rest of Ihe
way for the Tribe, and they're not
forgetting that they're definitely
not out of the race.
The Indians' conference and/or
Rose Bowl hopes seem dimmed by
four lopsided losses, but only one
of them was a loop game, and two
weeks ago the Tribe looked like
real contenders in t r o unci 11 k
Washington. They hope to regain
that form this week.
Statistically, the Cards are still
in it -and trail, in fact., only Cali
fornia. Nobody is out of the Pasa
dena race, except ineligibles Ore
gon and UCLA, but more than
one loss makes it an uphill climb.
The Indians will have to do it
without their big gun in the Wash
ington conquest - halfback Rick
McMillen. McMillen's ankle in
jury suffered against the Air
Force looked successively bad,
then good, then bad again, and
now the junior ace has the ankle
in a cast and will be out for at
least a week.
Dick Bowers, who had nosed
out McMillen for starting duties
against Northwestern, returns to
the lineup this week, and things
don't look as bad as they might.
Bowers or Skip Face is expected

to get the starting call, with Jim
Byrer and John Bessey around for
insurance.
The Bruins must be tabbed as
pretty much an unknown quan
tity, as five of last week's starters
are all through for the season.
Seniors suffering from penalties
handed down by the Pacific Coast
Conference are Don Long, Dick
Wallen, Bill Leeka, Clint Whit
field and Dick Butler, all starters,
and injured blocking back Steve
Gertsman.
Chuck Kendall, an experienced
senior now recovering from a knee
injury, is the new Bruin tailback,
replacing Long. Kendall is a fine
runner—he paced UCLA ground
gainers last year—but the absence
of Long will take away a great
deal of the passing threat.
Former national punting king
Kirk Wilson backs Kendall. Doubt
ful at the position is sophomore
flash Bill Kilmer.
