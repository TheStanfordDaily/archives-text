# Tribe Hopes to De-Claw Bruins in Coliseum Clash
## Uclan Seniors To Miss Game 
### Bob Payne 
Thirty-seven hopeful Indians
and many of their followers take
off on their annual Southland sor
tie today ... to meet (he also
hopeful UCLA Bruins in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
It's PCC play the rest of Ihe
way for the Tribe, and they're not
forgetting that they're definitely
not out of the race.
The Indians' conference and/or
Rose Bowl hopes seem dimmed by
four lopsided losses, but only one
of them was a loop game, and two
weeks ago the Tribe looked like
real contenders in t r o unci 11 k
Washington. They hope to regain
that form this week.
Statistically, the Cards are still
in it -and trail, in fact., only Cali
fornia. Nobody is out of the Pasa
dena race, except ineligibles Ore
gon and UCLA, but more than
one loss makes it an uphill climb.
The Indians will have to do it
without their big gun in the Wash
ington conquest - halfback Rick
McMillen. McMillen's ankle in
jury suffered against the Air
Force looked successively bad,
then good, then bad again, and
now the junior ace has the ankle
in a cast and will be out for at
least a week.
Dick Bowers, who had nosed
out McMillen for starting duties
against Northwestern, returns to
the lineup this week, and things
don't look as bad as they might.
Bowers or Skip Face is expected

to get the starting call, with Jim
Byrer and John Bessey around for
insurance.
The Bruins must be tabbed as
pretty much an unknown quan
tity, as five of last week's starters
are all through for the season.
Seniors suffering from penalties
handed down by the Pacific Coast
Conference are Don Long, Dick
Wallen, Bill Leeka, Clint Whit
field and Dick Butler, all starters,
and injured blocking back Steve
Gertsman.
Chuck Kendall, an experienced
senior now recovering from a knee
injury, is the new Bruin tailback,
replacing Long. Kendall is a fine
runner—he paced UCLA ground
gainers last year—but the absence
of Long will take away a great
deal of the passing threat.
Former national punting king
Kirk Wilson backs Kendall. Doubt
ful at the position is sophomore
flash Bill Kilmer.

233-11). veteran will bolster Card line
Junior veteran Ray Smith, a
hard-working linebuster, is the
Bruin fullback. Holding down the
wingback post will be sophomore
Marv Luster, a pleasant surprise

in coach Bill Barnes' attack while
filling in for injured Phil Parslow.
Veterans Jim Steffen and John
Brown will be starting Bruin
wingmen. Brown replaces All-

American Dick Wallen, but the
change may not be too drastic, as
Brown is an excellent pass-receiv
er. Paul Oglesby and Jim Wallace
man the tackles, Bob King and
Joe Harper are probable guard
starters and sophomore Harry
Baldwin is the new center.
Stanford's lineup will remain
unchanged except for the shift
made necessary by injuries. Bob
Nicolct and Dick Norman provide
the Coast's best one-two punch at
quarterback. Norman ranks third
in PCC passing and Nicolet is
fourth.
Norman Good Against WSC
Both have had their big days
this year. Norman opened impres
sively with a fine show against
Washington State and an impres
sive 17-for-24 performance against
Rice.
Nicolet's field day came as he
directed the triumph over Wash
ington, and he will probably get
the starting call tomorrow.
The Cards hope to length their
brief win-string in the Coliseum.
And they'll even settle for some
thing not quite as emphatic as
last season. Then they ran USC
off the field to the tune of 35-7;
they also topped UCLA at home,
20-6, to make it. a clean sweep over
the Southland prodigals.
But the last L.A. clash with
UCLA wasn't quite as happy an
occasion. The fired-up Bruins
rushed the John Brodie-led In
dians off their feet in one quarter
and made two gift touchdowns
stand up the rest of the way for a
14-13 win.
Maybe the Tribe will be. the
fired-up bunch this year. One
thing is sure: the Bruins won't be
playing dead before Stanford.
L.A. Press Sour Grapes
The only hope is that the Stan
ford invasion isn't greeted with
the same brainwashed - propa
ganda barrage dealt out by the
L.A. press on the last UCLA jun
ket. ". . . And Stanford's the rea
son that UCLA can't play at full
strength today," it said. But the
Southland scribes forgot that
Stanford has only one vote.
This will be the Tribe's last
chance at the Baby Blue inside
the Pacific Coast Conference. So
long as the Bruins are crying,
give them something to cry about!

Junior veteran Ray Smith, a
hard-working linebuster, is the
Bruin fullback. Holding down the
wingback post will be sophomore
Marv Luster, a pleasant surprise

in coach Bill Barnes' attack while
filling in for injured Phil Parslow.
Veterans Jim Steffen and John
Brown will be starting Bruin
wingmen. Brown replaces All-

American Dick Wallen, but the
change may not be too drastic, as
Brown is an excellent pass-receiv
er. Paul Oglesby and Jim Wallace
man the tackles, Bob King and
Joe Harper are probable guard
starters and sophomore Harry
Baldwin is the new center.
Stanford's lineup will remain
unchanged except for the shift
made necessary by injuries. Bob
Nicolct and Dick Norman provide
the Coast's best one-two punch at
quarterback. Norman ranks third
in PCC passing and Nicolet is
fourth.
Norman Good Against WSC
Both have had their big days
this year. Norman opened impres
sively with a fine show against
Washington State and an impres
sive 17-for-24 performance against
Rice.
Nicolet's field day came as he
directed the triumph over Wash
ington, and he will probably get
the starting call tomorrow.
The Cards hope to length their
brief win-string in the Coliseum.
And they'll even settle for some
thing not quite as emphatic as
last season. Then they ran USC
off the field to the tune of 35-7;
they also topped UCLA at home,
20-6, to make it. a clean sweep over
the Southland prodigals.
But the last L.A. clash with
UCLA wasn't quite as happy an
occasion. The fired-up Bruins
rushed the John Brodie-led In
dians off their feet in one quarter
and made two gift touchdowns
stand up the rest of the way for a
14-13 win.
Maybe the Tribe will be. the
fired-up bunch this year. One
thing is sure: the Bruins won't be
playing dead before Stanford.
L.A. Press Sour Grapes
The only hope is that the Stan
ford invasion isn't greeted with
the same brainwashed - propa
ganda barrage dealt out by the
L.A. press on the last UCLA jun
ket. ". . . And Stanford's the rea
son that UCLA can't play at full
strength today," it said. But the
Southland scribes forgot that
Stanford has only one vote.
This will be the Tribe's last
chance at the Baby Blue inside
the Pacific Coast Conference. So
long as the Bruins are crying,
give them something to cry about!
Thirty-seven hopeful Indians
and many of their followers take
off on their annual Southland sor
tie today ... to meet (he also
hopeful UCLA Bruins in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
It's PCC play the rest of Ihe
way for the Tribe, and they're not
forgetting that they're definitely
not out of the race.
The Indians' conference and/or
Rose Bowl hopes seem dimmed by
four lopsided losses, but only one
of them was a loop game, and two
weeks ago the Tribe looked like
real contenders in t r o unci 11 k
Washington. They hope to regain
that form this week.
Statistically, the Cards are still
in it -and trail, in fact., only Cali
fornia. Nobody is out of the Pasa
dena race, except ineligibles Ore
gon and UCLA, but more than
one loss makes it an uphill climb.
The Indians will have to do it
without their big gun in the Wash
ington conquest - halfback Rick
McMillen. McMillen's ankle in
jury suffered against the Air
Force looked successively bad,
then good, then bad again, and
now the junior ace has the ankle
in a cast and will be out for at
least a week.
Dick Bowers, who had nosed
out McMillen for starting duties
against Northwestern, returns to
the lineup this week, and things
don't look as bad as they might.
Bowers or Skip Face is expected

to get the starting call, with Jim
Byrer and John Bessey around for
insurance.
The Bruins must be tabbed as
pretty much an unknown quan
tity, as five of last week's starters
are all through for the season.
Seniors suffering from penalties
handed down by the Pacific Coast

thing not quite as emphatic as
last season. Then they ran USC
off the field to the tune of 35-7;
they also topped UCLA at home,
20-6, to make it. a clean sweep over
the Southland prodigals.
But the last L.A. clash with
UCLA wasn't quite as happy an
occasion. The fired-up Bruins
rushed the John Brodie-led In
dians off their feet in one quarter
and made two gift touchdowns
stand up the rest of the way for a
14-13 win.
Maybe the Tribe will be. the
fired-up bunch this year. One
thing is sure: the Bruins won't be
playing dead before Stanford.
L.A. Press Sour Grapes
The only hope is that the Stan
ford invasion isn't greeted with
the same brainwashed - propa
ganda barrage dealt out by the
L.A. press on the last UCLA jun
ket. ". . . And Stanford's the rea
son that UCLA can't play at full
strength today," it said. But the
Southland scribes forgot that
Stanford has only one vote.
This will be the Tribe's last
chance at the Baby Blue inside
the Pacific Coast Conference. So
long as the Bruins are crying,
give them something to cry about!
Thirty-seven hopeful Indians
and many of their followers take
off on their annual Southland sor
tie today ... to meet (he also
hopeful UCLA Bruins in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
It's PCC play the rest of Ihe
way for the Tribe, and they're not
forgetting that they're definitely
not out of the race.
The Indians' conference and/or
Rose Bowl hopes seem dimmed by
four lopsided losses, but only one
of them was a loop game, and two
weeks ago the Tribe looked like
real contenders in t r o unci 11 k
Washington. They hope to regain
that form this week.
Statistically, the Cards are still
in it -and trail, in fact., only Cali
fornia. Nobody is out of the Pasa
dena race, except ineligibles Ore
gon and UCLA, but more than
one loss makes it an uphill climb.
The Indians will have to do it
without their big gun in the Wash
ington conquest - halfback Rick
McMillen. McMillen's ankle in
jury suffered against the Air
Force looked successively bad,
then good, then bad again, and
now the junior ace has the ankle
in a cast and will be out for at
least a week.
Dick Bowers, who had nosed
out McMillen for starting duties
against Northwestern, returns to
the lineup this week, and things
don't look as bad as they might.
Bowers or Skip Face is expected

to get the starting call, with Jim
Byrer and John Bessey around for
insurance.
The Bruins must be tabbed as
pretty much an unknown quan
tity, as five of last week's starters
are all through for the season.
Seniors suffering from penalties
handed down by the Pacific Coast
Conference are Don Long, Dick
Wallen, Bill Leeka, Clint Whit
field and Dick Butler, all starters,
and injured blocking back Steve
Gertsman.
Chuck Kendall, an experienced
senior now recovering from a knee
injury, is the new Bruin tailback,
replacing Long. Kendall is a fine
runner—he paced UCLA ground
gainers last year—but the absence
of Long will take away a great
deal of the passing threat.
Former national punting king
Kirk Wilson backs Kendall. Doubt
ful at the position is sophomore
flash Bill Kilmer.

Junior veteran Ray Smith, a
hard-working linebuster, is the
Bruin fullback. Holding down the
wingback post will be sophomore
Marv Luster, a pleasant surprise

in coach Bill Barnes' attack while
filling in for injured Phil Parslow.
Veterans Jim Steffen and John
Brown will be starting Bruin
wingmen. Brown replaces All-

American Dick Wallen, but the
change may not be too drastic, as
Brown is an excellent pass-receiv
er. Paul Oglesby and Jim Wallace
man the tackles, Bob King and
Joe Harper are probable guard
starters and sophomore Harry
Baldwin is the new center.
Stanford's lineup will remain
unchanged except for the shift
made necessary by injuries. Bob
Nicolct and Dick Norman provide
the Coast's best one-two punch at
quarterback. Norman ranks third
in PCC passing and Nicolet is
fourth.
Norman Good Against WSC
Both have had their big days
this year. Norman opened impres
sively with a fine show against
Washington State and an impres
sive 17-for-24 performance against
Rice.
Nicolet's field day came as he
directed the triumph over Wash
ington, and he will probably get
the starting call tomorrow.
