# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Crowded Ballots Undergo Review 
### Leo Krulitz 
With not much more than a
week left before Election Day, a
brief look at the state-wide candi
dates that will appear on a crowd
ed ballot is probably in order.
Democratic candidates for the
state offices have been irying to
cling to the coattails of Edmund
(Pat) Brown, stressing the idea
that he can't run the state alone,
and Republicans this year for Ihe
most part have been conducting
I heir own campaigns, running on
their records.
Republican incumbent Harold
J. Powers faces Glenn M. An
derson, a past State Assembly
man, for the Lieutenant Gov
ernor's post.
Elected as Lieutenant Governor
in 1954 by a plurality of 400,000
votes, Powers served before that
for five terms in the State Sen
ile. He has said, "Nobody's en
dorsing me that I know of and
I'm running independently."
Anderson in the combined votes
of the June 3 primary led Powers
by about 100,000 votes. Anderson
has been chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee,
and while in the Assembly intro
duced a bill to abolish segrega
tion in California schools.
D e m o c rats have selected
Henry Lopez to oppose the Re
publican incumbent, Frank M.
Jordan, for the California Sec
retary of State.
Jordan has served as Secretary
of State since 1942 and his father
held the office before him for 23
years. Jordan was the only Re
publican to lead his opponent in
ihe primary, but Lopez didn't
cross-file and still won 46 per cent
of the vote.
Lopez is a graduate of the Har
vard Law School and a Phi Beta
Kappa. He is prominent in Mexi
can - Americans and has worked
with many minority groups. Lo
pez is critical of the California
election process and promises
many modernizing changes. The
Secretary of State is responsible
for the state's elections.
Robert Kirkwood, a Stanford
I.aw School graduate and Re
publican incumbent Controller,

faces Democrat Alan Cranston,
past president of the California
Democratic Council.
After serving in the State As
sembly for six years, Kirkwood
was appointed Controller by Gov
ernor Earl Warren in 1952 and
was elected to the office in 1954.
Cranston, a native Palo Altan,
is a businessman and investment
broker. During World War II he
was chief of the Foreign Lan
guage Division for the Office of
War Information. The Control
ler's office has been Republican
for 68 years. Cranston led Kirk
wood in the primaries by about
15,000 votes.
Opposing candidates for
State Treasurer are A. Ronald
Button, Republican incumbent,
and Bert Betts, Democrat.
Button was appointed to the of
fice by Governor Knight and this
is the first time he has run for
election. He is a Stanford gradu
ate, a lawyer and a past Republi
can N'ational Committeeman.
Betts, a certified public ac
countant, is making his first po
litical race, also. He has served
on the State Governmental Ac
counting Committee and was a
pilot in World War 11. Betts' plu
rality over Button in the June pri
mary was nearly 120,000 votes.
Both Republicans and Demo
crats had races for the nomina
tion for Attorney General â€”the
office Pat Brown is vacating.
Republicans chose Patrick J.
Hillings and the Democrats
picked Judge Stanley Mosk.
Hillings holds a law degree
from USC and has served in Con
gress for three terms. He was a
member of the Judiciary Commit
tee.
Judge Mosk has served on the
Superior Court and was first ap
pointed to the bench in 1942. He
has also served as Executive Sec
retary to a former California
Governor and was a member of
the Board of Regents of the Uni
versity of California.
