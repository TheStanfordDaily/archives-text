## Ear Today .... 
### Marilyn Moore 
Everyone seems to be visiting
the Van Gogh exhibit at the De
Young Museum now. I wonder
how many people know thai Van
Gogh's ear is on display at Wash
ington State College or so the
sign says.
Under a "flimsy cellophane box
with a wrinkled thing that looks
like a dried-out steak'' is a card
reading, "This is the original ear
which Vincent Van Gogh cut off
and sent to his mistress, a French
prostitute. 24 December, 1888."
Before you get too excited, the
exhibit is presumed to be some
medical student playing a practi
cal joke—or maybe a fraternity
prank. As the Daily Evergreen
says, "So if you see a pledge
walking around with an ear fresh
ly chopped off . . . well . . . you
know what they say—'Ear today,
gone tomorrow!'"
A griping contest is taking*
place at the U. of Kansas. The
occasion is the annual Campus
Problems Speaking Contest,
and opinions are expected on
anything from parking to white
shirt seating problems. All in
favor of beginning such a cus
tom on a corner of Quad or for
turning Union Court into a
Hyde Park, gather 'round and
bring your soapboxes.
"Luxurious" is a mild word to
describe the new bookstore at the
U. of Cincinnati. The two-floor
building has doors operated by
hydraulic pressure (no hands
needed), indirect lighting, Mada
gascar coral columns and a ceil
ing that, when dirty, is rolled up
and sent to the cleaners!
From the Oregon Daily Emer
ald we learn some news about our
(at least it's more "ours" than
Oregon's!) hungry i.the night
club in the city which has fea
tured the Kingston Trio, Tom
Lehrer, the Gateway Singers, etc.,
in recent months. Anyway, it
seems that Mort Sahl, the "young
split-tongued Plato" who is main-

I ly responsible for putting this bis
tro on the map, has just had a
nervous breakdown following his
recording of "The Future Lies
Ahead." Listen at your own risk!
Here's a new one —six weeks
spent cruising the South Seas
plus a maximum of six gradu
ate credits in one of five courses
will be offered to students next
summer by IJSC and the Cali
fornia Teachers Association.
Students may earn SC credits
while aboard the .Matson liner
SS Mariposa; ports of call in
clude Tahiti, New Zealand, Aus
tralia, Fiji, Samoa and Hawaii.
"Yours is the most unusual and
most thoughtful request I have
ever had in all my so-called offi
cial life," write Bess Truman to
the Campus Club at the U. of
Minnesota in answer to a letter
asking about her husband's favor
ite foods. Seems Harry S. was go
ing to lunch on the campus, and
the group wanted to be sure he
didn't go away with a bad taste
in his mouth.
The changing of "Hell Week"
to "Help Week" idea is spreading
fast. The Colorado Daily reports.
"At the Inter-fraternity Council
Workshop last week, leaders of
21 attending fraternities unani
mously resolved to change frater
nity 'hell - weeks' and revamp
pledge training programs to bet
ter 'build men.' Fraternity rep
resentatives attending the Estes
Park conference last Tuesday re
solved 'to use pledge training
programs to build men,' the IFC
president stated." Things are
really looking up all over. Espe
cially for frosh men.
"Sixteen Women Operate
Houses" read the headline of the
Oregon State Barometer. But
after reading the story all doubts
were dispelled. The 16 women
are working in home manage
ment houses. Bet that headline
really had some parents wonder
ing!

Everyone seems to be visiting
the Van Gogh exhibit at the De

how many people know thai Van
Gogh's ear is on display at Wash
ington State College or so the
sign says.
Under a "flimsy cellophane box
with a wrinkled thing that looks
like a dried-out steak'' is a card
reading, "This is the original ear
which Vincent Van Gogh cut off
and sent to his mistress, a French
prostitute. 24 December, 1888."
Before you get too excited, the
exhibit is presumed to be some
medical student playing a practi
cal joke—or maybe a fraternity
prank. As the Daily Evergreen
says, "So if you see a pledge
walking around with an ear fresh
ly chopped off . . . well . . . you
know what they say—'Ear today,
