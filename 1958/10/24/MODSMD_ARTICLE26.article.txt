During United Nations Week
1958 it is only fitting that thinking
people everywhere should re • ex
amine the United Nations—what
it has done, what it is doing and
what it can do.
The attempt here is to look at
the United Nations' role in world
politics, omitting the very real and
important role played by the UN
and its agencies in such fields as
human welfare, economic recov
ery and technical assistance.
It is only with the recent crises
in Suez, Hungary and the Middle
East that the United Nations has
assumed a place of more than sec
ondary or tertiary importance in
its members' foreign policy for
mulation.
The consequences of thermo
nuclear warfare and the effective
ness of regional and global bal
ances of power are the determin
ing factors in the member nations'
search for world peace. This is
true since the Security Council has
never been capable of dealing with
major East - West disagreements,
and the General Assembly—even

with the "Uniting for Peace" ma
chinery—can only recommend ac
tion.
Stalemated by the very poten
tiality of their ultimate power of
destruction, the Great Powers
have not been able, either bilat
erally or through the United Na
tions, to solve the great prob
lems of the Cold War.
Why, then, is the United Nations
growing in importance as a tool in
foreign policy making? It is pre
cisely because of this stalemate
that another phenomenon, perhaps
the unique political development
of the century the burgeoning of
nationalistic fervor all around the
globe and the emergence of new
countries, particularly in Africa
and Asia—has had such an impact
on the foieign relations of the
Great Powers.
Whether to win the minds of
men, obtain or retain economic ac
cess and/or strategic advantages,
or for purely humanitarian rea
sons, the newly emerging nations
have now become the scene for
East-West competition.
One has only to look at the
issues due to come before the 13th
General Assembly to see the great
importance of this new political
force. Algeria, Cyprus, Suez and
the many-sided question of the
Middle East are all expected to be
sehduled.
How successfully the prob
lems will be resolved remains to
be seen, but the important point

is t hut past experience would
tend to indicate that there is at
least a possibility of sueeess, /I
The rapid clearing of the Suez ■
Canal can be offered as proof of
one recent I N accomplishment.
'J'he United Nations seems par-1
tieularly adapted to handling the
seemingly infinite problems and i
disputes accompanying the some-1
times violent, never completely)
smooth transition to sovereignty.!
The UN makes possible personal i
diplomacy between ministers,
where the complexities of prob
lems arising from differing ideo
logical and economic interests, I
questions of prestige, and histori
cal rivalries or dominations can be
appreciated.
The United Nations can also be
used to make state policy more
flexible by providing policy mak
ers the opportunity of claiming
that a modification of policy is
necessary because it is in the gen
eral interest. The growing impor
tance of the UN secretary general,
as seen in the Middle East crises,
and the use of emergency forces,
patrols or supervisory bodies have
proved useful in maintaining
peace.
The most important function
of the United Nations is that it
provides a place where states- !
men of the newly emerging na
tions can learn the facts of in- j
ternational life, the most impor
tant of which is the practical
meaning of international law.
International law is itself evolv
ing, but this is no excuse for
abuse— or. more often, complete
disregard—of it in the name of
some end (such as self-determina-1
tion or the overthrow of Western j
imperialism) which supposedly j
justifies the means used to ob
tain it.
Only by working together in the
atmosphere of the United Nations
will the new nations of the world
learn the great responsibilities
which come with belonging to the
family of nations. It is only in the
UN that the West can gain an un
derstanding of these new nations
and their motivating forces.
