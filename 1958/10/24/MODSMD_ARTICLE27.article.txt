# Lippmann on Tour
## 
### 
Followers of Walter Lippmann will note that Lippmann's col
umn is missing from today's Daily. The reason? The columnist
is now spending a month in the Soviet Union. When he returns,
we are sure his column will be even more enlightening as to the
world situation.
Monday, readers turning to page two of The Daily will find a
change in format. Since, for year s, readers have been used to see
ing a three-column Herblock -editorial cartoon, we wish to inform
them in advance that their eyes won't be deceiving them, but that
Herblock will be only two columns wide. The numerous columns
and features which we feel are enlightening and educational for
readers of The Daily have prompted this change in cartoon size,
so that we may have more room for these articles.
