# ‘Booth' Slated At Alcazar
## 
### 
The Playwrights Company will
present Jose Ferrer in "Edwin
Booth" at the Alcazar Theatre, 2GO
O'Farrell St.. San Francisco, Oct.
27 through Nov. 15.
Edwin Booth, although acclaim
ed as the foremost actor of his day.
led a very tragic and unhappy life.
He became somewhat eccentric—
and the assassination of Abraham
Lincoln by his brother, John
Wilkes Booth, did not help matters
much.
The role of Edwin Booth will be
played by Ferrer, whose last
Broadway venture was producer
director-star of Joseph Kramm's
"The Shrike," which won the Pulit
zer prize in 1952.
