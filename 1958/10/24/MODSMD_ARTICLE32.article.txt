# Women's Housing: Complex History

### Rita Robison Associate Editor 
(Editor's Note: The follow
ingl is the first of a series of
articles which will appear
throughout the year concern
ing Stanford housing.)

"Because of I he University's de
cision to shrink Branner com
pletely at the end of the quarter
so that it can be turned back to
the men, Housing Committee yes
terday passed the following pro
vision for Branner women:
"All Branner women who will
be upper division students by the
end of this quarter and all lower
division students who have lived
in Branner three quarters will
have preference over their class
in room drawing.
"Housing Committee members
feel that there should be a class
ratio sytem in every living group
in proportion to the number of
women in each class in the Uni
versity, hut they have not decided
how they will work toward this
ideal .situation in the coming
room drawing."
The above appeared in the
April 12, 1946, edition of The
Daily. The boldface portion is the
key to understanding the ensuing
12 years of Stanford's women's
housing problems.
Major Problem
Each year since the abolish
ment of sororities from our cam
pus in spring. 1944, a major prob
lem has confronted the Univer
sity—what to do about women's
housing. That spring a student
organization known as Housing
Committee was set up to work
out a revised housing program,
soon realizing that no campus
housing program will satisfy all
women students.
Yearly, even quarterly, housing
programs were proposed, accept
ed by a two-thirds majority of the
women students, functioned and
were rejected. The programs of
those yesteryears are interesting
in their similarity to portions of
those which were born and died
within the experience of many
Stanford women enrolled today.
They are:
"That the vacancies in each
house be determined in propor
tion to the number of women in
each class drawing." (April '46.)
"Women will be given their

I choice in changing residences in
the following order (for spring
quarter drawing):
"(1i Sponsors returning to for
mer living groups, (2) all seniors,
(3) junior sponsors not returning
to former living groups, (4) jun
iors now in Branner and Roble,
(5) sophomores now in Branner
and Roble, ((6) all other juniors,
(7) all other sophomores. (Feb
ruary '47.»
"The new system provides com
pulsory drawing for all freshmen
and sophomores. Juniors may
draw or remain in their present
residences.
"There will be a two-thirds lim
it on seniors in any residence. Re
maining vacancies will be filled
by juniors in a two-to-one ratio."
April '56.)
Other Plans
Suggested housing programs
are of even more interest. A pos
sible plan submitted in '47 pro
vided:
"1. Freshman year in Roble.
"2. Thereafter—may draw into
any other unit desired for one or
two years.
"3. General drawing for all stu
dents every two years.
"a) Every student who has not
lived in Lagunita or Union or La
suen must draw.
"b> A student may draw each
year if she so desires.
"c) A student may not stay in
any residence more than two
years."
An editorial of April, 1947, fur
ther illustrates the recurring
problems of women's housing
plans:
"Because of the unusually
crowded living situation of the

campus several minority groups
have been given preference in
room drawing. An argument
against preferences is that if they
are continued a precedent will he
started that may be difficult to
stop.
"The ratio system of drawing
. . . has dissatisfied some stu
dents. This plan was introduced
to help the small living groups
keep a representative number of
every class in their houses, but it
makes it more difficult for upper
classmen to move to the houses
of their choice before they grad
uate. Therefore, fall and winter
moving is done by class prefer
ence."
"Ideal" Plan
These are only a few of past at
tempts at satisfying Stanford
women. Various plans sought

the "ideal"—a Utopia unobtain
able largely because of the chang
ing "ideal" of each class.
The academic and intellectual
life of the campus, which, after
all. predominates on a resident
university campus, required that
the "ideal" plan emphasize the
similarities rather than differ
ences between women and living
groups on the whole campus.
It presupposed that all living
groups are equally desirable, that
most women can be happy in any
house to which they are assigned,
that all Stanford women are in
terested in problems that affect
Stanford as a whole instead of the
petty differences between one
group of women and another.
The emphasis was to be not upon
the selfish interests of individuals
but upon integration of the vari

ous campus elements. This was
an ideal expressed in 1916, pos
sibly deserving of being exhumed
today.
Greater Power
The Housing Committee itself
has assumed vastly more power
today than it originally posses
sed. The Women's Conference
(now AWS) president in '45-'46
wrote: "Contrary to popular be
lief, the Housing Committee it
self has no real power. This com
mittee was set up by the Confer
ence at the request of the Admin
istration because they were anx
ious to have the viewpoint of the
women students ofi housing pol
icy.
"All the supposedly-powerful
Housing Committee may do, once
it has Conference approval, is to
make recommendations and sug

gestions to the Administration. If
the desires of the women are ad
ministratively feasible and in ac
cord with the over-all poliey of
the Administration, it is to be ex
pected that the recommendations
of Housing Committee will be
carried out. Our experience this
year has shown the Administra
tion to be very willing to cooper
ate with us.
Continued Cooperation
"However, to gain cooperation
we must first have understand
ing, and for this reason it is im
portant that Housing Committee
works closely with the Adminis
tration, and realizes that the Ad
ministration, -not the students,
has the real control over women's
housing policy."
The continued cooperation of
the Administration in attempting

to give the women housing ac
ceptable and pleasing to them
cannot be denied; subsequent
Housing Committees, unfortu
nately, were not so conscientious,
it would appear, to submit hous
ing programs that were admin
istratively feasible.
In striving to please the women
as a group in the beginning, the
Administration could not forsee
that in 1958 they would be strug
gling with a housing program de
signed to please each women in
dividually.
Members of housing commit
tees during the past 12 years have
earnestly and selflessly expanded
their energies in hopes of draw
ing up a lasting, satisfying, work
able housing program for Stan
ford women. This year's commit
tee is no exception.

"2. Thereafter—may draw into

two years.
"3. General drawing for all stu

"a) Every student who has not
lived in Lagunita or Union or La
suen must draw.
"b> A student may draw each
year if she so desires.
"c) A student may not stay in
any residence more than two

An editorial of April, 1947, fur
ther illustrates the recurring
problems of women's housing
plans:
"Because of the unusually
crowded living situation of the

campus several minority groups
have been given preference in
room drawing. An argument
against preferences is that if they
are continued a precedent will he
started that may be difficult to
stop.
"The ratio system of drawing
. . . has dissatisfied some stu
dents. This plan was introduced
to help the small living groups
keep a representative number of
every class in their houses, but it
makes it more difficult for upper
classmen to move to the houses
of their choice before they grad
uate. Therefore, fall and winter
moving is done by class prefer
ence."
"Ideal" Plan
These are only a few of past at
tempts at satisfying Stanford
women. Various plans sought

the "ideal"—a Utopia unobtain
able largely because of the chang
ing "ideal" of each class.
The academic and intellectual
life of the campus, which, after
all. predominates on a resident
university campus, required that
the "ideal" plan emphasize the
similarities rather than differ
ences between women and living
groups on the whole campus.
It presupposed that all living
groups are equally desirable, that
most women can be happy in any
house to which they are assigned,
that all Stanford women are in
terested in problems that affect
Stanford as a whole instead of the
petty differences between one
group of women and another.
The emphasis was to be not upon
the selfish interests of individuals
but upon integration of the vari

ous campus elements. This was
an ideal expressed in 1916, pos
sibly deserving of being exhumed
today.
Greater Power
The Housing Committee itself
has assumed vastly more power
today than it originally posses
sed. The Women's Conference
(now AWS) president in '45-'46
wrote: "Contrary to popular be
lief, the Housing Committee it
self has no real power. This com
mittee was set up by the Confer
ence at the request of the Admin
istration because they were anx
ious to have the viewpoint of the
women students ofi housing pol
icy.
"All the supposedly-powerful
Housing Committee may do, once
it has Conference approval, is to
make recommendations and sug

gestions to the Administration. If
the desires of the women are ad
ministratively feasible and in ac
cord with the over-all poliey of
the Administration, it is to be ex
pected that the recommendations
of Housing Committee will be
carried out. Our experience this
year has shown the Administra
tion to be very willing to cooper
ate with us.
Continued Cooperation
"However, to gain cooperation
we must first have understand
ing, and for this reason it is im
portant that Housing Committee
works closely with the Adminis
tration, and realizes that the Ad
ministration, -not the students,
has the real control over women's
housing policy."
The continued cooperation of
the Administration in attempting

to give the women housing ac
ceptable and pleasing to them
cannot be denied; subsequent
Housing Committees, unfortu
nately, were not so conscientious,
it would appear, to submit hous
ing programs that were admin
istratively feasible.
In striving to please the women
as a group in the beginning, the
Administration could not forsee
that in 1958 they would be strug
gling with a housing program de
signed to please each women in
dividually.
Members of housing commit
tees during the past 12 years have
earnestly and selflessly expanded
their energies in hopes of draw
ing up a lasting, satisfying, work
able housing program for Stan
ford women. This year's commit
tee is no exception.
(Editor's Note: The follow

articles which will appear
throughout the year concern

"Because of I he University's de
cision to shrink Branner com
pletely at the end of the quarter

the men, Housing Committee yes

vision for Branner women:
"All Branner women who will
be upper division students by the
end of this quarter and all lower
division students who have lived
in Branner three quarters will
have preference over their class
in room drawing.
"Housing Committee members
feel that there should be a class
ratio sytem in every living group

women in each class in the Uni

12 years of Stanford's women's
housing problems.
Major Problem
Each year since the abolish
ment of sororities from our cam
pus in spring. 1944, a major prob
lem has confronted the Univer
sity—what to do about women's
housing. That spring a student
organization known as Housing
Committee was set up to work
out a revised housing program,
soon realizing that no campus
housing program will satisfy all
women students.
Yearly, even quarterly, housing
programs were proposed, accept
ed by a two-thirds majority of the
women students, functioned and
were rejected. The programs of
those yesteryears are interesting
in their similarity to portions of
those which were born and died
within the experience of many
Stanford women enrolled today.
They are:
"That the vacancies in each
house be determined in propor
tion to the number of women in
each class drawing." (April '46.)
"Women will be given their

I choice in changing residences in
the following order (for spring
quarter drawing):
"(1i Sponsors returning to for
mer living groups, (2) all seniors,
(3) junior sponsors not returning
to former living groups, (4) jun
iors now in Branner and Roble,
(5) sophomores now in Branner
and Roble, ((6) all other juniors,
(7) all other sophomores. (Feb
ruary '47.»
"The new system provides com
pulsory drawing for all freshmen
and sophomores. Juniors may
draw or remain in their present
residences.
"There will be a two-thirds lim
it on seniors in any residence. Re
maining vacancies will be filled
by juniors in a two-to-one ratio."

are of even more interest. A pos

year has shown the Administra
tion to be very willing to cooper
ate with us.
Continued Cooperation
"However, to gain cooperation
we must first have understand
ing, and for this reason it is im
portant that Housing Committee
works closely with the Adminis
tration, and realizes that the Ad
ministration, -not the students,
has the real control over women's
housing policy."
The continued cooperation of
the Administration in attempting

to give the women housing ac
ceptable and pleasing to them
cannot be denied; subsequent
Housing Committees, unfortu
nately, were not so conscientious,
it would appear, to submit hous
ing programs that were admin
istratively feasible.
In striving to please the women
as a group in the beginning, the
Administration could not forsee
that in 1958 they would be strug
gling with a housing program de
signed to please each women in
dividually.
Members of housing commit
tees during the past 12 years have
earnestly and selflessly expanded
their energies in hopes of draw
ing up a lasting, satisfying, work
able housing program for Stan
ford women. This year's commit
tee is no exception.

"Because of I he University's de
cision to shrink Branner com
pletely at the end of the quarter
so that it can be turned back to
the men, Housing Committee yes
terday passed the following pro
vision for Branner women:
"All Branner women who will
be upper division students by the
end of this quarter and all lower
division students who have lived
in Branner three quarters will
have preference over their class
in room drawing.
"Housing Committee members
feel that there should be a class
ratio sytem in every living group
in proportion to the number of
women in each class in the Uni
versity, hut they have not decided
how they will work toward this
ideal .situation in the coming
room drawing."
The above appeared in the
April 12, 1946, edition of The
Daily. The boldface portion is the
key to understanding the ensuing
12 years of Stanford's women's
housing problems.
Major Problem
Each year since the abolish
ment of sororities from our cam
pus in spring. 1944, a major prob
lem has confronted the Univer
sity—what to do about women's
housing. That spring a student
organization known as Housing
Committee was set up to work
out a revised housing program,
soon realizing that no campus
housing program will satisfy all
women students.
Yearly, even quarterly, housing
programs were proposed, accept
ed by a two-thirds majority of the
women students, functioned and
were rejected. The programs of
those yesteryears are interesting
in their similarity to portions of
those which were born and died
within the experience of many
Stanford women enrolled today.
They are:
"That the vacancies in each
house be determined in propor
tion to the number of women in
each class drawing." (April '46.)
"Women will be given their

I choice in changing residences in
the following order (for spring
quarter drawing):
"(1i Sponsors returning to for
mer living groups, (2) all seniors,
(3) junior sponsors not returning
to former living groups, (4) jun
iors now in Branner and Roble,
(5) sophomores now in Branner
and Roble, ((6) all other juniors,
(7) all other sophomores. (Feb
ruary '47.»
"The new system provides com
pulsory drawing for all freshmen
and sophomores. Juniors may
draw or remain in their present
residences.
"There will be a two-thirds lim
it on seniors in any residence. Re
maining vacancies will be filled
by juniors in a two-to-one ratio."
April '56.)
Other Plans
Suggested housing programs
are of even more interest. A pos
sible plan submitted in '47 pro
vided:
"1. Freshman year in Roble.
"2. Thereafter—may draw into
any other unit desired for one or
two years.
"3. General drawing for all stu
dents every two years.
"a) Every student who has not
lived in Lagunita or Union or La
suen must draw.
"b> A student may draw each
year if she so desires.
"c) A student may not stay in
any residence more than two
years."
An editorial of April, 1947, fur
ther illustrates the recurring
problems of women's housing
plans:
"Because of the unusually
crowded living situation of the

campus several minority groups
have been given preference in
room drawing. An argument
against preferences is that if they
are continued a precedent will he
started that may be difficult to
stop.
"The ratio system of drawing
. . . has dissatisfied some stu
dents. This plan was introduced
to help the small living groups
keep a representative number of
every class in their houses, but it
makes it more difficult for upper
classmen to move to the houses
of their choice before they grad
uate. Therefore, fall and winter
moving is done by class prefer
ence."
"Ideal" Plan
These are only a few of past at
tempts at satisfying Stanford
women. Various plans sought

the "ideal"—a Utopia unobtain
able largely because of the chang
ing "ideal" of each class.
The academic and intellectual
life of the campus, which, after
all. predominates on a resident
university campus, required that
the "ideal" plan emphasize the
similarities rather than differ
ences between women and living
groups on the whole campus.
It presupposed that all living
groups are equally desirable, that
most women can be happy in any
house to which they are assigned,
that all Stanford women are in
terested in problems that affect
Stanford as a whole instead of the
petty differences between one
group of women and another.
The emphasis was to be not upon
the selfish interests of individuals
but upon integration of the vari

ous campus elements. This was
an ideal expressed in 1916, pos
sibly deserving of being exhumed
today.
Greater Power
The Housing Committee itself
has assumed vastly more power
today than it originally posses
sed. The Women's Conference
(now AWS) president in '45-'46
wrote: "Contrary to popular be
lief, the Housing Committee it
self has no real power. This com
mittee was set up by the Confer
ence at the request of the Admin
istration because they were anx
ious to have the viewpoint of the
women students ofi housing pol
icy.
"All the supposedly-powerful
Housing Committee may do, once
it has Conference approval, is to
make recommendations and sug

gestions to the Administration. If
the desires of the women are ad
ministratively feasible and in ac
cord with the over-all poliey of
the Administration, it is to be ex
pected that the recommendations
of Housing Committee will be
carried out. Our experience this

"That the vacancies in each
house be determined in propor
tion to the number of women in
each class drawing." (April '46.)
"Women will be given their

I choice in changing residences in
the following order (for spring
quarter drawing):
"(1i Sponsors returning to for
mer living groups, (2) all seniors,
(3) junior sponsors not returning
to former living groups, (4) jun
iors now in Branner and Roble,
(5) sophomores now in Branner
and Roble, ((6) all other juniors,
(7) all other sophomores. (Feb
ruary '47.»
"The new system provides com
pulsory drawing for all freshmen
and sophomores. Juniors may
draw or remain in their present
residences.
"There will be a two-thirds lim
it on seniors in any residence. Re
maining vacancies will be filled
by juniors in a two-to-one ratio."
April '56.)
Other Plans
Suggested housing programs
are of even more interest. A pos
sible plan submitted in '47 pro
vided:
"1. Freshman year in Roble.
"2. Thereafter—may draw into
any other unit desired for one or
two years.
"3. General drawing for all stu
dents every two years.
"a) Every student who has not
lived in Lagunita or Union or La
suen must draw.
"b> A student may draw each
year if she so desires.
"c) A student may not stay in
any residence more than two
years."
An editorial of April, 1947, fur
ther illustrates the recurring
problems of women's housing
plans:
"Because of the unusually
crowded living situation of the

campus several minority groups
have been given preference in
room drawing. An argument
against preferences is that if they
are continued a precedent will he
started that may be difficult to
stop.
"The ratio system of drawing
. . . has dissatisfied some stu
dents. This plan was introduced
to help the small living groups
keep a representative number of
every class in their houses, but it
makes it more difficult for upper
classmen to move to the houses
of their choice before they grad
uate. Therefore, fall and winter
moving is done by class prefer
ence."
"Ideal" Plan
These are only a few of past at
tempts at satisfying Stanford
women. Various plans sought

the "ideal"—a Utopia unobtain
able largely because of the chang
ing "ideal" of each class.
The academic and intellectual
life of the campus, which, after
all. predominates on a resident
university campus, required that
the "ideal" plan emphasize the
similarities rather than differ
ences between women and living
groups on the whole campus.
It presupposed that all living
groups are equally desirable, that
most women can be happy in any
house to which they are assigned,
that all Stanford women are in
terested in problems that affect
Stanford as a whole instead of the
petty differences between one
group of women and another.
The emphasis was to be not upon
the selfish interests of individuals
but upon integration of the vari

ous campus elements. This was
an ideal expressed in 1916, pos
sibly deserving of being exhumed
today.
Greater Power
The Housing Committee itself
has assumed vastly more power
today than it originally posses
sed. The Women's Conference
(now AWS) president in '45-'46
wrote: "Contrary to popular be
lief, the Housing Committee it
self has no real power. This com
mittee was set up by the Confer
ence at the request of the Admin
istration because they were anx
ious to have the viewpoint of the
women students ofi housing pol
icy.
"All the supposedly-powerful
Housing Committee may do, once
it has Conference approval, is to
make recommendations and sug

gestions to the Administration. If
the desires of the women are ad
ministratively feasible and in ac
cord with the over-all poliey of
the Administration, it is to be ex
pected that the recommendations
of Housing Committee will be
carried out. Our experience this
year has shown the Administra
tion to be very willing to cooper
ate with us.
Continued Cooperation
"However, to gain cooperation
we must first have understand
ing, and for this reason it is im
portant that Housing Committee
works closely with the Adminis
tration, and realizes that the Ad
ministration, -not the students,
has the real control over women's
housing policy."
The continued cooperation of
the Administration in attempting

to give the women housing ac
ceptable and pleasing to them
cannot be denied; subsequent
Housing Committees, unfortu
nately, were not so conscientious,
it would appear, to submit hous
ing programs that were admin
istratively feasible.
In striving to please the women
as a group in the beginning, the
Administration could not forsee
that in 1958 they would be strug
gling with a housing program de
signed to please each women in
dividually.
Members of housing commit
tees during the past 12 years have
earnestly and selflessly expanded
their energies in hopes of draw
ing up a lasting, satisfying, work
able housing program for Stan
ford women. This year's commit
tee is no exception.
(Editor's Note: The follow
ingl is the first of a series of
articles which will appear
throughout the year concern
ing Stanford housing.)

"Because of I he University's de
cision to shrink Branner com
pletely at the end of the quarter
so that it can be turned back to
the men, Housing Committee yes
terday passed the following pro
vision for Branner women:
"All Branner women who will
be upper division students by the
end of this quarter and all lower
division students who have lived
in Branner three quarters will
have preference over their class
in room drawing.
"Housing Committee members
feel that there should be a class
ratio sytem in every living group
in proportion to the number of
women in each class in the Uni
versity, hut they have not decided
how they will work toward this
ideal .situation in the coming
room drawing."
The above appeared in the
April 12, 1946, edition of The
Daily. The boldface portion is the
key to understanding the ensuing
12 years of Stanford's women's
housing problems.
Major Problem
Each year since the abolish
ment of sororities from our cam
pus in spring. 1944, a major prob
lem has confronted the Univer
sity—what to do about women's
housing. That spring a student
organization known as Housing
Committee was set up to work
out a revised housing program,
soon realizing that no campus
housing program will satisfy all
women students.
Yearly, even quarterly, housing
programs were proposed, accept
ed by a two-thirds majority of the
women students, functioned and
were rejected. The programs of
those yesteryears are interesting
in their similarity to portions of
those which were born and died
within the experience of many
Stanford women enrolled today.
They are:
"That the vacancies in each
house be determined in propor
tion to the number of women in
each class drawing." (April '46.)
