## SPORT SCENE Strong Stanford Harriers Run Against SC, UCLA 
### 
Payton Jordan will take what
hp terms the "best nucleus of a
running team since I've been at
Stanford" to Los Angeles for a
Saturday morning cross-country
meet at UCLA among the In
dians, Bruins and USC.
Two freshmen, John Northway
and Kim Maxwell, are ihe sur
prise fifth and sixth men on the
squad, joining Keilh Wallace, Boh
Monzingo, Doug Martin and Lar
ry Suelzle.
Tuesday, Jordan held a full-dis
tance run-off for the fifth, sixth
and seventh spots on the team.
Northway blazed the four miles
in 21:43, second fastest Stanford
lime of Ihe fall. Maxwell was
close behind with a full minute's
improvement over his time
against the Air Force. The sev
enth man was so much farther
behind that Jordan decided to just
take the six in his effort to up
set the Southlanders.
All hough USC has in Max Tru
ex and Altus Peterson the two
strongest individual runners from
the L.A. schools, UCLA has the
better team balance and compact
ness of running style.
Because of the many narrow
stretches on the hilly Bruin
course, the team which can best
run as a pack will probably come
out on top.

Jordan says his six-man com
bine is a "good compact team,"
and indications from the Cards'
times on the local course are that
they should be able to bunch ef
fectively.
Wallace is Stanford's top indi
vidual threat to Truex. lie proved
his two recent showings were no
fluke by knocking off a 9:19.7
two mile on the stadium track
this week—excellent time for this
stage of the season.
