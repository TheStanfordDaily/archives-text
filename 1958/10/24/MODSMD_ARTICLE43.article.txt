Aii Interesting Report

In conjunction with a survey of its future operations, and the us<
of Stanford Stadium in particular, the Department of Physical lOduca
tion has had a report prepared for it by Stanford Research Institute
This is one of the most interesting reports of this nature that ha
ever come to this writer's attention.
Because the Department is supported by revenue from Stadium
attractions and, let's be frank, this means little more than football
games it was felt that a plan for the future had to be evolvec 7
whereby increasing Stadium attendance, and thereby revenue, could
be assured.
SRI came up with some pretty interesting facts, conclusions and
ideas, and Assistant Director of Athletics Chuck Taylor seems prett\
enthused about the results. As assistant director, Taylor will be called
upon to put many of the ideas into play.
Football, to SRI, is considered a "mass audience attraction," and
the research body has come up with the conclusion that professional
football, television and other competing attractions will not dip into

college football attendance as long
as (1) prices are kept "competi
tive," (2) the public's interest is
stimulated through good promo
tion and (3) the attractions are
interestingly staged.
Perhaps this report is interest
ing for the portent that it is, not
only to Stanford football but to
collegiate football around the na
tion; for this, 1 gather, is not the
only report of this type which has
been carried on for a college.
But, at that, it is not the first
to suggest that a change is going
to come about in the national foot
ball picture. This has been fore
cast in the past. Bigger and bet
ter half-time displays, more color
ful publicity of teams and rivals,
ticket-buying advantages, increas
ed and more varied services at the
concession and public information
levels and other changes will soon
begin to appear on the scene.
Even this year it seems that
Stanford took a little of the report
to heart in its pre-season ticket

campaign. Both Cal and Stanford, for that matter, got their share
of publicity in city papers for the change in their campaigns. Stan
lord came out with a Hollywood-Madison Avenue-sounding pamphlet
which advocated, among other things, "bring the family to football,"
"enjoy Saturdays at Stanford Stadium," plenty of free parking, ideal
pre-game picnic grounds, family ticket plan, a proud announcement
of the "1958 Jack Curtice-coached Stanford Indians" and a host of
other new-sounding phrases in the football ticket-selling business.
Hut all indications are that it's working, and that's good. C'al's must
have been pretty much the same.
# #
SRl's report goes beyond ticket sales, though, into some other
interesting suggestions. One of these is the building of another
"traditional" game in the season— with Southern California or San
Jose State. Southern Cal was a possibility because of its private
nature, the number of alumni in the Bay Area and easy accessibility,
even from the Los Angeles area. San Jose State was a possibility
because of the healthy number of football fans" on the Peninsula,
particularly the lower Peninsula. A consideration here was the hope
of picking up a number of the Santa Clara fans left hanging after
1 hat school dropped football.
This reporter was frankly surprised at this idea. It has always
seemed to me that we already had more than one traditional game
though none quite as big as BIG GAME. Games with the other two
California schools are quite big and seem to have taken on a tradi
tional characteristic.
But, though tempted to laugh at the thought of a tradition with
San Jose State, I was forced to reconsider when considering State's
desire to build a football power. Still, this is some time in the future
- but then again a real possibility, because the whole report is aimed
at the future.
SHI includes some relatively minor—or at least they seem so now
suggestions about parking fees, better concession facilities, a "Pull
man" section of seats (extra-plush in convenience and services) and
a few other notes of this sort.
BIG GAME, reports the Institute, points up some interesting facts.
For instance, it annually has produced more than 50 per cent of the
yearly revenue, though it has come to produce a smaller and smaller
percentage in recent years; at one time it was as high as 80 per cent.
It also figures pretty significantly into attendance figures. Last year,
for example, average attendance, omitting the Cal tussle, was around
36,000; WITH the BIG GAMK it was 45.000.
Western Cultural Center
Most interesting phase of the report is a suggestion to use Stan
lord Stadium in a manner that will give it momentum toward helping
Stanford achieve status as "Cultural and Sports Center of the West."
Developed attractively, and including not only the Stadium but the
new Pavilion over in that area, the Frost Amphitheater, the soccer
and baseball fields, and other facilities, this is a topnotch idea and
one thai this columnist goes for in a big way.
Suggested to fit into this plan are major attractions such as inter
national soccer matches, Olympic trials, pageants, personal appear
ances of famous personalities, international celebrations, and many
more. But these are to be procured and promoted as an intellectual
and high-grade activity and not for the sake of bringing attractions
here just to get people into the Stadium. With this I wholeheartedly
agree.

gyms at Westwood. Can't find the starting time, but figure about
!) p.m. or so—right after Homecoming Parade in Westwood. Hear ii

will be aboard.
Jack Curtice, in leading paragraph of opening story in monthly
Buck Club Bulletin, says: "We're thinking about starting a new kind
of football contest. In this one, all the fans would write us a postcard
after every game and tell us tin* boys they'd like to see play the next

SRl's report goes beyond ticket sales, though, into some other
interesting suggestions. One of these is the building of another
"traditional" game in the season— with Southern California or San
Jose State. Southern Cal was a possibility because of its private
nature, the number of alumni in the Bay Area and easy accessibility,
even from the Los Angeles area. San Jose State was a possibility
because of the healthy number of football fans" on the Peninsula,
particularly the lower Peninsula. A consideration here was the hope
of picking up a number of the Santa Clara fans left hanging after
1 hat school dropped football.
This reporter was frankly surprised at this idea. It has always
seemed to me that we already had more than one traditional game
though none quite as big as BIG GAME. Games with the other two
California schools are quite big and seem to have taken on a tradi
tional characteristic.
But, though tempted to laugh at the thought of a tradition with
San Jose State, I was forced to reconsider when considering State's
desire to build a football power. Still, this is some time in the future
- but then again a real possibility, because the whole report is aimed
at the future.
SHI includes some relatively minor—or at least they seem so now
suggestions about parking fees, better concession facilities, a "Pull
man" section of seats (extra-plush in convenience and services) and
a few other notes of this sort.
BIG GAME, reports the Institute, points up some interesting facts.
For instance, it annually has produced more than 50 per cent of the
yearly revenue, though it has come to produce a smaller and smaller
percentage in recent years; at one time it was as high as 80 per cent.
It also figures pretty significantly into attendance figures. Last year,
for example, average attendance, omitting the Cal tussle, was around
36,000; WITH the BIG GAMK it was 45.000.
Western Cultural Center
Most interesting phase of the report is a suggestion to use Stan
lord Stadium in a manner that will give it momentum toward helping
Stanford achieve status as "Cultural and Sports Center of the West."
Developed attractively, and including not only the Stadium but the
new Pavilion over in that area, the Frost Amphitheater, the soccer
and baseball fields, and other facilities, this is a topnotch idea and
one thai this columnist goes for in a big way.
Suggested to fit into this plan are major attractions such as inter
national soccer matches, Olympic trials, pageants, personal appear
ances of famous personalities, international celebrations, and many
more. But these are to be procured and promoted as an intellectual
and high-grade activity and not for the sake of bringing attractions
here just to get people into the Stadium. With this I wholeheartedly
agree.

Aii Interesting Report

In conjunction with a survey of its future operations, and the us<
of Stanford Stadium in particular, the Department of Physical lOduca
tion has had a report prepared for it by Stanford Research Institute
This is one of the most interesting reports of this nature that ha
ever come to this writer's attention.
Because the Department is supported by revenue from Stadium
attractions and, let's be frank, this means little more than football
games it was felt that a plan for the future had to be evolvec 7
whereby increasing Stadium attendance, and thereby revenue, could
be assured.
SRI came up with some pretty interesting facts, conclusions and
ideas, and Assistant Director of Athletics Chuck Taylor seems prett\
enthused about the results. As assistant director, Taylor will be called
upon to put many of the ideas into play.
Football, to SRI, is considered a "mass audience attraction," and
the research body has come up with the conclusion that professional
football, television and other competing attractions will not dip into

college football attendance as long
as (1) prices are kept "competi
tive," (2) the public's interest is
stimulated through good promo
tion and (3) the attractions are
interestingly staged.
Perhaps this report is interest
ing for the portent that it is, not
only to Stanford football but to
collegiate football around the na
tion; for this, 1 gather, is not the
only report of this type which has
been carried on for a college.
But, at that, it is not the first
to suggest that a change is going
to come about in the national foot
ball picture. This has been fore
cast in the past. Bigger and bet
ter half-time displays, more color
ful publicity of teams and rivals,
ticket-buying advantages, increas
ed and more varied services at the
concession and public information
levels and other changes will soon
begin to appear on the scene.
Even this year it seems that
Stanford took a little of the report
to heart in its pre-season ticket

campaign. Both Cal and Stanford, for that matter, got their share
of publicity in city papers for the change in their campaigns. Stan
lord came out with a Hollywood-Madison Avenue-sounding pamphlet
which advocated, among other things, "bring the family to football,"
"enjoy Saturdays at Stanford Stadium," plenty of free parking, ideal
pre-game picnic grounds, family ticket plan, a proud announcement
of the "1958 Jack Curtice-coached Stanford Indians" and a host of
other new-sounding phrases in the football ticket-selling business.
Hut all indications are that it's working, and that's good. C'al's must

Aii Interesting Report

In conjunction with a survey of its future operations, and the us<
of Stanford Stadium in particular, the Department of Physical lOduca
tion has had a report prepared for it by Stanford Research Institute
This is one of the most interesting reports of this nature that ha
ever come to this writer's attention.
Because the Department is supported by revenue from Stadium
attractions and, let's be frank, this means little more than football
games it was felt that a plan for the future had to be evolvec 7
whereby increasing Stadium attendance, and thereby revenue, could
be assured.
SRI came up with some pretty interesting facts, conclusions and
ideas, and Assistant Director of Athletics Chuck Taylor seems prett\
enthused about the results. As assistant director, Taylor will be called
upon to put many of the ideas into play.
Football, to SRI, is considered a "mass audience attraction," and
the research body has come up with the conclusion that professional
football, television and other competing attractions will not dip into

college football attendance as long
as (1) prices are kept "competi
tive," (2) the public's interest is
stimulated through good promo
tion and (3) the attractions are
interestingly staged.
Perhaps this report is interest
ing for the portent that it is, not
only to Stanford football but to
collegiate football around the na
tion; for this, 1 gather, is not the
only report of this type which has
been carried on for a college.
But, at that, it is not the first
to suggest that a change is going
to come about in the national foot
ball picture. This has been fore
cast in the past. Bigger and bet
ter half-time displays, more color
ful publicity of teams and rivals,
ticket-buying advantages, increas
ed and more varied services at the
concession and public information
levels and other changes will soon
begin to appear on the scene.
Even this year it seems that
Stanford took a little of the report
to heart in its pre-season ticket

campaign. Both Cal and Stanford, for that matter, got their share
of publicity in city papers for the change in their campaigns. Stan
lord came out with a Hollywood-Madison Avenue-sounding pamphlet
which advocated, among other things, "bring the family to football,"
"enjoy Saturdays at Stanford Stadium," plenty of free parking, ideal
pre-game picnic grounds, family ticket plan, a proud announcement
of the "1958 Jack Curtice-coached Stanford Indians" and a host of
other new-sounding phrases in the football ticket-selling business.
Hut all indications are that it's working, and that's good. C'al's must
have been pretty much the same.
# #
SRl's report goes beyond ticket sales, though, into some other
interesting suggestions. One of these is the building of another
"traditional" game in the season— with Southern California or San
Jose State. Southern Cal was a possibility because of its private
nature, the number of alumni in the Bay Area and easy accessibility,
even from the Los Angeles area. San Jose State was a possibility
because of the healthy number of football fans" on the Peninsula,
particularly the lower Peninsula. A consideration here was the hope
of picking up a number of the Santa Clara fans left hanging after
1 hat school dropped football.
This reporter was frankly surprised at this idea. It has always
seemed to me that we already had more than one traditional game
though none quite as big as BIG GAME. Games with the other two
California schools are quite big and seem to have taken on a tradi
tional characteristic.
But, though tempted to laugh at the thought of a tradition with
San Jose State, I was forced to reconsider when considering State's
desire to build a football power. Still, this is some time in the future
- but then again a real possibility, because the whole report is aimed
at the future.
SHI includes some relatively minor—or at least they seem so now
suggestions about parking fees, better concession facilities, a "Pull
man" section of seats (extra-plush in convenience and services) and
a few other notes of this sort.
BIG GAME, reports the Institute, points up some interesting facts.
For instance, it annually has produced more than 50 per cent of the
yearly revenue, though it has come to produce a smaller and smaller
percentage in recent years; at one time it was as high as 80 per cent.
It also figures pretty significantly into attendance figures. Last year,
for example, average attendance, omitting the Cal tussle, was around
36,000; WITH the BIG GAMK it was 45.000.
Western Cultural Center
Most interesting phase of the report is a suggestion to use Stan
lord Stadium in a manner that will give it momentum toward helping
Stanford achieve status as "Cultural and Sports Center of the West."
Developed attractively, and including not only the Stadium but the
new Pavilion over in that area, the Frost Amphitheater, the soccer
and baseball fields, and other facilities, this is a topnotch idea and
one thai this columnist goes for in a big way.
Suggested to fit into this plan are major attractions such as inter

tion; for this, 1 gather, is not the
only report of this type which has
been carried on for a college.
But, at that, it is not the first
to suggest that a change is going
to come about in the national foot
ball picture. This has been fore
cast in the past. Bigger and bet
ter half-time displays, more color
ful publicity of teams and rivals,
ticket-buying advantages, increas
ed and more varied services at the
concession and public information
levels and other changes will soon
begin to appear on the scene.
Even this year it seems that
Stanford took a little of the report
to heart in its pre-season ticket

campaign. Both Cal and Stanford, for that matter, got their share
of publicity in city papers for the change in their campaigns. Stan
lord came out with a Hollywood-Madison Avenue-sounding pamphlet
which advocated, among other things, "bring the family to football,"
"enjoy Saturdays at Stanford Stadium," plenty of free parking, ideal
pre-game picnic grounds, family ticket plan, a proud announcement
of the "1958 Jack Curtice-coached Stanford Indians" and a host of
other new-sounding phrases in the football ticket-selling business.
Hut all indications are that it's working, and that's good. C'al's must
have been pretty much the same.

SRl's report goes beyond ticket sales, though, into some other
interesting suggestions. One of these is the building of another
"traditional" game in the season— with Southern California or San
Jose State. Southern Cal was a possibility because of its private
nature, the number of alumni in the Bay Area and easy accessibility,
even from the Los Angeles area. San Jose State was a possibility
because of the healthy number of football fans" on the Peninsula,
particularly the lower Peninsula. A consideration here was the hope
of picking up a number of the Santa Clara fans left hanging after
1 hat school dropped football.
This reporter was frankly surprised at this idea. It has always
seemed to me that we already had more than one traditional game
though none quite as big as BIG GAME. Games with the other two
California schools are quite big and seem to have taken on a tradi
tional characteristic.
But, though tempted to laugh at the thought of a tradition with
San Jose State, I was forced to reconsider when considering State's
desire to build a football power. Still, this is some time in the future
- but then again a real possibility, because the whole report is aimed
at the future.
SHI includes some relatively minor—or at least they seem so now
suggestions about parking fees, better concession facilities, a "Pull
man" section of seats (extra-plush in convenience and services) and
a few other notes of this sort.
BIG GAME, reports the Institute, points up some interesting facts.
For instance, it annually has produced more than 50 per cent of the
yearly revenue, though it has come to produce a smaller and smaller
percentage in recent years; at one time it was as high as 80 per cent.
It also figures pretty significantly into attendance figures. Last year,
for example, average attendance, omitting the Cal tussle, was around
36,000; WITH the BIG GAMK it was 45.000.
Western Cultural Center
Most interesting phase of the report is a suggestion to use Stan
lord Stadium in a manner that will give it momentum toward helping
Stanford achieve status as "Cultural and Sports Center of the West."
Developed attractively, and including not only the Stadium but the
new Pavilion over in that area, the Frost Amphitheater, the soccer
and baseball fields, and other facilities, this is a topnotch idea and
one thai this columnist goes for in a big way.
Suggested to fit into this plan are major attractions such as inter
national soccer matches, Olympic trials, pageants, personal appear
ances of famous personalities, international celebrations, and many
more. But these are to be procured and promoted as an intellectual
and high-grade activity and not for the sake of bringing attractions
here just to get people into the Stadium. With this I wholeheartedly
agree.

RALLY TON'IGIIT in Los Angeles, between men's and women's
gyms at Westwood. Can't find the starting time, but figure about
!) p.m. or so—right after Homecoming Parade in Westwood. Hear ii
rumored that Hollywood entertainers Stan Freberg and Jerry Lewis
will be aboard.
Jack Curtice, in leading paragraph of opening story in monthly
Buck Club Bulletin, says: "We're thinking about starting a new kind
of football contest. In this one, all the fans would write us a postcard
after every game and tell us tin* boys they'd like to see play the next
game. Those who received the most [would] play." Any comers?
OFF TO L.A. come on, Stanford, fight!!
