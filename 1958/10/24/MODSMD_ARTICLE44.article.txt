## Bear, Webfoot Contest May Decide Rose Bowl 
### 
Everybody is firing up what
hey hope will be a Rose Bow]
Express as the Pacific Coast Con
ference heads into the home
stretch that will decide what team
will be its parting representative
in the Tournament of Roses on
Jan. 1.
With all of the six eligibles still
in the race, on paper, four confer
ence games are scheduled for tho
weekend. The odds ■on choices,
California and Washington State,
are both at home, but with rug
ged assignments. League-leading
Cal hosts an ineligible Oregon
outfit while WSC plays the eager
Southern California sophomores
in Spokane. These are as close to
toss-ups as they come.
Meanwhile, Oregon State will
test its "resurgence" against a
heart-broken Washington and the
conference's other ineligible, UC
LA. will send its senior-less line
up against hopeful Stanford.
Ducks Have («ood Defense
Defending co - champ Oregon
has a 2-2 record this season, but
in the points for points against
department, the Ducks stand'at
52-12. Both losses were by GO, to
Oklahoma and last week t<> WSC.
And if the Webfoots can rebound
to derail Cal's Express, the Bears
may cry that Oregon is in a con
spiracy to get a Northwest school
to Pasadena for the third straighl
year.
Cal is basking in the glory of
three straight victories, a phe
nomenon that hasn't been expe
rienced in Berkeley since way
back in the Pappy Waldorf days.

The Bears snapped a seven-year
Los Angeles losing streak last
week by topping USC, 14-12, and
would just as soon snap another
Saturday . . . Oregon's five-game
victory string over the Gold and
Blue.
A win Saturday would definite
ly put Coach Pete Elliott's Ex
oress on the inside track to the
Bowl, as Oregon is still being
rated the conference's class.
WSC, suddenly developing im
penetrable defensive muscles
with two straight shutouts, has
to catch the Bears. The Cougars
forgot their great passing game
last week and went almost whol
ly on the ground against Oregon.
Cougar passing greal Bob New
man is still semi-hobbled and may
see just limited action. SC has
done little since its opening win
over OSC, but three of the four
losses have been by the margin of
conversions. The Trojans out
played Cal last week before los
ing and another defeat Saturday
would permanently sidetrack the
Troy Limited.

Washington, so proud after its
narrow loss to Ohio State weeks
ago, is in the same predicament
as SC. The Huskies have taken
two sound conference beatings
and it's going to be a mighty
steep climb for their Express.
Things are doubly complicated
by the fact that they must meet
Oregon State in enemy territory
at Portland. The Beavers have
never lost in Corvallis or Port
land since Tom Prothro has been
coach.
An upset over the Beavers was
one of the few bright spots in the
Huskies' campaign last year, and
it will h;ive to be another upset if
Washington will win this year.
In the up and down Beavers they
will face the most puzzling learn
in the conference . . . but one
which may have found itself with
last week's 20-G triumph over
Idaho.
And the Idaho Vandals, their
conference season already over,
start what may prove to be an
unbeaten .string of intersecionals
tomorrow night at Arizona.
