# No New Pope-- Faulty Signals
## 
### 
VATICAN CITY (/P) -Cardinals balloted four times Sunday with
out electing a pope. A mixup in smoke signals made it appear for
about half an hour that Pius Xll's successor had been chosen.
For a time, 200,000 Romans and tourists in huge St. Peter's Square
were certain the Roman Catholic Church had a new pontiff.

Millions of others who listened J
to radios throughout Italy and I
Europe were certain. They heard j
the Vatican radio speaker shout ,
exultantly: "A pope is elected."
Confusion
The scene around the Vatican
was one of incredible confusion. |
White smoke from a little chim- |
ney atop the Vatican is the tradi
tional signal announcing the elec- j
tion of a new pope. Black smoke
indicates failure.
Twice during the day smoke!
billowed from the chimney.
At noon the smoke at first came
white but it quickly turned un
questionably black. This was the
sign the cardinals had failed to
elect on the first two ballotss.
At nightfall, white smoke bil- !
lowed from the slender chimney
for a full five minutes. For all
the outside world knew, a new
pontiff had been chosen.
"Bianco! Bianco!" roared many
in the crowd. White, white.
False Hopes
The Vatican radio announced
the smoke was white. The an
nouncer declared the cardinals at
that moment probably were going
through the rites of adoration for j
a new supreme pontiff. For a
long time Vatican Radio stuck to
its insistence the smoke was
white. News media had flashed
the world the word that a new
pope had been chosen.
After half an hour, radios be
gan to chatter excitedly that the
answer still was uncertain.
Only well after the time when
a now pope should have appeared
on the balcony above St. Peter's
Square was it certain that the
voting would have to resume
Monday.
Loss to Explain
Vatican authorities seemed at a
loss to explain. One authority
suggested it might be a question
of quantity of smoke.
The cardinals had taken two
ballots in each session. No candi
date received the necessary 38
votes —two-thirds of the 51 cardi
nals present plus one additional
vote.
It took only three ballots to
elect Pius XII in 1939, and it
would have taken only two but
for the late Pope's insistence upon
a check vote.

White smoke from a little chim- |
ney atop the Vatican is the tradi
tional signal announcing the elec- j
tion of a new pope. Black smoke
indicates failure.
Twice during the day smoke!
billowed from the chimney.
At noon the smoke at first came
white but it quickly turned un
questionably black. This was the
sign the cardinals had failed to
elect on the first two ballotss.
At nightfall, white smoke bil- !
lowed from the slender chimney
for a full five minutes. For all
the outside world knew, a new
pontiff had been chosen.
"Bianco! Bianco!" roared many
in the crowd. White, white.
False Hopes
The Vatican radio announced
the smoke was white. The an
nouncer declared the cardinals at
that moment probably were going
through the rites of adoration for j
a new supreme pontiff. For a
long time Vatican Radio stuck to
its insistence the smoke was
white. News media had flashed
the world the word that a new
pope had been chosen.
After half an hour, radios be
gan to chatter excitedly that the
answer still was uncertain.
Only well after the time when
a now pope should have appeared
on the balcony above St. Peter's
Square was it certain that the
voting would have to resume
Monday.
Loss to Explain
Vatican authorities seemed at a
loss to explain. One authority
suggested it might be a question
of quantity of smoke.
The cardinals had taken two
ballots in each session. No candi
date received the necessary 38
votes —two-thirds of the 51 cardi
nals present plus one additional
vote.
It took only three ballots to
elect Pius XII in 1939, and it
would have taken only two but
for the late Pope's insistence upon
a check vote.
VATICAN CITY (/P) -Cardinals balloted four times Sunday with
out electing a pope. A mixup in smoke signals made it appear for
about half an hour that Pius Xll's successor had been chosen.
For a time, 200,000 Romans and tourists in huge St. Peter's Square
were certain the Roman Catholic Church had a new pontiff.

Millions of others who listened J
to radios throughout Italy and I
Europe were certain. They heard j
the Vatican radio speaker shout ,
exultantly: "A pope is elected."
Confusion
The scene around the Vatican
was one of incredible confusion. |
