# Band Makes Merry Music Down South
## 
### Camille Petersen Staff Editor 
The elevator door opened . . .
and there in full view of those in
the hotel lobby was a fold-up bed
with a pair of Stanford band
pants protruding.
All of a sudden the feet began
to wiggle, and a closer look re
vealed bandster Bob Martin's
head at the other side.
This was but one of the many
highlights of the 112 all - male
marching band's annual trip
south with the team.
It all started about 9:15 Friday
night at the train depot as the
group assembled to board the
Southern Pacific to Los Angeles.
Regular passengers were seen in
thoughtful discussion — probably
debating whether or not to take
a different train.

Comments on the buses to the
USC campus to rehearse Satur
day morning ran something like
"Oh, hell, I'm sitting on my
church key;" and (out the win
dow) "The Redcoats are coming!"
After a serious rehearsal and
lunch al the USC cafeteria it was
back on the buses and off to the
game. Even director Shuchat and
family did not escape the "Out!
Out! Out!" calls when he got on
the bus. There were relatively
few Skyrocket yells at the girls
but a good many "Sergeant Joe
Friday" yells at the policemen on
duty.
For its portion of the half-time
the band presented its Irving Ber
lin show. It was the usual top
performance.
On ( Ik* Town
Finally, about 5 p.m. the band
converged on the New Hotel
Clark; rooms wore assigned; and
off the members went on the
town . . . some to Hollywood,
some to movies . . . some to Clin
ton's Cafeteria for dinner. In fact
half the band was there at some
time.
The train for home left about
8:30 a.m. Sunday, and professors
please take note: books appeared
and were used for most of the
trip.
Finally the train reached San
Jose. The cries of "Stop Thief!"
were heard on the platform. The
"Keystone Cops" (rank 13 of the
band headed by right guide Dave
Scarf) came dashing off the train
to the rescue. As was hoped, the
stunt caused many puzzled looks
and laughs from the crowd.
Tired but happy the group left
the train, slightly the worse for
wear, at 5:40 p.m. . . . just in
time for some of the members to
dash to campus to hash.
Quickly the hotel auditor ship
ped the strange cargo back to the
.'iJih floor from whence it tunic.

Regular passengers were seen in
thoughtful discussion — probably
debating whether or not to take
a different train.

Comments on the buses to the
USC campus to rehearse Satur
day morning ran something like
"Oh, hell, I'm sitting on my
church key;" and (out the win
dow) "The Redcoats are coming!"
After a serious rehearsal and
lunch al the USC cafeteria it was
back on the buses and off to the
game. Even director Shuchat and
family did not escape the "Out!
Out! Out!" calls when he got on
the bus. There were relatively
few Skyrocket yells at the girls
but a good many "Sergeant Joe
Friday" yells at the policemen on
duty.
For its portion of the half-time
the band presented its Irving Ber
lin show. It was the usual top
performance.
On ( Ik* Town
Finally, about 5 p.m. the band
converged on the New Hotel
Clark; rooms wore assigned; and
off the members went on the
town . . . some to Hollywood,
some to movies . . . some to Clin
ton's Cafeteria for dinner. In fact
half the band was there at some
time.
The train for home left about
8:30 a.m. Sunday, and professors
please take note: books appeared
and were used for most of the
trip.
Finally the train reached San
Jose. The cries of "Stop Thief!"
were heard on the platform. The
"Keystone Cops" (rank 13 of the
band headed by right guide Dave
Scarf) came dashing off the train
to the rescue. As was hoped, the
stunt caused many puzzled looks
and laughs from the crowd.
Tired but happy the group left
the train, slightly the worse for
wear, at 5:40 p.m. . . . just in
time for some of the members to
dash to campus to hash.
Quickly the hotel auditor ship
ped the strange cargo back to the
.'iJih floor from whence it tunic.
The elevator door opened . . .
and there in full view of those in
the hotel lobby was a fold-up bed
with a pair of Stanford band
pants protruding.
All of a sudden the feet began
to wiggle, and a closer look re
vealed bandster Bob Martin's
head at the other side.
This was but one of the many
highlights of the 112 all - male
marching band's annual trip
south with the team.
It all started about 9:15 Friday
night at the train depot as the
group assembled to board the
Southern Pacific to Los Angeles.
Regular passengers were seen in
thoughtful discussion — probably
