Tilt. Axk will come out. And before Hig Game. Legislature has
reconsidered its action of Oct. 16 and Thursday night instructed
the student financial manager to have The Axe installed with all

We contended —and apparently the other members of Legis
lature agree —that bringing The Axe out before Hi«jc Game will
build spirit before the game, which, in our minds, is the time it
should he linilt.
We hope that by bringing out The Axe now there will be a
unification of spirit and the traditions for which The Axe stands.
