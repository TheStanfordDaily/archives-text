# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## The 						Student Press 
### 
In a recent editorial, the Uni
versity of Minnesota Daily set
forth a case for freedom of the
college press. Like The Stanford
Daily, the Minnesota Daily is not
beset with problems of outside
censorship and control, but they
recognize, as do we, that these
problems exist on other campus
newspapers.
The Minnesota Daily makes its
points as follows:
"A resolution on freedom of
the press was almost voted
down at a National Student As
sociation (NSA) convention
held this summer.
"The strong feeling of nearly
half the delegates from colleges
and universities throughout the
United States seemed to be that
while the commercial press de
served the constitutional guaran
tee of freedom, the same principle
should not apply to the college
press.
"It is true that the student
press has not been so lucky as we
on many campuses throughout
the country. It is also true that
press freedom is not something
that can be taken for granted.
"Part of the reason for restric
tions on some student publica
tions was represented by a large
percentage of students attending
the NSA convention. Their sug
gestions ranged from complete
control by the school administra
tion to a written list of rules and
regulations. They seemed to have
difficulty in adjusting to the idea
of college press freedom, with
the major restriction being 'the
conscience of the editors.'
"As a result, on many cam
puses the student newspaper is
little more than a spokesman
tor the group in control.
"II is our opinion that the Daily
should present an accurate pic
ture of campus life. For the most
part, this picture will present the
University community in a favor
able light. Only the most rabid

radical assumes that under the
usually peaceful surface there's a
hotbed of crime and corruption.
"But during the year, stories
will come up that might add a less
flattering touch to the picture. As
a part of the news of the campus,
these stories cannot legitimately
be kept out of print.
"Our criterion must be that if
it is of value for our readers to be
aware of any specific piece of
news we have a responsibility to
print it.
"Misuse or abuse of our free
dom of the press is not a part
of the editorial policy. We ap
preciate and value it too much
for that."
Traditionally, at the beginning
of each new volume, The Daily
has set forth its goals for the
year. This year we broke tradi
tion and did not write that edito
rial. This is because we feel the
goals are evident: to serve, edu
cate and inform the campus com
munity.
We have been constantly ques
tioned: What is The Daily going
to crusade on this year? We feel
that too often crusades have been
begun for the sake of crusading,
and without adequate informa
tion in the hands of the crusaders
or the readers. At the moment
our reporters are working quietly
and diligently to bring this infor
mation to our readers and when
the facts on various issues are
known, the readers will know The
Daily's stand.
While we have "feelers" out
into all corners of the campus,
we cannot know everything that
comes to the minds of residents
of our community. It is for this
reason that we invited letters
from our readers- not only to
clear up misconceptions on sto
ries printed in The Daily, or to
occasionally praise or criticize
The Daily, but also to present
new ideas for the staff and for
our readers.

Traditionally, at the beginning
of each new volume, The Daily
has set forth its goals for the
year. This year we broke tradi
tion and did not write that edito
rial. This is because we feel the
goals are evident: to serve, edu
cate and inform the campus com
munity.
We have been constantly ques

to crusade on this year? We feel
that too often crusades have been
begun for the sake of crusading,
and without adequate informa

or the readers. At the moment
our reporters are working quietly
and diligently to bring this infor

the facts on various issues are
known, the readers will know The

While we have "feelers" out

we cannot know everything that

occasionally praise or criticize
The Daily, but also to present
new ideas for the staff and for
our readers.
