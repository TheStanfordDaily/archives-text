# 'Question' Tells Prison Horrors
## 
### A Review By C.L. Payne 
THE QUESTION, Henri Alleg,
"Introduction" by Jean and Paul
Sartre, Brazil ler, $2.95, 123 pp.
Henri Alleg is a former editor
of a suppresse d Communist
Algerian newspaper who was
seized by French paratroopers in
Algiers and interrogated under
torture for some months. "The
Question" is Alleg's account of
his ordeal.
The book is not designed for
those who have weak stomachs.
For immediately after being cap
tured Alleg is ordered to undress
and tied down to "a black plank,
sweating with humidity, polluted
and sticky with vomit left, no
doubt, by previous 'customers'."
Then, surrounded by a group of
paratroopers who have gathered
"to watch the fun." Alleg has the
clasps of elect rods affixed at var
ious times to his ears, groin,
tongue, and penus while a mag
neto sends electric charges
through his body. Afterwards,
still affixed to the board, he is
doused with cold water, and then

picked up and carried to a kitchen
where a rubber tube affixed to a
faucet is inserted in his mouth
so that he is prevented from eject
ing it. The water then is turned
on. All of this is merely a prelude
to his being burned with matches,
first on the nipples of his breast
and then on the soles of his feet,
and injected with "truth serum."
After each ordeal Alleg is asked
the question, "Will you talk?"
However, though this is the
question referred to by the title
of the book, a far more important
one is raised by the book itself
and formulated by Jean-Paul Sar
tre in the "Introduction" (which
should be read last, not first.)
That is, regardless of Alleg's pol
itical affiliations and activities,
what does the conduct of the
French authorities toward him
say about the moral condition of
the French as a people and all of
us as fellow human beings? Per
haps in answer to this, "The
Question" has been banned by the
government of France.
