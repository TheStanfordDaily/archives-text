# TRAGEDY
## Roble Coed Took Own Life Friday 
### 
A Stanford freshman woman,
apparently depressed about doing
badly in her studies, was found
dead of a self-inflicted bullet
wound in her room at Roble Fri
day afternoon at 4.
Anita Louise Tehhetts, 18,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. C.
Tebbetts of Long Beach, shot her
self in the right temple with a
.38-caliber revolver about 2 p.m.
Friday, according to Santa Clara I
County Deputy Coroner George
Hanna.
Mrs. Ruby Hughes, Roble direc-

tor, became
alarmed later in
th e afternoon
when she found
Miss Tebbetts'
door locked and
received no re
sponse upon
knocking an d
calling to the
girl. Miss Teb
betts was found
lying on her bed
after firemen
had forced open

the door. Letters from her par
ents, indicating her concern about
studies and classes, and a note to
her mother were found in the dis
ordered room.
Enrolled at SC
Miss Tebbetts. an honor grad
uate of the Woodrow Wilson
High School in Long Beach, had
attended a semester at Long
Beach State College before enroll
ing at the University of Southern
California this September. After
12 days there, she withdrew to
register at Stanford, which she
attended for 25 days before her
death.
Associate Dean of Students
William G. Craig said that Miss
Tebbetts had been worried about
her studies, and had had several
conferences with University offi
cials and her dormitory director.
Her parents visited her last week
end and tried to convince her that
she had no reason to worry about
failing her classes, though her de
spondency had caused her grades
to drop somewhat.
Periodic Depressions
"Anita was a very anxious per
son, subject to periods of depres
sion," Craig said. "Academic pres
sure was only one factor in her fi
nal decision." "She was a lovely
girl—this is a great tragedy," he
added.
The .38-caliber revolver and
shells were purchased at the Stan
ford Sports Shop on EI Camino,
according to the coroner's office.
There is a 24-hour waiting period
after the purchase of such a
weapon before the purchaser may
take possession of the gun, but
Miss Tebbetts waited a full four
days before picking up the re
volver Oct. 22.
Arrangements have been made
through the Tinney Funeral
Home in Palo Alto for a private
Memorial Park. There will be no
interment today at the Alta Mesa
public services.

Enrolled at SC
Miss Tebbetts. an honor grad
uate of the Woodrow Wilson
High School in Long Beach, had
attended a semester at Long
Beach State College before enroll
ing at the University of Southern
California this September. After
12 days there, she withdrew to
register at Stanford, which she
attended for 25 days before her
death.
Associate Dean of Students
William G. Craig said that Miss
Tebbetts had been worried about
her studies, and had had several
conferences with University offi
cials and her dormitory director.
Her parents visited her last week
end and tried to convince her that
she had no reason to worry about
failing her classes, though her de
spondency had caused her grades
to drop somewhat.
Periodic Depressions
"Anita was a very anxious per
son, subject to periods of depres
sion," Craig said. "Academic pres
sure was only one factor in her fi
nal decision." "She was a lovely
girl—this is a great tragedy," he
added.
The .38-caliber revolver and
shells were purchased at the Stan
ford Sports Shop on EI Camino,
according to the coroner's office.
There is a 24-hour waiting period
after the purchase of such a
weapon before the purchaser may
take possession of the gun, but
Miss Tebbetts waited a full four
days before picking up the re
volver Oct. 22.
Arrangements have been made
through the Tinney Funeral
Home in Palo Alto for a private
Memorial Park. There will be no
interment today at the Alta Mesa
public services.
