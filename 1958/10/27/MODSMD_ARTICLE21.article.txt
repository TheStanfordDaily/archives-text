# Farm Not Alone In Moon Traditions

(Editor's Note: For those I
who haven't checked their so- I
cial calendars lately, the follow
ing article is a reminder that
tonight is the night of the full
moon, and Stanford has its
own tradition ahout the moon.)
The moon has given rise to
more sense and nonsense than
any other unearthly object.
And the idea of getting to it is
not new, the National Geographic
Society notes. In A.D. 160 a Greek
satirist described an imaginary
trip to the moon. Ancient ob
servers recognized the lunar ef
fect on tides.
The public was looking, too.
People in every time and place
have convinced themselves, wilh
out inhibition, of numerous ways
in which the moon influences far
more than tides ■ and lovers.
Why not weather, plants, animals,
even man's daily affairs?
Charmer and a Charm
Much moon lore is whimsical.
A maiden who drinks while wine
and rose water, then looks at the
moon through a silk scarf, for in
stance, will see the face of her
future husband. The best of all
lucky charms is the left hind paw
of a rabbit killed in a graveyard,
by a cross-eyed person, in the
dark of the moon.
Potatoes should be planted in
the dark of the moon, preferably 1
on Good Friday; peas, in the light
of the moon. The general idea,
however, is to sow root crops be
tween the first quarter and the
full moon, and leafy plants when
it is waning.
Clear Moon, Frost Soon
Weather-making, in folklore, is
the moon's great forte. There are
numerous rhymes of prognostica
tion, such as:

Palc> moon doth rain,
Rod moon doth blow,
White moon doth
Neither rain nor snow.
An upright crescent moon holds
no water, thus means a wet
month. If the crescent lies on its
back, cupping the water, there's
no need to keep the mackintoshes
handy. A full moon gobbles up
the clouds.
A ring around the moon is not
to be ignored. If the halo encir
cles more than five stars, the*
weather will be cold and vice
versa. In another version, the
number of haloed stars foretells
the days before a storm.

month. If the crescent lies on its
back, cupping the water, there's
no need to keep the mackintoshes
handy. A full moon gobbles up
the clouds.
A ring around the moon is not
to be ignored. If the halo encir
cles more than five stars, the*
weather will be cold and vice
versa. In another version, the
number of haloed stars foretells
the days before a storm.
(Editor's Note: For those I
who haven't checked their so- I
cial calendars lately, the follow
ing article is a reminder that
tonight is the night of the full
moon, and Stanford has its
own tradition ahout the moon.)
The moon has given rise to
more sense and nonsense than
any other unearthly object.
And the idea of getting to it is
not new, the National Geographic
Society notes. In A.D. 160 a Greek
satirist described an imaginary
trip to the moon. Ancient ob
servers recognized the lunar ef
fect on tides.
The public was looking, too.
People in every time and place
have convinced themselves, wilh
out inhibition, of numerous ways
in which the moon influences far
more than tides ■ and lovers.
Why not weather, plants, animals,
even man's daily affairs?
Charmer and a Charm
Much moon lore is whimsical.
A maiden who drinks while wine
and rose water, then looks at the
moon through a silk scarf, for in
stance, will see the face of her
future husband. The best of all
lucky charms is the left hind paw
of a rabbit killed in a graveyard,
by a cross-eyed person, in the
dark of the moon.
Potatoes should be planted in
the dark of the moon, preferably 1
on Good Friday; peas, in the light
of the moon. The general idea,
however, is to sow root crops be
tween the first quarter and the
full moon, and leafy plants when
it is waning.
Clear Moon, Frost Soon
Weather-making, in folklore, is
the moon's great forte. There are
numerous rhymes of prognostica
tion, such as:

Palc> moon doth rain,
Rod moon doth blow,
White moon doth
Neither rain nor snow.
An upright crescent moon holds
no water, thus means a wet
month. If the crescent lies on its
back, cupping the water, there's
no need to keep the mackintoshes
handy. A full moon gobbles up
the clouds.
