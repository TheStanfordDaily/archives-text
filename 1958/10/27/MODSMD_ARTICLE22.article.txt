# Men's Housing: New Stern Hall Plan
## 
### Bob Latham 
The environment of the Stan
ford undergraduate male is un
dergoing significant changes,
admits William Craig, Dean of
Men, and these changes are a
definite administrative policy re
sulting from housing modifica
tion.
The situation which has grown
over the last several years and
which is now being carefully torn
down is the existance of wide
differences between fraternities,
eating clubs and independents'
housing.
The fraternities are generally
regarded as the most social, tight -
knit and the least academic of the
three groups. The independents,
of which Stein houses the major
ity, are considered to be the most
apathetic, or as one student ex
pressed it, "dead socially." The
eating clubs occupy an intermedi
ate position.
The goal for which the admin
istration is striving has been
termed "meaningful living" by-
Dean Craig and David Larimer,
Director of Stern Hall.
Exactly what the administra
tion means by the term "mean
ingful living" is illustrated by the

changes being made at Stern
Hall.
Last year each of the wings of
the large dormatory choose a
name for themselves and thus
; became Fremont or Serra House
j instead of Stern, Wing 2 or Wing
i 6. With the completion of Mur
j and Burbank, Stern is now com
i posed of eight houses, each named
after a famous Californian and
each with a separate identity.
In an attempt to transfer the
names from paint to spirit, some
revisions in the residence hall
policies went into effect June 1,
1958. These revisions give soph
omore priority in filling vacan
cies. This is a reversal designed
to build more returning students
into each house.
Meal tickets are now limited to
occupants of Stern and the under
graduates living at the Village.
"The presence of Off Campus stu
dents at Stein dinning rooms is",
according to a policy statement
from the Housing Office, "a de
terrent to the development of the
house system."
Another revision requires that
all new occupants of Stern agree
to stay for all three quarters of
the academic year. The only ex
ception being that those men who

pledge a fraternity during this
Autumn Quarter will be permit
ted to move to the fraternity at !
the end of t he quarter.
The most outstanding feature'
is the faculty-student relationship
which is fostered. Muir and Bur
bank are connccted with a Fac-'

ulty Resident family composed of
Dr. and Mrs. W. H. Stone and
their two children.
The faculty resident lives in a
house attached to the dormitory,
eats with the students and is
available for advice and conver
sation. Dr. Stone is given time

â–  off from his teaching duties so
that he can devote adequate time
to his resident obligations.
In addition to the Faculty Resi
dent, each house has four Faculty
Associates. The faculty associ
ates may eat in the dining rooms
and ask guests whenever they

please. They are obligated to eat
at least one dinner per week with
the students and to make them
selves available to the house. The
faculty associates formally con
nected with Muir are R. A. llell
iwell, F. W. McCord and O. A
Pease. Burbank is associated with
W. R. Briggs, J. D. Scowcroft and
A. F. Wright.
In addition to those formally
connected, students are free to
invite others. W. W. Harman has
informally become a faculty asso
ciate, and, according to Dr. Stone,
it is hoped that many more will
be added during the year.
Another feature of the new
Stern plan that is the result of
administration policy is a library
in each new home. Each library
was started with $2,000 and the
houses vote part of their dues
each year for their library's sub
stance and expansion. There are
two paid librarians for each li
brary who work 40 hours per
week. According to Dr. Stone, the
library is the best received part
! of the new program.
A wide variety of students at
titudes toward the ho u si nor

changes is found among inde
pendents.
Mike I.ohwdii, Social Chairman,
Fremont House: "I think Stern
needs more unity and spirit. A
mild l'orm of the house system
might create a more friendly at
mosphere."
Dave Arnold, Village: "Why
should they want us to conform?"
Mi: had Kutzev, Muir: "It's
better than any other system ex
isting here at Stanford at the
present time, however there is
room for definite improvement
such as a more liberalized system
whereby women would be admit
ted to individual rooms."
John Schwarz, Off Campus:
"The University shouldn't force
the change."
Terry .McNulfy, Burbank: "Nice
idea, but no one wants to work
hard enough to get it going."
A more concrete expression of
the administration ideal is to be
found in the two houses of Stern,
Muir and Burbank. There houses
have several new features which
will probably be incorporated into
all undergraduate housing, in
cluding fraternities.
