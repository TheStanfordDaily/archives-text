# Card Harriers Meet Disaster in Southland; Wallace Runs Third Behind Truex, Riding
## 
### 
Closer, but still no cigar, was
the story once again for Stan
ford's cross-country forces on
their annual trip to the Southland
as USC and UCLA eked out vic
tories Saturday on the Bruin
course.
In triangular scoring, it was:
USC 32, UCLA 43, Stanford 48.
The Bruins won their dual meet
with the Cards, 23-2G, and the Tro
jans came out on top by a some
what more decisive 23-34 score.
Max T r u e x, Ken Riding and
Keith Wallace led their respective
Trojan, Bruin and Indian teams.
Truex pulled out in the final mile
to win the four-mile race in 22:02,

with Riding 10 seconds back.
Wallace, who led with a mile
and one-half to go, fell back com
ing down the final hill and ran
third in 22:29.
Bob Monzingo recovered from a
fall in the early stages of the race
to come on strong for a sixth
place finish behind Fernando Leon
and Wes McLeod of the Trojans.
Doug Martin ran ninth for the
Tribe, and fourth-man Larry Suel
zle came in 14th. Sueizle was
hampered by an ankle twist he
sustained during the race, but the
injury isn't severe enough to keep
him out of action this week.
Freshmen John North way and

Kim Maxwell ran near the back
of thr pack, both still showing a
need to gain plenty of team-run
ning experience before coach Pay
ton Jordan can count on them for
top finishes.
