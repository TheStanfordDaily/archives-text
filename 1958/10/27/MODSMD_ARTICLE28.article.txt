## Scene Bruins' Coach Praises 'Superior Card Team' 
### Dick Barnes 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 25 â€”To
hear Billy Barnes tell it.. Stanford
has a darned strong football team.
Virtually all that the acting
UCLA head coach had for report
ers after his team's surprise 21-19
loss to Stanford was praise for
the Indians.
"We vv e r e facing a superior
team, as far as we're concerned,"
said Barnes in the Coliseum locker
room. "We played well, and the
kids didn't do anything wrong
they |Stanford| were just a lot
stronger, as it looked from the
sidelines."
Two big topics of post - game
conversation in the silent Bruin
quarters were (1) the effect of
losing seven seniors and (2) what

caused the penalty that deprived
UCLA of a long touchdown pass
in the first period.
Barnes handled the senior ques
tion simply and without the cry
ing-towel act that has been typi
cal of UCLA supporters such as
their game sportscaster, Sam.
He just said, "Well, take seven
of their seniors off the team and
figure it that way." And then it
was on to the next question.
Barnes said guard Joe Harper
had been the Bruin called for be
ing illegally downfield on the 76-
yard Chuck K e nda 1 1 -to - John
Brown pass that might have knot
ted the score.
"But it wasn't Harper's fault,"
emphasized Barnes. It seems that
a running play had been called,
so Harper was naturally headed
downfield on his blocking assign
ment. But as Kendall rolled to the
side he spotted Brown in the clear
j at midfield and cut loose with the
| pass, just hoping there wouldn't
I be an infraction. But there was.
