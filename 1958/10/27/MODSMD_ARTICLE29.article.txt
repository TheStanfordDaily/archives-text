# THE 						LAST LAUGH
## Happy Uclans Silenced By Big Indian Victory 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 25 They were laughing in Westwood last
night—at Stanford, at the PCC, at former PCC Commissioner Vie
Schmidt, at Head Coach Jack Curtice—they had a good laugh, those
Uclans did. They laughed right up until kickoff time in the Coliseum
at 2 p.m.
But not long after that you'd have thought they'd forgotten how

to laugh. And about two and one
halt hours later, while the Stan
ford Indians were walking off the
field with a 21-19 win tucked neat
ly under their belts, those pretty
loud Southlanders were a surpris
ingly silent group.
And, down under the Coliseum,
Curtices' 1 raveling tribe of 37 In
dians took a little time to sit down
and smile.
It was way back in 1948 that
the Indians last topped the Bruins
in the Southland, 34-14. So. after
four losses in a row down there,
it was a pretty happy day all
around— in the local camp.
What beat UCLA's Bruins to
day? Down here they have a few
answers that this writer won't
consider, but it looked like de
termination to me. And it felt like
determination to the team, too.
Halfback Skip Face, who left
footed the Bruins to death with
three straight extra-pointers, and
did all right as a runner too 46
yards in six carries—summed it
up pretty well:
Hard Work
"We've been working hard for
this one. We felt like we couldn't
lot our coaches down again. We've
all done it, independently, at one
time or another but we wanted
this too bad to do it today."
And how was Jack Curtice, the

humorist, afier his first Smog
vilie victory? Pretty funny. "Like
I told Billy | Barnes |, I guess you
just didn't properly defense our
left-footed kicker" — ihis is what
Curtice had to quip first. But he
was quick to add two more seri
ous comments: "UCLA has plenty
of speed and agility" and "I think
we wanted the win more."
OF Cactus had a tough time of
it trying to pick out his outstand
ing boys—he had a tribe of 'em
at work jloday.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 25 They were laughing in Westwood last
night—at Stanford, at the PCC, at former PCC Commissioner Vie
Schmidt, at Head Coach Jack Curtice—they had a good laugh, those
Uclans did. They laughed right up until kickoff time in the Coliseum
at 2 p.m.
But not long after that you'd have thought they'd forgotten how

to laugh. And about two and one
halt hours later, while the Stan
ford Indians were walking off the
field with a 21-19 win tucked neat
ly under their belts, those pretty
loud Southlanders were a surpris
ingly silent group.
And, down under the Coliseum,
Curtices' 1 raveling tribe of 37 In
dians took a little time to sit down
and smile.
It was way back in 1948 that
the Indians last topped the Bruins
in the Southland, 34-14. So. after
four losses in a row down there,
it was a pretty happy day all
around— in the local camp.
What beat UCLA's Bruins to
day? Down here they have a few
answers that this writer won't
consider, but it looked like de
termination to me. And it felt like
determination to the team, too.
Halfback Skip Face, who left
footed the Bruins to death with
three straight extra-pointers, and
did all right as a runner too 46
yards in six carries—summed it
up pretty well:
Hard Work
"We've been working hard for
this one. We felt like we couldn't
lot our coaches down again. We've
all done it, independently, at one
time or another but we wanted
this too bad to do it today."
And how was Jack Curtice, the

humorist, afier his first Smog
vilie victory? Pretty funny. "Like
I told Billy | Barnes |, I guess you
just didn't properly defense our
left-footed kicker" — ihis is what
Curtice had to quip first. But he
was quick to add two more seri
ous comments: "UCLA has plenty
of speed and agility" and "I think
we wanted the win more."
OF Cactus had a tough time of
it trying to pick out his outstand
ing boys—he had a tribe of 'em
at work jloday.
