# Humorist Interview
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
"No, I can't attribute my mor
bid sense of humor to my child
hood or my family. It's all my
own fault!" smiled Tom Lohrer in
an interview with The Daily fol
lowing his entertaining two-hour
show last Saturday night.
Lehrer, ex-I-larvard math prof
turned musician, played to a
packed Memorial Auditorium au
dience and rendered such sadistic
songs as "Oedipus Rex." the "Old
Dope Peddler" and the "Maso
chism Tango," interspersed with
such positive advice as "Life is
like a sewer; you get out of it
what you put into it."
Apologizing for his cold ("I get
one every time I come to Califor
nia" >, he stated that his type of
macabre humor "has always been
a characteristic of the United
States, and now shows more of a
trend toward revolt than ever."
Off-stage, Lehrer is less of an
extrovert and is extremely friend
ly. A bachelor ("Submit applica
tions in triplicate, please"), he
spends his leisure time doing
what normal people do â€” walk
around and talk to people, play
the piano and drink."
Now on his way to Los Ange
les, Lehrer plans to put out an
other record ("Rut it will be at
least two years") and publish a
book.
