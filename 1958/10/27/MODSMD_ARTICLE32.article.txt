# Bears Eye Rose Bowl
## 
### Associated Press 
The bubble that was supposed
o pop is bigger than ever. As a
matter of fact, it's beginning to
ook more and more like a bal
loon—one that could ferry the
California Bears right into the
Rose Bowl.
The Bears, underdogs Saturday
for the second straight week,
sprang a surprise for the second
jon Ducks 23-6. General Joe Kapp
and his California troops emerged
from this impressive exercise
with a Coast Conference record
>112 3-0 and four PCC games to go.
This Saturday ihe Bears meet
their nearest rival in the run for
ihe Rose Bowl when they go to
Corvallis for an engagement with
Oregon State. Cal still has UCLA,
Washinton and Stanford left after
this weekend, but light now the
Beavers look like the biggest haz
ard left in the Bears' way.
Oregon Slate ran its PCC rec
ord to 3-1 Saturday by nudging
Washington 14-12, while Southern
California left Washington State
sniffing at a diminished scent of
roses by upsetting the Cougars,
14-6.
In a nonconference game, Idaho
defeated Arizona 24-16 at Tucson.
Washington State, still not out
of the Bowl picture with a 3-2 rec
ord, plays'UCLA (1-2) in Los An
geles this Saturday. Southern
California (2-2) will be at Stan
ford (2-1) and Oregon (2-2) will
meet Washington (0-3) at Seattle.
Idaho (0-3) plays another non
conference game, this time
against San Jose State at Mos
cow.
Quarterback Kapp did every
thing but lead the band at half
time as he directed his brother
Bears to their decisive victory
over Oregon at Berkeley. The 205-
pound master of the split-T ran

92 yards for one touchdown, then
plunged one yard for another and
played a key hand in Cal's third
scoring drive.
Kapp. already the PCC total of
fense leader, piled up another 191
yards 130 running and (>1 pass
ing.
Cal now has won four straight
games, one a non-conference af
fair. This is the longest winning
streak the Bears have had since
1952.
At Spokane, Southern Califor
nia got its best playmaker back
into action and the Cougars lost
theirs. Quarterback Willie Wood,
idle three games because of a
shoulder injury, directed th Tro
jans eto their first touchdown,
then teamed with halfback llil
lard Hill on a 77-yard pass play
that won the game for USC with
about two minutes to play. Hill
got behind WSC's defenders, took
the throw on the Cougar 41 and
outran his pursuers.
Washington Stale's great quar
terback, Bobby Newman, suffered
a knee injury on the third play of
the game and didn't get back in.
WSC's second • string quarter
back, Davey Wilson, also was in
jured. He left in the thirrl period.
Tailback Dainard Paulson

passed 14 yards for one Oregon
State touchdown at Portland and
ran the ball over for the two-point
conversion that made the differ
ence. Washington scored its two
touchdowns after recovering fum
bles deep in OSO territory. The
Beavers drove 79 and 89 yards for
their scores.
The Heaver victory extended

Coach Tommy Prothro's spectac
ular string of home victories.
Since Prothro took over in 1955,
OSC has not lost a game al either
Corvallis or Portland's Multno
mah Stadium. These are the kind
of odds I fiat Pete Elliott and his
Bears will be up against this week
as they try to keep the bubble
alive.

touchdowns after recovering fum
bles deep in OSO territory. The
Beavers drove 79 and 89 yards for
their scores.
The Heaver victory extended

Coach Tommy Prothro's spectac
ular string of home victories.
Since Prothro took over in 1955,
OSC has not lost a game al either
Corvallis or Portland's Multno
mah Stadium. These are the kind
of odds I fiat Pete Elliott and his
Bears will be up against this week
as they try to keep the bubble
alive.
