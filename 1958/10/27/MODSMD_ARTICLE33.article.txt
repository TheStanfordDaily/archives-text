# Frenchman's Bridge Remains Farm Legend
## 
### Judy SKlar 
In the middle of a field in the
south corner of the campus by
Frenchman's road, on perfectly
level ground, there stands an old
brick bridge.
It has several steps going up on
one side of it, several steps going

down on the other side and an
arch underneath as any sensible
bridge has. Only one detail is
missing: there is no water any
where in the vicinity, and there
is no sign that there ever was any.
The bridge by Frenchman's
Road is now a gathering place for
art students, tourists and couples
on study dates, but there was a
time when it was the center of a
sunken garden, complete with
lake, islands, and simulated ruins.
The garden was surrounded by
a six-foot stone wall, where
homes now stand. The water for
it was piped in from a stream on
the other side of the hill. The en
tire lake was built by "the
Frenchman," a famous character
of Santa Clara County in the
1.870'5. It was meant to be a
French landscape, designed to go
with his chateau to be built on the
Foothill Road hill.
The Frenchman arrived from
France in 1874 and established a
farm, a part of which is now
Stanford. He built an elaborate
irrigation system with six tunnels
cutting through a hill; he began
a library; and constructed a lake.
He registered all his property
under his governess's name. This
puzzled the people on the penin
sula, so this explanation arose.
It was rumored that the French
man had been a paymaster in the
French army at the outbreak of
the Franco-Prussian War, when
he suddenly disappeared with a
500 million franc payroll. He es
caped to the United States.
When he left here in 1880 for
Europe, it was said that he didn't
leave—he was hiding out from the
French police in the tunnels of
his irrigation system.
In 1925 this romantic story was
disproved by an article in the
''Stanford Review." It seems that
the Frenchman was actually a
banker in Bordeaux and that
when his bank failed in the panic
of the Franco-Prussian War, he
left because French law held
directors responsible. He left here
to reclaim his property when the
government changed hands.
He left behind him a legend and
his lake which exists no more.
There is only the old brick bridge
and some of the ruins in the mid
dle of the field by Frenchman's
Road.
