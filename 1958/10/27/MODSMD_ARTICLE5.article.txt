# Stanford Outplays, Outfights Baby Blue for 21-19 Victory
## Great Team Effort Ends Bruin Hopes 
### Bob Payne 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM
UCLA, both alumni and fans, fly
ing in self-pity and joyous over
the fact that it was dumping on
the old Pacific Coast Conference,
was really crying late Saturday
afternoon after the beloved Baby
Blue had been outplayed and out
fought by eleven little upstart In
dians from Stanford. The score
was 21-19.
It was a great win for the Tribe
and Coach Jack Curtice. And
even more than the "first" Wash
ington victory two weeks ago,
this was a great team effort by
the Cards.
Few Fans
The medium-sized but enthusi
astic Stanford contingent of fans
that journeyed south to make up
part of the poor crowd of 39,129
were treated to by far the tight
est and most thrilling game of the
season . . . and, from most every
point of view, the best.
UCLA had not lost a Homecom
ing game since 1919. The Bruins
fired themselves up before the
game with snide little remarks
about the Pacific Coast Confer
ence and the holier-than-thou lads
from Palo Alto, and then went
out and watched a Stanford team
that just wasn't going to be beat
en.
Superb Saturday was third
string signal - caller Sid Garber,
who directed the first quick scor
ing drive, ripped off some amaz
ing runs and generally was the
more - than - pleasant surprise of
the afternoon.
Garber Stars
When Garber was not directing
things, regular Bob Nieolet was
having a mild field day, winding
up with 10 completions in 20 tries
for 132 yards. Garbert was 6-for
-8 for 69 yards.
End Chris Burford, certainly
among the nation's finest wing
men, was brilliant again. Defen
sively, he turned in his usual stel
lar performance and while the
Cards had the ball he managed to
propel himself far into the PCC
pass • catching lead with eight
grabs for 129 yards.
Face's three perfect left-footed
conversions provided the margin
of victory and it was adequate
justice, for the last Tribe-Bruin
tilt in the Southland was won for
the Bruins on the strength of a
conversion.
UCLA's conversion attempt af
ter its first touchdown was a pass
by tailback Chuck Kendall
knocked down in the end zone.
The second time, fullback Gene
Gaines was going to try the mid
dle on the patented Bruin full
back-spinner, but Protiva had bet
ter ideas and jumped on the Baby
Blue lad before he had even got
up to the line.
Stanford scored the first time
it got the ball, and lo and behold
it was "third-stringer" Garber in
the driver's seat. After kicking
off to start festivities, the Tribe
held the Bruins with five yards in
three plays and took a punt.
Starting quarterback Bob Nieolet
had been shaken up on the first
scrimmage play.

neered this touchdown drive and made several beautiful runs.
