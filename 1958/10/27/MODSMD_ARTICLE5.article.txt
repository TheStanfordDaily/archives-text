# Stanford Outplays, Outfights Baby Blue for 21-19 Victory
## Great Team Effort Ends Bruin Hopes 
### Bob Payne 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM
UCLA, both alumni and fans, fly
ing in self-pity and joyous over
the fact that it was dumping on
the old Pacific Coast Conference,
was really crying late Saturday
afternoon after the beloved Baby
Blue had been outplayed and out
fought by eleven little upstart In
dians from Stanford. The score
was 21-19.
It was a great win for the Tribe
and Coach Jack Curtice. And
even more than the "first" Wash
ington victory two weeks ago,
this was a great team effort by
the Cards.
Few Fans
The medium-sized but enthusi
astic Stanford contingent of fans
that journeyed south to make up
part of the poor crowd of 39,129
were treated to by far the tight
est and most thrilling game of the
season . . . and, from most every
point of view, the best.
UCLA had not lost a Homecom
ing game since 1919. The Bruins
fired themselves up before the
game with snide little remarks
about the Pacific Coast Confer
ence and the holier-than-thou lads
from Palo Alto, and then went
out and watched a Stanford team
that just wasn't going to be beat
en.
Superb Saturday was third
string signal - caller Sid Garber,
who directed the first quick scor
ing drive, ripped off some amaz
ing runs and generally was the
more - than - pleasant surprise of
the afternoon.
Garber Stars
When Garber was not directing
things, regular Bob Nieolet was
having a mild field day, winding
up with 10 completions in 20 tries
for 132 yards. Garbert was 6-for
-8 for 69 yards.
End Chris Burford, certainly
among the nation's finest wing
men, was brilliant again. Defen
sively, he turned in his usual stel
lar performance and while the
Cards had the ball he managed to
propel himself far into the PCC
pass • catching lead with eight
grabs for 129 yards.
Face's three perfect left-footed
conversions provided the margin
of victory and it was adequate
justice, for the last Tribe-Bruin
tilt in the Southland was won for
the Bruins on the strength of a
conversion.
UCLA's conversion attempt af
ter its first touchdown was a pass
by tailback Chuck Kendall
knocked down in the end zone.
The second time, fullback Gene
Gaines was going to try the mid
dle on the patented Bruin full
back-spinner, but Protiva had bet
ter ideas and jumped on the Baby
Blue lad before he had even got
up to the line.
Stanford scored the first time
it got the ball, and lo and behold
it was "third-stringer" Garber in
the driver's seat. After kicking
off to start festivities, the Tribe
held the Bruins with five yards in
three plays and took a punt.
Starting quarterback Bob Nieolet
had been shaken up on the first
scrimmage play.
With the bail on the Card 37,

the 22-yard first-period play are Phil Parslow (38) and Chuck Ken
dall (11). Garber, the third Tribe quarterback, earned ids spurs
with an outstanding performance against the Uclans as he engi
neered this touchdown drive and made several beautiful runs.
things began to happen. Garber
gave to Doug Dirk for a three
yard pick-up and then kept it him
self for 10 pretty yards and a first
down. It was the first of several
dandy excursions by Sidney dur
ing the afternoon.
Takes to Air
Then he decided to act more
like a quarterback and fired a
nine-yarder to Burford inside Cal
territory. Dick dove for two
yards and the first down. Then
.Sid took to the air.
He rifled one to Joel Freis on
the 32 for seven yards. Then he
found Burford again, and a first
down, on the 22. At that point,
Garber decided he couldn't wait
any longer to get the Tribe on the
scoreboard, so he lofted one to
ward Burford on the two and
Chris gathered it in and fell into
the end zone with the six points.
The Bruins bounced right back
here with fine running by Chuck
Kendall and Marv Luster to move
quickly into Card territory. Then
Kendall found quarterback Art
Phillips (quarterbacks catch
passes in a single wing some
times) out in front at the Tribe
35, and he dashed down the side
line for the score.
It now happened that a few un
knowing Bruin fans might have
been wondering what Jack Cur
tice was doing putting Bob Nico
let in at quarterback after Gar

ber'.s sensational display.
Nicolet showed them why in
short order. A couple of short
pops by Jim Byrer and two Nico
let passes, to John Bond and then
Irv Nikolai, got this drive going.
Then Nicolet took Garber's hint
and fired to Burford, who took
the ball on the Card 48 and
thwarted one Bruin tackier after
another before he was finally
stopped on the 27.
Nicolet Scores
Byrer hit inside left end for 20
yards to the seven. Mac Wylie
drove to the four. After Byrer
had been stopped at the line, the

score came quickly. With the
Bruins worried to death by the
roll-out pass to Burford, Nicolet
did roll out, saw everybody play
ing pass defense, and casually
trotted over for his first touch
down of the season.
On its first play after the kick
off, UCLA sent its fans wild with
joy as Kendall found John Brown ;
flying down the sidelines and
struck to him for a 76-yard scor
ing pass play. But it all started

out as a running play and there
was an ineligible Bruin lineman
downfield and the penalty called
it back.
The Bruins had to wait until
the second quarter to get their
TD. It was Kendall again, firing
11 yards to wingback Marv Lus
ter for the score to climax a 61-
yard, 10-play drive.
UCLA showed paydirt inten
tions the first time it got the ball
in the third quarter, but the Tribe
thwarted them on fourth-and-nine
a the Stanford 24. Then, with
Nicolet at the helm, the Cards
struck for the clinching TD.
Face Scampers
Some fine runs by Dick and
three completed tosses by Nicolet,
one to Freis and two to Nikolai,
got the ball to the Bruin 30. Dick
shot up the middle for nine and
then Skip Face tore around left
end for 21 yards and the TD.
Mac Wylie thwarted the next
Bruin drive by intercpting Ken
dall's pass on the eight and re
turning it to the 15. But on the
second play, Nicolet passed into
the hands of John Brown and the
Bruin speedster streaked 26 yards
for the final score.
That was the last of the scor
ing, but not the last of the excite
ment. The Garber directed Tribe
got inside the 10 on one drive, but
was stopped. At which point
Roch Conklin intercepted a Bruin
pass to set another just-short
drive in motion.
