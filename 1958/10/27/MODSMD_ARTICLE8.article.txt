# 'Odd SC' Decorations Take Shape on Campus
## 
### 
The cry of "take a study break
and come out to stuff" will be
heard beginning today in the ma
jority of campus living groups as
work on house decorations gets
into full swing for Homecoming.
More than 40 living groups are

building scaffolds, chicken wire
frames and trying to guess how
the decoration across the street
ties in with Homecoming's "Odd
SC" theme.

House decorations were an in
novation last year, replacing the
old Homccoming parade. This
year's innovation will be a spe
cial program for alumni, friends
and students preceding Satur
day's game.
According to Homecoming co
chairmen Julie Hirsch and Fred
Betts, Saturday's "Alumni Pro
gram" was designed to draw
alumni and Stanford friends to
the campus, giving them a reason
to visit the campus earlier than
game time.
"We are trying to cement rela
tions for the school by having the
visitors really see the campus. We
feel that they will gain interest
from contact with students and
old classmates," they added.
Students, too, are invited to at
tend the program on the Row,
scheduled from 10 a.m. until
game time. Included in the enter
tainment will be the band, cheer
leaders and pompon girls, Coach
Jack Curtice and the Stanford
team's co-captains, the Men's Glee
Club and other student entertain
ment.
Winners of the house decora
tion competition will be an
nounced.
