# Tuesday Series To Salute T.R.
## 
### 
Prof. Thomas Barclay will speak on "Theodore Roosevelt and the
American Presidency" at 7:30 tonight in Memorial Auditorium.
Dr. Barclay, retired professor of political science, is giving his talk
as par t of Stanford's observance of the Theodore Roosevelt Centen
nial, which is being celebrated nationally by a government commis-

sion directed by Herman Hage
dorn of New York, historian and
writer.
Hagedorn, in a letter* to Presi
dent Sterling, stressed that "T.R."
was not being glorified as a man
but for "what he has to say to us
today."
The purpose, he wrote, is to
"carry on at home and across the
world his fight for an alert, re
sponsible, inspired and inspiring
democracy" which cuts across "all
divisions of party, creed, national
ity, color or race."
"It's hard to come to grips with
Theodore Roosevelt," Clinton Ros
siter, an authority on Presidents,
has said, "just as it is with any
boy of Â«ix."
"When they do come to grips,
historians usually put him in the
upper fourth of the presidential
class," commented Associated
Press columnist Arthur Edson in
commemoration of the centennial.
"He may have been the eternal
all-American boy, but he left be
hind solid accomplishments in
conservation, in his uncanny
knack to inspire others to work
for good government, in foreign
affairs."
As T.R. ended his presidential
term he remarked frankly: "I
like my job. The burdens will be
laid aside with a great deal of
regret."
