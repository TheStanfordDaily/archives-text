# PROPOSITION 18
## Law Forum Sponsors Fawcett-Davis Debate 
### 
"The abolition of right-to-work legislation is a grant of compulsive
power to a private association in our society," said Dr. Claude Faw
cett, regional educational director of the National Association of
Manufacturers, at a Stanford Law Forum debate Friday on Propo
sition 18 of the November ballot.
Taking the opposite view on the so-called "right-to-work" legisla-

tion was Roland C. Davis, San
Francisco union attorney and
Stanford Law School graduate.
Said Davis, "Individual work
ing people are not equal to their
employers in bargaining. There
are no responsible working per
sons, in unions or not, who advo
cate the abolition of the union
shop."
Davis explained that in states
with right-to-work laws are the
nation's lowest numbers of union
members, lowest purchasing pow
er and lowest per capita earnings.
Prohibitive Law
"Proposition 18 goes far beyond
prohibiting the union shop," said
Davis. "It prohibits even forcing
employees to pay the costs of bar
gaining."
Fawcett pointed out that the
union shop imposed the will of
the majority of the workers on
the minority.
"The fundamental concept of
our government," said Fawcett,
"is not majority rule, but justice."
"The majorities in unions are
always the least skilled workers,"
he said, "and the unions make
their appeal to the non-skilled ma
jority."
Narrow Wage Differential
Fawcett pointed out that union
negotiations through the years
have tended to narrow the re
ward difference between skilled
and non-skilled workers.

"But the union shop forces the
skilled worker to give up his
right of withdrawal and of bar
gaining independently."
The debate was second in a
series of open debates on legal
political issues sponsored by the
Stanford Law Forum.
