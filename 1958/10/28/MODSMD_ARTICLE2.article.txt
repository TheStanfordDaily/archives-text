# Nobel Prize Nominees
## 
### 
Two former Stanford faculty
members and one incoming pro
fessor are among the leading can
didates for the Nobel prize in med
icine, according to rumors from
Stockholm, Sweden. Announce
ment of the award is expected
Thursday.
The three scientists are George
W. Beadle, 55, professor of biol
ogy, 1937-46; Edward L. Tatum,
48. professor of biology, 1937-45
and 1948*56; and Joshua Leder
berg, 33, to become head of the
new department of genetics of the
School of Medicine in January.
Working together at Stanford in
1940-41, Beadle and Tatum used
X-rays to induce heritable muta
tions in neurospora, a bread mold.
Their research established a basic
tenet of biochemical genetics —
that all biochemical and enzymatic
reactions are controlled by genes.
At age 21, Ledcrberg, with Ta
tum at Yale in 1946, discovered
"sexual recombination" in the bac
terium escherichia coll. Using this
phenomenon as an experimental
tool, Lederberg found evidence
ihat bacteria cells have nuclei and
gene-like units similar to those of
plant and animal cells.
Beadle, a former president of
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, is pres
ently chairman of the biology di
vision at California Institute of
Technology. Lederberg is head of
the department of medical genet
ics at the University of Wisconsin
School of Medicine.
