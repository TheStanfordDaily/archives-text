# Papacy Vote Deadlocked
## Ordeal Hard On Cardinals 
### 
VATICAN CITY (/Pi The
princes of the Roman Catholic
Church were deadlocked Monday
night in their efforts to elect a
successor to Pope Pius XII.
Two full days of balloting in
the deep secrecy of the Sistine
Chapel had failed to resolve the
issue. The 51 cardinals participat
ing presumably had completed
eight ballots.
There is little question that the
cardinals were trying to compose
their difficulties so that one of
their number can muster the .T>
votes necessary for the election
of a new supreme pontiff.
The cardinals will try again to
morrow.
Time Important
Time is important to them in
several respects. Many of Ihem
are aged, and some are infirm.
For these, the conclave must be
a hardship.
The deadlock was heralded by
smoke puffing from the little
gray chimney attached to the
wall of the Sistine Chapel. For
the fourth time its signal was in
tended to convey a negative re
sult. If the cardinals were adher
ing to rules, this meant they h;id
taken eight ballots, two each fore
noon and two each afternoon of
the two days the conclave "has
been in session.
No Signal Mix-ups'
There was no repetition of the
vast confusion of the night, be
fore, when smoke intended as
black appeared white and spread
a false report around the world
that a new pontiff had been
elected.
To insure against such mis
takes, the cardinals, acting on ihe
advice of the marshal of the con
clave, Prince Sigismundo Chigi,
added a tar by-product to the fire
in their new stove, an aide to Ihe
marshal reported. After the first
thin wisp Monday, the smoke be
came intensely black.
