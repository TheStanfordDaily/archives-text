## REPORT FROM THE BURG Berlin Visitors See Sharp Reality 
### Dave Quarles 
Perhaps not until the 63 of us
read the sign in tremendous red
block letters above Marx, Engels
and Lenin, "Der Sozialismus
Siegt" (socialism will be victori
ous), did we realize that we were
face to face with that much dis
cussed, much feared, but little un
derstood specter, Bolshevistic so
cialism.
We all knew the Bonn govern
ment har! not sent a representa
tive to the Burg to speak on East
Germany for eight hours and had
not given a sizable contribution to
our Berlin trip to provide a five
day lark.
However, not many of us antici
pated the sharp reality of the
present world situation which
jolts all .American visitors on their
first trip to Berlin.
East —West
Nowhere else in the world than
in Berlin can a person get the
juxtaposition of East and West
requisite to a clear understanding
of the appalling problem facing
the world today.
And it was precisely with this
idea in mind that the Bundes-re
publik contributed funds for our
visit and for similar visits of fu
ture Stanford students to Berlin.
The buses left the Burg early
Monday morning, Oct. 6, and
drove in 13 hours to Hannover,
where we boarded PAA and BEA
to fly to Berlin through the 20-
rnile-wide air safety zone.
At Amerika llaus
Our first morning in Berlin was
spent in the Amerika Haus, an of
fice of the U.S. Information Serv
ice. We had a lecture on the Ber
lin situation and then a tour of
the Haus and its facilities.
Perhaps some of us at first had
a skeptical attitude as to the use
fulness of the Amerika Haus, but
as we understood its services and
then at noon saw the flood of East
Berliners waiting to get into the
newspaper and periodical room,
we realized what an extremely im
portant part the Haus plays in
providing a different view of the
West to people who are allowed
to see only blatant propaganda
posters.
The Amerika Haus is located
near the first main S-Bahn stop in
1 ho West Sector on a heavily trav
eled east-west line, and thus it j
provides an accessible source of
information for East Berliners.
Crude Satire
Suffice it to say that the Com
munist "humor" magazine. Eulen
spiegel, devotes quite a few of its
pages to crude satire of the pro
grams at the Amerika Haus, one
of which, a jazz program, attract
ed altogether too many East Ger
man youths.
After a tour of the West Sector,
Ihe students went their own ways
for the evening, departing with a
strong suggestion from Dr. Eried-;
rich Strothmann that they avoid
Ihe S-Bahn.
Circulation of traffic and peo
ple from the East to the West
sector of Berlin and back is fairly
free, especially on the U - Bahn |
(subway) and the S-Bahn (fast!
elevated train). However, whereas !
the U-Bahn remains within the
city limits of Berlin, the S-Bahn j
continues into the East Zone, or
"German Democratic Republic,"
from which there is no easy re
turn for Americans and Germans
alike.
. Deep Impression
The deepest impression of the
Irip was our view of the refugee I
camps in Berlin which a person ;
must really see for himself to un- j
derstand the living conditions, the
attitudes of the refugees and all j
Ihe camps' far-reaching implica- i
lions for 1 both eastern and western
governments.
A refugee faces a long, hard |
and discouraging road before he ,
can hope to be settled in West
Germany or another Western na
tion. Five and six families live in
one room of an old factory build
ing which serves as housing. How
ever, the worst part of being a
refugee is the uncertainty.
Some East Germans are imme
diately recognized by the govern

ment on political grounds or life
endangerment. They wait perhaps
only six weeks, while other's are
recognized, but live from day to
day, hoping for months oir end for
a place to be found for them in
West Germany.
Second Chance
Unrecognized refugees live in
miserable conditions for three and
four years before their case is
even taken up again to give them
a second chance for recognition.
Despite (his grim prospect—of
which the East Germans are
aware before they even arrive in
the West Sector—life is such in
the East that 20,000 to 25,000 refu
gees pour into West Berlin every
week through the one remaining
crack in the Iron Curtain.
All of us were interested to see
the Free University of Berlin that
afternoon. The Stanford Affilia
tion Committee arranged a tour
of some of the university's facili
ties.. including the beautiful new
Henry Ford Library.
As the Free University was ac
tually founded by students them
selves when they decided to leave
the East Sector, there are student
representatives on all executive
boards and planning councils, giv
ing the students a real part in the
future of their university.
Abundant Material
With Dr. Edward Farmer along,
architecture was on all of our
minds, and Berlin provided abun
dant material. One morning was
spent touring the Interbau - Aus
stelung, the renowned new hous
ing section of Berlin, with 52 in
ter-nationally known architects
participating in the construction
of 48 structures.
It was quite interesting to com
pare this international exhibit —
with its varied buildings and West
Berlin's fascinating Kongress
Halle—with the "people's palaces"
built in the East Sector along
Stalin Allee in what the West Ger
mans term "Louis meme" style.
In order to help tie together our
impressions and experiences, the
Bonn government sponsored a lec
ture, discussion and films in the
Bundeshaus on our last morning
in Berlin.
Heart-Rending
Of greatest interest were Ihe
films. One film, showing the re
volt of the East Sector and its
suppression by Russian tanks on
June 17, 1956, was particularly
moving and brought home the
heart-rending situation of Berlin
and her citizens on both sides of
the barbed wire.
East German films unintention
ally revealed a great deal about
propaganda techniques. A part of
a film of the recent art exhibit in
Dresden was shown, and the com
mentary on a handsome portrait
of a prince and a rather ugly
looking dog was, "Notice the dull
ness and the dissipation in the
prince's face in comparison with
the alertness and sympathy of
the common dog."
Signs in the East Sector and
Zone also reveal a great deal to
the Western observer. One film
we saw showed a deserted high
way near Dresden with a sign
which read "In Traffic, Practice
Democratic Alertness."
Least Expenditure
A billboard used to recruit peo
ple to work without pay on state
projects read, "The aim of the
Regime is to achieve the most at
the least expenditure." while one
prophetic sign read, "The harder
the battle, the stronger the soli
darity."
When one has the opportunity
to see for oneself how the talking
and laughing cease in the U-Bahn
trains the minute they cross the
sector border into Ihe East; when
one can see how Stalin Allee is
nothing but a two-room-wide fa
cade covering up blocks upon
blocks of people living in ruins;
when one can see the Volkspolizei
peering into the windows of the
U-Bahn trains in nearly every
East station: when one can see
for oneself the plight of the 20,000
refugees a week only then can
one even begin to comprehend the
tremendous conflict in which we
all are entangled.
