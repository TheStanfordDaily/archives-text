LOS ANGELES — Everything,
literally everything, is at stake
here in California's elections this
fall. No less than this:
• The fate of the Republican
party, perhaps for a long time
to come, in a state where inde
pendent Republicanism has rul
ed for many years.
• The shape of the presiden
tial tickets of both parties in
1960.
• The coloration in foreign
and domestic policy alike, of
both parties in Congress.
• And, to a large extent, the
future of the "Right-to-Work"
(anti- closed shop) movement
throughout (lie country.
In the whole budget of national
politics this year, here, in one
package, is the biggest stake in
what in a few years will be the
most populous and politically the
most powerful state in the Union
—the biggest bloc of votes at both
conventions, the biggest bloc of
votes in the electoral college, the
largest delegation in Congress.
Look at the stake in terms of
its leading personalities:
If U.S. Sen. William Knowland
wins the governorship, particular
ly with all the odds against him
as they are today, he will instant
ly become a formidable contender
for the 1960 presidential nomina
tion and will provide a focal point
for Republican conservative op
position to Vice President Nixon.
If Senator Knowland wins,
Nixon's prospects for the nomi
nation will be somewhat hurt
and his prospects of election, if
nominated, improved.
If Knowland loses, Nixon's nom
ination will be nearly assured and
his prospects of elect ion impaired,

because lie will have lost a secure
Republican home base from which
to operate.
11' Democratic nominee Edmund
(Pat) Brown wins the governor
ship, he will be a power in the
Democratic party nationally, can
do much to help it win in 1960,
will he a big factor at the conven
tion and A prospect for the vice
presidential nomination.
11' the Republicans lose in Cali
fornia, Senator Knowland will be
an extinguished political figure,
the party will have lost one of its
most vigorous and respected con
servatives and the cause of an
Asia-first foreign policy and all
out support of Chiang Kai-shek
will have lost one of its most in
fluential advocates.
If Ihi' Democrats win, it will
probably be a full-scale sweep,
including decisive control of the
state legislature—which will en
able the Democrats to re-gerry
inander the congressional dis
tricts in a way which will pro
duce a heavily tilted Democratic
delegation in Congress for a
long time.
The radiant Eisenhower and the
hard-hitting Nixon have done
their best to kindle fire and force
behind the Republican campaign.
But they have now come and gone,
the voting is near at hand and the
factors which still point to Demo
cratic victory remain:
• Pat Brown's massive primary
majority over Bill Knowland.
• New registrations running 3-
to-1 Democratic.
• A newly united Democratic
party and an openly divided Re
publican party, with Gov. Good
win Knight unforgiving Know
land's wresting the gubernatorial
renomination from his hands, and
letting it be known that: a vote
against Knowland—including his
own—would be all right with him.
Republican moderates, like Earl
Warren and Knight, have been

able easily to defeat Democratic
left-wingers. But now a Demo
cratic moderate is running against
an authentic Republican conserv
ative. and the outcome on Nov. 4
will be something to watch.
