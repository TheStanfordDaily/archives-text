A trip to Los Angeles is always an interesting thing, and this
Writer's junket to the Southland last weekend was no exception. But
lhis time, along with being interesting, it got pretty irriating. More
jrriating, even, than those of two previous years have been.
('ouch Jack Curtice's Stanford Indians played a whale of a good
ball game in the Coliseum last Saturday; they played a game they
deserved to win because they played with more determination and
wore desire than K'LA's baby blue Bruins.
Hut there are a few people down there, admittedly small people,
in minds and positions, who are big only because they get their
thoughts into print and voices on the air, who don't see these reasons
as the ones by which Stanford tripped the Bruins, 2119.
One of these little people is a broadcaster we will call Sam; the
fact that this is his name has considerably much to do with it. Sam
broadcasts the Bruins' football games, and also has a commentary
show. Sain is not so much the broadcaster, though, as he is "the pub
licity man" as some of his cohorts have taken to calling him. He's
a pretty avid Bruin fan, and seems to be pretty much anti-everybody
else, Stanford in particular.
Sain said there were three reasons why Stanford beat UCLA Sat
urday, and he said it like this (almost):
1 I think everybody who saw that game will agree that UCLA
sorely missed five of its greatest players today; Don Long was the
Bruins' greatest passer, Dick Wallen the greatest end, etc.
2 UCLA beat Stanford on a touchdown that was called back on
pretty much an edge-of-the-fence play. This year they changed the
ineligible receiver rule to make it quite a bit harder for an official to
call that play. So an official would have to have mighty good pe
ripheral vision to have been able to call it; it's a pretty tricky call.
And I'll point out that that red flag fluttered to the ground quite a
while after the play had been run.
3 (And this is the killer!) Stanford's win was not a team win
any more than UCLA's loss was a team loss; this game was won
ihree years ago in Victoria, British Columbia. This was a legislated
victory!
Sam, the Publicity Mail
Well, Sam doesn't go unchecked down south, and it's probably a
good thing there's somebody around to shove a foot in his mouth
when he opens it so wide. Probably his biggest antagonist is KMPC
sportscaster and Rams announcer Bob Kelley who follows Sam on
Hie air on another station.
Kelley points out that "Old Sam the publicity man came out with
another couple of funnies today. It seems like every time old Sam
opens his mouth something comical comes out." Bob points out that
in calling Long the greatest passer Sam overlooked a few guys, Bob
Waterfield among them. And that in calling Wallen the greatest end
he left out quite a few before Dick. I'm on Bob's side.
But I have a few other things to say to Sam. One of them, Sam,
is that you'd better go check the films of that ineligible receiver call,
fella, because you're gonna be surprised—it really was a goof on the
Bruins' part. And say, Sam, you'd better check the first Bruin touch
down, too, because you'll see the same thing. Try that one on for
size!
It's guys like Sam who have kept Ihe old PCC pot bubbling long
after the odor should have died away. What old Sam doesn't seem
to care about is the fact that the longer he keeps that smell in the
air down ihere the more it's going to stick to him, if it hasn't already.
I thought I detected the odor.
And what do you want to bet that next year, after the PCC has
long been buried, guys like Sam will still have a bitch. Maybe then
they'll blame us for killing it. That would somehow figure.
Out in Westwoocl
And out in Westwood Friday night I heard a pretty sickening
array of bosh when the Uclans gathered for their- fizzle of a rally.
They laughed till their sides almost split about the PCC, and about
former PCC Commissioner Vic Schmidt.
It was a pretty unimpressive display; it got you like a murderer
standing back and laughing at his corpse. A morose sort of thing,
I'll tell you. What I fail to understand is how they can do it. How
can a fairly intelligent, and at least moral and semi-ethical, group
like hat stand back and criticize those who slapped their hands when
they got caught reaching into the cookie jar, or bank vault, as the
case may be.
And then, of course, they had a few words of compliment for the
new Athletic Association of Western Universities; but this is only
natural.
To top off the rally, and the height of unnecessity, one of the
Bruins' five-game seniors took up a lengthy portion of the program
to tell the fans how you play with your heart when you play for
I 'CI,A, and how unfair it was that he and his classmates could only
play five games this year.
It seemed to be a cruel, cruel world until you begin to think that
everybody else in the conference plays with his heart, too, and some
of them for schools that tried to do things right. Then it wasn't so
cruel after all.
TRIBUTE TO MASTERS—And so it was fitting that the Stanford
team awarded Saturday's game ball to Athletic Director A 1 Masters.
The Southlanders looked at this with tongue-in-cheek, I-told-you-so
smirks on their faces, but Masters only tried to do his job, to punish
according to the offense, though with teeth to make it felt. He's
been severely criticized down Ihere for this, and it hasn't seemed
right. It's too bad Al couldn't make the trip.

# # *
But now to more pleasant things—like a big Homecoming week
end, and a game with USC. Assistant Coach Bob Ghilotti, who has
scouted Ihe Trojans, reports that this club will be no pushover.
They're big, strong, bruising guys and they punish an opponent,
win or lose. This looks like a very big test for the "new look" In
dians, and they're going to have to study hard to pass it.
But let me be among the first to point out something I Ihink a lot
of us have felt, a lot of us know, something that seems incredible,
Ihough true, and something I guess we've just shied away from men
tioning.
Art Rosenbanm said it well in Monday morn's S.F. Chronicle:
"Know which tram is still in the Rose Bowl race?"
"Stanford, that's which,"
Of course that pretty much means winning all the remaining
games on Ihe 1958 slate, but who can laugh?
That slate, naturally, begins with the Trojans this Saturday at
2 p.m.

The Southlanders looked at this with tongue-in-cheek, I-told-you-so
smirks on their faces, but Masters only tried to do his job, to punish
according to the offense, though with teeth to make it felt. He's
been severely criticized down Ihere for this, and it hasn't seemed
right. It's too bad Al couldn't make the trip.

# # *
But now to more pleasant things—like a big Homecoming week
end, and a game with USC. Assistant Coach Bob Ghilotti, who has
scouted Ihe Trojans, reports that this club will be no pushover.
They're big, strong, bruising guys and they punish an opponent,
win or lose. This looks like a very big test for the "new look" In
dians, and they're going to have to study hard to pass it.
But let me be among the first to point out something I Ihink a lot
of us have felt, a lot of us know, something that seems incredible,
Ihough true, and something I guess we've just shied away from men
tioning.
Art Rosenbanm said it well in Monday morn's S.F. Chronicle:
"Know which tram is still in the Rose Bowl race?"
"Stanford, that's which,"
Of course that pretty much means winning all the remaining
games on Ihe 1958 slate, but who can laugh?
That slate, naturally, begins with the Trojans this Saturday at
2 p.m.
Southland Stench
A trip to Los Angeles is always an interesting thing, and this
Writer's junket to the Southland last weekend was no exception. But
lhis time, along with being interesting, it got pretty irriating. More
jrriating, even, than those of two previous years have been.
('ouch Jack Curtice's Stanford Indians played a whale of a good
ball game in the Coliseum last Saturday; they played a game they
deserved to win because they played with more determination and
wore desire than K'LA's baby blue Bruins.
Hut there are a few people down there, admittedly small people,
in minds and positions, who are big only because they get their
thoughts into print and voices on the air, who don't see these reasons
as the ones by which Stanford tripped the Bruins, 2119.
One of these little people is a broadcaster we will call Sam; the
fact that this is his name has considerably much to do with it. Sam
broadcasts the Bruins' football games, and also has a commentary
show. Sain is not so much the broadcaster, though, as he is "the pub
licity man" as some of his cohorts have taken to calling him. He's
a pretty avid Bruin fan, and seems to be pretty much anti-everybody
else, Stanford in particular.
Sain said there were three reasons why Stanford beat UCLA Sat
urday, and he said it like this (almost):
1 I think everybody who saw that game will agree that UCLA
sorely missed five of its greatest players today; Don Long was the
Bruins' greatest passer, Dick Wallen the greatest end, etc.
2 UCLA beat Stanford on a touchdown that was called back on
pretty much an edge-of-the-fence play. This year they changed the
ineligible receiver rule to make it quite a bit harder for an official to
call that play. So an official would have to have mighty good pe
ripheral vision to have been able to call it; it's a pretty tricky call.
And I'll point out that that red flag fluttered to the ground quite a
while after the play had been run.
3 (And this is the killer!) Stanford's win was not a team win
any more than UCLA's loss was a team loss; this game was won
ihree years ago in Victoria, British Columbia. This was a legislated
victory!
Sam, the Publicity Mail
Well, Sam doesn't go unchecked down south, and it's probably a
good thing there's somebody around to shove a foot in his mouth
when he opens it so wide. Probably his biggest antagonist is KMPC
sportscaster and Rams announcer Bob Kelley who follows Sam on
Hie air on another station.
Kelley points out that "Old Sam the publicity man came out with
another couple of funnies today. It seems like every time old Sam
opens his mouth something comical comes out." Bob points out that
in calling Long the greatest passer Sam overlooked a few guys, Bob
Waterfield among them. And that in calling Wallen the greatest end
he left out quite a few before Dick. I'm on Bob's side.
But I have a few other things to say to Sam. One of them, Sam,
is that you'd better go check the films of that ineligible receiver call,
fella, because you're gonna be surprised—it really was a goof on the
Bruins' part. And say, Sam, you'd better check the first Bruin touch
down, too, because you'll see the same thing. Try that one on for
size!
It's guys like Sam who have kept Ihe old PCC pot bubbling long
after the odor should have died away. What old Sam doesn't seem
to care about is the fact that the longer he keeps that smell in the
air down ihere the more it's going to stick to him, if it hasn't already.
I thought I detected the odor.
And what do you want to bet that next year, after the PCC has
long been buried, guys like Sam will still have a bitch. Maybe then
they'll blame us for killing it. That would somehow figure.
Out in Westwoocl
And out in Westwood Friday night I heard a pretty sickening
array of bosh when the Uclans gathered for their- fizzle of a rally.
They laughed till their sides almost split about the PCC, and about
former PCC Commissioner Vic Schmidt.
It was a pretty unimpressive display; it got you like a murderer
standing back and laughing at his corpse. A morose sort of thing,
I'll tell you. What I fail to understand is how they can do it. How
can a fairly intelligent, and at least moral and semi-ethical, group
like hat stand back and criticize those who slapped their hands when
they got caught reaching into the cookie jar, or bank vault, as the
case may be.
And then, of course, they had a few words of compliment for the
new Athletic Association of Western Universities; but this is only
natural.
To top off the rally, and the height of unnecessity, one of the
Bruins' five-game seniors took up a lengthy portion of the program
to tell the fans how you play with your heart when you play for
I 'CI,A, and how unfair it was that he and his classmates could only
play five games this year.
It seemed to be a cruel, cruel world until you begin to think that
everybody else in the conference plays with his heart, too, and some
of them for schools that tried to do things right. Then it wasn't so
cruel after all.

And out in Westwood Friday night I heard a pretty sickening
array of bosh when the Uclans gathered for their- fizzle of a rally.
They laughed till their sides almost split about the PCC, and about
former PCC Commissioner Vic Schmidt.
It was a pretty unimpressive display; it got you like a murderer
standing back and laughing at his corpse. A morose sort of thing,
I'll tell you. What I fail to understand is how they can do it. How
can a fairly intelligent, and at least moral and semi-ethical, group
like hat stand back and criticize those who slapped their hands when
they got caught reaching into the cookie jar, or bank vault, as the
case may be.
And then, of course, they had a few words of compliment for the
new Athletic Association of Western Universities; but this is only
natural.
To top off the rally, and the height of unnecessity, one of the
Bruins' five-game seniors took up a lengthy portion of the program
to tell the fans how you play with your heart when you play for
I 'CI,A, and how unfair it was that he and his classmates could only
play five games this year.
It seemed to be a cruel, cruel world until you begin to think that
everybody else in the conference plays with his heart, too, and some
of them for schools that tried to do things right. Then it wasn't so
cruel after all.
TRIBUTE TO MASTERS—And so it was fitting that the Stanford
team awarded Saturday's game ball to Athletic Director A 1 Masters.
The Southlanders looked at this with tongue-in-cheek, I-told-you-so
smirks on their faces, but Masters only tried to do his job, to punish
according to the offense, though with teeth to make it felt. He's
been severely criticized down Ihere for this, and it hasn't seemed
right. It's too bad Al couldn't make the trip.

# # *
But now to more pleasant things—like a big Homecoming week
end, and a game with USC. Assistant Coach Bob Ghilotti, who has
scouted Ihe Trojans, reports that this club will be no pushover.
They're big, strong, bruising guys and they punish an opponent,
win or lose. This looks like a very big test for the "new look" In
dians, and they're going to have to study hard to pass it.
But let me be among the first to point out something I Ihink a lot
of us have felt, a lot of us know, something that seems incredible,
Ihough true, and something I guess we've just shied away from men
tioning.
Art Rosenbanm said it well in Monday morn's S.F. Chronicle:
"Know which tram is still in the Rose Bowl race?"
"Stanford, that's which,"
Of course that pretty much means winning all the remaining
games on Ihe 1958 slate, but who can laugh?
That slate, naturally, begins with the Trojans this Saturday at
2 p.m.
Southland Stench
A trip to Los Angeles is always an interesting thing, and this
Writer's junket to the Southland last weekend was no exception. But
lhis time, along with being interesting, it got pretty irriating. More
jrriating, even, than those of two previous years have been.
('ouch Jack Curtice's Stanford Indians played a whale of a good
ball game in the Coliseum last Saturday; they played a game they
deserved to win because they played with more determination and
wore desire than K'LA's baby blue Bruins.
Hut there are a few people down there, admittedly small people,
in minds and positions, who are big only because they get their
thoughts into print and voices on the air, who don't see these reasons
as the ones by which Stanford tripped the Bruins, 2119.
One of these little people is a broadcaster we will call Sam; the
fact that this is his name has considerably much to do with it. Sam
broadcasts the Bruins' football games, and also has a commentary
show. Sain is not so much the broadcaster, though, as he is "the pub
licity man" as some of his cohorts have taken to calling him. He's
a pretty avid Bruin fan, and seems to be pretty much anti-everybody
else, Stanford in particular.
Sain said there were three reasons why Stanford beat UCLA Sat
urday, and he said it like this (almost):
1 I think everybody who saw that game will agree that UCLA
sorely missed five of its greatest players today; Don Long was the
Bruins' greatest passer, Dick Wallen the greatest end, etc.
2 UCLA beat Stanford on a touchdown that was called back on
pretty much an edge-of-the-fence play. This year they changed the
ineligible receiver rule to make it quite a bit harder for an official to
call that play. So an official would have to have mighty good pe
ripheral vision to have been able to call it; it's a pretty tricky call.
And I'll point out that that red flag fluttered to the ground quite a
while after the play had been run.
3 (And this is the killer!) Stanford's win was not a team win
any more than UCLA's loss was a team loss; this game was won
ihree years ago in Victoria, British Columbia. This was a legislated
victory!
Sam, the Publicity Mail
Well, Sam doesn't go unchecked down south, and it's probably a
good thing there's somebody around to shove a foot in his mouth
when he opens it so wide. Probably his biggest antagonist is KMPC
sportscaster and Rams announcer Bob Kelley who follows Sam on
Hie air on another station.
Kelley points out that "Old Sam the publicity man came out with
another couple of funnies today. It seems like every time old Sam
opens his mouth something comical comes out." Bob points out that
in calling Long the greatest passer Sam overlooked a few guys, Bob
Waterfield among them. And that in calling Wallen the greatest end
he left out quite a few before Dick. I'm on Bob's side.
But I have a few other things to say to Sam. One of them, Sam,
is that you'd better go check the films of that ineligible receiver call,
fella, because you're gonna be surprised—it really was a goof on the
Bruins' part. And say, Sam, you'd better check the first Bruin touch
down, too, because you'll see the same thing. Try that one on for
size!
It's guys like Sam who have kept Ihe old PCC pot bubbling long
after the odor should have died away. What old Sam doesn't seem
to care about is the fact that the longer he keeps that smell in the
air down ihere the more it's going to stick to him, if it hasn't already.
I thought I detected the odor.
And what do you want to bet that next year, after the PCC has
long been buried, guys like Sam will still have a bitch. Maybe then
they'll blame us for killing it. That would somehow figure.

sportscaster and Rams announcer Bob Kelley who follows Sam on
Hie air on another station.
Kelley points out that "Old Sam the publicity man came out with
another couple of funnies today. It seems like every time old Sam
opens his mouth something comical comes out." Bob points out that
in calling Long the greatest passer Sam overlooked a few guys, Bob
Waterfield among them. And that in calling Wallen the greatest end
he left out quite a few before Dick. I'm on Bob's side.
But I have a few other things to say to Sam. One of them, Sam,
is that you'd better go check the films of that ineligible receiver call,
fella, because you're gonna be surprised—it really was a goof on the
Bruins' part. And say, Sam, you'd better check the first Bruin touch
down, too, because you'll see the same thing. Try that one on for
size!
It's guys like Sam who have kept Ihe old PCC pot bubbling long
after the odor should have died away. What old Sam doesn't seem
to care about is the fact that the longer he keeps that smell in the
air down ihere the more it's going to stick to him, if it hasn't already.
I thought I detected the odor.
And what do you want to bet that next year, after the PCC has
long been buried, guys like Sam will still have a bitch. Maybe then
they'll blame us for killing it. That would somehow figure.
Out in Westwoocl
And out in Westwood Friday night I heard a pretty sickening
array of bosh when the Uclans gathered for their- fizzle of a rally.
They laughed till their sides almost split about the PCC, and about
former PCC Commissioner Vic Schmidt.
It was a pretty unimpressive display; it got you like a murderer
standing back and laughing at his corpse. A morose sort of thing,
I'll tell you. What I fail to understand is how they can do it. How
can a fairly intelligent, and at least moral and semi-ethical, group
like hat stand back and criticize those who slapped their hands when
they got caught reaching into the cookie jar, or bank vault, as the
case may be.
And then, of course, they had a few words of compliment for the
new Athletic Association of Western Universities; but this is only
natural.
To top off the rally, and the height of unnecessity, one of the
Bruins' five-game seniors took up a lengthy portion of the program
to tell the fans how you play with your heart when you play for
I 'CI,A, and how unfair it was that he and his classmates could only
play five games this year.
It seemed to be a cruel, cruel world until you begin to think that
everybody else in the conference plays with his heart, too, and some
of them for schools that tried to do things right. Then it wasn't so
cruel after all.
TRIBUTE TO MASTERS—And so it was fitting that the Stanford
team awarded Saturday's game ball to Athletic Director A 1 Masters.
The Southlanders looked at this with tongue-in-cheek, I-told-you-so
smirks on their faces, but Masters only tried to do his job, to punish
according to the offense, though with teeth to make it felt. He's
been severely criticized down Ihere for this, and it hasn't seemed
right. It's too bad Al couldn't make the trip.

But now to more pleasant things—like a big Homecoming week
end, and a game with USC. Assistant Coach Bob Ghilotti, who has
scouted Ihe Trojans, reports that this club will be no pushover.
They're big, strong, bruising guys and they punish an opponent,
win or lose. This looks like a very big test for the "new look" In
dians, and they're going to have to study hard to pass it.
But let me be among the first to point out something I Ihink a lot
of us have felt, a lot of us know, something that seems incredible,
Ihough true, and something I guess we've just shied away from men
tioning.
Art Rosenbanm said it well in Monday morn's S.F. Chronicle:
"Know which tram is still in the Rose Bowl race?"
"Stanford, that's which,"
Of course that pretty much means winning all the remaining
games on Ihe 1958 slate, but who can laugh?
That slate, naturally, begins with the Trojans this Saturday at
2 p.m.
Southland Stench
A trip to Los Angeles is always an interesting thing, and this
Writer's junket to the Southland last weekend was no exception. But
lhis time, along with being interesting, it got pretty irriating. More
jrriating, even, than those of two previous years have been.
('ouch Jack Curtice's Stanford Indians played a whale of a good
ball game in the Coliseum last Saturday; they played a game they
deserved to win because they played with more determination and
wore desire than K'LA's baby blue Bruins.
Hut there are a few people down there, admittedly small people,
in minds and positions, who are big only because they get their
thoughts into print and voices on the air, who don't see these reasons
as the ones by which Stanford tripped the Bruins, 2119.
One of these little people is a broadcaster we will call Sam; the
fact that this is his name has considerably much to do with it. Sam
broadcasts the Bruins' football games, and also has a commentary
show. Sain is not so much the broadcaster, though, as he is "the pub
licity man" as some of his cohorts have taken to calling him. He's
a pretty avid Bruin fan, and seems to be pretty much anti-everybody
else, Stanford in particular.
Sain said there were three reasons why Stanford beat UCLA Sat
urday, and he said it like this (almost):
1 I think everybody who saw that game will agree that UCLA
sorely missed five of its greatest players today; Don Long was the
Bruins' greatest passer, Dick Wallen the greatest end, etc.
2 UCLA beat Stanford on a touchdown that was called back on
pretty much an edge-of-the-fence play. This year they changed the
ineligible receiver rule to make it quite a bit harder for an official to
call that play. So an official would have to have mighty good pe
ripheral vision to have been able to call it; it's a pretty tricky call.
And I'll point out that that red flag fluttered to the ground quite a
while after the play had been run.
3 (And this is the killer!) Stanford's win was not a team win
any more than UCLA's loss was a team loss; this game was won
ihree years ago in Victoria, British Columbia. This was a legislated
victory!
Sam, the Publicity Mail
Well, Sam doesn't go unchecked down south, and it's probably a
good thing there's somebody around to shove a foot in his mouth
when he opens it so wide. Probably his biggest antagonist is KMPC
sportscaster and Rams announcer Bob Kelley who follows Sam on
Hie air on another station.
