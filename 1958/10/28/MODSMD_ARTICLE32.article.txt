# Who's Who at Stanford Top Quarterback Spot
## 
### 
Football teams have very little time to enjoy their victories for two
clays after their Saturday win the players have to return to the hard
work of preparing for the next game.
This is precisely the case of the Stanford Indians who Saturday
were victorious against UCLA and who yesterday afternoon found

themselves working harder than
ever preparing for this Satur
day's Homecoming game with
use.
The Monday afternoon Stan
ford hopes were that the Cards
would be at their healthiest of the
season for this Saturday when
the Los Angeles invaders arrive.
Gil Dowd and Rick McMillen,
the two back field stars who have
both missed many minutes of
play in the last three games, hope
to be in shape to play Saturday.
Dowd, out since the Washington
game of three weeks ago, worked
out yesterday in sweat clothes
giving his knee a little test. Dowd
needs to get the doctor's final
O.K. but chances are good that
he'll be able to see at least some
action on Saturday.
Still in Cast
McMillen still is in a six-day
cast which was put on his leg
last week, but his chances to play
also appear very good.
If these two get back in action
the big question will be, how
much will they be able to play?
Most probably they will only be
able to see limited action.
Another Indian casualty of
many weeks back, guard Larry
Lacey, padded up for the first
time in quite a while yesterday
and he too is very hopeful con
cerning his chances to play Sat
urday.
If these three players return to

the Stanford lineup it will be the
first time in several weeks that
the Cards will have their full
squad all in playing condition at
the same time.
The only injuries which re
sulted from ihe UCLA game were
a broken nose and a slight leg ;
bruise, both absorbed by end Joel
Freis. Freis, despite these ills,
will be able to play against
Southern Cal.
Another big question which
faced- the Stanfordites as this
week's practice began was who
would be the starting quarter
back on Saturday?
Previous to last Saturday, it ap
peared that Bob Nicolet when
ever he was healthy enough was
the starter. However, the fine
play of Sid Garber in last week's
game could be enough to push
him up into the number one spot.
Norman Too
Just to make things more com
plicated, one can't forget Dick
Norman who has an excellent
passing record, t and who has hud
several fine moments at quarter
back.
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice
has 110 idea yet how he's going to
use his quarterbacks Saturday.
He feels it is best to see how all
three fare this week in practice,
and regardless of which one
starts, there is no guarantee that
he won't be replaced if the attack
bogs down.
It's also possible that all three
may see equal action on Satur
day.

will be able to play against
Southern Cal.
Another big question which
faced- the Stanfordites as this
week's practice began was who
would be the starting quarter
back on Saturday?
Previous to last Saturday, it ap
peared that Bob Nicolet when
ever he was healthy enough was
the starter. However, the fine
play of Sid Garber in last week's
game could be enough to push
him up into the number one spot.
Norman Too
Just to make things more com
plicated, one can't forget Dick
Norman who has an excellent
passing record, t and who has hud
several fine moments at quarter
back.
Stanford Coach Jack Curtice
has 110 idea yet how he's going to
use his quarterbacks Saturday.
He feels it is best to see how all
three fare this week in practice,
and regardless of which one
starts, there is no guarantee that
he won't be replaced if the attack
bogs down.
It's also possible that all three
may see equal action on Satur
day.


QUARTERBACK SID GARBKR
Could be the starter Saturday
Football teams have very little time to enjoy their victories for two
clays after their Saturday win the players have to return to the hard
work of preparing for the next game.
This is precisely the case of the Stanford Indians who Saturday
were victorious against UCLA and who yesterday afternoon found

themselves working harder than
ever preparing for this Satur
day's Homecoming game with
use.
The Monday afternoon Stan
ford hopes were that the Cards
would be at their healthiest of the
season for this Saturday when
the Los Angeles invaders arrive.
Gil Dowd and Rick McMillen,
the two back field stars who have
both missed many minutes of
play in the last three games, hope
to be in shape to play Saturday.
Dowd, out since the Washington
game of three weeks ago, worked
out yesterday in sweat clothes
giving his knee a little test. Dowd
needs to get the doctor's final
O.K. but chances are good that
he'll be able to see at least some
action on Saturday.
Still in Cast
McMillen still is in a six-day
cast which was put on his leg
last week, but his chances to play
also appear very good.
If these two get back in action
the big question will be, how
much will they be able to play?
Most probably they will only be
able to see limited action.
Another Indian casualty of
many weeks back, guard Larry
Lacey, padded up for the first
time in quite a while yesterday
and he too is very hopeful con
cerning his chances to play Sat
urday.
If these three players return to

the Stanford lineup it will be the
first time in several weeks that
the Cards will have their full
squad all in playing condition at
the same time.
The only injuries which re
sulted from ihe UCLA game were
a broken nose and a slight leg ;
bruise, both absorbed by end Joel
Freis. Freis, despite these ills,
will be able to play against
Southern Cal.
