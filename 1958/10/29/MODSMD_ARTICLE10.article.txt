# Venetian Cardinal Selected as Pope
## 
### 
VATICAN CITY (A') — Angelo
Giuseppe Cardinal Roncalli, an
Italian skilled in Vatican diplo
macy, was elected pope Tuesday
night. He chose the name John
XXIII.
The bells of St. Peter's and 500
other Rome churches rang out a
carol of triumph. Hundreds of
thousands in St. Peter's Square
roared an ovation as tiie patriarch
of Venice became pope at 76.
His election ended three days of
intense suspense centering about
a deadlocked conclave of the 51
cardinals, gathered to choose a
successor to Pope Pius XII.
First Appearance
Disappointed in five other vigils
—through 11 unsuccessful ballots
in the past three days—the crowd
hroke into a joyous frenzy as
John XXIII made his first appear
ance on the balcony overlooking
St. Peter's Square.
The new pontiff, Italian like his
predecessors for 436 years, is re
garded by Roman Catholics as the
262 nd vicar of Christ on earth and
a direct successor to St. Peter.
The selection of Cardinal Ron
calli—l9 days after Pius XII died
—bore out predictions that the
pope would be chosen from among
the older Italian members of the
College of Cardinals.
Some might regard John XXIII
as a "transition pope," not des
t i ne d to institute any notable
changes in church policy. But
John XXIII, like his celebrated
predecessor, has been a diplomat
of many years' experience.
May Be Conservative
Though his policies may prove
conservative, he is expected t.o
follow the general direction laid
flown in the 19 years of Pius Xll's
reign and to be a militant de
fender of the church's interests in
world affairs.
The election ended a conclave
which had seemed headed for a
long deadlock. It must be pre

sumed he was elected on the 12th
ballot of the 51 cardinals in the
sealed off, guarded conclave.
Jovial Appearance
John XXIII is bald, round-faced
and jovial-looking, with an easy
and amiable smile. He will turn
77 on Nov. 25. He is the first pope
to adopt the name John in more
than six centuries.
John XXIII, a native of a small
village in the province of Berg

amo, served as an army chaplain
during World War I. He wat>
chosen in 1921 by Pope Benedict
XI to reorganize the church's mis
sionary work in the Congregation
for the Propagation of the Faith.
Pope John XXIII will he
crowned within two weeks in the
most colorful of all ceremonies of
the church. The coronation date
had not been set early Wednes
day.

VATICAN CITY (A') — Angelo
Giuseppe Cardinal Roncalli, an
Italian skilled in Vatican diplo
macy, was elected pope Tuesday
night. He chose the name John
XXIII.
The bells of St. Peter's and 500
other Rome churches rang out a
carol of triumph. Hundreds of
thousands in St. Peter's Square
roared an ovation as tiie patriarch
of Venice became pope at 76.
His election ended three days of
intense suspense centering about
a deadlocked conclave of the 51
cardinals, gathered to choose a
successor to Pope Pius XII.
First Appearance
Disappointed in five other vigils
—through 11 unsuccessful ballots
in the past three days—the crowd
hroke into a joyous frenzy as
John XXIII made his first appear
ance on the balcony overlooking
St. Peter's Square.
The new pontiff, Italian like his
predecessors for 436 years, is re
garded by Roman Catholics as the
262 nd vicar of Christ on earth and
a direct successor to St. Peter.
The selection of Cardinal Ron
calli—l9 days after Pius XII died
—bore out predictions that the
pope would be chosen from among
the older Italian members of the
College of Cardinals.
Some might regard John XXIII
as a "transition pope," not des
t i ne d to institute any notable
changes in church policy. But
John XXIII, like his celebrated
predecessor, has been a diplomat
of many years' experience.
May Be Conservative
Though his policies may prove
conservative, he is expected t.o
follow the general direction laid
flown in the 19 years of Pius Xll's
reign and to be a militant de
fender of the church's interests in
world affairs.
The election ended a conclave
which had seemed headed for a
long deadlock. It must be pre

sumed he was elected on the 12th
ballot of the 51 cardinals in the
sealed off, guarded conclave.
Jovial Appearance
John XXIII is bald, round-faced
and jovial-looking, with an easy
and amiable smile. He will turn
77 on Nov. 25. He is the first pope
to adopt the name John in more
than six centuries.
