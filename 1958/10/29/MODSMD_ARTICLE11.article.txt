The United States questioned
Tuesday whether the Soviet Un
ion actually wants to negotiate a
controlled ban on nuclear weap
ons tests.
The challenge to Moscow's sin
cerity was issued at the UN just
three days before the start of Big
Three negotiations in Geneva.
It came as Secretary of State
Dulles said in Washington that
Woscow's rejection of a one-year
test suspension dimmed chances
of the United States, Britain and
the Soviet Union reaching agree
ment.
Senator Bourke B. Hickenloo
per (R-Iowa), a member of the
U.S. delegation, called attention
of the 81-nation Political Commit
tee to a Soviet resolution recom
mending an immediate uncondi
tional halt to nuclear weapons
tests.
He said that while the Soviet
Union had declared its agreement
in principle to controls for a ban
on tests its position "as set forth
in the draft resolution pending
before this body, leaves room for
doubt as to how vital it believes a
control system to be."
