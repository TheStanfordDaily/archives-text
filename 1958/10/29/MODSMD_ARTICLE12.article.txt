rugged and courageous men of The Daily," we feel that it is unfair
to £o on under this appellation without making effort to prove
this to be as true as it sounds.
Thusly, we do here, today, on this the 29th day of October, in
the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight.,
in the city of Stanford, adjacent to the city of Palo Alto, in tliu
county of Santa Clara, State of California, country of the United
Slates of America, issue to the lugheads of low humor, the hoys
of the Stanford Chaparral, a challenge to engage in a contest of
football (American, touch style) on Saturday the Sth of November,
this year.
The game is to he played here on the Stanford University cam
pus at place and lime to be decided upon hy mutual agreement.
The rules for said game will also Ik; decided upon at the same
meeting. The teams are to he irade up of members of the stalls of
tiiese two organizations', such as appear in the mastheads of the
two.
So, ahoy there, clods of the Chappie—will you be akin lo al
lowing yourselves to be thoroughly humiliated in this encounter?
