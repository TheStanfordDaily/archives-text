STOCKHOLM, Sweden (/J')- Three Soviet nuclear scientists won
Ihe Nobel Prize in Physics Tuesday, posing a problem for the Kretn
lin. The Prize for Chemistry went to an Englishman.
The Russians are P. A. Cherenkov, I. M. Frank and Igor E. Tarnm,
all Moscow professors. They were cited jointly for their work with

high â€¢ speed subatomic particles.
One product of their research was
a cosmic ray counter. One such
counter now is circling the earth
in the Russians' Sputnik 111.
Now the Kremlin must decide
what to do about it. It has al
ready brought down its wrath on
the Nobel committeemen for
choosing author Boris Pasternak
as Ihe winner of the literature
prize.
The Soviet press has called Pas
ternak a tool of those who would
fan the cold war. It demanded
that he reject the $11,420 Nobel
cash prize.
On the other hand, Cherenkov.
Frank and Tamm are among the
scientific elite in the Soviet Union
and are the first Soviet nuclear
scientists ever to receive a Nobel
citation. The Kremlin, proud of
Soviet scientific achievements,
would like to have them recog
nized.
What the three scientists were
cited for is, in laymen's terms, a
highly effective trap for elusive
subatomic particles.
The Nobel prize in chemistry
went to Dr. Frederick Sanger, 40,
for pioneer work on the structure
of insulin, furthering the search
into the secrets of life.
