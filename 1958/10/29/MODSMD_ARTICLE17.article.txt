## With Both Eyes Open 
### 
This is Homecoming Week, and
that sure means a lot to lots of
Stanford people. It's a combina
tion headache and a heartache to
all connected with it. Sort of a
joy and a tear, in a way.
Around here we'll be sweating
through the headache to provide
the heartache and tear to many
old Farmers about to make a
trek, for some an annual one, for
some it's been a much longer
lime, back to the Farm.
Up on the Row, and by almost
every living group, the wood and
chickenwire have arrived. Night
ly in the ASSU office there's a
paper - cutting crew at work to
chop up what will seem like all
the crepe paper in the world be
fore it finally gets distributed
later.
Fiendish artists have concocted
1 his year's sweepstakes winner—
aren't they all? And for some six
other groups there'll be the pride
of some sort of ribbon or other,
and for the rest the fun, the
missed studies, the dark under
eye circles, the horrible thoughts
of eight-o'clocks.
Paper-stuffers aren't the only
ones who pitch in to make the
ho m e 112 un for Homecoming,
though. Not a small part, but
just a part.
You dassn't overlook Rally
corn or Cardinals, or Headyeller
Dick Stanford and his crew
Ihey're pretty integral. By now,
no doubt, Rallycom has all its
card stunts drawn up and ready
11> he unveiled before around 50,-
000 eves come Sat. "Welcome

Alums," "Welcome to the Farm,"
"The Odd S.C." —they'll be some,
with some surprises more, no
doubt.
And Cardinals — don't forget
them. They've arranged for meet
ings, get-togethers, back-slapping,
handshaking parties —no Home
coming is near complete without
these. They have to be, they're so
much fun. Reunions —to tip a
galss with friends—of punch.
And Stanford's Stanford (you'd
be surprised how few believe that
that's his real name) works hard
to get that rally off on Friday
night. Gotta have old jokes, old
yells — the kind the grads will
know. And new yells, new jokes
—so other kids will come. And
Saturday we have to show the
Trojans up, you know.
It's Friday night—here come
the grads- back to the Farm once
more. A squinting eye — what's
that building there? . . . "Dinkl
what?" . . . "Oh, music audito
rium!" "They've moved the post
office, huh?" . . . "No, well I
don't remember that house there
. . . oh."
And Saturday — rah, rah. siss
boom bah. And then it's over for
another year and only memories
of what was and what has been.
NOBLE AMBITION — though
not connected with homecoming
at all. Phisigger Eric Nelte comes
up with an ambition to top them
all. He wants to build a tower
taller than Hoover's—and put a
steam calliope on top! Calculated
to open a goodly number of eyes!
