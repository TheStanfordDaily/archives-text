# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Scientific Congressman Needed, Says Bryan 
### Leo Krulitz 
Russell Bryan, Democratic can
didate for Congress, explained it
this way: "Ten billion dollars a
year is being spent on various
scientific enterprises. I feel there
should be one man in Congress
with a scientific background, to
be sure the money is being spent
wisely."
During the course of an inter
esting evening, Bryan, who holds
a doctor's degree in physics, ex
plained a difficult problem to a
senior Engineering student, dis
cussed philosophical ideas of
knowledge with a Philosophy stu
dent, answered a myriad of ques
tions on subjects from mining leg
islation to campaign techniques,
and stuffed letters to the voters
in envelopes.
But why, lie was asked, do
you feel the incumbent should
be replaced? He thought a mo
ment and summed it up this
way:
"Mr. Gubser lias been a faith
ful follower of a man who has
not led.
"With the present lack of lead
ership in the Administration," he
commented, "there is a need to
present constructive criticism."
lie suggested that the incumbent
hasn't done this.
"The Vice President and the
| former | Secretary of Commerce

have suggested a national sales
tax and will push it in the next
Congress," he said. "I would op
pose such a tax."
Bryan became more specific and
suggested several bills on which
he felt Gubser's position is wrong.
• Gubser, lu* said, voted for
a bill to allow wire-tapping evi
dence in some federal cases.
• Gubser supported the bill to
exempt natural gas producers
from federal regulation.

• Gubser voted for a bill to re
strict the powers of the Supreme
Court.
• Bryan criticized Gubser for
voting* against the Kennedy-
Ives labor bill. He explained
this bill would have guaranteed
free union elections, opened
union books for inspection to
the public and made it a federal
offense to embezzle union
funds.
• Bryan said the incumbent
voted against the unemployment
bill to extend unemployment com
pensation during the recession.
• Gubser voted against the bill
authorizing an investigation of
the regulatory commissions and
one to investigate mon e tar y
policy.
Bryan, a veteran of World War
11, has been critical of the Admin
istration's foreign policy and
sharply criticized the sending of
troops to Lebanon.
About defense, Bryan comment
ed: "The policies of the Eisen
hower Administration and its sup
porters have placed us in military
peril. For the first time in his
tory, our troops face weapons
against which they have no de
fense."
During the past summer Bryan
challenged Gubser to a series of
debates, and the incumbent ac
cepted. The debates have been
he 1 d on current problems, and
Bryan, satisfied with the results,
said, "Mr. Gubser and 1 have had
more publicity on our stands on
issues than we would have other
wise had."
Bryan has taken a strong stand
against Proposition IS and is for
federal aid for school construc
tion.
To Whom It May Concern: Our
nomination for the top statement
of the week: Senator Knowland
said: "My opponent, Edm un d
Brown, is a weak man. As a can
didate, he is a man of vague prom
ises, on every side of every fence.
His battle-cry is 'Have fence, will
straddle.' "
Friday: An interview with
Charles Gubser, Republican con
gressman, 10th district.
