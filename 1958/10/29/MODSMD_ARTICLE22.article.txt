### 
Loans, Not Aid
Editor, The Daily:
In The Daily of Thursday. Oct.
23. under the heading "lIR Panel

Hits U.S. Foreign Aid," this state
ment was related to me: "Accord
ing to Seif, the UAR is accepting
aid from Russia because it fears
the threat of U.S. domination in
the Middle East."
I would like to state that this is
a misquotation or a misinterpre
tation of what I said. For one
thing, I did not mention that the
U.S.A. is trying to dominate the
Middle East. For another, I said
we are getting loans and NOT aid
from the U.S.S.R.- and there is a
difference between the two.
Ali A. Seif
