# Cluster Building May Begin by Fall
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate. Editor 
With the Kappa Sigma and
Phi Delta Theta houses almost
half-way to their $150,000 fund
raising goal, chances look good
for construction to start on the
first of the new fraternity clus
ters by fall quarter next year
with occupancy by September
19G0.
This is the first step in a plan
which will eventually place Stan
ford's 24 fraternities in four
house clusters along the lower
Row, behind Lake Lagunita, and
in back of Wilbur Hall.
How fast this is all accom
plished depends on the fund-rais
ing. The houses cost $300,000
each furnished, of which the Uni
versity pays one half and the fra
ternities the other. Thus each
fraternity must raise $150,000.
So far 11 fraternities have
started raising money. Their
gifts and pledges so far are:
Kappa Sigma $70,670
Phi Delta Theta 08,557
Alpha Kappa Lambda . . 25,000
Alpha Delta Piii 17,250
Zeta Psi IS,OOO
Sigma Alpha Hpsilon ... 12,385
Delta Kappa Epsilon . .. 5,000
Chi Psi 1,000
Phi Kappa Psi 1,000
Kappa Alpha 530
Delta Upsilon 100
Other fraternities, notably The
ta Delta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi, have set up their organiza
tion and collection is beginning.
"We are very encouraged," said
Jack L. Shepard of the General
Secretary's Office who is assist
ing the fraternity solicitations.
"In these last three weeks activi
ties have picked up and we are
happy about prospects for the fu
ture."

Actually, the situation may be
even better than the figures sug
gest. Many fraternities have re
ceived substantial informal pledg
es which are not yet reported to
the University.
Picture May Change
The financial picture may
change considerably after this
coming week end, when fraternity
alumni from all over the country
return to campus for Homecom
ing and the fund-raising meetings
that are scheduled.
Some -time after the first of the
year Stanford will make a final
decision on an architect. He will
work closely with the individual
fraternities, shaping their wants
into the general concepts, and will
start making the final drawings
as soon as possible.
If Kappa Sigma, KA and DKE
are among the first to reach the
goal, as now seems highly possi
ble, the initial cluster will be built
along the Lower Row in the area
now occupied by these three
houses. If not, it will go on May
field Avenue on the slope behind
The Knoll and Florence Moore
Hall.
Individuality in design and op
eration and economy through the
use of a central kitchen are the
keys to the new clusters.
Kitchen Economy
The University has found it is
uneconomical to run a group
kitchen for less than 200 people,
so the new cluster will have one
central kitchen for all four
houses, but each fraternity will
have its own dining room, kitchen
ette facilities and special dining
privileges for individual fraterni
ties on party occasions.
Preliminary architectural con
cepts, already drawn up by San
Francisco designer John C. War

necke, '41, stress flexibility of de
sign. Plans include one- and two
story houses, with provision for a
wide variety of interior patios and
courtyards.
Different exterior wall materi
als—wood, stucco, brick, field
stone — will add individuality of
outside appearance.
Interior design will be at the
discretion of each fraternity. Each
house will have its own dining
area, living room, fireplace and
library, with space for a barbecue
pit outside.
A key feature in the new houses
would be a ceiling-high wardrobe
and door which would divide each
two-man room into study and
sleeping spaces.
Location Question
The combinations of houses in
each particular cluster depend
mainly on when the funds are
raised. There is also the question
of location—whether a fraternity
wants to live in the region which

is being built at the time it has
raised its funds. Also, a certain
combination of houses may want
to move into a cluster together
and wait until a convenient time.
The General Secretary's office
is aiding the fraternities with
their fund-raising problems, and
Shepard has been assigned espe
cially to this job. He is helping
organize the solicitation commit
tees, suggesting procedures in
conjunction with individual fra
ternity chairmen, and talking
with interested alumni.
Most Money From Few
"It is important to get every
alumnus to contribute," he said,
"but from experience we have
found that 8(J per cent of the gifts
will come from 20 per cent of the
alumni."
When the plan was first an
nounced over a year and a half
ago some doubts were felt by fra
ternity men and alumni about the
chances of maintaining individu

ality in the new clusters.
The Interfraternity Council last
spring adopted a resolution en
dorsing the new plan, but the ap
proval is not as unanimous as it
could be. Some houses are still

proceeding slowly, but generally
the cluster idea seems to have
found acceptance.
Warnecke's plans are not rigid.
The architects to be hired after
Jan. 1 will work with each house
to incorporate any ideas it may
have into the general plans.
For economy, the principal
rooms will be designed for all
houses as modular units, but these
— like toy blocks — can be shifted
around to make individual ar
rangements.
Floor space in the new houses
would average 13,500 square feet,
against an average of 9890 in the
existing 24 houses. Each cluster
of four would have seven acres of
land, with special parking space,
where the average now is ½ acre
per house.
Old House Plans Unsure
What happens to the existing
house when a fraternity decides
to move into a cluster is as yet
undecided. A committee including

two trustees and a representative
from the fraternity will decide on
a sale price to the University.
The old house may then be de
stroyed, moved, given to another
fraternity which does not have as
good a facility, or turned into a
University research center.
50-Year Amortization
The University will own the
land on which the clusters are
built and the houses themselves.
It will amortize its $150,000 share
over a 50-year period, the expect
ed length of the houses. It will
then have $150,000 ready for con
struction of another house when
the first deteriorates. Therefore,
the fraternity system appears to
be here lo stay.
As J. D. Middleton, co-chairman
of the Undergraduate Men's Hous
ing Program, said, "I am a firm
believer in the Stanford fraternity
system and am confident that it
will be preserved and improved by
the new program."

als—wood, stucco, brick, field
stone — will add individuality of
outside appearance.
Interior design will be at the
discretion of each fraternity. Each
house will have its own dining
area, living room, fireplace and
library, with space for a barbecue
pit outside.
A key feature in the new houses
would be a ceiling-high wardrobe
and door which would divide each
two-man room into study and
sleeping spaces.
Location Question
The combinations of houses in
each particular cluster depend
mainly on when the funds are
raised. There is also the question
of location—whether a fraternity
wants to live in the region which

is being built at the time it has
raised its funds. Also, a certain
combination of houses may want
to move into a cluster together
and wait until a convenient time.
The General Secretary's office
is aiding the fraternities with
their fund-raising problems, and
Shepard has been assigned espe
cially to this job. He is helping
organize the solicitation commit
tees, suggesting procedures in
conjunction with individual fra
ternity chairmen, and talking
with interested alumni.
Most Money From Few
"It is important to get every
alumnus to contribute," he said,
"but from experience we have
found that 8(J per cent of the gifts
will come from 20 per cent of the
alumni."
When the plan was first an
nounced over a year and a half
ago some doubts were felt by fra
ternity men and alumni about the
chances of maintaining individu

ality in the new clusters.
The Interfraternity Council last
spring adopted a resolution en
dorsing the new plan, but the ap
proval is not as unanimous as it
could be. Some houses are still

proceeding slowly, but generally
the cluster idea seems to have
found acceptance.
Warnecke's plans are not rigid.
The architects to be hired after
Jan. 1 will work with each house
to incorporate any ideas it may
have into the general plans.
For economy, the principal
rooms will be designed for all
houses as modular units, but these
— like toy blocks — can be shifted
around to make individual ar
rangements.
Floor space in the new houses
would average 13,500 square feet,
against an average of 9890 in the
existing 24 houses. Each cluster
of four would have seven acres of
land, with special parking space,
where the average now is ½ acre
per house.
Old House Plans Unsure
What happens to the existing
house when a fraternity decides
to move into a cluster is as yet
undecided. A committee including

two trustees and a representative
from the fraternity will decide on
a sale price to the University.
The old house may then be de
stroyed, moved, given to another
fraternity which does not have as
good a facility, or turned into a
University research center.
50-Year Amortization
The University will own the
land on which the clusters are
built and the houses themselves.
It will amortize its $150,000 share
over a 50-year period, the expect
ed length of the houses. It will
then have $150,000 ready for con
struction of another house when
the first deteriorates. Therefore,
the fraternity system appears to
be here lo stay.
As J. D. Middleton, co-chairman
of the Undergraduate Men's Hous
ing Program, said, "I am a firm
believer in the Stanford fraternity
system and am confident that it
will be preserved and improved by
the new program."
With the Kappa Sigma and
Phi Delta Theta houses almost
half-way to their $150,000 fund
raising goal, chances look good
for construction to start on the
first of the new fraternity clus
ters by fall quarter next year
with occupancy by September
19G0.
This is the first step in a plan
which will eventually place Stan
ford's 24 fraternities in four
house clusters along the lower
Row, behind Lake Lagunita, and
in back of Wilbur Hall.
How fast this is all accom
plished depends on the fund-rais
ing. The houses cost $300,000
each furnished, of which the Uni
versity pays one half and the fra
ternities the other. Thus each
fraternity must raise $150,000.
So far 11 fraternities have
started raising money. Their
gifts and pledges so far are:
Kappa Sigma $70,670
Phi Delta Theta 08,557
Alpha Kappa Lambda . . 25,000
Alpha Delta Piii 17,250
Zeta Psi IS,OOO
Sigma Alpha Hpsilon ... 12,385
Delta Kappa Epsilon . .. 5,000
Chi Psi 1,000
Phi Kappa Psi 1,000
Kappa Alpha 530
Delta Upsilon 100
Other fraternities, notably The
ta Delta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi, have set up their organiza
tion and collection is beginning.
"We are very encouraged," said
Jack L. Shepard of the General
Secretary's Office who is assist
ing the fraternity solicitations.
"In these last three weeks activi
ties have picked up and we are
happy about prospects for the fu
ture."

Actually, the situation may be
even better than the figures sug
gest. Many fraternities have re
ceived substantial informal pledg
es which are not yet reported to
the University.
Picture May Change
The financial picture may
change considerably after this
coming week end, when fraternity
alumni from all over the country
return to campus for Homecom
ing and the fund-raising meetings
that are scheduled.
Some -time after the first of the
year Stanford will make a final
decision on an architect. He will
work closely with the individual
fraternities, shaping their wants
into the general concepts, and will
start making the final drawings
as soon as possible.
If Kappa Sigma, KA and DKE
are among the first to reach the
goal, as now seems highly possi
ble, the initial cluster will be built
along the Lower Row in the area
now occupied by these three
houses. If not, it will go on May
field Avenue on the slope behind
The Knoll and Florence Moore
Hall.
Individuality in design and op
eration and economy through the
use of a central kitchen are the
keys to the new clusters.
Kitchen Economy
The University has found it is
uneconomical to run a group
kitchen for less than 200 people,
so the new cluster will have one
central kitchen for all four
houses, but each fraternity will
have its own dining room, kitchen
ette facilities and special dining
privileges for individual fraterni
ties on party occasions.
Preliminary architectural con
cepts, already drawn up by San
Francisco designer John C. War

necke, '41, stress flexibility of de
sign. Plans include one- and two
story houses, with provision for a
wide variety of interior patios and
courtyards.

With the Kappa Sigma and
Phi Delta Theta houses almost
half-way to their $150,000 fund
raising goal, chances look good
for construction to start on the
first of the new fraternity clus
ters by fall quarter next year
with occupancy by September
19G0.
This is the first step in a plan
which will eventually place Stan
ford's 24 fraternities in four
house clusters along the lower
Row, behind Lake Lagunita, and
in back of Wilbur Hall.
How fast this is all accom
plished depends on the fund-rais
ing. The houses cost $300,000
each furnished, of which the Uni
versity pays one half and the fra
ternities the other. Thus each
fraternity must raise $150,000.
So far 11 fraternities have
started raising money. Their
gifts and pledges so far are:
Kappa Sigma $70,670
Phi Delta Theta 08,557
Alpha Kappa Lambda . . 25,000
Alpha Delta Piii 17,250
Zeta Psi IS,OOO
Sigma Alpha Hpsilon ... 12,385
Delta Kappa Epsilon . .. 5,000
Chi Psi 1,000
Phi Kappa Psi 1,000
Kappa Alpha 530
Delta Upsilon 100
Other fraternities, notably The
ta Delta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi, have set up their organiza
tion and collection is beginning.
"We are very encouraged," said
Jack L. Shepard of the General
Secretary's Office who is assist
ing the fraternity solicitations.
"In these last three weeks activi
ties have picked up and we are
happy about prospects for the fu
ture."

Actually, the situation may be
even better than the figures sug
gest. Many fraternities have re
ceived substantial informal pledg
es which are not yet reported to
the University.
Picture May Change
The financial picture may
change considerably after this
coming week end, when fraternity
alumni from all over the country
return to campus for Homecom
ing and the fund-raising meetings
that are scheduled.
Some -time after the first of the
year Stanford will make a final
decision on an architect. He will
work closely with the individual
fraternities, shaping their wants
into the general concepts, and will
start making the final drawings
as soon as possible.
If Kappa Sigma, KA and DKE
are among the first to reach the
goal, as now seems highly possi
ble, the initial cluster will be built
along the Lower Row in the area
now occupied by these three
houses. If not, it will go on May
field Avenue on the slope behind
The Knoll and Florence Moore
Hall.
Individuality in design and op
eration and economy through the
use of a central kitchen are the
keys to the new clusters.
Kitchen Economy
The University has found it is
uneconomical to run a group
kitchen for less than 200 people,
so the new cluster will have one
central kitchen for all four
houses, but each fraternity will
have its own dining room, kitchen
ette facilities and special dining
privileges for individual fraterni
ties on party occasions.
Preliminary architectural con
cepts, already drawn up by San
Francisco designer John C. War

necke, '41, stress flexibility of de
sign. Plans include one- and two
story houses, with provision for a
wide variety of interior patios and
courtyards.
Different exterior wall materi
als—wood, stucco, brick, field
stone — will add individuality of
outside appearance.
Interior design will be at the
discretion of each fraternity. Each
house will have its own dining
area, living room, fireplace and
library, with space for a barbecue
pit outside.
A key feature in the new houses
would be a ceiling-high wardrobe
and door which would divide each
two-man room into study and
sleeping spaces.
Location Question
The combinations of houses in
each particular cluster depend
mainly on when the funds are
raised. There is also the question
of location—whether a fraternity
wants to live in the region which

is being built at the time it has
raised its funds. Also, a certain
combination of houses may want
to move into a cluster together
and wait until a convenient time.
The General Secretary's office
is aiding the fraternities with
their fund-raising problems, and
Shepard has been assigned espe
cially to this job. He is helping
organize the solicitation commit
tees, suggesting procedures in
conjunction with individual fra
ternity chairmen, and talking
with interested alumni.
Most Money From Few
"It is important to get every
alumnus to contribute," he said,
"but from experience we have
found that 8(J per cent of the gifts
will come from 20 per cent of the
alumni."
When the plan was first an
nounced over a year and a half
ago some doubts were felt by fra
ternity men and alumni about the
chances of maintaining individu

ality in the new clusters.
The Interfraternity Council last
spring adopted a resolution en
dorsing the new plan, but the ap
proval is not as unanimous as it
could be. Some houses are still

proceeding slowly, but generally
the cluster idea seems to have
found acceptance.
Warnecke's plans are not rigid.
The architects to be hired after
Jan. 1 will work with each house
to incorporate any ideas it may
have into the general plans.
For economy, the principal
rooms will be designed for all
houses as modular units, but these
— like toy blocks — can be shifted
around to make individual ar
rangements.
Floor space in the new houses
would average 13,500 square feet,
against an average of 9890 in the
existing 24 houses. Each cluster
of four would have seven acres of
land, with special parking space,
where the average now is ½ acre
per house.
Old House Plans Unsure
What happens to the existing
house when a fraternity decides
to move into a cluster is as yet
undecided. A committee including

two trustees and a representative
from the fraternity will decide on
a sale price to the University.
The old house may then be de
stroyed, moved, given to another
fraternity which does not have as
good a facility, or turned into a
University research center.
50-Year Amortization
The University will own the
land on which the clusters are
built and the houses themselves.
It will amortize its $150,000 share
over a 50-year period, the expect
ed length of the houses. It will
then have $150,000 ready for con
struction of another house when
the first deteriorates. Therefore,
the fraternity system appears to
be here lo stay.
As J. D. Middleton, co-chairman
of the Undergraduate Men's Hous
ing Program, said, "I am a firm
believer in the Stanford fraternity
system and am confident that it
will be preserved and improved by
the new program."

als—wood, stucco, brick, field
stone — will add individuality of
outside appearance.
Interior design will be at the
discretion of each fraternity. Each
house will have its own dining
area, living room, fireplace and
library, with space for a barbecue
pit outside.
A key feature in the new houses
would be a ceiling-high wardrobe
and door which would divide each
two-man room into study and
sleeping spaces.
Location Question
The combinations of houses in
each particular cluster depend
mainly on when the funds are
raised. There is also the question
of location—whether a fraternity
wants to live in the region which

is being built at the time it has
raised its funds. Also, a certain
combination of houses may want
to move into a cluster together
and wait until a convenient time.
The General Secretary's office
is aiding the fraternities with
their fund-raising problems, and
Shepard has been assigned espe
cially to this job. He is helping
organize the solicitation commit
tees, suggesting procedures in
conjunction with individual fra
ternity chairmen, and talking
with interested alumni.
Most Money From Few
"It is important to get every
alumnus to contribute," he said,
"but from experience we have
found that 8(J per cent of the gifts
will come from 20 per cent of the
alumni."
When the plan was first an
nounced over a year and a half
ago some doubts were felt by fra
ternity men and alumni about the
chances of maintaining individu

ality in the new clusters.
The Interfraternity Council last
spring adopted a resolution en
dorsing the new plan, but the ap
proval is not as unanimous as it
could be. Some houses are still

proceeding slowly, but generally
the cluster idea seems to have
found acceptance.
Warnecke's plans are not rigid.
The architects to be hired after
Jan. 1 will work with each house
to incorporate any ideas it may
have into the general plans.
For economy, the principal
rooms will be designed for all
houses as modular units, but these
— like toy blocks — can be shifted
around to make individual ar
rangements.
Floor space in the new houses
would average 13,500 square feet,
against an average of 9890 in the
existing 24 houses. Each cluster
of four would have seven acres of
land, with special parking space,
where the average now is ½ acre
per house.
Old House Plans Unsure
What happens to the existing
house when a fraternity decides
to move into a cluster is as yet
undecided. A committee including

two trustees and a representative
from the fraternity will decide on
a sale price to the University.
The old house may then be de
stroyed, moved, given to another
fraternity which does not have as
good a facility, or turned into a
University research center.
50-Year Amortization
The University will own the
land on which the clusters are
built and the houses themselves.
It will amortize its $150,000 share
over a 50-year period, the expect
ed length of the houses. It will
then have $150,000 ready for con
struction of another house when
the first deteriorates. Therefore,
the fraternity system appears to
be here lo stay.
As J. D. Middleton, co-chairman
of the Undergraduate Men's Hous
ing Program, said, "I am a firm
believer in the Stanford fraternity
system and am confident that it
will be preserved and improved by
the new program."
With the Kappa Sigma and
Phi Delta Theta houses almost
half-way to their $150,000 fund
raising goal, chances look good
for construction to start on the
first of the new fraternity clus
ters by fall quarter next year
with occupancy by September
19G0.
This is the first step in a plan
which will eventually place Stan
ford's 24 fraternities in four
house clusters along the lower
Row, behind Lake Lagunita, and
in back of Wilbur Hall.
How fast this is all accom
plished depends on the fund-rais
ing. The houses cost $300,000
each furnished, of which the Uni
versity pays one half and the fra
ternities the other. Thus each
fraternity must raise $150,000.
So far 11 fraternities have
started raising money. Their
gifts and pledges so far are:
Kappa Sigma $70,670
Phi Delta Theta 08,557
Alpha Kappa Lambda . . 25,000
Alpha Delta Piii 17,250
Zeta Psi IS,OOO
Sigma Alpha Hpsilon ... 12,385
Delta Kappa Epsilon . .. 5,000
Chi Psi 1,000
Phi Kappa Psi 1,000
Kappa Alpha 530
Delta Upsilon 100
Other fraternities, notably The
ta Delta Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi, have set up their organiza
tion and collection is beginning.
"We are very encouraged," said
Jack L. Shepard of the General
Secretary's Office who is assist
ing the fraternity solicitations.
"In these last three weeks activi
ties have picked up and we are
happy about prospects for the fu
ture."

Actually, the situation may be
even better than the figures sug
gest. Many fraternities have re
ceived substantial informal pledg
es which are not yet reported to
the University.
Picture May Change
The financial picture may
change considerably after this
coming week end, when fraternity
alumni from all over the country
return to campus for Homecom
ing and the fund-raising meetings
that are scheduled.
Some -time after the first of the
year Stanford will make a final
decision on an architect. He will
work closely with the individual
fraternities, shaping their wants
into the general concepts, and will
start making the final drawings
as soon as possible.
If Kappa Sigma, KA and DKE
are among the first to reach the
goal, as now seems highly possi
ble, the initial cluster will be built
along the Lower Row in the area
now occupied by these three
houses. If not, it will go on May
field Avenue on the slope behind
The Knoll and Florence Moore
Hall.
Individuality in design and op
eration and economy through the
use of a central kitchen are the
keys to the new clusters.
Kitchen Economy
The University has found it is
uneconomical to run a group
kitchen for less than 200 people,
so the new cluster will have one
central kitchen for all four
houses, but each fraternity will
have its own dining room, kitchen
ette facilities and special dining
privileges for individual fraterni
ties on party occasions.
Preliminary architectural con
cepts, already drawn up by San
Francisco designer John C. War

necke, '41, stress flexibility of de
sign. Plans include one- and two
story houses, with provision for a
wide variety of interior patios and
courtyards.
