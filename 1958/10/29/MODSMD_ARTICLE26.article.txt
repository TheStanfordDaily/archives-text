THE DRESS PARADE
In nil my years of observing coed fashions—and I have been
arrested many times—I have never seen such verve, such dash,
such Jt nc sais quoi as can be found in this year's styles!
F am particularly enchanted by the new "baby waist" dresses
which so many of you girls are favoring this season. How
demure you all look in your "baby waists"! How sweet! How
innocent! How colorful when your housemother lifts you up
and burps you after dinner!
Another trend that leaves me limp with rapture is the over
sized handbag. Goodbye to dinky little purses that hold nothing
at all! Hurrah for today's sensibly sized bag with plenty of
room for your makeup, your pens and pencils, your shelter
half, your Slinky toy, your M(J, and your Marlboros.
Did I say Marlboros? Certainly I said Marlboros. What, girl
can consider herself in the van, in the swim, and in the know,
if she doesn't smoke Marlboros? What man, for that matter.
Do you want a filter that is truly new, genuinely advanced,
but at the same time, does not rob you of the full flavor of
first-rate tobacco? Then get Marlboro. Also get matches because
the pleasure you derive from a Marlboro is necessarily limited
if unlit.
To return to coed fashions, let us now discuss footwear. The
popular flat shoe was introduced several years ago when it
became obvious that girls were growing taller than boys. For
a while the flat shoes kept the sexes in a state of uneasy balance,
but today they will no longer serve. Now, even in flats, nirls
are towering over their dates, for the feminine growth rate has
continued to rise with disturbing speed. In fact, it is now
thought possible that we will see fifteen-foot girls in our lifetime.
Hut science is working on the problem, and I feel sure
American know-how will find an answer. Meanwhile, a tem
porary measure is available—the reverse wedgie.
The reverse wedgie is simply a wedgie turned around. This
tilts a girl backward at a 45 degree angle and cuts as much as
three feet off her height. It is, of course, impossible to walk in
this position unless you have support, so your date will have to
keep his arm around your waist at all times. This will tire him
out in fairly short order; therefore you must constantly give
him encouragement. Keep looking up at him and batting your
lashes and repeating in awed tones, "How strong you are,
Shorty!"

Next we turn to hair styling. The hair-do this year is definitely
the cloche-coif. One sees very few crew cuts or Irene Castle
bobs, and the new Mohican cut seems not to have caught on
at all. In fact, I saw only one «irl with a Mohican — Ilhodelle
11. Sigafoos, a sophomore of Bennington. Her classmates laughed
and laughed at her, but it was Ilhodelle who had the last laugh,
for one night a dark, handsome stranger leaped from behind a
birch and linked his arm in Rhodelle's and said, "I am I ncas,
the last of the Mohicans—but I need not be the last, dear lady,
if you will but be my wife." Today they are happily married
and run a candied-apple stand near Macon, Ca., and have three
little Mohicans named Patti, Maxinc, and Laverne.

birch and linked his arm in Rhodelle's and said, "I am I ncas,
the last of the Mohicans—but I need not be the last, dear lady,
if you will but be my wife." Today they are happily married

THE DRESS PARADE
In nil my years of observing coed fashions—and I have been
arrested many times—I have never seen such verve, such dash,
such Jt nc sais quoi as can be found in this year's styles!
F am particularly enchanted by the new "baby waist" dresses
which so many of you girls are favoring this season. How
demure you all look in your "baby waists"! How sweet! How
innocent! How colorful when your housemother lifts you up
and burps you after dinner!
Another trend that leaves me limp with rapture is the over
sized handbag. Goodbye to dinky little purses that hold nothing
at all! Hurrah for today's sensibly sized bag with plenty of
room for your makeup, your pens and pencils, your shelter
half, your Slinky toy, your M(J, and your Marlboros.
Did I say Marlboros? Certainly I said Marlboros. What, girl
can consider herself in the van, in the swim, and in the know,
if she doesn't smoke Marlboros? What man, for that matter.
Do you want a filter that is truly new, genuinely advanced,
but at the same time, does not rob you of the full flavor of
first-rate tobacco? Then get Marlboro. Also get matches because
the pleasure you derive from a Marlboro is necessarily limited
if unlit.
To return to coed fashions, let us now discuss footwear. The
popular flat shoe was introduced several years ago when it
became obvious that girls were growing taller than boys. For
a while the flat shoes kept the sexes in a state of uneasy balance,
but today they will no longer serve. Now, even in flats, nirls
are towering over their dates, for the feminine growth rate has
continued to rise with disturbing speed. In fact, it is now
thought possible that we will see fifteen-foot girls in our lifetime.
Hut science is working on the problem, and I feel sure
American know-how will find an answer. Meanwhile, a tem
porary measure is available—the reverse wedgie.
The reverse wedgie is simply a wedgie turned around. This
tilts a girl backward at a 45 degree angle and cuts as much as
three feet off her height. It is, of course, impossible to walk in
this position unless you have support, so your date will have to
keep his arm around your waist at all times. This will tire him
out in fairly short order; therefore you must constantly give
him encouragement. Keep looking up at him and batting your
lashes and repeating in awed tones, "How strong you are,
Shorty!"

Next we turn to hair styling. The hair-do this year is definitely
the cloche-coif. One sees very few crew cuts or Irene Castle
bobs, and the new Mohican cut seems not to have caught on
at all. In fact, I saw only one «irl with a Mohican — Ilhodelle
