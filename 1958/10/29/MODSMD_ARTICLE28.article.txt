Although Stanford holds a fair
ly unimpressive 2-and-4 won-lost
record, their two wins to one de

feat in league play places the
Tribe high in PCC (a solid third)
und gives them a good chance in
the Rose Bowl race.
According to the six-game sta
tistics, the Big Rod team has been
outscored by a 56-to-145 total and
certainly must improve here in
order to finish with a successful
season.

Rick McMillen and end Chris Bur
ford are the big guns in the In
dian offence. Bob leads in total
offense with 425 yards gained in

yards while losing 4 yards rush
ing for his total.

of the trio, playing almost a full
60 minutes in every game. Chris

equally well on defense.
