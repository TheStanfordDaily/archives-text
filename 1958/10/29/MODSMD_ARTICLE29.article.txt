# Stanford Out to Axe SC
## Cards Try for Two 
### 
The Trojan football team which
Stanford will meet this Saturday
won't be anything like the USC
eleven the Indians trounced so
soundly, 35-7, in the Coliseum last
fall.
Southern Cal has doubled last
year's win output so far this sea
son and, but for a few fumbles
and missed conversions, would
have a season record of five wins
and one loss. As it stands, the
Trojans are 2-4—the two wins be
ing over supposedly strong Ore
gon State and Washington State.
"They probably are the strong
est team, physically, in the con
ference," reported assistant coach
Bob Ghilotti after scouting Troy
in the Wa-shington State game.
The Trojan line is very heavy, led

by 230-pounders Monte Clark and
Dan Ficca in the tackle positions.
The running and passing of
quarterback Willie Wood are in
strumental in the offensive at
tack, but SC can get along without
him —as was evidenced in their
fine play against California, a
game in which Wood couldn't play
because of injuries.
A stand-out in the back field is
sophomore halfback Angelo Coia,
a transfer from The Citadel. Coia
runs 100 yards in 9.5, and this tre
mendous speed makes him the
best outside runner of the USC
squad.
Besides Coia, there are four
other sophomores on the Trojan
lineup. This makes them about
the youngest team on the Coast.
