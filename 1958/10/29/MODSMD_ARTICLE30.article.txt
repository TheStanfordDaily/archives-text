Three Good Ones —A Problem
The Rams used to have quarterback problems with Bo!) Water
field and Norman Van Brocklin; in '57, Rice had to split time between
King Hill and Frank Ryan; Frankie Albert has to constantly decide
between John Brodic and Y. A. Titlle.
Now Stanford joins the list of teams who have quarterback prob
lems not problems in the sense of no talent, but problems in that
the talent isn't confined to one man. This isn't to infer that Sid Gar
ber, Bob Nicolet or liick Norman are in the same class with the
Waterfields and Brodies, but that the three Indians are about equal
in skill. So, Jack Curtice gains a membership in the problem league
of coaches who have to mastermind a plan of whom to use when.
Interestingly enough, each of the current crop is a different type
of quarterback. Nicolet is no doubt the best long passer of the lot,
is adequate in the short game, and isn't much of a runner. Norman
has shown the ability to click on the short stuff, but gets wild on
the long throws and also isn't much of a roll-out specialist. Garber
is reputed to be the poorest thrower of the group, although his per
l'ormance in Los Angeles Saturday was superb. But Garber is by
far the best runner, with his roll-outs a definite offensive threat.
Each of the three has had his good moments—and Ihey've all
had rough times as well. Norman was sharp against Rice, but miser
able at Northwestern. Nicolet was excellent against Washington and
good at UCLA, but couldn't get anywhere against the Air Force.
Garber's best showing was against the Bruins after he'd done not too
well in spot situations earlier in ihe season.
The summation of these performances indicates that with four
games yet to go, none of the three quarterbacks can be said to have
any sort of an inside track on the job. So, there remains the question
of how Curtice is going to pick his man.
Possible Solutions
From here, there appear to be several alternatives with reasons
for and against all of them:
1) Pick a starter and go with him all the way or until'his per
formance makes it evident thai he just doesn't have it in the par
ticular game. But how should Ihe starter be picked? Since each of
the three is best in a different phase of quarterbacking, Curtice
might select the one whose strength coincides with ihe opposition's
weakness. If, for example, USC has had no success in stopping roll
outs, Garber would get the starting nod.
The chief danger of trying lo go all the way with the starter is
the tendency to leave him in there when he doesn't have it. On the
other hand, the quarterback is bound to have a bit more confidence
when he knows he'll stay in the game as long as he's doing an ade
quate job.
2) Curtice could keep switching his quarterbacks throughout the
game, hoping that the constant variations in style would keep the
defense from becoming too set. This is what he did, to some extent,
in Los Angeles, when Garber opened the game with the touchdown
drive, but Nicolet took over the next time the Cards got the ball.
The disadvantage here, of course, is that there's a fair chance some
one who's hot may be replaced with someone who's having an off
day. Say. for example, that Nicolet had gone sour against the Bruins.
Then Curtice would have heard plenty of criticism for ever taking
Garber out in the first place. An advantage of constant switching,
besides forcing the defense to constantly readjust, is that a fresh
man is in action most of the time.
3) Curtice could also decide to look ahead to next year. Then he
would let Garber and Norman see most of the action, hoping to give
them enough chance to develop so that he'd start the '59 season with
two qualified and thoroughly-experienced quarterbacks. When *his
season had all the .earmarks of being a total loss, it looked as though
Curtice might just as well plan for '59. But now that there are good
hopes of salving the year (and faint hopes for even more) it doesn't
seem too likely that he'd neglect the current season for the future.
All this speculation brings out one more rather obvious question:
what does Curtice think he's going to do? So far, he doesn't seem
lo know —or, at least ,he won't say. When asked who's going to get
ihe nod this week, he's noncommittal. Will all three see lots of
action? He isn't sure.
Maybe He «l Make a Flanker Half
J
In reflecting on Garber's versatile showing Saturday, the thought
comes to mind that possibly two of the controversial three could be
used at the same time.
It wasn't so awfully long ago ((less than a year) that a few plays
like 39 Power Pass and 39 Reverse Power Pass got some nice yardage
for the Indians. These had backs other than the quarterback throw
ing the ball around, and usually caught the opposition by surprise.
Jack Taylor, a quarterback moved to flanker half, was one of the
prime reasons these seldom-used plays worked. Throw in Garber's
excellent running abilities with his passing and there arises the
question of just how would he do in the flanker spot, or even at the
inside half, for that matter.
