# Card Frosh Down JV's
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Good news and more good news
was the order of the day last Fri
day when the freshman football
team tangled with the junior var
sity club. Backs, ends, linemen,
in fact the whole frosh team
looked like they knew whal they
were out on the field for. The
final score was 14 to 8 with the
frosh winning.
Smith, Lindskog Passers
Both freshman touchdowns
were scored in the first quarter
as quarterbacks Jim Smith and
Stanley Lindskog directed fine

downfield drives. Both Smith and
Lindskog showed good passing
ability as they connected on a
healthy percentage of their at
tempts.
Steuber Looks Good
Hal Steuber showed surprising
versatility as he ran, caught
passes and stood out on defense.
End Marlin Walling lived up to
his billing as number one pass
catcher as he raked in everything
that came his way including one
thriller that bounced off his
hands twice and finally landed
in his grasp for a truly amazing

catch. Toby Hooker also looked
good at end and fullback Bill
Kuhn gained yardage consistent
ly.
To make things look even ros
ier, the line both offensively and
defensively turned in a fine per
formance. Chris Cottle, Jim Moe
and Dave Nolan did a good job
in keeping out JV defenders on
offense and Nolan particularly
stood out defensively. One goal
line stand late in the first half
must have been particularly
pleasing to coach Homer Smith
and his staff as the frosh made a
great effort in keeping the JV's
from crossing the goal line.
Frosh Plays
Smith says that this week,
which is the last one before the
freshman opening game with
Southern Cal this Saturday, will
be spent in polishing up the offen
sive attack. He said that the learn
looked better on offense than on
defense.
Smith said, "Defensive reaction
is the best measure of a football
player. If he does well defensive
ly, he should do well offensively.
It is Ihc coach's fault if he does
n't."
Craig Recovered
Just to make the good news
complete, Gary Craig, termed by
Smith the fastest back on the
team, has fully recovered from
his ankle injury and will be ready
to give SC's frosh trouble on Sat
urday.

to give SC's frosh trouble on Sat
urday.
Good news and more good news
was the order of the day last Fri
day when the freshman football
team tangled with the junior var
sity club. Backs, ends, linemen,
in fact the whole frosh team
looked like they knew whal they
were out on the field for. The
final score was 14 to 8 with the
frosh winning.
Smith, Lindskog Passers
Both freshman touchdowns
were scored in the first quarter
as quarterbacks Jim Smith and
Stanley Lindskog directed fine

downfield drives. Both Smith and
Lindskog showed good passing
ability as they connected on a
healthy percentage of their at
tempts.
Steuber Looks Good
Hal Steuber showed surprising
versatility as he ran, caught
passes and stood out on defense.
End Marlin Walling lived up to
his billing as number one pass
catcher as he raked in everything
that came his way including one
thriller that bounced off his
hands twice and finally landed
in his grasp for a truly amazing

catch. Toby Hooker also looked
good at end and fullback Bill
Kuhn gained yardage consistent
ly.
To make things look even ros
ier, the line both offensively and
defensively turned in a fine per
formance. Chris Cottle, Jim Moe
and Dave Nolan did a good job
in keeping out JV defenders on
offense and Nolan particularly
stood out defensively. One goal
line stand late in the first half
must have been particularly
pleasing to coach Homer Smith
and his staff as the frosh made a
great effort in keeping the JV's
from crossing the goal line.
Frosh Plays
Smith says that this week,
which is the last one before the
freshman opening game with
Southern Cal this Saturday, will
be spent in polishing up the offen
sive attack. He said that the learn
looked better on offense than on
defense.
Smith said, "Defensive reaction
is the best measure of a football
player. If he does well defensive
ly, he should do well offensively.
It is Ihc coach's fault if he does
n't."
Craig Recovered
Just to make the good news
complete, Gary Craig, termed by
Smith the fastest back on the
team, has fully recovered from
his ankle injury and will be ready
to give SC's frosh trouble on Sat
urday.
