# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Rapidly looming as one of the
top wingmen in the Pacific
Coast Conference, Burford has
been outstanding in every Card
game this season. A near 60-
minute man every week, he is
a standout defender and leads
the PCC in pass receiving with
25 catches. A junior from Oak
land.

A 203-pound sophomore from
Sacramento, Fernandes was
named the outstanding blocker
with Ihe unbeaten 1956 Pa
pooses. Sidelined last season
and half of his frosh year by a
knee injury, he has returned
this year to earn a spot on the
Card traveling squad. He
played tackle with the frosh.
