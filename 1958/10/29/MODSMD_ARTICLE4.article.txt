## 
### Camille Petersen Staff Editor 
Dr. G. Wallace Woodworth, im
mediate past director of the Har
vard Glee and Radcliffe Choral,
will direct a portion of the Stan
ford Chorus rehearsal tonight. It
is Woodworth's first visit since
he and Dr. Harold Schmidt, Stan
ford Choral director, christened
the Dinkelspiel rehearsal hall on
April 29, 1957.
Upon returning to Harvard in
January, Woodworth will assume
a full-time professorship in edu

cational television. "It is one of
the special professorships in this
field which are awarded for half
a year," he explained.
As part of his work with non
music majors, Woodworth will
give courses in the history of the
symphony with examples over ed
ucational television.
He has conducted a radio pro
gram entitled "This Week's Sym
phony" for eight years. On this
program he leads what he calls a
rehearsal for listeners" of the
week's Boston Symphony concert.
He plays recordings of the forth
coming concert and explains
them.
"Dr. Schmidt did a television
show on the training of the Har
vard Summer Chorus this sum
mer which was one of the most
interesting things I've ever seen,"
Woodworth said.
"Besides having a responsibil
ity to train good teachers and
professional musicians, colleges
have a responsibility to enlighten
the public musically. The people
are hungry for music and an un
derstanding of it. Educational TV
music programs are a good way
to provide this, and they can be
done anywhere with the right
technical facilities and crafts
manship," Woodworth said.
