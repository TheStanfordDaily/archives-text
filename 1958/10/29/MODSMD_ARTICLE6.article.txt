### Lynn Delargey 
Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States from 1901 to
1909, made significant changes in the character of the Presidency
and of the federal administration, stated Dr. Thomas Barclay, Tues
day Evening Series speaker.
Barclay, a Democrat and retired professor of political science, em-

phasized the Republican Roose
velt's "new nationalism," now an
integral part of American gov
ernment: the concept that cco
nomic and social problems could
be solved only by greatly in
creased federal regulation.
Urging labor legislation, adop
tion of a federal income tax, and
regulation of interstate com
merce, Roosevelt "proposed near
ly every reform made during the
Wilson and Taft administra
tions." lie insisted upon "the
present broad powers of the fed
eral government under the com
merce clause."
Barclay's address was part of
the Stanford observance of the
centennial of Roosevelt's birth.
Roosevelt left office still a
young and energetic man, reluc
tant to give up the power which
he frankly enjoyed, and became
embittered as his influence de
clined. Seeing dangers to a de
mocracy in the continuing power
of any one man, Roosevelt re
solved not to run again, but Bar
clay believes TR could have been
President again if he had lived.
"My guess is that he would
have been nominated in 1920 and
would have won the election. The
country would then have been
spared the dreary normalcy and
easy virtue of the Harding admin
istration. and the cautious, un
imaginative era of Calvin Cool
idge which prepared the way for
the great economic depression
and the collapse of the Republi
can Party."
