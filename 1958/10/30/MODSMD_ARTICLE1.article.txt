# Little Theatre Production Uplifts Williams' 'Orpheus'
## 
### Dan McCall 
Fortunately, the Stanford pro
j duction of Tennessee Williams'
"Orpheus Descending," which
opened last evening in the Little
| Theatre, is far superior to the
play. \
The movement of practical
staging is intriguing for both nu
ance and perception. Director
Robert Loper's mature hand leads
competent actors to rise occasion
ally to points of fine theater.
Margaret Landry
As Lady, Margaret Landry re
veals (at least in her final scenes)
i the great and confused vitality
| reminiscent of the Amanda Wing
field of a sounder Williams ven
i ture; she is a woman not only
clinging to a past, but desperately
attempting to recreate it. Colon
Brown as Val is best in the dark
ness of his quiet moments when
strumming his guitar or his
woman.
Effectively balancing his cool
ness is Carol Moscrip, both burn
ing and burned, who often has
near poctic punches of young will
searching for flight from the
false fire of neon. The well-con
ceived, well-executed character of
Dick Jagua has captured the pow
er of approaching death. What
Joan Hays and Jim Lyon may
lack in subtlety they make up for
in vitality.
Scenic Design
The most effective and exciting
element of the production is the
scenic design of .Richard Hay.
i Both functional and beautiful, his
setting affords the required
translucence in the desperate at
tempt of souls to reach release
through escape as well as the
| firm opacity of imposed earth
! bound frustration.
Fire, a leitmotif, runs from sin
gle candle flame through flashing
j red lights of vision to final con
sumption. Unfortunately instead
j of tightened dramatic strings the
I resolutions are contrivances.
Orpheus, alas, descends. The
, play precipitates flown symbolic
unswept stairs grasping at me
chanical supports which either
break under its uneven weight or
simply dissolve into shrouded fur
niture. Orpheus falls flat on his
scarred face into southern mud.
Melodramatic
This is the basic fault of the
work: though darkly beautiful
and momentarily poetic it too
often runs into melodrama. The
play leaves too many questions
unanswered violating all econ
omy and focus.
Talented people demonstrating
both intelligence and imagination
I should not find it necessary to
select an Orpheus in which Wil
liams surely descends to new
lows.

break under its uneven weight or
simply dissolve into shrouded fur
niture. Orpheus falls flat on his
scarred face into southern mud.
Melodramatic
This is the basic fault of the
work: though darkly beautiful
and momentarily poetic it too
often runs into melodrama. The
play leaves too many questions
unanswered violating all econ
omy and focus.
Talented people demonstrating
both intelligence and imagination
I should not find it necessary to
select an Orpheus in which Wil
liams surely descends to new
lows.

CURTAIN TIME IX TEN MINUTES
Performers make last-minute backstage preparations before last night's opening of
"Orpheus Descending"
Fortunately, the Stanford pro
j duction of Tennessee Williams'
"Orpheus Descending," which
opened last evening in the Little
| Theatre, is far superior to the
play. \
The movement of practical
staging is intriguing for both nu
ance and perception. Director
Robert Loper's mature hand leads
competent actors to rise occasion
ally to points of fine theater.
Margaret Landry
As Lady, Margaret Landry re
veals (at least in her final scenes)
i the great and confused vitality
| reminiscent of the Amanda Wing
field of a sounder Williams ven
i ture; she is a woman not only
clinging to a past, but desperately
attempting to recreate it. Colon
Brown as Val is best in the dark
ness of his quiet moments when
strumming his guitar or his
woman.
Effectively balancing his cool
ness is Carol Moscrip, both burn
ing and burned, who often has
near poctic punches of young will
searching for flight from the
false fire of neon. The well-con
ceived, well-executed character of
Dick Jagua has captured the pow
er of approaching death. What
Joan Hays and Jim Lyon may
lack in subtlety they make up for
in vitality.
Scenic Design
The most effective and exciting
element of the production is the
scenic design of .Richard Hay.
i Both functional and beautiful, his
setting affords the required
translucence in the desperate at
tempt of souls to reach release
through escape as well as the
| firm opacity of imposed earth
! bound frustration.
Fire, a leitmotif, runs from sin
gle candle flame through flashing
j red lights of vision to final con
sumption. Unfortunately instead
j of tightened dramatic strings the
I resolutions are contrivances.
Orpheus, alas, descends. The
, play precipitates flown symbolic
unswept stairs grasping at me
chanical supports which either
break under its uneven weight or
simply dissolve into shrouded fur
niture. Orpheus falls flat on his
scarred face into southern mud.
