STOCKHOLM, Sweden (/P)
Russian author Boris Pasternak
turned down the $41,420 Nobel
Literature Prize Wednesday. The
writer who dared criticize life
under Communist rule has been
under almost ceaseless Soviet
press attack since the prize was
announced Saturday.
Because of the meaning attrib
uted to this award in the society
I live in I ought to say no thanks
to the undeserved prize awarded
me," he cabled. "Do not take my
voluntary refusal with any iil
will."
This cable to the Swedish Royal
Academy was a switch for the (W
-year-old author of the novel "Doc
tor Zhivago." Last Saturday he
had cabled the academy: "Im
mensely thankful, touched, proud,
astonished, abashed."
Youth Attack
The attack on him was taken
up Wednesday by a leader of the
Soviet youth organization, Kom
somol. He demanded that Paster
nak get out of the Soviet Union
because he has "defiled those by
whose toil he lives and breathes."
Pasternak's book was ignored
in the Soviet Union after its com
pletion in 195f>. It was rejected
for publication there but he got
into print in the West and is be
ing widely read.
Not until the Nobel Literature
Committee had announced last
week that Pasternak was its 1958
winner was there any Soviet re
action.
Trick Charged
Soviet newspapers charged that
the award was a Western trick to
fan the cold war, that political
implications were involved. The
Nobel Literature Committe was
denounced.
Then the Nobel Physics award
was made Monday to three top
Soviet scientists whose achieve
ments in nuclear physics have
swelled Soviet pride.
This award put the Russians in
an awkward position. Could they
denounce the Literature Prize and
accept proudly the Physics Prize?
The answer from Moscow Wed
nesday was yes.
