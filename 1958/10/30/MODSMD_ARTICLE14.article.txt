'Ihe jollou ing arc excerpts from an editorial on Prop
osition 111 printed in the Jan. 7lit issue of The Daily.
We concur with llii>. stand set forth in that editorial:

A\ i,\(;knioi s i*jkck of legislation lias been making tlie rounds of
stale legislatures for the past few years. Known popularly as
"right to work legislation, this group ol proposed laws has
achieved much support from business concerns and much oppo
sition from organized labor. . . .
It is maintained by backers of right-to-work laws that every
person has the inherent right to work where he so chooses. They
maintain that everv employer has the inherent right to employ
or to discharge whomsoever he so chooses. It is also claimed by
them that passage of these laws will not impair the good that has
been accomplished bv organized labor.
Actually, if these laics arc passed, it will mean that
an employee cannot be compelled to join the union that
lias a collective bargaining agreement with the company
jor which he works. Whether he joins a union or not is
entirely up to him.
On the face of it, this seems like a good idea. Why should
someone he forced to join an organization he does not want to
join? Why should lie have to pay dues to an organization that
did not get his job for him in the first place?
Unions are based upon collective security. I hey exist on the
principle "All for one and one for all, without which there could
not he security. Now, one defective girder might not cause a
structure to collapse, hut enough of them would. A pertinent
question at this point would be, "Does an employee have the right
to exist in his employment outside the society of employees? . . .
Unions have been a far greater force for goad than
(or evil. Much of the high standard of living en joyed
bv the laboring man must be attributed to the fact that
unions exist to insure and to protect that standard.
There is little doubt as to the ultimate goal that advocators
of "right to work" laws seek. That is the eventual breakdown of
American labor unions. I hose who want to see the return of the
labor wars of the past should by all means support "right to work"
laws. The laboring man who has en joyed the benefits of collective
security will not calmly sit back and watch that very collective
security drop from underneath him.
If it is true that labor unions are too powerful and are he
coming a destructive factor in the American economy, then by all
means we should provide curbs. But one does not stop the de
stine! iveness of a rampaging river by removing it or separating
it into individual droplets. Instead, one channels it into the right
course: one builds dams to control the force, providing at the same
time more usefulness in the form of electrical energy and irriga
tion water.
' Might to work" laws are, in fact, "right to destroy unions"
laws. Let us not he fooled by tricky labels. Recognize right-to
work laws for what tliev are, and act accordingly.

A\ i,\(;knioi s i*jkck of legislation lias been making tlie rounds of
stale legislatures for the past few years. Known popularly as
"right to work legislation, this group ol proposed laws has
achieved much support from business concerns and much oppo
sition from organized labor. . . .
It is maintained by backers of right-to-work laws that every
person has the inherent right to work where he so chooses. They
maintain that everv employer has the inherent right to employ
or to discharge whomsoever he so chooses. It is also claimed by
them that passage of these laws will not impair the good that has
been accomplished bv organized labor.
Actually, if these laics arc passed, it will mean that
an employee cannot be compelled to join the union that
lias a collective bargaining agreement with the company
jor which he works. Whether he joins a union or not is
entirely up to him.
On the face of it, this seems like a good idea. Why should
someone he forced to join an organization he does not want to
join? Why should lie have to pay dues to an organization that
did not get his job for him in the first place?
Unions are based upon collective security. I hey exist on the
principle "All for one and one for all, without which there could
not he security. Now, one defective girder might not cause a
structure to collapse, hut enough of them would. A pertinent
question at this point would be, "Does an employee have the right
to exist in his employment outside the society of employees? . . .
Unions have been a far greater force for goad than
(or evil. Much of the high standard of living en joyed
bv the laboring man must be attributed to the fact that
unions exist to insure and to protect that standard.
There is little doubt as to the ultimate goal that advocators
of "right to work" laws seek. That is the eventual breakdown of
American labor unions. I hose who want to see the return of the
labor wars of the past should by all means support "right to work"
laws. The laboring man who has en joyed the benefits of collective
security will not calmly sit back and watch that very collective
security drop from underneath him.
If it is true that labor unions are too powerful and are he
coming a destructive factor in the American economy, then by all
means we should provide curbs. But one does not stop the de
stine! iveness of a rampaging river by removing it or separating
it into individual droplets. Instead, one channels it into the right
course: one builds dams to control the force, providing at the same
time more usefulness in the form of electrical energy and irriga
tion water.
' Might to work" laws are, in fact, "right to destroy unions"
laws. Let us not he fooled by tricky labels. Recognize right-to
work laws for what tliev are, and act accordingly.
