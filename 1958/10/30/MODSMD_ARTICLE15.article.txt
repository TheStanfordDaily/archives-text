# Nominations Open

### 
Nominations are now being accepted for fall elections, ami this
requires serious thinking on the part of the students.
To he elected this fall are 14 representatives to Legislature,
four to the judicial councils and three freshman class officers.
Kverv year there is the complaint that the same people are
running for office, and it is true that the same people are candi
dates. Hut vvliv is tliis so? If students are asked why they do not
run for a student office, they first of all claim they do not have
Ihe lime and the\ then contend that the government is in
ell'ecl i \ e.
The duties involved in any student office Hike time,
but more participation by all students would decrease
the time each individual liail to spend.
There is a minority of students who see a future in the student
government and \sho are willing to work for it. Hut even tlie\
will become discouraged when they find they have little student
backing and aid: thev, too, must study, and hence the accomplish
ments of the student government are sometimes negligible.
Thus conies the charge of the ineffectiveness of student gov
ernment. But the logical answer to this charge is: Are the stu
dents as a whole willing to make their government effective?
Many of the things which are at present chiefly stu
dent-organized for instance, women's housing — could
easily he assumed by the I niversity administration. But
the administration moves with the idea that students
leant to have a voice in such matters because the students
claim they do u ant to be heard. Ihe students actions
do not prove this.
(loncrete student action could make I residder Memorial I nion
a reality, rather than a blueprint on the architect s drawing board.
II will eventually be built, to he sure, but il the students were
willing to work for the Union —which will benefit them most ol
all construction could be begun almost immediately.
ASSU elections should not become popularity contests: they
should embrace serious ideas as to the future of the student gov
ernment. Il is onl\ by an active student interest in the projects
and policies of the ASSU that anything of value can he accom
plished.
