# Strategic Island Haunted by War
## 
### 
Washington — Formosa faces
faces Red China over 100 miles of
shallow water. Okinawa lies 365
miles to the northeast, the Philip
pines only 225 miles to the south.
As the main remnant of Nation
alist China and an Asian bastion
of the free world, Formosa's pos
ition is chronically precarious.
The past of the strategic island
also is haunted by war and con
quest, the National Geographic
Society recalls. It has been a
pirate lair; a colonial outpost of
the Dutch. Spanish, and French;
a model colony and war base of
the Japanese. V-J Day reverted
the island to Chinese rule, which
has prevailed off and on since
the 13th century.
Intensive Use of Land
The vigor of Formosa's farms
and factories makes it a prize.
Shaped like a tobacco leaf, 240-
mile-long Formosa is about twice
the size of New Jersey. It is lush
and mountainous, with silvery
streams and waterfalls. The island
turns a rugged spine towards the
Pacific. The towering peaks grad
uate into terraced slopes and
plains that stretch to the island's
western shore. Hence its Chinese
name Taiwan, meaning "Terraced
Bay."
Something is planted in nearly
every square inch of tillable soil:
rice, sugar cane, wheat, pine
apples, vegetables, or tobacco.
Two, three, even four crops can
be grown yearly. At harvest time,
rice is spread on highways and
streets to dry.
The island supports, to the best
of its considerable ability, some
9,300,000 people, including 2,000,-
000 who in effect suddenlly "came
to dinner." They are the anti-
Communist Chinese who followed
General Chiang Kai-shek from the
mainland in 1949.
In normal times Formosa could
earn its way easily—it was one of
the wealthiest Chinese provinces.
But the wartime economy has put

hundreds of thousands of young
men into uniform, making them
consumers rather than producers.
Yet. with American aid and ad
vice, Formosa has actually exper
ienced a rebirth in the last decade.
The living standard, by Asian
levels, is high. Nearly every
home, however modest, has elect
ric lights. Farmers have almost
tripled the output of their tiny
farms.
A peaceful land revolution be
gan in 1949. with reduced rentals.
Since then tenant farmers have
been permitted to buy land form
erly held by the government and
absentee landlords. As no man
may own more land than he can
till, holdings now average about
three acres.
Island Being Industrialized
New industries have sprouted
like stands of bamboo. These are
turning out a host of consumer
products — aluminum ware, bi
cycles, electrical appliances, jeeps,
and refrigerators. Textiles, paper,
bags of fertilizer and cement, tons
of coal, and vast amounts of
power flow from modern plants.
One refinery produces fuel for
jet planes.
Native Formosans are mostly
Chinese, for settlers have been
trickling over} from the mainland
since the 6th century. Some 150,-
000 aborigines still live secretive
lives in the mountains. They have
been prevailed upon to give up
head-hunting, and are mingling
more and more with the outside
world.
Curiously, one tribe can rarely
understand another's dialect. They
communicate in the language of
a former conqueror- Japanese.
