# Opportunity Unequaled Here for Going Abroad
## 
### Werner Warmbrunn Foreign Student Adviser 
The interest of Stanford stu
dents in traveling, studying and
living abroad is increasing at a
rapid rate. The growing partici
pation in the American Field
Service, in the Experiment in In
ternational Living, and in sum
mer tours, as well as the great in
terest shown in "Stanford in Ger
many," all point in the same di
rection.
With all this interest in over
seas ventures it is important to
remember that we have an un
equaled opportunity for "going
abroad" right here on our own
campus: We share our class
rooms. our dormitories, our din
ing halls with more than 400 for
eign students from over 50 coun
tries of the world.
Great Advantage
"Going abroad" by becoming
well acquainted with one or more
students from overseas on our
campus has one great advantage
over foreign travel (apart from
the fact that it is considerably
less expensive) because there is
time to develop a friendship
throughout the academic year,
from the casualness of the initial
coffee cup to whatever depth the
relationship may eventually at
tain. And in addition, interna
tional students can provide much
useful information about their
home countries for Americans
who plan to travel or study
abroad.
Why then did 35 per cent of the
foreign students consulted in a
recent survey believe that Ameri
can students are not really inter
ested in making friends? Un
doubtedly there are many reasons
for this sentiment, but the chief
explanation may be that we
Americans frequently behave
more casually than we intend to,
that we appear to have many "ac
quaintances" but few close
friends.
Feel Isolated
Yet there is much evidence, as
the discussions in The Daily after
the Cordry affair last year
showed, that many American stu
dents feel quite isolated, sense the
lack of real friends, want related
ness and sharing and good intel
lectual conversation. And many
American students have discov
ered in recent years that friend
ships with overseas students can
provide intellectual stimulation
and significant insights because
the basic need for friendship and
sharing is the same all over the
world. Only the outward mani
festations differ.
How can American and foreign
students meet? Most important
ly, in the common life of a univer
sity campus, in classes, dorms
and activities. All that is needed
is that initial push, the readiness
to overcome that first shyness,
the willingness to go a little more
than half-way to meet "The Stran
ger."
Times, Places
Then there are special times
and places for international ac
tivities: the Cosmo Club Coffee
Hour in Bowman Alumni House
every Friday from 4 to 6, the"I"
Club Dances, the Saturday Eve
ning Firesides at the"I" Center,

and the lIR - sponsored weekend
hostels and excursions such as
the vacation trips to Mexico and
to the Grand Canyon. And since
last N'ovember we have the Liter
national Center.
For this has been one of the
main reasons why the University
decided to establish the Center on
the Row. apart from the obvious
services which it renders to inter
national students: It provides a
home where American students
can come, almost any time of day,
to meet foreign students casually.
The University will measure
the usefulness of the Center, in
the final analysis, in terms of its

j success in helping American and
overseas students to become ac
quainted, socially and intellectu
ally, and, therefore, providing a
broader and more meaningful ed
ucation to all Stanford men and
women.
