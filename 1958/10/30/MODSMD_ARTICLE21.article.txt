# I-Center Starts Host Program
## 
### 
A hosting service was intro
duced at the International Center
last week for a trial period this
quarter. The hosts are American
students interested in foreign stu
dent affairs, and foreign students
themselves may also take part in
the scheme.
There will be two hosts at the
I-Center from 1-6 p.m. each Mon
day through Friday, to welcome
new visitors to the Center and to
give general assistance whenever
necessary.
The facilities of the Center now
include ping-pong, draughts,
chess, and a record player and
there is a wide selection of lead
ing material. Refreshments are
available.
It is hoped that this hosting
service will encourage still more
foreign and American students
to spend a little time at the
I-Center, and if successful it will
be continued next quarter.
