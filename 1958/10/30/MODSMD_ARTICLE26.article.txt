# Planes Sainted By flying Club

A flying circus at Stanford?
Not really. Those red, white, and
orange airplanes that fly over
campus all the time belong to the
Stanford Flying Club.
The orange stripes on wing
tips and tail were added in the in
terest of safety when the aircraft
were repainted recently. (That
dayglow orange can be seen for
miles.)
Some 40 Stanford students sat
isfy their urge to fly with the two
club planes, a Chief and a Champ
ion. Both planes have only 65 hp
engines, but are capable of al
most 90 mph in level flight.
The SFC was started two years
ago by frustrated Stanford pilots
who couldn't afford commercial
plane rental rates. Both aircraft
are based at the Palo Alto air
port. This is handy to school, but
power lines, a radio mast nearby,
and a down draft at the end of
the runway keeps the flyers on
their toes.
The club initiation fee is $50,
which is returned when the mem
ber drops out, and $5.00 monthly
dues. Flying is $3.00 per hour.
