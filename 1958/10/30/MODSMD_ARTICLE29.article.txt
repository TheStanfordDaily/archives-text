### 
Two women students are the
first to receive full tuition music
scholarships through the Ben and
Bertha Solnit Memorial Fund.
They are Helen M. Jan/en, a
senior, and Mrs. Colleen Bicknell,
a graduate student. Both are
planning to be music teachers.
The Solnit Memorial Fund was
set up in 1955 on the death of Ben
Solnit.
