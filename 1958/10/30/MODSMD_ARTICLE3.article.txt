# Servos Named Stern Adviser
## 
### 
Kurt M. Servos, assistant pro
fessor of mineralogy, has been
appointed faculty resident for the
Serra and Donner houses of Stern
Hall, according to Associate Dean
of Students William C. Craig.
Adoption of the faculty resi
dent plan for Stern is part of a
move toward closer ties between
faculty and dormitory residents.
A second phase of the program
is the appointment of "faculty as
sociates" who drop in from time
to time for meals or informal
talks in the lounges.
Servos joins Wilfred H. Stone,
professor of English, faculty resi
dent for the new Muir and Bur
bank houses of Stern. Servos will
live in an apartment in Serra
House.
He came to Stanford in 1907
from the New York State Mu
seum, where he was curator of
mineralogy.
