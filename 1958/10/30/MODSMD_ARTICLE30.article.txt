# Renker Sees Bright Future for Netters
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team, which
finished second in last year's
NCAA tournament, has begun its
fall round - robin play to decide
who will be this year's six
starters.
The Indian netters, who finish
ed second behind USC in the Na
tional Collegiate championships,
lost only three members of last
year's traveling squad. The three
departed players are Robin Hilge
man, Gil While and Jack Douglas,
the latter being last year's ace.
Most teams would be hard hit
by the loss of a player of Douglas'
caliber', but Stanford coach Bob
Renker has high hopes that a suc
cessor to Douglas can be found
from the coach's two top men.
Dave Nelson and Dick Ogden.
Nelson, last year's No. 2 man,
began to look like a possible suc
cessor to Douglas with some fine
end'of-the-season play last year,

and Ogden, on 1 y a sophomore,
showed enough class last year as
a freshman to make him also a
favorite for the lop role.
Other players who so far this
fall have .shown up as strong con
tenders for the squad's traveling
berths are veterans Jim Jeffries,
Brooks Rawlins, Lowell Carruth,
Dick Gould, Dick Mosk and Gil
Ranney and sophomores Norm
Karris and Phil Odegard.
The round-robin play will con
tinue the rest of this quarter and
half of winter quarter, with Ihe
six players with the best records
gaining places in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Tour ney
to bo played in February.
Coach Renker feels that this
year's squad has the potential to
move up to the nation's top spot,
provided his players come along
at a pace consistent with their
abilities.
