# Tough Battle Ahead as Cards Face Fast Troy
## 
### 
Southern California will be try
ing to perform a feat this Satur
day which they haven't been able
to do in two years—win two
games back to back.
According to assistant football
coach Bob Ghilotti, who scouted
I he Trojans in their 1-4-6 win over
Washington State, they have just
the material to do it.
"You can describe them as a
team having good size with good
speed," said Ghilotti. Troy has a
heavy line lead by tackles Monte
Clark, 219 pounds, and sophomore
Dan Ficca, 230 pounds. Outstand
ing at guard is All-Coast second
stringer Frank Fiorentino, 230-
pound senior.
McKeever Twins
One of iho McKeever twins,
Marlin, is the Trojans' most out
standing end. Marlin played a
great game a g a in s t California
two weeks ago, sharing the South
land's praise with the Bears' Joe
Kapp.
At ihe other end is sophomore
George Van Vliet. The most expe
rienced position on Ihe team is
center, held by hustling team cap
tain Ken Antle.
In Ihe backfield, where Troy
seems to he having trouble be
cause of fumbles, there is plenty
of speed. Speedy quarterback
Willie Wood is back in action
after injuries forced him to miss
most of the games this season.
He played against Washington
State and threw the game-win
ning pass to converted end Mil
lard Hill.
Hill has taken over the left half
position after penalized senior
Rex Johnson had completed his
five games. On the touchdown
play Hill outran Ihe Cougar sec
ondary to catch the 40-yard pass
and raced 30 yards to the score.
Speedy Receivers
Speedy receivers like Hill, who
is a San Francisco 49ers draft
choice, Marlin McKeever and
sophomore standout Angclo Coia
at right half could cause a lot of
trouble in the Indian secondary.
However, SC isn't primarily a
passing team. Wood rolls out to
the right or left on the option but
he usually runs with the ball. Be
sides Wood the Trojans have
more good runners in junior full
back Clark Holden and Coia. the
latter being the best outside run
ner on the USC squad.
The outlook for the Trojans
is good if the backs can only
learn to hang on to the pigskin

and if the defensive unit can stop
the unnecessary roughness penal
ties. The two fumble kings. John
son and Tony Ortega, are no long
er on the squad because of PCC
penalties, so perhaps the first of
1 hese problems is solved. .The
Washington State game would
seem to prove this as Troy lost
the ball only once.
Penalties
But the penalties continue to
pile up and at crucial moments.
It was a 15-yard roughness pen
alty which gave California the
ball on Southern Cal's one-yard
line after it seemed that Ihe Tro
jans had held the Bears on the
13. Cal's drive started on a re
covered SC fumble inside the 10.
Spectators on Saturday might
prepare themselves for the unex
pected as far as extra points are
concerned. The Trojans have been
trying all kinds of formations in
an effort to ihrow the opposition
off guard. However, in most cases
so far the long counts and com
plicated shifts have resulted in
delay -of - the - game penalties
against SC.

Of the four Southern Cal losses
this season three have come be
cause of the new 1- or 2-point rul
ing. They lost to Michigan 19-20,
to North Carolina T-S. and to Cali
fornia 12-14, a game in which the
Trojans reportedly outplayed the
high-riding Bears.
