More Words About Sid
Sidney J. Garbei* has made about tlie biggest smash of the season
on the local sports pages since his "unexpected" and "surprising"
showing at quarterback last week as the Tribe downed UCLA, 21-19.
One column after another has mentioned prominently this Garber
boy as a secret weapon and coming out (if nowhere to lead Stanford
to victory. And now me.
It must have been particularly amazing to Los Angeles' fans, who
are certainly by now wondering where in the world Stanford gets its
never-ending supply of quarterbacks. Checked into that little black
bag trainer Connie Jarvis takes out on the field? Maybe he has
something in there that turns most anybody into a quarterback. The
San Francisco Chronicle's Will Connolly thinks that maybe there is
a mine of quarterbacks up in the hills behind the Farm.
Personally, I don't care where we get them, just so they keep
turning in these standout per-

formances.
Actually, Garber wasn't so "un
known." Any follower of the for
tunes of Stanford's.' freshmen two
years ago would remember Sid as
1 lie fellow who guided the I'a
pooses to an unbeaten season . . .
one climaxed by a 33-13 romp over
the California Frosh.
About all that anybody was
giving Sid credit for at the sea
son's start was his running. We
always knew he could do that.
UCLA now also knows he can do
that, (iarber showed broken-field
tendencies at LA last week that
many of the halfbacks around
this conference aren't blessed
with having. A little fake here
and a little fake there left numer
ous Bruins tackling air.
The Southland papers said Gar
ber called a "good, if unorthodox"
game. About this unorthodox
business: that's good, if it doesn't
get out of hand. Sid was in for
his share of verbal blasts when

he brought the Tribe out to run on a fourth-and-seven situation late
in the Bruin clash.
I can remember muttering, "About all they can do is kick> lead
ing by two points."
To be sure, a punt would have put the Bruins deep in their own
territory with time running out. But they might have scored. Si<l,
firmly believing that scoring is made more difficult when the other
team has the ball, brought the Tribe out to keep the ball. He nomi
nated himself, in fact, and then scampered 14 yards through eleven
amazed and hopeless Bruins to a first down. And we all wondered,
"Why, of course, that was easy."
One Vote for Unorthodoxy
The element of surprise greatly enhances a football attack. When
a quarterback gets to the point where he is predictable, then there
isn't much effort to defense.
The boys from Washington State are the Coast's . . . maybe the
nation's . . . foremost exponents of unorthodoxy. On offense, while
the Cougars often slip on defense, nobody has lately accused them
of having an impotent offense.
One time that signal-caller Bob Newman stuck to orthodox play
calling was last year at Stanford Stadium. He had to. With three
and one-half minutes left and his team down 18-7, what else could he
do but pass? Unfortunately, lie passed.
This season, in their 40-6 opening romp over the Cards, the Cougs
resorted to a certain amount of unorthodoxy. For them. They didn't
Ihrow a pass on their first touchdown drive. But the real surprise
came in picking up their fourth touchdown.
Stanford had just scored its lone TD. with 30 seconds remaining
in the first half. WSC put the ball in play with 20 seconds left and
their second string in the game. Leading. 20-6, this would be a good
spot to just run out the clock.
But the subs weren't -going to leave the field without having their
fling. So they decided to pass. Not only pass, but Iry a little razzle
dazzle. So quarterback Dave Wilson took, the bail and faked a
reverse to the wingback and scampered all over the backfield before
stopping and cutting loose. End Gail Cogdili was nearly out of sight
flown the field . . . behind the Stanford defense . . . but Wilson found
him and it was a 72-yard scoring play.
Any bearing on the outcome? Well, that was quite a blow to
Ihe Cards, whose morale had suddenly risen a great deal with their
score. Twenty to six would not have been too big a lead to overcome
with a good second-half rally. But instead, it was 28-6, and the crush
ing blow had been landed.
John Brown's Boclv Can Move
While Soutblunders' were no doubt amazed as to Stanford's con
tinuing supply of quarterbacks, we Stanfords were a bit amazed that
up until Saturday end John Brown of the Bruins had been a second
stringer.
Of course, Brown had been playing behind "All-American" Dick
Wallen . . bui if Wallen ever showed the speed and shades-of-R. C.
Owens ability that John Brown displayed last week ... it wasn't on
the football field. Wallen was THE boy to get the big A-A push in
l,ov Angeles last year. And he got pushed.
Wallen was good (not quite a Tommy Fears ... as San) would
have you believe in calling him UCLA's all-time best), but it looked
as if Brown was potentially great. It would have been interesting
lo see how Wallen would have fared in an offense where the threat
of the run wasn't so great. At WSC or Stanford, he might have been
looking for bench space.
