# Auburnâ€”Defensive Mind
## 
### 
AUBURN. Ala. Sometimes,
says coach Ralph (Shugi Jordan,
Auburn seems a trifle too defense
minded.
And that pretty well sums up
what some eager Auburn enthusi
asts have had to say about the
failure of the nation's No. 4 foot
ball team to mount a high-scoring
offense.
The Tigers have won 18 of their
last 19 games and tied one. Seven
limes during that long stretch of

undefeated performances they
have triumphed by less than two
touchdowns.
In their five appearances this
season, the Plainsmen have mark
ed up the best defensive record in
the country, holding opponents to
a stingy 108.6 yards a game. But,
in Ihe process, Auburn has scored
only 78 points, well below the
pace set by the top three teams
LSU, lowa and Army.
