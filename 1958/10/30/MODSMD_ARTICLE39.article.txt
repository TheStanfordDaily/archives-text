# Former Jordan Student at Occidental Now Assistant Track Coach on Farm
## 
### 
When Jim Terrill, Stanford's
new assistant track coach, was
running the middle distances for
head track coach Payton Jordan,
back in 1954 and 1955 at Occiden
tal College, little did he imagine
that he would be assistant to his
coach just four years later at
Stanford.
It seems that Coach Jordan had
his eye on the speedy middle-dis
tance runner for some time, even
before Terrill began to set records
in the mile and half-mile as a I
senior physical education major I
at Occidental.
Was Captain
During his last year before
graduation. Terrill served as cap-1
tain of both ihe cross-country and |
ihe varsity track teams, setting,
mile records for the conference
and stadium as well as the USC '
dual meet record, best lime being
4:09.9.
After graduating, Terrill stayed i

at Occidental to study education
as a graduate student and worked
under Coach Jordan as co-fresh
man track coach in 1955.
On completion of his graduate
work he went into the Air Force
as a second lieutenant, running on
track teams while in the service
which took him to Texas, Japan,
Korea and Hawaii.
Record
While in Hawaii he was on a
record - breaking team there and
j ran in the United States, taking
I second place in the SOO-mcter run
1 of the Compton Invitational with
I the time of 1:48.5. In the Fort
Worth Invitational he set the meet i

record for the 880, timed at 1:53.1.
"I am happy to ho at Stanford,
and 1 only hope I can follow
through with Coach Jordan's ex
pectations after the faith and
trust he and the athletic depart
ment vested in me," said Coach
Terrill, going on to say:
Happy at Farm
"I am optimistic about tlit 1 for
tunes of !he Stanford track team
and feel that progress is being
made, each meet bringing us clos
er to our goal of a national-caliber
track team.
