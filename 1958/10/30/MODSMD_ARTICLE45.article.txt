# Ed Council Offers Liason, Social Organization, Academic Criticism
## 
### Walt Wurfel 
With a flair for purposeful or
ganization, students in the Educa
tion Department have developed
a group known as the Educational
Council to provide many other
wise nonexistent services both to
faculty and students.
The council, composed of stu
dent representatives from each of
the major academic education
classes, performs three functions
for the education department and
its students.
Service is the first of these.
President Larry Locks describes
this function as one which does
jobs "which no one else either
cares to do or can do."
Evaluation
The development and adminis
tration of regular evalutation and
criticicm of education school fa
culty and courses is one of these
services. Others include provid
ing dictograph machines, type
writers, telephones and basic off
ice services which are not avail
able elsewhere to student groups.
The Education Lounge on the

third floor- of Cubberly is one of;
the most widely used of the Coun- j
cil's services. According to Locke
this is the only area on campus
provided especially for the relaxa
tion and enjoyment of students
which has such features as tele
vision, refreshment vending ma-;
chines and a kitchen.
The second function of the
Council is a communication job. I
The organization serves as a liai-1
son between students in the de- j
partment and faculty members, j
and operates on the thesis that
understanding can be furthered
through constant contact and dis
cussion between students and fac
ulty.
Social Function
The social function of the Ed
ucation Council is furthered in
several ways. The Education
Lounge provides an informal at
mosphere for social contact. In
addition coffee is often served
free of charge.
Though the council is several
years old some criticism of it

has been brought up by students.
One of the chief of these has
been that because representatives
are elected at the beginning of
each quarter there has been too
much shifting around and too
little coordination.
At present a committee is work
ing to consider the problem of
ammending the Council's consti
tution.
