# Kingston Trio Will Hang 'Tom Dooley' Here Monday
## 
### 
They're going to hang Tom Dooley from the rafters of the Pavilion
Monday night at 8:30.
That's when the famed Kingston Trio comes back "home" to Stan
ford for a one-shot hanging for the benefit of the sophomore class.
Tickets for the performance will lie on sale today, Friday and Mon-

flay at Engineering Corner, the
Cellar and the Post Office. The
price is $1.50.
This newest group of the folk
singing rage is just back from a
tour of New York's Blue Angel
and Hawaii night spots. It was a
tour that started in June 1956—
that's when Dave Guard, leader
of the group, graduated from
Stanford.
Actually it started earlier than
that when Dave joined up with
Bob Shane, of Menlo College, and
Nick Reynolds to play at Stan
ford rallies and at the local beer
palaces, Rossotti's, The Cracked
Pot, et al.
Since then the trip has grown
to San Francisco's Purple Onion
and Hungry i and to television on
Playhouse 90.
The national reputation of the
group took a big jump last June
when Capitol released their first
long-playing record. It was a very
small edition, 120 pressings, and
12 of them went to Hage's Music
Store in Palo Alto.
From that conservative begin
ning the LP became a nation-wide
best seller in a matter of weeks
and one song in particular, Tom
Dooley, is currently number two
in the San Francisco hit parade.
