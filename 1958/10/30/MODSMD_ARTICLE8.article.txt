The noble and witty journalist?* «»C tin* Chaparral
certainly <I«> not cxpoct the daily to be a first-rate
puhlicat ion; but there arc certain fiiiiiirniun stand
ards we do expect «»f you, and these arc sadly lack
ing in your challenge of this morning.
you an* guilty of misrepresentation ami
distortion of the farts; the* men of the daily- wliat
few there really are (Jo not have a reputation
of being 'Stout, brave, . . Your obvious ami
futile padding of the masthead only serves to com
pound this situation.
Second, your challenge which one would think
an easy, clear sort of thing to have a write
appears instead to be a muddled, contradictory
boast. Instead of wanting time guessing what yon
really meant, the Chaparral staff assures you thai
they are agreeable to ariv such athletic encounter
you may have had in mind, at a time, date and
place of mutual satisfaction, ami limited to true
and valid members of the November staffs of our
publications.
May I remind you that under similar circum
stances hist year your staff suffered complete hu
miliation in an easy H-to-0 Chaparral victory. If
you are still planning to issue a challenge, this
time serious and clear, may I suggest that you
think twice before allowing vthat little staff morale
you now posses* to disappear in a futile attempt
to appear "bra\e" and "rugged.*' After all. you
