# Green to Speak At Mem Church
## 
### 
England's Canon Bryan Green,
regarded as one of the most ex
traordinary figures in contempo
rary Christendom, will return to
Stanford this Sunday to preach
the 11 a.m. sermon in Memorial
Church and to hold a question
and-answer session at 8:30 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Grocn has been described as
"the best orator in the Anglican
Church . . . and also the wittiest."
Although lie is orthodox in his
Christianity he is highly unortho
dox in its presentation.
One famous story told about
Green concerns his first sermon
to a fashionable London church
just after the 1038 Munich ap
peasement. Sensing a "hysterical
relief" among the congregation,
Green began: "I can do one of
three things this morning: I can
preach the gospel unrelated to
life and 1 hope that I shall never
have to do that; I can talk in
broad platitudes, which I also
hope I shall never do. Or I can
say what I really think."
He then preached on "Peace
with Dishonor." An initial drop
in congregation membership was
reversed by a 400 per cent attend
ance increase within three
months.
The Birmingham rector drew
audiences totaling 20,000 in one
five-day mission to Stanford on
"Basic Christianity."
