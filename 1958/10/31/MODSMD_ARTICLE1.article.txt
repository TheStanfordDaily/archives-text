# Soviets Reject Proposals For One-Year Ban
## 
### 
GENEVA (/l 1 ) The Soviet Union Thursday night rejected Western
proposals to ban nuclear weapons testing for one year. It was an
unpromising prelude to the American-British-Soviet talks opening
here Friday on possibilities of a permanent nuclear cease-fire.
But the United States countered in Washington with an announce-

ment that unless the Russians
carry out another nuclear weap
ons test, the United States will
maintain its own ban for one year
beginning Friday.
Both Britain and the United
States said the talks with the Rus
sian will go on whether the Rus
sians test nuclear weapons or not.
Western sources here said the
British also will go along on the
U.S. test ban policy: no British
blasts for a year if the Russians
desist.
Match Test Totals
In Moscow, the Tass news ag
ency and Moscow radio reiterated
that the Russians will continue
testing until their test total
matches that of the United States
and Britain combined.
In the face of the Soviet note's
insistence that tests be banned for
all time, Lincoln White, the U.S.
State Department spokesman in
Washington, remarked that the
United States and Britain had
moved in their one-year proposal
toward the Soviet proposal in 1957
for a two- or three-year ban.
Control System
The Indians, backed up by a
number of small nations, called
for early agreement on a control
system for a test ban, a step the
West insists on.
The Russians said they would
vote for a proposed no-limit dis
continuance of tests with a con
trol system if Britain and the
United States would join in a
pledge to stop tests for all time
no matter how the talks here re
sult. The condition was rejected
by Britain and the United States.
Prevent Cheating
The Soviet Union has demanded
all along that there be "immedi
ate and universal cessation for all
time of nuclear weapons tests"
without regard to whether the
three atom powers can agree on
a system to prevent cheating.
The Moscow statement said
that if America and Britain agree
to a permanent ban on tests the
U.S.S.R. will cease its own testing
"irrespective even of the fact that
the Soviet Union has carried out
fewer experimental tests."

Match Test Totals
In Moscow, the Tass news ag
ency and Moscow radio reiterated
that the Russians will continue
testing until their test total
matches that of the United States
and Britain combined.
In the face of the Soviet note's
insistence that tests be banned for
all time, Lincoln White, the U.S.
State Department spokesman in
Washington, remarked that the
United States and Britain had
moved in their one-year proposal
toward the Soviet proposal in 1957
for a two- or three-year ban.
Control System
The Indians, backed up by a
number of small nations, called
for early agreement on a control
system for a test ban, a step the
West insists on.
The Russians said they would
vote for a proposed no-limit dis
continuance of tests with a con
trol system if Britain and the
United States would join in a
pledge to stop tests for all time
no matter how the talks here re
sult. The condition was rejected
by Britain and the United States.
Prevent Cheating
The Soviet Union has demanded
all along that there be "immedi
ate and universal cessation for all
time of nuclear weapons tests"
without regard to whether the
three atom powers can agree on
a system to prevent cheating.
The Moscow statement said
that if America and Britain agree
to a permanent ban on tests the
U.S.S.R. will cease its own testing
"irrespective even of the fact that
the Soviet Union has carried out
fewer experimental tests."
GENEVA (/l 1 ) The Soviet Union Thursday night rejected Western
proposals to ban nuclear weapons testing for one year. It was an
unpromising prelude to the American-British-Soviet talks opening
here Friday on possibilities of a permanent nuclear cease-fire.
But the United States countered in Washington with an announce-

ment that unless the Russians
carry out another nuclear weap
ons test, the United States will
maintain its own ban for one year
beginning Friday.
Both Britain and the United
States said the talks with the Rus
sian will go on whether the Rus
sians test nuclear weapons or not.
Western sources here said the
British also will go along on the
U.S. test ban policy: no British
blasts for a year if the Russians
desist.
