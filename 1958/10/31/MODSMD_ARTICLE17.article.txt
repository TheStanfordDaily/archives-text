# Stanford-SC Series Tied; Game Tops Homecoming
## Garber Gets Starting Nod 
### John Schwarz 
Stanford's unpredictable Indi
ans, with a Stadium full of Home
coming fans to cheer them on,
will play what could turn out to
be the key game of the season to
morrow when they take on South
ern California's rough Trojans.
Each team has won 18 games
in the series, which goes back to
1905. There have been only two
ties.
The Indian football fortunes,
which afler the first three games
of the season appeared ve'ry bleak,
have suddenly done an about-face
the last three weeks, with the
Cards defeating two of their PCC
rivals and finding themselves
right in the midst of the confer
ence title struggle.
Do or Die
At this stage in the season
every game is do or die so far as
the '58 Indians are concerned, for
one more loss would put them out
of the race.
Tomorrow's game also sets
some psychological factors before
the Indians. A strong win against.
SC could be the psychological shot
in the arm the Big Red needs to
finish the season strongly. How
ever, a loss might cause just the
opposite effect.
Regardless of their hopes and
ambitions, the Stanfordites won't
get any help toward filling them
from the Trojans. There seems to
be little doubt in anyone's mind
that the Trojans, if not the best
team on the Coast, are the most
rough.
They feature a big, strong line
led by the hard-hitting end Marlin
McKeever, who has been a men
ace to quarterbacks all year. To
supplement McKeever in the line
are 255-pound tackle Monte Clark,
230-pound tackle Dan Ficca and
Marlin's twin brother, 210-pound
Mike McKeever.
Quick Hack field
Along with their strong line,
the Trojans also feature a quick
backfield. The main cogs in this
speedy foursome are quarterback
Willie Wood and halfback Angie
Coia.
Without Wood the Trojans
seem to lose a lot of their spirit,
but with him in the lineup they
come to life. Wood has missed
four games this year due to in
juries—all four were lost by SC.
Wood has played in two games—
both SC wins.
Wood will be in there tomorrow,
and if Stanford is going to beat
the Trojans it will have to do it
with Wood and all.
Coia, who comes to SC all the?
way from Philadelphia via The
Citadel, is merely a 9.5 hundred
man who has tied the great Bobby
Morrow on occasions. The only
thing that seems to be holding the
Trojan speedster back is a groin
muscle which doesn't seem to
want to heal up. The injury has
curtailed heavy practice for Coia,
but he will be ready to go to
morrow.
35-7 Last Year
Not only will the Trojans be out
to wreck all of Stanford's title
dreams, but they will also be try
ing to avenge last year's 35-7
pasting that the Cards laid on the
SC-ers down in the Trojans' own
backyard, the Coliseum.
Many of the SC squad didn't
play in that game because they
