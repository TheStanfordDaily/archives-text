# Stanford-SC Series Tied; Game Tops Homecoming
## Garber Gets Starting Nod 
### John Schwarz 
Stanford's unpredictable Indi
ans, with a Stadium full of Home
coming fans to cheer them on,
will play what could turn out to
be the key game of the season to
morrow when they take on South
ern California's rough Trojans.
Each team has won 18 games
in the series, which goes back to
1905. There have been only two
ties.
The Indian football fortunes,
which afler the first three games
of the season appeared ve'ry bleak,
have suddenly done an about-face
the last three weeks, with the
Cards defeating two of their PCC
rivals and finding themselves
right in the midst of the confer
ence title struggle.
Do or Die
At this stage in the season
every game is do or die so far as
the '58 Indians are concerned, for
one more loss would put them out
of the race.
Tomorrow's game also sets
some psychological factors before
the Indians. A strong win against.
SC could be the psychological shot
in the arm the Big Red needs to
finish the season strongly. How
ever, a loss might cause just the
opposite effect.
Regardless of their hopes and
ambitions, the Stanfordites won't
get any help toward filling them
from the Trojans. There seems to
be little doubt in anyone's mind
that the Trojans, if not the best
team on the Coast, are the most
rough.
They feature a big, strong line
led by the hard-hitting end Marlin
McKeever, who has been a men
ace to quarterbacks all year. To
supplement McKeever in the line
are 255-pound tackle Monte Clark,
230-pound tackle Dan Ficca and
Marlin's twin brother, 210-pound
Mike McKeever.
Quick Hack field
Along with their strong line,
the Trojans also feature a quick
backfield. The main cogs in this
speedy foursome are quarterback
Willie Wood and halfback Angie
Coia.
Without Wood the Trojans
seem to lose a lot of their spirit,
but with him in the lineup they
come to life. Wood has missed
four games this year due to in
juries—all four were lost by SC.
Wood has played in two games—
both SC wins.
Wood will be in there tomorrow,
and if Stanford is going to beat
the Trojans it will have to do it
with Wood and all.
Coia, who comes to SC all the?
way from Philadelphia via The
Citadel, is merely a 9.5 hundred
man who has tied the great Bobby
Morrow on occasions. The only
thing that seems to be holding the
Trojan speedster back is a groin
muscle which doesn't seem to
want to heal up. The injury has
curtailed heavy practice for Coia,
but he will be ready to go to
morrow.
35-7 Last Year
Not only will the Trojans be out
to wreck all of Stanford's title
dreams, but they will also be try
ing to avenge last year's 35-7
pasting that the Cards laid on the
SC-ers down in the Trojans' own
backyard, the Coliseum.
Many of the SC squad didn't
play in that game because they
were only freshmen, but they cer
taintly watched it and most prob
ably felt its effects.
Despite all of USC's pre-game
laurels Stanford appears to lie at
its best for the encounter. The
Cards finally showed last week
that they are capable of some fine
offensive play, and as a result
coach Jack Curtice has been work
ing his team very hard this past
week on some new offensive ma
neuvers.
The Homecoming crowd will
probably have an opportunity to
see a real Curtice offense tomor
row. For the first three or four
weeks of the season, Curtice was
forced to stick to the very basic in
offensive plays, because his team
didn't seem to have the confidence
and ability to handle any of the

more intricate plays.
However, now the team seems
io have gained the savvy to work
some of these complex plays and
carry them off successfully, One
might watch for some of Cur t ice's
patented razzle-dazzle plays to
morrow.
Garber to Start
Most of the week the big ques
tion around Stanford was who
would be the starting quarterback
come Saturday, and now the prob
-1 lem seems to have been solved.
As of now, Sid Garber, the jun
ior signal-caller who played such
a litre game in Los Angeles, will
be the starter-. After a rather bad
start this year, Garber finally
found himself last week and show
ed that he had the potential to
grow into one of Stanford's great
est running quarterbacks.
Just because Garber is starting

doesn't guarantee that he'll be in
there all the game. If the offense
slows down at all, senior Bob Ni
colet or sophomore Dick Norman
are both ready and eager to gain
a chance to play.
Good news for Stanford hopes
is the return of hard-running full
back Gil Dowd, who will not start
tomorrow but who will be able to
play some. Dowd will strengthen
(he backfield, where Doug Dick,
Jim Byrer, Skip Face, Mac Wylie
and John Bond have been doing so
fine a job the last few weeks.
California Championship
Rick McMillen will definitely be
out of the game this week, with
Face, Byrer or Dick Bowers mov
ing into his halfback spot. Phil
Burkland, the towering tackle who
hit .so hard in last year's SC game,
is back th i« week, and Larry
Lacey, injured at Northwestern, is
ready to go at guard.
All pre-game indications point
to another 1 fine and exciting Stan
fbrd-USC tilt. Besides Stanford's
desire to hold on in its PCC strug
gle, it also will be out to add an
other leg on its defense of the
California championship.
Last year the Indians beat all
three of their California oppo
nents—USC, UCLA and Cal. So
far this year UCLA has already
been victimized by the Indians,
leaving USC tomorrow and the
Golden Bears afterwards.

TROJAN HALFBACK ANGELO COIA
Could be the finger in the Injuns' pie
Stanford's unpredictable Indi
ans, with a Stadium full of Home
coming fans to cheer them on,
will play what could turn out to
be the key game of the season to
morrow when they take on South
ern California's rough Trojans.
Each team has won 18 games
in the series, which goes back to
1905. There have been only two
ties.
The Indian football fortunes,
which afler the first three games
of the season appeared ve'ry bleak,
have suddenly done an about-face
the last three weeks, with the
Cards defeating two of their PCC
rivals and finding themselves
right in the midst of the confer
ence title struggle.
Do or Die
At this stage in the season
every game is do or die so far as
the '58 Indians are concerned, for
one more loss would put them out
of the race.
Tomorrow's game also sets
some psychological factors before
the Indians. A strong win against.
SC could be the psychological shot
in the arm the Big Red needs to
finish the season strongly. How
ever, a loss might cause just the
opposite effect.
Regardless of their hopes and
ambitions, the Stanfordites won't
get any help toward filling them
from the Trojans. There seems to
be little doubt in anyone's mind
that the Trojans, if not the best
team on the Coast, are the most
rough.
They feature a big, strong line
led by the hard-hitting end Marlin
McKeever, who has been a men
ace to quarterbacks all year. To
supplement McKeever in the line
are 255-pound tackle Monte Clark,
230-pound tackle Dan Ficca and
Marlin's twin brother, 210-pound
Mike McKeever.
Quick Hack field
Along with their strong line,
the Trojans also feature a quick
backfield. The main cogs in this
speedy foursome are quarterback
Willie Wood and halfback Angie
Coia.
Without Wood the Trojans
seem to lose a lot of their spirit,
but with him in the lineup they
come to life. Wood has missed
four games this year due to in
juries—all four were lost by SC.
Wood has played in two games—
both SC wins.
Wood will be in there tomorrow,
and if Stanford is going to beat
the Trojans it will have to do it
with Wood and all.
Coia, who comes to SC all the?
way from Philadelphia via The
Citadel, is merely a 9.5 hundred
man who has tied the great Bobby
Morrow on occasions. The only
thing that seems to be holding the
Trojan speedster back is a groin
muscle which doesn't seem to
want to heal up. The injury has
curtailed heavy practice for Coia,
but he will be ready to go to
morrow.
35-7 Last Year
Not only will the Trojans be out
to wreck all of Stanford's title
dreams, but they will also be try
ing to avenge last year's 35-7
pasting that the Cards laid on the
SC-ers down in the Trojans' own
backyard, the Coliseum.
Many of the SC squad didn't
play in that game because they
were only freshmen, but they cer
taintly watched it and most prob
ably felt its effects.
Despite all of USC's pre-game
laurels Stanford appears to lie at
its best for the encounter. The
Cards finally showed last week
that they are capable of some fine
offensive play, and as a result
coach Jack Curtice has been work
ing his team very hard this past
week on some new offensive ma
neuvers.
The Homecoming crowd will
probably have an opportunity to
see a real Curtice offense tomor
row. For the first three or four
weeks of the season, Curtice was
forced to stick to the very basic in
offensive plays, because his team
didn't seem to have the confidence
and ability to handle any of the

more intricate plays.
However, now the team seems
io have gained the savvy to work
some of these complex plays and
carry them off successfully, One
might watch for some of Cur t ice's
patented razzle-dazzle plays to
morrow.
Garber to Start
Most of the week the big ques
tion around Stanford was who
would be the starting quarterback
come Saturday, and now the prob
-1 lem seems to have been solved.
As of now, Sid Garber, the jun
ior signal-caller who played such
a litre game in Los Angeles, will
be the starter-. After a rather bad
start this year, Garber finally
found himself last week and show
ed that he had the potential to
grow into one of Stanford's great
est running quarterbacks.
Just because Garber is starting

doesn't guarantee that he'll be in
there all the game. If the offense
slows down at all, senior Bob Ni
colet or sophomore Dick Norman
are both ready and eager to gain
a chance to play.
Good news for Stanford hopes
is the return of hard-running full
back Gil Dowd, who will not start
tomorrow but who will be able to
play some. Dowd will strengthen
(he backfield, where Doug Dick,
Jim Byrer, Skip Face, Mac Wylie
and John Bond have been doing so
fine a job the last few weeks.
California Championship
Rick McMillen will definitely be
out of the game this week, with
Face, Byrer or Dick Bowers mov
ing into his halfback spot. Phil
Burkland, the towering tackle who
hit .so hard in last year's SC game,
is back th i« week, and Larry
Lacey, injured at Northwestern, is
ready to go at guard.
All pre-game indications point
to another 1 fine and exciting Stan
fbrd-USC tilt. Besides Stanford's
desire to hold on in its PCC strug
gle, it also will be out to add an
other leg on its defense of the
California championship.
Last year the Indians beat all
three of their California oppo
nents—USC, UCLA and Cal. So
far this year UCLA has already
been victimized by the Indians,
leaving USC tomorrow and the
Golden Bears afterwards.

TROJAN HALFBACK ANGELO COIA
Could be the finger in the Injuns' pie
Stanford's unpredictable Indi
ans, with a Stadium full of Home
coming fans to cheer them on,
will play what could turn out to
be the key game of the season to
morrow when they take on South
ern California's rough Trojans.
Each team has won 18 games
in the series, which goes back to
1905. There have been only two
ties.
The Indian football fortunes,
which afler the first three games
of the season appeared ve'ry bleak,
have suddenly done an about-face
the last three weeks, with the
Cards defeating two of their PCC
rivals and finding themselves
right in the midst of the confer
ence title struggle.
Do or Die
At this stage in the season
every game is do or die so far as
the '58 Indians are concerned, for
one more loss would put them out
of the race.
Tomorrow's game also sets
some psychological factors before
the Indians. A strong win against.
SC could be the psychological shot
in the arm the Big Red needs to
finish the season strongly. How
ever, a loss might cause just the
opposite effect.
Regardless of their hopes and
ambitions, the Stanfordites won't
get any help toward filling them
from the Trojans. There seems to
be little doubt in anyone's mind
that the Trojans, if not the best
team on the Coast, are the most
rough.
They feature a big, strong line
led by the hard-hitting end Marlin
McKeever, who has been a men
ace to quarterbacks all year. To
supplement McKeever in the line
are 255-pound tackle Monte Clark,
230-pound tackle Dan Ficca and
Marlin's twin brother, 210-pound
Mike McKeever.
Quick Hack field
Along with their strong line,
the Trojans also feature a quick
backfield. The main cogs in this
speedy foursome are quarterback
Willie Wood and halfback Angie
Coia.
Without Wood the Trojans
seem to lose a lot of their spirit,
but with him in the lineup they
come to life. Wood has missed
four games this year due to in
juries—all four were lost by SC.
Wood has played in two games—
both SC wins.
Wood will be in there tomorrow,
and if Stanford is going to beat
the Trojans it will have to do it
with Wood and all.
Coia, who comes to SC all the?
way from Philadelphia via The
Citadel, is merely a 9.5 hundred
man who has tied the great Bobby
Morrow on occasions. The only
thing that seems to be holding the
Trojan speedster back is a groin
muscle which doesn't seem to
want to heal up. The injury has
curtailed heavy practice for Coia,
but he will be ready to go to
morrow.
35-7 Last Year
Not only will the Trojans be out
to wreck all of Stanford's title
dreams, but they will also be try
ing to avenge last year's 35-7
pasting that the Cards laid on the
SC-ers down in the Trojans' own
backyard, the Coliseum.
Many of the SC squad didn't
play in that game because they
were only freshmen, but they cer
taintly watched it and most prob
ably felt its effects.
Despite all of USC's pre-game
laurels Stanford appears to lie at
its best for the encounter. The
Cards finally showed last week
that they are capable of some fine
offensive play, and as a result
coach Jack Curtice has been work
ing his team very hard this past
week on some new offensive ma
neuvers.
The Homecoming crowd will
probably have an opportunity to
see a real Curtice offense tomor
row. For the first three or four
weeks of the season, Curtice was
forced to stick to the very basic in
offensive plays, because his team
didn't seem to have the confidence
and ability to handle any of the

more intricate plays.
However, now the team seems
io have gained the savvy to work
some of these complex plays and
carry them off successfully, One
might watch for some of Cur t ice's
patented razzle-dazzle plays to
morrow.
Garber to Start
Most of the week the big ques
tion around Stanford was who
would be the starting quarterback
come Saturday, and now the prob
-1 lem seems to have been solved.
As of now, Sid Garber, the jun
ior signal-caller who played such
a litre game in Los Angeles, will
be the starter-. After a rather bad
start this year, Garber finally
found himself last week and show
ed that he had the potential to
grow into one of Stanford's great
est running quarterbacks.
Just because Garber is starting

doesn't guarantee that he'll be in
there all the game. If the offense
slows down at all, senior Bob Ni
colet or sophomore Dick Norman
are both ready and eager to gain
a chance to play.
Good news for Stanford hopes
is the return of hard-running full
back Gil Dowd, who will not start
tomorrow but who will be able to
play some. Dowd will strengthen
(he backfield, where Doug Dick,
Jim Byrer, Skip Face, Mac Wylie
and John Bond have been doing so
fine a job the last few weeks.
California Championship
Rick McMillen will definitely be
out of the game this week, with
Face, Byrer or Dick Bowers mov
ing into his halfback spot. Phil
Burkland, the towering tackle who
hit .so hard in last year's SC game,
is back th i« week, and Larry
Lacey, injured at Northwestern, is
ready to go at guard.
All pre-game indications point
to another 1 fine and exciting Stan
fbrd-USC tilt. Besides Stanford's
desire to hold on in its PCC strug
gle, it also will be out to add an
other leg on its defense of the
California championship.
Last year the Indians beat all
three of their California oppo
nents—USC, UCLA and Cal. So
far this year UCLA has already
been victimized by the Indians,
leaving USC tomorrow and the
Golden Bears afterwards.

TROJAN HALFBACK ANGELO COIA
Could be the finger in the Injuns' pie
Stanford's unpredictable Indi
ans, with a Stadium full of Home
coming fans to cheer them on,
will play what could turn out to
be the key game of the season to
morrow when they take on South
ern California's rough Trojans.
Each team has won 18 games
in the series, which goes back to
1905. There have been only two
ties.
The Indian football fortunes,
which afler the first three games
of the season appeared ve'ry bleak,
have suddenly done an about-face
the last three weeks, with the
Cards defeating two of their PCC
rivals and finding themselves
right in the midst of the confer
ence title struggle.
Do or Die
At this stage in the season
every game is do or die so far as
the '58 Indians are concerned, for
one more loss would put them out
of the race.
Tomorrow's game also sets
some psychological factors before
the Indians. A strong win against.
SC could be the psychological shot
in the arm the Big Red needs to
finish the season strongly. How
ever, a loss might cause just the
opposite effect.
Regardless of their hopes and
ambitions, the Stanfordites won't
get any help toward filling them
from the Trojans. There seems to
be little doubt in anyone's mind
that the Trojans, if not the best
team on the Coast, are the most
rough.
They feature a big, strong line
led by the hard-hitting end Marlin
McKeever, who has been a men
ace to quarterbacks all year. To
supplement McKeever in the line
are 255-pound tackle Monte Clark,
230-pound tackle Dan Ficca and
Marlin's twin brother, 210-pound
Mike McKeever.
Quick Hack field
Along with their strong line,
the Trojans also feature a quick
backfield. The main cogs in this
speedy foursome are quarterback
Willie Wood and halfback Angie
Coia.
Without Wood the Trojans
seem to lose a lot of their spirit,
but with him in the lineup they
come to life. Wood has missed
four games this year due to in
juries—all four were lost by SC.
Wood has played in two games—
both SC wins.
Wood will be in there tomorrow,
and if Stanford is going to beat
the Trojans it will have to do it
with Wood and all.
Coia, who comes to SC all the?
way from Philadelphia via The
Citadel, is merely a 9.5 hundred
man who has tied the great Bobby
Morrow on occasions. The only
thing that seems to be holding the
Trojan speedster back is a groin
muscle which doesn't seem to
want to heal up. The injury has
curtailed heavy practice for Coia,
but he will be ready to go to
morrow.
35-7 Last Year
Not only will the Trojans be out
to wreck all of Stanford's title
dreams, but they will also be try
ing to avenge last year's 35-7
pasting that the Cards laid on the
SC-ers down in the Trojans' own
backyard, the Coliseum.
Many of the SC squad didn't
play in that game because they
were only freshmen, but they cer
taintly watched it and most prob
ably felt its effects.
Despite all of USC's pre-game
laurels Stanford appears to lie at
its best for the encounter. The
Cards finally showed last week
that they are capable of some fine
offensive play, and as a result
coach Jack Curtice has been work
ing his team very hard this past
week on some new offensive ma
neuvers.
The Homecoming crowd will
probably have an opportunity to
see a real Curtice offense tomor
row. For the first three or four
weeks of the season, Curtice was
forced to stick to the very basic in
offensive plays, because his team
didn't seem to have the confidence
and ability to handle any of the

more intricate plays.
However, now the team seems
io have gained the savvy to work
some of these complex plays and
carry them off successfully, One
might watch for some of Cur t ice's
patented razzle-dazzle plays to
morrow.
Garber to Start
Most of the week the big ques
tion around Stanford was who
would be the starting quarterback
come Saturday, and now the prob
-1 lem seems to have been solved.
As of now, Sid Garber, the jun
ior signal-caller who played such
a litre game in Los Angeles, will
be the starter-. After a rather bad
start this year, Garber finally
found himself last week and show
ed that he had the potential to
grow into one of Stanford's great
est running quarterbacks.
Just because Garber is starting

doesn't guarantee that he'll be in
there all the game. If the offense
slows down at all, senior Bob Ni
colet or sophomore Dick Norman
are both ready and eager to gain
a chance to play.
Good news for Stanford hopes
is the return of hard-running full
back Gil Dowd, who will not start
tomorrow but who will be able to
play some. Dowd will strengthen
(he backfield, where Doug Dick,
Jim Byrer, Skip Face, Mac Wylie
and John Bond have been doing so
fine a job the last few weeks.
California Championship
Rick McMillen will definitely be
out of the game this week, with
Face, Byrer or Dick Bowers mov
ing into his halfback spot. Phil
Burkland, the towering tackle who
hit .so hard in last year's SC game,
is back th i« week, and Larry
Lacey, injured at Northwestern, is
ready to go at guard.
All pre-game indications point
to another 1 fine and exciting Stan
fbrd-USC tilt. Besides Stanford's
desire to hold on in its PCC strug
gle, it also will be out to add an
other leg on its defense of the
California championship.
Last year the Indians beat all
three of their California oppo
nents—USC, UCLA and Cal. So
far this year UCLA has already
been victimized by the Indians,
leaving USC tomorrow and the
Golden Bears afterwards.

All pre-game indications point
to another 1 fine and exciting Stan
fbrd-USC tilt. Besides Stanford's
desire to hold on in its PCC strug
gle, it also will be out to add an
other leg on its defense of the
California championship.
Last year the Indians beat all
three of their California oppo
nents—USC, UCLA and Cal. So
far this year UCLA has already
been victimized by the Indians,
leaving USC tomorrow and the
Golden Bears afterwards.

TROJAN HALFBACK ANGELO COIA
Could be the finger in the Injuns' pie
Stanford's unpredictable Indi
ans, with a Stadium full of Home
coming fans to cheer them on,
will play what could turn out to
be the key game of the season to
morrow when they take on South
ern California's rough Trojans.
Each team has won 18 games
in the series, which goes back to
1905. There have been only two
ties.
The Indian football fortunes,
which afler the first three games
of the season appeared ve'ry bleak,
have suddenly done an about-face
the last three weeks, with the
Cards defeating two of their PCC
rivals and finding themselves
right in the midst of the confer
ence title struggle.
Do or Die
At this stage in the season
every game is do or die so far as
the '58 Indians are concerned, for
one more loss would put them out
of the race.
Tomorrow's game also sets
some psychological factors before
the Indians. A strong win against.
SC could be the psychological shot
in the arm the Big Red needs to
finish the season strongly. How
ever, a loss might cause just the
opposite effect.
Regardless of their hopes and
ambitions, the Stanfordites won't
get any help toward filling them
from the Trojans. There seems to
be little doubt in anyone's mind
that the Trojans, if not the best
team on the Coast, are the most
rough.
They feature a big, strong line
led by the hard-hitting end Marlin
McKeever, who has been a men
ace to quarterbacks all year. To
supplement McKeever in the line
are 255-pound tackle Monte Clark,
230-pound tackle Dan Ficca and
Marlin's twin brother, 210-pound
Mike McKeever.
Quick Hack field
Along with their strong line,
the Trojans also feature a quick
backfield. The main cogs in this
speedy foursome are quarterback
Willie Wood and halfback Angie
Coia.
Without Wood the Trojans
seem to lose a lot of their spirit,
but with him in the lineup they
come to life. Wood has missed
four games this year due to in
juries—all four were lost by SC.
Wood has played in two games—
both SC wins.
Wood will be in there tomorrow,
and if Stanford is going to beat
the Trojans it will have to do it
with Wood and all.
Coia, who comes to SC all the?
way from Philadelphia via The
Citadel, is merely a 9.5 hundred
man who has tied the great Bobby
Morrow on occasions. The only
thing that seems to be holding the
Trojan speedster back is a groin
muscle which doesn't seem to
want to heal up. The injury has
curtailed heavy practice for Coia,
but he will be ready to go to
morrow.
35-7 Last Year
Not only will the Trojans be out
to wreck all of Stanford's title
dreams, but they will also be try
ing to avenge last year's 35-7
pasting that the Cards laid on the
SC-ers down in the Trojans' own
backyard, the Coliseum.
Many of the SC squad didn't
play in that game because they
were only freshmen, but they cer
taintly watched it and most prob
ably felt its effects.
Despite all of USC's pre-game
laurels Stanford appears to lie at
its best for the encounter. The
Cards finally showed last week
that they are capable of some fine
offensive play, and as a result
coach Jack Curtice has been work
ing his team very hard this past
week on some new offensive ma
neuvers.
The Homecoming crowd will
probably have an opportunity to
see a real Curtice offense tomor
row. For the first three or four
weeks of the season, Curtice was
forced to stick to the very basic in
offensive plays, because his team
didn't seem to have the confidence
and ability to handle any of the

more intricate plays.
However, now the team seems
io have gained the savvy to work
some of these complex plays and
carry them off successfully, One
might watch for some of Cur t ice's
patented razzle-dazzle plays to
morrow.
Garber to Start
Most of the week the big ques
tion around Stanford was who
would be the starting quarterback
come Saturday, and now the prob
-1 lem seems to have been solved.
As of now, Sid Garber, the jun
ior signal-caller who played such
a litre game in Los Angeles, will
be the starter-. After a rather bad
start this year, Garber finally
found himself last week and show
ed that he had the potential to
grow into one of Stanford's great
est running quarterbacks.
Just because Garber is starting

doesn't guarantee that he'll be in
there all the game. If the offense
slows down at all, senior Bob Ni
colet or sophomore Dick Norman
are both ready and eager to gain
a chance to play.
Good news for Stanford hopes
is the return of hard-running full
back Gil Dowd, who will not start
tomorrow but who will be able to
play some. Dowd will strengthen
(he backfield, where Doug Dick,
Jim Byrer, Skip Face, Mac Wylie
and John Bond have been doing so
fine a job the last few weeks.
California Championship
Rick McMillen will definitely be
out of the game this week, with
Face, Byrer or Dick Bowers mov
ing into his halfback spot. Phil
Burkland, the towering tackle who
hit .so hard in last year's SC game,
is back th i« week, and Larry
Lacey, injured at Northwestern, is
ready to go at guard.
All pre-game indications point
to another 1 fine and exciting Stan
fbrd-USC tilt. Besides Stanford's
desire to hold on in its PCC strug
gle, it also will be out to add an
other leg on its defense of the
California championship.
Last year the Indians beat all
three of their California oppo
nents—USC, UCLA and Cal. So
far this year UCLA has already
been victimized by the Indians,
leaving USC tomorrow and the
Golden Bears afterwards.
