I'ltoi'osri ion 16. which will appear on (California voters ballots
Tuesday, provides for repeal of the current law exempting the
private schools of California from state taxes.
The proponents of this measure say the exemption undermines
a "■foundation stone of the Itepuhlic: separation of church and
stale."
The proposition apples onl\ to schools below the college level.
II the issue is reall\ separation of church and state, then why do
(lie proponents of Proposition 16 not further and move to tax
private colleges and universities or church-supported hospitals?
There is more to llie issue than the separation of
(liiireli and state. It involves the riftht of religions groups
to maintain their systems of belief.
One argucr has maintained that "America has grown great
while keeping religious dogma out of the . . . public schools."
Hut lie forgets that while America lias been growing great the
private and parochial school systems have been developing along
side the public seltools.
lu a practical vein, the passage of Proposition 16 would impose
a "double tax" against parents who have a constitutional right
to send llteir cliildren to private schools. These parents are paying
taxes to support the public schools and in addition paying to send
their children to the private schools.
There are some 340,000 children in private schools,
and the "double tax' conld sit increase the <<>st of at
tending private schools that children would transfer to
the public schools, thus burdening the, system which al
ready has more than 160.000 children on double sessions.
If the private schools were taxed, the revenue would amount
to not more than $IJ 75,000 annually, according to the State Board
of Initialization. However, it costs $346 a year to educate a child
in the public schools. With the 340,000 children in private schools,
the taxpayers save SI 18,000,000 a year, plus the funds needed for
more school plants for the increased enrollments.
A shift of only 10 per cent of the private school pupils
to public schools would cost the public nearly $12,000.-
000. This could happen as the tax burden could close
some financially pressed private schools and others would
take in fewer children.
Thus Proposition 16 is not practical front a financial stand-
Because the education of youth is a partnership between the
private and public schools, and because it would be unfair to
impose a double burden oil the private schools, we urge a i\o vote
on Proposition 16.
