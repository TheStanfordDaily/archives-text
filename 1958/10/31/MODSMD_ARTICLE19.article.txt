## Where's Our Zoo? 
### Marilyn Moore 
Though we have a Library, a
Union, a Bookstore and all of the
apparently essential buildings and
facilities for college life, Stanford
seems to be decidedly lacking in
one of the most common of col
lege facilities- or at least so it
seems after reading many of the
exchange papers.
Namely, we have no zoo, me
nagerie, or other form of animal
assemblage.
While it may be argued that
there are plenty of rabbits, squir
rels and quail on the campus, and
that there are enough birds in
Union Court for an aviary, and
even thai we have the most edu
cated canines on the West Coast,
.judging from the number who
frequent the Library and the
classrooms, the tragic fact re
mains窶馬o zoo.
One university which lias the
advantage over 11s in this area
of academic pursuit (though
granted that what one learns in
zoos depends on what one is
looking for) is the University
of .Michigan.
"Two otters were transported to
the University Exhibit Museum
Zoo last week," states the campus
Daily. "The zoo's menagerie now
includes one fox, two bears, five
raccoons and two d e-s c en t e d
skunks."
They report that "the otters eat
horsemeat, cod liver oil, diced car
rots, oatmeal and brewers' yeast."
Plus fish, we assume. Sounds as
if they could survive nicely on
dorm food.
Some schools acquire their
animals as presents.
"The little Husky pup known as
Denali, a gift from the students
of the University of Alaska, will

arrive in big style this morning at
the Seattle airport," the Univer
sity of Washington Daily reports.
Though this wasn't done on
quite as institutional a level ("per
sons desiring to provide the pup a
home may sign up at the ASUW
office"), this could really be car
ried to extremes. Cats from Siam.
parrots from South America,
snakes from the Belgian Congo,
etc. This friendship stuff is fine,
but let's not carry it too far!
Before Stanford alumni get
the wrong idea about the use
of their donated dollars, we'd
better turn to some less quadru
pedal subjects.
Speaking of dollars, here are a
few monetary fees and traditions
around the country: The U. of
North Carolina has FREE flicks;
"Cyrano do Bergerac" was a re
cent showing. ... A yearly sub
scription to the Harvard Crimson
I costs $10 delivered in dorms, $11
in Cambridge and $12 mailed. . . .
Tickets for the Penn State .junior
prom held last week were $5 a
couple and were on sale ONE
DAY only Ralph Marterie and
Orchestra was the main attrac
tion.
Just to finish up the week in
true $tyle i-s the following from a
San Jose State Spartan Daily col
! umnist:
"Once a reputable and admira
ble custom, tipping has become an
I obnoxious tradition. . . . The serv
ices that waitresses, bus boys and
| doormen perform should be the
responsibility of management and
management alone. Let the man
who is raking in the profits sub
sidize the people who are doing
HIS WORK." Amen!

Though we have a Library, a
Union, a Bookstore and all of the
apparently essential buildings and
facilities for college life, Stanford
seems to be decidedly lacking in
one of the most common of col
lege facilities- or at least so it
seems after reading many of the
exchange papers.
Namely, we have no zoo, me
nagerie, or other form of animal
assemblage.
While it may be argued that
there are plenty of rabbits, squir
rels and quail on the campus, and
that there are enough birds in
Union Court for an aviary, and
even thai we have the most edu

"Two otters were transported to
the University Exhibit Museum
Zoo last week," states the campus
Daily. "The zoo's menagerie now
includes one fox, two bears, five

They report that "the otters eat
horsemeat, cod liver oil, diced car
rots, oatmeal and brewers' yeast."

Some schools acquire their
animals as presents.
"The little Husky pup known as

but let's not carry it too far!
Before Stanford alumni get
the wrong idea about the use
of their donated dollars, we'd
