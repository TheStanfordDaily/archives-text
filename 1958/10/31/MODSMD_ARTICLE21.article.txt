# Gubser: Mistakes Plague GOP
## 
### Leo Krulitz 
"lf we lose the election Tues
d a y," Republican Congressman
Charles Guber said over Cellar
coffee and cheeseburgers, "it will
be from political mistakes. They
don't have any issues.
"We don't have 'PRS' in the Re
publican party," he told the stu
dents lunching with him. He de
fined PRS as "public relations
sense."
"The Democratic party has
built up the belief that they're the
'party of the common man' and
we're the 'party of privilege'—and
we haven't done anything to dis
pel it,"he said.
Asked if he thought the split in
the Republican party would af
fect his own campaign, he replied:
"It's going to affect every Repub
licah. When you find a party dis
couraged, they just don't do as
good a job campaigning."
Predicting his own victory, he
said: "I expect my percentage
will go down. I'm confident, but
working as hard as I can right
up to the last. I'm not an out
and-out rank partisan; I think
my record will gel me through."
Talking about U.S. Sen. William
Knowland, Gubser suggested that

people didn't give him the credit
he deserved for being an Eisen
hower supporter.
"I can't find any real cleavage
between Eisenhower's and Know
land's foreign policy," he said.
Gubser said the Formosa res

olution, along with the rejection
of an amendment by the Senate
that would have excluded the
offshore islands of Quemoy and
\latsu from U.S. protection, is
clear-cut policy. We have indi
cated we would defend these
islands.
One important bill he helped
through the House concerned
passports that were being issued
to known Communists. Gubser
said, "This bill would correct an
error of omission pointed out by
the Supreme Court last June 16
in which they said that, because
Congress hadn't legislated in the
field, the Passport Division could
not deny a passport to a subver
sive or a Communist." Congress
passed legislation denying them
passports.
Gubser was also responsible
for getting passage of the Pa
checo Tunnel legislation, an im
portant step in solving Califor
nia's water problem.
Returning to California politics,
Gubser told his listeners that Sen
ator Knowland fully expected a
primary contest with Gov Good
win Knight for the Republican
nomination for governor. He said,

"If a deal was made, Knight
made it."
Gubser suggested that Russell
Bryan, his Democratic opponent
for the 10th congressional district
seat, was difficult to debate, "be
cause he doesn't come down to
specifics." He added, as an after
thought, "He agrees with about 9(i
per cent of my voting record."
Asked about a bill on wiretap
ping that his opponent has criti
cized, Gubser said he didn't think
Bryan really understood the bill.
Gubser explained that the bill
would allow wiretapping evidence
to be used in cases of treason,
espionage and sedition but could
only be introduced if a judge,
after hearing it. ruled that it was
pertinent to the case.
Gubser explained he voted
against the Kennedy !ves labor
bill because be felt it didn't ac
complish enough, and said he
thought a stronger bill could he
passed at the next session.
To Whom It .May Concern:
A word or two from Adlai Ste
venson: "To stand fast when you
are right is wisdom to stand fast
when you are wrong is catastro
phe." And: "States' rights cannot
compromise humane rights."

for getting passage of the Pa

Returning to California politics,
Gubser told his listeners that Sen

primary contest with Gov Good
win Knight for the Republican
nomination for governor. He said,

"If a deal was made, Knight
made it."
Gubser suggested that Russell
Bryan, his Democratic opponent
for the 10th congressional district
seat, was difficult to debate, "be
cause he doesn't come down to
specifics." He added, as an after
thought, "He agrees with about 9(i
per cent of my voting record."
Asked about a bill on wiretap

cized, Gubser said he didn't think
Bryan really understood the bill.
Gubser explained that the bill
would allow wiretapping evidence
to be used in cases of treason,
espionage and sedition but could
only be introduced if a judge,
after hearing it. ruled that it was
pertinent to the case.
Gubser explained he voted
