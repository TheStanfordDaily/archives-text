# Three Scientists Receive Nobel Prize; One to Head New SU Genetics Dept.

### Judy Sklar 
The 1958 Nobel prize in medi
cine and physiology was awarded
Thursday to three American sci
entists all associated with Stan
ford for their work on problems
of heredity. The work could have
strong bearing on the future of
cancer research.
One-half of the $41,420 prize
goes to Dr. Joshua Lederberg, 33,
of the University of Wisconsin
and the other half to Drs. E. L.
Tatum, 49, New York's Rockefel
ler Institute, and George Wells
Beadle, 55, California Institute of
Technology.
Provost Frederick Terman has
stnted that the achievement of
these three men is "symbolic of
the emphasis on the application of
basic science to medicine that will
prevail when the Medical School
is built on the campus.
"This also emphasized the im
portance of the associated sci
ences |such as biology| to medi
cine. VVe are, of course, very
proud and delighted."
In awarding half of the medical
prize to Lederberg, the Nobel com
mittee said it was "for his rlis- j
coveries concerning genetic re
combination and the organization!

of the genetic material of bac
teria."
The term "genetic recombina

tion" means sexual life in the
world of bacteria. Lederberg dis
covered that from the geneticists'
viewpoint "this corresponds ex
actly to the normal sexual fertili
zation in the higher organisms."
The committee said the other
i half of the prize goes to Beadle
I and Tat urn "for their discovery
j that genes act by regulating spe
, cifie chemical processes."
Beadle, Tatum
Prof. Torbjorn Casperson of the
awarding group, an expert on ge
netics, said this discovery had "of
fered the first chance to under
stand the mode of action of the
genes" and is one of the founda
tions of modern genetics.
The research of Beadle and Ta
| turn was done in Stanford labora
tories in 1940-41 and was based
largely on a red bread mold called
neurospora crassa. Any strain of
this mold can be multiplied a mil
lion times in two days without
genetic change. By disturbing the
function of its genes, researchers
have been able in a short time to
figure out some fundamental
chemical mechanism of heredity.
Beadle and Tatum bombarded
the bread mold with radiation un
til they produced organisms that

could not make certain necessary
amino acids. They then knew they
had changed or destroyed a spe
cific gene in the cell. One by one,
they created new types of mold
cells lacking the power to make
one or another of the amino acids.
This led them to the idea that
genes might be manipulated in
man to prevent him from growing
harmful cells, such as cancer, or
perhaps m a k e him immune to
many diseases. This is a new field
of biology- biochemical genetics.
Professor of biology at Stanford
from 1937 to 194G. Beadle is now
chairman of ihe biology division
at Caltech. He is currently a vis
it in g professor at Oxford.
Lederberg
Lederberg, now chairman of the
department of medical genetics at
the University of Wisconsin medi
cal •school, is to become professor
and head of a new department of
genetics at Stanford's School of
Medicine in January .
Tatum was a professor of biol
ogy at Stanford from 1937 to li)47j
and from 19-1S to 1956. He is now
a member of the Rockefeller In
stitute in New York.

Receives Nobel Prize
The 1958 Nobel prize in medi
cine and physiology was awarded
Thursday to three American sci
entists all associated with Stan
ford for their work on problems
of heredity. The work could have
strong bearing on the future of
cancer research.
One-half of the $41,420 prize
goes to Dr. Joshua Lederberg, 33,
of the University of Wisconsin
and the other half to Drs. E. L.
Tatum, 49, New York's Rockefel
ler Institute, and George Wells
Beadle, 55, California Institute of
Technology.
Provost Frederick Terman has
stnted that the achievement of
these three men is "symbolic of
the emphasis on the application of
basic science to medicine that will
prevail when the Medical School
is built on the campus.
"This also emphasized the im
portance of the associated sci
ences |such as biology| to medi
cine. VVe are, of course, very
proud and delighted."
In awarding half of the medical
prize to Lederberg, the Nobel com
mittee said it was "for his rlis- j
coveries concerning genetic re
combination and the organization!

of the genetic material of bac
teria."
The term "genetic recombina

tion" means sexual life in the
world of bacteria. Lederberg dis
covered that from the geneticists'
viewpoint "this corresponds ex
actly to the normal sexual fertili
zation in the higher organisms."
The committee said the other
i half of the prize goes to Beadle
I and Tat urn "for their discovery
j that genes act by regulating spe
, cifie chemical processes."
Beadle, Tatum
Prof. Torbjorn Casperson of the
awarding group, an expert on ge
netics, said this discovery had "of
fered the first chance to under
stand the mode of action of the
genes" and is one of the founda
tions of modern genetics.
The research of Beadle and Ta
| turn was done in Stanford labora
tories in 1940-41 and was based
largely on a red bread mold called
neurospora crassa. Any strain of
this mold can be multiplied a mil
lion times in two days without
genetic change. By disturbing the
function of its genes, researchers
have been able in a short time to
figure out some fundamental
chemical mechanism of heredity.
Beadle and Tatum bombarded
the bread mold with radiation un
til they produced organisms that

could not make certain necessary
amino acids. They then knew they
had changed or destroyed a spe
cific gene in the cell. One by one,
they created new types of mold
cells lacking the power to make
one or another of the amino acids.
