### 
Over $30,000 in new research
support may enable Stanford
Medical School investigators to
unravel the how and why of al
lergic* reactions.
Project director Professor
George A. Feigen of the physiol
ogy department will be joined by
Dr. E. M. Vaughan Williams of
Oxford University, and other
members of the medical school.
With this support and the several
other grants made earlier this
year, the group will make careful
studies of allergic reactions in
animal hearts.
"We hope our results may con
tribute to a better understanding
of the cardiac irregularities often
associated with asthma," said
