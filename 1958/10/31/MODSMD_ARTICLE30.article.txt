# Card, Troy Frosh Meet in 1958 Season Opener
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Saturday will be a banner day
for Stanford football fans. Not i
only will the varsity team be play- \
ing what may turn out to be its
most important game of the sea
son. but SU's frosh will also open
its three-week schedule in the
Stadium against Southern Cal's
freshman team. Game time is
10:45 a.m.
Coach Ilomer Smith's eleven is
ready to give the Trobabes a real
battle. After weeks of dummy
tackling, play memorii/.ng, scrim
maging, head knocking and gen
eral working out, the novelty of
playing an actual game against
another school will probably seem
like fun to the frosh.
The team will be led by quar
terback .Tim Smith of Grants Pass,
Ore. Smith has proven himself a
fine passer and no mean field gen
eral. With a fine assortment of
plays at his command, he just
may give the Trobabes fits.
Lining up against Smith in the
SC quarterback slot will be Tru
man Aubrey. Aubrey -stands 6-0
and weighs in at 170 pounds.
Also in the visitors' backfield
will be halfback John Chisdak of
Scranton, Pa. Chisdak was a high
school All-American and All-State
selection and should be a good
test for the Papoose defense.
Rounding out the SC backfield
are halfback Jim Maples of Bak
ersfield and fullback Jerry Mollet,
a 200-pound 6-footer from Los An
geles.
At fullback for the Indian frosh
will be Bill Kuhn. Kuhn is the
key to the frosh running attack,
as many of the running plays in
the Stanford repertoire are built
around him.
