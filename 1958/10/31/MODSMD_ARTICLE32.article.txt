Stanford's freshmen have two i
quarterbacks who could in a pinch
spell starter Smith. Bob Price and
Stan Lindskog have both shown
to be good passers, so those in the
stands can expect the pigskin to
be in the air a good deal of the
time that Stanford has the ball.
Chief target for these aerials
probably will be left end Marlin !
Walling. In practice he hauled |
down everything that come near |
him.
The frosh line is another talking
point. With two All-State selec
tions in Chris Cottle and Jim Moe
heading up a contingent of big
and speedy linemen, the Indians'
back field should be able to expect
the maximum in the way of pro
tection.
Defensively also, Ihe SU fresh
men have shown themselves to be
more than adequate and hope to
cause the SC offense to hog down
considerably.
