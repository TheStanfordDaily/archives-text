# HARRIERS
## Four-way Meet Set 
### 
Twenty â€¢ eight runners will go
postward Saturday at 10 a.m. in
a quadrangular cross-country der
by on the Stanford golf course.
IJSC, California, San Jose and
the host Indians will race in what
shapes up as a close event from
start to finish of its four miles.
The Trojans are favored, chief
ly because of last week's 23-34 win
over the Indians. San Jose nipped
Cal in another meet last week and
appears to be about even with the
Cards.
Max Truex looks like the indi
vidual favorite, but the home
course advantage might enable
Stanford's Keith Wallace to give
the Trojan a close fight. No one
from Cal or San Jose appears ca
pable of keeping up with this pair.
Teamwise again, Indian coach
Payton Jor d a n says his club
"should beat Cal, but it will take
a supreme effort to top USC. Any
body who drags his feet will kill
us."
In an effort to eliminate any
foot-draggers, Jordan has cut his
squad to seven men.
In addition to newly elected co
captains Wallace and Doug Mar
lin, the Cards will go with Bob
Monzingo, Larry Suel/.le, A 1 Ahu
mada, John Northway and Kim
Maxwell.
Once again, the key to any pos
sible Stanford success will be unit
running. The Cards bunched
against Ihe Air Force and got a
19-38 victory. They were spread
against USC and UCLA and lost
the meet.
But running at home and with
a now-set team, the Indians will
certainly have no better chance
to beat, topnotch competition.
