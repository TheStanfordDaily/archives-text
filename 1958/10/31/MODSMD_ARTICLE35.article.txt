## Zero Hour Arrives for Hopeful Cal 
### 
The zero hour has arrived for
Joe Kapp and his University of
California mates in their hopeful
drive to the Rose Bowl. The
Bears tangle with the we-don't
lose-at-home Oregon State Bea
vers tomorrow in a crucial that
could either even up the Pasadena
race or give Cal a healthy lead
with only three games left.
Other action pits Washington
Stale against UCLA in Los An
geles. Oregon at Washington and
Southern California at Stanford.
In non - conference play, Idaho
meets San Jose State at Boise.
Cal has been breaking all kinds
of personal records during the
past four weeks and a win tomor
row would make this the first
year since 1951 that the Bears
have put four conference victo
ries together.
Those Roses
But more important is that the
Bears lead the Race to the Roses
with a 3-0 record and OSC is 3-1.
Stanford is 2-1 in league action
and meets an SC team that can't
afford to lose another.
WSC is in the same boat with
the Trojans, with two losses and
all but mathematically out of the
race.
Oregon State hasn't lost a home
game since 1954, and hasn't lost
to Cal in that time. But the Bears
have been making a habit of
breaking Ibis kind of record all
season now and the Bear-Beaver
clash looms as the conference's
most important of the season.
Kapp on His Way
With Joe Kapp well on his way
to All - American rating as the
master of the Bear Split-T, Cal
has generated the loop's most po
tent offense this season. The up
and-down Beavers will give the
leaky Bear defense a stern test,
however. OSC comes into the
game with consecutive wins over
Idaho and Washington.
WSC and USC, apparently the
class of the league after smash
ing opening-game victories, have
their backs to the wall. The Cou
gars, whose passing game became
virtually non-existent last week
against the Trojans when their
great Bob Newman and his re
placement. Dave Wilson, were
sidelined by injuries, will be meet
ing UCLA for possibly the last
time in history. Wilson should be
back for the Bruins, but Newman
is doubtful.
Two staggering teams, Oregon
and Washington, hope to break
loose against each other this
week in Seattle. Both teams have
lost much of the luster attributed
to them by fast starts and have
nothing to gain but an insisgnifi
cant win.

however. OSC comes into the
game with consecutive wins over
Idaho and Washington.
WSC and USC, apparently the
class of the league after smash
ing opening-game victories, have
their backs to the wall. The Cou
gars, whose passing game became
virtually non-existent last week
against the Trojans when their
great Bob Newman and his re
placement. Dave Wilson, were
sidelined by injuries, will be meet
ing UCLA for possibly the last
time in history. Wilson should be
back for the Bruins, but Newman
is doubtful.
Two staggering teams, Oregon
and Washington, hope to break
loose against each other this
week in Seattle. Both teams have
lost much of the luster attributed
to them by fast starts and have
nothing to gain but an insisgnifi
cant win.
The zero hour has arrived for
Joe Kapp and his University of
California mates in their hopeful
drive to the Rose Bowl. The
Bears tangle with the we-don't
lose-at-home Oregon State Bea
vers tomorrow in a crucial that
could either even up the Pasadena
race or give Cal a healthy lead
with only three games left.
Other action pits Washington
Stale against UCLA in Los An
geles. Oregon at Washington and
Southern California at Stanford.
In non - conference play, Idaho
meets San Jose State at Boise.
Cal has been breaking all kinds
of personal records during the
past four weeks and a win tomor
row would make this the first
year since 1951 that the Bears
have put four conference victo
ries together.
Those Roses
But more important is that the
Bears lead the Race to the Roses
with a 3-0 record and OSC is 3-1.
Stanford is 2-1 in league action
and meets an SC team that can't
afford to lose another.
WSC is in the same boat with
the Trojans, with two losses and
all but mathematically out of the
race.
Oregon State hasn't lost a home
game since 1954, and hasn't lost
to Cal in that time. But the Bears
have been making a habit of
breaking Ibis kind of record all
season now and the Bear-Beaver
clash looms as the conference's
most important of the season.
Kapp on His Way
With Joe Kapp well on his way
to All - American rating as the
master of the Bear Split-T, Cal
has generated the loop's most po
tent offense this season. The up
and-down Beavers will give the
leaky Bear defense a stern test,
however. OSC comes into the
game with consecutive wins over
Idaho and Washington.
