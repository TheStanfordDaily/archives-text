That Or Klliics Business

Sometimes tlie world spins the wrong way. It did at Stanford
yesterday; didn't you feel it? If you didn't, ask lleuil Coach Jack
Curtice; ho did. And it seems to me it spun that way because a half
back. or was it a fullback, was spinning some other way.
Every so often a newspaperman, or maybe oven a corps of them,
get a chance to talk about newspaper ethics. It's always an enlight
ening talk because journalists don't get to talk about this subject
too often, and lots of texbook phrases come up when they do. But
these textbook philosophies are always pretty sound, so let's talk

about a few.
Thursday morning's breakfast
was probably Trojan coach Don
Clark's most enjoyable meal this
week. It would get my vote for 1
"meal of the week" anyway. I'll
bet he could hardly get his coffee
down figuring out defenses for
shovel passes and slot-back for
mations.
Rut around here Jack Curtice is
probably voting Wednesday night
as the longest all-night vigil he's
put in since migrating to the
Farm.
So how'd it all happen, any
way? Here at Stanford each of
the country's two wire services
and most of the San Francisco
papers have "campus correspond
ents.'." These guys, or gals as the
case might be, survey the cam
pus, then call their home offices
with reports.
On Wednesday night the AP
correspondent called in his foot
ball practice report. It probably
sounded a lot like this:

Correspondent (just finis-hing up): .. . and they worked on
some plays for SC.
AP: What do you mean? What sort of plays?
Correspondent: You know, secret playsl To use against SC.
AP: I don't understand what you mean; like what?
Correspondent (after outlining two of them): . . . like that;
see what I mean?
AP: Ah, yes, thank you.
Part No. 2 of our story- that part which appeared in rather large
and black headlines here, but apparently not in l-os Angeles Thurs
day morning—is fairly well known by now, so we'll skip that and
go on to look at a few other aspects of this depending-upon-how-you
look-at-it funny situation.
Some Unwritten Laws
Sports writers have a pretty constant access to this sort of mate
rial; they always watch practices to see what's being done to top the
opposition. It's an unwritten law of confidence that they don't spill
the technical beans. You generalize by saying, maybe, the Indians
worked on some new passing plays and a series of running plays,
but not complete with the how and wherefore details. This is a pretty
old practice.
STOP So now you'll ask "Why shouldn't a reporter report .all the
facts and truth about what lie knows?" A good question, but suppose
any team were to hold a locked practice—you wouldn't see it then,
would you? No, you wouldn't. And besides, in generalizing you are
reporting fact and truth. In a way it's like war correspondence—
you hold back the security information.
Now to how it got onto the wire and into the paper. All around
they're admitting it was a slip up, and these things do occur. Up
in San Francisco on the wire desk a night-side news rewrite man
took the phone call from Stanford. To a newsman this sort of "se
cret" news is NEWS, BIG NKWS. And a guy who doesn't realize
that this material is already in the hands and minds of sports people
around the area is likely to send it out over the wire the way he did.
And it got into the papers because it got on the wire. Once there
it becomes open season and a paper has to use it to protect itself.
After all, it's embarrassing to come out on the street having hushed
up a story only to see your rivals spreading it in headlines. Daily
Trojan Sports Editor Garry Short reports, however, that it got little
or no play in the Southland, and oddly enough only one S.F. paper
carried it.
Where it hurts is the fact that this might have gone South where,
if anywhere, it might do some harm. But it isn't going to do any
because the most obvious part of the whole thing is that fooball
coaches know what plays are in existence, which are likely to be
thrown at them, and especially which ones opponents have used
in 1,-.

before. J his is an old t nriiee
play and Clark must know it.
The big question is WHY did
AP send this story out? First,
it's news; second, it happened
through a night man not accus
tomed to handling sports in this
manner. What amazes me most
is that this night man never ques
tioned any possible ethical impli
cation involved in what he was
doing. It certainly wouldn't be
AP's policy to make a practice of
leaking information like this, and
this comes from Al' Sportsman
Jack Stephenson. The fellow lid
n't realize just what was going
on.
And as for the local boy who
tried to explain too much, and
who has taken so many gaseous
retorts by this time, I will say he
full well knew about the confi
dential nature of information like
this. would never have purposely
tried to expose as little as a false
lineman's weight. He took for

granted, "DON'T Rule No. 1,"
that the contact in San Francisco understood him and Ihe situation.
It was tough luck all around.
That New Team
Frosli Coach Homer Smith proudly pulls hack the veil on Pa
poose's, 1958 tomorrow when his Stanford freshmen take on the Uni
versity of Southern California yearlings in a 10:45 a.m. start in the
Stadium. Smith promises to show one of ihe best-rounded frosh
squads that Stanfordites have seen in a while.
Any frosh squad is the product of what seems like endless hours
of scouting, convincing and practicing—and for sports writers, Buck
Clubbers, varsity coaches, students and the like it seems like a never
materializing thing until the frosh finally hit it off.
Freshman seasons are not very long, three-gamers in fact. After
this week's lilt the frosh lake off for Los Annelev next Friday and
finish up in the Little Big Game with Cal here on the 15th.
Names like Jim Smith, Chris Cottle, Marlin Walling, Stan Lind
skog and <lim Moe seem destined to he big names on the Card horizon.
But the great part about ball like this is that you can't tell which
of these guys is going to he tomorrow's All-American. From out of
frovh hall ranks has come many a comparative unknown rising to
the top of a heap. College ball is a whale of a lot different from high
school play and the guys who take most to it are not always the ones
who seem like they're going to.
THAT "NEW LOOK" TKAM Talk about surprises from football
teams, how're you gonna pick a pre game star out of the Card lineup
Saturday, flarber, Burford, Bernadotti, Donahue? Or is it somebody
else's turn this week? Despite the plays the Cards will be working
with Saturday they're hound to come up with a number of surprises—'
if not formation-wise it'll be performance-wise for sure, and like
Grimsley out of New York, I sec the old Cards coming up with a
blanket of Roses (perhaps an unfortunate figure for a win right now,

Part No. 2 of our story- that part which appeared in rather large
and black headlines here, but apparently not in l-os Angeles Thurs
day morning—is fairly well known by now, so we'll skip that and
go on to look at a few other aspects of this depending-upon-how-you
look-at-it funny situation.
Some Unwritten Laws
Sports writers have a pretty constant access to this sort of mate
rial; they always watch practices to see what's being done to top the
opposition. It's an unwritten law of confidence that they don't spill
the technical beans. You generalize by saying, maybe, the Indians
worked on some new passing plays and a series of running plays,
but not complete with the how and wherefore details. This is a pretty
old practice.
STOP So now you'll ask "Why shouldn't a reporter report .all the
facts and truth about what lie knows?" A good question, but suppose
any team were to hold a locked practice—you wouldn't see it then,
would you? No, you wouldn't. And besides, in generalizing you are
reporting fact and truth. In a way it's like war correspondence—
you hold back the security information.
Now to how it got onto the wire and into the paper. All around
they're admitting it was a slip up, and these things do occur. Up
in San Francisco on the wire desk a night-side news rewrite man
took the phone call from Stanford. To a newsman this sort of "se
cret" news is NEWS, BIG NKWS. And a guy who doesn't realize
that this material is already in the hands and minds of sports people
around the area is likely to send it out over the wire the way he did.
And it got into the papers because it got on the wire. Once there
it becomes open season and a paper has to use it to protect itself.
After all, it's embarrassing to come out on the street having hushed
up a story only to see your rivals spreading it in headlines. Daily
Trojan Sports Editor Garry Short reports, however, that it got little
or no play in the Southland, and oddly enough only one S.F. paper
carried it.
Where it hurts is the fact that this might have gone South where,
if anywhere, it might do some harm. But it isn't going to do any
because the most obvious part of the whole thing is that fooball
coaches know what plays are in existence, which are likely to be
thrown at them, and especially which ones opponents have used
in 1,-.

before. J his is an old t nriiee
play and Clark must know it.
The big question is WHY did
AP send this story out? First,
it's news; second, it happened
through a night man not accus
tomed to handling sports in this
manner. What amazes me most
is that this night man never ques
tioned any possible ethical impli
cation involved in what he was
doing. It certainly wouldn't be
AP's policy to make a practice of
leaking information like this, and
this comes from Al' Sportsman
Jack Stephenson. The fellow lid
n't realize just what was going
on.
And as for the local boy who
tried to explain too much, and
who has taken so many gaseous
retorts by this time, I will say he
full well knew about the confi
dential nature of information like
this. would never have purposely
tried to expose as little as a false
lineman's weight. He took for

granted, "DON'T Rule No. 1,"
that the contact in San Francisco understood him and Ihe situation.
It was tough luck all around.
That New Team
Frosli Coach Homer Smith proudly pulls hack the veil on Pa
poose's, 1958 tomorrow when his Stanford freshmen take on the Uni
versity of Southern California yearlings in a 10:45 a.m. start in the
Stadium. Smith promises to show one of ihe best-rounded frosh
squads that Stanfordites have seen in a while.
Any frosh squad is the product of what seems like endless hours
of scouting, convincing and practicing—and for sports writers, Buck
Clubbers, varsity coaches, students and the like it seems like a never
materializing thing until the frosh finally hit it off.
Freshman seasons are not very long, three-gamers in fact. After
this week's lilt the frosh lake off for Los Annelev next Friday and
finish up in the Little Big Game with Cal here on the 15th.
Names like Jim Smith, Chris Cottle, Marlin Walling, Stan Lind
skog and <lim Moe seem destined to he big names on the Card horizon.
But the great part about ball like this is that you can't tell which
of these guys is going to he tomorrow's All-American. From out of
frovh hall ranks has come many a comparative unknown rising to
the top of a heap. College ball is a whale of a lot different from high
school play and the guys who take most to it are not always the ones
who seem like they're going to.
THAT "NEW LOOK" TKAM Talk about surprises from football
teams, how're you gonna pick a pre game star out of the Card lineup
Saturday, flarber, Burford, Bernadotti, Donahue? Or is it somebody
else's turn this week? Despite the plays the Cards will be working
with Saturday they're hound to come up with a number of surprises—'

COACH JACK CURTICE
He was surprised
That Or Klliics Business

Sometimes tlie world spins the wrong way. It did at Stanford
yesterday; didn't you feel it? If you didn't, ask lleuil Coach Jack
Curtice; ho did. And it seems to me it spun that way because a half
back. or was it a fullback, was spinning some other way.
Every so often a newspaperman, or maybe oven a corps of them,
get a chance to talk about newspaper ethics. It's always an enlight
ening talk because journalists don't get to talk about this subject
too often, and lots of texbook phrases come up when they do. But
these textbook philosophies are always pretty sound, so let's talk

about a few.
Thursday morning's breakfast
was probably Trojan coach Don
Clark's most enjoyable meal this
week. It would get my vote for 1
"meal of the week" anyway. I'll
bet he could hardly get his coffee
down figuring out defenses for
shovel passes and slot-back for
mations.
Rut around here Jack Curtice is
probably voting Wednesday night
as the longest all-night vigil he's
put in since migrating to the
Farm.
So how'd it all happen, any
way? Here at Stanford each of
the country's two wire services
and most of the San Francisco
papers have "campus correspond
ents.'." These guys, or gals as the
case might be, survey the cam
pus, then call their home offices
with reports.
On Wednesday night the AP
correspondent called in his foot
ball practice report. It probably
sounded a lot like this:

Correspondent (just finis-hing up): .. . and they worked on
some plays for SC.
AP: What do you mean? What sort of plays?
Correspondent: You know, secret playsl To use against SC.
AP: I don't understand what you mean; like what?
Correspondent (after outlining two of them): . . . like that;
see what I mean?

COACH JACK CURTICE
He was surprised
That Or Klliics Business

Sometimes tlie world spins the wrong way. It did at Stanford
yesterday; didn't you feel it? If you didn't, ask lleuil Coach Jack
Curtice; ho did. And it seems to me it spun that way because a half
back. or was it a fullback, was spinning some other way.
Every so often a newspaperman, or maybe oven a corps of them,
get a chance to talk about newspaper ethics. It's always an enlight
ening talk because journalists don't get to talk about this subject
too often, and lots of texbook phrases come up when they do. But
these textbook philosophies are always pretty sound, so let's talk

about a few.
Thursday morning's breakfast
was probably Trojan coach Don
Clark's most enjoyable meal this
week. It would get my vote for 1
"meal of the week" anyway. I'll
bet he could hardly get his coffee
down figuring out defenses for
shovel passes and slot-back for
mations.
Rut around here Jack Curtice is
probably voting Wednesday night
as the longest all-night vigil he's
put in since migrating to the
Farm.
So how'd it all happen, any
way? Here at Stanford each of
the country's two wire services
and most of the San Francisco
papers have "campus correspond
ents.'." These guys, or gals as the
case might be, survey the cam
pus, then call their home offices
with reports.
On Wednesday night the AP
correspondent called in his foot
ball practice report. It probably
sounded a lot like this:

Correspondent (just finis-hing up): .. . and they worked on
some plays for SC.
AP: What do you mean? What sort of plays?
Correspondent: You know, secret playsl To use against SC.
AP: I don't understand what you mean; like what?
Correspondent (after outlining two of them): . . . like that;
see what I mean?
AP: Ah, yes, thank you.
Part No. 2 of our story- that part which appeared in rather large
and black headlines here, but apparently not in l-os Angeles Thurs
day morning—is fairly well known by now, so we'll skip that and
go on to look at a few other aspects of this depending-upon-how-you
look-at-it funny situation.
Some Unwritten Laws
Sports writers have a pretty constant access to this sort of mate
rial; they always watch practices to see what's being done to top the
opposition. It's an unwritten law of confidence that they don't spill
the technical beans. You generalize by saying, maybe, the Indians
worked on some new passing plays and a series of running plays,
but not complete with the how and wherefore details. This is a pretty
old practice.
STOP So now you'll ask "Why shouldn't a reporter report .all the
facts and truth about what lie knows?" A good question, but suppose
any team were to hold a locked practice—you wouldn't see it then,
would you? No, you wouldn't. And besides, in generalizing you are
reporting fact and truth. In a way it's like war correspondence—
you hold back the security information.
Now to how it got onto the wire and into the paper. All around
they're admitting it was a slip up, and these things do occur. Up
in San Francisco on the wire desk a night-side news rewrite man
took the phone call from Stanford. To a newsman this sort of "se
cret" news is NEWS, BIG NKWS. And a guy who doesn't realize
that this material is already in the hands and minds of sports people
around the area is likely to send it out over the wire the way he did.
And it got into the papers because it got on the wire. Once there
it becomes open season and a paper has to use it to protect itself.
After all, it's embarrassing to come out on the street having hushed
up a story only to see your rivals spreading it in headlines. Daily
Trojan Sports Editor Garry Short reports, however, that it got little
or no play in the Southland, and oddly enough only one S.F. paper
carried it.

COACH JACK CURTICE
He was surprised
That Or Klliics Business

Sometimes tlie world spins the wrong way. It did at Stanford
yesterday; didn't you feel it? If you didn't, ask lleuil Coach Jack
Curtice; ho did. And it seems to me it spun that way because a half
back. or was it a fullback, was spinning some other way.
Every so often a newspaperman, or maybe oven a corps of them,
get a chance to talk about newspaper ethics. It's always an enlight
ening talk because journalists don't get to talk about this subject
too often, and lots of texbook phrases come up when they do. But
these textbook philosophies are always pretty sound, so let's talk

about a few.
Thursday morning's breakfast
was probably Trojan coach Don
Clark's most enjoyable meal this
week. It would get my vote for 1
"meal of the week" anyway. I'll
bet he could hardly get his coffee
down figuring out defenses for
shovel passes and slot-back for
mations.
Rut around here Jack Curtice is
probably voting Wednesday night
as the longest all-night vigil he's
put in since migrating to the
Farm.
So how'd it all happen, any
way? Here at Stanford each of
the country's two wire services
and most of the San Francisco
papers have "campus correspond
ents.'." These guys, or gals as the
case might be, survey the cam
pus, then call their home offices
with reports.
On Wednesday night the AP
correspondent called in his foot
ball practice report. It probably
sounded a lot like this:

Correspondent (just finis-hing up): .. . and they worked on
some plays for SC.
AP: What do you mean? What sort of plays?
Correspondent: You know, secret playsl To use against SC.
AP: I don't understand what you mean; like what?
Correspondent (after outlining two of them): . . . like that;
see what I mean?
AP: Ah, yes, thank you.
Part No. 2 of our story- that part which appeared in rather large
and black headlines here, but apparently not in l-os Angeles Thurs
day morning—is fairly well known by now, so we'll skip that and
go on to look at a few other aspects of this depending-upon-how-you
look-at-it funny situation.
Some Unwritten Laws
Sports writers have a pretty constant access to this sort of mate
rial; they always watch practices to see what's being done to top the
opposition. It's an unwritten law of confidence that they don't spill
the technical beans. You generalize by saying, maybe, the Indians
worked on some new passing plays and a series of running plays,
but not complete with the how and wherefore details. This is a pretty
old practice.
STOP So now you'll ask "Why shouldn't a reporter report .all the
facts and truth about what lie knows?" A good question, but suppose
any team were to hold a locked practice—you wouldn't see it then,
would you? No, you wouldn't. And besides, in generalizing you are
reporting fact and truth. In a way it's like war correspondence—
you hold back the security information.
Now to how it got onto the wire and into the paper. All around
they're admitting it was a slip up, and these things do occur. Up
in San Francisco on the wire desk a night-side news rewrite man
took the phone call from Stanford. To a newsman this sort of "se
cret" news is NEWS, BIG NKWS. And a guy who doesn't realize
that this material is already in the hands and minds of sports people
around the area is likely to send it out over the wire the way he did.
And it got into the papers because it got on the wire. Once there
it becomes open season and a paper has to use it to protect itself.
After all, it's embarrassing to come out on the street having hushed
up a story only to see your rivals spreading it in headlines. Daily
Trojan Sports Editor Garry Short reports, however, that it got little
or no play in the Southland, and oddly enough only one S.F. paper
carried it.
Where it hurts is the fact that this might have gone South where,
if anywhere, it might do some harm. But it isn't going to do any
because the most obvious part of the whole thing is that fooball
coaches know what plays are in existence, which are likely to be
thrown at them, and especially which ones opponents have used
in 1,-.

before. J his is an old t nriiee
play and Clark must know it.
The big question is WHY did
AP send this story out? First,
it's news; second, it happened
through a night man not accus
tomed to handling sports in this
manner. What amazes me most
is that this night man never ques
tioned any possible ethical impli
cation involved in what he was
doing. It certainly wouldn't be
AP's policy to make a practice of
leaking information like this, and
this comes from Al' Sportsman
Jack Stephenson. The fellow lid
n't realize just what was going
on.
And as for the local boy who
tried to explain too much, and
who has taken so many gaseous
retorts by this time, I will say he
full well knew about the confi
dential nature of information like
this. would never have purposely
tried to expose as little as a false
lineman's weight. He took for

granted, "DON'T Rule No. 1,"
that the contact in San Francisco understood him and Ihe situation.
It was tough luck all around.
