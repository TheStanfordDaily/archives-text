# Work Begins on New Post Office
## 
### 
To anyone who has been in the
neighborhood of the post office
since the quarter began, several
changes are at once apparent.
The SAE house, previously di
rectly across the street from the
post office, is presently situated
up the row from its former loca
tion. Jackhammers have been
working on old foundations and
Lane "A" has been blocked off to
through traffic. These changes
are in preparation for construc
tion of a new Bookstore and post
office.
The $430,000 Bookstore will go
up on Lasuen Street next door to
the present Bookstore. The new
$186,000 post office will be built
next to it, directly across the
street from the present site.
