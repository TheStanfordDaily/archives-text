## Atom Tests Terminate 
### 
Compiled from Associated Press
The United States ended its fall
nuclear test series Thursday with
a record underground blast that
ripped a huge hole in the side of
a mesa.
The series was unique for two
things: (1) a number of low-pow
ered blasts aimed at developing an
arsenal of small, easily handled
atomic weapons; (2) a number of
underground shots designed to
explore peacetime uses for atomic
energy.
L.A. Irradiated
A sharp increase in radioac
tivity over Southern California
Thursday set off a wave of indig
nation and apprehension.
The Los Angeles City Health
Department said the amount of
radioactivity in the air rose 20 per
cent above the accepted safe level
for human consumption over a
period of months.
Dr. Albert W. Bellamy, Univer
sity of California at Los Angteles,
advised: "Don't press the panic
button."
Health Impaired
He said a person would have to
be exposed to 10 times the
amount measured for several
months to have his health im
paired.
Dr. Paul Saltman, University of
Southern California professor of
biochemistry, said:
"Radiation exposure is a cumu
lative thing. What happens to
day we always have with us.
True, the maximum permissible
level is a continuous level. But
radiation that is begun today
staysâ€”almost forever."
