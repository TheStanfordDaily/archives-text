the "major upsets of recent po
litical history." Mentions no fig

control of the House and lose
none of its Senate seats.

Adlai E. Stevenson "The Re
publicans can't talk about corrup
tion, prosperity, deficit spending,
or peace, so they have fallen back
on the old charges of radicalism
and left-wingers." Added: "The
tragedy of the Eisenhower admin
istration is that its only weapons
seem to be platitudes or para
troops, and this seems to be true
whether the situation is Little
Rock or 1 Lebanon. South America
or Quemoy."
Vice-President Nixon— Predict
ed unprecedented inflation if vot
ers elect a Congress controlled by
what he called "free - wheeling,
free-spending Democrats of the
Northern wing of the party."

and the Eisenhower-Dulles policy
resulted in peace."
