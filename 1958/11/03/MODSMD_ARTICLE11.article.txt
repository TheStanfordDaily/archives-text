# Alpha Sig, Lathrop Take Decorations Sweepstakes
## Trojans Lose -On Paper 
### 
If it had been up to the planners
of the house decorations, the foot
ball grid would have been covered
with the blood of Troy Saturday
afternoon.
The USC Trojans gol the worst,
of it in the decorations which dot
ted the campus landscape for
Homecoming.
Winning the sweepstakes prize
in the house decorations contest,
sponsored by Cardinals, were Al
pha Sigma Phi and Lathrop
House. "Good C)l' Charlie Brown"
dominated their contribution to
color and spirit.
Other Winners
Other winners included I>elt;i
Kappa Epsilon, men's division;
Lathrop, women's division; Chi
Psi-Cardenal-Paloma, originality;
Sigma Chi and Storey, theme; and
Theta Delta Chi and Guthrie,
humor.
Subjects varied from a giant,
wounded, bloodshot eye to a Tro
jan horse drinking Trojan victory
juice. Probably the simplest deco
ration was that on Union resi
dence—a banner spanning the two
towers reading "Welcome Home."
Judging the decorations were
John Bohn, ASSU president; City
Editor and Mrs. Boyd Haight, of
the Palo Alto Times; Mrs. Robert
Pierce, wife of the Stanford alum
ni secretary; and Jacques Guil
main. instructor in the history of
architecture.
General Theme
"Odd SC" was the gene ra I
theme of this year's Homecoming
program, which began Friday eve
ning with the traditional rally in
Frost Amphitheatre. There the
audience met Helen of Troy and
watched as Prince Lightfoot set
Tommy Trojan ablaze.
Saturday morning alumni and
•students toured the campus to
view the decorations and witness
ed an hour-and-a-half program on
The Row.
