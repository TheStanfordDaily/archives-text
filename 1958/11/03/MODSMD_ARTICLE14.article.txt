# Prop. 17—No
## 
### 
Till-: sill itio.x mi Proposition IT on the California ballot is de
11\ complex. Moth proponents and opponents have set lortli
reasons which seem to ns valid. Ilowever, we Ic»*l that this measure
does not answer the tax law needs as set lortli in the reasoning ol
hotli sides, and therefore urge a NO vote on Proposition 1..
Proposition 17 provi<Jes for the reduction of sales and use taxes
from 3 to 2 per cent, and changes income tax rates I now ranging
from I per cent on incomes under $S,(MM) to 6 per cent on incomes
over $25,000) to a new range of '/2 l M ' r C, ' M ' 0,1 incomes under
$5,000 to 16 per «>«> ill on incomes over $50,000. Ihe legislature
may lower hut not increase the sales tax. Income tax can he
changed only hy a vote of the people.
Proponents argue that the present lax burden falls upon those
who are least able to pay. Sixty-three percent of the general fund
conies from sales tax and 13 per cent from income tax.
'I his. claim the proponents. favors the u'< j allhy at the
expense of the low income millions. Proposition IT. they
say. would be a stef) toward a more eqnitablt• distribution
of wealth.
Ninety per cent of the taxpayers would benefit from this
change, say the proponents, and the remaining 10 per cent would
assume a fairer share of state costs. Proposition 17, they say,
would add sonic S7O million in purchasing power to California's
economy.
()n the other hand, the opponents claim the measure will cause
financial loss to the state, which is already facing a $200 million
deficit in the next budget. The opponents also fear that the
increase in taxes on higher incomes would drive out and keep out
of California persons with capital. I hey point out that under the
present law personal exemptions are $2,000 (or single persons,
83,500 for married couples and $400 for each dependent —hence,
the lower income families do not pay a tax anyway.
Opponents cry with alarm that the tax reductions
iconld hurt tinschools financially. They also note that
California's tax rates compare favorably with those in
other states
Both sides claim their figures come from state offices and other
ofTicial sources.
While the idea of taxation according to the ability
to pay is valid in principle. Proposition IT places too
many binds on the legislature and freezes the sources of
income for tin' state.
Thus the legislature is unable to adjust taxes to meet changing
conditions, though it conceivably adopt a different tax, perhaps
on food, in order to get more revenue.
California's tax structure requires serious consideration on tin'
basis of fairness and the financial position of the state. Proposi
tion 17 as an initiative measure has not permitted this consider
ation and should be defeated.
