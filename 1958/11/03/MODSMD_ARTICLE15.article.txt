# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## 'Booth,' 'Old Man' Not Top Shows 
### 
We make no claim to being a
drama critic, but we would like to
comment on two productions we
attended on their recent opening
nights in San Francisco.
The first of these was Warner
Brothers' film version of Heming
way's "The Old Man and the Sea."
Time magazine is merciless as it
slashes ihe picture — but, then,
Time is usually hard to please.
According to Time, even di
rector John Sturges says it is
technically the sloppiest picture
he has ever made.
It may be sloppy, but we'd like
to pose another word for it "in
teresting." (To say it is "interest
ing," of course, leaves much room
for interpretation and neither con
demns nor condones the movie it
self. )
We found most interesting the
photography, which, being out of
focus most of the time, lent an
ethereal quality to the subject
matter. Forgetting the story it -
self, one could read into the
scenes such as the predawn lan
tern march to the fishing boats
one's own interpretation.
It's "interesting," too, because
seldom these days do you see a
movie with so little action and
dialogue. "Old Man" is chiefly
narrative, with monologue by the
star. Spencer Tracy.
One sympathizes with the
noble fish more than with the
trials of the human hero, whose
bloodied hands are not convinc
ing symbols of his struggle.
On stage now at the Alcazar
Theatre in San Francisco is "Ed
win Booth." Despite the skill of
actor - producer - etc. Jose Ferrer,
this play in many ways is less
convincing than Tracy's bloody
hands.
Ferrer as the actor Booth is one
character, but Ferrer as Booth as
a'Shakespearean actor is someone

else again. Perhaps Ferrer could
handle a Shakespearean role in a
complete Shakespearean play; we
haven't seen him in one. so we
won't pass judgment on this. But
in "Edwin Booth" he had diffi
culty in making the transition be
tween characters.
He was always Edwin Booth,
in our eyes, and never became
a convincing Hamlet or Romeo
even when In* had time to spout
more than a couple of lines.
The staging and lighting in the
play are well handled, but we
found the scene of the shooting of
President Lincoln "hammy," to
use the time-honored, trite dra
matic colloquialism. A shot is
fired, a woman screams, and dash
ing "Johnny Wilkes" leaps to the
center of the stage, brandishing a
gun and crying noble words.
We also wish they would have
left out the thunder in the death
scene it was a "tried and could
n't" sound effect.
We can't honestly urge anyone
to see either of these two produc
tions, although we don't think
anyone would be completely dis
appointed in them.
We saw another program Fri
day night in Frost Amphitheatre.
We had to check Webster to see
if we were expecting too much
but Webster defines "rally" as "to
join in active support."
After watching and listening
to Friday night's efforts, we
thought the best comment was
heard as the strains of the Stan
ford Hymn died away: "Let's
have a RALLY now."
We were also wondering what
with so many would-be wits wan
dering around this campus why
we couldn't come up with some
answers to USC's taunts al Sat
urday's football game. That, at
least, would have made the after
noon interesting.

We were also wondering what
with so many would-be wits wan
dering around this campus why
we couldn't come up with some
answers to USC's taunts al Sat
urday's football game. That, at
least, would have made the after
noon interesting.
We make no claim to being a
drama critic, but we would like to
comment on two productions we
attended on their recent opening
nights in San Francisco.
The first of these was Warner
Brothers' film version of Heming
way's "The Old Man and the Sea."
Time magazine is merciless as it
slashes ihe picture — but, then,
Time is usually hard to please.
According to Time, even di
rector John Sturges says it is
technically the sloppiest picture
he has ever made.
It may be sloppy, but we'd like
to pose another word for it "in
teresting." (To say it is "interest
ing," of course, leaves much room
for interpretation and neither con
demns nor condones the movie it
self. )
We found most interesting the
photography, which, being out of
focus most of the time, lent an
ethereal quality to the subject
matter. Forgetting the story it -
self, one could read into the
scenes such as the predawn lan
tern march to the fishing boats
one's own interpretation.
It's "interesting," too, because
seldom these days do you see a
movie with so little action and
dialogue. "Old Man" is chiefly
narrative, with monologue by the
star. Spencer Tracy.
One sympathizes with the
noble fish more than with the
trials of the human hero, whose
bloodied hands are not convinc
ing symbols of his struggle.
On stage now at the Alcazar
Theatre in San Francisco is "Ed
win Booth." Despite the skill of
actor - producer - etc. Jose Ferrer,
this play in many ways is less
convincing than Tracy's bloody
hands.
Ferrer as the actor Booth is one
character, but Ferrer as Booth as
a'Shakespearean actor is someone

else again. Perhaps Ferrer could
handle a Shakespearean role in a
complete Shakespearean play; we
haven't seen him in one. so we
won't pass judgment on this. But
in "Edwin Booth" he had diffi
culty in making the transition be
tween characters.
He was always Edwin Booth,
in our eyes, and never became
a convincing Hamlet or Romeo
even when In* had time to spout
more than a couple of lines.
The staging and lighting in the
play are well handled, but we
found the scene of the shooting of
President Lincoln "hammy," to
use the time-honored, trite dra
matic colloquialism. A shot is
fired, a woman screams, and dash
ing "Johnny Wilkes" leaps to the
center of the stage, brandishing a
gun and crying noble words.
We also wish they would have
left out the thunder in the death
scene it was a "tried and could
n't" sound effect.
We can't honestly urge anyone
to see either of these two produc
tions, although we don't think
anyone would be completely dis
appointed in them.
We saw another program Fri
day night in Frost Amphitheatre.
We had to check Webster to see
if we were expecting too much
but Webster defines "rally" as "to
join in active support."
After watching and listening
to Friday night's efforts, we
thought the best comment was
heard as the strains of the Stan
ford Hymn died away: "Let's
have a RALLY now."
