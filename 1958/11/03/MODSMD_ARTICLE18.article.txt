Question of Ethics
Editor, The Daily:
I cannot let Nov. 4 roll around
without answering your Friday
editorial in which you espoused a
NO vote for Proposition 16. It
seems to me that your under
standing of the real issues involv
ed in this proposition is rather
hazy.
First of all, may I say that one
is very easily led astray by some
of the propaganda put out recent
ly by both those in favor of and
those against this measure. Thus
I maintain that both sides are
wrong in playing up the financial
side of this proposition. We can
not afford, especially in this day
and age. to put a price tag on the
value of education.
Proposition 16 was not put on
the ballot primarily to save the
public from paying "double taxes"
which are burdening them beyond
all reason, nor was it advanced to
impose "this unfair taxation on
certain undeserving parents who
merely wish to exercise their con
stitutional right to send their chil
dren to private schools," as some
sort of punishment or control
measure.
Taxation is not punishment; it
is payment for services rendered
by our government. It will be ad
mitted that both the public citi
zens and the private schools could
pay for these services (which you
admit amount to not more than
$1,175,000 annually) without any
undue hardships.
I challenge you to give evidence
that this tax "burden could close
some financially pressed private
schools, and others would take in
fewer children."
I know of some private grade
schools in the East Bay which
pride themselves in the fact that
they are completely self-support
ing and would welcome the op
portunity to pay their rightful
share of state taxes. I am certain
that most private schools would
not have to raise their tuition by
very much.
But the question is not one of
economics but of ethics!
Where does the responsibility
actually belong? The opponents
of this proposition ask, "Are not
the private schools rendering the
state a service by taking the
'340,000 children' out of the pub
lic schools and thereby relieving
the state of part of its obliga
tions."
The answer would be "yes" if
the schools were completely non
sectarian and non-profit. But since
over 90 per cent of the private
schools are under religious con
trol at the under-collegiate level,
and since religious organizations
are. beyond a doubt, big business,
I must contend that there is no
excuse for tax exemption.
The Constitution of the United
States explicitly avows church and
stale separation. The proposition
does not. as the editor so nobly
declares, "involve the right of re
ligious groups to maintain their
systems of belief"; it merely says
that they cannot call this "educa
tion" and then ask for tax exemp
tion.
The editor asks, "Why do the
proponents of Proposition 16 not
go further and move to tax pri
vate colleges and universities or
church-supported hospitals?" My
answer is it SHOULD go further
and insist that any institution
which compels its students to he
indoctrinated in a church's busi
ness should not be given any spe
cial exemptions on this account.

Re: editorial. Oct. 30.
It appears to me that a great
many people have confused the
basic issue involved in Proposi
tion 18, the "Right to Work" legis
lation. It is not whether we are
supporting or not supporting un
ions. They are a useful part of
our economy, and that is a fact.
The question involved is the fol
lowing: In a republic such as the
United States, is il constitutional

let alone desirable, for an indi
vidual to he required to belong to
any organization other than the
republic itself- this notwithstand
ing the fact that the majority
wishes that he belong to some or
ganization?
Perhaps the answer is that in
a republic the wishes of the ma
jority are expressed consistent
with the protection of the rights
of the individual.
Is it a right that an individual
may belong to a lodge by choice,
a church by choice, a union by
choice, a professional organization
by choice, or other organizations
by choice? That is the question.
An employed individual owes
his faithful execution of his job
to his employer. To his fellow
employees he owes only his on
the-job cooperation and not any
affiliation.
Deriving benefits from an or
ganization, particularly when
those benefits are not asked for,
is no criteria for the required
membership in that organization.
We all derive benefits from many
organizations. These benefits are
in the form of lobbies which pro
tect our interests, or in the form
of charities, or in a multitude of
other forms.
Even though the organizations
behind these benefits may be a
"far greater force for good than
for evil" as attested by the ma
jority. we are not yet required to
belong to all of them. Perhaps we
cannot or do not care to support
them.
The choice is ours. The respon
sibility for that choice is ours.
Let us keep it that way.

Editor, The Daily:
I happened across a copy of the
California Machinists Press dated
Sept. 27, 1958, in which they
quoted a lead editorial of the Stan
ford Daily strongly recommend
ing a "no" vote on Proposition 18.
You state (according to the re
print i "There is little doubt as
the ultimate goal that advocators
of .R'ight-To-Work' laws seek.
That is the ultimate breakdown
of American labor unions. Those
who want to see a return to the
labor wars of the past, etc."
As vice chairman of the Glen
dale Committee FOR Proposition
18, I find your stand on this issue
surprising, or perhaps you are
parroting the teachings of some
of Stanford's more liberal theo
retical professors. I might ask
how many labor-management ne
gotiating sessions you have at
tended. how many leaders
you know, the conditions in
"open" shops, etc. To accuse the
many advocates of this issue of
forcing the "breakdown" of
unions is adolescent and asinine.
I would ask you how to make
unions responsive to their mem
bership. "Power tends to cor
rupt absolute power (compuls
ion! corrupts absolutely," and
fosters Ihe likes of Beck, Bridges,
I-loffa, Reuther and the many
others exposed by the McClellan
committee. Would you join a
Communist dominated union?
You would have to in order to
work for GE where represented
by the lUE. Want to join the
Teamsters so H of 112 a can steal
your dues, suppport political can
didates you don't approve of,
etc.?
There are thousands of "open"
shops operating peacefully and
satisfactorily in the country to
day, and the labor leaders are
much more sensitive to the
employees' needs than they are
in union shops where a man's
very livelihood depends on the
fact he toes the line or else.
I have dealt with a union in an
open shop for in years, and sin
cerely feel that unions must be
subject to checks and balances
just as any other organization.
I suggest as editor you stick to
something you might know some
thing about, such as what's
wrong with the football team.

$1,175,000 annually) without any
undue hardships.
I challenge you to give evidence
that this tax "burden could close
some financially pressed private
schools, and others would take in
fewer children."
I know of some private grade
schools in the East Bay which
pride themselves in the fact that
they are completely self-support
ing and would welcome the op
portunity to pay their rightful
share of state taxes. I am certain
that most private schools would
not have to raise their tuition by
very much.
But the question is not one of
economics but of ethics!
Where does the responsibility
actually belong? The opponents
of this proposition ask, "Are not
the private schools rendering the
state a service by taking the
'340,000 children' out of the pub
lic schools and thereby relieving
the state of part of its obliga
tions."
The answer would be "yes" if
the schools were completely non
sectarian and non-profit. But since
over 90 per cent of the private
schools are under religious con
trol at the under-collegiate level,
and since religious organizations
are. beyond a doubt, big business,
I must contend that there is no
excuse for tax exemption.
The Constitution of the United
States explicitly avows church and
stale separation. The proposition
does not. as the editor so nobly
declares, "involve the right of re
ligious groups to maintain their
systems of belief"; it merely says
that they cannot call this "educa
tion" and then ask for tax exemp
tion.
The editor asks, "Why do the
proponents of Proposition 16 not
go further and move to tax pri
vate colleges and universities or
church-supported hospitals?" My
answer is it SHOULD go further
and insist that any institution
which compels its students to he
indoctrinated in a church's busi

cial exemptions on this account.

Re: editorial. Oct. 30.
It appears to me that a great
many people have confused the
basic issue involved in Proposi
tion 18, the "Right to Work" legis
lation. It is not whether we are
supporting or not supporting un
ions. They are a useful part of
our economy, and that is a fact.
The question involved is the fol
lowing: In a republic such as the
United States, is il constitutional

let alone desirable, for an indi
vidual to he required to belong to
any organization other than the
republic itself- this notwithstand
ing the fact that the majority
wishes that he belong to some or
ganization?
Perhaps the answer is that in
a republic the wishes of the ma
jority are expressed consistent
with the protection of the rights
of the individual.
Is it a right that an individual
may belong to a lodge by choice,
a church by choice, a union by
choice, a professional organization
by choice, or other organizations
by choice? That is the question.
An employed individual owes
his faithful execution of his job
to his employer. To his fellow
employees he owes only his on
the-job cooperation and not any
affiliation.
Deriving benefits from an or
ganization, particularly when
those benefits are not asked for,
is no criteria for the required
membership in that organization.
We all derive benefits from many
organizations. These benefits are
in the form of lobbies which pro
tect our interests, or in the form
of charities, or in a multitude of
other forms.
Even though the organizations
behind these benefits may be a
"far greater force for good than
for evil" as attested by the ma
jority. we are not yet required to
belong to all of them. Perhaps we
cannot or do not care to support
them.
The choice is ours. The respon
sibility for that choice is ours.
Let us keep it that way.

Question of Ethics
Editor, The Daily:
I cannot let Nov. 4 roll around
without answering your Friday
editorial in which you espoused a
NO vote for Proposition 16. It
seems to me that your under
standing of the real issues involv

hazy.
First of all, may I say that one
is very easily led astray by some
of the propaganda put out recent
ly by both those in favor of and
those against this measure. Thus
I maintain that both sides are
wrong in playing up the financial
side of this proposition. We can
not afford, especially in this day
and age. to put a price tag on the
value of education.
Proposition 16 was not put on
the ballot primarily to save the
public from paying "double taxes"
which are burdening them beyond
all reason, nor was it advanced to
impose "this unfair taxation on
certain undeserving parents who
merely wish to exercise their con
stitutional right to send their chil
dren to private schools," as some
sort of punishment or control
measure.
Taxation is not punishment; it
is payment for services rendered
by our government. It will be ad

pay for these services (which you

Re: editorial. Oct. 30.
It appears to me that a great
many people have confused the
basic issue involved in Proposi
tion 18, the "Right to Work" legis
lation. It is not whether we are
supporting or not supporting un
ions. They are a useful part of
our economy, and that is a fact.
The question involved is the fol
lowing: In a republic such as the
United States, is il constitutional

let alone desirable, for an indi
vidual to he required to belong to
any organization other than the
republic itself- this notwithstand
ing the fact that the majority
wishes that he belong to some or
ganization?
Perhaps the answer is that in
a republic the wishes of the ma
jority are expressed consistent
with the protection of the rights
of the individual.
Is it a right that an individual
may belong to a lodge by choice,
a church by choice, a union by
choice, a professional organization
by choice, or other organizations
by choice? That is the question.
An employed individual owes
his faithful execution of his job
to his employer. To his fellow
employees he owes only his on
the-job cooperation and not any
affiliation.
Deriving benefits from an or
ganization, particularly when
those benefits are not asked for,
is no criteria for the required
membership in that organization.
We all derive benefits from many
organizations. These benefits are
in the form of lobbies which pro
tect our interests, or in the form
of charities, or in a multitude of
other forms.
Even though the organizations
behind these benefits may be a
"far greater force for good than
for evil" as attested by the ma
jority. we are not yet required to
belong to all of them. Perhaps we
cannot or do not care to support
them.
The choice is ours. The respon
sibility for that choice is ours.
Let us keep it that way.

Question of Ethics
Editor, The Daily:
I cannot let Nov. 4 roll around
without answering your Friday
editorial in which you espoused a
NO vote for Proposition 16. It
seems to me that your under
standing of the real issues involv
ed in this proposition is rather
hazy.
First of all, may I say that one
is very easily led astray by some
of the propaganda put out recent
ly by both those in favor of and
those against this measure. Thus
I maintain that both sides are
wrong in playing up the financial
side of this proposition. We can
not afford, especially in this day
and age. to put a price tag on the
value of education.
Proposition 16 was not put on
the ballot primarily to save the
public from paying "double taxes"
which are burdening them beyond
all reason, nor was it advanced to
impose "this unfair taxation on
certain undeserving parents who
merely wish to exercise their con
stitutional right to send their chil
dren to private schools," as some
sort of punishment or control
measure.
Taxation is not punishment; it
is payment for services rendered
by our government. It will be ad
mitted that both the public citi
zens and the private schools could
pay for these services (which you
admit amount to not more than
$1,175,000 annually) without any
undue hardships.
I challenge you to give evidence
that this tax "burden could close
some financially pressed private
schools, and others would take in
fewer children."
I know of some private grade
schools in the East Bay which
pride themselves in the fact that
they are completely self-support
ing and would welcome the op
portunity to pay their rightful
share of state taxes. I am certain
that most private schools would
not have to raise their tuition by
very much.
But the question is not one of
economics but of ethics!
Where does the responsibility
actually belong? The opponents
of this proposition ask, "Are not
the private schools rendering the
state a service by taking the
'340,000 children' out of the pub
lic schools and thereby relieving
the state of part of its obliga
tions."
The answer would be "yes" if
the schools were completely non
sectarian and non-profit. But since
over 90 per cent of the private
schools are under religious con
trol at the under-collegiate level,
and since religious organizations
are. beyond a doubt, big business,
I must contend that there is no
excuse for tax exemption.
The Constitution of the United

ganization?
Perhaps the answer is that in
a republic the wishes of the ma
jority are expressed consistent
with the protection of the rights
of the individual.
Is it a right that an individual
may belong to a lodge by choice,
a church by choice, a union by
choice, a professional organization
by choice, or other organizations
by choice? That is the question.
An employed individual owes
his faithful execution of his job
to his employer. To his fellow
employees he owes only his on
the-job cooperation and not any
affiliation.
Deriving benefits from an or
ganization, particularly when
those benefits are not asked for,
is no criteria for the required
membership in that organization.
We all derive benefits from many
organizations. These benefits are
in the form of lobbies which pro
tect our interests, or in the form
of charities, or in a multitude of
other forms.
Even though the organizations
behind these benefits may be a
"far greater force for good than
for evil" as attested by the ma
jority. we are not yet required to
belong to all of them. Perhaps we
cannot or do not care to support
them.
The choice is ours. The respon
sibility for that choice is ours.
Let us keep it that way.

Question of Ethics
Editor, The Daily:
I cannot let Nov. 4 roll around
without answering your Friday
editorial in which you espoused a
NO vote for Proposition 16. It
seems to me that your under
standing of the real issues involv
ed in this proposition is rather
hazy.
First of all, may I say that one
is very easily led astray by some
of the propaganda put out recent
ly by both those in favor of and
those against this measure. Thus
I maintain that both sides are
wrong in playing up the financial
side of this proposition. We can
not afford, especially in this day
and age. to put a price tag on the
value of education.
Proposition 16 was not put on
the ballot primarily to save the
public from paying "double taxes"
which are burdening them beyond
all reason, nor was it advanced to
impose "this unfair taxation on
certain undeserving parents who
merely wish to exercise their con
stitutional right to send their chil
dren to private schools," as some
sort of punishment or control
measure.
Taxation is not punishment; it
is payment for services rendered
by our government. It will be ad
mitted that both the public citi
zens and the private schools could
pay for these services (which you
admit amount to not more than
$1,175,000 annually) without any
undue hardships.
I challenge you to give evidence
that this tax "burden could close
some financially pressed private
schools, and others would take in
fewer children."
I know of some private grade
schools in the East Bay which
pride themselves in the fact that
they are completely self-support
ing and would welcome the op
portunity to pay their rightful
share of state taxes. I am certain
that most private schools would
not have to raise their tuition by
very much.
But the question is not one of
economics but of ethics!
Where does the responsibility
actually belong? The opponents
of this proposition ask, "Are not
the private schools rendering the
state a service by taking the
'340,000 children' out of the pub
lic schools and thereby relieving
the state of part of its obliga
tions."
The answer would be "yes" if
the schools were completely non
sectarian and non-profit. But since
over 90 per cent of the private
schools are under religious con
trol at the under-collegiate level,
and since religious organizations
are. beyond a doubt, big business,
I must contend that there is no
excuse for tax exemption.
The Constitution of the United
States explicitly avows church and
stale separation. The proposition
does not. as the editor so nobly
declares, "involve the right of re
ligious groups to maintain their
systems of belief"; it merely says
that they cannot call this "educa
tion" and then ask for tax exemp
tion.
The editor asks, "Why do the
proponents of Proposition 16 not
go further and move to tax pri
vate colleges and universities or
church-supported hospitals?" My
answer is it SHOULD go further
and insist that any institution
which compels its students to he
indoctrinated in a church's busi
ness should not be given any spe
cial exemptions on this account.

Phil Rogers, M.S. '58
Stand Surprising
Editor, The Daily:
I happened across a copy of the
California Machinists Press dated
Sept. 27, 1958, in which they
quoted a lead editorial of the Stan
ford Daily strongly recommend
ing a "no" vote on Proposition 18.
You state (according to the re
print i "There is little doubt as
the ultimate goal that advocators
of .R'ight-To-Work' laws seek.
That is the ultimate breakdown
of American labor unions. Those
who want to see a return to the
labor wars of the past, etc."
As vice chairman of the Glen
dale Committee FOR Proposition
18, I find your stand on this issue
surprising, or perhaps you are
parroting the teachings of some
of Stanford's more liberal theo
retical professors. I might ask
how many labor-management ne
gotiating sessions you have at
tended. how many leaders
you know, the conditions in
"open" shops, etc. To accuse the
many advocates of this issue of
forcing the "breakdown" of
unions is adolescent and asinine.
I would ask you how to make
unions responsive to their mem
bership. "Power tends to cor
rupt absolute power (compuls
ion! corrupts absolutely," and
fosters Ihe likes of Beck, Bridges,
I-loffa, Reuther and the many
others exposed by the McClellan
committee. Would you join a
Communist dominated union?
You would have to in order to
work for GE where represented
by the lUE. Want to join the
Teamsters so H of 112 a can steal
your dues, suppport political can
didates you don't approve of,
etc.?
There are thousands of "open"
shops operating peacefully and
satisfactorily in the country to
day, and the labor leaders are
much more sensitive to the
employees' needs than they are
in union shops where a man's
very livelihood depends on the
fact he toes the line or else.
I have dealt with a union in an
open shop for in years, and sin
cerely feel that unions must be
subject to checks and balances
just as any other organization.
I suggest as editor you stick to
something you might know some
thing about, such as what's
wrong with the football team.
