### A Review By E. Baumbach 
BRKAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S
l»y Truman Capote. Random
House, New York, 1958.. ($3.50.)
Truman Capote's latest collec
tion of short stories Breakfast at
Tiffany's is a brilliant and stylish
piece (if writing. Capote's ease of
language and marvelous fluency
give the four stories (one of
which is termed a novella by the
publishers» a certain typically
Capote magical quality. He cre
ates a world one approaches hes
itantly, preparing for the desper
ate mourning of his souls in
flight—fleeing from despair, from
maturity, from some nameless
cataclysmic defeat from which
there is no escape but no accept
ance either.
Although two of the stories are
what we might usually expect of
Capote, the title novella and the
shorter piece "House of Flowers"
do have a sense of vitality, of
real life, which one does not
usually associate with the gentle
charm of this expert craftsman.
Wild Child
Holly Golighty, whose ambition
is to have breakfast at Tiffany's
is a wild, beautiful child of the
country. She comes to New York
from Tulip, Texas where as the
14-year-old child bride of Doc
Golighty she yearned for the glit
ter of New York. Thin, chic, the
"ragbag colors of her boy's hair,
tawny streaks, strands of albino
blond and yellow" complementing
the pretty American wholesome
ness of her almost 19 years, Holly

becomes what is kindly known in
the tabloids as a "party girl."
She is one of those shadows who
pass through the gossip columns,
living and usually dying in a sort
of glamorous notoriety.
Rut Holliday Golighty (nee Lu
lamae Barnes) is different. "She I
isn't a phony because she's a real
phony. She believes all this crap |
she believes." She has a concept
of herself, a concept of freedom,
an imagination which allow her i
to live sordidly and yet remain I
shimmeringly untouched. Her!
corruption is a romantic one as j
was Gatsby's and, when she even
tually is literally run out of New
York to begin a career in Buenes |
Aires, we too hope with Capote ,
that she arrives "somewhere she
belongs."
Rhyl Inn in Story
There is the rhythm of New
York in this story, and always
Mr. Capote's splendid sense of
language <". . . a smile of rol/.'f
oiling his face"). But what is
missed in this and all of Capote's
work is a sense of what can be
called a larger reality. When
Isherwood wrote of another lost
girl, Sally Bowles, in his Berlin
Stories the fact of the ever-pres
ent swastika, the S. S. men in the
streets implied an imminent and
ominous sense of evil.
Sally is a symbol of Berlin in
the thirties and her real immor
ality is a portent. But what is
Holly or more important, why is
Holly? She exists, she's beautiful,
excitingly exists—as do all of Mr.
Capote's characters — but never

quite iti context with the world
we know. So it seems that ulti
mately we wonder does her ex
istence have any real import
ance?
Other Stories
The other two stories which
| make up this rather slim book
| are not quite as successful. One,
I set in a Southern prison camp
tells of a man serving a life term
who comes to love too well a
j Cuban boy who had eyes "like
j strips of the sky." The boy
| deserts him during a prison
| break leaving behind a guitar
set with glass diamonds and a
i dream of El Mundo the World.
The last is a fragile and touch
ing memoir of a boy (the
author?) and an elderly female
cousin who are each other's hesl
friend. Their separation by life,
by the forces of unreason, and by
the inevitable process of growing
up recreates artfully the übiqui
tous longing for some lost, never
to be recaptured, happy time of
one's childhood when all was
peace and all was innocent, and,
as in all Capote's work, innocence
was all.
