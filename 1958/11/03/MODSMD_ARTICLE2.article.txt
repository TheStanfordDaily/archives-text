"As far as we are concerned this is Poland's desire to improve
relations with the West. I am convinced that the situation will de
velop in that direction."
These observations summed up the evaluation of Poland's hopes
of trade with the West as expressed by Boleslaw Jas7xv.uk, vice-chair-

man of the planning commission
of I ho Council of Ministers of Po
land, head of a delegation of five
Polish governmtent leaders who
visited the campus Friday.
Answering questions through
U.S. State Department escort-in
terpreter Henryk Uznanski, Jas
zczuk explained that the $193 mil
lion in loans from the U.S. to Po
land in the form of agricultural
surpluses were "a significant fac
tor in aiding the economy. The
deliveries of grain and cotton per

mitted abolition of compulsory
deliveries |by Polish farmers| and
at the same time created indus
trial reserves."
Rudolf Heller, secretary of the
Polish Embassy in Washington,
D.C., stressed that the aid was in
the form of loans rather than
outright grants. "Poland is pay
ing (the U.S.| back by selling
goods . . . paying bpek at 4 ',••> per
I cent interest. |The loans) help to
i develop Poland's economy and
; trade relations," Heller concluded.
