# Iceland Dwells Between Worlds
## 
### 
Washingtonâ€”ln many respects
Iceland lives between two worlds,
the East and the West, the mod
ern and the medieval.
The islanders also live between
extremes of hot and cold. As its
name suggests, Iceland has an
abundance of ice, locked in enor
mous glaciers. But it is warmed
by water carried north from the
Gulf Stream, and bubbling there
are some of the hottest springs in
the world. The word geyser j
comes from the Icelandic.
Hot springs, heat homes in j
Reykjavik, capital of the coalless i
country. The springs also warm
hothouses where bananas, grapes,;
roses, and carnations grow.
The hot lava and smoke of
Mount Hekla, a periodically active
volcano, were regarded as proof
in medieval times of the existance
of hell.
The Kentucky-sized island re
public lies in the North Atlantic
Ocean midway between Scotland
and Greenland, the National Geo
graphic Society says. Geograp
hically it belongs to Europe and
was linked to Denmark until 1944.
Iceland belongs to the North !
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Though American forces guard
the Keflavik airport, the country
maintains close economic ties
with the Soviet Union.
Fish and fish produces have
always made up the bulk of Ice- j

land's exports. The banks off the
island are so rich in marine life
that travlers from Britain and
other countries come to fish
there. Disputes have periodically
arisen over fishing rights.
