# Cal Tightens Policy On Classroom Snooping
## 
### 
Faculty at the University of
California have cjecided not to
give any voluntary information to
the snoopings of the Government
and prospective employers about
the opinions expressed by their
students in classroom debates.
It seems government security
checks and employee investiga
tions have become so detailed in
the last few years that the exam
iners are looking right into the
classroom to a point where the
Academic Senate felt intellectual
discussion might be hindered.
Students, wary of their profes
sional future, might quickly be
come unwilling to express opin
ions on controversial subjects,
said a spokesman.
The decision came in the form
of a resolution by The Represen
tative Assembly of the Northern
Section, UC Academic Senate:
. . Reports by a teacher con
cerning the beliefs, attitudes, acti
vities and associations of a stu
dent regarding religion, politics
and public affairs in general are

not permissible. . ."
This would not apply when fac
ulty members were subpoenaed
as a witness, under oath.
