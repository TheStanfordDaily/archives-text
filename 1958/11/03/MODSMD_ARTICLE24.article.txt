# Non-Partisanship Avoids Pressures

### Leo Krulitz 
"Stanford can't permit any par
tisan political activity on campus
that promotes any political cause
or the election of any political
candidates," Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler said in an in
terview with The Daily.
With this as a base, Winbigler
outlined the position of the Stan
ford Political Union and the Stan
ford Area Young Democrats and
Republicans on the Stanford cam
pus.
Explaining the reason for this
policy, the dean said, "Stanford
expects to remain free from inter
ference by the state in the man
agement of its affairs as an inde
pendent educational institution.
Accordingly, it is fitting that the
University should refrain from
lobbying or other partisan activi
ties in behalf of causes or candi
dates."
Stay Off Campus
This means, he explained, that
the partisan clubs that are affili
ated with the state organizations
of the political parties must re
main off campus and may not
sponsor anything on campus ei
ther by themselves or as a co
sponsor with the Political Union.
He went on to say, "We are
very much interested in political
ideas and political education.
This means we are interested in
having speakers come to the cam
pus as a way of promoting politi
cal discussion."
This is the function of the Stan
ford Political Union.

Answering the question of just
how partisan a speaker brought
to campus by the Political Union
could be, Winbigler explained
that the Union has established a
broad base for a long-range pro
gram which is balanced.
Ample Room
He said, "Many shades of politi
cal thought are presented in an
atmosphere of impartial delibera
tion. With this framework there
is ample room for individual ex
pressions which are extremely
partisan, so long as the speaker
stops short of urging his audi
ence to vote for him."
"Because of the broad base of
this program we have been able
to have speakers like the Social
ist, Norman Thomas, Senator
William Knowland, Eleanor Roo
sevelt, Paul Butler and J. Bracken
Lee.
Winbigler also stated that it
wasn't administration policy that
an opposition speaker must ap
pear with every Political Union
speaker.
No Blocks
Clarifying further the position
of the Young Democrats and
Young Republicans, Winbigler
said. "The administration is not
trying to put any blocks in the
way of an individual's participa

tion in political parties."
The administration has been
working out a new policy toward
ihese organizations in regard to
their advertising on campus. The
objective is to allow the Young
Democrats and Young Republi
cans to advertise enough to ac
quaint the campus with their pro
grams.
The Stanford Elementary
School is theoretically off campus
while being located at the center
of the campus and acts as a com
promise point at which the parti
san clubs can hold their meetings.
At Cal, this year, university
policy was changed to permit po
litical speakers to come to cam
pus as long as arrangements

were made to present his oppo
nent or an equal ranking member
of the opposition party.
The University of Southern
California has permitted speak
ers to come to campus if invita
tions were made to their oppo
nents and if the speakers were
cleared through the ASSC Forum
Committee.
Officers of the Stanford Area
Young Democrats and Young Re
publicans may not hold offices in
the Stanford Political Union but
may be members. These three
groups last year signed an agxee

merit to co operate whenever pos
sible in the procurement of speak
ers and in promoting interest in
politics at Stanford.
