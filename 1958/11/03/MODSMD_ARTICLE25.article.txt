# Game's Last Try Ties Soccermen
## 
### 
With 10 seconds remaining in
the soccer game at Maloney Field
last Saturday, and the Stanford
varsity leading, 2-1, San Francisco
State's offensive star Stan Sars
field booted a goal to knot the
score and send the game into the
required two overtimes.
Neither team could break the
deadlock, and the game went into
the books as Stanford's first tie
in a season which has seen three
wins and but one loss.
Center forward Dick Bartlett
paced the Indian attack, scoring
both his team's goals. Coach Fred
Priddle also cited goalie Bill Ditt*
man and left fullback Don Farth
ing, a freshman, for outstanding
play. Besides Farthing, the var
sity includes four other frosh on
its starting eleven.
