## SPORT SCENE POST MORTEMS: Cactus Rates SC High; 'Plays' Leak No Factor 
### Russ Allen Dick Barnes 
"SC was one of the best teams
we've faced this season and they
gave our boys a good old country
licking," were the words of a re
signed Cactus Jack Curtice in the
locker room after the Cards' 29-6
loss to the Trojans.
Coach Curtice's familiar humor
was strangely missing from Sat
urday's post-game laik, although
he did remark that "we fumbled
three times before we really start
ed fumbling." He attributed llie
loss to these fumbles and injuries
to key players halfback John
Bond and center Roch Conklin
early in the game.
No Offensive Go
"In every game we've won our
offense has been working well
but today we never could get go
ing except for one drive in the
closing minutes in the first half,"
stated Curtice.
The Stanford mentor admitted
that the Indians were definitely
not up for the game with Ihe men
from Troy as they were for the
Uclans two Saturdays ago, but
was unable to put his finger on
any one cause for their flatness.
He did believe that the first-quar
ter 15-yard penalty for piling on
against the Cards certainly de
moralized the boys and gave the
Trojans their first score.
Burford Shines
The bright spot in the Trojan
loss was end Chris Burford's con
tinued top-notch playing. Burford
played 59 minutes and was sin
gled out by Curtice for his excel
lent performance on both offense
and defense. Fullback Doug Dick
and linemen Bob Peterson, Troy
Barbee and Eric Protiva were also
commended by the Card coach.
SC and Rice were deemed by
the Stanford coach the two tough
est teams which the Indians have
played so far this season.

No, the big leak of Stanford's
"secret" plays didn't have any ef
fect on USC preparat ions for Sat
urday's game against the Cards.
That's what Trojan coach Don
Clark said, among other things,
in his post - game comments on
Troy's 29-6 rout of the Indians.
"The story didn't come over till
Wednesday night, and by then
we're all through with new stuff,"
laughed Clark. "But we did talk
a bit about the shovel pass play,
since Curtice has used it in the
past, and since I'd seen him talk
a lot about it at coaches' clinics."
No Trojan Errors
Discussing the more pertinent
aspects of the game, Clark said it
was just a case of Troy making
no critical errors as it has done
in most of its games.
"It was a good game for us be
cause we got started early. . . .
We eliminated a lot of our mis
takes. . . . We've had long drives
all year, but most of them end
with a fumble."
Don Buford, the pint-sized half
back who gave Ihe Indian defense
fits, was singled out by Clark as
a Trojan who had his greatest
game. "He's not really fast, but
he's quick," smiled Clark.
Not All the Line
The Trojan mentor declined to
give his line the full credit for
proving the difference. "But they
opened up some good holes," he
added. "When it's well, end to
end, I wouldn't trade it for any
other line in the conference."
Despite the one - sided score,
Clark didn't see too dim a future
for the Indians. He said he could
sympathize with them fully after
seeing his team often make the
same errors that plagued the In
dians Saturday. "But throw out
the critical errors and you can't
count them out," was his optimis
tic parting shot for Stanford fans.

in his post - game comments on
Troy's 29-6 rout of the Indians.
"The story didn't come over till
Wednesday night, and by then
we're all through with new stuff,"
laughed Clark. "But we did talk
a bit about the shovel pass play,
since Curtice has used it in the
past, and since I'd seen him talk
a lot about it at coaches' clinics."
No Trojan Errors
Discussing the more pertinent
aspects of the game, Clark said it
was just a case of Troy making
no critical errors as it has done
in most of its games.
"It was a good game for us be
cause we got started early. . . .
We eliminated a lot of our mis
takes. . . . We've had long drives
all year, but most of them end
with a fumble."
Don Buford, the pint-sized half
back who gave Ihe Indian defense
fits, was singled out by Clark as
a Trojan who had his greatest
game. "He's not really fast, but
he's quick," smiled Clark.
Not All the Line
The Trojan mentor declined to
give his line the full credit for
proving the difference. "But they
opened up some good holes," he
added. "When it's well, end to
end, I wouldn't trade it for any
other line in the conference."
Despite the one - sided score,
Clark didn't see too dim a future
for the Indians. He said he could
sympathize with them fully after
seeing his team often make the
same errors that plagued the In
dians Saturday. "But throw out
the critical errors and you can't
count them out," was his optimis
tic parting shot for Stanford fans.

"SC was one of the best teams
we've faced this season and they
gave our boys a good old country
licking," were the words of a re
signed Cactus Jack Curtice in the
locker room after the Cards' 29-6
loss to the Trojans.
Coach Curtice's familiar humor
was strangely missing from Sat
urday's post-game laik, although
he did remark that "we fumbled
three times before we really start
ed fumbling." He attributed llie
loss to these fumbles and injuries
to key players halfback John
Bond and center Roch Conklin
early in the game.
No Offensive Go
"In every game we've won our
offense has been working well
but today we never could get go
ing except for one drive in the
closing minutes in the first half,"
stated Curtice.
The Stanford mentor admitted
that the Indians were definitely
not up for the game with Ihe men
from Troy as they were for the
Uclans two Saturdays ago, but
was unable to put his finger on
any one cause for their flatness.
He did believe that the first-quar
ter 15-yard penalty for piling on
against the Cards certainly de
moralized the boys and gave the
Trojans their first score.
Burford Shines
The bright spot in the Trojan
loss was end Chris Burford's con
tinued top-notch playing. Burford
played 59 minutes and was sin
gled out by Curtice for his excel
lent performance on both offense
and defense. Fullback Doug Dick
and linemen Bob Peterson, Troy
Barbee and Eric Protiva were also
commended by the Card coach.
SC and Rice were deemed by
the Stanford coach the two tough
est teams which the Indians have
played so far this season.

No, the big leak of Stanford's
"secret" plays didn't have any ef
fect on USC preparat ions for Sat
urday's game against the Cards.
That's what Trojan coach Don
Clark said, among other things,
