# Trobabes Get Inspired; Rally Sinks Frosh, 14-6
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
Anyone who doubts that a tra
dition can help a team win a foot
hall game had better stay far
away from the Southern Califor
nia freshman football coach, Mar
vin Goux.
SC beat the Stanford frosh 14
to (> Saturday when, after spend
ing most of the first half giving
the ball to the Indian freshmen
inside their own 30-yard line, they
came out after the halftime inter
mission a changed team whose
only mission in life seemed to be
to win a football game. This
change is attributed by Coach
Goux to a t radii ion.
"Our boys had to prove them
selves," Goux said. "At SC we
don'l consider ourselves Trojans
until we win. I was able to im
press them with this between
halves and they just went out and
played football like they wanted
to win."
Many Trojan Hobbles
During the first half it did look
very much as though SC was in
terested in handing the game to
Stanford on that proverbial plat
ter. SC ball carriers fumbled nine
times during the game, six of
which were recovered by Indians.
Four times in the first half alone
Trobabe backs lost the ball inside
their own 30.
One of these turned into a Pa
poose touchdown as Bob Draku
lich recovered a bobble by SC full
back Jerry Mollet on the SC 30.
A pass from Jim Smith to Marl in
Walling put the ball on the 17 and
six plays later fullback Bill Kuhn
smashed over from the two for
the Card score.
The Indian frosh dominated the
first half completely, hut the
Trojan yearlings' defense always
seemed to stiffen at the right
time and they prevented any fur
ther' Stanford scoring.
During the second half, how
ever', the story was all SC. Start
ing halfbacks John Chisdak and
Jim Maples and their subs Alan
Shields and Lynn Gaskill led the
SC team to their amazing come
back.
Quick Score
Midway through the third quar
ter SU halfback Jim Smail recov
ered another Trojan fumble on
the Stanford two-yard line. The
Trojan defense held Stan Lind
skog and Kuhn to eight yards in
three plays and Lindskog was
forced to kick. His boot was taken
by Jim Maples who twisted
Ihrough to the Stanford 17-yard

line before he was tripped up by
Chris Cottle. On the first play
from scrimmage Maples ad
vanced the ball to the six and on
the next try Gaskjll romped over
for the score. The try for point
was blocked as Cottle broke
through to block Chisdak's kick.
Early in • the final stanza SC
quarterback Willie Garcia inter
cepted a Jim Smith pass to give
SC the ball on their own 44. Three
first downs and nine plays later
Shields scored from 14 yards out.
Clutch Save
The visitor's very nearly scored
again when with a fourth and j
two situation on the SU nine-yard
line, Dick Cook broke through the
Trojan forward wall to dump Ma
ples for a yard loss. Stanford was
inside the visitors' 40-yard line
only once in the final quarter and
after the final SC score, with over ■
nine minutes left in the game,
never' threatened.
The SC team, which was able to !

eke out only one first down and
about 50 yards offensively during
the first half, ended up with nine
first downs (two less than the In
dians i and 281 yards total offense.
Of these yards 245 were gained on
the ground.
This compares with a total of
115 net yards for the Indians. 91
of which were gained passing.
Stanford frosh coach Homer
Smith is still very optimistic
about his team's chances in fu
ture games.
"We sputtered offensively all
day. We are sure we know what
j is wrong and we are confident
that we can fix it. We proved
that we are a good team and as
long as we play as well defensive
ly as we did during the first half
I will be very happy."
"We will make some minor
changes this week and work on
blocking techniques and defen
sive pursuits," he added. "We will
I he better 1 this week."
