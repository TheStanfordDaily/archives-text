Kapp Doesn't Star
Quarterback Joe Kapp filially
was the goat as OSC eked out its
triumph over Cal. Two intercep
tions of Kapp passes paved t he
way for the Beaver triumph a
coach Tommy Prothro preserved
his record of never losing a game
at home.
Cal drove 56 yards to score, the
first time it got the ball, and, al
though the Bears generated good
offense around midfield, they
couldn't push over another count
er. OSC struck back in the second
period when center Doug Bashor
intercepted a Kapp aerial and
streaked 33 yards to score un
touched.
In the third period, another in
terception started the Beavers on
the drive 1o the clinching TD.
Tailback Paul Lowe sped 8 yards
for the crusher.
Big Point Total
Only Michigan had ever scored
more points against UCLA in the
past 15 years than the Cougars
picked up Saturday in romping to
their parting-shot win. While star
quarterback Bob Newman watch
ed from the sidelines, WSC ex
ploded for all kinds of scores.
QB Dave Wilson passed for two
TD's and halfbacks Keith Lincoln
and Mike Agee one each as the
Cougars kept their flickering Pas
adena hopes alive. Another WSC
marker came on an 83-yard kick
off return by Chuck Morrell.
A 37-yard romp with a screen
pass by halfback Luther Carr
spelled the doom of Oregon's fad
