## 
### 
Six Stanford runners combined
for the greatest team race in local
cross-country history to give the
Indians their first-ever victory
over USC Saturday on the Stan
ford golf course.
Final score of the quadrangular
meet was Stanford 19, California
19, USC 56 and San Jose State 64.
in dual meet scoring, it was Stan
ford over the Trojans 26-31; Cal
>ver the Cards 27-28; and the In
dians over San Jose 24-33.
But the big story was the de
feat of USC, perenially among
he strongest running powers in
he United States. To Cal, also,
must go a full measure of credit
for emerging from the underdog
ole to beat the Trojans.
New Course Record
II wasn't Max Truex' fault that
Troy lost. Me whipped over the
four-mile course in 20:56 to heal
Keith Wallace's old course record
by a full 30 seconds.

Truex and the Indians' Wallace
ran together almost he entire way
before Truex pulled out in the
final half-mile. Wallace led by a
stride over most of the first mile,
hen the two alternated the lead
ieveral times.
Truex let Wallace hold the first
spot coming off the midway hill,
and the Indian stayeel on top as
he two passed the three-mile
post.
Finishing Burst
But Truex whipped into a short
lead, then quickly widened it to
20 yards as the pair swung
iround the final long curve be
fore breaking for home.
Truex breezed home wiih his
â€¢tew record, beating Wallace by
13 seconds.
Doug Martin, Bob Monzingo
and John Northway were the trio
who really won the race for Stan
ford. They all beat strongly fa
vored Troajn runners, finishing
seventh,-ninth and tenth respec
tively with brilliant clockings of
21:50, 21:55 and 21:58. Al Ahu
mada was 21st and Kim Maxwell
22nd, but they were far enough

i up to give the Indians their defeat
I of USC.
Martin, Monzingo and North
way ran within a few strides of
each other almost the entire dis
tance. Back as far as 11th during
the middle stages of the run, they
all picked off maroon-shirted Tro
jans during the long stretch dash.
Halfway through the race, it
looked like USC would score
around 39 points, with the others
all in the fifties. But all the Tro
jans except Truex lost ground to
Indians and Bears in the final two
miles, and that spelled defeat.
