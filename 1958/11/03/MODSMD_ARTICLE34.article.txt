# Employment Office List Helps Jobless Students
## 
### Bonnie Culhane 
Do you need money? The an
swer is obviously "yes" for most
college students. Yet many excel
lent opportunities to bring in a
few extra shekels are being com
pletely ignored by Stanfordites.
The Student Employment Of
fice, a division of the Placement
Service, was designed to help
Stanford students find perma
nent part - time employment or
just occasional odd jobs. Prospec
tive employers in the Stanford
area call in and list kinds of jobs
available, hourly wages, and
amount of work needed. Then
students may check through the
available jobs and apply for those
in which they are interested.
Range Varies
The range of jobs is extremely
wide and varied. There is any
thing from general housework or
yard work to architectural drafts
man, lab technician, TV repair
man, or dance instructor.
Some of the more unusual op
portunities are the following:
ST.SO an hour for a girl who
would be willing to model in bath
ing suit for a camera club, calis
thenics instructor, official for in
tramural touch football, ice skate
guard. There are all kinds of sell
ing, delivery, carpentry, painting
and other jobs.
Baby Sitters
Special lists are kept of stu
dents who wish to do babysitting
and tutoring, and prospective em
ployers are referred to these lists.
In short, there should be some
type of work to suit anyone.
The Student Employment Of
fice also offers opportunities for
summer and Christmas vacation
employment, with chances not
limited strictly to this area but
covering several states. In addi
tion, there are chances to work
for room or board or both.
The amazing thing, according
to Mrs. Barbara Cochran, head of
this service, is that there are no
applicants for a large number of
the jobs. Last year, for instance,
there were 4324 job openings and
only 3090 of them were filled.
Mrs. Cochran states that perhaps
students do not check with the
service often enough to catch the

jobs they arc interested in or else
they just do not know of the op
portunities that exist.
