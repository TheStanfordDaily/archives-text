## 'Just Being Acceptable Not Enough' 
### 
There is a vast difference be
tween being acceptable with God
and having a real Christian ex
perience. emphasized Canon Bry
an Green in his sermon Sunday at
Memorial Church.
Speaking to a near • capacity
| crowd, the Birmingham, England,
rector used a text from Acts 10,
in accordance with All Saints Day.
The scripture tells how Cornelius,
a Roman soldier, became a Chris
tian and received the Holy Spirit.
Canon Green applied the same six
qualities that Cornelius exhibited
to Christians today:
He feared God, prayed, was
practical and sincere, held a good
! reputation and wanted to know
more about God.
Not Being Saved
But being acceptable with God
is not being "saved," he stated.
"You can bo all that Cornelius
was and not have a Christian ex
perience until Jesus Christ is
within you."
Asked at the coffee hour follow
ing the service how he enjoyed
being a rector compared with be
ing a college chaplain. Canon
Green replied, "The danger in be
ing a chaplain is that he only sees
one fraction of life; he does not
have the opportunity to live life.
"I was at Oxford for three and
a half years—quite enough!" he
added.
Canon Green described the
! youth center in "the worst part of
| Birmingham." of which he has
been in charge for about five
years.
Rock and Roll
"The assistant priests must all
learn to rock and roll," he smiled,
describing the ways in which the
teen-agers are being approached
and the success that the center is
having.
In reply to a question regarding
religious trends in America, Can
on Green stated that "America
has a much greater sense of God."
He emphasized that America
I must learn from the mistakes of
England; that the American peo
ple must read history ("and not
.just a Western Civ text -that's
1 too distorted and subjective") and
go "deeper" than England.
The dynamic clergyman, who
arrived in the United States three
days ago, spoke at San Francisco's
Grace Cathedral Sunday after
noon and tf) students at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium last night.
