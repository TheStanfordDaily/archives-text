# Possum Leads Lively Race
## 
### 
Shades of the Deep South -
it's possum-hunting time.
That's what the men of Stern
Mall decided early Sunday
morning when a grey intruder
wandered into wing two.
As the possum scampered
through the halls of wing two
and finally into wing one, an
ever-growing crowd of howling
students took up pursuit.
The posss u m was finally
"treed" in a wing one telephone
booth.
