# SC Ruins Homecoming; Tops Sputtering Indians
## 
### John Schwarz 
Stanford's 29 (5 loss to (JSC Saturday did not eliminate the Indians
from the Rose Bowl competition (thanks to Oregon State), hut one
couldn't very well call it a good omen.
It was the same old story so far as Stanford was concerned too
many Ihird-and seven situations and an over-abundance of fumbles

deep in their own territory.
The Cards fumbled the ball
three limes within their own 40-
yard line, and all three times USC
men recovered, with the Trojans
going on to score on two of these
three occasions.
Garher Hobbles
The first Stanford fumble came
on the second offensive play that
the Tribe attempted, when stall
ing quarterback Sid Garber had
trouble holding a pass from cen
ter. SC players immediately plow
ed through the line, with big Dan
Fieea pouncing on the loose ball
on the Stanford 39-yard line.
Twelve plays later llillard Hill,
SC's end-halfback, rolled over
right guard for 3 yards find (JSC's
first of four touchdowns.
Midway through this 39-yard
drive, the Indians had an excel
lent chance to hold when Stan
ford's D o u g P u r s e 11 knifed
through the SC line to nail quar
terback Willie Wood for a 5-yard
loss back to the Stanford 30-yard
line, setting up a fourth-and 12 sit
uation. However, the Cards were
called for piling on, and the b;dl
moved back to the Stanford 15,
giving SC a first-and-10 situation.
Second Eumb'e
The second Stanford fumble
came four plays after SC kicked
off following their second touch
down. The Indians' Gil Dowd, in
for the first time since he was in
jured against Washington, got
mixed up in taking a Bob Nieolet
hand-off, and the Trojans took
over on Stanford's 37.
From there the Trojans moved
quickly and in five plays had an
other touchdown. After Don Za
chik, a place kicker imported all
the way from Linden, N.J., kicked
his third straight conversion, the
Trojans jumped into a lopsided
21-0 lead.
USC put the game on ice when
they blocked a Stanford punt
early in the third quarter and
trapped Nicolet, who recovered
the loose kick, in the end zone
for a safety and a 23-6 lead.
Fans Leave Early
From then on. Stanford could
do nothing, and the biggest high
light of the third quarter, in some
people's minds, was when a por
tion of the 52,000 attending began
to head for the exits with still
more than four minutes left in
that quarter.
Before the game began, all the
SC publicity was going to two
backs - one named Willie Wood
and the other named Angie Coia.
The reports were that it these two
couldn't play, USC, more than
likely, would be sunk. Oddly
enough, it wasn't so much these
two who hurt the Indians Satur
day afternoon; it was their under
studies, Tom Maudlin and Don
Buford, who caused most of the
trouble.
Buford, a little, 5-5, 154-pound
ball of greased lightning, ran wild
most of the afternoon. Ho led all
Ihe rushers, gaining 91 yards on
14 carries for a 6.5 average, and
included in his dashes one neatly
executed 25-yard touchdown run.
Tricky Quarterback
Maudlin. USC's second - string
quarterback, ruined the Stanford
defense by continually running an
option play in which he lateraled
back to one of his halfbacks as
soon as the first tackier grabbed
him. On this one play alone Maud
lin rolled up 39 yards rushing.
Besides his line running, he con
nected on a beautiful 24-yard
touchdown pass to Hill.
Stanford's lone touchdown of
the afternoon came near the end
of the second quarter on a very
effective 75-yard drive, in which
quarterback Nicolet did some fine
passing. The big gainer in this
drive was a screen pass which
Nicolet threw once to halfback
Skip Face for 12 yards and threw
twice to JC transfer Bill Donohue

for 10 and 14 yards. The climax
of the touchdown march came
when Nicolet flipped a shovel pass
to Face, and the San Marino lad
ran the 7 remaining yards to pay
dirt.
Sorry Afternoon
It was a very sorry afternoon
for Stanford in almost aJI depart
ments, for not only did they lose
the game; they also found them
selves once again confronted with
their old trouble of not being able
to move the ball on offense with
any consistency. Time after time
the Red team would reach a third
down situation in which they
would need 5 or more yards to
make a first down.
Not having a running play on
which to depend occasionally in
this situation, the Indians were
always forced to go to the air. For
a while it worked, but it was not
long before USC could sense the
Indians' passing plays and easily
squelched them.
Bad Day for Garber
On top of this, Sid Garber, who
looked like the answer to an of
fensive prayer when he ran so
well against UCLA, had a misera
ble afternoon, finishing up with a
net total (>f â€”2 yards rushing.
Stanford's only real solace from
the game was the individual per

formances turned in by three of
the team's personnel old, relia
ble Chris Burford, fullback Doug
Dick and center Pursell.
Burford played about 59 min
utes, and this marked the seventh
game in which he's played at least
that much.
