# SC Ruins Homecoming; Tops Sputtering Indians
## 
### John Schwarz 
Stanford's 29 (5 loss to (JSC Saturday did not eliminate the Indians
from the Rose Bowl competition (thanks to Oregon State), hut one
couldn't very well call it a good omen.
It was the same old story so far as Stanford was concerned too
many Ihird-and seven situations and an over-abundance of fumbles

deep in their own territory.
The Cards fumbled the ball
three limes within their own 40-
yard line, and all three times USC
men recovered, with the Trojans
going on to score on two of these
three occasions.
Garher Hobbles
The first Stanford fumble came
on the second offensive play that
the Tribe attempted, when stall
ing quarterback Sid Garber had
trouble holding a pass from cen
ter. SC players immediately plow
ed through the line, with big Dan
Fieea pouncing on the loose ball
on the Stanford 39-yard line.
Twelve plays later llillard Hill,
SC's end-halfback, rolled over
right guard for 3 yards find (JSC's
first of four touchdowns.
Midway through this 39-yard
drive, the Indians had an excel
lent chance to hold when Stan
ford's D o u g P u r s e 11 knifed
through the SC line to nail quar
terback Willie Wood for a 5-yard
loss back to the Stanford 30-yard
line, setting up a fourth-and 12 sit
uation. However, the Cards were
called for piling on, and the b;dl
moved back to the Stanford 15,
giving SC a first-and-10 situation.
Second Eumb'e
The second Stanford fumble
came four plays after SC kicked
off following their second touch
down. The Indians' Gil Dowd, in
for the first time since he was in
jured against Washington, got
mixed up in taking a Bob Nieolet
