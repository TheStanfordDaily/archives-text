# Kingston Trio Fills Pavilion
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
There was hardly room for the Kingston Trio in the Pavilion Mon
day night—the receptive, foot-tapping audience swarmed through the
aisles and over the scoreboard. But the famed threesome did fit and
had no trouble silencing the 3600-plus crowd with such well-known
songs as "Tom Dooley," "Hard, Ain't It Hard" and new arrangements

of such numbers as "Wimoway"
and "Merry Minuet."
In an interview afterward,
Stanford alum Dave Guard told
how he and Bob Shane and Nick
Reynolds, when the latter two
were at Menlo JC, had started
singing together in such local bis
tros as Mama's and the Cracked
Pot. Their first "pro" engage
ment was at the Purple Onion in
1957, and the resulting success is
well known.
Now on a whirlwind tour ("Wy
oming yesterday, tomorrow to
Los Angeles for the Milton Berle
show on the 19th" t.
The triumvirate has a second
record scheduled for release in
January, 1959, which includes
more folk songs and calypso.
"We hope to go into more jazz
type arrangements later," Guard
said.
