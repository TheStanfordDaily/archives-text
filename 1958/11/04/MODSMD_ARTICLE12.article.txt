# FORMOSA STRAIT
## Chinese Communist Guns Reopen Fire on Quemoy 
### 
TAIPEI (/P)—Communist big guns suddenly pounded Quemoy and
the Tan islets Monday with one of the heaviest bombardments of the
Formosa Strait war.
Red artillery on three sides thundered into action after weeks of
unofficial cease-fire, sporadic firing and lulls. The Nationalist De-

fense Ministry said its count
showed 36,432 shells poured on
the Nationalist outposts in six
hours.
The bombardment, most in
tense in seven weeks, was in re
sponse to Nationalist China's first
defiance of a Peiping warning
against resupplying the islands
on odd-numbered days.
One-fourth, or about 9500, of
the Communist shells hit the Tan
islets, rocky Nationalist outposts
between Quemoy, Little Quemoy
and Communist territory. Ameri
can military officials say Quemoy
is now virtually impregnable to
successful sea invasion, but that
the Reds—if they were willing to
pay a heavy price—might be able
to seize one or both of the smaller
islets, Tatan and Ehrtan.
Stop-Go Warfare
Last Oct. 25, Red China's Pei
ping radio issued a proclamation
of stop-go warfare virtually un
precedented in military history. It
invited the Nationalists to "turn
from foe into friend" and resup
ply the offshore islands on even
numbered days—but warned not
to send in ships or planes on odd
numbered days.
Rough waters in Formosa
Strait kept the Nationalists from
putting the unusual statement to
a test until Sunday—an even date.
Nationalist ships beached tons of
supplies at Quemoy without a
shot being fired at the beaches.
Naval sources said the Nation
alists, desiring to take advantage
of rare smooth seas, sent another
convoy in Monday, an odd day.
38-Hour Silence
Breaking a 38 - hour silence,
Communist guns hit the islands
hard. Nationalist artillery, rein
forced and resupplied with am
munition during the long slack
period, returned the fire. The De
fense Ministry said 15 Commu
nist guns and two ammunition de
pots were destroyed. The bom
bardments subsided into occa
sional exchanges after 6 p.m.
