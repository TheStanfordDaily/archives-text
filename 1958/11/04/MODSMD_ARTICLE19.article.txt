# Disappointment

It woi i.d si:i:m that Homecoming *houhl he one <»112 llie ni<»st
fesl ive activities of I In* foot ha 11 season : seconi I only to Bl(; (iAME
itself. This is how it seems, hut tliis is not how it was.
Iloniecoming this vear was the most disappointing "special
football week end we have ever seen at Stanford. Perhaps it was
cspeciall\ disappointing because we lost Saturday s loothall game,
hnl this is the last of man) events which culminate in an over-all
impression of having missed something.
If e do not fool wo can criticize llie team; we know
that they played the best game they could, that tliey
wanted to win but couldn't. We do feel, however, that
others who wore responsible for Homecoming (u til ities
did not do <dl they could have done to make Homecoming
the festive weekend it should have been.
It should he pointed out that countless hours were spent in
preparation for last week end. But we do not feel we can retrain
from saving that much of this energy was mischanneled.
I loniecoming, despite all this eflort, was a disappointing I ailure.
\\ hoever planned the Frost rally Friday night missed the boat
and, we might add, left some 2.>o<) people standing on the dock.
A higlih -spirited crowd assembled for Friday night's festivities,
and it began to look like one of the best rallies of recent years.
Bui despite thf potential it failed.
Rallies are designed tit incite spirit — or should be.
This seemed to be a great hose designed to douse any fire
being kindled.
The program was too short, too unimaginative, too unnecessary.
\\ luit little hit of entertainment was presented was good, but it
wasn I enough. A rally With only one fight song, only one yell, no
jokes and no attempt to create happy mood is a had rally.
The 2500 people were waiting to yell —to actively participate
in the rally, rather than sit back and watch the show but the
rally was planned chiefly as a program with little encouragement
given for participation by those attending.
lint this past week end's disappointment doesn't end
with Friday night's rally. It goes on through Saturday
morning's Row program.
Again, an unimaginative program cannot be expected to hold
interest for too long: this was, and it didn't. What had been so
long in the planning turned out to he so makeshift in appearance;
it was a shame to have spent so much time and energ\ on it only
to have given up in the middle.
(>ut* impression is simply that, despite all the eflort put into
Homecoming this year, a very unthorongh job was done. Perhaps
in Irving to get away from the "old style of rallies, those in com
mand went too far —too far in that they didn't sound out a general
impression before going ahead with their personalized views.
May we suggest that we not be given this type of program in
the future? We've gone along with the experiment this year —
much to our dismav —and we're all set to go back to the razzle
dazzle air that be lon us at any rally anywhere.
