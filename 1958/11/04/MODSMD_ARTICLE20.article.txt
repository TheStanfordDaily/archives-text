# PRESIDENT'S REPORT
## Need Awareness 
### John Bohn ASSU President 
Unless the members of the
ASSU administration are made
aware of the desire and interests
of the student body, we cannot
hope to execute these desires to
your satisfaction.
Next Monday at 5 p.m. the Cabi
net will convene for its first meet
ing. Its membership includes the
presidents of the undergraduate
classes, a representative of the
graduate students, the chairmen
of Men's Council and Women's
Council, the president of the Inter
fraternity Council, the president
of the Inter-Club Council and the
editor of The Stanford Daily.
There has been much criticism
of the effectiveness of this advis
ory agency, and indeed much of it
has been justified. But it is up
to the students to communicate
th e i r suggestions for improve
ment in student government, in
the quality of rallies, ASSU-spon
sored entertainment, or any other
such matter to these representa
tives so that they and the Legis
lature may act intelligently.
Athletic Awards
On a different level, the pro
poser! athletic awards program is
in its final stage of revision and
should lie ready for consideration
next week. Crew Association has
presented its proposals for status

which have been incorporated in
the new structure.
There are a few additional mi
nor changes which the athletic de
partment wishes to make in the
actual awards, and these are to be
submitted early next week.
You will be glad to learn also.
I think, that the Axe will go on
display in The Cellar some time
this week, bailing unforeseen ad
ministrative adversities.
Adverse Comments
Turning to a more serious note
for a minute. I have heard many
adverse comments on the conduct
of the students last Saturday in
leaving the rooting section before
the game was over. Most of these
comments, it is true, came from
alumni, who recall their days "on
The Farm."
One cannot exactly call it a duty
or even a responsibility to stay in
the rooting section until the game
is over, but Stanford enjoys an
enviable reputation for good
sportsmanship and loyalty among
the universities which students
at other colleges and universities
often degrade, but which they all
seek to engender on their own
campuses.
Each week I receive letters re
questing information on how to
promote this loyally on different
campuses throughout the country.
My answer is: such loyally is part
of the Stanford tradition, win or
lose.
