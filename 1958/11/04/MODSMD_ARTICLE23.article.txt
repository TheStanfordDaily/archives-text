What Happened?
Editor, Tht* Daily:
What happened to the Stanford
cheer leaders, band and many of
the student body in the second
half Saturday—especially in the
third quarter?
Your loyal fans who buy season
tickets and occupy a section near
est the opposition were much em
barrassed when the exodus of co
eds began early in the third. It
was very noticeable from our side
and the USC leaders bade every
one of you good-bye. They—as
well as we—wondered why the
cheer leaders could not even be
•seen; why the band did not play
until almost the end of the game.
Alumni and parents (of which
I'm one) are used to staying to
the sometimes bitter end. Can't
the young set us an example?

We Protest!
Editor, The Daily:
Why didn't some of the players
drop out of play in the third quar
ter of today's |Saturday's] game?
Is it because there's a rule? Or is
it because it's a player's respon
sibility to continue playing the
game? Is there a remote possi
bility that it has anything to do
with school spirit or sportsman
ship?
Whatever the answer, do not
students have the same responsi
bility? The same rule? The same
school spirit? The same sports
manship?
It is appalling for alumni to sit
through game after game with
the Stanford rooting section fall
ing apart. Al the first game of
the season we thought perhaps
the new students had not been
briefed in good, basic student con
duct. But after today's perform
ance, with a goodly number of
students marching out to the
chant of USC's cheer ("What is
this—an exodus?"), we protest!
Certainly students should not
be forced to attend football games
any more than they are forced to
play the game. But, once in the
rooters' section, let's keep them
there.

Future Change
Editor, The Daily:
In your Oct. 29 editorial you de
scribe the office of attorney gen
eral as traditionally nonpartisan.
This situation seems quite likely
to change in the future.
For years the highest ranking
Democrat in state affair-s held the
office of attorney general. This
individual is now running for gov
ernor. Without a doubt, his popu
larity and notoriety have been
gained through performing the
duties of attorney general. This
position could well be envisioned
as a springboard to higher of
fices, if Pat Brown is elected lo
the governorship.
As political parties recognize
the value of (his office, the danger
of our candidates being inferior
but popular will increase. Per
haps some constitutional qualifi
cations should be set forth.
