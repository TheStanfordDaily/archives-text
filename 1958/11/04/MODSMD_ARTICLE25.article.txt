# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Rockefeller Seen Likely For New York Governor 
### Leo Krulitz 
American voters today will de
termine not only who controls
Congress and by how much for
the next two years, but they will
also give their last official hints
as to who will be sitting at the
White House desk in 1961.
Some contenders for that high
office will be eliminated today,
and results of this election will be
evaluated and re-evaluated by pol
iticians and the people until the
conventions in '60.
Political Debut
Nelson Rockefeller is one to
watch as a victory, it is said,
would make him a formidable
contender for the Republican
nomination in '60. He is making
his political debut in a race
against Democrat Averell Hani
man for the governor's chair that
Harriman holds. If elected, Rocke
feller would control New York's
convention delegation.
Thirty or 40 years- ago, the
thought thai a Rockefeller
could win a political election
would have appeared a jokeâ€”
as an heir to a fortune which is
presently valued at more than
a billion dollars made in the
"robber baron" era.
But that was many years ago;
philanthropy and a genuine inter
est in humanitarian matters have
clouded the memory. Besides,
Rockefeller's opponent is hardly
a pauper.
(onservat ive Position
It has been hard in this New
York race to say which candidate
represents a conservative posi
tion. Normally this would be the
Republican, a good case can
be made for the proposition that
Harriman is the conservative
alongside the liberal views Rocke
feller has expressed.
A defeat today would mean the
end of a political career for Harri
man. Already 66 and a contender
for the Democratic nomination
for President in 1956, Harriman
would have to score a substantial
victory in this election to over
come the age barrier that might
block him from the nomination
in '60.
Rockefeller would be free to

try again, and a defeat for liini
in (his midterm year wouldn't
mean as much.
Across the Great Lakes in
Michigan, G. Mcnnen Williams, a
man mentioned often for the
Democratic nod in '60, is running
for his sixth term as governor.
While his re-election appears cer
tain. the plurality will be impor
tant.
Symington's Position
Senator Stuart Symington's po
sition is similar. He has little op
position today, but the si/.e of his
victory when compared to the
pluralities of the other contenders
for the Democratic Presidential
nomination may be a significant
factor.
One of the current leading
contenders, Senator John Ken
nedy of .Massachusetts, appears
certain of victory over his oppo
nent, Vincent Celeste.
The effect the outcome of this
election will have on Vice-Presi
dent Nixon's Presidential poten
tiality is a little hard to ascertain.
A defeat of William Knowland
would remove the Senator from
the race for the Republican nom
ination in '60, but it would also
leave Nixon the head of a Republi
can delegation that represented a
minority of the California voters.
The question would then be asked
whether or not Nixon could even
carry his own state because he
had actively campaigned for
Knowland to no avail.
"Right-to Work"
Four Western states have
"right-to-work" measures on their

ballots today: Washington, Idaho,
California and Colorado. In addi
tion the voters in Kansas and
Ohio will vote either yes or no
on this same issue.
The results of these contests
will indicate what labor can ex
pect in future elections, for if the
measure passes in such industrial
states as California and Ohio and
in agricultural states like Idaho
and Kansas, chances are these
measures will be present on the
ballots in many more states in
1960.
The majority of the present
"right-to-work" states are located
in the South.
Predicting the Outcome
The writer will go along with
the majority and predict a Demo
cratic sweep in the California
elections. The high percentage of
voters expected at the polls en
hances Democratic possibilities
with registration figures favoring
them 3-2.
We see Judge Stanley Mosk
winning the Attorney General
ship over Pat Hillings' by near
ly as large a margin as I'al
Brown will roll up over William
Knowland in the Governor's
race.
The closest races will be for the
financial offices of Treasurer and
Controller where Bert Beits and
Alan Cranston will squeak past
the incumbents, A. Ronald Button
and Robert Kirkwood.
Propositions 1(5, 17 and 18 will
all be defeated IS by not much
more lhan 100,000 votes.
