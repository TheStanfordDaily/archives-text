# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
A Long Fime Coming
It's been a long time since there's been a happier moment in Stan
ford running sports lhan Saturday, when Payton Jordan's* harriers
upset Southern California. The occasion was marred just a bit by
California's tying the Cards, but to Stanford minds, this was far sub
ordinate to at last beating USC on the ground.
To refresh any short memories, the Tribe and Cal tier! in quad
rangular scoring with '19 points, while SC had 56 and Sail Jose had G4.
Dual-wise, it was Stanford 20, SC 31.
Jordan summed up his elation at the upset victory by calling it
"(lie best team effort, Imlli mental and physical, since I've been asso
ciated with Stanford." And considering recent fortunes of Stanford
track and cross-country, it's probably the best team showing in a
Jot more than just the two-plus years that Jordan has been here.
The win was in every sense of the word a team effort. Keith Wal
lace, Doug Martin, Hob Monzingo, John Northway, AI Aluimaila and
Kim Maxwell all ran good races- they had to for the Indians to win.
Wallace, of course, was at the fore fighting with Truex all the way.
But .Martin, Monzingo and Northway were the trio who stuck
right together through the entire four miles, picking off Trojans as
a unit. The unit running made it plenty difficult for anyone else to
pass the 1 Cards and they didn't.
Halfway through the race, most of the Trojans were well up
among the first dozen, and they looked on their way to an easy
triumph. But on the midway hill, Stanford's team running paid off
as Troy faded.
Jordan said he hoped the surprise win would prove that some
hard work and dedication can produce a victorious effort. In track
or cross-country, there hasn't been a unified effort close to the pres
ent one in years and there aren't many teams in any other sports
that can claim anything near it recently, either.
Now ihe one thing that must be guarded against is overconfldence
or complacency. The examples set by previous Indian teams in a
variety of sports testify to he dangers of sitting on laurels. If the
present cross-country septet can keep on its toes even after a sweet
win, they'll he setting an example that plenty of other teams and
athletes around here would do well to follow.
Bright Prospects for Spring, Too
From early fall, indications, the spring track season may be just
as pleasant as the cross-country season is turning out to be.
Jordan and his assistant, Jim Terrill, have instituted a split prac
tice program that is so far bearing worthwhile fruits. In the past,
all members of the track team worked out in the afternoons. With
a two-man staff, it was impossible to give enough individual attention
to each man, and the nature of track and field makes large group
instruction impractical.
This year, all candidates for the team will work out in a morning
Iraek and field class. They'll remain in the morning program until
performances AND attitude warrant their receiving an invitation to
participate in the afternoon sessions.
This way, notes Jordan, the afternoons will be reserved for just
the men who are making a positive contribution to the club. The
facilities won't be littered with a bunch of hangers-on men who
may be good enough to be? the third or fourth man in an event, bul
who don't care about improving and don't contribute to the club.
"We'd rather not he represented in an event than to have some
dcadheat running," says Jordan. And he's perfectly right. Why in
the world waste time, money and effort on a non-productive invest
ment.
But the beauty of the new program is that no one will be able
to cry the blues about not getting a fair test. Anyone can try out
through the morning sessions; he'll have ample opportunity to qualify
lor the afternoon program.
The report is that morning drills are thus far a big success. "The
attitude is amazing," according to Jordan. Where it appeared that
borderline athletes might slough off in a class that on the surface
appears too P.E.ish, there hasn't been anything of the sort.
Only about half a dozen men are working in the invitational after
noon program, but among these, the sprinters are looking especially
good. With Dean Smith, Norm Pease and Ben Anixter already dis
playing plenty of sharpness out of the blocks, prospects for the
spring are brightening.
When Jordan first came to Stanford in 1956, the consensus was
that he'd need five years to rebuild local track. It looked like it would
lake that long to revamp what had degenerated into a poor spike
set-up. This latest progress step comes near the half-way mark of
the five years—-and looks like it may play a key role in shortening
those five years to four, or maybe even three.
Short of Copy, L.A.?
The boys in L.AI. had a little trouble finding much to write about
n week ago after Stanford had whipped UCLA. So here's what Bob
Seizer had to dredge up for his Mirror-News article:
Stanford players voted the game hall to Al Masters, athletic
director and a powerful figure in Bruin eligibility penalties . . .
Masters had as much to do with the victory as anyone, I suppose,
hnt perhaps the Indians should have sliced the pigskin in half and
mailed part of it to Orlando llollis.
Wonder if we'll read the M-N this week and see suggestions that
the Trojans cut up their game ball and distribute the pieces around
to a few of their bridge-playing alumni (they must play bridge—
they bid so well).

It didn't get much play in the local press, but UCLA had its fourth
head coach of the season last week. Seems that Billy Barnes' father
in-law passed away in the East, and Billy flew back for the funeral.
This put Deke Braekett on top of the coaching heap, succeeding
the late Red Sanders, the hospitalized George Dickerson, and Barnes.
Before you know it, Jim Dawson will be directing the Bruins. Jim
was hired as an assistant late this fall after an injury prevented him
from playing.

The L.A. press did have nice words for Chris Burford. "Yes, he's
AII-American caliber," said Sid /iff of the Mirror-News.
"He was a holy terror on defense," said AP.
"I have not seen a better end this year," said Billy Barnes.
And I'll go along with all of them.
