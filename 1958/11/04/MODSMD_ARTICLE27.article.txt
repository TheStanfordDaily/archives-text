# Cal's Patton Disabled
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (/P) â€”Califor-
nia probably won't have the serv
ices of fullback Billy Patton for
Saturday's game with UCLA, but
should get back center Frank Do
cot li and halfback Hank Olguin.
Patton suffered a strained knee
last Saturday against Oregon
State, and while the injury isn't
serious he probably won't be able
to play this week.
