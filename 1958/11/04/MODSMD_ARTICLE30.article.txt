# Gridders View Flicks Of Solid Duck Defense
## 
### 
Coach Jack Curtice's Stanford Indians went to the flicks yesterday,
but it wasn't a class "A" picture that they saw. It was a class "D"
picture of Len Casanova's Oregon Webfootsâ€”and that "D" stands
for defense.
Yesterday's Card practice was a mental one, taken up mainly by

scout Dutch Fehring's report of
he Cards' Saturday opponents in
Eugene.
And out of Fehring's report,
and a few other available reports,
a few things were pretty evident
to the Stanfords.
Top Defensive Club
Saturday's game will be played
against the Pacific Coast Confer
ence's leading defensive club.
After last Saturday's 29-6 defeat
by Southern California's Trojans,
Curtice remarked that in each
game that his Indians had won,
their offense had really worked
well for them. That offense, if
I hey are to win next Saturday,
will not only have to work well;
it'll have to be perfect.
And that poses a few problems.
Stanford has been having a lit
tle backfield trouble this season,
and it isn't positive that all will be
well again for this game.
Injured fullback Gil Dowd, who
figured to be a starter after his
early-season showing, finally
made it back into the lineup last
week, but he wasn't quite ready
for the job. Dowd will go at full
strength all this week, though,
and should be ready for Oregon.
McMillen Still Doubtful
Halfback Rick McMillen, who
went as wild as a runner can go
in the Washington game, but then
got knocked out of action by the
Air Force, will not have his cast
removed until today, and the ques
tion of his ability to whip back
into shape for Saturday is one
which can't be answered by the
Indian coaching staff right now.
Another halfback, John Bond, is
in doubtful condition, according to
assistant trainer Hank Rolden.
Bond strained a ligament in a

knee early in the Trojan war and
has been told to rest it for a while.
End Irv Nikolai came up with
a Southern Cal reminder in the
form of a sprained ankle. Evi
dently, Nikolai's injury is a minor
one which doesn't figure to keep
him out of action in Eugene.
