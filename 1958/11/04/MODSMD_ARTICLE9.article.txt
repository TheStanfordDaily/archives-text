# CASTRO'S REBELS
## Cuban Vote Diminished By Intimidation, Violence 
### 
HAVANA (/I 5 ) â€”Voting under the protection of Batista government
guns was light in Cuba's presidential election.
The rebels of Fidel Castro had called for a vote boycott and threat
ened violence to voters and death to candidates.
Many intimidated or apathetic thousands of the nation's 2.870,000

eligible voters stayed away from
the polls.
President Fulgencio Batista is
sued a stern last-minute warning
that anyone who did not vote
would be disqualified from gov
ernment employment for two
years.
Batista Votes
Batista, strongman of Cuban
politics for a quarter of a cen
tury. voted just before noon. He
has promised to step down with
the expiration of his term Feb. 24,
confident that his hand - picked
choice as a successor, former Pre
mier Andres Rivero Aguero,
would win.
.Rivero Aguero was generally
conceded to be far out front in
the four-man field, thus assuring
a continuance of policies of the
Batista regime.
United Parties
The four pro-government par
ties were united. The opposition
was split among former Presi
dent Ramon Grau San Martin,
Carlos Marquez Sterling and Al
berto Salas Amaro.
Hope of bringing peace to the
island, torn by 23 months of re
volt, seemed slim regardless of
whether Rivero Aguero wins or
not. Castro, in demanding a boy
cott of the election, warned he
would carry on his fight regard
less of who wins.
Polls closed at 6 p.m. A defi
nite trend was expected by 3 a.m.
Tuesday.
The rebels had vowed to kill all
candidates who did not withdraw
from the elections.
