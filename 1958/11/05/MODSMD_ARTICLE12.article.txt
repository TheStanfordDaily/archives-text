nor Goodwin Knight.
Races for the remaining state

appeared as though some of the

seats.
Mosk Wins

feated his Republican opponent
Patrick Hillings by an 8 lo 5 mar
gin. Late returns gave Mosk 527,-
343 votes to Hillings' 317,146.
In the race for Lieutenant Gov
ernor, Glenn Anderson, the Dem
ocratic challenger, held a slim
lead over the Republican incum
bent Harold Powers with a vote
of 300,225 to 297,286.
The incumbent Secretary of
Slate, Frank Jordan, edged ahead
of the Democratic challenger,
Henry Lopez, late in the evening
after the lead had changed hands
many times. The totals stood:
Jordan, 253,976; Lopez, 241,674.
Controller Leads
Controller Bob Kirkwood led
his Democratic opponent with 9,-
090 precincts reported, 297,235 to
282,312.
The race for State Treasurer
between the Republican incum
bent, A. Ronald Button, and the
Democrat, Bert Betts, remained
extremely close. A reporting 9198
precincts gave Button 266,643 to
Betts, 277,025.
Knowland conceded the race to
Brown about 11 p.m. and said: "I
have sent my congratulations to
Attorney General Edmund Brown.
He has been given the opportu
nity and the responsibility to be
chief executive of California for
the next four years.
"Had I been disloyal to my
principles or turned my back on
the other candidates on the Re
publican ticket, I would feel less
at ease than I do today."
Newspaper Business
He added, "I'm going back into
the newspaper business," and
when asked if he has any political
plans for the future, he answered
with one word: "No."
Brown said, "I believe the de
cisiveness of the election returns
indicates I have been elected Gov
ernor. I am deeply aware of the
profound responsibilities which
my victory brings."
Engle claimed victory early in
the evening and said, "It is evi
dent from the results that the
people want the leadership which
our party has provided and will
provide."
Knight Not Conceding
Knight said he wasn't defeated
yet. "We're conceding nothing."
He added, "I've been in this busi
ness a long time, and I expect to
be in it a long time."
It appeared as though the Dem
ocrats would win control of the
California Assembly and the Cali
fornia Senate.
Record numbers turned out
today throughout the state. In
Los Angeles County, 79.4 per
cent of the registered voters went
to the polls. The largest estimate
was 75 per cent. At the last off
year election in 1954 only 69 per
cent of the voters turned out. Los
Angeles County has 41 per cent
