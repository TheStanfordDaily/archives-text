# Keio-100 Years
## 
### 
I mis vi Alt marks the 100 th anniversary of tlie founding of Keio
I niversilv, in Japan, and it is the third vear of the Keio-Stanford
Affiliation.
At present Hichard Anderson is representing Stanford at Keio
and Voshihiro Tsurumi is here. This exchange of students serves
in an > purposes.
First, the students themselves receive numerous [>cr
sonal benefits in travel ing and studying in a foreign
country. Their own understanding of the culture and
customs of another people is valuable to their personal
growth.
\lso, the two universities benefit in having foreign students
in iheir midst, in that all students may get a taste of the differ
ences of living between the two countries.
Then, when the university's own student returns, his experi
ences as he relates them to his colleagues again increase under
standing.
And wh\ is all this understanding valuable for university stu
dents? "The voutli of today are the leaders of tomorrow'; hence,
background obtained bv the exchange of students will benefit their
respective countries in future relationships \\ith other nations.
If we can begin to understand the position of Japan
in the Far Fast, the position of our nation in our diplo
matic relations with the Orient u ill be furthered.
lu connection with the Keio-Stanford Affiliation, The Daily
has arranged an exchange of newspapers with the Mila Campus,
1 lie Knglish language newspaper at Keio. This 100, we feel, will
help to broaden the knowledge of the students of the Iwo countries
through the exchange of articles and news.
We have alreadv sent our personal good wishes to Keio as the
university marks its 100 th anniversary, and wish to take this op
portunity to again congratulate the students and faculty there
upon their achievements.
