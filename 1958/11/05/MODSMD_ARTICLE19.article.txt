Ideas Exchange
Editor; The Daily:
It gives me real pleasure to
have a chance to shake hand with
your press society Stanford Daily
and exchange ideas each other on
this occasion of the 100 th anniver
sary of Keio University.
This affliation, we are sure,will
offer increasing hope for ever
greater understanding and friend
ship between the students of Stan
ford and Keio and it will serve the
useful purpose for furthering in
ternational goodwill and friendly
relationship.
We certainly wish our every
best success in this new affilia
tion.

Meantime, The Mita Campus is
published every month through
academic year since the first
issue was published on Aug. 15,
1946, just one year after the end
of (lie World War 11. We come to
publish the 84th edition this time.
The Society presently consists
of 100 member's. The Chief pur
pose of the society and the news
paper is to help the people of the
whole world understand Japanese
st u dent s correctly. For this
reason, the paper is directed to
overseas readers. Each time an
issue comes out, Keio University
buys a certain numbers, for the
university regards it as a good
organ for publicity. Every mem
ber of the Mita Campus is proud
of his society for it is a window
of the University open to the
whole world.
The Mita Campus attained its
12th anniversary last August. It
came out of the post-war confus
ion and through the time of dif
ficulties. Both economically and
technically, the paper has devel
oped year by year until in com
memoration of the Keio Centen
nial this fall, the publication of
the 20 page special edition will
soon come out in print.
As the Editors of the Mita Cam
pus are Japanese students, there
may be imperfect points in our
press as a English paper. We are
very happy to receive your kind
advice and further assistance. If
there is any occasion on which we
are able to be of service to you
in providing information on Jap
anese student events, please feel
free to write to us. It is our
great pleasure to put your name
in our exchange list.
Our continued best wishes to
you and good luck on the Stan
ford Daily.
