Observing great contrasts be
tween cultures that preserve and
those which "make and discard,"
Prof. Felix M. Keesing, head of
the Department of Anthropology,
surmised that "our affiliations
are with the make â€¢ and - discard
culture."
In a Tuesday Evening Series
talk illustrated with colored slides
taken by his wife, Keesing point
ed out both cultural continuity
and indications of modernity in
the peoples and cities of Europe
and Asia. His observations were
made during a recent eight-month
sabbatical tour of Europe, Tur
key, India and southeast Asia.
Defending the American ex
hibit at the World's Fair in Brus
sels, Keesing said he thought it
"highly sophisticated," having
"taste and finesse" not found in
the Russian exhibit of heavy ma
chinery the sort of display "that
we would have shown 20 years
ago."
