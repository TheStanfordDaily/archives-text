The Bruins and Big-Time Football
The mighty Bruins of the Southland, turning their backs on their
"smalltime" Northwest neighbors with the little, tiny stadiums,
might as well be playing their home games at the same high school
thai used to serve as their basketball home.
It's a shame to bring out all of the ushers and venders and other
employees of the Los Angeles Coliseum for a UCLA game. The fans
at recent Bruin games must feel awfully lonely, because they aren't
much in that huge oval.
It must be admitted that the Bruins haven't exactly set any worlds
on lire this year. They cry bitter tears because they lost some of
their key players through Pacific Coast Conference penalties, but
even when those seniors were in the lineup it was a dismal year for
the lJelans\
With UCLA and Southern California about to depart into Ihe
really big gridiron wars, it is becoming evident that they may be
far from prepared. College football in Los Angeles needs a real shot
in the arm. If so-so teams is the explanation for this seasons pathetic
turn-outs, what is going to happen if the Bruins and Trojans find
1 hemselves continually inferior to the Notre Dames and Armys and
Piltsburghs and they hope to have on the schedule in a
few years?
Oregon Coach Casanova said last week that football needs a con
ference to survive. Cas was the head man at Santa Clara when the
Broncos dropped football. Santa Clara and Sail Francisco had to drop
the grid sport because of lack of finances, but the lack of finances
was the result of lack of crowds, despite "big" opponents.
This isn't to suggest that UCLA and USC will soon have to aban
don football, but there's nothing like an old conference traditional
or tille at stake to bring out the fans.
By admission of players and students alike, UCLA annually looks
to two 810 ONUS: USC and Stanford. The crowd at the recent Stan
lord Bruin clash certainly wouldn't show that. To top it off, it was
Homecoming for UCLA. Attendance: 39,129. This is what they call
big-time football in the Southland.
Oh . . . Ifs All the Rams' Fault
Last week UCLA tangled with a highly-touted and explosive
Washington State team. Attendance: 25,000. It might be noted here
thai when the schools met last year they played before 27,000 . . .
up north.
USC opened its season against conference favorite Oregon Slate;
40,000 saw Ibis one. Last year, 37,000 watched the Trojans and Bea
vers bailie in the north. These northern turnouts come from much
more sparsely-populated areas. . . . LA is the biggest thing this side
of The Father of Waters.
Where is the attention of the Southland grid fans? That was
fairly well illustrated the day afler the Bruin-Cougar rat-race (38-20,
WSO: 100,470 Angelinos- turned out to witness a game of profes
sional football between the local Hams and the Chicago Bears.
There aren't many real-true grid fans who won't admit that Jon
Arnelt's fabulous running antics are a bit more exciting this season
than the staggering Baby Blue. But is this the "big-timeness" that
is supposedly forcing the Bruins to dump on the little sisters of the
PCC?
The threat that pro football might push the colleges out of the
picture in LA has been on the horizon for some years as the Ranis
continue to pack them in. The Bruins and Trojans blamed sagging
attendance on the unknown Northern schools and claimed that if
ihey could bring in mighty independents they, too, would be packing
them in.
A rousing crowd of 33,000 attended UCLA's opener with Pitts
burgh this year. Pitt is one of the mighty independents that the
Soutblunders had nominated for their nationwide conference. Last
year, less than 65,000 saw the big traditional, USC-UCLA clash.
There were that many to watch Stanford and Oregon State two years
ago . . . almost that many for Stanford-Oregon last year.
No Such Trouble Back East
At Ohio State, somebody pushes the panic button if the Buckeyes'
attendance for any game sags below the capacity of 82,000. The
University of Michigan, with the only college stadium in the country
larger than Stanford's, has the same fabulous attendance. Along
with Michigan State, Ihe Wolverines seem not in the least bothered
by Ihe nearness of the Detroit Lions . . . annually a bigger pro con
tender than the Hams-. And the Lions can't find room for their fans,
either.
These universities, and those of the de-emphasized Ivy League,
are bound by great tradition of many years of winning football. But
isn't USC? And while UCLA is a comparative johnny-come-lately on
the big-time athletic scene, the Bruins are—by their own admission—
Ihe "Winningest Team in the West" (2-5 for the winningest boys
this year).
Trojan and Bruin stock should return to the level it attained sev
eral years ago. For their sake, it had better, because things might
get brutal in there every year against the likes of Notre Dame, Army
and Navy. If things don't get better, attendance won't either.
Southern Cal already has a great traditional with Notre Dame
which usually draws as many as the UCLA game. The Bruins can
call on no such intersectional attraction year-in and year-out.
The Soutblunders have griped about everybody else's "poor" at
tendance without looking at their own rather paltry gate figures.
But big gates or not, they're going big time. Did they bite off more
than they can chew?
