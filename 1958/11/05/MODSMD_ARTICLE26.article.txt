There weren't too many aspects of football that Coach Jack Cur
tice's Stanford Indians didn't work on yesterday as they got down to
the rough and tumble problem of preparing for the Oregon Ducks
this Saturday in Eugene, Ore.
Curtice sent the locals through extensive offensive and defensive

drills designed to get at the Ore
gonians' weaknesses, but these,
according to scout Dutch Fehr
ing, are too few and quite far be
tween.
"Oregon," Fehring feels, "has
as many fast backs as any team
we'll meet this year." Beyond
this he feels thai the Webfoots*
strong, veteran line will he a
tough one for the Indians to
crack.
Halfback Willie West gets most
of Fehring's praise. He is a fast
runner, an excellent receiver and
"one of the best all-around backs
on the coast." West is the top
runner on the coast, average-wise
at least. He is third in total yard
age, having gained 294 yards in
56 carries for a 5.3 mark.
A Threat —If Ready
Charlie Tourville, at the other
halfback post, will also be a
threat to the Indians —if he is
ready to play. He was knocked
out of action in the Oregon-Cal
game but figures to be back in
against Stanford on Saturday.
Should West or Tourville not
see action Saturday, Herm Me-
Kinney and Don Laudenschlager,
respectively, will go at these spots
and Fehring was impressed with
both Ihese boys.
At fullback ihe Ducks will have
both Marian Holland and Dave
Powell, and neither of these run
ners are unimpressive. Both have
turned in impressive shows in
Oregons' somewhat luckless 2-4
season to date.
The Webfoots have lost three
games by 6-0 scores. They have
been topped by Oklahoma, Wash
ington State and Washington by
these marks. The Washintgon
win would look favorable in the
Stanford camp if one of Oregon's
wins hadn't been a 25-0 victory
over Southern California's Tro
jans, victors in Stanford Stadium
last week.
Trouble from Stover
All-American end Ron Stover
figures to give the Indians trouble
out in the flats—again, provided
he gets to see action in Saturday's
game. Stover did not make it into
last week's Washington game, but
is being counted on for the Indian
assault.
At quarterback the Webfoots
should go with No. 1 man Dave
Grosz. Though not picked as a
pre season starter, Grosz has been
effective in passing for 342 yards
at a 44.6 per cent clip. He is
backed up by Paul Grover who
has a higher average but has not
been able to gather in the yardage
with his aerials.

There weren't too many aspects of football that Coach Jack Cur
tice's Stanford Indians didn't work on yesterday as they got down to
the rough and tumble problem of preparing for the Oregon Ducks
this Saturday in Eugene, Ore.
Curtice sent the locals through extensive offensive and defensive

drills designed to get at the Ore
gonians' weaknesses, but these,
according to scout Dutch Fehr
ing, are too few and quite far be
tween.
"Oregon," Fehring feels, "has
as many fast backs as any team
we'll meet this year." Beyond
this he feels thai the Webfoots*
strong, veteran line will he a
tough one for the Indians to
crack.
Halfback Willie West gets most
of Fehring's praise. He is a fast
runner, an excellent receiver and
"one of the best all-around backs
on the coast." West is the top
runner on the coast, average-wise
at least. He is third in total yard
age, having gained 294 yards in
56 carries for a 5.3 mark.
A Threat —If Ready
Charlie Tourville, at the other
halfback post, will also be a
threat to the Indians —if he is
ready to play. He was knocked
out of action in the Oregon-Cal
game but figures to be back in
against Stanford on Saturday.
Should West or Tourville not
see action Saturday, Herm Me-
Kinney and Don Laudenschlager,
respectively, will go at these spots
and Fehring was impressed with
both Ihese boys.
At fullback ihe Ducks will have
both Marian Holland and Dave
Powell, and neither of these run
ners are unimpressive. Both have
turned in impressive shows in
Oregons' somewhat luckless 2-4
season to date.
The Webfoots have lost three
games by 6-0 scores. They have
been topped by Oklahoma, Wash
ington State and Washington by
these marks. The Washintgon
win would look favorable in the
Stanford camp if one of Oregon's
wins hadn't been a 25-0 victory
over Southern California's Tro
jans, victors in Stanford Stadium
last week.
Trouble from Stover
All-American end Ron Stover
figures to give the Indians trouble
out in the flats—again, provided
he gets to see action in Saturday's
game. Stover did not make it into
last week's Washington game, but
is being counted on for the Indian
assault.
At quarterback the Webfoots
should go with No. 1 man Dave
Grosz. Though not picked as a
pre season starter, Grosz has been
effective in passing for 342 yards
at a 44.6 per cent clip. He is
backed up by Paul Grover who
has a higher average but has not
been able to gather in the yardage
with his aerials.
