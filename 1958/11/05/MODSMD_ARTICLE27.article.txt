The Stanford frosh football
team is going to have its work cut
out for it when it travels to Los
Angeles for a game with UCLA
Friday.
After the Papooses had taken a
licking from Southern California
Saturday, Ihe word came from
Berkeley that UCLA freshman
coach Boh Bergdahl had success
fully unveiled his team as it took
a close contest from Cal. 14-(>.
UCLA used its traditional sin
gle wing attack, and apparently
they have the runners needed to
make this offense go. Stanford
frosh coach Homer Smith says
that playing against the single
wing will require strong defen
sive effort and that the team will
be depending heavily on Bob Mul
ler and Steve Pursell as keys to
stopping the attack.
One major change has been
made in the Stanford offense, as
quarterback Stan Lindskog has
been moved to fullback. Fullback
Bill Kuhn is also working out at
the wingback spot. Smith says
this change has been made be
cause Lindskog is too good a foot
ball player to be kept out.
Dave Nolan, who suffered a
minor concussion in the SC game,
has been working out early this
week and should be ready to play
Friday. He was hurt in the sec
ond half, but recently - viewed
movies pointed Nolan out as the
outstanding defensive lineman in
the first half of the game.
Smith said, "The movies
showed that we played excellent
defense in the first three quar
ters. We got tired in the last pe
riod and our defensive pursuit
broke down."
