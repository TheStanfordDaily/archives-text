ANYONE FOR FOOTBALL?
When Pancho Sigafoos, sophomore, pale and sensitive, first saw
VVilia Ludowic, freshman, lithe as a hazel wand and rosy as the
dawn, he hemmed not; neither did he haw. "I adore you," he
said without preliminary.
"Thanks, hey," said Willa, flinging her apron over her face
modestly. "What position do you play?"
"Position?" said Pancho, looking at her askance. (The
askance is a ligament just behind the ear.)
"On the football team," said Willa.
"Football!" sneered Pancho, his young lip curling. "Football
is violence, and violence is the death of the mind. I am not a
football player. I am a poet!"
"So long, buster," said Willa.
"Wait!" cried Pancho, clutching her damask forearm.
She placed a foot on his pelvis and wrenched herself free.
"I only go with football players," she said, and walked, shimmer
ing, into the gathering dusk.

Panclio wont to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered his
dread dilemma. What kind of cigarette did Panclio light? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris!
Philip Morris is always welcome, but never more than when
you are sore beset. When a follow needs a friend, when the heart
is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, then, thon above all,
is the time for the mildness, the serenity, that only Philip Morris
can supply.
Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psyche welded, his feverod brow
cooled, his synapses restored, after smoking a fine Philip Morris,
came to a decision. Though he was a bit small for football (an
even four feet) and somewhat overweight (427 pounds), he tried
out for the team—and tried out with such grit and gumption
that he made it.
Pancho's college opened the season against the Manhattan
School of Mines, always a mettlesome foe, but strengthened
this year by four exchange students from (Gibraltar who had been
surkled by she-apes. By the middle of the second quarter the
Miners had wrought such havoc upon Pancho's team that there
was nobody left on the bench but Pancho. And when the
quarterback was sent to the infirmary with his head driven
straight down into his esophagus, the coach had no choice but
to put Pancho in.
Pancho's teammates were not conspicuously cheered as the
little fellow took his place in the huddle.
"Gentleman," said Pancho, "some of you may regard poetry
as sissy stuff, but now in our most trying hour, let us hark to
these words from Paradise Losl: 'All is not lost; the uncon
querable will and study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage
never to submit or yield!' "
So stirred was Pancho's team by this fiery exhortation that
they threw themselves into the fray with utter abandon. As
a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before the half.
The college was forced to drop football. Willa Ludowic, not
having any football players to choose from, took up with Pancho
and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Today they are seen
everywhere—dancing, holding hands, nuzzling, smoking.

Philip Morris is always welcome, but never more than when
you are sore beset. When a follow needs a friend, when the heart
is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, then, thon above all,
is the time for the mildness, the serenity, that only Philip Morris
can supply.
Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psyche welded, his feverod brow
cooled, his synapses restored, after smoking a fine Philip Morris,
came to a decision. Though he was a bit small for football (an
even four feet) and somewhat overweight (427 pounds), he tried
out for the team—and tried out with such grit and gumption
that he made it.
Pancho's college opened the season against the Manhattan
School of Mines, always a mettlesome foe, but strengthened
this year by four exchange students from (Gibraltar who had been
surkled by she-apes. By the middle of the second quarter the
Miners had wrought such havoc upon Pancho's team that there
was nobody left on the bench but Pancho. And when the
quarterback was sent to the infirmary with his head driven
straight down into his esophagus, the coach had no choice but
to put Pancho in.
Pancho's teammates were not conspicuously cheered as the
little fellow took his place in the huddle.
"Gentleman," said Pancho, "some of you may regard poetry
as sissy stuff, but now in our most trying hour, let us hark to
these words from Paradise Losl: 'All is not lost; the uncon
querable will and study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage
never to submit or yield!' "
So stirred was Pancho's team by this fiery exhortation that
they threw themselves into the fray with utter abandon. As
a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before the half.
The college was forced to drop football. Willa Ludowic, not
having any football players to choose from, took up with Pancho
and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Today they are seen
everywhere—dancing, holding hands, nuzzling, smoking.

When Pancho Sigafoos, sophomore, pale and sensitive, first saw
VVilia Ludowic, freshman, lithe as a hazel wand and rosy as the
dawn, he hemmed not; neither did he haw. "I adore you," he
said without preliminary.
"Thanks, hey," said Willa, flinging her apron over her face
modestly. "What position do you play?"
"Position?" said Pancho, looking at her askance. (The
askance is a ligament just behind the ear.)
"On the football team," said Willa.
"Football!" sneered Pancho, his young lip curling. "Football
is violence, and violence is the death of the mind. I am not a
football player. I am a poet!"
"So long, buster," said Willa.
"Wait!" cried Pancho, clutching her damask forearm.
She placed a foot on his pelvis and wrenched herself free.
"I only go with football players," she said, and walked, shimmer
ing, into the gathering dusk.

Panclio wont to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered his
dread dilemma. What kind of cigarette did Panclio light? Why,
