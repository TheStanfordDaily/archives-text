# Democrats Sweep Senate, House

Compiled from
The Associated Press
Democrats clinched control of
the U.S. House of Representatives
early today when returns showed
the 219 th Democrat elected. Con
trol of the U.S. Senate has been
assured with at least 53 Demo
crats- three more than a ma
jority.
Democrats lost no time in win
ning control of the Senate for the
third straight time as 23 of 34
races went their way. Republi
cans could garner only eight seats,
while three races were still un
decided.
With nearly three-quarters of
the House races decided, Demo
crats had captured 236 seats to 83
for the Republicans. They led in
17 of the remaining contests.
Democrats had already won 27
previously-Republican seats, and
appeared ready to add 28 more.
No Republicans had won previ
ously-Democratic seats.
Nelson Rockefeller provided one
of the few sources of happiness
for Republicans when he upset
Gov. Averill Harriman in the race
for the New York governorship.
Rockefeller was one of only four
Republicans to win gubernatorial
battles as 21 Democrats swept to
victory. Five races were still un
decided.
At midnight it appeared that
the Democrats would win 62 Sen
ate seats.
Democrats took over Republi
can Senate seats in California,
Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan,
Minnesota, Nevada and New Jer
sey. But the two reversals which
assured them Senate control came
in West Virginia, where Robert
Byrd and Jennings Randolph up
set GOP incumbents.
The Democratic tide ran so
strongly that all six Republican
House members from Connecticut
went down to defeat along with
GOP Sen. William Purtell, who
lost his seat to Thomas J. Dodd.
Even rock-ribbed Republican
Vermont elected a Democrat to its
at-large House post for the first
time in 106 years.
Two leading contenders for the
1960 Democrat ic presidential nom
ination won re-election handily—
Sens. John Kennedy of Massachu
s e t t. sand Stuart Symington of
Missouri. Gov. G. Mennen Wil
liams of Michigan, another Demo
cr a t i c hopeful, also ran well
ahead.
But the one Republican whose
name now appears on the horizon
to challenge Vice President Rich
ard Nixon for the 1960 presiden
tial nomination is Rockefeller. He
led Harriman by nearly half a mil
lion votes, with 90 per cent of the
returns complete.
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwatcr
and his running mate for gover
nor of that state, Paul Fannin,
were among the few other Repub
licans to score impressive wins.

Nelson Rockefeller provided one
of the few sources of happiness
for Republicans when he upset
Gov. Averill Harriman in the race
for the New York governorship.
Rockefeller was one of only four
Republicans to win gubernatorial
battles as 21 Democrats swept to
victory. Five races were still un
decided.
At midnight it appeared that
the Democrats would win 62 Sen
ate seats.
Democrats took over Republi
can Senate seats in California,
Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan,
Minnesota, Nevada and New Jer
sey. But the two reversals which
assured them Senate control came
in West Virginia, where Robert
Byrd and Jennings Randolph up
set GOP incumbents.
The Democratic tide ran so
strongly that all six Republican
House members from Connecticut
went down to defeat along with
GOP Sen. William Purtell, who
lost his seat to Thomas J. Dodd.
Even rock-ribbed Republican
Vermont elected a Democrat to its
at-large House post for the first
time in 106 years.
Two leading contenders for the
1960 Democrat ic presidential nom
ination won re-election handily—
Sens. John Kennedy of Massachu
s e t t. sand Stuart Symington of
Missouri. Gov. G. Mennen Wil
liams of Michigan, another Demo
cr a t i c hopeful, also ran well
ahead.
But the one Republican whose
name now appears on the horizon
to challenge Vice President Rich
ard Nixon for the 1960 presiden
tial nomination is Rockefeller. He
led Harriman by nearly half a mil
lion votes, with 90 per cent of the
returns complete.
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwatcr
and his running mate for gover
nor of that state, Paul Fannin,
were among the few other Repub
licans to score impressive wins.
