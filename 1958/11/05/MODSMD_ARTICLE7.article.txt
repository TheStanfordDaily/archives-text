Mile Cucck, from Ljubljana

University in Yugoslavia, is stud
ying economics as a senior at
Stanford. In Yugoslavia, Cucek
was the loader of a campaign for
student rights, and a member of
a student committee for faculty
student relations.
Speaking of university life in
Yugoslavia, Cucek said that at
one time the students themselves
governed many university af
fairs, but since the Communist
rule this freedom has largely
been removed. Cucek considers
the Honor Code "sensational." for
such a system is unknown in Yu
goslavia. Ljubljana is not a resi
dential university, so that the stu
dent life there is very different
from the Stanford campus.
The opportunity to study in
America has satisfied a long am
bition. Cucek said, and he is deep
ly impressed by the warm wel
come he has received. He finds,
however, that students here have
little free time for relaxation and
extra-curricular activities.
Cucek hopes to be able to travel
through the United States to meet
"the working man in the street"
as well as the college student, and


miijo ci ( i;k
Yugoslav scholar
would like to stay for some time
with an American family. Like
America, Yugoslavia is a rapidly
expanding country, so that, as an
economist, Cucek is particularly
interested in learning as much as
possible about American econ
omy.
Cucek plans to return home via
Japan, and then continue his stud
ies at Ljubljana University.
