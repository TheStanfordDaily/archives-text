Satire
Miss Hellman's adaptation and
Bernstein's fanciful music at
tempt to retain the satire of Vol
taire, whose story concerns the
naively optimistic Candide,
thrown out of the castle of Thun
der-Ten-Tronck for making love
to the baron's beautiful daughter.
Candide then travels the world
over to observe and learn from
its follies.
This presentation is the first in
the Associated Students' 1958-59
Concert Series. Other attractions
for the series will be violinist
Ruggieo Ricci, appearing on Nov.
23; pianist Claudio Aairau and
the San Francisco Symphony.
Tickets for "Candide" have
been sold out.
