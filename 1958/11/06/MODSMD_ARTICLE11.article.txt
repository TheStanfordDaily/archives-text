# Frats to Host Crippled Kids
## 
### 
The Intcrfraternity Council is
currently arranging details of a
project to bring a large group of
disabled children to about 20 cam
pus fraternities for the Oregon
State football game Saturday,
Nov. 15, IFC spokesman Craig
Hooper told The Daily recently.
About 10 children will be
brought to each participating
house for lunch Saturday and will
then accompany their "big broth
ers" to the game.
Arrangements arc being made
for children in wheel chairs to
watch the game from the side
lines on the field. Ambulatory
children will sit with the frater
nity men in a special section, prob
ably in the end zones, said Hooper.
San Mateo county is the home
of all the children, whose disabili
ties are varied. Palsied children
will come from the El Portal chil
dren's center.
