# PORTENTS FOR 1960--
## National Political Scene Shifts 
### 
(Compiled from Associated Press

With his margin rolling impressively to
ward better than one million votes, Pat
Blown was quickly singled out by Demo
cratic National Chairman Paul Butler for
a place in the national political run.
"I do not mean Pat Brown will be nomi
nated for President in 1960 or that he will
seek the nomination," Butler said in Wash
ington.
Butler said he meant only that Brown
would play an important role at the party's
next convention.
Brown has disavowed any national ambi
tions. Early in his campaign for Governor,
he made a categorical statement that he
wouldn't seek the Vice-Presidential bid nor
would he serve if elected.
Knowlund's defeat removed him from

serious consideration in the GOP Presiden
tial race.
II also left Vice-President Nixon in an un
easy position with the loss of his home state
to the Democrats.
Nixon, until now the Republican Presi
dential hope for 19(30, has become one of
the hopes.
If these "battles of the millionaires" are
to become as popular as the recent one in
New York state. Nelson A. Rockefeller and
Senator John B. Kennedy might produce a
humdinger in '60.
Rockefeller insisted again that he has no
interest in the 1960 GOP Presidential nomi
nation.
"It honestly doesn't enter my mind ex
cept when you fellows ask me about it,"he
said. "I have a tremendous job ahead."
Results in Massachusetts pointed toward

a possibility of another battle of the money
men in 1960—should Rockefeller get the
nod for President from the GOP and the
Democrat turn to Kennedy.
Kennedy didn't hurt his own chances any
by uncorking the greatest plurality ever
turned out for a Massachusetts Senate seat
—around 800,000 and still going up
President Eisenhower has failed to hand
the Republican Party his popularity. He
and Nixon have not given it.the color of
modern Republicanism to match popular
belief in Democratic progressiveness.
Three successive defeats in Congress and
the growing list of Democratic Governors
means the country is basically as Demo
cratic as if was once basically Republican —
that the rise of a personality like Eisen
hower's merely interrupted the application
oX the rule. . .

With his margin rolling impressively to
ward better than one million votes, Pat
Blown was quickly singled out by Demo
cratic National Chairman Paul Butler for
a place in the national political run.
"I do not mean Pat Brown will be nomi
nated for President in 1960 or that he will
seek the nomination," Butler said in Wash
ington.
Butler said he meant only that Brown
would play an important role at the party's
next convention.
Brown has disavowed any national ambi
tions. Early in his campaign for Governor,
he made a categorical statement that he
wouldn't seek the Vice-Presidential bid nor
would he serve if elected.
Knowlund's defeat removed him from

serious consideration in the GOP Presiden
tial race.
II also left Vice-President Nixon in an un
easy position with the loss of his home state
to the Democrats.
Nixon, until now the Republican Presi
dential hope for 19(30, has become one of
the hopes.
If these "battles of the millionaires" are
to become as popular as the recent one in
New York state. Nelson A. Rockefeller and
Senator John B. Kennedy might produce a
humdinger in '60.
Rockefeller insisted again that he has no
interest in the 1960 GOP Presidential nomi
nation.
"It honestly doesn't enter my mind ex
cept when you fellows ask me about it,"he
said. "I have a tremendous job ahead."
Results in Massachusetts pointed toward

a possibility of another battle of the money
men in 1960—should Rockefeller get the
nod for President from the GOP and the
Democrat turn to Kennedy.
Kennedy didn't hurt his own chances any
by uncorking the greatest plurality ever
turned out for a Massachusetts Senate seat
—around 800,000 and still going up
President Eisenhower has failed to hand
the Republican Party his popularity. He
and Nixon have not given it.the color of
modern Republicanism to match popular
belief in Democratic progressiveness.
Three successive defeats in Congress and
the growing list of Democratic Governors
means the country is basically as Demo
cratic as if was once basically Republican —
that the rise of a personality like Eisen
hower's merely interrupted the application
oX the rule. . .
