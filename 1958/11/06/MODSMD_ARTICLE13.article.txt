## 
### 
Democrats pushed ahead last
night in four of the five contests
for state offices that still have not
been decided.
Alan Cranston, Democratic can
didate for controller, moved ahead
of the Republican incumbent, Bob
Kirkwood, as the Los Angeles re
turns came in. With 4000 pre
cincts still unreported, Cranston
led, 2,039,558 to 2,020.741 -a bare
19,000 majority.
Bert Betts, a newcomer to poli
tics, claimed victory in his race
for the treasurer's seat, now held
by Republican A. Ronald Button.
With 19,362 of 26,896 precincts re
ported, Belts' lead had climbed to
120,000. The totals stood: Betts
1,726,401, Button 1,606,439.
Betts is a certified public account
ant from Lemon Grove.
Lieutenant Governor
In the race for lieutenant gov
ernor, Democrat Glenn Ander
son's lead had increased and held
steady at about 60.000 votes. With
22.512 precincts reported, Ander
son had 2.101.359 votes to Repub
lican Harold Powers' 2,044,260.
Judge Stanley Mosk continued
to lead the Democratic ticket—
even running head of Pat Brown
—in his victory over Republican
Patrick Hillings for attorney gen
eral. Totals with 22,733 precincts
reported gave Mosk 2,522,331 and
Hillings 1,558,536.
Lopez Trails
The only Democrat trailing was
Henry Lopez in his pttempt to un
seat. Frank Jordan, Republican
secretary of the state. Totals with
21,912 precincts reporting gave
Jordan 1,952,461 to Lopez's 1,915.-
930—a bare 35,000-vote lead. With
southern California returns run
ning heavily Democratic, this race
will probably go right down to the
wire.
Pat Brown's margin over Wil
liam Knowland in the governor's
race approached 900,000 as 22,832
precincts reported. The totals
read: Brown 2,567,586, Knowland

Goodwin Knight in the race for
U.S. senator amounted to 600,000
votes. Late totals gave Engle 2,-
226.623 and Knight 1,629,252. Gov
ernor Knight conceded defeat yes
terday afternoon, but indicated he
wasn't through in politics yet.
Even when the final state vote
is counted, there are 80,000 ab
sentee ballots that might deter
mine some outcomes.
Betts is a certified public ac
countant from Lemon Grove.
With all votes still not counted.
Gov. - elect Brown had already
made his first appointment, nam
ing his campaign chairman, Fred
erick G. Dutton, to be his execu
tive secretary.
