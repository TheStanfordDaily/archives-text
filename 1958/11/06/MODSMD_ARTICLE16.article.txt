### 
A Dkmocka lie l..v\l>si.!lirc ha* swept the country. Pollsters and
predictors are Irving to evaluate tin* results of Tuesday s election
\v illi an eve to the 1960 presidential election.
Meanwhile, the voters who turned out in record numbers on
Tuesda\ to east their ballots will he watching and waiting to see
i! their selected officers fulfill their expectations.
In California the voters, lor the second time in this century,
have elected a Democrat to the governor's chair. W itli returns slill
not complete, indications are that the state government will he
almost entirely controlled by the Democrats.
A pparentlx voters Ili roil ghoni the nation Ihiic decided
it is "time for a change" In the 1052 presidential cam
paign this teas one of the issues the Democrats had been
in the presidential office■ for 20 years, through one and a
half icars, depression and inflation.
The Republicans have held the President's post for only six
years., Imt in that short time there has been almost as wide a range,
if not as extreme, of national events as in the previous 2(1 years.
\\ itli this in mind, as well as a mild national alarm of fearing war
over Ouemoy despite Administration assurances, the \olers surged
to the polls to indicate their dissatisfaction with the present Ad
ministration, in the chief way lliev can in a non-presidential elec
tion hv placing opposition party members in strong control of
the (longress.
In th<' last session of Congress, controlled by the Dem
ocrats by a slim margin, President Eisenhower was able
to accotn/dish more of his goals than most /'residents hare
in the past with the opposition party. Records show that
senators and representatives crossed party lines more
often than nsnal to approve tlii' l'resi<lenl's recommen
dations.
Whether the new (longress, in which the Democrats have in
creased their strength, will continue to support the President's
proposals remains to be seen. I here is strong possibility of a
stalemate between the Republican Administration and the Demo
cratic (longress in the next two years, neither side accomplishing
much.
I'lll already everyone is looking to 1960. II itli the
defeat of Governor llarriman in New York ami Senator
Knowlund in .California, two major contenders for the
//residential nomination from their respective parties,
Democratic and Republican, appear to be out of the way.
However, regardless of whom or what the next two years bring,
and even before the analysts complete their evaluations of Tues
day's results, we'll stick our necks out and predict another Demo
cratic landslide.
