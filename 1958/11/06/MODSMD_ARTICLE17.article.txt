# Ghost Traps' Used To Conquer Fear

"In order to expand, one must
contract first," said Lao-Tse.
Hindu-Buddists tend to his used
through-the-ages method of con
centration on undesirable soul
contents to get rid of them later
in the most effective way.
Visual and aural self-hallucina
-lions, mandala-formation, and
other devices are used in a similar
way as psychiatrists today use
various methods of overcoming
fear and complexes and attain
ultimate self-integration.
Some of the most impressive
gadgets using such methods are
the Tibetan "ghost traps". It was
a thrilling experience during a
trip to the Sikkimese Himalayas,
while visiting Tibetan monaster
ies to find on housetops and over
doorways colorful spider-web
like contraptions which appeared
at first to he television antennae.
Since there is no television they
obviously had to have another
purpose.
Years of Study
It took years of study to finally
find out about the real meaning
of this interesting discovery.
Whenever a village or one of the
large monasteries throughout
Tibet seem to be haunted by evil
spirits, the people ask one of the
leading Lama magicians to come
help. This man proceeds with
careful studies of the situation
as any doctor would before he
pronounces his diagnosis of the
case. After finding out what par
ticular evil power is threatening
Ihe place, he builds one of 14 dif
ferent types of ghost traps, which
were all constructed by one of the
Lamas to be brought to Stanford
University.
The traps vary greatly in size,
form and meaning. Most have in
common a central mast around
which side beams are constructed
so that hundreds of yards of var
ious colored wool threads can he
wound around them. The end
product is a huge sculpture-like
figure which has sometimes been
compared to oqr stabiles or mo
biles.
Some of the uses of the traps

are to take away the spirit caus
ing an infection or to throw back
the evil rays of inauspicious plan
ets. Still others are used for psy
chological purposes such as to
prevent the evil consequences of
a great success or to take away
the bad memory a villager mighl
have after a brief visit to distant
relatives.
This trap is taken to the haunt
ed place and planted into some
concrete which must be mixed
with ashes of the dead in order to
attract the evil spirits. The re
sults may take several days. The
Lama priest returns early every
morning to find out whether the
ghosts are trapped. He feels little
wool balls placed at all strategic
points of the device. As soon as
they feel moist he knows the
ghosts are trapped since their
spirits are considered to he liquid.
Throws Away
Next the priest takes the trap
out of the village miles away and
throws it down some deep slope
in the mountains. Neither trap
nor ghost will ever be able to re
turn.
We had recently a letter from
Prince Peter of Greece and Den
mark who has done much anthro
pology research near the Tibetan
frontier. While driving his jeep
on mountain roads near Sikkim
one day. he discovered down be
low in bushes one of the ghost
traps. He spent hours in disen
tangling it. loaded it on his jeep
and carried it home to his villa in
a little border town.
Minor Earthquake
Curiously, Prince Peter says
none of his neighbors or servants
wanted to talk to him after that,
believing he had brought evil.
After a minor earthquake, the
prince threw the trap away since
he was afraid that if there were a
major earthquake he would be
blamed.
In the United States these traps
have roused a great deal of inter
est and publicity during the last
years, particularly among artists,
who have been stimulated in the
construction of similar sculptures,
sometimes quite unaware of the
original magic-psychological pur
pose.
