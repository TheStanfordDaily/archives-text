# Ike Will Fight Spendthrifts In Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)â€”President
Eisenhower said Wednesday that
people he classes as spenders have
been elected to the new, Demo
cratic-controlled Congress. He
served notice on them that he will
fight higher spending as hard as
he can.
There will be no basic changes
in Administration policy as a re
sult of the Democratic sweep in
Tuesday's congressional elections,
the President made clear at a
"morning after" news conference.
Will the Democratic victories
discourage him in his task of
molding his party in the pattern
of what he calls "modern Repub
licanism"? Not for a minute, the
President maintained stoutly.
"I don't believe that anyone who
has such strong convictions as I
do about certain things can afford
to be discouraged," he said.
He said his Administration will
continue to plow the same furrow
on farm policy, struggling "right
square along the lines we've laid
out." Eisenhower advocates re
duced price supports and fewer
planting controls for major crops
and more dependence on a com
petitive, expanding market.
"So far as I know, I don't know
of any way in which I would
change the general lines of our
foreign policy," he continued.
On taxes, Eisenhower said, he
and his advisers haven't decided
yet what to do about meeting a
looming federal deficit.
