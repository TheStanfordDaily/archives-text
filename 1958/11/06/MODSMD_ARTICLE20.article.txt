Every Song and Yell
i Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up a
lew misunderstandings concern
ing last Friday night's rally. Ral
ly Com wanted this to be the best
rally ever held in Frost. In order
to achieve this goal they designed
the rally in accordance with what
they thought to be the desires of
the studen tbody, i.e., a rally that
is short, snappy and to the point.
This sort of program was the re
action resulting from many criti
cisms heaped upon last year's yell
leaders and Rally Com. Such com
ments as "the rallies were too
long," "yelling is for collegiates
and we're sophisticates," "let's
have less noise and more enter
tainment," were typical of those
received after every rally and
game.
It is now quite evident that the
preceding comments do not re
flect the general attitude of the
student body. Rally Com will not
make the same mistake twice.
Plans are now in full swing for
the noisiest, "yellingist," most
spirited Big Game Rally ever
seen on this campus. It will not
be Rally Corn's fault if you go
home with your voice still intact
that night. In the ensuing weeks
the committee will be distributing
sheets with all the Stanford yells
and every song sung so come pre
pared to sing and yell for we are
going to be collegiate at least one
night of the year.

Crusade for Axe
Editor, The Daily:
I was surprised to read in your
"scrapbook" column Monday
that you've been "constantly
questioned" what The Daily is
going to crusade on this year, for
I thought it was obvious to every
one that you've already begun
this year's major crusade.
Last year The Daily crusaded
for such things as abolition of
H-bomb testing and permanent
hiring ol a prominent and popular
j professor. Feeling, no doubt, that
H-bombs and professors are no
longer especially important, this
year The Daily is crusading (and
with that eminent success!) for a
goal of far-reaching importance
indeed in these days of crisis:
the immediate public display of
the Axe.

Safe Issues
Editor, The Daily:
It is disappointing that The
Daily should be so cowed by an
injunction to be non-partisan that
it becomes completely indifferent
and presents to its readers, on
election day, an editorial on
"Homecoming." There is nothing
, wrong with Homecoming, but it
| is largely superseded in impor
tance by ihe election. The impli
cation is present that The Daily
would prefer to consider political
problems as briefly as possible
and only when bound to do so by
the imminence of an election, and
when the election is over, will
turn back with relief to safe, un
controversial issues.

The Daily is blessed with a cer
tain amount of responsibility to
instruct and mold public opinion.
As part of this process, newspa
per editors have established some
thing of a precedent for express
ing an opinion and taking a stand.
In addition, The Daily is an ex
cellent vehicle for expressing stu
dent opinion, not only of its edi
tors, but also of its readers who
wish to communicate their ideas
in the form of letters.
In the past, students have fre
quently disagreed with The
Daily's editorial viewpoint. But
this has resulted in arguments
which made page 2 the most wide
ly read, talked-about and argued
about reading material on the
campus. With such a forum at its
disposal, it seems a shame that
The Daily should fail to take ad
vantage of it.

Swift Kick
Editor, The Daily:
Midterms probably mark the
time for one to survey, hopefully,
his academic progress, or lack of
same. To wonder if it's really
worth all the time and money and
anxiety to try and do more than
just "get through" college. For
me it's been an occasion for a
medium-sized discovery—it's not
the material or the teachers that
are dull, and it's not really that
impossible for me to get enthusi
astic about school work— it's just
one's fellow classmates that take
the inspiration out of school. They
quite effectively stifle anything
that might be considered a rather
unsophisticated even perhaps
rather naive interest in the mate
rial.
Of course as all generalizations
go this one is a bit untrue and
hardly subtle; my apologies to
those who aren't concerned; a
swift kick where they need it
most to those who should be.

Need Qualifications
Editor, The Daily:
In your Oct. 29 editorial you
describe the office of attorney
general as traditionally non-parti
san. This situation seems quite
likely to change in the future.
For years the highest ranking
Democrat in state affairs held the
office of attorney general. This
individual is now running for
governor. Without a doubt, his
popularity and notoriety have
been gained through performing
the duties of attorney general.
This position could well be envi
sioned as a springboard to higher
offices, if Pat Brown is elected
to the governorship.
As political parties recognize
the value of this office, the dan
ger of our candidates being in
ferior but popular will increase.
Perhaps some constitutional qual
ifications should be set forth.
