Washington—The modern
world is finding countless uses
for infrared radiation, the "invis
ible light" that enabled American
snipers 1o spot enemy soldiers on
pitch-dark nights during World
War 11.
Fruit growers have used in
frared rays to keep their plants
from freezing during the winter.
Detectives find infrared handy,
and housewives can cook with it.
Infrared has proved its enor
mous usefulness in industry only
in recent years, but it was dis
covered by science more than a
century and a half ago, the
National Geographic Society says.
In 1800 Sir William Herschel no
ticed that a thermometer showed
a higher temperature in the red
part of the spectrum than in the
| blue, and a still higher temper
ature when placed just outside

the red where nothing could be
seen.
From the work of the pioneer
scientists came the now famous
electromagnetic spectru m—an
enormous expansion of the spec
trum revealed when a prism
breaks up white light into its con
stituent colors (wave lengths.)
Infrared rays are emitted by
all bodies having a temperature
above absolute zero (minus 459.f>
degrees Fahrenheit.) Mot objects
give off more infrared rays than
colder objects.
Infrared can fry an egg in less
time than it takes to melt the but
ter in a frying pan by ordinary
cooking methods.
