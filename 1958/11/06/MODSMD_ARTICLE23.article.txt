(Editor's Note: This iÂ«s the third in a series of articles intro
ducing foreign students who have been awarded ASSU scholar
ships to enable tliem to study at Stanford.)
Yoshi Tsurumi, 1958 Keio ASSU Scholar, was the managing editor
of an English newspaper in Tokyo before coming to Stanford this

year from Japan.
A junior, Tsurumi is studying
economics, and is living this quar
ter with the Alpha Tan Omega
fraternity. He is a member of the
Youth Hostel Association, and his
oilier interests include swimming
and karate.
Tsurumi enjoys the academic j
life at Stanford, but said that he
is disappointed in extra-curricu
lar activities here.
The social activities and cus-1
toms in America are very differ
ent from those of his own coun
try, where social life is much
more restricted, he explained, and
he has found it very difficult at
first to get accustomed to living
here.
Tsurumi spent a few weeks in
San Francisco before coming to
campus, and plans to hitch-hike
to Mexico during Christmas vaca
tion.
He will return to Keio Univer
sity next year, but hopes eventu
ally to return to the United States
as a graduate student.
