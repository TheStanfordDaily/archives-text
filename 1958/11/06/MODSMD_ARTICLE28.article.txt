# Cards Meet Top Defense
## 
### 
Time is running short for Stan
ford's Indians- short, that is, as
far as propping for Saturday's
game against the Oregon Ducks
in Eugene.
And Stanford has lots of prep
ping to do for thai one, at least
as far as Head Coach Jack Cur
lice is concerned. Stanford, it
looks like, must come up with a
hotter offensive and defensive
game than it has shown so far
this year if it plans to get any
where near the Northwesters on
Saturday.
That the Indians will have to
play a top-notch offensive game
to win is evidenced by Oregon's
outstanding defensive showing so
far this year. Opponents have av
eraged only 154 yards against the
Ducks on the ground, (iS yards in
the air and 222 yards in total.
('oineidence
By some coincidence this is ex
actly the number of yards that
Stanford gained against Southern
('al's Trojans last Saturday. But
this breaks down to 67 yards
rushing and 15!) passing, about
the reverse of what Duck oppo
nents have been able to do.
Curtice called for lots of pass
ing al practice Tuesday with Sid
Garber and Dick Norman going
wilh ihe first and second units re
spect ively.
Pulling together a running
game has developed into a minor
headache for Curtice. It has be
gun to look like halfback Rick
McMillen will not be available for
this weekend's tussle. McMillen's
cast came oi l Tuesday and he has
been running with the second
unit but Curtice doesn't feel he
will make the comeback soon
enough.
Face â€”Papa
So again this week Jim Byrer,
Skip Face and Dick Bowers will
be running out of McMillen's
spot. Face, though, missed Tues
day's pract ice because of his new
born's arrival. The proud papa I
was in the thick of it yesterday,
though, and figures to put up a i
top effort against the Ducks.
In the other halfback position,
made vacant when the Trojans
took John Bond out of action Sat
urday, Curtice has Bill Donohue)
and Fred Bernadotti working out i
and has done some cross-shifting
with Bowers, running him from
the wingbaek slot on occasion.
Conklin Still Out
Roch Conklin still appears to be ,
the only member missing from I
the starting line. His muscle in
juries in the neck and shoulders
could keep him out of action on
Saturday. Doug Pursell has been!
working at: center and will, no
doubt, start there anyway.
So the big problem is still: Who !
will start at quarterback? Garber
seems to have the edge at present,
with Curtice hoping he can dupli
cate his performance against
UCLA and shake off whatever
bothered him against the Trojans
last week. If he can't, Norman
and Nicolet will be readied to step
in and take over.
Passing should be one of the
more interesting aspects of the
game which pits the second-place
passing club. Stanford, against ihe J
top pass defense club, Oregon. |
