# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Protiva, who comes to Stan
ford all the way from Iran, is
one of this year's tri-captains.
He is a big man at 6-2 and 227
and does a fine job place kick
ing as well as moving around
at the tackle spot. Protiva is in
his third year on the varsity
and has been one of Stanford's
solid linemen throughout his
ea reer.

Bowers, a fleet - footed back
from Northridge, has been a
real contender for Ihe first
string running halfback post
this year. Had an injury not.
set him back early in Ihe sea
son Bowers might be the team's
leading ground gainer. He
stands only 5-9 and weighs 17.3
but makes up for his lack of
stature with devastating speed.
