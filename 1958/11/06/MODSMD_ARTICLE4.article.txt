# Owls Ousted
## 
### 
The Buildings and Grounds De
partment has undertaken to "owl
proof" the bells of Hoover Tow
er's carillon.
According to a Hoover Institu
tion official, the wire fencing
around the bells will be raised to
prevent, the wise old birds from
loitering around the carillon. This
will mean an overall saving in
time and money for the Buildings
and Grounds Department, which
heretofore has had to keep the
bells in clean condition.
