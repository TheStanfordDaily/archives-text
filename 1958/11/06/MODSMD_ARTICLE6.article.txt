# Demo Sweep Grows In U. S., State Races
## Cinch 62 Senate, 281 House Seats 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” Demo
crats battered down a final Re
publican bastion in the West and
produced their biggest U.S. Sen
ate gain in history from belated
returns straggling in from Tues
day's election.
The dwindling trickle of ballots
from the hinterlands merely en
larged the dimensions of the most
spectacular Democratic political
triumph since the New Deal hey
days. Late results tightened an
already strengthened Democratic
control of both Senate and House
and tossed more Republican Gov
ernors out of office.
In the new Congress convening
in January, Democrats will have
a Senate margin of 62-34, with
only 50 needed for a majority.
The line-up was 49 Democrats, 47
Republicans in the old Senate.
Pre-election Outlook
Late Wednesday only three
House seats remained undecided,
with Republicans leading in all
three.
At that point, counting the elec
tion of two Democrats and a Re
publican in Maine, the standings
looked like this:
Democrats had upped their
House margin from 235 to at least

281; the GOP had sagged, from
200 in the last, Congress to 151
now. Democrats had ejected 46
Republicans while yielding only a
Minnesota seat to the GOP.
Gubernatorial Standing
A Democrat was ahead in the
only unsettled governorship race,
in Nebraska.
The Democrats had retained
the governorship in the Maine
election, elected 23 more Demo
crats Tuesday and had nine hold
overs, for a total of 33. Republi
cans had six holdovers and had
elected eight Governors, for a
total of 14.
Somewhat strangely, Republi
cans fared better in the South
than any other region proportion
ately.
The farm belt, which was sup
posed to edge over toward the
Democrats in 1954 and 1956, wait
ed until 1958 to produce vigorous
signs of dissatisfaction with the
GOP. Even with crops and prices
improved, that undercurrent of
unrest over administration price
support policies finally came to
the surface in such states as Wis
consin, Ohio, Minnesota, the Da
kotas, lowa, Nebraska and Kan
sas.
