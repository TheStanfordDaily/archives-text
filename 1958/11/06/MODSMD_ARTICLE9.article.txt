# Student Mosk Pleased With Father's Victory
## 
### Dick Barnes, Associate Editor 
California's new Attorney General may once have been a member
of the University of California Board of Regents, but he's got a leg
on the other side of the fence now, with a son at Stanford.
He's Democrat Stanley Mosk, presently a superior court judge in
Los Angeles, and his son is Dick Mosk, a junior here.

Dick was more than likely the
Stanford student most interested
in the outcome of Tuesday's state
elections. But he didn't have to
wonder for long, as his father
moved early into a lead over Pat
rick Millings that looks as though
it wil approach one million votes.
"We Were Confident"
"We felt pretty confident the
whole time," reflected Dick, "but
winning was great and I'm sure
proud of him."
He spent the day in Los Ange
les with his father and mother,
then went on a whirlwind tour of
radio and television stations and
campaign headquarters through
out the victorious evening.
Although the present campaign
has provided invaluable experi
ence for Mosk's work as a politi
cal science major, he can still re
member back to the 1944 election
battle when his father rolled up
the most votes ever gained in a
contested judicial election in Cali
fornia—74o,ooo.
A Bigger Scare
Until this year's primary elec
tion—which to Dick was a "big
ger scare" than the final—Mosk
hadn't been opposed for office
since the 1944 landslide.
Oddly enough, Mosk served in
the stalehouse from 1938 to 1942
as executive secretary to the last
Governor the Democrats had
prior to Pat Brown's election
Tuesday.
The campaign was not an easy
one for the Mosks, as the whole
family got into the swing of
family got into the swing of
things.
But campaign or not, the one
thing Dick couldn't do for his fa
ther was the thing that more than
2,300,000 Californians did do —
vote for him. Seems that Dick
isn't 21 yet.
