# Work-Right End Sought By Labor
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)— 1 The AFL
CIO, flush with election victories,
demanded an end to the state
"right-to-work" laws, which ban
the union shop.
The federation's executive coun
cil called on Congress to knock
out these devices by taking away
the federal sanction given them
in the Taft-Hartley Act.
It pressed, in fact, for an over
haul of the whole law, which has
governed labor-management rela
tions since 1947.
President George Meany report
ed on the meeting of the AFL
CIO Executive Council.
He told a news conference that
the right-to-work issue in six
states, notably California and
Ohio, contributed to the large
turnout of voters Tuesday.
Kansas Passes R-T-YV
Voters rejected proposals for
light-to-work laws in California,
Ohio, Colorado, Washington and
Idaho, but they approved one for
Kansas. These laws ban arrange
ments that require workers to be
union members. Eighteen states,
not counting Kansas, have such
laws.
In the congressional elections,
more complete results increased
the Democratic margin in the Sen
ate from 49-47 to 62-34 and the
Democratic majority in the House
from 235-200 to 281-153, with one
race undecided.
New Congress
Southern Democrats resisting
civil rights measures are likely to
have less influence in the new
Congress because of the election
of new Northern and Western
Democrats.
The newcomers will dilute the
Southerners' party strength, but
veterans from the South will con
tinue to hold the bulk of the Sen
ate and House committee chair
manships.
Nine of the 16 regular commit
tees in the Senate will be chair
manned by Southerners, as will
12 of the 19 committees in the
House.
