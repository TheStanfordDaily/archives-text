# Big Game Bonfire Moved to Friday; SF Rally Dropped
## 
### 
Bis Game Bonfire will be held
Friday, Big Game Eve, instead of
on the traditional Thursday.
The San Francisco Rally in Un
ion Square, usually held on Fri
day, has been canceled and the
"Burning of the Bear" has been
moved back a day to take its
place.
Sixty feet of wood will still he
piled in Lake Lagunita and the
freshmen will still stand guard as
per tradition; only the date is
changed.
The annual San Francisco
Rally will not be held because of
the troubles in preceding years.
"The band absolutely refuses to
go near Union Square and the
song girls are horrified with the
thought," said Ed White, Director
of Rallies for Rally Com.
Damage to Buses 1
Two years ago at the rally there
was a great deal of damage to
the buses. The yell leaders were
on top of one bus and Cal stu
dents were on top of another.
Stanford students decided to
rock the Cal students off the top
of the bus. Result: the buse 1 s
were almost tipped over, windows
were broken, air was removed
from the tires, hoods were dented
and a few students were injured.
With 1000 Stanford students in
Union Square and 2000 Cal stu
dents in the surrounding streets,
30 San Francisco policemen were
unable to keep streets clear and
stop the fighting between student
groups.
Last year Rally Com had to
plead with the band to get them
to participate. They were guar
anteed complete protection. The
result: reports Professor Shuch
at, director of the band, "The
trombones came out looking like
trumpets" and the other instru
ments were dented and damaged.
First Time
"It is the first year in a long
time without a San Francisco
Rally," said White. "It is really
too bad to eliminate tradition;
maybe next year something can
be done. I see no solution for this
year." The suggestion has been
made to move the reunions down
to the Peninsula next year. There
is a possibility of having a Big
Game Rally somewhere here on
the Peninsula.
Tim Hopkins, chairman of the
Bonfire, announced the appoint
ment of Bill Bradford as fresh
man chairman. The frosh will
begin gathering wood Nov. 7 to
build a 50-foot pyre.
Wood Delivery
John Flaherty and Bill Tieder
man will handle wood pickup
and delivery, Tom Eorly and Paul
Dougan will bo in charge of con
struction, Jim Mikailif will super
vise guarding and Chris Wharf
is directing publicity.
Freshman men will build the
fire while freshman women keep
the coffee pots brewing for Ihe
all-night Bonfire "big push" and
vigil.
