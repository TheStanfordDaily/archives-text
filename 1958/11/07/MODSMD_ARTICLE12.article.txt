lfi-14
Democrats have won Califor
nia's congressional delegation, 16-
14, as a last-minute official cor
rection in the vote count defeated
Mrs. Rudd Brown in Los Angeles'
21st district.
The corrected tally showed in
cumbent Republican Edgar Hie
stand defeated Mrs. Brown 121,104
to 116,687. The previous count had
her leading by about 3000 votes.
Mrs. Brown, 37-year-old grand
daughter of William Jennings
Bryan, was bidding to bo Califor
nia's first congresswoman since
Helen Gahagan Douglas was de
feated by Richard Nixon in 10,"i0.
Democrats appeared to have
won the state Senate by 27-13 and
the state Assembly by 50-30, near
ly complete unofficial returns
showed Thursday.
Absentee Ballots
However, four races- two in
each house —were so close that
absentee ballots could change the
result.
Assuming that absentee votes,
to be counted Nov. 1 1, gave all
four races to the GOP, the Demo
crats would still have their larg
est majorities in the Legislature
since 1883. They have not control
led both houses since 18S9.
