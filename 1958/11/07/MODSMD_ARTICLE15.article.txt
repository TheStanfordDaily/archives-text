## Reds Still Feel Barricade Need 
### 
The invective and violence with
which the Soviets are reacting to
the Nobel award to Boris Paster
nak for his great novel, "Doctor
Zhivago," is a fair measure of the
way the Kremlin still feels it
must barricade the minds of the
.Russian people.
To assess the fear and trem
bling with which the Soviet dic
tatorship views the Pasternak
novel, it is necessary to realize
that "Doctor Zhivago" is gentle
and muted criticism compared
with the slashing indictments of
aspects of American society in
the works of such U.S. writers in
the 'twenties and 'thirties as Up
ton Sinclair, John Dos Passos and
John Steinbeck.
"Doctor Zhivago" is not anti
revolutionary; it is pro-revolu
tionary. It is anti-Czarist ami
it is not pro-capitalist. It does
not attack the aims'of Commu
nism, but some of its methods.
It speaks for intellectual integ
rity and human freedom.
And the Kremlin finds it not
only unsafe for the Russians to
read it but unsafe for them to
view Pasternak with anything
but loathing— if the Kremlin can
put it over.
What do the Soviets fear from
Mr. Pasternak and his example of
fearless honesty?
They fear that, if Pasternak
goes unchastened, unsmeared,
and unpunished, too many oth
er writers and intellectuals will
assert similar freedom.
They fear that Pasternak's ex
ample of independence will be
catching.
They fear that in light of what
has happened in Hungary and
Poland any further growth in in
tellectual freedom, tentatively al
lowed during the de-Stalinization
period, might spread and under
mine the regime itself.
Therefore several hundred obe
dient writers and artists are
called together to pass resolu
tions — without even reading
what the condemned author has
written since his novel has never
been published in Russia — con
demning his work as a "malicious
squib," as "traitorous" and reac
tionary slander."
The Russians must remain
content —or at least remain—
looking out the barred windows

of the iron curtain while free
peoples elsewhere acclaim and
devour the superb historic nov
el by a Russian whose only
crime is that he breathes the
spirit of freedom.
It must wound the pride of
many Russians that the only way
they can know about the master
piece of one of their literary
greats is through the accounts
broadcast over the barrier of So
viet jamming by the Voice of
America and Radio Liberation in
the Russia n languages. The
"Voice" will soon broadcast a six
part series drawing heavily from
the novel.
"Doctor Zhivago" is not pri
marily propaganda. It is the cry
of a brave and honest man's soul
against the betrayal of the Rus
sian people's revolution against
Czarist repression and the substi
tution of a more evil and pervad
ing repression in its place.
At one point Pasternak writes:
"If the beast who sleeps in
man could be held down by
threats — any kind of threats,
whether of jail or of retribution
after death —then the highest
emblem of humanity would be
the lion tamer in the circus
with his' whip, not the prophet
who sacrificed himself. But
don't you see, this is just the
point—what has for centuries
raised man above the beast is
not the cudgel but an inward
music: the irresistible power of
unarmed truth, the powerful at
traction of its example."
And a character in "Doctor
Zhivago" muses:
"When the revolution woke
him up, he decided that his cen
tury-old dream was coming true —
his dream of living on his own
land by the work of his hands, in
complete independence and with
no obligations to anyone. Instead,
he found he had only exchanged
the oppression of the former state
for the new, much harsher yoke
of the revolutionary superstate.
Can you wonder that the villages
are restless and can't settle
down?"
So today Boris Pasternak lives
alone outside Moscow—not know
ing what will happen to him next.

"Doctor Zhivago" is not pri

of a brave and honest man's soul
against the betrayal of the Rus
sian people's revolution against
Czarist repression and the substi
tution of a more evil and pervad
ing repression in its place.
At one point Pasternak writes:
"If the beast who sleeps in
man could be held down by
threats — any kind of threats,
whether of jail or of retribution
after death —then the highest
emblem of humanity would be
the lion tamer in the circus
with his' whip, not the prophet
who sacrificed himself. But
don't you see, this is just the
point—what has for centuries
raised man above the beast is
not the cudgel but an inward
music: the irresistible power of
unarmed truth, the powerful at
traction of its example."
And a character in "Doctor
Zhivago" muses:
"When the revolution woke
him up, he decided that his cen
tury-old dream was coming true —
his dream of living on his own
land by the work of his hands, in
complete independence and with
no obligations to anyone. Instead,
he found he had only exchanged
the oppression of the former state
for the new, much harsher yoke
of the revolutionary superstate.
Can you wonder that the villages

The invective and violence with
which the Soviets are reacting to
the Nobel award to Boris Paster
nak for his great novel, "Doctor
Zhivago," is a fair measure of the
way the Kremlin still feels it
must barricade the minds of the
.Russian people.
To assess the fear and trem
bling with which the Soviet dic
tatorship views the Pasternak
novel, it is necessary to realize
that "Doctor Zhivago" is gentle
and muted criticism compared
with the slashing indictments of
aspects of American society in
the works of such U.S. writers in
the 'twenties and 'thirties as Up
ton Sinclair, John Dos Passos and
John Steinbeck.
"Doctor Zhivago" is not anti
revolutionary; it is pro-revolu
tionary. It is anti-Czarist ami
it is not pro-capitalist. It does
not attack the aims'of Commu
nism, but some of its methods.
It speaks for intellectual integ
rity and human freedom.
And the Kremlin finds it not
only unsafe for the Russians to
read it but unsafe for them to
view Pasternak with anything
but loathing— if the Kremlin can
put it over.
What do the Soviets fear from
Mr. Pasternak and his example of
fearless honesty?
They fear that, if Pasternak
goes unchastened, unsmeared,
and unpunished, too many oth
er writers and intellectuals will
assert similar freedom.
They fear that Pasternak's ex
ample of independence will be
catching.
They fear that in light of what
has happened in Hungary and
Poland any further growth in in
tellectual freedom, tentatively al
lowed during the de-Stalinization
period, might spread and under
mine the regime itself.
Therefore several hundred obe
dient writers and artists are
called together to pass resolu
tions — without even reading
what the condemned author has
written since his novel has never
been published in Russia — con
demning his work as a "malicious
squib," as "traitorous" and reac
tionary slander."

The invective and violence with
which the Soviets are reacting to
the Nobel award to Boris Paster
nak for his great novel, "Doctor
Zhivago," is a fair measure of the
way the Kremlin still feels it
must barricade the minds of the
.Russian people.
To assess the fear and trem
bling with which the Soviet dic
tatorship views the Pasternak
novel, it is necessary to realize
that "Doctor Zhivago" is gentle
and muted criticism compared
with the slashing indictments of
aspects of American society in
the works of such U.S. writers in
the 'twenties and 'thirties as Up
ton Sinclair, John Dos Passos and
John Steinbeck.
"Doctor Zhivago" is not anti
revolutionary; it is pro-revolu
tionary. It is anti-Czarist ami
it is not pro-capitalist. It does
not attack the aims'of Commu
nism, but some of its methods.
It speaks for intellectual integ
rity and human freedom.
And the Kremlin finds it not
only unsafe for the Russians to
read it but unsafe for them to
view Pasternak with anything
but loathing— if the Kremlin can
put it over.
What do the Soviets fear from
Mr. Pasternak and his example of
fearless honesty?
They fear that, if Pasternak
goes unchastened, unsmeared,
and unpunished, too many oth
er writers and intellectuals will
assert similar freedom.
They fear that Pasternak's ex
ample of independence will be
catching.
They fear that in light of what
has happened in Hungary and
Poland any further growth in in
tellectual freedom, tentatively al
lowed during the de-Stalinization
period, might spread and under
mine the regime itself.
Therefore several hundred obe
dient writers and artists are
called together to pass resolu
tions — without even reading
what the condemned author has
written since his novel has never
been published in Russia — con
demning his work as a "malicious
squib," as "traitorous" and reac
tionary slander."
The Russians must remain
content —or at least remain—
looking out the barred windows

of the iron curtain while free
peoples elsewhere acclaim and
devour the superb historic nov
el by a Russian whose only
crime is that he breathes the
spirit of freedom.
It must wound the pride of
many Russians that the only way
they can know about the master
piece of one of their literary
greats is through the accounts
broadcast over the barrier of So
viet jamming by the Voice of
America and Radio Liberation in
the Russia n languages. The
"Voice" will soon broadcast a six
part series drawing heavily from
the novel.
"Doctor Zhivago" is not pri
marily propaganda. It is the cry
of a brave and honest man's soul
against the betrayal of the Rus
sian people's revolution against
Czarist repression and the substi
tution of a more evil and pervad
ing repression in its place.
At one point Pasternak writes:
"If the beast who sleeps in
man could be held down by
threats — any kind of threats,
whether of jail or of retribution
after death —then the highest
emblem of humanity would be
the lion tamer in the circus
with his' whip, not the prophet
who sacrificed himself. But
don't you see, this is just the
point—what has for centuries
raised man above the beast is
not the cudgel but an inward
music: the irresistible power of
unarmed truth, the powerful at
traction of its example."
And a character in "Doctor
Zhivago" muses:
"When the revolution woke
him up, he decided that his cen
tury-old dream was coming true —
his dream of living on his own
land by the work of his hands, in
complete independence and with
no obligations to anyone. Instead,
he found he had only exchanged
the oppression of the former state
for the new, much harsher yoke
of the revolutionary superstate.
Can you wonder that the villages
are restless and can't settle
down?"
So today Boris Pasternak lives
alone outside Moscow—not know
ing what will happen to him next.
