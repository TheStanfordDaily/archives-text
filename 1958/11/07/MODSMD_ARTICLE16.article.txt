## Many, Many Cats! 
### Marilyn Moore 
Did you know that this is the
end of National Cat Week? The
Penn State Daily Collegian re
ports that the cat has jumped
from 12th to second place in pri
ority as a pet, and that 21 million
furry felines now inhabit Ameri
can homes — an average of 1.2
cats per family.
It's really a shame more wasn't
done to celebrate this important
week in grand style at Stanford;
perhaps we should have invited
a few over to the dorm for din
ner- on guest night, or hosted an
"exchange" between a chapter of
the Tau Omega Mu's (TOM's)
and some she-cats. Yes, we really
missed an opportunity.
Now even NURSERY RHYMES
have hidden meanings. A Freu
dian interpretation of the poem
"Little Boy Blue" is the subject
of an article in the Akron Buch
telite. "This boy is sick," it says.
'"Being very neurotic, he barges
about in a dream world instead of
doing his job. He cannot accept
reality, and so he compensates by
mythical experience." The feature
also discusses the "frustrated
style" of the poet, the "symbol
ism" of the haystack and meadow,
and the meaning behind the "poor
lad's coloring." Any comments
from the Sociology Department?

"Yale rowing crews in 1866
kept in shape by eating beef and
mutton 'with blood running from

baths for three or more weeks pre
ceding a race." This bit of infor
mation is included in a new book
written by a P.E. professor (that's
what it says) at UCLA entitled
"Scientific Basis of Athletic Train

A male figure dressed in gray
tights and jacket, black mask and
gray Stetson, standing motionless

Girls, how would you like to come
in al 2:30 a.m. and be greeted by
something like THAT?
Ah, luxury! Now it's private
telephones for all women who
wish them at the U. of Con

head in horror while visualizing
the noise of multitudinous tele
phones ringing simultaneously,
read on. The Women's Council

each one. What a life . . .
We hear that in a classroom in
the bio-chemistry virus lab at Cal
there are two "No Smoking" signs
painted on the walls, and on the

small sign reading "Please Do Not

Did you know that this is the
end of National Cat Week? The
Penn State Daily Collegian re
ports that the cat has jumped
from 12th to second place in pri
ority as a pet, and that 21 million
furry felines now inhabit Ameri

cats per family.
It's really a shame more wasn't
done to celebrate this important
week in grand style at Stanford;
perhaps we should have invited
a few over to the dorm for din

"exchange" between a chapter of
the Tau Omega Mu's (TOM's)
and some she-cats. Yes, we really
missed an opportunity.
Now even NURSERY RHYMES
have hidden meanings. A Freu

"Little Boy Blue" is the subject
of an article in the Akron Buch
telite. "This boy is sick," it says.
'"Being very neurotic, he barges
about in a dream world instead of
doing his job. He cannot accept
reality, and so he compensates by
mythical experience." The feature
also discusses the "frustrated
style" of the poet, the "symbol

and the meaning behind the "poor
lad's coloring." Any comments
