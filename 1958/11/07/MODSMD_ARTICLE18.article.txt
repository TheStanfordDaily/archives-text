More Freedom
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to correct some errors in
The Daily of Nov. 5.
I did not say that in Yugoslavia
"at one time the students them
selves governed many university
affairs, but since the Communist
rule this freedom has largely been
removed."
Furthermore, this statement is
completely untrue. Under the
present government, Yugoslav
students have more to say about
university life than at any time
in the past. In fact, at the Uni
versity of Ljubljana the student
body has more influence in the
university affairs than they have,
in my observation, at Stanford.
Student body has representatives
on the Faculty Council and the
Board of Trustees, besides the
complete independent stud en t
government institutions.
Mile Cucek
College Press
Editor, The Daily:
The recent editorial "The Stu
dent Press" presents a well-rea
soned argument for freedom of
the college press. In universities
where a responsible, mature staff
edits the paper, realizing that they
constitute a total monopoly and
that the paper belongs to all the
students and is read and paid for
by all of them, I lien freedom of
the press is their just due.
Too often, however, just the op
posite is the case. At one of the
northern PCC schools that prides
itself on its journalism depart
ment, and has complete freedom

of the press, a very small faction
of the student body, in order to
bulwark their hold on campus of
fices and honors has for the past
several years used the university
paper as a tool to keep these
honors and offices within that
tight-knit group.
A self-perpetuating staff from
this group runs the paper, and
journalism students outside the
group are denied responsible edi
torial positions.
Early in the year candidates for
the major student body positions
are built up for the spring elec
tions, and strong opposing candi
dates are ignored or vilified.
The use of the student press,
the petition system and certain
major student body offices effec
tively perpetuate policies of this
group. An attempt last spring to
amend the constitution to demo
cratically elect students to the
student senate (patterned after
Stanford's method) was vigorous
ly fought in the student press,
and the logical candidate for stu
dent body president was several
times singled out for editorial
abuse months before the elections.
At a Publications Board hearing
last spring the board absolved
themselves of the above and other
charges, pleading freedom of the
press.
It seems to me that freedom of
the press is indivisible with a
sense of responsibility to the en
lire student body, and where that
responsibility is not felt, perhaps
it should be emphasized by out
side forces.

honors and offices within that
tight-knit group.
A self-perpetuating staff from
this group runs the paper, and
journalism students outside the
group are denied responsible edi
torial positions.
Early in the year candidates for
the major student body positions
are built up for the spring elec
tions, and strong opposing candi
dates are ignored or vilified.
The use of the student press,
the petition system and certain
major student body offices effec
tively perpetuate policies of this
group. An attempt last spring to
amend the constitution to demo
cratically elect students to the
student senate (patterned after
Stanford's method) was vigorous
ly fought in the student press,
and the logical candidate for stu
dent body president was several
times singled out for editorial
abuse months before the elections.
At a Publications Board hearing
last spring the board absolved
themselves of the above and other
charges, pleading freedom of the
press.
It seems to me that freedom of
the press is indivisible with a
sense of responsibility to the en
lire student body, and where that
responsibility is not felt, perhaps
it should be emphasized by out
side forces.

I did not say that in Yugoslavia
"at one time the students them
selves governed many university
affairs, but since the Communist
rule this freedom has largely been
removed."
Furthermore, this statement is
completely untrue. Under the
present government, Yugoslav
students have more to say about
university life than at any time
in the past. In fact, at the Uni
versity of Ljubljana the student
body has more influence in the
university affairs than they have,
in my observation, at Stanford.
Student body has representatives
on the Faculty Council and the
Board of Trustees, besides the
complete independent stud en t
government institutions.

The recent editorial "The Stu
dent Press" presents a well-rea
soned argument for freedom of
the college press. In universities
where a responsible, mature staff
edits the paper, realizing that they
constitute a total monopoly and
that the paper belongs to all the
students and is read and paid for
by all of them, I lien freedom of
the press is their just due.
Too often, however, just the op
posite is the case. At one of the
northern PCC schools that prides
itself on its journalism depart
ment, and has complete freedom

of the press, a very small faction
of the student body, in order to
bulwark their hold on campus of
fices and honors has for the past
several years used the university
paper as a tool to keep these
