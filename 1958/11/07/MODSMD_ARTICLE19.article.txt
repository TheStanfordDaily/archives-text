## 'Wild Duck' Effective Play 
### A Review By Jerome Clinton 
"The Wild Duck," performed by
the Playhouse Company, Beach
and Hyde, San Francisco, is a vital
drama written by Henrik Ibsen, a
playwright of unexcelled stature.
It deals with the recurrent theme
of the weak man who must sus
tain his life through belief in some
saving lie, and the disastrous ef
fects that a forced exposure of his
self-deception will have on him
and those who depend upon him.
The subject is essentially the
same as that of the more recent
drama "The Iceman Cometh," but
Ibsen has dealt with it far more
effectively than has Eugene
O'Neill. He has unified the struc
ture of his play by centering the
dramatic action within a single
family bound together by the nor
mal ties of love and dependence,
rather than on O'Neill's carnival
sideshow of characters held to
gether only by contiguity and their
mutual degradation. In addition
the setting of a normal family em
phasizes the horror of the moral
degradation of the protagonist and
lends a note of universality to the
human experience which it por

trays that is utterly lacking in the
later work.
Excellent Show
The Playhouse Company has
done an excellent job in its pro
duction of the play. The perform
ance of Ted Samuel as Hjalmar
Ekdal is particularly good. He suc
ceeds in presenting the essential
meanness of Hjalmar as well as
his egotistic, fatuous pomposity,
while still retaining the wonder
ful, boyish charm that can be the
only excuse for the continued de
votion of his family.
Ann Sielstad as Gina Ekdal
gives a fine performance of the
wife of inferior social status whose
quiet endurance is the mainstay
of the family and who is still en
chanted by her husband, although
she knows him far better than he
does himself. The performance of
Magnus Wardrop as Gregers
Werle, the man whose "inflamed
conscience" compels him to inflict
his particular truth on the Ekdal
household, is occasionally convinc
ing, but he maintains too even and
continuous a level of madness to
be thoroughly so.
The supporting roles are gen
erally well acted, although Peter
Dau seems almost too youthful in
the role of the aging, worldly Dr.

Relling, and Kermit Sheets' por
trayal of old Werle, in the first
scene, is unfortunately wooden.
Sets Appropriate
The sets are quite adequate; the
conspicuous yet unobtrusive posi
tion of the entrance to the attic
home of the wild duck is particu
larly fortuitous. And the studio
living room of the Ekdal home ap
pears wholly appropriate and au
thentic. The costuming is equally
good, although Gina's dress is un
necessarily shabby.
The direction of Dion Chesse is
very good. lie brings out the bril
liantly humorous aspects of the
play without sacrificing its seri
ous intent and emphasizes Ibsen's
quite obvious symbolism as an im
portant but necessarily subordi
nate adjunct to the plot. One im
mediately realizes that it is only
the abnormal Gregers Werle, who
distorts the natural significance
of the wild duck into an inflamed
and horrifying symbol of freedom
to be sacrificed on t he altar of self
less devotion.
The product on moves easily and
well and achieves the appropriate
pitch of dramatic intensity in each
scene. It is a thoroughly satisfy
ing production.


The reality of the world situation jolted Stanford-in-Germany stu
dents on their recent trip to Berlin. One of the signs which greeted
them were the pictures of Marx, lOngels and Lenin, above left, in
the Marx-Engels I'lat/ in the East Sector of Berlin. The old Palace
of Berlin was torn down by the Communists after the war to make
room for this square to celebrate May Day and other important
occasions. Above right, students viewed the vast construction in
the West Sector of Berlin. Lower right, the students studied the
plan of Interbau-Ausstelung before going out to study the archi
tecture for themselves. This modern new housing development
stands not far from the ruins of the Reichstag. Fifty-two inter
nal ionnlly-known architects are participating in the construction
of 48 different structures.
