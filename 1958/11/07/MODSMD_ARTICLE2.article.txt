# Witty Savant Will 'Explain' Management
## 
### 
The "Law" will be laid down
tonight—Parkinson's Law, that is,
which governs everything from
why management always increas
es personnel and never reduces it
to how VlP's move at cocktail
parties — when British professor
C. Northcote Parkinson speaks in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 7:30.
The witty historian will discuss
his book "Parkinson's Law," a
best seller last year, which satir
izes the way management man
ages to manage. Tickets for the
talk are on sale at Rooms 121-3,
Encina Ilall, or the Dinkelspiel
box office for 50 cents.
Parkinson is actually a scholar
who branched out into a brand
new field. An expert on naval
history, he was graduated from
Cambridge, has taught at the
Royal Naval College and the Uni
versity of Liverpool and is cur
rently the Raffles professor of
history at the University of Ma
laya.
Parkinson is also the author of
less popular but more academic
historical works. His latest book,
"The Evolution of Political
Thought," has just been published
in this country.
