It has been said that Stanford
University has done more for U.S.
fisheries than any other educa
tional institution in the United
States.
Much of this is due to the first
president of the University, Dr.
David Starr Jordan, who was one
of the most prominent men in
that field. According to Dr. Vic
tor C. Twitty, executive head of
the biology department, Stanford
is among the first two or three
in the nation concerned with the
classification and study of fish.
Hopkins Marine Station, locat
ed at Pacific Grove, is a division
of the department. Here much re
search is carried on in this field.
It was originally erected through
a gift of Timothy Hopkins and its
first course was offered in 1892.
The station has an extensive
teaching program during the
summer in marine biology. Its
facilities consist of tanks for the
observation of captive marine an
imals, including also a boat for
dredging and the collection of
specimens. The boat is also used
in oceanography.
No department is complete
without its humorous aspects.
One of them occurred at the time
of the earthquake in 1906 when
the statue of Louis Agassiz, un
der whom Jordan had studied and
whose statue is one of the pair
on Jordan Hall, fell off head-first
and was undamaged. On seeing
the sight, Jordan exclaimed, "I

I ilways knew Agassiz was hard
leaded."
The biology department has
hree divisions, Jordan Hall, the
Matural History Museum and the
Hopkins Marine Station.
In Jordan Hall are located, ac
cording to Twitty, "an outstand
ng library and fine research
aquipment." Originally the 60-
foot vestibule with the column
supported balcony and skylight
was intended for mounting the
skeletons of huge prehistoric ani
mals.
The Natural History Museum
at the rear of the museum houses
a collection of higher plants and
and fishes and is "one of the larg
est and most important museum
collections in the world," stated
Twitty.
There are many fields open to
these who earn their A.B. degree
in biology. According to Twitty,
many of those majoring in biol
ogy eventually go into teaching.
There are also positions available
in industry in such branches as
biochemistry, pharmaceutical and
research.
The study of micro-organisms
is becoming more and more im

portant, also such fields as fungi
and antibiotics. The department
also gives basic training for con
servation and wildlife manage
ment in which are needed biolo
gists who are experienced in
planting and hatcheries.
To major in biology the student
will take six one quarter courses
in the basic branches of biology
plus 10 units of electives in
some biological field. Also re
quired is a certain amount of
physical sciences.
With arrival of the new med
ical school on campus there will
be an enrollment of pre-med stu
dents in the advanced biology
courses as part'of the new five
year program. The faculty of the
school will also increase the popu
lation of prominent biologists on
campus.
Several of the member's of the
biology department are scholars
of international reputation, in
cluding three members of the Na
tional Academy of Scientists, the
highest honor that can be received
by a scientist.
