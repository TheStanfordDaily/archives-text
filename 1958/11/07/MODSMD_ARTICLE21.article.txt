WASHINGTON UP)—Senate in

consider court action to break up
the giant General Motors Corp.
In a majority report, the Demo
cratic members of the Antitrust

neither compatible with nor con
ducive to a free market in which
the public must buy automobiles."

toward an industry merely be
cause of its success and good
earnings."
