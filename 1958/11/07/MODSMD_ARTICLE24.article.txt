### 
"Sweet 'n' Spicy" will be the
theme of the annual Branner semi
formal dance to be held tonight
from 9 to 1 in the Branner lounge.
The dance is open to Branner
girls only, but special invitations
are offered to the hashers.
"The decorations will follow the
candy theme," said Diane Gaylor,
publicity chairman, "and George
Yamasaki's band will provide the
music." Sue Hodgeman is the
general chairman of the dance.
Dean and Mrs. Winbigler will
be the honored guests.
