## The 						Stanford Daily SPORT SCENE Harriers to Face Tough Cal, UCLA 
### 
The season's toughest test â€”
worse, even, than last week's
meet with USC faces the Stan
ford harriers Saturday at 10 a.m.
on the California course.
Payton Jordan's fast-improving
club will face Cal and UCLA in
what stacks up now as a toss-up
meet. Stanford will be seeking
revenge against both clubs.
Last week, the Cards and Cal
tried in quadrangular scoring in
a race here, but the Bears won in
dual scoring by one point. Down
south two weeks ago, Ihe Bruins
topped Stanford by five points in
triangular scoring and three in
the dual meet.
Better Foes
Stanford will be trying to keep
up the impetus it gathered last
week in its upset victory over
USC. But the Cards will be facing
two foes which have thus far dis
played better team running abil
ity than the Trojans, despite
Troy's having the best individual
malerial.
UCLA's Ken Riding and Stan
ford's Keith Wallace should be
on top in the fight for individual
honors, although the home course
advantage could help Roger Price
and Bob Gaylord of Cal.
Jordan is still unsure as to
whether Larry Suelzle will be
able to go for the Indians. He's
been out with a foot injury sus
tained two weeks ago; his absence

last week probably cost the In
dians the loss to Cal.
The rest of the Stanford entries
will be Doug Martin, Bob Mon
zingo, John Northway, A 1 Ahu
mada and Kim Maxwell. If the
first three run back to their out
standing performances of last
week, the Indians will be in good
shape.
Low Men Must Place
But with five men figuring in
the scoring, either Ahumada or
Maxwell will have to come
through with better races than
last week if the Cards are to fin
ish with low score.
Thus far in '58, the Indians
have beaten the Air Force, lost a
triangular to USC and UCLA, and
lied for first in the USC-Cal-San
Jose quadrangular, though los
ing the dual to Cal.
