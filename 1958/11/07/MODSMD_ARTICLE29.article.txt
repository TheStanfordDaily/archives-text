# Card Booters After Win No. 4

### 
The Stanford varsity soccer
team, coming off a weekend that
saw them tie San Francisco State
in a hard-fought, down-to-the-wire
contest, faces tough City College
of San Francisco this Saturday at
Balboa Field in San Francisco.
According to Coach Fred Prid
dle, Stanford may find CCSF its
most formidable opponent in
what is proving to be a successful
season. The Indians bring a 3-1
record into the contest.
Last week's stars in the S.F.
State game were center forward
Dick Bartlett, who scored both
Stanford goals, goalie Bill Ditt
man and left fullback Don Far
thing, a freshman. The Indians
were leading S.F. State 2-1 with
about 10 seconds remaining in
the game when State offensive
star Stan Sarsfield attempted a
last-ditch score. The final whistle
blew with the ball still in the air,
but the goal was good and it tied
the score.
