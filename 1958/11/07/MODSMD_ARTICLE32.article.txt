### Russ Allen 
A new face on t he Stanford foot
ball scene is assistant coach Andy
Everest who came with head
mentor Cactus Jack Curtice from
Utah last spring. Everest is the
only aide that Curtice brought
with him, and the assistant helps
him with scouting reports and
coaching the Card guards and
centers.
Happily settled near Mountain
View with wife, three sons and a
daughter, Everest remarked that
excessive moving around has been
his chief complaint in his short
coaching career. After college, he
moved to and from four different
towns in four corners of the state
of Texas, coaching high school
football.
This does not mean to imply
that he was chased out because
of his teams' poor showing for he
had some very successful sea
sons. He did so well that his old

coach Jack Curtice asked him to
join the staff at Utah in 1953.
Andy was head frosh coach and
assistant varsity coach for' the
Utes and his frosh teams won 15,
lost four, and tied one.
Everest started his college foot
ball while playing under his pres
ent boss in 1948 at Texas West
ern. lie played center in '48, '49
and '50 and was captain of the
team in 1950. Andy was definitely
a standout in a line which pushed
Texas Western to the top in the
national standings for rushing in
both '48 and '49.
Everest is a veteran of World
War II and was born in Wichita
Falls, Texas, Oct. 27, 1924.
He graduated from Texas West
ern with an A.B. degree in physi
cal education in 1950 and got his
M.A. in administrative education
in 1951. He had an outstanding
record as an undergraduate both
in the classroom and in extracur
ricular activities.
