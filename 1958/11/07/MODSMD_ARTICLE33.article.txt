### Jan Stypula 
League • leading Oregon State
draws a tough assignment when
it travels to Pullman tomorrow to
face Washington State, as the Pa
cific.' Coast Conference's last Race
for the Hose Bowl comes down
the stretch.
California, knocked off the top
by OSC last week, hosts a stag
gering UCLA eleven; Southern
j California meets Washington on
the Trojan home grounds and
Oregon entertains Stanford in the
I Rain Country at Eugene.
Idaho, reeling from its shock
! ing 41-6 loss to San Jose State last
I week, faces Montana in a tradi
i tional encounter.
Five Teams in Kace
With five teams still mathemat
ically in Rose Bowl contention,
the Beaver-Cougar clash looms as
possibly the conference "crucial"
of the season. An Oregon State
; victory would < 1 > eliminate WSC
from contention, and (2t give the
j Beavers a big advantage with pos
sibly their toughesi remaining
| game out of the way.
After a hot and-cold start, OSC
has picked up steam with three
I successive wins, the last one a
i 14-8 triumph over rampaging Cal.
But the Beavers are straying
from their friendly home grounds
this week and they have beaten
only Idaho away from home.
WSC comes off its 38-20 shel
lacking over UCLA in Los Ange
i les last week. This victory is es
pecially significant for Jim Suth
i erland's Cougars as it marked
I the first time they have broken
! loose offensively since their great
quarterback, Bob Newman, was
injured four weeks ago. It broke
a string of three consecutive one
touc-hdown games for the usually
! explosive Cougars, who had
struck pay dirt 12 times in their
first three games, with Newman
at the helm.
Kapp Leads Cal
Joe Kapp and Cal will attempt
to get back on their- feet against
the weakened Bruins. UCLA's
hopes were bolstered by the re
turn of their sensational sopho
more tailback, Bill Kilmer, in
jured against Florida, and the
Bruins are pointing for a major
upset that would sidetrack the
Bears' Pasadena aspirations.
At Los Angeles, USC will seek
its third straight win as it fights

*o keep its Bowl hopes alive.
vVashington, the only team the
J'rojans were able to beat last
•season, is fresh off a (!-<) upset
over Oregon. This was the Hus
kies' first loop triumph of the
campaign.

JSC, 3-2, and Stanford, 2-2. USC
