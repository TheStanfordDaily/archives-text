# Tribe Cagers Practice
## 
### Ray Harrington 
Next year is here for Stanford
basketball fans. Since 1942 Big
Red rage supporters have been
saying, "Just wait until next
year." That year may have final
ly arrived.
For the first time since Coach
Howie Dullmar has been coaching
Stanford, the Indians are rated to
finish near the top of the Pacific-
Coast Conference. The big rea
son for the high ranking is the re
urn of last season's starting five:
3 aul Neumann, Dick Haga, John
Arrillaga, Doug Warren and Jer
y Theusen. This team upset the
Diversity of San Francisco and
"nished very strong in the FCC
ace. They hope to pick up this
/ear where they left off.
Need Kehounders
Coach Dallmar feels that the
learn needs more work on re
bounding. The 1 *)f>7 Cards were
eight in conference rebounding,
with only last-place Washington
State lower. This year's team will
have to give an average of three
inches per man to conference
foes, and to compensate for this
lack of height the Redmen will
have to "jump fast and jump
high," Dallmar said.
The Tribe mentor thinks this
year's team will be better than
last year's squad because it is
more experienced and the Cards
have developed into "very accu
rate shooters."
Tabbed as the team to beat in
the conference is the University
of Washington. The Huskies have
possibly the best one-two combi
nation in college basketball. Doug
