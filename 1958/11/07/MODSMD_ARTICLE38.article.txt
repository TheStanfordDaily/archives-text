# ASSU Credit Diminishing At Blood Bank
## 
### Catherine Hatch 
"Our credit is running out at
the Blood Bank and wo need do
nors. The bloodmobile will be at
the Elks' Club in Palo Alto on
Saturday," said Dr. George H.
Houck, director, Student Health
Service.
According to Dr. Houck, the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University has credit for blood at
the Peninsula Memorial Blood
Bank in Burlingame, The only
stipulation is that it be replaced
by either the repicient or a friend
or relative.
At the present time, there are
only nine units of blood on de
posit for the ASSU due to a large
number of units used during the
summer quarter which have not
been replaced. These units must
be replaced within six months,
hence the need for blood donors.
Dr. Houck stressed the sim
plicity of giving blood. The Pe
ninsula Memorial Blood Bank has
a bloodmobile — the one which
will be in Palo Alto on Saturday—
and the whole process takes no
more than 30 minutes.
On entering the bloodmobile,
donors will have their tempera
ture, pulse, blood pressure and
hemoglobin checked. The donor's
medical history is also taken,
since those with a history of cer
tain diseases arc rejected. Donors
must be between the ages of 18
and 61; and those between 18 and
21 must have the written permis
sion of one parent.
Once accepted, the donor rests
comfortably on a bed while a hol
low needle is inserted into a vein
and the blood is drawn into a 500-
cc. sterile vacuum bottle. An ad
ditional test tube full is drawn to
be used for the various tests. A
rest period of 15 minutes follows
during which time coffee or tea
and cookies are served, Dr. Houck
explained.
As soon as the blood is with
drawn from the donor, it is tested
and typed under sterile conditions
by expert technicians. Once test
ed and typed, the blood is depos
ited in a i-efrigeration compart
ment at 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
Whole blood may be preserved
for 21 days. In all outdated blood
the red cells are removed and the
remaining plasma preserved.
From 500 cc. of blood, 250 cc. of
plasma is obtained.
For those without credit at the
blood bank, the cost for whole
blood would be $30 per pint, for
plasma $32.50. The Stanford Uni
versity student does not have this
cost to meet as long as the ASSU
is able to keep the deposits and
withdrawals balancing.

At the present time, there are
only nine units of blood on de
posit for the ASSU due to a large
number of units used during the
summer quarter which have not
been replaced. These units must
be replaced within six months,
hence the need for blood donors.
Dr. Houck stressed the sim
plicity of giving blood. The Pe
ninsula Memorial Blood Bank has
a bloodmobile — the one which
will be in Palo Alto on Saturday—
and the whole process takes no
more than 30 minutes.
On entering the bloodmobile,
donors will have their tempera
ture, pulse, blood pressure and
hemoglobin checked. The donor's
medical history is also taken,
since those with a history of cer
tain diseases arc rejected. Donors
must be between the ages of 18
and 61; and those between 18 and
21 must have the written permis
sion of one parent.
Once accepted, the donor rests
comfortably on a bed while a hol
low needle is inserted into a vein
and the blood is drawn into a 500-
cc. sterile vacuum bottle. An ad
ditional test tube full is drawn to
be used for the various tests. A
rest period of 15 minutes follows
during which time coffee or tea
and cookies are served, Dr. Houck
explained.
As soon as the blood is with
drawn from the donor, it is tested
and typed under sterile conditions
by expert technicians. Once test
ed and typed, the blood is depos
ited in a i-efrigeration compart
ment at 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
Whole blood may be preserved
for 21 days. In all outdated blood
the red cells are removed and the
remaining plasma preserved.
From 500 cc. of blood, 250 cc. of
plasma is obtained.
For those without credit at the
blood bank, the cost for whole
blood would be $30 per pint, for
plasma $32.50. The Stanford Uni
versity student does not have this
cost to meet as long as the ASSU
is able to keep the deposits and
withdrawals balancing.
"Our credit is running out at
the Blood Bank and wo need do
nors. The bloodmobile will be at
the Elks' Club in Palo Alto on
Saturday," said Dr. George H.
Houck, director, Student Health
Service.
According to Dr. Houck, the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University has credit for blood at
the Peninsula Memorial Blood
Bank in Burlingame, The only
stipulation is that it be replaced
by either the repicient or a friend
or relative.
