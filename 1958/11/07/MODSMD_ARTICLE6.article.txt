Daily.)
Stanford's traveling Tribe of 37
Indians hoard their big silver bird
at 10 a.m. today at San Francisco
International Airport bound for a
Duck-hunting trip in Eugene, Ore.,
Saturday. And they won't even
have their big gun with them.
Halfback Rick McMillen, who,
it was hoped, would be able to
whip back into shape for this
week's game, will not make the
trip north with the Cards. He
hasn't been able to snap back
from his early-season ankle in-

jury, and after running fairly
hard Tuesday and Wednesday he
came up with a swollen ankle and
leg Thursday which edged him
out of competition.
Head coach Jack Curtice hadn't
figured to have McMillen as a
starter against Len Casanova's
Webfoots. but it would have been
a relief to have the power runner
along and ready to see some ac
tion.
Jim Byrer and Skip Face will
operate in McMillen's spot. Byrer
will no doubt get the starting nod,
with Face preparerfTo split play
ing time with him.
Changes necessitated by McMil
len's absence were expected, but
Curtice was forced to come up
with another couple of changes in
preparing for the northerners.
With wingback John Bond out
of action, Curtice has been look
ing at Dick Bowers, Bill Donohue
and Fred Bernadotti in this slot.
Bowers has run the most at the
position and should be Curtice's
starter there.
The always - a - toss-up quarter
back selection for this week looks
like it's been grabbed off by jun
ior Sid Garber. He has worked
with Stanford's first unit all week
and has been consistently precise
in his passing while showing some
impressive r un n in g determina
tion.
Behind Garber are, of course,
senior Bob Nieolet and sophomore
Dick Norman. Norman has work
ed with the second unit and gets
the No. 2 nod, though particular
situations will be the main factors
in quarterback substitutions.
In the line Curtice has made
two changes. Doug Pursell will
start for Roch Conklin at center,
and Jim Ukropina will replace Irv
Nikolai at left end. Conklin has
been hampered by a neck and
shoulders muscle strain. He will
make the trip, but probably will
see only limited action.
Ukropina's promotion comes on
the strength of his fine effort
against Southern California last
week and also Curtice's desire to
play the senior more than he has.
Otherwise, Curtice will go with
the same men he started against

the Trojans last week: Troy Bar
bee and Eric Protiva at tackles,
Don Dawson and Bob Peterson at
guards, Chris Burford at right
end and Doug Dick at fullback.
Injuries weren't the whole story
in the Stanford village this week,
though; there were a few recov
eries of note. Fullback Gil Dowd
has shown he will be running
oftener at the fullback post, and
guard Larry Lacey and tackle Phil
Burkland have come along to the
point where they will lend assist
ance come Saturday.
Neither squad will go into this
week's game with a too impres
sive a season record. Oregon is
2-4, Stanford 2-5. There are other

records, though, that may tell the
game's tale, and three of these
are the Ducks' defense marks
against the opposition this year.
Oregon leads the conference in
all defensive categories and looks
back on clipping the Oklahoma
running attack short at 129 yards,
while holding the supposedly top
notch Bobby Newman-Washing
ton State aerial circus to just
over 100 yards.
The Ducks' two wins were scor
ed over the Idaho Vandals, 27-0,
and Southern Cal, 25-0. They've
been topped by Oklahoma, Wash
ington and Washington State, all
6-0, and Cal, 23-6.
The Webfoot squad is highlight
ed by speedy halfbacks Willie
West and Charlie Tourville. West
is considered the one man who
could do* the Injuns in, as Tour
ville is a doubtful starter at this
writing.
Casanova has had his problems
this week in the replacement line.
Ends Ron Stover and Alden Kim
brough will probably not start, so
the Ducks will have two second
unit men out for passes.
That strong line will be intact,
though, spurred on by guards Bob
Grottkau and Will Reeve, center
Bob Peterson and tackle Jim
Linden.

ior Sid Garber. He has worked
with Stanford's first unit all week
and has been consistently precise
in his passing while showing some
impressive r un n in g determina
tion.
Behind Garber are, of course,
senior Bob Nieolet and sophomore
Dick Norman. Norman has work
ed with the second unit and gets
the No. 2 nod, though particular
situations will be the main factors
in quarterback substitutions.
In the line Curtice has made
two changes. Doug Pursell will
start for Roch Conklin at center,
and Jim Ukropina will replace Irv
Nikolai at left end. Conklin has
been hampered by a neck and
shoulders muscle strain. He will
make the trip, but probably will
see only limited action.
Ukropina's promotion comes on
the strength of his fine effort
against Southern California last
week and also Curtice's desire to
play the senior more than he has.
Otherwise, Curtice will go with
the same men he started against

the Trojans last week: Troy Bar
bee and Eric Protiva at tackles,
Don Dawson and Bob Peterson at
guards, Chris Burford at right
end and Doug Dick at fullback.
Injuries weren't the whole story
in the Stanford village this week,
though; there were a few recov
eries of note. Fullback Gil Dowd
has shown he will be running
oftener at the fullback post, and
guard Larry Lacey and tackle Phil
Burkland have come along to the
point where they will lend assist
ance come Saturday.
Neither squad will go into this
week's game with a too impres
sive a season record. Oregon is
2-4, Stanford 2-5. There are other

records, though, that may tell the
game's tale, and three of these
are the Ducks' defense marks
against the opposition this year.
Oregon leads the conference in
all defensive categories and looks
back on clipping the Oklahoma
running attack short at 129 yards,
while holding the supposedly top
notch Bobby Newman-Washing
ton State aerial circus to just
over 100 yards.
The Ducks' two wins were scor
ed over the Idaho Vandals, 27-0,
and Southern Cal, 25-0. They've
been topped by Oklahoma, Wash
ington and Washington State, all
6-0, and Cal, 23-6.
The Webfoot squad is highlight
ed by speedy halfbacks Willie
West and Charlie Tourville. West
is considered the one man who
could do* the Injuns in, as Tour
ville is a doubtful starter at this
writing.
Casanova has had his problems
this week in the replacement line.
Ends Ron Stover and Alden Kim
brough will probably not start, so
the Ducks will have two second
unit men out for passes.
That strong line will be intact,
though, spurred on by guards Bob
Grottkau and Will Reeve, center
Bob Peterson and tackle Jim
Linden.

Stanford's traveling Tribe of 37
Indians hoard their big silver bird
at 10 a.m. today at San Francisco
International Airport bound for a
Duck-hunting trip in Eugene, Ore.,
Saturday. And they won't even
have their big gun with them.
Halfback Rick McMillen, who,
it was hoped, would be able to
whip back into shape for this
week's game, will not make the
trip north with the Cards. He
hasn't been able to snap back
from his early-season ankle in-

jury, and after running fairly
hard Tuesday and Wednesday he
came up with a swollen ankle and
leg Thursday which edged him
out of competition.
Head coach Jack Curtice hadn't
figured to have McMillen as a
starter against Len Casanova's
Webfoots. but it would have been
a relief to have the power runner
along and ready to see some ac
tion.
Jim Byrer and Skip Face will
operate in McMillen's spot. Byrer
will no doubt get the starting nod,
with Face preparerfTo split play
ing time with him.
Changes necessitated by McMil
len's absence were expected, but
Curtice was forced to come up
with another couple of changes in
preparing for the northerners.
With wingback John Bond out
of action, Curtice has been look

and Fred Bernadotti in this slot.
Bowers has run the most at the
position and should be Curtice's
starter there.

running attack short at 129 yards,
while holding the supposedly top
notch Bobby Newman-Washing
ton State aerial circus to just
over 100 yards.
The Ducks' two wins were scor
ed over the Idaho Vandals, 27-0,
and Southern Cal, 25-0. They've
been topped by Oklahoma, Wash

6-0, and Cal, 23-6.
The Webfoot squad is highlight
ed by speedy halfbacks Willie
West and Charlie Tourville. West
is considered the one man who
could do* the Injuns in, as Tour
ville is a doubtful starter at this
writing.
Casanova has had his problems
this week in the replacement line.
Ends Ron Stover and Alden Kim
brough will probably not start, so
the Ducks will have two second
unit men out for passes.
That strong line will be intact,
though, spurred on by guards Bob
Grottkau and Will Reeve, center
Bob Peterson and tackle Jim
Linden.

OREGON HALFBACK WILLIE WEST
Fleet Webfoot breakaway threat
(Editor's Note: Daily sports
editor Steve Bafirry will travel
with the Stanford (earn to Ku
gene, Ore., to provide The Daily
with on-the-spot coverage of
Saturday's football {fame. His
report will appear in Monday's
Daily.)
Stanford's traveling Tribe of 37
Indians hoard their big silver bird
at 10 a.m. today at San Francisco
International Airport bound for a
Duck-hunting trip in Eugene, Ore.,
Saturday. And they won't even
have their big gun with them.
Halfback Rick McMillen, who,
it was hoped, would be able to
whip back into shape for this
week's game, will not make the
trip north with the Cards. He
hasn't been able to snap back
from his early-season ankle in-

jury, and after running fairly
hard Tuesday and Wednesday he
came up with a swollen ankle and
leg Thursday which edged him
out of competition.
Head coach Jack Curtice hadn't
figured to have McMillen as a
starter against Len Casanova's
Webfoots. but it would have been
a relief to have the power runner
along and ready to see some ac
tion.
Jim Byrer and Skip Face will
operate in McMillen's spot. Byrer
will no doubt get the starting nod,
with Face preparerfTo split play
ing time with him.
Changes necessitated by McMil
len's absence were expected, but
Curtice was forced to come up
with another couple of changes in
preparing for the northerners.
With wingback John Bond out
of action, Curtice has been look
ing at Dick Bowers, Bill Donohue
and Fred Bernadotti in this slot.
Bowers has run the most at the
position and should be Curtice's
starter there.
The always - a - toss-up quarter
back selection for this week looks
like it's been grabbed off by jun
ior Sid Garber. He has worked
with Stanford's first unit all week
and has been consistently precise
in his passing while showing some
impressive r un n in g determina
tion.
Behind Garber are, of course,
senior Bob Nieolet and sophomore
Dick Norman. Norman has work
ed with the second unit and gets
the No. 2 nod, though particular
situations will be the main factors
in quarterback substitutions.
In the line Curtice has made
two changes. Doug Pursell will
start for Roch Conklin at center,
and Jim Ukropina will replace Irv
Nikolai at left end. Conklin has
been hampered by a neck and
shoulders muscle strain. He will
make the trip, but probably will
see only limited action.
Ukropina's promotion comes on
the strength of his fine effort
against Southern California last
week and also Curtice's desire to
play the senior more than he has.
Otherwise, Curtice will go with
the same men he started against

the Trojans last week: Troy Bar
bee and Eric Protiva at tackles,
Don Dawson and Bob Peterson at
guards, Chris Burford at right
end and Doug Dick at fullback.
Injuries weren't the whole story
in the Stanford village this week,
though; there were a few recov
eries of note. Fullback Gil Dowd
has shown he will be running
oftener at the fullback post, and
guard Larry Lacey and tackle Phil
Burkland have come along to the
point where they will lend assist
ance come Saturday.
Neither squad will go into this
week's game with a too impres
sive a season record. Oregon is
2-4, Stanford 2-5. There are other

records, though, that may tell the
game's tale, and three of these
are the Ducks' defense marks
against the opposition this year.
