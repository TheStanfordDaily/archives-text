"In Australia, we think of
America as much like an older
brother," said Lorna Bollman,
ASSU foreign scholar from Aus
tralia's University of Queensland
in Brisbane.
"America and Australia are
very close, sharing the Pacific
Ocean after being close allies dur
ing the war. What America does
vitally affects us, and we look to
the U.S. for investors to help our
economy grow," explained Lorna.
Lorna is a graduate child psy
chology student at Stanford this
year. She is a member of the
Gaieties cast.
"America is not what I thought
it would be." she said. "I thought
that it would be very different
from Australia, but it really isn't.
I think it's because students arc
the same everywhere.
"There are some differences,
though. Here there is more pres

surf? fo keep going, go out, do
things. There's something cxcit
ing about America."
At (he University of Queens
land, Miss Bollman was editor of
(he student newspaper. "Only it
was more like the Chappie than
The Daily," she said.
"In Australia last year," she
continued, "we were very puzzled
by the Little Rock incident. It
seemed so strange because Amer
ica stands for freedom and de
mocracy. We were surprised that
Americans were supporting seg
regation."
"The universities in Australia
are different from Stanford," Miss
Bollman explained. "For one
thing, 91) per cent of our students
are in the university on Common
wealth scholarships. There are
not such elaborate facilities as
here, and with the theaters and
all it is just wonderful."
