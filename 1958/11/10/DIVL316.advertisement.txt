Hi
Why settle for "part-time" performance from your
car? Why put up with lazy power on hills on get
aways? Instead, drive up to the new white pump at your
Shell Dealer's and fill up with Super Shell with TCP*.
TCP adds anti-miss to anti-knock.
Spark plug "miss" is the greatest cause of power loss to
day! It can rob you of 20 to 30 horsepower.
This "miss" is caused by harmful deposits that short
circuit the spark plugs—keep them from firing the fuel
charge. But TCP additive neutralizes these deposits, stops
misfiring and restores lost horsepower.
And don't forget that new Super Shell contains aviation
fuel ingredients that give it higher octane for anti-knock—
extra energy for better mileage. j \
So with anti-miss, anti-knock, and better mileage, too— \ \ |
doesn't it make sense to get Super Shell. \ ? jjrj
