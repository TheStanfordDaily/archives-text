# Cards' Fumbleitis Helps Ducks to 12-0 Triumph

### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
HAYWARD FIELD, Eugene,
Ore., Nov. B—Sometimes you win,
and sometimes you lose . . . and
sometimes you lose . . . and today,
again, Stanford lost. This time to
the Oregon Ducks, 12-0.
But it looked for a while like it
wasn't going to he that way at all.
It even looked like Stanford was
going to pull a minor upset and
come away with a souvenir of
their Duck-hunting trip up here
in the Northwest.
However, Stanford dropped the
ball, literally, twice today, and
that was twice too often. And
Oregon intercepted Stanford pass
es twice today, and that, too, was
twice too often.
Rut the Webfoots' 12-0 win was
not all attributable to Indian bob
bles, even though both Duck
touchdown drives started as a re
sult of Stanford miseues. Ore
gonians halfback Willie West, full
back Marian Holland and quarter
back Dave Grosz played fine
games and were key factors in the
Oregon win.
West ran 22 times to gain 81
yards. Grosz gobbled up 63 yards
on the ground and Holland raked
in 49. Any two of these combine
to top the Stanford rushing mark
of 94 total yards. And that's a
good part of the story right there.
Scoreless Half
Stanford did surprisingly well
in holding the Ducks in the score
less first half, though while smart
in diagno-sing the Oregon offense
the Stanfords were not quick
enough to nip the Ducks before
the home squad pulled in fair
yardage.
After taking the opening kick
off to their own 26, the Ducks
marched 20 yards before they
were forced to punt on a fourth
and-1 situation on their own 46.
Starting on their 13, where
Grosz's punt rolled dead, the In
dians could muster only 8 yards
in three plays and were faced
with a punting situation them
selves at fourth - and • 2 on their
own 21.
Webfeet West and Charley
Tourville shared honors in the
Ducks' next drive—nipped by the
Cards after 18 yards. Stanford,
starting on its 31, put together
three plays and 2 yards before
halfback Jim Byrer's punt, almost
blocked by Oregon end Pete
Welch, died on the Duck 34.
Slight Threat
Holding the Oregons to only 5
yards in the next down series, the
locals started a small fire as the
quarter moved down to the wire.
Starting on their 24, the Indians
called on Byrer and fullback Doug
Dick to lead them in a 37-yard
march to the Duck 39 before quar
terback Bob Nicolet's pass, the
first of the series, sailed into Ore
gon halfback Herm McKinney's
hands. Bad break No. 1.
Held to 8 yards in their next
down series, the Webfeet showed
their defensive prowess as they,
in turn, pushed the Indians back
to a—4 net in theirs.
Th en the Oregons got mad.
They put together a 34-yard air
and ground attack which found
