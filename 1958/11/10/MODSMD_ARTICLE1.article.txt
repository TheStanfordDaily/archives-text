# Cards' Fumbleitis Helps Ducks to 12-0 Triumph
## 
### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
HAYWARD FIELD, Eugene,
Ore., Nov. B—Sometimes you win,
and sometimes you lose . . . and
sometimes you lose . . . and today,
again, Stanford lost. This time to
the Oregon Ducks, 12-0.
But it looked for a while like it
wasn't going to he that way at all.
It even looked like Stanford was
going to pull a minor upset and
come away with a souvenir of
their Duck-hunting trip up here
in the Northwest.
However, Stanford dropped the
ball, literally, twice today, and
that was twice too often. And
Oregon intercepted Stanford pass
es twice today, and that, too, was
twice too often.
Rut the Webfoots' 12-0 win was
not all attributable to Indian bob
bles, even though both Duck
touchdown drives started as a re
sult of Stanford miseues. Ore
gonians halfback Willie West, full
back Marian Holland and quarter
back Dave Grosz played fine
games and were key factors in the
Oregon win.
West ran 22 times to gain 81
yards. Grosz gobbled up 63 yards
on the ground and Holland raked
in 49. Any two of these combine
to top the Stanford rushing mark
of 94 total yards. And that's a
good part of the story right there.
Scoreless Half
Stanford did surprisingly well
in holding the Ducks in the score
less first half, though while smart
in diagno-sing the Oregon offense
the Stanfords were not quick
enough to nip the Ducks before
the home squad pulled in fair
yardage.
After taking the opening kick
off to their own 26, the Ducks
marched 20 yards before they
were forced to punt on a fourth
and-1 situation on their own 46.
Starting on their 13, where
Grosz's punt rolled dead, the In
dians could muster only 8 yards
in three plays and were faced
with a punting situation them
selves at fourth - and • 2 on their
own 21.
Webfeet West and Charley
Tourville shared honors in the
Ducks' next drive—nipped by the
Cards after 18 yards. Stanford,
starting on its 31, put together
three plays and 2 yards before
halfback Jim Byrer's punt, almost
blocked by Oregon end Pete
Welch, died on the Duck 34.
Slight Threat
Holding the Oregons to only 5
yards in the next down series, the
locals started a small fire as the
quarter moved down to the wire.
Starting on their 24, the Indians
called on Byrer and fullback Doug
Dick to lead them in a 37-yard
march to the Duck 39 before quar
terback Bob Nicolet's pass, the
first of the series, sailed into Ore
gon halfback Herm McKinney's
hands. Bad break No. 1.
Held to 8 yards in their next
down series, the Webfeet showed
their defensive prowess as they,
in turn, pushed the Indians back
to a—4 net in theirs.
Th en the Oregons got mad.
They put together a 34-yard air
and ground attack which found

Tuesday's father (William Jr., 8 lbs. 6 oz.) —Saturday's' gainer
them threatening on the Stanford
26 when a Grosz pass, intended
more for Card halfback Dick Bow
ers than Oregon end Alden Kim
brough, went where it seemed to
be intended into Bowers' hands.
Not to be outdone, the Indians
drove 28 yards to the midfield
line, where Nicolet, rushed in a
pass attempt, threw in despera
tion to end Chris Burford. An in
eligible receiver penalty, Stan
ford's first penalty in the game,
pushed the Cards back to a third
and-20 situation on their own 36.

Byrcr quick-kicked out to the Ore
gon 2G.
Stanford dug in and held the
Ducks to 5 yards in the ensuing
down series; then, starting from
the Stanford 29, quarterback Dick
Norman completed three beat-the
clock passes to leave the Indians
on the Oregon 3G with a scant
few seconds to go in the half.
In went the kicking tee with
Stanford's kicking halfback Skip
Face. His field goal try. from the
Oregon 41, had no legs at all and
the clock was out.
In the second half, after taking
the opening kick-off to their 41,
the Cards advanced 16 yards, with
Nicolet picking up great protec
tion and completing two passes to
end Chris Burford. Then, after
taking a pitch-out, Face bobbled
the oval, Duck halfback Len Read
recovering. Bad break No. 2; dis
astrous break No. 1.
The Ducks were off to pay dirt,
with Grosz engineering a fine
drive, 64 yards in 14 plays, before
capping it by going over from
the 1. John Clarke's kick was
wide to the left, and the Ducks
were out in front, 6-0.
Too Bad —Illegal
Byrer retur ned the Oregon kick
off 32 yards to the Stanford 44.
Nicolet passed complete to Irv
Nikolai as the first part of a well
planned play which ended up in
a lateral to Dick, but the lateral
was too much in front, and the
Cards were penalized.
Nicolet completed four more
passes, though, one of them this
same play — only this time run
right and pushing the Indians to
the Oregon 10, where the Ducks
took over after a fourth-and-5
pass fell incomplete.
When Bob Peterson recovered
West's fumble on the Oregon 33,
the Cards looked like they might
be off and running to a tie. On
the pass and lateral play from the
Oregon 13, Nikolai failed to get
Ihe pitch-out in the right direction
and fumbled. Duck tackle Jim

Linden recovering.
This was bad break No. 3; dis
astrous break No. 2.
It took the Webfeet lf> plays to
gather in 84 yards and a touch
down, but they went right to work
on it and let Holland gather in the
final 2 yards, with 4:15 left in the
game.
No Kicking Luck
Clarke's second conversion try
was blocked by Stanford guard
Don Dawson to give the Ducks a
12-0 lead. At this point, a com
fortable margin.
Stanford's last drive was little
more than a desperation attempt
to register something on the Hay
ward Field scoreboard, but even
that try went afoul. In a first
and-10 setup on the Oregon 43, a
Garber aerial was picked off by
Duck center Dave Fish, and Stan
ford had its hands full trying to
keep the Ducks out of the end
zone as the gun went off with Ore
gon on the Stanford 7-yard line.
Statistically the Ducks were def
initely the better team; they out
ran the Cards, 238 to 94; ran 76
plays to Stanofrd's 50; outgained
them in total offense, 313 to 201;
and out-firstdowned them, 21-11.
Passing Edge
Only in passing did the Injuns
come up with an edge. Stanford
made good on 13 out of 20 tries
for 107 yards; Oregon was 6 for
10 and 75 yards. Nicolet hit 10 for
13, Norman 3 for 4, and Garber
went 0 for 3. Both Duck passers
were 3 or 5.
Byrer and Dick were the top
ground gainers for Stanford, at 37
and 28 yards respectively. Bur
ford, playing another fine, almost
full game at end, grabbed four
tosses, Nikolai three. Bowers and
Face each two, and Dick and By
rer singles.
In the line, tackles Chris Plain
and Troy Barbee played stand-out
games for the Cards, as did go
get-'em center Doug Pursell.
