# Lyon Student Notes Academic Freedom
## 
### 
"There is a greater degree of
academic freedom here than at
Lyon University, and I am im
pressed by the excellent faculty
student relations that exist at
Stanford," said Helene La Roche,

current Cap and Gown foreign
scholar.
Miss La Roche was the secre
tary of the Franco-American Club
in Lyon before she came to Stan
ford this year. Lyon University
is in the city of Lyon, France. She
is a graduate student in history,
living in Lagunita Hall.
Her interests include swim
ming and ballet dancing, and she
has given several talks around
the campus on France, illustrated
by color slides. She has danced
with professional ballet troupes,
and will be dancing in the "Gaie
ties of lOoS."
She finds the social life here
"very hectic" compared to Lyon,
where there are few student so
cial activities. She emphasized
that "all French girls are not like
Brigittc Bardot" and continued
to say that in Lyon it is rare for a
girl to go out more than two eve
nings a month.
Miss La .Roche plans to return
to France next year, to work in
the United Nations organization,
or to teach.
