# Candide-A Success
## 
### A Review By Bob Christiansen 
This year's Concert Series be
gan successfully Sunday after
noon with a concert performance
of Leonard Bernstein's entertain
ing musical, "Candide," based
more or less, on Voltaire's satire
of the same name.
This success lay mostly with
the cast in general and with Mar
tyn Green and lrra Petina in par
ticular. The music is at times
cute, at times clever and at times
bland, always inferior to that of
other Bernstein musicals.
Martyn Green fulfilled three
roles, those of the narrator, Dr.
Pangloss and Martin, to perfec
tion. His opening patter song,

"The Best of All Possible
Worlds," was a model of diction
and precision.
lira Petina as the Old Lady
was perpetually effervescent and
always charming. Robert Rounse
ville and Mary Costa, as Candide
and Cunegonde respectively, were
very adequate and at times as
inspired as Green and Petina. Cu
negonde's coloratura aria, "Glit
ter and Be Gay," was especially
well sung by Mary Costa.
George Blackwell, as Cune
gonde's brother Maximilian, and
Lee Bergere, as the Governor of
Buenos Aires, were outstanding
in supporting roles.
All in all "Candide" may be re.
garded as a success entertain
ment-wise, if not artistically.
