# 'Make Your Boss Work; He Will Quit'—Parkinson
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
"If you want to get the boss to
retire in a hurry, get him started
filling in forms and traveling by
air. Endless answering of ques
tions and a continuous stream of
conferences in different climates
al lover the world make him feel
his age and greatly facilitate one's
advancement."
This and other hot tips on how
to succeed in business were given
to a full house of Stanford's as
piring young executives and am
bitious wives-to-be (as well as a
few well-tested Administration
executives Friday evening in Din
kelspiel Auditorium by Professor
C. Northcote Parkinson, author
of the best-selling "Parkinson's
Law" and an old hand at the ins
and outs of capitalist manage
ment.
He made note of this and two
other "laws":
• The more people there are in
a management operation the
more work they make for one
another.
• Committees: The time spent
on any item on the agenda is in
inverse proportion to the amount
of money involved.
• Cocktail parties: The impor
tant people at a reception always
meet in a particular part of the
room 90 minutes after the party
begins and if one wants to rise in
the business world he must know
where to find them.
The basic idea of Parkinson's
Law is that in modern manage
ment when a man becomes over
worked he does not hire another
man on an equal level and give
him half the work. This would

create a rival in his crusade for
advancement.
Instead he hires assistants (two
to inspire rivalry among his
subordinates). Now there are
three men doing one man's job.
When one of these assistants in
turn becomes "overworked" he
too is given two assistants. The
other of the original assistants
(without his asking for them) is
also given two helpers, because it
would be favoritism to do other
wise.
Now there are seven doing one
man's job.
