# Evaluation

### 
The failure of the recent Homecoming week end to satisfy all
expectations of the students has had a constructive result. All
groups directlf concerned, as well as individual students, are paus
ing to re-evaluate their ideas and goals in regard to the "Stan
ford spirit."
This Homecoming was the result of long hours oi planning.
The plans were formulated after consideration of previous ex
perience and the complaints of students. Attempts in recent years
to build enthusiasm and school loyalty have often proved un
fruitful; hence the desire to try "something new.'
It was the feeling of Rally Com and the. yell leaders
that students did not want to yell at rallies or at games.
They were led to believe that the students wanted to he
entertained. It was these students, who claimed to be
"sophisticateswho made their voices heard to those
responsible for the plans.
Our own feeling at the Friday night Homecoming rally was
that the 2500 persons congregated there were present to begin a
cheering movement which would carry through the next day's
game.
This would indicate a change in feeling from previous years
to the present —a change which was not communicated l<» the
student leaders.
Saturday morning's program on The Row had technical diffi
culties which hindered its effectiveness; these included a mis
understanding on timing of some parts of the show. Ihe emphasis
was chiefly on the alumni, and, although a comparatively small
number attended the program, an estimated 15,000 alumni at
tended the game who would not have attended had it not been
for the advance publicity on Homecoming . I For comments from
some of these, see Letters to the Editor.)
Saturday morning s program was also an attempt to
enlarge the scope of Homecoming—to make it more than
house decorations, rally and game; to make "Home
coming" mean what its name indicates to alumni and
friends of the I niversity.
Whether the planners could have increased the effectiveness
of the Homecoming week end becomes a moot point, because the
basic cause in the lack of enthusiasm of Homecoming week end
lies not so much in Rally Com, Cardinals or the yell leaders, or
in the specific events, as in the general attitude of the student
body as manifested in tbe mass exodus in the third and fourth
quarters of the ball game.
It is rough to sit and watch a team going down to defeat and
listen to the jeers of the opposing rooting section. But we would
find it rougher to have left before the final gun and then to have
had to face a friend from USC.
Still more difficult at the moment would be to face
Prince. Light foot, who has devoted himself to the pro
motion of Stanford spirit for a longer period than any
of us in the student body. (For Prince Light foot's re
actions to Saturday's student exhibition, see Letters.)
The question in many people's minds now, including "horri
fied" alumni, is: why didn't the students stay to cheer for their
team, regardless of the score?
For one of the answers to this question, see Wednesday's edi
torial, "PRIVILEGE."

The failure of the recent Homecoming week end to satisfy all
expectations of the students has had a constructive result. All
groups directlf concerned, as well as individual students, are paus
ing to re-evaluate their ideas and goals in regard to the "Stan
ford spirit."
This Homecoming was the result of long hours oi planning.
The plans were formulated after consideration of previous ex
perience and the complaints of students. Attempts in recent years
to build enthusiasm and school loyalty have often proved un
fruitful; hence the desire to try "something new.'
It was the feeling of Rally Com and the. yell leaders
that students did not want to yell at rallies or at games.
They were led to believe that the students wanted to he
entertained. It was these students, who claimed to be
"sophisticateswho made their voices heard to those
responsible for the plans.
Our own feeling at the Friday night Homecoming rally was
that the 2500 persons congregated there were present to begin a
cheering movement which would carry through the next day's
game.
This would indicate a change in feeling from previous years
to the present —a change which was not communicated l<» the
student leaders.
Saturday morning's program on The Row had technical diffi
culties which hindered its effectiveness; these included a mis
understanding on timing of some parts of the show. Ihe emphasis
was chiefly on the alumni, and, although a comparatively small
number attended the program, an estimated 15,000 alumni at
tended the game who would not have attended had it not been
for the advance publicity on Homecoming . I For comments from
some of these, see Letters to the Editor.)
Saturday morning s program was also an attempt to
enlarge the scope of Homecoming—to make it more than
house decorations, rally and game; to make "Home
coming" mean what its name indicates to alumni and
friends of the I niversity.
Whether the planners could have increased the effectiveness
of the Homecoming week end becomes a moot point, because the
basic cause in the lack of enthusiasm of Homecoming week end
lies not so much in Rally Com, Cardinals or the yell leaders, or
in the specific events, as in the general attitude of the student
body as manifested in tbe mass exodus in the third and fourth
quarters of the ball game.
It is rough to sit and watch a team going down to defeat and
listen to the jeers of the opposing rooting section. But we would
find it rougher to have left before the final gun and then to have
had to face a friend from USC.
Still more difficult at the moment would be to face
Prince. Light foot, who has devoted himself to the pro
motion of Stanford spirit for a longer period than any
of us in the student body. (For Prince Light foot's re
actions to Saturday's student exhibition, see Letters.)
The question in many people's minds now, including "horri
fied" alumni, is: why didn't the students stay to cheer for their
team, regardless of the score?
For one of the answers to this question, see Wednesday's edi
torial, "PRIVILEGE."
