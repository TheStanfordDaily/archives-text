A recent article in N'ewsweek
magazine describes a new push
for better grades by fraternities.
Fraternities themselves are now
offering scholarships.
According to Newsweek,
some fraternities have waited
until forced into action by their
nationals. But a sample of the
drive for better scholarship in
the individual chapters is the
Drake chapter of I'lii Gamma
Delta which has established an
annual "steak and pea" scholar
ship dinner. High- scoring
brothers get steak. The man
with the lowest marks gets just
one pea.
There are "Too Many Sex
Laws," says Karl M. Bowman,
M.D., professor of psychiatry
emeritus at the University of Cal
ifornia School of Medicine, in the
Oct. 25 issue of The Nation. Dr.
Bowman points out that attitudes
toward sex vary from those who
would see greater leniency in re
gard to legislation on sexual be
havior, while others would re
strict it even more.
Says Dr. Bowman: "Where we
have honest differences of opin
ion about the propriety of certain

types of sexual behavior, it would
seem that we ought to rely on
education, family training and
the influence of society generally
(including religious organiza
tions), as a means of dealing with
the problem, rather than passage
of new laws.
Dr. Bowman notes that Judge
Learned Hand has stated that a
criminal law which is unen
forced is worse than no law at
all and much sexual behavior
is "a matter very largely of
taste," and not something for
which people should be put in
prison.
The November Harper's carries
its second in a series of three ar
ticles on different types of Ameri
can colleges. Last month author
David Boroff discussed Harvard;
this month it is Sarah Lawrence
and in December he will review
Brooklyn College.
According to Boroff, "The in
dividual and her interests are the
center of the educational proc
ess." (In traditional colleges, the
curriculum is unshakably central,
and the assumption is that the
student and the courses will
somehow connect. One way, hard
ly the best, of making them con
nect is to require a passing
grade.)
Among the many aspects of Sa
rah Lawrence which Boroff cov
ers is the idea that learning is the
active use of knowledge. A good
article with which to compare
some of one's own ideas about
college education.

There are "Too Many Sex
Laws," says Karl M. Bowman,
M.D., professor of psychiatry
emeritus at the University of Cal
ifornia School of Medicine, in the
Oct. 25 issue of The Nation. Dr.
Bowman points out that attitudes
toward sex vary from those who
would see greater leniency in re
gard to legislation on sexual be
havior, while others would re
strict it even more.
Says Dr. Bowman: "Where we
have honest differences of opin
ion about the propriety of certain

types of sexual behavior, it would
seem that we ought to rely on
education, family training and
the influence of society generally
(including religious organiza
tions), as a means of dealing with
the problem, rather than passage
of new laws.
Dr. Bowman notes that Judge
Learned Hand has stated that a
criminal law which is unen
forced is worse than no law at
all and much sexual behavior
is "a matter very largely of
taste," and not something for
which people should be put in
prison.
The November Harper's carries
its second in a series of three ar
ticles on different types of Ameri
can colleges. Last month author
David Boroff discussed Harvard;
this month it is Sarah Lawrence
and in December he will review
Brooklyn College.
According to Boroff, "The in
dividual and her interests are the
center of the educational proc
ess." (In traditional colleges, the
curriculum is unshakably central,
and the assumption is that the
student and the courses will
somehow connect. One way, hard
ly the best, of making them con
nect is to require a passing
grade.)
Among the many aspects of Sa
rah Lawrence which Boroff cov
ers is the idea that learning is the
active use of knowledge. A good
article with which to compare
some of one's own ideas about
college education.

A recent article in N'ewsweek
magazine describes a new push
for better grades by fraternities.
Fraternities themselves are now
offering scholarships.
According to Newsweek,
some fraternities have waited
until forced into action by their
nationals. But a sample of the
drive for better scholarship in
the individual chapters is the
Drake chapter of I'lii Gamma
Delta which has established an
annual "steak and pea" scholar
ship dinner. High- scoring
brothers get steak. The man
with the lowest marks gets just
one pea.
