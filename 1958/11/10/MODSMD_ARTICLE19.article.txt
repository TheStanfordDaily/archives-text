# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Students Lose Dignity 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In this letter I would like to
refer to last weekend [Nov. 1]
when we were engaged in a
football game with our arch
rival, USC. We lost as we all
know, but it seems to me that
we lost more than just a foot
ball game. It looks to me, and
from comments made, that our
student body lost their dignity,
sportsmanship, quality, man
ners, etc., and became a revolt
ing spectacle, unbelievable at
times in their conduct.
It was sad of course to see
our team lose a Homecoming
game, but it was more humiliat
ing to look to the rooting sec
tion and see them leaving in
droves, to sit and watch them
throwing articles that are used
only for sanitary reasons. I
looked and saw in disbelief, and
I said to myself, "SO THIS IS
STANFORD, THE SCHOOL
TO WHICH I'VE DEDICATED
MYSELF TO REPRESENT
FOR THEI R SPORTSMAN
SHIP AND HONOR, THEIR
DIGNITY AND QUALITY,"
and you don't know how sick I
felt inside. It turned my stom
ach when I remembered how I
stood and argued with students
and members from other insti
tutions that this sort of thing
never happened at Stanford.
My mother traveled 350 miles
to the game and she told me
that, and I quote, "Indians are
supposed to be an ignorant race
due to the fact that they never
had schools to become educated
in, but if this is a display of
education and civilization, then

my parents must have learned
honor and dignity from some
other sources than books, be
cause they honored fair compe
tition and respected dignity and
quality."
This of course is not the first
time this has happened this sea
son, as for the first two times
I saw this happening, I said to
myself, that this won't happen
again. But instead of getting
better it has gotten worse. Per
haps none of you have met the
football team. If you haven't
then 1 feel sorry for you be
cause they are a swell group of
guys. Every week they are out
there on the field trying their
best to win. Perhaps their best
isn't good enough for you, well,
it is for me. They have lost, as
I said before, but they have also
won as they have proven and
I've always felt that they could
have won this year from every
body that they had met. I also
feel that they have a good
chance of winning all the rest
of their games.
Our coach Mr. Curtice is also
a fine person and it is a shame
if you haven't had the chance
to make his acquaintance. It
could be thai the Rally Com
should make an attempt in this
department to give you liiat
chance. Why not wake up before
it is too late. However, win or
lose, there has been no excuse
for the display that our rooting
section has been putting on.
If a contest was in the run
ning for a name for our root
ing section, I'm sure that
"FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS"
would win hands down. It is

riot my intention however to di
rect this at the loyal Stanford
rooters who stood in the stands
to the bitter end but to only the
guilty ones who won the honor
of the above title, and I'm suxe
they know who they are. This
display is what I would call hy
pocrisy in its highest form.
It may be that I'm sticking
my neck out in the wrong direc
tion when I make comment on
this situation, and perhaps I
have no just reason for saying
what I've said, for after all, I
am not a student at Stanford.
In the student body, I have no
right to vote, comment, or any
thing else, but after that dis
play last weekend I think it is
about time somebody said some
thing, Rally Com, yell leader or
whoever it might take to shape
this rooting section back into
something that can be respect
ed again.
Perhaps it would do some of
these rooters some good to take
a few lessons from their own
bandâ€”a band which has proven
its loyalty beyond a doubt; a
band which has given up its
free time to participate and to
represent what (the members)
believe to be an honorable stu
dent J)ody and football team or
any other team representing
Stanford.
The facts are, that the actions
of the rooting section last Sat
urday were humiliating, morti
fying, and a DISGRACE, and I
hope and pray that this doesn't
happen again or that when it
does I'm not present to witness
same.
