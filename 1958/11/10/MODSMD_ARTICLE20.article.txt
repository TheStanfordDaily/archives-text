# Essential Part

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to add my opinion
of last Saturday's |Nov. 1| root
ing section fiasco to the com
ments already printed in The
Daily.
I graduated from Stanford in
August of 1958 and I have
watched this sad decline in stu
dent spirit develop for the last
three or four years. The actions
of the rooters at Saturday's game
were only one manifestation of a
campus-wide condition which is
worse than the much-complained
of apathy. Stanford appears to

have become merely a gathering
place of individuals over the age
of 17 who are seeking goals
which range from marriage and
parties to knowledge on the aca
demic level.
These people live on the cam
pus, or attPnd classes there, but
they do not belong to the Univer
sity. They will not belong to the
school until they feel that they
are a part, and an essential part,
of the school. They will not feel
that they are a part of the school
until the ASSU officers and other
student leaders convince them
that they are vitally necessary to
any and all activities.
When the cheer leaders at the

football games convince the stu
dents and other fans that the
team simply cannot win unless it
is supported by the stands, then
the students may stay to the end
of even a 72-0 losing contest.
When each rooter is convinced
that his voice adds immeasurably
to the effect of the rooting sec
tion, then the students will stay
to the end of any contest.
