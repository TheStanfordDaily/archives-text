Explanation Due
Editor, The Daily:
My wife and I, both alums,
made our annual trek to the cam
pus Saturday [Nov. 1] for Home
coming and what a shock we re
ceived! No, I'm not talking about
the players or the game, I'm talk
ing about the student body.
I don't want to sound stuffy,
just shocked, and I believe I can
say hurt, to see such a large per
centage of the student body begin
to walk out on the team. I can't
remember when I've ever seen a
student body walk out on a team
before the Hymn, but to see them
begin to trek out in mass num
bers in the middle of the third
quarter was indeed horrifying.
Many of the alumni around me
were much more upset over this
than over any of the action on the
field. How on earth do they ex
pect a team or a new coach to per
form when the student body
walks out on them. Is there any
logical explanation for this beha
vior? Has the school spirit degen
erated to this extent? Those of
us who are still loyal Stanfordites
and always hope to be, support
ing this school in any way pos
sible, I think deserve an explana
tion for such behavior.
I'd like to add that a large per
centage of the alums in our sec
tion moved over to join the piti
fully small rooting section in the
singing of the Hymn. This was
indeed a shocking day in Stan
ford history.

Editor, The Daily:
Stanford students from the
rooting section filing out of Sat
urday's game was a disgusting
thing for the Old Grads to wit
ness. How can we expect to have
a winning team with such a lack
of spirit?
By contrast with the USC root
ing section, the Stanford side of
the field was strangely lacking in
vigor. The USC cheer leader out
did himself to entertain us on his
side of the field.

Far worse than the loss of
the game was the dispirited,
discourteous exhibition of the
Stanford students.

How about moving the rooting
section into the end zone and sav
ing the choicer seats for the
alums who are willing to drive
miles to see a game—and willing
also to remain in the stadium .just
as long as there is a team on the
field and a band to play the
Hymn?

field. How on earth do they ex
pect a team or a new coach to per
form when the student body
walks out on them. Is there any
logical explanation for this beha
vior? Has the school spirit degen
erated to this extent? Those of
us who are still loyal Stanfordites
and always hope to be, support
ing this school in any way pos
sible, I think deserve an explana
tion for such behavior.
I'd like to add that a large per
centage of the alums in our sec
tion moved over to join the piti
fully small rooting section in the
singing of the Hymn. This was
indeed a shocking day in Stan
ford history.

Stanford students from the
rooting section filing out of Sat
urday's game was a disgusting
thing for the Old Grads to wit
ness. How can we expect to have
a winning team with such a lack
of spirit?
By contrast with the USC root
ing section, the Stanford side of
the field was strangely lacking in
vigor. The USC cheer leader out
did himself to entertain us on his
side of the field.

Far worse than the loss of
the game was the dispirited,
discourteous exhibition of the
Stanford students.

How about moving the rooting
section into the end zone and sav
ing the choicer seats for the
alums who are willing to drive
miles to see a game—and willing
also to remain in the stadium .just
as long as there is a team on the
field and a band to play the
Hymn?

My wife and I, both alums,
made our annual trek to the cam
pus Saturday [Nov. 1] for Home
coming and what a shock we re
ceived! No, I'm not talking about
the players or the game, I'm talk
ing about the student body.
I don't want to sound stuffy,
just shocked, and I believe I can
say hurt, to see such a large per
centage of the student body begin
to walk out on the team. I can't
remember when I've ever seen a
student body walk out on a team
before the Hymn, but to see them
begin to trek out in mass num
bers in the middle of the third
quarter was indeed horrifying.
Many of the alumni around me
were much more upset over this
than over any of the action on the
field. How on earth do they ex
pect a team or a new coach to per
form when the student body
walks out on them. Is there any
logical explanation for this beha
vior? Has the school spirit degen
