# The
						Stanford Daily SPORT SCENE
## Frosh Top Brubabes 
### 
It was a mighty happy week
end for at least one section of the
SU football scene as ihe Stanford
freshmen, after a disappointing
opening last weekend, began liv
ing up to their potential as they
hammered out a 19 to 0 decision
over the hapless UCLA frosh.
The Papooses dominated the
game both on the field and in the
statistics. The first score came in
the second period when quarter
back Bob Price tossed a 26-yard
touchdown pass to John Schoet
tler. Again in the second quarter
the Card freshmen scored on a
65-yard punt return by Gary
Craig. The conversions on both
of these scores were missed, by
a fumble and an incomplete pass

respectively.
The final tally was in Ihe last
period with tackle Jim Moe grab
bing another Bob Price pass on
the tackle-eligible play for five
yards. The point after was good
as Bill Kuhn made his kick.
Stanford gained 149 yards pass
ing and 197 on the ground for a
total of 345. This gave them a de
cisive edge over the Brubabe.s
who could only muster a total of
12G yards.
Price completed 12 of 15 passes
and Jim Smith had a 6 for 9 com
pletion mark.
Stan Lindskog was the top run
ner of the afternoon, carrying the
ball 17 times for 92 yards and a
5.4 average.
