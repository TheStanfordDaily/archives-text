# PCC ROUNDUP
## Cal Climbs Back To Driver's Seat 
### 
The Oregon State Washington State football game Saturday that
was tabbed as a real conference "crucial" was played just like that
. . . with the results much to the delight of the California Bears, who
suddenly find themselves back in the driver's seat for the Race to
the Rose Bowl with only two games left.

WSC struck in the final throe
minutes of play to knock OSC out
of first place with a 7-0 victory,
while Cal was holding off an in
spired challenge by UCLA for a
20-17 triumph in Berkeley.
Southern California, like WSC,
kept its hopes alive with a 21-6
win over Washington.
California had a most hectic
time disposing of the determined
Bruins, but their old reliable stars
Joe Kapp and Jack Hart, plus
newcomers G r o v e r Garvin and
Walt Arnold, were equal to the
t ask.
A 78-yard Kapp-directed drive
in the final quarter put across the
clincher for the Bears after they
had stopped a dangerous UCLA
drive deep in their own territory.
In a brilliant defensive battle
in Ihe rain at Pullman, the Cou
gars' Ted Cano dove lor a 1-yard
touchdown to climax a 43-yard
drive in the waning minutes of
the final period.
WSC dominated the game most
of the way, but had two potential
scoring drives choked off by in
terceptions. The Beavers could
muster only one serious drive,
and that one was choked off 29
yards away by a Cougar intercep
tion.
At Los Angeles, USC used its
two so-called reserves, Tom Maud
lin and Don Buford, to gain vic
tory for the second straight week.
Buford and Maudlin sparked two
first-half scoring drives that were
all the Trojans needed.
SC pushed across another score
early in the second half after re
covering a Husky fumble on the
7-yard line, and the Trojan de
fense ably held Luther Carr and
his mates in check all afternoon.
