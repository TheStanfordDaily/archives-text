Stanford did it again in cross
country, this time upsetting UC
LA and California in dual meets
Saturday in Berkeley. Coupled
with last week's surpi'.se over
USC, the victory thrust the In
dian's into the favorite's role for
the Nov. 29 PCC Championship
meet at Stanford.
Scores of the duals were Stan
ford 28, UCLA 29; and Stanford
2.1, California 31. Because of the
odd bunching of runners, UCLA
came out on top in triangular
scoring with 34 points to 37 for
Stanford and 54 for the Bears.
Keith Wallace pulled out to a
50-yard lead at the mile point of
the four-mile run, and went on
to win by 100 yards in 19:53.
But the big surprise for Payton
Jordan's Cards was the brilliant
showing of Doug Martin.
He outsprinted Cal's Bob Gay
lord and UCLA's Ken Riding over
the final half-mile to take second
in 20:15—by far the best race of
his career.
Bob Monzingo also finished
strong to grab fifth behind Gay
lord and Riding. He was clocked
in 20:30. John Northway in 12th
and A 1 Ahumada in 18th were the
remaining Stanford scorers, and
20th-place Kim Maxwell was the
other Card finisher.
