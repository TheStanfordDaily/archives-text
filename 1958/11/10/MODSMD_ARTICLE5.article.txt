# DINNER HOUR CHANCED
## Cardinals Move Bonfire To 6:30 Big Game Eve 
### 
Time for the Big Game Bonfire has been set at 6:30 p.m. on Big
Game Eve, Nov. 21, Cardinals co-chairmen Margo Armbruster and
Ron Marti no announced Sunday night.
Plans are being completed to move the dinner hour up to 5:30 p.m.
in campus dining halls and the bonfire rally will begin at 6:30.

The co-chairmen explained that
the band, pompon girls and yell
leaders have commitments at the
alumni reunions in San Francisco
that night and the earlier Bonfire
will enable them to attend. Others
having plans in San Francisco on
Big Game Eve will be able to at
tend the Bonfire and other func
tions as well.
Student leaders met Friday and
again Sunday night to discuss the
break with tradition. Representa
tives of Cardinals, Rally Com. the
band, pompon girls, the ASSU ad
ministration and the Alumni As
sociation stressed the desirability
of having an on-campus rally on
Big Game Eve.
They pointed out that the San
Francisco rally on Friday night
has been poorly attended in the
past few years. Transportation
difficulties to the city for many
students emphasize the desirabil
ity of having the main rally, just
prior to the Big Game, on cam
pus, where all students who wish
to attend may do so with ease.
In the past many participants
in the San Francisco rally have
been neither Stanford nor Cal
students, and the recent rallies
have not been truly representa
tive of the Stanford tradition.
Substantial damage to property
has occurred on occasion. In 1957
more than $150 damage resulted
when windows of buses wore bro
ken and a truck was damaged.
Another year a band member had
two teeth knocked out and instru
ment damage totaled $200.
The planners noted that a
Thursday night rally with noth
ing happening on Friday, the
time when the build-up of spirit
should be greatest, would be a
let-down, whereas an on-campus
rally on Friday would be a unify
ing influence.

difficulties to the city for many
students emphasize the desirabil
ity of having the main rally, just
prior to the Big Game, on cam
pus, where all students who wish
to attend may do so with ease.
In the past many participants
in the San Francisco rally have
been neither Stanford nor Cal
students, and the recent rallies
have not been truly representa
tive of the Stanford tradition.
Substantial damage to property
has occurred on occasion. In 1957
more than $150 damage resulted
when windows of buses wore bro
ken and a truck was damaged.
Another year a band member had
two teeth knocked out and instru
ment damage totaled $200.
The planners noted that a
Thursday night rally with noth
ing happening on Friday, the
time when the build-up of spirit
should be greatest, would be a
let-down, whereas an on-campus
rally on Friday would be a unify
ing influence.
Time for the Big Game Bonfire has been set at 6:30 p.m. on Big
Game Eve, Nov. 21, Cardinals co-chairmen Margo Armbruster and
Ron Marti no announced Sunday night.
Plans are being completed to move the dinner hour up to 5:30 p.m.
in campus dining halls and the bonfire rally will begin at 6:30.

The co-chairmen explained that
the band, pompon girls and yell
leaders have commitments at the
alumni reunions in San Francisco
that night and the earlier Bonfire
will enable them to attend. Others
having plans in San Francisco on
Big Game Eve will be able to at
tend the Bonfire and other func
tions as well.
Student leaders met Friday and
again Sunday night to discuss the
break with tradition. Representa
tives of Cardinals, Rally Com. the
band, pompon girls, the ASSU ad
ministration and the Alumni As
sociation stressed the desirability
of having an on-campus rally on
Big Game Eve.
They pointed out that the San
Francisco rally on Friday night
has been poorly attended in the
past few years. Transportation
