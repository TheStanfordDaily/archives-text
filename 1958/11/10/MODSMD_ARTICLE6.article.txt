# Jordan-UAR Deal Rumored
## 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan (/I 1 ) â€” Signs
! pointed Sunday to a backstage
deal for closer co-operation be
tween King Hussein's regime and
President Nasser's United Arab
Republic. It might bring an era
of tranquility to Jordan.
In any case Nasser's appeal in
the Middle East as a symbol of
Arab unity appears such that
Hussein could not afford to op
pose him indefinitely.
Diplomatic relations between
Cairo and Amman were broken
off when Nasser recognized the
Iraqi Republic in July when
American and British troops
landed in Lebanon and Jordan.
Lebanon also will resume nor
mal diplomatic relations with the
United Arab Republic this week.
