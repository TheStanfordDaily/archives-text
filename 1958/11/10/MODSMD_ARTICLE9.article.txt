# Army's Satellite Next As AF Fails 3rd Time
## 
### 
Now that the Air Force has failed on its third attempt to circle the moon with a satellite, the Army
will get two cracks at the problem with the first shot probably coming on or about Dec. 5.
The Air Force was assigned three lunar probes and the Army two. When the third Pioneer rocket
came blazing back into the earth's atmosphere less than 45 minutes after launching Saturday morn
ing, the responsibility for a moon satellite shifted to the Army.
The third stage of the 88-foot Pioneer failed to ignite, causing the 52-ton rocket to sputter at an alti*

titde of 1000 miles — a far cry
from the moon, 220,000 miles
away.
The Army's present position is
similar to the one it was in last
Jan. 31 after the Navy had failed
in numerous attempts to launch
its Vanguard satellite. That was
the date the Army sent Explorer
I, America's first successful rock
et, into orbit.

Since then, the Army missile
program under Maj. Gen. John B.
Medaris has put two more Ex
plorers circling the globe. The
new moon try will use the highly
successful 1500-mile Jupiter bal
listic missile as the main booster
with Jupiter-C rockets forming
the rest of the vehicle.
The next time the planes of the
earth and moon come into favor
able position for launching is on
Dec. 5, so that is the most likely
date for the Army's premiere at
tempt.
The first Air Force Pioneer
blew up 77 seconds after launch
ing on Aug. 17. The second shot
on Oct. 11 set an altitude record
of 79,000 miles before falling back
to earth.
