# MIG's Menace King Hussein

### 
AMMAN', Jordan (/P) —Young King Hussein charged Monday two
MIG jet fighters attempted to force down his unarmed royal plane
in a flight over Syria and then chased him back over the Jordan
border. He made no mention of any shots being fired.
Hussein, in a dramatic broadcast to the nation, explained his unox-

pected return home less than two
hours after taking off amid
cheers to celebrate his 24th birth
day Nov. 24 with members of his
family in Switzerland. He de
clared this trip has now been can
celed.
Hussein spoke in solemn but
firm tones that gave no indication
he had been unnerved. He was
unharmed, Ihe royal plane un
damaged. The King was riding as
copilot.
LI.A.It. Charges
A spokesman for the United
Arab Republic's First Army in
Syria without mentioning Hus
sein—charged a Jordanian "mili
tary plane" was caught trying to
fly over the country without get
ting official clearance. The U.A.R.
army statement broadcast by
Cairo radio said the pilot refused
an order to land and was escorted
to the border after saying he was
returning to Jordan.
"Our planes could have forced
it to land in Damascus airport or
shot it down in case it refused to
land," the U.A.R. spokesman said.
"But the truth is our planes es
corted it without interference un
til it left Syrian air space.
Known in Advance
The King's flight over Syria—
whether permission had been got
ten or not—was well known in
advance. The only other air route
out of Jordan would have been
over Israel and it would be un
thinkable for Hussein to fly over
territory the Arabs generally re
gard as "enemy."
The incident dealt a serious
blow to efforts to promote better
relations between Jordan and
President Nasser's U.A.R. — of
which Syria is a part.
Violated Law
Hussein accused the MlG's of
violating international law by
following him back into Jordan
ian airspace.
The pro-Western King, who has
previously defied the U.A.R.
against seemingly heavy odds, de
clared his government was taking
the "necessary steps" to maintain
the nation's prestige and dignity
in the face of Monday's incident.
He did not elaborate.
