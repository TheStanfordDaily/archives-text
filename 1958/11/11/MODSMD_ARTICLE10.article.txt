# Axe in Cellar Maybe Today
## 
### 
It looks as though the Axe is
finally going to be installed in the
Cellar today.
The alarm is in the case; only
the Axe is needed. That will he
installed, according to ASSU Busi
ness Manager Larry Kelley, as
soon as the Corp Yard has time to
rush over and do the job.
The Palo Alto police have been
informed of the occasion so that
when the Axe is taken out of its
vault at the American Trust Com
pany. they won't think it's being
stolen.
The major question once the
Axe is in is how long it will stay
there. If we retain it after Nov.
22, Cal may come down to take it
anyway. Until then. Stanford will
have to watch out for inside jobs.
Remember 1956?
