# Soviet Premier Demands End to Berlin Occupation
## Hints West's Free Airlift, Communication Rights Void 
### 
MOSCOW (/I 1 ) â€” Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev Monday de
manded an end to four-power occupation of Berlin. lie hinted the
Soviet Union is ready to free itself of treaty obligations to the West
on freedom of transport between isolated West Berlin and West Ger
many.
The Soviet leader told a Polish-Soviet friendship meeting ;il Lenin

Stadium "the lime has evidently
come for the powers which signed
the Potsdam agreement to give
up the remnants of the occupa
tion regime in Berlin."
The United States, Britain and
West Germany all turned a cold
shoulder on the idea.
Khrushchev declared the West
ern powers "long ago abolished
that legal basis on which their
stay in Berlin rests" and on which
rights of communication between
West Germany and West Berlin
depend.
Denunciation
Denouncing the Western pow
ers, which he claims had fos
tered militarism in West Ger
many, he declared: "And on top
of everything they enjoy the right
of unhampered communication
between West Berlin and West
Germany by air, rail, highways
and the waterways of the Ger
man Democratic Republic (East
Germany), which they do not
even wish to recognize."
He said the Soviet Union had
every reason "to free ourselves
of those obsolete treaty obliga
tions bound up with the Potsdam
agreement to which the Western
powers are clinging."
"Form Own Relations"
Let the three Western powers,
he declared, "form their own re
lations with the German Demo
cratic Republic and come to an
agreement with it if they are in
terested in certain questions con
cerning Berlin."
Having thus made the points
that the four-power occupation of
Berlin should cease, that Western
rights of free transport and com
munication with Berlin are obso
lete and that the Western powers
should deal with East Germany
regarding the future of Berlin, he
declared the Soviet Union will go
to East Germany's aid if it is at
tacked by the Western powers.
Washington Reaction
In Washington, the State De
partment called attention to a
statement last week by Secretary
of State Dulles which said "We
are most solemnly committed to
hold West Berlin, if need be by
force. That is a very solemn and
formal three-power commitment
to which the United States stands
hound. I think as long as we
stand firm there, and the Commu
nists know we will stand firm,
that there is no danger to West
Berlin."
Western officials in Berlin saw
Khrushchev's demand for an end
to four-power rule in Berlin as
an effort to boost the sagging
prestige of the East German
Communist regime.
