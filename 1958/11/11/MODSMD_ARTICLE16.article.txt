# Cal to Present French Farce
## 
### 
University of California's Thea
ter Group will present Victorien
Sardou's French farce, "Let's Get
a Divorce," in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday.
It is the first in a series of ex
change shows under an agree
ment reached between UC and
Stanford last spring, which pro
vides for exchanges of graduate
students, library privileges and
cultural activities.
Sardou, a contemporary of
George Bernard Shaw, offers a
neat plot switch in which a wom
an connives with her husband to
be unfaithful to her lover in a
kind of left-handed, indirect sup
port of the sanctity of marriage.
Leading roles are played by UC
students Karen Walker, Don In
graham and William Harrison.
Tickets are on sale at the Me
morial Auditorium box office and
at the Encina office of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises at $1
general admission and 73 cents
for students.
