# Own Decision
## 
### 
''It's yolk decision." This is a common phrase on the campus
as students find themselves freed from the restrictions of high
school and home.
It is almost entirely one's own decision how he spends his time
and how he develops his interests.
Among these interests may he that in the student government.
Vi e feel this is a vital part of campus life and learning, hut we
recognize that some students are simply and sincerely not in
terested. There are those who have the attitude that student gov
eminent is "beneath them." I heir attitude, we feel, is too narrow.
We do not intend to ware the banner and say every
one run for office, or everyone get out and vote. We don't
want unqualified people in office or uninformed voters.
We do wish to urge, however, that students think a moment
about the student government before deciding they are not in
terested. We ask them to think about what they would like to
see the student government do; for certainly, directly or indirect
ly, student government affects each student, even ii it is chiefly
through the $5 of the tuition money which goes to the ASSU each
quarter.
The student government has many branches—nearly
every student organization on campus is chartered under
ASSU bylaws. Some $38,000 is channeled through the
ASSLJ each year.
The student government is the official liaison with the Univer
sity administrative officers. Through the student government com
mimical ion with the faculty is increased (Student-Faculty Com
mission, for instance).
Student leaders are always glad to talk to their constituents
anil answer questions as well as implement their ideas.
Today the voting begins in the primary elections for
freshman class offices, Men's and ff omen s (.ouncds posi
tions, and the Legislature —all important to the function
ing of tin' student government.
We urge all students to take another look at the importance
of student government to themselves, and, ii they decide favorably
—which we think in most cases they will—to review the candi
dates and to vote with a mind toward improving and strengthen
ing the ASSU. *
