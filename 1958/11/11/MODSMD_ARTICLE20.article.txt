Editor, The Daily:
I read with only faint interest
your umpteenth issue devoted al
most exclusively to football and
"school spirit," and feel compelled
to comment. For, if nothing else,
The Daily deserves comment.
Surely many Stanford students
read with some humiliation the
impassioned letter of Prince
Lightfoot, wherein he expressed
his extreme disappointment, and
rightly so, with the "revolting
conduct" of the students leaving
the game last Saturday. Here is a
man who has devoted years to the
service of the Stanford football
team. He feels a great affection
and closeness to his friends on the
team and to Stanford. He is no
"fair-weather" friend. It is sad in
deed that he had to suffer so at
this thoughtless, indeed childish,
display. Those at fault owe him
a large, personal apology. Let's
hope he gets a few.
However, the greater issue here
is this: many people, certain alum
ni and the present editor especial
ly, fail to realize that America's
wars are not won on the playing
fields of Stanford. Educational
institutions have been in exist
ence for literally thousands of
vears, and somehow many of
them have managed to struggle
along without a rooting section.
Sorbonne. rah? Yippee, Heidel
berg?
There are around 8300 students
at this University—B3oo individ
uals leading 8300 different, sepa
rate lives, heading in as many di
rections. Why must they con
cern themselves to the point of
distraction with the activities of
40-odd students who are, so they
tell us, out there solely because
they love the game? Can you
measure the value of a college by
the score on the board? No! The
measure of a university is the
character of/ her graduates, and
character is not developed with
card stunts. It comes from asso
ciation with many other, different
personalities. College brings new
interests, new values. It should
not merely extend high school
into adulthood.
Football is a fine sport. It re
quires thinking. Really, it does.
But somehow, when one sees or
joins x - thousands of people
tromping down that ramp into
the Stadium on Saturday, a com
parison to the Chicago Stock
Yards is irresistible. George Or

well ("1984," and all that) would
be delighted, I'm sure.
Let's get a few points straight
right now. Stanford, most of us
acknowledge, is one of the finest
schools in the country. However,
it is sadly lacking in many areas.
Many of the facilities, such as the
libraries, need modernization in a
hurry. The Chemistry building is
nothing less than a disgrace. The
new buildings going up on cam
pus show an embarrassing lack
of taste and forethought. Faculty
salaries are the lowest in the
area. In short, Stanford is not
gaining—it is losing ground. The
course has been set, the engines
fired up, and full speed ahead we
are ploughing into oblivion.
If the students' newspaper con
tinues its tireless crusade for con
formity at all costs (cf. $280 for
Axe, etc.), and fails to encourage
some form of individuality, then
we may yet see the destruction
of this Gomorrah we call home,
and Mrs. Stanford as a pillar of
salt.

Editor, The Daily:
I read with only faint interest
your umpteenth issue devoted al
most exclusively to football and
"school spirit," and feel compelled
to comment. For, if nothing else,
The Daily deserves comment.
Surely many Stanford students
read with some humiliation the
impassioned letter of Prince
Lightfoot, wherein he expressed
his extreme disappointment, and
rightly so, with the "revolting
conduct" of the students leaving
the game last Saturday. Here is a
man who has devoted years to the
service of the Stanford football
team. He feels a great affection
and closeness to his friends on the
team and to Stanford. He is no
"fair-weather" friend. It is sad in
deed that he had to suffer so at
this thoughtless, indeed childish,
display. Those at fault owe him
a large, personal apology. Let's
hope he gets a few.
However, the greater issue here
is this: many people, certain alum
ni and the present editor especial
ly, fail to realize that America's
wars are not won on the playing
fields of Stanford. Educational
institutions have been in exist
ence for literally thousands of
vears, and somehow many of
them have managed to struggle
along without a rooting section.
Sorbonne. rah? Yippee, Heidel
berg?
There are around 8300 students
at this University—B3oo individ
uals leading 8300 different, sepa
rate lives, heading in as many di
rections. Why must they con
cern themselves to the point of
distraction with the activities of
40-odd students who are, so they
tell us, out there solely because
they love the game? Can you
measure the value of a college by
the score on the board? No! The
measure of a university is the
character of/ her graduates, and
character is not developed with
card stunts. It comes from asso
ciation with many other, different
personalities. College brings new
interests, new values. It should
not merely extend high school
into adulthood.
Football is a fine sport. It re
quires thinking. Really, it does.
But somehow, when one sees or
joins x - thousands of people
tromping down that ramp into
the Stadium on Saturday, a com
parison to the Chicago Stock
Yards is irresistible. George Or

well ("1984," and all that) would
be delighted, I'm sure.
Let's get a few points straight
right now. Stanford, most of us
acknowledge, is one of the finest
schools in the country. However,
it is sadly lacking in many areas.
Many of the facilities, such as the
libraries, need modernization in a
hurry. The Chemistry building is
nothing less than a disgrace. The
new buildings going up on cam
pus show an embarrassing lack
of taste and forethought. Faculty
salaries are the lowest in the
area. In short, Stanford is not
gaining—it is losing ground. The
course has been set, the engines
fired up, and full speed ahead we
are ploughing into oblivion.
If the students' newspaper con
tinues its tireless crusade for con
formity at all costs (cf. $280 for
Axe, etc.), and fails to encourage
some form of individuality, then
we may yet see the destruction
of this Gomorrah we call home,
and Mrs. Stanford as a pillar of
salt.

Let's get a few points straight
right now. Stanford, most of us
acknowledge, is one of the finest
schools in the country. However,
it is sadly lacking in many areas.
Many of the facilities, such as the
libraries, need modernization in a
hurry. The Chemistry building is
nothing less than a disgrace. The
new buildings going up on cam
pus show an embarrassing lack
of taste and forethought. Faculty
salaries are the lowest in the
area. In short, Stanford is not
gaining—it is losing ground. The
course has been set, the engines
fired up, and full speed ahead we
are ploughing into oblivion.
If the students' newspaper con
tinues its tireless crusade for con
formity at all costs (cf. $280 for
Axe, etc.), and fails to encourage
some form of individuality, then
we may yet see the destruction
of this Gomorrah we call home,
and Mrs. Stanford as a pillar of
salt.

Editor, The Daily:
I read with only faint interest
your umpteenth issue devoted al
most exclusively to football and
"school spirit," and feel compelled
to comment. For, if nothing else,
The Daily deserves comment.
Surely many Stanford students
read with some humiliation the
impassioned letter of Prince
Lightfoot, wherein he expressed
his extreme disappointment, and
rightly so, with the "revolting
conduct" of the students leaving
the game last Saturday. Here is a
man who has devoted years to the
service of the Stanford football
team. He feels a great affection
and closeness to his friends on the
team and to Stanford. He is no
"fair-weather" friend. It is sad in
deed that he had to suffer so at
this thoughtless, indeed childish,
display. Those at fault owe him
a large, personal apology. Let's
hope he gets a few.
However, the greater issue here
is this: many people, certain alum
ni and the present editor especial
ly, fail to realize that America's
wars are not won on the playing
fields of Stanford. Educational
institutions have been in exist
ence for literally thousands of
vears, and somehow many of
them have managed to struggle
along without a rooting section.
Sorbonne. rah? Yippee, Heidel
berg?
There are around 8300 students
at this University—B3oo individ
uals leading 8300 different, sepa
rate lives, heading in as many di
rections. Why must they con
cern themselves to the point of
distraction with the activities of
40-odd students who are, so they
tell us, out there solely because
they love the game? Can you
measure the value of a college by
the score on the board? No! The
measure of a university is the
character of/ her graduates, and
character is not developed with
card stunts. It comes from asso
ciation with many other, different
personalities. College brings new
interests, new values. It should
not merely extend high school
into adulthood.
Football is a fine sport. It re
quires thinking. Really, it does.
But somehow, when one sees or
joins x - thousands of people
tromping down that ramp into
the Stadium on Saturday, a com
parison to the Chicago Stock
Yards is irresistible. George Or

well ("1984," and all that) would
be delighted, I'm sure.
