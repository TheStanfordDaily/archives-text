# Kendall Disagrees With Schweitzer
## 
### Howard Richards 
"These are, I repeat, lies, and
Dr. Schweitzer is—not a liar, for
to say that would be to say he
knows better —a purveyor of false
hoods."
So wrole Willmoore Kendall,
visiting professor of political sci
ence, in a recent article published
in National Review.
Reviewing Dr. Albert Schweitz
er's new book, "Peace or Atomic
War," Kendall charges Schweitzer
with failure to distinguish be
tween the "intolerable" and the
false.
Schweitzer, says Kendall, at
tempts to deny the truth of cer
tain propositions about the cold

war simply because the logical
consequences of those proposi
tions are "intolerable."
The propositions:
• Nuclear tests are a necessary
part of a general defense against
Communism.
• Rivalry between the United
States and the Soviet Union may
lead to an atomic war.
• A summit conference, wore
one to be held, would accomplish
nothing.
These facts are intolerable, says
Dr. Schweitzer; "the summit con
ference must not fail. . . . We can
not continue in this paralyizng
mistrust."
"Not even when the mistrust is
clearly justified by the facts?"
asks Kendall. Is the spread of
Communism over the entire earth
"tolerable, in some sense in which
the possibilities Schweitzer stress
es are not tolerable?"
Kendall occupies the chair for
merly held by Mulford Sibley, who
has now returned to the Univer
sity of Minnesota.
