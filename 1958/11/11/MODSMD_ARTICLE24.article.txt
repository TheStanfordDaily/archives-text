(Editor's Note: May we di
rect your attention to today's
editorial on the student elec
tions. We have ever realized
that interests vary on this cam
pus; but we do urge that stu
dents open their minds enough
to consider the possibilities and
potential offered in student ac
tivities. We also suggest that
you channel some of your
"faint interest" toward Wednes
day's and Thursday's edito
rials.)
