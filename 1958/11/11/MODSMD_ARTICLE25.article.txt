## Back from Russia 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
(This is flie first of four
articles written after a recent
visit to Moscow.)

During the last two weeks of
October my wife and I were in
the Soviet Union, almost all of
the time in Moscow. We traveled
as tourists, although we had dis
cussed our visit with the Soviet
embassy in Washington and it had
been agreed in advance that my
main purpose would be to under
stand Soviet foreign policy in re
lation to .the United States.
Except for a bit of sightseeing
in Leningrad, we did not go any
where else in the vast expanses
of the Soviet Union, and I know
nothing at firsthand about the in
ternal condition of the Soviet
Union.
But from a long interview with
Mr. Khrushchev himself, supple
mented by talks with Soviet offi
cials and Soviet editors, 1 think 1
came to understand better than 1
had before what are the main
springs and the controlling ideas
of Soviet foreign policy.
I shall begin this series of
articles with an account in two
parts of the interview with
Mr. K. I have to divide it be
cause tiie account is long; for
the interview covered much
ground and lasted for two
hours.
I must set down the circum
stances.
For the first week of our visit
in Moscow there was no definite
appointment. Mr. K. had been
away in the south, and when he
came to Moscow he was involved
in the negotiations with Field
Marshal Amer, who, representing
President Nasser, negotiated the
agreement which deals with the
Aswan Dam—and, no doubt, with
many other things.
Between the departure of the
field marshal and the scheduled
arrival of Mr. Gomulka and the
Polish delegation, Mr. K. had, it
appears, a free day. An appoint
ment was fixed for that day at
11 a.m. in his office in the
Kremlin.
We were told to be ready at our
hotel 20 minutes in advance, and
that an official from the State
Committee for Cultural Relations

with Foreign Countries wo u 1 d
come lor us in a car.
Tourists cannot drive into the
Kremlin precincts, but after 1 our
car had been identified we were
led by a police car to the door of
a building in one of the inner
courts of the Kremlin palace.
There we were met by an officer
who escorted us to an anteroom
next to Mr. K.'s office. There was
no one else in sight.
Unlike the offices of any oth
er chief of government that 1
have ever visited, there were no
guards; there were no other
people waiting; there were no
secretaries c a r r y in g papers
around; there were, of course,
no newspapermen; and there
was no n e of the hustle and
hustle which usually prevail in
the outer rooms of busy and
important officials.
Somewhere and somehow, Mr.
K. must do a great deal of work
and must see a great many peo
ple. But there was no outward
sign of it. When we were shown
into his office, which was on the
dot of 11 a.m., he was quite re
laxed, had none of llie symptoms
of a busy and preoccupied man,
and indeed he acted as if he had
aJI the time in the world.
In tlre course of the interview it
was evident that he wanted to talk
about Soviet - American relations
and about nothing else. But on
this subject he seemed ready to
talk as long as I wanted, provided
1 kept asking him about the broad
issues and did not try to get into
the details of any particular ne
gotiation.
His office in the Kremlin is a
long, rectangular room with a
long, rectangular table for con
ferences and, at the end, what
seemed to be a very small desk
for the ruler of a vast empire.
The desk, moreover, was clut
tered with gadgets —rather like
President Franklin Roosevelt's
desk in the White House —and
with a large model of what I
suppose was a jet airplane.
At the interview, which took
place at one end of the long table,
there were besides Mr. K. himself
his interpreter, Mr. Troyanowski,
son of the former Soviet ambas

sudor to Washington; Yuri Zhu
kov (no relation of the marshal's),
who is head of the State Commit
tee tor Cultural Relations with
Foreign Countries; my wife; and
myself. There was no stenogra
pher present, nor was there any
visible recording machine.
But Mr. Zhukov took notes; my
wife took notes; Mr. Troyanowski
made memoranda for his trans
lations; and I, when 1 remembered
to put my mind on it, took some
notes also. There is, therefore, no
official record; and at the end of
the interview, while we were
drinking the mineral water which
his doctor had ordered him to
drink, I asked Mr. K. to tell me
under what conditions I could use
what he had said.
He waved aside the question,
saying I could do what 1 liked
with what he had said, but that
he hoped 1 would not do any
damage to Soviet-American re
lations!
As this left me wilh my con
science as my guide, I feel that
tlie right Ihing to do is to report
the story of the interview with
explanations but without editorial
argument.
Because there is no written rec
ord, I shall refrain from attempt
ing to quote Mr. K. directly, ex
cept for certain phrases which I
wrote down at the time in my
notes. On the other hand, I must
set down as true an account as I
can of what 1 understood him to
say and of what I believe he
meant.

of a busy and preoccupied man,
and indeed he acted as if he had
aJI the time in the world.
In tlre course of the interview it
was evident that he wanted to talk
about Soviet - American relations
and about nothing else. But on
this subject he seemed ready to
talk as long as I wanted, provided
1 kept asking him about the broad
issues and did not try to get into
the details of any particular ne
gotiation.
His office in the Kremlin is a
long, rectangular room with a
long, rectangular table for con
ferences and, at the end, what
seemed to be a very small desk
for the ruler of a vast empire.
The desk, moreover, was clut
tered with gadgets —rather like
President Franklin Roosevelt's
desk in the White House —and
with a large model of what I
suppose was a jet airplane.
At the interview, which took
place at one end of the long table,
there were besides Mr. K. himself
his interpreter, Mr. Troyanowski,
son of the former Soviet ambas

sudor to Washington; Yuri Zhu
kov (no relation of the marshal's),
who is head of the State Commit
tee tor Cultural Relations with
Foreign Countries; my wife; and
myself. There was no stenogra
pher present, nor was there any
visible recording machine.
But Mr. Zhukov took notes; my
wife took notes; Mr. Troyanowski
made memoranda for his trans
lations; and I, when 1 remembered
to put my mind on it, took some
notes also. There is, therefore, no
official record; and at the end of
the interview, while we were
drinking the mineral water which
his doctor had ordered him to
drink, I asked Mr. K. to tell me
under what conditions I could use
what he had said.
He waved aside the question,
saying I could do what 1 liked
with what he had said, but that
he hoped 1 would not do any
damage to Soviet-American re
lations!
As this left me wilh my con
science as my guide, I feel that
tlie right Ihing to do is to report
the story of the interview with
explanations but without editorial
argument.
Because there is no written rec
ord, I shall refrain from attempt
ing to quote Mr. K. directly, ex
cept for certain phrases which I
wrote down at the time in my
notes. On the other hand, I must
set down as true an account as I
can of what 1 understood him to
say and of what I believe he
meant.
(This is flie first of four
articles written after a recent
visit to Moscow.)

During the last two weeks of
October my wife and I were in
the Soviet Union, almost all of
the time in Moscow. We traveled
as tourists, although we had dis
cussed our visit with the Soviet
embassy in Washington and it had
been agreed in advance that my
main purpose would be to under
stand Soviet foreign policy in re
lation to .the United States.
Except for a bit of sightseeing
in Leningrad, we did not go any
where else in the vast expanses
of the Soviet Union, and I know
nothing at firsthand about the in
ternal condition of the Soviet
Union.
But from a long interview with
Mr. Khrushchev himself, supple
mented by talks with Soviet offi
cials and Soviet editors, 1 think 1
came to understand better than 1
had before what are the main
springs and the controlling ideas
of Soviet foreign policy.
I shall begin this series of
articles with an account in two
parts of the interview with
Mr. K. I have to divide it be
cause tiie account is long; for
the interview covered much
ground and lasted for two
hours.
I must set down the circum
stances.
For the first week of our visit
in Moscow there was no definite
appointment. Mr. K. had been
away in the south, and when he
came to Moscow he was involved
in the negotiations with Field
Marshal Amer, who, representing
President Nasser, negotiated the
agreement which deals with the
Aswan Dam—and, no doubt, with
many other things.
Between the departure of the
field marshal and the scheduled
arrival of Mr. Gomulka and the
Polish delegation, Mr. K. had, it
appears, a free day. An appoint
ment was fixed for that day at
11 a.m. in his office in the
Kremlin.
We were told to be ready at our
hotel 20 minutes in advance, and
that an official from the State
Committee for Cultural Relations

with Foreign Countries wo u 1 d
come lor us in a car.
Tourists cannot drive into the
Kremlin precincts, but after 1 our
car had been identified we were
led by a police car to the door of
a building in one of the inner
courts of the Kremlin palace.
There we were met by an officer
who escorted us to an anteroom
next to Mr. K.'s office. There was
no one else in sight.
Unlike the offices of any oth
er chief of government that 1
have ever visited, there were no
guards; there were no other
people waiting; there were no
secretaries c a r r y in g papers
around; there were, of course,
no newspapermen; and there
was no n e of the hustle and
hustle which usually prevail in
the outer rooms of busy and
important officials.
Somewhere and somehow, Mr.
K. must do a great deal of work
and must see a great many peo
ple. But there was no outward
sign of it. When we were shown
into his office, which was on the
dot of 11 a.m., he was quite re
laxed, had none of llie symptoms
of a busy and preoccupied man,
and indeed he acted as if he had
aJI the time in the world.

nothing at firsthand about the in
ternal condition of the Soviet
Union.
But from a long interview with
Mr. Khrushchev himself, supple
mented by talks with Soviet offi
cials and Soviet editors, 1 think 1
came to understand better than 1
had before what are the main
springs and the controlling ideas
of Soviet foreign policy.
I shall begin this series of
articles with an account in two
parts of the interview with
Mr. K. I have to divide it be
cause tiie account is long; for
the interview covered much
ground and lasted for two
hours.
I must set down the circum
stances.
For the first week of our visit
in Moscow there was no definite
appointment. Mr. K. had been
away in the south, and when he
came to Moscow he was involved
in the negotiations with Field
Marshal Amer, who, representing
President Nasser, negotiated the
agreement which deals with the
Aswan Dam—and, no doubt, with
many other things.
Between the departure of the
field marshal and the scheduled
arrival of Mr. Gomulka and the
Polish delegation, Mr. K. had, it
appears, a free day. An appoint
ment was fixed for that day at
11 a.m. in his office in the
Kremlin.
We were told to be ready at our
hotel 20 minutes in advance, and
that an official from the State
Committee for Cultural Relations

with Foreign Countries wo u 1 d
come lor us in a car.
Tourists cannot drive into the
Kremlin precincts, but after 1 our
car had been identified we were
led by a police car to the door of
a building in one of the inner
courts of the Kremlin palace.
There we were met by an officer
who escorted us to an anteroom
next to Mr. K.'s office. There was
no one else in sight.
Unlike the offices of any oth
er chief of government that 1
have ever visited, there were no
guards; there were no other
people waiting; there were no
secretaries c a r r y in g papers
around; there were, of course,
no newspapermen; and there
was no n e of the hustle and
hustle which usually prevail in
the outer rooms of busy and
important officials.
Somewhere and somehow, Mr.
K. must do a great deal of work
and must see a great many peo
ple. But there was no outward
sign of it. When we were shown
into his office, which was on the
dot of 11 a.m., he was quite re
laxed, had none of llie symptoms
of a busy and preoccupied man,
and indeed he acted as if he had
aJI the time in the world.
In tlre course of the interview it
was evident that he wanted to talk
about Soviet - American relations
and about nothing else. But on
this subject he seemed ready to
talk as long as I wanted, provided
1 kept asking him about the broad
issues and did not try to get into
the details of any particular ne
gotiation.
His office in the Kremlin is a
long, rectangular room with a
long, rectangular table for con
ferences and, at the end, what
seemed to be a very small desk
for the ruler of a vast empire.
The desk, moreover, was clut
tered with gadgets —rather like
President Franklin Roosevelt's
desk in the White House —and
with a large model of what I
suppose was a jet airplane.
At the interview, which took
place at one end of the long table,
there were besides Mr. K. himself
his interpreter, Mr. Troyanowski,
son of the former Soviet ambas

sudor to Washington; Yuri Zhu
kov (no relation of the marshal's),
who is head of the State Commit
tee tor Cultural Relations with
Foreign Countries; my wife; and
myself. There was no stenogra
pher present, nor was there any
visible recording machine.
But Mr. Zhukov took notes; my
wife took notes; Mr. Troyanowski
made memoranda for his trans
lations; and I, when 1 remembered
to put my mind on it, took some
notes also. There is, therefore, no
official record; and at the end of
the interview, while we were
drinking the mineral water which
his doctor had ordered him to
drink, I asked Mr. K. to tell me
under what conditions I could use
what he had said.
He waved aside the question,
saying I could do what 1 liked
with what he had said, but that
he hoped 1 would not do any
damage to Soviet-American re
lations!
As this left me wilh my con
science as my guide, I feel that
tlie right Ihing to do is to report
the story of the interview with
explanations but without editorial
argument.
Because there is no written rec
ord, I shall refrain from attempt
ing to quote Mr. K. directly, ex
cept for certain phrases which I
wrote down at the time in my
notes. On the other hand, I must
set down as true an account as I
can of what 1 understood him to
say and of what I believe he
meant.

articles written after a recent
visit to Moscow.)

During the last two weeks of
October my wife and I were in
the Soviet Union, almost all of
the time in Moscow. We traveled
as tourists, although we had dis
cussed our visit with the Soviet
embassy in Washington and it had
been agreed in advance that my
main purpose would be to under
stand Soviet foreign policy in re
lation to .the United States.

in Leningrad, we did not go any
where else in the vast expanses

for the ruler of a vast empire.
The desk, moreover, was clut
tered with gadgets —rather like
President Franklin Roosevelt's
desk in the White House —and
with a large model of what I
suppose was a jet airplane.
At the interview, which took
place at one end of the long table,
there were besides Mr. K. himself
his interpreter, Mr. Troyanowski,
son of the former Soviet ambas

sudor to Washington; Yuri Zhu
kov (no relation of the marshal's),
who is head of the State Commit
tee tor Cultural Relations with
Foreign Countries; my wife; and
myself. There was no stenogra
pher present, nor was there any
visible recording machine.
But Mr. Zhukov took notes; my
wife took notes; Mr. Troyanowski
made memoranda for his trans
lations; and I, when 1 remembered
to put my mind on it, took some
notes also. There is, therefore, no
official record; and at the end of
the interview, while we were
drinking the mineral water which
his doctor had ordered him to
drink, I asked Mr. K. to tell me
under what conditions I could use
what he had said.
He waved aside the question,
saying I could do what 1 liked
with what he had said, but that
he hoped 1 would not do any
damage to Soviet-American re
lations!
As this left me wilh my con
science as my guide, I feel that
tlie right Ihing to do is to report
the story of the interview with
explanations but without editorial
argument.
Because there is no written rec
ord, I shall refrain from attempt
ing to quote Mr. K. directly, ex
cept for certain phrases which I
wrote down at the time in my
notes. On the other hand, I must
set down as true an account as I
can of what 1 understood him to
say and of what I believe he
meant.
