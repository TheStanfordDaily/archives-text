What a Shock—liaek-to-Baek Upsets
It's sure nice to see one of those rare happenings around Stanford
—a team that pulls off a big upset, then comes back with another
one the next week.
Howie Da dinar's basketballers had their share of such happenings
last winter, but it's taken until this fall for any other Indian team
to duplicate the feat.
The men of the hour in this particular instance are the six who
make up the Stanford cross-country squad. Last week, il was Stan
ford over IiSC for the first time in history. This week, it was the
Cards over California and UCLA in a pair of dual meets and it was
done on a strange course.
Payton Jordan said after the Trojan upset that his men would
have to look out for that old enemy of Stanford athletics, overconfi
dence. Apparently Keith Wallace, Doug" Martin, Bob Monzingo, John
Northway, Al Ahumada and Kim Maxwell didn't let the first shocker
go to their heads, because they certainly ran some of the Bears and
Bruins into the ground.
The first three, in particular, looked outstanding. Wallace had lost
to IJCLA's Ken Hiding just two weeks before in Los Angeles. This
time, he didn't let Ruling get within fiO yards after the opening mile
of the race.
Martin, apparently ovei a variety of ills and ailments which have
plagued him for two years, was a picture of determination as he
routed the best Cal and UCLA could offer over the final half-mile.
And Mon/.ingo was nearly as good as the first two, getting home
ahead of a pack of four Bruins. Had even one of these four beaten
Monzingo, it would have meant defeat for the Tribe.
Now Stanford finds itself in the unusual position of being gunned
for by the rest of the clubs in the league. Come Nov. Jit) and the
Pacific Coasl Conference championships here, and the Bears, Bruins
and Trojans will all be shooting to revenge their losses to the Cards.
Throw in the strong distance teams from Idaho and the rest of the
Northwest, and il begins to look as though Stanford will be hosting
one of the finest harrier meets ever held in the Wesl.
Let's Have Credit Where It's Due
There seems 1o be a situation of mistaken credit which is about
due for some clearing up. During Saturday's telecast of the Stanford-
Oregon game, the announcer mentioned that Jack Curtice used to be
called Cactus Jack, but that now he was Eucalyptus Jack, thanks to
bon lticlunan, the athletic publicist at USC.
Don m;iy have passed along the moniker of Eucalyptus J., but the
originator of the localized nickname was a Stanford junior, Eric.
Nelte. Nelte came out with his gem last winter, shortly after Curtice
got the Stanford job.
This year's sports editor and last year's columnist, Steve Baffrey,
picked it up from Nelte and used it in his Grandstand View column.
A few days later, Dick Friendlicli picked it up for the Chronicle. As
sociated Press latched on to it next, and soon it was seen in the Los
Angeles prints. Richman apparently passed it along there some
where, but rightfully, the credit belongs to our man, Nelte.
New Year's Thoughts
It's getting close to bowl selection time, and we've got a few ideas
of our own about how we'd like to see the five major games line up.
ROSE BOWL: Not much choice here, with lowa already in and
Cal looking more and more like the Western rep. Of course the Bears
might not find it so easy to make their reservations after the Cactus
troops get through with them in Game—like we hope they will.
No matter who goes, though, it looks like a solid win for the Hawk
eyes.
SUGAR BOWL: Louisiana State shouldn't have any trouble mak
ing it here. If we had our way and the brass would go along with
it, Army would make the Tigers a darned good opponent.
COTTON BOWL: Flip a coin to decide among Rice, TCU and
SMU for the host berth. We'll take Rice, and then toss another coin
to see if Pitt or Syracuse will get the other spot. Here's hoping the
coin comes up for the Orangemen.
ORANGE BOWL: Missouri and Oklahoma, both unbeaten in the
Big Eight, fight it out for one spot. Maybe the Sooners will have to
be content with about a four-TD victory in this showdown. Some
thing along the lines of Pitt, Syracuse or North Carolina should have
the pleasure of pulling a near-upset on New Year's Day against Bud
Wilkinson's troops.
GATOR BOWL: This is the one where we're hot to see a match
between Rutgers and the Air Force. Both clubs are unbeaten—what
more could you want. Rutgers has smashed all sorts of opposition,
and has in Billy Austin one of the most colorful backs in the nation.
The Air Force has lots of appeal just because of its newness to the
national picture. Maybe neither one of them has played the strong
est in opposition this year, but what the heck—it'd be a pretty even
match, probably a lot better game than the Rose Bowl.
Oh, well! Enough sounding off!

The first of the national basketball preview mags is out, and it
gives the men of Dallmar a good write-up. Picks them for third in
PCC, which is just about right. Of course we know they'll be about
two spots higher than that, but why suffer through the trouble of
being favored and having everyone shooting for you?

The men of the hour in this particular instance are the six who
make up the Stanford cross-country squad. Last week, il was Stan
ford over IiSC for the first time in history. This week, it was the
Cards over California and UCLA in a pair of dual meets and it was
done on a strange course.
Payton Jordan said after the Trojan upset that his men would
have to look out for that old enemy of Stanford athletics, overconfi
dence. Apparently Keith Wallace, Doug" Martin, Bob Monzingo, John
Northway, Al Ahumada and Kim Maxwell didn't let the first shocker
go to their heads, because they certainly ran some of the Bears and
Bruins into the ground.
The first three, in particular, looked outstanding. Wallace had lost
to IJCLA's Ken Hiding just two weeks before in Los Angeles. This
time, he didn't let Ruling get within fiO yards after the opening mile
of the race.
Martin, apparently ovei a variety of ills and ailments which have
plagued him for two years, was a picture of determination as he
routed the best Cal and UCLA could offer over the final half-mile.
And Mon/.ingo was nearly as good as the first two, getting home
ahead of a pack of four Bruins. Had even one of these four beaten
Monzingo, it would have meant defeat for the Tribe.
Now Stanford finds itself in the unusual position of being gunned
for by the rest of the clubs in the league. Come Nov. Jit) and the
Pacific Coasl Conference championships here, and the Bears, Bruins
and Trojans will all be shooting to revenge their losses to the Cards.
Throw in the strong distance teams from Idaho and the rest of the
Northwest, and il begins to look as though Stanford will be hosting
one of the finest harrier meets ever held in the Wesl.
Let's Have Credit Where It's Due
There seems 1o be a situation of mistaken credit which is about
due for some clearing up. During Saturday's telecast of the Stanford-
Oregon game, the announcer mentioned that Jack Curtice used to be
called Cactus Jack, but that now he was Eucalyptus Jack, thanks to
bon lticlunan, the athletic publicist at USC.
Don m;iy have passed along the moniker of Eucalyptus J., but the
originator of the localized nickname was a Stanford junior, Eric.
Nelte. Nelte came out with his gem last winter, shortly after Curtice
got the Stanford job.
This year's sports editor and last year's columnist, Steve Baffrey,
picked it up from Nelte and used it in his Grandstand View column.
A few days later, Dick Friendlicli picked it up for the Chronicle. As
sociated Press latched on to it next, and soon it was seen in the Los
Angeles prints. Richman apparently passed it along there some
where, but rightfully, the credit belongs to our man, Nelte.
New Year's Thoughts
It's getting close to bowl selection time, and we've got a few ideas
of our own about how we'd like to see the five major games line up.
ROSE BOWL: Not much choice here, with lowa already in and
Cal looking more and more like the Western rep. Of course the Bears
might not find it so easy to make their reservations after the Cactus
troops get through with them in Game—like we hope they will.
No matter who goes, though, it looks like a solid win for the Hawk
eyes.
SUGAR BOWL: Louisiana State shouldn't have any trouble mak
ing it here. If we had our way and the brass would go along with
it, Army would make the Tigers a darned good opponent.
COTTON BOWL: Flip a coin to decide among Rice, TCU and
SMU for the host berth. We'll take Rice, and then toss another coin
to see if Pitt or Syracuse will get the other spot. Here's hoping the
coin comes up for the Orangemen.
ORANGE BOWL: Missouri and Oklahoma, both unbeaten in the
Big Eight, fight it out for one spot. Maybe the Sooners will have to
be content with about a four-TD victory in this showdown. Some
thing along the lines of Pitt, Syracuse or North Carolina should have
the pleasure of pulling a near-upset on New Year's Day against Bud
Wilkinson's troops.
GATOR BOWL: This is the one where we're hot to see a match
between Rutgers and the Air Force. Both clubs are unbeaten—what
more could you want. Rutgers has smashed all sorts of opposition,
and has in Billy Austin one of the most colorful backs in the nation.
The Air Force has lots of appeal just because of its newness to the
national picture. Maybe neither one of them has played the strong
est in opposition this year, but what the heck—it'd be a pretty even
match, probably a lot better game than the Rose Bowl.
Oh, well! Enough sounding off!

The first of the national basketball preview mags is out, and it
gives the men of Dallmar a good write-up. Picks them for third in
PCC, which is just about right. Of course we know they'll be about
two spots higher than that, but why suffer through the trouble of
being favored and having everyone shooting for you?

What a Shock—liaek-to-Baek Upsets
It's sure nice to see one of those rare happenings around Stanford
—a team that pulls off a big upset, then comes back with another
one the next week.
Howie Da dinar's basketballers had their share of such happenings
last winter, but it's taken until this fall for any other Indian team
to duplicate the feat.

have to look out for that old enemy of Stanford athletics, overconfi
dence. Apparently Keith Wallace, Doug" Martin, Bob Monzingo, John
Northway, Al Ahumada and Kim Maxwell didn't let the first shocker
go to their heads, because they certainly ran some of the Bears and
Bruins into the ground.
The first three, in particular, looked outstanding. Wallace had lost
to IJCLA's Ken Hiding just two weeks before in Los Angeles. This
time, he didn't let Ruling get within fiO yards after the opening mile
of the race.
Martin, apparently ovei a variety of ills and ailments which have
plagued him for two years, was a picture of determination as he
routed the best Cal and UCLA could offer over the final half-mile.
And Mon/.ingo was nearly as good as the first two, getting home
ahead of a pack of four Bruins. Had even one of these four beaten
Monzingo, it would have meant defeat for the Tribe.
Now Stanford finds itself in the unusual position of being gunned
for by the rest of the clubs in the league. Come Nov. Jit) and the
Pacific Coasl Conference championships here, and the Bears, Bruins
and Trojans will all be shooting to revenge their losses to the Cards.
Throw in the strong distance teams from Idaho and the rest of the
Northwest, and il begins to look as though Stanford will be hosting
one of the finest harrier meets ever held in the Wesl.
Let's Have Credit Where It's Due
There seems 1o be a situation of mistaken credit which is about
due for some clearing up. During Saturday's telecast of the Stanford-
Oregon game, the announcer mentioned that Jack Curtice used to be
called Cactus Jack, but that now he was Eucalyptus Jack, thanks to
bon lticlunan, the athletic publicist at USC.
Don m;iy have passed along the moniker of Eucalyptus J., but the
originator of the localized nickname was a Stanford junior, Eric.
Nelte. Nelte came out with his gem last winter, shortly after Curtice
got the Stanford job.
This year's sports editor and last year's columnist, Steve Baffrey,
picked it up from Nelte and used it in his Grandstand View column.
A few days later, Dick Friendlicli picked it up for the Chronicle. As
sociated Press latched on to it next, and soon it was seen in the Los
Angeles prints. Richman apparently passed it along there some
where, but rightfully, the credit belongs to our man, Nelte.
New Year's Thoughts
It's getting close to bowl selection time, and we've got a few ideas
of our own about how we'd like to see the five major games line up.
ROSE BOWL: Not much choice here, with lowa already in and
Cal looking more and more like the Western rep. Of course the Bears
might not find it so easy to make their reservations after the Cactus
troops get through with them in Game—like we hope they will.
No matter who goes, though, it looks like a solid win for the Hawk
eyes.
SUGAR BOWL: Louisiana State shouldn't have any trouble mak
ing it here. If we had our way and the brass would go along with
it, Army would make the Tigers a darned good opponent.
COTTON BOWL: Flip a coin to decide among Rice, TCU and
SMU for the host berth. We'll take Rice, and then toss another coin
to see if Pitt or Syracuse will get the other spot. Here's hoping the
coin comes up for the Orangemen.
ORANGE BOWL: Missouri and Oklahoma, both unbeaten in the
Big Eight, fight it out for one spot. Maybe the Sooners will have to
be content with about a four-TD victory in this showdown. Some
thing along the lines of Pitt, Syracuse or North Carolina should have
the pleasure of pulling a near-upset on New Year's Day against Bud
Wilkinson's troops.
GATOR BOWL: This is the one where we're hot to see a match
between Rutgers and the Air Force. Both clubs are unbeaten—what
more could you want. Rutgers has smashed all sorts of opposition,
and has in Billy Austin one of the most colorful backs in the nation.
The Air Force has lots of appeal just because of its newness to the
national picture. Maybe neither one of them has played the strong
est in opposition this year, but what the heck—it'd be a pretty even
match, probably a lot better game than the Rose Bowl.
Oh, well! Enough sounding off!

The first of the national basketball preview mags is out, and it
gives the men of Dallmar a good write-up. Picks them for third in
PCC, which is just about right. Of course we know they'll be about
two spots higher than that, but why suffer through the trouble of
being favored and having everyone shooting for you?

What a Shock—liaek-to-Baek Upsets
It's sure nice to see one of those rare happenings around Stanford
—a team that pulls off a big upset, then comes back with another
one the next week.
Howie Da dinar's basketballers had their share of such happenings
last winter, but it's taken until this fall for any other Indian team
to duplicate the feat.
The men of the hour in this particular instance are the six who
make up the Stanford cross-country squad. Last week, il was Stan
ford over IiSC for the first time in history. This week, it was the
Cards over California and UCLA in a pair of dual meets and it was
done on a strange course.
