# Up and Down Beavers Next Indian Opponent
## 
### 
Stanford's fumbling Indians faro a tough north western fop in
Oregon State College this Saturday, as Coach Tommy Prothro's
orange and black Beavers come down and invade the Farm. By win
ning their remaining games the Cards theoretically have an oppor
tunity for a first-place lie in the conference and they certainly have

a good chance to defeat the up
and-down Beavers Saturday.
Oregon State is the real puzzler
in the league this year. The Bea
vers were picked as "best in the
West" preseason, rated in the top
10 teams of the nation and had
been favored to win every game
on their schedule.

However, the tough Halloween
men have been upset by SC, WSC
and Wyoming and stand second
(behind Cal) in the.. Rose Bowl
race.
Injuries and the tragic loss of
All-Coast center Buzz Randall,
who died from leukemia before
the season started, may certainly
have affected the outcome of some
of the defeats, but Prothro is al
ways the first man to disallow
these injuries as the cause for
losses.
Fine Record
Coach Prothro is in his fourth
year at the helm of the Beavers
and has compiled an impressive
21 won, 8 lost and 1 tied record.
The Beavers use Red Sanders'
UCLA-style single wing as Pro
thro brought it with him when he
came north. Prothro was Sanders'
assistant and played under the
late coach, so one can observe
many similarities between OSC
and UCLA play.
The Beaver single wing's basis
is power and slowly - developing

plays. Oregon State has stuck
closely to power plays, with the
tailback and fullback carrying, or
to the famous wing-back reverse,
which killed Stanford in the 20-19
defeat down' here two years ago.
This season, besides a potent
ground attack, the Orange and
Black is also throwing the ball;
so this Saturday's clash should
prove quite interesting.
