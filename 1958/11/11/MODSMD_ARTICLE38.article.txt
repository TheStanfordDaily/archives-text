THE CLOTHES YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN
In tliis column we take up fashions for college men, which means
of course, the Ivy Look. Today's Ivy Look clothes have made a
great stride forward. Not only do they have thin lapels, three but
tons, narrow trousers, and a minimum of shoulder padding, but
—now hear this!—this year they are actually covcred with ivy!
This new development, while attractive beyond the singing
of it, nevertheless gives rise to certain hazards. For instance,
people keep trying to plant you on Arbor Day. Indeed, this is
precisely what happened to two SAE's of my acquaintance,
Walter 11. Gurlash and Fred Rasp. Before they could protest,
they were snatched up, planted, limed, and watered, and today
they support a hummock in Cut and Shoot, Vermont.

I.of, us now discuss sliirfs. Again this year the campus favorite
is the good old Oxford with button-down collar and barrel
culTs. This is without doubt an admirable garment, but let me
ask you a question: if you don't wear anything but Oxfords,
what do you do with nil the cuff links people have been giving
you for your birthday since you were twelve years old?
Well sir, some fellows have their wrists pierced, but what E.
Mackenzie Sigafoos, a Chi Psi of my acquaintance, did was to
take a dozen pairs of his handsome gold monogrammed cuff
links and string them together in a charm bracelet for his girl,
Jo-Carol Isobar.
(ll turned out, incidentally, to be a mistake. In short order
so many admirers accrued to Jo-Carol on account of her gor
geous bracelet that she grew tired of plain old E. Mackenzie,
and fine night when she was seated on a bench in Lovers Lane
throwing sticks for E. Mackenzie to retrieve, she suddenly,
cruelly, without warning, told him they were through.
"I am heartbroken," said E. Mackenzie, heartbroken. "But
if go you must, give me back my charm bracelet."
"No, I will keep it," said Jo-Carol.
"What for?" said E. Mackenzie. "You can't wear it. The
initials on the cuff links arc all mine—E.M.S."
"ITa, ha, the joke is on you," said Jo-Carol. "Yesterday I was
voted Miss Chinese Restaurant of 1958."
"So?" said E. Mackenzie.
"So," replied Jo-Carol, "E.M.S. does not stand for E. Mac
kenzie Sigafoos. It stands for Eat More SuJtgum!"
A broken man, E. Mackenzie today squeezes out a meagre
living as a pendulum in Cleveland. Jo-Carol was killed in a
long war.)
But I digress. We were talking about well-dressed men, and the
one essential for every well-dressed man—and every well-dressed
woman too—is a well-dressed cigarette—neat, compact, flavor
ful, and correct for work or play, sunshine or shower, repose or
revelry, darkness or light. And where does one find such a |»er
feet companion? Just go to any tobacco counter and ask for
I'hilip Morris. Ask for it in long size or regular. Ask for it in
soft pack or hard. But ask for it; that's the important thing.

they were snatched up, planted, limed, and watered, and today
they support a hummock in Cut and Shoot, Vermont.

I.of, us now discuss sliirfs. Again this year the campus favorite
is the good old Oxford with button-down collar and barrel
culTs. This is without doubt an admirable garment, but let me
ask you a question: if you don't wear anything but Oxfords,
what do you do with nil the cuff links people have been giving
you for your birthday since you were twelve years old?
Well sir, some fellows have their wrists pierced, but what E.
Mackenzie Sigafoos, a Chi Psi of my acquaintance, did was to
take a dozen pairs of his handsome gold monogrammed cuff
links and string them together in a charm bracelet for his girl,
Jo-Carol Isobar.
(ll turned out, incidentally, to be a mistake. In short order
so many admirers accrued to Jo-Carol on account of her gor
geous bracelet that she grew tired of plain old E. Mackenzie,
and fine night when she was seated on a bench in Lovers Lane
throwing sticks for E. Mackenzie to retrieve, she suddenly,
cruelly, without warning, told him they were through.
"I am heartbroken," said E. Mackenzie, heartbroken. "But
if go you must, give me back my charm bracelet."
"No, I will keep it," said Jo-Carol.
"What for?" said E. Mackenzie. "You can't wear it. The
initials on the cuff links arc all mine—E.M.S."
"ITa, ha, the joke is on you," said Jo-Carol. "Yesterday I was
voted Miss Chinese Restaurant of 1958."
"So?" said E. Mackenzie.
"So," replied Jo-Carol, "E.M.S. does not stand for E. Mac
kenzie Sigafoos. It stands for Eat More SuJtgum!"
A broken man, E. Mackenzie today squeezes out a meagre
living as a pendulum in Cleveland. Jo-Carol was killed in a
long war.)
But I digress. We were talking about well-dressed men, and the
one essential for every well-dressed man—and every well-dressed
woman too—is a well-dressed cigarette—neat, compact, flavor
ful, and correct for work or play, sunshine or shower, repose or
revelry, darkness or light. And where does one find such a |»er
feet companion? Just go to any tobacco counter and ask for
I'hilip Morris. Ask for it in long size or regular. Ask for it in
soft pack or hard. But ask for it; that's the important thing.

bring you this column throughout the school year.


THE CLOTHES YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN
In tliis column we take up fashions for college men, which means
of course, the Ivy Look. Today's Ivy Look clothes have made a
great stride forward. Not only do they have thin lapels, three but
tons, narrow trousers, and a minimum of shoulder padding, but
—now hear this!—this year they are actually covcred with ivy!
This new development, while attractive beyond the singing
of it, nevertheless gives rise to certain hazards. For instance,
people keep trying to plant you on Arbor Day. Indeed, this is
precisely what happened to two SAE's of my acquaintance,
Walter 11. Gurlash and Fred Rasp. Before they could protest,
they were snatched up, planted, limed, and watered, and today
they support a hummock in Cut and Shoot, Vermont.
