## U.S. Negotiates Defense Agreement With Iran 
### 
WASHINGTON (/l*) —The United States is negotiating a defense
agreement with Iran and will sign it—despite Soviet warnings—when
informal talks in Tehran are concluded.
State Department officials, in reporting this Monday, said they did
not see any reason for Moscow to be either surprised or alarmed.

The United States, they said,
had pledged at the London confer
once of Baghdad Pact nations last
July to co-operate in strengthen
ing "the united defense posture
in the area." This is well known
in the Kremlin.
Promises (!o-operation
In the London declaration, Sec
retary of State Dulles promised
on behalf of the United States "to
promptly enter into agreements
designed to give effect to this co
operation."
The London conference came in
the wake of a coup d'etat in Iraq,
host member. The coup liquidated
the pro-Western regime of King
Faisal and transformed Iraq into
a neutral republic.
No Formal Withdrawal
Though Iraq did not formally
withdraw from the pact, it did not
attend the London discussions ei
ther. Headquarters of the pact
were moved from Baghdad to An
kara.
Department officials stressed
that no military treaty is contem
plated. Such a treaty would re
quire Senate confirmation, they
said. President Eisenhower can
conclude agreements in the spirit
of the London declaration under
his constitutional authority.
What form an agreement with
Iran would take, officials here re
fused to predict. Whatever it will
be, it ecrtainly will have no ag
gressive designs and Moscow "is
baying after the wrong scent,"
officials remarked.
Soviet Warning
The Soviet Union warned Iran
Oct. 28 of the danger of what
Moscow described as a new mili
tary treaty with the United States.
The indiscriminate branding by
Moscow of U.S. actions in the
Middle Fast and Far East as "mil
itant" and "aggressive" is thought
by most informed people to be
merely propaganda slams.
