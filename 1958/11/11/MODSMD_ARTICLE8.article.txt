# False Alarms
## 
### 
Recently plagued by a rash of false alarms, the Stanford Uni
versity Fire Department issued a plea to fire engine watchers to
refrain from their dangerous and expensive pastime.
Sunday afternoon, the department answered a call at the Stan
ford Museum, and found that an aalrm box had, in fact, been
tripped, but nary a cinder nor wisp of smoke was to be found.
Yesterday at noon, three trucks and the chief's car rushed to
Encina Hall, only to find that someone had mistaken the dust
pouring out of upper-story windows for smoke. Assuming the old
adage, "Where there's smoke, there's fire," he (or she) raced to a
nearby fire alarm box and summoned the department.
"Not only are false alarms a waste of Stanford money, but they
are also a needless source of danger (o the personnel of the fire
department and students and faculty on campus. A fire engine
racing to an alarm has the right of way, but we don't want to have
to prove to anyone that we're dead right," stated Fire Chief John
Marston.
