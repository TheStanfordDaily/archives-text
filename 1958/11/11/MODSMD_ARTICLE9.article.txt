# German Student Praises Truth, Justice, Liberty
## 
### 
As part of this year's affiliation with the Free University of Berlin,
Hannelore Roddies is studying at Stanford.
Miss Reddies majors in economics and sociology and is an ardent
member of the Stanford Berlin Affiliation Committee, and she is
presently organizing a German language table for Florence Moore

Hall.
She says the students of the
Free University of Berlin owe
much of what they have to the
United States and to the Stanford
students who since their affilia
tion in 1952 have been a constant
inspiration. Without the help of
the Ford Foundation and others,
Miss Reddies believes her fellow
students would have had a very
difficult time escaping the Com
munist pressure at the old Hum
boldt University in East Berlin.
Today the Free University is
celebrating the 10th anniversary
of its founding by students and
teachers revolting against Com
munist doctrine, and as Miss Red
dies says, "is cherishing even
more so the theme in its seal: Ve
ritas, lustitia, Libertas (Truth,
Justice, Liberty).
"Free academic life and undoc
trinary teaching and research as
I find at Stanford was the inspira
tion to us and I think is even
more beautifully worded in your
motto: Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht (The Wind of Freedom
Blows). Our mottos have so much
in common I really feel at home
here at Stanford."
