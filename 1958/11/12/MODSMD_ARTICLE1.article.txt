# Axe Returned to Cellar Stronghold
## New Alarm Makes Case 'Theft proof' 
### 
The Axe, symbol of 60 years of
Stanford tradition, is in (he Cel
lar. Stanford students will now
have a chance to see it at close
hand for the first time since the
1955 Big Game.
In 1955 Cal won the Big Game
but the Axe was back at Stanford
the next year after an Indian win.
Since then it has been resting in
the triple • locked vault of the
American Trust Company in Talo
Alto.
Tuesday noon a three-car cara
van one police car, one red and
one black convertible — escorted
the Axe to the campus. One of
the bank officials, a Cal gradu
ate, presented the Axe to the cara
van wrapped in blue and gold
paper with a tag labeled: "Deliver
to Berkeley Nov. 22."
Installation
A small welcoming crowd met
the group as they pulled up in
front of the Cellar. The Axe was
installed without ceremony by
two Corporation Yard men, two
policemen and several student of
ficers.
The case it is in now has been
only slightly changed from the
one which tho Axe ocupied in '56
- there is a sensitive alarm
which, when the case is cracked
or, it is rumored, even shaken,
will bring the Stanford police to
the scene within five minutes.
Said yell leader Dick Stanford
after the job was completed: "The
big thrill was not in installing the
Axe, but will come when we re
tain it after Nov. 22."
Long Tradition
The Axe, symbol of Cal-Stan
ford rivalry, was bought in 1899
to boost morale after a long
string of Stanford defeats. It was
soon after stolen by Cal, not re
covered until 1930 when the Im
mortal 21 executed what has been
called "the neatest robbery prior
to the Brink affair."
Soon after, this oldest active
trophy in major intercollegiate
rivalries was established as a
prize to be given to the winner
of the Big Game.

hand for the first time since the
1955 Big Game.
In 1955 Cal won the Big Game
but the Axe was back at Stanford
the next year after an Indian win.
Since then it has been resting in
the triple • locked vault of the
American Trust Company in Talo
Alto.
Tuesday noon a three-car cara
van one police car, one red and
one black convertible — escorted
the Axe to the campus. One of
the bank officials, a Cal gradu
ate, presented the Axe to the cara
van wrapped in blue and gold
paper with a tag labeled: "Deliver
to Berkeley Nov. 22."
Installation
A small welcoming crowd met
the group as they pulled up in
front of the Cellar. The Axe was
installed without ceremony by
two Corporation Yard men, two
policemen and several student of
ficers.
The case it is in now has been
only slightly changed from the
one which tho Axe ocupied in '56
- there is a sensitive alarm
which, when the case is cracked
or, it is rumored, even shaken,
will bring the Stanford police to
the scene within five minutes.
Said yell leader Dick Stanford
after the job was completed: "The
big thrill was not in installing the
Axe, but will come when we re
tain it after Nov. 22."
Long Tradition
The Axe, symbol of Cal-Stan
ford rivalry, was bought in 1899
to boost morale after a long
string of Stanford defeats. It was
soon after stolen by Cal, not re
covered until 1930 when the Im
mortal 21 executed what has been
called "the neatest robbery prior
to the Brink affair."
Soon after, this oldest active
trophy in major intercollegiate
rivalries was established as a
prize to be given to the winner
of the Big Game.
