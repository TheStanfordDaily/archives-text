Noting "great political apathy
here," foreign scholar Hick Thom
as says, "People hero regard poli
tics as dirty business, and there
fore something they don't have to
pay any attention to. I am a groat
believer in democracy, and don't
believe it can survive when peo
ple say, 'Oh, the hell with it.' "
Thomas says that there is much
more interest in politics at Ox
ford. of which he is a graduate,
and in England generally, per
haps because there is "much more
ideological division, which you
don't have in this country."
At Oxford, Thomas was presi
dent of the debate and drama so
cieties, secretary of the Oxford
Economic Society and treasurer
of the Oxford Labor Club. He is
spending three quarters at Stan
ford doing directed reading in in
ternational relations and broad
casting and television, with a view
to work on BBC documentaries.
While at Stanford he is visiting
schools, touring television ssta-

tions and attending political meet
ings here and at. other universi
ties.
