# Privilege

### 
It I l * fasy to take things for granted. Thin is done all too often,
and a specific case in point is the rooters" section at t lie 100 tball
games.
In universities and colleges in most oilier parts of the nation
the students sit in ihe end zone area of the stadium, and the better,
f>o-yard-line seats are reserved for those who are willing to pay
about $3,50 for them. Other schools find this necessary in order
to make money to support not only athletics hut also other areas
of the school.
At Stanford the feeling is that football games are for the stu
dents primarily —the participants are students; football was chiefly
organized bv the students—hence the decision to place the rooting
section in the area of some of the most desirable seals in the
Stadium.
Thus the students got to view all football games for
a nominal cost. This ycar all home games except Rice
ami USC were free: USC tickets cost 51.75 and Rice $1.
The total cost, averaged per home game, is only 55 cents
a game —this for regularly $3.50 seats.
This is a distinct privilege, not accorded to students by many
other schools, and we feel that Stanford students should realize it
as such.
Then ice must ash: does this privilege carry with it
any obligations?
We think it does, in that a courteous citizen does not walk out
on a favor, such as a free lecture he has decided to attend, no
matter how poor he thinks the lecture is. He may sit and gripe
(to himself, Ave hope), but he ordinarily is not rude enough to
leave. And, although a football audience is much more informal,
we feel there is an analogy here.
The football seats are a privilege given to the stu
dents. Once this privilege is accepted, a student should
have enough common courtesy not to walk out.
We don't like ihe idea of preaching on manners and courtesy
—it should be that Stanford students have these things ingrained
in them.
There is a certain reaction against conformity on the campus
which some will extend to courtesy, but nonconformity does not
begin here. Conformity or nonconformity begins in this case with
the initial decision on whether to attend a football game. One
should not feel he has to go along with ihe crowd and go to the
game. It becomes his individual decision whether to wear the
Red and White and join the rooters in the stands; once he does
don the Red and White and accept the privilege of sitting in $3.50
seats, at little or no cost to himself, he should conform lo the
extent of observing the courtesies of a well-bred man or woman.

a game —this for regularly $3.50 seats.
This is a distinct privilege, not accorded to students by many
other schools, and we feel that Stanford students should realize it
as such.
Then ice must ash: does this privilege carry with it
any obligations?
We think it does, in that a courteous citizen does not walk out
on a favor, such as a free lecture he has decided to attend, no
matter how poor he thinks the lecture is. He may sit and gripe
(to himself, Ave hope), but he ordinarily is not rude enough to
leave. And, although a football audience is much more informal,
we feel there is an analogy here.
The football seats are a privilege given to the stu
dents. Once this privilege is accepted, a student should
have enough common courtesy not to walk out.
We don't like ihe idea of preaching on manners and courtesy
—it should be that Stanford students have these things ingrained
in them.
There is a certain reaction against conformity on the campus
which some will extend to courtesy, but nonconformity does not
begin here. Conformity or nonconformity begins in this case with
the initial decision on whether to attend a football game. One
should not feel he has to go along with ihe crowd and go to the
game. It becomes his individual decision whether to wear the
Red and White and join the rooters in the stands; once he does
don the Red and White and accept the privilege of sitting in $3.50
seats, at little or no cost to himself, he should conform lo the
extent of observing the courtesies of a well-bred man or woman.

It I l * fasy to take things for granted. Thin is done all too often,
and a specific case in point is the rooters" section at t lie 100 tball
games.
In universities and colleges in most oilier parts of the nation
the students sit in ihe end zone area of the stadium, and the better,
f>o-yard-line seats are reserved for those who are willing to pay
about $3,50 for them. Other schools find this necessary in order
to make money to support not only athletics hut also other areas
of the school.
At Stanford the feeling is that football games are for the stu
dents primarily —the participants are students; football was chiefly
organized bv the students—hence the decision to place the rooting
section in the area of some of the most desirable seals in the
Stadium.
Thus the students got to view all football games for
a nominal cost. This ycar all home games except Rice
ami USC were free: USC tickets cost 51.75 and Rice $1.
The total cost, averaged per home game, is only 55 cents
a game —this for regularly $3.50 seats.
