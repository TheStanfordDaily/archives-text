# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Forgotten Issue' —The Recession 
### Leo Krulitz 
The Democratic sweep across
the nation last week can be de
scribed as the "story of the for
gotten issue."
Californians are probably un
aware of just how extensive this
sweep was because of the interest
the state election created—some
have described it as the dirtiest
campaign in California's history.
In state after state the people
elected candidates for no other
obvious reason except that they
were Democrats' and the issue
that bad put people in this
frame of mind and that we
heard very little about was the
recession.
Republicans probably had most
Democrats convinced that the re
cession was over.
' Democratic candidates very sel
dom mentioned it in their
speeches. Harry Truman talked
about Ike's surrender in Korea,
and Adlai Stevenson talked about
administration policy in the Far
East. Writers predicted the Dem
ocratic sweep—but didn't exactly
know why, except that the polls
indicated it.
If the recession was over, the
people weren't ready to forget
about it. There were nearly five
million unemployed during the
last weeks before the election
and for those that had gone
back to work, the hole that un
employment had made in their
savings was still staring them
in the face in their reduced
bank book balances.
With a recession, people blame
the Republicans and vote for the
Democrats; and as a result, we
have North Dakota electing its
first Democrat to Congress since
it became a state, and Vermont
electing its first Democrat in over
100 years.
And it was the party they were
voting for—not just the man. In
Idaho the people re-elected their
Republican Governor but prompt
ly changed columns to elect Dern

ocrats to every other state office,
turning out Republican incum
bents grand right and left.
Because of the small scale of
the campaigning, most Idahoans
don't know who is running for the
minor state offices until they get
in the polling booth, then they
vote for the party.
The Republican Governor won
on the basis of his opposition to
the legalized gambling that his
opponent advocated.
In Connecticut, the Republicans
held all six Congressional seats
going into the election. After Ihe
election they were all held by
Democrats.
The only national issue im
portant enough to create this
tremendous sweep was the re
cession . . . ami the Democrats
apparently forgot about it.
This Democratic victory was
also a victory for organized labor,
because Republicans in many
states made labor corruption
their central issue and proceeded
to link labor and the Democrats—
an easy step.
The problem then arises as to
what legislation the people can
expect, out of the Democratic
Congress next year to deal with
the corruption exposed by the
McClellan Commit tee.
Republicans are probably sorry
that they didn't take the Kennedy-
Ives Bill - while they had the
chance, because now if a labor
bill is passed at all, it probably
won't be as strong as the bill that
Congress rejected this year be
cause "it was too weak."
Indeed, Labor has- been dust
ing off many old objectives
that they have bad to shelve
during this Republican admin
istration so far, and they will
now probably press for revision
of the Taft-Hartley Act, anoth
er increase in the minimum
wage, ami yes, even a bill to
repeal the law that, allows
states to have "right-to work"
laws.
