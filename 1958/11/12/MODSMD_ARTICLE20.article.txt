# REPORT FROM THE BURG
## Friendships Key Burg Life 
### Steve Freidberg 
War lias been avoided on the
Burg. Peace and quiet reign again
as the Biotehen and Eier eaters
have finally come to a compro
mise.
Several reports ago it was men
tioned that those students want
ing Eier (eggs) for breakfast and
those wishing only Biotehen for
breakfast in order to have tea and
cake in the afternoon were at
odds.
For a week there were cam
paigns to win supporters for each
side; and arguments raged well
into the night. Finally, the Burg's
indispensable and ingenious cook,
Karl, came up with a solution
vvorihy of Solomon. Monday,
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday
Eier would be served; and Tues
day, Thursday and Saturday the
Biotehen eaters would rule the
Burg.
"Neo" Movement
This system has proved agree
able to all but a few diehards who
are still hoping for a neo-Brotchen
or neo-Eier movement to arise.
This humorous incident is a
good indication of how life at
Stanford-in-Germany differs from
life on the Farm. To be living in
California with 8000 other stu
dents is far from living with 63
other students on top of a hill in a
foreign country for six months.
In name only is this school like
anything we have experienced in
Palo Alto.
For one thing, being so close
together, we have come to know
more people and to know them
better than is possible in a large
dormitory. We all live together,
eat together and work together,
and with such a relationship mak
ing good friends is easy.
Elbow in Ribs
If the same person's elbow is
poking you in the ribs when
you're trying to shave, to eat
your Eier or Brotchen and to take
notes at lectures, you get to know
him fairly well. Having experi
ences such as these with otjier
people helps create close friend
ships.
Sharing travels and bull ses
sions also makes friendships
which don't happen on a trip to
Kirk's for a hamburger. In addi
tion, there is a certain pride in
being the first group and in striv
ing for success which binds us
closer together.

An example of this group feel
ing was our Vollmondfest (Full
Moon) that came the weekend be
fore finals last quarter. We de
cided to have the test in order to
invite our German friends who
had entertained us. The main at
tractions were seven kegs of beer,
numerous cases of apple cider and
enough wurst (overgrown hot
dogs) to supply the town Beutels
baeh. There was a student talent
show, a dance contest and merry
making late into the morning.
Eiltle Confusion
The amazing thing about the
fest was that G4 students man
aged to organize and plan the fes
tivities and to make all the ar
rangements with little confusion.
It was entirely a group project
with some people getting the
beer, some putting up decora
tions, others chopping wood and
doing everything else necessary.
And when we were finished, we
were all proud that the fest had
been a success, for the guests ac
claimed it as one of the best cele
brations they had attended. Hence
another fest is planned for the
end of this quarter just before
our six months are finished.
Of course, our friendships have
not been limited to Americans.
On the contrary, as was reported
earlier, our main efforts are to
meet Germans and to spend as
much time with them as possible.
Improvement
As was expected in the time we
have been here, there has been
great improvement in our Ger
man speaking and understanding
ability. Many people are quite
fluent while others have a ways
to go, but everybody is doing
much better than when he came.
The student cabinet, in order to
promote German speaking, has
started a weekly selection of the
person who has made the best
effort at speaking only German.
Signs have been posted reading
"Wie viel Deutsch hast du heute
gesprochen?" (How much Ger
man have you spoken today?") or
"Sage es nicht mit Blumen son
dern mit Deutsch" (Don't say it

with flowers but with German).
Another innovation on der Burg
is a Tanzstude or dance class.
More than half the group showed
interest in learning some Euro
pean folk dances and waltzes, so
we asked a teacher from Waib
lingen to instruct us. Al the first
lesson we were introduced to the
German version of the fox trot
and had it well mastered by the
end of the evening. This week we
take up the Viennese waltz and
progress from there. There has
even been the promise of some
rock-and-roll, European style, if
we have time during the quarter.
Joins Students
In case anyone has wondered
about the 64 students here now
when only 63 came over on the
plane, Christa von Plettenberg, a
charming German girl from
Frankfurt, is now living with us
and studying political science.
She is attending on a scholarship
donated to Stanford-in-Germany
and has been with us since June.
She lives in Grosses Haus, goes
on our trips and attends all our
classes, German being her favor
ite. In addition to becoming one
of us and aiding us with our Ger
man, she has helped to even up
the ratio which now stands at 33
to 31â€”somewhat better than on
the Farm.
