# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Relations Are Not Better 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
— II —
After the preliminary courte
sies, Mr. K. waved a hand at me
and said he was ready to answer
my questions.
I began by saying that relations
between our two countries had de
teriorated since the summit meet
ing at Geneva in 1955, and would
the chairman comment on this.
Relations, he said, have not be
come worse. They were bad in
1955. They are bad now, and they
have not become any better. The
question, he added, is whether our

relations are to bo fro?en where
they are now or are to become
better or worse.
I reminded him that at the
t i m e of the Geneva meeting 1
there had been hopes ot' much
better relations.
Yes, he said, but in the West
these hopes were based on a false
premise. Dulles and Churchill
or, as he put it, "that old wolf
Churchill" —had hoped that after
Stalin's deaih there would be a
change in the internal policy of
the U.S.S.R., and that the coun
try would turn away from the
strengthening of its "socialist
achievements."
When, said Mr. K., Dulles and
Churchill saw that the successors
of Stalin were not going to liqui
date the Communist system, but
that these successors did want to
relax the tension on the basis ol
the status quo, the West reverted
to the tactics of the cold war.
They had hoped to win us over,
he said, but we shall never be di
verted from the path of socialism.
Never!
At I lie next interval I seized
the chance to ask .Vlr. K. to t**ll
me what he understood by "the
status quo." The answer io this
crucial question, it soon ap
peared, is, in Itis mind, a com
plex one, and the bulk of the
interview which followed was a
gradual unfolding of what the
phrase means in his mind.
It will, 1 think, help the reader
if at this point I interrupt the nar
rative and summarize what, as 1
reflected on the whole interview
afterwards, seemed to me to be
the main elements in his concep
tion of the status quo.
The simpler part of his concep
tion is that there should be no
change of frontiers by military
force.
lie illustrated this by saying
that in the cases of China and of
Vietnam the issues between the
two parts of these countries were
internal and "civilian"--and were
therefore not to be treated as in
ternational questions. In the cases
of the two Germanys and the two
Koreas, changes of frontier —pre-
sumably by the union of the two
parts—were to take place only by
"mutual consent."
I shall come back to the Ger
man question later on. But; first
I must set down what is the more
important part of his conception
of the status quo. In his mind,
the social and economic revolution
now in progress in Russia, China
and elsewhere in Asia and Africa
is the status quo, and he wants
us to recognize it as such.

In his mind, opposition to this
revolution is an attempt to change
the status quo. Whereas we think
of the status quo as the situation
as it exists at the moment, he
thinks of it as the process of revo
lutionary change which is in prog
ress. He wanst us to recognize
the revolution not only as it is but
as it is going to be.
There is another very impor
tant component in his concep
tion of the status quo. This has
to do with the balance of mili
tary power.
Judging by what he said, and
by what was implied in what he
said, 1 would describe his view of
the existing military balance of
power as follows.
It rests, I feel reasonably cer
tain, on his confidence that the
Soviet Union has mastered the in
termediate and short-range mis
siles to a point where it can domi
nate with them Germany, western
Europe, Turkey and Iran.
I do not kno w, of course,
whether his confidence in these
missiles is justified. Kul there
is no doubt that lie assumes
their existence in his thinking,
and thai they have now become,
as the saying goes, a principal
instrument of Soviet foreign
policy.
On the other hand nothing he
said implied that he thinks the
U.S.S.R. has long-range missiles
which have broken, or are about
to break, the existing military
stalemate with the United States.
His conception ot his military
position in relation to the United
Slates is that neither country can
defeat the other in a direct con
flict, but tliut the American for
ward positions, particularly in
Germany and Turkey, can, be
cause of I.he development of the
rocket, no longer be defended.
He feels, therefore, that Ameri
can policy rests on an obsolete
estimate of the existing balance
of power.
