### Bob Payne 
Well .. . An All-American Team
A letter from the University of Notre Dame Scholastic reached
ihe spoils desk this week, asking us to make our nominations for
"The College Sports Editors All-American Football Team."
Ah, yes, that lime is here again. So we sat down to nominate.
It wasn't easy.
Where are Ihe Ail-Americans this year? A look at last season's
All-Coast football team might provide a clue as to the comparative
scarcity of "All" selections in this part of the country. To be sure,
six of the eleven All-Coasters last season were juniors. But of the
six only Stanford tackle Troy Barbee appears to be a good bel to
repeat this season. And the unspectacular showing of the Card team
hasn't helped his chances.

The other five? Dick VVallen
and Bill Leeka of UCLA were re
stricted to only half a season this
year. They may still be in the
running for All-Coast but any na
tional hopes they might have en
tertained are dead. The Washing
ton Slate pitch-and-catch combi
nation of Bob Newman and Don
Ellingsen has been bothered by
injuries all year and thus lost
their imposing statistical selling
points. Oregon State's center,
Buy./, Randall, passed away from
leukemia this fall, hut should he
a definite "honorary" choice.
Then there were Ron Stover,
the Oregon end who was so bril
larit in the Kos'e Bowl . . . and
Bill Steiger, the WSC wingman
who was All-American two years
ago. Same story here: injuries.
So, we've had to find some new
heroes on the West Coast scene.
Stanford has sure found one: end
c hris Burford. II there is an AII-
American prospect in this confer

oncp this season, it is Burford. A near-60-minute man every week,
he has been brilliant on defense and his league-leading 34 pass recep
tions attest to his offensive prowess. One nomination: Chris Bur ford.
California is duly wild over its quarterback, Joe Kapp. Kapp has
been a for two years but this season has really blossomed
. . . and the Bears have blossomed with him. Berkeley's master of
the split T option may have the inside track of the nation's signal
callers.
A Small List, So Far
Kapp and Burfonl. They look like the big choices in the Pacific
Coast Conference. Oregon Stale still has its great tackle, Ted Kates,
bul the Beavers' sometimes lack-luster performances this season
make it tough on linemen seeking honors. Southern California is
booming its sophomore end, Martin McKeever. But at best, McKeever
is a year away yet ... he was .just one of many, many good Trojans
when they played Stanford.
College of Pacific has Dick Bass, and herp is another real All-
American. Add this to the PCC's few and you have Burfonl, Kapp,
Bales' and Bass . . . our nominations.
And there was another Westerner on the list: Bill Long. Heard
of him? lie's the star lineman of a Willamette University (Salem,
Oregon) team which has rolled through seven straight games with
out defeat and is currently tabbed by Sports Illustrated as the No. 2
small college power in the nation. lie deserved a vote, and I doubt
if he will get many from the East.
From Stanford's intersectional opponents came two dandy nomi
nations: tackle Brock Strom of Air Force and center Jim Andreotti
of Northwestern. Both played bang-up games against the Tribe and
both have reportedly been standouts at every other instance this
season.
Burford, Bates, Strom, Long, Andreotti, Kapp and Bass. For
proximity and actual observation, these had to be our nominations.
The other four positions were filled rather incidentally by men we
had never seen ... or probably never come close to seeing . . . only
read about. But that's how All-Americans are selected.
Notably missing were such fellows as Pete Dawkins and Bob
Anderson of Army, Nick Pietrosante of Notre Dame, Bob Reifstiyder
of Navy, Sam Williams of Michigan State, Bed) White of Ohio State j
and all Oklahomans. These were the pre-season choices . . . and
they haven't been disappointments this year . . . but they aren't'
going to need our vote either.
The four remaining choices happened to be Rich Krehling of
Illinois (an end that UCLA coaches were comparing to Buford . . .
I.e must be good); John Guzik of Pittsburgh (a guard who tore apart I
Notre Dame last week); Bill Austin of Rutgers (a tailback who is
second only to Bass in statistics and sparks one of the few unbeatens
in the country; Billy Cannon of Ixtuisiana State (a 200-pound half
back who runs 100 yards in 9.5 seconds and also plays for the na
tion's No. 1 team).
W hat Happened to the Passers?
Of all the positions on an Ail-American team, quarterback is the
biggest. Each year the battle for the signal-calling role attracts the
greatest national attention. This season, Ihe preseason picks are
nowhere to be seen.
It may be a bad year for passers when it comes to A-A. Kapp
heads a list of a number of fine qb's who run as much as they pass
and are the "field general" type that typifies the splil-T. Following 1
him are Randy Duncan of Iowa, Dick Thornton of Northwestern,
Dale Hackhart of Wisconsin.
The aerial-minded quarterbacks that occupied the center of the
stage at the start of the season are now out of sight. (Notably, how
ever, Newman and Utah's Lee Grosscup can blame injuries more
than anything else.) At any rate, with Newman healthy the PCX:
may very well be blessed with the two best qb's in the land.
That's nothing unusual: Don Heinrich of Washington, Bobby;
Garret! and John Brodie of Stanford and Paul Larson of Cal pretty
well made their marks on the national scene in their respective hey !
days, which weren't too long ago.
AimI glad tidings for Jack Curtice: A passing coach what better
fate could there be than lo have Lee Grosscup and Bob Newman
directing his Wesl team in next month's Last-West Shrine Classic?

ago. Same story here: injuries.
So, we've had to find some new
heroes on the West Coast scene.
Stanford has sure found one: end
c hris Burford. II there is an AII-
American prospect in this confer

oncp this season, it is Burford. A near-60-minute man every week,
he has been brilliant on defense and his league-leading 34 pass recep
tions attest to his offensive prowess. One nomination: Chris Bur ford.
California is duly wild over its quarterback, Joe Kapp. Kapp has
been a for two years but this season has really blossomed
. . . and the Bears have blossomed with him. Berkeley's master of
the split T option may have the inside track of the nation's signal
callers.
A Small List, So Far
Kapp and Burfonl. They look like the big choices in the Pacific
Coast Conference. Oregon Stale still has its great tackle, Ted Kates,
bul the Beavers' sometimes lack-luster performances this season
make it tough on linemen seeking honors. Southern California is
booming its sophomore end, Martin McKeever. But at best, McKeever
is a year away yet ... he was .just one of many, many good Trojans
when they played Stanford.
College of Pacific has Dick Bass, and herp is another real All-
American. Add this to the PCC's few and you have Burfonl, Kapp,
Bales' and Bass . . . our nominations.
And there was another Westerner on the list: Bill Long. Heard
of him? lie's the star lineman of a Willamette University (Salem,
Oregon) team which has rolled through seven straight games with
out defeat and is currently tabbed by Sports Illustrated as the No. 2
small college power in the nation. lie deserved a vote, and I doubt
if he will get many from the East.
From Stanford's intersectional opponents came two dandy nomi
nations: tackle Brock Strom of Air Force and center Jim Andreotti
of Northwestern. Both played bang-up games against the Tribe and
both have reportedly been standouts at every other instance this
season.
Burford, Bates, Strom, Long, Andreotti, Kapp and Bass. For
proximity and actual observation, these had to be our nominations.
The other four positions were filled rather incidentally by men we
had never seen ... or probably never come close to seeing . . . only
read about. But that's how All-Americans are selected.
Notably missing were such fellows as Pete Dawkins and Bob
Anderson of Army, Nick Pietrosante of Notre Dame, Bob Reifstiyder
of Navy, Sam Williams of Michigan State, Bed) White of Ohio State j
and all Oklahomans. These were the pre-season choices . . . and
they haven't been disappointments this year . . . but they aren't'
going to need our vote either.
The four remaining choices happened to be Rich Krehling of
Illinois (an end that UCLA coaches were comparing to Buford . . .
I.e must be good); John Guzik of Pittsburgh (a guard who tore apart I
Notre Dame last week); Bill Austin of Rutgers (a tailback who is
second only to Bass in statistics and sparks one of the few unbeatens
in the country; Billy Cannon of Ixtuisiana State (a 200-pound half
back who runs 100 yards in 9.5 seconds and also plays for the na
tion's No. 1 team).
W hat Happened to the Passers?
Of all the positions on an Ail-American team, quarterback is the
biggest. Each year the battle for the signal-calling role attracts the
greatest national attention. This season, Ihe preseason picks are
nowhere to be seen.
It may be a bad year for passers when it comes to A-A. Kapp
heads a list of a number of fine qb's who run as much as they pass
and are the "field general" type that typifies the splil-T. Following 1
him are Randy Duncan of Iowa, Dick Thornton of Northwestern,
Dale Hackhart of Wisconsin.
The aerial-minded quarterbacks that occupied the center of the
stage at the start of the season are now out of sight. (Notably, how
ever, Newman and Utah's Lee Grosscup can blame injuries more
than anything else.) At any rate, with Newman healthy the PCX:
may very well be blessed with the two best qb's in the land.
That's nothing unusual: Don Heinrich of Washington, Bobby;
Garret! and John Brodie of Stanford and Paul Larson of Cal pretty
well made their marks on the national scene in their respective hey !
days, which weren't too long ago.
AimI glad tidings for Jack Curtice: A passing coach what better
fate could there be than lo have Lee Grosscup and Bob Newman
directing his Wesl team in next month's Last-West Shrine Classic?



CHRIS BURFORD
All-American?
Well .. . An All-American Team
A letter from the University of Notre Dame Scholastic reached
ihe spoils desk this week, asking us to make our nominations for
"The College Sports Editors All-American Football Team."
Ah, yes, that lime is here again. So we sat down to nominate.
It wasn't easy.
Where are Ihe Ail-Americans this year? A look at last season's
All-Coast football team might provide a clue as to the comparative
scarcity of "All" selections in this part of the country. To be sure,
six of the eleven All-Coasters last season were juniors. But of the
six only Stanford tackle Troy Barbee appears to be a good bel to
repeat this season. And the unspectacular showing of the Card team
hasn't helped his chances.

The other five? Dick VVallen
and Bill Leeka of UCLA were re
stricted to only half a season this
year. They may still be in the
running for All-Coast but any na
tional hopes they might have en
tertained are dead. The Washing
ton Slate pitch-and-catch combi
nation of Bob Newman and Don
Ellingsen has been bothered by
injuries all year and thus lost
their imposing statistical selling
points. Oregon State's center,
Buy./, Randall, passed away from
leukemia this fall, hut should he
a definite "honorary" choice.
Then there were Ron Stover,
the Oregon end who was so bril

Oregon) team which has rolled through seven straight games with
out defeat and is currently tabbed by Sports Illustrated as the No. 2
small college power in the nation. lie deserved a vote, and I doubt
if he will get many from the East.
From Stanford's intersectional opponents came two dandy nomi
nations: tackle Brock Strom of Air Force and center Jim Andreotti
of Northwestern. Both played bang-up games against the Tribe and
both have reportedly been standouts at every other instance this
season.
Burford, Bates, Strom, Long, Andreotti, Kapp and Bass. For
proximity and actual observation, these had to be our nominations.
The other four positions were filled rather incidentally by men we
had never seen ... or probably never come close to seeing . . . only
read about. But that's how All-Americans are selected.
Notably missing were such fellows as Pete Dawkins and Bob
Anderson of Army, Nick Pietrosante of Notre Dame, Bob Reifstiyder
of Navy, Sam Williams of Michigan State, Bed) White of Ohio State j
and all Oklahomans. These were the pre-season choices . . . and
they haven't been disappointments this year . . . but they aren't'
going to need our vote either.
The four remaining choices happened to be Rich Krehling of
Illinois (an end that UCLA coaches were comparing to Buford . . .
I.e must be good); John Guzik of Pittsburgh (a guard who tore apart I
Notre Dame last week); Bill Austin of Rutgers (a tailback who is
second only to Bass in statistics and sparks one of the few unbeatens
in the country; Billy Cannon of Ixtuisiana State (a 200-pound half
back who runs 100 yards in 9.5 seconds and also plays for the na
tion's No. 1 team).
W hat Happened to the Passers?
Of all the positions on an Ail-American team, quarterback is the
biggest. Each year the battle for the signal-calling role attracts the
greatest national attention. This season, Ihe preseason picks are
nowhere to be seen.
It may be a bad year for passers when it comes to A-A. Kapp
heads a list of a number of fine qb's who run as much as they pass
and are the "field general" type that typifies the splil-T. Following 1
him are Randy Duncan of Iowa, Dick Thornton of Northwestern,
Dale Hackhart of Wisconsin.
The aerial-minded quarterbacks that occupied the center of the
stage at the start of the season are now out of sight. (Notably, how
ever, Newman and Utah's Lee Grosscup can blame injuries more
than anything else.) At any rate, with Newman healthy the PCX:
may very well be blessed with the two best qb's in the land.
That's nothing unusual: Don Heinrich of Washington, Bobby;
Garret! and John Brodie of Stanford and Paul Larson of Cal pretty
well made their marks on the national scene in their respective hey !
days, which weren't too long ago.
AimI glad tidings for Jack Curtice: A passing coach what better
fate could there be than lo have Lee Grosscup and Bob Newman
directing his Wesl team in next month's Last-West Shrine Classic?



CHRIS BURFORD
All-American?
Well .. . An All-American Team
A letter from the University of Notre Dame Scholastic reached
ihe spoils desk this week, asking us to make our nominations for
"The College Sports Editors All-American Football Team."
Ah, yes, that lime is here again. So we sat down to nominate.
It wasn't easy.
Where are Ihe Ail-Americans this year? A look at last season's
All-Coast football team might provide a clue as to the comparative
scarcity of "All" selections in this part of the country. To be sure,
six of the eleven All-Coasters last season were juniors. But of the
six only Stanford tackle Troy Barbee appears to be a good bel to
repeat this season. And the unspectacular showing of the Card team
hasn't helped his chances.

The other five? Dick VVallen
and Bill Leeka of UCLA were re
stricted to only half a season this
year. They may still be in the
running for All-Coast but any na
tional hopes they might have en
tertained are dead. The Washing
ton Slate pitch-and-catch combi
nation of Bob Newman and Don
Ellingsen has been bothered by
injuries all year and thus lost
their imposing statistical selling
points. Oregon State's center,
Buy./, Randall, passed away from
leukemia this fall, hut should he
a definite "honorary" choice.
Then there were Ron Stover,
the Oregon end who was so bril
larit in the Kos'e Bowl . . . and
Bill Steiger, the WSC wingman
who was All-American two years
ago. Same story here: injuries.
So, we've had to find some new
heroes on the West Coast scene.
Stanford has sure found one: end
c hris Burford. II there is an AII-
American prospect in this confer

oncp this season, it is Burford. A near-60-minute man every week,
he has been brilliant on defense and his league-leading 34 pass recep
tions attest to his offensive prowess. One nomination: Chris Bur ford.
California is duly wild over its quarterback, Joe Kapp. Kapp has
been a for two years but this season has really blossomed
. . . and the Bears have blossomed with him. Berkeley's master of
the split T option may have the inside track of the nation's signal
callers.
A Small List, So Far
Kapp and Burfonl. They look like the big choices in the Pacific
Coast Conference. Oregon Stale still has its great tackle, Ted Kates,
bul the Beavers' sometimes lack-luster performances this season
make it tough on linemen seeking honors. Southern California is
booming its sophomore end, Martin McKeever. But at best, McKeever
is a year away yet ... he was .just one of many, many good Trojans
when they played Stanford.
College of Pacific has Dick Bass, and herp is another real All-
American. Add this to the PCC's few and you have Burfonl, Kapp,
Bales' and Bass . . . our nominations.
And there was another Westerner on the list: Bill Long. Heard

second only to Bass in statistics and sparks one of the few unbeatens
in the country; Billy Cannon of Ixtuisiana State (a 200-pound half
back who runs 100 yards in 9.5 seconds and also plays for the na

W hat Happened to the Passers?
Of all the positions on an Ail-American team, quarterback is the
biggest. Each year the battle for the signal-calling role attracts the
greatest national attention. This season, Ihe preseason picks are
nowhere to be seen.
It may be a bad year for passers when it comes to A-A. Kapp
heads a list of a number of fine qb's who run as much as they pass
and are the "field general" type that typifies the splil-T. Following 1
him are Randy Duncan of Iowa, Dick Thornton of Northwestern,
Dale Hackhart of Wisconsin.
The aerial-minded quarterbacks that occupied the center of the
stage at the start of the season are now out of sight. (Notably, how
ever, Newman and Utah's Lee Grosscup can blame injuries more
than anything else.) At any rate, with Newman healthy the PCX:
may very well be blessed with the two best qb's in the land.
That's nothing unusual: Don Heinrich of Washington, Bobby;
Garret! and John Brodie of Stanford and Paul Larson of Cal pretty
well made their marks on the national scene in their respective hey !
days, which weren't too long ago.
AimI glad tidings for Jack Curtice: A passing coach what better

CHRIS BURFORD
All-American?
Well .. . An All-American Team
A letter from the University of Notre Dame Scholastic reached
ihe spoils desk this week, asking us to make our nominations for
"The College Sports Editors All-American Football Team."
Ah, yes, that lime is here again. So we sat down to nominate.
It wasn't easy.
Where are Ihe Ail-Americans this year? A look at last season's
All-Coast football team might provide a clue as to the comparative
scarcity of "All" selections in this part of the country. To be sure,
six of the eleven All-Coasters last season were juniors. But of the
six only Stanford tackle Troy Barbee appears to be a good bel to
repeat this season. And the unspectacular showing of the Card team
hasn't helped his chances.

The other five? Dick VVallen
and Bill Leeka of UCLA were re
stricted to only half a season this
year. They may still be in the
running for All-Coast but any na
tional hopes they might have en
tertained are dead. The Washing
ton Slate pitch-and-catch combi
nation of Bob Newman and Don
Ellingsen has been bothered by
injuries all year and thus lost
their imposing statistical selling
points. Oregon State's center,
Buy./, Randall, passed away from
leukemia this fall, hut should he
a definite "honorary" choice.
Then there were Ron Stover,
the Oregon end who was so bril
larit in the Kos'e Bowl . . . and
Bill Steiger, the WSC wingman
who was All-American two years
ago. Same story here: injuries.
So, we've had to find some new
heroes on the West Coast scene.
Stanford has sure found one: end
c hris Burford. II there is an AII-
American prospect in this confer

oncp this season, it is Burford. A near-60-minute man every week,
he has been brilliant on defense and his league-leading 34 pass recep
tions attest to his offensive prowess. One nomination: Chris Bur ford.
California is duly wild over its quarterback, Joe Kapp. Kapp has
been a for two years but this season has really blossomed
. . . and the Bears have blossomed with him. Berkeley's master of
the split T option may have the inside track of the nation's signal
callers.
A Small List, So Far
Kapp and Burfonl. They look like the big choices in the Pacific
Coast Conference. Oregon Stale still has its great tackle, Ted Kates,
bul the Beavers' sometimes lack-luster performances this season
make it tough on linemen seeking honors. Southern California is
booming its sophomore end, Martin McKeever. But at best, McKeever
is a year away yet ... he was .just one of many, many good Trojans
when they played Stanford.
College of Pacific has Dick Bass, and herp is another real All-
American. Add this to the PCC's few and you have Burfonl, Kapp,
Bales' and Bass . . . our nominations.
And there was another Westerner on the list: Bill Long. Heard
of him? lie's the star lineman of a Willamette University (Salem,
Oregon) team which has rolled through seven straight games with
out defeat and is currently tabbed by Sports Illustrated as the No. 2
small college power in the nation. lie deserved a vote, and I doubt
if he will get many from the East.
From Stanford's intersectional opponents came two dandy nomi
nations: tackle Brock Strom of Air Force and center Jim Andreotti
of Northwestern. Both played bang-up games against the Tribe and
both have reportedly been standouts at every other instance this
season.
Burford, Bates, Strom, Long, Andreotti, Kapp and Bass. For
proximity and actual observation, these had to be our nominations.
The other four positions were filled rather incidentally by men we
had never seen ... or probably never come close to seeing . . . only
read about. But that's how All-Americans are selected.
Notably missing were such fellows as Pete Dawkins and Bob
Anderson of Army, Nick Pietrosante of Notre Dame, Bob Reifstiyder
of Navy, Sam Williams of Michigan State, Bed) White of Ohio State j
and all Oklahomans. These were the pre-season choices . . . and
they haven't been disappointments this year . . . but they aren't'
going to need our vote either.
The four remaining choices happened to be Rich Krehling of
Illinois (an end that UCLA coaches were comparing to Buford . . .
I.e must be good); John Guzik of Pittsburgh (a guard who tore apart I
Notre Dame last week); Bill Austin of Rutgers (a tailback who is
second only to Bass in statistics and sparks one of the few unbeatens
in the country; Billy Cannon of Ixtuisiana State (a 200-pound half
back who runs 100 yards in 9.5 seconds and also plays for the na
tion's No. 1 team).
