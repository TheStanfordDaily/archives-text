# Air, Ground Forces to Clash Saturday
## 
### 
That age-old question of ran a
good passing team beat a strong
running team may be answered
this Saturday when the passing
Stanford Indians play the visiting
black and orange Oregon State
Beavers.
The Beavers' strong single
wing attack features a balanced
line with the linemen playing
"the weak side" or "strong side"
positions depending on where the
OSC backs line up.
Highlighting Oregon State's po
tent ground attack is their big,

aggressive line. Pre-season-wise,
OSC had the top line on the coast,
and possibly in the West, and it
was for this reason that they
were picked for a first-place fin
ish. However, with the loss of
center Buzz Randall and injuries
to tackle Ted Bates and guard
Jim Brafkins, the Beavers have
been handicapped.
Pre-season All-American choice
Ted Bates, at strongside tackle,
leads the line charge. Bates is
one of the most aggressive boys
on the squad and beats most of

the team in wind sprint drills.
Another preseason All-American
pick is strongside guard Jim
Braekins. Brackins is another
Beaver Rose Bowl veteran and
was on the second All Coast team
last season.
Also set to see action In the line
are: Ed Kaohelaulii, a junior
tackle; Sonny Sanchez, a San
Franciscan, at weakside guard;
and centers Bruce Hake, junior,
or Doug Eashor, sophomore; both
are top-notch, ball hawking line
backers.
The Beavers suffered at end be
cause of veteran graduations but
scrappy Don Thiel, a junior at
weakside end, and Jerry Doman
or Aaron Thomas, at strongside
end, fill the bill nicely.
Coach Prothro has been hard

Pressed 1o fill last year's tailback
Joe Francis's shoes this year but
has many fine boys to choose
from. Dainard Paulson, a junior
who is one of the top punters
and passers the Beavers have
seen in a long time, currently
heads the list for this position.
Paul Lowe, a fast, hard runner
who scored against the Indians
down here two years ago, will
also see action.
Nub Beamer, a second • team
All-Coaster last year, is the Or
ange and Black fullback and top
rusher. Earnel Durden, another
Indian killer Tribe fans will not
forget, and John Horrillo, a

speedy transfer from Menlo JC,
play the important wingback po
sition.

and passers the Beavers have
seen in a long time, currently
heads the list for this position.
Paul Lowe, a fast, hard runner
who scored against the Indians
down here two years ago, will
also see action.
Nub Beamer, a second • team
All-Coaster last year, is the Or
ange and Black fullback and top
rusher. Earnel Durden, another
Indian killer Tribe fans will not
forget, and John Horrillo, a

speedy transfer from Menlo JC,
play the important wingback po
sition.
That age-old question of ran a
good passing team beat a strong
running team may be answered
this Saturday when the passing
Stanford Indians play the visiting
black and orange Oregon State
Beavers.
The Beavers' strong single
wing attack features a balanced
line with the linemen playing
"the weak side" or "strong side"
positions depending on where the
OSC backs line up.
Highlighting Oregon State's po
tent ground attack is their big,

aggressive line. Pre-season-wise,
OSC had the top line on the coast,
and possibly in the West, and it
was for this reason that they
were picked for a first-place fin
ish. However, with the loss of
center Buzz Randall and injuries
to tackle Ted Bates and guard
Jim Brafkins, the Beavers have
been handicapped.
Pre-season All-American choice
Ted Bates, at strongside tackle,
leads the line charge. Bates is
one of the most aggressive boys
on the squad and beats most of

the team in wind sprint drills.
Another preseason All-American
pick is strongside guard Jim
Braekins. Brackins is another
Beaver Rose Bowl veteran and
was on the second All Coast team
last season.
Also set to see action In the line
are: Ed Kaohelaulii, a junior
tackle; Sonny Sanchez, a San
Franciscan, at weakside guard;
and centers Bruce Hake, junior,
or Doug Eashor, sophomore; both
are top-notch, ball hawking line
backers.
The Beavers suffered at end be
cause of veteran graduations but
scrappy Don Thiel, a junior at
weakside end, and Jerry Doman
or Aaron Thomas, at strongside
end, fill the bill nicely.
Coach Prothro has been hard

Pressed 1o fill last year's tailback
Joe Francis's shoes this year but
has many fine boys to choose
from. Dainard Paulson, a junior
who is one of the top punters
and passers the Beavers have
seen in a long time, currently
heads the list for this position.
