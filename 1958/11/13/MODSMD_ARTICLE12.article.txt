# Student Exodus Recalled
## 
### 
Of the weekly exodus of 4000
refugees from East Germany,
foreign scholar Wolfgang Storch
says, "II is important that the
young people, who will one day
he the backbone of the system in
East Germany, continually go
away; this weakens the system
considerably."
Storch, who left the Russian
zone of Germany in 1953, says
that the flight of productive
workers has done "some dam
age already to the East German
economic system, which is prob
ably one reason for the recent
Russian campaign" to get the
West out of Berlin.
An ASSU exchange student
from the Free University of Ber
lin, Storch had worked on an
East German newspaper for a
year and a half. After his flight,
he alternately worked and trav
eled in Spain, France, and Eng
land, then studied political sci
ence, history and literature at the
Free University. He is looking
forward to a career as a foreign
correspondent.

Finding the Stanford "system
of little assignments and a rigid
time schedule" oppressive, Storch

says this system leaves no lime
for important work on material
of the student's own interest.
''Grades, points and credits crip
ple initiative." He feels, however,
that student-faculty relations here
are much more natural and profi
table than in European schools.
At Stanford he is studying
American literature, Spanish and
history. He expects to give talks
on Germany and Europe while he
is here, and is to he a panel mem
ber for a forthcoming lIR discus
sion on the intellectual situation
in Eastern Europe. His objective
now and for his planned career is
to help explain national differ
ences and their bases In cultural
differences.
A member of the Stanford soc
cer team, he favors soccer over
football because the many inter-
I rupi ions in a football game "de
stroy the tension that builds up in
I a game that goes 011 continually."
: He also declares, "American beer
is much less strong than German,
and I pity people who are under
21!"

Of the weekly exodus of 4000
refugees from East Germany,
foreign scholar Wolfgang Storch
says, "II is important that the
young people, who will one day
he the backbone of the system in
East Germany, continually go
away; this weakens the system
considerably."
Storch, who left the Russian
zone of Germany in 1953, says
that the flight of productive
workers has done "some dam
age already to the East German
economic system, which is prob
ably one reason for the recent
Russian campaign" to get the
West out of Berlin.
An ASSU exchange student
from the Free University of Ber
lin, Storch had worked on an
East German newspaper for a
year and a half. After his flight,
he alternately worked and trav
eled in Spain, France, and Eng
land, then studied political sci
ence, history and literature at the
Free University. He is looking
forward to a career as a foreign
correspondent.

Finding the Stanford "system
of little assignments and a rigid
time schedule" oppressive, Storch

says this system leaves no lime
for important work on material
of the student's own interest.
''Grades, points and credits crip
ple initiative." He feels, however,
that student-faculty relations here
are much more natural and profi
table than in European schools.
At Stanford he is studying
American literature, Spanish and
history. He expects to give talks
on Germany and Europe while he
is here, and is to he a panel mem
ber for a forthcoming lIR discus
sion on the intellectual situation
in Eastern Europe. His objective
now and for his planned career is
to help explain national differ
ences and their bases In cultural
differences.
A member of the Stanford soc
cer team, he favors soccer over
football because the many inter-
I rupi ions in a football game "de
stroy the tension that builds up in
I a game that goes 011 continually."
: He also declares, "American beer
is much less strong than German,
and I pity people who are under
21!"
