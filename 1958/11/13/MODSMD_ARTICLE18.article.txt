# How We Look

Think of yoi rski.f, for a moinenl, us a resident of the "outside
world" called upon to continent on Stanford and its students.
The initial descriptive words which come to mind would prob
ably lie these: wealth, intelligence and snobbery.
Wealth--because of the founding Stanford#' wealth, and be
cause Stanford is a private university which charges tuition.
Intelligence— because ol Stanford's high academic record, and
because of the line showing its graduates have made lor themselves
in business, politics, science, academic fields in and other areas
of life.
Snobbery—because in the minds ol many that is associated
with wealth, and because Stanford is proud of its record and
doesn't mind saving so on occasion. To those who are foreign to
the university, pride can he interpreted as snobbery.
Those who do not immediately form judgments on
Stanford by association nith its history look at the
present students ami faculty t<> form other judgments.
On Monday we printed letters from alumni protesting action
of Stanford students at the football game Homecoming week end,
when a large body of students left before the end ol the third
quarter of the ball game.
These alumni are not so much angry as they are ashamed ol
the picture of Stanford which this incident gave to the public.
The exodus drew comments from newspaper writers and other
citizens throughout the Hay Area.
The Ihiiversity does not exist to s<itisfy the pride of
the alumni: perhaps it does not even exist for the sake
of its students—as one professor pointed out in a recent
article in Ihe Daily. Hut the fact does remain that the
students are here, and. once here, should consider the
picture they present to the community-at-large.
Certainly, walking out in the middle of one lootball game is
not indicative of the whole character ol the Stanford student, hut
the thought that comes to many minds after even one such event
is that Stanford students are quitters — fair-weather friends.
The fact that a goodly number of the members of the rooting
section did stay and see the game through to its end is overlooked,
because those who left did so en masse.
Attendance at a football game is like a job —once the
decision is made to do something, it should be cat i led
through to the end—in this case, through the singing of
the. Stanford Hymn.
If it should happen that this is a regular occurrence (this be
comes hypothetical because we are sure it v\ ill not; hut ll' . .
there are dangers that the general public will get the idea that
Stanford students are quitters; for this is the phase of Stanford
life they see —despite the fine academic work which is done- and
this attitude certainly has never helped anyone, nor would it help
Stanford.
