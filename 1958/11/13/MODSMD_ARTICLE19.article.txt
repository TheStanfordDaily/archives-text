# West Beaten In Near-East Duel
## 
### Lester O'Shea IIR Political Analyst 
It is perhaps not generally un
derstood that the United States
and the West have been badly
beaten in the struggle for con
trol of the strategic, oil-rich Near
East; such, nevertheless, is the
case.
There can be no questioning the
fact that militant Arab national
ism, as exemplified by Gamel A.
Nasser and his United Arab Re
public, does not favor American
and Western interests: it is, in
deed. of its very essence to op
pose them. Nasser's Arab nation
alism was, and is, offered to the
Near East as the alternative not
to apparent Soviet domination,
which has never in the past ex
isted there, but to the pro-West
ern regimes which, say two years
ago, controlled almost all the
area. Nasser's rise, hence, means,
necessarily, a corresponding de
cline in Western power and posi
tion.
Our policy—in particular, our
much-heralded Eisenhower Dor
trine, which provided protec
tion for the states' of the Near
East against external aggres
sion—has failed to prevent the
rise of this opposing force, pri
marily because it contains no
provision t'or meeting the real
threat to pro-Western regimes,
the internal one.
The Royal Iraqi Government
recently ceased, in every sense of
the word, to exist, and a further
shift, from the present republic
to complete union with the UAR,
appears likely; with the with
drawal of British troops, King
Hussein's regime totters in Jor
dan; Syria, from a more or less
moderate state, has become a
UAR province; King Saud of Ara
bia has transferred effective con
trol of his government to a prince
highly friendly to the Nasser
movement; backward Yemen has
entered into a sort of union with

the UAR: yet no borders have |
been crossed by armies.
Nor has Lebanon failed to par-1
ticipate in the swing. A pro-West
ern president, Chamoun, intend-1
ing to seek re-election, called on [
the United States to protect his
government from a UAR-supplied j
rebellion led by one Karamani. j
We sent, along with our troops, a i
"troubleshooter" by the name of j
Murphy; and the outcome of Cha- j
moun's call for help was that he
left office and Karamani became
premier, Lebanon's UN represen
tative being ordered to cease at
tacks upon the UAR.
The whole sorry state of af
fairs is basically due to one
hard fact: the people of the
Near East, in general, prefer
Nasser's militant, anti-Western
Arab nationalism to the old,
pro-Western order of tilings.
The Iraqis were highly enthu
siastic* in dismembering their
staunchly pro-Western rulers
(shades, indeed, of 1793!); Ihe
UARians worship Nasser; the
Jordanians dislike King Hussein;
most Lebanese, apparently, op
posed stalwart President Cha
moun.
It follows from the above that
protecting Near Eastern govern
ments against external aggres
sion does little good unless their
governments also be protected
against their people; and this, as
most see it, would run counter to
democratic principles.
Whether the American politi
cal tradition necessarily de
mands the advocacy of democ
racy for those wiio cannot yet
read or write may, of course,
be debated; we have, however,
chosen to support democratic
ideals even where their appli
cability was- more doubtful than
in the Near East.
This approach, however, unfor- j
tunately, has in the past been,
and is at present, incapable of
preventing the erosion of West
ern influence and position in the
Near East.

Nor has Lebanon failed to par-1
ticipate in the swing. A pro-West
ern president, Chamoun, intend-1
ing to seek re-election, called on [
the United States to protect his
government from a UAR-supplied j
rebellion led by one Karamani. j
We sent, along with our troops, a i
"troubleshooter" by the name of j
Murphy; and the outcome of Cha- j
moun's call for help was that he
left office and Karamani became
premier, Lebanon's UN represen
tative being ordered to cease at
tacks upon the UAR.
The whole sorry state of af
fairs is basically due to one
hard fact: the people of the
Near East, in general, prefer
Nasser's militant, anti-Western
Arab nationalism to the old,
pro-Western order of tilings.
The Iraqis were highly enthu
siastic* in dismembering their
staunchly pro-Western rulers
(shades, indeed, of 1793!); Ihe
UARians worship Nasser; the
Jordanians dislike King Hussein;
most Lebanese, apparently, op
posed stalwart President Cha
moun.
It follows from the above that
protecting Near Eastern govern
ments against external aggres
sion does little good unless their
governments also be protected
against their people; and this, as
most see it, would run counter to
democratic principles.
Whether the American politi
cal tradition necessarily de
mands the advocacy of democ
racy for those wiio cannot yet
read or write may, of course,
be debated; we have, however,
chosen to support democratic
ideals even where their appli
cability was- more doubtful than
in the Near East.
This approach, however, unfor- j
tunately, has in the past been,
and is at present, incapable of
preventing the erosion of West
ern influence and position in the
Near East.
It is perhaps not generally un
derstood that the United States
and the West have been badly
beaten in the struggle for con
trol of the strategic, oil-rich Near
East; such, nevertheless, is the
case.
There can be no questioning the
fact that militant Arab national
ism, as exemplified by Gamel A.
Nasser and his United Arab Re
public, does not favor American
and Western interests: it is, in
deed. of its very essence to op
pose them. Nasser's Arab nation
alism was, and is, offered to the
Near East as the alternative not
to apparent Soviet domination,
which has never in the past ex
isted there, but to the pro-West
ern regimes which, say two years
ago, controlled almost all the
area. Nasser's rise, hence, means,
necessarily, a corresponding de
cline in Western power and posi
tion.
Our policy—in particular, our
much-heralded Eisenhower Dor
trine, which provided protec
tion for the states' of the Near
East against external aggres
sion—has failed to prevent the
rise of this opposing force, pri
marily because it contains no
provision t'or meeting the real
threat to pro-Western regimes,
the internal one.
The Royal Iraqi Government
recently ceased, in every sense of
the word, to exist, and a further
shift, from the present republic
to complete union with the UAR,
appears likely; with the with
drawal of British troops, King
Hussein's regime totters in Jor
dan; Syria, from a more or less
moderate state, has become a
UAR province; King Saud of Ara
bia has transferred effective con
trol of his government to a prince
