Tito's Yugoslavia with Russia.)

The most dramatic changes on
I he Yugoslav scene in recent years |
have occurred in the spheres of
politics and economics. This was
a strong impression I brought
back from my visit there the past
summer.
The government lias been de
centralized and authoritarian con
trols and police methods slacken
ed. Marketing methods have been
introduced; worker s' councils
have been entrusted with the
management of industrial firms;
farmers are no longer threatened i
by collectivization; and many oth
er features of liberalized socialist j
system are characteristic of eco- j
nomic changes in Yugoslavia.
All these changes came as a
result of the Yugoslav expulsion j
from the Cominform in 1918 and
the freedom that was thus gained '
from the stilling influences and
oppressive controls ol the Soviet I
Union. The latter, however, has j
never ceased trying to extend its'
sway over Yugoslavia.
Post-War Relations
Post-World War II relations be
tween Yugoslavia and the Soviet
Union went through several
stages of development. From 1945'
to 1948 the Yugoslav Communist
leaders blindly copied Soviet prac-j
tices and placed themselves under
Moscow rule.
After many costly failures, seri
ous setbacks in economic plan
ning and losses of prestige at
home and abroad, the Yugoslav
leaders decided to assert their in
dependence.
They were resentful of the fact
that the Soviet spokesmen treated !
them as underlings, minimized)
their country's wartime partisan |
achievements and harnessed Yu
goslavia to Soviet political and ec j
onomic interests rathe)* than the'
cause of "world socialism."
Leads to Conflict
This led to an unavoidable con
flict with the Soviet Union, and!
at the Bucharest meeting of the
Cominform in June 1948 the Yu
goslav Communist party was ex
pelled and the unhappy marriage
between Yugoslavia and the So
viet Union annulled.
At first the Yugoslav leaders
hoped to resolve their conflict
with the Soviet Union by partially
satisfying their Soviet critics. For
this reason they pleaded loyalty !
to the Soviet Union and its brand \
of socialism, posed as orthodox !
Stalinists and in some c a s e s

sought to outdo other Communist
states in implementing Soviet di
recti ves.
The collectivization of agricul
ture, for example, was forced
ruthlessly in order to prove to the
Soviet critics that the Yugoslavs
were not "too easy" on capitalists
and kulaks. The Yugoslav leaders
at this time had not yet developed
a "heretical system" of socialism.
It took them several months to
realize that the break with the
Soviet camp could not be healed
without complete and uncondi
tional surrender.
Own Socialism
The period from 1948 to 1953
was one of ideological war be
tween the Soviet bloc and Yugo
slavia and a period dining which
ihe Yugoslavs developed I heir
own kind of socialism.
Stalin's attempts to bring Yugo
slavia to its knees failed. The
multifarious forms of Soviet in
timidation military threats, eco
nomic blockade and propaganda
not only failed to destroy Marshal
Tito but actually compelled him
to produce a rival Communis! the
ory and system. He was perhaps
encouraged to do so by the sup
port which the country found in
the United States and other West
ern powers.
Yugoslavia was able to preserve
its independence, endure the hard
ships caused by the Soviet eco
nomic blockade and to effect a
Western economic orientation. In
fact, the country, despite numer
ous defects in its body politic,
emerged stronger as a result of
the break with the Soviet Union
than it had been while a member
of the Soviet bloc.
Repair Damage
At home, the Yugoslavs were
able to repair much of the dam
age caused by the earlier enforce
ment of the Soviet system. On
the international front Yugoslavia
and her leaders gained unprece
dented prestige and respect.
In November 19,"52 the Yugoslav
theorists succeeded in putting
their various ideas and theories
into "a coherent ideology," which
they defined as a system of "ex
ternally independent and internal
ly decentralized Communism."
The Yugoslavs contend their
system is based on Marxism and
Leninism and that the Soviet
leaders, and not they, are guilty
of revisionism. The Soviet Union,

they insist, has "wandered from
the Marxist road."
In the opinion of the Yugoslav
leaders, the Soviet bloc of coun
tries does not represent the
"world camp of socialism" but a
number of countries which aie
harnessed to serve the Soviet state
interests.
Beyond Denial
Yugoslav leaders go beyond a
denial of the Soviet charges that
they have betrayed socialism and
have become the stooges of capi
talism to criticize, in turn, the
Soviet leader s for promoting
Great Russian nationalism to the
detriment of othei nationalities in
the Soviet Union; for having de
veloped a highly centralized bu
reaucratic system of government
and economy; for having betrayed
the cause ol workers; for indulg
ing in imperialistic activities; and
for resorting to terror and tyr
anny.
The Yugoslav socialist system
which has been gradually imple
mented since 1950 allows some
what greater political freedom
than is found in Soviet bloc coun
tries. The national administration
has been decentralized, and steps
have been taken to weaken and
restrict the growth of bttreauc
racy.
Rigid lo Share
The peasant winking coopera
tives (collective farms) have been
completely disbanded. The
worker\have been given the right
to participate in the management
of industrial enterprises and to
share 1 in their profits. Many other
concessions to democracy and de
partures from the autocratic So
viet system have been introduced.
Yugoslavs have repeatedly an
nounced they are willing to co
operate with other "socialist" na
tions, but only on the basis of
complete equality.
From 1953 to 1957 both fddes
tried to heal the schism.
Stalin's death in 1953 ushered in
a somewhat modified Soviet pol
icy, not only in regard to the non-
Communist world but also in re
gard to Yugoslavia. There was a
great deal of official talk about
the possibility of coexistence.
The ne// policies relaxation in
side the Soviet Union and coexist
ence abroad were given added
impetus by Nikita Khrushchev
when he took over the reins of
power in the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev condemned Stalin's
methods and purged some of Sta
lin's closest friends. Diplomatic
relations with Yugoslavia were
restored and economic intercourse
normalized. Moreover, the Soviet
Union concluded with Yugoslavia
a special economic aid agreement
which was to make possible con
struction of certain vital indus
trial projects.
Finally, in May of 1955 Khru
shchev journeyed to Yugoslavia,
and while there he blamed Sta
lin's friend Lavrenti Beria for the
Soviet-Yugoslav rupture and ex
changed sweet words with Pre
mier Tito.
(To be concluded)
