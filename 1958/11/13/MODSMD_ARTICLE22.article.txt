# Indians at Full Strength
## 
### 
For the first time after opening game this season, Stanford grid
ders will be at full strength by game time. Trainer Connie Jarvis
reports that all the Tribe is ready to go but doubts that big Indian
Rick MoMillen will see aetion against OSC this Saturday as his ankle
is still a little weak.
Whether MeMillen will start against the Cal Bears in the Dig One

is still a question, but in all likeli
hood he should at least see ac
tion against the Kappmen, and
can't be counted out against ihe
Beavers.
The starting quarterback is still
in doubt, as ii usually is every
week at this time. Both Bob Nico
let and Dick Norman were wor k
ing with the offense in yester
day's practice, and Sid Garber
was practicing with the Tribe de
fensive unit.
Nicolet
Nicolet has the edge in statis
tics as he is currently leading the
PCC in passing and is third in to
tal offense. Norman is third in
passing, behind Nicolet and Bob
Newman of WSC, and had a good
game against the Ducks last
week. Of course Garber can't be i
counted out for his good show
ings in the past, so ii looks like
Coach Jack Curtice has his same
old choosing problem this week
again.
Halfback John Bond rejoined
the squad this week and certainly
can he counted (in against OSC.
End Joel Freis, last year's star,
who has been in and out all sea
son hecau.se of injuries, should
also play some this weekend.
The Cards will again count
heavily on "old reliable" end
Chris Burford. Burford is still
leading coast ends in receiving
and coupled with his tough de
fensive play and durability (he
seems to average nearly 60 min
utes a game) this makes him
Stanford's top choice for All
American honors this year.
Third in l*< C
Ends Irv Nikolai, currently
third in PCC pass receiving, and
Jim Ukropina can be counted on |
for a good show also.
The rest of the line should he
the same as last week, with either
Roch Conklin or Doug Pursell at
center; Bob Peterson and Doug
Dawson at guards; and Erie Pro
liva and Troy Barbee at tackles.
Chris Plain had a line game
against the Web lee t last weekend
and may be playing some defen
sive tackle against the Beavers.
The Card back field picture is a
little hazy but fullback Gil Dowd 1
will certainly see plenty of action.
Dowd was in top form against the
Ducks and showed that he has
gotten over the injuries which had
bothered him for a few games
this year. Jim Byrer and Dick :
Bowers will also be out to upset j
ihe Beavers, with their fine run- j
ning.
Stanford will run up against
the first opponent that uses the j
punt as an offensive weapon this
Saturday.
