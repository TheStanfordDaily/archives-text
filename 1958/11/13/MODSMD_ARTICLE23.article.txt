# Frosh Race Undecided
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
To the casual observer the
freshman football situation in
California as it stands now may
not seem particularly confusing;
however, to the more concerned
spectator, the state of affairs
which the frosh race is in now
provides opporunity for deep cog
itation.
The Stanford University fresh
man football team plays three
games during a season, one each
with Ihe University of Southern
California, the University of Cali
fornia and UCLA. Each of these
teams also has a three-game
schedule against each other. The
team which wins the most games
is the mythical champion of the
league.
Nol Working Out
This particular season, though,
things just do not seem to be
working out. Here's why:
On Nov. 1, the Stanford fresh
men, after leading at halftime,
lost by a score of 14 to 0 to an
eager Southern California team.
At Ihe same time in Los Angeles
the California yearlings were tak
ing a heating by an identical score
from the UCLA team.
Last weekend the Stanford
team made the trek to the South
land to play UCLA, while the Cal
frosh also went to LA to meet SC.
Slan 112 or d (which had lost)
trounced IK'LA (which had won),
19 to (i. Simultaneously Cal
(which had lost) smashed SC
(which had won) to the tune of
:w to 20.
Four-Way Tie
Thus after two games each,
there is a four-way tie for first
place (or last place) in a frtur
team league.
This leads to the inevitable con
clusion that, with only one game
left for each team, there will be
two mythical champions of the
freshman league this year (un
less one of this week's games
ends in a tie in which case we go
home and go to bed). Next week
pits Cal against Stanford in the
annual "little big game" in Stan
ford Stadium while SC plays UC
LA in Los Angeles.
