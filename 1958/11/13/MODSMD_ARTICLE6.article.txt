# WASHINGTON FORECAST
## Berlin Position May be Menaced

(Compiled from the Associated Press)
Diplomatic officials Wednesday forecast a major drive by East
German and Russian authorities to shake the Allied foothold in
Western Berlin in the months ahead.
Most thought the Reds would stop short of blockading the Western
zone. There was speculation they might periodically shut off traffic

in an attempt to force Western
nations to give full diplomatic
recognition to the East German
regime.
State Department offiicals who
discussed the Soviet - East Ger
man maneuvering said, however,
there was no reason to believe the
Reds would use force to back up
their demands at this time.
Grotewohl
These authorities reported their
considered judgment in the wake
of new remarks by East German
Premier Otto Grotewohl about
the future of divided Berlin.
Grotewohl beat a hasty retreat
Wednesday night apparently on
orders from the Kremlin â€”after
indicating the Soviet Union might
be willing to withdraw troops
from East Germany without wait
ing for the West to pull out.
Soviet Troops
A revised version of a state
ment the Communist East Ger
man Premier gave a news confer
ence made clear the Kremlin was
not retreating on its stand that
Soviet troops will stay as long as
Western armies remain.
Evacuation of Red army units,
Washington officials said, was
the last thing Grotewohl and his
puppet regime would want since
it would leave him at the mercy
of the East Germans.
What worried State Depart
ment experts was Khrushchev's
announced intention of turning
over all Russian responsibility in
PJast Berlin to representatives of
the East German regime.
