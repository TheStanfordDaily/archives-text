Unlicensed magazine solici

magazine subscriptions on the
campus during the last couple
of days, reports Stanford Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis.
"We have reports* that they
are stopping Stanford women
on the-streets to sell magazines
and that they demand cash for
the subscriptions," said Davis.
"These persons are transients
and the police department
warns students that the maga
zines may never be sent," added
Davis.
"We urge students not to pa
tronize unlicensed solicitors at
any time," concluded Davis.
