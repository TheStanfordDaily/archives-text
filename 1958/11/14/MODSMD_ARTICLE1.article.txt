# NUCLEAR CONTROL
## Russia Asked To Ban Tests 
### 
GENEVA (A } ) The United States Thursday called on Russia to
join the U.S. and British governments in a double-header project to
suspend nuclear tests and co-operate with an international control
organization.
The American proposal was introduced in the three-power talks

by Ambassador James J. Wads
worth.
It was designed to free the
delegates from the disagreement
over the order of businss that has
bogged down their discussions
since they convened two weeks
ago.
Wadsworth's paper described
what the Americans and British
insist should be in a treaty for
suspension of atomic and hydro
gen weapon tests.
Its first article called for the
undertaking of the double obliga
tion, linking test suspension
tightly to a control system.
Treaty Control
The American plan calls for a
treaty in which everything hav
ing to do with the working out of
an efficient control system would
be included.
The second part of the Ameri
can plan deals with the general
subject of establishing an inter
national cont r o 1 organization
along lines recommended by East
ern and Western experts at a Ge
neva conference last summer.
The Russians have tried to get
the U.S. and British delegations
first to commit themselves to an
immediate and permanent sus
pension of nuclear tests. Then,
the Russians have said, the con
ference could go on to talk about
controls. In the Western view,
however, the Russians have given
no ironbound assurances they
would not stall on that issue.
"Concession"
During two informal meetings
earlier this week the Russians ad
vanced what they claimed was a
concession.
They still wanted agreement
first to a suspension of tests but
said this could be put aside while
the conference talked about the
control system.
In the Western view this pro
posal contained an obvious trap.
If this conference finally blew up
the Russians still would have a
semi-agreed treaty draft in which
the Americans and British under
took to halt tests. This Moscow
could wave before the world with
the implication that it was the
fault of the Western powers that
no control system ever material
ized.
It was to avoid just such a dead
fall that the Americans advanced
their plan for a double obligation,
informants said.

Treaty Control
The American plan calls for a
treaty in which everything hav
ing to do with the working out of
an efficient control system would
be included.
The second part of the Ameri
can plan deals with the general
subject of establishing an inter
national cont r o 1 organization
along lines recommended by East
ern and Western experts at a Ge
neva conference last summer.
The Russians have tried to get
the U.S. and British delegations
first to commit themselves to an
immediate and permanent sus
pension of nuclear tests. Then,
the Russians have said, the con
ference could go on to talk about
controls. In the Western view,
however, the Russians have given
no ironbound assurances they
would not stall on that issue.
"Concession"
During two informal meetings
earlier this week the Russians ad
vanced what they claimed was a
concession.
They still wanted agreement
first to a suspension of tests but
said this could be put aside while
the conference talked about the
control system.
In the Western view this pro
posal contained an obvious trap.
If this conference finally blew up
the Russians still would have a
semi-agreed treaty draft in which
the Americans and British under
took to halt tests. This Moscow
could wave before the world with
the implication that it was the
fault of the Western powers that
no control system ever material
ized.
It was to avoid just such a dead
fall that the Americans advanced
their plan for a double obligation,
informants said.
GENEVA (A } ) The United States Thursday called on Russia to
join the U.S. and British governments in a double-header project to
suspend nuclear tests and co-operate with an international control
organization.
The American proposal was introduced in the three-power talks

by Ambassador James J. Wads
worth.
It was designed to free the
delegates from the disagreement
over the order of businss that has
bogged down their discussions
since they convened two weeks
ago.
Wadsworth's paper described
what the Americans and British
insist should be in a treaty for
suspension of atomic and hydro
gen weapon tests.
Its first article called for the
undertaking of the double obliga
tion, linking test suspension
tightly to a control system.
