LONDON (IV) The Soviet Com
munist party Thursday night link
ed former Premier Nikolai Bul
ganin with the "anti-party group"
of high officials expelled from of
fice last year.
Bulganin was mentioned almost
casually in a report on Russia's
upcoming seven-year plan for eco
nomic development of the Soviet
Union.
Moscow radio, quoting the re
port, said the Communist party
"is conducting a determined strug
gle against those who cling to the
old, outmoded form and methods
of work, were afflicted with con
servatism and opposed the imple
mentation of the Leninist general
line of the party.
"In this contest the theses [re
ports | refer to the exposure and
routing of the anti-party group of
M en k o v, Kaganovich, Molotov,
Bulganin and Shepilov, who join
ed them, who slid down the road
to faction-splitting activity."
It was the first time Russia has
leveled serious charges against
the bearded ex-premier who once
shared the spotlight of Kremlin
power with Nikita Khrushchev.
Bulganin's fall from power
came after he reportedly lost fa
vor with Khrushchev over ouster
of the "anti-party group" in the
summer of 1957.
