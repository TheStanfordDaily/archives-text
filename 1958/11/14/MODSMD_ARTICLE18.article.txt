# It's A TEST
## 
### 
Tins week, we've pointed out, first, ihe privilege that Stanford
students have in sitting in the rooting section at lootbull games;
second, the fact that for many the only picture of Stanford is that
which they see at ball games —and we, of course, want them to
get a favorable picture.
Tomorrow's game is a test —not half so much for the team as
for the rooters. Those who remember what happened at the USC
game two weeks ago will be watching to see if it happens again,
and to see if their original picture is confirmed.
We're not going to plead, for the sake of "school spirit,' that
everyone get out and attend the ball game. Interests are so diver
sified on this campus that we recognize some people simply do
not like football. There are enough who want to watch a good
game —and the games are nearly always of high quality, regard
less of who is winning—that there will be a rooting section.
But to those who are wondering whether they should »o to
the game or not, l«>t us direct this question:
If you go, will you sop the game through to the cud?
If you are not willing to stay to the final gun (except, of course,
in cases of illness or dire emergency), may we suggest that you
turn to your Western (liv hook, or whatever the other activity
may be?
Those who are tempted to leave when Stanford is on the short
end of the score may say that Stanford's football reputation is
going down and they can I bear to sit and watch. But the team
is trying to win for Stanford. Those who walk out on Stanford
in the middle of the game are not even trying.
