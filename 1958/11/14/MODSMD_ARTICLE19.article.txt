# Divorce' Farce Successful Play
## 
### 
A Review
By Thomas Ferrell
Victorien Sardou's "Let's Get a
Divorce," Cal-Stanford's first ex
ercise in togetherness, played to
an unfortunately small audience
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium Wed
nesday night, perhaps due to the
regrettable competitive scheduling
of other interesting events.
This parlor farce of the '80's is
based upon a suitably ridiculous
pretext: that when a divorce is
planned so that the wife may mar
ry a third party, the lame-duck
husband becomes, in effect, the
lover; and the dashing co-respond
ent becomes the victim of the
wife's boredom with the existing
state of affairs.
Fast Moving
Director Robert Goldsby has
been at some pains to keep the
action moving as fast as the dia
logue, with the result that the pro
duction is occasionally more fun
to look at than to listen to.
Don Ingraham's talent for mug
ging, posing, dancing, and the like,
carry off the part of the husband
turned - lover; and his delivery,
wooden in the first act, catches up
with his face and hands in the

second.
Karen Walker, as the dissatis
fied wife, pouts very prettily, but
mars her lines by frequent false
starts. Bill Harrison presents the
lover, Adhemar de Gratignan, as
a candied apple with a mustache;
and he squeaks.
The three principals receive ad
mirable support from one of the
husband's cronies, played by Wil
liam Carleton—of whom, as well
as Ingraham, it would be nice to
see more. The two have a couple
of very well-balanced ensemble
scenes.
Attitudes Vary
Various attitudes toward di
vorce as an institution are ex
pressed by Ragna Nyblom, a friv
olous widow (pro), whose French
accent is senseless, since everyone
here is supposed to be French;
and by Jeanette Justin, a frivol
ous wife (contra), who realizes
that the possibility of divorce
takes the sport out of marriage.
The village gossip (Mary Ann
Manhart) and the inexplicably sin
ister little Bafourdin (Jon Folk
man) are apparently gratuitous
characters.
The farce is resolved in the last
act, in which wife is seduced by
husband, right out of the affec
tions of the righteously enraged
lover; wife and husband are recon
ciled in a restaurant closet; while
a gang of waiters, led by Stephen
Vause, and of French "Keystone
cops," captained by Don Cairns,
chase each other's tails outside the
door.
Play Benefits
The entire production benefits
enormously from the blocking and
movement instilled into it by di
rector Goldsby as well as from the
pleasantly frivolous sets by John
Dreier.
Miss Walker's deliciously candy
striped gown was done by Angela
Goldsby, who, together with Iv
husband, was also responsible for
the translation from the French of
Sardou.
The sole visual flaw of the pro
duction is that perpetual curse of
college theater —the crew cut. One
cannot accept William Gean as a
flat - topped French butler, al
though Lyn Edgington as the par
lor maid scuttles her derriere ami
ably about the stage in an effort
to divert attention from him.
The total effect of the show is
very funny. Those who were un
able to see it here might do well
to jaunt up to Berkeley, where it
will be repeated tonight and Sat
urday at 8 p.m. in Cal's Wheeler
Auditorium.

A Review
By Thomas Ferrell
Victorien Sardou's "Let's Get a
Divorce," Cal-Stanford's first ex
ercise in togetherness, played to
an unfortunately small audience
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium Wed
nesday night, perhaps due to the
regrettable competitive scheduling
of other interesting events.
This parlor farce of the '80's is
based upon a suitably ridiculous
pretext: that when a divorce is
planned so that the wife may mar
ry a third party, the lame-duck
husband becomes, in effect, the
lover; and the dashing co-respond
ent becomes the victim of the
wife's boredom with the existing
state of affairs.
Fast Moving
Director Robert Goldsby has
been at some pains to keep the
action moving as fast as the dia
logue, with the result that the pro
duction is occasionally more fun
to look at than to listen to.
Don Ingraham's talent for mug
ging, posing, dancing, and the like,
carry off the part of the husband
turned - lover; and his delivery,
wooden in the first act, catches up
with his face and hands in the

second.
Karen Walker, as the dissatis
fied wife, pouts very prettily, but
mars her lines by frequent false
starts. Bill Harrison presents the
lover, Adhemar de Gratignan, as
a candied apple with a mustache;
and he squeaks.
The three principals receive ad
mirable support from one of the
husband's cronies, played by Wil
liam Carleton—of whom, as well
as Ingraham, it would be nice to
see more. The two have a couple
of very well-balanced ensemble
scenes.
Attitudes Vary
Various attitudes toward di
vorce as an institution are ex
pressed by Ragna Nyblom, a friv
olous widow (pro), whose French
accent is senseless, since everyone
here is supposed to be French;
and by Jeanette Justin, a frivol
ous wife (contra), who realizes
that the possibility of divorce
takes the sport out of marriage.
The village gossip (Mary Ann
Manhart) and the inexplicably sin
ister little Bafourdin (Jon Folk
man) are apparently gratuitous
characters.
The farce is resolved in the last
act, in which wife is seduced by
husband, right out of the affec
tions of the righteously enraged
lover; wife and husband are recon
ciled in a restaurant closet; while
a gang of waiters, led by Stephen
Vause, and of French "Keystone
cops," captained by Don Cairns,
chase each other's tails outside the
door.
Play Benefits
The entire production benefits
enormously from the blocking and
movement instilled into it by di
rector Goldsby as well as from the
pleasantly frivolous sets by John
Dreier.
Miss Walker's deliciously candy
striped gown was done by Angela
Goldsby, who, together with Iv
husband, was also responsible for
the translation from the French of
Sardou.
The sole visual flaw of the pro
duction is that perpetual curse of
college theater —the crew cut. One
cannot accept William Gean as a
flat - topped French butler, al
though Lyn Edgington as the par
lor maid scuttles her derriere ami
ably about the stage in an effort
to divert attention from him.
The total effect of the show is
very funny. Those who were un
able to see it here might do well
to jaunt up to Berkeley, where it
will be repeated tonight and Sat
urday at 8 p.m. in Cal's Wheeler
