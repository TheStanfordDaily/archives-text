# Divorce' Farce Successful Play
## 
### 
A Review
By Thomas Ferrell
Victorien Sardou's "Let's Get a
Divorce," Cal-Stanford's first ex
ercise in togetherness, played to
an unfortunately small audience
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium Wed
nesday night, perhaps due to the
regrettable competitive scheduling
of other interesting events.
This parlor farce of the '80's is
based upon a suitably ridiculous
pretext: that when a divorce is
planned so that the wife may mar
ry a third party, the lame-duck
husband becomes, in effect, the
lover; and the dashing co-respond
ent becomes the victim of the
wife's boredom with the existing
state of affairs.
Fast Moving
Director Robert Goldsby has
been at some pains to keep the
action moving as fast as the dia
logue, with the result that the pro
duction is occasionally more fun
to look at than to listen to.
Don Ingraham's talent for mug
ging, posing, dancing, and the like,
carry off the part of the husband
turned - lover; and his delivery,
wooden in the first act, catches up
with his face and hands in the

second.
Karen Walker, as the dissatis
fied wife, pouts very prettily, but
mars her lines by frequent false
starts. Bill Harrison presents the
lover, Adhemar de Gratignan, as
a candied apple with a mustache;
and he squeaks.
The three principals receive ad
mirable support from one of the
husband's cronies, played by Wil
liam Carleton—of whom, as well
as Ingraham, it would be nice to
see more. The two have a couple
of very well-balanced ensemble
scenes.
Attitudes Vary
Various attitudes toward di
vorce as an institution are ex
pressed by Ragna Nyblom, a friv
olous widow (pro), whose French
accent is senseless, since everyone
here is supposed to be French;
and by Jeanette Justin, a frivol
ous wife (contra), who realizes
that the possibility of divorce
takes the sport out of marriage.
The village gossip (Mary Ann
Manhart) and the inexplicably sin
ister little Bafourdin (Jon Folk
man) are apparently gratuitous
characters.
