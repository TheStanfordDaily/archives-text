Candy-bar names should be
brought up to date, believes a Los
Angeles State (yes, there is such
a college) columnist. The "Baby
Ruth" should be switched to the
"Mickey Mantle," for example;
and the "Milky Way" should be
come the "Sputnik Bar," or maybe
"Orbit"; while "Mountain Bar"
could be the "Sir Edmond Hillary
Treat." Wonder what this fellow
would call a "Tootsie Roll." . . .
Shades—or, rather, sounds—of
Wilbur (feminine version): The
fire bell, together with an eerie,
steady sound, routed Duke coeds
at 3 a.m. not long ago. Seems a
sophomore was awakened by a
stuck car horn in a parking lot and
decided to call campus police and
ask them to fix it. Since she was
unable to see the switchboard, an
other woman decided to turn on
the lights—and flicked the wrong
switch, setting off the fire alarm.
I don't believe I'd advise you to
use that explanation next time,
men of Wilbur. It just MIGHT
not go over.
Big controversy af Harvard:
The Athletic Council adopted a
program adding four of its
members to the cheer• leading
group and insisting that five of
the present yell leaders not he
allowed to finish the year. The
new plan also restricts the posi
tion to varsity letter winners.
The present cheerleaders are up
set, to put it mildly.
The U. of Washington bookstore

served free doughnuts and cider
one day recently, plus giving away
(yes, giving away) 51 door prizes,
including a Royal typewriter, a
Columbia record player, luggage,
etc. Why don't WE have things
like that?
Some of the STRANGEST
things appear in the classified ads
in college papers.
In the "Personal" column of the
Michigan Daily, the "Old Philoso
pher" gave the "motto of the mod
ern coed: Every man for herself."
"Girls! Become active in your
sorority. Learn to play the
trombone. Lessons at a slight
fee from Gilbert Lynn and his
hand from within." I can just
see how popular any of the
UCLA girls who answered this
ad must be!
Here's a Harvard man in bad
shape. "Oedipus is no worse than
I without my glasses," he com
plains in the "Lost" column.
"FOR SALE 12-ft. kayak. Can
vas covered; almost new 34-inch
beam. Very well constructed."
Ah, yes, just what we need.
From Penn State: "When you
and I were young, Maggie, 1 wish
we could have heard Canon Bryan
Green's lectures on love and mar
riage." No comment from Mag

Shades—or, rather, sounds—of
Wilbur (feminine version): The
fire bell, together with an eerie,
steady sound, routed Duke coeds
at 3 a.m. not long ago. Seems a
sophomore was awakened by a
stuck car horn in a parking lot and
decided to call campus police and
ask them to fix it. Since she was
unable to see the switchboard, an
other woman decided to turn on
the lights—and flicked the wrong
switch, setting off the fire alarm.

The Athletic Council adopted a

The U. of Washington bookstore

see how popular any of the
UCLA girls who answered this
ad must be!
Here's a Harvard man in bad
shape. "Oedipus is no worse than
I without my glasses," he com

"FOR SALE 12-ft. kayak. Can

beam. Very well constructed."
Ah, yes, just what we need.
From Penn State: "When you

An ad in the UCLA Daily

Candy-bar names should be
