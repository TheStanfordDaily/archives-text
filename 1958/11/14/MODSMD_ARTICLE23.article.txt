I am now resuming the story of
the interview itself.
After Mr. K. had talked aboul
the status quo, and about no
changes of frontiers by force, and
about the need of mutual consent
in the German question, I asked
him whether he would agree to
free negotiations between the two
Germanys, and whether, as one of
the four occupying powers, he
would accept an agreement nego
tiated by the two Germanys them
selves.
To this he replied quickly—
too quickly, as it developed —
that he would agree to this, and
that it would be best if the
troops of the occupying powers
were withdrawn before the ne
gotiations were concluded. This
would bring about "a more nor
mal condition."
I was not convinced he meant
what he had said — perhaps be
cause he had not fully understood
what a Westerner would mean
when he talks about "free nego
tiations" between the two Ger
manys.
So I asked him whether he
really meant that the occupying
powers would accept uncondition

ally the result of negotiations be
tween the two German govern
ments.
To this he replied that the occu
pying powers would "of course"
abide by Ihe Potsdam Agreement,
which states, he said, that. Ger
many should never again be in a
position to disturb the peace.
He left me with the reason
able certainty that if tiie West
ern powers proposed a free ne
gotiation by the two Germanys
the Soviet government would
not be willing to accept it.
His mention of the Potsdam
Agreement brought him quickly
to a complaint that the United
States is violating the agreement
by contributing to the remilitari
zation of West Germany. This
carried with it the implication
that there could be no reunifica
tion of the two Germanys as long
as West Germany was to be once
again a military power.

were withdrawn before the ne
gotiations were concluded. This
would bring about "a more nor
mal condition."
I was not convinced he meant
what he had said — perhaps be
cause he had not fully understood
what a Westerner would mean
when he talks about "free nego
tiations" between the two Ger
manys.
So I asked him whether he
really meant that the occupying
powers would accept uncondition

ally the result of negotiations be
tween the two German govern
ments.
To this he replied that the occu
pying powers would "of course"
abide by Ihe Potsdam Agreement,
which states, he said, that. Ger
many should never again be in a
position to disturb the peace.
He left me with the reason
able certainty that if tiie West
ern powers proposed a free ne
gotiation by the two Germanys
the Soviet government would
not be willing to accept it.
His mention of the Potsdam
Agreement brought him quickly
to a complaint that the United
States is violating the agreement
by contributing to the remilitari
zation of West Germany. This
carried with it the implication
that there could be no reunifica
tion of the two Germanys as long
as West Germany was to be once
again a military power.

I am now resuming the story of
the interview itself.
After Mr. K. had talked aboul
the status quo, and about no
changes of frontiers by force, and
about the need of mutual consent
in the German question, I asked
him whether he would agree to
free negotiations between the two
Germanys, and whether, as one of
the four occupying powers, he
would accept an agreement nego
tiated by the two Germanys them
selves.
To this he replied quickly—
too quickly, as it developed —
that he would agree to this, and
that it would be best if the
troops of the occupying powers
were withdrawn before the ne
gotiations were concluded. This
would bring about "a more nor
mal condition."
I was not convinced he meant
what he had said — perhaps be
cause he had not fully understood
what a Westerner would mean
when he talks about "free nego

manys.
