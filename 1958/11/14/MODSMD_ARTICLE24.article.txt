# Red Crisis Breaks Open
## 
### Wayne Vucinich Professor of History 
(Editor's Note: This is the
final part of a two-part article
by Wayne Vucinich, professor
of history, on the relationship
between Yugoslavia and the So
viet Union. Yesterday's article
discussed the situation up to
1955 when Khrushehe\ went to
"exchange sweet wolds with
Premier Tito.")

The policy of relaxation, favor
ed by Khrushchev, led to freer
political expression in the Soviet
Union and in satellite countries.
The crises which Khrushchev had
hoped to forestall, however, broke
into the open. There were the dis
turbances in East Germany and
Poland, which culminated into the
Hungarian and Polish revolutions
in the autumn of 1956.
Khrushchev, in the meantime,
had realized that his conciliatory
steps after the May 1955 visit to
Yugoslavia and his soothing state
ments at the 20th party congress
in February 1956 had failed to
bring Yugoslavia into the Soviet
cam]).
The Hungarian revolution found
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union
on opposite sides. The Yugoslav
leaders supported lmre Nagy, a
Magyar Titoist, and the Soviel
leaders backed Janos Kadar, a
Magyar Stalinist. Soviet tanks
brought the latter to power as tiie
Y u go s 1 a v and Soviet leaders
charged each other with a variety
of misdeeds.
Determination
Determination to hold onlo the
domain inherited from Stalin com
pelled Khrushchev to use military
force and to slide back into Stalin
ist despotism. Thousands of Hun
garians fled to Yugoslavia.
The Soviet leaders once again
began a campaign against what
they called "bourgeois national
ism" in Yugoslavia, and in Febru
ary 1957 the Soviet Union post
poned its aid promises to Yugo
slavia. Relations between the two
Communist states were strained
anew, though they improved
slightly in the succeeding months.
in August 1957 Tito and Khru
shchev met in Rumania. There
they made statements suggesting
a rapprochement and dropped
their quarrel over Hungary. The
Soviet leaders promised to carry
out the economic aid they had ear
lier offered to Yugoslavia, and the
latter in turn recognized East
Germany.
The newly effected cordiality
was ephemeral. Soviet leaders re
alized that, while Tito was willing
to cooperate with ihem, he would

never become subservient. More
over, they became alarmed over
his growing influence, especially
in Poland, and they decided to
make one last effort to harness
Tito.
On the occasion of the 40th an
niversary of the Bolshevik Revo
lution, in November 1957, the Yu
goslav delegates at the Moscow
celebration surprised their hosts
by refusing to endorse a Soviet
declaration on the world situation,
and a statement of 12 Communist
parties then lambasted Tito and
his alleged revisionism as the
main dangers to world Commu
nism.
Khrushchev and Tito were final
ly convinced there could be no
compromise between the Yugo
slav concept of socialism and the
Soviet idea of "a unitarian camp
of socialism." The Soviet Union
sent only observers to the seventh
Yugoslav Party Congress, last
April, and on that occasion both
sides tooJ< opportunity to con
demn each other's actions and
forms of socialism.
Unabated Campaign
Since then the Soviet campaign
against Yugoslavia has gone on
unabated. Yugoslavia remains ob
viously a great embarrassment
and serious obstacle to Soviet for
eign policy.
The Soviet Union once again
suspended the aid it promised to
Yugoslavia, and last June it exe
cuted Nagy, who was leader of
the tragic Hungarian revolution
of October 1956.
Whatever the reasons, Mao Tse
tung, hitherto relatively silent, in
May of this year joined the Soviet
leaders in vigorous condemnation
of Tito.
It appears, therefore, that Yu
goslavia and the Soviet-bloc coun
tries are drifting further and fur

ther apart. While the Soviet Un
ion had to contend in 1948 with
what amounted to the insubordi
nation of the Yugoslav leaders, in
1958 it is confronted with a de
veloped ideological system and a
brand-new socialist theory.
Keep Independence
Barring unpredictable develop
ments —always possible in this
rapidly changing world it seems
almost certain that whatever ac
commodations Yugoslavia may
reach with other Communist coun
tries, it will not surrender its own
independence. Tito's policy as re
gards the Soviet Union has popu
lar support and has paid off.
The hate and distrust of the
Soviet Union in Yugoslavia are
genuine and profound.
Even if a great many Yugoslavs
complain about political and eco
nomic conditions in their own
country low wages and high
prices, favoritism, economic spec
ulation and black market, discrim
ination against nonconformists,
etc. they are convinced that the
situation would be far worse un
der the Soviet political aegis.
As to who betrayed socialism
Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union
that is an academic question.
Premier Tito's system is neither
consistently Marxist nor Bolshe
vik, nor a mixture of the two. It
is an improvisation, a combina
tion of certain socialistic princi
ples and some capitalistic prac
tices. It is a system in flux, being
constantly modified to meet new
challenges and correct past mis
takes.
One may call Ihe Yugoslav sys
tem Titoism, for Tito was pri
marily responsible for it; but,
whatever it is, it seems to work
in Yugoslavia, despite its many
inherent weaknesses and contra
dictions.

On the occasion of the 40th an
niversary of the Bolshevik Revo
lution, in November 1957, the Yu
goslav delegates at the Moscow
celebration surprised their hosts
by refusing to endorse a Soviet
declaration on the world situation,
and a statement of 12 Communist
parties then lambasted Tito and
his alleged revisionism as the
main dangers to world Commu
nism.
Khrushchev and Tito were final
ly convinced there could be no
compromise between the Yugo
slav concept of socialism and the
Soviet idea of "a unitarian camp
of socialism." The Soviet Union
sent only observers to the seventh
Yugoslav Party Congress, last
April, and on that occasion both
sides tooJ< opportunity to con
demn each other's actions and
forms of socialism.
Unabated Campaign
Since then the Soviet campaign
against Yugoslavia has gone on
unabated. Yugoslavia remains ob
viously a great embarrassment
and serious obstacle to Soviet for
eign policy.
The Soviet Union once again
suspended the aid it promised to
Yugoslavia, and last June it exe
cuted Nagy, who was leader of
the tragic Hungarian revolution
of October 1956.
Whatever the reasons, Mao Tse
tung, hitherto relatively silent, in
May of this year joined the Soviet
leaders in vigorous condemnation
of Tito.
It appears, therefore, that Yu
goslavia and the Soviet-bloc coun
tries are drifting further and fur

ther apart. While the Soviet Un
ion had to contend in 1948 with
what amounted to the insubordi
nation of the Yugoslav leaders, in
1958 it is confronted with a de
veloped ideological system and a
brand-new socialist theory.
Keep Independence
Barring unpredictable develop
ments —always possible in this
rapidly changing world it seems
almost certain that whatever ac
commodations Yugoslavia may
reach with other Communist coun
tries, it will not surrender its own
independence. Tito's policy as re
gards the Soviet Union has popu
lar support and has paid off.
The hate and distrust of the
Soviet Union in Yugoslavia are
genuine and profound.
Even if a great many Yugoslavs
complain about political and eco
nomic conditions in their own
country low wages and high
prices, favoritism, economic spec
ulation and black market, discrim
ination against nonconformists,
etc. they are convinced that the
situation would be far worse un
der the Soviet political aegis.
As to who betrayed socialism
Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union
that is an academic question.
Premier Tito's system is neither
consistently Marxist nor Bolshe
vik, nor a mixture of the two. It
is an improvisation, a combina
tion of certain socialistic princi
ples and some capitalistic prac
tices. It is a system in flux, being
constantly modified to meet new
challenges and correct past mis
takes.
One may call Ihe Yugoslav sys
tem Titoism, for Tito was pri
marily responsible for it; but,
whatever it is, it seems to work
in Yugoslavia, despite its many
inherent weaknesses and contra
dictions.
