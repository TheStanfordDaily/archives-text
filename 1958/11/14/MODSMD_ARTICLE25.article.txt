One of the biggest differences
in academic life between Stan
ford and Aberdeen University,
said Nicol Sands, Scotch exchange
student, is that there we have no
midterm examinations: one
passes or fails on the final exami
nation alone.
"Socially, I think that Aberdeen
and Stanford are about equal,
only at Aberdeen the Student Un
ion is the social center while here
it is the fraternity, hall or eating
club," continued Sands.
Sands is a graduate student in
history and politics and he feels
that Anglo - American relations
could be much better.
"If more people of the caliber
I've met at Stanford visited Brit
ain, it would help our relations.
Many British people have a stere
otyped picture of Americans as
brash, loud-talking and gullible."
On integration: "The white of
fenders in the London race riots
were severely and swiftly pun
ished," said Sands, "and I think
that this has restrained the
trouble in Great Britain."
