# Indian War Cry: Dam Those Beavers!
## Last Card Win Three Years Ago 
### Russ Allen 
On Saturday Stanford gridders
go out to break a two-game los
ing streak with a win against the
Oregon State Beavers. Coach
Jack Curtice gets a chance to be
the first Indian mentor to solve
the Beavers' single • wing attack
and beat them because Coach
Tommy Prothro has never lost to
the Indians in his three years at
the OSC helm.
Last year OSC tailback Joe
Francis set all kinds of Beaver
offensive records in leading the
orange and black to an impressive
24-14 win over the Cards in Cor
vallis. Francis whipped off 274
yards against the Tribe with 9 for
10 pass completions; but he has
graduated and won't be wearing
the orange and black this year.
Quarterback Bob Nicolet will
lead the Cardinals into play to
morrow, hoping to use his pin
point passing to produce a win.
Besides Nicolet, left end Jim
Ukropina and guard Russ Steele
are changes in the Tribe lineup.
Card Lineup
The remaining Card lineup in
cludes: Chris Burford, at the oth
er end; Troy Barbee and Eric
Protiva, tackles; Bob Peterson,
guard; Doug Pursell, center; Jim
Byrer and Dick Bowers, half
backs; and Doug Dick, fullback.
Although the Beavers have won
in recent years, Stanford is on
top of the overall series with an
18-7-2 record.
So far this season the Beavers
stand at 4 and 2, in second place
in the PCC. For a while they |
were in first place, but last week
end's loss to WSC in Pullman,
coupled with Cal's win over UC
LA, pushed the Beavers out of
first into second.
Tough Task
OSC must win all its remain
ing games to stand a chance of
going to Pasadena for the Rose
Bowl next New Year's Day.
Coach Prothro has said that the
Beaver 14-8 victory over the Bears i
took all the fight out of his boys !
and he doubted if they would win
any more games. The Beavers j
dropped a thriller to the Cougars
last weekend but the team has a
great desire to play in the holiday j
clash and will be up to win its
last two games.
Card Assistant Coach Andy Ev- [
erest, who scouted the Beavers,
especially commended the Oregon
State defense. Their top standing !
in pass defense (a change over
last year's play) and their rush
defense is again near the top in
PCC standings.
Everest mentioned that the
Beavers are a strong, slow and
deliberate team with a lot of top
notch veterans. He did say that

the Halloweenmen's losses were
probably due to injuries to these
key veterans (tackle Ted Bates,
guard Jim Brackins, fullback Nub
Beamer) but if they are in full
strength tomorrow, they will be
tough.
The Indians' record is a little
darker as they have a 2-3 and a
sixth-place position in the Coast
race for the Rose Bowl.
Back in '56
Stanford football fans will espe
cially remember one OSC clash.
This left the Tribe on the short
end of a 20-19 score but most Card
followers will agree that it was
one of the most thrilling games

Tough Task
OSC must win all its remain
ing games to stand a chance of
going to Pasadena for the Rose
Bowl next New Year's Day.
Coach Prothro has said that the
Beaver 14-8 victory over the Bears i
took all the fight out of his boys !
and he doubted if they would win
any more games. The Beavers j
dropped a thriller to the Cougars
last weekend but the team has a
great desire to play in the holiday j
clash and will be up to win its
last two games.
Card Assistant Coach Andy Ev- [
erest, who scouted the Beavers,
especially commended the Oregon
State defense. Their top standing !
in pass defense (a change over
last year's play) and their rush
defense is again near the top in
PCC standings.
Everest mentioned that the
Beavers are a strong, slow and
deliberate team with a lot of top
notch veterans. He did say that

the Halloweenmen's losses were
probably due to injuries to these
key veterans (tackle Ted Bates,
guard Jim Brackins, fullback Nub
Beamer) but if they are in full
strength tomorrow, they will be
tough.
The Indians' record is a little
darker as they have a 2-3 and a
sixth-place position in the Coast
race for the Rose Bowl.
Back in '56
Stanford football fans will espe
cially remember one OSC clash.
This left the Tribe on the short
end of a 20-19 score but most Card
followers will agree that it was
one of the most thrilling games

On Saturday Stanford gridders
go out to break a two-game los
ing streak with a win against the
Oregon State Beavers. Coach
Jack Curtice gets a chance to be
the first Indian mentor to solve
the Beavers' single • wing attack
and beat them because Coach
Tommy Prothro has never lost to
the Indians in his three years at
the OSC helm.
Last year OSC tailback Joe
Francis set all kinds of Beaver
offensive records in leading the
orange and black to an impressive
24-14 win over the Cards in Cor
vallis. Francis whipped off 274
yards against the Tribe with 9 for
10 pass completions; but he has
graduated and won't be wearing
the orange and black this year.
Quarterback Bob Nicolet will
lead the Cardinals into play to
morrow, hoping to use his pin
point passing to produce a win.
Besides Nicolet, left end Jim
Ukropina and guard Russ Steele
are changes in the Tribe lineup.
Card Lineup
The remaining Card lineup in
cludes: Chris Burford, at the oth
er end; Troy Barbee and Eric
Protiva, tackles; Bob Peterson,
guard; Doug Pursell, center; Jim
Byrer and Dick Bowers, half
backs; and Doug Dick, fullback.
Although the Beavers have won
in recent years, Stanford is on
top of the overall series with an
18-7-2 record.
So far this season the Beavers
stand at 4 and 2, in second place
in the PCC. For a while they |
were in first place, but last week
end's loss to WSC in Pullman,
coupled with Cal's win over UC
LA, pushed the Beavers out of
first into second.
