### Steve Baffrey 
Ifs About That Time
Nominations aren't really in order, but it's about time to make a
few anyway. All-Coast selectors and All-America coirnmittee for- 1959
please take note!
In the midst of a not especially happy season there really have
been some standout performances come from the Stanford Indian
line, and it is these boys we would like to push, and push hard, for
standout mention.
Starting for this year, and Ail-Coast mention (this writer just
doesn't see an All-American in our present midst), we nominate Troy
Barbee, Chris* Burf'ord and Boh Peterson.
Barbee, of the three, probably has the best chance of making it. He
has had the necessary pie-season publicity, has had a fair season,
and should be on the list when il comes out.
Burford and Peterson, though, don't have the way paved as well,
l>ut these guys are tremendous ball players and deserve some post
season honors. Peterson is an aggressive guard, probably one of the
fastest men on the squad, and will be long remembered after* some
of his performances this year, especially I hose of the Washington
and UCLA games.
Burford, too, has had a good year. In fact lie's having the best
year ol any end on the Coast; witness the fact that he leads the PCC
reception department with 34 grabs, nine better than runner-up Boh
Dehlinger of Idaho. II Burford doesn't make All-Coast this writer is

going on a private investigation.
Burford arid Peterson do stand
a good chance, I hough, mainly on
Ihe strength of their Southland
games. Burlord picked up a spe
cial write up after the Indians' 21-
19 victory down there, and this is
an important "in." Peterson,
though, has probably not had all
thu publicity lie deserves. Sports
writers have a tendency to over
look interior linemen.
So much for All-Coast, 1958.
Now let's look ahead to the "next
year" part of "wait till next year."
Stanford may find itself with a
wealth of All-Something-or-Other
on its hands, and this writer often
has "oh, to be sports editor then"
yearnings. It's fun to write about
"All-s."
When the 1959 season gets un
der way you might look ahead
toward seeing center Doug Pur
sell, Chris Burford and fullback
<Â«il Dowd, along with halfback
Kick McMillen and quite possibly
halfback Skip Face on these lists.

But this sounds like a publicity director running down his team's
roster, so we'll go back a few paces and start this over with reasons
and reservations.
Burford, if he stays in high gear and Ihc Indians do well against
Wisconsin, will be a natural for All-American possibilities. But I'll
go along with fellow columnist Bob Payne's- "law" that an Eastern
press notice is an essential.
Pursell has gone almost unmentioned this season but this boy is
1o be feared especially if you're an opposing runner. He's tough,
fast and noteworthy, and 1959 should be his best year.
Dowd, McMillen and Face are potentials. They'll all have to de
velop the potential they've shown this year in order to take in the
honors, but still, they're possibilities.
112 Sis I Thai's Next Year
Bui this is next year; so why write of them now? There are two
games left this season, one here, and the other so close it mighl as
well be considered a home game, and there's lots of chance to watch
these guys go at it in them.
For those that think we're talking through that hole in the top
of our rooter's cap we suggest you take a look. And we suggest
it to you because it's been just a little short of exciting to watch
these guys come along this year while thinking of what the story
might be in '59.
But enough of this, and on to a few other things, mainly compli
ments.
This writer has an open heart when it comes to complimenting
behind-the-scenes personnel, especially when they make you look
good, read well, sound well, or something like that.
This time I mean the fellows who run the Stanford statistics ma
chines in the Stadium. A crew of seven, headed up by John Simmons,
works at every home game to provide the working press with sta
tistical accounts of all Stanford games.
While interesting, this is pretty grueling work at times, especially
at Stanford. Sports Publicist Don Liebendorfer notes that it is so
here in particular. In most stadia, Don points out, the statisticians
have their own private booth, with nobody to bother them. Here they
sit in the midst of the wolf pack with everybody howling at them
for this information or that information. And yet Ihey remain effi
cient.
Simmons' crew is composed of Dick Brannon, Rich Guggenhime,
Mel Hertzel, Hill Nichols, John Parker and Larry Shepp.
The service they provide is composed of quarter-by-quarter play
by-play accounts of the game, halftime statistics, full game team
and individual statistics, scoring summaries, lineups and varied other
answers to varied other questions.
Stanford's Most Loyal Fan
Compliment N'o. 2 goes to Stanford's favorite (and only) Indian,
Prince Lightt'oot. For a long while this writer has felt that the Injun
goes too much unappreciated here in the village, but try as hard
as I can it doesn't seem possible to arouse a little compliment for
him.
I.ightt'oot, otherwise known as Timm Williams, missed the plane
1o Eugene last week, but thought enough of the team and Stanford
to hop another one, this time on his own cash, mind you, in order
1o get to lluyward Field. This, if nothing else, is worthy of comment.
OPEN I.ETTFR TO DICK STANFORD So let's now Iry an or
ganized yell for him, if you don't mind. On second thought, make it
two. He doesn't particularly want it, but it's been a long time since
anybody's noticed him. Publicly at least! And if the card stunt
artist is looking for an extra one for Big Game I offer this as a good
idea.
