# LITTLE BIG GAME
## Papooses Host Rival Cal Frosh 
### Ron Rapoport 
"If you want to win, you will!"
Whoever uttered that classic must have been thinking of the Stan
ford freshman football team.
The spirit at the frosh camp, where they play their final game this
Saturday against the Cal freshmen, is high.

The question in everybody's
mind is not "Will we win?" but
"By how much?"
This week the practice sessions
have been spent in polishing up
plays and maybe whipping up a
surprise or two for Cal, which in
vades Stanford Stadium at 10:45
a.m. Saturday for the annual Lit
tle Big Game.
Happy Thoughts
Since they beat the UCLA frosh
last week end, Papoose coach Ho
mer Smith has had plenty of good
things to say about certain of his
players and about the play of the
team in general.
Bill Kuhn and Stan Lindskog,
who have been switched from full
back to wingback and vice versa,
respectively, both performed ad
mirably in the Uclan contest, with
Lindskog claiming top running
honors, averaging well over five
yards per carry.
Smith said the defense was the
key to that victory. Since Stan
ford intercepted six Brubabe pass
es, this may qualify for the under
statement of the week.
Surprise Discovery
Also pleasing to the frosh coach
ing staff Is the surprise discovery
of a certain amount of depth on
the line and in the backfield spots.
"We are two deep at every posi
tion," said Smith. "Everybody we
took to Los Angeles played a lot."
Smith said Toby Hecker, John
Schoettler and Bob Muller did
goorl jobs receiving Bob Price's
and Jim Smith's passes in L.A.
A sort of blow was received dur
ing the week when lineman Bob

Oakberg suffered a badly sprain
ed ankle in a practice session and
looked as though he might not see
action Saturday. However, he has
been working out and should see
limited action in the game.
Coach Smith said this injury
would hurt the Papoose depih but
that their strength would not be
reduced.
About California's frosh, Smith
said they have great hustle and
spirit. "They beat SC passing,"
he observed. "We know they'll
complete passes.
< al Leaders
Halfback Bill Wills from Michi
gan, quarterback Dennis Shay of
San Francisco and halfback Kuss
Boemke will lead the Cal year
lings into Stanford.
As a parting shot. Coach Smith
said Stanford partisans might do
well to watch Cary Craig in this
week's tussle.
"He may well be the breakaway
for," said Smith. "We're pretty
sure that he's the fastest runner
in school. Breakaway running is
a state of mind, and Craig has it.
He wants toâ€”and knows he can
get loose."
