# W. Berliners Demonstrate Against Reds
## 
### 
BERLIN (/P)â€”More than 3000
angry West Berliners laid siege
to a Communist Party rally
Thursday night shouting, "Get
out, Communists."
The demonstrators broke win
dows and smashed against the
doors of the historic Sports-Palast
in the heart of this occupied city
as East German Red leaders
echoed Soviet demands for Allied
troops to leave West Berlin. Sym
pathetic police finally channeled
the attackers into side streets.
Inside the big building where
Josef Goebbels and other Nazi
leaders once made rabble-rousing
speeches, 6500 Reds had gathered
with police permission for a cam
paign meeting in West Berlin's
parliamentary meeting in West
Berlin's parliamentary elections
Dec. 7. The reds never have won
a single scat in the 132% member
body.
To insure a so-ealled successful
meeting, the Reds carefully im
ported most of their audience
from East Berlin.
In Washington, the State De
partment sharply reminded the
Soviet Union that the Commu
nists failed the last time they
tried to blockade Berlin in 1948-
49. Furthermore, the United
States, Britain and France are in
Berlin by right of conquest,
Washington emphasized.
