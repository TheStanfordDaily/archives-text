## Huskies Are Next for Cal 
### 
Glory - starved California foot
ball fans will be on pins and nee
dles this week end as Iheir sturdy
Golden Bears go north to the Uni
versity of Washington to see if
they can hang onto their slim lead
in the Pacific Coast Conference
Rose Bowl race.
Two of Cal's closest pursuers,
Washington State and Southern
California, will have to stand by
and watch: the Cougars face Col
lege of the Pacific in a non-con
ference game, while the Trojans
take a week off. The third Cal
threatener, Oregon State, meets
Stanford.
In other action, Oregon and
UCLA tangle in Los Angeles in a
clash of two out*of-the-race teams,
and Idaho closes its season meet
ing Utah State.
With a slim, half-game lead on
the rest of the pack, California
must top two second-division clubs
to grab its first PCC crown since
1950. But in Washington they are
meeting an ever - dangerous foe
which has shown definite upset-;
ting tendencies over the past few '
•seasons.
Cal will be back at almost full j
strength with the return of half
back Hank Olguin and fullback
Bill Pali on. But, from perform
ances against UCLA last week,
Grover Garvin and Walt Arnold
may be reluctant to give up their
inherited starting positions.
WSC will be looking at a fairly
exciting runner when it journeys
to Stockton to meet "College of
Dick Bass," or College of the Pa

cific. The Cougar defense, which
has looked more imposing every
week, will have its hands full
stopping Bass, the nation's lead
ing rusher.
But COP, which has shown a
definite weakness in defending
against passes, will have just as
much a defensive assignnent in
stopping the Cougar aerial bom
bardment.
In L.A. the only two Pasadena

ineligibles, Oregon and UCLA,
clash. But ihey are out of the
race anyway. Oregon broke out
of a three-game slump last week
against Stanford, and UCLA is
currently suffering from a three
game losing streak of its own.
The Bruins, however, almost pull
ed a major up.s-et last week with
an inspired performance against
Cal, losing 20 to 17.

Two of Cal's closest pursuers,
Washington State and Southern
California, will have to stand by
and watch: the Cougars face Col
lege of the Pacific in a non-con
ference game, while the Trojans
take a week off. The third Cal
threatener, Oregon State, meets
Stanford.
In other action, Oregon and
UCLA tangle in Los Angeles in a
clash of two out*of-the-race teams,
and Idaho closes its season meet
ing Utah State.
With a slim, half-game lead on
the rest of the pack, California
must top two second-division clubs
to grab its first PCC crown since
1950. But in Washington they are
meeting an ever - dangerous foe
which has shown definite upset-;
ting tendencies over the past few '
•seasons.
Cal will be back at almost full j
strength with the return of half
back Hank Olguin and fullback
Bill Pali on. But, from perform
ances against UCLA last week,
Grover Garvin and Walt Arnold
may be reluctant to give up their
inherited starting positions.
WSC will be looking at a fairly
exciting runner when it journeys
to Stockton to meet "College of
Dick Bass," or College of the Pa

cific. The Cougar defense, which
has looked more imposing every
week, will have its hands full
stopping Bass, the nation's lead
ing rusher.
But COP, which has shown a
definite weakness in defending
against passes, will have just as
much a defensive assignnent in
stopping the Cougar aerial bom
bardment.
In L.A. the only two Pasadena

ineligibles, Oregon and UCLA,
clash. But ihey are out of the
race anyway. Oregon broke out
of a three-game slump last week
against Stanford, and UCLA is
currently suffering from a three
game losing streak of its own.
The Bruins, however, almost pull
ed a major up.s-et last week with
an inspired performance against
Cal, losing 20 to 17.
Glory - starved California foot
ball fans will be on pins and nee
dles this week end as Iheir sturdy
Golden Bears go north to the Uni
versity of Washington to see if
they can hang onto their slim lead
in the Pacific Coast Conference
Rose Bowl race.
