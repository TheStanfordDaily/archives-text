# Harriers in San Jose 'All Comers'
## 
### 
Stanford will renew its cross
country feud with California to
day at 4 p.m. when both schools
participate in the annual San Jose
State all-comers meet on the Spar
tan course.
The Indians, Bears, Spartans,
College of Pacific and most other
cross-country teams from the
northern California area are ex
pected to compete.
Co-captains Keith Wallace and
Doug Martin rank as strong
threats for a one-two finish from
their showings at Berkeley last
Saturday.
John Northway, Bob Monzingo,
A 1 Ahumada and Kim Maxwell
will comprise the rest of the Stan
ford entry.
The Cards will lie seeking their
second win in a row over the
Bears. Cal won the first engage
ment, but Stanford won last week.
The teams will meet again next
Wednesday in a dual meet and on
Nov. 29 in the Pacific Coast Con
ference championship meet here.
Sophomore Wallace, who breez
ed a 9:12 two-mile in n workout
last Tuesday, has looked better
with each outing. He ranks sec
ond only to Max Truex of IJSC in
state cross-country circles.
Martin has been probably the
most improved runner of the fall.
