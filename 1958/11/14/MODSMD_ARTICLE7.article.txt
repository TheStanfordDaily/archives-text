UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (A 3 )â€”
The United States appealed
Thursday for speedy U.N. action
in promoting international co-op
eration on peaceful uses of outer
space in order to block suicidal
national rivalries.
U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge told Ihe 81 -nation Political
Committee the world faced this
choice: either to use outer space
as a means for international col
laboration or "to destroy our
selves through extension of na
tional rivalries" into man's new
est dimension.
He proposed creation of a nine
nation committee. It would make
a far-ranging study of peaceful
uses of outer space and report
back to Ihe next General Assem
bly.
This was in line with a resolu
tion introduced by the United
States and 19 other nations as a
rival to a Soviet resolution.
The Russians urged the UN to
recommend a ban on use of outer
space for military purposes, and
elimination of overseas military
bases such the United States has
in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.
The Russians seek establish
ment of a UN agency for inter
national co-operation in the study
of outer space instead of a special
committee.
The U.S.-backed resolution pro
posed no ban on outer space mili
tary weapons.
