# World Position Perilous; Attlee Calls for Peace
## Briton Speaks To Full House 
### Jack Clumeck Cally Tanner 
"I have never known the world
to be in such a dangerous posi
tion. . . . The future will depend
on people like you all over the
world - appreciating their posi
tion and making their voices
hoard in the call for world peace
and world order."
This was the keystone state
ment of Earl Clement Attlee in
his speech, "The Future of Eu
rope," presented Thursday after
noon to a capacity Memorial Au
ditorium audience.
After his introduction hy Dr.
Thomas Bailey of the History De
partment, Earl Attlee toid the as
semblage he was "not a prophet
or an expert, but | rather 1 an ordi
nary politicianâ€”some would say
'statesman.' "
No Suicide
Basing his talk on the working
assumption that "the world won't
commit suicide with hydrogen
bombs," Attlee described the pres
ent world situation as "an ideo
logical contest between the totali
tarian powers and the democra
cies."
Because of the great diversity
in the traditions of the European
countries, Earl At lee maintained
that a unified Europe is not a
very likely prospect. "While wo
believe in the principle of loving
our neighbors," he said, "it is not
always the next-door neighbor
that one loves."
Neither is a federation of Eu
rope a desirable prospect to most
Europeans. "We don't want to sit
back and be treated as an agod
and respectable relative by the
young powers who don't want
them either," he said.
Attlee concluded his argument
against the possibility of a united
Europe by recalling an adage
learned in his school days: "Hap
py is the nation that has no his
tory." He then added his own
opinion: "Happy are the people
who can forget their history." as
related to the bitter feelings which
the two world wars have left in
Europe.
Sovereignty
Describing the relationship be
tween individual sovereignty and
the prospect for world peace, Att
lee said, "The individual surren
ders some of his rights .. . for the
greater freedom of all people."
The United Nations "set up a
rule of law in the world, instead
of a rule of force; . . . today we
must go a great deal further than
we did in San Francisco in 1945.
Attlee advocated "an internation
al force, to be drawn from various
nations and devoted to the cause
of peace."
The statesman concluded that
"unless we can move to a world
under a rule of law, accepted and
enforced, we may very well go
down in world chaos and war."
At a morning press conference
at Hoover Institution, Earl Attlee
was questioned by representatives
of local newspapers and was film
ed by two San Francisco television
stations' cameras.
