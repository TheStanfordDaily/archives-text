# Cal Begins Big Game Week
## 
### Bonnie Culhane 
The Red purge has reached the
Cal campus. Victims arc being
arrested from the top of the Cam
panile to Sather Gate. Eshleman
Court is crowded with suspects.
It is dangerous to venture outside.
The victims of the purge arc
being sentenced on the spot by
the kangaroo court. All sorts of
cruel and unusual punishments
have been devised to harass the
innocent students.
The judges, members of Alpha
Phi Omega, the service fraternity,
are demanding everything from
rolling a peanut across Eshleman
Court with the nose, to dancing
the hula, to playing a game of
baseball with raw eggs.
The penalties arc out of propor
tion to the trivial crimes. Wear
ing red clothing or lipstick, carry
ing red books, or having red hair
can class one as a Red offender.
This is Blue Monday.
Cal's Big Game Week activities
were launched last Friday with
the crowning of the Homecoming
Queen, one of Cal's rare beauties.
Also held Friday night was the
annual Axe Revue, a show which
is sometimes shamefully compar
ed to our Gaieties. It was com
posed of skits by various living
groups and included, as usual,
original lyrics and borrowed
music.
To continue the week of festivi
ties. Cal Tjader will be featured
at the annual Jazz Concert Thurs
day afternoon. Also on Thursday
will be the final judging of the
house and lawn decorations, which
this year are centered around the
clever (for Call theme of "Cal
boys and Indians."


"BLUE MONDAY" AT CAL SEES UNFORTUNATE PENALTIES FOR WEARING RED
But Indians wear Red and White Tuesday without compulsion
Then on Friday night Dig Game
Rally will he held in the Greek
Theatre. It should be the biggest
thing since Billy Graham appear
ed there last spring. Entertain
ment. will be provided by Bay
Area performers, and the Straw-
Hat Band and Oski will be on
hand.
Highlight of the rally will be
the reading of "The Eulogy to
Andy Smith," which will be ac
companied by a candle - lighting
ceremony.
Andy Smith coached the famous
Cal "wonder teams" of the 1920'5.
When Andy died his body was cre
mated, and, according to his own
request, the ashes were scattered
over the Cal Memorial Stadium.
The story runs that each year
during the reading of Ihe eulogy
a ghostly figure paces before the
Cal bench, urging the team on to
victory.
Following the rally will be an
all-campus dance, but probably
many Cal men and women will
feel called upon to attend Stan
ford's Friday night rally.
The over-all theme for Cal Big
Game Week is the oh • so - clever
"C-ing the Golden West." But one
must not criticize or make fun of
this attempt at originality. It rep
resents a definite improvement
over last year when Cal lifted
bodily the Stanford theme of 1956.

victory.
Following the rally will be an
all-campus dance, but probably
many Cal men and women will
feel called upon to attend Stan
ford's Friday night rally.
The over-all theme for Cal Big
Game Week is the oh • so - clever
"C-ing the Golden West." But one
must not criticize or make fun of
this attempt at originality. It rep
resents a definite improvement
over last year when Cal lifted
bodily the Stanford theme of 1956.
"Victory at C."
The Red purge has reached the
Cal campus. Victims arc being
arrested from the top of the Cam
panile to Sather Gate. Eshleman
Court is crowded with suspects.
It is dangerous to venture outside.
The victims of the purge arc
being sentenced on the spot by
the kangaroo court. All sorts of
cruel and unusual punishments
have been devised to harass the
innocent students.
The judges, members of Alpha
Phi Omega, the service fraternity,
are demanding everything from
rolling a peanut across Eshleman
Court with the nose, to dancing
the hula, to playing a game of
baseball with raw eggs.
The penalties arc out of propor
tion to the trivial crimes. Wear
ing red clothing or lipstick, carry
ing red books, or having red hair
can class one as a Red offender.
This is Blue Monday.
Cal's Big Game Week activities
were launched last Friday with
the crowning of the Homecoming
Queen, one of Cal's rare beauties.
Also held Friday night was the
annual Axe Revue, a show which
is sometimes shamefully compar
ed to our Gaieties. It was com
posed of skits by various living
groups and included, as usual,
original lyrics and borrowed
music.
To continue the week of festivi
ties. Cal Tjader will be featured
at the annual Jazz Concert Thurs
day afternoon. Also on Thursday
will be the final judging of the
house and lawn decorations, which
this year are centered around the
clever (for Call theme of "Cal
boys and Indians."


"BLUE MONDAY" AT CAL SEES UNFORTUNATE PENALTIES FOR WEARING RED
But Indians wear Red and White Tuesday without compulsion
Then on Friday night Dig Game
Rally will he held in the Greek
Theatre. It should be the biggest
thing since Billy Graham appear
ed there last spring. Entertain
ment. will be provided by Bay
Area performers, and the Straw-
Hat Band and Oski will be on
hand.
Highlight of the rally will be
the reading of "The Eulogy to
Andy Smith," which will be ac
companied by a candle - lighting
ceremony.
Andy Smith coached the famous
Cal "wonder teams" of the 1920'5.
When Andy died his body was cre
mated, and, according to his own
request, the ashes were scattered
over the Cal Memorial Stadium.
The story runs that each year
during the reading of Ihe eulogy
a ghostly figure paces before the
Cal bench, urging the team on to
victory.
