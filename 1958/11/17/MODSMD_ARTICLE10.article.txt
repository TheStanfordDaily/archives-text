# Cal Begins Big Game Week
## 
### Bonnie Culhane 
The Red purge has reached the
Cal campus. Victims arc being
arrested from the top of the Cam
panile to Sather Gate. Eshleman
Court is crowded with suspects.
It is dangerous to venture outside.
The victims of the purge arc
being sentenced on the spot by
the kangaroo court. All sorts of
cruel and unusual punishments
have been devised to harass the
innocent students.
The judges, members of Alpha
Phi Omega, the service fraternity,
are demanding everything from
rolling a peanut across Eshleman
Court with the nose, to dancing
the hula, to playing a game of
baseball with raw eggs.
The penalties arc out of propor
tion to the trivial crimes. Wear
ing red clothing or lipstick, carry
ing red books, or having red hair
can class one as a Red offender.
This is Blue Monday.
Cal's Big Game Week activities
were launched last Friday with
the crowning of the Homecoming
Queen, one of Cal's rare beauties.
Also held Friday night was the
annual Axe Revue, a show which
is sometimes shamefully compar
ed to our Gaieties. It was com
posed of skits by various living
groups and included, as usual,
original lyrics and borrowed
music.
To continue the week of festivi
ties. Cal Tjader will be featured
at the annual Jazz Concert Thurs
day afternoon. Also on Thursday
will be the final judging of the
house and lawn decorations, which
this year are centered around the
clever (for Call theme of "Cal
boys and Indians."
