### Doug Willis 
Close to 3500 persons at Berke
ley High Sehool auditorium Sat
urday evening heard the Tung
sten Trio sing "Hang Down Your
Head Jack Curtice" in the "Axe
Revue," the University of Califor
nia's imitation of Big Game Gaie
ties.
In one of 13 presentations in
the Revue, (lie Tungsten Trio ex
plained to Jack Curl ice that "poor
boy, you're going to goof," and
that this time tomorrow you will
he "somewhere in Palo Alto,
hanging from a cypress tree."
The Axe Revue, a competitive
show between Cal living groups,
showed little co-ordination be
tween acts with only a fow, well
spac c d , outstanding perform
ances.
A twisted parody of the "Mu
sic Man" featuring the song,
"Trouble, Right Here in Palo
Alto," was a rare bright number.
Another high spot of ihe evening
was Â» rendition of "You Make
Me Feel So Young" by a seven
man singing group known as the
Senior Men's Octette.
Continuing the chop at Stan
ford theme was a South Pacific
parody, with an orange - haired
coed singing "I'm Gonig to Wash
That Red Right Out of My Hair."
Only the consistently humorous
antics of Masters of Ceremonies
Morrie Bobrow and Hal Goldstein
saved much of the show. The im
ported talent of Diane Berman,
recently from the road company
of "Guys and Dolls," also added
interest.
