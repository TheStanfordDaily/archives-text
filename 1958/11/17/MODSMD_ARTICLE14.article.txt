# Beavers Overcome Tie; Master Stanford, 24-16
## Dick Norman Stars at QB 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford turned Dick Norman
loose on the Oregon State Bea
vers Saturday, but it wasn't quite
enough and it ended up a disap
pointing 24-16 loss for the Cards.
For the first time this year, the
Tribe looked great in losing. Nor
man's passing antics were as fine
as any seen in Stanford Stadium
for years . . . and that is quite
an order, considering the recent
Indian quarterbacks.
Defensively, a few lapses of pa
thetic tackling proved disastrous
for the Tribe, but in the overall
picture it was an excellent effort.
Reamer Crushes
Nub Beamer, a plowing senior
fullback, applied the crushers to
the Indians. It was his amazing
44-yard blast through center and
a two-yard conversion blast in the
first period that got the Beavers
winging to an 8-0 lead.
On that one. every Card on the
field had a chance to stop Beam
er, and all they did was to slow
him up. And it was especially
disappointing to the Stanford fan
because up until that time the
Cards had completely stifled the
charges of the Orange single
wing and a holding penalty had
made the play a third-and-18 situ
ation.
Beamer was back in the final
period, lofting a beautiful 53-yard
pass to sophomore end Roger
Johnson, who was behind the
Tribe defense for an easy score.
That one did it.
Norman Great
But it was a great day for Dick
Norman as he suddenly forged
way out in front in the Card quar
terback derby. When things were
totaled up, Norman had complet
ed 21 of 31 passes for 236 yards
and one touchdown. And the Bea
vers knew they had been in a ball
game.
It started out none too rosy for
the Stanfords. The first time they
got the ball, Sid Garber scam
pered 10 yards for a first down
but Bob Nicolet fumbled on the
very next play and the first Bea
ver score was set up.
The futile tackling show on
Beamer's run rather put a damp
er on things, because it. had been
a good defensive effort by the
Cards to that point.
Remember Him?
After a double exchange of
punts and an interception, the Or
ange struck for its second score
and a 16-0 lead early in the second
period. This time it was Beamer,
and another OSC back that hadn't
been forgotten by many of the
local fans.
Starting at the Card 45, it took
five plays for the Beavers to
score. After an incomplete pass,
a wingback named Earnel Dur*
den scampered 18 yards with a
reverse to put OSC in touchdown
territory.
This is the fellow who had
helped kill Stanford on these very
same reverses two years ago at
the Stadium.
Enter Dick Norman, sopho
more, 6-3, 197 pounds, from Lyn
wood, Calif. A "third-stringer"
. . . but not unknown to Card fans
by any means, for he had had a
brilliant day passing against Rice
six weeks earlier.
The offense wasn't going as it.
was, so Coach Jack Curtice called
on Norman. He went right to
work. Starting from their own
