# Beavers Overcome Tie; Master Stanford, 24-16
## Dick Norman Stars at QB 
### Bob Payne 
Stanford turned Dick Norman
loose on the Oregon State Bea
vers Saturday, but it wasn't quite
enough and it ended up a disap
pointing 24-16 loss for the Cards.
For the first time this year, the
Tribe looked great in losing. Nor
man's passing antics were as fine
as any seen in Stanford Stadium
for years . . . and that is quite
an order, considering the recent
Indian quarterbacks.
Defensively, a few lapses of pa
thetic tackling proved disastrous
for the Tribe, but in the overall
picture it was an excellent effort.
Reamer Crushes
Nub Beamer, a plowing senior
fullback, applied the crushers to
the Indians. It was his amazing
44-yard blast through center and
a two-yard conversion blast in the
first period that got the Beavers
winging to an 8-0 lead.
On that one. every Card on the
field had a chance to stop Beam
er, and all they did was to slow
him up. And it was especially
disappointing to the Stanford fan
because up until that time the
Cards had completely stifled the
charges of the Orange single
wing and a holding penalty had
made the play a third-and-18 situ
ation.
Beamer was back in the final
period, lofting a beautiful 53-yard
pass to sophomore end Roger
Johnson, who was behind the
Tribe defense for an easy score.
That one did it.
Norman Great
But it was a great day for Dick
Norman as he suddenly forged
way out in front in the Card quar
terback derby. When things were
totaled up, Norman had complet
ed 21 of 31 passes for 236 yards
and one touchdown. And the Bea
vers knew they had been in a ball
game.
It started out none too rosy for
the Stanfords. The first time they
got the ball, Sid Garber scam
pered 10 yards for a first down
but Bob Nicolet fumbled on the
very next play and the first Bea
ver score was set up.
The futile tackling show on
Beamer's run rather put a damp
er on things, because it. had been
a good defensive effort by the
Cards to that point.
Remember Him?
After a double exchange of
punts and an interception, the Or
ange struck for its second score
and a 16-0 lead early in the second
period. This time it was Beamer,
and another OSC back that hadn't
been forgotten by many of the
local fans.
Starting at the Card 45, it took
five plays for the Beavers to
score. After an incomplete pass,
a wingback named Earnel Dur*
den scampered 18 yards with a
reverse to put OSC in touchdown
territory.
This is the fellow who had
helped kill Stanford on these very
same reverses two years ago at
the Stadium.
Enter Dick Norman, sopho
more, 6-3, 197 pounds, from Lyn
wood, Calif. A "third-stringer"
. . . but not unknown to Card fans
by any means, for he had had a
brilliant day passing against Rice
six weeks earlier.
The offense wasn't going as it.
was, so Coach Jack Curtice called
on Norman. He went right to
work. Starting from their own

FULLBACK GIL I)0\VI) STOPPED INCHES SHORT OF TOUCHDOWN
Hill the Card tractor plowed over for the score on the next play
33, the Indians had eight points
in 15 plays.
After Gil Dowd had hit center
for three yards, N'orman struck
to Skip Face on a swing pass for
10 yards and a first down. Two
rushes netted only four yards and
Norman found Chris Burford for
another 10 and another lirsi down
. . . in Beaver territory.
Burford Scores
From then on, an occasional
run and passes of 10 yards to
Burford, 11 to lev Nikolai, three
to Joel Freis and one to Dick Bow
ers put the ball on the six. Then
Norman whipped one to Burford
for six yards and the score.
Here, Rick Me M ill en reap
peared on the scene for the first
time since the Air Force game I
and scooted around the right side
for the two-point conversion. Sol
the half ended.
Late in the third quarter, the;
Norman-directed Tribe tied it up. \
Tribe Tics Game
With a 14-yard pass to Burford
and a 19-yarder to Bowers the big i
gainers, the Cards moved 69 j
yards in 11 plays.
Norman's passes and a 13-yard j
scamper by Skip Face helped i
bring the ball to the Beaver 20-
yard line. /
Face turned end for six yards i
and Gil Dowd plowed over tackle
for 12 yards to ihe two. After a i
Dowd dive fell four inches short
of the goal, the sophomore plung
er drove the rest of the way on
the next play for the score. Face,
sprung by a fine block from Ron
Fernandes, outran the Beavers
for the tying conversion.
One Last Chance
There was one last chance for
Stanford, and it misfired, giving
the Beavers the triumph. Rarly
in the fourth quarter, Norman
found Irv Nikolai behind the OSC
defense and heading for TD land.
Nikolai got it on his fingertips
and was apaprently away for the j
go-ahead score, but the Beavers' j
swift Aaron Thomas pulled him
down from behind on the 10. The j
play had covered 63 yards.
While it hadn't scored, the

Cards wore close and they still
couldn't push it over. The threat
ended in a blocked Skip Faro
field goal try.
Oregon State seemed duly im
pressed by the beauty of the long
Norman-to-Nikolai strike, for the
Beavers had scarcely regained the
ball when Beainer made his pitch
to Johnson for the winning score.
It was the seventh loss in nine
games, but for once the Tribe
could really say they might have
won. Except for Norman, the
hero was the same as always, win
or lose: Burford, who shone on
defense and grabbed seven passes
to run his league - leading total
to 41. As is becoming customary,
he played GO minutes.

hero was the same as always, win
or lose: Burford, who shone on
defense and grabbed seven passes
to run his league - leading total
to 41. As is becoming customary,
he played GO minutes.
Stanford turned Dick Norman
loose on the Oregon State Bea
vers Saturday, but it wasn't quite
enough and it ended up a disap
pointing 24-16 loss for the Cards.
For the first time this year, the
Tribe looked great in losing. Nor
man's passing antics were as fine
as any seen in Stanford Stadium
for years . . . and that is quite
an order, considering the recent
Indian quarterbacks.
Defensively, a few lapses of pa
thetic tackling proved disastrous
for the Tribe, but in the overall
picture it was an excellent effort.
Reamer Crushes
Nub Beamer, a plowing senior
fullback, applied the crushers to
the Indians. It was his amazing
44-yard blast through center and
a two-yard conversion blast in the
first period that got the Beavers
winging to an 8-0 lead.
On that one. every Card on the
field had a chance to stop Beam
er, and all they did was to slow
him up. And it was especially
disappointing to the Stanford fan
because up until that time the
Cards had completely stifled the
charges of the Orange single
wing and a holding penalty had
made the play a third-and-18 situ
ation.
Beamer was back in the final
period, lofting a beautiful 53-yard
pass to sophomore end Roger
Johnson, who was behind the
Tribe defense for an easy score.
That one did it.
Norman Great
But it was a great day for Dick
Norman as he suddenly forged
way out in front in the Card quar
terback derby. When things were
totaled up, Norman had complet
ed 21 of 31 passes for 236 yards
and one touchdown. And the Bea
vers knew they had been in a ball
game.
It started out none too rosy for
the Stanfords. The first time they
got the ball, Sid Garber scam
pered 10 yards for a first down
but Bob Nicolet fumbled on the
very next play and the first Bea
ver score was set up.
The futile tackling show on
Beamer's run rather put a damp
er on things, because it. had been
a good defensive effort by the
Cards to that point.
Remember Him?
After a double exchange of
punts and an interception, the Or
ange struck for its second score
and a 16-0 lead early in the second
period. This time it was Beamer,
and another OSC back that hadn't
been forgotten by many of the
local fans.
Starting at the Card 45, it took
five plays for the Beavers to
score. After an incomplete pass,
a wingback named Earnel Dur*
den scampered 18 yards with a
reverse to put OSC in touchdown
territory.
This is the fellow who had
helped kill Stanford on these very
same reverses two years ago at
the Stadium.
Enter Dick Norman, sopho
more, 6-3, 197 pounds, from Lyn
wood, Calif. A "third-stringer"
. . . but not unknown to Card fans
by any means, for he had had a
brilliant day passing against Rice
six weeks earlier.
The offense wasn't going as it.

on Norman. He went right to
work. Starting from their own

From then on, an occasional

Norman whipped one to Burford
for six yards and the score.

There was one last chance for
Stanford, and it misfired, giving

found Irv Nikolai behind the OSC
defense and heading for TD land.

go-ahead score, but the Beavers' j
swift Aaron Thomas pulled him
down from behind on the 10. The j
play had covered 63 yards.

Cards wore close and they still
couldn't push it over. The threat
ended in a blocked Skip Faro
field goal try.
Oregon State seemed duly im
pressed by the beauty of the long
Norman-to-Nikolai strike, for the
Beavers had scarcely regained the
ball when Beainer made his pitch
to Johnson for the winning score.

to Johnson for the winning score.
It was the seventh loss in nine
games, but for once the Tribe
could really say they might have
won. Except for Norman, the
hero was the same as always, win
or lose: Burford, who shone on
defense and grabbed seven passes
to run his league - leading total
to 41. As is becoming customary,
he played GO minutes.
Stanford turned Dick Norman
loose on the Oregon State Bea
vers Saturday, but it wasn't quite
enough and it ended up a disap
pointing 24-16 loss for the Cards.
For the first time this year, the
Tribe looked great in losing. Nor
man's passing antics were as fine
as any seen in Stanford Stadium
for years . . . and that is quite
an order, considering the recent
Indian quarterbacks.
Defensively, a few lapses of pa
thetic tackling proved disastrous
for the Tribe, but in the overall
picture it was an excellent effort.
Reamer Crushes
Nub Beamer, a plowing senior
fullback, applied the crushers to
the Indians. It was his amazing
44-yard blast through center and
a two-yard conversion blast in the
first period that got the Beavers
winging to an 8-0 lead.
On that one. every Card on the
field had a chance to stop Beam
er, and all they did was to slow
him up. And it was especially
disappointing to the Stanford fan
because up until that time the
Cards had completely stifled the
charges of the Orange single
wing and a holding penalty had
made the play a third-and-18 situ
ation.
Beamer was back in the final
period, lofting a beautiful 53-yard
pass to sophomore end Roger
Johnson, who was behind the
Tribe defense for an easy score.
That one did it.
Norman Great
But it was a great day for Dick
Norman as he suddenly forged
way out in front in the Card quar
terback derby. When things were
totaled up, Norman had complet
ed 21 of 31 passes for 236 yards
and one touchdown. And the Bea
vers knew they had been in a ball
game.
It started out none too rosy for
the Stanfords. The first time they
got the ball, Sid Garber scam
pered 10 yards for a first down
but Bob Nicolet fumbled on the
very next play and the first Bea
ver score was set up.
The futile tackling show on
Beamer's run rather put a damp
er on things, because it. had been
a good defensive effort by the
Cards to that point.
Remember Him?
After a double exchange of
punts and an interception, the Or
ange struck for its second score
and a 16-0 lead early in the second
period. This time it was Beamer,
and another OSC back that hadn't
been forgotten by many of the
local fans.
Starting at the Card 45, it took
five plays for the Beavers to
score. After an incomplete pass,
a wingback named Earnel Dur*
den scampered 18 yards with a
reverse to put OSC in touchdown
territory.
This is the fellow who had
helped kill Stanford on these very
same reverses two years ago at
the Stadium.
Enter Dick Norman, sopho
more, 6-3, 197 pounds, from Lyn
wood, Calif. A "third-stringer"
. . . but not unknown to Card fans
by any means, for he had had a
brilliant day passing against Rice
six weeks earlier.
The offense wasn't going as it.

on Norman. He went right to
work. Starting from their own

There was one last chance for

pressed by the beauty of the long
Norman-to-Nikolai strike, for the
Beavers had scarcely regained the
ball when Beainer made his pitch
to Johnson for the winning score.
It was the seventh loss in nine
games, but for once the Tribe
could really say they might have
won. Except for Norman, the
hero was the same as always, win
or lose: Burford, who shone on
defense and grabbed seven passes
to run his league - leading total
to 41. As is becoming customary,
he played GO minutes.
Stanford turned Dick Norman
loose on the Oregon State Bea
vers Saturday, but it wasn't quite
enough and it ended up a disap
pointing 24-16 loss for the Cards.
For the first time this year, the
Tribe looked great in losing. Nor
man's passing antics were as fine
as any seen in Stanford Stadium
for years . . . and that is quite
an order, considering the recent
Indian quarterbacks.
Defensively, a few lapses of pa
thetic tackling proved disastrous
for the Tribe, but in the overall
picture it was an excellent effort.
Reamer Crushes
Nub Beamer, a plowing senior
fullback, applied the crushers to
the Indians. It was his amazing
44-yard blast through center and
a two-yard conversion blast in the
first period that got the Beavers
winging to an 8-0 lead.
On that one. every Card on the
field had a chance to stop Beam
er, and all they did was to slow
him up. And it was especially
disappointing to the Stanford fan
because up until that time the
Cards had completely stifled the
charges of the Orange single
wing and a holding penalty had
made the play a third-and-18 situ
ation.
Beamer was back in the final
period, lofting a beautiful 53-yard
pass to sophomore end Roger
Johnson, who was behind the
Tribe defense for an easy score.
That one did it.
Norman Great
But it was a great day for Dick
Norman as he suddenly forged
way out in front in the Card quar
terback derby. When things were
totaled up, Norman had complet
ed 21 of 31 passes for 236 yards
and one touchdown. And the Bea
vers knew they had been in a ball
game.
It started out none too rosy for
the Stanfords. The first time they
got the ball, Sid Garber scam
pered 10 yards for a first down
but Bob Nicolet fumbled on the
very next play and the first Bea
ver score was set up.
The futile tackling show on
Beamer's run rather put a damp
er on things, because it. had been
a good defensive effort by the
Cards to that point.
Remember Him?
After a double exchange of
punts and an interception, the Or
ange struck for its second score
and a 16-0 lead early in the second
period. This time it was Beamer,
and another OSC back that hadn't
been forgotten by many of the
local fans.
Starting at the Card 45, it took
five plays for the Beavers to
score. After an incomplete pass,
a wingback named Earnel Dur*
den scampered 18 yards with a
reverse to put OSC in touchdown
territory.
This is the fellow who had
helped kill Stanford on these very
same reverses two years ago at
the Stadium.
Enter Dick Norman, sopho
more, 6-3, 197 pounds, from Lyn
wood, Calif. A "third-stringer"
. . . but not unknown to Card fans
by any means, for he had had a
brilliant day passing against Rice
six weeks earlier.
The offense wasn't going as it.
was, so Coach Jack Curtice called
on Norman. He went right to
work. Starting from their own

FULLBACK GIL I)0\VI) STOPPED INCHES SHORT OF TOUCHDOWN
Hill the Card tractor plowed over for the score on the next play
33, the Indians had eight points
in 15 plays.
After Gil Dowd had hit center
for three yards, N'orman struck
to Skip Face on a swing pass for
10 yards and a first down. Two
rushes netted only four yards and
Norman found Chris Burford for
another 10 and another lirsi down
. . . in Beaver territory.
Burford Scores
From then on, an occasional
run and passes of 10 yards to
Burford, 11 to lev Nikolai, three
to Joel Freis and one to Dick Bow
ers put the ball on the six. Then
Norman whipped one to Burford
for six yards and the score.
Here, Rick Me M ill en reap
peared on the scene for the first
time since the Air Force game I
and scooted around the right side
for the two-point conversion. Sol
the half ended.
Late in the third quarter, the;
Norman-directed Tribe tied it up. \
Tribe Tics Game
With a 14-yard pass to Burford
and a 19-yarder to Bowers the big i
gainers, the Cards moved 69 j
yards in 11 plays.
Norman's passes and a 13-yard j
scamper by Skip Face helped i
bring the ball to the Beaver 20-
yard line. /
Face turned end for six yards i
and Gil Dowd plowed over tackle
for 12 yards to ihe two. After a i
Dowd dive fell four inches short
of the goal, the sophomore plung
er drove the rest of the way on
the next play for the score. Face,
sprung by a fine block from Ron
Fernandes, outran the Beavers
for the tying conversion.
One Last Chance
There was one last chance for
Stanford, and it misfired, giving
the Beavers the triumph. Rarly
in the fourth quarter, Norman
found Irv Nikolai behind the OSC
defense and heading for TD land.
Nikolai got it on his fingertips
and was apaprently away for the j
go-ahead score, but the Beavers' j
swift Aaron Thomas pulled him
down from behind on the 10. The j
play had covered 63 yards.
While it hadn't scored, the

Cards wore close and they still
couldn't push it over. The threat
ended in a blocked Skip Faro
field goal try.
