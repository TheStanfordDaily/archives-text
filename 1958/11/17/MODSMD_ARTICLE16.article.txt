We woi'i.D LIK.F. TO pass OUT some compliments for ideas and
actions we have seen around here lately. First of all for:
RIG BROTHER DAY
Twenty of the fraternities got together on Saturday and invited
more than a hundred kids for lunch, the Oregon State game and
a general good time. The kids were all from special Peninsula
schools for crippled or men tails retarded children, and the men
from the Row brought some variety and excitement into their
lives.
I he project was the inspiration of Craig Mooper, a Beta I lieta
Pi senior. 11c went to Interfraternity Council a month ago and
gold it a bundle of good-lellowship. I his sort of project, has heen
done by individual houses before, but we are glad to see that
fraternities as a group are joining in a worthwhile idea like this.
And, better vet, they are planning another, even bigger day
for underprivileged kids from San Francisco's Red Shield groups
sometime during their first Creek Week Feb. 2.*< 2tt. A basket
ball tournament and a dinner are planned, and Ihe Daily wishes
them good luck in the project.
Speaking of good luck, we wish a lot of it for:
RED AM) WHITE DAY
We are glad to see Cardinals is starling up a special day for
wearing Red, Red, and lots more Red during Big Game Week.
It is a good idea, even il we did have to steal it from Cal s Blue
Monday. Actually il is an improvement blue is such a dreary
color next to Red.
We are only sorry that Cardinals started Red and W bite Day
with the wish that people would wear Red. We think it ought
to be a demand—with proper penalties for the infidels wearing
blue. But we still want to compliment Cardinals on the idea and
hope that plain, common sense will make everyone wear Red
tomorrow, and that, once the tradition gets rolling, we will get
Red-hot enforcement.
For one last note we would like to say "Thanks tor:
NEW STREET SIGNS
We give the Corporation ard a pat on the back for putting
up the dozens of new signs all over campus. Visitors will surely
give their thanks as well.
And maybe, someday, even students will be more explicit than
"That street which runs by Physics Corner (which one —Serra
or Lomita Drive?), or "That road by Fncina (which one —Serra
or Galvez?). Mavbe . . . someday.
