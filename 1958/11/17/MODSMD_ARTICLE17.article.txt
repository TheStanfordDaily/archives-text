Amazed
Editor, The Daily:
The letters in Monday's Daily
concerning the USC game amazed
me. I never realized that a stu
dent going to a football game as
sumed the obligation of staying to
the end of the contest, on order to
fill the stadium with cheers for
the gladiators on the field. After
all, football is supposed to be a
game that members of the team
play because they enjoy it, not
some mystical ceremony in which
the spirit of the University is re
newed.
A more legitimate complaint,
probably, is embodied in Prince
Lightfoot's comments on conduct
in the (male) rooting sectionâ€”
conduct that admittedly falls
somewhat short of Emily Post
drawing room standards. How
ever, stag party behavior never
has been quite up to E.P.'s best.
1 think it is fair to discuss both
complaints in the same letter,
since the origin of both is the
same. Students no longer get ex
cited over winning or losing foot
l*dl games; we go to games either
to he entertained by action on the
field, or to entertain ourselves. I j
attach no value judgment to this; j
whether the Buck Club's vigorous
effort to buy a winning football
team is morally superior to stu
dent apathy is another subject.
The fact remains that we are apa
thetic regarding Hie outcome of
athletic events.
Since negative criticism is al
ways rather sterile, I would like
to offer a positive suggestion. In
particular, 1 would like to sug
gest that Stanford model her foot
ball season after her Ivy League
sisters. In the Ivy League, foot
ball season is social season, and
a football weekend is an event in
which students can participate.
The stands stay full, because it is
fun to remain at the game with
one's date, as well as because the
cocktail parties in the houses
don't start until after the game is
over. Everyone in the stands may
not be stone sober, but at least
the presence of one's date is a
constant reminder to be a gentle
man.
Here, the segregation of the
rooting section is a constant invi
tation to stag-party behavior; if
both this and the action on the

field fail to keep us entertained,
we go home. The mass exodus
that some found so distressing is
an evitable consequence of per
petuating a tradition (i.e., the
football season) that has lost all
meaning in terms of personal or
vicarious participation.

Violent Bawlings
Editor, The Daily:
Violent bawlings and wailings
because students leave in the mid
dle of football games? Granted,
if one has poor enough taste to
attend a rather barbaric form of
capture the flag, he should at
least have the patience to sit
through the game, to see if any of
the anthropoid apes meets death.
However, I do not believe that
those who frankly do not give a
damn one way or the other as to
the outcome of the game, and
who have tired of even the flash
ing thighs of the dancers, etc., are
showing a lack of school feeling,
or "belonging" to THE UNIVER
SITY. There are a few of us who
belong to Stanford, and are fond
of the school, but show this in
other ways than by screaming for
the lions in the arena.
I realize that it is heresy to
state that the finest form of spirit
finds its expression in the attend
ance of student plays, and the
buying and reading of student
publications. If people do not at
tend a Stanford play, they are not
called "apathetic" or accused of
not belonging to the lovely Stan
ford family. They attend if it is
a good play, well presented. But
if these same people do not attend
a bad game to watch a bad team,
then it is no longer considered a
matter of taste; it becomes apa
thy.
So for those of you who are
shocked, disillusioned and embit
tered by the lack of enthusiasm
shown toward football, I suggest
that you attend all Stanford pro
ductions, buy all student publica
tions, watch all events in all
sports, listen to Civ lectures and
stand in line at the Bookstore.
Then you may become true mem
bers of the STANFORD FAM
ILY.
