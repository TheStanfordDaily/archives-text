## 'Prepare for Bear' 
### 
Four weeks until finals—and a
moan resounds through the cam
pus arcades. Or, from another
point of view — five and a half
weeks until Christmas, and
echoes from the empty pockets
mingle with anticipation of the
holidays.
But meanwhile, back on the
Farm, students are plunging fe
verishly into Big Game Week,
which today begins.
Tonight football players will be
hosted at the campus dormitories
at dinner. This is not so much so
students can say "Yes, here's a
football player," but to allow liv
ing groups to get acquainted with
fellow students, in particular fel
low students who are representa
tive of one phase of campus life.
For those who wish only to
study, the Library will be open
longer hours. Those who like
to see student musical and dra
matic talent in action will find
Gaieties on stage in Memorial
Auditorium. Sweet toot lis and
suppresed "hatreds" will be sat
isfied with "Lick the Bear" Day
and vocal chords will be exer
cised at rallies throughout the
week.
Saturday—The Big Game—ac
companied by numerous "Little
Big Games" (including, by the
way, a contest between The Daily
and the Daily Galifornian in the
traditional Ink Bowl).
Finally Saturday night there
will be the parties, ranging from
overnights at comparatively dis
tant points to small, quiet gather
ings.
"Is chivalry dead among
Stanford men?" This is what a
group of freshman women are
asking. Their complaint is that
, the Stanford men, to whom the
ratio is a source of annoyance,
have not been honoring the tra
dition along Palm Drive —to of
fer walkers a lift to or from
campus.
These frosh have a just com
plaint in most cases and a re-
I minder to drivers is in order.

One of the "flicks" on the Pe-1
ninsula should be of special in- |
terist to Stanford students—"ln ;
Love and War" was filmed par
tially on the campus. Of inter
esting note is a plaque which ap
pears behind stars Bradford Dill
man and France Nuyen in one of
the scenes. The plaque commemo
rates the photographic experi
ments done here in 1878 and 1879
when Stanford was the Palo Alto
Farm of Senator Stanford.
We want to thank one of our
readers for calling to our atten
tion misplaced quotation marks 1
in last Monday's column. It was
not our intent to claim for our-1
selves the comments of David Bo- J
roff in his discussion on Sarah
Lawrence. We won't reprint the;
paragraph in question, but for j
those who wish to check back, the !
material in the next to the last
paragraph all belongs to Boroff. I
