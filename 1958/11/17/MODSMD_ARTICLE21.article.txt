### WALTER LIPPMANN 
(Editor's Note: This is an
other in a series of articles by
Walter Lippmami in which lie
reports his interview with
Khrushchev.)
Americans, he began, seem not
to realize the danger which their
present policy of rearming West
Germany may well bring down
upon them.
What is this danger? I asked.
11 is, he said, that it a new war
is unleashed |we shall come later
to his conception of how a new
war might be unleashed!, Ger
many might once again turn to
the East against the West.
Why?
Because if West Germany en
gaged in a war against the East,
the U.S.S.R. could quickly destroy
West Germany wilh its missiles.
But if the Soviet Union encour
aged Germany to turn against the
West, the Germans alone would
be much stronger than England,
France and Spain combined .
This led him on to say lhat the
situation was much like that on
the eve of World War 11. How?
Much is said in the West about
Munich. But the Western peoples
do not understand Munich. They

think that Czechoslovakia was
sacrificed at Munich in order to
appease Hitler and keep him from
going to war.
But in fact, said Mr. K. with
passionate conviction. Muni c h
Was arranged by British and
French conservatives who wanted
Hitler to attack Russia. To in
duce him to do that, they gave
him Czechoslovakia, which is "an
arrow aimed at the heart of Rus
sia." The Soviet Union, he said,
had been ready in 1938 to join in
the defense ol' Czechoslovakia
against Hitler, and had actually
alerted its army.
Alter Munich, said Mr. K.,
Stalin realized the danger to
the I'.S.S.H. as a result of the
Western action. Hitler, too,
saw what this action meant to
the Russians and, believing that
he could finish off Britain and

France if the SovU*f T T nion were
induced to remain nelltral, Hit
ler o lit* ret I to makf a deul with
Stalin.
