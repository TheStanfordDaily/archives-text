# Frosh Fall to Cal In Little Big Game
## 
### Ron Rapoport 
A tremendous defensive effort thai just couldn't keep up the pace
and an offense that got rolling too late spelled the doom of Stanford's
freshman football team as they dropped a 2wto 9 decision to the
Cal frosh Saturday in Stanford Stadium. \j
The score does not show that the winner was not actually decided

until the last few .seconds.
With 37 seconds left, the Pa
pooses trapped Cal halfback Rog
rr Hewitt in the end zone for a
safety making the score 1(> to 9.
Cal's kick was run out of bounds
by safety Bill Kuhn on the SIJ 35
with 24 seconds remaining.
On the first play Cal center
Stan Parkinson intercepted quar
terback Jim Smith's pass and ran
it baCK 40 yards for the final
score.
Only Score
Stanford fullback Stan Lind
skog scored the Papooses' lone
touchdown in the second period
on a 90-yard runback of an inter
cepted pass. He had also scored
on a 55-yard interception in the
first period only to have it called
back for an off-side penalty.
Stanford's defense came up
with two line goal-line stands in
the second quarter when Cal had
the ball on the SU seven with a
first down. Three plays later
quarterback Dennis Shay was
hauled down one yard short of
the goal line by Papoose defend
ers Hal Steuber and Dave Nolan.
Stanford took over but soon
found itself in trouble again as
Cal halfback Russ Boemke took a
punt and returned it to the Stan
ford 17. This time the home team
recovered a wild pitchout by
Shay and got out of danger.
Cal Adds- H
Cal scored once in the third
quarter on a 95-yard drive cli
maxed by a 14-yard pass from
quarterback Pete Olson to hall
back A 1 Jamile. Olson passed to
fullback Ron Jennings for the
two-point conversion.
Again in the fourth period a
pass from Shay to end Bill Turner
good for 48 yards set up a Cal
tally. Three plays later Shay took
the ball over from the one-yard
line. Boemke ran the extra point,
making the score IG-7.
Later Stanford drove to the Cal
11, but penalties forced them back
and Cal intercepted a pass giving
them the ball deep in their own
territory. A clipping penalty put
the Bear frosh on their own one
yard line and Stanford pushed
Hewitt back for the safety.
