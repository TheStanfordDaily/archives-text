# PROTHRO:
## Cards Have No Chance Against Cal 
### 
Oregon Stale's head football
coach Tommy Prothro may not be
as much of a comedian as Stan
ford's Jack Curtice, but after
watching his team pull out a
hard-fought ball game in Stan
ford's wind-swept Stadium Satur
day he could afford to be in a
very happy and jovial mood.
"No, I didn't l'eel very secure
with our 10 to 0 second-quarter
lead," Prothro replied o a ques
tion, "but I guess the team did."
About Ihe great showing marie
by SU's quarterback Dick Nor
man, Prothro had a lot to say.
"He really pinpointed that ball
and got it there quick," he said.
"I've seen movies of Norman and
frankly he just didn't look any
where near* as good in any of
thern as he did today. In those
films he looked like a prospect.
Today he looked like a football
player."
Prothro, of course, praised the
fine playing of Ted Bates, his All-
American candidate at tackle, and
Nub Beamer, Jim Stinnette and
Chuck Marshall, his fullbacks.
The talk naturally got around
to the coming Big Game next
week between Stanford and Cal.
"Let me just say this," Prothro
said. "I think that. Jack Curtice
has broughl this Stanford team
along well, hut I just don't think
lie has a chance against Califor
nia. This Joe Kapp may not do
all that there is to do in a foot
hall game, but he does everything
that Cal needs to he done."
