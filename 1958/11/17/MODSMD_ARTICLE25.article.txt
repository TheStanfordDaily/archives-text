## SPORT SCENE Cards Second In SJS Meet 
### 
Weakness in the rear ranks
took its toll Friday as Stanford
finished second in a meet dubbed
as the Northern California Cross-
Country Championships at San
Jose State.
The host school took team hon
ors with 42 points to 53 for Stan
lord. Sacramento State was third
with 09, Cal had 72, and Cal Poly
and Santa Clara Youth Village
trailed.
Stanford's Keith Wallace ran
another of his excellent races,
leading nearly all the way to win
handily in 21:22.8 over the four
mile course.
Doug Martin continued to look
impressive as he took third be
hind San Jose's Bill Morgan. Bob
Mon/.ingo lost a stretch battle to
Roger Price and Alan Gaylord of
Cal, taking seventh.
But Stanford was hurt by tire
171 h place finish of John North
way, Kim Maxwell's running 30th
and A 1 Ahumada finishing 34th.
The lack of second-line strength
shoved Indians back so far 1 that
Stanford's score sky-rocketed de
spite three finishing in the lop
seven.
Maxwell, however, did run his
best race of the fall despite the
low finish.
