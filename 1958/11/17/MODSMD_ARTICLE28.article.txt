# No Breaks -- Curtice
## 
### 
"Maybe someday a break or
two will go our way instead of
having all of iliem go to our oppo
nents." These were the words of
a very disappointed Jack Curtice
on Saturday after his Stanford
team had just absorbed its sev
enth defeat in nine games.
"We certainly deserved at least
a lie and probably would have
gotten it if just nrif or two things
had gone our way."
"Old Norman certainly did a
fine job taking charge of that
team," added Curtice. "Not only
was he good in directing the team
to its two touchdowns, but he
called just the right plays in
those key extra point situations
which gave us a 16-16 tie until
that last OSC score."
Again, injuries popped up
among the Stanford troops and
Curtice bemoaned the fact that
he couldn't count on many of his

linemen to play for very long
stretchess. Curtice was deeply
concerned with the condition of
co-captain and guard Bob Peter
son who is now a questionable
player in next week's Big Game
due to a knee injury sustained
Saturday.
When asked what he thought
his team's shortcomings were in
the game, Curtice mentioned the
fact that his defensive backfield
showed absolutely nothing when
the OSC runners came their way,
and he noted that once again
Stanford fumbles proved costly.
Curtice also felt that his line
played a good game, "the best
they humanly and physically
could play." He also noted the
fine individual play of Doug Pur
sell and 60-minuter Chris Burford.
These two players have received
raves in almost all nine Stanford
games this year.
