# Grad Student Gives Skilled Piano Recital
## 
### Diana Smith 
Jesse Parker, graduate student
in the Music Department, treated
listeners to an on the whole ex
ceptional recital of piano music
yesterday at 1 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Opening with Schumann's "Car
naval," Op. 9, Parker displayed
the requisite versatility of tech
nique, and after some initial un
evenness, successfully communi
cated a variety of carnaval moods
ranging from the wistful to the
dynamic. His transitions between
musical emotions were sometimes
quite skillfully executed, some
times less so.
A deft rendition of five De
bussy "Preludes from Book II"
was the high point of the pro
gram. Parker evoked from the
keys a haunting combination of
gracefulness and power charac
teristic of the composer.
Parker's performance of the
Bartok "Sonata" (1926), although
a technically proficient blond of
intricate harmonics and dynam
ics, didn't fully exploit the power
potential of the piece. Interprc
tively, it was rather too matter
of -fact.
His Beethoven Sonata, Op. 53 in
C major ("Waldstein"), suffered
from a certain woodenness, owing
partly to inadequate emphasis of
tonal contrasts, and partly to an
unfortunate pacing.
