## Nasser Gains In Sudan Coup 
### 
CAIRO (/P) Another Middle Eastern parliamentary democracy
went into eelip.se Monday when army commander General Ibrahim
Abboud seized power in a military coup in Sudan.
The coup unseated the pro-Western government of Premier Ab
dullah Khalil.
At noon, the official Sudan radio broadcast that army units from

all parts of the sprawling African
nation reported all quint.
The Abboud coup, so far as can
be determined here, had the back
ing of the entire army.
The government radio in Khar
! toum, the Sudanese capital, broad
cast a declaration in the name of
Abboud promising to do his best
to achieve good relations with
President Nasser's United Arab
Republic.',
The overthrow of the Khalil re
j i. r ime came as N'asser and the Su
danese government were trying
to patch up long-standing differ
ences over division of the Nile
waters, their frontiers, and trade
â–  matters.
Parliament to Meet
The Sudanese parliament was
scheduled to meet later this
month and both sides had ex
pressed hope that an agreement
would be ready for ratification by
thai time.
Abboud's military coup upset
one of the few parliamentary de
mocracies left in the Middle East.
I Sudan ob t a i 11 e d independence
from joint British-Egyptian con
| Irol Jan. 1, 1956, and since then
had maintained a parliamentary
system. The government had sid
ed consistently wilh the West and
frequently had been embroiled in
disputes wilh Nasser's regime.
Like other military chiefs who
have seized power in the Middle
East and Asia recently, Abboud
J accused his country's political
leaders of corruption and dissen
sion which had hamstrung gov
ernment operations.
< 'orniption
"You should all know to what
extent our country has reached in
corruption," his radio statement
said. "It has reached into govern
-1 ment machinery and all authori
ties without exceptions. All this
is due to a political crisis which
stands between all political par
ties."
"As to the UAR," he continued,
"we shall do our best to improve
relations between the two coun
tries, to solve all pending prob
lems and remove fabricated dis
sensions."
