The Chaparral st;iff, assuming
that .-411 Stanfordites arc mad'-' of
money, and oblivious to Ihe fact
that J3ig (lame costs money, has
come out with another reason for
spending that previous folding
green stuff.
Their annual Dig Game edition
of ribald good humor, strewn
with filched funnies from other
campus humor magazines, will be
on sale tomorrow. At least the
covers of the mag, which arc put
lip to lure prospective customers
into unwittingly plunking down
their silver on the day of the sale,
seem to indicate this.
