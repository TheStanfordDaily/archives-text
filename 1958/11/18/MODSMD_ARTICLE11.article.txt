## 
### 
Disciplinary action faces five
University of California students

They were arrested as they
were driving away from the cam

lice.
The chief victim of their cans
of paint was Hoover Tower. They
painted blue and golds "C's" on
the walls, windows and steps of
the tower. The inscription placed
on the sidewalk in front of Hoo
ver Tower reads: "The only good
Indian is a dead Indian. Cal—G9;
Stanford—o."
Other Evidence
Other evidence of their work
may be found on I lie front of Me
morial Auditorium, on the Art
Gallery steps and in Memorial
Court, where they embellished
the memorial plaques with gold
"C's." The five also painted "C;d
will win" on (lie right-hand tower
at the entrance to Memorial
Court.
Estimated damage totals some
$2000, University officials said.
In order to remove the paint from
Hoover Tower, the walls of the
Tower will have to be sandblasted
and then repainted, they ex
plained.

of California officials for discipli
nary action.
Hurford E. Stone, Cal's Dean of

Two cans, partially filled with
blue paint, were found by officers

ASSU President John Bohn
Monday urged Stanford students

the two universities agreed on
Friday. (See story, this page,) In
agreeing to the pact, student lead
ers stressed that the responsibil
ity lies upon the individual stu
dent to avoid activities which
would be destructive to either
campus.
ASSU President John Bohn
Monday urged Stanford students
to hold their University in higher
regard than Cal students hold
their own campus, and to avoid
any retaliatory measures of a de
structive nature.
Disciplinary action faces five
University of California students
who were apprehended here early
Monday morning, just after they
had completed an extensive blue
and gold paint job on the Stan
ford campus.
They were arrested as they
were driving away from the cam
pus at 4:30 a.m. by Stanford po
lice.
The chief victim of their cans
of paint was Hoover Tower. They
painted blue and golds "C's" on
the walls, windows and steps of
the tower. The inscription placed
on the sidewalk in front of Hoo
ver Tower reads: "The only good
Indian is a dead Indian. Cal—G9;
Stanford—o."
Other Evidence
Other evidence of their work
may be found on I lie front of Me
morial Auditorium, on the Art
Gallery steps and in Memorial
Court, where they embellished
the memorial plaques with gold
"C's." The five also painted "C;d
will win" on (lie right-hand tower
at the entrance to Memorial
Court.
Estimated damage totals some
$2000, University officials said.
In order to remove the paint from
Hoover Tower, the walls of the
Tower will have to be sandblasted
and then repainted, they ex
plained.
I'act Terms
Under the terms of the recent
ly-signed non-aggression pact, the

Richard L. Clark, IT; William R.
Lomax, IT; Richard N. Chanda,
21; and Richard Maddock, 19 —
will be turned over to University
of California officials for discipli
nary action.
Hurford E. Stone, Cal's Dean of
Students, told The Daily Monday
afternoon that the offenders will

Council at Cal where their penal
ties will be decided.
The five, when first apprehend
ed by Stanford police, told the of
ficers that they were Stanford
students. Upon further question
ing, they admitted they were
from the University of California.
Two cans, partially filled with
blue paint, were found by officers
in the trunk of the car which was
driven by Hagedorn.
In Cal Stadium
However, the Stanford campus
