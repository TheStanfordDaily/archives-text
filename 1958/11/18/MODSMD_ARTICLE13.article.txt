# Fill Those Hoses

Wf have not along Palm I>i iv«* long enough, we 11;»\ 112 been
jostled by the potholes of l.asuen Street one lime 100 man); now
we want to see some improvement made on Stanford s roads.
Some of the things we eall streets around here look more like
the practice ground for a bunch of apprentice well-diggers.
Some of the roads on this campus are so 101 l ol lumps and
holes thai they look more like topograph) models than modern
thoroughfares. Hiding a bicycle on some ol these "roadf is almost
dangerous.
For the edification of those members ol the Administration
who have not ridden a bicycle for a few years years, we suggest
they stand outside The Cellar some evening and watch the light
thrown on the road by headlights as cars drive down from the
Row. \\ hat one sees is not a solid streak of light cast on a smooth
surface, but a polka-dol pattern of shadows made by mounds and
depressions of the misshapen asphalt.
We complain particularly of three roads:
(1) l.asuen Street from Engineering Corner to Beta
Comer, and particularly the stretch from I lie (.ellar to
the Post Office.
(2) Palm Drive from start to finish. And the side
paths which the I'olice Department requires bicyclists to
use are even worse.
(3) 'I'he road from the eating clubs quadrangle to
Encina gym. I his surely mast be the worst-paved road
in the world. We have not seen every road, but we. are
secure in the faith there could at least be none worse
than this one.
Why these roads have not been repaired before this is, of course,
a matter of finance. Supposedly, there is not the money.
But there is money — and we say this without even having
looked at the budget. In a situation of this type, there is not a
lack of money —just a list of priorities. The University has a budget
for upkeep. \\ hat this money is spent for is determined by need,
and obviously the powers that rule think the need for better roads
is not very great.
U e could not disagree more strongly. There have been
many letters recently by alumni about students leaving
the rooting section at Homecoming. It e would like to
know what these same alumni thought of their bouncing
return to campus up Palm Drive„ what they thought of
their bronc-busting ride up the Row.
Good roads create a good impression, bad roads a terrible one.
We can see slighting the road behind Encina gym, but Palm Drive
is the MAIN ENTRANCE to campus; Lasuen Street is the main
street in the CENTER OF CAMPUS. If we want to create a good
impression on visitors, let us start right at the beginning.
One 1133 only to look—or to ride over the five-inch drop in
'■ : ; right in front of the Post Office —to see that Stanford
has been neglecting its roads.
Since tee have been at this I niversity we have often
seen the asphalt truck out patching up tjiis hole or that
one —it wus at it just a few days ago in front of I he (.el
lar—but what is needed is not a patch work job. rather a
tliorongh rebuilding.
We know it costs money; we just say that this should be No. I
on our upkeep priority list. \\ hatevcr funds we DO have for
maintenance should he directed to improving our roads before
those funds are spent on anything else.
