# PRESIDENT'S REPORT
## Axe Procedure 
### John Bohn ASSU President 
Before we discuss the activities
of Legislature this past week, let
me clarify the procedure which is
followed concerning the Axo at
Big Game.
It is traditional for the rooting
section of the winning team to
cross the field en masse and re
form in front of the losing sec
tion, where the Axe Ceremony
takes place. When we win, then,
since we already have the Axe, it
is traditional that we cross the
field with the team to serenade
the California section. If. per
chance, we lose, we remain in the
stands and wait for the Cal sec
tion to come across to accept the
Axe at the base of our rooting
section. Let me encourage all of
you to help us guard Ihe Axe on
the trip across the field.
Plans Shaped
Turning now to Legislature's
work, several projects which have
been in the preliminary stages
for the past few weeks came to a
conclusion this last week. Legis
lature approved the constitution
of the Panel of Americans, an or
ganization composed of members
representing minority, racial and
religious groups who speak in
Panel and discuss American so
ciety from their own vantage
points. I have received word that
the Athletic Department has at
last completed revision of the
awards program, including crew,
and it will definitely be intro
duced at Legislature this Thurs
day.
I would like here to compliment

John Richards on the excellent
job he is doing as Elections Com
mission chairman. Several inno
vations have been introduced
which have greatly simplified and
clarified voting procedure. Be
sides the expanded facilities,
areas around the ballot boxes
have been roped off to prevent
undue outside influences on vot
ers and care has been taken to
indicate on the ballot in which
areas the student may vote.
Weekly Reports
The Legislature has introduced
the practice of having various
boards and commissions report
their activities and plans for Leg
islative scrutiny. This we feel
will give Legislature a much
clearer picture of the function of
these subordinate organizations
and at the same time provide an
opportunity for the students in
general to offer suggestions and
criticism through their represen
tatives. Along this line also, Ihe
Legislature is dividing into three
man committees and investigat
ing each of the boards and com
missions with an eye both to edu
cating the Legislature members
and increasing efficiency of oper
ation by eliminating duplication
of effort.
Those commissions up for re
port this week are Speech Asso
ciation and Student-Faculty Com
mission and we invite students to
the meeting Thursday night at
Bowman Alumni House.
As a sidelight, the Stanford
Legislature tangles with Ihe Cali
fornia Legislature at 9 a.m. Sat
urday in Memorial Stadium at
Berkeley.
