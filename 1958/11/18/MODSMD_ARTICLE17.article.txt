Editor, The Daily:
Wolfgang Storch, ASSU ex
change student from the Free
University of Berlin, indicated in
an interview reported in last
Thursday's Daily that he found
the Stanford "system of little as
signments and a rigid time sched
ule" oppressive. He further stat
ed that he felt "grades, points and
credits cripple initiative" and that
the system leaves no time for im
portant work on material of the
student's own interest.
These frank and somewhat
stinging comments from a new
comer to the American system of
advanced - level education point
out a seemingly obvious and sig
nificant defect in our system,
whic h, sadly, is seldom mentioned.
The requirement of cramming
facts into one's brain to meet as
signment deadlines and then vom
iting these facts up for an exami
nation leaves little room for re
flection, discussion or a more
than superficial analysis of what
the student has "learned."
It is unfortunate, indeed, con
sidering the recent awakening of
interest in our educational sys
tem brought on by a clearer real
ization of the efforts of Soviet
Russia in this area, that more is
not being done, or at least said,
concerning the defects of our
American system.
Perhaps it is only the outsider
who possesses the insight or the
lack of complacency to criticize
this defect. It is not a happy pros
pect, however, to anicipate the
perpetuation of an unrealistic ap
proach to higher learning, which
results in mass production of our
college students. Perhaps our
system is merely another inci
dence of American materialism.
The emphasis, as usual, seems to
be on the label rather than the
substance.

Editor, The Daily:
The alumni of Stanford at
tacked our rooting section for the
walkout in the last half of our
Homecoming game. They asked
for an explanation for our action,
and I hope this one will enlighten
them.
The whole idea of rooting for
the school team is based on a ri
diculous premise. A group of in
dividuals are gathered within the
walls of Stanford to become the
future educated leaders of Amer
ica, and these educated people are
supposed to go to a football game
and yell for the school team?
Stanford is basically an institu
tion to produce educated people,
and intelligent students are sup
posed to yell and scream for this
material machine so its football

team will win? It seems to me
those alums are way off base. If
a student is to yell for something,
why not something closer to the
purpose of Stanford such as its
books or instructors. The whole
idea of yelling for the University i
is something you might expect a j
mob of ignorant fools to do.
The second foolish idea the;
alums want the students to do is j
support a losing team. This idea i
is the most ridiculous of all. As
suming first that we are stupid
enough to support the team, they
surely don't want us to stay with
a sinking ship simply because we
happen to be aboard it. If we yell
and scream at a game it is be- j
cause we want our team to win j
and when it gets to the point:
where it is obvious the team is
losing, we waste our time yelling.
I wonder how many of our shal
low • thinking alums ever kept
stock in a dying business simply
because they owned pail: of the
company. These people are too
practical to stay with a loser.
Then why is it wrong for Stan
ford students, preparing for life,
to be practical too? No one else
in the world would be so ridicu
lous as the alums of Stanford
want us to be.
May I suggest that the alums
reconsider this outdated idea of
school spirit for a more realistic
and practical goal?

for an explanation for our action,

them.
The whole idea of rooting for
the school team is based on a ri
diculous premise. A group of in

supposed to go to a football game
and yell for the school team?
Stanford is basically an institu
tion to produce educated people,
and intelligent students are sup
posed to yell and scream for this
material machine so its football

team will win? It seems to me
those alums are way off base. If
a student is to yell for something,
why not something closer to the
purpose of Stanford such as its
books or instructors. The whole
idea of yelling for the University i
is something you might expect a j
mob of ignorant fools to do.
The second foolish idea the;
alums want the students to do is j
support a losing team. This idea i
is the most ridiculous of all. As
suming first that we are stupid
enough to support the team, they
surely don't want us to stay with
a sinking ship simply because we
happen to be aboard it. If we yell
and scream at a game it is be- j
cause we want our team to win j
and when it gets to the point:
where it is obvious the team is
losing, we waste our time yelling.
I wonder how many of our shal

stock in a dying business simply

Then why is it wrong for Stan

Perhaps it is only the outsider
who possesses the insight or the
lack of complacency to criticize
this defect. It is not a happy pros
pect, however, to anicipate the
perpetuation of an unrealistic ap
proach to higher learning, which
results in mass production of our
college students. Perhaps our
system is merely another inci
dence of American materialism.
The emphasis, as usual, seems to
be on the label rather than the
substance.

Ridiculous Promise
Editor, The Daily:
The alumni of Stanford at
tacked our rooting section for the
walkout in the last half of our
Homecoming game. They asked
for an explanation for our action,
and I hope this one will enlighten
them.
The whole idea of rooting for
the school team is based on a ri
diculous premise. A group of in
dividuals are gathered within the
walls of Stanford to become the
future educated leaders of Amer
ica, and these educated people are
supposed to go to a football game
and yell for the school team?
Stanford is basically an institu
tion to produce educated people,
and intelligent students are sup
posed to yell and scream for this
material machine so its football

team will win? It seems to me
those alums are way off base. If
a student is to yell for something,
why not something closer to the
purpose of Stanford such as its
books or instructors. The whole
idea of yelling for the University i
is something you might expect a j
mob of ignorant fools to do.
The second foolish idea the;
alums want the students to do is j
support a losing team. This idea i
is the most ridiculous of all. As
suming first that we are stupid
enough to support the team, they
surely don't want us to stay with
a sinking ship simply because we
happen to be aboard it. If we yell
and scream at a game it is be- j
cause we want our team to win j
and when it gets to the point:
where it is obvious the team is
losing, we waste our time yelling.
I wonder how many of our shal
low • thinking alums ever kept
stock in a dying business simply
because they owned pail: of the
company. These people are too
practical to stay with a loser.
Then why is it wrong for Stan
ford students, preparing for life,
to be practical too? No one else
in the world would be so ridicu
lous as the alums of Stanford
want us to be.
May I suggest that the alums
reconsider this outdated idea of
school spirit for a more realistic
and practical goal?
