## U.S. Contemplates War? 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
(Kdi tor's Note: Walter IJpp
mann continues his interview
with Khrushchev.)
Hitler intended, of course, to at
tack Russia when he had finished
with the West. But Stalin, for his
part, saw a chance to weaken Hit
ler before the coming attack on
Russia hy encouraging him to
make war in the West.
The reader who has followed
my story to this point will -surely
be asking himself, as I did ask
myself dur in g the interview,
whether Nikita Khrushchev seri
ously believed that the United
States was contemplating a war
against the Soviet Union.
For, while his attitude toward
West Germany and Turkey was
threatening, it was also clear that

| ho was not thinking of attacking
I them first with his military
l forces.
! It was clear to mo because 1
could detect no doubt in his mind
: that the United States would in
tervene and no doubt at aJI that
he regards the United States as a
j military power to be treated with
J the utmost respect.
Ilis talk about what lie could
do to Germany and Turkey, and
indeed to Kngland, France and
Spain as well, was meant, to put
it in military terms, as the
threat of an offensive-defensive
in case the Soviet Union was
attacked by NATO.
What, then, makes Mr. K. think
1 that the NATO powers might at-
I tack the Soviet Union? His an
| swer, if 1 may put it in my own
words, is that if the United States
finds that it is going to lose the
Cold War it is likely to resort to
a hot war.
That is not what he said, but I
came to think it was what he
meant, after an interesting pas
sage in which he talked about the
American fear and hatred of Com
munism.
Communism, he said, is in
deed a great danger to you as
an ideology and as a doctrine,
but it is not a danger to you as
a military policy of the Soviet
government.
The Communists, he said, do
not want to shed their blood or
the blood of others to extend their
frontiers. And each country
should defend itself against Com
munism within its borders, if it
sees fit to do so.
(This I took to be an echo of
the talks lie had had with the
Egpytian field marshal in t lie pre
ceding days about Nasser's treat
ment of his local Communists.)
But, nevertheless, after these
quieting statements, he said

rather solemnly, "we" — the
Communists —will cause you,
the Americans, more "trouble"
each year.
How? The trouble for the West
will come from the continual
I "multiplication of benefits" re
i reived by the people of the Soviet
| states. At present, he said, the
i United States is the richest and
J most productive country in the
world. But il is living "the last
I years of its greatness."
Why? Because shortly the So
; viet Union will surpass the United
States in productivity per capita.
! He was referred, it was evident,
to the coming Seven-Year Plan.
When that plan is achieved, the
people (of the poor countries) will
! "be convinced by their stomachs."
: THAT is your danger, lie asserted,
; not our hydrogen bombs.
Here lies the answer to the
question of why Mr. K. thinks we
might make war against him.
It is an article of bis faith,
vv li i c h descends from Lenin,
that if tile Soviet Union forges
ahead in technology and pro
ductivity, attracting into its fir
bit the old colonial territory of
\ the European empires, the West
will attack rather than lose the
contest for world leadership by
default.
Against this type of preventive
war by the West, Mr. I<. believes
he has found the solution with the
| intermediate • range missile. As
for Turkey, for example, he as-
I sorted that in case of a general
! war the NATO forces would ar
j rive in Turkey too late for the
funeral.
He added, in passing, that our
' action in Lebanon was "playing
at war" and that the Soviet Un
ion would not concern itself with
"fleas" like Lebanon.

finds that it is going to lose the
Cold War it is likely to resort to
a hot war.
That is not what he said, but I
came to think it was what he
meant, after an interesting pas
sage in which he talked about the
American fear and hatred of Com
munism.
Communism, he said, is in
deed a great danger to you as
an ideology and as a doctrine,
but it is not a danger to you as
a military policy of the Soviet
government.
The Communists, he said, do
not want to shed their blood or
the blood of others to extend their
frontiers. And each country
should defend itself against Com
munism within its borders, if it
sees fit to do so.
(This I took to be an echo of
the talks lie had had with the
Egpytian field marshal in t lie pre
ceding days about Nasser's treat
ment of his local Communists.)
But, nevertheless, after these
quieting statements, he said

rather solemnly, "we" — the
Communists —will cause you,
the Americans, more "trouble"
each year.
How? The trouble for the West
will come from the continual
I "multiplication of benefits" re
i reived by the people of the Soviet
| states. At present, he said, the
i United States is the richest and
J most productive country in the
world. But il is living "the last
I years of its greatness."
Why? Because shortly the So
; viet Union will surpass the United
States in productivity per capita.
! He was referred, it was evident,
to the coming Seven-Year Plan.
When that plan is achieved, the
people (of the poor countries) will
! "be convinced by their stomachs."
: THAT is your danger, lie asserted,
; not our hydrogen bombs.
Here lies the answer to the
question of why Mr. K. thinks we
might make war against him.
It is an article of bis faith,
vv li i c h descends from Lenin,
that if tile Soviet Union forges
ahead in technology and pro
ductivity, attracting into its fir
bit the old colonial territory of
\ the European empires, the West
will attack rather than lose the
contest for world leadership by
default.
Against this type of preventive
war by the West, Mr. I<. believes
he has found the solution with the
| intermediate • range missile. As
for Turkey, for example, he as-
I sorted that in case of a general
! war the NATO forces would ar
j rive in Turkey too late for the
funeral.
He added, in passing, that our
' action in Lebanon was "playing
at war" and that the Soviet Un
ion would not concern itself with
"fleas" like Lebanon.

Hitler intended, of course, to at

Russia hy encouraging him to
make war in the West.
The reader who has followed

West Germany and Turkey was

I them first with his military

he regards the United States as a

J the utmost respect.

do to Germany and Turkey, and
indeed to Kngland, France and
Spain as well, was meant, to put
it in military terms, as the

Here lies the answer to the
question of why Mr. K. thinks we
might make war against him.
It is an article of bis faith,
vv li i c h descends from Lenin,
that if tile Soviet Union forges
ahead in technology and pro
ductivity, attracting into its fir
bit the old colonial territory of
\ the European empires, the West
will attack rather than lose the
contest for world leadership by
default.
Against this type of preventive
war by the West, Mr. I<. believes
he has found the solution with the
| intermediate • range missile. As
for Turkey, for example, he as-
I sorted that in case of a general
! war the NATO forces would ar
j rive in Turkey too late for the
funeral.
He added, in passing, that our
' action in Lebanon was "playing
at war" and that the Soviet Un
ion would not concern itself with
"fleas" like Lebanon.

(Kdi tor's Note: Walter IJpp
mann continues his interview
with Khrushchev.)
Hitler intended, of course, to at
tack Russia when he had finished
with the West. But Stalin, for his
part, saw a chance to weaken Hit
ler before the coming attack on
Russia hy encouraging him to
make war in the West.
The reader who has followed
my story to this point will -surely
be asking himself, as I did ask
myself dur in g the interview,
whether Nikita Khrushchev seri
ously believed that the United
States was contemplating a war
against the Soviet Union.
For, while his attitude toward
West Germany and Turkey was
threatening, it was also clear that

| ho was not thinking of attacking
I them first with his military
l forces.
! It was clear to mo because 1
could detect no doubt in his mind
: that the United States would in
tervene and no doubt at aJI that
he regards the United States as a
j military power to be treated with
J the utmost respect.
Ilis talk about what lie could
do to Germany and Turkey, and
indeed to Kngland, France and
Spain as well, was meant, to put
it in military terms, as the
threat of an offensive-defensive
in case the Soviet Union was
attacked by NATO.
What, then, makes Mr. K. think
1 that the NATO powers might at-
I tack the Soviet Union? His an
| swer, if 1 may put it in my own
words, is that if the United States
finds that it is going to lose the
Cold War it is likely to resort to
a hot war.
That is not what he said, but I
came to think it was what he
meant, after an interesting pas
sage in which he talked about the
American fear and hatred of Com
munism.
Communism, he said, is in
deed a great danger to you as
an ideology and as a doctrine,
but it is not a danger to you as
a military policy of the Soviet
government.
The Communists, he said, do
not want to shed their blood or
the blood of others to extend their
frontiers. And each country
should defend itself against Com
munism within its borders, if it
sees fit to do so.
(This I took to be an echo of
the talks lie had had with the
Egpytian field marshal in t lie pre
ceding days about Nasser's treat
ment of his local Communists.)
But, nevertheless, after these
quieting statements, he said

rather solemnly, "we" — the
Communists —will cause you,
the Americans, more "trouble"
each year.
How? The trouble for the West
will come from the continual
I "multiplication of benefits" re
i reived by the people of the Soviet
| states. At present, he said, the
i United States is the richest and
J most productive country in the
world. But il is living "the last
I years of its greatness."
Why? Because shortly the So
; viet Union will surpass the United
States in productivity per capita.
