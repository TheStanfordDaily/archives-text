[Ourl hallowed halls have long
been ringing with the cries of
nonconformity. Nonconformity
of thought, of mindâ€”of anything.
Being a confirmed conformist
| this distresses me greatly. . . .
Already many of our larger
| colleges and universities are filled
| to the brim with seedy looking,
I beat generation type noneonform
| ists who . . . rebel against any
thing accepted, live with extrava
gant absurdity. . . .
Now I would like to turn my
thoughts ... to the other 99
i 44/100 per cent of the world. The
I world of the conformist. He goes
through life unhappy. ... lie is
; unhappy because he is part of a
vast group of people who are also
unhappy.
They are supposedly unhappy
because they are not recognized
and because they mouth the
thoughts of others. The fact that
they think basically what others
think has nothing to do with it.
Well, 1 think basically the same
things that other people think,
1 conform, and J am blissfully
happy. . . .
Yet 1 suppose I must concede
that nonconformity is necessary
in this world for a certain degree
of change. Yet 1 wonder if Hegel,
Freud and Pasteur were going to
our school whether or not they
would have a belt in the back.
