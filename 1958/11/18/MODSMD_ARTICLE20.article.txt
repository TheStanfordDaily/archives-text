# THE 						Finish Line

Add Four Teams, Mix Thoroughly
So now it's down to the final week of Pacific Coast Conference
football action and time to decide whose turn it is to get killed in the
Rose Bowl.
It's going to be quote a scramble come Saturday night when the
representatives I'rum each school have to start sorting out the mass
of teams that will be tied for the top spot.
Naturally Stanford's a cinch to beat Cal maybe—and the odds
are riding for Oregon State, Washington State and USC also to win
I'CC closers. So that leaves us with four clubs, each having a pair
of defeats.
Where do we start? Well could look and see that Cal is 2-1
against the other three top clubs, USC is likewise, but Oregon State
and Washington State are 1-2. So that leaves Cal and the Trojans,
but Cal beat the Trojans so Cal goes.
Or we could look to the record against Big Ten clubs. Cal takes
gas fast, because of that 32-12 beauty against a weak Michigan Stale
team. Washington state looks good in this kind of comparison since
it lost to strong Northwestern just 29-28.
USC also has a mere one-point loss on its record against the Big
Ten but that was a 20-19 affair against what has proven to be a
thoroughly miserable Michigan team. Then there's Oregon State
and it didn't even play anybody from the Big Ten this year.
Funny thing is, Washington and UCLA were the only Coast teams
1o get a victory against ihe Midwesterners this year, and they're both
down in the league doldrums, along with a team from the Buy Area.
Well, off these scores, WSC looks like it might be the best bet to
throw in the arena against lowa.
Another way to look at the situation is to see how consistent each
team has been. Starting with WSC, it seems that the Cougars are
either great or terrible. Their games against Stanford and Cal show
that.
Oregon State is somewhat along the same lines, except that
they've looked terrible when losing and only average when winning.
They were really bad against Troy and Wyoming, but didn't have it
at all easy getting past the Indians and Bears.
Then there's I'SC. It's had a couple of good wins OSC and Stan
ford and has lost three on conversions. Troy has yet to look really
bad.
Who's left? Cal. They've been all over the place—one-sided losses,
squeaker losses, squeaker wins, one-sided wins. As Joe Kapp goes,
so goes < al.
At any rate, it's impossible to get a clear-cut choice here, except
to the extent that Oregon State looks the worst of the four.
Perhaps a look at size would be revealing. Seems that Big Ten
teams usually come on strong after the West Coasters have run out
of gas late in Ihe game. USC fills the bill best here. Troy has the
big line and fair depth maybe it could stand up better against the
llawkeyes.
This whole examination might actually be sort of silly. The way
upsets have gone this year, all four will probably lose this weekend
and Cal will go to tlie Bowl—its pair of losses the fewest in the
conference.
Not Had, for Out-of-Scasoii
Time for the weekly look at the foot sports—and this time we'll
take a gander at some of the out-of-season marks that l'ayton Jordan
and Jim Terrill's men have been turning in on the Angell Field oval.
Dan Moore, a frosh broad-jumper, got off a not-bad 21-10'4 leap
a couple of weeks ago. Pie's the prep record-holder in Oregon at a
fraction under 21 feet. Jim Backstrand, who figures to be top man
for Sninford in the javelin, is out over 200 feet in his initial tosses.
Dave Merchant surprised everyone with a 13-0 pole vault effort—
and he cleared it on his first try. Soph Jeff Evans also surprised with
a I:58.5 half-mile, just a tenth behind Ernie C'unliffe.
Of course this smattering of marks doesn't sound like anything
world beating when compared with last spring, but don't forget that
the season is still five months away. Looks promising.
Applied Psychology
What's ihe best way to relax from tension before your team
goes onto the field for 1 its game? Why, go watch another game. At
least that's what Jack Curtice and Andy Everest did for a short time
Saturday morning before the Cards met Oregon State.
Curtice and Everest whipped over to the Stanford practice field
to watch their sons in action for a Palo Alto Pop Warner League
team that was meeting a club from their old stamping grounds in
Utah. .
These kid teams- all 12 and under- had a darned good game, too,
as the I lev won, 211. If the Stanford scouts are on the ball, they'll
jot down the name of whoever it was that was playing right end for
Utah. The kid's great sure hands, excellent speed, good size. Won
der how his grades are.
The refs in this contest were even good—all recruited from Pete
KmHovic's officiating class. Just one question, though—why did
referee Mike Magce trip over his own feet every time he ran upfield?

ripped Cornell, 32-15.

referee Mike Magce trip over his own feet every time he ran upfield?

Add Four Teams, Mix Thoroughly
So now it's down to the final week of Pacific Coast Conference
football action and time to decide whose turn it is to get killed in the
Rose Bowl.
It's going to be quote a scramble come Saturday night when the
representatives I'rum each school have to start sorting out the mass
of teams that will be tied for the top spot.
Naturally Stanford's a cinch to beat Cal maybe—and the odds
are riding for Oregon State, Washington State and USC also to win
I'CC closers. So that leaves us with four clubs, each having a pair
of defeats.
Where do we start? Well could look and see that Cal is 2-1
against the other three top clubs, USC is likewise, but Oregon State
and Washington State are 1-2. So that leaves Cal and the Trojans,
but Cal beat the Trojans so Cal goes.
Or we could look to the record against Big Ten clubs. Cal takes
gas fast, because of that 32-12 beauty against a weak Michigan Stale
team. Washington state looks good in this kind of comparison since
it lost to strong Northwestern just 29-28.
USC also has a mere one-point loss on its record against the Big
Ten but that was a 20-19 affair against what has proven to be a
thoroughly miserable Michigan team. Then there's Oregon State
and it didn't even play anybody from the Big Ten this year.
Funny thing is, Washington and UCLA were the only Coast teams
1o get a victory against ihe Midwesterners this year, and they're both
down in the league doldrums, along with a team from the Buy Area.
Well, off these scores, WSC looks like it might be the best bet to
throw in the arena against lowa.
Another way to look at the situation is to see how consistent each
team has been. Starting with WSC, it seems that the Cougars are
either great or terrible. Their games against Stanford and Cal show
that.
Oregon State is somewhat along the same lines, except that
they've looked terrible when losing and only average when winning.
They were really bad against Troy and Wyoming, but didn't have it
at all easy getting past the Indians and Bears.
Then there's I'SC. It's had a couple of good wins OSC and Stan
ford and has lost three on conversions. Troy has yet to look really
bad.
Who's left? Cal. They've been all over the place—one-sided losses,
squeaker losses, squeaker wins, one-sided wins. As Joe Kapp goes,
so goes < al.
At any rate, it's impossible to get a clear-cut choice here, except
to the extent that Oregon State looks the worst of the four.
Perhaps a look at size would be revealing. Seems that Big Ten
teams usually come on strong after the West Coasters have run out
of gas late in Ihe game. USC fills the bill best here. Troy has the
big line and fair depth maybe it could stand up better against the
llawkeyes.
This whole examination might actually be sort of silly. The way
upsets have gone this year, all four will probably lose this weekend
and Cal will go to tlie Bowl—its pair of losses the fewest in the
conference.
Not Had, for Out-of-Scasoii
Time for the weekly look at the foot sports—and this time we'll
take a gander at some of the out-of-season marks that l'ayton Jordan
and Jim Terrill's men have been turning in on the Angell Field oval.
Dan Moore, a frosh broad-jumper, got off a not-bad 21-10'4 leap
a couple of weeks ago. Pie's the prep record-holder in Oregon at a
fraction under 21 feet. Jim Backstrand, who figures to be top man
for Sninford in the javelin, is out over 200 feet in his initial tosses.
Dave Merchant surprised everyone with a 13-0 pole vault effort—
and he cleared it on his first try. Soph Jeff Evans also surprised with
a I:58.5 half-mile, just a tenth behind Ernie C'unliffe.
Of course this smattering of marks doesn't sound like anything
world beating when compared with last spring, but don't forget that
the season is still five months away. Looks promising.
Applied Psychology
What's ihe best way to relax from tension before your team
goes onto the field for 1 its game? Why, go watch another game. At
least that's what Jack Curtice and Andy Everest did for a short time
Saturday morning before the Cards met Oregon State.
Curtice and Everest whipped over to the Stanford practice field
to watch their sons in action for a Palo Alto Pop Warner League
team that was meeting a club from their old stamping grounds in
Utah. .

Of course this smattering of marks doesn't sound like anything
world beating when compared with last spring, but don't forget that
the season is still five months away. Looks promising.

What's ihe best way to relax from tension before your team
goes onto the field for 1 its game? Why, go watch another game. At
least that's what Jack Curtice and Andy Everest did for a short time
Saturday morning before the Cards met Oregon State.
Curtice and Everest whipped over to the Stanford practice field
to watch their sons in action for a Palo Alto Pop Warner League
team that was meeting a club from their old stamping grounds in
Utah. .
These kid teams- all 12 and under- had a darned good game, too,
as the I lev won, 211. If the Stanford scouts are on the ball, they'll
jot down the name of whoever it was that was playing right end for
Utah. The kid's great sure hands, excellent speed, good size. Won
der how his grades are.
The refs in this contest were even good—all recruited from Pete
KmHovic's officiating class. Just one question, though—why did
referee Mike Magce trip over his own feet every time he ran upfield?

like this might have legitimately appeared in Monday's Dartmouth
paper. Seem that Crouthaniel, the sports editor of the paper, gained
1 10 yards on 15 carries and scored two touchdowns as the Indians
ripped Cornell, 32-15.

Add Four Teams, Mix Thoroughly
So now it's down to the final week of Pacific Coast Conference
football action and time to decide whose turn it is to get killed in the
Rose Bowl.
It's going to be quote a scramble come Saturday night when the
representatives I'rum each school have to start sorting out the mass
of teams that will be tied for the top spot.
Naturally Stanford's a cinch to beat Cal maybe—and the odds
are riding for Oregon State, Washington State and USC also to win
I'CC closers. So that leaves us with four clubs, each having a pair
of defeats.
Where do we start? Well could look and see that Cal is 2-1
against the other three top clubs, USC is likewise, but Oregon State
and Washington State are 1-2. So that leaves Cal and the Trojans,
but Cal beat the Trojans so Cal goes.
Or we could look to the record against Big Ten clubs. Cal takes
gas fast, because of that 32-12 beauty against a weak Michigan Stale
team. Washington state looks good in this kind of comparison since
it lost to strong Northwestern just 29-28.
USC also has a mere one-point loss on its record against the Big
Ten but that was a 20-19 affair against what has proven to be a
thoroughly miserable Michigan team. Then there's Oregon State
and it didn't even play anybody from the Big Ten this year.
Funny thing is, Washington and UCLA were the only Coast teams
1o get a victory against ihe Midwesterners this year, and they're both
down in the league doldrums, along with a team from the Buy Area.
Well, off these scores, WSC looks like it might be the best bet to
throw in the arena against lowa.
Another way to look at the situation is to see how consistent each
team has been. Starting with WSC, it seems that the Cougars are
either great or terrible. Their games against Stanford and Cal show
that.
Oregon State is somewhat along the same lines, except that
they've looked terrible when losing and only average when winning.
They were really bad against Troy and Wyoming, but didn't have it
at all easy getting past the Indians and Bears.
Then there's I'SC. It's had a couple of good wins OSC and Stan
ford and has lost three on conversions. Troy has yet to look really
bad.
Who's left? Cal. They've been all over the place—one-sided losses,
squeaker losses, squeaker wins, one-sided wins. As Joe Kapp goes,
so goes < al.
At any rate, it's impossible to get a clear-cut choice here, except
to the extent that Oregon State looks the worst of the four.
Perhaps a look at size would be revealing. Seems that Big Ten
teams usually come on strong after the West Coasters have run out
of gas late in Ihe game. USC fills the bill best here. Troy has the
big line and fair depth maybe it could stand up better against the
llawkeyes.
This whole examination might actually be sort of silly. The way
upsets have gone this year, all four will probably lose this weekend
and Cal will go to tlie Bowl—its pair of losses the fewest in the
conference.
Not Had, for Out-of-Scasoii
Time for the weekly look at the foot sports—and this time we'll
take a gander at some of the out-of-season marks that l'ayton Jordan
and Jim Terrill's men have been turning in on the Angell Field oval.
Dan Moore, a frosh broad-jumper, got off a not-bad 21-10'4 leap
a couple of weeks ago. Pie's the prep record-holder in Oregon at a
fraction under 21 feet. Jim Backstrand, who figures to be top man
for Sninford in the javelin, is out over 200 feet in his initial tosses.
Dave Merchant surprised everyone with a 13-0 pole vault effort—
and he cleared it on his first try. Soph Jeff Evans also surprised with
a I:58.5 half-mile, just a tenth behind Ernie C'unliffe.
Of course this smattering of marks doesn't sound like anything
