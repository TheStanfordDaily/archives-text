# Peterson Only Doubtful Starter for Big Game
## 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
11 co-captain Bob Peterson pulls through this week and hops back
into shape by Saturday, Stanford will send a 100 per cent healthy
squad into Pig Came 1958 this Saturday at Berkeley.
For Stanford this year this is news, and it comes at just the right
time. For the Cards would like nothing better than to throw a inon-

key wrench into the gears of the I
Pasadena bound Kappmobile. And j
Stanford will have to be at full!
strength to do it.
Right now Peterson is a "very
slim maybe" according to Tribe
trainer Connie Jarvis. He strained
his knee very seriously against
the Oregon State Beavers Satur
day and it is feared that he may
have dislocated it. The tough
guard has been told to stiff-leg it
until Wednesday, and then the
doctors will return the final vcr-
J diet.
No Other Serious Ills
Beyond Peterson, though, the
Cards came out of the Beaver loss
with no other serious injuries. I
Doug Dick and Eric Protiva sus
tained injuries to old hurts, but
nothing serious. Protiva's was to
an old hip-pointer, Dick's to his
leg .Both will go full steam all
! week.
Guard Russ Steele banged up
his shoulder a bit, and halfback
Jim Byrer came out of Saturday
with a charley horse, but these
were minor, and they spell the
total of Stanford's injuries.
Meanwhile, old injuries are
healing and these boys will be
back in top shape come Big
Game: halfbacks Rick McMillen
and John Bond, a team of half
backs who were so important in
spilling the Washington Huskies
earlier in ihe season.
Picture Day
Yesterday was picture day in
the Stanfoid camp and the In
dians posed for a few and
watched a few. Photographers
met the Indians on the Stadium
i turf in the afternoon for the an
nual pre Big Game picture day,
and following the glory hour the
squad retired to the picture room
to watch movies of the Cal-Wash
ington tussle and hear the scout
ing report prepared by Dutch
Fell ring.
"We must play Hie best ground

game we've played all season,"
Pehring told the Indians. "One of
the sure-fire ways to win ibis
game will be to minimize the
number of plays Cal runs."
"We know they'll score some,"
the scout said, "but we've got to
hold them back."
Fehrlng was impressed with
ihe stellar Cal quarterback Joe
Kapp. "He's been underrated as
a defensive player," Fell ring not
ed. "But he does everything well;
he's the best all-around back I've
seen this year."
