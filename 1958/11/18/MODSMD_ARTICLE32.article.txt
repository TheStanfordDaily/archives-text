Hello again...
Thanks for the long chatty letter

Daddy says you've vastly improved;
it's such a pleasure to get some

complaints about your allowance!
I knew you'd love your Cellini
Bronze lipstick . . . but honestly,
dear. I don't see how you can let
every girl in the house try it on!
If you think I'm going to buy you

going to do my nails to match? This
from the man ''ho doesn't even

Now my nails look like sparkling
jewels-and with my new cham

Cellini Brovie lipstick. 11l be a

one sends love. in spite of your on
glamorous nails, cojxxiaily mc ...
