# Cal Men Caught Decorating' Campus
## Full Penalty 
### 
Tin; past Fk\\ ukkks we Jiavc been str«»n«il\ advocating a build
up of school spirit. \\ c have recognized that such spirit takes
nian> forms—not only loyally to a football team in a stadium.
lint one of the forms this spirit docs NOT take is malicious
vandalism such as that exhibited here and on the Cal campus
over the week end.
To indulge in such childish—and expensive—antics docs not
denote lovalt\ to a school, rather the opposite. As one Univer
sity of California official put it. "We're ashamed to have our
students involved in such an act."
And well lliev should be: for to have their students involved
in such a destructive project mars more than the face of Hoover
Tower.
Stanford does not conic oil cleanly in the week end's activi
ties either. W bile the attempt to saw down the goal posts in
California's .Memorial Stadium was not successful, as was the
paint job on the Stanford campus, if it had been, the damage
could have been quite extensive.
On the surface these "pranks" tna\ seem humorous, espe
ciall\ the goal post attempt (it usually comes down aflrr the
game), but in realilv ibex are vandalism especially unbecoming
to students of respected universities.
We urge the judicial Councils of the t\\o universities, before
■whom the offenders will appear, to '"throw the book" at their
respective students. Such activities should not be even indirectly
sanctioned (as bv a sentence), and we urge the fullest
application of the penalties against the would-be pranksters.
