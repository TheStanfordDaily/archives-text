# Lights Out: Farm Fuss

ii
Big Game spirit has arrived!
Or, at least for 20 Stanford men,
it has arrived. These were the 20
who charged valiantly to the Col
lar to defend the Axe when cam
pus power went off about 12:40
a.m. Monday.
Fearing for the safety of the
Big Game trophy, newly mounted
in its Cellar case, the 20—mostly
Wilbur frosh whipped off to the
Cellar, ready to take on all of
Cal.
A campus policeman, fearing a
raid from Berkeley when he saw
the charging horde, was heard to
exclaim, "OK, fellows, where are
you from . . . Stanford? OK."
Inside the Cellar, the Axe slept
on serenely, unaware of the fuss
made over it.
Meanwhile, the power failure
touched off vocal raids on Bran
ner and Stern by the civ-midterm
fatigued frosh men. Three hun
dred milled in front of the frosh
girls' dorm, then turned attention
to Stern.
After a 10- to 13-minute black
out, the lights came on and the
fuss appeared over. But when at
1:02 the power went back off, the
Wilburites marched on Stern,
complete with torches.
While opposing forces alter
nated yelling unprintables, packs
of frosh men played like it was
East L.A., prowling the area in
cars.
Sanity returned shortly after
1, as lights began to filcker on.
