# Big Game Non-Aggression Pact Violated by Students
## 
### Rita Robison Associate Editor 
Student leaders and the Deans
of Students of Stanford and Cal
reached an agreement last Friday
afternoon on a mutual non-ag
gression paet for the Big Game
weekend. The pact was short
lived.
A paint-spattered Hoover Tow
er, with an estimated $2000 worth
of damage, is mute testimony to
the ineffectiveness of official
agreements not honored by indi
viduals of both schools.
Cal's Dean
Berkeley's Dean of Students
Hurford E. Stone and student
body president William A. Strick
lin, and Stanford's Dean 11. Don
ald Winbigler and John A. Bohn
agreed "to avoid any occurrence
that might endanger friendly re
lations" between the two univer
sities and "to avoid any possible
damage to property of either."
As representatives of their re
spect iv e student bodies t hey
wished "to declare publicly our
intention to maintain the tradi
tion of good sportsmanship that
has grown up around the Big
Game."
Individual Awareness
They resolved "to encourage in
any manner possible individual
awareness of tho responsibility of
membership in our respective stu
dent body organizations and to
make |thcm| conscious of the im
plications and serious conse
quences resulting from intercam
pus raids."
They agreed "that in the event
of the violation of the spirit of
1 his agreement by members of
our respective student bodies, dis
cipline for the violation shall de
volve upon the University, of the
violator."
Defacers in Custody
The defaecrs of Hoover Tower
are in the custody of the Univer
sity of California and will go be
fore Cal's Men's Judicial Council.
Stanford students will appear
before our Men's .Judicial Council
for their attempt to saw down
Cal's goal posts Saturday morn
ing.
The spirit of the non-aggression
pact has unfortunately not been
honored by individuals of both
schools. Bohn commented that
representatives of the student
body "cannot legislate the respon
sibility for our traditional good
sportsmanship.
Credit or Contempt
"ft remains individually with
each Stanford student. Remem
ber if you will that property dam
age, for whatever reason, has se
rious consequences, and that any
our s-tiident can by his actions
equally bring credit or contempt
tn the rest and to Stanford Uni
versity."
Big Game week is yet in its in
fancy, and student spirit on both i
campuses will run high. The non-!
aggression agreement, though vi-i
olated, is still in effect. It is up
to each student to give it mean
ing.
