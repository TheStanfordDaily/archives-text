# Russia Blasts 'Spies' in Berlin
## 
### 
BERLIN (A') —The Soviet Union Tuesday stepped up the campaign
to get the Allies out of West Berlin. The Soviets accused the United
States of using the isolated, old German capital as a spy center.
The charges came on the heels of a warning in Moscow by Pravda,
the Soviet Communist party newspaper, that the Soviet Union will

end the four-power occupation of
Berlin—with or without Western
consent.
In the past week, the Soviet Un
ion has repeatedly claimed the
Allies have violated the spirit of
occupation agreements and should
get out of YVest Berlin, an island
inside Soviet-run East Germany.
Russia Fulling Out
Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev said last week the Soviets
are giving up their occupation
rights in East Berlin and advised
the Allies to do the same.
The idea was developed Tues
day at a 2la-hour news confer
ence, attended by 300 Western
and Communist newsmen.
A reporter for Tass, the Soviet
news agency, asked what anti-So
viet activities were being carried
out in West Berlin.
Spy Reports
The officer, I. V. Ovchinnikov,
got up in the glare of Communist
television lights and charged:
"The territory of West Berlin is
being used for subversive activi
ties against the German Demo
cratic East Germany and the So
viet Union."
The U.S. mission in Berlin de
clined immediate comment.
