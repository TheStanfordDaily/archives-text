# Have Dime... Will Waste?

### 
Oh, woe is the Stanford eat
ing club man!
Given th e acknowledged
problem of "the ratio," he was
additionally plagued Monday
night by the absence of tele
phone service. Of the "lucky
seven" clubs", nary a one had a
functioning telephone Monday
evening and for the greater
part of Tuesday.
In short, he couldn't have
gotten himself a date, even if
he wanted to, without shelling
out the almighty dime to place
a pay-phone call.
The Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company office in
Palo Alio diagnosed Ihe ills of
the eating clubs' phones as
"cable trouble."
