UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (/P)—
The Soviet Union submitted a
new proposal on outer 1 space to
the United Nalions Tuesday. It
went a long way toward meeting
the position of the United States
and breaking an East-West dead
lock.
Soviel Deputy Foreign Minister
Valerian Zorin placed the new
proposal before the 81-nation Po
litical Committee. It had these
important elements:
t. It dropped previous Soviet
demands that abolition of U.S.
overseas military bases be tied in
with the question of international
control of outer space.
2. It proposed the creation of
an 11-nation study group to pre
pare the groundwork for a per
manent UN committee for co-op
eration in the study of outer
space for peaceful purposes.
This came very close to a pro
posal being pushed by the United
States, Britain and 18 other pow
ers for creation of a special com
mitter to study all aspects of this
problem.
