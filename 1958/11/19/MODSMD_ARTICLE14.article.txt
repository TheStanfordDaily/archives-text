# Gaieties Entertains but Lacks Polish
## 
### Mary Lon McKinley 
What the 1958 Ra m's I lead ' > i
etics lacks in polish, it makes tip
for in good music, catchy lyrics
and several clover and hilarious
sketches written by the director,
Mark Hammer.
Music director Greg MeCurdy
has produced some good tunes
and lyrics that add up to better
than • usual music in the 17-act
show, which opened Tuesday
night in Memorial Auditorium.
following a well-balanced and
snappy overture, in which the or
chestra. sounded its best, the cur
tain came up on a lively opener.
"We're fresh, we're young, we're

eager,'' sang the chorus; and they
were.
Although the group lacked co
ordination in spots, the lyrics
came through strongly, and six
solo dancers did a good job with
choreographer Niki Record's rou
tine, putting a catchy start on the
two-hour show.
Satyrs Star
Three satyrs, Tuie Kinxolving.
Bob Lchrer and Tom Bissinger,
made a hit each time 'hey ap
pea red, giving Hie show an added
boost while s e t s were being
changed behind the curtain.
Fxcellent characterizations by
Kvolvn Dees and Ken Kelsey, who

played Skaggie and Hiu Paps re
spectively, and a flawless per
formance by an "audio-oscillator"
horn, ensured the success of
"Hamster and a Hot Libido."
Also highlighting the well pre
sented first act of Gaieties was
"Los (thou Is." The intricate lyrics
of the "Ghoulbert and Sullivan"
operetta were hard to catch at
times, bul MeCurdy's catchy tunes
were well executed, wilh several
choruses standing out in par
ticular.
Unfortunately, (lie second halt
of the show wasn't up to the par
sel by the first half.
Several cute and good fill-in

songs, better than Ia s t year's,
helped the art along, however.
"f,ad and Lassitude" stood out in
particular, with soloists KinsoJv
ing, still as a satyr, and Carol Me-
Kauna, as the at-first unwilling
lass.
Spoof Hops
The spoof on the unrehearsed
qui/, show, although containing
some clever lines, seemed to bo h
hii 100 unrehearsed and was not
put over well.
"Mayhem in Marakesh," after
the first scene of uncoordinated
activity, developed into a fairly
neat dance routine between the
principles. George Smith and
Elaine Seagrave. Smith's agility
and the back-stage narration wpre
the only tilings that distinguished
the act.
iVrnetiee Needed
l*Yom here on. lack of practice
showed heavily in the numbers.
With clever lines showing room
for improvement. "Sick, Sick.
Sick" needed quicker pickups. The
interspersed sketches were, for
the most part, amusing especial
ly the disillusioned, red-hot Stan
ford man -but they moved slowly.
Sadly enough. Ihe finale looked
very sloppy compared to the open
er. Saluting and satirizing the
'30's, ' 10's hnd '50'«, the last num
ber jusl didn't come through; but
the show was saved from a crash
ending by a once-again snappy
and enthusiastic reprise of the
opening song.
All in all. Gaieties is well worth
seeing. Performances continue to
night at 8:15, Thursday at D:l5
and Friday at 8:30.

spectively, and a flawless per
formance by an "audio-oscillator"
horn, ensured the success of
"Hamster and a Hot Libido."
Also highlighting the well pre
sented first act of Gaieties was
"Los (thou Is." The intricate lyrics
of the "Ghoulbert and Sullivan"
operetta were hard to catch at
times, bul MeCurdy's catchy tunes
were well executed, wilh several
choruses standing out in par
ticular.
Unfortunately, (lie second halt
of the show wasn't up to the par
sel by the first half.
Several cute and good fill-in

songs, better than Ia s t year's,
helped the art along, however.
"f,ad and Lassitude" stood out in
particular, with soloists KinsoJv
ing, still as a satyr, and Carol Me-
Kauna, as the at-first unwilling
lass.
Spoof Hops
The spoof on the unrehearsed
qui/, show, although containing
some clever lines, seemed to bo h
hii 100 unrehearsed and was not
put over well.
"Mayhem in Marakesh," after
the first scene of uncoordinated
activity, developed into a fairly
neat dance routine between the
principles. George Smith and
Elaine Seagrave. Smith's agility
and the back-stage narration wpre
the only tilings that distinguished
the act.
iVrnetiee Needed
l*Yom here on. lack of practice
showed heavily in the numbers.
With clever lines showing room
for improvement. "Sick, Sick.
Sick" needed quicker pickups. The
interspersed sketches were, for
the most part, amusing especial
ly the disillusioned, red-hot Stan
ford man -but they moved slowly.
Sadly enough. Ihe finale looked
very sloppy compared to the open
er. Saluting and satirizing the
'30's, ' 10's hnd '50'«, the last num
ber jusl didn't come through; but
the show was saved from a crash
ending by a once-again snappy
and enthusiastic reprise of the
opening song.
All in all. Gaieties is well worth
seeing. Performances continue to
night at 8:15, Thursday at D:l5
and Friday at 8:30.

the only tilings that distinguished
the act.

l*Yom here on. lack of practice
showed heavily in the numbers.
With clever lines showing room
for improvement. "Sick, Sick.
Sick" needed quicker pickups. The
interspersed sketches were, for
the most part, amusing especial
ly the disillusioned, red-hot Stan
ford man -but they moved slowly.
Sadly enough. Ihe finale looked
very sloppy compared to the open
er. Saluting and satirizing the
'30's, ' 10's hnd '50'«, the last num
ber jusl didn't come through; but
the show was saved from a crash
ending by a once-again snappy
and enthusiastic reprise of the
opening song.
All in all. Gaieties is well worth
seeing. Performances continue to
night at 8:15, Thursday at D:l5
and Friday at 8:30.
