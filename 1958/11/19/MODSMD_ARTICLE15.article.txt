# Borrowed Good Humor Abounds in New Chappie
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Well, it must be admitted. The Chappie does turn oul some good
humor once in a while, and this issue (with some exceptions) is an
example.
To got the exceptions taken care of, we will first point to the Old
Boy's comment which he allows is "somewhat the long way around."

We don't see his reasoning that
going the "long way around" nec
essarily lets one enter by a "more
illuminating gate" and to refer
to this gate as Chappie humor,
well, now, a rational reader will
disagree with the Ancient One.
Frankenstein's monster ap
pears on the first few pages.
Again, this is the long way
around. It is dubbed a playlet—
in other words a short play.
CTwould be better dubbed a shot
play.)
We hate to see the traditional
"Moom Pictures" replaced just
so the Chappie can take aim at
The Daily, but then, these jabs,
too, are traditional (on both
sides).
However, enough of the nega
tive. As noted above, the discern
ing reader can find, for a change,
some clever and refreshing mate
rial this month. "This shell in a
Monthnut" is a good example, and
the reader will see why.
As to today's sales (35 cents on
the corners of Quad), the Old Boy
need never fear, for a tool—er,
fool — and his money are soon
parted (see page 15).
