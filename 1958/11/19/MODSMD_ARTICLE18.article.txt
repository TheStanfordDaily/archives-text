# Stanford ‘Girls'
## 
### 
I\ the T.AST analysis, they are "girls" and not "women." For
thus they are treated and thus they should he named.
Whatever you wish to eall them, the feminine undergraduates
at Stanford are not allowed to live off-campus and they are not
allowed to go above the first floor of men's residences.
These rules have been with us a long time, but recently the
latter one in particular became ridiculous. A Stanford "girl' was
called before Women's Council and put on probation because she
was helping her boy friend wallpaper his room on the second
floor of his fraternity house.
We do not want to make an example of this particular "girl."
but her case has led ua to challenge the spirit of "upstairs regu
lation."
The rule, says: ". . . o woman way enter the down
stairs social area of a man's residence. 7he act of enter
inr this area is in itself neither acceptable nor unaccept
able; it becomes unacceptable when a woman's conduct
is inconsistent with the Fundamental Standard.'
This is the regulation which one highly-placed University offi
cial has called, "THE BIGGEST PIECE OF GOBBI-EDYGOOK
I HAVE EVER READ." We agree.
When this regulation came up for discussion last spring it was
defended on the grounds that it protected the privacy of men's
living groups.
This reasoning went down the drain after the above-mentioned
Council case when numerous fraternities applied to Social Coordi
nating Board to declare permanent open houses, seven days a
week, thereby insuring themselves the privilege of having women
above the first floor if they so desired.
7lie defenders rapidly changed their argument. Sud
denly the rule became a protection. not for men, but for
women. It uas bbitantly immoral for women to go above
the first floor of a man's residence if there was not an
adequate chape rone, Open houses are to be alb need one,
two, maybe even three in one week —but, my goodness
gracious, not seven.
Where does the line of immorality fall—after two unchaper
oned open houses a week, or after three, or after four?
We maintain that immorality is not at all concerned in going
up the stairs that lead to the second floor of a men's residence.
Immorality does not depend on location—it is a matter of action
and attitude.
Men are permitted to live off-campus and women are permitted
in their apartments off-campus. Is going into a man s room im
moral on campus and moral off it?
The concluding argument of the defenders is that we might
offend parents and alumni. We might scare off their GIFTS.
Beallv, we want to know how many millionaire dowagers there
are all set to build another women's residence for Stanford who
would be scared off because "girls" were allowed to help boy
friends paper their rooms.
The strange, part of this entire controversy is that the
rules are made and interpreted by Stanford women them
selves—or, at least let us say, they ivere made by Stan
ford women in some bygone age and are. "reviewed" by
a small committee of the current crop. H e direct this
editorial to those overconscientious moralists who are so
zealous in their adherence to imagined "moral laws and
Stanford regulations that they forger the spirit of true
morality.
We would like to hear from some of these supposedly puritan
alumni and parents: Is it really immoral to go to the second floor
of a man's living group? Is it immoral in the "outside world,"
or just at Stanford? Tell us, mothers and fathers—does this truly
shock you?
A man's living group at Stanford is his residence away from
home, and he should have the privilege of inviting whom he
wishes there, be it a mtn or a woman. But perhaps that is really
the trouble: Stanford females are not "women," after all, but only
"girls." And "girls,' we suppose, have not the privileges of women.
