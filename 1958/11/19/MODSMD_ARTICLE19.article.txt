# The 						Big Weekend
## 
### 
Open Letter to Freshmen:
Traditionally, it has been the
responsibility of the freshman
class at Stanford to build the
Big Game Bonfire. This bon
fire, which is in the Lagunita
lake bed, is the most important
project of the year for our
class.
Construction will be concen
trated into two days. Gathering
of the wood will begin Wednes
day morning, and actual con
struction begins Thursday
morning. Individual commit
tees have arranged to have cof
fee served to the workers by
girls from both Branner and
.Roble, and the pep band and
cheerleaders will appear at 11
p.m. Thursday. The lake bed
will be illuminated with flood
lights, and construction and
guarding will take place simul
taneously.
Wood gathering, with trucks,
is the individual responsibility
of the separate wings in Wilbur
Hall. The gathering, and all
other special committee work,
will end Thursday morning.
From this time on, we will need
the whole-hearted devotion of

every freshman in our class in
order to complete the bonfire
successfully. Every detail has
been meticulously cared for,
and the only job left for us
freshmen is to get out to the
lake bed and start building.
At 6:30 p.m. Friday, the bon
fire will be burned, preceded by
a school rally. Because each
freshman class is judged by the
job it does on the 1 bonfire, ours
must be the biggest, brightest
and tallest one yet.
Once the bonfire and rally
are over, the real fun for the
freshman class begins. Satur
day we will go to the biggest
game of the year, and Saturday
night the all - freshman Big
Game Dance will be held at Bay
Meadows. For our class, next
weekend will be the best until
that of the Senior Prom. Let's
start it off light with a bonfire
superior to all others. Your in
dividual efforts, as members of
the class of '62, are all that is
needed to make Friday's bon
fire a success.

class at Stanford to build the
Big Game Bonfire. This bon
fire, which is in the Lagunita
lake bed, is the most important
project of the year for our
class.
Construction will be concen
trated into two days. Gathering
of the wood will begin Wednes
day morning, and actual con
struction begins Thursday
morning. Individual commit
tees have arranged to have cof
fee served to the workers by
girls from both Branner and
.Roble, and the pep band and
cheerleaders will appear at 11
p.m. Thursday. The lake bed
will be illuminated with flood
lights, and construction and
guarding will take place simul
taneously.
Wood gathering, with trucks,
is the individual responsibility
of the separate wings in Wilbur
Hall. The gathering, and all
other special committee work,
will end Thursday morning.
From this time on, we will need
the whole-hearted devotion of

every freshman in our class in
order to complete the bonfire
successfully. Every detail has
been meticulously cared for,
and the only job left for us
freshmen is to get out to the
lake bed and start building.
At 6:30 p.m. Friday, the bon
fire will be burned, preceded by
a school rally. Because each
freshman class is judged by the
job it does on the 1 bonfire, ours
must be the biggest, brightest
and tallest one yet.
Once the bonfire and rally
are over, the real fun for the
freshman class begins. Satur
day we will go to the biggest
game of the year, and Saturday
night the all - freshman Big
Game Dance will be held at Bay
Meadows. For our class, next
weekend will be the best until
that of the Senior Prom. Let's
start it off light with a bonfire
superior to all others. Your in
dividual efforts, as members of
the class of '62, are all that is
needed to make Friday's bon
fire a success.
