Although if may at limes bo
bothersome to the intellectual to
explain his methods and precon
ceptions to the questioning lay
man. this is the only way a rap
prochement between the intellec
tual and the community will be
marie, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Philip Rhinelander told
a Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence last night.
Rhinelander contended that ex
planation is possible without su
perficiality. He defined the intel
lectual as a person whose attitude
is one of concerned investigation.
L'npopulii rity
Laying recurrent unpopularity
of the intellectual to charges of
"silliness, subversion and snob
bery," he pointed out that the in
creased demand for higher edu
cation indicates greater respect
for the intellectual.
The commanding position of sci
ence in our society makes the po
sition of the scientific intellectual
relatively secure, he went on.
Rhinelander saw the position of
the "humanist" intellectual as less
secure, however.
"One function of education," he
said, "is to raise the general level
of understanding in the commu
nity to the point where the phi
losopher, if he does descend from
his tower, may gain a general
hearing."
Moral Problems
'."he humanist intellectual's lack
of community prestige is partly
caused by his tendency to be more
concerned with investigating
methods of moral inquiry than
with the business of grappling
with actual moral problems,
Khinelander pointed out.
A philosophical vacuum results
at the precise point where the in
fellectual may seek effective an
swers to practical questions, he
emphasized.
Rhinelander acknowledged that
moral arguments arc not subject
to empirical proofs, but called the
dismissal of moral questions on
this ground "seientism."
