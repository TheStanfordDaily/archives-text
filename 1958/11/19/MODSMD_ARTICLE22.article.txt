Editor, The Daily:
I received the following letter
written by 1IR President Arden
Shenker concerning United Na
lions Week which was held Oct.
19-24. The reason here presented
is worthy of note, particularly
this week, lor it applies not only
to the IIR program, but to all
activities here at Stanford in
which students participate.
Dear John:
In reflecting on the values
of our recent United Nations
Week program, the members of
the Policy and Executive boards
of the ASSU-IIR have been dis
turbed over our inability to
reach the student body with our
program. Of course, any stu
dent association or organization
must resign itself to realizing
its principles in a watered-down
state. We are all primarily stu
dents with heavy academic re
sponsibilities.
Yet, much work was done for
the United Nations Week:
World University Service of
IIR's SIRO (Stanford Interna
tional Relief Organization) De
partment raised upwards o X
$2500 for its worthwhile,
UNESCO - oriented outlets; ex
cellent attention to the UN was
paid by The Daily with the help
of 1IR publicity personnel;
speeches, discussions, church
services, receptions, and oppor
tunities for foreign and Ameri
can students to exchange ideas
— these prevailed throughout
the week. To insure that the
work expended in the planning
and execution of these opportu
nities is worthwhile to the stu
dent body is the responsibility
of the students. As executives
we will do the planning and the
operating, but students as a
whole and individually must
chart the right direction, by vir
tue of their interests. Before
condemning any opportunity
for being worthless, one first
should have made the effort to
drain any possible element of
worth from the experience.
It is inescapable, I suggest,

Ihat mutual satisfactions liavo
for a prerequisite mutual obli
gations. 1 shall be satisfied with
the opportunities for analysis
and evaluation of United Na
tions which were made avail
able Oct. 19 24, if one student
took upon himself the responsi
bility to explore these opportu
nities. As an association of stu
dents we should consider most
important our association of
minds, upon which is built the
asociations of peoples and their
nations.

Unwarranted Space
Editor, The Daily:
We should like to protest
against the unwarranted amount
of space you devoted in the Nov.
10 issue to the so-called lack of
loyalty among Stanford students
during the USC game.
Surely the fanatical and indig
nant critics can appreciate that
with adult and knowledgeable
sports lovers support must follow
performance. Yet the letters
made no effort to appraise the
spectacle on the field when the
students were flocking out en
masse. Merely reiterating that
the coach and players are "good
chaps" is pointless — we do not
question their efforts. We do
suggest, that perhaps Stanford
students should be proud they are
more discriminating and exacting
lhan most, proud to realize that
waving feathers and shouting
one's tribal superiority even to
the ludicrously bitter end is not
necessarily a worthy show of de
votion to one's own University.
Could it be that the critics are
advocating rather sub-collegiate
and definitely sub-Stanford stand
ards of loyalty? By their own
logic, if it: is so wrong for stu
dents to express disapproval of a
game they pay to see, it is even
worse for loyalists to criticize
their own students in the Penin
sula's only morning paper!

We should like to protest
against the unwarranted amount
of space you devoted in the Nov.
10 issue to the so-called lack of
loyalty among Stanford students
during the USC game.
Surely the fanatical and indig
nant critics can appreciate that
with adult and knowledgeable
sports lovers support must follow
performance. Yet the letters
made no effort to appraise the
spectacle on the field when the
students were flocking out en
masse. Merely reiterating that
the coach and players are "good
chaps" is pointless — we do not
question their efforts. We do
suggest, that perhaps Stanford
students should be proud they are
more discriminating and exacting
lhan most, proud to realize that
waving feathers and shouting
one's tribal superiority even to
the ludicrously bitter end is not
necessarily a worthy show of de
votion to one's own University.
Could it be that the critics are
advocating rather sub-collegiate
and definitely sub-Stanford stand
ards of loyalty? By their own
logic, if it: is so wrong for stu
dents to express disapproval of a
game they pay to see, it is even
worse for loyalists to criticize
their own students in the Penin
sula's only morning paper!

I received the following letter
written by 1IR President Arden
Shenker concerning United Na
lions Week which was held Oct.
19-24. The reason here presented
is worthy of note, particularly
this week, lor it applies not only
to the IIR program, but to all
activities here at Stanford in
which students participate.
Dear John:
In reflecting on the values
of our recent United Nations
Week program, the members of
the Policy and Executive boards
of the ASSU-IIR have been dis
turbed over our inability to
reach the student body with our
program. Of course, any stu
dent association or organization
must resign itself to realizing
its principles in a watered-down
state. We are all primarily stu
dents with heavy academic re
sponsibilities.
Yet, much work was done for
the United Nations Week:
World University Service of
IIR's SIRO (Stanford Interna
tional Relief Organization) De
partment raised upwards o X
$2500 for its worthwhile,
UNESCO - oriented outlets; ex
cellent attention to the UN was
paid by The Daily with the help
of 1IR publicity personnel;
speeches, discussions, church
services, receptions, and oppor
tunities for foreign and Ameri
can students to exchange ideas
— these prevailed throughout
the week. To insure that the
work expended in the planning
and execution of these opportu
nities is worthwhile to the stu
dent body is the responsibility
of the students. As executives
we will do the planning and the
operating, but students as a
whole and individually must
chart the right direction, by vir
tue of their interests. Before
condemning any opportunity
for being worthless, one first
should have made the effort to
drain any possible element of
worth from the experience.
It is inescapable, I suggest,

Ihat mutual satisfactions liavo
for a prerequisite mutual obli
gations. 1 shall be satisfied with
the opportunities for analysis
and evaluation of United Na
tions which were made avail
able Oct. 19 24, if one student
took upon himself the responsi
bility to explore these opportu
nities. As an association of stu
dents we should consider most
important our association of
minds, upon which is built the
asociations of peoples and their
nations.
