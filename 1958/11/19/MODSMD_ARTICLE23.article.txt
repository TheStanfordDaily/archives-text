## Will System Work?

Nik it a Khrushchev's central
thesis, then, is that the Soviet
economy will in the near future
surpass ours in productivity per
capita, anil that this achievement
will cause the poor countries of
the world to turn to the Soviet
Union as an example and for ma
terial help.
I asked Mr. K. whether he be
lieved the Soviet system could be
made to work in truly backward
countries, since the system called
for a high degree ol technological
competence and also of adminis
trative efficiency.
He replied that 40 years ago
Russia was a very backward coun
try, and look what Communism
had already achieved.

[ T said, yes, much had been
j achieved, but there had been great
| Russian scientists before the Rev
| olution and that Russia was not a
i backward country compared with
many In Africa and some in Asia.
1 did not fee! he was willing
to face this somewhat specula
tive question, and lie put an end
to this discussion by insisting
that Indonesia would do much
better if it adopted the Soviet
system, and that India could
easily feed itself without limit
ing its population if it hud the
k in <1 of government and the
kind of economy which were
capable of enterprises like coil
verting the vast jungles of In
dia into arable land.
He was quiet evidently thinking
of his own grandiose plan to grow
wheat in the virgin lands of Asi
i atic Russia, and to use the fertile
i lands of the Ukraine for dairying

and vegetables and more diversi
fied crops.
But he never came to grips with
the question ol' whether such
grandiose plans could be carried
out in countries with a feudal or
a tribal order.
This led me on to China, about
which I had heard, from others in
Moscow, comments which varied
between awe and anxiety at the
rapid progress of the Chinese
Communists.
Several times before I saw Mr.
K., I had been told by Soviet citi
zens thai the Chinese rale of ad
vance toward Communism was
more rapid than the Soviet's.
I asked Mr. Iv. whether, with
the long" Soviet • <hinese Iron
tier, and with the expanding
population of China and the
comparative emptiness of Si
b e ri a, he was not concerned
about the future of Soviet-Chi
nese relations.
He indicated he had heard that
question before, and he dismissed
it with some impatience, saying
\ that those who took this view did
| not understand the nature of a so
I cialisl society,
I had heard that answer before
from others in Moscow. But when
I asked the others to explain what
| they meant, they usually answer
ed dogmatically that socialist
i slates will not, and do not, go to
war.
Mr. K. had a different line of
argument. It is that in ;i socialist
society there is no economic limit
on productivity as there is in the
i case of our farm surpluses, which
amused him considerably.
China, he said, had only begun
to explore and exploit its natural
resources. There were in northern
[China vast reserves of virgin land
| which could support a very much
larger population.
Ke that as it may, Mr. K. was
in no mood to admit that within
the Communist world there
were any of the conflicts that
have haunted the rest of the
human race since the beginning
of history.
Mr. K. has, for the most part, a
pragmatic and earthy tempera
ment, and he is not much given
to Utopian speculation. But he has
in him also the basic revolutionary
faith that a new history has been
begun, and that a Communist
man is a new kind of man. Along
with this, he has an infinite faith
lhat technology and applied sci
ence can solve all human prob
lems.

I asked Mr. K. whether he be

for a high degree ol technological

Russia was a very backward coun

had already achieved.

Several times before I saw Mr.

more rapid than the Soviet's.

comparative emptiness of Si

war.
Mr. K. had a different line of
argument. It is that in ;i socialist
society there is no economic limit
on productivity as there is in the
i case of our farm surpluses, which
amused him considerably.
China, he said, had only begun
to explore and exploit its natural
resources. There were in northern

Nik it a Khrushchev's central
thesis, then, is that the Soviet
economy will in the near future
surpass ours in productivity per
capita, anil that this achievement
will cause the poor countries of
the world to turn to the Soviet
Union as an example and for ma
terial help.
I asked Mr. K. whether he be
lieved the Soviet system could be
made to work in truly backward
countries, since the system called
for a high degree ol technological
competence and also of adminis
trative efficiency.
He replied that 40 years ago
Russia was a very backward coun
try, and look what Communism
had already achieved.

[ T said, yes, much had been
j achieved, but there had been great
| Russian scientists before the Rev
| olution and that Russia was not a
i backward country compared with
many In Africa and some in Asia.
1 did not fee! he was willing
to face this somewhat specula
tive question, and lie put an end
to this discussion by insisting
that Indonesia would do much
better if it adopted the Soviet
system, and that India could
easily feed itself without limit
ing its population if it hud the
k in <1 of government and the
kind of economy which were
capable of enterprises like coil
verting the vast jungles of In
dia into arable land.
He was quiet evidently thinking
of his own grandiose plan to grow
wheat in the virgin lands of Asi
i atic Russia, and to use the fertile
i lands of the Ukraine for dairying

and vegetables and more diversi
fied crops.
But he never came to grips with
the question ol' whether such
grandiose plans could be carried
out in countries with a feudal or
a tribal order.
This led me on to China, about
which I had heard, from others in
Moscow, comments which varied
between awe and anxiety at the
rapid progress of the Chinese
Communists.
Several times before I saw Mr.
K., I had been told by Soviet citi
zens thai the Chinese rale of ad
vance toward Communism was
more rapid than the Soviet's.
I asked Mr. Iv. whether, with
the long" Soviet • <hinese Iron
tier, and with the expanding
population of China and the
comparative emptiness of Si
b e ri a, he was not concerned
about the future of Soviet-Chi
nese relations.
He indicated he had heard that
question before, and he dismissed
it with some impatience, saying
\ that those who took this view did
| not understand the nature of a so
I cialisl society,
I had heard that answer before
from others in Moscow. But when
I asked the others to explain what
| they meant, they usually answer
ed dogmatically that socialist
i slates will not, and do not, go to
war.
Mr. K. had a different line of
argument. It is that in ;i socialist
society there is no economic limit
on productivity as there is in the
i case of our farm surpluses, which
amused him considerably.
China, he said, had only begun
to explore and exploit its natural
resources. There were in northern
[China vast reserves of virgin land
| which could support a very much
larger population.
Ke that as it may, Mr. K. was
in no mood to admit that within
the Communist world there
were any of the conflicts that
have haunted the rest of the
human race since the beginning
of history.
Mr. K. has, for the most part, a
pragmatic and earthy tempera
ment, and he is not much given
to Utopian speculation. But he has
in him also the basic revolutionary
faith that a new history has been
begun, and that a Communist
man is a new kind of man. Along
with this, he has an infinite faith
lhat technology and applied sci
ence can solve all human prob
lems.
