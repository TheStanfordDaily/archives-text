The opportunity is there for the Stanford Indians, and it's one
that hasn't presented ilself for quite a few years.
Only the Cards can stop California's lios«* Howl Kxprrss.
What a chance!
Not only is this the first time in many moons that the Tribe is
in li position in ruin the Cal I'asudena aspirations, hut it is one of
1tiu.se also rare occasions when the Tribe is the out-and-out underdog.
The role of underdog hasn't seemed to laze Cal in recenl years
. . . maybe it is Stanford's I urn for an "upsel."
If any of ilie readers can recall 1H53, they will remember that
Stanford needed a Kix Canie victory to cinch a trip to the ftose Bowl.
< ul didn't beat the Indians, but the game ended a idl-'-il tie and ush
ered C< I,A into the Bowl. The Hears have been a long time in
presenting Stanford with a chance for revenge . . . but here it is.

There is a fellow around Berke
ley who right now has the like
ness of quite a miracle man.
That's Coach I'ele i-Jliott. When
I'ele hit the Bay Area in tho win
ter al 1957 he was hailed as some
sort of a wonder boy who would
lead the Bears out of the depths
of the Pacific Coast Conference
also-rans. It seems like IJliolf
had more friends around these
parts and in Cal Alumni than
Pappy Waldorf ever hail. And lie
hadn't oven seen his team yet.
This was all nice for Pete, but
the lac! that be was supposedly
going to lead Cal to the Rose
Bowl in one year didn't exactly
make him look good when the
ll< 'ars lini lied with a one win
and nine loss record. II must be
added here that certainly Uliott
was the last man to claim that
he was going to immediately lead
(ill lo g real or heights. Ho isn't
oven saying so I his year.
The Bears didn't have the ma-

terial liist season . . . but it's Ihe
very same material I hey have this year. What happened?
Whatever ii was, lOlliott is a preity good choice for Coach of the
Year, lit' will encounter opposition from Northwestern's Ara I'ar
seghian who will probably win the honor because he is a Midwest
ei'iier but I'ele has got a preity fair case .

Cal Kaliictl in Midslream
All or all, I'arsegliian (0-9 last yoar) had his Wildcats going from
the star! of the season. Such comebacks, when a team is recl-hot from
start to f inish, are not altogether rare. But look at California's come
back . \
The Bears opened their season by losing to a "small college" foe,
College of the l'aciiic. The Tigers looked tough for a while, but since
have proven anything but invincible. Then Cal was wiped out by a
Michigan State team which since has proven to be the school's worst
iri ten years.
At this point, Cstl rallied. For a team 1o come up off the bottom
in the middle of the season especially when things looked like it
was just "another one .of those years" is a truly remarkable achieve
ment.
And Northwestern isn't going to the Rose Bowl . . . that was
settled weeks ago. The fact that Cal isn't going to the Rose Bowl
may have to be settled this week, but at least it's the last week of
the season.
Unfortunately for Pete, he will be in for more blasts if he loses
this one last game . . . and posts a respectable 6-4 record . . . than
lie got all last year after a 1-9 season. But that's the life of a foot
hall coach.
•lack Curtice can go under the pretense of "I wanted Joe Kapp
for m> West team, so I had to beat Cal to keep them out of the Hose
Bowl." That motive is as good as any.
The 11. of Kapp at Berkeley
Miracles or not, it looks like there is ONE MAN to be stopped
. . . and Cal is stopped. That man is Joe Kapp, the now-fabled Bear
quarterback, who happened to kill Stanford with his roll-out runs
in the 1956 Big Came when he was a sophomore and Cal wasn't
even running out of Ihe Splil-T.
Kapp looks like the finest Split-T master ever to strut his stuff
in the Pacific Coast Conference. One thing sure: he is the last. Joe
isn't an extraordinary faker, like some Split-T masterminds; there
are quite a few better passers on the ( oast; he isn't amazingly fast.
But he's the whole show.
Perhaps the biggest factor working in Kapp's favor is his size:
fi 2, 20fj pounds. He just doesn't come flown like any old quarterback.
And another major factor which has made the Kapp option pitch
back so effective is Ihe lightning speed of the Bear halfbacks who
benefit from Joe's abilities: Jack Hart, Hank Olguin, Wayne Crow
and . . . lately, Grover Garvin. The "Cinderella"' star of the Bear
back field, Garvin was ihe big man in the winning touchdown drives
against both CCI,A and Washington.
The end plays a key role in stopping the Split-T option, as well
as Ihe defensive wing. Stanford's success in stopping option plays
hasn't been overly spectacular this season: note the Air Force and
Southern California games.
But when it comes to defensive ends, the Cards have one of Ihe
great ones in Chris Burford. And Joel Kreis, Ihe expected choice to
open al the other flank against the Bears, was brilliant defensively
against C( I.A.
No team has been completely successful in stopping Hupp, al
1 hough Oregon State rendered him somewhat ineffective. The foot
ball player who goes for an entire season without being stopped is
an unknown animal. Kapp is about due lo be stopped.
And lost somewhere in all the Kapp-talk has been Iho California
line. 'J'he Bear forwards were in a hole from the start as their ex-
I ecled stalwarts, center Boh Chiappone and end Hon Currie, were
losi for the season. But there is no need to mention that nobody, but
nobody, gets nowhere without a line in front of him. The Bear for
wards seem to have been lost in all the flow of type that has been
.set up for Kapp.

The opportunity is there for the Stanford Indians, and it's one
that hasn't presented ilself for quite a few years.
Only the Cards can stop California's lios«* Howl Kxprrss.
What a chance!
Not only is this the first time in many moons that the Tribe is
in li position in ruin the Cal I'asudena aspirations, hut it is one of
1tiu.se also rare occasions when the Tribe is the out-and-out underdog.
The role of underdog hasn't seemed to laze Cal in recenl years
. . . maybe it is Stanford's I urn for an "upsel."
If any of ilie readers can recall 1H53, they will remember that
Stanford needed a Kix Canie victory to cinch a trip to the ftose Bowl.
< ul didn't beat the Indians, but the game ended a idl-'-il tie and ush
ered C< I,A into the Bowl. The Hears have been a long time in
presenting Stanford with a chance for revenge . . . but here it is.

There is a fellow around Berke
ley who right now has the like
ness of quite a miracle man.
That's Coach I'ele i-Jliott. When
I'ele hit the Bay Area in tho win
ter al 1957 he was hailed as some
sort of a wonder boy who would
lead the Bears out of the depths
of the Pacific Coast Conference
also-rans. It seems like IJliolf
had more friends around these
parts and in Cal Alumni than
Pappy Waldorf ever hail. And lie
hadn't oven seen his team yet.
This was all nice for Pete, but
the lac! that be was supposedly
going to lead Cal to the Rose
Bowl in one year didn't exactly
make him look good when the
ll< 'ars lini lied with a one win
and nine loss record. II must be
added here that certainly Uliott
was the last man to claim that
he was going to immediately lead
(ill lo g real or heights. Ho isn't
oven saying so I his year.
The Bears didn't have the ma-

terial liist season . . . but it's Ihe
very same material I hey have this year. What happened?
Whatever ii was, lOlliott is a preity good choice for Coach of the
Year, lit' will encounter opposition from Northwestern's Ara I'ar
seghian who will probably win the honor because he is a Midwest
ei'iier but I'ele has got a preity fair case .

Cal Kaliictl in Midslream
All or all, I'arsegliian (0-9 last yoar) had his Wildcats going from
the star! of the season. Such comebacks, when a team is recl-hot from
start to f inish, are not altogether rare. But look at California's come
back . \
The Bears opened their season by losing to a "small college" foe,
College of the l'aciiic. The Tigers looked tough for a while, but since
have proven anything but invincible. Then Cal was wiped out by a
Michigan State team which since has proven to be the school's worst
iri ten years.
At this point, Cstl rallied. For a team 1o come up off the bottom
in the middle of the season especially when things looked like it
was just "another one .of those years" is a truly remarkable achieve
ment.
And Northwestern isn't going to the Rose Bowl . . . that was
settled weeks ago. The fact that Cal isn't going to the Rose Bowl
may have to be settled this week, but at least it's the last week of
the season.
Unfortunately for Pete, he will be in for more blasts if he loses
this one last game . . . and posts a respectable 6-4 record . . . than
lie got all last year after a 1-9 season. But that's the life of a foot
hall coach.
•lack Curtice can go under the pretense of "I wanted Joe Kapp
for m> West team, so I had to beat Cal to keep them out of the Hose
Bowl." That motive is as good as any.
The 11. of Kapp at Berkeley
Miracles or not, it looks like there is ONE MAN to be stopped
. . . and Cal is stopped. That man is Joe Kapp, the now-fabled Bear
quarterback, who happened to kill Stanford with his roll-out runs
in the 1956 Big Came when he was a sophomore and Cal wasn't
even running out of Ihe Splil-T.
Kapp looks like the finest Split-T master ever to strut his stuff
in the Pacific Coast Conference. One thing sure: he is the last. Joe
isn't an extraordinary faker, like some Split-T masterminds; there
are quite a few better passers on the ( oast; he isn't amazingly fast.
But he's the whole show.
Perhaps the biggest factor working in Kapp's favor is his size:
fi 2, 20fj pounds. He just doesn't come flown like any old quarterback.
And another major factor which has made the Kapp option pitch
back so effective is Ihe lightning speed of the Bear halfbacks who
benefit from Joe's abilities: Jack Hart, Hank Olguin, Wayne Crow
and . . . lately, Grover Garvin. The "Cinderella"' star of the Bear
back field, Garvin was ihe big man in the winning touchdown drives
against both CCI,A and Washington.
The end plays a key role in stopping the Split-T option, as well
as Ihe defensive wing. Stanford's success in stopping option plays
hasn't been overly spectacular this season: note the Air Force and
Southern California games.
But when it comes to defensive ends, the Cards have one of Ihe
great ones in Chris Burford. And Joel Kreis, Ihe expected choice to
open al the other flank against the Bears, was brilliant defensively
against C( I.A.
No team has been completely successful in stopping Hupp, al
1 hough Oregon State rendered him somewhat ineffective. The foot
ball player who goes for an entire season without being stopped is
an unknown animal. Kapp is about due lo be stopped.
And lost somewhere in all the Kapp-talk has been Iho California
line. 'J'he Bear forwards were in a hole from the start as their ex-
I ecled stalwarts, center Boh Chiappone and end Hon Currie, were
losi for the season. But there is no need to mention that nobody, but
nobody, gets nowhere without a line in front of him. The Bear for
wards seem to have been lost in all the flow of type that has been
.set up for Kapp.

The opportunity is there for the Stanford Indians, and it's one
that hasn't presented ilself for quite a few years.
Only the Cards can stop California's lios«* Howl Kxprrss.
What a chance!
Not only is this the first time in many moons that the Tribe is
in li position in ruin the Cal I'asudena aspirations, hut it is one of
1tiu.se also rare occasions when the Tribe is the out-and-out underdog.
The role of underdog hasn't seemed to laze Cal in recenl years
. . . maybe it is Stanford's I urn for an "upsel."
If any of ilie readers can recall 1H53, they will remember that
Stanford needed a Kix Canie victory to cinch a trip to the ftose Bowl.
< ul didn't beat the Indians, but the game ended a idl-'-il tie and ush
ered C< I,A into the Bowl. The Hears have been a long time in
presenting Stanford with a chance for revenge . . . but here it is.

There is a fellow around Berke
ley who right now has the like
ness of quite a miracle man.
That's Coach I'ele i-Jliott. When
I'ele hit the Bay Area in tho win
ter al 1957 he was hailed as some
sort of a wonder boy who would
lead the Bears out of the depths
of the Pacific Coast Conference
also-rans. It seems like IJliolf
had more friends around these
parts and in Cal Alumni than
Pappy Waldorf ever hail. And lie
hadn't oven seen his team yet.
This was all nice for Pete, but
the lac! that be was supposedly
going to lead Cal to the Rose
Bowl in one year didn't exactly
make him look good when the
ll< 'ars lini lied with a one win
and nine loss record. II must be
added here that certainly Uliott
was the last man to claim that
he was going to immediately lead
(ill lo g real or heights. Ho isn't
oven saying so I his year.
The Bears didn't have the ma-

terial liist season . . . but it's Ihe
very same material I hey have this year. What happened?
Whatever ii was, lOlliott is a preity good choice for Coach of the
Year, lit' will encounter opposition from Northwestern's Ara I'ar
seghian who will probably win the honor because he is a Midwest
ei'iier but I'ele has got a preity fair case .

Cal Kaliictl in Midslream
All or all, I'arsegliian (0-9 last yoar) had his Wildcats going from
the star! of the season. Such comebacks, when a team is recl-hot from
start to f inish, are not altogether rare. But look at California's come
back . \
The Bears opened their season by losing to a "small college" foe,
College of the l'aciiic. The Tigers looked tough for a while, but since
have proven anything but invincible. Then Cal was wiped out by a
Michigan State team which since has proven to be the school's worst
iri ten years.
At this point, Cstl rallied. For a team 1o come up off the bottom
in the middle of the season especially when things looked like it
was just "another one .of those years" is a truly remarkable achieve
ment.
And Northwestern isn't going to the Rose Bowl . . . that was
settled weeks ago. The fact that Cal isn't going to the Rose Bowl
may have to be settled this week, but at least it's the last week of
the season.
Unfortunately for Pete, he will be in for more blasts if he loses
this one last game . . . and posts a respectable 6-4 record . . . than
lie got all last year after a 1-9 season. But that's the life of a foot
hall coach.
•lack Curtice can go under the pretense of "I wanted Joe Kapp
for m> West team, so I had to beat Cal to keep them out of the Hose
Bowl." That motive is as good as any.
The 11. of Kapp at Berkeley
Miracles or not, it looks like there is ONE MAN to be stopped
. . . and Cal is stopped. That man is Joe Kapp, the now-fabled Bear
quarterback, who happened to kill Stanford with his roll-out runs
in the 1956 Big Came when he was a sophomore and Cal wasn't
even running out of Ihe Splil-T.
Kapp looks like the finest Split-T master ever to strut his stuff
in the Pacific Coast Conference. One thing sure: he is the last. Joe
isn't an extraordinary faker, like some Split-T masterminds; there
are quite a few better passers on the ( oast; he isn't amazingly fast.
But he's the whole show.
Perhaps the biggest factor working in Kapp's favor is his size:
fi 2, 20fj pounds. He just doesn't come flown like any old quarterback.
And another major factor which has made the Kapp option pitch
back so effective is Ihe lightning speed of the Bear halfbacks who
benefit from Joe's abilities: Jack Hart, Hank Olguin, Wayne Crow
and . . . lately, Grover Garvin. The "Cinderella"' star of the Bear
back field, Garvin was ihe big man in the winning touchdown drives
against both CCI,A and Washington.
The end plays a key role in stopping the Split-T option, as well
as Ihe defensive wing. Stanford's success in stopping option plays
hasn't been overly spectacular this season: note the Air Force and
Southern California games.
But when it comes to defensive ends, the Cards have one of Ihe
great ones in Chris Burford. And Joel Kreis, Ihe expected choice to
open al the other flank against the Bears, was brilliant defensively
against C( I.A.
No team has been completely successful in stopping Hupp, al
1 hough Oregon State rendered him somewhat ineffective. The foot
ball player who goes for an entire season without being stopped is
an unknown animal. Kapp is about due lo be stopped.
And lost somewhere in all the Kapp-talk has been Iho California
line. 'J'he Bear forwards were in a hole from the start as their ex-
I ecled stalwarts, center Boh Chiappone and end Hon Currie, were
losi for the season. But there is no need to mention that nobody, but
nobody, gets nowhere without a line in front of him. The Bear for
wards seem to have been lost in all the flow of type that has been

losi for the season. But there is no need to mention that nobody, but
nobody, gets nowhere without a line in front of him. The Bear for
wards seem to have been lost in all the flow of type that has been
.set up for Kapp.

The opportunity is there for the Stanford Indians, and it's one
that hasn't presented ilself for quite a few years.
Only the Cards can stop California's lios«* Howl Kxprrss.
What a chance!
Not only is this the first time in many moons that the Tribe is
in li position in ruin the Cal I'asudena aspirations, hut it is one of
1tiu.se also rare occasions when the Tribe is the out-and-out underdog.
The role of underdog hasn't seemed to laze Cal in recenl years
. . . maybe it is Stanford's I urn for an "upsel."
If any of ilie readers can recall 1H53, they will remember that
Stanford needed a Kix Canie victory to cinch a trip to the ftose Bowl.
< ul didn't beat the Indians, but the game ended a idl-'-il tie and ush
ered C< I,A into the Bowl. The Hears have been a long time in
presenting Stanford with a chance for revenge . . . but here it is.

There is a fellow around Berke
ley who right now has the like
ness of quite a miracle man.
That's Coach I'ele i-Jliott. When
I'ele hit the Bay Area in tho win
ter al 1957 he was hailed as some
sort of a wonder boy who would
lead the Bears out of the depths
of the Pacific Coast Conference
also-rans. It seems like IJliolf
had more friends around these
parts and in Cal Alumni than
Pappy Waldorf ever hail. And lie
hadn't oven seen his team yet.
This was all nice for Pete, but
the lac! that be was supposedly
going to lead Cal to the Rose
Bowl in one year didn't exactly
make him look good when the
ll< 'ars lini lied with a one win
and nine loss record. II must be
added here that certainly Uliott
was the last man to claim that
he was going to immediately lead
(ill lo g real or heights. Ho isn't
oven saying so I his year.
The Bears didn't have the ma-

terial liist season . . . but it's Ihe
very same material I hey have this year. What happened?
Whatever ii was, lOlliott is a preity good choice for Coach of the
Year, lit' will encounter opposition from Northwestern's Ara I'ar
seghian who will probably win the honor because he is a Midwest
ei'iier but I'ele has got a preity fair case .

Cal Kaliictl in Midslream
All or all, I'arsegliian (0-9 last yoar) had his Wildcats going from
the star! of the season. Such comebacks, when a team is recl-hot from
start to f inish, are not altogether rare. But look at California's come
back . \
The Bears opened their season by losing to a "small college" foe,
College of the l'aciiic. The Tigers looked tough for a while, but since
have proven anything but invincible. Then Cal was wiped out by a
Michigan State team which since has proven to be the school's worst
iri ten years.
At this point, Cstl rallied. For a team 1o come up off the bottom
in the middle of the season especially when things looked like it
was just "another one .of those years" is a truly remarkable achieve
ment.
And Northwestern isn't going to the Rose Bowl . . . that was
settled weeks ago. The fact that Cal isn't going to the Rose Bowl
may have to be settled this week, but at least it's the last week of
the season.
Unfortunately for Pete, he will be in for more blasts if he loses
this one last game . . . and posts a respectable 6-4 record . . . than
lie got all last year after a 1-9 season. But that's the life of a foot
hall coach.
•lack Curtice can go under the pretense of "I wanted Joe Kapp
for m> West team, so I had to beat Cal to keep them out of the Hose
Bowl." That motive is as good as any.
The 11. of Kapp at Berkeley
Miracles or not, it looks like there is ONE MAN to be stopped
. . . and Cal is stopped. That man is Joe Kapp, the now-fabled Bear
quarterback, who happened to kill Stanford with his roll-out runs
in the 1956 Big Came when he was a sophomore and Cal wasn't
even running out of Ihe Splil-T.
Kapp looks like the finest Split-T master ever to strut his stuff
in the Pacific Coast Conference. One thing sure: he is the last. Joe
isn't an extraordinary faker, like some Split-T masterminds; there
are quite a few better passers on the ( oast; he isn't amazingly fast.
But he's the whole show.
Perhaps the biggest factor working in Kapp's favor is his size:
fi 2, 20fj pounds. He just doesn't come flown like any old quarterback.
And another major factor which has made the Kapp option pitch
back so effective is Ihe lightning speed of the Bear halfbacks who
benefit from Joe's abilities: Jack Hart, Hank Olguin, Wayne Crow
and . . . lately, Grover Garvin. The "Cinderella"' star of the Bear
back field, Garvin was ihe big man in the winning touchdown drives
against both CCI,A and Washington.
The end plays a key role in stopping the Split-T option, as well
as Ihe defensive wing. Stanford's success in stopping option plays
hasn't been overly spectacular this season: note the Air Force and
Southern California games.
But when it comes to defensive ends, the Cards have one of Ihe
great ones in Chris Burford. And Joel Kreis, Ihe expected choice to
open al the other flank against the Bears, was brilliant defensively
against C( I.A.
No team has been completely successful in stopping Hupp, al
1 hough Oregon State rendered him somewhat ineffective. The foot
ball player who goes for an entire season without being stopped is
an unknown animal. Kapp is about due lo be stopped.
And lost somewhere in all the Kapp-talk has been Iho California
line. 'J'he Bear forwards were in a hole from the start as their ex-
I ecled stalwarts, center Boh Chiappone and end Hon Currie, were
losi for the season. But there is no need to mention that nobody, but
nobody, gets nowhere without a line in front of him. The Bear for
wards seem to have been lost in all the flow of type that has been
.set up for Kapp.
