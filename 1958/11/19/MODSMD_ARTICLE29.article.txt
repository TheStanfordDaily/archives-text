## SPORT SCENE The 						Stanford Daily 
### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
If you ask the casual football
fan to name some members of the
California varsity squad, his an
swer would probably be: "Joe
Kapp . . . or, Joe Kapp . . . well,
Joe Kapp."
And, as far as he goes, he's
right, linl there are a few other
members of tho Golden Bears
team, and here's a rundown on
those who figure to see the most
act ion in Saturday's 61st big
tussle.
If he recovers from his leg in
jury in time, Jerry Lundgren will
start for the Bears at left end.
Lundgren has grabbed five of the
Bears' 117 passes this year for a
66-yard total. He didn't get any
playing time in last year, but the
5-11, ISS-pound sophomore has
really come along well this year.
Newell a Stalwart
Pal Newell, nephew of Cal hoop
mentor Bete Newell, should hit ii
off at left guard against the Stan
fords. Newell proved his ability
as a high-caliber lineman in the
1320 minutes he played last year,
j Card -scout Dutch Fehring calls
j him "quick, a good defensive man
| and espe c i a I I y a goof I pass
rusher."
A 6-0, Hi:-! pound junior from
Berkeley, Pete Domoto, will start
al left guard, Domoto is a con
j vei led fullback who plays a con
sistently good offensive and de
' tensive game.
Cal has had (.rouble with its
| center position this year aficr los
ing expected starter Bob Chiap
pone before the season started.
I They have settled down to Terry
Jones, who is a converted guard.
Jones made UCLA's all-opponents
[ team at center last year.
Piestrup Familiar
Don Piestrup will be a familiar
I man to some of the Indians at
Ir i g h t guard. Though he didn't
play much last year, he turned in
a stellar performance in the 1956
Big (lame.
The light tackle post will he
ably handled by junior Frank Sal
ly. Sally is listed as a "big, strong
veteran" and has filled the post
much as head man Pete Elliott
! has wanted him to.
Skip Huber will be Kapp's tar
get at right end. In his first year
of varsity competition, Huber has
hauled in five passes and been a
steady lineman.
In the backl'ield. whore most of
tho overshadowing has been done,
names like Olguin, Garvin, Hart
and Pali on should have been
standouts.
Hank Olguin has had tho left
half spot tied down all year, but
his injury in the Washington tilt
; last week will probably knock
him out of play in the season's
finale. lie will bo replaced by
quick Grover Garvin, a transfer
from East Contra Costa JC.
The right half is Jack Hart,
[who, according to Fehring, would

bo a standout in his own right ii
it weren't for Kapp. Hail has
J posted a 3.75 rushing average with
356 total yards.
| California's fullback is Bill Pat
ton. His 3.13 rushing average is
third for IHe Bears, and the 6-1.
j 195-pound sophomore is consider
ed a fine defensive player 100.
Then, of course, there's Kapp.
I Joe is the PCC's total offensive
j loader, with 1 131 yards gained
and a 5.36 average. Reams have
| been written about Kapp, but Ore-
I gon State coach Tommy Prothro
j probably summed up comment
the best way: "Kapp isn't great,
j not the greatest ball player I've
seen, but he does everything Cal
haÂ« to have done."
