Stanford Police Chief Cordon Davis wishes that the numbers of
the student body would lock their bicycles. A disturbing number of
bikes have been reported missing and then have been found later
in some remote corner ol the campus â€”in front ol the police sta
tion. for instance. Apparently someone bad "borrowed" the bike
to get to bis destination, and then left it there. This' deprives sin
dents of important transportation, especially those who live off
campus. Chief Davis said, "A few years ago you could leave any
thing around, but now . . ."
