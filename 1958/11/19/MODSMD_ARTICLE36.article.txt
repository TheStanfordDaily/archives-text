# UNIVERSITY HEAD SAYS:
## Philippines Needs Aid For Higher Education 
### Jack Clumeck 
"The greatest gift that the Unit
ed States could give us would be
aid in improving our program in
higher education."
So stated Dr. Vicente G. Sinco,
president of the University of the
Philippines, who was the guest of
Stanford for the past three days.
"Outside of aid received in ag
riculture and engineering, we

have received very little to im
prove the graduate schools and
professors' salaries in our univer
sity," he continued. "We want a
source of competent men: techni
cians, teachers, scholars; a center
for training such men in the
Philippines."
Dr. Sineo was accompanied by
Prof. Abelard, his assistant, who
will head a branch of the Univer
sity of the Philippines when it is
formed. Their trip to the United
States was for the dual purpose
of heading the Philippines' dele
gation to the Colombo Plan Con
ference last week in Seattle and
of observing American universi
ties to try to correlate the policies
of the University of the Philip
pines with them.
At the University of the Philip
pines, Dr. Sinco presides over
some 16,500 students. The school
is supported by national funds
and has graduate schools in the
fields of agriculture, law, engi
neering, and arts and sciences.
