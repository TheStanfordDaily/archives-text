### 
NEW YORK (/P) An American
jet airliner beat a British jet.
across the Allantie Ocean Tues
flay, after twice giving it a head
start.
The American plane passed the
British ship more than five miles
in the air 100 miles east of Bos
ton, then swooped out of a thick
mist and landed at Idlcwild Air
port 11 minutes in advance of its
rival.
Officially, there was no raceâ€”
at least the airlines and the pilots
so maintained. The American and
British pilots echoed one another
when they landed, saying:
"It was just a routine flight."
However, it was the first oppor
tunity since the recent inaugura
tion of transatlantic jet travel to
judge ship to ship the American
built Boeing 707 airliner flown by
Pan American World Airways
and the British Overseas Airways
Corporation's Comet IV.
The flying time for the Pan Am
was 7 hours and 27 minutes, or
33 minutes better than the BOAC
plane's 8 hours and 20 minutes.
