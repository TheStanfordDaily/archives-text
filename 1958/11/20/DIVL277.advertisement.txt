WONDERFUL
Hi Darlin'.
Remember last time I said I felt
a lccturc coming on? Well, sweet,
being on to your purple yarn pig
tails-here it, is! Don't you dare
NOT read on; it won't hurt a bit.
You'll thank mc for it yet-or at
least you'll thank Juliette Marglen!
Remember I was talking about
your poor chipped and broken
nails? Well, Dorothy at the beauty
shop tells mc she has the most won
dcrful solution-or rather, Juliette
Marglen has ... a special formula
for "problem" nails (which is an
understatement as far as yours are
concerned!) and it does sound
simply marvelous. It's made espe
cially for "stubbies" like yours! She
says you can type or sculpt-any
thmq-aM you want and still have
lovely nails!
The secret, ft seems, in in two
preparations called Jewel Base and
JewelSeal-and you wear them
always. For nails as fragile as
yours, you add protective coats of
JeioelSeal every other day or so.
Well, my good deed for today is
that Tm sending you a set of
Juliette Marglen's Jewelßase and
Jewel Seal, which you are to use
according to directions in the little
booklet... and if you do, I promise
you not only a bottle of Cellini
Bronze Nail Glace to match your
Oval Lipstick-but a complete set
of every one of those divine Juliette
Marglen artist's colours! Oh, the
things we mothers have to contrive
to bribe their offspring into doing
something for their own good!
Here comes Jimmy ... I can hear
him though he's still a block away.
More later, love now ...
