# Bob Peterson Out Of 61st Big Came
## 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
Well, the word is in on Boh Peterson here in the Stanford eamp
and it isn't a pleasant one for Peterson or the Indians. The knee
injury the co-captain and guard picked up in the Oregon State game
here last Saturday will keep the senior out of Saturday's 61st Big
Game.
But that isn't all of Stanford's trouble. Halfback Jim Byrer has

injured his foot either a strain
or possible fractureâ€”and that
should keep the powerful Card
runner out of the big one, too.
Big Game No. 61 draws closer
and closer as both California and
Stanford preparations move down
to the wire tonight when the
clubs have their last goes at the
practice fields. After that it's all
hope and ability and neither of
these really count in the big one.
Head Coach Jack Curtice called
a short practice for his Stanford
Indians yesterday during which
his team worked to polish up the
offensive and defensive attack
the Cards will throw at the Berke
ley Bears come Saturday.
Meanwhile, in Berkeley, the
Bears were doing pretty much


TKI-CAPTAINS PETERSON, PROTIVA, NICOLET
Peterson will be forced to watch from the sidelines
the same thing vvilh head mentor
Pete Elliott and his fair-haired
hoy quarterback Joe Kapp direct
ing the Bears' day after next
plans.
Excitement was high, and spirit
right along with it, in both camps
as the squads prepare for what
is the biggest game in each of
their ten-garne schedules.
Cul Needs Win
For California the game is the
one final hurdle before the Blue
and Cold can saunter leisurely
down the Pasadena path to the
West's New Year's Day classic.
Stanford has two aims for the
game: to win it and salvage one
very bright spot in an otherwise
not too pleasant season, and to
give new coach Curl ice something
to help hiin discount some very
costly fumbles and pass intercep
tions which went on during the
season.
After the short practice session
here at Stanford the Curtice
squad watched movies of the Cal
ifornia split-T attack as one final
means of getting 1.0 ihe Bears on
Saturday.
The fact is thai a Stanford win
would possibly throw the Bears
into ;i tie in the Pacific Coast Con
ference race and still more or less
possibly be a deciding factor in
keeping them out of the Rose
contest. The Cards would like
nothing better than to do their
arch rivals in this way.
Series Tied
Both clubs will be fighting to
break the 25-25 deadlock in the
series which dates back to 1892.
To date there have been ten ties.
In 195G and '57 the Big Game
was won, once by each club, on
the strength of extra points. In
'56 it was a 20-18 victory for the
Bears as they presented retiring
coach Pappy Waldorf with his
last Big Game win. In '57 retiring
coach Chuck Taylor got the vie

lory on the strength of two points
after, 14-12.
This year will probably see the
end of both those trends. Cal
coach Elliott is in his second year
at Berkeley and Curtice has yel
to finish his first here on the
Farm. The probabilities that nei
ther coach will retire are so great
that betting against such a thing
happening would be a good bet at
long odds.
Then, too, it doesn't look now
like the game will be so close that
extra points will decide it. If it
should get thai way, though, nei
ther club will be in a hole as both
have done fairly well in this de
partment this year.
Bear Ltundgren Returns
In the Berkeley lair end Jerry
Lundgren made a return lo prac
tice yesterday and gave a little
hope that he will be able to start
at his regular position. It was
feared that Lundgren would be
able to see limited, if any, action
in the contest.
Fullback Bill Patton has looked
sharp in practice this week, and
will no doubt come 1 through with
another fine game against the
Injuns. Halfback Hank Olguin is
still out of action across the Bay,
and it now appears that he is def
initely out of ihe game.
