# East Interest Rare In Latin America
## 
### Ronald Hilton Director, Hispanic American Studios 
The invitation to write an ar
ticle for The Stanford Daily ar
rived on the eve of my departure
for the East; since the destiny of
this nation is largely in the hands
of New York and the eastern
seaboard, it seemed that a brief
report on the Easterner's vision
of the world would not be irrele
vant.
Visits to institutions like the
Council on Foreign Relations and
discussions wilh men like Philip
Mosely, director of the council,
left the clear impression that
West European, Russian and
Asian studies are being carried on
by well-suppor ted institutes in an
atmosphere of understanding. But
what of Latin America?
Shortly after my arrival a large
corporation entertained me and
introduced me to one of their pub
lic relations officers from Latin
America.
He was the strangest public re
lations man I had ever seen. No
ingratiating manner, no Brooks
Brothers suit, no evasion of con
troversial issues. A squat indi
vidual of half-Indian features, he
immediately demanded to know
what was the nature of my in
terest in Latin America (he pre
ferred the term "Indo-America").
Mellowed
As soon as he learned that I
was a professor, that I spoke
Spanish and that I had devoted a
quarter of a century to the study
of his continent, he mellowed and
we became close companions.
A highly intelligent individual
who hr.d served in the diplomatic
corps of his country, he had been
ousted by a dictator with whom
the corporation had maintained
cordial relations. The corporation
was now trying to realign itself
with the post-revolutionary order
and had clearly hired him for this
purpose.
Conferences with many well
placed individuals made it patent
to me that talk about Pan-Ameri
canism and our inter - American
friendship was a fagade hiding a
widespread fear for corporate in
vestments in the wake of recent
revolutions.
Few Corporations
Unfortunately, only a few cor
porations, such as the United
Fruit Company and the American
& Foreign Power Company, seem
ed to have an intelligent interest
in what was going on in Latin
America. Incidentally, it was pre
cisely in those corporations that I
found our "Hispanic American
Report" carefully read by execu
tive officers.
All too frequently, the response
of the public relations officers
and of the company administra
tion was simply to suggest invit
ing to the United States individ
uals who happen to be powerful
at this moment and giving them a
good time. Corporations would
spend thousands of dollars on
this, but one literally refused to
spend $10 on a book about Latin
America.
Blanketing
They also entertained naive and
expensive ideas about "blanket
ing" Latin America with Madison
Avenue-type propaganda to "soft
en up" (sic) the Latin Americans,
who in fact would be as happy as
I would be if the Stanford campus
were covered with billboards (I
should proceed to "soften up" the
billboarders).
The editor of a large publishing
house entertained me at lunch and
told me his worries.
The company was really run by
the sales department, and one
salesman had hoped to make a
sale to a petty Middle-American
dictator.
The sale was not made because
the books did not contain any flat
tery of the dictator; so the sales
man proposed to the company
that they omit from their publi
cations anything unfriendly to
Latin-American dictators. Indeed,
sales would be better if the com

pany's books praised th em, lie
said.
So the company had hired some
engineers to write books about
Latin America, on the grounds
that engineers know not hi n g
about tlie broader issues of Latin-
American life, and ignorance is
bliss.
When asked what I thought of
this policy, I realized that only a
businesslike reply would score; so
I pointed out Ihat the company
was in danger of losing its stand
ing and its sales in this country,
and that it would also lose cus
tomers in most Latin-American
countries.
Little Hope
Eastern universities offered lit
tle hope. In the name of effi
ciency and over-ail planning, sev
eral universities have established
language departments in which
the Latin Americanists are sub
ordinated to an old-line Spanish
teacher who has no real interest
in Latin America, and he in turn
is subject to a French professor
who has little interest in Spain or
Latin America.
Indeed, there are cases of posi
tive antipathy. The organization
man is at work, language build
ings and laboratories are being
built (this is excellent), but lan
guage departments have reached
a point where the means is mis
taken for the end.
I had the impression that lan
guage departments are becoming
more and more like Berlitz
schools, and that the great spirit
which should infuse a university
is being squeezed out of them.
All Unhappy
The Latin Americanists were,
almost without Exception, unhap
py, and the height of absurdity
has been reached at one major in
stitution where a distinguished
Latin American (by far the best
known man in the language de
partment and one of the best
known men in the university) an
nounced his decision to resign in
January because, after years of
service, he has found life impos
sible.
The behavioral scientists offer
ed little more help. They were
lying on a couch drawing circles
on a blackboard with one hand
and punching an adding machine
with the other. All these activi
ties are commendable, although
Ramon Llull in the 13th century
was making more interesting
"models" than are the behavioral
scientists of today.
Never Learn
However, these quantitative ex
perts never get down to the diffi
cult business of learning a foreign
language well; they speak in ab
stractions which are often far re
moved from the real situation of
the country they are studying,
and there is little, if any, empathy
between them and Latin-American
civilization.
They are engaged in a game.
They play with Latin America as
they would play with any other
area, and not infrequently they
are busy preparing techniques for
the aforementioned mass - media
experts to use.
Disenchanted
So my Venezuelan friend and I
returned to his Latin - American
coterie, and, disenchanted, he be
gan with them a conversation on
a plane which impressed me; Lat
in America is one of the few areas
of the world where the art of in
telligent conversation is not dead.
Let it not be thought, however,
that I returned completely dis
illusioned. I found that our "His
panic American Report" is widely
known and respected, and there is
an eagerness on the part of all
the leading specialists to attend
an international conference on
Latin America which we are plan
ning for next October.
My mission successfully accom
plished, I was happy to return to
the West, where we do not have
the cold and calculating spirit of
New York, where there is a real
concern for other peoples and
where we trust that Latin-Ameri
can studies will receive the intelli
gent support they deserve.

sale to a petty Middle-American
dictator.
The sale was not made because
the books did not contain any flat
tery of the dictator; so the sales
man proposed to the company
that they omit from their publi
cations anything unfriendly to
Latin-American dictators. Indeed,
sales would be better if the com

pany's books praised th em, lie
said.
So the company had hired some
engineers to write books about
Latin America, on the grounds
that engineers know not hi n g
about tlie broader issues of Latin-
American life, and ignorance is
bliss.
When asked what I thought of
this policy, I realized that only a
businesslike reply would score; so
I pointed out Ihat the company
was in danger of losing its stand
ing and its sales in this country,
and that it would also lose cus
tomers in most Latin-American
countries.
Little Hope
Eastern universities offered lit
tle hope. In the name of effi
ciency and over-ail planning, sev
eral universities have established
language departments in which
the Latin Americanists are sub
ordinated to an old-line Spanish
teacher who has no real interest
in Latin America, and he in turn
is subject to a French professor
who has little interest in Spain or
Latin America.
Indeed, there are cases of posi
tive antipathy. The organization
man is at work, language build
ings and laboratories are being
built (this is excellent), but lan
guage departments have reached
a point where the means is mis
taken for the end.
I had the impression that lan
guage departments are becoming
more and more like Berlitz
schools, and that the great spirit
which should infuse a university
is being squeezed out of them.
All Unhappy
The Latin Americanists were,
almost without Exception, unhap
py, and the height of absurdity
has been reached at one major in
stitution where a distinguished
Latin American (by far the best
known man in the language de
partment and one of the best
known men in the university) an
nounced his decision to resign in
January because, after years of
service, he has found life impos
sible.
The behavioral scientists offer
ed little more help. They were
lying on a couch drawing circles
on a blackboard with one hand
and punching an adding machine
with the other. All these activi
ties are commendable, although
Ramon Llull in the 13th century
was making more interesting
"models" than are the behavioral
scientists of today.
Never Learn
However, these quantitative ex
perts never get down to the diffi
cult business of learning a foreign
language well; they speak in ab
stractions which are often far re
moved from the real situation of
the country they are studying,
and there is little, if any, empathy
between them and Latin-American
civilization.
They are engaged in a game.
They play with Latin America as
they would play with any other
area, and not infrequently they
are busy preparing techniques for
the aforementioned mass - media
experts to use.
Disenchanted
So my Venezuelan friend and I
returned to his Latin - American
coterie, and, disenchanted, he be
gan with them a conversation on
a plane which impressed me; Lat
in America is one of the few areas
of the world where the art of in
telligent conversation is not dead.
Let it not be thought, however,
that I returned completely dis
illusioned. I found that our "His
panic American Report" is widely
known and respected, and there is
an eagerness on the part of all
the leading specialists to attend
an international conference on
Latin America which we are plan
ning for next October.
My mission successfully accom
plished, I was happy to return to
the West, where we do not have
the cold and calculating spirit of
New York, where there is a real
concern for other peoples and
where we trust that Latin-Ameri
can studies will receive the intelli
gent support they deserve.
The invitation to write an ar
ticle for The Stanford Daily ar
rived on the eve of my departure
for the East; since the destiny of
this nation is largely in the hands
of New York and the eastern
seaboard, it seemed that a brief
report on the Easterner's vision
of the world would not be irrele
vant.
Visits to institutions like the
Council on Foreign Relations and
discussions wilh men like Philip
Mosely, director of the council,
left the clear impression that
West European, Russian and
Asian studies are being carried on
by well-suppor ted institutes in an
atmosphere of understanding. But
what of Latin America?
Shortly after my arrival a large
corporation entertained me and
introduced me to one of their pub
lic relations officers from Latin
America.
He was the strangest public re
lations man I had ever seen. No
ingratiating manner, no Brooks
Brothers suit, no evasion of con
troversial issues. A squat indi
vidual of half-Indian features, he
immediately demanded to know
what was the nature of my in
terest in Latin America (he pre
ferred the term "Indo-America").
Mellowed
As soon as he learned that I
was a professor, that I spoke
Spanish and that I had devoted a
quarter of a century to the study
of his continent, he mellowed and
we became close companions.
A highly intelligent individual
who hr.d served in the diplomatic
corps of his country, he had been
ousted by a dictator with whom
the corporation had maintained
cordial relations. The corporation
was now trying to realign itself
with the post-revolutionary order
and had clearly hired him for this
purpose.
Conferences with many well
placed individuals made it patent
to me that talk about Pan-Ameri
canism and our inter - American
friendship was a fagade hiding a
widespread fear for corporate in
vestments in the wake of recent
revolutions.
Few Corporations
Unfortunately, only a few cor
porations, such as the United
Fruit Company and the American
& Foreign Power Company, seem
ed to have an intelligent interest
in what was going on in Latin
America. Incidentally, it was pre
cisely in those corporations that I
found our "Hispanic American
Report" carefully read by execu
tive officers.
All too frequently, the response
of the public relations officers
and of the company administra
tion was simply to suggest invit
ing to the United States individ
uals who happen to be powerful
at this moment and giving them a
good time. Corporations would
spend thousands of dollars on
this, but one literally refused to
spend $10 on a book about Latin
America.
Blanketing
They also entertained naive and
expensive ideas about "blanket
ing" Latin America with Madison
Avenue-type propaganda to "soft
en up" (sic) the Latin Americans,
who in fact would be as happy as
I would be if the Stanford campus
were covered with billboards (I
should proceed to "soften up" the
billboarders).
The editor of a large publishing
house entertained me at lunch and
told me his worries.
The company was really run by
the sales department, and one
salesman had hoped to make a
sale to a petty Middle-American
dictator.
The sale was not made because

a plane which impressed me; Lat
in America is one of the few areas
of the world where the art of in
telligent conversation is not dead.
Let it not be thought, however,
that I returned completely dis
illusioned. I found that our "His
panic American Report" is widely
known and respected, and there is
an eagerness on the part of all
the leading specialists to attend
an international conference on
Latin America which we are plan
ning for next October.
My mission successfully accom
plished, I was happy to return to
the West, where we do not have
the cold and calculating spirit of
New York, where there is a real
concern for other peoples and
where we trust that Latin-Ameri
can studies will receive the intelli
gent support they deserve.
The invitation to write an ar
ticle for The Stanford Daily ar
rived on the eve of my departure
for the East; since the destiny of
this nation is largely in the hands
of New York and the eastern
seaboard, it seemed that a brief
report on the Easterner's vision
of the world would not be irrele
vant.
Visits to institutions like the
Council on Foreign Relations and
discussions wilh men like Philip
Mosely, director of the council,
left the clear impression that
West European, Russian and
Asian studies are being carried on
by well-suppor ted institutes in an
atmosphere of understanding. But
what of Latin America?
Shortly after my arrival a large
corporation entertained me and
introduced me to one of their pub
lic relations officers from Latin
America.
He was the strangest public re
lations man I had ever seen. No
ingratiating manner, no Brooks
Brothers suit, no evasion of con
troversial issues. A squat indi
vidual of half-Indian features, he
immediately demanded to know
what was the nature of my in
terest in Latin America (he pre
ferred the term "Indo-America").
Mellowed
As soon as he learned that I
was a professor, that I spoke
Spanish and that I had devoted a
quarter of a century to the study
of his continent, he mellowed and
we became close companions.
A highly intelligent individual
who hr.d served in the diplomatic
corps of his country, he had been
ousted by a dictator with whom
the corporation had maintained
cordial relations. The corporation
was now trying to realign itself
with the post-revolutionary order
and had clearly hired him for this
purpose.
Conferences with many well
placed individuals made it patent
to me that talk about Pan-Ameri
canism and our inter - American
friendship was a fagade hiding a
widespread fear for corporate in
vestments in the wake of recent
revolutions.
Few Corporations
Unfortunately, only a few cor
porations, such as the United
Fruit Company and the American
& Foreign Power Company, seem
ed to have an intelligent interest
in what was going on in Latin
America. Incidentally, it was pre
cisely in those corporations that I
found our "Hispanic American
Report" carefully read by execu
tive officers.
All too frequently, the response
of the public relations officers
and of the company administra
tion was simply to suggest invit
ing to the United States individ
uals who happen to be powerful
at this moment and giving them a
good time. Corporations would
spend thousands of dollars on
this, but one literally refused to
spend $10 on a book about Latin
America.
Blanketing
They also entertained naive and
expensive ideas about "blanket
ing" Latin America with Madison
Avenue-type propaganda to "soft
en up" (sic) the Latin Americans,
who in fact would be as happy as
I would be if the Stanford campus
were covered with billboards (I
should proceed to "soften up" the
billboarders).
The editor of a large publishing
house entertained me at lunch and
told me his worries.
The company was really run by
the sales department, and one
salesman had hoped to make a
sale to a petty Middle-American
dictator.
The sale was not made because
the books did not contain any flat
tery of the dictator; so the sales
man proposed to the company
that they omit from their publi
cations anything unfriendly to
Latin-American dictators. Indeed,
sales would be better if the com

pany's books praised th em, lie
said.
So the company had hired some
engineers to write books about
Latin America, on the grounds
that engineers know not hi n g
about tlie broader issues of Latin-
American life, and ignorance is
bliss.
When asked what I thought of
this policy, I realized that only a
businesslike reply would score; so
I pointed out Ihat the company
was in danger of losing its stand
ing and its sales in this country,
and that it would also lose cus
tomers in most Latin-American
countries.
Little Hope
Eastern universities offered lit
tle hope. In the name of effi
ciency and over-ail planning, sev
eral universities have established
language departments in which
the Latin Americanists are sub
ordinated to an old-line Spanish
teacher who has no real interest
in Latin America, and he in turn
is subject to a French professor
who has little interest in Spain or
Latin America.
Indeed, there are cases of posi
tive antipathy. The organization
man is at work, language build
ings and laboratories are being
built (this is excellent), but lan
guage departments have reached
a point where the means is mis
taken for the end.
I had the impression that lan
guage departments are becoming
more and more like Berlitz
schools, and that the great spirit
which should infuse a university
is being squeezed out of them.
All Unhappy
The Latin Americanists were,
almost without Exception, unhap
py, and the height of absurdity
has been reached at one major in
stitution where a distinguished
Latin American (by far the best
known man in the language de
partment and one of the best
known men in the university) an
nounced his decision to resign in
January because, after years of
service, he has found life impos
sible.
The behavioral scientists offer
ed little more help. They were
lying on a couch drawing circles
on a blackboard with one hand
and punching an adding machine
with the other. All these activi
ties are commendable, although
Ramon Llull in the 13th century
was making more interesting
"models" than are the behavioral
scientists of today.
Never Learn
However, these quantitative ex
perts never get down to the diffi
cult business of learning a foreign
language well; they speak in ab
stractions which are often far re
moved from the real situation of
the country they are studying,
and there is little, if any, empathy
between them and Latin-American
civilization.
They are engaged in a game.
They play with Latin America as
they would play with any other
area, and not infrequently they
are busy preparing techniques for
the aforementioned mass - media
experts to use.
Disenchanted
So my Venezuelan friend and I
returned to his Latin - American
coterie, and, disenchanted, he be
gan with them a conversation on

uals who happen to be powerful
at this moment and giving them a
good time. Corporations would
spend thousands of dollars on
this, but one literally refused to
spend $10 on a book about Latin
America.
Blanketing
They also entertained naive and
expensive ideas about "blanket
ing" Latin America with Madison
Avenue-type propaganda to "soft
en up" (sic) the Latin Americans,
who in fact would be as happy as
I would be if the Stanford campus
were covered with billboards (I
should proceed to "soften up" the
billboarders).
The editor of a large publishing
house entertained me at lunch and
told me his worries.
The company was really run by
the sales department, and one
salesman had hoped to make a
sale to a petty Middle-American
dictator.
The sale was not made because
the books did not contain any flat
tery of the dictator; so the sales
man proposed to the company
that they omit from their publi
cations anything unfriendly to
Latin-American dictators. Indeed,
sales would be better if the com

pany's books praised th em, lie
said.
So the company had hired some
engineers to write books about
Latin America, on the grounds
that engineers know not hi n g
about tlie broader issues of Latin-
American life, and ignorance is
bliss.
When asked what I thought of
this policy, I realized that only a
businesslike reply would score; so
I pointed out Ihat the company
was in danger of losing its stand
ing and its sales in this country,
and that it would also lose cus
tomers in most Latin-American
countries.
Little Hope
Eastern universities offered lit
tle hope. In the name of effi
ciency and over-ail planning, sev
eral universities have established
language departments in which
the Latin Americanists are sub
ordinated to an old-line Spanish
teacher who has no real interest
in Latin America, and he in turn
is subject to a French professor
who has little interest in Spain or
Latin America.
Indeed, there are cases of posi
tive antipathy. The organization
man is at work, language build
ings and laboratories are being
built (this is excellent), but lan
guage departments have reached
a point where the means is mis
taken for the end.
I had the impression that lan
guage departments are becoming
more and more like Berlitz
schools, and that the great spirit
which should infuse a university
is being squeezed out of them.
All Unhappy
The Latin Americanists were,
almost without Exception, unhap
py, and the height of absurdity
has been reached at one major in
stitution where a distinguished
Latin American (by far the best
known man in the language de
partment and one of the best
known men in the university) an
nounced his decision to resign in
January because, after years of
service, he has found life impos
sible.
The behavioral scientists offer
ed little more help. They were
lying on a couch drawing circles
on a blackboard with one hand
and punching an adding machine
with the other. All these activi
ties are commendable, although
Ramon Llull in the 13th century
was making more interesting
"models" than are the behavioral
scientists of today.
Never Learn
However, these quantitative ex
perts never get down to the diffi
cult business of learning a foreign
language well; they speak in ab
stractions which are often far re
moved from the real situation of
the country they are studying,
and there is little, if any, empathy
between them and Latin-American
civilization.
They are engaged in a game.
They play with Latin America as
they would play with any other
area, and not infrequently they
are busy preparing techniques for
the aforementioned mass - media
experts to use.
Disenchanted
So my Venezuelan friend and I
returned to his Latin - American
coterie, and, disenchanted, he be
gan with them a conversation on
a plane which impressed me; Lat
in America is one of the few areas
of the world where the art of in
telligent conversation is not dead.
Let it not be thought, however,
that I returned completely dis
illusioned. I found that our "His
panic American Report" is widely
known and respected, and there is
an eagerness on the part of all
the leading specialists to attend
an international conference on
Latin America which we are plan
ning for next October.
My mission successfully accom
plished, I was happy to return to
the West, where we do not have
the cold and calculating spirit of
New York, where there is a real
concern for other peoples and
where we trust that Latin-Ameri
can studies will receive the intelli
gent support they deserve.
The invitation to write an ar
ticle for The Stanford Daily ar
rived on the eve of my departure
for the East; since the destiny of
this nation is largely in the hands
of New York and the eastern
seaboard, it seemed that a brief
report on the Easterner's vision
of the world would not be irrele
vant.
Visits to institutions like the
Council on Foreign Relations and
discussions wilh men like Philip
Mosely, director of the council,
left the clear impression that
West European, Russian and
Asian studies are being carried on
by well-suppor ted institutes in an
atmosphere of understanding. But
what of Latin America?
Shortly after my arrival a large
corporation entertained me and
introduced me to one of their pub
lic relations officers from Latin
America.
He was the strangest public re
lations man I had ever seen. No
ingratiating manner, no Brooks
Brothers suit, no evasion of con
troversial issues. A squat indi
vidual of half-Indian features, he
immediately demanded to know
what was the nature of my in
terest in Latin America (he pre
ferred the term "Indo-America").
Mellowed
As soon as he learned that I
was a professor, that I spoke
Spanish and that I had devoted a
quarter of a century to the study
of his continent, he mellowed and
we became close companions.
A highly intelligent individual
who hr.d served in the diplomatic
corps of his country, he had been
ousted by a dictator with whom
the corporation had maintained
cordial relations. The corporation
was now trying to realign itself
with the post-revolutionary order
and had clearly hired him for this
purpose.
Conferences with many well
placed individuals made it patent
to me that talk about Pan-Ameri
canism and our inter - American
friendship was a fagade hiding a
widespread fear for corporate in
vestments in the wake of recent
revolutions.
Few Corporations
Unfortunately, only a few cor
porations, such as the United
Fruit Company and the American
& Foreign Power Company, seem
ed to have an intelligent interest
in what was going on in Latin
America. Incidentally, it was pre
cisely in those corporations that I
found our "Hispanic American
Report" carefully read by execu
tive officers.
All too frequently, the response
of the public relations officers
and of the company administra
tion was simply to suggest invit
ing to the United States individ
uals who happen to be powerful
at this moment and giving them a
good time. Corporations would
spend thousands of dollars on
this, but one literally refused to
