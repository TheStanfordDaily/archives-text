Meaning Losf
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial which appeared in
your Nov. 19 issue carried a cer
tain derogatory tone which indi
cates a complete lack of com pre
hension of the interpretation of
the Women's Social Regulations
by Women's Council, which you
have concurred in dismissing as
"gobbledygook"—a term so often
used by the ignorant to describe
that which they cannot under
stand—that I feel obligated to en
lighten you concerning the true
significance of this decision.
This interpretation in fact im
plies a whole new concept of mor
ality, one which decides the mor
ality or immorality of an action
nol by some outdated standard
which designates particular class
es of acts by nature moral or im
moral, but by the new standard
of the physical context in which
the action occurs. It is where the
act is performed that determines
its morality or immorality, not
the act itself.
But Women's Council has done
more than vaguely formulate an
ethical concept; they have also de
veloped its specific application;
that is, they have decided exactly
which particular physical con
texts are moral and which im
moral, specifically, the downstairs
is moral and the upstairs immor
al. With such a standard one need
no longer bother with the mean
ing of the act itself; only the loca
tion matters. It is indeed a con
cept with vast ramifications. I
even foresee a day not far off
when all ethics may become as
precise and axiomatized a study
as symbolic logic, and all our
problems may be solved by for
mulas. I also foresee increased
popularity for one-story dwellings
in the Palo Alto area.

New Fight Song
Editor, The Daily:
Today's [Nov. 141 impassioned
editorial has inspired the follow
ing poem;
A Stanford Fight Song
Stanford student sit and root
there,
Tend the games as if a job.
You don't want the public
thinking,
"You are just a common slob."
Stanford student do not leave
them;
Carry through until the end.
You don't want alumni think
ing.
"Fie on this fair weather
friend."
Stanford student don't draw
comments,

Carry on — please watch them
play,
For I tire of Daily's pious
preachings,
Every single, blessed day!

Sheer Idiocy
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorials are becoming a
real pain. Are you aware that
anything — anything — is happen
ing in the world besides Stanford
football games? For days you've
spoken of nothing but poor plan
ning for rallies, what bad man
ners Stanford rooters have, how
Big Game is the Real Test. And
now you devote your space to Red
and White Day, saying that red
and white is not only a good idea
but should also be mandatory. Is
this extremely subtle sarcasm or
sheer idiocy?

Brilliant, Ruthless
Editor, The Daily:
Can Wednesday's editorial
about the fantasy-world of Wom
en's Social Regulations possibly
be a product of the same mind,
the same hand—even the same
typewriter!—as what seemed the
interminable string of lugubri
ous laments about how the
rooters are disappointing the
team, the team is disappointing
the rooters, everybody (plus the
campus roads) is disappointing
the alums, LASSU was disap
pointing the people who wanted
the Axe in the Cellar immediate
ly, etc., etc.?
Your discussion of the rule
against women's entering men's
rooms in University residences
brilliantly and ruthlessly dissects
its follies and hangs them up in
glaringly spotlighted and clearly
labeled display — and it's about
time. To one who already agreed
the editorial was exhilarating; I
can only hope it had some appro
priate effect on some of those
who didn't.
Will you now carry the spirit of
this resounding (even startling)
outburst to some more of its logi
cal conclusions, pointing out, for
instance, how clearly other of the
Women's Social Regulations also
proclaim the "girlishness" of
those who impose them upon
themselves? •
