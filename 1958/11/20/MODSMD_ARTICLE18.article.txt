# Ignorance, Indifference Key Western-Far East Issues
## 
### Bob Frank 
Western ignorance and indiffer
ence to the problems and impor
tance of Japan and the Far East
in general amounts to criminal
negligence, according to Byron
Marshall, who recently returned
from a year at Keio University in
Japan.
"The solution to our problems
with the Asian countries and
their tendency to drive out West
ern influence in their movement
to free Asia for the Asians," Mar
shall said, "may lie in our rela
tions wilh the one Asian country
which still values Western ideas,
Japan."
Japan is the leader of tlie na
tions of East Asia outside the
bamboo curtain. Indonesian and
Thai students usually go to Japa
nese universities. Japan is the
most industrialized nation in Asia,
and exports its scientists and
technologists to other Asian coun
tries.
Rate Compares
Japan's literacy rate is compar
able to that of our country, and
"the Japanese appear to read
even more than we do, judging by

their newspaper and magazine
circulation. They continue to read
books after they leave school."
Western dress is the rule in To
kyo, arid the town is as well light
ed at night by neon signs as New
York. The buildings of Tokyo are
modern, though not skyscrapers
because the Japanese, as we in
the Bay Area, live in an earth
quake area.
"English is a required subject
in Japanese schools for six years
before college," Marshall said.
"The government is perfectly free
to abolish this requirement," he
said, "but there is really no re
sentment and no unhappiness
with the present arrangement."
Future in Contact
The Japanese people see their
future in contact with the West.
Japan's government is modeled
on Egland's, and their interests
in music and art are directed to
ward European styles. Marshall
said that "American Westerns are
as popular in Japanese theaters
as their own 'samurai' movies,"
and added that Japanese movies
are no more representative of
present-day Japan than are our
Westerns representative of the
U.S.
Japan's trade is carried on not
only with the U.S., but with many
countries of Asia. While nations
of the Arab bloc oppose Anglo-
American oil companies' "exploi
tation," Marshall said Ihe Japa
nese find them much more willing
to allow Japan to develop their
oil fields.
Student Interest
At Keio University, Marshall
found the most remarkable as

pert to b<» the student interest in
international affairs and the Eng
lish-speaking countries. Keio is
well known as a producer of busi
nessmen, and is one of the three
top universities in Japan. "The
university," according to Mar
shall, "is similar to Stanford in
being a private university, in its
enrollment and the appearance of
its buildings."
Marshall found that "Most of
the students could understand
English if I spoke slowly enough.
They wanted to hear me speak
English, though 1 was .just as
anxious to try out my Japanese."
Keio University has a group
similar to our Keio Affiliation
Committee, made up of students
interested in news of America,
and especially eager to hear it
from an American. Another sepa
rate organization publishes an
English • language magazine
monthly for the students .
Probably Higher
Tt is Marshall's opinion that
"the entrance requirements at;
Keio are probably even higher
than Sanford's."
One more example of the West
ern orientation of Japan is the
number of students at Keio who
asked Marshall to try to find
them pen pals at Stanford to
carry on correspondence in Eng
lish. If anything, it is we who
need to learn with Japanese.
"Perhaps we could have prevent
ed the war with Japan if we had
realized the country's capital
and perhaps we will not lose
Asian friendships forever with a
proper understanding of an ally
such as Japan."

Western dress is the rule in To

modern, though not skyscrapers
because the Japanese, as we in
the Bay Area, live in an earth

"English is a required subject
in Japanese schools for six years
before college," Marshall said.
"The government is perfectly free
to abolish this requirement," he
said, "but there is really no re

with the present arrangement."
Future in Contact
The Japanese people see their
future in contact with the West.
Japan's government is modeled
on Egland's, and their interests
in music and art are directed to
ward European styles. Marshall
said that "American Westerns are
as popular in Japanese theaters
as their own 'samurai' movies,"
and added that Japanese movies
are no more representative of
present-day Japan than are our
Westerns representative of the
U.S.
Japan's trade is carried on not
only with the U.S., but with many
countries of Asia. While nations
of the Arab bloc oppose Anglo-
American oil companies' "exploi
tation," Marshall said Ihe Japa
nese find them much more willing
to allow Japan to develop their
oil fields.
Student Interest
At Keio University, Marshall
found the most remarkable as

pert to b<» the student interest in
international affairs and the Eng
lish-speaking countries. Keio is
well known as a producer of busi
nessmen, and is one of the three
top universities in Japan. "The
university," according to Mar
shall, "is similar to Stanford in
being a private university, in its
enrollment and the appearance of
its buildings."
Marshall found that "Most of
the students could understand
English if I spoke slowly enough.
They wanted to hear me speak
English, though 1 was .just as
anxious to try out my Japanese."
Keio University has a group
similar to our Keio Affiliation
Committee, made up of students
interested in news of America,
and especially eager to hear it
from an American. Another sepa
rate organization publishes an
English • language magazine
monthly for the students .
Probably Higher
Tt is Marshall's opinion that
"the entrance requirements at;
Keio are probably even higher
than Sanford's."
One more example of the West
ern orientation of Japan is the
number of students at Keio who
asked Marshall to try to find
them pen pals at Stanford to
carry on correspondence in Eng
lish. If anything, it is we who
need to learn with Japanese.
"Perhaps we could have prevent
ed the war with Japan if we had
realized the country's capital
and perhaps we will not lose
Asian friendships forever with a
proper understanding of an ally
such as Japan."
Western ignorance and indiffer
ence to the problems and impor
tance of Japan and the Far East
in general amounts to criminal
negligence, according to Byron
Marshall, who recently returned
from a year at Keio University in
Japan.
"The solution to our problems
with the Asian countries and
their tendency to drive out West
ern influence in their movement
to free Asia for the Asians," Mar
shall said, "may lie in our rela
tions wilh the one Asian country
which still values Western ideas,
Japan."
Japan is the leader of tlie na
tions of East Asia outside the
bamboo curtain. Indonesian and
Thai students usually go to Japa

most industrialized nation in Asia,
and exports its scientists and
technologists to other Asian coun

U.S.
Japan's trade is carried on not
only with the U.S., but with many
countries of Asia. While nations
of the Arab bloc oppose Anglo-
American oil companies' "exploi
tation," Marshall said Ihe Japa
nese find them much more willing
to allow Japan to develop their
oil fields.
Student Interest
At Keio University, Marshall
found the most remarkable as

pert to b<» the student interest in
international affairs and the Eng
lish-speaking countries. Keio is
well known as a producer of busi
nessmen, and is one of the three
top universities in Japan. "The
university," according to Mar
shall, "is similar to Stanford in
being a private university, in its
enrollment and the appearance of
its buildings."
Marshall found that "Most of
the students could understand
English if I spoke slowly enough.
They wanted to hear me speak
English, though 1 was .just as
anxious to try out my Japanese."
Keio University has a group
similar to our Keio Affiliation
Committee, made up of students
interested in news of America,
and especially eager to hear it
from an American. Another sepa
rate organization publishes an
English • language magazine
monthly for the students .
Probably Higher
Tt is Marshall's opinion that
"the entrance requirements at;
Keio are probably even higher
than Sanford's."
One more example of the West
ern orientation of Japan is the
number of students at Keio who
asked Marshall to try to find
them pen pals at Stanford to
carry on correspondence in Eng
lish. If anything, it is we who
need to learn with Japanese.
"Perhaps we could have prevent
ed the war with Japan if we had
realized the country's capital
and perhaps we will not lose
Asian friendships forever with a
proper understanding of an ally
such as Japan."
