## Card, Bear Tilt Crucial In Final PCC Contests 
### Bob Payne 
As evening falls Saturday after
noon, the curtain will come clown
on the last football games ever
in the Pacific Coast Conference.
There will be no flowers. And
no tears.
In Los Angeles, perhaps, Ihere
will be joy. Elsewhere, the feel
ings will be mixed . . . and it's
too bad thai one of the nation's
oldest and greatesl collegiate con
ferences should have to end on
such a bitler note.
But dying conference or not,
never before have the eight main
combatants come down to their
season - ending Iraditionals with
every game in the "crucial" cate
gory.
Washington State, Oregon
State and Southern California
must defeat their arch-rivals to
keep above water in the down-to
thc-wire Hose Bowl race. But ev
ery tiling depends on the Stan
ford-California liig Game.
Cal, K<' Pleased
II has been a disappointing sea
son for many . . . particularly
OSC and WSC, which have done
well but perhaps too late. For
others, particularly Cal and USC,
it has been a somewhat pleasing
year. These were the teams that
could manage only one win last
season.
It's been disappointing for UC
LA, which couldn't win with or
without seniors. The Bruins have
played what they called their last
ever games with VVSC, OSC and
Oregon. Maybe Cal and USC
have too, but they aren't so em
phatic about it.
The Northerners might call it
good riddance. The farewells
didn't come easy for UCLA; they
snuck by Oregon in the closing
seconds; were pasted by OSC, and
slaughtered by WSC.
Victories are imperative for the
three two-loss hopefuls, Cougars,
Beavers and Trojans. But all de
pends on Stanford.
WSC Plays Huskies
WSC will lake on pesky Wash
ington in Spokane, where the
Cougars haven't won a game
since 1904. They will be heavily
favored, though, for week after
week they are looking tougher,
deeper and sounder. Pass master
Bob Newman is due to be back, if
needed, but as the Cougar ground
game has become stronger and
stronger, they have been throw
ing only 10 or 15 passes a game,
completing most of them.
Washington has also been look
ing tougher and tougher. Last
week the Huskies almost scared

Cal right out of its stadium and
the Bears wore lucky to escape
willi a 12-7 win. The Huskies can
call on 1 heir rugged line, quarter
back Bob I-livner and halfback
Luther Carr, the most exciting
runner in the loop.
OSC meets always-tough Ore
gon in Corvallis, where the Bea
vers haven't lost since 1954. And
they will be favored, but not by
much. An off-week performance,
like those which have become fre
quent for the Beavers this year,
could be disastrous.
If it rains, this might come out
a 0-0 deadlock. OSC's big line is
tough on Split-T teams and Ore
gon's defense has been its usual
non-movable. But the Ducks have
generated next to no offense.
use vs. UCLA
II.SC meets UCLA in the Coli
seum, which they both call home.
The Trojans, generally rated by
many as now the toughest team
in the conference, will be favored.
UCLA has turned in two good
games, against Cal and Oregon,
but may not have the horses.
Four points, all conversions,
have been the difference between
an unbeaten season and the none
too-spectacular 5-3 record the Tro
jans show now. But strongest or
not, SC is given the littlest chance
to win popularity polls should the
Rose Bowl race end up a tie.
Should the votes end up tied,
WSC goesâ€”for the team which
has -gone the longest without a
Rose Bowl trip is the automatic
winner. The Cougars haven't seen
Pasadena since 1931.
Next week, USC plays its tra
ditional season-ender with Notre
Dame, and in two weeks Oregon
finishes up in Florida against
Miami.
