# TRIBE UPSET
## Wallace Wins, but Bears Edge Stanford Harriers 
### 
California evened the season
cross â€¢ country scries with Stan
ford Wednesday on the Berkeley
course, upsetting the Indians 2G
-33 in dual competition.
The Indians, off their two re
cent victories over the Bears,
were narrow favorites. But when
c: a 1 if or n i a swept the sixth
through lOlh spots, the Cards
were through.
Keith Wallace had little trouble
capturing individual honors. The
Stanford sophomore led the entire
four-mile distance, crossing the
finish in 19:1)9, 11 seconds ahead
of runner-up Roger Price of Cal.
Martin llpsct
Price and teammate Alan Clay
lord pulled a mild surprise by
beating Stanford's Doug Martin.
Martin had whipped both Iwo
weeks ago over the same course,
but fell all the way back to fifth
this time.
Indian junior Bob Monzingo
also beat Martin, who has been

slightly troubled by a hip point.
There was actually little doubt
about how the first five would
finish, as they kept the same or
der through the whole race.
Stanford's trouble was again in
its last three runners. John
Northway faded in the late stages
and couldn't get better than 11th.
A 1 Ahumada, in 12th, and last
place Kim Maxwell hurt Stanford
chances even more.
Terrill Coached Team
Assistant coach Jim Terrill,
who led the team while Payton
Jordan remained home with the
flu, said, "It was just Cal's good
team running that beat us. But
we're quite disappointed over our
last three men."

California won the first dual
race between the two this year,
while Stanford was at the same
time lying the Bears in quadran
gular scoring in a meet that also
involved San Jose and USC.
Two weeks ago, the Cards
whipped Cal and heat them again
Friday in the San Jose all-comers
meet.
The teams will meet for ihe
fifth and final time Nov. 2f) on the
Stanford course in the PCC cham
pionship meet.
Off today's race, that meet now
looms as wide open among any of
the four California schools, with
the Northwestern members of the
conference something of an un
known quantity.
