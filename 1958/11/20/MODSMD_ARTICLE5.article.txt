# SCHOOL OR CLINIC
## SF Hospital Fate Hangs In Balance 
### 
The strength of the tie between
the Stanford Hospital in San
Francisco and the new Medical
School on campus will be decided
in the near future, a San Fran
cisco newspaper brought to light
Wednesday.
Responsible campus sources
connected with the Medical School
confirmed the fact that such a de
cision is under consideration and
will probably be reached within a
week.
Two Proposals
Two proposals for continued
operation of the hospital with
some affiliation with the Univer
sity are being studied:
• Stanford would lease the
hospital to private physicians*
and surgeons presently affili
ated with the hospital as mem
bers of its stall or clinical fac
ulty, who wish to retain the
University affiliation while re
maining in San Francisco, for a
token $1 annual fee.
• The hospital would remain
more closely affiliated with the
Medical School, with an associ
ate dvan to direct its work and
a postgraduate training pro
gram, but would be self-sup
porting.
It has been definitely decided,
Medical School sources confirm,
that Stanford service al the San
Francisco General Hospital will
be drastically curtailed after the
1.959-60 fiscal year unless the city
is willing to assume the cost of
this service in accordance with
usual practice in other cities.
Stanford and University of Cal
ifornia Medical Schools have long
assumed public patient care and
intern and resident training at
San Francisco General Hospital,
thus saving the city about $1,000,-
000 annually.
First Plan
If the first plan is adopted,
Stanford will allocate $1,000,000
toward refurbishing the hospital
for San Francisco staff members
wishing to remain in the city,
provided the University can raise
its $22,000,000 fund for the new
medical school plant.
Thus far $17,000,000 of the total
has been secured.
The old Medical School build
ing and Lane Hospital in San
Francisco will be razed and the
space used for University-owned
parking facilities. It is hoped
that the building which presently
houses the Lane Medical Library
may remain in use as a library
once the Lane Collection is moved
to down campus.
Campus Facilities
Architect John Hill has an
nounced that the Medical School
facilities on campus are about
three-fourths complete. Work is
ahead of schedule although the
hospital will not he ready for use
until June, 1959, four months la
ter than scheduled.
The Medical School portion of
the plant will he ready for occu
pancy in August, 1959, two
months ahead of schedule.
Stanford Medical School Alum
nie meeting in San Francisco Fri
day for the school's 100 th anniver
sary will no doubt express opin
ions on the proposals for the dis
posal of the old Stanford Hospi
tal.
