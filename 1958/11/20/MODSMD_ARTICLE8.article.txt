# IFC Open House Plans Hit Enforcement Snag
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
Inter fraternity Council's plan
for limited registration of open
houses —a legal way for women
to go above the first floor of a
men's residence—ran into prob
lems of enforcement at a meeting
of IFC representatives and Dean
of Men William G. Craig Wednes
day afternoon.
Whether Women's Council or
IFC Judicial Council, or both, will
bear the responsibility will he
worked out in a meeting of the
two groups next Monday evening.
The fraternity proposal for
open houses says:
• Fraternities may register
quarterly open houses with the
ASSIJ vice-president for weekly
dinner and or study nights.
Suggested hours for dinner are
5:30 to 7:30 p.m., for study 7 to
12 midnight.
• All other open houses may
be registered on the Tuesday
prior to the event for a specific
occasion (i.e., Friday firesides,
card parties).
This proposal was passed by the
24 fraternity presidents on Nov.
10 after the deans had turned
down the requests from several
houses for permanent open houses
—seven days a week from 2 to 2.
To this proposal Craig suggest
ed a third article:
• Enforcement of the rule
shall lie the mutual responsi
bility of Women's Council and

IFC Judicial Council.
"Women's Social Regulations
have not clarified the responsibil
ity," he said. "All I ask is that,
the ground rules be cleared."
Monday night IFC rejected his
suggested addition 0-24.
"Prospects now look good for
Women's Council to take on the
enforcement itself," said IFC so
cial chairman Bob Davies, Theta
Delta Chi.
This was acceptable to Dean
Craig. He said, "If Women's Coun
cil would assume the responsibil
ity alone, it would be all right
with me."

Inter fraternity Council's plan
for limited registration of open
houses —a legal way for women
to go above the first floor of a
men's residence—ran into prob
lems of enforcement at a meeting
of IFC representatives and Dean
of Men William G. Craig Wednes
day afternoon.
Whether Women's Council or
IFC Judicial Council, or both, will
bear the responsibility will he
worked out in a meeting of the
two groups next Monday evening.
The fraternity proposal for
open houses says:
• Fraternities may register
quarterly open houses with the
ASSIJ vice-president for weekly
dinner and or study nights.
Suggested hours for dinner are
5:30 to 7:30 p.m., for study 7 to
12 midnight.
• All other open houses may
be registered on the Tuesday
prior to the event for a specific
occasion (i.e., Friday firesides,
card parties).
This proposal was passed by the
24 fraternity presidents on Nov.
10 after the deans had turned
down the requests from several
houses for permanent open houses
—seven days a week from 2 to 2.
To this proposal Craig suggest
ed a third article:
• Enforcement of the rule
shall lie the mutual responsi
bility of Women's Council and

IFC Judicial Council.
"Women's Social Regulations
have not clarified the responsibil
ity," he said. "All I ask is that,
the ground rules be cleared."
Monday night IFC rejected his
suggested addition 0-24.
"Prospects now look good for
Women's Council to take on the
enforcement itself," said IFC so
cial chairman Bob Davies, Theta
Delta Chi.
This was acceptable to Dean
Craig. He said, "If Women's Coun
cil would assume the responsibil
ity alone, it would be all right
with me."
Discussion of the proposal ap

column and in the editorial of
Wednesday's Daily.
