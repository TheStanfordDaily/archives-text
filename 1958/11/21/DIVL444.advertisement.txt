Lockheed Missile Systems Division has created a number of special, new openings with
unusual opportunities for fall graduates in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering,
aeronautical engineering, mathematics or physics.
The Division is engaged in a broad program of basic research in all areas of scientific
activity in missile and space technology, including advanced systems research; nucleonics;
physics; chemistry; mathematics; design; test; electronics; flight sciences; and
manufacturing. Some of the important studies under investigation are: man in space; space
communications; ionic and plasma propulsion; space physics; nuclear propulsion;
magnetothermodynamics; oceanography; computing machine memories; human engineering;
noise suppression; materials and processes; boundary layer control; electro magnetic wave
propagation and radiation; and operations research and analysis.
Lockheed is systems manager for such major long-term projects as the Navy Polaris IRBM;
Air Force 0-5 and X-7; Army Kingfisher and other important research and development programs.
The Division was honored at the first National Missile Industry Conference as "the organization
that contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of missiles and astronautics."
LOCATION
Headquarters for the Division are at Sunnyvale on the San Francisco Peninsula and new modern
Research and Development facilities are located in the Stanford Industrial Park in nearby Palo
Alto. A four thousand acre company-owned static test base is located in the Ben Lomond
mountains thirty miles from Sunnyvale. Other Division locations are at Van Nuys and Santa
Maria, California; Cape Canaveral, Florida and Alamogordo, New Mexico. Together, they
occupy more than two million square feet of laboratory, engineering, manufacturing and office
II space and provide the latest in scientific and technical equipment.
