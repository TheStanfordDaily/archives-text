### Russ Allen 
California * Stanford rivalry is
an old story to residents of The
Farm, Bay Area and the Pacific
Coast. But to one of the key fig
ures in Saturday's clash, it's some
thing new.
Stanford mentor Jack Curtice
is the newcomer getting his first
chance to participate in the
Coast's oldest rivalry — the Big
Game.
Big games in the general sense
arc not new to Cactus Jack, who
has coached many teams in cru
cial rivalry contests. Stanford
fans can't forget his most recent
claim to national prominence vic
tories by his West club over fa
voivd "East teams in the last two
annual Shrine game*.
In 19.% he was on the staff that
coached the West, led by former
Card quarterback John Brodie. to

a' 7-6 victory. Last year Curtice's
Western stars, including Tribe
quarterback Jackie Douglas, end
Gary Van Galdcr and guard Don
Manoukian, heat the East, 27-14.
Curtice also remembers another
annual contest which saw his Col
lege All-Stars lake on the power
ful Chicago Bears •shortly after
World War 11.
Besides top national games, the
Indian chief noted that "for 21
straight years I have played in
traditional big-game rivalries fin
Thanksgiving Day, and some of
them have been the best I've
seen."
This year will be the first that
the popular Card coach has not
played on Turkey Day, but the
Bear-Tribe meeting promises to
match Curtice's past Thanksgiv

Another Thanksgiving rivalry
I which Curtice remembers as al
ways intense is the Texas West
ern-New Mexico game. The two
schools are located close together,
and there is always a lot of local
interest fanned up for the game.
Utah and Texas Western have
each won a majority of these tra
ditionals with Curtice at the helm.
Stanford's hope is that he can con
tinue the skein with the Indians.
