It's Just About Here
Big Game, 1958 is right over the mountains now, so rlose you can
reach out and touch it; so close, too, that it's impossible to predict
just what might happen in the West's greatest classic.
It's a funny thing, this Big Game. For some reason it doesn't
seem like a football game. It's more like some fantastic television
spectacular that's been scripted and blocked for quite some lime;
one loam will win, it'll be an exciting game, maybe even a tie, and
it's guaranteed to supply every sports writer with enough copy to
fill a newspaper, and every broadcaster with enough color to make
him wish held stuck to acting.
There's only one thing about it that doesn't seem natural, and
lhal one thing is what has made Big Game one of the nation's great
traditionals. This is simply that no one can say which team will play
which role once the opening gun sounds.
It's about this time every year that publicity directors like Don
TJeheiulorfei* of Stanford and Bill Steiner and Paul Ciiristopolus of

mean nothing in the Big Game."
And almost every sports writer
either 1 says pretty much the same
thing or thinks it when he
makes a prediction of Ihe tilt.
And the funny or great- part
about it all is that they are abso- i
lutely right. The best thing to
do is bundle all Ihe season's totals
and perforrrtances up and tie
them with a big string before
dumping them off Iho Bay Bridge '
on the way to Berkeley.
In the twisted logic that the
season's finale usually brings to
the fore there's no reason for \
anyone to pick Stanford as any
thing but the favorite.
Before the season started it was |
said thai Stanford wouldn't go
very far, but that they might ■
come up with a few surprises, j
Cal, on the other hand, was picked ]
as slightly better. Cal has had '
almost a top-notch season and
Stanford's . . . well, anything but
ton notch. Cal is loaded with tal-

fiit much of it overshadowed by all-publicity man Joe Kapp. Stan
lord's squad members have almost to a man been disappointing,
looking al it from the pie-season angle.
In the midst of il all, this writer overheard a conversation the
other day which is pretty typical of a Big Game philosophy. What
impressed me the most was a simple statement:: "This is (lie kind of
year (lint Stanford usually wins'the Big Game." I, for one, believe it.
All I lie Many Viewpoints
To use a very common Stanford phrase, "it's amazing" to look
at Big Came from the many possible standpoints. When you do (his,
you begin to wonder how many think of il as an athletic contest.
The campus wits have been al work for weeks thinking up torts
and retorts to .shout at one another. The bandsmen of both schools
have been looking forward to their half-time battles for applause ever
since they first donned their uniforms.
Yd! leaders ;it both campuses live for their final day of glory,
and you can bet that I hey'll come up with some great performances
before 11 it* sun sets around Strawberry Canyon. Rally Committees
have come up to other games throughout the season but none quite
come up to any other like Big Game.
All the work of stamping up the card stunt instructions, or of
drawing them, for that matter, or even putting out Ihe cards at the
Stadium becomes more enjoyable. Campus social groups wait for
the Big Game to come along because it provides such an excellent
excuse for the autumn quarter social overnights.
Still others see Big Game as an event which somehow cancels all
tests in the week which precedes it. And this is a strange phenome
non in a university community. Journalists, who very much resemble
the staff of this paper, look on Big Game as the one great opportu
nity to express all the drama which they house in their bosoms.
But let's pause a minute to give praise to these particular kids,
as we wish we could to all we mention. Perhaps it's because this
subject is so close that we dwell a bit longer here.
This Big Game Edition of The Daily is the product of countless
hours of research and writing—and, lest I be reminded by fellow
members of the Editorial Board, organization. It's been a pleasure
to work on. it's a joy to see it roll off the press—even though that
is a sign to most of us that an all-night vigil is upcoming while we
stuff that section two into the first. Still, we feel it is but one small
part of Big Game Week, and we're happy to do our part. Those who
have worked with us on this issue deserve our congratulations;
hereby given.
Including the Athletes'
Despite the many divergent opinions which come out of Big Game,
Ihere arealways at least 22 men on the lurf to whom it is what it
once started out to be- just a football game.
Hold on a minule, though! I don't mean JUST a football game;
it's more to even them.
Take unfortunate seniors Boh Peterson and Jim Byrer; to these
guys it's "Big Game, my senior year, and I missed it." A little senti-

mental, to be sure, but; not un
founded.
And then there are guys like
Troy Barbee, Koch Conklin, Don
Dawson, Doug Dick, Kuss Steele,
Koy Stephen, Pete Swanson, Jim
Ukropina and Don Watson. The
story here is "my last Big Game;
the last college ball game I will
play." It gives these guys a de
sire to play a better - than - best
game, and lots of them will come
up to the occasion, too.
To an even greater number this
year's war against Cal is that ex
citing "first Big Game" and a con
current desire to play the best of
all their first-year games.
And this doesn't mean to leave
out the juniors on the squad, ei
ther. To them it's "Big Game"
all right, maybe not the first,
hopefully not the last, but the
sort of game in which you play
better lhan you ever have not
because you should, or because
you think you should, but more
or less because you do . . . be-

cause it's Big Game.
Outside the campuses involved are many thousand other people
who are touched by the electric quality of this great traditional.
These aren't alums, they aren't the kind who care because they were
once ;i part of litis great madness. Instead they're the people who
wouldn't miss Big Game for any reason, the kind who usually are
on lap to grab off Ihe first tickets thai go to the agencies.
In Big (iame I hey see a circus, a Roman carnival, a band concert,
a stage show and a football game all rolled into one. It's like—or
maybe even heller than a trip to Kindling Bros., Barnum and Bailey
used to he. Worth $3? You bet! And worth a lot more to some of
them.
This is Ihe topping-off portion of the 81,409 people who crowd into
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley or the 91,000 who take up Ihe seats
hero al Stanford, the people who make it a foregone conclusion that,
regardless of team records, Big (iame will be a sellout. It always is.
There are aspects that, from year to year, make Big Game a little
different. Take this year for example. Cactus Jack Curtice and
fete F.lliott both will be gunning for their first Big Game victories,
and Ihe squads of both, as a tribute to their feelings toward these
fine men, will he out to see il happen. Cal, after a miserable season
last year, wanted il lo cap Pete's first year. Stanford, this year,*is
in exactly Ihe same position.
