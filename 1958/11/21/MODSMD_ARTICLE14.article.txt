# Many Experts See Upset

One thing's certain about the
Big Game: there isn't any such
thing as a favorite.
And that has been reflected in
Ihe predictions of sportswriters,
broadcasters, players and former
stars throughout the Pacific Coast
Conference.
While Cal came out the general
favorite of the forecasters, there
was the general feeling that, yes,
Stanford had very much of a
chance . . . and there were many
of the predictors who couldn't
withhold the wishful thinking that
called for a Card win.
Players on two teams which
stand to benefit very much from
a Stanford victory were queried,
w i th somewhat opposite reac
tions:
TED BATES, Oregon State AII-
Amcrican tackle: Cal should win,
26-IH. It will be a real close game,
but Cal looks a touchdown better.
NUB BEAM MR, Oregon State
All-Coast fullback: I take Cal, 21-
8. The Bears are real tough, es
pecially up the middle.
DON FLUNGSEN, Washing
ton State All-American end: We
think Cal has been playing over
its head most of the year. Kapp
can be stopped, lie's big, but not
fast. Our hopes rest on a Stan
ford win.
TED CA.NO, Washington State
halfback < former San Francisco
prep start: We would give any
thing to play Cal again. Stanford
has got to win the Big Game.
Writers and broadcasters who
follow OSC, WSC and I JSC" also
had wishes for a Stanford tri
umph:
CHICK lIEARN, I'CC telecast
er: Based on won-lost records or
comparative scores, California's
Bears must be favored. If Stan
ford is to win Saturday, the In
dians will have to come up with
their best game of 1958. But the
Stanfords can pull the upset of
the year if (1) they can avoid
devastating fumbles and (2) if the
Stanford line plays 60 minutes of
inspired rock 'n' sock football.
DICK HYLAND, Los Angeles
Times: Football is half spir it, half
ability. On record and ability,
Stanford -should lose; on spirit, it
can win.
DOUG LA MEAR, KGW - TV,
Portland: Cal can he beaten. They
have some real weaknesses that
can be exploited. 1 like the way
Jack Curtice teaches football, and
will be hoping for a Stanford win.
SID /IFF, Los Angeles Mirror-
News sports editor: I believe Cali
fornia might be vulnerable to a
pepped-up Stanford team playing
the same sort of game the Tribe
did against lICLA. Cal has a good
first team but one of the weakest
second teams I have seen in years
. . .and coach Pete Elliott dearly
loves to play his second team.
HARRY MISSILDINE, Spokane
Spokesman-Review sports editor:
Around Spokane, where Washing

ton State followers abound, the
feeling is: those who hoped Wash
ington would beat Cal last week
are now praying for "Eucalyptus
Jack" to work a miracle.
WALT GAMAGE, Palo Alto
Times sports editor: Stanford 23,
California 22. Counting on Rose
Bowl pressure on Cal to work for
the Injuns.
When the Bay Area "experts"
got to making their predictions,
they began to look like the big
gest "realists" of the bunch . . .
but nearly all war ned ('al of an
upset.
ALAN WARI), Oakland Trib
une sports editor: Cal should win,
although Stanford may play one
of its better games. The Bears
merely have too much over-all
ability for the game Indians. Joe
Kapp, of course, represents the
big difference.
DM K FRIENDI.ICH, San ! ran
ciso Chronicle: The brutal facts
this year—it will be close, but no
cigar for the Indians. California
22, Stanford 14.
AIM ROSENBAUM, San Fran
risen Chronicle: Pefe Elliott suf
fered last year as a beginner. Now j
Jack Curtice must expect to go
through the same hard school of
defeats. California in the Rose
Bowl 1959, Stanford 1900. Cal will
win, 22-14.
Jlsl SCOTT, Berkeley Gaaette
sports editor: California should-!
KAPPsize Stanford . . . 35-21.
DUTCH EELLS, Cal star of the
1920'5: California 20, Stanford 8,;
on the basis that Stanford will be!
as generous with the football in j
the Big Game as in some of their
other games this season. Cactus
Jack Curtice has done a fine job
in bringing the boys along, but
the loss of Rick McMillen has
made, a difference in Stanford's
standing.
JACK McDONALI), San Fran
cisco Call-Bulletin sports editor: !
California 20, Stanford 13. Too
much Joe Kapp, but the Indians
will give the Bears a good scare, j
WILL CONNOLLY, San Fran- j
ciso Chronicle: Cal by 7-6 or may-1
be 8-7. I am not firm in my choice
of Cal. The Stanfords are notori
ously "oddballs" | meant affection
atelyl and, on a given day, are
capable of heating anybody.
NO KM STANDLEE, All-Ameri-!
can fullback of Stanford "Wow

Boys," 1940-41: Off our perform
ance against OS(\ I'd say we've
come a long way. I'll take Stan
ford in the Big Game by two.
Things have been going just right
for I he other team all season
long; it's about time for us to
have one of those clays.
4 A ( Kli: JENSEN, < al All !
American fullback, 1948, All Star
right fielder of Boston Red Sox:
I'm afraid Cal is too strong for
the Indians his year. Jack Cur
lice has done a fine job, but 1
think his material is too thin to
keep the pressure on for 00 min
utes. Even though Cal is far from
perfect on defense, I believe
they'll be able to outseore the In
dians.
And il looks like C a ie t ie s
missed out on something . . . for
KEN McDONALD of the Antiocli
Ledger offers:
"With Cactus Jack Curtice fur-1

nishing the accompaniment to
the tune of 'Boulevard of Broken
Dreams,' Stanford may provide
Cal's swan song along these lines:
'The Old Blues are full of sorrow
Down the boulevards of Berke

Where Nikolai and Nieolet
Will pose a double threat
And send their 1 bowl hopes

One thing's certain about the

While Cal came out the general
favorite of the forecasters, there
was the general feeling that, yes,
Stanford had very much of a
chance . . . and there were many
of the predictors who couldn't
withhold the wishful thinking that
called for a Card win.
Players on two teams which
stand to benefit very much from
a Stanford victory were queried,

TED BATES, Oregon State AII-
Amcrican tackle: Cal should win,
26-IH. It will be a real close game,
but Cal looks a touchdown better.
NUB BEAM MR, Oregon State
All-Coast fullback: I take Cal, 21-

pecially up the middle.
DON FLUNGSEN, Washing

its head most of the year. Kapp
can be stopped, lie's big, but not
fast. Our hopes rest on a Stan
ford win.
TED CA.NO, Washington State
halfback < former San Francisco

thing to play Cal again. Stanford
has got to win the Big Game.
Writers and broadcasters who
follow OSC, WSC and I JSC" also
had wishes for a Stanford tri

CHICK lIEARN, I'CC telecast
er: Based on won-lost records or
comparative scores, California's
Bears must be favored. If Stan
ford is to win Saturday, the In
dians will have to come up with
their best game of 1958. But the
Stanfords can pull the upset of
the year if (1) they can avoid
devastating fumbles and (2) if the
Stanford line plays 60 minutes of
inspired rock 'n' sock football.
DICK HYLAND, Los Angeles

ability. On record and ability,
Stanford -should lose; on spirit, it
can win.
DOUG LA MEAR, KGW - TV,

have some real weaknesses that
can be exploited. 1 like the way
Jack Curtice teaches football, and
will be hoping for a Stanford win.

a Stanford victory were queried,

Bears must be favored. If Stan
ford is to win Saturday, the In
dians will have to come up with
their best game of 1958. But the
Stanfords can pull the upset of
the year if (1) they can avoid
devastating fumbles and (2) if the
Stanford line plays 60 minutes of

Conference.
While Cal came out the general
favorite of the forecasters, there
was the general feeling that, yes,
Stanford had very much of a
chance . . . and there were many
of the predictors who couldn't
withhold the wishful thinking that
called for a Card win.
Players on two teams which
stand to benefit very much from
a Stanford victory were queried,
w i th somewhat opposite reac
tions:
TED BATES, Oregon State AII-
Amcrican tackle: Cal should win,
26-IH. It will be a real close game,
but Cal looks a touchdown better.
NUB BEAM MR, Oregon State
All-Coast fullback: I take Cal, 21-
8. The Bears are real tough, es
pecially up the middle.
DON FLUNGSEN, Washing
ton State All-American end: We
think Cal has been playing over
its head most of the year. Kapp
can be stopped, lie's big, but not
fast. Our hopes rest on a Stan
ford win.
TED CA.NO, Washington State
halfback < former San Francisco
prep start: We would give any
thing to play Cal again. Stanford
has got to win the Big Game.
Writers and broadcasters who
follow OSC, WSC and I JSC" also
had wishes for a Stanford tri
umph:
CHICK lIEARN, I'CC telecast
er: Based on won-lost records or
comparative scores, California's
Bears must be favored. If Stan
ford is to win Saturday, the In
dians will have to come up with
their best game of 1958. But the
Stanfords can pull the upset of
the year if (1) they can avoid
devastating fumbles and (2) if the
Stanford line plays 60 minutes of
inspired rock 'n' sock football.
DICK HYLAND, Los Angeles
Times: Football is half spir it, half
ability. On record and ability,
Stanford -should lose; on spirit, it
can win.
DOUG LA MEAR, KGW - TV,
Portland: Cal can he beaten. They
have some real weaknesses that
can be exploited. 1 like the way
Jack Curtice teaches football, and
will be hoping for a Stanford win.
SID /IFF, Los Angeles Mirror-
News sports editor: I believe Cali
fornia might be vulnerable to a
pepped-up Stanford team playing
the same sort of game the Tribe
did against lICLA. Cal has a good
first team but one of the weakest
second teams I have seen in years
. . .and coach Pete Elliott dearly
loves to play his second team.
HARRY MISSILDINE, Spokane
Spokesman-Review sports editor:
Around Spokane, where Washing

ton State followers abound, the
feeling is: those who hoped Wash
ington would beat Cal last week
are now praying for "Eucalyptus
Jack" to work a miracle.
WALT GAMAGE, Palo Alto
Times sports editor: Stanford 23,
California 22. Counting on Rose
Bowl pressure on Cal to work for
the Injuns.
When the Bay Area "experts"
got to making their predictions,
they began to look like the big
gest "realists" of the bunch . . .
but nearly all war ned ('al of an
upset.
ALAN WARI), Oakland Trib
une sports editor: Cal should win,
although Stanford may play one
of its better games. The Bears
merely have too much over-all
ability for the game Indians. Joe
Kapp, of course, represents the
big difference.
DM K FRIENDI.ICH, San ! ran
ciso Chronicle: The brutal facts
this year—it will be close, but no
cigar for the Indians. California
22, Stanford 14.
AIM ROSENBAUM, San Fran
risen Chronicle: Pefe Elliott suf
fered last year as a beginner. Now j
Jack Curtice must expect to go
through the same hard school of
defeats. California in the Rose
Bowl 1959, Stanford 1900. Cal will
win, 22-14.
Jlsl SCOTT, Berkeley Gaaette
sports editor: California should-!
KAPPsize Stanford . . . 35-21.
DUTCH EELLS, Cal star of the
1920'5: California 20, Stanford 8,;
on the basis that Stanford will be!
as generous with the football in j
the Big Game as in some of their
other games this season. Cactus
Jack Curtice has done a fine job
in bringing the boys along, but
the loss of Rick McMillen has
made, a difference in Stanford's
standing.
JACK McDONALI), San Fran
cisco Call-Bulletin sports editor: !
California 20, Stanford 13. Too
much Joe Kapp, but the Indians
will give the Bears a good scare, j
WILL CONNOLLY, San Fran- j
ciso Chronicle: Cal by 7-6 or may-1
be 8-7. I am not firm in my choice
of Cal. The Stanfords are notori
ously "oddballs" | meant affection
atelyl and, on a given day, are
capable of heating anybody.
NO KM STANDLEE, All-Ameri-!
can fullback of Stanford "Wow

Boys," 1940-41: Off our perform
ance against OS(\ I'd say we've
come a long way. I'll take Stan
ford in the Big Game by two.
Things have been going just right
for I he other team all season
long; it's about time for us to
have one of those clays.
4 A ( Kli: JENSEN, < al All !
American fullback, 1948, All Star
right fielder of Boston Red Sox:
I'm afraid Cal is too strong for
the Indians his year. Jack Cur
lice has done a fine job, but 1
think his material is too thin to
keep the pressure on for 00 min
utes. Even though Cal is far from
perfect on defense, I believe
they'll be able to outseore the In
dians.
And il looks like C a ie t ie s
missed out on something . . . for
KEN McDONALD of the Antiocli
Ledger offers:
"With Cactus Jack Curtice fur-1

nishing the accompaniment to
the tune of 'Boulevard of Broken
Dreams,' Stanford may provide
Cal's swan song along these lines:
'The Old Blues are full of sorrow
Down the boulevards of Berke
ley town,
Where Nikolai and Nieolet
Will pose a double threat
And send their 1 bowl hopes
down.' "
One thing's certain about the
Big Game: there isn't any such
thing as a favorite.
And that has been reflected in
Ihe predictions of sportswriters,
broadcasters, players and former
stars throughout the Pacific Coast
