# Macabre Campanile Has More Uses Than Symbol
## 
### Lynn Patchett 
Cal's overgrown splinter, Sather Tower (affectionately known as
The Campanile) is the "spiritual center" of life on the University of
California campus.
In this capacity it serves usefully as storage place for volumes
of Idaho's 1921 census, for the skulls of 1300 saber-toothed tigers

(refugees from the anthropology
museum i and, as legend has it,
for the skeletons of those who
first stole the Stanford Axe in
1899.
Erected in 1915, this caricature
of Venice's famous St. Mark's
Campanile was predicted by geol
ogists to stand weathering for a
thousand years.
However, the cement holding
the granite stones to the steel
structure proved less lasting, and
ihe tower was closed for repairs
last year when too many worship
ful tourists barely missed oblivion
from falling slabs of granite.
Big Bottom
The unstable structure was
built to be earthquake-proof on
the saltcellar principle—big bot
tom with not much top. The prin
ciple worked too well, and the
skinny saltcellar was seen sway
ing with no apparent cause.
Alarmed university officials
callpd for a physics investigation,
which came up with the informa
tion that slight pressure of the
hind at a certain point up the
tower's side would set the Cam
panile rocking.
Still Growing?
Like the traditional "fish sto
ry," the Campanile's height in
creases with succeeding Cal pub
lications. One story gives the
height at 301 feet, saying that the
architect added the extra foot
when it was learned that the tall
?st Eastern campanile was 300
feet high. Western supremacy?

Raucous chimes from the 12
bolls open and close !ho university
day. They sounded perhaps their
•sweetest when they played
"Praise God from Whom All
Blessings Flow" at 2:30 a.m. on
Nov. 11, 1918, to signal (he signing
of armistice for World War I.
The Campanile is also the butt
of Cal pranksters' jokes. At Eas
ter four years ago a rabbit was
found on its well-lit pinnacle.
