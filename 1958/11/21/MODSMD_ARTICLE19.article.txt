victor go the spoils: a trophy.
The traditional Chaparral-Peli

Chappie business manager, was,

I however, "We had to work so hard
j to win the Daily game, we just
don't want to play another. At
I any rate, we don't know of any
| game."
The Class of GO Excoms tangle

holic beverage (again, the one
made by brewing and fermenta
tion from cereals: all biology stu
dents take note).
Saturday morning also brings
out Zeta Psi chapters in a battle t
for 1 that happy feeling produced
by the prize (a favorite quencher
of parched throats) (only a penny
more a can).
Phi Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta
Theta chapters meet their Cal

longer lasting reward, a trophy.
In the last scheduled game be- !
fore the weekend closes, played

one is novel!) A 60-yi ar-oid, heat
up. handleless axe.
