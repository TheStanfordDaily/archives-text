# 1892: STANDFORD BEATS CAL, 14-10
## S.F. Went Wild At 1st Big Game 
### Ceci Wittmann 
"The first Game' was not the beginning of 'Affairs' with
Berkeley. The Powers at Cal resented Stanford from the start. That
was the first sign of a college feud."

So tolls Arthur H. Barnhisel, a 1
ball loam, in his comments and m
first Big flame, written Ibis fall
especially for The Daily.
"It began wilh tho conception in
the minds of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford when they announced!
their plan to endow a great new
University. Berkeley was against
it. 'There is no need or room for
two universities in our state,'
they said. That was where the
hot blood of an institutional feud
began to run never quite to the j
point of murder, but theoretically j
governed by the .spirit of sport. |
"The date of the Big Game was S
finally set March 19, '92.
"Arrangements . . . were made
by student leaders who knew San
Francisco and Berkeley men. I

remember distinctly when word
was passed around that plans for
a game with California were be
ing worked out.
"I do not know that any writ
ten challenge was issued or ac
cepted. California being the long
s t a n ding and acknowledged
'champion' could not be expected
to recognize an outfit of bush
leaguers.
Started by Stanford
"Stanford initiated the 'ap
proach' according to the intent
and spirit of the team as the play
ers began to develop confidence
and feel their oats. Word then
passed around that Berkeley had
accepted.
"Berkeley was painting the
towns and San Francisco with
headlines in newspapers urging
the whole Bay population to show
up on Ilaight Street Ball Field
and watch the 'Berkeley Baby Ele
phants make doormats of Stan
ford Rustics.' Stanford said little,
but spent long hours practicing
two secret plays.
"Perfect Day"
"March 19 opened and contin
ued a perfect day. I have a vivid
memory of part or all of the team
driving from the foot of Market.
Street in a four-in-hand tallyho
out through City center traffic
with flaming cardinal flags, Stan
ford yells and horns making a
record noise. These Farmers were
really going to town and the
town knew that Stanford had ar
rived."
Barnhisel and the rest of the

member of the first Stanford foot
emories of early Stanford and the

Stanford team arrived to find The
City swarming with red and blue
and gold that had been up since
morning. Students had rented
coaches, and were rushing up and
down Mar ket Slreot waving flags,
blowing tin horns, ringing cow
bells and shouting loudly. Over
the general roar the Calmed stu
dents were heard:
"Hah—Rah—Rah!
Skeletonia!
U.C.M.D.!
Hip bone all!"
Stanford's base was the Lick
House, which had been decorated
for the occasion by the gung-ho
boys. Everybody there wore red
on their hats and sleeves.
Cal, not wanting to be outdone,
pulled the same act at the Palace
Hotel, their rallying-ground.
Heavy Betting
It was generally expected that
since their players were heavier,
Cal would win, and betting on the
result was quite lively. Hours be
fore the game was called, Cal
men were offering three and four
to one that their team would win.
It was a great game, and there
was a great crowd. Seven thou
sand were gathered in the park,
and 2000 more stood on the out
side of the fence to watch the his
tory-making game.
Cal: Five to One
The grandstand was a mass of
color. On the north side of the
grounds were Stanford support
ers, outnumbered five to one by
their Cal rivals.
When the players entered the
field, Cal yells completely
drowned out Stanford's "Rah!
Rah! Rah!— Rah! Rah — Stan
ford!"
"Golly, boys," remarked a gen
tleman who had never seen a foot
ball game; "if the game is to be

won by shouting, the Palo Alto
lads won't be in it."
After their 14-10 victory, Stan
ford men streamed back into
town. Cable cars overflowed with
the sweating Stanfordites, deco
rated in red and white.
Most of the students went to
the Bush Street Theater, packing
the already shaky building from
floor to ceiling, waving flags,
blowing whistles and making
loud but appropriate remarks
about the performers on stage.
"Oil, mamma," said one enthu
siastic Stanford man. "What have
1 lived for until now?"
Leaving the theater, they all
headed for Norman's, where they
demanded possession of the up
per room for a beer-party. When
the saloon-keeper, a staid sort, re
fused this small request, the
cheering crowd moved on down
Kearny Street.
On the corner of Sutter they
struck a bonanza. There stood
their old - time fellow • collegian,
Lawrence Kip, who was nearly
mobbed with the handshaking
showered upon him. Finally he
extended his hospitality to the
bunch, and all went to the near
est bar. The young lawyer mount
ed the counter and led the yells
with such vigor that pictures rat
tled off the walls:
"Ha, ha, ha!
\Vah. wall, wall!
U.C. Berkeley, ha, ha, ha!

And then came:
I "Ila, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Stanford!"
This opened the ball.
A group of tired-looking young
fellows, several of them with bat
tered faces and bruised hands,
filed into a box on the left-hand
side of the stage. They were the
defeated Berkeley football team.
Though conquered, they had
spunk enough to defiantly hang
out the blue and gold.
The yelling grew louder from
the red-draped Stanford side.
"Go home to your mammas,"
someone shouted.
"Wah, ho, wah! Stanford! Stan
ford!" screamed the students, as
they joined the chorus:
"They never smiled again,
They never smiled again,
They never, never, never,
Never smiled again."
