# SERIES EVEN: 25-25-10
## Top Thrillers in '24, '47 
### 
Sixty Big Games have come
and gone since the first idea for
such a contest was born in 1892
—but not a thing has been set
tled so far as superiority is con
cerned.
Stanford has left the field vic
torious 25 times; California has
won 25 other times. The teams
have battled to a deadlock 10
times.
Upsets have come to be the
rule rather than the exception.
And nearly all of the 60 Big
Games have been thrillers. How
ever. two India n-Bear brawls
stand out as perhaps .i us t a
shade more exciting, a bit more
climactic than the other 58.
The first of the pair came in
1924. Stanford was unbeaten in
seven starts that year; the Bears
had only two ties to mar their
record. To the winner would go
the Pacific Coast Conference ti
tle and the Rose Bowl bid.
Early Lead
Stanford got off to an early
6 0 lead on a pair of field goals
by halfback Murray Cuddebaek,
but it didn't last long. Califor
nia took over with three touch*
downs, rolling up a 20-6 lead by
the end of the third period.
With five minutes to play,
Stanford picked up what looked
to bo only a token score as Ed
Walker passed to end Ted Ship
key. Cuddcback's conversion
made it 20-13.
But moments later Stanford
had the ball again, and Cudde
baek was on the receiving end of

another Walker pitch and it was
20-19. And then Cuddebaek calm
ly booted the extra point that
tied the score at 20-20 and gave
the Indians what some think is
the greatest comeback in their
history.
Turnabout
Stanford was the victim of a
comeback in 1917. The Indians
of Marehie Schwartz hadn't won
a game all season—even Idaho
had beaten them. Cal, on the
other hand, was Rose Bowl
bound, with just a single loss on
its record. By game time the
Market Street operators in San
Francisco were quoting 10-1 and
40-point odds.
The start was as expected —
Cal driving 64 yards to a 7 0 lead.
Surprisingly, Stanford moved to
within a point as Ainslie Bell
passed to Wayne Erickson from
the 4-yard line. Then came an
other exchange of touchdowns
and it was 1 M 2.
Three minutes into the fourth
quarter, bedlam broke loose nn
the Stanford side as the Cards
drove 66 yards. Don Campbell
passing 11 yardti to Bob Ander
son for an iS-U Indian lead.
The Intramural Pass
Less than f<"»ur minutes re
mained when California came
up with the most famous play
in Big Game history -the intra
mural pass from Jackie Jensen
to Paul Keckley.
Taking a pitch-out from quar
terback Bob Celeri, Jensen cir

cled to his right, then spied Keck
ley loose 40 yards down field to
the left. He threw a floater that
Keek ley had to eome back 20
yards to get -and it was a shoe
string catch, at that.
60 Long Yards
Turning once again, the Bear
twisted his way through several
groping Indians and went 60
yards to the score that cost Stan
ford what would have been the
biggest, upset in Big Game his
tory.
Plenty more Big Game* have
been nearly as thrilling tho 7-7
tie of 1950; the 21-21 deadlock of
1933; Cal's conversion victory in
19.56; the '33, '31 and '35 vic
tories of the Vow Boys.
Of the ties, the '53 affair was
most bitter for Stanford. The
Indians had upset UCLA, 21-20,
that year to move into prime
Kose Bowl consideration. De
spite a 23-20 loss to USC, the
bid still appeared to tie Stan
ford's if il could beat the Bears.
Looked Good, at First
Bob Garrett and Company
took a 21 7 lead, but the Berke
ley troupe of Paul Larson came
back strong to tie the came at
21 -all. and knock the Cards out
nf the Bowl. Monday's Daily
headlined its story, "N'obody
Won, but We Lost."
But ihr> past has passed; what
matters now is which team will
win its '26th Big Game victory
to take the series load—and the
Axe.

to take the series load—and the
Axe.
Sixty Big Games have come
and gone since the first idea for
such a contest was born in 1892
—but not a thing has been set
tled so far as superiority is con
cerned.
Stanford has left the field vic
torious 25 times; California has
won 25 other times. The teams
have battled to a deadlock 10
times.
Upsets have come to be the
rule rather than the exception.
And nearly all of the 60 Big
Games have been thrillers. How
ever. two India n-Bear brawls
stand out as perhaps .i us t a
shade more exciting, a bit more
climactic than the other 58.
The first of the pair came in
1924. Stanford was unbeaten in
seven starts that year; the Bears
had only two ties to mar their
record. To the winner would go
the Pacific Coast Conference ti
tle and the Rose Bowl bid.
Early Lead
Stanford got off to an early
6 0 lead on a pair of field goals
by halfback Murray Cuddebaek,
but it didn't last long. Califor
nia took over with three touch*
downs, rolling up a 20-6 lead by
the end of the third period.
With five minutes to play,
Stanford picked up what looked
to bo only a token score as Ed
Walker passed to end Ted Ship
key. Cuddcback's conversion
made it 20-13.
But moments later Stanford
had the ball again, and Cudde
baek was on the receiving end of

another Walker pitch and it was
20-19. And then Cuddebaek calm
ly booted the extra point that
tied the score at 20-20 and gave
the Indians what some think is
the greatest comeback in their
history.
Turnabout
Stanford was the victim of a
comeback in 1917. The Indians
of Marehie Schwartz hadn't won
a game all season—even Idaho
had beaten them. Cal, on the
other hand, was Rose Bowl
bound, with just a single loss on
its record. By game time the
Market Street operators in San
Francisco were quoting 10-1 and
40-point odds.
The start was as expected —
Cal driving 64 yards to a 7 0 lead.
Surprisingly, Stanford moved to
within a point as Ainslie Bell
passed to Wayne Erickson from
the 4-yard line. Then came an
other exchange of touchdowns
and it was 1 M 2.
Three minutes into the fourth
quarter, bedlam broke loose nn
the Stanford side as the Cards
drove 66 yards. Don Campbell
passing 11 yardti to Bob Ander
son for an iS-U Indian lead.
The Intramural Pass
Less than f<"»ur minutes re
mained when California came
up with the most famous play
in Big Game history -the intra
mural pass from Jackie Jensen
to Paul Keckley.
Taking a pitch-out from quar
terback Bob Celeri, Jensen cir

cled to his right, then spied Keck
ley loose 40 yards down field to
the left. He threw a floater that
Keek ley had to eome back 20
yards to get -and it was a shoe
string catch, at that.
60 Long Yards
Turning once again, the Bear
twisted his way through several
groping Indians and went 60
yards to the score that cost Stan
ford what would have been the
biggest, upset in Big Game his
tory.

Cal driving 64 yards to a 7 0 lead.
Surprisingly, Stanford moved to
within a point as Ainslie Bell
passed to Wayne Erickson from
the 4-yard line. Then came an
other exchange of touchdowns
and it was 1 M 2.
Three minutes into the fourth
quarter, bedlam broke loose nn
the Stanford side as the Cards
drove 66 yards. Don Campbell
passing 11 yardti to Bob Ander
son for an iS-U Indian lead.
The Intramural Pass
Less than f<"»ur minutes re
mained when California came
up with the most famous play
in Big Game history -the intra
mural pass from Jackie Jensen
to Paul Keckley.
Taking a pitch-out from quar
terback Bob Celeri, Jensen cir

cled to his right, then spied Keck
ley loose 40 yards down field to
the left. He threw a floater that
Keek ley had to eome back 20
yards to get -and it was a shoe
string catch, at that.
60 Long Yards
Turning once again, the Bear
twisted his way through several
groping Indians and went 60
yards to the score that cost Stan
ford what would have been the
biggest, upset in Big Game his
tory.
Plenty more Big Game* have
been nearly as thrilling tho 7-7
tie of 1950; the 21-21 deadlock of
1933; Cal's conversion victory in
19.56; the '33, '31 and '35 vic
tories of the Vow Boys.
Of the ties, the '53 affair was
most bitter for Stanford. The
Indians had upset UCLA, 21-20,
that year to move into prime
Kose Bowl consideration. De
spite a 23-20 loss to USC, the
bid still appeared to tie Stan
ford's if il could beat the Bears.
Looked Good, at First
Bob Garrett and Company
took a 21 7 lead, but the Berke
ley troupe of Paul Larson came
back strong to tie the came at
21 -all. and knock the Cards out
nf the Bowl. Monday's Daily
headlined its story, "N'obody
Won, but We Lost."
But ihr> past has passed; what
matters now is which team will
win its '26th Big Game victory
to take the series load—and the
Axe.
Sixty Big Games have come
and gone since the first idea for
such a contest was born in 1892
—but not a thing has been set
tled so far as superiority is con
cerned.
Stanford has left the field vic
torious 25 times; California has
won 25 other times. The teams
have battled to a deadlock 10
times.
Upsets have come to be the
rule rather than the exception.
And nearly all of the 60 Big
Games have been thrillers. How
ever. two India n-Bear brawls
stand out as perhaps .i us t a
shade more exciting, a bit more
climactic than the other 58.
The first of the pair came in
1924. Stanford was unbeaten in
seven starts that year; the Bears
had only two ties to mar their
record. To the winner would go
the Pacific Coast Conference ti
tle and the Rose Bowl bid.
Early Lead
Stanford got off to an early
6 0 lead on a pair of field goals
by halfback Murray Cuddebaek,
but it didn't last long. Califor
nia took over with three touch*
downs, rolling up a 20-6 lead by
the end of the third period.
With five minutes to play,
Stanford picked up what looked
to bo only a token score as Ed
Walker passed to end Ted Ship
key. Cuddcback's conversion
made it 20-13.
But moments later Stanford
had the ball again, and Cudde
baek was on the receiving end of

another Walker pitch and it was
20-19. And then Cuddebaek calm
ly booted the extra point that
tied the score at 20-20 and gave
the Indians what some think is
the greatest comeback in their
history.
Turnabout
Stanford was the victim of a
comeback in 1917. The Indians
of Marehie Schwartz hadn't won
a game all season—even Idaho
had beaten them. Cal, on the
other hand, was Rose Bowl
bound, with just a single loss on
its record. By game time the
Market Street operators in San
Francisco were quoting 10-1 and
40-point odds.
