(Editor's note: The Daily wishes to express its thanks to Arthur
H. Barnhisel, center on Stanford's first Bin Game team and now a
resident of Taeoma, Wash., for his detailed account of the 1892 Biff
Game and surrounding color.)
The scene: Haight Street Park, San Francisco. The date: Marcl
19, 1892. The situation: Stanford and California ready to meet in thi
first Big Game.
But something was peculiar. Here was Stanford, an upstart schou
down in the country, less than a year old, facing the old, establishei

university from Berkeley. How
had the Cardinals even gotten a
team together?
Soon after Stanford's opening
in the fall of 1891, a general call
had gone out asking all who were
willing and able to report for foot
ball practice.
Starting Center
One of those who reporter! was
Arthur H. Barnhisel, destined to
be starting center for the Cardi
nals. The following is his account
of the first Big Game and events
leading up to it, as he remembers
them now, 66 years after they
happened.
"We had a piece of the Farm
assigned for practice with a
makeshift grandstand for visiting
relatives and other spectators. I
remember the screams of moth

from the bottom of a scrimmage
pile either dead or ready for a
hospital. In fact that was about
the safest place to hide.
"Gradually a bit of order devel
oped with enough material for
two teams, mostly those who
were dependable for practice.
During the winter we made or re
ceived challenges from various
nearby high school or academy
outfits.
The Secret
"Among such schools Belmont
Academy gave us valuable compe
tition. We also had the good for
tune to find one Belmont man
with football experience. We
made a deal for his help as out
first coach. I have forgotten his
name | Stanford records show no
official head coach | but he devel
oped two plays which are said to
have won the Big Game.
"During all these months of
pre Ii m inary practice we
dreamed of the time when the
blood feud with Berkeley would
be fought out sooner or later on
some open field and we had to
win that game."
Barnhisel and the rest of the
Stanford team didn't have to wait,
long for their dream to come true.
Arrangements were made, and
soon the scene, time and situation
described were reality.
Barnhisel continues:
"It is common knowledge that
when the game was ready to go
