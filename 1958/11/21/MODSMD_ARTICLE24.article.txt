(Editor's note: The Daily wishes to express its thanks to Arthur
H. Barnhisel, center on Stanford's first Bin Game team and now a
resident of Taeoma, Wash., for his detailed account of the 1892 Biff
Game and surrounding color.)
The scene: Haight Street Park, San Francisco. The date: Marcl
19, 1892. The situation: Stanford and California ready to meet in thi
first Big Game.
But something was peculiar. Here was Stanford, an upstart schou
down in the country, less than a year old, facing the old, establishei

university from Berkeley. How
had the Cardinals even gotten a
team together?
Soon after Stanford's opening
in the fall of 1891, a general call
had gone out asking all who were
willing and able to report for foot
ball practice.
Starting Center
One of those who reporter! was
Arthur H. Barnhisel, destined to
be starting center for the Cardi
nals. The following is his account
of the first Big Game and events
leading up to it, as he remembers
them now, 66 years after they
happened.
"We had a piece of the Farm
assigned for practice with a
makeshift grandstand for visiting
relatives and other spectators. I
remember the screams of moth
ers, sisters and sweethearts look
ing to see some favorite come out
from the bottom of a scrimmage
pile either dead or ready for a
hospital. In fact that was about
the safest place to hide.
"Gradually a bit of order devel
oped with enough material for
two teams, mostly those who
were dependable for practice.
During the winter we made or re
ceived challenges from various
nearby high school or academy
outfits.
The Secret
"Among such schools Belmont
Academy gave us valuable compe
tition. We also had the good for
tune to find one Belmont man
with football experience. We
made a deal for his help as out
first coach. I have forgotten his
name | Stanford records show no
official head coach | but he devel
oped two plays which are said to
have won the Big Game.
"During all these months of
pre Ii m inary practice we
dreamed of the time when the
blood feud with Berkeley would
be fought out sooner or later on
some open field and we had to
win that game."
Barnhisel and the rest of the
Stanford team didn't have to wait,
long for their dream to come true.
Arrangements were made, and
soon the scene, time and situation
described were reality.
Barnhisel continues:
"It is common knowledge that
when the game was ready to go
nobody had thought to bring a
football. Time spent in combing
the town to find one added to the
tenseness and suspense. Cheer
leaders, college yells and bands
worked overtime. |The game,
scheduled to start at 3 p.m., final
ly began at 4:15 after the Cal
manager- purchased a ball in
downtown San Francisco. |
Little Padding
"Teams came out of their quar
ters in order with turtle - neck
sweaters but otherwise meager
padding on exposed parts. Mod
ern overstuffed build-up was not
yet heard of. Both teams exhib
ited themselves as r'aring to go;
toss-up for kick-off was settled
and the game was on.
"Berkeley team called them
selve "Baby Elephants" but their
average weight as I remember
was six or eight pounds per man
greater than Stanford. |The
Cards averaged 170 pounds, with
guard C. C. Adams the heaviest,
at 192.|
"As I remember, Berkeley had
the kick-off. Then Stanford, in
possession of the ball, unfolded
one of her 'trick plays.' One of
the plays was known as the 'doub
le cross.' It was considered very
subtle.
Trick Play
"It probably was not even new,
but the team had practiced to the
point of deadly co-ordination. The
play consisted in pass from quar
terback to right or left half, who
started with the ball concealed
under arm as much as possible,
beating it in his direction, meet
ing the other end man snatching
the ball, and heading in the oppo
site direction.
"The training and the timing
"ic speed put it over for a

substantial gain over and over
again. Just as simple as that.
When the first 30-minute half was
over the score was 14-0 in favor
of Stanford.
"Those Baby Elephants just
simply couldn't figure out what
had happened.
"Flying Wedge"
"The other 'trick play' was
known as the 'flying wedge.' It
was not spectacular it really did
n't fly but it was a concentrated
mass movement to gain even a
yard or- two to make a first down.
"In this flying wedge the line
men locked aims to make a seven
man V. Quarterback was back
of center. Pur pose was to break a
hole in the line where one of the
back could get through or actu
ally leap over for a sure gain.
"There were times, especially
at the beginning, where a break
through opened for a spectacular
gain."
The Cards rolled to Ihe 14-0
lead of which Barnhisel writes on
a pair of touchdowns by left half
back C. L. Clemans and a third
by captain and fullback J. R.
Whittemore (scoring was differ
ent in those days).
The next day's San Francisco
Examiner called Clemans' first
run "as pretty a touchdown as
was ever made on any field."
But Clemans' second dash was
equally spectacular, covering 45
yards. "The Games of California
and Stanford," a 1900 publication,
called it the longest run resulting
in a touchdown ever made in
any of the Western intercolle
giate games.
Touchdown No. 3
Whittemore's touchdown came
as he hurdled the California cen
ter. then sped along the south
side lines to the end zone.
Barnhisel goes on to say:

"After the usual intermission
the second hall' hour of play was
called. The two trick plays that
had so far won through practice
and quick timing were too simple
to fool a smart team through a
whole game, and the California
team was plenty smart.
"In addition to having spent the
intermission in figuring out what
had happened and getting better
ready for it, the extra weight of
these Baby Elephants began to
tell. They simply laid down en
masse, blocked our flying wedge,
got the ball on a fumble or other
wise and the tide began to run.
Cal Woke Up
"In that second half Berkeley
began to score. First a touch
down, then a goal and that made
seven. For the rest of that half
it was a steady grind and not too
much gain. Berkeley somehow
made three extra points and that
made ten. Never could a half
hour seem so long.
"There were no fatalities. I do
not remember any serious inju
ries but the time out for the
water bucket man made the game
drag on.
"There never was a sweeter
sound for Stanford than the blow
of the whistle that ended the Big
Game, the score 34-10 in favor of

Stanford.
"The reaction with Stanford
was a riot.

"Stanford was no longer a
'Bunch of Farmers.'
"The feud was satisfied."

"During all these months of
pre Ii m inary practice we
dreamed of the time when the
blood feud with Berkeley would
be fought out sooner or later on
some open field and we had to
win that game."
Barnhisel and the rest of the
Stanford team didn't have to wait,
long for their dream to come true.
Arrangements were made, and
soon the scene, time and situation
described were reality.
Barnhisel continues:
"It is common knowledge that
when the game was ready to go
nobody had thought to bring a
football. Time spent in combing
the town to find one added to the
tenseness and suspense. Cheer
leaders, college yells and bands
worked overtime. |The game,
scheduled to start at 3 p.m., final
ly began at 4:15 after the Cal
manager- purchased a ball in
downtown San Francisco. |
Little Padding
"Teams came out of their quar
ters in order with turtle - neck
sweaters but otherwise meager
padding on exposed parts. Mod
ern overstuffed build-up was not
yet heard of. Both teams exhib
ited themselves as r'aring to go;
toss-up for kick-off was settled
and the game was on.
"Berkeley team called them
selve "Baby Elephants" but their
average weight as I remember
was six or eight pounds per man
greater than Stanford. |The
Cards averaged 170 pounds, with
guard C. C. Adams the heaviest,
at 192.|
"As I remember, Berkeley had
the kick-off. Then Stanford, in
possession of the ball, unfolded
one of her 'trick plays.' One of
the plays was known as the 'doub
le cross.' It was considered very
subtle.
Trick Play
"It probably was not even new,
but the team had practiced to the
point of deadly co-ordination. The
play consisted in pass from quar
terback to right or left half, who
started with the ball concealed
under arm as much as possible,
beating it in his direction, meet
ing the other end man snatching
the ball, and heading in the oppo
site direction.
"The training and the timing
"ic speed put it over for a

substantial gain over and over
again. Just as simple as that.
When the first 30-minute half was
over the score was 14-0 in favor
of Stanford.
"Those Baby Elephants just
simply couldn't figure out what
had happened.
"Flying Wedge"
"The other 'trick play' was
known as the 'flying wedge.' It
was not spectacular it really did
n't fly but it was a concentrated
mass movement to gain even a
yard or- two to make a first down.
"In this flying wedge the line
men locked aims to make a seven
man V. Quarterback was back
of center. Pur pose was to break a
hole in the line where one of the
back could get through or actu
ally leap over for a sure gain.
"There were times, especially
at the beginning, where a break
through opened for a spectacular
gain."
The Cards rolled to Ihe 14-0
lead of which Barnhisel writes on
a pair of touchdowns by left half
back C. L. Clemans and a third
by captain and fullback J. R.
Whittemore (scoring was differ
ent in those days).
The next day's San Francisco
Examiner called Clemans' first
run "as pretty a touchdown as
was ever made on any field."
But Clemans' second dash was
equally spectacular, covering 45
yards. "The Games of California
and Stanford," a 1900 publication,
called it the longest run resulting
in a touchdown ever made in
any of the Western intercolle
giate games.
Touchdown No. 3
Whittemore's touchdown came
as he hurdled the California cen
ter. then sped along the south
side lines to the end zone.
Barnhisel goes on to say:

"After the usual intermission
the second hall' hour of play was
called. The two trick plays that
had so far won through practice
and quick timing were too simple
to fool a smart team through a
whole game, and the California
team was plenty smart.
"In addition to having spent the
intermission in figuring out what
had happened and getting better
ready for it, the extra weight of
these Baby Elephants began to
tell. They simply laid down en
masse, blocked our flying wedge,
got the ball on a fumble or other
wise and the tide began to run.
Cal Woke Up
"In that second half Berkeley
began to score. First a touch
down, then a goal and that made
seven. For the rest of that half
it was a steady grind and not too
much gain. Berkeley somehow
made three extra points and that
made ten. Never could a half
hour seem so long.
"There were no fatalities. I do
not remember any serious inju
ries but the time out for the
water bucket man made the game
drag on.
"There never was a sweeter
sound for Stanford than the blow
of the whistle that ended the Big
Game, the score 34-10 in favor of

Stanford.
"The reaction with Stanford
was a riot.

"Stanford was no longer a
'Bunch of Farmers.'
"The feud was satisfied."

H. Barnhisel, center on Stanford's first Bin Game team and now a
resident of Taeoma, Wash., for his detailed account of the 1892 Biff
Game and surrounding color.)
The scene: Haight Street Park, San Francisco. The date: Marcl
19, 1892. The situation: Stanford and California ready to meet in thi
first Big Game.
But something was peculiar. Here was Stanford, an upstart schou
down in the country, less than a year old, facing the old, establishei

university from Berkeley. How
had the Cardinals even gotten a
team together?
Soon after Stanford's opening
in the fall of 1891, a general call
had gone out asking all who were
willing and able to report for foot
ball practice.
Starting Center
One of those who reporter! was
Arthur H. Barnhisel, destined to
be starting center for the Cardi
nals. The following is his account
of the first Big Game and events
leading up to it, as he remembers
them now, 66 years after they
happened.
"We had a piece of the Farm
assigned for practice with a
makeshift grandstand for visiting
relatives and other spectators. I
remember the screams of moth
ers, sisters and sweethearts look
ing to see some favorite come out
from the bottom of a scrimmage
pile either dead or ready for a
hospital. In fact that was about
the safest place to hide.
"Gradually a bit of order devel
oped with enough material for
two teams, mostly those who
were dependable for practice.
During the winter we made or re
ceived challenges from various
nearby high school or academy
outfits.
The Secret
"Among such schools Belmont
Academy gave us valuable compe
tition. We also had the good for
tune to find one Belmont man
with football experience. We
made a deal for his help as out
first coach. I have forgotten his
name | Stanford records show no
official head coach | but he devel
oped two plays which are said to
have won the Big Game.

"The training and the timing
"ic speed put it over for a

substantial gain over and over
again. Just as simple as that.
When the first 30-minute half was
over the score was 14-0 in favor
of Stanford.
"Those Baby Elephants just
simply couldn't figure out what
had happened.
"Flying Wedge"
"The other 'trick play' was
known as the 'flying wedge.' It
was not spectacular it really did
n't fly but it was a concentrated
mass movement to gain even a
yard or- two to make a first down.
"In this flying wedge the line
men locked aims to make a seven
man V. Quarterback was back
of center. Pur pose was to break a
hole in the line where one of the
back could get through or actu
ally leap over for a sure gain.
"There were times, especially
at the beginning, where a break
through opened for a spectacular
gain."
The Cards rolled to Ihe 14-0
lead of which Barnhisel writes on
a pair of touchdowns by left half
back C. L. Clemans and a third
by captain and fullback J. R.
Whittemore (scoring was differ
ent in those days).
The next day's San Francisco
Examiner called Clemans' first
run "as pretty a touchdown as
was ever made on any field."
But Clemans' second dash was
equally spectacular, covering 45
yards. "The Games of California
and Stanford," a 1900 publication,
called it the longest run resulting
in a touchdown ever made in
any of the Western intercolle
giate games.
Touchdown No. 3
Whittemore's touchdown came
as he hurdled the California cen
ter. then sped along the south
side lines to the end zone.
Barnhisel goes on to say:

"After the usual intermission
the second hall' hour of play was
called. The two trick plays that
had so far won through practice
and quick timing were too simple
to fool a smart team through a
whole game, and the California
team was plenty smart.
"In addition to having spent the
intermission in figuring out what
had happened and getting better
ready for it, the extra weight of
these Baby Elephants began to
tell. They simply laid down en
masse, blocked our flying wedge,
got the ball on a fumble or other
wise and the tide began to run.
Cal Woke Up
"In that second half Berkeley
began to score. First a touch
down, then a goal and that made
seven. For the rest of that half
it was a steady grind and not too
much gain. Berkeley somehow
made three extra points and that
made ten. Never could a half
hour seem so long.
"There were no fatalities. I do
not remember any serious inju
ries but the time out for the
water bucket man made the game
drag on.
"There never was a sweeter
sound for Stanford than the blow
of the whistle that ended the Big
Game, the score 34-10 in favor of

Stanford.
"The reaction with Stanford
was a riot.

"Stanford was no longer a
'Bunch of Farmers.'
"The feud was satisfied."
(Editor's note: The Daily wishes to express its thanks to Arthur
H. Barnhisel, center on Stanford's first Bin Game team and now a
resident of Taeoma, Wash., for his detailed account of the 1892 Biff
Game and surrounding color.)
The scene: Haight Street Park, San Francisco. The date: Marcl
19, 1892. The situation: Stanford and California ready to meet in thi
first Big Game.
But something was peculiar. Here was Stanford, an upstart schou
down in the country, less than a year old, facing the old, establishei

university from Berkeley. How
had the Cardinals even gotten a
team together?
Soon after Stanford's opening
in the fall of 1891, a general call
had gone out asking all who were
willing and able to report for foot
ball practice.
Starting Center
One of those who reporter! was
Arthur H. Barnhisel, destined to
be starting center for the Cardi
nals. The following is his account
of the first Big Game and events
leading up to it, as he remembers
them now, 66 years after they
happened.
"We had a piece of the Farm
assigned for practice with a
makeshift grandstand for visiting
relatives and other spectators. I
remember the screams of moth
ers, sisters and sweethearts look
ing to see some favorite come out
from the bottom of a scrimmage
pile either dead or ready for a
hospital. In fact that was about
the safest place to hide.
"Gradually a bit of order devel
oped with enough material for
two teams, mostly those who
were dependable for practice.
During the winter we made or re
ceived challenges from various
nearby high school or academy
outfits.
The Secret
"Among such schools Belmont
Academy gave us valuable compe
tition. We also had the good for
tune to find one Belmont man
with football experience. We
made a deal for his help as out
first coach. I have forgotten his
name | Stanford records show no
official head coach | but he devel
oped two plays which are said to
have won the Big Game.
"During all these months of
pre Ii m inary practice we
dreamed of the time when the
blood feud with Berkeley would
be fought out sooner or later on
some open field and we had to
win that game."
Barnhisel and the rest of the
Stanford team didn't have to wait,
long for their dream to come true.
Arrangements were made, and
soon the scene, time and situation
described were reality.
Barnhisel continues:
"It is common knowledge that
when the game was ready to go
nobody had thought to bring a
football. Time spent in combing
the town to find one added to the
tenseness and suspense. Cheer
leaders, college yells and bands
worked overtime. |The game,
scheduled to start at 3 p.m., final
ly began at 4:15 after the Cal
manager- purchased a ball in
downtown San Francisco. |
Little Padding
"Teams came out of their quar
ters in order with turtle - neck
sweaters but otherwise meager
padding on exposed parts. Mod
ern overstuffed build-up was not
yet heard of. Both teams exhib
ited themselves as r'aring to go;
toss-up for kick-off was settled
and the game was on.
"Berkeley team called them
selve "Baby Elephants" but their
average weight as I remember
was six or eight pounds per man
greater than Stanford. |The
Cards averaged 170 pounds, with
guard C. C. Adams the heaviest,
at 192.|
"As I remember, Berkeley had
the kick-off. Then Stanford, in
possession of the ball, unfolded
one of her 'trick plays.' One of
the plays was known as the 'doub
le cross.' It was considered very
subtle.
Trick Play
"It probably was not even new,
but the team had practiced to the
point of deadly co-ordination. The
play consisted in pass from quar
terback to right or left half, who
started with the ball concealed
under arm as much as possible,
beating it in his direction, meet
ing the other end man snatching
the ball, and heading in the oppo
site direction.
"The training and the timing
"ic speed put it over for a

(Editor's note: The Daily wishes to express its thanks to Arthur
H. Barnhisel, center on Stanford's first Bin Game team and now a
resident of Taeoma, Wash., for his detailed account of the 1892 Biff
Game and surrounding color.)
The scene: Haight Street Park, San Francisco. The date: Marcl
19, 1892. The situation: Stanford and California ready to meet in thi
first Big Game.
But something was peculiar. Here was Stanford, an upstart schou
down in the country, less than a year old, facing the old, establishei

university from Berkeley. How
had the Cardinals even gotten a
team together?
Soon after Stanford's opening
in the fall of 1891, a general call
had gone out asking all who were
willing and able to report for foot
ball practice.
Starting Center
One of those who reporter! was
Arthur H. Barnhisel, destined to
be starting center for the Cardi
nals. The following is his account
of the first Big Game and events
leading up to it, as he remembers
them now, 66 years after they
happened.
"We had a piece of the Farm
assigned for practice with a
makeshift grandstand for visiting
relatives and other spectators. I
remember the screams of moth
ers, sisters and sweethearts look
ing to see some favorite come out
from the bottom of a scrimmage
pile either dead or ready for a
hospital. In fact that was about
the safest place to hide.
"Gradually a bit of order devel
oped with enough material for
two teams, mostly those who
were dependable for practice.
During the winter we made or re
ceived challenges from various
nearby high school or academy
outfits.
The Secret
"Among such schools Belmont
Academy gave us valuable compe
tition. We also had the good for
tune to find one Belmont man
with football experience. We
made a deal for his help as out
first coach. I have forgotten his
name | Stanford records show no
official head coach | but he devel
oped two plays which are said to
have won the Big Game.
"During all these months of
pre Ii m inary practice we
dreamed of the time when the
blood feud with Berkeley would
be fought out sooner or later on
some open field and we had to
win that game."
Barnhisel and the rest of the
Stanford team didn't have to wait,
long for their dream to come true.
Arrangements were made, and
soon the scene, time and situation
described were reality.
Barnhisel continues:
"It is common knowledge that
when the game was ready to go
nobody had thought to bring a
football. Time spent in combing
the town to find one added to the
tenseness and suspense. Cheer
leaders, college yells and bands
worked overtime. |The game,
scheduled to start at 3 p.m., final
ly began at 4:15 after the Cal
manager- purchased a ball in
downtown San Francisco. |
Little Padding
"Teams came out of their quar
ters in order with turtle - neck
sweaters but otherwise meager
padding on exposed parts. Mod
ern overstuffed build-up was not
yet heard of. Both teams exhib
ited themselves as r'aring to go;
toss-up for kick-off was settled
and the game was on.
"Berkeley team called them
selve "Baby Elephants" but their
average weight as I remember
was six or eight pounds per man
greater than Stanford. |The
Cards averaged 170 pounds, with
guard C. C. Adams the heaviest,
at 192.|
"As I remember, Berkeley had
the kick-off. Then Stanford, in
possession of the ball, unfolded
one of her 'trick plays.' One of
the plays was known as the 'doub
le cross.' It was considered very
subtle.
Trick Play
"It probably was not even new,
but the team had practiced to the
point of deadly co-ordination. The
play consisted in pass from quar
terback to right or left half, who
started with the ball concealed
under arm as much as possible,
beating it in his direction, meet
ing the other end man snatching
the ball, and heading in the oppo
site direction.
"The training and the timing
"ic speed put it over for a

substantial gain over and over
again. Just as simple as that.
When the first 30-minute half was
over the score was 14-0 in favor
of Stanford.
"Those Baby Elephants just
simply couldn't figure out what
had happened.
"Flying Wedge"
"The other 'trick play' was
known as the 'flying wedge.' It
was not spectacular it really did
n't fly but it was a concentrated
mass movement to gain even a
yard or- two to make a first down.
"In this flying wedge the line
men locked aims to make a seven
man V. Quarterback was back
of center. Pur pose was to break a
hole in the line where one of the
back could get through or actu
ally leap over for a sure gain.
"There were times, especially
at the beginning, where a break
through opened for a spectacular
gain."
The Cards rolled to Ihe 14-0
lead of which Barnhisel writes on
a pair of touchdowns by left half
back C. L. Clemans and a third
by captain and fullback J. R.
Whittemore (scoring was differ
ent in those days).
The next day's San Francisco
Examiner called Clemans' first
run "as pretty a touchdown as
was ever made on any field."
But Clemans' second dash was
equally spectacular, covering 45
yards. "The Games of California
and Stanford," a 1900 publication,
called it the longest run resulting
in a touchdown ever made in
any of the Western intercolle
giate games.
Touchdown No. 3
Whittemore's touchdown came
as he hurdled the California cen
ter. then sped along the south
side lines to the end zone.
Barnhisel goes on to say:

"After the usual intermission
the second hall' hour of play was
called. The two trick plays that
had so far won through practice
and quick timing were too simple
to fool a smart team through a
whole game, and the California
team was plenty smart.
"In addition to having spent the
intermission in figuring out what
had happened and getting better
ready for it, the extra weight of
these Baby Elephants began to
tell. They simply laid down en
masse, blocked our flying wedge,
