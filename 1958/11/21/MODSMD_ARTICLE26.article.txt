# Hoover Reminisces

### 
Contrary to popular rumor,
Herbert Hoover didn't organize
the first Big Game. In fact, lie
didn't even see it; his job was
handling ticket sales. In a let
ter especially sent for The
Daily's 19. r >B Big Game edition,
the former President says:
"We had seats for a total of
15,000 fans. We bought, new
uniforms for our teams from a
dealer on the sales expecta
tions. We printed seat • num
bered tickets for only 10,000 as
we did not expect more visitors
than that number. When the
game came on, two things hap
pened to disturb the managers.
"First, the attendance piled
up to nearly 20,000. |Since] we
had no such supply of tickets,
we set up an alley of our col
lege boys from the box offices
to the gates and sold tickets for
cash — the purchasers being
carefully watched s-o that no
outsiders crowded in without
having first paid their respects
to the box offices.
"At that time, few bills were
in use in California. We dealt
in silver and gold.
"And while these difficulties
were being solved, the captains
of the two teams turned up, de
manding to know where was
the football. We had overlooked
that detail and had to delay the
game . . . while we sent down
town for the two pigs-kins.
"I did not see the game, but
to our astonishment, we won.
After the game, the California
manager and I retired to a ho
tel with our money, now trans
ferred to grain bags, and sat up
most of the night counting it.
I had never seen $30,000 before.
The hank the next morning
found that we had $18 more."
