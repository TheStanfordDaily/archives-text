# '92's Secret Weapon
## 
### 
The Stanford football team of
'92 was a hearty lot, playing
through the entire first Big Game
without a substitution. The Rev.
Ellsworth L. Rich, left tackle on
the club, gave a clue about how
the Cards got in this kind of
shape when he wrote in the 1947
Daily Big Game issue:
"We needed more resistance;
hence, usually 14 or 15 men |were
used] for greater opposition in
practice play."
