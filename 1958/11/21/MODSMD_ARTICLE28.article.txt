# The 						Axe: 59 Year History
## It All Began At an 1899 Ball Game 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
On April 15, 1899, only two days
after it had been born, the Stan
ford Axe was stolen by Cal men.
touching off a 59-year series of
amazing thefts and disappear
ances that has persisted until
today.
Stanford was out for revenge
in the 1899 season, having lost
both the football and baseball
contests to the Bears across the
Bay. But facing a three - game
series of baseball games with Cal
without their star player, the spir
it of the '99 Stanford team was
sagging.
To bolster morale, a mammoth
rally and bonfire were planned
for the center-field area of the
baseball diamond.
Up to this time an axe had
been used only symbolically in
the Axe Yell, written in 1896 by
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley, who
had organized the yell for campus
rallies. Then yell leader Billy Erb
got an inspiration:
10 Pounds, 15 Inches
A 24-inch, 10-pound lumber
man's broadaxe with a tomahawk
shaped 15-inch blade was imported
from San Francisco by Erb and
"Bug" Haslacker and given a coat
of bright red paint before the
rally. A red block "S" was paint
ed on the blade, and the Axe was
ready for its first appearance.
Beside the bonfire that night a
very proper and literary recital
was given by Frank English, '01.
concerning the present dullness of
the Axe, the reason for the year's
defeats. He then proposed sharp
ening the blade to insure victory
at the game the next day in San
Francisco at the 16th and Folsom
Streets grounds.
Used for Beheading
Wild cheers arose when Erb ap
peared with the Axe and gave it a
keen 8-inch-long cutting edge on
a grindstone turned by English.
To test the blade's sharpness, a
Cal "sympathizer" was found in
the crowd and brought forward—
a straw dummy dressed in Blue
and Gold — and beheaded on a
chopping block in front of the
bonfire.

The remains were then tossed
onto the burning pile, and the Axt
was turned over to Captain Long
heed, who made a short speech of
acceptance. Then, in true Indian
style, the students streamed for
ward, dancing around the bonfire
to the chant of "Give 'Em the
Axe!"
The baseball team was brought
in and pulled around the fire in a
wagon.
At t he game the Axe chopped
up ribbons of Blue and Gold, bu'
must have lost its edge in the
process, as the gilded Bears won
again, 9-7. But more important
was tiie disappearance of the Axe
immediately following the game.
The Enemy!
Its four guardians, including
Carl Hayden and football tackle
Tom McFadden, tried to sneak the
unsuccessful mascot out of the
park, but suddenly found them
selves surrounded by the enemy
in large force. Cal men, grabbing
their waists, formed four radiat
ing lines and pulled until their
grip on the Axe was broken.
Paul Ca-stlehun, Cal football
player, snatched the Axe and
sprinted for the gate, tossing the
prize back and forth to other Cal
men. At Howard Street the Axe
was passed to another' Cal man,
Bill Drum; he handed it to a run
nel' beside him who suddenly
broke away from the mob.
This brave soul was Frank
Strout, Stanford hurdler, who had
been mistaken for a Cal man.
Pursued by the Bears, he was
quickly brought down with a fly
ing tackle by Jim Hopper, Cal
"wonder quarterback."
Handle Taken Off
Berkeley took no more chances.
Via horse-drawn delivery wagon
and streetcar, the Axe was car
ried to a Chinatown butcher shop,
where part of the long handle
was chopped off. Then it was
whisked to the Ferry Building,
where police and Stanford men
were frisking all passengers.
Cal's Cliff Miller was elected to
smuggle the trophy aboard. He
quickly took the arm of the first
girl he saw waiting for transpor
tat ion acr oss the Bay, and be
tween them somehow (popular'
rumor has it that the coed hid it
up her skirt, but it is more likely
that Miller had il under his over
coat i managed to smuggle the
Axe on board with o u t being
searched.
In i'ants Leg
Another Cal man limped aboard
with the Axe's handle hidden in a
trouser leg.
Not giving up yet. several Stan
ford students crossed the Bay the
next Monday and found a spon
taneous r a I 1 y going on at the
Berkeley campus. In the middle
of it rode a man on horseback—
Harry Dutton, another brave In
d i a n. He graciously suggested
that they turn the Axe over to
him -so the crowd coujd get a bet
ter- view of the prize.
Again Stanford had the Axe in
hand. But the horse shied, and
the Cal men refused to let go of
the bridle—though still not sus
pecting Dutton. Coming to a nar
row path through which the horse
could not pass, Dutton was com
pelled to give the Axe to the in
sistent students.
But stalwart Dutton had still
another idea. Disguising himself
by gumming a false mustache on

his upper lip, he approached the
Jhi Phi house, where the Axe had
been taken. He banged on the door
ind presented the following note:
"Send by this fellow (a tall
man),' the axe to nie this after
noon, for I want to number it
and fix the handle. This fellow
is a painter. A 1 Lean."
Just as the Chi Phi's were about
to do what the note said, the gum
holding Dutton's mustache lost its
adhesive powers. He was exposed
ind barely escaped with his life
from the enraged Cal men.
A few days later a larger group
from The Farm, led by Billy Erb,
descended on the Chi Phi house
with crowbars and hammers, de
termined to find the Axe.
Charlie Pi ingle, Cal's football
captain, grabbed an army sword
from a wall and dashed to the
head of the stairs shouting, "I'll
kill the first man who starts up
these stairs!" But a speeding
flower vase broke his composure,
and the Stanford men rushed in.
Although searching every possi
ble hiding place except a strong
box, containing fraternity secrets
which nine prostrate Chi Phi's
swore did not hold the Axe. the
group finally had to give up and
leave.
The hiding place remained un
known for a long time, hut three
guesses were ventured: the Axe
had been placed behind the panel
ing of a sliding door; the Chi Phi
pledges had lied; or it was already

in a bank safe depor.it vault. How
ever', the Daily Cal reported later
that the Axe had been hidden in
the Chi Phi piano the only piece
of fur niture that had remained in
tact during the raid.
In retaliation, on Apr il 24, 1899,
Will Irwin organized a group of
Stanford men and succeeded in
stealing the Cal Senior Fence.
There was wild joy when they
returned to the campus; classes

were called off, and it was felt
that at least the Axe had been
avenged. But the Bears assumed
a bored attitude, saying that they
wanted to get rid of the old fence
for year's, thanking Stanford for
performing the task.
By then the rivalry had reached
such a high point that Stanford's
President David Starr Jordan is
sued the immortal statement, "Let
no old axe cut off our sense of

dignity and self-respect."
But by that time the Axe hail
become dear to the hearts of all
Stanford students, and plans were
continually being made to regain
ii though it wasn't until 31 years
later that a plan finally material
ized and succeeded under the ef
forts of a group of clever and dar
ing students who, through their
recovery of the Axe, became
known as "The Immortal 21."
