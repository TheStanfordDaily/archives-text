# The
						Axe: 59 Year History
## It All Began At an 1899 Ball Game 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
On April 15, 1899, only two days
after it had been born, the Stan
ford Axe was stolen by Cal men.
touching off a 59-year series of
amazing thefts and disappear
ances that has persisted until
today.
Stanford was out for revenge
in the 1899 season, having lost
both the football and baseball
contests to the Bears across the
Bay. But facing a three - game
series of baseball games with Cal
without their star player, the spir
it of the '99 Stanford team was
sagging.
To bolster morale, a mammoth
rally and bonfire were planned
for the center-field area of the
baseball diamond.
Up to this time an axe had
been used only symbolically in
the Axe Yell, written in 1896 by
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley, who
had organized the yell for campus
rallies. Then yell leader Billy Erb
got an inspiration:
10 Pounds, 15 Inches
A 24-inch, 10-pound lumber
man's broadaxe with a tomahawk
shaped 15-inch blade was imported
from San Francisco by Erb and
"Bug" Haslacker and given a coat
of bright red paint before the
rally. A red block "S" was paint
ed on the blade, and the Axe was
ready for its first appearance.
Beside the bonfire that night a
very proper and literary recital
was given by Frank English, '01.
concerning the present dullness of
the Axe, the reason for the year's
defeats. He then proposed sharp
ening the blade to insure victory
at the game the next day in San
Francisco at the 16th and Folsom
Streets grounds.
Used for Beheading
Wild cheers arose when Erb ap
peared with the Axe and gave it a
keen 8-inch-long cutting edge on
a grindstone turned by English.
To test the blade's sharpness, a
Cal "sympathizer" was found in
the crowd and brought forward—
a straw dummy dressed in Blue
and Gold — and beheaded on a
chopping block in front of the
bonfire.
