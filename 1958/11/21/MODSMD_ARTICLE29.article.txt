# Axe Trophy in 1933; Travels Become Legal
## 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
After the successful recovery
of the Stanford Axe by "The Im
mortal 21" on April 3, 1930, the
Axe stayed on home ground for
three years. Its adventures did
not end then, however.
Proposals arose to make the
Axe a Big Game trophy, and stu
dents and alumni discussed the
pros and cons again and again.
In 1933 Cal and Stanford agreed
to use the Axe as a Big Game
trophy.
That year the Axe disappeared
from The Farm, but was returned
after negotiations with Cal and a
pledge signed by both student
body presidents that anyone at
tempting to steal the Axe from
the school legally holding it at the
time would be under penalty of
suspension from either university.
Caught in the Axe
But on Nov. 16, 1945, two Cal
students were caught after hav
ing forced their way into The Cel
lar, where the Axe was on display.
At 4 p.m. a policeman, noticing
a broken window, entered The Cel
lar and saw the two men huddled
behind the candy counter. After
confessing they were stealing the
Axe "to promote school spirit at
Cal," they were confined in the
Palo Alto jail for a few days and
the case was then dismissed.
However, on April 28, 1946, four
Cal men succeeded in walking out
of The Cellar with the Axe—case
and all. A rumor had it that the
Indians were planning to steal the
Cal cyclotron in retaliation.
Anonymous Call
Then, on Oct. 10 of the same
year, Palo Alto police investigated
an anonymous phone call telling
them the Axe was in the back seat
of a police prowl car outside the
station. It was found just in time
for its presentation to Stanford
by Governor Earl Warren in the
Big Game.
The Axe was next kept in en
forced retirement at the police
station until a new case could be
made. This case, 68 by 24 inches,
weighed 950 pounds, cost $700 and
was covered by unbreakable dou
ble-plate glass.
In 1947, after having been lost
lost legally to Cal, it mysteriously

disappeared from Cal's Stephens
Union, to be found later leaning
against a tree —plaque and all—
near the Stanford golf course,
where it had been abandoned.
In Faculty Glade
It again disappeared from the
Cal Union on June 9. 1953. Though
Stanford was suspected of har
boring the missing Axe, no more
was heard about its whereabouts
until an axe turned up suddenly
on Nov. 16, found in the UC Fac
ulty Glade, a short distance from
the ASUC office.
Although proclaimed by all that

day as the missing Axe returned,
it was soon discovered that this
axe was merely a good imitation
of the original. Made by the fa
ther of a Cal coed who owned an
Oakland machine s ho p, it had
been planned as a scheme to
smoke out the real Axe at the
Big Game that year.
Ralph Vetterlein, Cal student
body president, and John Kirbey-
Moller, head of the UC "Axe-Find
ing" Committee, revealed later
they had been aware of the plan
and had given the students the
go-ahead because they were act
ing in "good faith." However, the

cost of producing this "good
faith" symbol was between $300
and $400.
"Absolute Silence"
Plans were being made to pre
sent the empty plaque to the win
ner of the Big Game on Nov. 23,
1953, when the Axe was found in
the car of Stanford's football team
captain, Norm Manoogian, just a
few hours before game time.
Manoogian said he found the
package containing the Axe with
an anonymous note, which read:
"Regarding- the whereabouts
of the Ax«* over these months,
it will probably never be known
because of the remaining: risk
to ourselves. But the success

of tlie whole caper has centered
in the absolute silence of all
parties. . .
The note further urged Manoo
gian to "rest assured that this is
the real Stanford Axe which was
removed from the plaque last
June." "Accept no substitutes," it
concluded.
But Vetterlein expressed doubts
that it was the one originally forg
ed in 1899, having heard, he said
that the first Stanford Axe disap
peared around 1927 and had never
been recovered. Cal was in cus
tody of the Axe that year, but the
rumors have never been verified.
On June 13, 1956, the Axe again
was taken from Stanford, remov-

Ed from the supposedly bullet
proof, steal-proof case in The Cel
lar by use of a blowtorch and cold
water, after having been won by
Stanford in 1955 for the first time
in nine years.
In John's Car
This time it was found before
the SC game on Oct. 27, 1956, ly
ing on the seat of football co-cap
tain John Brodie's car in front of
the President Hotel in Palo Alto.
Attached was a note which said
simply, "From the unknown."
After the Axe was regained by
Stanford in last year's Big Game
it was placed in a vault of the
American Trust Company in Palo
Alto,

Ed from the supposedly bullet
proof, steal-proof case in The Cel
lar by use of a blowtorch and cold
water, after having been won by
Stanford in 1955 for the first time
in nine years.
In John's Car
This time it was found before
the SC game on Oct. 27, 1956, ly
ing on the seat of football co-cap
tain John Brodie's car in front of
the President Hotel in Palo Alto.
Attached was a note which said
simply, "From the unknown."
After the Axe was regained by
Stanford in last year's Big Game
it was placed in a vault of the
American Trust Company in Palo
Alto,
After the successful recovery
of the Stanford Axe by "The Im
mortal 21" on April 3, 1930, the
Axe stayed on home ground for
three years. Its adventures did
not end then, however.
Proposals arose to make the
Axe a Big Game trophy, and stu
dents and alumni discussed the
pros and cons again and again.
In 1933 Cal and Stanford agreed
to use the Axe as a Big Game
trophy.
That year the Axe disappeared
from The Farm, but was returned
after negotiations with Cal and a
pledge signed by both student
body presidents that anyone at
tempting to steal the Axe from
the school legally holding it at the
time would be under penalty of
suspension from either university.
Caught in the Axe
But on Nov. 16, 1945, two Cal
students were caught after hav
ing forced their way into The Cel
lar, where the Axe was on display.
At 4 p.m. a policeman, noticing
a broken window, entered The Cel
lar and saw the two men huddled
behind the candy counter. After
confessing they were stealing the
Axe "to promote school spirit at
Cal," they were confined in the
Palo Alto jail for a few days and
the case was then dismissed.
However, on April 28, 1946, four
Cal men succeeded in walking out
of The Cellar with the Axe—case
and all. A rumor had it that the
Indians were planning to steal the
Cal cyclotron in retaliation.
Anonymous Call
Then, on Oct. 10 of the same
year, Palo Alto police investigated
an anonymous phone call telling
them the Axe was in the back seat
of a police prowl car outside the
station. It was found just in time
for its presentation to Stanford
by Governor Earl Warren in the
Big Game.
The Axe was next kept in en
forced retirement at the police
station until a new case could be
made. This case, 68 by 24 inches,
weighed 950 pounds, cost $700 and
was covered by unbreakable dou
ble-plate glass.
In 1947, after having been lost
lost legally to Cal, it mysteriously

disappeared from Cal's Stephens
Union, to be found later leaning
against a tree —plaque and all—
near the Stanford golf course,
where it had been abandoned.
In Faculty Glade
It again disappeared from the
Cal Union on June 9. 1953. Though
Stanford was suspected of har
boring the missing Axe, no more
was heard about its whereabouts
until an axe turned up suddenly
on Nov. 16, found in the UC Fac
ulty Glade, a short distance from
the ASUC office.
Although proclaimed by all that

day as the missing Axe returned,
it was soon discovered that this
axe was merely a good imitation
of the original. Made by the fa
ther of a Cal coed who owned an
Oakland machine s ho p, it had
been planned as a scheme to
smoke out the real Axe at the
Big Game that year.
Ralph Vetterlein, Cal student
body president, and John Kirbey-
Moller, head of the UC "Axe-Find
ing" Committee, revealed later
they had been aware of the plan
and had given the students the
go-ahead because they were act
ing in "good faith." However, the

cost of producing this "good
faith" symbol was between $300
and $400.
"Absolute Silence"
Plans were being made to pre
sent the empty plaque to the win
ner of the Big Game on Nov. 23,
1953, when the Axe was found in
the car of Stanford's football team
captain, Norm Manoogian, just a
few hours before game time.
Manoogian said he found the
package containing the Axe with
an anonymous note, which read:
"Regarding- the whereabouts
of the Ax«* over these months,
it will probably never be known
because of the remaining: risk
to ourselves. But the success

of tlie whole caper has centered
in the absolute silence of all
parties. . .
The note further urged Manoo
gian to "rest assured that this is
the real Stanford Axe which was
removed from the plaque last
June." "Accept no substitutes," it
concluded.
But Vetterlein expressed doubts
that it was the one originally forg
ed in 1899, having heard, he said
that the first Stanford Axe disap
peared around 1927 and had never
been recovered. Cal was in cus
tody of the Axe that year, but the
rumors have never been verified.

of tlie whole caper has centered
in the absolute silence of all
parties. . .
The note further urged Manoo
gian to "rest assured that this is
the real Stanford Axe which was
removed from the plaque last
June." "Accept no substitutes," it
concluded.
But Vetterlein expressed doubts
that it was the one originally forg
ed in 1899, having heard, he said
that the first Stanford Axe disap
peared around 1927 and had never
been recovered. Cal was in cus
tody of the Axe that year, but the
rumors have never been verified.
On June 13, 1956, the Axe again
was taken from Stanford, remov-

Ed from the supposedly bullet
proof, steal-proof case in The Cel
lar by use of a blowtorch and cold
water, after having been won by
Stanford in 1955 for the first time
in nine years.
In John's Car
This time it was found before
the SC game on Oct. 27, 1956, ly
ing on the seat of football co-cap
tain John Brodie's car in front of
the President Hotel in Palo Alto.
Attached was a note which said
simply, "From the unknown."
After the Axe was regained by
Stanford in last year's Big Game
it was placed in a vault of the
American Trust Company in Palo
Alto,
After the successful recovery
of the Stanford Axe by "The Im
mortal 21" on April 3, 1930, the
Axe stayed on home ground for
three years. Its adventures did
not end then, however.
Proposals arose to make the
Axe a Big Game trophy, and stu
dents and alumni discussed the
pros and cons again and again.
In 1933 Cal and Stanford agreed
to use the Axe as a Big Game
trophy.
That year the Axe disappeared
from The Farm, but was returned
after negotiations with Cal and a
pledge signed by both student
body presidents that anyone at
tempting to steal the Axe from
the school legally holding it at the
time would be under penalty of
suspension from either university.
Caught in the Axe
But on Nov. 16, 1945, two Cal
students were caught after hav
ing forced their way into The Cel
lar, where the Axe was on display.
At 4 p.m. a policeman, noticing
a broken window, entered The Cel
lar and saw the two men huddled
behind the candy counter. After
confessing they were stealing the
Axe "to promote school spirit at
Cal," they were confined in the
Palo Alto jail for a few days and
the case was then dismissed.
However, on April 28, 1946, four
Cal men succeeded in walking out
of The Cellar with the Axe—case
and all. A rumor had it that the
Indians were planning to steal the
Cal cyclotron in retaliation.
Anonymous Call
Then, on Oct. 10 of the same
year, Palo Alto police investigated
an anonymous phone call telling
them the Axe was in the back seat
of a police prowl car outside the
station. It was found just in time
for its presentation to Stanford
by Governor Earl Warren in the
Big Game.
The Axe was next kept in en
forced retirement at the police
station until a new case could be
made. This case, 68 by 24 inches,
weighed 950 pounds, cost $700 and
was covered by unbreakable dou
ble-plate glass.
In 1947, after having been lost
lost legally to Cal, it mysteriously

disappeared from Cal's Stephens
Union, to be found later leaning
against a tree —plaque and all—
near the Stanford golf course,
where it had been abandoned.
In Faculty Glade
It again disappeared from the
Cal Union on June 9. 1953. Though
Stanford was suspected of har
boring the missing Axe, no more
was heard about its whereabouts
until an axe turned up suddenly
on Nov. 16, found in the UC Fac
ulty Glade, a short distance from
the ASUC office.
Although proclaimed by all that

day as the missing Axe returned,
it was soon discovered that this
axe was merely a good imitation
of the original. Made by the fa
ther of a Cal coed who owned an
Oakland machine s ho p, it had
been planned as a scheme to
smoke out the real Axe at the
Big Game that year.
Ralph Vetterlein, Cal student
body president, and John Kirbey-
Moller, head of the UC "Axe-Find
ing" Committee, revealed later
they had been aware of the plan
and had given the students the
go-ahead because they were act
ing in "good faith." However, the

cost of producing this "good
faith" symbol was between $300
and $400.
"Absolute Silence"
Plans were being made to pre
sent the empty plaque to the win
ner of the Big Game on Nov. 23,
1953, when the Axe was found in
the car of Stanford's football team
captain, Norm Manoogian, just a
few hours before game time.
Manoogian said he found the
package containing the Axe with
an anonymous note, which read:
"Regarding- the whereabouts
of the Ax«* over these months,
it will probably never be known
because of the remaining: risk
to ourselves. But the success

of tlie whole caper has centered
