# '21' Fable, Songs, Fireworks To Spark 6:30 Bonfire Rally
## 
### Cally Tanner 
The Class of '62 will add its
touches tonight, to the history of
the Big Game Bonfire Rally as
suming that no one has planted a
time bomb or some explosive
chemical in the carefully collected
debris.
The rally begins at 6:30 p.m.,
on the Boathouse Landing, upon
the arrival of the parade, which
will start from Wilbur about 6:15.
Dick Whittington, KSFO disk
jockey, will act as master of cere
monies. As special features of the
rally, the fable ol the Immortal
21 will be retold and the Men's
Glee Club will perform "Son of a
Gambolier."
A fireworks display on the lake
bottom will follow the rally.
In the early 1900's rallies began
in the Assembly Hall (now the
Business School) and went into
an all-campus serpentine through
Quad to the site of the Bonfire.
The first premature burning
took place in 1928 and was the
result of a time bomb. One writer
on The Daily accused Rally Com

of planting the bomb; and chair
man Dave Jacobsen responded
with great gusto: "Anybody who
says that is an unmitigated lair!"
Fire Rebuilt
With only 36 hours until rally
time, Jacobsen called for the feel
ing of the group in rebuilding.
There was a great, enthusiastic
cheer, and then someone asked if
they would be excused from
classes.
All went well that week end;
Oski burned right on schedule.
On Monday, however, Jacobsen
was called on the carpet to an
swer for several thousand class
cuts!
Other Attempts
Previous to this, other unsuc
cessful attempts were made in
1920 and 1922, when airplane I
bombs were dropped, and in 1923, i
when a small bla/e was discover ed
and put out easily. The structure
burned early in 1925 but was re
constructed without too much I
trouble, because of the size of the ;

class.
In 1956 there were two attempts
to light the Bonfire. The first was
unsuccessful, and Menlo College
attackers lost a truck in the at
tempt.
But the second time, when
someone planted a chemical bomb
in the collection of debris the
structure went up in flames.
Again, fast teamwork rebuilt the
edifice, and Ihe Bonfire tradition
passed once more to the succeed
ing Stanford classes.
