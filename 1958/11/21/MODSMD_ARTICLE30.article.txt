William L. Hudson, then editor of the Daily Californian, appar
ently had a bad hangover the night of the Immortal 21's recovery
of the Axe. In any case, this is what he wrote for the next morn

(Reprinted from the Daily Californian, April 4, 1930)
Stanford is likely to wake up on a different campus this morn
ing. The clever boys 1 who stole the Axe may have returned to paint
the town red, but they may find the place painted Blue and Gold
before the night is over.
Hate Stanford! Catch the euphony of that sentence, notice its
essential accuracy! Hate Stanford! Repeat it over and over in
your mind; formulate it with your lips! HATE STANFORD!
We have always had a notion as to the sort of people that
inhabit the God-forsaken campus 40 miles south, and our notion
is now confirmed. The rally committee, though it may have erred
in allowing the armored car to be too far in advance of the scanty
freshman guard, cannot be blamed for being routed by the most
carefully planned racketeer robbery in local history. Stanford, de
spairing of an honest burglary, imported Chicago methods. Tear
bombs may be fair play at Stanford —but then, that is Stanford!
HATE STANFORD!
We are nurturing one special animosity, and that is for Stan
ford. And we won't be very sorry if the Stanford boys find their
Quad a deserted ruin this morning, and the campus returned to
the desert from which it came.
If Stanford gets satisfaction out of this, O.K. So do we out of
HATING STANFORD!
