STANFORD, Nov. 18, 1920 -
Two Stanford undergraduates
have been suspended from the
University for one week for scalp
ing Big Game tickets, in accord
ance with action t?iken by Men's
Council this morning.
The two were also to be put on
co n d uc t probation until June.
The Graduate Managers of both
Cal and Stanford and the Alumni
Secretary have blacklisted the
two men, denying them the privi
lege of buying Big Game tickets
at any time in the future.
Today's suspension is the first
action in a concentrated cam
paign by both schools to stamp
out the illegal sales.
