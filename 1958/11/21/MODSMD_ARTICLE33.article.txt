# Immortal 21: A Fantastic Plot
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
To 21 Stanford alumni a small gold key in the form of an axe
means more than any Phi Beta Kappa key. These men are the
Immortal 21, the famed group who were responsible for one of
the most colorful and exciting events in Stanford history.
Most Stanford friends know llie incredible story of that glori
ous day in 1930 when the Axe was brought home. But, as with
all traditions, the tale of "the neatest robbery prior to the Brinks
case" has been somewhat changed through the years.
An interview with Matt Lehmann—one of the Immortal 21,
who is now an assistant instructor in the Speech and Drama De
partment —and a rereading of the "Axe Edition" of The Daily,
published April 7, 1930, cleared up several points of the fantastic
tale. Here again are the events of that fabled day, April 3, 1930.
There had been a previous plan in 1929 to regain the Axe, after
its 30-year absence, but that plan had not begun to be carried out.
The same planning group had attempted to get tear-gas bombs from
the sheriff's office in Los Angeles and, after stealing the trophy, to
escape up the Coast Highway. But the gas couldn't be obtained and
the plan wasn't developed.
Then in April 1930 the idea again returned—no pre-planning, or
detailed organization; none of the "three years of tedious planning"
which is part of the myth.
"Two days before we did it," Lehmann relates, "Bettman asked

casually, 'Matt, do you want to go
over and steal the Axe?' "
There was only one meeting—
the Tuesday before the event —at
which a plan of action was formu
lated.
"We made an agreement," Leh
mann recalls, "which was follow
ed completely: there would be no
individual heroes. Our motto was
'All for One and One for All,' and
we held to it."
Off to Gal
And so on Thursday, April 3.
1930, three cars met at the Mauso
leum and headed for the Axe rally
in Cal's Greek Theatre. This oc
casion, held the day preceding the
Cal-Stanford baseball game, was
the only time each year that the
Stanford Axe was taken out of
its Berkeley vault.
"We were wearing our old, dirty
cords that day—typical uniform

of the engineers—and our Stan
ford belt buckles. The only pre
caution I took was to replace the
Stanford sticker on my '28 Chevy
with a Cal sticker.
"Why were we 21 in number?
No special reason. We were most
ly upperclassmen, a few grad stu
dents; most of them lived in Se
quoia Hall, near the present Phys
ics Building."
"Camera" Ready
The group had what appeared
to be a camera, in reality loaded
with a homemade tear-gas bomb,
and a container of flash powder—
"ammunition" acquired hastily in
the hope of duping some unwary
guard.
At Berkeley the 21 men jeered
policemen and joined in the mob
pouring into the Greek Theatre
for the rally.
"We had tickets to the rally,
but we didn't have to use them,"
Lehmann remembers. "We helped
push in the armored car contain
ing the Axe.
"At the rally a Cal student ask
ed me for some matches, and I
handed him some with a big red S
on them. He didn't even notice!"
laughs Lehmann.
To Niles Canyon
The plan at this time was to get
the Axe and take it to James
Trimingham's father's ranch in
Niles Canyon. The whole idea
seemed so fantastic that the
group hadn't even made plans
after that.
Five Stanford men left the rally
10 minutes early and drove to the
bank, where they backed the car
onto the sidewaik and rigged up
the camera in the rumble seat.
When the rally was over, the
armored car returned to the bank
to deposit its valuable cargo, ar
riving before the throng of Cal
students. When Norm Horner of
Cal stepped out holding the Axe
tightly, the Stanford "camera
men" yelled, "Smile!"
"Freshman guards, pleased at
the chance for photographic pub
licity, eagerly fell for this ruse,"
reports The Stanford Daily of
April 7, 1930. "They politely drew
back to have their pictures taken.
"Contrary to popular belief,
Horner did not yield to the camera
ruse. He remained within the ar
mored car at first.
"An overloaded shot of flash
light powder was discharged with
a blinding flash and a whitish puff
just as Norm Horner, Axe custo
dian. stepped from the car," says
The Daily.
"Scarcely had Horner touched
the sidewalk than Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car
upon the body of the unsuspecting
custodian, wrenched the Axe from
Horner and passed the implement
through several hands to Loof
bourow. Hill and Bettman then
closed in on Horner simultaneous
ly in an effort to quell the furi
ously battling Californian."
Only Blad*'
The Axe as referred to here
was actually only the blade, as the
handle—traditionally presented to
the captain of the baseball team
was loose and slid off easily.
"Loofbourow, meanwhile, tuck
ed the treasured Axe bencalh his
sweater and calmly walked
