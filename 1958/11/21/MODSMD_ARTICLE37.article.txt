# Oskiâ€”Short In Stature But Ornery
## 
### Suzi Hardin 
If you see a Pompon Girl being
dragged across the field Saturday
by a bear in a gold-and-blue sweat
suit, fear her honor not her life.
Her abductor is one of a secret
society of Cal men, all under 5 ft.
o in., devoted to perpetuating their
fun-loving mascot, Oski.
No one knows which member is
cavorting on the field at any given
time. The r e are actually two
Oski's in each game one in the
beginning and the other at half
lime.
The wiry members of the .secret
society are usually accomplished
acrobats, who may lose as many
as five pounds in one appearance.
All this was started in 1941,
when two Cal boys decided to
show up at a football game in
bear masks. Somebody called out,
"Oski!" and the name stuck.
Since then Oski himself has de
veloped a grinning plasticine head
whose very glance has been re
ported to have driven a man in
sane.
"Silence Spells Popularity" is
the Oski association's motto, and!
it seems to have advantages.
A case in point is the $50,000 j
lawsuit brought by Charles Davis,
aged 12, against "a certain mascot
and clown dressed in a bear cos
tume who at all intercollegiate
athletic contests of said UC enter
tains and amuses the spectators
thereof."
In 19."}.') young Charles received
"a severe nervous shock" in a
children's stampede to get ice
cream thrown into the stands by
Oski. But, as Cal's paper says, |
"Who the hell is Oski?" Nobody
not even the president of the|
ASUC could find out.
Undaunted by near destitution, |
Oski has continued to appear mys
teriously lit every Cal game with
playful vengeance for the Band,,
tlie rooters and Rally Com mem
bers alike. So watch out, Red
Hots!


OSKI
Look out, girls!

veloped a grinning plasticine head
whose very glance has been re
ported to have driven a man in
sane.
"Silence Spells Popularity" is
the Oski association's motto, and!
it seems to have advantages.
A case in point is the $50,000 j
lawsuit brought by Charles Davis,
aged 12, against "a certain mascot
and clown dressed in a bear cos
tume who at all intercollegiate
athletic contests of said UC enter

thereof."

"a severe nervous shock" in a
children's stampede to get ice
cream thrown into the stands by
Oski. But, as Cal's paper says, |
"Who the hell is Oski?" Nobody
not even the president of the|
ASUC could find out.
Undaunted by near destitution, |
Oski has continued to appear mys
teriously lit every Cal game with
playful vengeance for the Band,,

OSKI
Look out, girls!


PRINCE LIGHTFOOT
The Indians' Indian
If you see a Pompon Girl being
dragged across the field Saturday
by a bear in a gold-and-blue sweat
suit, fear her honor not her life.
Her abductor is one of a secret
society of Cal men, all under 5 ft.
o in., devoted to perpetuating their
fun-loving mascot, Oski.
No one knows which member is
cavorting on the field at any given
time. The r e are actually two
Oski's in each game one in the
beginning and the other at half
lime.
The wiry members of the .secret
society are usually accomplished
acrobats, who may lose as many
as five pounds in one appearance.
All this was started in 1941,
when two Cal boys decided to
show up at a football game in
bear masks. Somebody called out,
"Oski!" and the name stuck.
Since then Oski himself has de
veloped a grinning plasticine head
whose very glance has been re
ported to have driven a man in
sane.
"Silence Spells Popularity" is
the Oski association's motto, and!
it seems to have advantages.
A case in point is the $50,000 j
lawsuit brought by Charles Davis,
aged 12, against "a certain mascot
and clown dressed in a bear cos
