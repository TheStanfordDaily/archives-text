## 
### Dallas Young 
Prince Light foot, (ho Indians'
Indian, has a hazardous job! A
few years ago danger reached it«
peak when he was attacked after
a Big Game at Berkeley.
At this particular game Light
foot suddenly discovered that the
Band had disappeared and he was
alone.
Just as he was going through
an exit, four Cal men blocked his
way. They lost their nerve when
he threatened to break a few arms
with his bow.
He was only about 20 yards
from the Stanford bus when some
body shouted to him. He turned
around, and two more Cal men
grabbed him. One took his bow
and the other tried to remove his
headdress. Instead of getting the
headdress, the student practically

got Light foot's head!
At this moment of confusion
and difficulty a heroine appeared,
A Stanford rooter vanquished the
assailants by hitting them on their
heads with her large handbag
which proved to be an effective
weapon.
Prince Lightfoot is a member
of the royal family of the Yurok
tribe of northern California. His
father is chief of the 33,000 Yu
roks. At 20. Lightfoot left home
1o attend the University of San
Francisco.
Timm Williams, as he is known
to friends, now works as a long
shoreman's clerk. He is 34 and a
resident of Kent field.
In 1951 Rally Com asked him
to dance at the Big Game rally.
In 1952 he was accepted by the
student body as its mascot.
