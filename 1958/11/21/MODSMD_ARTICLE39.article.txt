# Band Plans 'Campfire' Theme for Half Time
## 
### Camille Petersen 
The Stanford Marching Band will present
its most spectacular halfiime show of the
season Saturday at Big Game all of the
formations from the opening moon rising
over the mountain to the closing Queen
Anne Salute will feature moving parts.
An original pre-game show will set the
pace of musical activities for the afternoon.
The halftime show, based on familiar camp
fire songs, should easily take its place
among such favorites as last year's
"Around the World in 80 Days."
Halftime activities will bo opened by the
112-piece, all • male Stanford Band which
will enter the field to the"Beer Barrel
Polka" and form a mountain whose base
stretches to each 10-yard line. As the band
plays the old favorite, "By the Light of the
Silvery Moon," a large moon will rise slow
ly over the top of the mountain.
Wheel Goes 'Round
The band will then break into a long line,
representing a stream of water, and a large
circle representing a mill wheel. As the
band plays 'Down by the Old Mill Stream,"

the water will flow over the revolving
wheel and then on to form the outline of
the mill itself.
No selection of campfire songs would be
complete without a song by Stephen Foster,
and the band will play his "Old Folks at
Home" after forming a huge rocking chair
on the field. Watch carefully as the rocking
chair actually rocks to the music.
From this serene scene, the band will
change to one of particular significance to
Stanford people. To the strains of "I've
Been Working on the Railroad," the band
will form two stick figures facing each
other and each grasping a hammer. The
arms will move, swinging the hammers at
an imaginary spike.
Flickering Candle
As campfire song sessions traditionally
close, so the band halftime will close—with
the strains of "Goodnight, Ladies" played
from a candle formation. The candle flame
will flicker and then disappear as the song
ends.
Appropriately enough the "flame" por
tion of the formation is made by the sousa

phone section whose large bells catch and
reflect the sunlight, producing a near
flame-like appearance.
Before leaving the field, the band will
break into two lines facing either side of
the stadium for its trademark, the Queen
Anne Salute.
For its pre-game activities, the band will
enter from the south end of the field and
form a block "C" and play.
From C to SC
As the song ends, the outer portion of
the block "C" will expand into a large
square, leaving a small "C" in the center.
This small "C" will then contract into a
"blob" and come out in a small "S." The
small "S" and surrounding square will then
blend into the traditional block "S."
The band will outline the Stanford Axe
and play the "Scalp Song" while Prince
Light foot dances in t lie center before leav
ing the field.
After the California band presents its
pre-game show, the Stanford band will join
it on the field for the National Anthem.
