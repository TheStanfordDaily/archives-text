# Women Look Out: Plan TWIRPS Goes in Action
## 
### Camille de Campos 
Secret agents seeking to under
mine existing social structures'
have devised and somehow man
aged to enforce Plan TWIRPS for
Big Game celebrations.
TWIRPS, loosely translated, j
means "The Woman Is Required j
to Pay a Share"â€”and is the cruel- j
est and most prohibitive of the
dastardly practices advocated by |
the underground organization.
The defenseless girl is actually j
forced to contribute an equal'
share of the costs to what might i
be her own downfall.
When questioned about his chiv
alry, a Stanford man replied, "I
traded it in on a new Ford." This
is an indication of contemporary
thought.
The origin of this foul plan is
buried in ancient history. It first
appeared sometime between the
era of Cleopatra and the age of
our parents. Then it was known
as the Dutch treat system.
This sobriquet dates to the time
of an individual known as the
"Flying Dutchman." Historians
such as Will Durant, Arnold Toyn
bee and Max Shulman have re
created his story through long and
arduous research.
It seems that this man was ex
tremely attractive to women.
However, he was very hard to

I trap due to his unusual aeronau
i tical ability. Thus, those who were
| ;ible to enjoy his company were
indeed fortunate; hence the name
I "Dutch Treat," because the worn
! an had to contribute so much in
i order to obtain the favor.
However, for varying reasons,
the name is no longer apropos.
Recognizing this, the men of Stan
ford have formed a secret organi
| zation to forward the basic philo
j sophical concepts of the theory.
The TWIRPS Com meets in
Hoover Tower, equipped with tele
scopes and other necessary ma
terials to plan their misogynist
strategy.
A Stanford coed concisely pre
sents the feminine reaction as:
"Nix."
The question facing the female
collegian of today is whether to
bow to the trend and partake oJ
Big Game festivities, or to cling
to her traditional beliefs and stay
home.
It is a value judgment one
which in one form or another has
confronted society for some time.
