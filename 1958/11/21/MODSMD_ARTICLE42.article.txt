customer contacts, 1 knew immediately
that was for me."

• boards, "hands free" speakerphones

and "push button" telephone systems
for all kinds of businesses.
"This is selling at its best," says Bob.
"Customers respect the telephone com
pany and the advice and service we can
offer them. So they welcome our visits.
And I'm getting valuable experience in
business operations and in supervision
that should help me move ahead.
