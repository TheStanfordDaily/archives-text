Rally Committee promises great Ihings in 1 his year's "best of all

possible card sections." The root
ing section will cover one-fourth
of the side of the stadium, and it
will be composed of 1000 students
using six cards each, a total of
more than four tons of cards.
Stanford rooters are ofjen cred
ited with being the first in the na
tion to perform stunts in the
bleachers between halves of a
football game. The true begin
ning of card stunts was in 1904
when Stanford rooters formed a
chalk white "S" by rooters don
ning cooks' caps and coats.
Cal tried to imitate Stanford
when, in 1909, their rooters sat in
alternate rows of blue and yellow.
In 1910 the rooters formed an axe
in blue with a golden "C" in it.
Stanford outdid Cal again in
1 1920. On a field of white appeared
ja neat little coffin with a yellow
I "C" in it while the band played a
: funeral dirge. Then a giant crim
son axe was formed.
In 1939, for the first time in
Farm history, women as well as
men participated in card stunts.
The entire stunt section contained
2200 students. The biggest inno
vation was the moving stunt a

large Stanford Indian waving hi
hand in greeting to Berkeley root
ers.
