# BEARS FAVORED BY 12- BUT IT'S THE BIG GAME!
## Indians Seek to Shatter Cal's Rose Bowl Dream 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
Northern California's greatest soei.il event gets under way at 1:30 p.m.
Saturday when the Stanford Indians clash with California's Golden Bears
at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. Eighty-one thousand four hundred nine
screaming fans are expected to watch the 61st renewal of the Big Game.
Season performances of both clubs, Cal's 6-3 record and Stanford's 2-7
showing, have installed the Bears as 12-point favorites, but there isn't a
soul around who believes either squad is favored in the big one.
Both squads finished up the special play efforts and last-minute additions to their attacks yes
terday. Both will work out briefly today in polish-up sessions. Then only time will tell.
At Stanford, head man Jack Curtice called another short workout for his men yesterday, and
then had them watching movies of Cal in action this year, and in the6olh tremendous tussle of last
year. Stanford will work out in sweat togs today at 2:30 p.m. before taking off for a secluded night
before somewhere across the Bay.
At Berkeley, Pete Klliott sent the Cal squad through a light workout today with Kapp complet
ng a healthy number of passes in the process. Elliott made one last-minute change, replacing Skip
Huber with Tom Bates at end. »

Saturday's iiig Game will be a
lie-breaking game as I lie teams
each Itolcl 25 wins in the scries.
There have been ten ties. In
1954, and again in 1956, tlie se
ries was tied and the Bears bust
ed it up both years to take the
lead. Stanford, in eaeh of the
following years, came back to
even the over-all picture.
There are so many angles 1o
look at Big Game from. Past his
tory will be working against the
Bears, as the home team, Satur
day. Home squads have a 19-22-10
record. Nine games were played
on neutral fields. The tide is
changing, though, as the last four
Big Games have been won by the
home club.
Spectators will be watching
some outstanding individual per
formances on Memorial Stadium
turf Saturday. California quar
terback Joe Kapp is almost a
cinch to haul in All-American
honors this year, a story convinc
ingly touched off with the appear
ance of some national magazine
people on the Cal campus a week
ago.
rCC Record
Kapp has already set a Pacific
Coast Conference rushing mark
for quarterbacks with his 540
yards gained. He also leads the
PCC in total offense with 1131
yards.
Though a fine quarterback,
Kapp does not figure to outdo
Stanford's three field generals
hands down. The Card trio of
Bob Nicolet, Dick Norman and Sid
Garber should come up with some
fine games.
Nicolet and Norman are holding
tight onto the first and second
spots, respectively, in Coast pass
ing. Nicolet is 68 for 127 and 641
yards; Norman goes 63 for 11 and
561 yards. Garber is the only run
ner of the Injun signal-callers.
Anot her Leader
Stanford will put another con
ference leader onto the field in
the person of end Chris Burford.
Burford leads the league in pass
receptions with 41 grabs. He's just
five receptions short of tying the
mark of 46 set. by Ed Barker of
Washington State in 1951.
Behind Kapp, California will
field two good running backs in
fullback Bill Patton and halfback
Jack Hart. The Indians will play
halfback Rick McMillen, and he,
too. is expected to put in a stand
out performance. Fans will be re
membering McMillen's running in
the Washington game. After his
forced rest, McMillen will go full
tilt this time around.
The Bears, on the way to Ihc
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, have just
one hurdle on the road 1o the
PCC's last championship, and that
is, of course, the upstart Indians
from Palo Alto. California hopes
to come up with a 6-1 conference


CALIFORNIA HEAD COACH PETE ELLIOTT
record this year, and, if they do,
they'll l>e reversing their 1-6 mark
set last year.
One of the country's most fa
mous trophies is up for grabs to
morrow, and the vinner will look
forward to having tnat Stanford
Axe hanging in public view for
the next year. When the Stanford
Rally Committee takes the trophy
out of its case, the boys will be
wishing, along with most of the
Stanford student body, that, it's
just a brief, one-day visit to Berke
ley that the. hatchet is making.
Big Came 1958 shapes up as a
Stanford air attack meeting the
Berkeley boys' ground game. Ba
sically, this is what it probably
will be, but there are some supple
mentary issues involved.
Joe Kapp has proved on occa
sion that he can get off necessary,
and even a few superfluous, pass
es. Fifty-two of K a p p's 87 at
tempts have found their way into
friendly hands—in the process,
grinding up 591. yards.
But the Stanford attack is not

all an aerial attack, either. Card
runners McMillen, Doug Dick and
Gil Dowd should put on a good
ground show. McMillen has rack
ed up 228 yards in 39 carries; he
has a 5.85 running average.
M c M i 11 en's 185 - yard show
against the Washington Huskies
was a treat that Stanford fans
will # not soon forget. Dick has
galloped for 219 yards in 54 car
ries, a 4.06 average. Dowd has 154
yards to his credit, fie, like the
other two, has also had an injury
spell this season.
Going inlo the Big Game, Cali
fornia has a 6-3 average. The
Golden Bears dropped two inter
sectionals, 24-20 to COP and 32-12
to Michigan, and then dropped a
conference lill to Oregon State's
Beavers, 11-8.
There hasn't been any change
in the injury situation in both
camps. At Stanford, Bob Peterson
and Jim Byrer are still ruled out
of the Big Game.
Byrer, though, has a slight hope
of getting into the tussle. What
had been ruled a bone fracture
has turned out to be a severe
muscle strain, and Byrer still has

hopes of seeing action.
Halfback Hank Olguin, injured
in the Cal Washington game last
Saturday, will definitely not see
action for the Berkeley ite-s. End
Jerry Lundgren, a doubtful ear
lier in the week, made it into prac
tice Wednesday and now looks
like he will regain his starting
position.
Big Game, regardless of how it
stacks up prior to game time, will
be an interesting battle. Nineteen
of t he past big one§ have been de
cided by a touchdown or less. The

last two years saw extra points '
loom large as California grabbed |
a 20-18 victory in '56 and Stanford
came bark to take it, 1412, in '57.
Cal mentor Pete Elliott has just
about decided on his starting line
up for the game. The Blue and
Gold will be represented at ends
by Tom. Bates and Jerry Lund
gren, at tackles by Frank Sally
and Pat Newell, at guards by Pete
Domoto and Don Piestrup, at
quarterback by Kap p, at half
backs by Grover Garvin and Jack
Hart, and at fullback by Bill
Pal ton.

At Stanford, head man Jack Curtice called another short workout for his men yesterday, and

year. Stanford will work out in sweat togs today at 2:30 p.m. before taking off for a secluded night
before somewhere across the Bay.

Saturday's iiig Game will be a
lie-breaking game as I lie teams
each Itolcl 25 wins in the scries.
There have been ten ties. In
1954, and again in 1956, tlie se
ries was tied and the Bears bust
ed it up both years to take the
lead. Stanford, in eaeh of the
following years, came back to
even the over-all picture.
There are so many angles 1o
look at Big Game from. Past his
tory will be working against the
Bears, as the home team, Satur
day. Home squads have a 19-22-10
record. Nine games were played
on neutral fields. The tide is
changing, though, as the last four
Big Games have been won by the
home club.
Spectators will be watching
some outstanding individual per
formances on Memorial Stadium
turf Saturday. California quar
terback Joe Kapp is almost a
cinch to haul in All-American
honors this year, a story convinc
ingly touched off with the appear
ance of some national magazine
people on the Cal campus a week
ago.
rCC Record
Kapp has already set a Pacific
Coast Conference rushing mark
for quarterbacks with his 540
yards gained. He also leads the
PCC in total offense with 1131
yards.
Though a fine quarterback,
Kapp does not figure to outdo
Stanford's three field generals
hands down. The Card trio of
Bob Nicolet, Dick Norman and Sid
Garber should come up with some
fine games.
Nicolet and Norman are holding
tight onto the first and second
spots, respectively, in Coast pass
ing. Nicolet is 68 for 127 and 641
yards; Norman goes 63 for 11 and
561 yards. Garber is the only run
ner of the Injun signal-callers.
Anot her Leader
Stanford will put another con
ference leader onto the field in
the person of end Chris Burford.
Burford leads the league in pass
receptions with 41 grabs. He's just
five receptions short of tying the
mark of 46 set. by Ed Barker of
Washington State in 1951.
Behind Kapp, California will
field two good running backs in
fullback Bill Patton and halfback
Jack Hart. The Indians will play
halfback Rick McMillen, and he,
too. is expected to put in a stand
out performance. Fans will be re
membering McMillen's running in
the Washington game. After his
forced rest, McMillen will go full
tilt this time around.
The Bears, on the way to Ihc
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, have just
one hurdle on the road 1o the
PCC's last championship, and that
is, of course, the upstart Indians
from Palo Alto. California hopes
to come up with a 6-1 conference


CALIFORNIA HEAD COACH PETE ELLIOTT
record this year, and, if they do,
they'll l>e reversing their 1-6 mark
set last year.
One of the country's most fa
mous trophies is up for grabs to
morrow, and the vinner will look
forward to having tnat Stanford
Axe hanging in public view for
the next year. When the Stanford
Rally Committee takes the trophy
out of its case, the boys will be
wishing, along with most of the
Stanford student body, that, it's
just a brief, one-day visit to Berke
ley that the. hatchet is making.
Big Came 1958 shapes up as a
Stanford air attack meeting the
Berkeley boys' ground game. Ba
sically, this is what it probably
will be, but there are some supple
mentary issues involved.
Joe Kapp has proved on occa
sion that he can get off necessary,
and even a few superfluous, pass
es. Fifty-two of K a p p's 87 at
tempts have found their way into
friendly hands—in the process,
grinding up 591. yards.
But the Stanford attack is not

all an aerial attack, either. Card
runners McMillen, Doug Dick and
Gil Dowd should put on a good
ground show. McMillen has rack
ed up 228 yards in 39 carries; he
has a 5.85 running average.
M c M i 11 en's 185 - yard show
against the Washington Huskies
was a treat that Stanford fans
will # not soon forget. Dick has
galloped for 219 yards in 54 car
ries, a 4.06 average. Dowd has 154
yards to his credit, fie, like the
other two, has also had an injury
spell this season.
Going inlo the Big Game, Cali
fornia has a 6-3 average. The
Golden Bears dropped two inter
sectionals, 24-20 to COP and 32-12
to Michigan, and then dropped a
conference lill to Oregon State's
Beavers, 11-8.
There hasn't been any change
in the injury situation in both
camps. At Stanford, Bob Peterson
and Jim Byrer are still ruled out
of the Big Game.
Byrer, though, has a slight hope
of getting into the tussle. What
had been ruled a bone fracture
has turned out to be a severe
muscle strain, and Byrer still has

hopes of seeing action.
Halfback Hank Olguin, injured
in the Cal Washington game last
Saturday, will definitely not see
action for the Berkeley ite-s. End
Jerry Lundgren, a doubtful ear
lier in the week, made it into prac
tice Wednesday and now looks
like he will regain his starting
position.
Big Game, regardless of how it
stacks up prior to game time, will
be an interesting battle. Nineteen
of t he past big one§ have been de
cided by a touchdown or less. The

last two years saw extra points '
loom large as California grabbed |
a 20-18 victory in '56 and Stanford
came bark to take it, 1412, in '57.
Cal mentor Pete Elliott has just
about decided on his starting line
up for the game. The Blue and
Gold will be represented at ends
by Tom. Bates and Jerry Lund
gren, at tackles by Frank Sally
and Pat Newell, at guards by Pete
Domoto and Don Piestrup, at
quarterback by Kap p, at half
backs by Grover Garvin and Jack
Hart, and at fullback by Bill
Pal ton.
Northern California's greatest soei.il event gets under way at 1:30 p.m.
Saturday when the Stanford Indians clash with California's Golden Bears
at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. Eighty-one thousand four hundred nine
screaming fans are expected to watch the 61st renewal of the Big Game.

1954, and again in 1956, tlie se
ries was tied and the Bears bust
ed it up both years to take the
lead. Stanford, in eaeh of the
following years, came back to
even the over-all picture.
There are so many angles 1o
look at Big Game from. Past his
tory will be working against the
Bears, as the home team, Satur
day. Home squads have a 19-22-10
record. Nine games were played
on neutral fields. The tide is
changing, though, as the last four
Big Games have been won by the
home club.
Spectators will be watching
some outstanding individual per
formances on Memorial Stadium
turf Saturday. California quar
terback Joe Kapp is almost a
cinch to haul in All-American
honors this year, a story convinc
ingly touched off with the appear
ance of some national magazine
people on the Cal campus a week
ago.
rCC Record
Kapp has already set a Pacific
Coast Conference rushing mark
for quarterbacks with his 540
yards gained. He also leads the
PCC in total offense with 1131
yards.
Though a fine quarterback,
Kapp does not figure to outdo
Stanford's three field generals
hands down. The Card trio of
Bob Nicolet, Dick Norman and Sid
Garber should come up with some
fine games.
Nicolet and Norman are holding
tight onto the first and second
spots, respectively, in Coast pass
ing. Nicolet is 68 for 127 and 641
yards; Norman goes 63 for 11 and
561 yards. Garber is the only run
ner of the Injun signal-callers.
Anot her Leader
Stanford will put another con
ference leader onto the field in
the person of end Chris Burford.
Burford leads the league in pass
receptions with 41 grabs. He's just
five receptions short of tying the
mark of 46 set. by Ed Barker of
Washington State in 1951.
Behind Kapp, California will
field two good running backs in
fullback Bill Patton and halfback
Jack Hart. The Indians will play
halfback Rick McMillen, and he,
too. is expected to put in a stand
out performance. Fans will be re
membering McMillen's running in
the Washington game. After his
forced rest, McMillen will go full
tilt this time around.
The Bears, on the way to Ihc
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, have just
one hurdle on the road 1o the
PCC's last championship, and that
is, of course, the upstart Indians
from Palo Alto. California hopes
to come up with a 6-1 conference

they'll l>e reversing their 1-6 mark
set last year.
One of the country's most fa
mous trophies is up for grabs to
morrow, and the vinner will look
forward to having tnat Stanford
Axe hanging in public view for
the next year. When the Stanford
Rally Committee takes the trophy
out of its case, the boys will be
wishing, along with most of the
Stanford student body, that, it's
just a brief, one-day visit to Berke
ley that the. hatchet is making.
Big Came 1958 shapes up as a
Stanford air attack meeting the
Berkeley boys' ground game. Ba
sically, this is what it probably
will be, but there are some supple
mentary issues involved.
Joe Kapp has proved on occa
sion that he can get off necessary,
and even a few superfluous, pass
es. Fifty-two of K a p p's 87 at
tempts have found their way into
friendly hands—in the process,
grinding up 591. yards.
But the Stanford attack is not

all an aerial attack, either. Card
runners McMillen, Doug Dick and
Gil Dowd should put on a good
ground show. McMillen has rack
ed up 228 yards in 39 carries; he
has a 5.85 running average.
M c M i 11 en's 185 - yard show
against the Washington Huskies
was a treat that Stanford fans
will # not soon forget. Dick has
galloped for 219 yards in 54 car
ries, a 4.06 average. Dowd has 154
yards to his credit, fie, like the
other two, has also had an injury
spell this season.
Going inlo the Big Game, Cali
fornia has a 6-3 average. The
Golden Bears dropped two inter
sectionals, 24-20 to COP and 32-12
to Michigan, and then dropped a
conference lill to Oregon State's
Beavers, 11-8.
There hasn't been any change
in the injury situation in both
camps. At Stanford, Bob Peterson
and Jim Byrer are still ruled out
of the Big Game.
Byrer, though, has a slight hope
of getting into the tussle. What
had been ruled a bone fracture
has turned out to be a severe
muscle strain, and Byrer still has

hopes of seeing action.
Halfback Hank Olguin, injured
in the Cal Washington game last
Saturday, will definitely not see
action for the Berkeley ite-s. End
Jerry Lundgren, a doubtful ear
lier in the week, made it into prac
tice Wednesday and now looks
like he will regain his starting
position.
Big Game, regardless of how it
stacks up prior to game time, will
be an interesting battle. Nineteen
of t he past big one§ have been de
cided by a touchdown or less. The

last two years saw extra points '
loom large as California grabbed |
a 20-18 victory in '56 and Stanford
came bark to take it, 1412, in '57.
Cal mentor Pete Elliott has just
about decided on his starting line
up for the game. The Blue and
Gold will be represented at ends
by Tom. Bates and Jerry Lund

Season performances of both clubs, Cal's 6-3 record and Stanford's 2-7

cinch to haul in All-American
honors this year, a story convinc
ingly touched off with the appear
ance of some national magazine
people on the Cal campus a week
ago.
rCC Record
Kapp has already set a Pacific
Coast Conference rushing mark
for quarterbacks with his 540
yards gained. He also leads the
PCC in total offense with 1131
yards.
Though a fine quarterback,
Kapp does not figure to outdo
Stanford's three field generals
hands down. The Card trio of
Bob Nicolet, Dick Norman and Sid
Garber should come up with some
fine games.
Nicolet and Norman are holding
tight onto the first and second
spots, respectively, in Coast pass
ing. Nicolet is 68 for 127 and 641
yards; Norman goes 63 for 11 and
561 yards. Garber is the only run
ner of the Injun signal-callers.
Anot her Leader
Stanford will put another con
ference leader onto the field in
the person of end Chris Burford.
Burford leads the league in pass
receptions with 41 grabs. He's just
five receptions short of tying the
mark of 46 set. by Ed Barker of
Washington State in 1951.
Behind Kapp, California will
field two good running backs in
fullback Bill Patton and halfback
Jack Hart. The Indians will play
halfback Rick McMillen, and he,
too. is expected to put in a stand
out performance. Fans will be re
membering McMillen's running in
the Washington game. After his
forced rest, McMillen will go full
tilt this time around.
The Bears, on the way to Ihc
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, have just
one hurdle on the road 1o the
PCC's last championship, and that
is, of course, the upstart Indians
from Palo Alto. California hopes
to come up with a 6-1 conference


CALIFORNIA HEAD COACH PETE ELLIOTT
record this year, and, if they do,
they'll l>e reversing their 1-6 mark
set last year.
One of the country's most fa
mous trophies is up for grabs to
morrow, and the vinner will look
forward to having tnat Stanford
Axe hanging in public view for
the next year. When the Stanford
Rally Committee takes the trophy
out of its case, the boys will be
wishing, along with most of the
Stanford student body, that, it's
just a brief, one-day visit to Berke
ley that the. hatchet is making.
Big Came 1958 shapes up as a
Stanford air attack meeting the
Berkeley boys' ground game. Ba
sically, this is what it probably
will be, but there are some supple
mentary issues involved.
Joe Kapp has proved on occa
sion that he can get off necessary,
and even a few superfluous, pass
es. Fifty-two of K a p p's 87 at
tempts have found their way into
friendly hands—in the process,
grinding up 591. yards.
But the Stanford attack is not

all an aerial attack, either. Card
runners McMillen, Doug Dick and
Gil Dowd should put on a good
ground show. McMillen has rack
ed up 228 yards in 39 carries; he
has a 5.85 running average.
M c M i 11 en's 185 - yard show
against the Washington Huskies
was a treat that Stanford fans
will # not soon forget. Dick has
galloped for 219 yards in 54 car
ries, a 4.06 average. Dowd has 154
yards to his credit, fie, like the
other two, has also had an injury
spell this season.
Going inlo the Big Game, Cali
fornia has a 6-3 average. The
Golden Bears dropped two inter
sectionals, 24-20 to COP and 32-12
to Michigan, and then dropped a
conference lill to Oregon State's
Beavers, 11-8.
There hasn't been any change
in the injury situation in both
camps. At Stanford, Bob Peterson
and Jim Byrer are still ruled out
of the Big Game.
Byrer, though, has a slight hope
of getting into the tussle. What
had been ruled a bone fracture
has turned out to be a severe
muscle strain, and Byrer still has

hopes of seeing action.
Halfback Hank Olguin, injured
in the Cal Washington game last
Saturday, will definitely not see
action for the Berkeley ite-s. End
Jerry Lundgren, a doubtful ear
lier in the week, made it into prac
tice Wednesday and now looks
like he will regain his starting
position.
Big Game, regardless of how it
stacks up prior to game time, will
be an interesting battle. Nineteen
of t he past big one§ have been de
cided by a touchdown or less. The

last two years saw extra points '
loom large as California grabbed |
a 20-18 victory in '56 and Stanford
came bark to take it, 1412, in '57.
Cal mentor Pete Elliott has just
about decided on his starting line
up for the game. The Blue and
Gold will be represented at ends
by Tom. Bates and Jerry Lund
gren, at tackles by Frank Sally
and Pat Newell, at guards by Pete
Domoto and Don Piestrup, at
quarterback by Kap p, at half
backs by Grover Garvin and Jack
Hart, and at fullback by Bill
Pal ton.
Northern California's greatest soei.il event gets under way at 1:30 p.m.
Saturday when the Stanford Indians clash with California's Golden Bears
at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. Eighty-one thousand four hundred nine
screaming fans are expected to watch the 61st renewal of the Big Game.
Season performances of both clubs, Cal's 6-3 record and Stanford's 2-7
showing, have installed the Bears as 12-point favorites, but there isn't a
soul around who believes either squad is favored in the big one.
Both squads finished up the special play efforts and last-minute additions to their attacks yes
terday. Both will work out briefly today in polish-up sessions. Then only time will tell.
At Stanford, head man Jack Curtice called another short workout for his men yesterday, and
then had them watching movies of Cal in action this year, and in the6olh tremendous tussle of last
year. Stanford will work out in sweat togs today at 2:30 p.m. before taking off for a secluded night
before somewhere across the Bay.
At Berkeley, Pete Klliott sent the Cal squad through a light workout today with Kapp complet
ng a healthy number of passes in the process. Elliott made one last-minute change, replacing Skip
Huber with Tom Bates at end. »

Saturday's iiig Game will be a
lie-breaking game as I lie teams
each Itolcl 25 wins in the scries.
There have been ten ties. In
1954, and again in 1956, tlie se
ries was tied and the Bears bust
ed it up both years to take the
lead. Stanford, in eaeh of the
following years, came back to
even the over-all picture.
There are so many angles 1o
look at Big Game from. Past his
tory will be working against the
Bears, as the home team, Satur
day. Home squads have a 19-22-10
record. Nine games were played
on neutral fields. The tide is
changing, though, as the last four
Big Games have been won by the
home club.

yards; Norman goes 63 for 11 and
561 yards. Garber is the only run
ner of the Injun signal-callers.
Anot her Leader
Stanford will put another con
ference leader onto the field in
the person of end Chris Burford.
Burford leads the league in pass
receptions with 41 grabs. He's just
five receptions short of tying the
mark of 46 set. by Ed Barker of
Washington State in 1951.
Behind Kapp, California will
field two good running backs in
fullback Bill Patton and halfback
Jack Hart. The Indians will play
halfback Rick McMillen, and he,
too. is expected to put in a stand
out performance. Fans will be re
membering McMillen's running in
the Washington game. After his
forced rest, McMillen will go full
tilt this time around.
The Bears, on the way to Ihc
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, have just
one hurdle on the road 1o the
PCC's last championship, and that
is, of course, the upstart Indians
from Palo Alto. California hopes
to come up with a 6-1 conference

record this year, and, if they do,
they'll l>e reversing their 1-6 mark
set last year.
One of the country's most fa
mous trophies is up for grabs to
morrow, and the vinner will look
forward to having tnat Stanford
Axe hanging in public view for
the next year. When the Stanford
Rally Committee takes the trophy
out of its case, the boys will be
wishing, along with most of the
Stanford student body, that, it's
just a brief, one-day visit to Berke
ley that the. hatchet is making.
Big Came 1958 shapes up as a
Stanford air attack meeting the
Berkeley boys' ground game. Ba
sically, this is what it probably
will be, but there are some supple
mentary issues involved.
Joe Kapp has proved on occa
sion that he can get off necessary,
and even a few superfluous, pass
es. Fifty-two of K a p p's 87 at
tempts have found their way into
friendly hands—in the process,
grinding up 591. yards.
But the Stanford attack is not

all an aerial attack, either. Card
runners McMillen, Doug Dick and
Gil Dowd should put on a good
ground show. McMillen has rack
ed up 228 yards in 39 carries; he
has a 5.85 running average.
M c M i 11 en's 185 - yard show
against the Washington Huskies
was a treat that Stanford fans
will # not soon forget. Dick has
galloped for 219 yards in 54 car
ries, a 4.06 average. Dowd has 154
yards to his credit, fie, like the
other two, has also had an injury
spell this season.
Going inlo the Big Game, Cali
fornia has a 6-3 average. The
Golden Bears dropped two inter
sectionals, 24-20 to COP and 32-12
to Michigan, and then dropped a
conference lill to Oregon State's
Beavers, 11-8.
There hasn't been any change
in the injury situation in both
camps. At Stanford, Bob Peterson
and Jim Byrer are still ruled out
of the Big Game.
Byrer, though, has a slight hope
of getting into the tussle. What
had been ruled a bone fracture
has turned out to be a severe
muscle strain, and Byrer still has

hopes of seeing action.
Halfback Hank Olguin, injured
in the Cal Washington game last
Saturday, will definitely not see
action for the Berkeley ite-s. End
Jerry Lundgren, a doubtful ear
lier in the week, made it into prac
tice Wednesday and now looks
like he will regain his starting
position.
Big Game, regardless of how it
stacks up prior to game time, will
be an interesting battle. Nineteen
of t he past big one§ have been de
cided by a touchdown or less. The

last two years saw extra points '
loom large as California grabbed |
a 20-18 victory in '56 and Stanford
came bark to take it, 1412, in '57.
Cal mentor Pete Elliott has just
about decided on his starting line
up for the game. The Blue and
Gold will be represented at ends
by Tom. Bates and Jerry Lund
gren, at tackles by Frank Sally
and Pat Newell, at guards by Pete
Domoto and Don Piestrup, at
quarterback by Kap p, at half
backs by Grover Garvin and Jack
Hart, and at fullback by Bill
Pal ton.
