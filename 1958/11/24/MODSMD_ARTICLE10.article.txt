# BEARS WIN AXE IN 16-15 THRILLER
## Two Conversion Misses Spell Stanford Downfall 
### Steve Baffcey, Sports Editor 
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
