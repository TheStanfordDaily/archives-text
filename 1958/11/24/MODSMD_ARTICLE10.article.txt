# BEARS WIN AXE IN 16-15 THRILLER
## Two Conversion Misses Spell Stanford Downfall 
### Steve Baffcey, Sports Editor 
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays
which continually clipped off
j yardage up the middle. I la it
picked up the six points with a
dive over right guard from the
lone. Halfback Grover Garvin-got
I by two Stanford defenders to
; make it H O, Hears.
Determined Indians
Stanford then started a deter
mined drive, which at times
looked as though the Indians
were trying too hard, on its 37.
Norman directed the team to the
California 38 before halfback
Steve Bales intercepted an aerial
on the 2!) and ran it to the 39.
Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right
end to score the six then disap
pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first
quarter had three minutes to go.
Cal ran and passed to two first
downs in bridging the g;ip be
tween ij u a r t e r s before being
forced to punt out from midfield.
Bond relumed for the (.lards to
their 22.
Drive Stopped
With Nieolel ihe field general
the Indians bowled down to a first
and ten on the Cal 13 in a drive
which was highlighted by .11
yards of pass completion.
Fullback Dick carried to the
eight; Nieolel came close on a
pass to Bond but it was beyond
the halfback's fingertips. Cal
guard Bete Dornoto threw Dick
j for a loss of one. On the fourth
and six situation at the Cal nine,
Face split the uprights for three
points and a 9-H Stanford lead,
j Cal drove back upfield after
! ihe kickoff and was finally held
on a fourth down on the Card 20.
The Indians netted minus Iwo
i yards in three plays, kicked out
! and were hard pressed to hold
j back a Bear drive as the quarter
ended with Conklin intercepting
j a Kapp aerial* •
Hart and Crow led Ihe Cal
I I'D drive two thirds ol Ihe way
| through chapter three with llarl
again piling over from the one
for Ihe score. This time Wayne
{ Crow grabbed a Kapp pass for the
two extras.
Cal Try Misses
Both clubs exchanged down sc
ries to finish out the quarter and
! Cal put fear into Stanford hearts
I as the final 1.1 minutes stal led,
j The Gold and Blue drove to a first
down on the Card 21, lost 12
I yards, then gained 14 and were on
I the I!) with a fourth and eight,
j Here Tony Benin tried a field
goal which missed.
Stanford had a chance and Nor
[ man directed the club to a third
land two situation on the Bears'

20. Two passes went incomplete.
Cal took over with time run
ning out. Held to a l'oinih down
deep in their own territory, the
Californians punted out. A pen
alty and a seven-yard loss on the
first play from scrimmage found
the Stanfords with a second and
17 (iii their own 1.1 with three min
utes to go. Norman passed like
;i madman and brought the Cards
to the Cal 21, first and ten. A
pass to Bowers got away from
the fullback; then Freis was in
the end zone with tlieTl) pass-on
the next play.
Hit;' Came (Jimax
The story from here is dramat
ic, a lilting one for a Big Game.
They didn't make t hat conversion,
that brand new two-point conver
sion rule I hat maybe Jack Cur
lice wishes he hadn't voted for in
the rules committee meeting
now; but then, too, he could have
won on it.
Stanford got 1(1 first downs, ihe
Bears had 1!). Cardinals dominat

led the passing statistics, 279 to
fjS yards. Cal got off HI offensive
; plays, the Indians went on 01.
| There was only one penalty
j marched of 112, a 15-yarder against
i Stanford.
Statistics Don't Tell
The statistics don't tell why
I Stanford lost, all they tell is that
| the Stanford air attack beat CaPs
'and that the Bear ground attack
topped Stanford. They say the
! game was close and it sure was.
They don't quite say that Stan
ford played its best game of the
I season but it did.
And so the Axe is gone. So is
! the PCC, for this was one of the
| Coast Conference's final games.
And next year, here in Stan
ford Stadium, the clubs will meet j
again as part of a new confer- j
ence schedule, or maybe as an in- J
! dividually scheduled game. Then
jibe Axe will come back lo Slan-'
| ford for how long? For hours j
or for months? Who can say?
j There are promises, however.

Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In

next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays

Three plays and seven Cal

the double reverse pass to Nikolai

Drive Stopped
With Nieolel ihe field general
the Indians bowled down to a first

which was highlighted by .11

Fullback Dick carried to the

Cards' Larry Lueey (07) nears third point ol three-point landing
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears

California 38 before halfback

Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right

pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first

Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays
which continually clipped off
j yardage up the middle. I la it
picked up the six points with a
dive over right guard from the
lone. Halfback Grover Garvin-got
I by two Stanford defenders to
; make it H O, Hears.
Determined Indians
Stanford then started a deter
mined drive, which at times
looked as though the Indians
were trying too hard, on its 37.
Norman directed the team to the
California 38 before halfback
Steve Bales intercepted an aerial
on the 2!) and ran it to the 39.
Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right
end to score the six then disap
pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first
quarter had three minutes to go.
Cal ran and passed to two first
downs in bridging the g;ip be
tween ij u a r t e r s before being
forced to punt out from midfield.
Bond relumed for the (.lards to
their 22.
Drive Stopped
With Nieolel ihe field general
the Indians bowled down to a first
and ten on the Cal 13 in a drive
which was highlighted by .11
yards of pass completion.
Fullback Dick carried to the
eight; Nieolel came close on a
pass to Bond but it was beyond
the halfback's fingertips. Cal
guard Bete Dornoto threw Dick
j for a loss of one. On the fourth
and six situation at the Cal nine,
Face split the uprights for three
points and a 9-H Stanford lead,
j Cal drove back upfield after
! ihe kickoff and was finally held
on a fourth down on the Card 20.
The Indians netted minus Iwo
i yards in three plays, kicked out
! and were hard pressed to hold

ended with Conklin intercepting
j a Kapp aerial* •
Hart and Crow led Ihe Cal
I I'D drive two thirds ol Ihe way

again piling over from the one
for Ihe score. This time Wayne

Cal Try Misses
Both clubs exchanged down sc

I as the final 1.1 minutes stal led,
j The Gold and Blue drove to a first
down on the Card 21, lost 12

Stanford had a chance and Nor
[ man directed the club to a third
land two situation on the Bears'

20. Two passes went incomplete.
Cal took over with time run
ning out. Held to a l'oinih down
deep in their own territory, the
Californians punted out. A pen
alty and a seven-yard loss on the
first play from scrimmage found
the Stanfords with a second and
17 (iii their own 1.1 with three min
utes to go. Norman passed like
;i madman and brought the Cards
to the Cal 21, first and ten. A
pass to Bowers got away from
the fullback; then Freis was in
the end zone with tlieTl) pass-on
the next play.
Hit;' Came (Jimax
The story from here is dramat

They didn't make t hat conversion,
that brand new two-point conver

won on it.
Stanford got 1(1 first downs, ihe
Bears had 1!). Cardinals dominat

Cards' Larry Lueey (07) nears third point ol three-point landing
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.

Cards' Larry Lueey (07) nears third point ol three-point landing
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays
which continually clipped off
j yardage up the middle. I la it
picked up the six points with a
dive over right guard from the
lone. Halfback Grover Garvin-got
I by two Stanford defenders to
; make it H O, Hears.
Determined Indians
Stanford then started a deter
mined drive, which at times
looked as though the Indians
were trying too hard, on its 37.
Norman directed the team to the
California 38 before halfback
Steve Bales intercepted an aerial
on the 2!) and ran it to the 39.
Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right
end to score the six then disap
pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first
quarter had three minutes to go.
Cal ran and passed to two first
downs in bridging the g;ip be
tween ij u a r t e r s before being
forced to punt out from midfield.
Bond relumed for the (.lards to
their 22.

With Nieolel ihe field general

end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays
which continually clipped off
j yardage up the middle. I la it
picked up the six points with a
dive over right guard from the
lone. Halfback Grover Garvin-got
I by two Stanford defenders to
; make it H O, Hears.
Determined Indians
Stanford then started a deter
mined drive, which at times
looked as though the Indians
were trying too hard, on its 37.
Norman directed the team to the
California 38 before halfback
Steve Bales intercepted an aerial
on the 2!) and ran it to the 39.
Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right
end to score the six then disap
pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first
quarter had three minutes to go.
Cal ran and passed to two first
downs in bridging the g;ip be
tween ij u a r t e r s before being
forced to punt out from midfield.
Bond relumed for the (.lards to
their 22.
Drive Stopped
With Nieolel ihe field general
the Indians bowled down to a first
and ten on the Cal 13 in a drive
which was highlighted by .11
yards of pass completion.
Fullback Dick carried to the
eight; Nieolel came close on a
pass to Bond but it was beyond
the halfback's fingertips. Cal
guard Bete Dornoto threw Dick
j for a loss of one. On the fourth
and six situation at the Cal nine,
Face split the uprights for three
points and a 9-H Stanford lead,

Stanford had a chance and Nor
[ man directed the club to a third
land two situation on the Bears'

20. Two passes went incomplete.
Cal took over with time run
ning out. Held to a l'oinih down
deep in their own territory, the
Californians punted out. A pen
alty and a seven-yard loss on the
first play from scrimmage found
the Stanfords with a second and
17 (iii their own 1.1 with three min
utes to go. Norman passed like
;i madman and brought the Cards
to the Cal 21, first and ten. A
pass to Bowers got away from
the fullback; then Freis was in
the end zone with tlieTl) pass-on
the next play.

The story from here is dramat

They didn't make t hat conversion,

Stanford got 1(1 first downs, ihe

Cards' Larry Lueey (07) nears third point ol three-point landing
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to

Cards' Larry Lueey (07) nears third point ol three-point landing
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays
which continually clipped off
j yardage up the middle. I la it
picked up the six points with a
dive over right guard from the
lone. Halfback Grover Garvin-got
I by two Stanford defenders to
; make it H O, Hears.
Determined Indians
Stanford then started a deter
mined drive, which at times
looked as though the Indians
were trying too hard, on its 37.
Norman directed the team to the
California 38 before halfback
Steve Bales intercepted an aerial
on the 2!) and ran it to the 39.
Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right
end to score the six then disap
pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first
quarter had three minutes to go.
Cal ran and passed to two first
downs in bridging the g;ip be
tween ij u a r t e r s before being
forced to punt out from midfield.
Bond relumed for the (.lards to
their 22.
Drive Stopped
With Nieolel ihe field general
the Indians bowled down to a first
and ten on the Cal 13 in a drive
which was highlighted by .11
yards of pass completion.
Fullback Dick carried to the
eight; Nieolel came close on a
pass to Bond but it was beyond
the halfback's fingertips. Cal
guard Bete Dornoto threw Dick
j for a loss of one. On the fourth
and six situation at the Cal nine,
Face split the uprights for three
points and a 9-H Stanford lead,
j Cal drove back upfield after
! ihe kickoff and was finally held
on a fourth down on the Card 20.
The Indians netted minus Iwo
i yards in three plays, kicked out
! and were hard pressed to hold
j back a Bear drive as the quarter
ended with Conklin intercepting
j a Kapp aerial* •
Hart and Crow led Ihe Cal
I I'D drive two thirds ol Ihe way
| through chapter three with llarl
again piling over from the one
for Ihe score. This time Wayne
{ Crow grabbed a Kapp pass for the
two extras.
Cal Try Misses
Both clubs exchanged down sc

! Cal put fear into Stanford hearts
I as the final 1.1 minutes stal led,
j The Gold and Blue drove to a first
down on the Card 21, lost 12

apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
Dowd were not ungreat. Dick
gathered in 33 of tin* Indians' 71
rushing yards; Dowd brought
home 22 of them.
Star < enters
The linemen they were tops,
too, even though there were times
when they missed blocks and
tackles like they have all season.
There were centers who stood out
today. lioch Conklin and Doug
Bursell were again standouts for
the Indians. Conklin played a
heads-up game which was high
lighted by his interception of a
Joe Kapp pass as the first half
ended with what looked like it
might have been a California
score.
Pursell, always a tiger on de
fense, and not a kitten on offense,
either, saw his share of mix it-up
plays. Then there were two sec
ond unit men on the left side of
the line who got their letters to
day if they hadn't already.
Guard Ron Fernandes saved
the Indians from a fumbling dis
grace when he hauled in a Dick
Bowers bobble, then got the In
dians rolling to their first touch
down when he recovered a Cal
bobble late in the first stanza.
For once, I hough, Stanford was
n't outplayed down the line of
statistics. The Cards came
through in many areas. Rushing,
though, where the Bears outdid
them 213 lo 71 yards, was not one
of rhedi.
And the big man in the Bear
rushing attack was halfback Jack
Hart. lie piled up 103 yards n
22 plays for a very healthy 4.02
average. Second - unit halfback
Wayne Crow gathered in 10 yards
in eight tries for a 7.0 average.
Kapp Not Best
Quarterback Joe Kapp, highly
touted for All-American honors,
evidently wasn't his old self today
because lie looked slightly short
of great in directing ihe Golden
animals to their close one.
Kapp does do a good job of
directing the unattractive split-T
offense, but he just didn't do a
good job of directing himself to
day. Kapp ran for a meager 42
yards and completed four passes
in ten for a little more healthy IN
markers. But this wasn't the Kapp
most of us expected to see.
The scoring in the (list thriller
wcnl this way:
After Stanford took the kickoff
back to its own 33 and set the
tans to talking when Bob Nicole)
uncorked a 40 • yard - plus pass
which got beyond Freis on the
('n,l 30, the Bears ground the first
(lard offensive showing to a halt.
Taking over on their own 3.1,
the Golden ones were surprised to
get only six yards in three tries.
Maybe not as surprised as the In
dians were to get only six in the
next down series, though.

Starting on their 3H, the Bears
drove 02 yards in nine plays
which continually clipped off
j yardage up the middle. I la it
picked up the six points with a
dive over right guard from the
lone. Halfback Grover Garvin-got
I by two Stanford defenders to
; make it H O, Hears.
Determined Indians
Stanford then started a deter
mined drive, which at times
looked as though the Indians
were trying too hard, on its 37.
Norman directed the team to the
California 38 before halfback
Steve Bales intercepted an aerial
on the 2!) and ran it to the 39.
Three plays and seven Cal
yards later Fernandes recovered
Barque's fumble and the Cards
were off and running.
From the Cal 42 Bond flipped
the double reverse pass to Nikolai
on the Blue and Gold three; Skip
Face took a pitchout around right
end to score the six then disap
pointment number one came up
on the conversion try. The first
quarter had three minutes to go.
Cal ran and passed to two first
downs in bridging the g;ip be
tween ij u a r t e r s before being
forced to punt out from midfield.
Bond relumed for the (.lards to
their 22.
Drive Stopped
With Nieolel ihe field general
the Indians bowled down to a first
and ten on the Cal 13 in a drive
which was highlighted by .11
yards of pass completion.
Fullback Dick carried to the
eight; Nieolel came close on a
pass to Bond but it was beyond
the halfback's fingertips. Cal
guard Bete Dornoto threw Dick
j for a loss of one. On the fourth
and six situation at the Cal nine,
Face split the uprights for three
points and a 9-H Stanford lead,
j Cal drove back upfield after
! ihe kickoff and was finally held
on a fourth down on the Card 20.
The Indians netted minus Iwo
i yards in three plays, kicked out
! and were hard pressed to hold
j back a Bear drive as the quarter
ended with Conklin intercepting
j a Kapp aerial* •
Hart and Crow led Ihe Cal
I I'D drive two thirds ol Ihe way
| through chapter three with llarl
again piling over from the one
for Ihe score. This time Wayne
{ Crow grabbed a Kapp pass for the
two extras.
Cal Try Misses
Both clubs exchanged down sc
ries to finish out the quarter and
! Cal put fear into Stanford hearts
I as the final 1.1 minutes stal led,
j The Gold and Blue drove to a first
down on the Card 21, lost 12
I yards, then gained 14 and were on
I the I!) with a fourth and eight,
j Here Tony Benin tried a field
goal which missed.
Stanford had a chance and Nor
[ man directed the club to a third
land two situation on the Bears'

20. Two passes went incomplete.
Cal took over with time run
ning out. Held to a l'oinih down
deep in their own territory, the
Californians punted out. A pen
alty and a seven-yard loss on the
first play from scrimmage found
the Stanfords with a second and
17 (iii their own 1.1 with three min
utes to go. Norman passed like
;i madman and brought the Cards
to the Cal 21, first and ten. A
pass to Bowers got away from
the fullback; then Freis was in
the end zone with tlieTl) pass-on
the next play.
Hit;' Came (Jimax
The story from here is dramat
ic, a lilting one for a Big Game.
They didn't make t hat conversion,
that brand new two-point conver
sion rule I hat maybe Jack Cur
lice wishes he hadn't voted for in
the rules committee meeting
now; but then, too, he could have
won on it.
Stanford got 1(1 first downs, ihe
Bears had 1!). Cardinals dominat

led the passing statistics, 279 to
fjS yards. Cal got off HI offensive

| There was only one penalty
j marched of 112, a 15-yarder against

Cards' Larry Lueey (07) nears third point ol three-point landing
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley, Nov. 22 By tho very slim mar
Kios of no more than a yard and a half either time, California's
Golden Bears picked up an old red and white Axe and quite a few
tickets to the 1959 Rose Bowl game when they beat Stanford's In
dians 16-15 here today.
The 81,490 fans who crowded their way into Memorial Stadium left

with almost unanimous agree
ment that this was darned near,
if not THE most exciting Big
Game in the classic's 61 renewals.
Both those slim margins were
what held Stanford from adding
two - point conversions to the
touchdowns the Indians scored
here today. They were conver
sions which, if either had boon
good, would have, given the up
start Palo Allans glorious victory
over the Californians. But neither
one was good by the very slim
margins of no more than a yard
and a half.
The first of them came with
three minutes left in the opening
quarter. Stanford had scored to
come within two points of the
Bears, 8-6. Indian quarterback
Dick Norman rolled out to heave
for the two-pointer. He spotted
end ' Chris Burford in the end
zone.
Nikolai Appears
Burford bubbled the ball and
things were looking black, but
another Card end. Irv Nikolai,
was close by. and things were all
of a sudden much brighter. Niko
lai stretched and got hold of the
ball, but he was dangerously close
to the end zone line. Nikolai held
onto the pigskin as lie went out of
the end /.one but it was now a
matter of judgment.
That judgment was to come
from ba'k judge William Simas
and he ruled that Nikolai was out
of bounds.
The second margin of defeat
or victory, depending upon which
rooting section you watched the
game from came in the heart-iti
the-mouth final minute and one
half of the game. Again the In
dians came from behind. The
score a few seconds earlier had
been 16-9, California. Then the
cheering, foot-stamping fans were
wild as the Indians, on a 21-yard
pass from Norman to end Joel
Freis in the end zone, made it 16-
15. Here, if ever, was the chance
for 4 the Cardinals to be great.
They were, too, but for a yard and
a half.
"Go for It"
To a man, the players on the
Stanford bench and the partisans
in the rooting section held up two
fingers. "Go for the win!"
Norman called for halfback
Skip Face to circle his own right
end for the two • pointer. Face
took off, circled wide, got by a
couple of California defenders,
but met up with too much when
Bear fullback Bill Patton got to
him no more than a yard and a
half from glory.
For sure it was a sad day for
the Indians but they were never
belter all season. Today, in fact,
they were great.
The quarterbacks were great.
Both Norman and Bob Nicolef
were at home in the air today.
Norrnan completed 13 passes in
22 tries for 1.10 yards. The long
est of these was Ihe spectacular
22-yarder to Freis which put the
Indians oh so very close. Norman
engineered both Indian touch
down drives.
Nieolet hit nine out of If) passes
and gained M 3 yards. The senior
played a fine offensive and de
fensive game.
(•real Halfbacks
The halfbacks were great, too.
John Bond pulled in five passes,
and threw a pretty spectacular
one off a double reverse play
you can read about elsewhere in
these pages. Rick M i Mil Ie n
caught three and Skip face
caught two, ran for 22 yards and
booted a field goal which was' a
beauty from the 1(1 yard line.
Those ends they were great.
Nikolai, Burfonl and freis all
contributed with four completions
apiece, most of them spectacular
catches maybe because il was
the Big Came, (hough most of
them would have looked good any
other place.
fullbacks Doug Dick and Cil
