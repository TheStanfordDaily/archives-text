# JUST AT CAL
## Card Fans Bitter—But No Trouble 
### Bob Payne 
There have been heart t>ro;il;
ing defeats iti Stanford history,
but this one ranks right in there.
No tears in Ihe Stanford root
ing section . . . iust bitterness to
ward a California team that was
beaten in everything but Mir*
score, and toward a California
cheering section that paraded
across the field with cynical grins
that suggested it had been a run
away.
But the exchange of fire be
tween sections apples, oranges
and some very, very breakable
eggs was milder I hah usual. Be
cause everybody was too limp to
indulge in much aeronautical
warfare.
Return Favor
During the game the Battle of
Wits between sections was a bit
more subdued, also. This was be
cause there was a real, real fool

« ball game going
s on and there
wasn't time for
anything more
than the stock
football yells.
1 They were ade
| quate.
I Dick Stanford
called op the
Axe Yell three
times. Twice it
produced score. l ;.
Cal also used the

Stanford Axe Yell, but we had i'
first, and we do it better.
And leave it to the frosh to stop
the show. After Stanford's first
period touchdown, they let loose
a flock of red pigeons which pro
ceeded to make the rounds of the
Stadium. They buzzed the Blue
and Gold characters on the Sta
dium floor and turned in perform
ances that would make the Air
Force's pet falcon sit up and take
notice.
Just Second Best
Cal's team wasn't overrated; it
was just second best. But Cal's
band was overrated. World's Fair
and all. the Bear Bandsmen were
certainly no better than the Cards
today and a real upset may have
been scored at halftime.
The six original compositions
were nice, but a football field
where the color of the old stand
ards is in fullest glory is no
place for introducing a new musi
cal.
