"And then wc went to Vanessi's . .
The hand and Prince Lightfoot had visited the last alumni rally,
danced at the Top of the Mark . . . were about done in Friday niglii
So off they went to North Beach where they thought they wouldn't
run into any Cal students or other trouble.

At Vanessi's Light fool sat calm
ly relaxing, headdress flowing to
the floor. Suddenly he was bare
headed.
Before the eyes of stunned
bandsmen, director Julius Shu
chat and Lightfoot a large young
man with headdress in hand ran
through the door and .jumped into
a waiting car which immediately
scooted through a light before it
turned red.
Cone was over $100 worth of
material, three months of woi k
and something worth much senti
mental value.
Tim droVe to Fairfax Friday
night to pick up an old headdress
to wear at the game Saturday.
He had partially dismantled it in
preparation to throwing it away
so he had to put the beads and
other trimming back on it.
But the band's trip to the city
was not all sad. One of the two
groups visiting alumni rallies vis
ited the Merchandising Mart and
whom did they run into but the
Cal band . . . which was making
merry at its own private bar. Re
lations between the two bands got
progressively better as the Cal
bandsmen furnished "refresh
ment" for their contemporaries
from Stanford.
Despite the absence of an offi
cial City rally, there were plenty
of Stanford students who fol
lowed the band around to the var
ious rallies and alumni functions.
Cal was also represented in San

Francisco, and had enough sin
dents at Union Square around 11
p.m. to hold an unofficial rally.
Tt turned into primarily a half
hour of hooting "Take off that
red this-or-that" at passing Stan
ford supporters.
