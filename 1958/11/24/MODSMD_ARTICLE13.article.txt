Wf. WF.HK PI.F.ASEO TO SEE, :i lew weeks ago, lhal the IMla ( .hi
fraternity and tl»e International (dub gave all-campus dances
i.ue things around this campus during fall quarter.
We were disappointed, 011 reading about (iaTs all-campus part s
after its Kriday Big t.ame rally, to note that had 110 such
»'V»-ni planned aftei ihe Bonfire. Alter a great deal <.112 discussion
recently about having a big rally here the night before Big <»anie,
jj seemed to us that the Bonfire would he down to ashes and all
the good children could have been in bed by 10 p.m. I here wa;
no Stanford party after p.m.
All ilits just sowed to confirm an idea that has been
in inn heads fi)i quite a while. Stanford simply do*-s not
have many all-ram pus dunces whether they he centered
around u special event like Hig dame or purely foi a
good time.
I o etudenio in organizations with well-organi/.ed social pro
grams this may not .seem a tailing. Bui lor I rosh men, l«>r the
great number of off-cam pun men and for member* ol the not-so
socially-oriented organizations, all-campus dances held right here
at Stanfonl lill extremely well ;i hole in the entert.iinment pro
gram.
I .xcept foi the |{e«i; I lances, there are no all-eampns dances
until the fraternities start giving theirs in ihe spring. We have
two suggestions:
(I) A SSI J organiz'iiions could well support dancing
parties foi all oj Sum hud around the time oj irnpot tunl
I licit asity events I i.e.. Homecoming, liig dame. ( onviv
lescent Home).
IJJ I vaternities and clubs could give theii panics hi
the autumn and u inter as well as in spring.
The complication here, at present, is rushing. Mo I'rosh men
are allowed in fraternities or clubs until alter rushing and that
conies in the spring. In lime, rushing is expected to come during
ihe sophomore year.
II e en lively support the theory of delayed rushing,
but we feel it has an unfortunate repercussion here, in
that it inhibits the fraternities and clubs from giving all
ium pus dances. 1 hey cannot be all-cam pus; frosh men
must be excluded.
A rash of fraternity all-campus parties (free of charge, too, we
note) take place, once the rushing complication has been elimi
nated. We feel that the amount of so-called "dirty rushing" which
might go 011 in the midst of a dance attended bv 400-plus people
would be so small that it should not he a reason lor preventing
these all-campus dances from being held.
Summing up: First, we recommend to Interfraternity < ouncil
that they reconsider their "no-freshmen-in-the house rule in re
ppect to all-campus dances.
Second, we recommend that ASST.! organizations con-ider giv
ing all-campus dances in support of special events.
