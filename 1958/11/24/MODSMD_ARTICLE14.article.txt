# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## Fine Show Seen In Cal Stadium 
### 
It's over and again comes the
traditional cry, "Wail till Next
Year."
There is no doubt as to there
suit ot the game itself, and the
reaction ot the stands to that re
sult. The stunned silence at the
missed conversion of the final
Stanford touchdown, followed Iry
the spirited applause for I lie
team, is testimony to the appreci
ation of the rooters for a game
well played.
The conduct of the stands at
Piig Game leads us to wonder
more strongly about the possibil
ity of mixed rooting sections.
Courteous yet spirited were the
rooters, more so than at most
games where we have segregated
sections. We were proud to be
associated with Stanford from
Hie performance ot its team on
the field to the conduct of (lie
rooters.
Today at 5 p.m. the ASSU
( abinet will meet and one of
the topies for discussion will be
Nig Game Week. How can Big
(*ame Week be made more ef
fective? What efforts can be
made to interest students who
are on the borderline as far as
interest goes?
Among l he suggestions being
considered by individuals on the
Cabinet are the possibilities of an
all campus dance and a Big Came
eo-ordlnator who would be a cen
tral clearing house for all activi
ties during the week. Such a co
ordinator would not have plan
ning responsibilities but would
see to it that the plans are well
organized by the various groups
participating and avoid conflicts
which occur when "one hand
doesn't know what the other hand
is doing."
One question brought to our
attention this week is The Dai
ly's policy of "anonymous" edl
tornals. Why aren't they signed
as is fbe practice in some news
papers?
There are several reasons for'
this policy. The eight members

of the Daily Ediorial Board are
entitled to write editorials (the
editor, managing editor, three as
sociates, staff, photo and sports
editor), but the editor is still re
sponsible for what is said. While
there may be differences in style
or even shades of disagreement
with what is said, there must be
a basic agreement between the
editoi and the writer ol an edito
rial before that editorial is print
ed.
it is standard newspaper pol
icy to direct questions or criti
cisms to tin- editor; hence the
editor must 1»h prepared to »*\-
pluin Hip editorial stand and
must agree m essence with the
editorial.
An editorial column should not
develop into a forum where one
student may voice his opinion :it
will. We provide the"Letters"
column for our readers to do this
and ask thai they sign their let
ters. But the editorials must re
fleet more than one opinion in
order to be reprtsentative ol a
campus newspaper. II is not de
sirable in a newspaper to insti
title a policy where a writer can
get away with anything he
wishes lo say merely by signing
his work. True, it is a small group
whose opinion is reflected, but
there is a basis on which to voice
this opinion as representative of
more than one person and thus,
reflective ol Hie official policy ot
the publication.
Added note only so many
words can be squeezed into a col
urnn of type and a certain num
ber of ads inusl be run in each
paper so that we can meet our
operating expenses. This is why
"Letters" are not always printed
immediately after we receive
them. However, we will print all
signed letters eventually and the
leader will find in today's paper
a number of letters written prior
to the Big Game which carry
thought, though by now not too
timely, still worth considering.
