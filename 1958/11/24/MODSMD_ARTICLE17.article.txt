Avoid Conflicts
I'jlitor, The Daily:
In his revi<nv of Victorien Sar
â€¢ ion's "Let's (Jet a Divorce" (The
Daily, Nov. lit, Mr. Kerrel refers
lo itie "regrettable competitive
scheduling of other interesting
events" as one of the possible
causes for the sparse attendance
of i lie production.
As sponsor of the interesting
event which most directly com
peied with Sardou, Sequoia wish
es to express its wholehearied
agreement with Mr. Kerrel. We
I eel that the scheduling of two
such vital and significant dramat
ic performances for the same eve
ning was indeed regrettable.

We would have been quite will
ing to select another date for Dr.
Bailey's reading had we been in
formed when we scheduled ii that
another such event was planned,
and we would have relinquished
the date when we did discover il
if our publicity had not already
gone out. Many of us would glad
ly have attended both perform
ances, if il had been possible to
do so.
We hope that in Ihe future the
Commit lee for Public Exercises
will exert its prerogative and co
ordinate such performances rath
er than allow them to conflict.
