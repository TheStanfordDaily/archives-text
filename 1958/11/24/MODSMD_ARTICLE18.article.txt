have hep 11 attending Stanford
football games. In that time I
have had the opportunity of see

some who were less fortunate,

great numbers of Stanford root

women's section, left the game

to me that if members of I he stu
dent body are not sufficiently in
terested in I heir team to support
the boys, win or lose, lo the end
of ihe game, they should slay
away from Ihe stadium and not
present ihe appearance of lack of
interest to ihe public. I doubt
that Ihey would have lefl had
Stanford been ahead on ihe score

In the days of yore when Stan
ford graduates were all going to
he millionaires, arid Indian-fight
ers, and openers of Ihe Colden
West, and so on, there was some
point to football rivalry as a meas
urement of the fighting spirit of
the rival college students, before
they were pilted against Wall
Street and Silting Hull.
And if we gel into a long global
war in Ihe future, there may
again he some point to rivalry
about the winning spirit of differ

ent colleges, though competitive
military maneuvers will probably
be a more appropriate test; stu
dent spirit could be whipped up
along more realistic, ideological
lines than ii is at present.
Kven in high schools, ;ii ihe
present lime, there is sonic con
nection between football games
and ihe rest of life; there is usu
ally one high school per coinmn

is no great incentive to he inter

of a university is to turn out a

In the days of yore when Stan
ford graduates were all going to
he millionaires, arid Indian-fight
ers, and openers of Ihe Colden
West, and so on, there was some
point to football rivalry as a meas
urement of the fighting spirit of
the rival college students, before
they were pilted against Wall
Street and Silting Hull.
And if we gel into a long global
war in Ihe future, there may
again he some point to rivalry
about the winning spirit of differ

ent colleges, though competitive
military maneuvers will probably
be a more appropriate test; stu
dent spirit could be whipped up
along more realistic, ideological
lines than ii is at present.
Kven in high schools, ;ii ihe
present lime, there is sonic con
nection between football games
and ihe rest of life; there is usu
ally one high school per coinmn
niiy so football games can repre
sent community ri v a I ry, and
everyone in town unit: mil im

ftul in present day colleges there
is no great incentive to he inter
ested in football, as we* are uol
going to Ik* Indiaii lighters or

football exploitation. The purpose
of a university is to turn out a
