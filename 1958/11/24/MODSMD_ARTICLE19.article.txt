# Versatile Bond Big Man In Tribe's Great Effort
## 
### John Schwarz 
II was no surprise to many Stanford followers to see flanker hack
John Bond get off a spectacular 39-yard pass to Irv IYikolai to set up
Stanford's first touchdown in the first quarter of Saturday's i!ig
Game.
Bond, one of the Indians' most versatile men, came to Stanford two

years ago after a successful ca
reer as a tailback at CantwcMl
Hip:h School in Montehello. As a j
freshman Bond was used at half
hack and as stop-gap quarterback !
behind starter Sid Garber.
Playing quarterback, Bond
showed fine passing ability but
when he moved up to varsity
which was already loaded with
quarterbacks, he was moved back
to halfback, and later to fullback.
Little Action
Bond didn't see a great deal of
offensive duty last year but start
ing this season he found himself
one of only five lettcrman run
ning backs.
Starting out at fullback, Bond [
was quickly shifter! to the flanker
back spot in Coach Jack Curtice's
wide open passing attack. He has
split the duties here with Dick
Bowers throughout the season.
The pass play itself which was
so important to Stanford's first
touchdown is what Curtice calls
his double reverse pass. Quarter
back Dick Norman received the
pass from center, tinned, and
handed off to halfback Skip Face
coming across from his left half
back spot. Face started running
toward the right end but handed
off to Bond coming the other way
from his flanker spot.
Nikolai Grabs
Bond took the handoff, moved
a few more yards to his left and
let go. The pass was a little bit i
short, bul end Irv Nikolai had j
time to turn around and make a
chest-high grab of the floating!
ball on the California three-yard
line. '

From there n look the Cards
only one play to carry the hall
into Ihe end zone and give Stan
ford its initial score.
Later Bond returned to the
Ramp to give the Bears a lot more
trouble, but this time on the re
ceiving end of passes.
Spectacular < 'alclirs
One particular snare that Bond
made seemed almost impossible,
ft came midway through the
fourth quarter when Stanford
was driving to gel hack in the
game with time running out on
them.
The pass was a high Dick Nor
man aerial which the rangy quar
terback let fling from the vicinity
of the Stanford 10-yard line. Bond
battled with two Cal defenders on
the Cal 34, bobblcd the ball
through the air for a few seconds,
'and then hauled il away from the
two Californians while managing
to tight rope along the sideline
stripe.

JW-yard play set up first TD
II was no surprise to many Stanford followers to see flanker hack
John Bond get off a spectacular 39-yard pass to Irv IYikolai to set up
Stanford's first touchdown in the first quarter of Saturday's i!ig
Game.
Bond, one of the Indians' most versatile men, came to Stanford two

years ago after a successful ca
reer as a tailback at CantwcMl
Hip:h School in Montehello. As a j
freshman Bond was used at half
hack and as stop-gap quarterback !
behind starter Sid Garber.
Playing quarterback, Bond
showed fine passing ability but
when he moved up to varsity
which was already loaded with
quarterbacks, he was moved back
to halfback, and later to fullback.
Little Action
Bond didn't see a great deal of
offensive duty last year but start
ing this season he found himself
one of only five lettcrman run
ning backs.
Starting out at fullback, Bond [
was quickly shifter! to the flanker
back spot in Coach Jack Curtice's
wide open passing attack. He has
split the duties here with Dick
Bowers throughout the season.
The pass play itself which was
so important to Stanford's first
touchdown is what Curtice calls
his double reverse pass. Quarter
back Dick Norman received the
pass from center, tinned, and
handed off to halfback Skip Face
coming across from his left half
back spot. Face started running
toward the right end but handed
off to Bond coming the other way
from his flanker spot.
Nikolai Grabs
Bond took the handoff, moved
a few more yards to his left and
let go. The pass was a little bit i
short, bul end Irv Nikolai had j
time to turn around and make a
chest-high grab of the floating!
ball on the California three-yard
line. '

From there n look the Cards
only one play to carry the hall
into Ihe end zone and give Stan
ford its initial score.
Later Bond returned to the
Ramp to give the Bears a lot more
trouble, but this time on the re
ceiving end of passes.
Spectacular < 'alclirs
One particular snare that Bond
made seemed almost impossible,
ft came midway through the
fourth quarter when Stanford
was driving to gel hack in the
game with time running out on
them.
The pass was a high Dick Nor
man aerial which the rangy quar
terback let fling from the vicinity
of the Stanford 10-yard line. Bond
battled with two Cal defenders on
the Cal 34, bobblcd the ball
through the air for a few seconds,
'and then hauled il away from the
two Californians while managing
to tight rope along the sideline
stripe.
