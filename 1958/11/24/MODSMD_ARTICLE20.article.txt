# PCC Has Big Last Day; But Big Game Was Best

And so the I'CC died. With a
flourish.
Foil i' games and three cliff
hangers; bill, while Southern Cal*
UCLA and Washington-Washing
lon State couldn't have been much
closer, anything else that happen
ed in the Pacific Coast Conference
Saturday was a poor second to
the Stanford-Cal !>ig Came.
Final results of these last-gasp
conference games were: USC 15.
UCLA 15; WSC IS, Washington
I I; and <)regon 20, < Jregon Slate 0.
California aiso beat Stanford,
16 15.
OSC, the only team to defeat
Cal in conference action, finally
had its faniastic home - ground
winning streak snapped . . . and
most unkindly . . . by Oregon. The
Beavers were never in it as they
saw their last, fleeting hopes for
the Hose Bowl go down.
For the first time in weeks,
Oregon was able to generate some
sort of offense as the Ducks
ground out 251 yards on the
ground; A fullback who has gone
rather unnoticed most of the sea
son, Dave Powell, was the big
man in the Webfool ground game,
scoring two touchdowns.
While the offense was finally

in high near, the Oregon defense
has never been belter. OSC could
manage only H7 yards rushing.
For Beaver passers it was just
one of those days. Ten tries, ten
misses and, naturally, nil yards.
In Spokane, WSC had to come
from behind to top a determined
Washington team. The Cougars
recovered two Husky fumbles in
scoring-territory in the first pe
riod and scored in two plays.
After the first recovery, by
tackle Myke Lindsay, quarterback
i)avc Wilson rifled a 13-yard pass
to Don Ellersick for the score.
Minutes later it was Lindsay
again with a recovery, and this
time Ted Cano scooted 27 yards
to pay-dirt.
But that was where the poten
tial rout ended, and the Huskies
engineered by quarterback Bob
Ilivner, drove for two touchdowns
and two George Fleming 1-point
conversions for a 14-12 half-time
margin. #
The Cougars came back to pick
up the winning touchdown in the
third quarter, and a 7-yard Wil
son - to - Ellersick strike was the
ticket.
WSC was left all alone in the
PCC's second -spot and marie it
well known, following the game.

that they were ready to play in
anybody's bowl game.
And flown south, USC and
UCLA celebrated the end of the
PCC with a nice, friendly 1.1-1."3
tie. Only 58,507 Angelinos saw fit
to turn out to watch their two
Big Time children.
All the scoring came in the sec
ond half, and it was exciting. Aft
er UCLA had taken an >S-7 lead in
the third period, the Bruins ap
peared to have elinched it in the
waning minutes when their jet
propelled end John Brown broke
through to intercept an errant
Trojan pitch-out and fly 45 yards
to score. Jim Stcffen's kick made
it 15-7.
But on the ensuing kick-off,
SC's Luther Hayes tore 74 yards
to score, and quarterback Tom
Maudlin struggled 2 yards for the
tieing two-point conversion. And
that was that.

OSC, the only team to defeat

Beavers were never in it as they

the Hose Bowl go down.
For the first time in weeks,
Oregon was able to generate some
sort of offense as the Ducks
ground out 251 yards on the

rather unnoticed most of the sea
son, Dave Powell, was the big
man in the Webfool ground game,
scoring two touchdowns.
While the offense was finally

in high near, the Oregon defense
has never been belter. OSC could
manage only H7 yards rushing.
For Beaver passers it was just
one of those days. Ten tries, ten
misses and, naturally, nil yards.
In Spokane, WSC had to come
from behind to top a determined
Washington team. The Cougars
recovered two Husky fumbles in
scoring-territory in the first pe

After the first recovery, by
tackle Myke Lindsay, quarterback

Minutes later it was Lindsay
again with a recovery, and this
