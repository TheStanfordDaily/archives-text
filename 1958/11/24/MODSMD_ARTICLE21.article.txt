# THE 						INK BOWL
## Naturallyâ€”Daily Wins 
### 
KLEEBERGER FIELD, Berke
ley, Nov. 22 Ii was a glorious
<lay for the men of The Stanford
Daily today as ihey crushed the
rugged journalists (?) of The
Daily Californian, I'} 7, to retain
for anotiier year Hie coveted Ink
Bowl pri/e.
In a game llial some!iines look
ed to be touch football in name
only, the brilliant Farm scribes
.siruck for the winning touchdown
lale in the second half, and time
ended Ihe proceedings just when
Stanford was really beginning to
roll. Which all went to save a
most humiliating defeat for the
I {erkeleys.
Cal began its attempts to si rat
e;;ize itself to victory before the
came had ( j ven started, when offi

cials forced Stanford to make con
siderable concessions to some hi
larious intramural rules which
seem to be the big thing at Berke
ley.
Bill the Slanfords were equal to
the task. With tailback Jan N.
Slypula <N. for Norman, Nicolel,
or Newman) spearheading the at
tack, it became a very onesided
game.
The Big Red defense was nearly
impenetrable, except for the Cal
scoring play. Thai came on, of all
tilings, a line smash, and the Bear
tailback was touched by every
Card en route to his score. But,
after all, the bewildered si ripe
shirts were Californians, and it all
made for a more interesting game.
Slypula passed to Dave (Sam)
Dow for a first half score and ran
over the extra point. In the sec
ond half he fired a strike to Ray
< Spid e r) Ila rrington for Ihe
clincher.
Harrington's defensive play was
the highlight of I lie morning, and
he left, numerous Californians
swearing Ihey would never again
participate in the Ink Bowl.
Directing all of this was coach
captain-full hack-what haveyou Roy
Dawson.
