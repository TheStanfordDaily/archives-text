Dorothy and I are both so pleased
that, you used your Jewelßuse and
JUnuelSeal so conscientiously-and,
needless to say, that your nails are
getting prettier every day! Now
we're both clucking over you like
mother hens!
I have a confession to make, in
spired by your gratitude: I always
thought my beautiful nails were
due to my own ingenuity and nat
ural endowments . . . but Dorothy
took me down a peg or two when
she told me she's been using
Juliette Marglen's Jewelßase and
JeivelSeul on them for years! No
wonder I keep a manicure lovely
so long in spite of, alas, dishes
every day!
Dorothy showed me another
Juliette Marglen treasure today
it's called Silver Seal and I'm sure
it was made to order for you! It's
a really magical product that is
exactly the same formula as Jewel-
it's silverescent! You wear
it over any colour, to "silver" as well
as "seal" it. Dorothy says it's abso
lutely delicious mixed with colour
— sort of like a pastel icing —how
you'll loVe that! But pretty as it is,
the main point is that it's marvel
cus protection for your nails . .
Relax . . . I've already sent you
two bottles ot Silvei Seal (two, be
cause I know you girls will be ex
perimenting halt the night with
it). have fun. dear ... I can hardly
wait to see your glamorous new
Juliette Marglen fingertips! Love
from us ail.


Daughter dear-
