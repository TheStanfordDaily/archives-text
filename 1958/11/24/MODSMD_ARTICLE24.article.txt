# Those Darn Conversions Again
## 
### Dick Barnes 
Conversions haunted Stanford
before the two-point rule and
now they haunt it still.
Two conversion attempts that
went awry made the difference in
the 61st Big Came and were the
principal topic of post battle talk
in the Stanford locker room.
There was that second extra
points try the one where Skip
Pace was hailed four feel shy of
the goal line, and the one which
deprived the Cants of a 17 lti vic
tory over ('alifornia.
And there was Stanford's first
PAT attempt the pass that Back
Judge William Simas ruled incom
plete on the grounds that Irv Nik
olai had fallen out of the end zone
before gaining complete posses
sion or an aerial which had been
reflected hy Chris Burton!.
Different Reactions
Reaction to each of the two
misf ires was totally ditl'erent. I lad
Stanford had the opportunity to
replay lhai conversion in the final
hectic minute and a hall', there is
no doubt the Indians would have
played it the same way.
The decision lacing the Cards
was a simple one lei Face place
kick and go for the IG-Hi tie, or
go lor the two points and take
the victory or defeat.
Stanford fans had no doubts
about which course lo follow
they all held up I wo fingers as
soon as Joel Freis caught the
touchdown pass.
The team d i d n't have any

doubts they all threw up the
sign to go for two.
And head coach Jack Curtice
didn't have any doubts, either he
didn't send in the kicking tee.
Just as Sure
Even after the game Curtice
was just as sure about his deci
sion to go for broke.
"Mow can you decide not to go
for two?" lie exclaimed. "It takes
a pretty gutless individual to go
for a lie in a situation like that.
And 1 wasn't raised thai way."
Quarterback Dick Norman was
glad the Indians went for two.
Regarding the particular play call
ed a wide sweep to the right by
halfback Face Norman said: "II
was the first play I thought of.
"Then I considered a few more,
hut decided lo call it. They were
starting to defense for the passes,
and 1 didn't want lit drop back to
throw." 112
And so there weren't any re
grets over the second PAT ex
ccpi thai il didn't work.
A Different Story
But the pass to Nikolai by way
of Burford that was a different
story.
For a while after the game no
one was sure just why the pass
had been ruled no good.
Some figured Simas had ruled
that Nikolai was out of Ihe end
/one. Others thought Simas had
incorrectly invoked a pro loot hall
rule which slates that a pass is in
complete il' caught hy an eligible
receiver alter having been deflect
ed hy another offensive player.
A half • hour late r assistant
coach Andy Everest reported back
from a talk with Simas and said
the back judge had ruled that
Nikolai was standing on the rear
end zone stripe even when initial
ly touching the ball.
Irv's Story
Nikolai's version was this: "I
was two yards in when I caught
the ball, then went to both knees
on purpose so they'd see I had
possession and was in bounds.
"Then the ref said, 'No good.'
I ran up to him and said, 'What's
wrong?' lie wouldn't say and just
stal led running upfield."
Consensus in the press box at
Ihe time of the play was that
Stanford had scored the Iwo
points. And teammates of Nikolai
who were closest to the play
agreed.

As is always the case in a dis-i
pute of this nature, there arose a
call to look at the films.
The first chance to do this came '
Saturday evening w hen television i
station K'l VII showed the game in I
its entirety via video tape. And
after looking at Ibis showing, it's i
apparent that the films will never
prove anything one wa\ oi the
other.
They showed Nikolai lo be with
in the end zone when he first
grasped for Ihe ball. Then he goes
to his knees while reeling il in,
but comes to re :i outside of'the
end /.One
Nothing Could Be Done
Tints, Ihe ruling becomes one
of judgment only was he in con
troJ of the ball before falling out
of bounds, or after?
It's probably jusl as well ihul
nothing can be proven to have
been wrong about Ihe call The

score certainly couldn't I»«* chang
ed, and no other soil ol' positive
result could occur.
Regardless of the outcome of
the collisions, Stanford could
have room for nothing hut pride
over Its showing against the Rose
Bowl-hound Bears
The lli point odds meant noth
ing to the Tribe it played the
Hoars on even terms all llie way
and even wound up with a small
edge in total offense.
So it was no surprise to hear
Curtice praising every one of his
men Ini the excellent |oh they did.
There was no point in singling
oid individuals, a I I ho u g It the
names of such as Burford, Nico
le! , Norman and Face came np
i for lots of mention But there
wasn't a man who didn't perform
well. And it added up to a team
thai performed far better than
most expected.
