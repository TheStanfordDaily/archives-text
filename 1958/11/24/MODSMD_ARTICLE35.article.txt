I know how busy you arc—studying, going to class, catching
night crawlers—but let me interrupt your multifarious activi
ties studying, going to class, helping old grads find tlieir
dentures after Homecoming—to remind you that busy as you
are -studying, going to class, searching for meat in the dormi
tory stew—time and tide wait for no man, and I he \ ulctide will
soon he upon us. Busy or not, we must turn our thoughts lo
Christmas shopping. Let us, therefore, pause for a moment in
our busy schedules—studying, going lo class, rolling drunks —
to examine a number of interesting gift suggestions.
We will start with tlie hardest gift problem of all: What do
you give to the person who has everything? Well sir, there fol
lows a list of a half dozen gifts which I will flatl}' guarantee the
person who has everything does not have:
1. A dentist's chair.
2. A low hurdle.
A street map of Perth.
Fifty pounds of chicken fat.
5. A carton of filter-tip Marllwros.
6. A carton of non-filler L'hilip Morris.
"What?" you exclaim, your young eyebrows rishig in wild
incredulity. "The person who has everything does not. have
Cartons of filter Marlboros and non-filter Philip Morris? you
shriek, your young lips curling mockingly. "What arrant non
sense!" you rasp, making a coarse gesture.
Ami I reply with an emphatic rio! The person who has every
thing does not have filter Marlboros and non-filter Philip Morris
— not for long anyhow —because if he has Marlboros and Philip
Morris and if he is a person who likes a mild, mellow, fresh,
flavorful cigarette—and who does not? eh? who does not? —
why, then he doesn't hare Marlboros and Philip Morris; he
smokes them, lie might, possibly have a large collection of
Marlboro and Philip Morris hulls, but whole Marlboros and
Philip Morris? No. An emphatic tio!
Now we take up another I horny gift problem: What do you
buy your girl if you arc broke? Quite a challenge, you will agree,
but there is an answer—an ingenious, exciting answer! Surprise
your girl with a beautiful bronze head of herself!

OVi, I know you're not a rculptor, but I lint Hoesn t matter. All
you have to Ho is endear yourself to your girl s r«»«mmttih♦ so
she will br willing lo do you a favor. Tlicn some night when
\onr girl is fa.it asleep, have the roommate butter your girl s
face —quietly, so as not to wake her and then quietly pour
plaster of Paris on top of the butter and then quietly wait till it
hardens and quietly lift, it off the liiitter will keep it from
sticking - and then bring you the mold, and you will |wmr bronze
in it and make a beautiful bust to Burprise your girl with!
Remember, it is important wry important to endear your
self to the roommate, because if anything should go wrong,
you don't want to be without a girl for the holiday season.

Morris and if he is a person who likes a mild, mellow, fresh,
flavorful cigarette—and who does not? eh? who does not? —
why, then he doesn't hare Marlboros and Philip Morris; he
smokes them, lie might, possibly have a large collection of
Marlboro and Philip Morris hulls, but whole Marlboros and
Philip Morris? No. An emphatic tio!
Now we take up another I horny gift problem: What do you
buy your girl if you arc broke? Quite a challenge, you will agree,
but there is an answer—an ingenious, exciting answer! Surprise
your girl with a beautiful bronze head of herself!

OVi, I know you're not a rculptor, but I lint Hoesn t matter. All
you have to Ho is endear yourself to your girl s r«»«mmttih♦ so
she will br willing lo do you a favor. Tlicn some night when
\onr girl is fa.it asleep, have the roommate butter your girl s
face —quietly, so as not to wake her and then quietly pour
plaster of Paris on top of the butter and then quietly wait till it
hardens and quietly lift, it off the liiitter will keep it from
sticking - and then bring you the mold, and you will |wmr bronze
in it and make a beautiful bust to Burprise your girl with!
Remember, it is important wry important to endear your

you don't want to be without a girl for the holiday season.
