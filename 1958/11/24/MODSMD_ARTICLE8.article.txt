### Diana Smith 
I: uggieio "Rieci presented violin music most distinguished for its
sensitive interpretation and pacing and only slightly less so for its
tonal finality, to an enthusiastic audience Sunday in Memorial Audi
lorium.
Highlighting the afternoon was a final group of pieces well suited

lo the arlist's emotional and musi
cal capacities. Rieci played fully
resonant "Roumanian Folk
Dances" by I lei a Bartok, Joseph
Achron's haunting "Hebrew Mel
ody" (1911), a dazzling "Dance
Ruskc" from "Petroushka" by
Igor Stravinsky, and a resilient
Maurice Ravel's "Tzigane."
Baroque Style
The violinist opened with "So
nata in D major," Rcspighi's
a d a p t a t i on of some Vivaldi
themes, demonstrating in his per
formance a full sense of the style
of the Baroque.
Beethoven's "Sonata in A ma
jor." Opus 12, No. 2, followed.
His "Allegro vivace" was a rhytlv
mic frolic with effective vibrato.
Exceptional purity of tone in the
upper registers might have been
better matched with richness in

I ho lower registers of the "Andan
te, pin foslo Allegretto." The no
bility of his final "Allegro place
vole" effectively hinted at the ma
ture Beethoven yet to come.
Stately Performance
Except for a very few wander
ing phrases, Ricci's "Chaconne
from the Partita in D minor" by
.1. S. Bach sustained the demand
ing bowing and fingering of its
polyphonic harmonies, for a deci
sive and stately performance.
His playing of Debussy's "So
nata in G minor" (1917) was a
suitably stirring rendition of this
organic culmination of the French
composer's violin music.
Accompanist Carl Furstner pro
vided a substantial, but happily
secondary complement to the so
loist.

upper registers might have been
better matched with richness in

I ho lower registers of the "Andan
te, pin foslo Allegretto." The no
bility of his final "Allegro place
vole" effectively hinted at the ma
ture Beethoven yet to come.
Stately Performance
Except for a very few wander
ing phrases, Ricci's "Chaconne
from the Partita in D minor" by
.1. S. Bach sustained the demand
ing bowing and fingering of its
polyphonic harmonies, for a deci
sive and stately performance.
His playing of Debussy's "So
nata in G minor" (1917) was a
suitably stirring rendition of this
organic culmination of the French
composer's violin music.
Accompanist Carl Furstner pro
vided a substantial, but happily
secondary complement to the so
loist.
