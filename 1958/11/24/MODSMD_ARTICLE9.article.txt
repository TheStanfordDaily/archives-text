### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
Investigation reports on Sj>eech
Activities and Student !' acuity
commissions were presented to
Legislature Thursday evening in
the first of what promises to lie
an informative series of studies
on ASSU organizations.
The recommendations in both
reports: more publicity to increase
interest in their activities.
"Communication seems to be
the congenital difficulty at Stan
ford," said ASSU president John
Bo h n in summarizing the two
statements.
The studies were initialed this
year to make a sincere evaluation
of ASSU organizations and to pre
sent recommendations for their
improvement.
Money Well Spent
In concluding their report on
Speech Activities, LASSU repre
sentatives Gary Brocmser and
John Nickerson wrote: "Although
the association requires a large
sum of money yearly, this money
is necessary and, on the whole,
quite well spent. The number of
participants is low, but the nu
cleus of the association appears
to be an active one."
They noted the association's
worth as a public relations me
dium and recommended that il
should try to widen interest in
speech activities through pub
licity and to take some of the
financial burden off the ASSU by
a fund-raising drive.
Four-Point IMnn
Patricia Popp and Isabel Shas
kan, in their report on Student-
Faculty Commission, suggested:
i Ii More publicity to make stu
dents aware of facilities available,

rather than mainly faculty inilia

licity improprieties. It also ap
