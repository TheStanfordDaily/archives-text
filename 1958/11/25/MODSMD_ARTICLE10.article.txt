move to drive the Western Big
Three out of the divided city.
Meanwhile in Berlin Western
e x p e r t s studied many with
grave doubts proposals to ram
armed convoys through any Com
rnunist blockade of West Berlin.
Talk of tank-led convoys and
armored trains is heard from
some Western officials in the
event of an East German block
ade of this isolated city.
Answer
II is one proposed answer if
as expected shortly the Soviet
Union transfers to East Germany
controls over Western lifelines to
West Berlin.
East Germany's transport min
ister, Erwin Kramer, put it blunt
ly in an article published by the
C o m m un is t youth newspaper
Junge Welt.
"West Berlin lies on the terri
tory of the DDR (East Germany)
and all Ira flic arteries—no mat
ter whethei they arc water, land
or air pass over the territory of
the DDR. That's how it is and
that's how it will remain."
Alternative Plhii
The West Germans are balking
at an alternative plan under study
by the United States, Britain and
France for accepting East Ger
man controls on a nonrecognition
basis.
In Bonn, West German Foreign
Office sources said the get-tough
idea is gaining ground among the
Western Allies. That's what the
West Germans want.
Some of the get-tough thinking
supposes thai East Germany and
the Soviet Union would back off
from armed Allied convoys rather
than clash with the West. But the
prospect that the Communists
might start shooting makes many
shudder.
.Military Problems
To understand why, it is only
necessary to look at the practical
military problems of running a
gauntlet to West Berlin, 100 miles
behind the Iron Curtain. The bulk
of supplies for Western garrisons
come in on a railroad from West
Germany. The military trains
under four power accords are
pulled into West Berlin from the
West German border by Commu
nist locomotives.
Armored trains won Id not have
much chance of breaking through
if the East Germans decided to
leave strings of freight cars
parked on the rails.
Tnuli-I.rfl t'onvoy
For Western soldiers, the dan
gets of pushing a tank-led supply
convoy up the I Id mile highway
are even more nightmarish. So
viet military forces in East Ger
many, which overwhelmingly out
number Atlantic Pact divisions in
Europe, could cut the highway al
any point.
An alternative to armed con
voys might be an airlift of (he
kind which broke the 1048 10 So
viet blockade.
The Soviet Embassy in East
Berlin said a promised document

preparation two weeks after So
