Tonight the 112 members of the Stanford Football Rami will
turn in their uniforms . . . their lant act of an extremely busy
and successful season.
Those who have attended the football games have seen the
product of the band's individual and collective effort in the half
time and pre-pa me shows. They have had the opportunity to
compare the bands work with that of the I ISC, UCLA and Cal
bands, and, we feel, will agree that our own group has far out
shown the marchers from these other schools.
Besides its own half-times, the band sponsored its fourth annual
High School Band Day, in which more than 2400 students par
ticipated. The band has appeared at all rallies, provided small
groups for special occasions, including brass choirs lor the forth
coming University Chorus Christmas concerts . . . and spurred
impromptu rallies on its own.
Remember the strains of "Come Join the Band" echo
ing throughout the Main I Abe before the HS(. game?
The shock last Thursday between 9 and 11 p.m. when the
roving barn/ suddenly appeared at Gaieties or practically
under your window'!'
What makes the outstanding half-times possible? What keeps
112 people from complaining about the time spent on an
(The band rehearses Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday
mornings, in addition to playing at all the games.)
First, there is the extraordinary feeling of working as a unit
for a common goal ... the feeling ol "we taking precedence over
Second, there is strong student leadership backed
u holeheartedly by the director, Julius Shuchat. All of
the togetherness in the world could not function efficient
ly and effectively icithout this leadership and cooperation
between students and faculty.
Credit goes to the student staff headed and coordinated by
David Korten, band manager, and consisting of Bill Spuck, student
director; Harvey Hundt, assistant manager; Bob Captron, drum
major; Curt Russell, public relations; Kent Kepler, properties;
Ernst Kirehner, personnel; ami Ron Toothaker, president ol
Kappa Kappa Psi. band honorary fraternity.
The members of the band come from all departments, with a
wide variety of interests. They have in common a love of music
and an ability to let their hair down ( including the most intellec
tual members, of which there are a considerable number) and let
the old-fashioned college spirit come out without lear ol appear
ing juvenile or unsophisticated.
The Football Band took its final curtain call of the season at
Big Game in the form of its Queen Anne Salute. It leaver behind
it a job well done ... a job which exceeds those ol previous years
and one which will be hard to equal next fall.
Another group bowing out at Rig Came for a year
was the Stanford football rooting section. of which we
were, immensely proud to be a part. Stanford rooters who
were criticized loudly for leaving the I ISC game early
more than redeemed themselves Saturday.
It was a game no one wanted to leave, but even more to the
rooters' credit was the courtesy ol the section following the filial
gun. As Cal rooters swarmed across the field and wielded apple
cores, jeers and bombs into the crowd, the Stanford section was
a pleasure to watch. A student leader cautioned the fans, "Let's
show them we can be good losers, even if they can I be good win
ners/ And we showed 'em!
Praise is also due to Dick Stanford ami his crew of
yell leaders, icho showed themselves in better form at
liig Game than in all the previous games put together.
Yells were kept "above the belt" and Dick kept the root
ers in high spirits.
With our eyes behind the cards, we couldn't of course see for
ourselves the effect of the card stunts, but we have it on good
authority that they were excellent; and we wish to send orchids
to the planners of these stunts as well.
Final praise goes to Prince Lightfoot, who has weathered many
storms this season (including the theft of his headdress Friday
night). The color and pageantry which he adds to each game are
unsurpassed.

The members of the band come from all departments, with a
wide variety of interests. They have in common a love of music
and an ability to let their hair down ( including the most intellec
tual members, of which there are a considerable number) and let
the old-fashioned college spirit come out without lear ol appear
ing juvenile or unsophisticated.
The Football Band took its final curtain call of the season at
Big Game in the form of its Queen Anne Salute. It leaver behind
it a job well done ... a job which exceeds those ol previous years
and one which will be hard to equal next fall.
Another group bowing out at Rig Came for a year
was the Stanford football rooting section. of which we
were, immensely proud to be a part. Stanford rooters who
were criticized loudly for leaving the I ISC game early
more than redeemed themselves Saturday.
It was a game no one wanted to leave, but even more to the
rooters' credit was the courtesy ol the section following the filial
gun. As Cal rooters swarmed across the field and wielded apple
cores, jeers and bombs into the crowd, the Stanford section was
a pleasure to watch. A student leader cautioned the fans, "Let's
show them we can be good losers, even if they can I be good win
ners/ And we showed 'em!
Praise is also due to Dick Stanford ami his crew of
yell leaders, icho showed themselves in better form at
liig Game than in all the previous games put together.
Yells were kept "above the belt" and Dick kept the root
ers in high spirits.
With our eyes behind the cards, we couldn't of course see for
ourselves the effect of the card stunts, but we have it on good
authority that they were excellent; and we wish to send orchids
to the planners of these stunts as well.
Final praise goes to Prince Lightfoot, who has weathered many
storms this season (including the theft of his headdress Friday
night). The color and pageantry which he adds to each game are
unsurpassed.
Tonight the 112 members of the Stanford Football Rami will
turn in their uniforms . . . their lant act of an extremely busy
and successful season.
Those who have attended the football games have seen the
product of the band's individual and collective effort in the half
time and pre-pa me shows. They have had the opportunity to
compare the bands work with that of the I ISC, UCLA and Cal
bands, and, we feel, will agree that our own group has far out
shown the marchers from these other schools.
Besides its own half-times, the band sponsored its fourth annual
High School Band Day, in which more than 2400 students par
ticipated. The band has appeared at all rallies, provided small
groups for special occasions, including brass choirs lor the forth
coming University Chorus Christmas concerts . . . and spurred
impromptu rallies on its own.

it a job well done ... a job which exceeds those ol previous years
and one which will be hard to equal next fall.
Another group bowing out at Rig Came for a year
was the Stanford football rooting section. of which we
were, immensely proud to be a part. Stanford rooters who
were criticized loudly for leaving the I ISC game early
more than redeemed themselves Saturday.
It was a game no one wanted to leave, but even more to the
rooters' credit was the courtesy ol the section following the filial
gun. As Cal rooters swarmed across the field and wielded apple
cores, jeers and bombs into the crowd, the Stanford section was
a pleasure to watch. A student leader cautioned the fans, "Let's
show them we can be good losers, even if they can I be good win
ners/ And we showed 'em!
Praise is also due to Dick Stanford ami his crew of
yell leaders, icho showed themselves in better form at
liig Game than in all the previous games put together.
Yells were kept "above the belt" and Dick kept the root
ers in high spirits.
With our eyes behind the cards, we couldn't of course see for
ourselves the effect of the card stunts, but we have it on good
authority that they were excellent; and we wish to send orchids
to the planners of these stunts as well.
Final praise goes to Prince Lightfoot, who has weathered many
storms this season (including the theft of his headdress Friday
night). The color and pageantry which he adds to each game are
unsurpassed.
