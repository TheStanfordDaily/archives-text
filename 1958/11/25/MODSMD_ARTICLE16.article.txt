Proper Direction
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to know what has
happened to Stanford's long tra
dition of excellent cheer leaders.
I have attended all of Stan
ford's home games so far this
year and have yet to see or hear
the cheer leaders lead any of the
school songs during a game. Even
the fight song after a touchdown
has been left completely to the
band and pompon girls. The Stan
lord yells that have become stand
ard are rarely il ever performed.
In short we have not even given
the team the standard support ex
pected of a rooting section, let
alone the impromptu cheers that
do so much to bolster the team
morale.
It is true that the student root
ers have shown little spirit, and
in general have aeted like Individ

uals watching a game, rather
than an organized cheering sec
tion. However, what can be ex
pected without adequate leader
ship. With proper direction an
aggregate group can be turned
into a solid group with pride in its
efforts. A pride that would not
allow anyone to leave before the
game had ended,
1 don't, think enough effort has
been expended in this "proper di
rection" by our present cheei
leaders. Unless something Is done
soon, the fiasco ol Nov. 1 will
certainly be repeated.
USC's rooting section humili
ated us at every turn, and we just
sat there and took their jeers
without answering. Our rooting
section lost its game far worse
than our football team did theirs.
Unless 1 his situation is retnedied
soon, Cal's rooters will run us
out of the stadium.
