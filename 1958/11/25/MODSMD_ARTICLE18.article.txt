# 'Separate Tables' Stimulating, Fine
## 
### A Review By Jerome W. Clinton 
Comedia's presentation of Ter
ence Rattigan's "Separate Tables"
provides a very stimulating and
enjoyable evening ai the theatre.
The writing is excellent, the act
ing is equally line and the direc
tion is very good.
"Separate Tables" is composed
of two one-act plays in which the
setting and the supporting east
remain the same while the major
characters and the central action
changes.
The action of both plays takes
place in a small resort hotel on
the coast ot England. The usual
inhabitants ol the hotel are elder
ly and retired. They have come
there to subsist on their pensions
until they die. Their lives are
dreary and unexciting, and they
are eagerly attracted to any event
which interrupts the tedium oi
their common routine.
Grasp Youth
The protagonists in the first
play are outsiders—people who
have not yet lived out their youth,
but still retain a tenuous grasp
on it. They are lovers who have
been condemned to need each
other, although they are incapable
ol living together without violence
and pain, and so have wasted the
best of their lives in the prolonged
agony of separation.
The action ol the play deals
with their last, desperate attempt
to accept each other and so obtain
together that peace and happiness
which they are individually de
nied. He has drifted to the hotel
there through the gradual stages
of moral degradation. She has
been forced, through terror al her
own physical decline, to seek him
out there.
Fearful Stage
The Beauregard Hotel and its
inhabitants graphically represent
the last fearful stage which they
both want «o desperately to avoid,
and so serves as a fit setting for
this struggle and its eventual res
olut ion.
In the second play, "Table Num
ber Seven," the boarders become
more than a passive background
and are directly involved in the
action.
The central event is the chance
discovery by the boarders of a
nasty, sordid incident in the life
of one of their members who had
previously been considered as no
worse than a crashing bore. This
discovery forces the "regulars" to
consider whether they may con
tinue to accept this man who has
deceived them or demand his ex
pulsion from their society.
Decision
This question is of vast impor
tance to the full-grown but des
perately dependent, daughter of
the hotel's most self-righteous
boarder; for she has found in this
man her first line friend, while
he, similarly, is forced to decide
whether' he will desert her or at
tempt to live openly with himself.
In both plays the hoi el's man
ageress, Miss Cooper, plays a sig
nificant part. It is she who first
challenges the hero to make the
first step toward solving his di
lemma.
Both of the conflicts dealt with
in these two plays arise out of
the weakness of tlie characters
themselves. And, as they are not
great or noble people, their prob
lems are small and even rather
common. Yet for all their minor
stature, they will bear a certain
degree of consideration.
The excellence of Rattigan as

a playwright lies In his rerog
nition of this poinl and his ability
to say only a o much about them
as may he said well. Either of
these plays would become tedious
and absurd it it were to be extend
ed beyond one act, or if it were
offered as a more weighty com
mentary on life, etc.
Fine Subtlety
Rattigan, however, has drawn
his characters with such line
subtlety and understanding thai
he has imparted to them and to
their problems a freshness and
vitality which makes both plays
thoroughly stimulating and en
grossing.
The challenge presented by
these plays to an actor is great;
for Mr. Malcolm and Mrs. Shank
land of "The Table by I lie Win
dow" are violent people who can
not disguise their feelings, while
Major Pollock and Miss Kailton
Bell live within their secrets. The
acting ability ot both Erica Spey
er and Eugene Roche is quite
equal to this challenge.
As Mrs. Shanktand, Miss Speyer
is a most perfect bitch, and yet
she retains thai faint tincture of
sincerity which makes her a wom
an and not a caricature. As Miss
Railton-Bell she is equally perfect
as a restrained, colorless creature
who yet retains some vestige of
charm and a hope of vitality.
Stirring Performance
Roche gives a stirring perform
ance as Mr. Malcolm a brilliant,
powerful man wiiose passionate
nature is his only master. And as
Major Pollock tie is a thoroughly
convincing weakling whose fear
is the motive force of his life.
Both Miss Speyer and Roche dis
play a truly amazing range and
subtlety of expression.
The supporting cast is generally
good. Jean Beaudry does a par
ticularly fine job as Miss Cooper,
ihe manageress and by far ihe
wisest and mosl profound charac
ter in either work. Florence Lamb
makes a perfectly charming Lady
Matheson, and Dorothy Wyman is
equally delightful as Miss Meach
an, a confirmed cynic and lady
tout.
Robs Part
Rosemary liay, as Ihe domi
neering Mr-s. Railton-Bell, mis
lakes ponderosity for pomposity
and so robs this part of much of
its latent humor. June Taliey as
Doreen, a waitress, is unfortu
nately wooden, although she has
some of the funniest lines in the
play.
Mike Kitay's direction is gen
erally quite good, although he
does seem uncertain at times
whether tie is dealing with a good
play or a great tragedy. As witii
Miss Hay, he slights the humor
ous aspects of some scenes in
order to give Ihe play a more
sombre though not more serious
cast.
Suitably Adequate
The costumes are suitable and
the sets quite adequate. The lim
ited space of The Loft is very in
telligently employed; most, of the
action is within view of all Ihe
seats, although the performance
is given in Ihe round.
Comedia is making serious
drama, preformed with near-pro
fessional competence, convenient
ly available to Stanford students.
"Separate Tables" is an ex
tremely worthwhile production.
Any student with the leasl in
terest in the I heat re would be
remarkably ill-advised to miss it,
because it is an excellent play and
because Comedia should be en
couraged and supported in its ef
forts.

Comedia's presentation of Ter
ence Rattigan's "Separate Tables"
provides a very stimulating and
enjoyable evening ai the theatre.
The writing is excellent, the act
ing is equally line and the direc
tion is very good.
"Separate Tables" is composed
of two one-act plays in which the
setting and the supporting east
remain the same while the major
characters and the central action
changes.
The action of both plays takes
place in a small resort hotel on
the coast ot England. The usual
inhabitants ol the hotel are elder
ly and retired. They have come
there to subsist on their pensions
until they die. Their lives are
dreary and unexciting, and they
are eagerly attracted to any event
which interrupts the tedium oi
their common routine.
Grasp Youth
The protagonists in the first
play are outsiders—people who
have not yet lived out their youth,
but still retain a tenuous grasp
on it. They are lovers who have
been condemned to need each
other, although they are incapable
ol living together without violence
and pain, and so have wasted the
best of their lives in the prolonged
agony of separation.
The action ol the play deals
with their last, desperate attempt
to accept each other and so obtain
together that peace and happiness
which they are individually de
nied. He has drifted to the hotel
there through the gradual stages
of moral degradation. She has
been forced, through terror al her
own physical decline, to seek him
out there.
Fearful Stage
The Beauregard Hotel and its
inhabitants graphically represent
the last fearful stage which they
both want «o desperately to avoid,
and so serves as a fit setting for
this struggle and its eventual res
olut ion.
In the second play, "Table Num
ber Seven," the boarders become
more than a passive background
and are directly involved in the
action.
The central event is the chance
discovery by the boarders of a
nasty, sordid incident in the life
of one of their members who had
previously been considered as no
worse than a crashing bore. This
discovery forces the "regulars" to
consider whether they may con
tinue to accept this man who has
deceived them or demand his ex
pulsion from their society.
Decision
This question is of vast impor
tance to the full-grown but des
perately dependent, daughter of
the hotel's most self-righteous
boarder; for she has found in this
man her first line friend, while
he, similarly, is forced to decide
whether' he will desert her or at
tempt to live openly with himself.
In both plays the hoi el's man
ageress, Miss Cooper, plays a sig
nificant part. It is she who first
challenges the hero to make the
first step toward solving his di
lemma.
Both of the conflicts dealt with
in these two plays arise out of
the weakness of tlie characters
themselves. And, as they are not
great or noble people, their prob
lems are small and even rather
common. Yet for all their minor
stature, they will bear a certain
degree of consideration.
The excellence of Rattigan as

a playwright lies In his rerog
nition of this poinl and his ability
to say only a o much about them
as may he said well. Either of
these plays would become tedious
and absurd it it were to be extend
ed beyond one act, or if it were
offered as a more weighty com
mentary on life, etc.
Fine Subtlety
Rattigan, however, has drawn
his characters with such line
subtlety and understanding thai
he has imparted to them and to
their problems a freshness and
vitality which makes both plays
thoroughly stimulating and en
grossing.
The challenge presented by
these plays to an actor is great;
for Mr. Malcolm and Mrs. Shank
land of "The Table by I lie Win
dow" are violent people who can
not disguise their feelings, while
Major Pollock and Miss Kailton
Bell live within their secrets. The
acting ability ot both Erica Spey
er and Eugene Roche is quite
equal to this challenge.
As Mrs. Shanktand, Miss Speyer
is a most perfect bitch, and yet
she retains thai faint tincture of
sincerity which makes her a wom
an and not a caricature. As Miss
Railton-Bell she is equally perfect
as a restrained, colorless creature
who yet retains some vestige of
charm and a hope of vitality.
Stirring Performance
Roche gives a stirring perform
ance as Mr. Malcolm a brilliant,
powerful man wiiose passionate
nature is his only master. And as
Major Pollock tie is a thoroughly
convincing weakling whose fear
is the motive force of his life.
Both Miss Speyer and Roche dis
play a truly amazing range and
subtlety of expression.
The supporting cast is generally
good. Jean Beaudry does a par
ticularly fine job as Miss Cooper,
ihe manageress and by far ihe
wisest and mosl profound charac
ter in either work. Florence Lamb
makes a perfectly charming Lady
Matheson, and Dorothy Wyman is
equally delightful as Miss Meach
an, a confirmed cynic and lady
tout.
Robs Part
Rosemary liay, as Ihe domi
neering Mr-s. Railton-Bell, mis
lakes ponderosity for pomposity
and so robs this part of much of
its latent humor. June Taliey as
Doreen, a waitress, is unfortu
nately wooden, although she has
some of the funniest lines in the
play.
Mike Kitay's direction is gen
erally quite good, although he
does seem uncertain at times
whether tie is dealing with a good
play or a great tragedy. As witii
Miss Hay, he slights the humor
ous aspects of some scenes in
order to give Ihe play a more
sombre though not more serious
cast.
Suitably Adequate
The costumes are suitable and
the sets quite adequate. The lim
ited space of The Loft is very in
telligently employed; most, of the
action is within view of all Ihe
seats, although the performance
is given in Ihe round.

Suitably Adequate

"Separate Tables" is an ex

Any student with the leasl in

remarkably ill-advised to miss it,
because it is an excellent play and
because Comedia should be en

Comedia's presentation of Ter
ence Rattigan's "Separate Tables"
provides a very stimulating and
enjoyable evening ai the theatre.
The writing is excellent, the act
ing is equally line and the direc
tion is very good.
"Separate Tables" is composed
of two one-act plays in which the
setting and the supporting east
remain the same while the major
characters and the central action
changes.
The action of both plays takes
place in a small resort hotel on
the coast ot England. The usual
inhabitants ol the hotel are elder
ly and retired. They have come
there to subsist on their pensions
until they die. Their lives are
dreary and unexciting, and they
are eagerly attracted to any event
which interrupts the tedium oi
their common routine.
Grasp Youth
The protagonists in the first
play are outsiders—people who
have not yet lived out their youth,
but still retain a tenuous grasp
on it. They are lovers who have
been condemned to need each
other, although they are incapable
ol living together without violence
and pain, and so have wasted the
best of their lives in the prolonged
agony of separation.
The action ol the play deals
with their last, desperate attempt
to accept each other and so obtain
together that peace and happiness
which they are individually de
nied. He has drifted to the hotel
there through the gradual stages
of moral degradation. She has
been forced, through terror al her
own physical decline, to seek him
out there.
Fearful Stage
The Beauregard Hotel and its
inhabitants graphically represent
the last fearful stage which they
both want «o desperately to avoid,
and so serves as a fit setting for
this struggle and its eventual res
olut ion.
In the second play, "Table Num
ber Seven," the boarders become
more than a passive background
and are directly involved in the
action.
The central event is the chance
discovery by the boarders of a
nasty, sordid incident in the life
of one of their members who had
previously been considered as no
worse than a crashing bore. This
discovery forces the "regulars" to
consider whether they may con
tinue to accept this man who has
deceived them or demand his ex
pulsion from their society.
Decision
This question is of vast impor
tance to the full-grown but des
perately dependent, daughter of
the hotel's most self-righteous
boarder; for she has found in this
man her first line friend, while
he, similarly, is forced to decide
whether' he will desert her or at
tempt to live openly with himself.
In both plays the hoi el's man
ageress, Miss Cooper, plays a sig
nificant part. It is she who first
challenges the hero to make the
first step toward solving his di
lemma.
Both of the conflicts dealt with
in these two plays arise out of
the weakness of tlie characters
themselves. And, as they are not
great or noble people, their prob
lems are small and even rather
common. Yet for all their minor
stature, they will bear a certain
degree of consideration.
The excellence of Rattigan as

a playwright lies In his rerog
nition of this poinl and his ability
to say only a o much about them
as may he said well. Either of
these plays would become tedious
and absurd it it were to be extend
ed beyond one act, or if it were
offered as a more weighty com
mentary on life, etc.
Fine Subtlety
Rattigan, however, has drawn
his characters with such line
subtlety and understanding thai
he has imparted to them and to
their problems a freshness and
vitality which makes both plays
thoroughly stimulating and en
grossing.
The challenge presented by
these plays to an actor is great;
for Mr. Malcolm and Mrs. Shank
land of "The Table by I lie Win
dow" are violent people who can
not disguise their feelings, while
Major Pollock and Miss Kailton
Bell live within their secrets. The
acting ability ot both Erica Spey
er and Eugene Roche is quite
equal to this challenge.
As Mrs. Shanktand, Miss Speyer
is a most perfect bitch, and yet
she retains thai faint tincture of
sincerity which makes her a wom
an and not a caricature. As Miss
Railton-Bell she is equally perfect
as a restrained, colorless creature
who yet retains some vestige of
charm and a hope of vitality.
Stirring Performance
Roche gives a stirring perform
ance as Mr. Malcolm a brilliant,
powerful man wiiose passionate
nature is his only master. And as
Major Pollock tie is a thoroughly
convincing weakling whose fear
is the motive force of his life.
Both Miss Speyer and Roche dis
play a truly amazing range and
subtlety of expression.
The supporting cast is generally
good. Jean Beaudry does a par
ticularly fine job as Miss Cooper,
ihe manageress and by far ihe
wisest and mosl profound charac
ter in either work. Florence Lamb
makes a perfectly charming Lady
Matheson, and Dorothy Wyman is
equally delightful as Miss Meach
an, a confirmed cynic and lady
tout.
Robs Part
Rosemary liay, as Ihe domi
neering Mr-s. Railton-Bell, mis
lakes ponderosity for pomposity
and so robs this part of much of
its latent humor. June Taliey as
Doreen, a waitress, is unfortu
nately wooden, although she has
some of the funniest lines in the
play.
Mike Kitay's direction is gen
erally quite good, although he
does seem uncertain at times

ihe manageress and by far ihe
wisest and mosl profound charac
ter in either work. Florence Lamb
makes a perfectly charming Lady
Matheson, and Dorothy Wyman is
equally delightful as Miss Meach
an, a confirmed cynic and lady
tout.
Robs Part
Rosemary liay, as Ihe domi
neering Mr-s. Railton-Bell, mis
lakes ponderosity for pomposity
and so robs this part of much of
its latent humor. June Taliey as
Doreen, a waitress, is unfortu
nately wooden, although she has
some of the funniest lines in the
play.
Mike Kitay's direction is gen
erally quite good, although he
does seem uncertain at times
whether tie is dealing with a good
play or a great tragedy. As witii
Miss Hay, he slights the humor
ous aspects of some scenes in
order to give Ihe play a more
sombre though not more serious
cast.
Suitably Adequate
The costumes are suitable and
the sets quite adequate. The lim
ited space of The Loft is very in
telligently employed; most, of the
action is within view of all Ihe
seats, although the performance
is given in Ihe round.
Comedia is making serious
drama, preformed with near-pro
fessional competence, convenient
ly available to Stanford students.
"Separate Tables" is an ex
tremely worthwhile production.
Any student with the leasl in
terest in the I heat re would be
remarkably ill-advised to miss it,
because it is an excellent play and
because Comedia should be en
couraged and supported in its ef
forts.
Comedia's presentation of Ter
ence Rattigan's "Separate Tables"
provides a very stimulating and
enjoyable evening ai the theatre.
The writing is excellent, the act
ing is equally line and the direc
tion is very good.
"Separate Tables" is composed
of two one-act plays in which the
setting and the supporting east
remain the same while the major
characters and the central action
changes.
The action of both plays takes
place in a small resort hotel on
the coast ot England. The usual
inhabitants ol the hotel are elder
ly and retired. They have come
there to subsist on their pensions
until they die. Their lives are
dreary and unexciting, and they
are eagerly attracted to any event
which interrupts the tedium oi
their common routine.
Grasp Youth
The protagonists in the first
play are outsiders—people who
have not yet lived out their youth,
but still retain a tenuous grasp
on it. They are lovers who have
been condemned to need each
other, although they are incapable
ol living together without violence
and pain, and so have wasted the
best of their lives in the prolonged
agony of separation.
The action ol the play deals
with their last, desperate attempt
to accept each other and so obtain
together that peace and happiness
which they are individually de
nied. He has drifted to the hotel
there through the gradual stages
of moral degradation. She has
been forced, through terror al her
own physical decline, to seek him
out there.
Fearful Stage
The Beauregard Hotel and its
inhabitants graphically represent
the last fearful stage which they
both want «o desperately to avoid,
and so serves as a fit setting for
this struggle and its eventual res
olut ion.
In the second play, "Table Num
ber Seven," the boarders become
more than a passive background
and are directly involved in the
action.
The central event is the chance
discovery by the boarders of a
nasty, sordid incident in the life
of one of their members who had
previously been considered as no
worse than a crashing bore. This
discovery forces the "regulars" to
consider whether they may con
tinue to accept this man who has
deceived them or demand his ex
pulsion from their society.
Decision
This question is of vast impor
tance to the full-grown but des
perately dependent, daughter of
the hotel's most self-righteous
boarder; for she has found in this
man her first line friend, while
he, similarly, is forced to decide
whether' he will desert her or at
tempt to live openly with himself.
In both plays the hoi el's man
ageress, Miss Cooper, plays a sig
nificant part. It is she who first
challenges the hero to make the
first step toward solving his di
lemma.
Both of the conflicts dealt with
in these two plays arise out of
the weakness of tlie characters
themselves. And, as they are not
great or noble people, their prob
lems are small and even rather
common. Yet for all their minor
stature, they will bear a certain
degree of consideration.
The excellence of Rattigan as

a playwright lies In his rerog
nition of this poinl and his ability
to say only a o much about them
as may he said well. Either of
these plays would become tedious
and absurd it it were to be extend
ed beyond one act, or if it were
offered as a more weighty com
mentary on life, etc.
Fine Subtlety
Rattigan, however, has drawn
his characters with such line
subtlety and understanding thai
he has imparted to them and to
their problems a freshness and
vitality which makes both plays
thoroughly stimulating and en
grossing.
The challenge presented by
these plays to an actor is great;
for Mr. Malcolm and Mrs. Shank
land of "The Table by I lie Win
dow" are violent people who can
not disguise their feelings, while
Major Pollock and Miss Kailton
Bell live within their secrets. The
acting ability ot both Erica Spey
er and Eugene Roche is quite
equal to this challenge.
As Mrs. Shanktand, Miss Speyer
is a most perfect bitch, and yet
she retains thai faint tincture of
sincerity which makes her a wom
an and not a caricature. As Miss
Railton-Bell she is equally perfect
as a restrained, colorless creature
who yet retains some vestige of
charm and a hope of vitality.
Stirring Performance
Roche gives a stirring perform
ance as Mr. Malcolm a brilliant,
powerful man wiiose passionate
nature is his only master. And as
Major Pollock tie is a thoroughly
convincing weakling whose fear
is the motive force of his life.
Both Miss Speyer and Roche dis
play a truly amazing range and
subtlety of expression.
The supporting cast is generally
good. Jean Beaudry does a par
ticularly fine job as Miss Cooper,
ihe manageress and by far ihe
wisest and mosl profound charac
ter in either work. Florence Lamb
makes a perfectly charming Lady
Matheson, and Dorothy Wyman is
equally delightful as Miss Meach
an, a confirmed cynic and lady
tout.
