# Western Stand-Patism Loses to Kremlin Coup
## 
### Michael Haas IIR Political Analyst 
To veil loss of face in Asia, the
Kremlin has shifted the focus of
the cold-war battle for prestige
from embarrased, precocious
children on her' Last to an incho
ate regime on her West, to a di
vided cily where Western occupa
tion remains without apparent
reason. And Russia wins still an
other propaganda coup.
Today the USSR intends to re
linquish its responsibility for Ber
lin's future, staying serenely
aloof while East Germany pro
ceeds to make illogical and im
possible the Western position in
the city â€” a position of thumb
twiddling, of standpatism, ol re
fusal to admit error in failing to
transfer sovereignty of West Ber
lin to West Germany when the
latter voted to rearm.
To build up East German pres
tige, it appear s, is to Russia's self
interest. She wants a Central Eu
rope showcase of Communism
more attractive than that of West
German capitalism. In the short
run Russia wants, moreover, to
steal the thunder of the revised
Rapacki Plan; in tlie long run she
seeks a strong Red Germany as
a check against recrudescence ol
Czech and Polish separatism.
After the Rau mission (1957)
the Kremlin's economic gambit
has been to link West Germany
economically with the East, using
the "German internal trade"
clause of the EEC, which draws
East Germany into ihe Common
Market.
Diplomatic recognition of East
Germany, the Reds seem to ar
gue, will follow soon after the
economic recognition effected in
last week's East German-West
German trade pact, which, signifi
cantly, also leaves transit control
of East German roads in the
hands of Ulbricht.
The West, meanwhile, has as
serted unity, and even West Ger
man Socialist newspaper s are be
hind us. In distinction to Wash
ington's wait-and-see policy, how
ever, Christian Democratic Mayor
Brandt of West Berlin suggests
something positive:
(1) Publish a documentation of
our case to facilitate talks with
Russia.
(2) Insist upon establishment
of an all-Berlin parliament to han

die city housekeeping details.
From his approach it follows
that the West can undermine So
viet attempts lo give prestige to
East Germany by giving Russia
a choice between assenting to
constructive ideas or rejecting
good ideas, thus assuming the
same position of stubbornness
which now typifies the Western

position.
For ii wo porsist in standing
pii 1 everywhere, sooner or later
satellite peoples will learn to
"love Bio Brother."
