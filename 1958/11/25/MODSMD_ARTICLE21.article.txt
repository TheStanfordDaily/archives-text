It's all over. The local football season, that is. And lor Stanford
it ended at a good time with the Indians looking as good as they
have all year. Now, with the ink on Big Came stories hardly dry,
plenty of eyes are already being cast ahead to 1959.
It's hardly to be expected that anyone would be so rash as to pre
dict a great season for the Staiilords but on the other hand, it
ought to at least be better than this season's 2-8. One thing looks to
be sure, barring injuries the Indians will have several individual
performers of very high caliber on a national scale.
There's Chris KuiTortl, ol course, lle'll be in lor plenty of post
season honors this year, l<ut the accolades should be even greater in
'59. Chuck Taylor said after Saturday's game, "Kurford is the finest
end I'>e ever seen." And in answer to a question added, "Ves, that
includes Kill Met oil."
Dick Norman, playing some of the best ball ever turned in by an
Indian sophomore quarterback, should also make a strong hid for all
regional and possibly national honors in 1959. Taylor exclaimed after I
the game that "Noltody will touch this kid Norman. He'll be as good
as any I've ever seen." Hear in mind that Taylor has seen I'rankie
Albert, («ary Kerkorian, llob (.arret! and John Krodie. And they
were pretty fair quarterbacks at Stanford.
The strongest man in the middle of Stanford's line next fall will
most likely be Doug Pursell. Though splitting this year's center time
with Koch ( oiiklin, I'ursell established himsell as among the best
line backers in the West.
With a little polish on blocking and the year of experience under
his belt, PurseH's next two years on the Card varsity look to he years
of Stanford strength in the middle,

Miscellaneous notes on Kig Came:
The Cards actually came darned dose to getting another chance to
pull the game out of the fire, even alter missing the conversion, it
came with H5 seconds to play as Cal ran a second and seven (day Irom
its own 11(5.
That was the play where Hank Olguiu fumbled while frying to go
around Stanford's left end. Luck was with Cal, though, because the
bobble bounced straight back into Olguin's mitts as Stanford's Tom
my Williams came slashing after Olgnin and/or the ball. So, the last -
gasp chance never came.
Had the ball taken a Stanford bounce, Williams recovered and the
Indians somehow scored, Joe Kapp would have become Ihe goat of
the century. Why Kapp and not Olgnin? Because Olguin's miscue
was physical and those are excusable. But why in the world did
Kapp ever call a pitch-out in a situation where Cal needed only a
couple of quarterback sneaks to kill Ihe clock.
ll seems like signalcalling ability should also be a prerequisite
for so-called All-American quarterbacks.
What about that first-gasp chance? The one where Nicole! barely
overthrew Joel Kreis on the game's first offensive play. A score then
might really have thrown the Coldcn Bears for a loop. One thing
seems sure had Stanford scored first, it would have kicked for the
PAT. Had it been good (and it probably would have, since Skip Face,
hasn't missed any all year) the Cards could have also booted the sec
ond one. And that would have added up to 17.
Hut what the heck. It was a darned good game; nobody had any
thing to he ashamed of; the fans all got their $5 worth. And I'll bei
that virtually every Stanford backer is still glad the Cards went for
the win instead of the tie.
At least 1 know I'm happy the team doesn't play the chicken
livered take-thetie kind of football that Woody Hayes' Ohio State
team and Bobby Dodd's Ceorgia Tech outfit have played in similar
situations this year.
Title Time in Harrier Circles
The best cross-country meet to be held at Stanford in many years
is coming up .Saturday morning at 10. It's the second (and last)
Pacific Coast Conference championship, pitting the best PCC run
ners against each other in a four-mile chase over the Stanford golf
course.
With entry lists nearly completed, Oregon is shaping up as a
semi solid favorite to win the title that went to Idaho in 1957. The
Ducks are so deep that Kd Baldwin, ninth in last year's title meet,
probably won't even make their team for this year's race.
The team fight for second place is wide open, with Idaho and the
four California schools all in the thick of it. The defending champion
Vandals have three men back who placed in the top 10 last fall.
That the four California schools are even can be seen by Stan
lord's season record. The Curds have broken even in four meets with
Cal and two each with CSC and CCI.A.
