lord's 10r»!> basketball squad.
Today, guards and centers.)

Coach Howie Dallmar's 1959
Stanford basketball squad figures I
to be one of the top hoop attrac
tions on tin 1 West Coast. Dall
mar has all but one of his '158 j
regulars returning, and that one,
John Pflueger, was not a starter. |
At center Dallmar has 6-4 sen
ior Dick llaga and (j-8 junior Neal
Brockmeyer returning. Ilaga will !
be the starter at this position.
He's expected to be a greatly im
proved ball player this season. [
He played in all 25 Indian games!
last season, emerging with the I
top shooting percentage of 46.2 j

Tickets for the San Jose Stale
basketball £ a m e w h i <• h will
open the season for Stanford on
Monday night, Dec. I, are now
on sale at tli<* Stanford Depart
ment of Athletics. The tickets
are 50 cents for all students
with student body cards. If the

per cent. lie was also Ihe top re
bounder.
Haga, as Dallmar puts it. "was
both fortunate and unfortunate"
not to have had much relief at
center last year. He's benefited
from the great amount of time
tie's had to play. He must give
the club more offensive help this
year, though.
Brockmeyer, at 6-8, could be a
valuable man. He's been incon
sistent 1o dale, but is a good
shooter and experience gained in
j December should prove valuable
: to I tic tallest man on the squad.
The staiting guards will be
Paul Neumann, last year's cap
lain, and Doug Warren. N'eu
mann could be one of the finest
backcourt men on ihe Pacific
! ('oast. He does everything well,
though he has been called "some
' limes loo much a team man" by
i his coach.
j Dallmar was referring 1o Ihe
' fad thai Neumann hasn't been
shooting enough.
Warren, at C 2, is a steady play
er and a line jump shooter, lie
is a hard worker who gives his all
(hough Ik 1 is nol considered to
have any great natural ability f<u
the game.
Remaining guards are John
Stabler, Tom Crawford, Hub
Howling and Jerry Hose. SI abler
(is the fastest man on 1he squad,
a real pesky opponent. He has
shown a great improvement over
last year.
Crawford, 5-11, is a senior. He's
a bard worker and a good player,
I hough inconsistent.
Howling, another shortie at !">
II, was frosh captain last year,
howling possesses good basket
ball sense, but must overcome bis
inexperience. As a frosh he bit !
only I per cent of bis floor shots; I

Iliis too must ho eorreelod.
Joi i v Rose li;is lots of floor con
fidence and was particularly in
strumental in helping the Indians
over Soul horn California last
year.
