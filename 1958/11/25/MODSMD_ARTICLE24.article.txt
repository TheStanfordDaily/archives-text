# MARVELOUS

Hello Dear ...
I've just returned from the post
office where I mailed all the things
you asked for. Whatever do you
want with your bicycle tire pump
— and inhere will you put it?
You'll notice that I've tucked in
a little surprise foryou-your favor
ite Woodhue Cologne in a perfectly
marvelous new aerosol spray < pink,
to match your room—isn't (hat
nice?). I bought one in my beloved
Aphrodisia, and it's such fun to use
-and so convenient! I thought
you'd like to have one to take with
you on your big weekend with Bill's
folks . . . it's such a handy thing
for travel.
Incidentally, Faberge puts it up
in a De Luxe version too-a gor
geous golden gift case that's refill
able-and only $5 00. You might
stop in next time you're in town
and get one for Aunt Martha-her
birthday is a week from Monday
and I'm sure she'd be thrilled to
pieces 'and surprised that you re
membered on time for once) . . .
you know how she Just drools over
Flambeau.
Dad Just came in and sends you
a kiss. We're due at the Johnsons'
for dinner, so I'll write more to
morrow, and close now with much
love from us all...
