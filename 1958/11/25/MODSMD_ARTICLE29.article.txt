# ASSU Polish Exchange Student Compares University Activities
## 
### 
Boguslaw Blaszczyszyn, Polish
student from Warsaw University,
said thai lie is surprised by the
enthusiasm shown by American
students for extra-curricular ac
tivities, and the amount of time
devoted to such organizations.
Living together on campus

makes a big difference to the so
cial life at Stanford. Warsaw Uni
versity is non-residential, so that
student activities are usually con
fined to small groups of students,
he added.
Boguslaw comes to Stanford on
an ASSU foreign scholarship. He
is a graduate student in interna
tional economics.
He continued to say that stu
dent organizations to control stu
dent affairs exist in all Polish
universities, and these are repre
sented in the University Councils.
Foreign student exchanges are ar
ranged through the Foreign Trav
el Bureau.
Stanford encourages students
to work steadily throughout the
year by setting mid-term exams
and quizzes, whereas in Poland
final exams are held at the end
of each year only, which gives
the student more freedom in his
study, he said.
In Poland, a student takes all
the courses of his department,
and specialization and selection <Â»112
courses is possible only in the
final years.
He commented that Ihe Ameri
can people arc very busy, and
seem to be absorbed in the job
I hey are doing.
