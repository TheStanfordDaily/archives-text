# Students Comment On Berlin
## 
### Diana Smith 
Wolfgang Storch and Hanna
loro Reddies, German exchange
students, cited Berlin's position as
a "lighthouse" of the free world,
and the widely exploited propa
ganda value of Berlin escapees to
the West, as outstanding reasons
behind Premier Khrushchev's cur
rent attempt to remove the four
powers from Berlin.
Goading the, Communists
In a recent Daily interview,
Miss Reddies pointed out the dan
ger of goading the Communists
about the stream of refugees
across the border, and at the
same time the necessity of publi
cizing the need for help in relo
cating these refugees.
Propaganda about the defection
of Prof. Joseph Mamel, rector of
Friedrich Schiller University in
Jena, just one week before the
university's 100 th anniversary cel
ebration last August, may have
been an example of the disadvan
tage of too much propaganda,
Miss Reddies felt.
Subversive Activities
Subversive activities of the
NTS group have prompted inter
ference and the removal of for
eign troops by Communist offi
cials. Storch described the NTS
as a small refugee group repre
senting many points of view, en
gaged in undercover opposition to
the German Democratic Republic.
He said that NTS activities
were of course not the primary
motive behind Khrushchev's
move. Storch called the demand
for withdrawal of foreign troops
from Berlin another test of West
ern strength. He expressed doubt
that from present indications it
will lead to open war.
Relative Faith
Asked to comment on the fact
that Russia's willingness to with
draw her own troops from Berlin
must indicate relative faith in the
German Democratic Republic's
government, Storch pointed out
that there has been little post-Sta
lin liberalization in East Ger
many.
East Germany's strategic posi
tion on the fringe of the Euro
pean satellites he gave as a pri
mary explanation for this. Also,
Russians remember the June 1953
revolt in East Germany as the
first of satellite unrest following
the death of Stalin, Storch added.
Fellow Refugees
Miss Reddies explained the po
sition of her 10 million fellow ref
ugees from that part of Germany
occupied by Poland since World
War 11. "We feel a spiritual
bond as Germans, but beyond
that what can you do?"
They remember too well the
nature of war to seek German re
unification try force, she added.
