The 1957 response was $607,000,
with 21.3_per cent of the alumni
contributing. This year, Walker
pointed out. sights have been
raised in the hope that 24 per
cent of the alumni will give.
"The Fund is the base on which
all the University's gift programs
rest," Walker said. "It is Stan
ford's main sour ce of unrestricted
support."
Even though annual tuition has

tion. drive officials pointed out.

balance from gifts and income
from endowment.
Of 1956 57's $22,000,000 operat

about 13 per cent.

volunteers, Business School Dean
Ernest C. Arbucklc, then a trus
tee, explained:
"The increase in tuition from
$750 to $ 1005 a year will add an
estimated $2,000,000 to the Uni
versity's 1958 59 income.
"Of this amount, i0 per cenl
will t?o into faculty salaries and
additions; 30 per cent is ear
marked for student aid; 25 per
cent is set aside for physical plant
maintenance and improvement,
and 5 per cent for smaller, miscel
laneous items."
Stanford seniors will lake part
