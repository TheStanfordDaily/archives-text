# West Agrees On Secret Plan For West Berlin
## 
### 
BPJRLIN (/I') -The Western Big Three Tuesday night were reported
firmly united behind a new secret plan to counter any Communist
attempt to freeze them out of Berlin.
Diplomats said the agreement was reached within the past few
days. This indicated the Allies had resolved any differences on how

to react should the Soviet Union
hand over to the East Germans
control of Allied lifelines to iso
lated West Berlin.
Diplomats said that under the
plan the three would refuse to
allow East Germany to replace
the Soviet Union on the four-pow
er Allied air safety center which
controls all air traffic in and out
of Berlin.

East German Communist boss
Waller Ulbricht spelled out his
intentions. While scoffing al
Western fears of a Communis!
blockade, he said the Allies would
have to negotiate with his regime
for free access to Berlin.
"If 1 want tf> travel to London,
1 must have the permission of the
English government," Ulbricht
said in an interview with a Brit
ish newspaper. "And if the gen
tlemen want to travel to Berlin,
they must have the permission of
I he government of the DDR (East
Germany). That is just the way
it is."

news agency ADN gave the inter

Ulbricht gave the impression
the Soviet Union was about to
hand over control at any minute,
but the Soviets seemed to be mov
ing cautiously, feeling out the Al
lies before taking the big step.
"Blockade" Test
The U.S. Army quietly sent a
lone truck down the 110-mile road
linking Berlin with West Ger
many, past Soviet guards at a
border checkpoint without en
countering any trouble.
This was the second test runâ€”
and carried out without a hitch
since the Soviet Union on Nov. 14
turned back an outward-bound
convoy of three covered U.S.
Army trucks. In keeping with
long - standing orders, the U.S.
guards refused to let the Soviets
inspect the cargo.
