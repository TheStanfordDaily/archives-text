## Athletic Award Change Held for Clarification 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Legislature last night tabled
for at least a week by-laws
changes which will revamp the
University athletic awards sys
tem.
The proposals, recommended
earlier this quarter by the Dc

partment of Athletics, were ta
bled because of feeling that too
trinny specific points ate present
ly unclear to Legislature mem
bers.
Such items as methods of de
termining cross-country award
winners and whether 1958 foot
hall awards would be granted un
der the new system were among
those questioned.
ASSU President John Bohn,
who had recommended immediate
approval of the changes, said
that some athletic department
representative probably Assist
ant Athletic Director Chuck Tay
lor would lie present at the nexl
Legislature meeting to help clar
ify unclear points.
