# Cal Team Trounces Stanford In 'Big Debate' at Mem Aud
## Decision Is Unanimous 
### Duane Davis 
If there wore hii axe symbolic
of victory among our schools' ric
bating teams, University of Cah
fornia would now have two Stan
ford axes.
Debating the subject, "Re
solved, that thr United States
should grant statehood to Ha
waii," ('al debaters .felt Horner
and Arne Werchick, arguing the
affirmative, trounced Stanford's
Patrick Milligan an<i William
Goldman, arguing the negative,
at last night's Tuesday Evening
Series.
Cal argued that Hawaii is eco
nomically ready to assume the
responsibilities of statehood. That
the United States does not allow
Hawaii to exercise any represen
tative influence in Congress i .
contradictory to the fundamental
American belief in the governed';
right to representation.
Cal stressed that Hawaii gives
up more money in taxes to the
United States than it receives in
benefits.
Oriental
Stanford's team submitted that
no other state in the United
States was so predominantly ori
ental in population. They ex
plained that Hawaii was too dis
tant from the United States for
the latter government to exercise
sufficient control over it.
Chief point of the negative an
gument was that Communist in
filtration in key positions in the
Hawaiian economy made accept
a nee of Hawaii into statehood
simply a letting down of the bars
to Communist influence here in
the United States.
Tariffs
The Big Five, a monopolistic
organization in Hawaii, would
see that tariffs on Hawaiian sug
ar imports into California were
lowered to the point that. Califor
nia's sugar beet industry would
be ruined, Milligan and Goldman
stressed.
Stanford summarized that Ha
waii needed Commonwealth sta
tus, a self regulated government,
free from undue influence of the
United States.
Cal minimized the importance
of the evidence concerning the
Communist - dominated Big Five
and the International Longshore
men's Union in Hawaii.
But they persistently brought
to bear upon Stanford's argument,
that Stanford did not adequately
define the Commonwealth organ
ization with which it wished to
replace the idea of statehood.

Debating the subject, "Re
solved, that thr United States
should grant statehood to Ha
waii," ('al debaters .felt Horner
and Arne Werchick, arguing the
affirmative, trounced Stanford's
Patrick Milligan an<i William
Goldman, arguing the negative,
at last night's Tuesday Evening
Series.
Cal argued that Hawaii is eco
nomically ready to assume the
responsibilities of statehood. That
the United States does not allow
Hawaii to exercise any represen
tative influence in Congress i .
contradictory to the fundamental
American belief in the governed';
right to representation.

Stanford's team submitted that
no other state in the United
States was so predominantly ori
ental in population. They ex
plained that Hawaii was too dis
tant from the United States for
the latter government to exercise
sufficient control over it.
Chief point of the negative an

Hawaiian economy made accept

be ruined, Milligan and Goldman

Stanford summarized that Ha

free from undue influence of the
United States.
Cal minimized the importance
of the evidence concerning the
Communist - dominated Big Five
and the International Longshore
men's Union in Hawaii.
