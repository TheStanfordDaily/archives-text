# No Isolation

Throuchoi i TifK kf.st of the nation tomorrow in I hanksgiving
)) a y — a day aside each year for citizens to pause and rifled
upon the conditions in which lliey find themselves.
Here, in a residential university, I hanksgiving and other holi
days are looked upon us days of no classes—days to catch up on
studies, to write papers, to read books. For some, I hanksgiving
is a week end to go home and observe it as it traditionally is ob
served —a family occasion.
Regardless of hoiv this Thanksgit ing is spent —with
a booh or hith family festivity —/(<-</ /»/.«> m insert a
thought or two.
One of the most important considerations for Stanford stu
dents to look at is ihat thanksgiving is a community holiday.
Students, too often bound up in themselves, may forget that mil
lions of people are living in their own way outside oi a university
environment. Those within the I Iniversity have a tendency to
wrap themselves in a cloak lot ivory, i! you will I against The
"outside world.
F.xcept in a philosophical context, the community of mankind
is often ignored within the I iniversity, and we urge ea«'h oi our
readers to reconsider his position within society, lor certainly
he is a part ol society. We are not advocating what some would
loosely call "conformity ' or an automatic do-what-everyone-else
is-doing role. Rather we are reminding each individual of his
obligations to society and of the University to society. To quote
Dr. Alexander Miller's article in The Daily ol Oct. 16:
"The University's business is to appropriate, improve
and transmit the heritage of wisdom—humanly speahing
because life is impoverished without it. . . .
. . JT'e all tend to begin by ashing of the University
experience, as of everything else, ff hat s in it for me?
We are on the way to being citizens of the Republic of
Letters, craftsmen and apprentices worth our place in a
Guild of Scholars, when we ask instead, '17 bar's in ME
for IT?' "
While Dr. Miller was speaking directly of the University, we
feel tins can he applied to the role of the student in relation to
society.
What ia in the scholar for society? Are changes needed?
What can he do with his studies to implement these changes?
flow can the community as a whole he made aware ol the need
for the heritage of wisdom, ami how can the scholar aid in this
awareness?
We feel that the student bhould not strictly isolate himsell
during his years of higher education, even though his studies may
he chiefly of what some would term a less practical (not directly
useful in a vocation) nature, hut that he should he aware of some
thing and/or someone beyond himsell.
Thanksgiving is one time to increase this awareness, and we
urge each student to take a moment to evaluate his position.
