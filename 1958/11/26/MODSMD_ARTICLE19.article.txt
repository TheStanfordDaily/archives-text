Muzzled?
Editor, The Daily:
We have heard that on Monday
evening (Nov. 24) there was a
meeting of Judicial Council, the
Inter Fraternity Council, and the
Women's Social Regulations Com
mittee, to consider the question of
fraternity open houses—specifi
cally, under what conditions worn
en will be allowed to go upstairs
in men's residences on campus.
We also understand that the
question of why it is moral for a
Stanford woman to visit the
apartment (even a second story
apartment) of an off • campus
man, and immoral for her to visit
the upstairs ol a fraternity house,
was on the agenda.
Our hearsay information may
be entirely incorrect: we did hear
that there was a meeting, but we
did not see any report of it in the
Daily. We have also heard that
the Daily reporter was refused
admittance to the meeting.
We would like to know the fol
lowing :
1) Did the Administration re
fuse permission for the Daily to
report on the progress ol student
government debate on open
houses, by requiring this commit
tee to refuse admittance to the
Daily'
2) Has the Administration for
bidden the Daily to participate
further in the debate on open
houses?
3) Do committees discussing
rules, regulations, policies, and
legislation have the right to ex
dude the student body—and the
press—from their meetings 9 Last
year, the ASSU voted that persons
accused of Fundamental Standard
violations would be tried In se
cret, and we have noticed that the
Daily's nameless and disguised
reports of past years have been
discontinued this year.
But when did the ASSU grant
student bureaucrats who are not
discussing specific violators, but
rather policies and legislation, the

light to conduct their maneuvers
in secrecy?
In short, we would like to know
why the Daily acts so muzzled, li
is censored? Is il afraid to fight?
Is il cowed by Red Hots, and the
Administration?

Editor'?? Note: The adminis
tration lias not "forbidden" the
Daily to participate in these de
bates. VVe were refused permis
sion to attend Monday night's
meeting and are trying to open
the channels of communication
on such issues. However, we as
well as you, receive "hearsay
information" and we hesitate to
print such Information without
checking on it first. When the
ordinary channels are closed to
us, we have to find other ways
to get our information and you
may be sure we are looking for
them, especially in this particu
lar case. We Sought permission
for Monday's meeting on the
grounds that Information ob
tained would be used as back
ground for presenting the pros
and cons of the final decision,
but were still denied permission
by the agreement of the entire
committee.
Straw Mori
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorial, 'Stanford
"Girls,"' is logically drawn but
irrelevant, because it knock s
down a straw man. Reduced to
syllogism, it states: Whatever is
not immoral should be allowed
For Stanford girls to go upstairs
in men's residences is not irn
moral. Therefore, this should be
allowed.
The fault is that your major
premise states only hall the truth.
It should read: "Whatever is not
immoral should be allowed if, in
addition, it Is not Imprudent."
