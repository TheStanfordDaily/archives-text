Editor, The Daily:
We would like to agree whole
heartedly with the statement that
appeared in The Daily editorial on
Nov 19. "Immorality is not at all
concerned in going up the stairs
that lead to the second tloor of a
man's residence." Morality does
not depend on location It is a
matter ol action and attitude
However, Stanford University
does not exist in a social vacuum.
Accepted patterns ol behavior
vary over generations. And Stan
ford has the task ui establishing
itseit in a society whose members
are representative ol several gen
erations Stanford prides itseli on
its tine academic reputation The
reputation ol Stanford as a whole
will be damaged, ii Stanford's
social reputation is questionable
How is a social reputation de
termined? Once again, in large
part; through the outward mani
festation ol regulations. This can
not be denied, even though regu
lations per se are not a valid way
of determining the moral state
of a university.
University officials should not
he asked to condone regulations
that will jeopardize ihe position
of I lie university in society. Stan
ford's endowment fund pays 40.
percent ol the cost of educating
each one of us. Along Willi ac
cepting this gilt, we must accept
the responsibility it imposes to
maintain the university's fine rep
utation. II a student finds these
regulations unacceptable, he or
she may withdraw from the uni
versify. Attendance here is a priv

ilegp. ft is not mandatory.
And the students who do stay
will find that they are responsible
for their own moral standards.
Stanford women ate certainly
given ample freedom to conduct
themselves as they choose. Out
ol the 24 hours in the day, they
are only required to spend three
and a half (between 2:30 and
6 a m.) in the dorm. This does
not seem lo be unreasonable.
