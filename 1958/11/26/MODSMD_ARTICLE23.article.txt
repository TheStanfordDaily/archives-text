## Ignorance Keys Policy 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Finally, I must toll about what
Mr. K. Mad to say on tho subject
of disarmament, He came to it he
lore some of the passages whieh
1 have already reported, but it
has seemed 10 me less confusing
to the reader if 1 left it to the
end. He had been talking about
Turkey and asserting that our
military policy in the Middle East
was based <»n ignorance of the
real military situation, especially
upon the idea, which he attributed
specifically to General Norstad,
(hat Nato could go to the aid of
Turkey in the sense of landing
forces there in time of war.
Once again, lie was referring,
of course, to the command of
I lie short range missiles, and
this led hili) to say that all talk
about international inspection
and control of missiles was
"ridiculous."
Then he paused to say that the
Soviet Union had always believed
that it was possible to detect nu
clear explosions, and that it was
in principle agreed to work out a
system of detection. At this point
he turned to me and asked, did I
have any suggestions as to how
Soviet American relations could
bp improved?
To this I replied that while
iheie could be no solid improve
rnent until and unless solutions
were agreed to about Germany,
the Middle East and Eastern Asia,
success at the coming conference
on surprise attack would prob
ably do more than anything else
that was possible to relax the ten
sion in America. I reminded him
thai Pearl Harbor had had a pro
found and lasting effect on he
minds and feelings of Americans.
He replied that he understood
this. But the psychosis—that was

the word used in the translation
is being kept up by American
militarists so as to promote the;
manufacture of new weapons, 1
and thus to make profits. 1 might
say in parenthesis that in my ex
jierience in Moscow the belief is I
a universal dogma that profits I
are the compelling motive in
American armament.
Mr. K. added with n slightly
mischievous smile that even soap
manufacturers like Mr. McElroy
seemed to make profits out of
armaments. This A m e ii c a n
psychosis, he continued, is kept
up because Indies and the inili
tarists would not otherwise get
their appropriations.
Against this background here i
turned to the question ol in; pec
lion and control in relation, not to j
nuclear explosions but to surpi c:e J
attack and the reduction ol anna
raenis.
Why, he asked, do you begin
with inspection uiid controls?
Why do yon not by taking i
seriously our offer of ;t treaty
of friendship and iiOn aggies
sioli? I said we wanted sonic
tangible evidence (hat an agree
menl would he carried out.
He replied that the So vie)
Union could not agree to inspec |
tion and control until confidence, j
which is now lacking, has been
established.
I asked him then whether the
treaty of friendship should come
before a settlement of the tier

man question. His answer was
that the treaty is a question of
goodwill and that this never hurts
,i negotiation of other issues.
This concludes my report of the
interview with Mr. K. I must re
mind the reader that it is not
based on a transcript hut on my
memory and on the notes taken
by my wife and myself. It covers
ail the topics discussed in the
interview, and 1 have adhered as
strictly as I can to the rules of
the journalistic profession which
call for a report and interpreta
tion of what Mr. K. said, unadult
erated by my own opinions.
