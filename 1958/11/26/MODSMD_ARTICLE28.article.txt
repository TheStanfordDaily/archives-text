# ON THE LINE
## '58 Game Among Greatest 
### Bob Payne 
Now it's only Army-Navy and
the Bowl Games. And if there is
anyone out of the crowd of XI,4!M)
that saw Saturday's Big Came
who doesn't now agree thai cer
tainly this is the biggest of all
college rivalries, he wasn't watch
ing the game.
The 1f)24 and 1047 classics al
ways get top billing as the most
thrilling Big Games ever, but it's
our guess that 1958 will have to
be placed in that unforgettable
class, too.
It was unforgettable for Cali
fornia fans, if for nothing else,
because they finally saw their
Golden Bears win a Rose Bowl
trip after many long years. But
more so, Cal rooters can hardly
forget how they stood with their
hearts in their mouths and saw
the Bears throw back Stanford's
winning conversion bid.
Yes, the Biggesl of All
For Card fans there couldn't
have been much more of a thrill
than Joel Freis' touchdown grab
wiili one minute and 30 seconds
Jel l in I he game. Or, generally,
ihe tremendous performance of
the Cards all Ihe way. They lost
(or so Ihe records say), but it
was their greatest game.
Our thanks lo Oakland televi
sion station KTVIJ for showing
the entire game Saturday nighl
. . . that proved to the many thou
sands who couldn't see the game
in person lhal Stanford had won.
And already things are looking
up for next year. There is hope

I hat Kick McMillen will be around
lor a whole year; and he'll have
to battle off Skip Face for the job,
at that.
Good I.nek, Bears
Hilt California is the Rose Bowl
team. And good luck to the Hears
. . . because they'll need it.
Cal is somewhat in the same
position Oregon was in last year.
The Bears had their share of
squeakers 111-12 over Southern
Cal, 16-15 over Stanford, 20-17
over UCLA, 12- 7 over Washing
ton), and certainly hadn't estab
lished clear superiority over the
rest of I he Pacific Coast Confer
ence ... in the eyes of many.
Add 1o this losses to College of
the Pacific and Michigan Stale,
not exactly world-beaters this sea
son.
Last season Ihore was some
doubt as to Oregon's superiority.
The Ducks were outclassed by
lowly Washington and apparently
lucky to top Stanford, 27-20. and
Washington Stale, 14-13. But look
what happened in the Hose Bowl.
Oregon played heavily favored
(40 points in some camps) Ohio
State right off its feet before
dropping a heartbreaking 10-7
decision. Maybe the Bears can
rise to the occasion this year, too.
If so, it's going to be a matter
of a great deal of mental condi
tioning by Coach Pete Flliott . . .
because that was Oregon's secret
last year.
Big Ten Rugged
Certain elements contribute to
a Coast team's chances against a

Big Ten foe: tough, rugged for
ward wall; speed; and, most im
portant, depth. Cal has the speed;
hut Cal also has a light and very
thin forward wall, and only one
Joe Kapp,
There was no doubt last year
lhal Oregon had its hard-nosed
defense thai would battle any
body and a line at least two deep.
Not to mention ihe speed of Jack
.Morris and Jim Shanley.
IJSC, totally healthy, has the
elements . . . particularly a big.
rugged forward wall. WSC was
beginning to show amazing depth
and an even more amazing (for
them) tough defense. But neither
the Trojans nor the Cougars
j could handle the Bears, and so Cal
goes to Pasadena. With our luck.
"We Want a Bowl"
Losing ihe Rose Bowl bid does
n't seem to be halting the Con
gars, however. As phrased by j
their captain, Don Hllingscn: "We
want a howl game, any howl, and ;
we'll go anywhere to play one — j
even ( liina."
And while officials of Ihe !
Chow Mein Bowl, Ifong Kong, j
i have been alerled, Iwo insignifi
cant games called the Sugar Bowl
(New Orleans .Louisiana) and the
Gator Bowl (Jacksonville, Flor
ida) have openly expressed inter
est in obliging the Cougars.
"All the players feel we're Ihe
best team in the West right now,"
says Lllingsen), "even better than
< alilornia. We want to prove it."
Wo can think of more gentle
I ways lo prove it than against top
ranked Louisiana Slate, which
I would he Iheir foe in Ihe Sugar
Bowl . . . bul a healthy Boh New
man, and all his ends, could put
on a real show in Oixie.

Add 1o this losses to College of
the Pacific and Michigan Stale,
not exactly world-beaters this sea
son.
Last season Ihore was some
doubt as to Oregon's superiority.
The Ducks were outclassed by
lowly Washington and apparently
lucky to top Stanford, 27-20. and
Washington Stale, 14-13. But look
what happened in the Hose Bowl.
Oregon played heavily favored
(40 points in some camps) Ohio
State right off its feet before
dropping a heartbreaking 10-7
decision. Maybe the Bears can
rise to the occasion this year, too.
If so, it's going to be a matter
of a great deal of mental condi
tioning by Coach Pete Flliott . . .
because that was Oregon's secret
last year.
Big Ten Rugged
Certain elements contribute to
a Coast team's chances against a

Big Ten foe: tough, rugged for
ward wall; speed; and, most im
portant, depth. Cal has the speed;
hut Cal also has a light and very
thin forward wall, and only one
Joe Kapp,
There was no doubt last year
lhal Oregon had its hard-nosed
defense thai would battle any
body and a line at least two deep.
Not to mention ihe speed of Jack
.Morris and Jim Shanley.
IJSC, totally healthy, has the
elements . . . particularly a big.
rugged forward wall. WSC was
beginning to show amazing depth
and an even more amazing (for
them) tough defense. But neither
the Trojans nor the Cougars
j could handle the Bears, and so Cal
goes to Pasadena. With our luck.
"We Want a Bowl"
Losing ihe Rose Bowl bid does
n't seem to be halting the Con
gars, however. As phrased by j
their captain, Don Hllingscn: "We
want a howl game, any howl, and ;
we'll go anywhere to play one — j
even ( liina."
And while officials of Ihe !
Chow Mein Bowl, Ifong Kong, j
i have been alerled, Iwo insignifi
cant games called the Sugar Bowl
(New Orleans .Louisiana) and the
Gator Bowl (Jacksonville, Flor
ida) have openly expressed inter
est in obliging the Cougars.
"All the players feel we're Ihe
best team in the West right now,"
says Lllingsen), "even better than
< alilornia. We want to prove it."
Wo can think of more gentle
I ways lo prove it than against top
ranked Louisiana Slate, which
I would he Iheir foe in Ihe Sugar
Bowl . . . bul a healthy Boh New
man, and all his ends, could put
on a real show in Oixie.
Now it's only Army-Navy and
the Bowl Games. And if there is
anyone out of the crowd of XI,4!M)
that saw Saturday's Big Came
who doesn't now agree thai cer
tainly this is the biggest of all
college rivalries, he wasn't watch
ing the game.
The 1f)24 and 1047 classics al
ways get top billing as the most
thrilling Big Games ever, but it's
our guess that 1958 will have to
be placed in that unforgettable
class, too.
It was unforgettable for Cali
fornia fans, if for nothing else,
because they finally saw their
Golden Bears win a Rose Bowl
trip after many long years. But
more so, Cal rooters can hardly
forget how they stood with their
hearts in their mouths and saw
the Bears throw back Stanford's
winning conversion bid.
Yes, the Biggesl of All
For Card fans there couldn't
have been much more of a thrill
than Joel Freis' touchdown grab

ihe tremendous performance of
the Cards all Ihe way. They lost
(or so Ihe records say), but it
was their greatest game.
Our thanks lo Oakland televi

the entire game Saturday nighl
. . . that proved to the many thou
sands who couldn't see the game

And already things are looking
up for next year. There is hope

I hat Kick McMillen will be around

And while officials of Ihe !

The 1f)24 and 1047 classics al

our guess that 1958 will have to
be placed in that unforgettable
class, too.
It was unforgettable for Cali
fornia fans, if for nothing else,
because they finally saw their
Golden Bears win a Rose Bowl
trip after many long years. But
more so, Cal rooters can hardly
forget how they stood with their
hearts in their mouths and saw
the Bears throw back Stanford's
winning conversion bid.
Yes, the Biggesl of All
For Card fans there couldn't
have been much more of a thrill
than Joel Freis' touchdown grab
wiili one minute and 30 seconds
Jel l in I he game. Or, generally,
ihe tremendous performance of
the Cards all Ihe way. They lost
(or so Ihe records say), but it
was their greatest game.
Our thanks lo Oakland televi
sion station KTVIJ for showing
the entire game Saturday nighl
. . . that proved to the many thou
sands who couldn't see the game
in person lhal Stanford had won.
And already things are looking
up for next year. There is hope

I hat Kick McMillen will be around
lor a whole year; and he'll have
to battle off Skip Face for the job,
at that.
Good I.nek, Bears
Hilt California is the Rose Bowl
team. And good luck to the Hears
. . . because they'll need it.
Cal is somewhat in the same
position Oregon was in last year.
The Bears had their share of
squeakers 111-12 over Southern
Cal, 16-15 over Stanford, 20-17
over UCLA, 12- 7 over Washing
ton), and certainly hadn't estab
lished clear superiority over the
rest of I he Pacific Coast Confer
ence ... in the eyes of many.
Add 1o this losses to College of
the Pacific and Michigan Stale,
not exactly world-beaters this sea
son.
Last season Ihore was some
doubt as to Oregon's superiority.
The Ducks were outclassed by
lowly Washington and apparently
lucky to top Stanford, 27-20. and
Washington Stale, 14-13. But look
what happened in the Hose Bowl.
Oregon played heavily favored
(40 points in some camps) Ohio
State right off its feet before
dropping a heartbreaking 10-7
decision. Maybe the Bears can
rise to the occasion this year, too.
If so, it's going to be a matter
of a great deal of mental condi
tioning by Coach Pete Flliott . . .
because that was Oregon's secret
last year.
Big Ten Rugged
Certain elements contribute to
a Coast team's chances against a

Big Ten foe: tough, rugged for
ward wall; speed; and, most im
portant, depth. Cal has the speed;
hut Cal also has a light and very
thin forward wall, and only one
Joe Kapp,
There was no doubt last year
lhal Oregon had its hard-nosed
defense thai would battle any
body and a line at least two deep.
Not to mention ihe speed of Jack
.Morris and Jim Shanley.
IJSC, totally healthy, has the
elements . . . particularly a big.
rugged forward wall. WSC was
beginning to show amazing depth
and an even more amazing (for
them) tough defense. But neither
the Trojans nor the Cougars
j could handle the Bears, and so Cal
goes to Pasadena. With our luck.
"We Want a Bowl"
Losing ihe Rose Bowl bid does
n't seem to be halting the Con
gars, however. As phrased by j
their captain, Don Hllingscn: "We
want a howl game, any howl, and ;
we'll go anywhere to play one — j
