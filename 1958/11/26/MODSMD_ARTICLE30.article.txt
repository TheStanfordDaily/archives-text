# DALLMAR ON FORWARDS:
## Aggressiveness, Please! 
### 
(Editor's Note: This con
cludes Sports Editor Steve Baf-
J'rey's analysis of (bis year's
varsity basketball squad.)
There'll he a great tale partly
told when Howie Dallmar's 1959
basketball squad takes the floor
against the San Jose State Spar
tans next Monday night at 8 in
the Pavilion. That tale will cen
ter on how the Stanford forwards
will perform this year.
No one is lost to the squad at
this position, and the forwards
should turn out to be a good
shooting grup. Dallmar feels his
front men have good basketball
savvy though a little more aggres
siveness in their defensive play
would make him feel a lot easier
about his club.
Arrillaga, Thuesen Starters
The club's starters will be John
Arrillaga and Jerry Thuesen.
Both these fellows were team
leaders last year. Arrillaga led
the club in field goal attempts
(302), field goals made < 120), to
tal points <290i and average
points (12.33).
Thuesen topped the local squad
and the Pacific Coast in free
throw shooting with an 80.9 per

centage.
Arrillaga stands 6-4, weighs 100
and is a junior in eligibility, 110
has overcome a health problem
which bothered him last season,
though he did play in 24 of the
club's 2f> games. On a Riven night
he can be murder. USF fans will
remember his last-seconds basket
which gave the Indians a 5049
victory over the Dons last year.
Other clubs will remember his
aggressive, scrappy ball playing.
Arrillaga lacks jumping ability,
though he must be considered ex
tremely dangerous.
(â– oori Shot
Thuesen, a junior, 0-7, 171
pounds, has what coaches and
fans alike have caled a "wonder
fill touch." He's a good shooter,
though he, too, must improve his
rebounding. Has good reactions,
though he lacks stamina and
strength. This lack has made him
a shade under consistent.
Mike Tipton and John Hendry
complete the forward nomina
t ions.
