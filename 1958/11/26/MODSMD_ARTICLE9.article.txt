# Religions Co-operate In Germany
## 
### 
The extreme degree of co opera
tion among the Catholic and the
Protestant religious in Germany
was emphasized by Dr. Erik Flit
ter von Kuehnelt-Leddihn Tues
day in a talk presented by the
Council on Religious Affairs.
The Austrian lecturer said that
the words "Protestant" and
"Catholic" have been changed to
"Evangelist Christian" and "Cath
olic Christian" in Germany today,
the former being almost entirely
Lutheran.
Evidences of the religious col
laborat ion in Germ a ny since
World War II may be seen on the
political, social and theological
levels.
A striking example of political
unity is the "gentlemen's agree
ment" in the government that if
the President of Germany is a
Catholic, the Chancellor must be
a Lutheran, and vice versa.

ferences. Kuehnelt - Leddihn em
phasized that members of both
religions read each other's publi
cations and thus are familiar with
each other's beliefs.
"There is absolutely no relativ
ism," he said.
Even a liturgical meeting
ground may be evidenced, as Lu
theran hymns are sung in the
Catholic churches and the Prot
estants sing "To Drums," Build

Co-operation
Co-operation such as this is im
possible in the United States for
several reasons, Kuehnelt - Led
dihn states. A major one is the
"round table" of religions in
America as opposed to the
"square table" of two religions in
Germany. A second reason is the
Catholic fear that unity can lead
to religious indifference.
