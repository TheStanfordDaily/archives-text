# Pizzas, Rowdy Pals Dividing Liberaces

### 
HOLLYWOOD (/IN — Frozen Pizza, fteeloading pals and 100
much teal estate are breaking up the Liberace family—Lee, George
and Mom.
Mrs, Frances Liberace says she's refused to watch Lee's tele
vision show since he parted a year ago with brother George. She
adds:
"His home in Palm Springs is a night club. lie's surrounded by
hillbillies and freeloaders. One of these days, Lee will wind up
broke and these characters won't even buy him a sandwich if he's
starving."
Mrs. Liberace, an independent soul, lives alone in Lee's lavish
Sherman Oaks mansion complete with piano-shaped swimming
pool. "We arc simple people from Wisconsin," she told a reporter.
"He has four houses in Palm Springs. You can only live in one
house at a time.
"Give me the old bankbook. That's what counts. When you crt
hungry, you can't take a hunk of wood out of an empty house and
buy bread with it."
The three still speak, but Mrs. Liberace left no doubt that the
words are often bitter.
His mother said George resented Loe singing a calypso song on
a recent TV show. The song followed a question by a woman in
the studio audience who asked: "Where's George?"
The song said George is in the frozen pizza business. George
says this is a sideline. "I definitely still am in show business."
From Palm Springs, Lee said that George quit him of his own
volition. Mama, however, states that "poor George couldn't stand
any more pushing around."
