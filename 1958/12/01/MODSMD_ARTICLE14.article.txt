## Communists Shattered In Gaulist Party Victory 
### 
PARIS (A*)— Jacques Soustelle's right-wing Gaullist party emerged
triumphantly Monday as Frence's biggest postwar political group.
Communist strength was reduced to ashes in the Assembly, al
though the Reds retained roughly 20 per cent of the popular vote.
More moderate opponents of Premier Charles de Gaulle were all
but wiped out. The biggest previous postwar party strength in a

French Parliament was 174 seats
held by the Communists in 1946.
The Communists had the biggest
bloc in the last parliament.
Sent to defeat in the Gaullist
sweep was Jacques Duclos, bril
liant floor leader of the robust
Communist party bloc that num
bered 149 in the last Assembly.
The vote tabulations trimmed the
Communist seats to less than 10
per cent of their former holdings.
Soustelle's grouping is the Un
ion for the New Republic—UNß
—a hodgepodge collection which
tied itself to a reluctant De Gaulle.
The Premier had tried to keep out
of the elections personally.
Parliamentary Results
Interior Minister Emile Pelle
tier gave the following results for
464 of the 463 parliamentary scats
in metropolitan France:
Union for the New Republic,
187; Independents - Peasants, 120;
Catholic Popular Republican
Movement, 44; Socialists, 40; Rad
ical Socialists, 13; Christian Dem
ocrats, 13; Communists, 10; di
verse leftist parties, 10; diverse
rightist parties, 27.
The new National Assembly will
have 546 members. Ten are being
elected from overseas depart
ments and 71 from Algeria and
the departments of the Sahara.
Agreed on Algeria
Soustelle's new Union contains
some old political faces and a col
lection of newcomers, united on
one basic point—continuation of
French rule in Algeria under De
Gaulle.
The UNR's position on France's
grave economic problems and in
ternational policy has not been
clearly defined. Some of the sen
timent in the UNR is clearly less
liberal than De Gaulle's thinking
on the Algerian question.
Soustelle himself was the politi
cal brains behind the rightist re
volt of European settlers and
army officers in Algeria in May.
He, with his followers iti Algeria,
insists on closer ties between Al
geria and metropolitan France.
In pointedly remaining aloof
from the campaign. De Gaulle ap
peared lo be troubled over the
sharp swing to Ihe right and the
virtual obliteration of a moderat
ing counterweight in the Fifth Re
public's first National Assembly.
Flushed with triumph, Sous
telle told reporters: "This is a vic
tory of the national parties over
the Communists. People voted
for a centrist formation in which
all the political families co exist."
He did not mention De Gaulle in
his statement.
Ailing Communist Secretary
General Maurice Thorez was re
elected, but with a smaller ma
jority than in 1956. His wife,
Jeannette Vermcehsch, who has
frequently spoken for him during
his periods of illness in recent
years, was defeated.
