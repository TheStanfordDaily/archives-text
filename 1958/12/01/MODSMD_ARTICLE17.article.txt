## The 						Lost Class

"The new voices in the school
closed communities must be
heard. And they nnist be ans
wered with truths. The cliche
that states' rights must be won
now or lost forever is not the
truth. The shibboleth that the
Supreme Court's order may be
legally ignored is not the truth.
The myth tiiat Virginia is in
contest with alien forces is not
the truth. The truth is that Vir
ginia can open all the schools
and cannot with justice and
good sense keep them closed.
Virginia and its children need
their schools."
This editorial from the Norfolk
Virginian-Pilot is quoted in the
Nuv. 22 issue of Nation in an
article, "Lost Class of '59" by
Dan Wakefield.
Some weeks ago we editorial
ized that the great tragedy of the
current segregation issue is that
the blow falls upon education.
Wakefield's article about the situ
ation in Virginia reconfirms our
belief. Wakefield points out that
"the Virginians who feel that this
heritage \ public education] is
more valuable than the heritage
of white supremacy are fighting
to convince the public, but they
admit they are fighting uphill."
The initial shock of the school
closing has worn off, says Wake
field; students are getting an edu
cation of sorts through a tutoring
program. But the Norfolk Virgin
ian-Pilot surveyed the 1,037 Nor
folk seniors and found that "just
under half" of them may not re
turn to schools, even if they were
to be reopened this year. "Some
have gotten jobs, some have got
ten married, some have joined
the service, some have just
'drifted'."
The Norfolk teachers are pro

testing the school closing as best
they can, but the Norfolk city
council, which is in a position to
do something about the crisis,
though no one is sure quite what,
is unwilling to move because its
members wish to stay in favor
with the electorate.
Meanwhile, as politicians try
to stay in office, the class of
'59 is becoming more and more
"lost."
In the editorial column of this
month's N'ation, the editor notes
that parking problems seem to be
engufing campuses throughout
the country. With tongue-in-cheek,
Nation makes this suggestion:
"To raze all engineering schools
to make way tor parking areas.
After that, time will cure the
problem; no engineering schools,
no engineers; no engineers, no
cars; no cars, no parking problem
â€” for students or anyone else.
A flood (or perhaps just a
more publicized flood) of "aca
demic books has hit the market.
In our office we've received
copies of "The Academic Mind"
and "Some of My Best Friends
are Professors," and are sched
uled to receive "The Academic
Marketplace." The former two
are in the hands of our re
viewers now, and we hope to
present them to our readers
shortly.
A recent anthology of mystery
stories has reached our desk and
among its pages is a short story,
"Murder for Fine Arts," written
by a Stanford graduate still asso
ciated with the university, John
Bayse Price. The anthology is en
titled "A Choice of Murders" and
is published by Charles Scribner's
Sons. Price received his A.8.,
A.M., and Ph.D from Stanford in
biology.
