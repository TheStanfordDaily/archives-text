Problems Please
Editor, The Dally:
We note — with increasing in
credulousness and subsequent dis
may—that for two solid weeks
the Daily editorials have concern
ed themselves with the upshot of
the mass exodus at the USC game.
We began with the anguished
alumni letters, proceeded to the
moral overtones of the incident
(including such term-dropping as
"honor," "dignity" and "self - re
spect") and —with Monday's edi
torial — reached the pseudo-pious
exhortation to don the "Red and
White" and lick red lollipops, as
a sort of penance for sin com
mitted.
Okay, you guys. We realize that
the real issue at hand is the hoary
old head of Apathy, which has
suddenly raised itself in appall
ingly overt fashion. Okay.
We might suggest that, rather
than shoving the Big Red Machine
down our disinterested throats,
The Daily might more profitably
have considered the source of the
apathy; i.e., perhaps it is indica
tive of a change of emphasis at
Stanford, requiring a re - evalua
tion of our insistence on the value
of Hero-of-the-Beach activities.
We might further suggest, since
school spirit apparently involves
moral responsibility, that the po
sition of the University's newspa
per also involves responsibility,
not the least of which is to observe
the standard journalistic practice
of signing guest editorials.
Thie more obvious responsibility
—that of discussing questions per
tinent to the interests of the Uni
versity as an academic and admin
istrative whole—has been disre
garded.
If we are to ignore the Outside
World, it is conceivable that we
might address ourselves to the
more flagrant problems within the
University, such as the proposed
Undergraduate Library, the farce
of student government, the hous
ing policy, and the intriguing new
possibility of a Statler Hotel on
Quad.
Being rational souls, we l-ealize
that a detailed investigation of
these subjects is unthinkable until
the sweat has dried off the foot

bail team, and the lollipop sticks
are all safely incinerated.
Next quarter, however, Provi
dence and Rally Com willing, the
basketball team might —it just
might—remain resplendent on the
sports page, be it ever so inglo
rious.

Editor, The Daily:
In view of your exhortations on
Red and White Day, I feel im
pelled to comment upon the ex
traordinary concept of "spirit"
that you seek to purvey in your
newspaper. You make it sound
like a magic cloak—as if it could
be visibly constructed, purchased
and wrapped up, ready for any
normal, healthy Stanford under
graduate to don.
111-contrived and laboriously-ac
quired spirit is. in my opinion, far
worse than none at all. There is
no more miserable spectacle than
people desperately determined to
enjoy themselves at all cost.
Red and White Day, by virtue
of the very fact that it is assigned
a date on the calendar, can only
be limited in value. Does it not
tacitly admit that all the other
364 dates in the year are not Red
and White?
When students feel sincerely
and genuinely for an institution,
they express their loyalty sponta
neously, especially under unusual
circumstances of rivalry such as
Big Game Week provides.
It is for this reason that super
ficial whoops of superiority (such
as you advocate) in the closing
minutes of lost fotball games tend
to resemble death rites rather
than the desired war chant. The
cheers I hope we hear on Satur
day will not derive from any writ
ten admonishment.
If the spirit is there, it will
show itself, and more obviously;
if it is not, let's forget about the
flimsy facades. Anyone who sug
gests that Stanford lacks spirit
has not looked very far. The trou
ble is, perhaps, that he has been
blinded by those who try so fever
ishly hard.
