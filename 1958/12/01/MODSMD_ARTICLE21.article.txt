# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Reds Leading in Orient 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
(This is another in a series of
articles written after a recent
visit to Moscow.)
In almost all the talks T had in
Moscow, not only witli Mr. K. but
with other officials and with So
viet editors, I was asked what
could be done to bring about bet
ter- relations between our two
countries.
The question is a hard one to
answer. For the basic issue be
tween us arises from the fact that
the Soviet Union, and now along
side it Red China, are well on
their way to achieving the leader
ship of Asia and of Africa. At the
root of the profound and abiding
suspicion which each of us has
for the other lies this bid for lead
ership and its challenge- to the
Western position and to Western
influence.
There is no reason to think
that the suspicion which divides
us, and makes even modest and
partial solutions difficult, can
easily be talked out of exis
tence. Although I am one of
those who hopes earnestly that
the rivalry can be kept below
the boiling point, 1 am, never
theless, convinced that even
this will require a lot more than
mutual expressions of good
will.
The cause of the bad relations
is the suspicion, felt on each side
of the Iron Curtain, that the other
side intends to commit aggres
sion. The suspicion arises from a
belief that in the long run neither
side can tolerate the other.
The Soviet Union is now enter
ing upon the climatic years—the
next seven or ten years—in which
it means to surpass the United
States, not in the material com
forts of ordinary life but in pro
ductivity per capita. The Com
munist leaders are certain that
as they achieve this goal, the
great mass of the poorer and un
developed peoples will rally to
them. No doubt, wherever they
can, they will promote this rally
by propaganda and by infiltration
and by subversion.
But we delude ourselves if we
do not realize that the main
power of the Communist states
lies not in their clandestine acti
vity hut in the force of their ex
ample, in the visible demonsta
tion of what the Soviet Union
has achieved in forty years, of
what Red China has achieved hi
about ten years.
The inner moving force of So
viet suspicion is the belief that
the United States and the govern
ments of the non-Communist
countries will, unless compelled
to do so, never allow Russia and
China to consummate the revolu
tion which they are leading in
Asia and in Africa. In Moscow,
and no doubt also in Peiping, they
do not believe us when we insist
that the rearming of Germany
and of Turkey and the mainten
ance of a ring of air bases are
defensive measures against mili
tary aggression on their part.

For they are certain in their
own minds that they will win
the primacy of Asia and of
Africa not by going to war but
by avoiding a war that would
ruin their economic achieve
ments. They are, like most men,
self-centered and they cannot
believe that we really think
they will commit military ag
gression when they themselves
are so sure tliat they must
avoid a war.
So when we talk about defen
sive armaments they think we are
deceiving them, that our military
policy is to surround them in pre
paration for an attack on them in
order to halt their revolutionary
rise to world leadership.
1 am reasonably sure that 1 his
is the way they see the military
issue between us. Moreover, this
is what the prophet Lenin prop
hesied, and in the Soviet Union
the authority of Lenin, as current
ly interpreted by the powers that
be, is treated as infallible and
more than human. Our policy of
military containment with its for
ward positions on their own bor
ders is in their minds conclusive
proof that Lenin was right. They
suspect us profoundly, and that
is why they are stubbornly reluc
tant to negotiate any concession
which would give us even a slight
tactical, much less a strategic, ad
vantage in case of war.
In this resistance to agreement
with us they are helped by many
provocative and bellicose things
that have been said at one time
or another by the talkative brass
in the Pentagon. They are hard
ened also in their convictions, it
must be said, by the propensity
of Mr. Dulles, and in lesser degree
of the President himself, to treat
the conflict, not as one of empires
and great states but as a religious
war in which the contending posi
tions are absolute. For this con
firms their view that we are brac
ing ourselves for an ideological
or religious war, that this war
will take place unless they make
themselves so powerful that it
cannot take place.
The corresponding suspicion

on our side arises, as we know,
from the belief that insofar us
the Soviet Union and Ked China
gain in military power, they are
certainly bound to use it as an
instrument,of policy in order to
complete their domination id'
Asia and of Africa. This suspic
ion is, I have no doubt, well
founded and it is a conclusive
reason for making sure thai we
do not lose the race of arma
ments.

theless, convinced that even
this will require a lot more than
mutual expressions of good
will.
The cause of the bad relations
is the suspicion, felt on each side
of the Iron Curtain, that the other
side intends to commit aggres
sion. The suspicion arises from a
belief that in the long run neither
side can tolerate the other.
The Soviet Union is now enter
ing upon the climatic years—the
next seven or ten years—in which
it means to surpass the United
States, not in the material com
forts of ordinary life but in pro
ductivity per capita. The Com
munist leaders are certain that
as they achieve this goal, the
great mass of the poorer and un
developed peoples will rally to
them. No doubt, wherever they
can, they will promote this rally
by propaganda and by infiltration
and by subversion.
But we delude ourselves if we
do not realize that the main
power of the Communist states
lies not in their clandestine acti
vity hut in the force of their ex
ample, in the visible demonsta
tion of what the Soviet Union
has achieved in forty years, of
what Red China has achieved hi
about ten years.
The inner moving force of So
viet suspicion is the belief that
the United States and the govern
ments of the non-Communist
countries will, unless compelled
to do so, never allow Russia and
China to consummate the revolu
tion which they are leading in
Asia and in Africa. In Moscow,
and no doubt also in Peiping, they
do not believe us when we insist
that the rearming of Germany
and of Turkey and the mainten
ance of a ring of air bases are
defensive measures against mili
tary aggression on their part.

For they are certain in their
own minds that they will win
the primacy of Asia and of
Africa not by going to war but
by avoiding a war that would
ruin their economic achieve
ments. They are, like most men,
self-centered and they cannot
believe that we really think
they will commit military ag
gression when they themselves
are so sure tliat they must
avoid a war.
So when we talk about defen
sive armaments they think we are
deceiving them, that our military
policy is to surround them in pre
paration for an attack on them in
order to halt their revolutionary
rise to world leadership.
1 am reasonably sure that 1 his
is the way they see the military
issue between us. Moreover, this
is what the prophet Lenin prop
hesied, and in the Soviet Union
the authority of Lenin, as current
ly interpreted by the powers that
be, is treated as infallible and
more than human. Our policy of
military containment with its for
ward positions on their own bor
ders is in their minds conclusive
proof that Lenin was right. They
suspect us profoundly, and that
is why they are stubbornly reluc
tant to negotiate any concession
which would give us even a slight
tactical, much less a strategic, ad
vantage in case of war.
In this resistance to agreement
with us they are helped by many
provocative and bellicose things
that have been said at one time
or another by the talkative brass
in the Pentagon. They are hard
ened also in their convictions, it
must be said, by the propensity
of Mr. Dulles, and in lesser degree
of the President himself, to treat
the conflict, not as one of empires
and great states but as a religious
war in which the contending posi
tions are absolute. For this con
firms their view that we are brac
ing ourselves for an ideological
or religious war, that this war
will take place unless they make
themselves so powerful that it
cannot take place.
The corresponding suspicion

on our side arises, as we know,
from the belief that insofar us
the Soviet Union and Ked China
gain in military power, they are
certainly bound to use it as an
instrument,of policy in order to
complete their domination id'
Asia and of Africa. This suspic
ion is, I have no doubt, well
founded and it is a conclusive
reason for making sure thai we
do not lose the race of arma
ments.

In almost all the talks T had in
Moscow, not only witli Mr. K. but
with other officials and with So
viet editors, I was asked what
could be done to bring about bet
ter- relations between our two
countries.
The question is a hard one to
answer. For the basic issue be
tween us arises from the fact that
the Soviet Union, and now along
side it Red China, are well on
their way to achieving the leader
ship of Asia and of Africa. At the
root of the profound and abiding
suspicion which each of us has
for the other lies this bid for lead
ership and its challenge- to the
Western position and to Western
influence.
There is no reason to think
that the suspicion which divides
us, and makes even modest and
partial solutions difficult, can
easily be talked out of exis
tence. Although I am one of
those who hopes earnestly that
the rivalry can be kept below
the boiling point, 1 am, never

has achieved in forty years, of
what Red China has achieved hi
about ten years.
The inner moving force of So
viet suspicion is the belief that
the United States and the govern
ments of the non-Communist
countries will, unless compelled
to do so, never allow Russia and
China to consummate the revolu
tion which they are leading in
Asia and in Africa. In Moscow,
and no doubt also in Peiping, they
do not believe us when we insist
that the rearming of Germany
and of Turkey and the mainten
ance of a ring of air bases are
defensive measures against mili
tary aggression on their part.

For they are certain in their
own minds that they will win
the primacy of Asia and of
Africa not by going to war but
by avoiding a war that would
ruin their economic achieve
ments. They are, like most men,
self-centered and they cannot
believe that we really think
they will commit military ag
gression when they themselves
are so sure tliat they must
avoid a war.
So when we talk about defen
sive armaments they think we are
deceiving them, that our military
policy is to surround them in pre
paration for an attack on them in
order to halt their revolutionary
rise to world leadership.
1 am reasonably sure that 1 his
is the way they see the military
issue between us. Moreover, this
is what the prophet Lenin prop
hesied, and in the Soviet Union
the authority of Lenin, as current
ly interpreted by the powers that
be, is treated as infallible and
more than human. Our policy of
military containment with its for
ward positions on their own bor
ders is in their minds conclusive
proof that Lenin was right. They
suspect us profoundly, and that
is why they are stubbornly reluc
tant to negotiate any concession
which would give us even a slight
tactical, much less a strategic, ad
vantage in case of war.
In this resistance to agreement
with us they are helped by many
provocative and bellicose things
that have been said at one time
or another by the talkative brass
in the Pentagon. They are hard
ened also in their convictions, it
must be said, by the propensity
of Mr. Dulles, and in lesser degree
of the President himself, to treat
the conflict, not as one of empires
and great states but as a religious
war in which the contending posi
tions are absolute. For this con
firms their view that we are brac
ing ourselves for an ideological
or religious war, that this war
will take place unless they make
themselves so powerful that it
cannot take place.
The corresponding suspicion

on our side arises, as we know,
from the belief that insofar us
the Soviet Union and Ked China
gain in military power, they are
certainly bound to use it as an
instrument,of policy in order to
complete their domination id'
Asia and of Africa. This suspic
ion is, I have no doubt, well
founded and it is a conclusive
reason for making sure thai we
do not lose the race of arma
ments.
(This is another in a series of
articles written after a recent
visit to Moscow.)
In almost all the talks T had in
Moscow, not only witli Mr. K. but
with other officials and with So
viet editors, I was asked what
could be done to bring about bet
ter- relations between our two
countries.
The question is a hard one to
answer. For the basic issue be
tween us arises from the fact that
the Soviet Union, and now along
side it Red China, are well on
their way to achieving the leader
ship of Asia and of Africa. At the
root of the profound and abiding
suspicion which each of us has
for the other lies this bid for lead
ership and its challenge- to the
Western position and to Western
influence.
There is no reason to think
that the suspicion which divides
us, and makes even modest and
partial solutions difficult, can
easily be talked out of exis
tence. Although I am one of
those who hopes earnestly that
the rivalry can be kept below
the boiling point, 1 am, never
theless, convinced that even
this will require a lot more than
mutual expressions of good
will.
The cause of the bad relations
is the suspicion, felt on each side
of the Iron Curtain, that the other
side intends to commit aggres
sion. The suspicion arises from a
belief that in the long run neither
side can tolerate the other.
The Soviet Union is now enter
ing upon the climatic years—the
next seven or ten years—in which
it means to surpass the United
States, not in the material com
forts of ordinary life but in pro
ductivity per capita. The Com
munist leaders are certain that
as they achieve this goal, the
great mass of the poorer and un
developed peoples will rally to
them. No doubt, wherever they
can, they will promote this rally
by propaganda and by infiltration
and by subversion.
But we delude ourselves if we
do not realize that the main
power of the Communist states
lies not in their clandestine acti
vity hut in the force of their ex
ample, in the visible demonsta
tion of what the Soviet Union
has achieved in forty years, of
what Red China has achieved hi
about ten years.
