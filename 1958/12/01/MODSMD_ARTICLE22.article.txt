(Editor's Note: This is the first
of a series of analyses of I'CC
basketball clubs which will appear
in the Daily this week.)

Tilings look very good for the
bask e tb a 1 1 fans of the Los
Angeles area as the 1958-59 bas
ketball season whirls into its first
week.
The two hometown schools,
USC and UCLA, are both rated as
strong contenders for the final
PCC basketball title, and both
teams are loaded with talent to
substantiate the early season
ratings given them.
USC, which was primarily a
team of sophomores last year,
will have a large number of re
turning letterman in this year's
lineup. The big man in the Tro
jans' attack figures to be 6-7 Jim
Hanna. Hanna, a junior, is one of
the toughest big men in college
basketball. He is a rugged re
bounder and is able to hook with
either hand.
Good Driver
On top of this he is an out
standing driver. The only thing
which hampered Hanna last year
and which might hold him back
is the lack of a real basketball
touch.
Jim White will be the number
two scorer behind Hanna, White
is 6-3, and as a sophomore last
year did a. fine job at a forward
spot for the Trojans.
6-5 senior Phil Dye, 0-5 Mike
Fryer, a sophomore, 6-6 Hill Led
ger, and 61 Steve Kemp all are
possible players to move into that
forward spot.
Three guards will be in batt
ling for the two openings in the
backcourt and these three men
are Jerry Pimm, John Werhas,
and Bill Bloom.
On the SC bench will be seven
foot sophomore Bill Engessor.
Engessor should prove more than
adequate as a reserve for Hanna.
Other reserves the Trojans will
have are Will Carlton, 0-8 Doug
Clements, and Bob Hampton,
legibility Trouble
Across the smoggy city, at the
Westwood campus, UCLA ap
pears to have a tough squad, pro
vided all the hoopsters can stay
eligible.
Warnell Jones, C 10 sophomore
center, looks like the man who
might lead the Bruins to a con
ference championship. Jones
averaged 16 points per game as a
freshman last year and has been
referred to as "the Octopus"
when it comes to rebounding.
Put Jones under the boards
along with high jumper Walt
Torrence a mere 6-3, and Roland
Underhill, and it looks like the
Uclans have a pretty fair re
hounding platoon.
At guard the Westwood team
has Denny Crum, a solid veteran,
and Olympic Decathlon champ
Rafer Johnson.
For reserve strength, the UCLA
has returning letterman Denny
Miller, Cliff Brandon, Bob Bell,
and Bob Archer.

State.)
