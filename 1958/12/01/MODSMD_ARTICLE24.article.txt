# Soccer Ends Against UBC
## 
### 
In its final appearance of the
1958 season the Stanford Varsity
Soccer team squares off against
the University of British Colum
bia today at 1:30 p.m. at Maloney
Field.
The Indians, whose record now
stands at 3-4-1, will find the going
rough against a rugged ÜBC out
fit. Stanford last weekend
dropped a tough game to Califor
nia, 3-2.
The Indians look to their two
outstanding stars, goalie Bill
Dittman and inside right Dick
Bartlett, for strong performances
against ÜBC. These two men have
paced the squad all year and are
possible All-American selections.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle al
back Dan Farthing as an accom
so recognizes freshman left full
lished booter and a future All-
America.
After starting the season
strongly with several wins, the
Indians found they ran into
trouble against the California Ag
gies, City College of San Fran
cisco, and California. The squad
would like nothing better than
to close the season with a victory,
and feel that they are overdue in
the winning column.
