### Dick Barnes 
The mighy mite of USC, Max
! Truex, broke the Stanford Golf
Course Cross-Country record by
more than 4U seconds Saturday as
he led his Trojans to an upset vic
tory in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship meet.
Truex whipped over the 4.1
mile distance in 20:15.8 to belter
his own mark of 20:50, set earlier
this year. Stanford's Keith Wal
lace was also well under the old
record, his second-place 20:25
leading the Indians to the runner
up team finish.
Pinal scores were I JSC 39, Stan
ford -1 IS, Oregon 53, Idaho 57,
UCLA 38, California 66 Washing*
ton 111, and Oregon State lis.
Grelle Fails
Shock of the race was the fail
ure of Oregon's Jim (belle. After
running second for two and one
half miles, Cirelle dropped to third
for half a mile, then faded com
pletely out of the race.
With Cirelle went Oregon's
hopes for winning the team liile
it was expected to gain.
The come-through performance
of Fernando Leon, who ran sev
enth, was the key factor to I JSC's
i eventual victory. Failure 1o get a
I fourth man higher than 251 h hurl
I Stanford's chances, as the Indians
were the first team lo have its
third man across the finish line.
Husky Surprises
Ernie Brannon of Washington
was a surprise early pace-setter.
He went to the fronl by as much
as 20 yards, but began to fade
after the first mile.
Truex, Grelle and Wallace look
lover the top three spots as Bran
non faded, and by the two and
one-half mile mark, these three
had taken a commanding lead
over the rest of the field. At this
I point, it was Truex by two yards
over Grelle, with Wallace eight
more back.
But Wallace forged ahead of
Grelle within the next quarter
mile, and began to close slighly
on Truex. At three miles, Truex

led Wallace by five seconds and
Grelle by seven.
Here, Grelle faded badly. But
Wallace was apprehensive about
taking (jut alter Truex too sud
denly, for fear that Grelle would
come up at the end. Wallace said
after the race he didn't know
Grelle had dropped back us fust
as he had.
Truex soon widened his margin
to about. 10 seconds, and held it
through .ne end of the race. For
I Truex, ii. was his second straight
PCC cross country title.
