Three bands will offer three dif
ferent types of music opportuni
ties winter and spring quarters
said David Korten, band manager.
The Symphonic and Concert

Red Vest (Basketball) Band is

"We wish to emphasize the fact
that women are eligible to parti
cipate in the Symphonic and Con
cert Bands," said Korten. "In the
last few years the notion that the
band program was predominantly
for men and that women were tol
erated has become prevalent.
"This is not true. The football
and basketball bands are closed
to women for the sake of ex
pediency."
The Symphonic Band is for se
rious musicians interested in per
forming classical works. It is
composed of instrumentalists who
have "auditioned and passed thus
proving they are capable of per
forming this kind of music the
way we want it done," said direc
tor Julius Shuchat.
Concert Band is open to all mu
scians and specializes in lighter
concert music than played by the
Symphonic Band, and is scheduled
to perform at student activities
during the next two quarters.
The .smallest and most select
of all the Stanford Bands is the
Red Vest Band which plays at all
home basketball gamess and trav
els, all expenses paid, to Los
Angeles and Berkeley.
