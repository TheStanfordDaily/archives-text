# SUMMIT TALKS?
## Allies Seek New Berlin Proposal 
### 
BERLIN (/P) — The Western
powers were repot ted Sunday to
be moving toward a counter-pro
posal on the Berlin question. The
proposal: a call for a summit con
ference on Germany's future.
The idea came into the spot
light as the East German Reds
warned tha any future airlift to
supply isolated West Berlin would
be regarded as a military threat.
Counter Proposal
Diplomats in Western capitals
discussed an East-West parley—
either at the foreign ministers or
summit level —as a counter to
Thursday's Soviet demand that
West Berlin be made a neutral
free city.
Responsible informants said the
West Germans pushed the parley
idea after it became clear that the
West is going to reject the Soviet
proposal.
Interest in a conference quick
ened after Soviet Premier Nikita
Krushchev said Saturday night at
a Moscow reception he wanted a
peaceful Berlin solution and
would "like to discuss things
around a round table." Some
Western officials think Krushchev
might be ready at such a con
ference to discuss all-German
unity as well as Berlin.
The East German Reds made it
clear over the week end that the
West is in for trouble if it refuses
to accept East German controls.
Party Boss Comments
Party boss Walter Ulbricht said
in an interview with the New
York Times that the Allies would
be confronted by "unnecessary
difficulties."
Ulbricht did not rule out the
possibility of an East-West confer
ence on Germany. He said the
Communists favored four-power
talks on a peace treaty for Ger
many. But he emphasized that
any conference arising from the
recent Soviet notes to the West
ern powers must first concentrate
on Moscow's Berlin proposals.
