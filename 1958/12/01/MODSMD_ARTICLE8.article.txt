### Diana Smith 
A needed articulate declaration of many Stanford mutterings is
Wilfred H. Stone's "Stanford House System: The Spaces for Free
dom," learl article in one of the best Sequoia issues to appear thus
far, on sale beginning today.
Stone describes how our residences indicate the present ambi-

valence of our educational philos
ophy, and he proposes the devel
opment of the house system as,
. . an open space where free
people can learn the joys and re
sponsibilities of freedom. . .
Faculty Resident
First faculty resident at Muir
and Burbank houses in Stern Half,
he envisions faculty and students
utilizing the spare and the time
of their houses in an experience
that is at once academic and so
cial, and always genuine educa
tion.
"An ideal house is not so much
one society as a collection of
small societies— some as small as
one guy and his friend across
the way."
The spirit of Stone's article is
imaginatively underlined by Art
Editor Judy Olson's abstract
drawings.
Poems in this issue include "The
Realization," Christopher Brook
house's confrontation of ebbing
life, and Steve Berry's incongru
ous juxtaposition of vitality and
unknowing commitment in "Mex
ico, In Retrospect."
Refreshing Expression
"Triangle," by Carolyn Block,
is a most refreshing poetic ex
pression of weariness.
Representational line drawings
by Aimee Brown and Jean Ilaf
fcrty describe the Brookhouse and
Berry poems; Miss Block's poem
is accompanied by the more glit
tering representational treatment
of Robert Ishikawa.
Of the fiction, John Water
house's "The Balloon Goes Up"
is supremely and wistfully funny.
English children Brian and Enid
discover the fraud and the actu
ality of their World War 11.
"Roger," an opening chapter
from a novel by Lee Trailx, is
about a teenager's rebellion ener
gies in Ihe flux of discontent and
self-confidence, and Carol Tallay
has drawn as graphic y portrait
of the wavering delinquent as
Traux has written.
Persistent Fraud
Jo De Eds makes persistent
fraud tell its story with the mock
crisis of a rider of horses in "The
Show Circuit," illustrated by
Paillette Koenig.
The black, white and red blocked
cover of this "Sequoia," by
George Mac Lean, is at its best
opened out flat.
Editor Anne Humphreys muses
on the unwillingness of Stanford
students to structure their
thoughts into articles in this is
sue's editorial.
"Sequoia" will be on sale on
Quad today through Wednesday
at 40 cents a copy.
