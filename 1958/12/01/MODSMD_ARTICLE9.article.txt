BOSTON (/P) â€” A civilian
who allegedly tried to steal a
U.S. Air Force jet 1 raining
plane was arrested Sunday.
A military spokesman said
that Donald Leo Lutman, 35, of
Bond Brook, N.J., pretended he
was a pilot and asked if the
plane was "gassed up and ready
to go."
"No one who knows anything
about jets would ask a question
like that," the spokesman said.
