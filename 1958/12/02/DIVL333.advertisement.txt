Dear Anxious ...
Of course you may have a Christ
mas party when you get home . . .
even I would love to see some of
your old friends again. Did I hear
you groan? Daddy and I will hide
in the den with the Van Cliburn
album you gave him (and I see
through that but won't tell). What
well-trained parents are we!
Yes, I'll arrange everything-but
Jimmy wants to decorate the tree
all by himself, and Kiithy insists
we have gifts for all, now that she's
learning gift-wrapping at school.
Speaking of gifts, I'm sure you'll
approve our decision; we couldn't
resist them ourselves! For the
boys, daddy selected a handsome
Faberge "Shave Kit" (won't they
be pleased with something so ut
terly masculine?) . . . and for the
girls, the most adorable set!
It's a brand-new and absolutely
enchanting "Nail Clare Kit" by
your beloved Juliette Marglen . . .
it holds six travel-si':e bottles (isn't
that an inspiration?) of luscious
fingertip colours - plus the most
marvelous idea of all - Gelatine
Glace Remover, in a tube! Hon
estly, it's the most, to borrow a
phrase from you know who.
The sets are 3.75 each, and daddy
says it's his treat (can you imagine
him shopping in a Perfume Depart
ment? I could hardly drag him
away). If you think this is overly
generous </ certainly do), just re
member that it's practically pea
nuts compared to your skiing trip
last year-what with travel, hotel,
clothes, long distance calls, and
that broken leg. Besides, we'll have
you home, and that, I confess, is
worth a fortune to us.
Here come the kids, so love and
kisses. •«

terly masculine?) . . . and for the
girls, the most adorable set!
It's a brand-new and absolutely
enchanting "Nail Clare Kit" by
your beloved Juliette Marglen . . .
it holds six travel-si':e bottles (isn't
that an inspiration?) of luscious
fingertip colours - plus the most
marvelous idea of all - Gelatine
Glace Remover, in a tube! Hon
estly, it's the most, to borrow a
phrase from you know who.
The sets are 3.75 each, and daddy
says it's his treat (can you imagine
him shopping in a Perfume Depart
ment? I could hardly drag him
away). If you think this is overly
generous </ certainly do), just re
member that it's practically pea
nuts compared to your skiing trip
last year-what with travel, hotel,
clothes, long distance calls, and
that broken leg. Besides, we'll have
you home, and that, I confess, is
worth a fortune to us.
Here come the kids, so love and
kisses. •«
