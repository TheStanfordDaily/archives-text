# West May State Berlin Policy Conference for Mid-December
## Negotiations With East German Regime Doubtful 
### 
BERLIN (/P) The West's campaign plan for the newest battle of
Berlin may emerge from a Paris meeting in mid-December.
That might be one way of averting a clash between Western and
Communist forces on the expiration of Moscow's six-month time
limit for acceptance of the free city proposal and withdrawal of

, the Western Big Three garrisons.
Diplomatic sources said Mon
day foreign ministers of the Unit
ed States, Britain, France and
West Germany will confer to co
ordinate policy in combatting the
Soviet demand for neutralization
j of West Berlin.
The date was not set. But the
: expectation was that Secretary of
State Dulles and his three col
leagues will get together in the
French capital either before or
during the 15-nation North Atlan
tic Pact Council meeting opening
there Dec. 16.
Summit Meet
The Western Big Three and
West Germany probably will pro
pose to meet the Soviets two or
three months later in a summit or
foreign ministers conference on
the whole German problem.
The question of whether the
West should deal with Communist
East German bolder guards as
agents of the Soviets when and if
the Soviet Union actually with
draws was still unresolved.
Lloyd told the House of Com
mons in London that Britain can
be said to accept some minor East
Germans as agents of the Soviet
government in executing four
power control of Berlin.
Wet Agrees
Dulles last week indicated West
ern willingness to deal with the
East Germans as Soviet agents
in certain circumstances.
The West German government
expressed dismay. Bonn officials
said any such policy would be a
step toward recognizing the Red
East German government.
And responsible informants here
said American officials feel such
an arrangement would be imprac
tical. They reasoned that any dif
ficulties would have to be taken
up with the East. Germans and
that this would imply recognition
in fact.
U.S. Opinion Firm
Opinion is hardening among
American officials, they said, for
defying any attempt to impose
East German controls and if nec
essary tf> launch an airlift for sup
ply of West Berlin at the risk of
clashes with Red fighter planes.
The East Germans claim full
sovereignty over the three air cor
ridors between West Berlin and
West Germany, and Communist
party boss Walter Ulbricht de
clared in a weekend statement
that any future airlift to supply
West Berlin without. East Ger
many's consent would be regard
ed as a military threat.
Informed officials in Washing
ton said Dulles is ready to make
the trip to Paris.
