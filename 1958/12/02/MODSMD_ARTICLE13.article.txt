# Nuclear Ban Treaty Now Underway
## 
### 
GENEVA (TP) — The United
States, Britain and the Soviet Un
ion Monday began hammering out
the opening article of a treaty de
fining the meaning of a controlled
suspension of the nuclear weapon
tests.
After a month of procedural
wrangling, the world's atomic
powers came to grips for tho
first time with the difficult task
of drafting a treaty defining obli
gations.
Opening Article
East and West agreed that no
quick and easy agreement is in
sight, but both sides emphasized
that the delegations have moved
into the substance of the problem.
Up for discussion was a revised
opening article of a Soviet draft
treaty and a separate first article
submitted by U. S. Ambassador
James J. Wadsworth.
The opening article of a treaty
usually defines the scope of the
obligations undertaken by the
signing powers. In the case of
these negotiations the United
States and Britain insist that the
opening article must link the
suspension of tests with a prom
ise to cooperate with an interna
tional control organization.
Still to be defined are the
answers to these major questions:
1 ear-to-Year Basis
Will the Soviet Union accept an
international cont r o 1 system
which will meet the West's de
mands for a tight policing?
Will the United States and
Britain continue to insist that a.
controlled suspension of tesls
must be organized on a year-by
year basis with its continuation
depending on progress in the re
lated field of disarmament?
The Soviet delegate, Semyon
Tsarapkin, strode from the con
ference room and told waiting
newsmen that both sides had got
ten down to talking about the
treaty.
Wadsworth, Tsarapkin and the
British chief delegate, Minister
of State David Ormsby-Gore, all
looked pleased after the hour
and 43-minute meeting.
