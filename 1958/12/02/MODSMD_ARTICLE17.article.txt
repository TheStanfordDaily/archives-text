# Living Conflicts

A THOUGHTFUL ARTICLE on Stanford housing appears in the De
cember issue of Sequoia magazine. Wilfred il. Stone, faculty resi
dent at Muir ami Burbank houses in Stern, gives his impressions
of the goals of a university education in relation to campus resi
dence.
Dr. Stone discusses what we fed is one of the key difficulties
in inaugurating a house system at Stanford: he terms it the "or
ganizational"' philosophy versus the "individualistic philosophy.
A house system is at present being discussed in many
corners of the University. From the discussion we luire
heard, there have developed at least two problems ref
lated to the philosophy conflict.
One of these is the hurry in which some persons would like
to see a new system instituted. Especially in a hurry are the stu
dents who feel that the present system does not accommodate
their immediate needs; these students are usually ol the "indi
vidualistic" philosophy. They see new plans as of benefit to the
entire University and too often fail to realize that many other
students, who have grown up in the atmosphere of the "organi
zational" philosophy, would not know what to do in the case of
a rapid change.
Even the five proposals which Dr. Stone makes in his article
as steps toward developing a better atmosphere lor education
would face this problem, because, as he notes in his article, "the
general response was: 'It's a good idea, hut 1 wouldn t like it. 1 d
have to work too hard. \\ hen such a response is general, the
rapid change which some students are seeking could have a detri
mental effect on the over-all goal.
The other difficulty we wish to mention its the problem of com
munication to these students of "general response. In the student
discussions there has been a desire for closer relations within the
living group and a stronger intellectual atmosphere, hut, because
of the problem of communication, there has been the fear that
students will be strangled by the proximity of a certain group of
people.
Before a house plan can be instituted, the participat
ing students must understand ami support the goals of
such a plan and realize, that being a member of a living
group is a tool in intellectual development, rather than a
barricade built with pressures for social and educational
con fortuity.
These are problems which the Administration is trying to
overcome as it looks to the future development of the I 'niversily,
hut problems which even the thoughtful student is apt to overlook
because lie sees some other way as the best way for .M)\V .
We urge our readers to read Dr. Stone's article in Sequoia, and,
while doing so, consider their own goals of a university education.
