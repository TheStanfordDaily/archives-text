Mental Vacuum
Editor, The Daily:
Women's Council points out
that "Stanford University does
not exist in a social vacuum." If
however, Stanford University has
gotten the idea that society con
demns the wall-papering of a
boy's room by a female, I would
be inclined to say that Stanford
University most certainly does ex
ist in a social vacuum.
The point of their letter (Nov.
seem to be this: we (Women's
Council) can't tell when you are
immoral and this is not our busi
ness, what we're here to do is
keep Stanford's reputation clean.
If you do not like it, you can
leave.
Many intelligent and serious
students do not like it, but God
forbid that they leave. It seems
that Women's Council is recom
mending that Stanford be a
mental vacuum.

We Can Be Proud
Editor, The Daily:
Nov. 22 I saw my last foot
ball game as an undergraduate.
Stanford's over-all showing could
not have made this event a hap
pier one for me. I left with the
belief that the word about which
we are all sick of hearing, "apa
thy." was buried in the depths of
Strawberry Canyon. As a future
"alum." I hope it is really dead,
never to plague our school's en
thusiasm again.
How fortunate that one of the
most thrilling Big Games of his
tory took place. It brought forth
a rebirth of the traditional spirit
that only alumni remember.
After the embarrassing effects
of the mass exodus at our Home
coming Game (after which one
player commented: "I looked up
from the field and thought there
was a bomb alert, for the aisles
were suddenly full of rooters leav
ing the stadium"), many have
been trying to remedy the situa
tion . . . others are only fed up!
The resulting suggestions and ac
•usations have been of little help.

No one is to blame —not Rally
Com, freshman sponsors, the "in
creasing intellectual atmosphere"
nor this season's football record.
"Apathy" and its cohorts are the
cause; this word should be abol
ished from the Stanford vocabu
lary. Our ASSU president recent
ly remarked to me that he never
knew what apathy was until he
came here. As a sponsor I second
his observation after seeing the
freshmen arrive fresh and enthu
siastic only to be quickly damp
ened by the attitude that has in
filtrated the minds of upper class
men smothering enthusiasm.
When I return to watch Stan
ford football as an "alum," I hope
to see the same atmosphere pre
vailing that I witnessed Nov. 22.
A bit glum because we had not
won Big Game, I was approached
by perhaps the most duly unhap
py person of all, Coach Curtice.
He gave me a friendly tap with
his program and with a smile
asked, "What's wrong?"
I smiled, too. It finally dawned
on me that Stanford really did
have the spirit and sportsman
ship of which we can all be very
proud.

Big Thanks
Editor, The Daily:
Nov. 20 evening members of
the Stanford Band, under the di
rection of Bob Smith of Toyon,
came to Roble Hall requesting ad
mittance to serenade it.
They nearly filled the main lob
by and their music more than
filled the entire hall and attracted
a packed audience in a matter of
minutes.
They played several pieces and
gave a couple of sample yells,
then left as quickly and orderly
as they had come.
Their serenade was short,
sweet and filled with Big Game
pep.
Their conduct was a credit to
Stanford and a delight to all who
were there. They deserve a big
thanks.
