# CHICAGO DISASTER
## Children, Teachers Perish As Flames Ravage School 
### 
CHICAGO (JP) â€”At least 88 children and teachers perished Monday,
some trapped at their desks, in a fire that flashed through a parochial
grade school on the Northwest Side.
The sudden spread of the flames through the older wing of the
three-story brick building prompted Chicago's fire commissioner to

express a belief an arsonist was
behind the disaster.
The tragedy stunned the entire
neighborhood about Our Lady of
the Angels Roman Catholic
Church and School at 3808 lowa
St.
Kinfolk and neighbors pushed
against tight police lines for a
glimpse of the little corpses,
fearful that they might recognize
one as that of a loved one.
Priests who at first helped evac
uate as many of the children as
possible later stood at the doors
of the doomed structure, admin
istering Extreme Unction, last
rite of the Catholic Church, as
grim-faced firemen carried out
bodies.
Possible "Touch-Off"
"This could-have been a touch
off," Fire Commissioner Robert
Quinn said in anger. "Touch-off"
is the fireman's word for the
legal term of arson.
The police arson squad was
sent to the scene to help fire in
vestigators.
In the courtyard where the
bodies lay were piles of smould
ering clothing and shoes torn off
by children who jumped from the
windows to escape death. Many
were hurt in the jumps.
Old Wing Burned
The fire virtually wiped out I he
eighth grade class housed in the
northeast corner of the old wing
of the building.
The Rev. Joseph F. Cussen,
pastor of the parish, said the
bui'ding is 40 years old and that
fifth, sixth and eighth grade chil
dren occupied the wing attacked
by fire.
Most classrooms were on the
upper two floors of the building:
only a few were on the ground
level.
