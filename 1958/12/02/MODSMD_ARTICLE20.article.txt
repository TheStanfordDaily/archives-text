# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Formidable Challenge 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
No one can doubt, that the So
viet challenge is very formidable
indeed. Even to a casual visitor
it is evident that the only safe
assumption is that the Russians
have mastered the modern tech
nology and that their bureau
cracy, directed by a powerful gov
ernment and working on an obe
dient population, is capable of
achieving what they have set
themselves to do.
Theirs is a grim and purpose
ful society, in which one who is
used to the American air finds il
is hard to breathe. No doubt the
vast machine does not work per
fectly and there is private dis
content and some cheating and
much fixing and blackmarketing.
N'or is the tenure in office of all
the individuals who are now at
the top of the government fixed
and settled for the rest of their
lives. None the less, the Soviet
system is a going concern, and
it would be rash to underestimate
its power or to count upon any
radical change of direction, much
less on a counter-revolution.
I have come home convinced
that the issue is the Russian
and Chinese challenge for the
leadership of Asia and of Afri
ca. If we are to meet it with
reasonable success, we must, 1
am sure, abandon the notion
that the Russian and Chinese
revolutions can he reversed or
that the spread of Communism
in the surrounding' countries
can be contained by giving arm
aments to the local military
commanders and by establish
ing our own bases.
What we need is an agonizing
reappraisal of our own habits
and notions. We must learn to
keep ouflielves armed without
working ourselves up into a
frenzy of threats and of fear. This
is not easy for a democracy to do,
but it is necessary and, once the
reason for it is understood by the
leaders of American opinion, it
can be done.
We must learn also to win
friends without asking them to
be our military allies.. This can
be done by encouraging them to
follow the neutral course which
their instinct tells them to take.
The policy of military pacts to
contain and push back the Com
munist revolution is not only
incapable of working sucessful
ly. Its effect is to antagonize
the masses of the people and so
to assist the expansion of Com
munism.
We must, I have been convinced,
reappraise and and review the
policy of foreign aid. As it is now
practiced, it is fair to describe it

as a program of subsidies to gov
ernments which are threatened
with the rise of Communism
among their people. Without
meaning to say that all or even
that some of these subsidies
should be discontinued, 1 submit
that we shall not meet the Soviet
challenge unless we stop looking
at the under-developed nations as
military bulwarks and bastions
and adopt a new and different
objective in the uncommitted
world.
The Communists are expanding
in Asia because they are demon
strating a way, at present, the
only obviously effective way, of
raising quickly the power and the
standards of living of a backward
people. The only convincing ans
wer to that must be a demonstra
tion by the non-Communist na
tions that there is another and
more humane way of overcoming
the immemorial poverty and
weakness of the Asian peoples.
This demonsration can best be
made in India, and there is little
doubt in my mind that if we and
our Western partners could un
derwrite and assure the success
of Indian development, it would
make a world of difference. It
might be decisive in turning the
tide. It would put an end to the
enervating feeling of fatality and
of inevitability, to the sense that
Communism is the only wave of
the future, that there is only one
way of internal salvation, and
that the West is potent and too
lazy to do anything but let the
future go by default.
There are a number of rea
sons why I think India is Hie
key country. It is, for one thing',
a very big country known to ail
of Asia as a lain! of deep pov
erty. To make a sliowplace of a
small island like Formosa or
for that matter of Puerto Rico
is u good thing to do. But it is
not convincing. For the Com
munists are proving their case
in big countries like Russia and
China. We shall have to prove
our case, I hat material progress
can be had with civil liberty, in
a big country.
But in my mind the clinching
reason for making the demonstra
tion in India is that the spiritual
heritage of which Gandhi was
(he great teacher, is, of all the
ideologies of the world the most
radically different from that of
Leninism. Yet, though it is dif
ferent, it is, like Communism,
addressed to the suffering masses
of the people.
I know there is a notion among
many Americans the the Indians
are more than half way aloiig the

road of being Communists. That
notion is based in part on the
fact that the Indians mean to be
come a social democratic state.
In the main the notion that they
are hall'-Communist is based on
the fact that on many issues of
foreign policy the Indian Govern
ment diff e r s from ours and
makes great efforts to keep on
good terms with the Soviet Union
and with its powerful and danger
ous neighbor, Red China.
Nevertheless, the Indians
who are indoctrinated in the
Ciandhi tradition are acutely
conscious of the gulf between
the Soviet system and them
selves. They are not totalitar
ian. They are not materialistic
determinists. That is more than
can be said with the same con
fidence about quite a number of
the other peoples who are not
yet wit hi n the Communist
orbit.
If there is any other way of
meeting the Communist challenge
in Asia, 1 have not heard of it.
The tide is running in favor of
Communism almost, one might
say, by default. Russia and China
are making a demonstration lo
which the West is offering no
alternative. I do not know where
else a non-Communist alterna
tive can now be demonstrated,
given the fact that only in India,
outside of the Communist orbit,
could a successful demonstration
carry conviction to the great
masses of the people who are
looking for a beter way of life.
