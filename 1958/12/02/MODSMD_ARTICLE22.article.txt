Stanford University scientists
are investigating the structure of
liquids in a $98,000 research pro
ject.
Prof. Cornelius J. Pings, Jr., of
tlie Chemical Engineering Divi
sion is directing the project.
Prof. Pings and his group
will use newly developed tech
niques ol" X-ray and neutron dif
fraction io examine the molecular
structures of liquids.
