Tossing Credits Around
Topping Hip list of campus sports activity over the week end was
the Pacific Coast ( onl'erence championship cross-country meet—and
for showings in this affair we'd like to throw out a couple of sets of ;
credits.
The first goes to the Stanford team for its second-place perform
ance, riot very f;u behind I SC). After finishing a dismal sixth last
year, the harriers went to work this fall and wound up a surprising
season with a strong finish.
The second is for coaches I'ayton Jordan and >11111 Terrill not only
for the outstanding job they did with the team, but for furnishing
the PCC with ;i well-organized and efficiently-conducted meet.
Back again to the team, this time to see what their fall perform
ances bode for the spring track team.
Doug Martin and Bob Monzingo, ihe 10th and 11th place finishers,
both figure to help .lonian's force in the mile and two-mile. Martin
was sick last spring, so didn't run; and Monzingo never came along
last enough to be much help. The story should be different this year,
if fall performances are any indication.
John N'ortliway will confine his running efforts to frosh tracks in
the spring, probably going in both the mile and two-mile. Nortlivvay,
however, will probably find himself second man to lOvangelos De
pastas.
Dcpastas, a student from Greece, didn't run cross-country this fall,
but has turned in a 9:05 two-mile in workouts. Al Ahumada, the
number live hairier, is just a sophomore and probably still a year
away from breaking into the Indian top ranks in the distances.
A pleasant surprise at Saturday's meet was the turnout of fans. |
Where 30 or 40 is normal for a cross-country race here, upwards of
400 fanned out around the golf course to watch what turned out to]
be an even closer meet than expected.
Viiidi<*livcn< k HK or Legitimate Reasons?
And then there was the little boy who wouldn't go by the rules I
when he played the game, but as soon as somebody else tried to make j
an exception, In began to cry.
Only this time, ii was USC and UCLA who suddenly found them
selves in the position of conscientious objectors when Washington J
State tried to get a waiver of a !*('(' rule.
Actually, the action of the Bruins and Trojans in refusing Wash
ington Slab* pel-mission to play in a bowl game may not be quite as
vindictive as it sounds. At least Stanford's PCC faculty representa
tive Kixford K. Snyder doesn't think it is. And neither does assistant
athletic director ( buck Taylor.
It really isn't surprising that thp charge of revenge popped up as
soon as the southlanders came up with their move which prevented
a vote on WSC's bowl request. After all, the Cougars had lined up
against CSC and IJCLA during the conference mess, and were among
he first to be dropped from future scheduling by the Los Angeles
schools.
Hut Taylor says, "My reaction is that CSC and UCLA had a certain
right to oppose . . . tlieir decision was probably made on a basis of
the Rose Bowl agreement in 1960." For the 1960 game, the athletic
directors of the nine schools now in the PCC will meet to choose a
western representative in approximately the same manner as the
PCC school is now chosen, and funds will be distributed in the same
manner.
Taylor added that he thought pressure from the Rose Bowl and
National Broadcasting Company had been much greater on the
Southland schools, if for no other reason than geographical proximity.
Snyder said, however, that the Rose Bowl and NBC had not ap
proached Stanford with any pleas to prevent Washington State from
going to another bowl.
In explaining his favorable vote, Snyder said, "WSC is a good
team. II they wanted to do it |go to another bowl] it would be too
bad to keep them out when the conference is almost finished any
how." Snyder added that he thought the Rose Bowl's having the best
PCC team and some other bowl going after the number two team
would actually enhance prestige of the Rose Bowl. But apparently
Pasadena officials didn't see it that way
flow to Kill a Mail Vote
Snyder shed some light on the mechanics of the PCC voting pro
cedure: "IS is always undersood that a mail vote implies both con
sent (0 a mail vote being held and a school's voting position." Thus, I
one school objecting to a mail vote can kill the vote —and this is
what the Bruins and Trojans did. No move was initiated to get
faculty representatives together for an in-person vote. Such a gather
ing would most likely have approved the WSC request by a 7-2 vote,
the margin by which it passed before USC and UCLA objected.
Well, perhaps the Southlanders did have a few reasons for oppos
ing WSC besides vindiction, that is. But if all this pressure from
the Rose Bowl and NBC was so strong, how come not a bit of it was
applied to Stanford?
One question arises from the situation—what effect will it have on
future releaguing? Snyder says none, and he's probably right.
But it does serve to emphasize a point made in an October Daily
editorial, That point: let's take a long and hard and careful look!
before plunging into any new league with those who played a key
role in the breakup of the present league.
A few years of patience in an independent: status would be far
preferable to jumping into a Big Five which presently would ap
pear- to have strong possibilities of winding up with a policy of
mutual distrust.

The funny side of the situation came in the form of platitudinous
statements from the two institutions and these were a riot regard
less of the true motives behind the vote. The best came from UCLA
athletic director Wilbur Johns, who said something to the effect that
"the conference rules are there for a purpose—to be obeyed."
But-ah, say, Wilbur - it's about those penalties your outfit picked
up for not obeying conference rules. You forgot about them,
maybe?
