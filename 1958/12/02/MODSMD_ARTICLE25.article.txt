# Card Hoopsters Take Opener
## 
### Steve Baffrey. Sports Editor 
Coach Howie Dallmar unveiled the 1958-59 model of the Big Red
basketball machine in the Pavilion last night, and the new model
passed its first performance test with flying colors, downing the
San Jose State Spartans 57-40.
Guard Paul Neumann was the Cards' leading scorer with 11

markers; John Arrillaga dumped
in 10 points to the winning effort
and a trio composed of Jerry
Thuesen, Dick llaga and John
Stabler was in third place with six
points each.
In their first encounter of the
pressive offensive attack which
season the Cards displayed an im
combined with an effective de
fensive display. Improvements in
both of these departments were
needed by the club in its bid for
the final Conference champion
ship. Last night was a good start.
The Indians hit on 22 of I I field
goal attempts for an impressive
50'/ first game mark. Defensive
ly the Cards grabbed off '.i2 re
bounds; Dick llaga led the Stan
ford squad with 10 of these.
Karly Lead
Stanford took command from
the opening minutes and was nev
er- bettered. Throughout most of
the tussle the Cards rode on a
margin of 15 points or more, giv
ing Ihe local mentor plenty of
chance to play l.'-i members ol Ihe
Red and White squad.
Guard Paul Neumann started
the Stanfords on their road to
victory when he opened the scor
ing with a free throw. The Spar
tans came back to tie it at 1-1, bul
then were out of the game, l!
took the visitors eight and one
half minutes to put their first
field goal through 'H |fl hoop, and
they didn't break info the double
figures until the final 25 seconds
of the first stanza. The hall'time
I margin was 29-11, Stanfor d.
Stanford controlled Ihe offens
j ive and defensive boards well
throughout the half, allowing the
Spartans but three field goals.
San Jose came on stronger in
the middle half of the second
stanza against the Stanford third
unit, but the Spartans couldn't
even capitalize on this chance.
Even though they more than
doubled Iheir first half total in
the stanza, San Jose lacked the
class needed to overtake the
strong and determined Card
bunch.
Guard John Stahler was an eye
catcher in the second frame with
his inspired ball handling and
driving lay-ups. The little man's
six points were all made on im
pressive plays.
Lundquist Leader
Center Arney Lundquist and
forward Bob Chapman led the
Spartan attack with nine counters
apiece. Chapman was the leading
rebounder with seven takes.
Earlier in the afternoon the
Stanford Braves defeated East
Contra Costa JC, 68-53. Phil Jou
, pon-Rouche led the Braves' scor
; ing with 16 points. He was fol
' lowed by Bill Martin with 14 and
] Tom Nordland with 13.
The Cards go into action again
j this weekend with two games at
! the Cow Palace. On Friday the

Indians meet Santa Clara and on
Saturday they take on St. Mary's.

both of these departments were
needed by the club in its bid for
the final Conference champion
ship. Last night was a good start.
The Indians hit on 22 of I I field
goal attempts for an impressive
50'/ first game mark. Defensive

Karly Lead
Stanford took command from
the opening minutes and was nev

ing Ihe local mentor plenty of
chance to play l.'-i members ol Ihe
Red and White squad.
Guard Paul Neumann started
the Stanfords on their road to
victory when he opened the scor

half minutes to put their first
field goal through 'H |fl hoop, and

of the first stanza. The hall'time

San Jose came on stronger in
the middle half of the second
stanza against the Stanford third
unit, but the Spartans couldn't

Even though they more than
doubled Iheir first half total in
the stanza, San Jose lacked the
class needed to overtake the
strong and determined Card
bunch.
Guard John Stahler was an eye

Karly Lead
Stanford took command from
the opening minutes and was nev
er- bettered. Throughout most of
the tussle the Cards rode on a
margin of 15 points or more, giv
ing Ihe local mentor plenty of
chance to play l.'-i members ol Ihe
Red and White squad.
Guard Paul Neumann started
the Stanfords on their road to
victory when he opened the scor
ing with a free throw. The Spar

half minutes to put their first
field goal through 'H |fl hoop, and
they didn't break info the double
figures until the final 25 seconds
of the first stanza. The hall'time
I margin was 29-11, Stanfor d.
Stanford controlled Ihe offens
j ive and defensive boards well
throughout the half, allowing the
Spartans but three field goals.
San Jose came on stronger in
the middle half of the second
stanza against the Stanford third
unit, but the Spartans couldn't
even capitalize on this chance.
Even though they more than
doubled Iheir first half total in
the stanza, San Jose lacked the
class needed to overtake the
strong and determined Card
bunch.
Guard John Stahler was an eye
catcher in the second frame with

driving lay-ups. The little man's
six points were all made on im
