## 
### 
A great comeback effort that
just fell short was the closest
that the Stanford freshman bas
ketball team could come to win
ning Iheir first game against
the San Jose frosh last night.
The visitors held off the late
Stanford rally to claim the vic
tory. Final score was 49-48.
The Papooses never- led during
the game and looked almost
hopelessly behind as San Jose was
building on a 46-39 lead late in
the final period. However, the
locals stemmed the tide and led
by John Windsor, their 6-7 center,
came back to make the score 48-
42 with less than four minutes
remaining. Here Nels Christen
sen, SU forward, drove the
length of the court for a layup
shot which closed the gap to four
points.
Gaining the ball once more
Christensen went up for a jump
shot and was fouled by Spar-tan
forward, Bill Thomas. He prompt
ly made both shots and the score
board read 48-46 with less than
one minute remaining in the
game.
San Jose began a stall but
guard Gary Ryan took steps and
the ball went over to Stanford.
With 30 seconds left to be played
Windsor drove for a layup to tie
the score.
As the San Jose Icam came
back down-floor Thomas was
fouled by Christensen and once
more ihe visitors took the lead
by the margin of a free throw as
Thomas made the basket.
The game ended with several
Stanford players shooting but
none wore able to hit.
