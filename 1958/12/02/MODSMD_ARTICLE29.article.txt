ond of a series of analysis of the
PCC basketball clubs which will
appear in the Daily Ibis week).

Oregon State coach Slats dill
must replace his alltirne high
scorer, Dave Gambee, as he re
builds the Beaver five for the last
Pacific Coast Conference basket
ball campaign.
The loss of the 6 7 All-Amen
can Gambee, along with the sec
caul high scorer from last season's
co-champions, Ken N'anson, makes
this a year of rebuilding at Cor
vail is.
However, both of the Beaver's
starting guards, Jim Anderson
and Lee Harmon, are back. Their
experience will make Oregon
State strong in Ihe baekcourt.
Both stand under six feet.
In the center position Gill is
hoping that senior Gary Coble
will finally break loose and have
a good year. The 6-8 pivot man is
in his third campaign for thej
i Beavers and has yet to live up to '
the expectations of the OS(' coach
ing staff.
To replace the combination of
Gambee and Nanson, who ac
counted for 36 points per game
last season, Gill is looking to two
promising Sophomores, Karl An
derson and Steve Flynn.
Anderson at 6-9 and Flynn nlj
6-6 (from Mountain View) will
give the Beavers their usual
height on the front line, however
both players have yet to prove
themselves in varsity competition. 1
At Oregon, coach Steve Belko !
must also find replacements for
his two leading scorers and re
bounders, Charley Franklin and
Hal Duffy. However, the Ducks
i hope for improvement and will :

field a young foam that could
cause plenty of trouble for PCC
foes.
Two years ago when Belko left
Idaho State to take over the head
coaching chores at P'ugene he in
herited a 4-won 21-lost team and
brought them up to a surprising
13-11 record last season.
The present campaign will he
the first in which BHko's rebuild
ing efforts will be evident, since
the current group of sophomores
is the first attracted by him to
Eugene.
At present there s no renter
on the team. An offense is planned
that will keep three forwards
switching in and out of the post.
Stu Robertson and Dale Herron
from last season's squad will fill
two of these up-front positions
while sophomore Denny Strick
land will complete the trio. All
three of the forwards are Gil
which v.'ill give the Ducks more
height than they are used to on
the front line.
Like neighbor Gill, Belko has no
baekcourt worries with returning
lettermen Chuck Rask and Bud
Kuykendall who rank as one of
the top duos in the league.

Idaho).

must replace his alltirne high
scorer, Dave Gambee, as he re
builds the Beaver five for the last
Pacific Coast Conference basket
ball campaign.
The loss of the 6 7 All-Amen
can Gambee, along with the sec
caul high scorer from last season's
co-champions, Ken N'anson, makes
this a year of rebuilding at Cor
vail is.
However, both of the Beaver's
starting guards, Jim Anderson
and Lee Harmon, are back. Their
experience will make Oregon
State strong in Ihe baekcourt.
Both stand under six feet.
In the center position Gill is
hoping that senior Gary Coble
will finally break loose and have
a good year. The 6-8 pivot man is
in his third campaign for thej
i Beavers and has yet to live up to '
the expectations of the OS(' coach
ing staff.
To replace the combination of
Gambee and Nanson, who ac
counted for 36 points per game
last season, Gill is looking to two
promising Sophomores, Karl An
derson and Steve Flynn.
Anderson at 6-9 and Flynn nlj
6-6 (from Mountain View) will
give the Beavers their usual
height on the front line, however
both players have yet to prove
themselves in varsity competition. 1
At Oregon, coach Steve Belko !
must also find replacements for
his two leading scorers and re
bounders, Charley Franklin and
Hal Duffy. However, the Ducks
i hope for improvement and will :

field a young foam that could
cause plenty of trouble for PCC
foes.
Two years ago when Belko left
Idaho State to take over the head
coaching chores at P'ugene he in
herited a 4-won 21-lost team and
brought them up to a surprising
13-11 record last season.
The present campaign will he
the first in which BHko's rebuild
ing efforts will be evident, since
the current group of sophomores
is the first attracted by him to
Eugene.
At present there s no renter
on the team. An offense is planned
that will keep three forwards
switching in and out of the post.
Stu Robertson and Dale Herron
from last season's squad will fill
two of these up-front positions
while sophomore Denny Strick
land will complete the trio. All
three of the forwards are Gil
which v.'ill give the Ducks more
height than they are used to on
the front line.
Like neighbor Gill, Belko has no
baekcourt worries with returning
lettermen Chuck Rask and Bud
Kuykendall who rank as one of
the top duos in the league.
