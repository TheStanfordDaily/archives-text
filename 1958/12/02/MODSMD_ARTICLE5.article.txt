# Chappie Christmas Edition Adances Seasonal Cheer
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Christmas is coming and so is
the Chappie.
Though there may scorn to bo
no correlation between these two
events, the fact of tho matter is
that tho Chappie staff, full of
good will toward men, is wrap
ping up its Christmas issue to be
put on sale on Quad Wednesday.
We understand that, since this
is the Christmas issue, tho mag
will be abounding in the usual
notes of good cheer and want lists
of typical students.
But tho Old Boy—after donning
his whito whiskers for tho season
- has come up with a really now
one: instead of "Helpful Hints on
What to Got tho Person Who Has
Everything," there will be "Help

ful Hints on llow to Get What
You Want."
It is also rumored that the Chap
pie staff, armed with typewriters,
erasers and prickly holly, will ver
bally attack those poor souls, the
frosh.
If, perchance, in one's budget
ing for Christmas shopping, one
finds an extra 35 cents which one
cannot decide where to spend, ono
will also find an eager member of
the old Boy's staff waiting to re
lieve one of said 35 cents —on
Quad Wednesday.
