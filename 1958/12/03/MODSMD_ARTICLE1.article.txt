# KZSU: Return to Air Still a Moot Question
## 
### Roger Folsom 
"KZSU's suspension from broadcasting may not even
last the whole of this academic year."—Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences Philip H. Rhinelander, speaking to
The Daily.
"There is no target date for a return of KZSU to the
air."—Prof. George Wiley, acting director of radio and
television.
KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio station closed down
by the Administration last September, cannot be expected
to return to the air soon because the causes of its re
moval from the air have not been corrected, University
officials said. Once a week the station's personnel meet
with the professors from the speech and drama depart
ment, to discuss the problems of KZSU.
Solution Not In Sight
This "re-evaluation" is progressing, but completion is
not in sight.
KZSU was required to stop broadcasting, according to
Dean of Students 11. Donald Winbigler, because of sev
eral difficult situations.
The station had been plagued, as had the rest of Me
morial Auditorium, by thefts of equipment. Winbigler
said that "There had been a problem of security for
a long period of time."
There was dissatisfaction with what the station was
doing, and how it was doing it. Winbigler accuses the
station, "although officially and legally not an independ
ent organ/at ion," of "acting like one." Although KZSU
was nominally under the direction of the speech and
drama department (its advertising revenues went directly

to tlie University general fund), it received no directing
control from the department, KZSU had even been keep
ing some station funds in a personal bank account under
the name of a staff member.
There is some question as to whether the station's in
dependence was due to its refusal to pay any attention to
the speech and drama department, or resulted from the
department's ignoring KZSU. The station has never had
any official connection with the Associated Students.
Usefulness Questioned
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Philip H. Rhinelander
joined Winbigler in noting that there was concern in the
administration as to the usefulness of an irresponsibly
independent KZSU. Winbigler said that "over the years,
there have been various criticisms of material—that
it was not in good taste." He also wondered whether
KZSU performed any useful function as a "means of
communication" to the student body. Rarely does anyone
suggest, Winbigler asserted to The Daily, using KZSU
to publicize anything.
Winbigler unequivocally said that KZSU could perfor m
a useful function: "The station ought to be of great
value in the teaching program of the speech and drama
department," provided that it was not independent from
the department.
Rhinelander, empasizing that "I'd like to see the station
go on as soon as possible," said that in his opinion the
station ought to "reflect the kind of things a University
is interested in"—news, forums, and "good music."
Rhinelander did state, however, that "I have no objection
to popular music—at times."
Mike Chambreau, the station's present program man

ager, told the Daily that the station's programming last
year had been tending more and more towards the "high
grade operation" advocated by Rhinelander.
With winter quarter last year, new station personnel
reversed the station's previous "top forty—rock and roll"
programming by playing only classical music and spe
cial events after 7 p.m. Special events, as the speech of
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt last spring quarter, were re
broadcast to the student body. Panel discussions were
scheduled.
In the afternoon, however, the station did play popular
music and jazz.
Last year the station was plagued by a number of
technical, or engineering, difficulties. Many students were
unable to hear KZSU on their radios. But the most serious
technical problem resulted in a serious letter to the Uni
versity by the Federal Communications Commission. The
station's system of broadcasting was threatening to in
terfere with other local stations.
Broadcasts Sent Through Local Wires
KZSU operates, not by sending its broadcasts through
the air from a central transmitter, but by sending its
broadcasts through transmission wires to each dormi
tory, and then within each dormitory along the regular
electricity wires. These latter wires send out radio
waves for a very short distance ten feet at most- and
they are picked up by student and faculty radios from
the air.
The transmission wires running to the dormitories
were found by the FCC during a routine check to be
"radiating" or "leaking" their radio waves to the air-,
thus competing with the air wave broadcasting of regu

lar radio stations. This had happened several times
since the station was founded in 1947. But each time,
according to Phil Figler, the station's chief engineer, the
proper adjustments were made.
However, each time KZSU expanded its audience by
setting up new transmitters and running wires to new
dormitories, new adjustments for the whole .system were
necessary. These were made as accurately as possible,
but KZSU does not have equipment to check its own
radiation. Therefore, the station simply waited until the
FCC complained, and then used FCC technical informa
tion to make adjustments.
Shut Down by University
In its letter of last summer, an annoyed FCC told the
University that it could make the necessary adjustments,
could get an FM (Frequency Modulation) license and
broadcast as a regular station, or could go off the air.
Due to KZSU's other problems, the University shut the
station down.
FM and AM (Audio Modulation) are two technically
different ways to send sound waves through the air, as
opposed to KZSU's present system of sending sound (ex
cept for the last ten feet) through wires. Regular radios
receive AM signals. To receive FM signals, a special
radio (costing about $40) is necessary.
There are no AM licenses available now. and none will
become available in the foreseeable future, so if KZSU
should decide to broadcast through the air, it would have
to use the FM system.
Editor's note: Tomorrow's concluding article on
KZSU will explore the proposed solutions to criticisms
of KZSU.
