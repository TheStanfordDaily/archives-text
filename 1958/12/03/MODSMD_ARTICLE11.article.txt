# Scratch Sheet Discontinued This Quarter

The Scratch Sheet will not ;<p
pear this quarter, former editor
Jerry Clinton has announced.
The publication was originated
last winter to evaluate General
Studies courses, and sold on Quad
during winter and spring pre
regis! ration.
Last year's staff lias either
graduated or lacks the time to
continue publication without new
staff help. Collection and editing
course evaluations is a mammoth
job. and it is felt that a mediocre
Scratch Sheet would lie worse
than none at all, Clinton said.
If enough students are suffi
ciently interested in the Scratch
Sheet to contact him and offer
their services, Clinton has offered
to hold an organizational meet
ing at the beginning of Winter
Quarter to explore the possibili
ties of revival.
