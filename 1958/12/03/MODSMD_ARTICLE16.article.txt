# Valued Reports

### 
One of hif. most useful projects instituted by Legislature in
recent years is currently under way- an "investigation inlo the
boards and commissions which operate under the ASS If.
Two reports have been given- Speech Activities and Student-
Faculty commissions. These reports have been encouraging in
that they have not been merely a summary of activities, hut have
included critical evaluations and recommendations.
Such discussions of the value and purpose ol Ihe various or
ganizations have not been conducted publicly lor some time, al
though some of the more thoughtful groups have evaluated their
own actions. Too often there has been resentment against any
legislative interference in the activities. As a result, the possi
bilit) looms that some organizations are either not fulfilling their
purpose or are not serving any purpose at all.
It is our hope that the organizations of the ASSU will take
the findings of the committees to heart and ad upon them. Ihe
findings and resulting recommendations may show that a com
mission or board is unnecessary, or that it may be beneficial to
consolidate. At least, tlie knowledge gained by Legislature mem
bers about the various organizations and the comments that the
members may have on the report will be of value to the func
tioning of the ASSU.
