### JOHN BOHN ASSU President 
Legislature meets for the last
time this quarter tonight at 7:15
in Bowman Alumni House. At
that time final action will be tak
en on the new athletic award sys
tem and Chuck Taylor will be
present to answer any questions.
Also on the agenda are discussion
concerning proposed national and
international figures which the
lIR is seeking for the Foreign
Policy Institute, and the proposed
Senior memorial fund raising pro
gram.
It might be well here to review
some of the projects which were
begun this quarter and which will
be continued when we return. As
you know, the Legislature has es
tablished committees to look into
the purpose, functions and finan
cial arrangements of various
bodies within the Associated Stu
dents organization and to report
back to Legislature its recom
mendations for improvement.
Speech Association and Student
Faculty Commission have al
ready been the subjects of excel
lent discussion.
Next Quarter
Next quarter we look forward
to reports and discussion on the
Fundamental Standard and Hon
or Code Commission and Cardin
als and Rally Commission, to be
followed by similar discussions on
the remainder of the Boards and
Commissions within the organi
zation.
Several other programs are un
der way. In order to increase the
understanding of Legislature

members of problems which must
be faced, and thereby to promote
greater efficiency in operation,
the Legislature has decided to
spend a weekend early next quar
ter at a special hostel where these
problems can be discussed freely
and the members may share their
experiences for mutual benefit.
It is hoped that a re-evaluation of
the purpose and functions of
Legislature will emerge.
Election By-laws
Before the next election John
Richards and several members of
Legislature will re-write the
election by-laws to eliminate as
many of the inconsistencies as
possible. Suggestions may be
dropped off at the A.S.S.U. office.
The Union Planning Board,
after several delays, assures me
that it will have a report on the
progress of our proposed Union
in the near future. A few pre
liminary steps have been taken
to establish a body to coordinate
the appearance on campus of
various national figures spon
sored by Political Union, lIR and
Public Exercises. I have received
word from the University of Cali
fornia that ihey are interested
in establishing a cooperative pro
gram to share the cost of bring
ing such persons to the West
Coast, and plans are being laid
to work out the details.
At the risk of repetition let me
here compliment the rooting sec
tion and the cheer leaders for
their performance at Big Game.

in Bowman Alumni House. At
that time final action will be tak
en on the new athletic award sys
tem and Chuck Taylor will be
present to answer any questions.
Also on the agenda are discussion
concerning proposed national and
international figures which the
lIR is seeking for the Foreign
Policy Institute, and the proposed
Senior memorial fund raising pro
gram.
It might be well here to review
some of the projects which were
begun this quarter and which will
be continued when we return. As
you know, the Legislature has es
tablished committees to look into
the purpose, functions and finan
cial arrangements of various
bodies within the Associated Stu
dents organization and to report
back to Legislature its recom
mendations for improvement.
Speech Association and Student
Faculty Commission have al
ready been the subjects of excel
lent discussion.
Next Quarter
Next quarter we look forward
to reports and discussion on the
Fundamental Standard and Hon
or Code Commission and Cardin
als and Rally Commission, to be
followed by similar discussions on
the remainder of the Boards and
Commissions within the organi
zation.
Several other programs are un
der way. In order to increase the
understanding of Legislature

members of problems which must
be faced, and thereby to promote
greater efficiency in operation,
the Legislature has decided to
spend a weekend early next quar
ter at a special hostel where these
problems can be discussed freely
and the members may share their
experiences for mutual benefit.
It is hoped that a re-evaluation of
the purpose and functions of
Legislature will emerge.
Election By-laws
Before the next election John
Richards and several members of
Legislature will re-write the
election by-laws to eliminate as
many of the inconsistencies as
possible. Suggestions may be
dropped off at the A.S.S.U. office.
The Union Planning Board,
after several delays, assures me
that it will have a report on the
progress of our proposed Union
in the near future. A few pre
liminary steps have been taken
to establish a body to coordinate
the appearance on campus of
various national figures spon
sored by Political Union, lIR and
Public Exercises. I have received
word from the University of Cali
fornia that ihey are interested
in establishing a cooperative pro
gram to share the cost of bring
ing such persons to the West
Coast, and plans are being laid
to work out the details.
At the risk of repetition let me
here compliment the rooting sec
tion and the cheer leaders for
their performance at Big Game.
The same University represented
on the field was represented in
the stands.
Legislature meets for the last
time this quarter tonight at 7:15
in Bowman Alumni House. At
that time final action will be tak
en on the new athletic award sys
tem and Chuck Taylor will be
present to answer any questions.
