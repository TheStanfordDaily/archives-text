# Letters to the Editor
## Clarification 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It was gratifying to see The
Daily devote space to the Keio I
Exchange Program and my own
experiences, there last year. How
ever, with all due regard to the
article's author, I would like to I
correct a point or two to avoid
being guilty of adding to the mis
understanding about Japan and
the Far East already wide spread.
Whether or not I did say
"Japan is the one Asian country
which still values Western ideas"
(and I don't think I did) it, of
course, is not. Nor is it really too
informative to call Japan "the
leader of the nations of East Asia
outside the bamboo curtain" ex

cept in regard to technology.
Less important: although Indo
nesian and Thai students, as well
as those of other countries in
Asia, are enrolling in Japanese
schools in increasingly large num
bers, it is not true that the major
ity study in Japan. Secondly,
Keio's buildings, fortunately or
unfortunately, do not resemble
those of Stanford.
Finally, the quotation in the
last paragraph of the article is
not mine. Indeed, part of the dif
ficulties we have in Asia may
well be because we think in
simple terms of "losing friend
ship" and speculation on how we
could have prevented the last war.
