## More Student Initiative Needed for Commission 
### 
In one of its most inspired
projects in recent years, ASSU
Legislature has undertaken tu
evaluate all student organizations
on campus. One or two groups

will be reviewed weekly by com
mittees from Legislature.
The Committee reporting on
the Student Faculty Commis
sion staled in its report that
the Commission . . has recog
nized that a fundamental cause
of 'poor' relations is due to the
lack of situations and/or loca
tions here at Stanford in which
such associations could hotli
begin and develop."
Legislature discussion indicated
recognition that effective contact
between students and faculty, like
that between any two people, is
based upon mutual interests.
Efforts to improve faculty-stu
dent relations in the past have
sometimes been sincere but mis
directed campaigns which have
treated student-faculty relations
as something less than human,
and resulted in proximity without
communication.
The Student Faculty Commis
sion had a modest beginning in
1934-55, and has become a vital
group rather recently. It is se
lected annually on the basis of
interviews and is composed of 12
undergraduates, one graduate
student, one administrative ad
visor and one faculty advisor.
Present Commission chairman is
Sallyanne Durr.
Last spring the Commission
was instrumental in present
ing to the University adminis
tration the Faculty Associates
program instituted this fall at
Stern and Lagunita.
Most of its current projects
are in the planning stages. Among
them are faculty open houses, a
faculty directory, and a student

i faculty picnic to be held possibly
in conjunction with Con Home
Week next spring.
Among the suggestions made
by the Legislature Committee was
that student initiative in facilita
ting student-faculty contact play
a larger role than it has in the
past.
To date many of the most
I worthwhile aids to student
faculty relations have come
from the faculty and adminis
tration, for example the Dean's
Fund. This money allows any
three students to invite an in
structor to their living group
for dinner, or instructors to en
tertain students in their homes.
Student faculty Commission is
encouraging the Fund's use.
It is generally felt that initiative
in this area must of necessity
rest largely with students, if for
no other reason than numbers.
It is doubtful if many students
are aware of the potential of the
Student-Faculty Commission as
an agency for channeling their
efforts in this direction.
The Commission can more ac
tively seek to interest students
in its projects and solicit ideas
and help from the campus at
large.
Th e reviewing committee
urged more comprehensive
evaluation of Commission ac
tivities, both in its minutes and
in extensive annual reports.
Also recommended was an ex
panded graduate-faculty program,
which the Commission has begun
planning since Legislature's re-
I port was given.

begin and develop."
Legislature discussion indicated
recognition that effective contact
between students and faculty, like
that between any two people, is
based upon mutual interests.
Efforts to improve faculty-stu
dent relations in the past have
sometimes been sincere but mis
directed campaigns which have
treated student-faculty relations
as something less than human,
and resulted in proximity without
communication.
The Student Faculty Commis
sion had a modest beginning in
1934-55, and has become a vital
group rather recently. It is se
lected annually on the basis of
interviews and is composed of 12
undergraduates, one graduate
student, one administrative ad
visor and one faculty advisor.
Present Commission chairman is
Sallyanne Durr.
Last spring the Commission
was instrumental in present
ing to the University adminis
tration the Faculty Associates
program instituted this fall at
Stern and Lagunita.
Most of its current projects
are in the planning stages. Among
them are faculty open houses, a
faculty directory, and a student

i faculty picnic to be held possibly
in conjunction with Con Home
Week next spring.
Among the suggestions made
by the Legislature Committee was
that student initiative in facilita
ting student-faculty contact play
a larger role than it has in the
past.
To date many of the most
I worthwhile aids to student
faculty relations have come
from the faculty and adminis
tration, for example the Dean's
Fund. This money allows any
three students to invite an in
structor to their living group
for dinner, or instructors to en
tertain students in their homes.
Student faculty Commission is
encouraging the Fund's use.
It is generally felt that initiative
in this area must of necessity
rest largely with students, if for
no other reason than numbers.
It is doubtful if many students
are aware of the potential of the
Student-Faculty Commission as
an agency for channeling their
efforts in this direction.
The Commission can more ac
tively seek to interest students
in its projects and solicit ideas
and help from the campus at
large.
Th e reviewing committee
urged more comprehensive
evaluation of Commission ac
tivities, both in its minutes and
in extensive annual reports.
Also recommended was an ex
panded graduate-faculty program,
which the Commission has begun
planning since Legislature's re-
I port was given.
In one of its most inspired
projects in recent years, ASSU
Legislature has undertaken tu
evaluate all student organizations
on campus. One or two groups

will be reviewed weekly by com
mittees from Legislature.
The Committee reporting on
the Student Faculty Commis

the Commission . . has recog

such associations could hotli
begin and develop."
