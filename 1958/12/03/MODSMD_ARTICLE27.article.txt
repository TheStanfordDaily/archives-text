# Little Hope for Cougars; Idaho Could Be Surprise

(Editor's Note: Third part of
a series of analyses of PCC
clubs for 1958-59.)

Washington State College seems
destined for a somewhat unsuc
cessful basketball season in 1958:
they are unanimous choices for
last place in the Pacific Coast
Conference.
It is possible thai the Cougars
may evade the ignominy of league
cellar-dweller, but their lack of
height, speed and scoring poten
tial makes this possibility distinct
ly remote.
The only heartening aspects of
the Cougar squad are a good de
fense and a (!-0 junior center nam
ed John Maras. Last season Ma
r-as scored 11.7 points per game
anrl led his team in rebounding.
The significance of these ac
complishments is in the fact that
the Cougars had a poor team last
year- they won 7 out of 2(5 games.
This last fact might have some
thing to do wilh the Cougars'
changing of coaches. Last sea
son's mentor, Jack Friel, retired
after 30 years in the business. He
ranked with the top 10 coaches in
the country in number of wins.
WSC's new coach is the man
who built a mighty basketball
team at Pacific Lutheranâ€”Marv
Harsh man.
Coach Harshman will face the
enemy with, in addition to Maras,
these men: forwards, 0-3 senior
1 )ick Axelson, a good defender,

and 6--1 soph Frank Reed, a prom
ising shot-maker; guards, 5-11 sen
ior Mei't Kennedy and 5-8 senior
Jim Ross; in reserve, 6-4 Bruce
Baker, 5-10 Jim Miles, 6-3 Duane
Ranniger and 5-10 Mike Agee, all
juniors, and 6-2 Larry Barclay and
6-1 Parke Minman, sophs.
The University of Idaho has a
basketball team that gives sports
writers headaches, for the Van
dals are neither definitely strong
nor obviously weak. Therefore
they have been dubbed outside
choices, dark horses, comers, up
starts, spoilers- everything that
denotes a team with potential hut
potential unproven.
A good deal of this potential is
vested in two ol' last year's stal
warts, guards Whaylon Coleman
and John Liveious. The former at
6-3 and the latter at 6-5 are ex
cellent shots and fine ball han
dlers.
But coach Harlan Ilodges will
need good seasons from all of his
squad if they are to equal last
year's record. That Vandal team,
paced by Gary Simmons, PCC's
leading scorer, compiled a 17-0
mark.
So 6-5 forward Weldon Wood
and 6-5 forward Jim Prestel, along
with 6-5 center Roily Williams
and reserves 6-2 Hal Damiano, 6-4
Roger Walts and 6-3 B. J. Schaef
fer, will have to come through for
the Vandals.
