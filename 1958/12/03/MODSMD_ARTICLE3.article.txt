# Trouble in Steam Pipes Results in Excavations
## 
### 
The corp yard has been having trouble with the pipes which re
turn the condensed steam to the new steam plant, as evidenced by
excavations on Galcez at Escondido and Serra.
Since these pipes are buried in corrugated steel casing, not ac
cessible tunnels, the maintenance crew has to dig up a considerable

pari, of the street to find a leak
at the joints.
The trouble is not caused by
additional pressure from the new
steam plant, according If) eorp
yard superintendent C. L. Black
er, but is merely the result of
wear on the 10-year-old pipes.
These pipes are, in his words,
"headaches." However, because of
the expense involved, he sees no
chance of installing the pipes in
tunnels, similar to the lines that
run from Encina to the Quad.
