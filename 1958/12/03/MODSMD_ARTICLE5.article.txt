### Lynn Delargey 
According to historian Geoffrey
Barraclough. the two dominant
problems of the second half of
the 20th century will be "the
struggle to provide even an ade
quate substratum for the world's
teeming population, and the
problem of race."
A student of medieval history
and professor at London's Royal
Institute of International Affairs,
Barraclough in his Tuesday eve
nint: lecture presented "new his
torical perspectives" on the post
war period which ended about
10.") and on the present era. His
lecture closed the fall Tuesday
series.
Since the end of the post-war
period, it has been easier, he said,
for the Western nations to see the
pattern of events: the declinc of
European nations, "the liberation
of Asia from European imperial
ism," and a consequent shift in
importance from the white to the
colored raecs.
To the Asians and Africans, the
struggles of the two major white
tional autonomy and standards of
anee to their own problems of tia
powers are of secondary import
living. Barraclough pointed out
that 1600 of the world's 2700 mil
lion people are underfed. The
Common Man of the age, he said,
is the fallahin and the coolie, and
"the new equilibrium has put
power in Ihe hands of his lead
ers."
