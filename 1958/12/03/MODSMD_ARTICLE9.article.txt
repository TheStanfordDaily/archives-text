## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale

to spirits) to be exceptionally funny.
No such luck.

In an attack on freshman
journals (you remember those

addicted.
Though it doesn't quite qualify
for the 'best humor' award, the
unusual angle found in "How To
Get It" is worth appraisal. But

become too preoccupied with
Tennessee Williams' use of the

antecedent in his title, well . . .
I wonder if the administration
will give audio-oscillators to the
Chappie staff for Christmas?
