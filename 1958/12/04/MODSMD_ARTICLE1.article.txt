# KZSU's Future Still Undecided

(Editor s Note: In Wednesday's Daily the conditions leading
np to the closing of KZSU, the campus radio station, were dis
cussed. Today's article, the last of a two-part series, reviews th«
possible future of the station.)
KZSU may decide to abandon its present system of sending its
broadcasts through wires to dormitories, in favor of broadcasting
through the air. The problem of interfering with regular radio would
cease—KZSU would itself bo a regular station. One transmitter
would broadcast to the whole Palo Alto area. There would be no
"dead areas" where KZSU could not be heard.
But since there are no available licenses to broadcast over AM
radio, which most people's radios receive, only those with an FM
radio could hear KZSU.
$25,000 For Overhaul
Phil Fialer, chief engineer of KZSU, has estimated that a thor
ough overhaul of KZSU's equipment for FM broadcasting would cost
about $23,000. This would include new soundproofing in the main
studio, a tape recorder and microphone leplacements. An FM trans
mitter could probably be purchased for about $3,000, Figler told The
Daily. A frequency modulator for $1,700 would also be necessary,
as well as an antenna with accessories—another $8,000.
FM licenses come in three categories: commercial, with adver
tising permitted; nonprofit commercial, which would also permit
advertising provided the station was not a profit-making venture and
the advertising only helped to meet costs; and educational, which
would permit no advertising.
KZSU business manager John Haye notes that the problem of
financing causes problems. Should Stanford secure a commercial
FM license, the Federal Communications Commission might require
it to broadcast during vacations when student personnel were not
available. But should a noncommercial F r M license be secured, there
could be no advertising revenues.
A dvertis in g It even ues
KZSU advertising was paying the University approximately $2,000
a year. The station personnel seem to be of the unanimous opinion
that advertising is of no use educationally—there simply isn't the
interest at Stanford to adequately staff an advertising department
for the station. Thus advertisements tend to be poorly written and
unenthusiastically sold.
It would be best, in the opinion of the station staff, if the Univer
sity would completely subsidise KZSU.
It would be much easier to get a noncommercial or educational
FM license than a commercial one. The FCC gives licenses out on
a first-come-first-served basis and then requires that the license he
forfeited if the station is not in operation within three months. As
a practical matter, however, operators frequently get licenses with
no intention of building a station, but hoping to sell the commercial
license later at a profit to someone wanting to build. Prices range
as high as $100,000.
License Loo/tholes
If such persons do not sell their licenses within three months, they
usually manage to forestall forfeiture of their licenses by excuses.
Should Stanford desire to build a station, it would have to enter
hearings before the FCC to prove that a particular license holder had
no intention of ever building a station.
The FCC has indicated that it would be eager to grant Stanford
an educational license, with no rights to advertise.
It may be possible to secure a nonprofit commercial license, with
less trouble than a regular commercial license; but the station man
agement committee has not yet heard from the FCC about this pos
sibility.
The University has not officially considered the question of elimi
nating advertising on KZSU and completely subsidizing its operation.
But Philip Rhinelander, dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, told The Daily that if KZSU were fulfilling "academic purpose"
