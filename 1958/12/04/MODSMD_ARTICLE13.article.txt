# Satellites Will Be Fired Soon From Santa Maria
## Cape Canaveral Moon Shot Due 
### Associated Press 
The first of a dozen or more
earth satellites will be fired from
close by Santa Maria, just soulh
of San Luis Obispo, in the near
future. SÂ»me of them will carry
mice and perhaps a monkey.
The satellites will be aimed at
orbits to take them around the
poles of the earth. The hope is
to fire perhaps one a month.
Initial launching attempts by
the Air Force from the new Van
denberg base at Santa Maria will
utilized 1,300-pound vehicles. They
will be powered by a Thor inter
mediate-range ballistic missile and
a second-stage liquid fuel engine.
More Later
From these initial attempts it
is expected that bigger efforts will
evolve, using Atlas intercontinen
tal ballistic missiles and multi-ton
satellite vehicles.
The Air Force will attempt to
bring the mice and the monkey
back from their journeys into
space instead of leaving the satel
lites to disintegrate when they de
scend into the air friction of the
atmosphere.
Russia's known successes in
putting huge satellites into orbit
and recent unofficial speculation
that the Soviets may have sent
up a moon probe rocket into outer
space is spurring the new Ameri
can effort.
Meanwhile, across the country
at Cape Canaveral, Fla., Juno 11,
the Army's first moon rocket, is
being readied for a trip that may
carry a satellite millions of miles
through outer space.
Open to View
The huge Jupiter C rocket sat
in the open for a brief period on
Tuesday after the service tower
was rolled back as part of the
early countdown for a firing that
may come this week end.
Speculation has centered on this
Saturday as the likely date. The
moon will be in favorable position
at that time for an attempt to
approach it.
The Army hopes to blast the
satellite farther into space than
any other man-made object on its
first try. As in the previous three
Air Force attempts, the chances
for success are slim.
Never Come Back
Dr. Wernher von Bran n, the
Army's German-born rocket chief,
said recently that if all goes well
Juno II could become a man-made
planet never returning to earth.
Unlike the Air Force probes,
which were fired toward an orbit
around the moon, the Army space
vehicle could soar millions of
miles beyond the earth and moon
until it fell into some unpredict
able orbit around the sun.
