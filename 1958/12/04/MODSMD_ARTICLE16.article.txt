toria) page, in which the editors discussed the proposals to par
tition the State of California.
The Chronicle notes that "time after time unhappy (lalifor
nians have cried out for separation."
The recent consideration of partition has arisen from debate
over water rights. Northern Californians have been confronted
by a bloc of southern Californiaus who refuse to consider water
rights in the north until their own terms have been met. Hence,
the north is complaining that the south holds too much political
power. On the other hand, it is worthy of note that the new
governor-elect and U.S. senator-elect are from northern California.
Besides the political controversy, there are dissimilarities be
tween the interests, cultures and general points of view o( the
two parts of the state which might make partition desirable.
Still another consideration is the loss of prestige and power
in Congress —which California is gaining- that could result from
a possible division.
If, from all points of view, a division of the state would be
come desirable, the problems would multiply. How would the
state be partitioned? Who would get what part of the state's
resources, records, property?
The question of state partitioning is not unique in California.
Texas, largest state in the Union until the admittance of Alaska,
has been subjected to talk of division; Alaska, after the state is
more fully developed, will likely undergo such a scrutiny; Idaho,
to cite another Western state, has wide differences of interests
between the southern part and the northern panhandle.
Differences within large states make the possibility of division
worth consideration —but worth action only after considerable in
vestigation into the prospects of resolving the differences and
improving the existing structure. The latter course should not be
ignored by those whose tempers flare when they are opposed in
some action.
