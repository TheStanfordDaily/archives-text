# Nightmarish Work Seen in Two Plays
## 
### A Review By Jerome W. Clinton 
"The Garden District," a set of
plays by Tennessee Williams, was
given its West Coast premiere in
San Francisco last Friday night
by the Actor's Workshop.
These two plays are less dra
matic works than simply night
marish excursions into the realm
of the spiritually decayed — Wil
liams' customary province.
The first of the pair, "Some
thing Unspoken," deals with the
relationship of two aging South
ern spinsters. The one, wealthy
and domineering, has in her old
age become "iron grey"; the oth
er, her weak, dependent compan
ion. has faded to a cobwebby dull
ness.
The weaker, however, has come
to dominate the stronger through
"something unspoken" which
binds them together. As the play
progresses, it becomes apparent
that this "something" is a partic
ularly ugly, unrequited Lesbian
ism.
Sterile Creatures
Winifred Mann as, Cornelia
Scott, and Neva Fowler, as Grace
Lancaster, successfully portray
these two sterile creatures as the
utterly uninteresting people they
are.
The second offering. "Suddenly
Last Summer," has not its com
panion's one saving grace—brev
ity. It is the story, posthumously
told, of the truly horrible death
of Sebastian Venable, an "artist
saint," at the barren altar of a
savage god.
The actual death scene, with all
its gruesomely sacrificial aspects,
is not explicitly described until the
last and most effective scene of
the play. It comes only after the
character of Sebastian has become
thoroughly familiar to us, both
through the eyes of his blatantly
worshipful mother and those of
her rival, Catherine Holly, the girl
whose inability to help Sebastian
when his mother's strength failed
led to his death.
Painfully Explicit
Williams allows Sebastian's
mother to be painfully explicit in
her tedious eulogies on the virtues
of her sainted son; yet through
them she appears, for all her cant
-.-.or superficiality, to be a far more
ruing character than Sebas

tian.
And the swarm of bloodsuckers
that clung about him would have
been fitter companions for a
dumb sacrificial cow than an in
cipient saint. Catherine, who gives
him the sincerest praise, can do
little more for him than try to
equate his use of people with love.
There is little plot to the expo
sition which precedes the actual
recounting of Sebastian's death,
and what little there is is discard
ed unresolved once the climactic
scene is reached.
Characters drift on and off the
•stage as if motivated only by their
own whimsy; and, often as not,
what they say has only a minimal
significance in the context of the
play. Symbols are introduced and
then left hovering about unex
plained—or discarded at will. And
the final scene, when finally in
troduced by the wholly specious
device of "truth seroum," is, for
all its dramatic impact, simply a
skillful exercise in horror.
Only Message
Williams' only message -seems
to be that the good are inarticu
late, incapable of a normal ex
pression of love and fated to be
blindly destroyed by a cruel god.
This is hardly an adequate vehicle
for a play, and its characters lend
nothing to its substance.
Beatrice Manley, as Mrs. Vena
ble, is in complete mastery of the
limited range of emotions which
she is called upon to express. Pris
cilla Pointer, as Catherine, carries
off her few good lines with telling
effect. And her mother and her
broth e r, played by Margaret
Doyle and Malcolm Smith, are
convincing as stereotyped "poor
relations."
Tom Rosqui takes the part of
Dr. Curowicz, the only sane char
acter in the play, but makes him
appear as only slightly less mad
than the others.
The direction of Vincent Por
caro does little to clarify the
play's innate diffuseness or lend
it a note of plausibility.
The musical accompaniment ad
equately captures the madly hu
morous character of the "dialogue,
and the sets and lighting serve to
heighten the nightmarish quali
ties of the work, with the conse
quent effect that it appears more
' study of animated nervous tics
.han a live drama.
