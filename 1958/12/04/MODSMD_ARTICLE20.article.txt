Something Lacking
Editor, The Daily:
About 100 students are spend
ing one-third of their tuition, or
approximately $10,000 to hear
the brilliant disertations of world
renowned Willmore Kendall on
the subtler aspects of political
theory. We are eager to listen
and learn, but unfortunately
something is lacking—the pres
ence of Willmore Kendall. It
seems as if the San Francisco
papers know more about our
illustrous leader than we do. Prof.
Kendall's fine reputation is too
firmly established for us to ques
tion it. The Army's intelligence
has never questioned it. The Po
litical Science Department didn't
question it. Albert Schweitzer
doesn't question it. But one judge
in the San Mateo County Court
did question it—to the tune of
$236. As stated in Plato's Laws,
"As a puppet drinks, his desires
increase swiftly, but his rational
facilities decrease, and he be
comes a child again." We hope
in the future that Prof. Kendall's
rational facilities do not decrease,
and that once again, we can prof
it from his unorganized but
worthwhile lectures. We hope
Yale's loss will not be our loss.

Political Science 150
Class.

background — Nov. 25 Prof.
Kendall was fined for
drunken driving.)
Whose School Is It?
Editor, The Daily:
Apparently the University offi
cials in charge of athletic events
no longer consider the Stanford
rooters the primary spectators,
of our basketball games. For the
past several years the seats in
the pavilion below the railing
have been held for the use of the
students. This season, and pre
sumably for coming seasons, they
have been reserved for those of
the public who purchase season
tickets at $16.50.
The students have thus been
deprived of the best seats in the
pavilion (unless they can afford
the price). Also, the cheer lead
ers and the pom-pon girls now
perform before a segment of Palo
Alto residents who sit between
the students and the basketball
floor.
This situation is particularly
galling to those rooters who used
to arrive early enough for every
game to sit in those seats, as well
as to those who just like to think
the team for whom they are yell
ing is representing their school
and them.
The Daily should do all possible
to see that this policy is not fol
lowed in the future, for probably
nothing can be done about it this
year. Damn it, this is supposed
to be our school, and its teams
our teams, not those of the gen
eral public!
A 1 Loomis
Proper Perspective
Editor, The Daily:
You and your reporter Roger
Folsom are to be congratulated
on the excellence and accuracy
of the report on KZSU in Wed
nesday's Daily. This article has,
for the first time in print, put
the various factors of ,the prob
lem in the proper perspective. The
wording of and impressions con
veyed by the article are, to the
best of my knowledge, exactly
correct.
There were two slight errors,
however. The former chief en
gineer's name is Phil Fialer,
spelled with an A as in accurate
and not with a G as in garbled.
Mike Chambreau was an officer
of the engineering department.
The program manager was Bill
DeArmond.
The matter of the "personal
hank account" needs to be clari
fied. The funds of KZSU were
held and spent by the University's
financial department. Never at
'any lime was any University

money in any personal bank ac
count of any station member (in
the last six years).
There was associated and co
operating with the station a non
profit corporation (a "person" in
the legal sense). This corpora
tion had two activities. The first
and main activity was to provide
additional funds for the mainten
ance of the station's equipment
and for the purchase of needed
new equipment for the station.
These funds were obtained by
renting equipment to student and
outside groups and by providing
special services (recordings) for 1
student groups. The main source
of revenue was the disc recor ding
student performances.
The second activity of this
corporation was to own and main
tain a Coca-Cola machine and cig
arette machine. These machines
were located in the offices of
KZSU and were for the conven
ience of the staff. Proceeds from
these machines were used pri
marily to buy incidental supplies
(non-alcoholic) for KZSU staff
par ties. Any remainder was trans
ferred to the equipment fund.
At no time was any money
paid to any person from this fund
except for actual work (bookkeep
ing or' recording) performed. The
wages were never more than $1
per actual hour worked.
