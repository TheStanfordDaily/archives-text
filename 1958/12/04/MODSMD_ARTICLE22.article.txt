# Central Location Keys German Difficulties

### A. E. Sokol Professor of International Security Affairs 
Situated in Uie center of Eu
rope, between the continent's!
southern ami northern, western j
and eastern extremities, Germany!
is the natural middleman between
the opposite regions, serving 1
| either as a buffer state to protect
| one end against aggressive moves
by the other, or as intermediary,
conveying new ideas from one to !
the other. The same heartland
position also enabled Germany, ]
I whenever it felt itself strong, toj
I expand at the expense of its nu
| merous neighbors, while it lost |
ground to them whenever the
country was disunited and weak, j
On the whole, throughout mod
ern history the main military j
threat came from the East, and
Germany frequently acted as the
chief bulwark of Western Europe
against invasion. On the other
hand, in the sphere of culture and I
economic life, the direction of in- j
| fluence ran most strongly from j
South to North, and from West to '
East.
Exposed to Danger
While Germany profited great
ly from the passage of goods and
ideas from one side to the other,
it was also constantly exposed to
danger that the powers surround
ing it would either combine a
gainst the middle, or fight out
their differences on German soil I
and at German expense. Perhaps
the best known example is the
Thirty Years' War, when the con
flict between Reformation and
Counter-Reformation brought the
German people close to extinc
tion.
The present German situation
is again influenced by these con- j
ditions. As a result of defeat,
Germany was divided into three
parts: The Federal Republic of
Germany (or West Germany);
the German Democratic Republic
(East Germany); and the "Lost
Provinces", where were annexed
by Poland and Russia. The Saar
Region, at first claimed by France
has since been reunited with West j
Germany, so that there are at i
present no territorial issues be :
tween 'Germany and the West, j
The existing division of Germany
is, however, not merely a political
| one, but also involves a culture |
j break, since West Germany,
I strongly gravitates toward the
West and the Free World type of
democracy, while East Germany
is or iented politically, economical
ly, and ideologically toward the:
Soviet Union.
Problems Result
Some of the most pressing and
i potentially dangerous problems
confronting Germany and the
West today are the direct conse- j
quence of this division and weak-!

ening ol Europe's center:
1) Should the divided country
turn West or East for the alliance
which is needed nowadays to as- j
sine political, economic, military, l
and ideological security?
Following historical precedent,
t he majority of Germans, led by
Chancellor Adenauer, prefers a
s tronge r association with the
Wester n Democracies. This does j
not preclude, however', a smaller i
group advocating closer relations I
with the Soviet Bloc, or' the play
ing of one side against the other j
to gain concessions from both.
2) How can the reunification;
of Germany, and the eventual re
capture of the lost provinces, best
be achieved?
Powerful Threat
A divided Germany constitutes
a powerful threat to world peace.
But how can the problem be
solved without war ? Again, most
Germans favor a policy which
will make the country strong so
as to be in a better position to
deal with the Communists. Hence
they are working for a closer in
tegration of Western Europe,
German member ship in NATO, j
and anything else which promises j
to strengthen the West. But it
must be remembered that actual
ly the eastern parts of Germany
are under Communist domination
and not in the hands of the West
ern World. The Communists cert
ainly cannot be expected to give
up those territories just to help
the West. What price will they ex
peel for relinquishing them?
.'■{) Will Western Germany re
tain its present attachment to the
West, or' will it, under certain eir-1
cumstances, turn against it? Fori

instance, what would happen if
the Communists promise terri
torial concessions in return for a
German betrayal of the West?
The chances for such a turn
about seem slight. Traditionally,
the Germans consider themselves
a part of the west. They foresee a
better future as a Western asso
ciate than as a Soviet satellite.
4) Is there danger of a recrude
scence of Nazism in Germany?
National Socialism of Hitler
brand is a historical phenomenon
unlikely to repeat itself. Besides,
Germany has paid a heavy price
for its guilt. However, if the coun
try should go through another
political, economic, and psycho
logical depression as it did after
the First World War, if it is again
swept by a wave of hopelessness
and despair, some other violent
reaction might well be expected.
5) What is Germany's value as
an ally of the West?
In virtually every field Ger
many can make a most valuable
contribution to the power poten
tial of the West. It can again be a
shield against Eastern encroach
ment, while its loss might have
most unfavorable consequences
by dipping the scales too far in
favor of the Soviets.
But by taking advantage of the
potential benefits Germany has
to offer, the Western World also
assumes a responsibility, accepts
a price to be paid: Not only must
Germany, the arch enemy of yes
terday, be treated as an equal
partner, but regardless of the pos
sible consequences, its problems
must become part and parcel of
the West's own interests and
' committments.

tain its present attachment to the
West, or' will it, under certain eir-1
cumstances, turn against it? Fori

4) Is there danger of a recrude
scence of Nazism in Germany?
National Socialism of Hitler
brand is a historical phenomenon
unlikely to repeat itself. Besides,
Germany has paid a heavy price
for its guilt. However, if the coun
try should go through another
political, economic, and psycho
logical depression as it did after
the First World War, if it is again
swept by a wave of hopelessness
and despair, some other violent
reaction might well be expected.
5) What is Germany's value as
an ally of the West?
In virtually every field Ger
many can make a most valuable
contribution to the power poten
tial of the West. It can again be a
shield against Eastern encroach
ment, while its loss might have
most unfavorable consequences
by dipping the scales too far in
favor of the Soviets.
But by taking advantage of the
potential benefits Germany has
to offer, the Western World also
assumes a responsibility, accepts
a price to be paid: Not only must
Germany, the arch enemy of yes
terday, be treated as an equal
partner, but regardless of the pos
sible consequences, its problems
must become part and parcel of
the West's own interests and
' committments.

On the whole, throughout mod

threat came from the East, and
Germany frequently acted as the
chief bulwark of Western Europe
against invasion. On the other
hand, in the sphere of culture and I
economic life, the direction of in- j
| fluence ran most strongly from j
South to North, and from West to '
East.
Exposed to Danger
While Germany profited great
ly from the passage of goods and
ideas from one side to the other,
it was also constantly exposed to
danger that the powers surround
ing it would either combine a
gainst the middle, or fight out
their differences on German soil I
and at German expense. Perhaps
the best known example is the
Thirty Years' War, when the con
flict between Reformation and
Counter-Reformation brought the
German people close to extinc
tion.
The present German situation
is again influenced by these con- j
ditions. As a result of defeat,
Germany was divided into three
parts: The Federal Republic of
Germany (or West Germany);
the German Democratic Republic
(East Germany); and the "Lost
Provinces", where were annexed
by Poland and Russia. The Saar
Region, at first claimed by France
has since been reunited with West j
Germany, so that there are at i

The existing division of Germany
is, however, not merely a political

j break, since West Germany,
I strongly gravitates toward the
West and the Free World type of
democracy, while East Germany
is or iented politically, economical
ly, and ideologically toward the:
Soviet Union.
Problems Result
Some of the most pressing and
i potentially dangerous problems
confronting Germany and the
West today are the direct conse- j
quence of this division and weak-!

ening ol Europe's center:
1) Should the divided country
turn West or East for the alliance
which is needed nowadays to as- j
sine political, economic, military, l
and ideological security?
Following historical precedent,
t he majority of Germans, led by
Chancellor Adenauer, prefers a
s tronge r association with the
Wester n Democracies. This does j
not preclude, however', a smaller i

with the Soviet Bloc, or' the play
ing of one side against the other j
to gain concessions from both.

of Germany, and the eventual re
capture of the lost provinces, best
be achieved?
Powerful Threat
A divided Germany constitutes
a powerful threat to world peace.
But how can the problem be
solved without war ? Again, most
Germans favor a policy which
will make the country strong so

they are working for a closer in

German member ship in NATO, j
and anything else which promises j
to strengthen the West. But it
must be remembered that actual

are under Communist domination

is or iented politically, economical
ly, and ideologically toward the:
Soviet Union.
Problems Result
Some of the most pressing and
i potentially dangerous problems
confronting Germany and the
West today are the direct conse- j
quence of this division and weak-!

ening ol Europe's center:
1) Should the divided country
turn West or East for the alliance
which is needed nowadays to as- j
sine political, economic, military, l
and ideological security?
Following historical precedent,
t he majority of Germans, led by
Chancellor Adenauer, prefers a
s tronge r association with the
Wester n Democracies. This does j
not preclude, however', a smaller i
group advocating closer relations I
with the Soviet Bloc, or' the play
ing of one side against the other j
to gain concessions from both.
2) How can the reunification;
of Germany, and the eventual re
capture of the lost provinces, best
be achieved?
Powerful Threat
A divided Germany constitutes
a powerful threat to world peace.
But how can the problem be
solved without war ? Again, most
Germans favor a policy which
will make the country strong so
as to be in a better position to
deal with the Communists. Hence
they are working for a closer in
tegration of Western Europe,
German member ship in NATO, j
and anything else which promises j
to strengthen the West. But it
must be remembered that actual
ly the eastern parts of Germany
are under Communist domination
and not in the hands of the West
ern World. The Communists cert
ainly cannot be expected to give
up those territories just to help
the West. What price will they ex
peel for relinquishing them?
.'■{) Will Western Germany re
tain its present attachment to the
West, or' will it, under certain eir-1
cumstances, turn against it? Fori

instance, what would happen if
the Communists promise terri
torial concessions in return for a
German betrayal of the West?
The chances for such a turn
about seem slight. Traditionally,
the Germans consider themselves
a part of the west. They foresee a
better future as a Western asso
ciate than as a Soviet satellite.
4) Is there danger of a recrude
scence of Nazism in Germany?
National Socialism of Hitler
brand is a historical phenomenon
unlikely to repeat itself. Besides,
Germany has paid a heavy price
for its guilt. However, if the coun
try should go through another
political, economic, and psycho
logical depression as it did after
the First World War, if it is again
swept by a wave of hopelessness
and despair, some other violent
reaction might well be expected.
5) What is Germany's value as
an ally of the West?
In virtually every field Ger
many can make a most valuable
contribution to the power poten
tial of the West. It can again be a
shield against Eastern encroach
ment, while its loss might have
most unfavorable consequences
by dipping the scales too far in
favor of the Soviets.
But by taking advantage of the
potential benefits Germany has
to offer, the Western World also
assumes a responsibility, accepts
a price to be paid: Not only must
Germany, the arch enemy of yes
terday, be treated as an equal
partner, but regardless of the pos
sible consequences, its problems
must become part and parcel of
the West's own interests and
' committments.
Situated in Uie center of Eu
rope, between the continent's!
southern ami northern, western j
and eastern extremities, Germany!
is the natural middleman between

by the other, or as intermediary,

the other. The same heartland
position also enabled Germany, ]
I whenever it felt itself strong, toj
I expand at the expense of its nu

ground to them whenever the
country was disunited and weak, j
On the whole, throughout mod
ern history the main military j
threat came from the East, and
Germany frequently acted as the
chief bulwark of Western Europe
against invasion. On the other
hand, in the sphere of culture and I
economic life, the direction of in- j
| fluence ran most strongly from j
South to North, and from West to '
East.
Exposed to Danger
While Germany profited great
ly from the passage of goods and
ideas from one side to the other,
it was also constantly exposed to
danger that the powers surround
ing it would either combine a
gainst the middle, or fight out
their differences on German soil I
and at German expense. Perhaps
the best known example is the
Thirty Years' War, when the con
flict between Reformation and
Counter-Reformation brought the
German people close to extinc
tion.
The present German situation
is again influenced by these con- j
ditions. As a result of defeat,
Germany was divided into three
parts: The Federal Republic of
Germany (or West Germany);
the German Democratic Republic
(East Germany); and the "Lost
Provinces", where were annexed
by Poland and Russia. The Saar
Region, at first claimed by France
has since been reunited with West j
Germany, so that there are at i
present no territorial issues be :
tween 'Germany and the West, j
The existing division of Germany
is, however, not merely a political
| one, but also involves a culture |
j break, since West Germany,
I strongly gravitates toward the
West and the Free World type of
