# Sequoia Revived: '55
## 
### Jim Beebe 
Literary magazines have had a
hazardous history on the Farm.
Only "Sequoia", which was also
the name of the first literary on
campus, had a history of more
than 10 years. Interest in a liter
ary magazine on campus has per
iodically revived, usually three or
four years after the failure of the
last o^e.
The present "Sequoia" resulted
from a rivival of interest in the
spring of 1955, about two years
after "Viewpoint," the last maga
zine, had stopped publication. In
the late spring of 1955 with Dr.
Wilfred Stone of the English de
partment as faculty advisor and
Linda Lovelace as the first editor,
plans were begun for a new mag
azine.
During the summer letters
were sent to perspective staff
members and contributors. In the
following autumn a staff and
board were selected and work be
gun on the first issue.
Needed Article
The Board decided that an art
icle on some phase of the arts and
an outside feature, in addition to
the best short stories and poetry
of Stanford students would be in
cluded in every issue. The outside
article has usually been by some
"name" author, but occasionally
it is by someone else, For example
John McNees, then a sophomore
at Harvard, wrote the outside art
idle for the spring issue last year.
A faculty committee was also
set up independent of "Sequoia"
to read all manuscripts submitted
to the magazine. If the committee

thinks any manuscript is quali
fied to be published and indicates
about 30 hours of work, they may
petition for one unit of "A" credit
to be given to the author.
New Sequoia
In the winter quarter 1956 the
first issue of the new "Sequoia"
came out. Due to pessimistic
warnings that it would be fortu
nate if fSOO copies were sold, only
700 were printed. These copies
were sold out in a matter of
hours; of a second printing of
500, 400 were sold.
In the following spring
"Sequoia moved its office from a
cornor in the stacks to its present
location in the temporary build
ing behind the Civ library. The
spring issue sold a little less than
1,000 copies on campus, proving
that the volume of original was
not due to mere curiosity but to
a real interest in a student maga
zine. Dr. Otis Pease of the history
succeeded Dr. Stone as faculty ad
visor this quarter.
Today the "Sequoia" is almost
selfsustaining, receiving a small
subsidy from the Student Publi
cations Board, which includes The
Daily, Quad, Chappie, and
"Sequoia." Throughout its history
the "Sequoia" has enjoyed a grow
ing circulation.
At its present circulation of
about 1500, the "Sequoia" is one
of the most widely read collegiate
literary magazine in the nation.
The present staff is headed by
Anne Humphreys, editor; Jerome
Clinton, managing editor; and
Roger Dingman, business man
ager.
