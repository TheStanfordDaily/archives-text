ARE PROFESSORS, by George
Williams. Published by Abe
lard-Schuman, 250 pp., $3.95.
In this extremely readable
study, Dr. Williams (a professor
himself at Rice Institute) looks
into the current American college
scene and comes to the conclusion
that, since only 60-6.1 per cent of
those who begin college are in
terested enough by what they find
to remain for a degree, and since
only 10-15 per cent of these ever
develop "a deep and abiding in
terest in learning," the college is
failing in its designed end.
The chief cause of this failure,
according to Dr. Williams, is to be
found in the college and univer
sity professor.
The average university profes
sor begins life as a "bookish boy"
who withdraws from society at an
early age. After suffering in grade
•school from his antisocial tenden
cies, he suddenly finds himself
idolized in college for his "intel
lect."
He enters graduate school sup
ported either by a working wife
("both he and she being in a con
t in u a 1 monthly anguish as to
whether she will become preg
nant'.') or some scholarship or fel
lowship that pays him barely
enough to keep alive.
Throughout this time ("about
four years") he develops the habit,
of deferring intellectually to his
professors, who hold in their
hands the power of permanently
blighting his whole career.
The result of t his background is
usually a permanently blighted
personality: too conservative to
think independently, too timid to
assert itself against administra
tive pressure—hardly the type to
achieve rapport with students.
Williams divides professors into
several recognizable categories:
• The Good Professor: His stu
dents learn well what he has to
teach them about his subject, and
to enjoy the process of learning.
No more than 5 per cent are in
this category.
• The Plain Stupid Professor:
A rule-follower who doesn't want
to learn anything new or revamp
his old ideas to make them con
sistent with current reality.
• The Sumy Professor: Imper
turbably confident in himself. He
has proved to his own satisfaction
that he is a pretty smart fellow.
• The Arrogant Professor: He
takes (jut all the unhappiness, hos
tility and scorn suffered as a grad
uate student and young instructor
upon his students and upon the
faculty members lower than him
self on the academic ladder.
• The Antisocial Professor: He
simply does not like people. He
likes science or scholarship, books
and libraries, but he has no real
human warmth or ability to ap
proach either his students or his
colleagues in human terms.
• The "Good Buddy" Professor:
He tries to "pal around" with his
students, be their companion and
their equal. He wants them to
value his friendship, not what he
has to teach them.
• The Character Professor: He
utilizes stage properties a tweed
suit, a pipe, a deep voice, a dis
tinctive accent —to create an at
mosphere of urbanity, civilization
and culture where none exists.
• The Professor-Turned-Execu
tive: He sees education as a mass
production operation; his superior
is "the chief," his colleagues "the
team." He teaches in an extreme
ly businesslike way, with the stu

dents becoming so many items to
be processed. Education is entire
ly divorced from personalities and
individuals.
Williams' thesis throughout is
that whatever else university pro
fessors can do, they cannot teach.
From the most elementary un
dergraduate courses taught by
young, unexperienced teachers,
(usually graduate students who
are not expected to be able to
teach) to the most advanced grad-!
uate courses taught by those who
are most experienced (usually
someone more interested in pre
senting a "good, stiff course" than
in having the student learn any
thing), there is little or no teach
ing.
One of the reasons for this con
dition is the relentless pressure
upon the professor to publish
something -anything that he can
get published. The saddest thing
about this frenzied research for
publication is the havoc it wreaks
with the professor as teacher.
"Goo d teaching counts for j
nothing at all in the major uni
versities. To be sure, presidents
and heads of departments are
continually protesting that, oh
yes, good teaching is too recog
nized and rewarded. But this is
9!) per cent fiction. . . . Wltal is
needed is less publication, bet
ter publication and recognition 1
that a professor's chief moral
responsibility is toward his stu
dents, not toward the task of
getting his name in print."
As a university student myself,
I must affirm that Williams' anal
ysis of the teaching abilities of
many university professors is, un
fortunately, too true.
As a graduate teaching assist
ant who hopes some day to be a
professor, I must affirm that Wil
liams' analysis of the professorial
background and personality is
painfully accurate.
