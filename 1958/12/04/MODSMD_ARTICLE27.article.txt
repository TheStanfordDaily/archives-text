# Cards Face Cow Palace Mixes
## 
### 
Ray Area basketball addicts will have their first lost weekend of
the season at the Cow Palace Friday and Saturday, as Stanford,
UCLA, St. Mary's and Santa Clara get together in a par of round
ball doubleheaders.
All four teams are rated among the best on the Coast, with many
experts placing St. Mary's light alongside Washington in preseason
rankings. Stanford meets Santa Clara in the 7:30 opener of Friday's

action while UCLA takes on St.
Mary's at 9. The Cards and Bruins
trade opponents for Saturday
with the Tribe St. Mary's clash
also at 7:30.
Broncos Unchanged
Coach Bob Feerick's Broncos
are virtually the same as last

year. Heading a long list of re
turnees is all-star nominee Frank
Sobrero, a G-3 hoi shot who aver
aged 15.6 points a game last sea
son.
Other prominent Bronc veterans
are 6-4 George Gardiner, an im
portant reserve last season; 6-6
center Mel Prescott and 6-1 guard
Jim Taylor. Expected to round
out Feeriek's first five is 6-3 Jim
Russi, up from last season's
bench.
Jerry Bachieh, a 6-4 play-any
thing who burned up Pavilion
nets two years ago, heads this
season's bench. Also figuring to
he heard from are 6-S John
Marshal], and 6-1 Dave Dawson.
The Broncos opened their sea
son with a fairly easy 49-32 win
over San Francisco State. Russi
topped scorers in that one with
14, while Sobero scored 10.
Gaels Promising
But if things look generally
good for Santa Clara, they look
generally great for the Galloping
Gaels of St. Mary's.
Returning to the fold this year
are last season's two top scorers
and rebounders, Laroy Doss and
Dick Sigaty, both 6-5. And with
them are 6 3 Joe Barry, nil Bob
by Dold and 6 1 Larry Brennan,
all key men last season.
Despite all the veterans, it is
the sophomores who excite Mora
gans. Heading the group up from
last year's 17-0 frosh team is 6-5
Torn Merschery and there are
other potential stars in G-X AI
Claiborne, 5-10 Joe Gardere and
6-0 Gene Womack.
The Gaels were short of great
in their opener, however, man
aging only a 68-51 victory over
weak Sacramento Stale.

The Broncos opened their sea
son with a fairly easy 49-32 win
over San Francisco State. Russi
topped scorers in that one with
14, while Sobero scored 10.
Gaels Promising
But if things look generally
good for Santa Clara, they look
generally great for the Galloping
Gaels of St. Mary's.
Returning to the fold this year
are last season's two top scorers
and rebounders, Laroy Doss and
Dick Sigaty, both 6-5. And with
them are 6 3 Joe Barry, nil Bob
by Dold and 6 1 Larry Brennan,
all key men last season.
Despite all the veterans, it is
the sophomores who excite Mora
gans. Heading the group up from
last year's 17-0 frosh team is 6-5
Torn Merschery and there are
other potential stars in G-X AI
Claiborne, 5-10 Joe Gardere and
6-0 Gene Womack.
The Gaels were short of great
in their opener, however, man
aging only a 68-51 victory over
weak Sacramento Stale.

Ray Area basketball addicts will have their first lost weekend of
the season at the Cow Palace Friday and Saturday, as Stanford,
UCLA, St. Mary's and Santa Clara get together in a par of round

experts placing St. Mary's light alongside Washington in preseason
rankings. Stanford meets Santa Clara in the 7:30 opener of Friday's

action while UCLA takes on St.
Mary's at 9. The Cards and Bruins
trade opponents for Saturday
with the Tribe St. Mary's clash
also at 7:30.
Broncos Unchanged
Coach Bob Feerick's Broncos
are virtually the same as last

year. Heading a long list of re
turnees is all-star nominee Frank
Sobrero, a G-3 hoi shot who aver
aged 15.6 points a game last sea
son.
Other prominent Bronc veterans
are 6-4 George Gardiner, an im
portant reserve last season; 6-6
center Mel Prescott and 6-1 guard
Jim Taylor. Expected to round
out Feeriek's first five is 6-3 Jim
Russi, up from last season's
bench.
Jerry Bachieh, a 6-4 play-any
thing who burned up Pavilion
nets two years ago, heads this
season's bench. Also figuring to
