# Huskies Picked for Conference Title: California Takes on Darkhorse Role
##

(Editor's Note: This concludes
the series of analyses of I'CC
chilis the Indians will lace this
year.)

Two healthy young gentlemen
named Doug Smart and Bruno
Boin are back together again, and
the University of Washington
Huskies are already packing their
bags for Louisville and the NCAA
basketball tournament.
'I his year the Huskies are elig
ible for NCAA honors, and this
year they find themselves the al

'most universal choice as pre-sea
| son favorite in the Pacific Coast
Conference.
But the Huskies are going to
get an argument from two-time
defending champion California,
which assumes one of the loop's
"dark horse" roles.
This is the? y< ar t'nat the Wash
ington <'age fans have been wait
ing for. Fioin, G-9 All-Coast center
in 1956 and 1957, was held out
of action last season so he could
complete his college career this
year when the Huskies come out
from under the bonds of football
penalties to be eligible for the
national title.
But it isn't that Boin alone is
so great for now also a
senior is Doug Smart, 0-7 two time
unanimous All Coast forward,
who is generally considered no
thing more than the best all-a
round basketball player in the
conference.
Dismal Year
Last season things were rather
dismal for Coach Tippy Dye and
the Huskies. Smart was his usual
great self, but even he couldn't
offset the great dearth of mat
erial at the guard spots and con
trolling Smart alone (although he
averaged better than 20 points a
game) was considerably easier
than stopping the two giants.
To top this off, the expected
wealth of sophomore material
never blossomed last season. Earl
Irvine, 6-4 hooker who had been
shattering Boin's and Smart's
Seattle prep records, found the
going very rough and not until
late in the season was ho able to
score effectively.
Another highly touted soph, A 1
Murphy, was even more of a dis
appointment. Murphy was just
one of several Husky outside men
who couldn't score with consis
tency.
Most of last year's little men
are back, and Dye hopes for im
provement. Possibly the best of!
them is 6-0 junior George Grant,

a late comer last season. Also
returning are 6 3 Ron Crowe, 5-10
Lou Coast on and 5-9 Johnny Pari
seau.
The situation wasn't helped any
by a poor Washington freshman
team last season. Only one real
prospect is up from the frosh, but
he's a good one; 6-0 guard Clint
Names. A prep teammate of
Grant, Names is a great jump
shooter who scored 39 points in
his final high school state tourna
ment. game. He may be the ans
wer to Washington's backcourt
dilemma.
Ail in all, the optimism abounds
around Husky ville. With Boin's
great long hook-shooting and
Smart's tremendous all-around in
side play, Washington hopes to
regain some of the local attention
lost to a fellow named Elgin Bay
lor and Seattle University for the
past few seasons.
At California, prospects are a
bit different. Coach Pete Newell
usually brings his Bears along
without much hoop-la, and for
two straight seasons his "bunch
of big blond guys" has won the
PCC title.
Best of the "big blond guys"
last year Don Mcintosh, is gone,
and so is All-Coast guard Earl
Robinson. But two starters are
back and there are still plenty of
those husky Norsemen.
Kile!) Back
Six-three forward Bob Dalton,
the epitome of the Cal eager—
steady—is one of the Bear return
ing starters. The other is 6-2
guard A 1 Buch, a New Yorker
who still swishes the long two
handers and displays speed as if
he were still in the East.
Last year's sixth man, 6-5 Jack
Grout, returns and should team
with Dalton to give the Bears a
sound forward combination. The
task of filling Mcintosh's shoes
at center may fall to 6 8 Darrell
Tmhoff. who, like Mac, is big and
blond. Pressing him will be equal
ly tall Dick Doughty.
Buch's expected partner in the
backcourt will be Denny Fitz
patrick.
For bench strength, Newell has
only a fair amont of experience,
but good height: 6-7 Stan Morri
son. 6-4 sophomore flash Earl
Shult/, 6-4 Earle Schneider (big
and blond), and 6-4 Bob Washing
ton.
It is beginning to look like the
Bears should never be counted
out of the PCC hoop race. They
play the steadiest and headiest
game of all the Coast fives, with
a particular aversion to making
any kind of mistakes.
