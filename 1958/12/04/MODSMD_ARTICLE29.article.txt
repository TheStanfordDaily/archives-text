They Said 11, No I lis
"Just wait 'til basketball!"
This was the parting shot of the University of Washington yell
leaders after they had seen their Husky football team lose to Stan
ford this fall. We've waited, Huskies, and we're ready.
Monday night's opening win over San Jose State didn't reveal'
much, for the Spartans turned out to he pretty weak competition.
But if there were any there who had doubted that Stanford could
shoot: they must have been satisfied by Monday's display, particular
ly by two dandies named Paul Neumann and John Arrillaga.
Neumann showed ;iil of the class that has him marked as the
finest guard in the conference. This point will be argued by sup
porters of Whaylon Coleman at Idaho, Ai Hucli at California or Walt
Torrence at I CI.A; but Neumann's overall shooting, passing and all
around offensive show in the half game he played Monday gave indi
cations that he may reach that greatness that's been predicted for j
him.
Defensively, I'aul and the rest of the Cards looked at times a little
100 eager to steal the hall, hut the Spartans' inept ball handling at
Hu 1 offset made thievery look attractive.
We'll know a great real more by Saturday night, after ihc Indians
have met always rugged Sarda Clara Friday and St. .Mary's at the |
Cow Palace.
OfJ the general line of preseason ratings, the St. Mary's clash !
could be pretty much a "Bay Area Championship" for the Gaels !
are tabbed as one of the Coast's finest outfits, and the Cards have
been rated ahead of California in

most l)iiI not .-ill of the fore- 112
casts.
After the weekend's clashes
the club lakes a two week rest for
some trifling things called finals
arid then complete its pre-league
schedule against some pretty
rugged foes: University of San
Francisco, Minnesota, Illinois,
Arizona and the Olympic Club.
Then they run into those Husk
ies and the Conference again.
There is no doubt that the UW
yell-leaders had good reason to
threaten us with basketball back
in October. For the Huskies have
satisfied themselves, and the fore
casters, that they are the class of
the ( oast.
Again, there is reason. We
can't see any college team this
yeai matching the Huskies' one
two punch of Kruno Koin l(i-9)
and ISmart ((5-7i. Hut while
that is plenty, that is all.
A certain NCAA champion
would be a combination of ihe

Stanford and Washington teams. The Huskies have just what Stan
lord needs: height. And the ('arils have just what Washington lacks: !
speed, and shooting and consistency out front.
The rebounding will have to be improved if the Indians are go
ing to give Smart and Koin a battle. A few inches taller, Dick Haga
would be the toughest board man in the conference. Now, at (>-*1 1 -,
he's up against some pretty rugged odds.
Haga will battle it out with anybody in the rebounding depart
ment. San .lose learned this. But when Haga was out of the lineup,
the rebounds became too few . . . and Sail -lose had no great height,
itself. Once again, we'll know more by this weekend, for St. Mary's
will send a 6-5, (i-6, 6-tt front line into battle.
The Tribe opens its league season with a three-game tour in the!
Northwest, against Washington State, Idaho, and Oregon State. From \
the forecasts, only Idaho is figured to be a big problem.
The Vandals face much the same problem as Stanford: lack of real
height. Hut the overall height of the Vandals will match any in- the
league. One basketball magazine visioned a starting lineup of (5-5. â– 
6-5. 6-5, 6-5, and 6-3. At any rate, three of the 6-5 itien figure to be I
starting for certain.
Also like Stanford, Idaho finished with a redhot flourish last
season and hopes to pick up where it left off.
Skyscrapers, Of Course, at OSC
NEW FACES TO WATCH: Almost all of the PCC clubs may have !
1o rely on sophomores in key positions this season, discounting
Stanford.
At Oregon State, Slats (iill is going to have to call on a pair of
yearlings to help restore the usual Beaver height: <i6 Steve Flynn
and 6-f) Karl Anderson. Flynn may be a familiar name to some of
the local fans as he played his high school ball at Mountain View!
and mixed it up with a number of the current Tribesmen in a
Papoost -Mountain View game two years ago.
Anderson, from Fremont High of Oakland, has a deadly little hook
shot that cotyd make him a great one before he's through.
I ( I A is wild about its 6-10 sensation, Warneli Jones, but Coach
Johnny Wooden isn't even sure that Jones can crack his starting
lineup.
Idaho seems certain to get two of its 6-5 starters from a sophomore
group: ltollie Williams, prep All-American at Kellogg, Idaho; and
Weldon Wood. WSC expects to have at least one yearling in its
first five: Frank Heed or Parke Himnan.
Washington, for a change, doesn't have an impressive sophomore
crop, although guard Clint Names could be a starter. Oregon figures
to start 6-5 Denny Strickland at one forward. As for the rest
Stanford, Cul and Southern Cal veterans are dominant, although
IJSC figures to have a pretty good drawing card in sophomore Kill
Engessor, a mere 7-6 in altitude.
The best of the lot may bo OSC's Anderson, although there is a
feeling he may take at least a year to prove it. Names, at Washing
ton, could be the answer to the Huskies' backcourt troubles and
Williams at Idaho seems a pretly solid bet to be a future star. At
any rate, a great sophomore year usually means a great career, foj
both Koin and Smart were on everybody's All-Coast as sophs.
