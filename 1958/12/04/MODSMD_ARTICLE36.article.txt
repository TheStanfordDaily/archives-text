# Police Force Veteran Retires
## 
### 
A familiar face on the Stanford
police force has been missing
since Dec. 1.
Sgt. Edward J. Farmin, a mem
ber of the force for 18 years, has
resigned to take a job in the mail
ing department of the Stanford
Libraries.
Sergeant Farmin started at the
bottom of the department when
he came here in 1940. and worked
his way up. He has seen tho force
grow from five men and one pa
trol car to 14 men and three cars.
While doing general police work
Farmin encountered all kinds of
people. Once he stopped a car
that was being driven down Palm
Drive backward. It turned out
that the car had been rented, and
in order to -save mileage (and
money) the driver was backing
up all the way home.
