## New Award Plan Passed By LASSU 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Weeks of discussion, investiga
tion and controversy over new
athletic award proposals came to
an end Wednesday night as Legis
lature unanimously approved the
measures.
The new plan calls for more
equitable determination of win
tiers and provides for a different
award than previously given.
Athletes will receive distinctive
jackets for their first varsity
award, rings for their second, and
blankets for the third. The awards
phase of the program was insti
tuted because of disregard and
disrespect for block S sweaters
given in previous years.
Two Changes
Two principal changes were
made before LASSU gave final ap
proval. The first abolished award
determining duties of an athletics
committee of LASSU which was
found to not exist. The second
changed provisions for cross-coun
try awards, which had been con
fused with those of track in the
first draft of the proposal.
One further clarification was
made by assistant athletic direc
tor Chuck Taylor, who was pres
ent to clarify points of dispute
and discussion. A provision exists
that a sport, to be recognized,
must participate in an organized
conference.
Could Use NCAA
Taylor said that in view of the
Pacific Coast Conference situa
tion. and the present indecision
about Stanford's future in any
conference, the provision could be
liberally interpreted to include the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation, of which Stanford is a
member, as a conference.
In other business, LASSU ap
proved names of potential speak
ers for an lIR April Foreign Pol
icy Institute and heard associate
general secretary James Triolo
outline University fund-raising
problems. The latter was in con
nection with a LASSU committee
investigation into the possibilities
of establishing donations by vari
ous classcs.
