# FINN CABINET
## Russ Pressure Blamed for Fall 
### 
HELSINKI, Finland (/P)—Finland's 19th government since World
War II fell Thursday, a victim of Soviet economic pressure.
It was the Center-Conservative coalition government of Prime
Minister August Fagerholm. The Soviets never liked it.
The Soviet Union had simply refused to do business with the Finns

who must have that trade to
survive since the Fagerholm re
gime took office Aug. 29. That
put the squeeze on the Cabinet.
Fagerholm gave up after three

months of trying to hold together
a coalition of his right-wing So
cial Democrats, Agrarians, splin
ter Conservatives and a Swedish
minority.
They were motivated by the
steadily declining relations with
the Soviet Union which had post
poned scheduled trade talks, and
put a vital fishing treaty on the
shelf. Exports to Finland were cut
off, the Soviet Union claiming a
trade imbalance. The Soviet am
bassador to Finland left without
giving the traditional farewell.
The Soviet Union user! these
tactics to show displeasure over
two facts:
• The big Communist bloc was
ignored in the formation of the
Fagerholm government.
• Left-wing Socialist Democrats
backed by the trade unions were
left out in the cold.
Never fully recovered from the
drain of war reparations paid to
the Soviet Union, the Finns find
themselves in this position: They
are against the Soviet Union polit
ically, but need it economically.
