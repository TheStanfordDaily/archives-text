# Red States Berlin Air Travel Illegal
## 
### 
BFJRLIN East German Communist leader said Thursday
night commercial airliners from tlie West have no legal right to fly
into West Berlin. His impied challenge came as West German
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer campaigned in the Berlin streets for an
anti-Communist victory in the city parliamentary election Sunday.

The air issue was raised by
Politburo member Hermann Ma
tern at a Red election rally.
Matern told 3,500 cheering Com
munists meeting in the heart of
West Berlin that the Allied com
mercial planes had no right to fly

over the sovereign Hast German
territory and declared: "This situ
ation must be brought in order."
Matern did not make clear
whether the East Germans intend
to begin interfering now with
flights of Pan American Airways,
Air France and British European
Airways through three air corri
dors linking Berlin to West Ger
many about 100 miles away.
Warning
But his statement was regarded
as an unmistakable warning that.
East Germany will try to disrupt
commercial air traffic if the West
refuses to accept a Soviet demand
to turn West Berlin into a demili
tarized neutral city.
The flights now are under Bit;
Four accords on West Berlin's
status, which the Soviet Union is
trying to end within six months.
Adenauer told a West Berlin
election rally that the Russians
will not be allowed to back out
of a 1919 Paris accord signed af
ter the allied airlift broke the Ber
lin blockade.
He said the accord guaranteed
free access to West Berlin and
added: "Our allies stand upon it
and we stand upon it.
Air Traffic
Some of the heaviest air traffic
loads in the world are carried in
those corridors. Nearly one mil
lion refugees from communism
have been airlifted from West
Berlin to freedom on commercial
carriers.
Flights through the corridors
also accounted for the military
and charter airlift success in West
Bei'lin during the 1948-49 blockade
of surface transports.
East Germany's Red boss Wal
ter Ulbricht and his aides last
week said the Allies will have to
deal with East Germany on all
Berlin transport questions.
In Bonn, the Western Allies
were reported pursuing a go-slow
course in dealing with the Berlin
crisis.
