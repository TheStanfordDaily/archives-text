# SATURDAY SHOT EXPECTED
## Scanning Device Lacking In Army's Juno II Rocket 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)- The Army has moved lo stage center on
the lunar shooting gallery at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and may fire its
first space probe this week, possibly Saturday.
The rocket, Juno 11, was seen being readied for its trip. The huge
rocket sat in the open for a brief period earlier this week after the

service tower was rolled back.
The Air Force, with its three
unsuccessful lunar probes, had
hoped to orbit the moon and span
its far side, sending back data to
be converted to crude photo
graphs. It therefore had only
three days out of the month when
the conditions for such a shot
were favorable. The Air Force's
most successful attempt went
about a third of the distance to
the moon.
The Army, hoping to shoot on
by the moon with a simple pay
load containing no scanning de
vice. has a more leisurely sched
ule. It can take most of next week
for its try, if need be.
Modified .Jupiter
The Army team, headed by Dr.
Wernher von Braum and Ma.j.
Gon: John B. Medaris, will try
something new in launching ve
hicles. Theirs is a considerably
modified Jupiter intermediate
range ballistic missile topped by
three high speed upper stages of
solid propellant rockets.
This combination is consider
ably more potent than the Jupiter-
C rocket, a combination of a

Redstone missile with a rocket
cluster of three upper stages with
which the Army launched the Ex
plorer 1 earth satellites.
No Reverse Rockets
Juno 11. having no scanning dp
vice and no reverse rockets to
send it into a lunar orbit, is light
er as well as simpler' than the
Air 1 Force Pioneer probes. Its in
struments weigh only about Ir>
pounds, compared with 23 pounds
aboard Pioneer I.
The Juno II payload reportedly
will include a tiny photoelectric
cell device for experiments look
ing toward development of a scan
ning . instrument for satellites.
Primarily it will contain equip
ment to measure both solar and
cosmic radiation, plus powerful
radio telemetry to relay the meas
urements back to earthâ€”even
from beyond the moon.
