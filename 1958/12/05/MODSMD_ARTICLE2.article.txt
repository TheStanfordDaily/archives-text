WASHINGTON (/P) —'The Unit
ed States has evidence that the
revolutionary government of Iraq
intends to pull that country out
of the anti - Communist Baghdad
Pact.
State Department authorities
are deeply concerned over the pos
sibility that Iraq, formerly a key
stone of anti-Communist, defenses
in the Middle East, may be made
into a virtual Moscow satellite.
The latest piece of information
to be fitted into the puzzle of
Iraq's future came in a broadcast
in the Baghdad radio's home serv
ice Tuesday. The broadca-st, as
heard by U.S. monitors, dealt with
a news conference held in Cairo
by Iraq ambassador Faik Samari.

the agreement was intended to re
place the Baghdad Pact, "since
this pact has actually collapsed."
Soviet propagandists also have
been bitter in their criticism of
the U.S. Iranian agreement.
