Christmas used to l>e white, at least in dreams. For a while it
was blue. According to the "musicians" of late, Christmas has
turned to preen, vvitli jingle hells turning into cash register hells.
The "musician" who is seeing the new color is Stan Freberg,
and his work is a strong satire on the commercial aspects of the
holiday season. Freberg's record has raised a controversy, and
one of the most interesting points of the controversy is ihai al!
sides—the buying public, the merchants, the advertisers have
become defensive and are trying to place llie blame for a "com
mercialized" Christmas on one another, with the churches gelling
a share of the blame.
Where any blame should be placed is, perhaps, a matter for
the 'ologists to discover, but Freberg's record does make people
think about Christmas—probably more than many have done in
some time—if only to defend their own positions. Why is it cele
brated? Just to hear cash reginlers jingle? Kven today we iliiuk
not. We hope not.
And, hoping thai Christmas to our readers is not just a time
when there are no classes and no exams, the Daily staff a hi I
prematurely, perhaps, with two weeks still in the quarter wishes
you a Merry Christinas, and also a Happy IN'ew Year.
