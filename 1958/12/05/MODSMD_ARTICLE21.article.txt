Private Business
Editor, The Daily ,and three thor
oughly anonymous members of
the Political Science 150 class:
The title given yesterday's let
ter on Prof. Kendall, "Some
thing's Lacking," is much more
fitting than you were probably
capable of grasping. There cer
tainly is something lacking—the
realization on your part that a
teacher's private life is his own
business and should be respected
as such.
I would like to know on exactly
what grounds you feel justified
in putting Into print a teacher's
unhappy personal experience. Are
students from their lofty eleva
tion of superior morality, knowl
edge, and understanding, now to
begin censuring the teachers in
print whenever the students feel
moved by haphazard, selfish, and
petty feelings? Is any letter, no
matter how distorted, ignorant,
hypocritical, and untrue, no mat
ter how damaging to a reputation,
no matter how hard to disprove
because of its deviousness, to be
published simply because it was
written by a student ? Does a
person's right to express himself
mean that he has no correspond
ing responsibility to at least try
to tell the truth and to respect
others? Even if a student does
take freedom to moan irresponsi
bility, is the "Daily" then obli
gated to follow his unthinking
example and throw out the right
of editorial judgment because it
inhibits this freedom? How mean
ingful does freedom then become
when it implies that anyone can
blithely say in print anything, no
matter how false and irresponsi
ble?
The devious point of yester
day's letter seems to be to imply
that Prof. Kendall has been ab
sent from class because of his
arrest for drunken driving. This
is simply not true, although the
writers find it much more fascin
ating to imagine it is. Prof. Ken
dall has never been absent for
reasons other than sickness and
being out-of-town. He has amply
made up for these absences by
mimeographing t h e lectures
missed. Moreover purely on his
own volition, he conducts a week
ly seminar for any in the class
who are interested. His course
is excellent: it is a pity if has to
be defended.
I would like to ask the three
self-crowned writers of yester
day's epistle if they have ever
heard of an archaic concept called
integrity. Unfortunately, 1 can
not talk to them directly since
they seem worried about being
identified. (The "Daily" editor
told me that they told her this
was because they were afraid
Prof. Kendall would lower their
precious grades if he found out
who they were.) However, I
doubt that Prof. Kendall is much
interested in who they are. Their
not identifying themselves seems
much more important to them
than to anyone else: they would
be very hard to remember or
take any respectful notice of
even if they did give their names,
for they have no thoughts of
their own. They are not able to
come out with direct accusation

or proof; they can only weasel
slyly about letting erroneous in
sinuations slide out. They raise
their white hands in pious horror
at the idea of A Teacher Drink
ing; perhaps what really fascin
ates them is A Teacher Being
Caught Drinking.
Although they call Prof. Ken
dall's lectures "worthwhile," that
is, worthy of their 1 time and mon
ey, if they had really begun to
understand what he has been val
iantly trying to teach them, they
wouldn't have even thought of
writing the letter: for Prof. Ken
dall has insisted that knowledge
begins only when one realizes
that one must not pridefully over
assert oneself out of all relation
ship to order- and reality. Since
they are unable to comprehend
what lie's saying, they call his
lectures "unorganized," for they
cannot see the brilliance with
which he has taught the course.
All they can do is superciliously
pull a quote from Plato's "Laws"
out of context in order to mis
apply it and then end the letter
with the unctuous hope that they
will be able to find "profit" in the
course. With the low-level single
mindedness these students show
themselves to be capable of, I'm
sure they will be able to produce
lots of profit for themselves and
loss for those around them
wherever they go.

Congratulations to Dr. Stone
for so accurately and lucidly hit
ting the nail on the head!
He remarks that many students
would not like his plan because
"I'd have to wor k too hard." How
true but also how sad. We are
taking tedious memory courses
which "achieve quick results un
der pressure" because when we
arrive at Stanford most of us are
unprepared to take anything else.
We could not retain information
until the end of the year for a
comprehensive nor could we
even abandon mid terms. We are
forced onto an "organizational
merry-go-round" not by Stanford
but by the fact that nothing else
will work for- us. In short we
have never been prepared in
grammar school and in high
school for anything but "tread
mill." .Stanford can not be ex
pected to undo the wrong of
years of training in four
years; much less in time for- a
student to begin to take the in
tellectual responsibility required
of a house system. Stanford is
forced to put us onto a "merry
go-round," and this is sad.
Every step which can be laken
in the direction of a house sys
tem would be a benefit to all but
it will never fully work at Stan
ford until students are prepared
to think and act as intellectual
individuals instead of garbage
disposals. And this will not come
about until that wonderful day
in the future when we take our
national education out of the
mediocre and put it into the
meaningful.

I would like to ask the three

not talk to them directly since

told me that they told her this

Prof. Kendall would lower their
precious grades if he found out
who they were.) However, I
doubt that Prof. Kendall is much
interested in who they are. Their
not identifying themselves seems
much more important to them
than to anyone else: they would
be very hard to remember or
take any respectful notice of
even if they did give their names,
for they have no thoughts of
their own. They are not able to
come out with direct accusation

or proof; they can only weasel
slyly about letting erroneous in
sinuations slide out. They raise
their white hands in pious horror
at the idea of A Teacher Drink
ing; perhaps what really fascin
ates them is A Teacher Being
Caught Drinking.
Although they call Prof. Ken
dall's lectures "worthwhile," that
is, worthy of their 1 time and mon
ey, if they had really begun to
understand what he has been val
iantly trying to teach them, they
wouldn't have even thought of
writing the letter: for Prof. Ken
dall has insisted that knowledge
begins only when one realizes
that one must not pridefully over
assert oneself out of all relation
ship to order- and reality. Since
they are unable to comprehend
what lie's saying, they call his
lectures "unorganized," for they
cannot see the brilliance with
which he has taught the course.
All they can do is superciliously
pull a quote from Plato's "Laws"
out of context in order to mis
apply it and then end the letter
with the unctuous hope that they
will be able to find "profit" in the
course. With the low-level single
mindedness these students show
themselves to be capable of, I'm
sure they will be able to produce
lots of profit for themselves and
loss for those around them
wherever they go.

The title given yesterday's let

fitting than you were probably
capable of grasping. There cer
tainly is something lacking—the
realization on your part that a
teacher's private life is his own
business and should be respected
as such.
I would like to know on exactly
what grounds you feel justified
in putting Into print a teacher's
unhappy personal experience. Are
students from their lofty eleva
tion of superior morality, knowl
edge, and understanding, now to
begin censuring the teachers in
print whenever the students feel
moved by haphazard, selfish, and
petty feelings? Is any letter, no
matter how distorted, ignorant,
hypocritical, and untrue, no mat
ter how damaging to a reputation,
no matter how hard to disprove
because of its deviousness, to be
published simply because it was
written by a student ? Does a
person's right to express himself
mean that he has no correspond
ing responsibility to at least try
to tell the truth and to respect
others? Even if a student does
take freedom to moan irresponsi
bility, is the "Daily" then obli
gated to follow his unthinking
example and throw out the right
of editorial judgment because it
inhibits this freedom? How mean

when it implies that anyone can
blithely say in print anything, no

He remarks that many students

taking tedious memory courses
which "achieve quick results un

unprepared to take anything else.
We could not retain information

years of training in four

The title given yesterday's let
ter on Prof. Kendall, "Some
thing's Lacking," is much more
fitting than you were probably
capable of grasping. There cer
tainly is something lacking—the
realization on your part that a
teacher's private life is his own
business and should be respected
as such.
I would like to know on exactly
what grounds you feel justified
in putting Into print a teacher's
unhappy personal experience. Are
students from their lofty eleva
tion of superior morality, knowl
edge, and understanding, now to
begin censuring the teachers in
print whenever the students feel
moved by haphazard, selfish, and
petty feelings? Is any letter, no
matter how distorted, ignorant,
hypocritical, and untrue, no mat
ter how damaging to a reputation,
no matter how hard to disprove
because of its deviousness, to be
published simply because it was
written by a student ? Does a
person's right to express himself
mean that he has no correspond
ing responsibility to at least try
to tell the truth and to respect
others? Even if a student does
take freedom to moan irresponsi
bility, is the "Daily" then obli
gated to follow his unthinking
example and throw out the right
of editorial judgment because it
inhibits this freedom? How mean
ingful does freedom then become
when it implies that anyone can
blithely say in print anything, no
matter how false and irresponsi
ble?
The devious point of yester
day's letter seems to be to imply
that Prof. Kendall has been ab
sent from class because of his
arrest for drunken driving. This
is simply not true, although the
writers find it much more fascin
ating to imagine it is. Prof. Ken
dall has never been absent for
reasons other than sickness and
being out-of-town. He has amply
made up for these absences by
mimeographing t h e lectures
missed. Moreover purely on his
own volition, he conducts a week
ly seminar for any in the class
who are interested. His course
is excellent: it is a pity if has to
be defended.
I would like to ask the three
self-crowned writers of yester
day's epistle if they have ever
heard of an archaic concept called
integrity. Unfortunately, 1 can
not talk to them directly since
they seem worried about being
identified. (The "Daily" editor
told me that they told her this
was because they were afraid
Prof. Kendall would lower their
precious grades if he found out
who they were.) However, I
doubt that Prof. Kendall is much
interested in who they are. Their
not identifying themselves seems
much more important to them
than to anyone else: they would
be very hard to remember or
take any respectful notice of
even if they did give their names,
for they have no thoughts of
their own. They are not able to
come out with direct accusation

or proof; they can only weasel
slyly about letting erroneous in
sinuations slide out. They raise
their white hands in pious horror
at the idea of A Teacher Drink
ing; perhaps what really fascin
ates them is A Teacher Being
Caught Drinking.
Although they call Prof. Ken
dall's lectures "worthwhile," that
is, worthy of their 1 time and mon
ey, if they had really begun to
understand what he has been val
iantly trying to teach them, they
wouldn't have even thought of

Private Business
Editor, The Daily ,and three thor
oughly anonymous members of
the Political Science 150 class:
The title given yesterday's let
ter on Prof. Kendall, "Some
thing's Lacking," is much more
fitting than you were probably
capable of grasping. There cer
tainly is something lacking—the
realization on your part that a
teacher's private life is his own
business and should be respected
as such.
I would like to know on exactly
what grounds you feel justified
in putting Into print a teacher's
unhappy personal experience. Are
students from their lofty eleva
tion of superior morality, knowl
edge, and understanding, now to
begin censuring the teachers in
print whenever the students feel
moved by haphazard, selfish, and
petty feelings? Is any letter, no
matter how distorted, ignorant,
hypocritical, and untrue, no mat
ter how damaging to a reputation,
no matter how hard to disprove
because of its deviousness, to be
published simply because it was
written by a student ? Does a
person's right to express himself
mean that he has no correspond
ing responsibility to at least try
to tell the truth and to respect
others? Even if a student does
take freedom to moan irresponsi
bility, is the "Daily" then obli
gated to follow his unthinking
example and throw out the right
of editorial judgment because it
inhibits this freedom? How mean
ingful does freedom then become
when it implies that anyone can
blithely say in print anything, no
matter how false and irresponsi
ble?
The devious point of yester
day's letter seems to be to imply
that Prof. Kendall has been ab
sent from class because of his
arrest for drunken driving. This
is simply not true, although the
writers find it much more fascin
ating to imagine it is. Prof. Ken
dall has never been absent for
reasons other than sickness and
being out-of-town. He has amply
made up for these absences by
mimeographing t h e lectures
missed. Moreover purely on his
own volition, he conducts a week
ly seminar for any in the class
who are interested. His course
is excellent: it is a pity if has to
be defended.
I would like to ask the three
self-crowned writers of yester
day's epistle if they have ever
heard of an archaic concept called
integrity. Unfortunately, 1 can
not talk to them directly since
they seem worried about being
identified. (The "Daily" editor
told me that they told her this
was because they were afraid
Prof. Kendall would lower their
precious grades if he found out
who they were.) However, I
doubt that Prof. Kendall is much
interested in who they are. Their
not identifying themselves seems
much more important to them
than to anyone else: they would
be very hard to remember or
take any respectful notice of
even if they did give their names,
for they have no thoughts of
their own. They are not able to
come out with direct accusation

or proof; they can only weasel
slyly about letting erroneous in
sinuations slide out. They raise
their white hands in pious horror
at the idea of A Teacher Drink
ing; perhaps what really fascin
ates them is A Teacher Being
Caught Drinking.
Although they call Prof. Ken
dall's lectures "worthwhile," that
is, worthy of their 1 time and mon
ey, if they had really begun to
understand what he has been val
iantly trying to teach them, they
wouldn't have even thought of
writing the letter: for Prof. Ken
dall has insisted that knowledge
begins only when one realizes
that one must not pridefully over
assert oneself out of all relation
ship to order- and reality. Since
they are unable to comprehend
what lie's saying, they call his
lectures "unorganized," for they
cannot see the brilliance with
which he has taught the course.
All they can do is superciliously
pull a quote from Plato's "Laws"
out of context in order to mis
apply it and then end the letter
with the unctuous hope that they
will be able to find "profit" in the
course. With the low-level single
mindedness these students show
themselves to be capable of, I'm
sure they will be able to produce
lots of profit for themselves and
loss for those around them
wherever they go.

Hits the Nail
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to Dr. Stone
for so accurately and lucidly hit
ting the nail on the head!
He remarks that many students
would not like his plan because
"I'd have to wor k too hard." How
true but also how sad. We are
taking tedious memory courses
which "achieve quick results un
der pressure" because when we
arrive at Stanford most of us are
unprepared to take anything else.
We could not retain information
until the end of the year for a
comprehensive nor could we
even abandon mid terms. We are
forced onto an "organizational
merry-go-round" not by Stanford
but by the fact that nothing else
will work for- us. In short we
have never been prepared in
grammar school and in high
school for anything but "tread
mill." .Stanford can not be ex
pected to undo the wrong of
years of training in four
years; much less in time for- a
student to begin to take the in
tellectual responsibility required
of a house system. Stanford is
forced to put us onto a "merry
go-round," and this is sad.
Every step which can be laken
in the direction of a house sys
tem would be a benefit to all but
it will never fully work at Stan
ford until students are prepared
to think and act as intellectual
individuals instead of garbage
disposals. And this will not come
about until that wonderful day
in the future when we take our
national education out of the
mediocre and put it into the
meaningful.
