Super-lnieiiech'?
Editor, The Daily:
Again we seem to have with
us some anonymous letter writers
who seem to find great satisfac
tion in criticizing others. 1 am, of
course, referring to the facetious
letter in yesterday's Daily. Ap
parently these three "super-intel
lects" would wish for some sort
of god as their professor. Any
thing less would then apparently
be on a level beneath their own.
If these "super-intellects" are on
the divine level, as they seem to
regard themselves, perhaps they
should consequently remember
another saying: "To err is human;
to forgive, divine."
I'm glad to see that these divine
beings have decided that Prof.
Kendall's lectures are "unorgan
ized but worthwhile." Since ap
parently these divine beings can
not follow the organization of
the lectures (and consequently
not understand them) they reason
lhat it is Ihe responsibility of the
lecturer to "shape up" according
to their divine and infinite wis
dom. It never enters their head
to "shape-up" and try to under
stand a little of what is going on
in the course outside their nar
row lit tU' shell of pseudointellec
tualisrn.

Hunting License'
Editor, The Daily
Ii is time that attention is drawn
to the abominable parking condi
tions on the campus. The state
ment that "one may have to walk
a little ways" that appeared in a
recent issue is probably the under
statement of the year. It is like
saying that Stanford played a
pretty good game against. Cal. If
you are fortunate enough not to
have a firs t-period class, you
might as well park in Palo Alto
and take the bus to school.
Another thing: the $3 campus
parking registration is a misno
mer. Perhaps it should be called
"The Hunting License." Farsight
ed readers are given free rein to
develop rules of their own on this
theme. Points might be assigned
on the basis of time and distance
from designation, and awards
made by class.
Being a mentally handicapped
graduate student, I am afraid that
any suggestions (one must criti
cize constructively) which I might
make about so involved a subject
would only be scoffed at, as they
are when presented at the Police
Department iti person.

No Defense Needed
Editor, The Daily:
One Dec. 4 the Daily carried a
letter concerning Prof. Willmoore
Kendall signed by an anonymous
three members of the Political
Science 150 class. 1 found it a
curious and interesting letter, not
because of the information it con
tained concerning Prof. Kendall
(indeed, it gave none that was not
either common knowledge, erron
eous or alleged), but because of
the insight it gave into the char
acter of the three writers, and
further of the editor who allowed
such an obviously scurrilous let
ter to be printed unsigned.
A defense of Prof, Kendall on
academic grounds need hardly be
presented: he has fulfilled com
pletely his lecture obligations, in-

I slnuatlons to the contrary, not
withstanding, and beyond this
has devoted voluntarily an extra
hour a week to a seminar open
to any of his students who care
to come.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn is riot that the writers
were concerned for the welfare of
the "100 students," but that they
had some personal quarrel of
their own (the petty animus of
the letter is obvious) which they
chose to settle in a thoroughly
unethical manner. This is dis
tressing enough, but that the edi
tor should see fit to further.this
is a sad commentary on the stand
ards of journalism current on the
campus.
The manner is not the only
thing that is unethical about the
letter. It occurs to me that the
professor's private life, with
which they seem to have a suspect
fascination, is none of the writers'
business. Further, since when
did it become fashionable on the
Stanford campus to pillory the
faculty for the consumption of
alcoholic beverages? With a spit
slick quotation from Plato they
lead an attack which probably
only the president of the WCTU
could applaud, not, certainly, the
faculty and students of Stanford
University without an unholy
amount of hypocrisy.
In a sanctimonious finale the
anonymous trio state the hope
that Yale's loss will not become
ours. I can only reply that should
Prof. Kendall die tomorrow, the
gain of insight into political lit
erature and affairs which he
would leave to his thinking stu
dents here, and presumably at
Yale, could not be erased. It is
rare to have the opportunity to
study under such a fine teacher.
An attempt to discredit him on
the part of his students, under
any circumstances, would be un
grateful; to attempt to do so in
such petty, crude terms, on en
tirely untenable grounds, can
only be construed as visciousness
of the worst sort.

Your recent editorial for better
campus roads was most appro
priate and timely. The Universi
ty's response to this long-standing
problem has been, like the pro
verbial ostrich, to stick its head
in the macadam and hope it will
go away.
In fact, the traffic congestion
on campus has been steadily wor
sened by the policy of closing
more and more entrance and exit

roads, so that the increasing stu
dent traffic is funneled over fewer
and fewer roads, none of which
has been improved to meet the
increased need.
I would like to add to your cri
tique a plea for action to improve
what is not only the worst road
on campus but very likely on the
whole Peninsula. This is Kscon
dido Road between Wilbur Hall
and College Terrace. This is par
ticularly important since it is one
of only four remaining arteries
for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The present construction work
adjacent to College Terrace pro
vides no excuse fur the miserable
existing conditions, for they have
persisted for years, w i t h no
change other than an occasional
load of gravel to build up the
bumps a little higher.
Suffering students and towns
people are wondering how long it
will lake the University to realize
that the gas-buggy is here to stay,
and modernize their roads accord
ingly.

Poor Taste
Editor, The Daily:
In the last three years I have
developed the habit of reading
the Daily. Although students com
plain and criticize the Daily, it
has, I believe, served the student
body well. This quarter it has
been criticized as usual. For in
stance, the rather protracted cam
paign against lack of student sup
port for the football team; the
wonderful series of letters from
alumni lamenting the loss of the
"old Stanford spirit" (I would
be willing to bet that at least
one of those letter writers was
among the 20 or 30 alumni who
passed by my aisle seat as they
left Big Game five minutes be
fore the end of the game), and
some of the journalistically spec
tacular- headlines, such as: "Pope
Pius Barely Alive." These errors
could have been excused as the
result of an early inexperience
that any staff would not be able
to overcome. That isâ€”until this
morning when you committed the
error of printing that letter con
cerning Dr. Kendall.
I am appalled that you could
evidence such gross poor taste
and immaturity as to print such
a slander. 1 personally am not

particularly fond of Dr. Kendall's
point of view, but I do respect
him for the mind that he has and
also as a person.
You have an obligation to print
any responsibly written letter no
matter what its criticism. If the
writers of today's letter were re
sponsible they tin the first place)
would have signed their names.
(Why du you publish unsigned
letters?) Secondly, if they had
really been interested in finding
out something about Or. Kendall
they could have consulted any
Biographical Dictionary ....
The action of the "three mem
bers of Political Science l. r >0" is
excusable in that students are al
ways talking about professors
they like or dislike and why. To
put such a discussion on paper is
poor taste, but this issue pales
into insignificance in the face of
your having been indiscreet
enough to print such a letter.
Your actions are supposed, I
regret, to represent the opinion
of the Associated Students. The
studenls of this university are
not boorish enough to so crudely
insult a guest of the University.
Even if it were not opposed to
the most elementary dictates of
common courtesy and respect, we
would realize that such an action
would he a poor reflection on the
university and the student body.
I think that I represent a ma
jority of the student body when
1 offer my apology to Dr. Kendall
for such an offense.

What's Being Done?
Editor, The Daily:
We were most pleased by Prof.
Stone's Sequoia article; particul
arly, we were impressed by his
five specific proposals for a new
educational system at Slanl'ord.
It is true that such ideas have
been, to an extent, embodied in
the various "honors" programs;
however, these serve only a few
highly selected students and con
sequently are little in accord with
the spirit of Dr. Ston's suggest
ions.
It seems clear that this is the
most important issue the Univers
ity can face. Now Dr. Stone's
plan has the unique character
istic that it may be implemented
with the university's present
physical a n d professorial re-

sources, and thus need not bp de
layed for lack of funds.
We believe thai the administra
tion and faculty agree in princi
ple with these suggestions, but
we are not sure that very sub
statuial measures are being taken
to implement them. Thus we ask
the following of those on the
faculty and administration who
would care to answer in open let
ters:
l)o you agree in substance
Willi Dr. Stone's plan for the
University? It not, why not,
and what do you suggest? If
so, what steps are you at pres
ent taking to effeel it on a lull
scale? How soon do you think
it will Im* in operation?

Ii is time that attention is drawn

No Defense Needed
Editor, The Daily:
One Dec. 4 the Daily carried a
letter concerning Prof. Willmoore
Kendall signed by an anonymous
three members of the Political
Science 150 class. 1 found it a
curious and interesting letter, not
because of the information it con
tained concerning Prof. Kendall
(indeed, it gave none that was not
either common knowledge, erron
eous or alleged), but because of
the insight it gave into the char
acter of the three writers, and
further of the editor who allowed
such an obviously scurrilous let
ter to be printed unsigned.
A defense of Prof, Kendall on
academic grounds need hardly be
presented: he has fulfilled com
pletely his lecture obligations, in-

I slnuatlons to the contrary, not
withstanding, and beyond this
has devoted voluntarily an extra
hour a week to a seminar open
to any of his students who care
to come.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn is riot that the writers
were concerned for the welfare of
the "100 students," but that they
had some personal quarrel of
their own (the petty animus of
the letter is obvious) which they
chose to settle in a thoroughly
unethical manner. This is dis
tressing enough, but that the edi
tor should see fit to further.this
is a sad commentary on the stand
ards of journalism current on the
campus.
The manner is not the only
thing that is unethical about the
letter. It occurs to me that the
professor's private life, with
which they seem to have a suspect
fascination, is none of the writers'
business. Further, since when
did it become fashionable on the
Stanford campus to pillory the
faculty for the consumption of
alcoholic beverages? With a spit
slick quotation from Plato they
lead an attack which probably
only the president of the WCTU
could applaud, not, certainly, the
faculty and students of Stanford
University without an unholy
amount of hypocrisy.
In a sanctimonious finale the
anonymous trio state the hope
that Yale's loss will not become
ours. I can only reply that should
Prof. Kendall die tomorrow, the
gain of insight into political lit
erature and affairs which he
would leave to his thinking stu
dents here, and presumably at
Yale, could not be erased. It is
rare to have the opportunity to
study under such a fine teacher.
An attempt to discredit him on
the part of his students, under
any circumstances, would be un
grateful; to attempt to do so in
such petty, crude terms, on en
tirely untenable grounds, can
only be construed as visciousness
of the worst sort.

Your recent editorial for better
campus roads was most appro
priate and timely. The Universi
ty's response to this long-standing
problem has been, like the pro
verbial ostrich, to stick its head
in the macadam and hope it will
go away.
In fact, the traffic congestion
on campus has been steadily wor
sened by the policy of closing
more and more entrance and exit

roads, so that the increasing stu
dent traffic is funneled over fewer
and fewer roads, none of which
has been improved to meet the
increased need.
I would like to add to your cri
tique a plea for action to improve
what is not only the worst road
on campus but very likely on the
whole Peninsula. This is Kscon
dido Road between Wilbur Hall
and College Terrace. This is par
ticularly important since it is one
of only four remaining arteries
for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The present construction work
adjacent to College Terrace pro
vides no excuse fur the miserable
existing conditions, for they have
persisted for years, w i t h no
change other than an occasional
load of gravel to build up the
bumps a little higher.
Suffering students and towns
people are wondering how long it
will lake the University to realize
that the gas-buggy is here to stay,
and modernize their roads accord
ingly.

Poor Taste
Editor, The Daily:
In the last three years I have
developed the habit of reading
the Daily. Although students com
plain and criticize the Daily, it
has, I believe, served the student
body well. This quarter it has
been criticized as usual. For in
stance, the rather protracted cam
paign against lack of student sup
port for the football team; the
wonderful series of letters from
alumni lamenting the loss of the
"old Stanford spirit" (I would
be willing to bet that at least
one of those letter writers was
among the 20 or 30 alumni who
passed by my aisle seat as they
left Big Game five minutes be
fore the end of the game), and
some of the journalistically spec
tacular- headlines, such as: "Pope
Pius Barely Alive." These errors
could have been excused as the
result of an early inexperience
that any staff would not be able
to overcome. That isâ€”until this
morning when you committed the
error of printing that letter con
cerning Dr. Kendall.
I am appalled that you could
evidence such gross poor taste
and immaturity as to print such
a slander. 1 personally am not

particularly fond of Dr. Kendall's
point of view, but I do respect
him for the mind that he has and
also as a person.
You have an obligation to print
any responsibly written letter no
matter what its criticism. If the
writers of today's letter were re
sponsible they tin the first place)
would have signed their names.
(Why du you publish unsigned
letters?) Secondly, if they had
really been interested in finding
out something about Or. Kendall
they could have consulted any
Biographical Dictionary ....
The action of the "three mem
bers of Political Science l. r >0" is
excusable in that students are al
ways talking about professors
they like or dislike and why. To
put such a discussion on paper is
poor taste, but this issue pales
into insignificance in the face of
your having been indiscreet
enough to print such a letter.
Your actions are supposed, I
regret, to represent the opinion
of the Associated Students. The
studenls of this university are
not boorish enough to so crudely
insult a guest of the University.
Even if it were not opposed to
the most elementary dictates of
common courtesy and respect, we
would realize that such an action
would he a poor reflection on the
university and the student body.
I think that I represent a ma
jority of the student body when
1 offer my apology to Dr. Kendall
for such an offense.

What's Being Done?
Editor, The Daily:
We were most pleased by Prof.
Stone's Sequoia article; particul
arly, we were impressed by his
five specific proposals for a new
educational system at Slanl'ord.
It is true that such ideas have
been, to an extent, embodied in
the various "honors" programs;
however, these serve only a few
highly selected students and con
sequently are little in accord with
the spirit of Dr. Ston's suggest
ions.
It seems clear that this is the
most important issue the Univers
ity can face. Now Dr. Stone's
plan has the unique character
istic that it may be implemented
with the university's present
physical a n d professorial re-

sources, and thus need not bp de
layed for lack of funds.
We believe thai the administra
tion and faculty agree in princi
ple with these suggestions, but
we are not sure that very sub
statuial measures are being taken
to implement them. Thus we ask
the following of those on the
faculty and administration who
would care to answer in open let
ters:
l)o you agree in substance
Willi Dr. Stone's plan for the
University? It not, why not,
and what do you suggest? If
so, what steps are you at pres
ent taking to effeel it on a lull
scale? How soon do you think
it will Im* in operation?

the lectures (and consequently

Ii is time that attention is drawn

No Defense Needed
Editor, The Daily:
One Dec. 4 the Daily carried a
letter concerning Prof. Willmoore
Kendall signed by an anonymous
three members of the Political
Science 150 class. 1 found it a
curious and interesting letter, not
because of the information it con
tained concerning Prof. Kendall
(indeed, it gave none that was not
either common knowledge, erron
eous or alleged), but because of
the insight it gave into the char
acter of the three writers, and
further of the editor who allowed
such an obviously scurrilous let
ter to be printed unsigned.
A defense of Prof, Kendall on
academic grounds need hardly be
presented: he has fulfilled com
pletely his lecture obligations, in-

I slnuatlons to the contrary, not
withstanding, and beyond this
has devoted voluntarily an extra
hour a week to a seminar open
to any of his students who care
to come.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn is riot that the writers
were concerned for the welfare of
the "100 students," but that they
had some personal quarrel of
their own (the petty animus of
the letter is obvious) which they
chose to settle in a thoroughly
unethical manner. This is dis
tressing enough, but that the edi
tor should see fit to further.this
is a sad commentary on the stand
ards of journalism current on the
campus.
The manner is not the only
thing that is unethical about the
letter. It occurs to me that the
professor's private life, with
which they seem to have a suspect
fascination, is none of the writers'
business. Further, since when
did it become fashionable on the
Stanford campus to pillory the
faculty for the consumption of
alcoholic beverages? With a spit
slick quotation from Plato they
lead an attack which probably
only the president of the WCTU
could applaud, not, certainly, the
faculty and students of Stanford
University without an unholy
amount of hypocrisy.
In a sanctimonious finale the
anonymous trio state the hope
that Yale's loss will not become
ours. I can only reply that should
Prof. Kendall die tomorrow, the
gain of insight into political lit
erature and affairs which he
would leave to his thinking stu
dents here, and presumably at
Yale, could not be erased. It is
rare to have the opportunity to
study under such a fine teacher.
An attempt to discredit him on
the part of his students, under
any circumstances, would be un
grateful; to attempt to do so in
such petty, crude terms, on en
tirely untenable grounds, can
only be construed as visciousness
of the worst sort.

Your recent editorial for better
campus roads was most appro
priate and timely. The Universi
ty's response to this long-standing
problem has been, like the pro
verbial ostrich, to stick its head
in the macadam and hope it will
go away.
In fact, the traffic congestion
on campus has been steadily wor
sened by the policy of closing
more and more entrance and exit

roads, so that the increasing stu
dent traffic is funneled over fewer
and fewer roads, none of which
has been improved to meet the
increased need.
I would like to add to your cri
tique a plea for action to improve
what is not only the worst road
on campus but very likely on the
whole Peninsula. This is Kscon
dido Road between Wilbur Hall
and College Terrace. This is par
ticularly important since it is one
of only four remaining arteries
for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The present construction work
adjacent to College Terrace pro
vides no excuse fur the miserable
existing conditions, for they have
persisted for years, w i t h no
change other than an occasional
load of gravel to build up the
bumps a little higher.
Suffering students and towns
people are wondering how long it
will lake the University to realize
that the gas-buggy is here to stay,
and modernize their roads accord

Poor Taste
Editor, The Daily:
In the last three years I have
developed the habit of reading
the Daily. Although students com
plain and criticize the Daily, it
has, I believe, served the student
body well. This quarter it has
been criticized as usual. For in
stance, the rather protracted cam
paign against lack of student sup
port for the football team; the
wonderful series of letters from
alumni lamenting the loss of the
"old Stanford spirit" (I would
be willing to bet that at least
one of those letter writers was
among the 20 or 30 alumni who
passed by my aisle seat as they
left Big Game five minutes be
fore the end of the game), and
some of the journalistically spec
tacular- headlines, such as: "Pope
Pius Barely Alive." These errors
could have been excused as the
result of an early inexperience
that any staff would not be able
to overcome. That isâ€”until this
morning when you committed the
error of printing that letter con
cerning Dr. Kendall.
I am appalled that you could
evidence such gross poor taste
and immaturity as to print such
a slander. 1 personally am not

particularly fond of Dr. Kendall's
point of view, but I do respect
him for the mind that he has and
also as a person.
You have an obligation to print
any responsibly written letter no
matter what its criticism. If the
writers of today's letter were re
sponsible they tin the first place)
would have signed their names.
(Why du you publish unsigned
letters?) Secondly, if they had
really been interested in finding
out something about Or. Kendall
they could have consulted any
Biographical Dictionary ....
The action of the "three mem
bers of Political Science l. r >0" is
excusable in that students are al
ways talking about professors
they like or dislike and why. To
put such a discussion on paper is
poor taste, but this issue pales
into insignificance in the face of
your having been indiscreet
enough to print such a letter.
Your actions are supposed, I
regret, to represent the opinion
of the Associated Students. The
studenls of this university are
not boorish enough to so crudely
insult a guest of the University.
Even if it were not opposed to
the most elementary dictates of
common courtesy and respect, we
would realize that such an action
would he a poor reflection on the
university and the student body.
I think that I represent a ma
jority of the student body when
1 offer my apology to Dr. Kendall
for such an offense.

What's Being Done?
Editor, The Daily:
We were most pleased by Prof.
Stone's Sequoia article; particul
arly, we were impressed by his
five specific proposals for a new
educational system at Slanl'ord.
It is true that such ideas have
been, to an extent, embodied in
the various "honors" programs;
however, these serve only a few
highly selected students and con
sequently are little in accord with
the spirit of Dr. Ston's suggest
ions.
It seems clear that this is the
most important issue the Univers
ity can face. Now Dr. Stone's
plan has the unique character
istic that it may be implemented
with the university's present
physical a n d professorial re-

sources, and thus need not bp de
layed for lack of funds.
We believe thai the administra
tion and faculty agree in princi
ple with these suggestions, but
we are not sure that very sub
statuial measures are being taken
to implement them. Thus we ask
the following of those on the
faculty and administration who
would care to answer in open let
ters:
l)o you agree in substance
Willi Dr. Stone's plan for the
University? It not, why not,
and what do you suggest? If
so, what steps are you at pres
ent taking to effeel it on a lull
scale? How soon do you think
it will Im* in operation?

beings have decided that Prof.
Kendall's lectures are "unorgan

parently these divine beings can
not follow the organization of
the lectures (and consequently
not understand them) they reason
lhat it is Ihe responsibility of the
lecturer to "shape up" according
to their divine and infinite wis

Ii is time that attention is drawn

you are fortunate enough not to

might as well park in Palo Alto

Another thing: the $3 campus

No Defense Needed
Editor, The Daily:
One Dec. 4 the Daily carried a
letter concerning Prof. Willmoore
Kendall signed by an anonymous
three members of the Political
Science 150 class. 1 found it a
curious and interesting letter, not
because of the information it con
tained concerning Prof. Kendall
(indeed, it gave none that was not
either common knowledge, erron
eous or alleged), but because of
the insight it gave into the char
acter of the three writers, and
further of the editor who allowed
such an obviously scurrilous let
ter to be printed unsigned.
A defense of Prof, Kendall on
academic grounds need hardly be
presented: he has fulfilled com
pletely his lecture obligations, in-

I slnuatlons to the contrary, not
withstanding, and beyond this
has devoted voluntarily an extra
hour a week to a seminar open
to any of his students who care
to come.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn is riot that the writers
were concerned for the welfare of
the "100 students," but that they
had some personal quarrel of
their own (the petty animus of
the letter is obvious) which they
chose to settle in a thoroughly
unethical manner. This is dis
tressing enough, but that the edi
tor should see fit to further.this
is a sad commentary on the stand
ards of journalism current on the
campus.
The manner is not the only
thing that is unethical about the
letter. It occurs to me that the
professor's private life, with
which they seem to have a suspect
fascination, is none of the writers'
business. Further, since when
did it become fashionable on the
Stanford campus to pillory the
faculty for the consumption of
alcoholic beverages? With a spit
slick quotation from Plato they
lead an attack which probably
only the president of the WCTU
could applaud, not, certainly, the
faculty and students of Stanford
University without an unholy
amount of hypocrisy.
In a sanctimonious finale the
anonymous trio state the hope
that Yale's loss will not become
ours. I can only reply that should
Prof. Kendall die tomorrow, the
gain of insight into political lit
erature and affairs which he
would leave to his thinking stu
dents here, and presumably at
Yale, could not be erased. It is
rare to have the opportunity to
study under such a fine teacher.
An attempt to discredit him on
the part of his students, under
any circumstances, would be un
grateful; to attempt to do so in
such petty, crude terms, on en
tirely untenable grounds, can
only be construed as visciousness
of the worst sort.

Your recent editorial for better
campus roads was most appro
priate and timely. The Universi
ty's response to this long-standing
problem has been, like the pro
verbial ostrich, to stick its head
in the macadam and hope it will
go away.
In fact, the traffic congestion
on campus has been steadily wor
sened by the policy of closing
more and more entrance and exit

roads, so that the increasing stu
dent traffic is funneled over fewer
and fewer roads, none of which
has been improved to meet the
increased need.
I would like to add to your cri
tique a plea for action to improve
what is not only the worst road
on campus but very likely on the
whole Peninsula. This is Kscon
dido Road between Wilbur Hall
and College Terrace. This is par
ticularly important since it is one
of only four remaining arteries
for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The present construction work
adjacent to College Terrace pro
vides no excuse fur the miserable
existing conditions, for they have
persisted for years, w i t h no
change other than an occasional
load of gravel to build up the
bumps a little higher.
Suffering students and towns
people are wondering how long it
will lake the University to realize
that the gas-buggy is here to stay,
and modernize their roads accord
ingly.

Poor Taste
Editor, The Daily:
In the last three years I have
developed the habit of reading
the Daily. Although students com
plain and criticize the Daily, it
has, I believe, served the student
body well. This quarter it has
been criticized as usual. For in
stance, the rather protracted cam
paign against lack of student sup
port for the football team; the
wonderful series of letters from
alumni lamenting the loss of the
"old Stanford spirit" (I would
be willing to bet that at least
one of those letter writers was
among the 20 or 30 alumni who
passed by my aisle seat as they
left Big Game five minutes be
fore the end of the game), and
some of the journalistically spec
tacular- headlines, such as: "Pope
Pius Barely Alive." These errors
could have been excused as the
result of an early inexperience
that any staff would not be able
to overcome. That isâ€”until this
morning when you committed the
error of printing that letter con
cerning Dr. Kendall.
I am appalled that you could
evidence such gross poor taste
and immaturity as to print such
a slander. 1 personally am not

particularly fond of Dr. Kendall's
point of view, but I do respect
him for the mind that he has and
also as a person.
You have an obligation to print
any responsibly written letter no
matter what its criticism. If the
writers of today's letter were re
sponsible they tin the first place)
would have signed their names.
(Why du you publish unsigned
letters?) Secondly, if they had
really been interested in finding
out something about Or. Kendall
they could have consulted any
Biographical Dictionary ....
The action of the "three mem
bers of Political Science l. r >0" is
excusable in that students are al
ways talking about professors
they like or dislike and why. To
put such a discussion on paper is
poor taste, but this issue pales
into insignificance in the face of
your having been indiscreet
enough to print such a letter.
Your actions are supposed, I
regret, to represent the opinion
of the Associated Students. The
studenls of this university are
not boorish enough to so crudely
insult a guest of the University.
Even if it were not opposed to
the most elementary dictates of
common courtesy and respect, we
would realize that such an action
would he a poor reflection on the
university and the student body.
I think that I represent a ma
jority of the student body when
1 offer my apology to Dr. Kendall
for such an offense.

What's Being Done?
Editor, The Daily:
We were most pleased by Prof.
Stone's Sequoia article; particul
arly, we were impressed by his
five specific proposals for a new
educational system at Slanl'ord.
It is true that such ideas have
been, to an extent, embodied in
the various "honors" programs;
however, these serve only a few
highly selected students and con
sequently are little in accord with
the spirit of Dr. Ston's suggest
ions.
It seems clear that this is the
most important issue the Univers
ity can face. Now Dr. Stone's
plan has the unique character
istic that it may be implemented
with the university's present
physical a n d professorial re-

sources, and thus need not bp de
layed for lack of funds.
We believe thai the administra
tion and faculty agree in princi
ple with these suggestions, but
we are not sure that very sub
statuial measures are being taken
to implement them. Thus we ask
the following of those on the
faculty and administration who
would care to answer in open let
ters:
l)o you agree in substance
Willi Dr. Stone's plan for the
University? It not, why not,
and what do you suggest? If
so, what steps are you at pres
ent taking to effeel it on a lull
scale? How soon do you think
it will Im* in operation?

Ii is time that attention is drawn

you are fortunate enough not to
have a firs t-period class, you
might as well park in Palo Alto

Another thing: the $3 campus

No Defense Needed
Editor, The Daily:
One Dec. 4 the Daily carried a
letter concerning Prof. Willmoore
Kendall signed by an anonymous
three members of the Political
Science 150 class. 1 found it a
curious and interesting letter, not
because of the information it con
tained concerning Prof. Kendall
(indeed, it gave none that was not
either common knowledge, erron
eous or alleged), but because of
the insight it gave into the char
acter of the three writers, and
further of the editor who allowed
such an obviously scurrilous let
ter to be printed unsigned.
A defense of Prof, Kendall on
academic grounds need hardly be
presented: he has fulfilled com
pletely his lecture obligations, in-

I slnuatlons to the contrary, not
withstanding, and beyond this
has devoted voluntarily an extra
hour a week to a seminar open
to any of his students who care
to come.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn is riot that the writers
were concerned for the welfare of
the "100 students," but that they
had some personal quarrel of
their own (the petty animus of
the letter is obvious) which they
chose to settle in a thoroughly
unethical manner. This is dis
tressing enough, but that the edi
tor should see fit to further.this
is a sad commentary on the stand
ards of journalism current on the
campus.
The manner is not the only
thing that is unethical about the
letter. It occurs to me that the
professor's private life, with
which they seem to have a suspect
fascination, is none of the writers'
business. Further, since when
did it become fashionable on the
Stanford campus to pillory the
faculty for the consumption of
alcoholic beverages? With a spit
slick quotation from Plato they
lead an attack which probably
only the president of the WCTU
could applaud, not, certainly, the
faculty and students of Stanford
University without an unholy
amount of hypocrisy.
In a sanctimonious finale the
anonymous trio state the hope
that Yale's loss will not become
ours. I can only reply that should
Prof. Kendall die tomorrow, the
gain of insight into political lit
erature and affairs which he
would leave to his thinking stu
dents here, and presumably at
Yale, could not be erased. It is
rare to have the opportunity to
study under such a fine teacher.
An attempt to discredit him on
the part of his students, under
any circumstances, would be un
grateful; to attempt to do so in
such petty, crude terms, on en
tirely untenable grounds, can
only be construed as visciousness
of the worst sort.

Your recent editorial for better
campus roads was most appro
priate and timely. The Universi
ty's response to this long-standing
problem has been, like the pro
verbial ostrich, to stick its head
in the macadam and hope it will
go away.
In fact, the traffic congestion
on campus has been steadily wor
sened by the policy of closing
more and more entrance and exit

roads, so that the increasing stu
dent traffic is funneled over fewer
and fewer roads, none of which
has been improved to meet the
increased need.
I would like to add to your cri
tique a plea for action to improve
what is not only the worst road
on campus but very likely on the
whole Peninsula. This is Kscon
dido Road between Wilbur Hall
and College Terrace. This is par
ticularly important since it is one
of only four remaining arteries
for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The present construction work
adjacent to College Terrace pro
vides no excuse fur the miserable
existing conditions, for they have
persisted for years, w i t h no
change other than an occasional
load of gravel to build up the
bumps a little higher.
Suffering students and towns
people are wondering how long it
will lake the University to realize
that the gas-buggy is here to stay,
and modernize their roads accord

Poor Taste
Editor, The Daily:
In the last three years I have
developed the habit of reading
the Daily. Although students com
plain and criticize the Daily, it
has, I believe, served the student
body well. This quarter it has
been criticized as usual. For in
stance, the rather protracted cam
paign against lack of student sup
port for the football team; the
wonderful series of letters from
alumni lamenting the loss of the
"old Stanford spirit" (I would
be willing to bet that at least
one of those letter writers was
among the 20 or 30 alumni who
passed by my aisle seat as they
left Big Game five minutes be
fore the end of the game), and
some of the journalistically spec
tacular- headlines, such as: "Pope
Pius Barely Alive." These errors
could have been excused as the
result of an early inexperience
that any staff would not be able
to overcome. That isâ€”until this
morning when you committed the
error of printing that letter con
cerning Dr. Kendall.
I am appalled that you could
evidence such gross poor taste
and immaturity as to print such
a slander. 1 personally am not

particularly fond of Dr. Kendall's
point of view, but I do respect
him for the mind that he has and
also as a person.
You have an obligation to print
any responsibly written letter no
matter what its criticism. If the
writers of today's letter were re
sponsible they tin the first place)
would have signed their names.
(Why du you publish unsigned
letters?) Secondly, if they had
really been interested in finding
out something about Or. Kendall
they could have consulted any
Biographical Dictionary ....
The action of the "three mem
bers of Political Science l. r >0" is
excusable in that students are al
ways talking about professors
they like or dislike and why. To
put such a discussion on paper is
poor taste, but this issue pales
into insignificance in the face of
your having been indiscreet
enough to print such a letter.
Your actions are supposed, I
regret, to represent the opinion
of the Associated Students. The
studenls of this university are
not boorish enough to so crudely
insult a guest of the University.
Even if it were not opposed to
the most elementary dictates of
common courtesy and respect, we
would realize that such an action
would he a poor reflection on the
university and the student body.
I think that I represent a ma
jority of the student body when
1 offer my apology to Dr. Kendall
for such an offense.

What's Being Done?
Editor, The Daily:
We were most pleased by Prof.
Stone's Sequoia article; particul
arly, we were impressed by his
five specific proposals for a new
educational system at Slanl'ord.
It is true that such ideas have
been, to an extent, embodied in
the various "honors" programs;
however, these serve only a few
highly selected students and con
sequently are little in accord with
the spirit of Dr. Ston's suggest
ions.
It seems clear that this is the
most important issue the Univers
ity can face. Now Dr. Stone's
plan has the unique character
istic that it may be implemented
with the university's present
physical a n d professorial re-

sources, and thus need not bp de
layed for lack of funds.
We believe thai the administra
tion and faculty agree in princi
ple with these suggestions, but
we are not sure that very sub
statuial measures are being taken
to implement them. Thus we ask
the following of those on the
faculty and administration who
would care to answer in open let
ters:
l)o you agree in substance
Willi Dr. Stone's plan for the
University? It not, why not,
and what do you suggest? If
so, what steps are you at pres
ent taking to effeel it on a lull
scale? How soon do you think
it will Im* in operation?

Ii is time that attention is drawn
to the abominable parking condi
tions on the campus. The state
ment that "one may have to walk
a little ways" that appeared in a
recent issue is probably the under
statement of the year. It is like
saying that Stanford played a
pretty good game against. Cal. If
you are fortunate enough not to
have a firs t-period class, you
might as well park in Palo Alto
and take the bus to school.
Another thing: the $3 campus
parking registration is a misno
mer. Perhaps it should be called
"The Hunting License." Farsight
ed readers are given free rein to
develop rules of their own on this
theme. Points might be assigned
on the basis of time and distance
from designation, and awards
made by class.
Being a mentally handicapped
graduate student, I am afraid that
any suggestions (one must criti
cize constructively) which I might
make about so involved a subject
would only be scoffed at, as they
are when presented at the Police
Department iti person.

No Defense Needed
Editor, The Daily:
One Dec. 4 the Daily carried a
letter concerning Prof. Willmoore
Kendall signed by an anonymous
three members of the Political
Science 150 class. 1 found it a
curious and interesting letter, not
because of the information it con
tained concerning Prof. Kendall
(indeed, it gave none that was not
either common knowledge, erron
eous or alleged), but because of
the insight it gave into the char
acter of the three writers, and
further of the editor who allowed
such an obviously scurrilous let
ter to be printed unsigned.
A defense of Prof, Kendall on
academic grounds need hardly be
presented: he has fulfilled com
pletely his lecture obligations, in-

I slnuatlons to the contrary, not
withstanding, and beyond this
has devoted voluntarily an extra
hour a week to a seminar open
to any of his students who care
to come.
The only conclusion that can
be drawn is riot that the writers
were concerned for the welfare of
the "100 students," but that they
had some personal quarrel of
their own (the petty animus of
the letter is obvious) which they
chose to settle in a thoroughly
unethical manner. This is dis
tressing enough, but that the edi
tor should see fit to further.this
is a sad commentary on the stand
ards of journalism current on the
campus.
The manner is not the only
thing that is unethical about the
letter. It occurs to me that the
professor's private life, with
which they seem to have a suspect
fascination, is none of the writers'
business. Further, since when
did it become fashionable on the
Stanford campus to pillory the
faculty for the consumption of
alcoholic beverages? With a spit
slick quotation from Plato they
lead an attack which probably
only the president of the WCTU
could applaud, not, certainly, the
faculty and students of Stanford
University without an unholy
amount of hypocrisy.
In a sanctimonious finale the
anonymous trio state the hope
that Yale's loss will not become
ours. I can only reply that should
Prof. Kendall die tomorrow, the
gain of insight into political lit
erature and affairs which he
would leave to his thinking stu
dents here, and presumably at
Yale, could not be erased. It is
rare to have the opportunity to
study under such a fine teacher.
An attempt to discredit him on
the part of his students, under
any circumstances, would be un
grateful; to attempt to do so in
such petty, crude terms, on en
tirely untenable grounds, can
only be construed as visciousness
of the worst sort.

Your recent editorial for better
campus roads was most appro
priate and timely. The Universi
ty's response to this long-standing
problem has been, like the pro
verbial ostrich, to stick its head
in the macadam and hope it will
go away.
In fact, the traffic congestion
on campus has been steadily wor
sened by the policy of closing
more and more entrance and exit

roads, so that the increasing stu
dent traffic is funneled over fewer
and fewer roads, none of which
has been improved to meet the
increased need.
I would like to add to your cri
tique a plea for action to improve
what is not only the worst road
on campus but very likely on the
whole Peninsula. This is Kscon
dido Road between Wilbur Hall
and College Terrace. This is par
ticularly important since it is one
of only four remaining arteries
for incoming and outgoing traffic.
The present construction work
adjacent to College Terrace pro
vides no excuse fur the miserable
existing conditions, for they have
persisted for years, w i t h no
change other than an occasional
load of gravel to build up the
bumps a little higher.
Suffering students and towns
people are wondering how long it
will lake the University to realize
that the gas-buggy is here to stay,
and modernize their roads accord
ingly.

Poor Taste
Editor, The Daily:
In the last three years I have
developed the habit of reading
the Daily. Although students com
plain and criticize the Daily, it
has, I believe, served the student
body well. This quarter it has
been criticized as usual. For in
stance, the rather protracted cam
paign against lack of student sup
port for the football team; the
wonderful series of letters from
alumni lamenting the loss of the
"old Stanford spirit" (I would
be willing to bet that at least
one of those letter writers was
among the 20 or 30 alumni who
passed by my aisle seat as they
left Big Game five minutes be
fore the end of the game), and
some of the journalistically spec
tacular- headlines, such as: "Pope
Pius Barely Alive." These errors
could have been excused as the
result of an early inexperience
that any staff would not be able
to overcome. That isâ€”until this
morning when you committed the
error of printing that letter con
cerning Dr. Kendall.
I am appalled that you could
evidence such gross poor taste
and immaturity as to print such
a slander. 1 personally am not

particularly fond of Dr. Kendall's
point of view, but I do respect
him for the mind that he has and
also as a person.
You have an obligation to print
any responsibly written letter no
matter what its criticism. If the
writers of today's letter were re
sponsible they tin the first place)
would have signed their names.
(Why du you publish unsigned
letters?) Secondly, if they had
really been interested in finding
out something about Or. Kendall
they could have consulted any
Biographical Dictionary ....
The action of the "three mem
bers of Political Science l. r >0" is
excusable in that students are al
ways talking about professors
they like or dislike and why. To
put such a discussion on paper is
poor taste, but this issue pales
into insignificance in the face of
your having been indiscreet
enough to print such a letter.
Your actions are supposed, I
regret, to represent the opinion
of the Associated Students. The
studenls of this university are
not boorish enough to so crudely
insult a guest of the University.
Even if it were not opposed to
the most elementary dictates of
common courtesy and respect, we
would realize that such an action
would he a poor reflection on the
university and the student body.
I think that I represent a ma
jority of the student body when
1 offer my apology to Dr. Kendall
for such an offense.

What's Being Done?
Editor, The Daily:
We were most pleased by Prof.
Stone's Sequoia article; particul
arly, we were impressed by his
five specific proposals for a new
educational system at Slanl'ord.
It is true that such ideas have
been, to an extent, embodied in
the various "honors" programs;
however, these serve only a few
highly selected students and con
sequently are little in accord with
the spirit of Dr. Ston's suggest
ions.
It seems clear that this is the
most important issue the Univers
ity can face. Now Dr. Stone's
plan has the unique character
istic that it may be implemented
with the university's present
physical a n d professorial re-

sources, and thus need not bp de
layed for lack of funds.
We believe thai the administra
tion and faculty agree in princi
ple with these suggestions, but
we are not sure that very sub
statuial measures are being taken
to implement them. Thus we ask
the following of those on the
faculty and administration who
would care to answer in open let
ters:
l)o you agree in substance
Willi Dr. Stone's plan for the
University? It not, why not,
and what do you suggest? If
so, what steps are you at pres
ent taking to effeel it on a lull
scale? How soon do you think
it will Im* in operation?

Super-lnieiiech'?
Editor, The Daily:
Again we seem to have with
us some anonymous letter writers
who seem to find great satisfac
tion in criticizing others. 1 am, of
course, referring to the facetious
letter in yesterday's Daily. Ap
parently these three "super-intel
lects" would wish for some sort
of god as their professor. Any
thing less would then apparently
be on a level beneath their own.
If these "super-intellects" are on
the divine level, as they seem to
regard themselves, perhaps they
should consequently remember
another saying: "To err is human;
to forgive, divine."
I'm glad to see that these divine
beings have decided that Prof.
Kendall's lectures are "unorgan
ized but worthwhile." Since ap
parently these divine beings can
not follow the organization of
the lectures (and consequently
not understand them) they reason
lhat it is Ihe responsibility of the
lecturer to "shape up" according
to their divine and infinite wis
dom. It never enters their head
to "shape-up" and try to under
stand a little of what is going on
in the course outside their nar
row lit tU' shell of pseudointellec
tualisrn.
