# Vandalism Repair Costs Soar as Damage Mounts

### Leo Krulitz 
Dropping a knotted sweat sock
filled with sand on the counter in
the police station, Stanford police
chief Gordon Davis explained that
it had been picked up at the Big
Game Rally. "This could knock a
guy out," he said.
Was there more vandalism this
quarter than usual? No, here

flected—"Gordie" Davis has been
here for nearly 30 years—but it
might have seemed so, with all
that painting by Cal during Big
Game Week.
One thing, though. Davis said:
if these Big Game rallies aren't
geared more to the Stanford stu
dents instead of creating a spec
tacle for the people on the Penin
sula, we may have real trouble.
Davis was referr ing to a near-riot
that developed after the Bonfire
Rally this year.
$766 of Damage
Carrol Blacker, head of Stan
ford's Corporation Yar d, which
cleaned up most of the mess Cal
made, reported that the removing
of paint was complete—-the cost,
$7(i(S. Cal gets the bill.
Sandblasting wasn't required to
clean Hoover Tower, after all
"just brushes, paint remover and
elbow grease." he said.
Blacker added: "Four Cal stu
dents helped clean up the mess.
This is the first time they did this
probably because it was about

the first time they were caught."
Asked about the cost oi repair
ing Angel of Mercy, a statue near
the Mausoleum which was recent
ly broken by vandals. Blacker ex
plained that the total cost hadn't
been estimated yet, but he com
mented that, in the past, fingers
had been broken off and replaced
at a cost of $100 apiece. This time
a whole arm is missing.
High School Students
Chief Davis, commenting on
vandalism, suggested that it was
wrong to blame a lot of these
things on Palo Alto High School
students. They come from all
over the Peninsula, he explained.
These things aren't done often
by Stanford students unless they
get hold of some "spirits" and
don't know what they're doing,
Davis explained. Entrance re
quirements eliminate this kind of
person.
William Craig, associate dean of
students, explained that a lot of
the burglaries in the fraternities
this quarter were done by "cer
tain people who bide their time
and work campuses on the week
ends."
Rowdy Act
And the rowdy acts of students
themselves? "1 think there has
been an increase in the psycho
logical problems for the students
those last few years," Craig said.
"As the pressures on students in
crease, t licso acts probably in
crease;."
Craig explained thai no action
was taken against the Stanford
students who were caught during
Big Game Week trying to get into
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley to
saw down the goal posts. They
hadn't actually done anything, he
said.
Chief Davis answered a ques
tion about panty raids and water
fights that occur occasionally:
"We don't worry about it too
much just stand by and make
sure nothing happens," ho said.
"Any year it doesn't happen, the
kids are probably sick."
