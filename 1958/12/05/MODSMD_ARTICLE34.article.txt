"Tim proper study of mankind is man," said CieofTrey ('haucer
in I lis immortal ('awn -4/ the Rat, and I couldn't agree more. In
these tangled times it is particularly proper to study man how
lie lives and works. Accordingly, thi> column, normally devoted
to slapdash waggery, will from time to time turn a serious eye
on the social sciences.
In making these occasional departures, I have the hearty ap
proval of the makers of Philip Morris ('igarettes, w hose interest
is not only in providing young Americans with fine cigarette-;,
matchlessly blended of vintage tobaccos, grown with loving
care and harvested with tender mercy, then cured with coin
passionate patience and rolled into firm tasty cylinders and
brought to you in long size or regular, in soft pack or flip-top
box, at prices which wreak no havoc on the most stringent of
budgets, but who are equally concerned with broadening the
minds and extending the intellectual vistas of every college
man and woman!
I, for one, am not unmoved by this great-heartedness, and
though 1 know it is considered chic these days to disparage one's
employers, I shall not. Indeed, 1 shall cry "lluzzah!' for the
makers of Philip Morris. 1 shall cry "lluzzah!" and "Viva!"
and'"016!" and "Uchichoonya!"
But I digress. For <>ur fir.>f lesson in social science, h i us
turn to economics, often called the queen of the social M'ienees.
(Sociology is the king of the social sciences. Advertising is the
jack.)
Economics breaks down into two broad general classifica
tions: 1) coins; 2) folding money. But before taking up these
technical aspects, let us survey briefly the history of economics.

Economics was discovered I»y flu; Imi«jli>111u;i11, Adam Smith.
He published Ids findings in but everybody giggled so
h:ird that Smith, blushing hotly, nave up the whole thing and
went into the cough drop business with his brother.
I'or long years after that economics lay neglected while the
world busied it sol f with other things, like the birth of Victor
Hugo, the last days of Pompeii, and the Bunny Ibig.
Then one day while flying :i kite during a thunderstorm, the
American, Henry (ieorge (also (tailed Thorstoin Neblen), dis
covered the law of diminishing returns, and then, boy, the. fat
was it* the fire! Before you could say "knife the Industrial
Revolution was on! Mechanization and steam power resulted
in prodigies of production. For example, before the Industrial
Revolution, a Welsh artisan, named Dylan Sigafoos, used to
make horse-shoes by hand at the rate of four a day. After the.
Industrial Revolution, with the aid of a steam engine, Sigafoos
wa.s able to make entire horses!
And so it went—factories rising from the plains, cities bur
geoning around the factories, transport and commerce keeping
pace -until today, thanks to economics, we have smog, reces
sions, and economics textbooks at $7.50 per copy.

technical aspects, let us survey briefly the history of economics.

Economics was discovered I»y flu; Imi«jli>111u;i11, Adam Smith.
He published Ids findings in but everybody giggled so
h:ird that Smith, blushing hotly, nave up the whole thing and
went into the cough drop business with his brother.
I'or long years after that economics lay neglected while the
world busied it sol f with other things, like the birth of Victor
Hugo, the last days of Pompeii, and the Bunny Ibig.
Then one day while flying :i kite during a thunderstorm, the
American, Henry (ieorge (also (tailed Thorstoin Neblen), dis
covered the law of diminishing returns, and then, boy, the. fat
was it* the fire! Before you could say "knife the Industrial
Revolution was on! Mechanization and steam power resulted
in prodigies of production. For example, before the Industrial
Revolution, a Welsh artisan, named Dylan Sigafoos, used to
make horse-shoes by hand at the rate of four a day. After the.
Industrial Revolution, with the aid of a steam engine, Sigafoos
wa.s able to make entire horses!
And so it went—factories rising from the plains, cities bur
geoning around the factories, transport and commerce keeping
pace -until today, thanks to economics, we have smog, reces
sions, and economics textbooks at $7.50 per copy.
