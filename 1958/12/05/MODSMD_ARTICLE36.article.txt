Dear Impatience:
All right, all right...lll buy Nail
Glace Kits for all your teachers!
You know, that smart Juliette
Marglen makes them in three
assortments: one's called PASTEL
(this is tor you.) ...four yummy pinks
and corals, plus Cellini Gold and
Cellini Silver; one's MODERN (my
choice; with six of those marvelous
high-fashion colours like Degas
Mauve, Lautrec Orange, Cellini
Bronze; the other's CLASSIC (this
just can't miss) ... four basic reds
and roses plus Juliette Marglen's
wonderful Jewel√üaae and Jewel-
Seal. Just let me know which to
send whom.
For this personalized service
above and beyond the call of even
maternal duty, we'll expect you to
save at least one evening for "just
us folks."
Speaking of us folks, you'll be
amazed at the change in Jimmy
since you went away-I think he's
finally, if reluctantly, been con
vinced that there's hope for you. I
overheard him telling friend Rocky
about his beautiful red-haired sis
ter who "smells like sunshine." I
didn't have the heart to tell him
it's your Faberge Flambeau per
fume from Paris...
Flambeau reminds me that we're
dming by candlelight tonight. To
take your father's mind off the fact
that he can't see what he's eating
will be a new luxury-model ME in
the gold brocade robe he gave me
last Christmas...and Cellini Gold

glen. Think you're the only red
headed siren in the family? En
garde! And love,
