Time To Wrap Things Up
Another Autumn quarter has flown hy, and with it another foot
hall seaso.i, Ihe Ave, and ilie start of another basketball season. And
in lh<> little time tl at's left before the last-minute drive to Ihe wire,
there's not much to do but sum tilings up.
It hasn't been much of a school year so far, but it's going to be,
before it's through. Thai 2-8 record turned in hy Jack Curtice's .squad
was . . . well, disappointing, in some respects only. For a first-year
record lor a new I'CC coach il wasn't bad. After all, Don Clark at
Southern C;d and IVtc Kllioll at Berkeley had to struggle to grab
off one win apiece in I heir initial years in '57.
And when you consider what we almost (darn that yard and one
half) did to California over at Berkeley, the record is even more im
pressive than it looks.
There are still people calling Ihe l!»5X Big Came one of the most
< xciting ever, and they've had time to cool off about it now, but
haven't. And furthermore these (many of t hem, anyway) are people
who have seen then share of Bit; Games and know when Ihe exciting
ones have been played.
( urlice, speaking to his squad at the annual football awards ban
quet earlier this week, told them something that this writer is sure
will linger in their minds a while; it will linger in mine. "You know,"
he said, "litis is the worst year I have ever had as a coach, as far as
a wou-lost record is concerned. But actually il is the finest year 1
have ever had. To see you all come out on Monday afternoons full of

fight and spirit to prepare i'or the
next week's game was an inspir
ation to lll''.
"Tlien 1 were times when 112 didn't
see how you could do it, with all
the disappointments you've had
litis year. Hut you know, that is
one of a coach's greatest joys, to
coach a team that won't give up
no matter the odds against them
seem to he. You are the finest
team I have ever coached."
And Jack, you thanked Ihe
Daily for all its help and cover
age I his year, and we thank you
for your compliment. It has been
a pleasure to do it. We, too, would
like to have written up a few
more wins, but just as much en
joyed covering a fine football
team, win or lose. Ami to you,
.Mr. Curtice, we would like to say
"Thank you for all your help. It
has been a pleasure to work with
you this year. Our pages have
reflected the humor which has al
ways darkened the gloom, and we
feel that you are one of the fin
est coaches we have known."

The jackets, rihgs and blankets have been given out, the last I
steaks of the year have been tucked nicely under the belts, and the I
l>i< tare, at least here at Stanford, is a basketball one now.
lint on other campuses football is still in the spotlight. It most
certainly is over at Cal where the Berkeley Hears are making mental
plans for lowa in the I{)f>{> liose Bowl game. Poor Bears, they are
17 point underdogs right now, and there's a chance that the odds
makers wili boost the figure even higher, barring injuries to lowa,
before the January I kickol'f. But such it is when a I'CC club goes
; gainst the Bij; Ten in the Classic. And'SO there's nothing to do
hul put your money where the smart men toll you and pick lowa
for a win in I'asadetia.
Oieer { p (loiigars—TheyYe (Iriimhs
And h'Me in three of the now-defunct I'CC campuses football is
still in the spotlight. Maybe on throe, conscience depending, and
surely on one.
The Washington State College Cougars are not going to a bowl j
gam< this year, even though they really want to, and probably could |
have picked up a bid from somewhere. And for this they can thank I
the guile, s universities of California ut Los Angeles and Southern
C jlifornia.
Itow the officials al these two Southland schools can sleep these
r.ighls I am at a loss to understand. Surely in all sports history j
there is not a record of a more unsportsmanlike act. Probably not i
in ;dl history is there such an open display of hypocrisy and small '
ness. Kven diplomats disguise theirs with smooth talk. The south-!
ern schools didn't have the dignity to do that.
Well, maybe things'll be better in the A AWI , but 1 just can't see j
how. Suggest the following meaning for those initials: Athletes
After Wampum, I uite!
And also over at Cal there's a fuming quarterback named Joe Kapp
who feels he has been insulted because nobody picked him in "the
lootball draft. Al least in the first four rounds. Perhaps one of the
reasons might be that no pro club uses the split T attack which
made Kapp famous.
Then, too, ii might be because Kapp isn't one of Ihc nation's great j
est ball players. It's hard to realize, Joe, but looks like it's true, j
lie certainly isn't "another Tobin Kote" as his coach Pete lOlliott sees
him. Cher up, Joe, there are 26 more rounds coming later on.
so NOW IT'S BASKETBALL. And tonight llowie Dallmar's club ;
goes into the annual Cow Palance set of games which are seen as
Important for the club. Tonight the Indians take on Santa Clara in j
what is expected to % bo a fairly easy go for Stanford, but one in which !
the club will have to show what it has to come away with a victory. !
In tomorrow night's fracas against St. Mary's, Stanford meets
what is supposed to be a potent, well-polished club. Mow Stanford
fares in ihat one, the experts say, will be an indication of how the
club will look all year. This is a little overboard, but it will be in- '
If?resting to see how the Cards come out of it.
Dallmar's men were impressive in their opening tilt against San
Jose State. Poor old SJS, though. Talk about long seasons!
The Stanford's put togelhcr a well- balanced attack that seemed to
be improved in the always-a question rebounding department. If the
Big Red hoop Machine continues to play a sound game here, and
also uses shooters I'unl Neumann, John Arrillagu who, by the
way, must like the Cow Palace after what he did to USF there lasl
year and Jerry Thuesen to good advantage, we may really have
something on our hands and in our Pavilion.
And now ihe tumuli and all the shouting is over as far as all the
many other aspects of the quarter are over, too. The football band
has been paid the compliments it so sincerely deserved for all their
many fine shows.
Time to close up shop in the Grandstand for this year and this
ouarter, get the notebook out, and get ready for shot No. 1 of l!);~>;).
A sporting Christmas to you all!

And also over at Cal there's a fuming quarterback named Joe Kapp
who feels he has been insulted because nobody picked him in "the
lootball draft. Al least in the first four rounds. Perhaps one of the
reasons might be that no pro club uses the split T attack which
made Kapp famous.
Then, too, ii might be because Kapp isn't one of Ihc nation's great j
est ball players. It's hard to realize, Joe, but looks like it's true, j
lie certainly isn't "another Tobin Kote" as his coach Pete lOlliott sees
him. Cher up, Joe, there are 26 more rounds coming later on.
so NOW IT'S BASKETBALL. And tonight llowie Dallmar's club ;
goes into the annual Cow Palance set of games which are seen as
Important for the club. Tonight the Indians take on Santa Clara in j
what is expected to % bo a fairly easy go for Stanford, but one in which !
the club will have to show what it has to come away with a victory. !
In tomorrow night's fracas against St. Mary's, Stanford meets
what is supposed to be a potent, well-polished club. Mow Stanford
fares in ihat one, the experts say, will be an indication of how the
club will look all year. This is a little overboard, but it will be in- '
If?resting to see how the Cards come out of it.
Dallmar's men were impressive in their opening tilt against San
Jose State. Poor old SJS, though. Talk about long seasons!
The Stanford's put togelhcr a well- balanced attack that seemed to
be improved in the always-a question rebounding department. If the
Big Red hoop Machine continues to play a sound game here, and
also uses shooters I'unl Neumann, John Arrillagu who, by the
way, must like the Cow Palace after what he did to USF there lasl
year and Jerry Thuesen to good advantage, we may really have
something on our hands and in our Pavilion.
And now ihe tumuli and all the shouting is over as far as all the
many other aspects of the quarter are over, too. The football band
has been paid the compliments it so sincerely deserved for all their
many fine shows.
Time to close up shop in the Grandstand for this year and this

Time To Wrap Things Up
Another Autumn quarter has flown hy, and with it another foot
hall seaso.i, Ihe Ave, and ilie start of another basketball season. And
in lh<> little time tl at's left before the last-minute drive to Ihe wire,
there's not much to do but sum tilings up.
It hasn't been much of a school year so far, but it's going to be,
before it's through. Thai 2-8 record turned in hy Jack Curtice's .squad
was . . . well, disappointing, in some respects only. For a first-year
record lor a new I'CC coach il wasn't bad. After all, Don Clark at
Southern C;d and IVtc Kllioll at Berkeley had to struggle to grab
off one win apiece in I heir initial years in '57.
And when you consider what we almost (darn that yard and one
half) did to California over at Berkeley, the record is even more im
pressive than it looks.
There are still people calling Ihe l!»5X Big Came one of the most
< xciting ever, and they've had time to cool off about it now, but
haven't. And furthermore these (many of t hem, anyway) are people
who have seen then share of Bit; Games and know when Ihe exciting
ones have been played.
( urlice, speaking to his squad at the annual football awards ban
quet earlier this week, told them something that this writer is sure
will linger in their minds a while; it will linger in mine. "You know,"
he said, "litis is the worst year I have ever had as a coach, as far as
a wou-lost record is concerned. But actually il is the finest year 1
have ever had. To see you all come out on Monday afternoons full of

fight and spirit to prepare i'or the
next week's game was an inspir
ation to lll''.
"Tlien 1 were times when 112 didn't
see how you could do it, with all
the disappointments you've had
litis year. Hut you know, that is
one of a coach's greatest joys, to
coach a team that won't give up
no matter the odds against them
seem to he. You are the finest
team I have ever coached."
And Jack, you thanked Ihe
Daily for all its help and cover
age I his year, and we thank you
for your compliment. It has been
a pleasure to do it. We, too, would
like to have written up a few
more wins, but just as much en
joyed covering a fine football
team, win or lose. Ami to you,
.Mr. Curtice, we would like to say
"Thank you for all your help. It
has been a pleasure to work with
you this year. Our pages have
reflected the humor which has al
ways darkened the gloom, and we
feel that you are one of the fin
est coaches we have known."

The jackets, rihgs and blankets have been given out, the last I
steaks of the year have been tucked nicely under the belts, and the I
l>i< tare, at least here at Stanford, is a basketball one now.
lint on other campuses football is still in the spotlight. It most
certainly is over at Cal where the Berkeley Hears are making mental

Time To Wrap Things Up
Another Autumn quarter has flown hy, and with it another foot
hall seaso.i, Ihe Ave, and ilie start of another basketball season. And
in lh<> little time tl at's left before the last-minute drive to Ihe wire,
there's not much to do but sum tilings up.
It hasn't been much of a school year so far, but it's going to be,
before it's through. Thai 2-8 record turned in hy Jack Curtice's .squad
was . . . well, disappointing, in some respects only. For a first-year
record lor a new I'CC coach il wasn't bad. After all, Don Clark at
Southern C;d and IVtc Kllioll at Berkeley had to struggle to grab
off one win apiece in I heir initial years in '57.
And when you consider what we almost (darn that yard and one
half) did to California over at Berkeley, the record is even more im
pressive than it looks.
There are still people calling Ihe l!»5X Big Came one of the most
< xciting ever, and they've had time to cool off about it now, but
haven't. And furthermore these (many of t hem, anyway) are people
who have seen then share of Bit; Games and know when Ihe exciting
ones have been played.
( urlice, speaking to his squad at the annual football awards ban
quet earlier this week, told them something that this writer is sure
will linger in their minds a while; it will linger in mine. "You know,"
he said, "litis is the worst year I have ever had as a coach, as far as
a wou-lost record is concerned. But actually il is the finest year 1
have ever had. To see you all come out on Monday afternoons full of

fight and spirit to prepare i'or the
next week's game was an inspir
ation to lll''.
"Tlien 1 were times when 112 didn't
see how you could do it, with all
the disappointments you've had
litis year. Hut you know, that is
one of a coach's greatest joys, to
coach a team that won't give up
no matter the odds against them
seem to he. You are the finest
team I have ever coached."
And Jack, you thanked Ihe
Daily for all its help and cover
age I his year, and we thank you
for your compliment. It has been
a pleasure to do it. We, too, would
like to have written up a few
more wins, but just as much en
joyed covering a fine football
team, win or lose. Ami to you,
.Mr. Curtice, we would like to say
"Thank you for all your help. It
has been a pleasure to work with
you this year. Our pages have
reflected the humor which has al
ways darkened the gloom, and we
feel that you are one of the fin
est coaches we have known."

The jackets, rihgs and blankets have been given out, the last I
steaks of the year have been tucked nicely under the belts, and the I
l>i< tare, at least here at Stanford, is a basketball one now.
lint on other campuses football is still in the spotlight. It most
certainly is over at Cal where the Berkeley Hears are making mental
plans for lowa in the I{)f>{> liose Bowl game. Poor Bears, they are
17 point underdogs right now, and there's a chance that the odds
makers wili boost the figure even higher, barring injuries to lowa,
before the January I kickol'f. But such it is when a I'CC club goes
; gainst the Bij; Ten in the Classic. And'SO there's nothing to do
hul put your money where the smart men toll you and pick lowa
for a win in I'asadetia.
Oieer { p (loiigars—TheyYe (Iriimhs
And h'Me in three of the now-defunct I'CC campuses football is
still in the spotlight. Maybe on throe, conscience depending, and
surely on one.
The Washington State College Cougars are not going to a bowl j
gam< this year, even though they really want to, and probably could |
have picked up a bid from somewhere. And for this they can thank I
the guile, s universities of California ut Los Angeles and Southern
C jlifornia.
Itow the officials al these two Southland schools can sleep these
r.ighls I am at a loss to understand. Surely in all sports history j
there is not a record of a more unsportsmanlike act. Probably not i
in ;dl history is there such an open display of hypocrisy and small '
ness. Kven diplomats disguise theirs with smooth talk. The south-!
ern schools didn't have the dignity to do that.
Well, maybe things'll be better in the A AWI , but 1 just can't see j
how. Suggest the following meaning for those initials: Athletes
After Wampum, I uite!
And also over at Cal there's a fuming quarterback named Joe Kapp
who feels he has been insulted because nobody picked him in "the
lootball draft. Al least in the first four rounds. Perhaps one of the
reasons might be that no pro club uses the split T attack which
made Kapp famous.
Then, too, ii might be because Kapp isn't one of Ihc nation's great j
est ball players. It's hard to realize, Joe, but looks like it's true, j
lie certainly isn't "another Tobin Kote" as his coach Pete lOlliott sees
him. Cher up, Joe, there are 26 more rounds coming later on.
so NOW IT'S BASKETBALL. And tonight llowie Dallmar's club ;
goes into the annual Cow Palance set of games which are seen as
Important for the club. Tonight the Indians take on Santa Clara in j
what is expected to % bo a fairly easy go for Stanford, but one in which !
the club will have to show what it has to come away with a victory. !
In tomorrow night's fracas against St. Mary's, Stanford meets
what is supposed to be a potent, well-polished club. Mow Stanford
fares in ihat one, the experts say, will be an indication of how the
club will look all year. This is a little overboard, but it will be in- '
If?resting to see how the Cards come out of it.
Dallmar's men were impressive in their opening tilt against San
Jose State. Poor old SJS, though. Talk about long seasons!
The Stanford's put togelhcr a well- balanced attack that seemed to
be improved in the always-a question rebounding department. If the
Big Red hoop Machine continues to play a sound game here, and
also uses shooters I'unl Neumann, John Arrillagu who, by the
way, must like the Cow Palace after what he did to USF there lasl
year and Jerry Thuesen to good advantage, we may really have
something on our hands and in our Pavilion.
And now ihe tumuli and all the shouting is over as far as all the

The Washington State College Cougars are not going to a bowl j

there is not a record of a more unsportsmanlike act. Probably not i

And also over at Cal there's a fuming quarterback named Joe Kapp
who feels he has been insulted because nobody picked him in "the
lootball draft. Al least in the first four rounds. Perhaps one of the
reasons might be that no pro club uses the split T attack which
made Kapp famous.
Then, too, ii might be because Kapp isn't one of Ihc nation's great j
est ball players. It's hard to realize, Joe, but looks like it's true, j

goes into the annual Cow Palance set of games which are seen as

what is expected to % bo a fairly easy go for Stanford, but one in which !
the club will have to show what it has to come away with a victory. !
In tomorrow night's fracas against St. Mary's, Stanford meets
what is supposed to be a potent, well-polished club. Mow Stanford
fares in ihat one, the experts say, will be an indication of how the
club will look all year. This is a little overboard, but it will be in- '
If?resting to see how the Cards come out of it.
Dallmar's men were impressive in their opening tilt against San
Jose State. Poor old SJS, though. Talk about long seasons!
The Stanford's put togelhcr a well- balanced attack that seemed to
be improved in the always-a question rebounding department. If the
Big Red hoop Machine continues to play a sound game here, and
also uses shooters I'unl Neumann, John Arrillagu who, by the
way, must like the Cow Palace after what he did to USF there lasl
year and Jerry Thuesen to good advantage, we may really have
something on our hands and in our Pavilion.
And now ihe tumuli and all the shouting is over as far as all the
many other aspects of the quarter are over, too. The football band

Time To Wrap Things Up
Another Autumn quarter has flown hy, and with it another foot
hall seaso.i, Ihe Ave, and ilie start of another basketball season. And
in lh<> little time tl at's left before the last-minute drive to Ihe wire,
there's not much to do but sum tilings up.
It hasn't been much of a school year so far, but it's going to be,
before it's through. Thai 2-8 record turned in hy Jack Curtice's .squad
was . . . well, disappointing, in some respects only. For a first-year
record lor a new I'CC coach il wasn't bad. After all, Don Clark at
Southern C;d and IVtc Kllioll at Berkeley had to struggle to grab
off one win apiece in I heir initial years in '57.
And when you consider what we almost (darn that yard and one
half) did to California over at Berkeley, the record is even more im
pressive than it looks.
There are still people calling Ihe l!»5X Big Came one of the most
< xciting ever, and they've had time to cool off about it now, but
haven't. And furthermore these (many of t hem, anyway) are people
who have seen then share of Bit; Games and know when Ihe exciting
ones have been played.
( urlice, speaking to his squad at the annual football awards ban
quet earlier this week, told them something that this writer is sure
will linger in their minds a while; it will linger in mine. "You know,"
he said, "litis is the worst year I have ever had as a coach, as far as
a wou-lost record is concerned. But actually il is the finest year 1
have ever had. To see you all come out on Monday afternoons full of

fight and spirit to prepare i'or the
next week's game was an inspir
ation to lll''.
"Tlien 1 were times when 112 didn't
see how you could do it, with all
the disappointments you've had
litis year. Hut you know, that is
one of a coach's greatest joys, to
coach a team that won't give up
no matter the odds against them
seem to he. You are the finest
team I have ever coached."
And Jack, you thanked Ihe
Daily for all its help and cover
age I his year, and we thank you
for your compliment. It has been
a pleasure to do it. We, too, would
like to have written up a few
more wins, but just as much en
joyed covering a fine football
team, win or lose. Ami to you,
.Mr. Curtice, we would like to say
"Thank you for all your help. It
has been a pleasure to work with
you this year. Our pages have
reflected the humor which has al
ways darkened the gloom, and we
feel that you are one of the fin
