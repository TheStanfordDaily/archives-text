| the Tribe, 67*45, last year, the
night before Stanford stunned the
hoop world with its victory over
jUSF. .
Heading the attack is 6-3 for
j ward Frank Sobrero, and he will
j get lots of help from George ( Jar
diner, Mel Preseott, Jim Russi,
! Jim Taylor and Jerry Bachieh.
St. Mary's Rated High
St. Mary's has dropped close
ones to the Tribe for three
straight years, and Gael followers
think things will be different this
year. In fact, they look for things
to be different all season in Mor
aga, as the Galloping Gaels are
ranked as the class of the WCAC

and second only l<> Washington j
on the Coast.
There hasn't been this much ex
citement at St. Mary's since Her
man Wedcmeyer was running up
and down gridirons Willi a foot j
hall I .'j years ago.
Iloss K«'tl|l'||S
The Gaels welcome hack such
stalwarts as G-5 Laroy Doss, who
poured through 2.1 against Stan
ford last season, and G-5 Dick
aly, versatile All-Conference per
former. I-lit I he main reason for I
all the excitement is a group ol
sophomores who rolled over 17•
straight foes last sea-son as fresh
men.
Best of the lot is (I "> Tom Mer
schery, a prep All American from
San Francisco. Merschery scored

12 points in the Gaels' not-too
impressive opening triumph over
Sacramento State. But this was
almost all there was to the sopho
more scoring.
Al Claiborne, a fi-S sophomore
who opened al center, managed
only one point, and the much
heralded 5-10 guard Joe Gardere
scored nary a point. So there may
he more veterans than expected
on the floor for coach Jim Weaver
this week end.
ltriiins lo I'lay
Card fans will also get a look
al UCLA, perennial PCC contend
er. The Bruins will unveil their
(i-|(i soph sensation Warned Jones,
but veterans Walt Torrence, Bo
land Underbill and Baler Johnson
may carry the load.
