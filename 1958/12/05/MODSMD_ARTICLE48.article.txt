# WANT FIRST WIN
## Frosh Hoopsters Ready for Colts 
### 
After opening their season with a light loss to San Jose
frosh, Stanford's freshmen basketball team will really get into the
swing of the campaign with two games this weekend in the Cow
Palace. Friday night's opponent will he Santa Clara's yearlings with
St. Mary's providing the opposition on Saturday. Both games are
scheduled for 5:30. The Santa Clara contingent will be lead by Gary

Keister, a towering All-Slater;
from Anaeortes, Washington. Hill
Ross and John Sullivan, who I
stand at G-7 and G-G respectively,
go a long way toward completing
the Bronco frosh team which
should provide rugged competi
tion for the Papoose five.
At the head of the SI. Mary's;
team is Bud Ilart, G-3, a high
school All-American.
Both teams are described by SIT
frosh coach Bill Taylor as big
and fast.
Looking back on Monday's loss
to San Jose, Taylor agrees that
the frosh will have to improve if
they want to win this weekend. I
"Defensively we were pitiful,";
he said. "The hall handling wasn't
good either. We took shots 100
quickly without getting set up.
I hope it's been straightened
out."
The offensive patterns have
been altered somewhat to let tlie
big men have ihc ball more often. \
This means that Stanford fans
will probably see John Windsor,
the G-7 center, and Rich llosley,
the G-7 forward, shooting and
playmaking more often than they
did during the San Jose tilt.

Windsor, a highly touted prep
star from Missouri, scored 1 i
points Monday night, but was
able to hit for only A points in
the fitsl half. His shooting per
centage was high though, as he
sunk about 40of his shots.
Having the ball more often
should help him raise his point
total and also let him set up more
plays under Ihe basket.
The big center also had some
trouble rebounding. Taylor at
tributes this somewhat to Ihe
fact that San Jose often had their
taller players away from the
basket which kept Windsor out
of rebounding area.
The Frosh end fall quarter play
this weekend but after the
vacation, they return borne and
host Kast Contra Costa JC, Jan.

sunk about 40of his shots.
Having the ball more often
should help him raise his point
total and also let him set up more
plays under Ihe basket.
The big center also had some
trouble rebounding. Taylor at
tributes this somewhat to Ihe
fact that San Jose often had their
taller players away from the
basket which kept Windsor out
of rebounding area.

After opening their season with a light loss to San Jose
frosh, Stanford's freshmen basketball team will really get into the
swing of the campaign with two games this weekend in the Cow
Palace. Friday night's opponent will he Santa Clara's yearlings with
St. Mary's providing the opposition on Saturday. Both games are
scheduled for 5:30. The Santa Clara contingent will be lead by Gary

Keister, a towering All-Slater;
from Anaeortes, Washington. Hill
Ross and John Sullivan, who I
stand at G-7 and G-G respectively,
go a long way toward completing
the Bronco frosh team which
should provide rugged competi
tion for the Papoose five.
At the head of the SI. Mary's;
team is Bud Ilart, G-3, a high
school All-American.
Both teams are described by SIT
frosh coach Bill Taylor as big
and fast.
Looking back on Monday's loss
to San Jose, Taylor agrees that
the frosh will have to improve if
they want to win this weekend. I
"Defensively we were pitiful,";
he said. "The hall handling wasn't
good either. We took shots 100
quickly without getting set up.
I hope it's been straightened
out."
The offensive patterns have
been altered somewhat to let tlie
big men have ihc ball more often. \
This means that Stanford fans
will probably see John Windsor,
the G-7 center, and Rich llosley,
the G-7 forward, shooting and
playmaking more often than they
did during the San Jose tilt.

Windsor, a highly touted prep
star from Missouri, scored 1 i
points Monday night, but was
able to hit for only A points in
the fitsl half. His shooting per
centage was high though, as he
sunk about 40of his shots.
