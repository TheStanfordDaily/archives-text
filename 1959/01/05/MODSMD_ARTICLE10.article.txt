# NO. 2 KREMLIN LEADER
## Mikoyan in Washington on 'Holiday'; Hopes for Eisenhower Conference 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP) — The So
viet Union's Anastas I. Mikoyan
arrived Sunday for what he called
an American "holiday" but, he
quickly arranged to meet with
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles at noon Monday.
The bouncy 63 - year - old first
deputy premier said he is ready

and willing to talk about the Ber
lin crisis or any other East-West
problem during the two weeks he
expects to be in this country.
Mikoyan, who ranks as No. 2
Kremlin leader, said he also hopes
to meet with President Eisenhow
er during his stay in the capital.
"We respect him in our coun
try," Mikoyan said as he stepped
off a Scandinavian airliner in
New York. "It would be a pleas
ure to see him."
Heavy Guards
About 400 New York policemen
and government security agents
guarded Mikoyan's every step as
he arrived at New York's Idle
wild Airport at 5:11 a.m., nearly
two hours ahead of schedule.
A dozen Hungarian refugee
Freedom Fighters, waving anti-
Comrhunist placards, shouted
"Communist dog" and "murder
er" as he left by police-escorted
limousine for Washington. The
strict security precautions pre
vented any further demonstra
tions.
State Department officials said
Eisenhower would be happy to
meet with Mikoyan even though
his visitor has not yet requested
a White House appointment.
Any Eisenhower-Mikoyan talk,
however, may be delayed until
the Soviet leader returns from a
cross-country tour of about 10
days.
"Peace and Friendship"
In a jovial mood, Mikoyan
brought what he called the So
viets' New Year message of
"peace and friendship" to the
American people and their lead
ers. He hammered hard at this
peace theme in remarks both in
Washington and in New York.
Mikoyan's expressed readiness
to talk over foreign policy prob
lems did little to clear up the air
of mystery about his visit. Few
top Eisenhower administration of
ficials believe he has come on a
vacation as he claims.
Most authorities strongly sus
pect his trip is a cold war maneu
ver, perhaps linked to the Berlin
crisis. Some believe Mikoyan has
been given the assignment of
hinting at possible Soviet conces
sions to ease this deadlock.
Asked if he wanted to talk to
U.S. officials about Berlin, Mi
koyan professed to have no par
ticular problem on his mind.
But lie added: "If there is a
meeting, there probably will be a
discussion on various subjects."
Mikoyan, a trade expert lately
turned foreign policy trouble
shooter, was asked if he wanted
a loan for the Soviet government.
"Are you proposing any?" he
shot back with a roar of laughter.

He sidestepped a question
about whether the Soviet Union
would share data gained from the
rocket with other nations. He an
swered that Russian scientists al
ready are sharing information
with foreign countries as part of
the now-ended International Geo
physical Year explorations.

vented any further demonstra
tions.
State Department officials said
Eisenhower would be happy to
meet with Mikoyan even though
his visitor has not yet requested
a White House appointment.
Any Eisenhower-Mikoyan talk,
however, may be delayed until
the Soviet leader returns from a
cross-country tour of about 10
days.
"Peace and Friendship"
In a jovial mood, Mikoyan
brought what he called the So
viets' New Year message of
"peace and friendship" to the
American people and their lead
ers. He hammered hard at this
peace theme in remarks both in
Washington and in New York.
Mikoyan's expressed readiness
to talk over foreign policy prob
lems did little to clear up the air
of mystery about his visit. Few
top Eisenhower administration of
ficials believe he has come on a
vacation as he claims.
Most authorities strongly sus
pect his trip is a cold war maneu
ver, perhaps linked to the Berlin
crisis. Some believe Mikoyan has
been given the assignment of
hinting at possible Soviet conces
sions to ease this deadlock.
Asked if he wanted to talk to
U.S. officials about Berlin, Mi
koyan professed to have no par
ticular problem on his mind.
But lie added: "If there is a
meeting, there probably will be a
discussion on various subjects."
Mikoyan, a trade expert lately
turned foreign policy trouble
shooter, was asked if he wanted
a loan for the Soviet government.
"Are you proposing any?" he
shot back with a roar of laughter.

He sidestepped a question
about whether the Soviet Union
would share data gained from the
rocket with other nations. He an
swered that Russian scientists al
ready are sharing information
with foreign countries as part of
the now-ended International Geo
physical Year explorations.
WASHINGTON (JP) — The So
viet Union's Anastas I. Mikoyan
arrived Sunday for what he called
an American "holiday" but, he
quickly arranged to meet with
Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles at noon Monday.
The bouncy 63 - year - old first
deputy premier said he is ready

and willing to talk about the Ber
lin crisis or any other East-West
problem during the two weeks he
expects to be in this country.
Mikoyan, who ranks as No. 2
Kremlin leader, said he also hopes
to meet with President Eisenhow
er during his stay in the capital.
"We respect him in our coun
try," Mikoyan said as he stepped
off a Scandinavian airliner in
New York. "It would be a pleas
ure to see him."
Heavy Guards
About 400 New York policemen
and government security agents
guarded Mikoyan's every step as
he arrived at New York's Idle
wild Airport at 5:11 a.m., nearly
two hours ahead of schedule.
A dozen Hungarian refugee
Freedom Fighters, waving anti-
Comrhunist placards, shouted
"Communist dog" and "murder
er" as he left by police-escorted
limousine for Washington. The
strict security precautions pre
vented any further demonstra
tions.
