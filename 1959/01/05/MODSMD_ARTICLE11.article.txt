HAVANA, Cuba (/P) â€”'The dis
arming of thousands of eager
young volunteers and the brief
opening of food stores Sunday
eased this capital's tension and
hunger.
Conquering hero Fidel Castro
kept this old Cuban capital wait
ing impatiently for his arrival.
But with Cuba in the palm of his
hand, he was reported to be say
ing he had no intention of exer
cising personal power.
The 32-year-old rebel chief has
been appointed head of the armed
forces by Manuel Urrutia, who
took the oath as provisional pres
ident at a ceremony Saturday
night in Santiago de Cuba, the
provisional capital in the eastern
province of Oriente.
There was no official hint as
to when Castro, or Urrutia whom
he boosted to office, would reach
Havana. There were reports,
however, that Castro expected to
arrive Wednesday.
At least five of former Presi
dent Fulgencio Batista's hench
men have been executed by the
rebels in speedy revenge for the
repressive measures used by the
former regime's security forces.
Captain Jose Garcia Menochal,
a police inspector in westernmost
Pinar del Rio province, was found
hanged Sunday. The rebel radio
previously announced Brig. Gen.
Joaquin Casilla, who was Batis
ta's commander in Las Villas
province, and three of his top
staff officers had been captured
and executed after a swift trial.
