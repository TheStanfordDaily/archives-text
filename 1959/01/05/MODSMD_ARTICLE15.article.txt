The wheels of progress are turning—in this case it is the wheels,
gears, levers, etc., in the IBM machine which are whirling about
to increase the efficiency of the registration procedure.
When students line up today at Memorial Auditorium they
will receive, instead of the many-paged registration booklet, a
single IBM card to fill out.
According to Registrar Harvey Hull, the. new curd
should sure the student five to ten minutes in registra
tion. We roundly applaud the improvement, because it
not only saves lime but saves the student from writer s
cramp.
After all, those five or ten minutes will give the registrant extra
time to stand in the book line, which will no doubt wind around
blocks for days. Perhaps Stanford scientists could perfect an IBM
sorting machine for the Bookstore —one with all colors ol lights,
and bells which go oil when the book is not in stock. Or better
still, maybe a noble-minded service group on campus could serve
hot coffee and doughnuts to the conscientious students who feel
they need books for their work.
The other advantage of the new card system is that it helps
prevent writer's cramp —or rather postpones it. Ihe student now
can save his fingers and hand until his professors start assigning
the numerous papers—only one a week, il you re. lucky. And for
mid-terms, too; again not more than oire a week—if you re lucky
(the one-a-week variety are known as quizzes to the uneducated).
Perhaps the next use will be to hand out IBM cards
instead of blue boohs. With the increase in speed of
grading, professors could give even more exams.
Also, one doesn't have to keep repeating so many little details
—phone number, P.O. box, etc. He can save those talents, too,
for the professors who will soon be throwing a nraze of names,
places and dates for him to memorize.
But these joys of collegiate life are still in the future; the most
urgent matter is to get to Mem Aud at the appointed time today,
in order to avoid a late-filing fee.

still, maybe a noble-minded service group on campus could serve
hot coffee and doughnuts to the conscientious students who feel
they need books for their work.
The other advantage of the new card system is that it helps
prevent writer's cramp —or rather postpones it. Ihe student now
can save his fingers and hand until his professors start assigning
the numerous papers—only one a week, il you re. lucky. And for
mid-terms, too; again not more than oire a week—if you re lucky
(the one-a-week variety are known as quizzes to the uneducated).
Perhaps the next use will be to hand out IBM cards
instead of blue boohs. With the increase in speed of
grading, professors could give even more exams.
Also, one doesn't have to keep repeating so many little details
—phone number, P.O. box, etc. He can save those talents, too,
for the professors who will soon be throwing a nraze of names,
places and dates for him to memorize.
But these joys of collegiate life are still in the future; the most
urgent matter is to get to Mem Aud at the appointed time today,
in order to avoid a late-filing fee.
