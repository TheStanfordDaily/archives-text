# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## Here We Go... 
### 
Typewriters are dusted off,
presses warmed up and cries for
publicity are rolling into the Daily
Shack. It's a new year and a new
quarter.
While our position, fortunately,
isn't that of the New York news
papers—we planned our vacation;
they didn't—we still have much
news to catch up on.
Since our last issue, the an
nouncement has been made that
Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, director
of Hoover Institution, has been
appointed president of Mills Col
lege; five Russian university pres
idents visited campus; new holes
have been dug in the streets. The
reader will find more on these
things in our news columns this
week.
A tightly packed schedule of
activities has been planned by
the Committee on Public Exer
cises this quarter; the Political
Union is planning- a special con
clave; and the lIR is preparing
a Russian institute.
Hostels, the Sophomore Cotil
lion, ski week ends will further
highlight the quarter.
Besides news of these activities,
the reader will find in The Daily
some time these next weeks a re
v ie w of Aldous Huxley's new
work, "Brave New World Revisit
ed." Play reviews are scheduled,
as are feature stories on the prog
ress in the General Studies Pro
gram and the Tresidder Union.
There will also be more on the
work of the president's Student-
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs.
On the national, international
and interplanetary scene, develop
ments have been among the spec
tacular since early December.
The United States fired a four
ton-plus Atlas missile into orbit,
topping earlier Russian achieve
ments. And news commentators
and reporters went into their
annual year - end reviews and
predictions.
No sooner were the prognosti
cators finished than the Soviets
fired a rocket past the moon.
Though it now appears that the
rocket will orbit the sun. the So
viets have also announced plans
to equip a manned rocket to the
moon in the comparatively near

future, taking much of the glory
from our orbiting Atlas.
Summaries of 1958 had hardly
been absorbed when Cuban rebels
overthrew Batista and handed to
Castro their country's leadership.
But to return to the space pro
gram for a few lines, 1958 had
some good quotes which still will
apply. Lt. Gen. James Gavin, the
Army's former research chief,
predicted; "Make no mistake
about it. The first man who will
walk on the moon lias already
been born —I hope in America."
Adm. H. G. Rickover com
mented, "One of the most won
derful things that happened in
our Nautilus program was that
everybody knew it was going to
fail —so they let us completely
alone and we were able to do
the job."
In education, the new Aga
Khan, returning to Harvard, re
marked: "Coming back to school,
with a year of travel behind me,
I'm driven by a desire to know
more. This is a warm and happy
place when it is your last year
and you know what you want."
His statement will probably be
echoed by many a student, espe
cially with his qualifying phrases.
IT'S SAD to see no one wanted
to sponsor a winter quarter Reg
Dance. There are so few all-cam
pus, on-campus functions. But if
they are not patronized we don't
blame organizations for not want
ing to lose money.
At the end of autumn quarter
the suggestion was made in the
ASSU Cabinet meeting that
weekly informal functions be
planned on campus —these have
not been too successful in the
past, but such things take time
and are habit-forming. We hope
the social coordinating board
can work something out.
This situation—few all-campus,
on-campus doings—should be al
leviated when Tresidder Union is
built. The condition of Tresidder
looks promising—but more on
that later this month.
One thing about January—it's
a time of calendars. We have a
charming one over our desk, with
a scantily-garbed New Year blow
ing his horn and muttering, with
an apprehensive look in his eye,
"Here we go again!!!"

moon in the comparatively near

future, taking much of the glory
from our orbiting Atlas.
Summaries of 1958 had hardly
been absorbed when Cuban rebels
overthrew Batista and handed to
Castro their country's leadership.
But to return to the space pro
gram for a few lines, 1958 had
some good quotes which still will
apply. Lt. Gen. James Gavin, the
Army's former research chief,
predicted; "Make no mistake
about it. The first man who will
walk on the moon lias already
been born —I hope in America."
Adm. H. G. Rickover com
mented, "One of the most won
derful things that happened in
our Nautilus program was that
everybody knew it was going to
fail —so they let us completely
alone and we were able to do
the job."
In education, the new Aga
Khan, returning to Harvard, re
marked: "Coming back to school,
with a year of travel behind me,
I'm driven by a desire to know
more. This is a warm and happy
place when it is your last year
and you know what you want."
His statement will probably be
echoed by many a student, espe
cially with his qualifying phrases.
IT'S SAD to see no one wanted
to sponsor a winter quarter Reg
Dance. There are so few all-cam
pus, on-campus functions. But if
they are not patronized we don't
blame organizations for not want
ing to lose money.
At the end of autumn quarter
the suggestion was made in the
ASSU Cabinet meeting that
weekly informal functions be
planned on campus —these have
not been too successful in the
past, but such things take time
and are habit-forming. We hope
the social coordinating board
can work something out.
This situation—few all-campus,
on-campus doings—should be al
leviated when Tresidder Union is
built. The condition of Tresidder
looks promising—but more on
that later this month.
One thing about January—it's
a time of calendars. We have a

Typewriters are dusted off,
presses warmed up and cries for
publicity are rolling into the Daily

quarter.
While our position, fortunately,
isn't that of the New York news

they didn't—we still have much
news to catch up on.
Since our last issue, the an
nouncement has been made that
Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, director
of Hoover Institution, has been
appointed president of Mills Col

idents visited campus; new holes
have been dug in the streets. The
reader will find more on these
things in our news columns this
week.
A tightly packed schedule of
activities has been planned by
the Committee on Public Exer

Union is planning- a special con

a Russian institute.
Hostels, the Sophomore Cotil

highlight the quarter.
Besides news of these activities,
the reader will find in The Daily
some time these next weeks a re
v ie w of Aldous Huxley's new
work, "Brave New World Revisit
ed." Play reviews are scheduled,
as are feature stories on the prog

There will also be more on the
work of the president's Student-
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs.
On the national, international
and interplanetary scene, develop

The United States fired a four

No sooner were the prognosti

One thing about January—it's
a time of calendars. We have a
charming one over our desk, with
a scantily-garbed New Year blow
ing his horn and muttering, with
an apprehensive look in his eye,
"Here we go again!!!"
Typewriters are dusted off,
presses warmed up and cries for
publicity are rolling into the Daily
Shack. It's a new year and a new
quarter.
While our position, fortunately,
isn't that of the New York news
papers—we planned our vacation;
they didn't—we still have much
news to catch up on.
Since our last issue, the an
nouncement has been made that
Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, director
of Hoover Institution, has been
appointed president of Mills Col
lege; five Russian university pres
idents visited campus; new holes
have been dug in the streets. The
reader will find more on these
things in our news columns this
week.
A tightly packed schedule of
activities has been planned by
the Committee on Public Exer
cises this quarter; the Political
Union is planning- a special con
clave; and the lIR is preparing
a Russian institute.
Hostels, the Sophomore Cotil
lion, ski week ends will further
highlight the quarter.
Besides news of these activities,
the reader will find in The Daily
some time these next weeks a re
v ie w of Aldous Huxley's new
work, "Brave New World Revisit
ed." Play reviews are scheduled,
as are feature stories on the prog
ress in the General Studies Pro
gram and the Tresidder Union.
There will also be more on the
work of the president's Student-
Faculty Advisory Committee on
Academic Affairs.
On the national, international
and interplanetary scene, develop
ments have been among the spec
tacular since early December.
The United States fired a four
ton-plus Atlas missile into orbit,
topping earlier Russian achieve
ments. And news commentators
and reporters went into their
annual year - end reviews and
predictions.
No sooner were the prognosti
cators finished than the Soviets
fired a rocket past the moon.
Though it now appears that the
rocket will orbit the sun. the So
viets have also announced plans
to equip a manned rocket to the
moon in the comparatively near

future, taking much of the glory
from our orbiting Atlas.
Summaries of 1958 had hardly
been absorbed when Cuban rebels
overthrew Batista and handed to
Castro their country's leadership.
But to return to the space pro
gram for a few lines, 1958 had
some good quotes which still will
apply. Lt. Gen. James Gavin, the
Army's former research chief,
predicted; "Make no mistake
about it. The first man who will
walk on the moon lias already
been born —I hope in America."
Adm. H. G. Rickover com
mented, "One of the most won
derful things that happened in
our Nautilus program was that
everybody knew it was going to
fail —so they let us completely
alone and we were able to do
the job."
In education, the new Aga
Khan, returning to Harvard, re
marked: "Coming back to school,
with a year of travel behind me,
I'm driven by a desire to know
more. This is a warm and happy
place when it is your last year
and you know what you want."
His statement will probably be
echoed by many a student, espe
cially with his qualifying phrases.
IT'S SAD to see no one wanted
to sponsor a winter quarter Reg
Dance. There are so few all-cam
pus, on-campus functions. But if
they are not patronized we don't
blame organizations for not want
ing to lose money.
At the end of autumn quarter
the suggestion was made in the
ASSU Cabinet meeting that
weekly informal functions be
planned on campus —these have
not been too successful in the
past, but such things take time
and are habit-forming. We hope
the social coordinating board
can work something out.
This situation—few all-campus,
on-campus doings—should be al
leviated when Tresidder Union is
built. The condition of Tresidder
looks promising—but more on
that later this month.
