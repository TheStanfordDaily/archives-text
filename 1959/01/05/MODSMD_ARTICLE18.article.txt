## Under-developed Countries Vital 
### 
Taking stock at the year end,
there are those who think that
our position in the cold war has
improved and that in the end all
will be well if we stand firm and
persevere. On the other hand,
there are those who think that
the balance of military power is
turning against us, and also that
in the underdeveloped regions ol
Africa, Asia and South America
the tide is running against us.
They do not think that it is
enough to stand firm and perse
vere. It is necessary also to take
bold and costly measures to turn
the tide. They think that time is
not on our side unless we make a
prodigious effort in armaments,
in the development of our own
economy to support them, and in
a demonstration that there is a
way, other than the Communist
way, by which the underdeveloped
nations can overcome their weak
ness and master their poverty.
I should like to define the cen
tral reason why, as things are
now going, the West is losing the
contest in the under-developed
countries.

The central reason is that the
advanced and industrialized West
ern countries of North America
and western Europe and Austra
lasia are growing richer, while
the underdeveloped countries, out
side the Communist or bit, remain
irr dire poverty and, insofar as
they are advancing, are moving
very slowly.
It is in this factual situation, it
is in this soil, that Communism is
expanding. For the Soviet Union
has succeeded in demonstrating
that there is a way, though harsh
and cruel, by which a country can
be raised by its own bootstraps.
There are about 400 million peo
ple in western Europe, North
America and Australasia, and
they have, m e a s u r e d in 1949
prices, an average income per cap
ita of not quite $900 a year. In
the underdeveloped countries, ex
cluding Red China, th e r e are
about 1.000 million people and
they have an average per capita
income of about $60 a year-.
It. is obvious that this enormous

gap can be narrowed only if the
backward countries are able to
use modern technology in agri
culture, mining and industry. But
to use the modern technology
there are needed technically train
ed men and capital.
At a rough estimate, the heavy
basic industries, such as steel, re
quire a capital investment per
man of about $20,000, more or
less. For the lighter industries
something in the neighborhood of
$0,000 capital per man is needed.
In the West, we are able to save

and invest productively about 10
per- cent ol our income per capita
per year. That comes to an aver
age of about $90 invested per per
son in new plant and machinery.
But that $9u is more than the
whole income of the average per
son in the underdeveloped coun
tries.
This is the point at which the
Communist challenge really lie
comes so formidable.
To aver t Stalinism of one sort

I or another in the underdeveloped
I countries, it i<s imperative that the
| West provide and lend the capital
| needed for the transition from
j backwardness to the modern tech
nology.
