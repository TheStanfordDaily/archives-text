After opening ttie 1 ftf>9 Pacific Coast Conference
schedule vviih a 59-40 win over the Washington
State College Cougars on Friday, coach Howie
Dallmar's Stanford Indians sank into a little de
spair on Saturday night after dropping a thriller
to Idaho's Vandals by the very low scoring mark of
30-31.
Tight defensive and deliberate offensive play by
the Vandals spelled the ( aids' defeat. Idaho was
three points down al halflime, 2219, but managed
to hold Ihe Indians off, bid lot a free throw, for
12 minutes of the second stanza while they as
sumed a 31 23 lead.
Center Dick Ilaga finally broke the field goal
ice for Stanford.
(nntrol I irst Ila!f
The score was tied three times in the first half,
though the Vandals never led. Stanford stood out
like an only slightly less than-championship club
as it took control in the early stanza. But it cooled
off unbelievably once the second half started.
The game set a new low Conference foul mark
with only 1(5 personals called in the 10 minutes of
play. Nine of the calls were made on the Indians,
seven against Idaho.
After the Vandals had grabbed their second-half
eight-point lead, the Indians put on the pressure
and scored six straight points. Leading by only
two, Idaho decided to play possesion ball and the
pressured Indians couldn't do anything about it.
During the final three minutes Idaho picked up
three free throws, from desperation fouls, to ice
the game.
Idaho completely dominated the boards in the
second half and came up with al

48-32 rebounding edge for Ihe
night.
Haga picked lip eight points
in the first half, hut could add
only two more the rest of the
night to come up Indians' high
pointer with 10. Vandal guard
John Liveious paced all scorers
with 13.
Stanford recorded a 25 per cent
scoring mark, connecting on 14
out of 56 shots. Idaho hit on 30
per cent of its shots.
All Neumann
The previous night it was all
co-captain Paul Neumann as the
locals scored their opening-night
victory over the WNC Cougars.
Neumann scored seven of his
nine field goals on driving lay-ins
and added 24 points to the cause.
Stanford played a slow, deliber
ate game in spoiling the Confer
ence debut of Cougar coach Marv
Harshman. Sot plays pretty much
spoiled the WSC doom.
Dallmar's quintet held a 27 20
halftime lead and began to worry
at only one point throughout the
rest of the game. Here, the Cou
gars closed the score to 29-26, but
Neumann scored, was fouled, and
Haga also added a field goal to
send the locals out of reach.
Haga was prominent, in Card
scoring, too, with 14 counters.

The score was tied three times in the first half,
though the Vandals never led. Stanford stood out
like an only slightly less than-championship club
as it took control in the early stanza. But it cooled
off unbelievably once the second half started.
The game set a new low Conference foul mark
with only 1(5 personals called in the 10 minutes of
play. Nine of the calls were made on the Indians,
seven against Idaho.
After the Vandals had grabbed their second-half
eight-point lead, the Indians put on the pressure
and scored six straight points. Leading by only
two, Idaho decided to play possesion ball and the
pressured Indians couldn't do anything about it.
During the final three minutes Idaho picked up
three free throws, from desperation fouls, to ice
the game.
Idaho completely dominated the boards in the
second half and came up with al

48-32 rebounding edge for Ihe
night.

Dallmar's quintet held a 27 20
