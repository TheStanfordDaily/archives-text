# Card Quintet Meets OSC In Corvallis Tilt Tonight
## 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
Finishing up their annual "swing ihrough Siberia," Coach Howie
Dallmar's Stanford Indians invade the Oregon State coliseum tonight
for their third Pacific Coast Conference game in four days.
Stanford takes ;t 1-1 record into the contest against Slats Gill's 0-1
Beavers, defending PCC co-champions. The Beavers' loss was a 49-41

setback dealt them by Southern
California. But OSC didn't take
it sitting down, they scrapped all
the way before falling by ihe
wayside in the final six minutes.
Stanford will be without the
services of forward Jerry Thue
sen, left at home to recover from
an attack of pneumonia, and with
out the starting services of guard
Doug Warren. Warren injured
his ankle in the Olympic Club
game here on Dec. 27, and has
been used sparingly in the North
west series.
Hendry, Rose Start
Sophomore John Hendry has
started both PCC encounters in

Thuesen's place, contributing sub
slantially to the defensive effort,
and dumping in five counters in
each contest. Jerry Hose has
played well in Warren's starting
guard position.
Gill's squad has suffered some
what from the loss of Dave Gam
bee, Ihe school's all-time point
leader and the '57 Conference
scoring champion. Steady for-

ward Kenny Nanson has also
been lost via the graduation route
along with dependable reserves
Wayne Moss and Gary Haynes.
But all is not black in Beaver
town as Ihe OSC squad will be
bolstered with the return of four
two-year lettermen. Guards Lee
Harman (6-0) and Jim Anderson
(5-9) and forwards Gary Goble
(6-8) and Ted Miller (6-2) will
form the nucleus of Gill's '59 op
erations.
Many Points
Harman opened the '59 season
with a 21-point barrage against
Oregon's Ducks on Dec. 1. Miller
and Goble helped considerably in
that tussle with 19 and 14 points
respectively.
The Beavers will present a bal
anced squad this year with no
standout like Gambee forecast.
And one other hopeful spot in
the Beaver attack is a stronger
bench than OSC has had in recent
years.
Stanford faces a small handi
cap what with its schedule calling
for three games in four days with
a fair amount of traveling in be
tween.
Cold Second Half
The Indians sparkled in their
defeat of Washington State with
Neumann grabbing most of the
honor for that one. Against Ida
ho, however, the Indians had one
of the coldest second halves they
have seen in a long whilp, and
fought all through that stanza for
the tying point.
If the Cards can put together a
strong second half tonight they
should come away with a victory.
The squad has had no first-half
troble to date, and most of the
fading they have done has been
in the last stanza.
Crew Workouts
Winter quarter crew workouts
start on Wednesday of this week.
Anyone interested in turning out
for varsity or freshman crew
should contact the crew repre
sentative at the BAC today.
