Ahoul Those Pavilion Skills
Oon'l know whether you've hom-tl il or not, but there's a rumble
going aioimd about the disposition of seals in the Pavilion this year,
what v. ii 11 some !-!;•> .season ticket holders lo be accounted lor and
aceominodaled. These people oeeupy what are considered by many
as the choice, front row, in-front of the poles seats. And another part
of (he same rumble is the fact that a fSO-eent charge has been placed
on ail home games.
Without taking sides, there are a few facts to he pointed out in
the matter, and ihese I consider important.
Stanford's Assistant Din-dor of Athletics, Chuck Taylor, and Ath
letic Publicity Director Don l.iebendorfer both present the view of
the athletic department in the matter.
Probably the best way lo explain the whole problem, if it is a
problem, is to point out that il costs money to run an athletic show.
And il costs a lot more money than most people probably think il
does. Bnl this may not be reason enough.
1 don't think il is, personally. The most inclusive reason, as this
writer sees it, is none other than the fact that we have what are prob-

ably the lousiest basketball facili
ties anywhere in the United
States. Oh, sure, the court here
is in good condition, but you need
more than a court. There aren't
even too many high schools
around that have less than we do,
and I can think of a couple of
junior highs that have move,
much more.
Perhaps if we had anywhere
near what we should have noth
ing like this would come up.
But that brings lo mind the fact
that a new Pavilion is coming to
Stanford, before some of us here
now are graduated. At least it
looks that way, and won't be too
much longer in coming if it does
n't make it by this prediction.
It's gonna be a big one, too,
with plenty of room for every
body and everything. But that
means money. Plans like those in
the drawers at the BAC are long
range, and include a little bit
more than just the building of a
new pavilion. They have to in-

elude an uipa of how a structure of its intended size will support
itself financially.
Obviously student support alone will not pay for it, not with
■some games going by without charge, and not even at a 50-cent
charge for all of the games.
Never Built Hoop Fans
Liebendorfer points out that Stanford has never built basketball
fans who show up in person, only the radio-TV kind. The reasons
are simple. The facilities at the present Pavilion and the desire to
allow as many Stanford people as possible to attend.
\ But in the new pavilion there'll be plenty of seats for all the Stan
ford people who want to see the Indian cagers, and there'll still be
J;eats to spare. These will have to be full —or as near full as pos
sible to make the ventui'C a success.
And so Stanford has to begin a program of building basketball
fans who will be the pay-up to-watch kind.
As Taylor put it, "We have to get the townspeople into the habit
of buiying season tickets and coining out to watch Stanford basket
ball." But you can't get them to come out when you're not going to
give them something worth while for their money.
Many of these people, Taylor adds, have wanted to be Stanford
fans for a long while, but the old policy was such that they could
never be assured of a seat once they got out here. Often they came
early, stood in line, then got 110 licket,.
And further, Stanford students and faculty have seldom occupied
ALL the seats in the Pavilion. They have for top-rated games, but not
steadily. So il remains that seats were available for a season-ticket
type of program.
A limited number of season tickets were sold this year, and it
turns out that I hey were placed in what can be considered the best
seals in the I'uviliot). It oddly tinned out that these seats held iust
about the right number of people and were the easiest of all seats
in the Pavilion to police. This, perhaps, was unfortunate.
The season-ticket program is common to just about every univer
sity in ihe country; Stanford is probably one ol tho last to adopt it.
The University hasn'l wanted to do il before, but with a new basket
ball courl in view it has become necessary. The real problem, here
again, is the existing inadequate court. Because of this, many Stan
ford studenls will have to strain to look around a few posts here and
there unless they want to pay $1(5.7f> 1o sil down front if any of
the season tickets are still available.
For those who are getting steamed up about the situation, there
are a few other things to be'said, though they might not he concilia
-1 ory.
The first is that Stanford students are treated by their athletic
department as well as or better than most other American college
students. The policy here is to give us the best seats available; wit
ness the 50-yard-line seats in the Stadium. Many student bodies are
put in the end zones, or down around the 20's. This top-notch seat
situation will not change at Stanford, either.
Secondly, in the new pavilion, Stanford students will again get
first choice at the best seats in the house, even though compared to
the present house all seats will be better. The season ticket holders
then will get put where seats are left for them.
Getting pushed out of these front-row seats so that the new court
comes nearer and nearer to reality doesn't seem to be the worst thing
that has ever happened to any of us.
And as Liebendorfer has said, "We've made the promise and we'll
have to live with it —for this season at least."
And about the 50-cent charge for games this year, I'll go back to
the idea thai il costs money to play ball games. No team comes here
for free, and no big team comes here for 1 peanuts, either. The Depart
ment of Athletics doesn't get money from any other source than
spectators, so it's from these that it must seek the support of its
athletic program.
There are two alternatives to the 50-cent charge for all games in
ihis season, and I, for one, don't care for either. One is to charge
more, the other is not to go at all.

The fault is here
