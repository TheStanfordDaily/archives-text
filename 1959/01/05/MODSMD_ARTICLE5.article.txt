# Soviet Rocket Overshoots Moon; Entering Sun Orbit
## Missile Will Become First Artificial Planet 
### 
MOSCOW (A 1 *)—The Soviet Union's cosmic rocket blazed
an ever-lengthening trail into space Sunday and was reported
gradually entering into orbit around the sun, with its radio still
sending scientific information hack to earth.
The latest announcement said the 1 missile was 318,750
miles from the earth at 10 p.m. (EST). As it sped through space
toward the snn. its distance from the moon at that time was
112,500 miles, the broadcast said.
It had overshot the moon at 5:59 a.m. Sunday, approaching
within about 4,700 miles of that satellite.
Tass, official news agency, said the rocket would enter its orbit
around the sun by Jan. 7 or 8 and thus become the first artificial
planet in the sun's system.
As it headed toward the sun, more than 93 million miles from the
earth, Tass said it was gradually entering an elliptical orbit. This
orbit, by Russian estimate, would have a maximum diameter of 214%
Inillion miles and it would take 15 months for the rocket to complete
the circuit.
Tass said the instruments and transmitters continued to function
normally, reporting back data to observation stations in the Soviet
______—— Union.

Contacts to Dim

But these radio contacts grad
ually will worsen because of the
growing distance and the exhaus
tion of the cosmic missile's bat
teries, Tass said, and "in the
course of the next few days will
cease entirely."
Results of observations, both
from ground stations and from
rocket radio transmissions, will
be published as soon as they have
been compiled and correlated by
electronic computers and scien
tists, the agency promised.
The Stanford Research Institute
reported that it recorded signals
from the rocket for over three
hours Saturday starting at 2:20
a.m. The SRI engineers were the
only group in the Bay Area who
were successful in picking up the
signals.
Citizens, in their first enthusi
asm over a Soviet rocket being
fired in the direction of the moon,
had dubbed it "Lunik"—a combi
nation of Sputnik and Luna for
moon. They continued to be in
tensely interested.
There were no further details
on the rocket itself, its launching
site or its power.
Success Definite
Whether or not the Soviet scien
tists actually aimed at the moon
and missed, the whole nation was
applauding an unparalleled suc
cess.
Rocket expert Vladimir Do
bronravov gibed that American
scientists had been unable to over
come the earth's gravity because
not only their rocket engines but
also their control systems were
inferior.
Moscow radio's announcement
of the rocket's passing the moon
was first quoted as saying a tele
scope was aboard and would scan
pock marks on the moon. This
proved to be erroneous.

It had overshot the moon at 5:59 a.m. Sunday, approaching
within about 4,700 miles of that satellite.
Tass, official news agency, said the rocket would enter its orbit
around the sun by Jan. 7 or 8 and thus become the first artificial
planet in the sun's system.
As it headed toward the sun, more than 93 million miles from the
earth, Tass said it was gradually entering an elliptical orbit. This
orbit, by Russian estimate, would have a maximum diameter of 214%
Inillion miles and it would take 15 months for the rocket to complete
the circuit.
Tass said the instruments and transmitters continued to function
normally, reporting back data to observation stations in the Soviet
______—— Union.

Contacts to Dim

But these radio contacts grad
ually will worsen because of the
growing distance and the exhaus
tion of the cosmic missile's bat
teries, Tass said, and "in the
course of the next few days will
cease entirely."
Results of observations, both
from ground stations and from
rocket radio transmissions, will
be published as soon as they have
been compiled and correlated by
electronic computers and scien
tists, the agency promised.
The Stanford Research Institute
reported that it recorded signals
from the rocket for over three
hours Saturday starting at 2:20
a.m. The SRI engineers were the
only group in the Bay Area who
were successful in picking up the
signals.
Citizens, in their first enthusi
asm over a Soviet rocket being
fired in the direction of the moon,
had dubbed it "Lunik"—a combi
nation of Sputnik and Luna for
moon. They continued to be in
tensely interested.
There were no further details
on the rocket itself, its launching
site or its power.
Success Definite
Whether or not the Soviet scien
tists actually aimed at the moon
and missed, the whole nation was
applauding an unparalleled suc
cess.
Rocket expert Vladimir Do
bronravov gibed that American
scientists had been unable to over
come the earth's gravity because
not only their rocket engines but
also their control systems were
inferior.
Moscow radio's announcement
of the rocket's passing the moon
was first quoted as saying a tele
scope was aboard and would scan
pock marks on the moon. This
proved to be erroneous.
MOSCOW (A 1 *)—The Soviet Union's cosmic rocket blazed
an ever-lengthening trail into space Sunday and was reported
gradually entering into orbit around the sun, with its radio still
sending scientific information hack to earth.
The latest announcement said the 1 missile was 318,750
miles from the earth at 10 p.m. (EST). As it sped through space
toward the snn. its distance from the moon at that time was
112,500 miles, the broadcast said.
