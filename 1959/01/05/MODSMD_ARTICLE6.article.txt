# Dull Year? Join Daily
## 
### 
Are you afraid that the tradi
tionally "dead" winter quarter
is going to be too dull for you?
Have you suddenly discov
ered that you have spare time
on your hands?
Do you need activity credit
and you don't know what to do?
The Daily can use you.
Reporters, desk workers, pho
tographers, feature and sports
writers and general office work
ers are needed. No experience
is necessary.
When the staff works it
sometimes works hard. But
parties and impromptu get-to
gethers are also a big part of
Daily life.
An open staff meeting will be
held Sunday at 2 p.m. for old
and new staff members and
those just interested^
Come over any time â€”the red
door on our little shack is al
ways open.
