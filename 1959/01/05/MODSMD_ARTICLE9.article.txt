# New 49-Star Flag Unfurled
## 
### 
President Eisenhower proclaimed statehood for
Alaska Friday and then unfurled the new U.S.
flag of 1.3 stripes and 49 stars. The new flag
will become official next July 4, and will have

seven staggered rows of seven stars each. The
present flag has six rows of eight stars each.
Except, for the change in the stars, the propor
tions of the overall flag remain the same.
