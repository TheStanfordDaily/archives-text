# Winter Registration Lags
## 
### 
Nearly 7400 students registered yester
day at Memorial Auditorium and the Pa
vilion, 273 less than last winter quarter's
first-day registration.
Only 5549 men and 1828 women took part
in Monday's simplified registration experi
ment. For the first Ime, the traditional reg
istration book was replaced by a single IBM
card on which students put all registration
information. Parts of the cards will be
microfilmed and sent to various depart
ments.
Students reported that the simplified reg
istration saved 10 to 15 minutes, and the
only bottlenecks in registration Monday
were caused by the tuition lines and by the

first Registration Day rain in eight years.
Late registration begins today and stu
dents completing registration between to
day and 5 p.m. Monday will pay $2 late
registration fees. Students completing reg
istration after Monday must pay $10 late
registration fees, according to Registrar
Harvey Hall.
Study lists and class cards may be turned
in without fine to the Registrar's Office,
Room 111-A, Inner Quad, daily between 8
a.m. and noon and between 1 and 5 p.m.
