WASHINGTON (/P)â€”First. Dep
uty Soviet Premier An;\stas I. Mi
koyan anri Secretary of State Dul
les cautiously probed Sunday for
a way out of the critical East-
West deadlock over Berlin's fu
ture.
The two men were reported to
have talked over the Berlin prob
lem in detail during a 95-minute
meeting at the State Department.
Both drew tight secrecy cur
tains around their talk. However,
one informant reported that Ber
lin dominated the discussion,
which ranged over the German
problem as a whole, disarmament
and trade prospects.
This informant said the Krem

slant on the Soviet threat to turn
East Berlin over to the East Ger
mans.
The fast-talking Mikoyan fol
lowed up his visit with Dulles by
meeting for 90 minutes with
Senator Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.). Hump hr ey reviewed
world problems with Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev at Mos
cow last month in eight hours of
talk.
