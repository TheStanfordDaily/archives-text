# Sharp Lookout
## 
### 
The United States has a visitor —a rather distinguished one, at
that. He is Anastas I. Mikoyan, hilled as Russia s No. 2 man.
Mikoyan is presumably here on vacation —hut it will he quite
a trick to find someone wlio really helieves this. From the Hun
garian refugees, who are loudly declaring their hatred ol the
Soviet official, to the top administrative officers in W ashington, all
are sure it is another Russian propaganda maneuver.
And certainly there is reason to suspect motives other than
purely "touristica!" in Mikoyan's visit. It is a rare high govern
ment official who can take a vacation for the pleasure of it. Even
Eisenhower's golfing and fishing sojourns involve protocol, poli
tics and problems.
Mikoyan is coyly sidestepping newsmen s queries as
to his purpose in visiting the United States. It hen asked
about a meeting with Ike he says,"It would he a pleasure
to see him." He has no particular problem on his mind,
hut would be r*'ady and nulling to talk about any hast-
West problem during his two-week stay.
Perhaps the First Deputy Premier is attempting to build sus
pense —as a tactical move in the Cold War. (.ertainly the curiosity
of the nation is aroused by his silence on such subjects, and it is
hard to believe he is here merely to gawk and gaze at the sights,
such as the doughnut-making machine a recent news picture of
him showed. He would have us believe him to be a backwoods
visitor, thrilled by the modern conveniences and inventions of
city life.
Mikoyan is not the jolly simpleton with no "particu
lar problems" \chicli he seems to want to appear. Maybe
he will sit down at a conference table with Dulles or
Eisenhower, maybe he. will not. Hut our guess is that
his feelers are out with sharp sensitivity. He will be
gathering bits of useful information about the American
nay of thinking throughout his stay.
Though we sympathize with the Hungarians who are shouting,
"Murderer, go home!" wed rather let him have his ""vacation
here and keep our antennas just as sensitive as his.

city life.
Mikoyan is not the jolly simpleton with no "particu
lar problems" \chicli he seems to want to appear. Maybe
he will sit down at a conference table with Dulles or
Eisenhower, maybe he. will not. Hut our guess is that
his feelers are out with sharp sensitivity. He will be
gathering bits of useful information about the American
nay of thinking throughout his stay.
Though we sympathize with the Hungarians who are shouting,
"Murderer, go home!" wed rather let him have his ""vacation
here and keep our antennas just as sensitive as his.
The United States has a visitor —a rather distinguished one, at
that. He is Anastas I. Mikoyan, hilled as Russia s No. 2 man.
Mikoyan is presumably here on vacation —hut it will he quite
a trick to find someone wlio really helieves this. From the Hun
garian refugees, who are loudly declaring their hatred ol the
Soviet official, to the top administrative officers in W ashington, all
are sure it is another Russian propaganda maneuver.
And certainly there is reason to suspect motives other than
purely "touristica!" in Mikoyan's visit. It is a rare high govern
ment official who can take a vacation for the pleasure of it. Even
Eisenhower's golfing and fishing sojourns involve protocol, poli
tics and problems.
Mikoyan is coyly sidestepping newsmen s queries as
to his purpose in visiting the United States. It hen asked
about a meeting with Ike he says,"It would he a pleasure
to see him." He has no particular problem on his mind,
hut would be r*'ady and nulling to talk about any hast-
West problem during his two-week stay.
Perhaps the First Deputy Premier is attempting to build sus
pense —as a tactical move in the Cold War. (.ertainly the curiosity
of the nation is aroused by his silence on such subjects, and it is
hard to believe he is here merely to gawk and gaze at the sights,
such as the doughnut-making machine a recent news picture of
him showed. He would have us believe him to be a backwoods
visitor, thrilled by the modern conveniences and inventions of
city life.
