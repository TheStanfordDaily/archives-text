# 'I CENTER'
## Foreign Students Given Foothold 
### Bob Montgomery 
"Our home away from home"
is the way visiting foreign stu
dents describe Stanford's Inter
national Center, which occupies
the Rev. Robert Minto's former
home at 539 Lasuen near the Post
Office and has been in operation
for over a year.
The aging, white frame house
has become the Stanford head
quarters of 435 foreign scholars
from 65 countries. While contin
uing their education in the United
States, these students from
Ryukyus, Ghana, Canada, Japan
and numerous other far away
places with strange sounding
names find that the I-center gives
them a foothold in their new,
confusing Stanford world.
"These newcomers need a place
that they can call their own. Their
first feeling upon arrival is that
of being a guest, a bystander,"
notes Werner Warmbrunn, For
eign Student Adviser. "The Cen
ter also gives American students
a place where they can meet for
eign students and exchange ideas
and information."
3;)00 Visitors
A great deal of organization is
necessary to run the Center
which now receives over 3500
students and distinguished visi
tors from abroad each year.
Mrs. Inez Richardson, coordin
ator of the office for Foreign
Visitors, and Werner Warmbrunn
function as executive officers
who are attached to the Univer
sity.
The Community Committee,
which is made up of interested
residents of the Palo Alto area,
serves as hostess each day. The
Faculty Committee on Foreign
Students and Vistiors headed by
Carl B. Spaeth, Dean of the Law
School, gives the assistance of the
faculty.
Hostess Journal
A journal that is kept by the
hostess is perhaps most illustra
tive of the true feeling which sur
rounds the Center. A staff mem
ber writes, "Three French boys
came into the Center in a delight

fully gay and happy mood. They
helped me in the kitchen with the
dishes and then adjourned to the
lounge to play the piano and sing
nursery rhymes and songs of
their youths with each adding his
musical version. As I left, their
spontaneous energies had turned
to tumbling and Judo demonstra
tions on the floor. They were so
happy to have a place to express
their exuberance and felt as
though they were in their own
home."
Activities Many
A myriad of activities keep the
Center buzzing at all times. Sing
ing, games, music, conversation,
and dancing dominate the Satur
day Night Fireside sessions which
begin at 8 p. m. "The biggest ob
stacle which the Center has to
overcome to become a complete
success," Warmbrunn said, "is
the feeling among the American
students that the Center is only
for foreigners."
During the three long holiday
periods at Thanksgiving, Christ
mas, and Spring Vacation the
I-Center performs one of its most
valuable functions. Foreign stu
dents, who would ordinarly have
to remain on a deserted campus,
may go off to see more of Amer
ica and Mexico. These trips take
in Ensenada in Baja California,
Mexico, the Monterey- Big Sur
Area, and the Southwestern
United States.
Misconceptions
Through misconceptions of the
I-Center's place in the life of Stan
ford University, explained Warm
brunn, many students take them
selves out of the running and pass
up the numerous possibilities for
making friends for themselves
and the United States.
The foreign scholars at Stan
ford are the future leaders of
their countries, he continued, and
their understanding and friend
ship toward the people and gov
eminent of our country could
make a big difference in the fu
ture of the entire world.
"The International Center is
for everyone. It is truly a center
for the internationally minded."
