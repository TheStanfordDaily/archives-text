# URRUTIA
## Martial Law Called Off In Havana 
### 
HAVANA, Cuba (/P) —- Provi
sional President Manuel Urrutia
took over the presidential palace
in the heart of Havana Monday
night and immediately called off
an order putting Havana province
under martial law.
Urrutia said the earlier procla
mation by military commanders
was not necessary.
Major Camilo Cienfuegos, the
provisional government's army
and navy chief for Havana prov
ince, had set a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
curfew for Havana before Urrutia
acted.
The curfew and martial law
proclamation appeared to be con
nected with a dispute with young
revolutionary zealots over posses
sion of the presidential palace it
self. Cienfuegos had said his
orders would stand until Urrutia
occupied the palace.
For a time a dangerous split
seemed to be developing between
Fidel Castro's 26th of July Move-

merit and young students of the
Directorio Revolucionario, but
they talked it out.
With Urrutia's arrival, hopes
were raised for a quick return to
normal and the restoration of
firm governmental authority.
The provisional government on
Sunday ordered the end of the
general strike that went into ef
fect last Thursday, and Havana
began returning to something like
normal after five hectic and dan
gerous days.
Stores Reopened
Food stores and shops re
opened, relieving the shortage of
food and necessities, newspapers
reappeared, wine shops again did
business, and taxis again were
available.
Pan American Would Airways
and National Airlines resumed
flights to and from Havana Mon
day.
Service had boon canceled since
New Year's Day when rioting
swept the Cuban capital on the
heels of the overthrow of Presi
dent Fulgencio Batista.
Cubana Airlines, the other lead
ing scheduled Miami-Havana air
carrier, resumed flights Saturday.

TORONTO (/P) — Fidel Cas
tro's rebels, control Cuba now,
but not lons ago they were
hula-hooping' in the hills. Eric
Durschmiet, a Canadian free
lance photographer who spent
six weeks taking pictures of the
rebels, said they captured a ship
with a cargo of hula hoops and
the fad spread like wildfire.

TORONTO (/P) — Fidel Cas
tro's rebels, control Cuba now,
but not lons ago they were
hula-hooping' in the hills. Eric
Durschmiet, a Canadian free
lance photographer who spent
six weeks taking pictures of the

with a cargo of hula hoops and
the fad spread like wildfire.
HAVANA, Cuba (/P) —- Provi
sional President Manuel Urrutia
took over the presidential palace
in the heart of Havana Monday
night and immediately called off
an order putting Havana province
under martial law.
Urrutia said the earlier procla
mation by military commanders
was not necessary.
Major Camilo Cienfuegos, the
provisional government's army
and navy chief for Havana prov
ince, had set a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
curfew for Havana before Urrutia
acted.
The curfew and martial law
proclamation appeared to be con
nected with a dispute with young
revolutionary zealots over posses
sion of the presidential palace it
self. Cienfuegos had said his
orders would stand until Urrutia
occupied the palace.
For a time a dangerous split
seemed to be developing between
Fidel Castro's 26th of July Move-

merit and young students of the
Directorio Revolucionario, but
they talked it out.
