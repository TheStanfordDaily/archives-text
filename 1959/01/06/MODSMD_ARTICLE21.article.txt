## Anouilh Play Tells Conflicts of Love 
### A Review By Jerome Clinton 
The Cry of the Peacock, Jean
Anouilh, appearing weekends at
the Playhouse.
Anouilh's "Cry of the Peacock,"
subtitled an "outrage," is a neatly
written drama which centers its
concern on the inevitable conflict,
in love, between the mindless
cravings of lust and the ethereal
delights of "pure" affection. The
play is set in the pre-World War I
household of General ( St. Pe, a
man of considerable social stand
ing, and the players all represent
members of his immediate fam
ily, their friends, servants and
lovers.
The family grotesque, a middle
aged hunchback, who had up to
now exercised her discretion in
living as a recluse, has presump
tuously fallen in love with her
tutor, also a hunchback. The Gen
eral has called the family to
gether so that they may work out
some means of destroying this ro
mance, the scandal of which, once
known, would make them the
laughing stock of Parisian soci
ety.
Fascinated by the prospect of
two such creatures in love, and
impelled by their fear of scandal,
each of the characters reveals the
ugliness of his own love affairs
and he desperately tries to con
vince her to give up her own.
And their combined revelations
provide a complete and bitterly
devastating view of the inevi
table decay and disappointment

to which even the freshest ro
mance is subject. Lust must feed
on youth and beauty, once they
are gone, its unrequited demands
rob intimacy of its delight, leav
ing only inertia and ennui to hold
lovers together.
The revelations of the General
and his contemporaries are more
poignant on the one hand because
they are acted out before the Gen
eral's newly-matured son and his
sweetheart — who are forced to
accept this bitter lesson and on
the other because they are bru
tally parodied in the knowing pre
cocity of his youngest son.
The Playhouse company per
forms this work with commend
able vitality, bringing out the
amused self-contempt which sus
tains these people in an all but
impossible situation. As the un
faithful husband of the General's
sister, himself a cuckold, says,
"It's a good thing we can laugh
at ourselves; otherwise we would
be unbearable."
Dion Chesse, Jane Stackle and
Leon Roegiers give fine perform
ances as the three principal char
acters, the General, his sister and
her husband, and are generally
well supported in the minor roles.

The Cry of the Peacock, Jean
Anouilh, appearing weekends at
the Playhouse.
Anouilh's "Cry of the Peacock,"
subtitled an "outrage," is a neatly
written drama which centers its
concern on the inevitable conflict,
in love, between the mindless
cravings of lust and the ethereal
delights of "pure" affection. The
play is set in the pre-World War I
household of General ( St. Pe, a
man of considerable social stand
ing, and the players all represent
members of his immediate fam
ily, their friends, servants and
lovers.
The family grotesque, a middle
aged hunchback, who had up to
now exercised her discretion in
living as a recluse, has presump
tuously fallen in love with her
tutor, also a hunchback. The Gen
eral has called the family to
gether so that they may work out
some means of destroying this ro
mance, the scandal of which, once
known, would make them the
laughing stock of Parisian soci
ety.
Fascinated by the prospect of
two such creatures in love, and
impelled by their fear of scandal,
each of the characters reveals the
ugliness of his own love affairs
and he desperately tries to con
vince her to give up her own.
And their combined revelations
provide a complete and bitterly
devastating view of the inevi
table decay and disappointment

to which even the freshest ro
mance is subject. Lust must feed
on youth and beauty, once they
are gone, its unrequited demands
rob intimacy of its delight, leav
ing only inertia and ennui to hold
lovers together.
The revelations of the General
and his contemporaries are more
poignant on the one hand because
they are acted out before the Gen
eral's newly-matured son and his
sweetheart — who are forced to
accept this bitter lesson and on
the other because they are bru
tally parodied in the knowing pre
cocity of his youngest son.
