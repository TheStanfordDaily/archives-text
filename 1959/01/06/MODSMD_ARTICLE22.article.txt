By Sen. John F. Kennedy
IT ill ten for the Associated I'ress
WASHINGTON (/P) -The Dem
ocratic 86th Congress promises
to be an historic one.
It will be successful only if it
can cope with the many pressing
foreign and domestic problems
now crying out for thoughtful,
responsible legislative leadership.
I have prepared a summary of
the issues which might claim the
attention of the incoming Con
gress.
Only a few can be briefly men
toned in this space, but unfortu
nately there are no short and
easy answers for our loss of pres
tige abroad, our battle for the
minds of uncommitted nations,
our weakening alliances. There
are no panaceas for our stagger
ing military budgets, our infla
tionary perils, our increasing cost
of living, our chronic unemploy
ment areas, our inadequate hous
ing, the distress of the family
farmer.
Need Record
We cannot end with mere
words or wishing continued dis
crimination on account of race,
the gradual depletion of our nat
ural resources, or our critical
shortage of scientists, engineers
and educational facilities. So
much needs to be done that this
Congress—and the nation can
not affoi (1 less than a truly not
able record of achievement.
FOREIGN POLICY AND DE

FENSE. Thesp issue.*?, in our life 1
time, must remain paramount,
The year 1959 is a time for re
appraisal of our basic policies to
ward Latin America, India, our
allies and uncommitted nations of
the world.
India, which has within its
boundaries 40 per cent of the un
committed people of the world
and is the showcase of the dem
ocratic "experiment" in Asia,
grows more important as China
moves ahead. Congress must pass
a loan and aid program which
will prevent it from failing in its
program to achieve self-suffi
ciency under its second five-year
plan.
Reformulation
We must reformulate our aid
programs to meet the urgent
needs of underdeveloped count
ries suffering from overpopula
tion and capital starvation. We
should shift the balance as be
tween aid for military and de
fense support purposes and aid
for economic growth.
As weapons and defense sys
tems become obsolete they must
be discarded, regardless of the
cost they initially represented.
New missiles and weapons nu
clear-powered aircraft and space
vehicles operated from moving,
concealed or submerged bases
must replace less cost but more
vulnerable weapons and their de
velopment must be accelerated.
The emphasis should not be on
the armament we can afford but
on the striking power we cannot
afford to lack.
Three Changes
LABOR. Three major changes
in our labor laws are in prospect.
First, this country needs an ef
fective labor-management reform
law. The partisanship which kill
ed the Kennedy-Ives bill in the
House last summer after it had
passed the Senate 88-1 will not
again be permitted to block this
urgently needed legislation. De
spite Ihe political perils, heated
emotions and powerful pressures
which surround this subject, I be
lieve an effective bipartisan labor
management reform bill will pass
both houses of Congress and be
come law in 1959—t0 the dismay
of the Hoffas, the Sheffermans,
and their hoodlum associates.
Second we need to enact a law
establishing nationwide minimum
standards of unemployment com
pensation. The experience of the
1957-1958 recession has demon
strated the need for such stand
ards. An adequate program ser
ves to cushion a recession, allevi

ates individual hardship, and
speeds the national recovery.
Third, we need an amendment
to the Fair Labor Standards Act
increasing minimum wages and
extending the coverage of the act.
Amend Rule
CIVIL RIGHTS. The initial ef
fort in the Senate in 1959 will be
a preliminary skirmish in which
liberal forces of both parties will
seek to amend Senate Rule 22, the
rule permitting legislation to be
filibustered to death. I am confi
dent there will be an effective re
vision of this rule, denying to the
Senate neither the opportunity
for a final vote.
DOMESTIC ECONOMIC
PROBLEMS. The fears of a de
pression have been replaced to a
great extent by concern over in
flation and the rising cost of liv
ing. Since the end of World War
11, the cost of living has increased
by 62 per cent; and there are
signs that the economy has paus
ed just long enough to try an
other dizzy rate.
Foreign c on 112 i d en e e in the
American dollar, our trademark
of stability and an important aid
in our economic battle with the
Soviet Union, depends upon res
oonsible control over governmen
tal fiscal policies. This will be
done in the Congress by imple
mentation of the Kennedy-Byrd-
Fayne budget and accounting bill;
it can be done in the executive
departments by an advisory
i council of the fiscal officers of
the government committing
themselves to that course of act
ion dictated by the needs of the
economy.
There are, of course, many oth
er important legislative challen
ges. For instance, Hawaii will al
most certainly become our 50th
state; it is important to extend
the Airport Construction Act if
we are to meet the challenges of
the jet age; the Defense Educa
tion Act of 1958 should be amend
ed to provide college scholarships
for talented young men and wo
men the Soviet budget has doub
led its provision for scientists;
and there is urgent need for a
housing bill, including an urban
renewal program for our metro
politan areas.
Each of these items will call
for imagination, ingenuity, and
dedication. I am sure that the
Congress will be equal to the de
mands of Ihe program.
