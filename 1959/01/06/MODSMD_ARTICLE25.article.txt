# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
What We Hope the Stockings Held
A BELATED HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL—plus a hope that it'll
be a Happy New Year in Stanford sports all through 1959. We didn't
have time to look through all the Stanford Christmas stockings come
last December 25, but we hope they were full of what everyone was
looking for. In particular, we'd be happy if we could lake a belated
look in some stockings and see:
In Howie Dallmar's, a contract with his basketball team calling
for a guaranteed minimum shooting average of 40 per cent. From
the looks of things so far this season, this is what the Indians need
to win. They get it pretty often, so they win—but a few more de
bacles like the 25 per cent showing against Idaho and it'll be a long,
dark winter in the local pavilion.
In I'ayton .lonian's, a hurdler, a high-jumper, a discus thrower
and a javelin thrower to (ill out the question-mark spots in this
spring's track team.
In Jack Curtice's, a line to help make his passing attack work.
Norman will never be able to throw to Bnrford come next fall if he's

flat on his back under enemy line
men and the Indians will need
line depth to hold out the opposi
tion forces.
In Dutch Fering's, a few fans to
watch his Card baseballers. They
have been playing good, ball for
several years now, but seldom
drawing beyond a small nucleus
of diehard fans. With most of
last year's club back and the
heart of IJSC's championship
team gone to the pro ranks, the
Indians should do OK for them
selves. And it'd be nice if a few
more people were around to
watch them win.
In Al Masters' and ( buck Tay
lor's, a well-rounded set of sched
ules in all sports for the next few
years so that Stanford won't be
forced to join the AAWU in order
to get games and meets. Sure,
we want to keep playing USC and
IJCLA and California — but that
doesn't mean we'd like to see
Stanford in a league with them.

In thp Stanford treasury's, cash
enough to pot work started on the new pavilion, with enough leit over
for full development of the front-campus athletic fields and grounds
program.
And finally, in the stockings of all the Stanford outdoor coaches
and athletes, enough pull with the weatherman to keep the winter
workout sessions from being completely washed out -like the golf
course was for part of last winter.
Busier Longer Than Most
A couple of Indian footballers, Troy Barbee and Roeh Conklin,
managed to keep busy with the gridiron sport long after most of
their teammates had hung up their cleats for the year. Barbee and
Conklin each saw plenty of playing time for Jack Curtice's West team
in the San Francisco Shrine game.
Conklin handled the offensive center chores, and Barbee operated
at offensive tackle. He was forced to also go on defense when an
other West tackle went out on injuries. It was surprising that the
West stayed in the game as long as it did—the locals were in con
tention until Leon Burton's fumble of a punt midway in the fourth
period allowed the East to take a two-touchdown lead. Have to give
Curtice some credit for keeping his team as close as it stayed when
the East obviously had far superior material.
The '58 edition of the Shrine game helped again to prove that it
takds a Stanford quarterback for the West to win. In '53, Bobby Gar
rett did the job. If was John Brodie in '5G and Jackie Douglas in '57
as the Indians furnished a field general to the Westerners who, in
each case, led their team to victory. But in recent games where Stan
ford hasn't furnished the quarterback, the East wins.
Looks like the Western selection board might just as well take
steps right now to line up Sid Garber for 1959 and Dick Norman for

1960 if it wants the West to come
out on top.
A CRUSHING BLOW — Stan
ford basketball fans have been
deprived of what would have been
the year's biggest chance to "get
on" an opponent. Unfortunately
for the local spectator roughs,
Denny Miller has quit (he UCI-A
team. Fans who went to the Cow
Palace in December will remem
ber Miller as the muscular, long
haired Bruin guard who cast off
two-hand set shots from 40 feet
with surprising regularity. Even
at the Cow Palace, Stanfordites
were continually urging Miller to
"Shoot, shoot." Or when the not
much-finesse Miller was closely
guarding an opponent, there was
the cry to "Knife 'em, Denny."
The thing is, Miller looked as if
he'd probably ridden to the game
on his motorcycle. But what
happened is that MOM, who has
the 24-year-old ex-Bruin under a
movie contract, said he couldn't
make the road trips—held up pro-

duction too much. So Denny had to give up basketball, and now the
Pavilion wolves will have to find another victim. It's really too bad
Denny would h;ive been such a natural.

In Howie Dallmar's, a contract with his basketball team calling
for a guaranteed minimum shooting average of 40 per cent. From
the looks of things so far this season, this is what the Indians need
to win. They get it pretty often, so they win—but a few more de
bacles like the 25 per cent showing against Idaho and it'll be a long,
dark winter in the local pavilion.
In I'ayton .lonian's, a hurdler, a high-jumper, a discus thrower
and a javelin thrower to (ill out the question-mark spots in this
spring's track team.
In Jack Curtice's, a line to help make his passing attack work.
Norman will never be able to throw to Bnrford come next fall if he's

flat on his back under enemy line
men and the Indians will need
line depth to hold out the opposi
tion forces.
In Dutch Fering's, a few fans to
watch his Card baseballers. They
have been playing good, ball for
several years now, but seldom
drawing beyond a small nucleus
of diehard fans. With most of
last year's club back and the
heart of IJSC's championship
team gone to the pro ranks, the
Indians should do OK for them
selves. And it'd be nice if a few
more people were around to
watch them win.
In Al Masters' and ( buck Tay
lor's, a well-rounded set of sched
ules in all sports for the next few
years so that Stanford won't be
forced to join the AAWU in order
to get games and meets. Sure,
we want to keep playing USC and
IJCLA and California — but that
doesn't mean we'd like to see
Stanford in a league with them.

In thp Stanford treasury's, cash
enough to pot work started on the new pavilion, with enough leit over
for full development of the front-campus athletic fields and grounds
program.
And finally, in the stockings of all the Stanford outdoor coaches
and athletes, enough pull with the weatherman to keep the winter
workout sessions from being completely washed out -like the golf
course was for part of last winter.
Busier Longer Than Most
A couple of Indian footballers, Troy Barbee and Roeh Conklin,
managed to keep busy with the gridiron sport long after most of
their teammates had hung up their cleats for the year. Barbee and
Conklin each saw plenty of playing time for Jack Curtice's West team
in the San Francisco Shrine game.
Conklin handled the offensive center chores, and Barbee operated
at offensive tackle. He was forced to also go on defense when an
other West tackle went out on injuries. It was surprising that the
West stayed in the game as long as it did—the locals were in con
tention until Leon Burton's fumble of a punt midway in the fourth
period allowed the East to take a two-touchdown lead. Have to give
Curtice some credit for keeping his team as close as it stayed when
the East obviously had far superior material.
The '58 edition of the Shrine game helped again to prove that it
takds a Stanford quarterback for the West to win. In '53, Bobby Gar
rett did the job. If was John Brodie in '5G and Jackie Douglas in '57
as the Indians furnished a field general to the Westerners who, in
each case, led their team to victory. But in recent games where Stan
ford hasn't furnished the quarterback, the East wins.
Looks like the Western selection board might just as well take
steps right now to line up Sid Garber for 1959 and Dick Norman for

1960 if it wants the West to come
out on top.
A CRUSHING BLOW — Stan
ford basketball fans have been
deprived of what would have been
the year's biggest chance to "get
on" an opponent. Unfortunately
for the local spectator roughs,
Denny Miller has quit (he UCI-A
team. Fans who went to the Cow
Palace in December will remem
ber Miller as the muscular, long
haired Bruin guard who cast off
two-hand set shots from 40 feet
with surprising regularity. Even
at the Cow Palace, Stanfordites
were continually urging Miller to
"Shoot, shoot." Or when the not
much-finesse Miller was closely
guarding an opponent, there was
the cry to "Knife 'em, Denny."
The thing is, Miller looked as if
he'd probably ridden to the game
on his motorcycle. But what
happened is that MOM, who has
the 24-year-old ex-Bruin under a
movie contract, said he couldn't
make the road trips—held up pro-

duction too much. So Denny had to give up basketball, and now the
Pavilion wolves will have to find another victim. It's really too bad
Denny would h;ive been such a natural.

dark winter in the local pavilion.
In I'ayton .lonian's, a hurdler, a high-jumper, a discus thrower
and a javelin thrower to (ill out the question-mark spots in this
spring's track team.
In Jack Curtice's, a line to help make his passing attack work.
Norman will never be able to throw to Bnrford come next fall if he's

flat on his back under enemy line
men and the Indians will need
line depth to hold out the opposi
tion forces.
In Dutch Fering's, a few fans to
watch his Card baseballers. They
have been playing good, ball for
several years now, but seldom
drawing beyond a small nucleus
of diehard fans. With most of
last year's club back and the
heart of IJSC's championship
team gone to the pro ranks, the
Indians should do OK for them
selves. And it'd be nice if a few
more people were around to
watch them win.
In Al Masters' and ( buck Tay
lor's, a well-rounded set of sched
ules in all sports for the next few
years so that Stanford won't be
forced to join the AAWU in order
to get games and meets. Sure,
we want to keep playing USC and
IJCLA and California — but that
doesn't mean we'd like to see
Stanford in a league with them.

In thp Stanford treasury's, cash
enough to pot work started on the new pavilion, with enough leit over
for full development of the front-campus athletic fields and grounds
program.
And finally, in the stockings of all the Stanford outdoor coaches
and athletes, enough pull with the weatherman to keep the winter
workout sessions from being completely washed out -like the golf
course was for part of last winter.
Busier Longer Than Most
A couple of Indian footballers, Troy Barbee and Roeh Conklin,
managed to keep busy with the gridiron sport long after most of
their teammates had hung up their cleats for the year. Barbee and
Conklin each saw plenty of playing time for Jack Curtice's West team
in the San Francisco Shrine game.
Conklin handled the offensive center chores, and Barbee operated
at offensive tackle. He was forced to also go on defense when an
other West tackle went out on injuries. It was surprising that the
West stayed in the game as long as it did—the locals were in con
tention until Leon Burton's fumble of a punt midway in the fourth
period allowed the East to take a two-touchdown lead. Have to give
Curtice some credit for keeping his team as close as it stayed when
the East obviously had far superior material.
The '58 edition of the Shrine game helped again to prove that it
takds a Stanford quarterback for the West to win. In '53, Bobby Gar
rett did the job. If was John Brodie in '5G and Jackie Douglas in '57
as the Indians furnished a field general to the Westerners who, in
each case, led their team to victory. But in recent games where Stan
ford hasn't furnished the quarterback, the East wins.
Looks like the Western selection board might just as well take
steps right now to line up Sid Garber for 1959 and Dick Norman for

1960 if it wants the West to come
out on top.
A CRUSHING BLOW — Stan
ford basketball fans have been
deprived of what would have been
the year's biggest chance to "get
on" an opponent. Unfortunately
for the local spectator roughs,
Denny Miller has quit (he UCI-A
team. Fans who went to the Cow
Palace in December will remem
ber Miller as the muscular, long
haired Bruin guard who cast off
two-hand set shots from 40 feet
with surprising regularity. Even
at the Cow Palace, Stanfordites
were continually urging Miller to
"Shoot, shoot." Or when the not
much-finesse Miller was closely
guarding an opponent, there was
the cry to "Knife 'em, Denny."
The thing is, Miller looked as if
he'd probably ridden to the game
on his motorcycle. But what
happened is that MOM, who has
the 24-year-old ex-Bruin under a
movie contract, said he couldn't
make the road trips—held up pro-

duction too much. So Denny had to give up basketball, and now the
Pavilion wolves will have to find another victim. It's really too bad
Denny would h;ive been such a natural.

What We Hope the Stockings Held
A BELATED HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL—plus a hope that it'll
be a Happy New Year in Stanford sports all through 1959. We didn't
have time to look through all the Stanford Christmas stockings come
last December 25, but we hope they were full of what everyone was
looking for. In particular, we'd be happy if we could lake a belated
look in some stockings and see:
In Howie Dallmar's, a contract with his basketball team calling
for a guaranteed minimum shooting average of 40 per cent. From
the looks of things so far this season, this is what the Indians need
to win. They get it pretty often, so they win—but a few more de
bacles like the 25 per cent showing against Idaho and it'll be a long,
