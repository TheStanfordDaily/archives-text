# Stanford Doesn't Rebound; Loses to Beavers, 68-56
## 
### 
Despite co-captain Paul Neu
i mann's 26-point effort, Stanford's
Indians couldn't get into the
game last night and dropped a
68-56 contest to Oregon State's
determined Beavers.
The Indians were no less than
j miserable on I he backboards, and
pretty much gave up tlie ball as
| often as ihtey shot. Always will
ing to take over, the Beavers did
iust that and. paced by guard Jim
Woodland's 20 points, Ihey roast
ed home with little trouble.
After a close first half which
saw the score tied three times,
and finally break in the Beavers'
favor, 29 27, Oregon State got hot
and pulled away to a 10 point lead
before live minutes of the second
stanza was gone.
Flynn Stars
Forward Steve Flynn paced the
Beaver drive, hitting on four
quick field shots in five tries.
Once they got the 10-point mar
gin the Beavers were off and run
ning. Stanford tried, but couldn't
match the team play which the
Beavers put out.
The locals got no closer 1o the
Orange and Black than seven
markers, a gap they saw twice in
the closing minutes, the last time
with just under four minutes to
go. /
But every time Ihe Cards moved
i to score and close the gap, the
; Stanfords fouled and lost the ad
j vantage. The score-then foul pro
cedure occurred no less than on
the Indians' last seven baskets.
The loss was the Indians' sec
ond Conference setback; they
! have one win, scored over Wash
ington State in the Conference
opener.
Hi in Second Hull'
Neumann was ihe oidy man to
keep the Indians' chances alive in
the second frame. His 16-point
second half, coming on the
strength of the driving lay-ins he
has used so effectively on this
Northwest swing, was three
counters better than the total
scored by ihe rest of his squad.
Center Dick Haga, who scored
IS counters for the night, added
eight of these in the second frame.
But the Indians missed chances
at the free throw line and off the
backboards and this is where the
story was told.
Stanford jumped off to a quick
two-point lead when Haga sank a
two-handed jump shot from 18
feet out, but the Beavers came
back to tie it up when guard Lee
Harman sank two foul shots.
Woodland then hit a 10-footer to
send them ahead and the best the
Indians could do from there on
was to tie the game.
Harman was the second high
man for Oregon State with 15
points before he fouled out to
ward the end of the contest.
Man-to-Man
Stanford played a tight defen
sive game in the first half, press
ing the Beavers with a man-to

man defense, but couldn't hold the
home squad away from the bas
ket once the second half began.
Along with their inability to
pull off the key rebounds, the In
dians had shooting trouble in the
initial stanza. Most of this troub
le was in getting shots off. But
the defensively determined Bea
vers saw to it that they didn't get
many shots.

Despite co-captain Paul Neu
i mann's 26-point effort, Stanford's
Indians couldn't get into the
game last night and dropped a
68-56 contest to Oregon State's
determined Beavers.
The Indians were no less than
j miserable on I he backboards, and
pretty much gave up tlie ball as
| often as ihtey shot. Always will
ing to take over, the Beavers did
iust that and. paced by guard Jim
Woodland's 20 points, Ihey roast
ed home with little trouble.
After a close first half which
saw the score tied three times,
and finally break in the Beavers'
favor, 29 27, Oregon State got hot
and pulled away to a 10 point lead
before live minutes of the second
stanza was gone.
Flynn Stars
Forward Steve Flynn paced the
Beaver drive, hitting on four
quick field shots in five tries.
Once they got the 10-point mar
gin the Beavers were off and run
ning. Stanford tried, but couldn't
match the team play which the
Beavers put out.
The locals got no closer 1o the
Orange and Black than seven
markers, a gap they saw twice in
the closing minutes, the last time
with just under four minutes to
go. /
But every time Ihe Cards moved
i to score and close the gap, the
; Stanfords fouled and lost the ad
j vantage. The score-then foul pro
cedure occurred no less than on
the Indians' last seven baskets.
The loss was the Indians' sec
ond Conference setback; they
! have one win, scored over Wash
ington State in the Conference
opener.
Hi in Second Hull'
Neumann was ihe oidy man to
keep the Indians' chances alive in
the second frame. His 16-point
second half, coming on the
strength of the driving lay-ins he
has used so effectively on this
Northwest swing, was three
counters better than the total
scored by ihe rest of his squad.
Center Dick Haga, who scored
IS counters for the night, added
eight of these in the second frame.
But the Indians missed chances
at the free throw line and off the
backboards and this is where the
story was told.
Stanford jumped off to a quick
two-point lead when Haga sank a
two-handed jump shot from 18
feet out, but the Beavers came
back to tie it up when guard Lee
Harman sank two foul shots.
Woodland then hit a 10-footer to
send them ahead and the best the
Indians could do from there on
was to tie the game.
Harman was the second high
man for Oregon State with 15
points before he fouled out to
ward the end of the contest.
Man-to-Man
Stanford played a tight defen
sive game in the first half, press
ing the Beavers with a man-to

man defense, but couldn't hold the
home squad away from the bas
ket once the second half began.
Along with their inability to
pull off the key rebounds, the In
dians had shooting trouble in the
initial stanza. Most of this troub
le was in getting shots off. But
the defensively determined Bea
vers saw to it that they didn't get
many shots.

Despite co-captain Paul Neu
i mann's 26-point effort, Stanford's
Indians couldn't get into the
game last night and dropped a
68-56 contest to Oregon State's
determined Beavers.
The Indians were no less than
j miserable on I he backboards, and
pretty much gave up tlie ball as
| often as ihtey shot. Always will
ing to take over, the Beavers did
iust that and. paced by guard Jim
Woodland's 20 points, Ihey roast
ed home with little trouble.
After a close first half which
saw the score tied three times,
and finally break in the Beavers'
favor, 29 27, Oregon State got hot
and pulled away to a 10 point lead
before live minutes of the second
stanza was gone.
Flynn Stars
Forward Steve Flynn paced the
Beaver drive, hitting on four
quick field shots in five tries.
Once they got the 10-point mar
gin the Beavers were off and run
ning. Stanford tried, but couldn't
match the team play which the
Beavers put out.
The locals got no closer 1o the
Orange and Black than seven
markers, a gap they saw twice in
the closing minutes, the last time
with just under four minutes to
go. /
But every time Ihe Cards moved
i to score and close the gap, the
; Stanfords fouled and lost the ad
j vantage. The score-then foul pro
cedure occurred no less than on
the Indians' last seven baskets.
The loss was the Indians' sec
ond Conference setback; they
! have one win, scored over Wash
ington State in the Conference
opener.
Hi in Second Hull'
Neumann was ihe oidy man to
keep the Indians' chances alive in
the second frame. His 16-point
second half, coming on the
strength of the driving lay-ins he
has used so effectively on this
Northwest swing, was three
counters better than the total
scored by ihe rest of his squad.
Center Dick Haga, who scored
IS counters for the night, added
eight of these in the second frame.
But the Indians missed chances
at the free throw line and off the
backboards and this is where the
story was told.
Stanford jumped off to a quick
two-point lead when Haga sank a
two-handed jump shot from 18
feet out, but the Beavers came
back to tie it up when guard Lee
Harman sank two foul shots.
Woodland then hit a 10-footer to
send them ahead and the best the
Indians could do from there on
was to tie the game.
Harman was the second high
man for Oregon State with 15
points before he fouled out to
ward the end of the contest.
Man-to-Man
Stanford played a tight defen
sive game in the first half, press
ing the Beavers with a man-to

man defense, but couldn't hold the
home squad away from the bas
ket once the second half began.
Along with their inability to
pull off the key rebounds, the In
dians had shooting trouble in the
initial stanza. Most of this troub
le was in getting shots off. But
the defensively determined Bea
vers saw to it that they didn't get
many shots.
