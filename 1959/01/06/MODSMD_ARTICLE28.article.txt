# DAILY Sports SCENE
## Meet the Cards 
### 
Led the PCC in free throws
last year with 59 one-pointers
in 68 tries. Possesses a great
"touch" from the foul line or
the floor. A pleasure to watch
him shoot. Compensates for
lack of strength with finesse
and timing. Won starting berth
half-way through '58 campaign.
6-7, 176 lbs. Out with touch of
pneumonia.

Fought his way into starting
role last season and saw action
in every Card tussle. Not out
standing in any department, but
very consistent with few real
weaknesses. Second in PCC
shooting percentages in '58.
Has excellent jump shot. Very
serious about the game. A hard
worker and hustler. 6-2, 173
lbs.
