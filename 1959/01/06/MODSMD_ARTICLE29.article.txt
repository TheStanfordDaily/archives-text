## 
### Alan Miller 
"Why, this year's varsity swim
ming team will be the best Stan
ford has ever seen!" expounded
Indian tank coach Tom Haynie.
Not only does Stanford have
top swimmers in every classifica
tion, but when they swim against
Southern California's two Olym
pic champs this winter, the spec
tators will be in store for poten
tially the finest dual swimming
meet in America. In every race
at least one swimmer will be ca
pable of breaking a National In
tercollegiate record.
In readiness for the National
AAU meet in March, and in order
to conform with the rest of the
United States, Stanford and Ihe
other PCC' schools will initiate
swimming competition in Janu
ary through March rather than
during spring quarter.
National freestyle champion
Robin Moore and top PCC back
stroker Wayne Mehl co-captain
this year's team. Hank Fourcade,
a fine freestyler and great "team
man," is the only other senior on
the squad.
Up from last year's frosh team,
however, are eight top men, niak
ing up almost half of the team
and assuring Stanford of top
swimming material for three
more years. George Harrison,
National indoor AAU 400-yard in
dividual medley champ, broke
three National Intercollegiate
frosh records last season and is
out to rewrite the books in the
varsity circles this year.
Jim Cooper at the breaststroke
spot, Mike Zeller in freestyle, and
butterflier John Jurgensen, who
teamed up with Harrison last
year to set a National Intercolle
giate 400-yard individual medley
record, are also in the varsity

ranks this fall. Bgth Zeller and
Jurgensen "have possibilities o£
being the top sprinters in Stan
ford history in their class," ex*
plained Haynie.
Jack Howell, a junior transfer
from Long Beach City College*
holds the second fastest time na
tionally for JC swimmers in the
backstroke and will definitely be
number one here.
In the diving, senior Bob Kahn
will be working to give a repeat
performance of his PCC win of
last season, Soph Steve Jackson
is also developing into one of the
best young divers Stanford has
seen in quite a while.
Junior Tim Timken, who grab
bed seconds in both freestyle
sprints at the PCC Champs last
year, will be back. Distance man
Jim Muir will also be returning.

tators will be in store for poten
tially the finest dual swimming
meet in America. In every race
at least one swimmer will be ca
pable of breaking a National In
tercollegiate record.
In readiness for the National
AAU meet in March, and in order
to conform with the rest of the
United States, Stanford and Ihe
other PCC' schools will initiate
swimming competition in Janu
ary through March rather than
during spring quarter.
National freestyle champion
Robin Moore and top PCC back
stroker Wayne Mehl co-captain
this year's team. Hank Fourcade,
a fine freestyler and great "team
man," is the only other senior on
the squad.
Up from last year's frosh team,
however, are eight top men, niak
ing up almost half of the team
and assuring Stanford of top
swimming material for three
more years. George Harrison,
National indoor AAU 400-yard in
dividual medley champ, broke
three National Intercollegiate
frosh records last season and is
out to rewrite the books in the
varsity circles this year.
Jim Cooper at the breaststroke
spot, Mike Zeller in freestyle, and
butterflier John Jurgensen, who
teamed up with Harrison last
year to set a National Intercolle
giate 400-yard individual medley
record, are also in the varsity

ranks this fall. Bgth Zeller and
Jurgensen "have possibilities o£
being the top sprinters in Stan
ford history in their class," ex*
plained Haynie.
Jack Howell, a junior transfer
from Long Beach City College*
holds the second fastest time na
tionally for JC swimmers in the
backstroke and will definitely be
number one here.
In the diving, senior Bob Kahn
will be working to give a repeat
performance of his PCC win of
last season, Soph Steve Jackson
is also developing into one of the
best young divers Stanford has
seen in quite a while.
Junior Tim Timken, who grab
bed seconds in both freestyle
sprints at the PCC Champs last
year, will be back. Distance man
Jim Muir will also be returning.
"Why, this year's varsity swim
ming team will be the best Stan
ford has ever seen!" expounded
Indian tank coach Tom Haynie.
Not only does Stanford have
top swimmers in every classifica
tion, but when they swim against
Southern California's two Olym
pic champs this winter, the spec
tators will be in store for poten
tially the finest dual swimming
meet in America. In every race
at least one swimmer will be ca
