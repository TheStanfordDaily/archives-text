# Rothwell Made Mills President
## 
### 
C. Easton Rothwell, director of Hoover Institution since 1932, will
assume the duties of president of Mills College June 1.
Rothwell's appointment was announced in December by the Mills
College Board of Trustees. No successor has been named to the
Hoover post.
The new Mills president was born in Denver in 1924 and is a grad-

uate of Reed College. He received
the master's degree from the Uni
versity of Oregon in 1929, and the
Ph.D. from Stanford in 1938.
From 1941 to 1946 Rothwell was
a Stale Department executive and
was executive secretary of the
500-member group which organ
ized the San Francisco United Na
tions Conference.
He returned to Stanford in 1917
as vice-chairman of Hoover Insti
tution and succeeded Harold Fish
er in the director's chair in 19i52.
Upon accepting his new posi
| tion, Rothwell commented, "I am
pleased to return to a wider edu
cational program. I am intrigued
by the challenge."
He said he can see no reason
why education for women should
differ from that for men. He em
phasized the "conserving role" of
women.
"All the basic values are
learned in the home and con
served in the home, and if these
values are given wings, then both
minds and spirits are endowed
with a sense of direction."
Mrs. Rothwell is secretary to
the Committee on Financial
Awards and their daughter, Anne,
is a freshman at Stanford.
