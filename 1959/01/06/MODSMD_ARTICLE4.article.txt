# New Institute Aids Research
## 
### 
An Institute of Theoretical
Physics, designed to implement
an expanding research program
in this field, has been established
by Stanford.
Support for the major portion
of the research to be conducted
will come from the Air Force Of
fice of Scientific Research, ac
cording to Physics Department
head Professor Leonard I. Schiff.
Theoretical work in the Insti
tute will complement experimen
tal work in Stanford's W. W. Han
sen Laboratories of Physics. Un
like the Hansen laboratories, the
Institute will be a part of the
Physics Department and will not
have separate facilities or equip
ment.
