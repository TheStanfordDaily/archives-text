# State Policy Outlined by Gov. Brown
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (/Pi— Democrat
Edmund G. Brown became Cali
fornia's 32nd governor Monday,
calling on a Democratic Legisla
ture to translate his program of
"responsible liberalism" into law.
In a 40 - minute Inaugural ad
dress to a crowd in the stately
Assembly chamber, the 53-year
old governor outlined a 14-point
program emphasizing social wel
fare, with first place to civil
rights.
"We are resolved to be gov
erned more by our hopes than
by our fears," Brown said.
Brown only briefly mentioned
the slate's biggest problems, wa
ter and taxes. He reserved them
for later separate messages to the
Legislature.
However, the now governor all
but said he would ask for new
taxes to meet a huge budget defi
cit. And he promised a "rational,
realistic and responsive" water
program.
Brown defined liberal govern
ment as that "when people come
first and special privilege is
scorned." But, he added:
"A program which pampers the
people or threatens our solvency
is as irresponsible as the one
which ignores a vital need."
As he detailed his 14 specific
recommendations he was inter
rupted a score of times by ap
plause.
As Chief Justice Phil Gibson
administered I he oath of office to
Brown, the chamber was silent
except for the whirring and snap
ping of cameras. Gibson also
swore in Democrat Glenn M. An
derson as lieutenant governor.
Secretary of State Frank M.
Jordan, only Republican loft
among California's constitutional
officers, was sworn in quietly in
his office Monday.
The 70-year-old Jordan left his
offices only to hear Democratic
Governor Brown's inaugural ad
dress.
"It's their party," he said.
