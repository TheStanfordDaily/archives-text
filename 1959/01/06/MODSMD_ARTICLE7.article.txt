# SOVIET ROCKET
## Scientists Lose Track Of Satellite 
### 
MOSCOW (/P) The Soviet cos
mic rocket Mechta (dream) lost
its voice Monday on its plunge to
ward an orbit around the sun.
Radio signals of the IVfc - ton
projectile faded out as it passed
the 370,960-mile mark and its 62nd
hour aloft, in a headlong dash
from the earth into man's great
er conquest of space.
Soviet scientists lost track of
their brainchild.
May Return
But mute or not, they expected
it to streak into a solar orbit
Wednesday or Thursday on a
' pear-shaped course that possibly
- barely possibly—might one day
swing it back to earth.
It is due to enter an elliptical
course between the earth and
Mars, they said, taking 15 months
to complete the swing around the
sun that the earth completes in
twelve.
"If our rocket moved only un
der the influence of the sun's
gravitation it would return abso
lutely to the point in space where
it went into orbit, but as its move
ments will be subjected to the in
fluence of other bodies in the
solar system it will return only
approximately to this area.
Space Ship Possible
Prof. Boris Kukarkin, deputy
chairman of the Soviet Astronom
ical Council, mentioned the possi
bility of a space ship soaring out
side the entire solar system, be
dond the Milky Way. He said
higher speeds than needed by
Mechta to escape the earth's grav
ity are probably attainable in
the near future.
"We can not only leave our
solar system, but even our ga
lactic system," he said.
Tass announced depletion of
power killed the radio signals.
Plan Completed
"The program of observations
and scientific investigations of
the rocket has been completed,"
the-Soviet news agency said.
It reported the 62 hours of ra
dio communications enabled a
check on the work of scientific in
struments aboard and observa
tions of the rocket's movements.
It was promised that the scien
tific results will be published as
the observations are gradually
processed.

its voice Monday on its plunge to
ward an orbit around the sun.
Radio signals of the IVfc - ton
projectile faded out as it passed
the 370,960-mile mark and its 62nd
hour aloft, in a headlong dash
from the earth into man's great
er conquest of space.
Soviet scientists lost track of
their brainchild.
May Return
But mute or not, they expected
it to streak into a solar orbit
Wednesday or Thursday on a
' pear-shaped course that possibly
- barely possibly—might one day
swing it back to earth.
It is due to enter an elliptical
course between the earth and
Mars, they said, taking 15 months
to complete the swing around the
sun that the earth completes in
twelve.
"If our rocket moved only un
der the influence of the sun's
gravitation it would return abso
lutely to the point in space where
it went into orbit, but as its move
ments will be subjected to the in
fluence of other bodies in the
solar system it will return only
approximately to this area.
Space Ship Possible
Prof. Boris Kukarkin, deputy
chairman of the Soviet Astronom
ical Council, mentioned the possi
bility of a space ship soaring out
side the entire solar system, be
dond the Milky Way. He said
higher speeds than needed by
Mechta to escape the earth's grav
ity are probably attainable in
the near future.
"We can not only leave our
solar system, but even our ga
lactic system," he said.
Tass announced depletion of
power killed the radio signals.
Plan Completed
"The program of observations
and scientific investigations of
the rocket has been completed,"
the-Soviet news agency said.
It reported the 62 hours of ra
dio communications enabled a
check on the work of scientific in
struments aboard and observa
tions of the rocket's movements.
It was promised that the scien
tific results will be published as
the observations are gradually
processed.
