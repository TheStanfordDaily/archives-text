# Eisenhower Presents New Defense Budget
## Democrats Consider It Insufficient 
### 
WASHINGTON (/I 3 ) — The Ei
senhower administration sketched
out a $40,900,000,000 defense budg
et Monday for leaders of the new
Congress.
There was mention, too, of a
timetable for rocketing a man to
the moon.
Too Little for Space
The reaction to the spending
plans was less than enthusiastic.
Some key Democrats challenged
the space and missile financing as
too small.
Nor did Republican Congres
sional leaders organize any cheer
ing section as they marched out.
of a 2Vfc-hour conference with
President Eisenhower.
There was no sign that the So
viet Union's blasting of a satellite
toward orbit around the sun
would result in any immediate
monetary shot in the arm for the
American space program.
Up 100 Million
Rather, indications developed
that the heavily Democratic Con
gress convening Wednesday may
write its own ticket in the months
ahead on funds for defense and
allied operations. Eisenhower's
figure is up only 100 millions over
the current budget.
Senator Lyndon Johnson (D-
Tex.), the majority leader, said
that "It is my judgment that we
should be going farther, faster in
our military preparations and in
our space program. And I do feel
deeply concerned and hope that
we will aggressively expedite
these programs as soon as pos
sible, particularly with our planes
and missiles."
Rocket to Moon
Senator Everett M. Dirksen (R
-111.) said, however, that his guess
is that there will be "a rather
substantial sum" for space devel
opment, and "a speedup in every
field," including that of sending a
manned rocket to the moon.
House Speaker Sam Rayburn
said that "we'll decide what to
do" after Eisenhower presents his
State of the Union and budget
message to Congress.
Annual Meeting
Monday's White House meet
ing was an annual affair to which
the President invites both Demo
cratic and Republican leaders of
Senate and House and the top
members of both parties on the
Appropriations, Armed Services
and Foreign Affairs committees.
Twenty-five accepted for briefing
on defense and foreign policy as
they relate to legislation and the
budget.
As Johnson noted, domestic is
sues, such as civil rights, slum
clearance and aid for depressed
areas, were skipped. Only defense
and foreign policy get he non-par
tisan treatment.
