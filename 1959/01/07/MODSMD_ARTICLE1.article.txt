# Halleck Defeats Martin For House Leadership
## 
### 
WASHINGTON f/P)-House Re
publicans ejected their- veteran
leader, Representative Joseph W.
Martin Jr. of Massachusetts,
Tuesday on the eve of a new Con
gressional session.
A rebellion pointed toward giv
ing the party high command a
more aggressive, vigorous look
shifted the leadership mantle to
Representative Charles A. Hal
leck of Indiana.
The vote, taken in a secret ses

sion on the eve of the new session
of Congress, was 74 for Halleck
and 70 for the Massachusetts con
gressman who has been the
House GOP leader for 20 years.
There was little or no question
of conservative vs. liberal atti
tudes, as has cropped up among
Republicans in the Senate. Mar
tin and Halleck are both basically
conservative.
Age Deterrent
Martin's age, 74, was against
him. Halleck is 58 and a sharp
tongued partisan battler, whereas
Martin by his own description is
an apostle of the conciliatory way
to get things done.
Martin pointed a finger of
blame at some White House aides,
but not at President Eisenhower
directly. He also said Vice-Presi
dent Richard Nixon's associates
opposed him.
The fight to displace Martin
certainly went back to the wide
spread setbacks suffered by Re
publicans in the November elec
tions, but probably even farther.
One result of the overthrow is
to make the tough-minded Hal
leck a key man in shaping the Re
publican decision on who will get
the party's Presidential nomina
tion in 1960.
Martin was speaker of the
House two terms and he served as
chairman of the last five Republi
can National Conventions.
Halleck
Halleck can be expected to give
the opposition a rougher time,

whether or not he can achieve
much with the greatly reduced
strength the Republicans now
have in the House. He is a grad
uate of Indiana University, a Phi
Beta Kappa and a lawyer.
The changeover provided a dra
matic, spectacular prelude for a
similar showdown within Senate
Republican ranks and for the
opening of the heavily Democratic
86th Congress at noon Wednes
day.
