against the Batista regime.
Revolutionary courts were re
ported being prepared to try Ba
tista, now in exile in the Domini
can Republic, and other officials
who may be accused of crimes
during his rule.
Asylum
In Washington, U.S. Attorney
General William Rogers said
Tuesday Batista would not be
granted asylum in the United
States if ho sought it.
Batista is now in the Dominican
Republic.
Rogers noted that U.S. grants
of asylum always involved a
showing that the person seeking
entry would be in physical dan
ger if he remained where he was.
Castro Policies
The initial policies of the new
government were being shaped
as Fidel Castro, the rebel leader
who shoved Provisional President
Manuel Urrutia to power, was
still plodding through adoring
throngs toward the capital. It
was doubtful he would reach Ha
vana Wednesday as planned.
The decree abolishing Congress
.said the Urrutia government
could rule by ministerial decree
until free elections are held. Urru
tia has announced that these
would be held in 18 to 24 months.
