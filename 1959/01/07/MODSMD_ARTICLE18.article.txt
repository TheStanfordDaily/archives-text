# Bohn Tells Plans for Legislation
## 
### 
A two-pronged program of leg
islation for 1959 was announced
yesterday by AS S U president
John Bohn. He said ho will call
on the Logi-slature to effect:
• A revision of the governmen
tal system of committees and
commissions to avoid overlapping
of duties.
• An appropriation to remodel
the Nitery.
Bohn does not believe that the
constitution will have to be re
vised to effect the changes in ad
ministration, but, he added, "We
will change the constitution if we
have to.
"I do not believe that the trou
ble is with the people involved in
student government but with the
system in use, which is full of
ambiguities," he said.
As an example of the overlap
ping of authority, he cited the re
cent mix-up between the Cardi
nals and Rally Commission over
the rallies. lie said, "We must
not duplicate ourselves on events
such as the rallies, and we must
have a central authority through
which to channel the reports and
functions of these bodies."
To get his program rolling, he
stated that he will appoint inves
tigating committees, limited to
three or four members, to investi
gate the various committees and
commissions and report back to
the Legislature before the end of
the quarter. "This quarter we will
lay the footwork for the actual
changes during spring quarter,"
he said.
As for the remodeling of the
Nitery, Bohn would like to see a
stairway cut from the Nitery to
The Cellar and a dance floor made
available in the Nitery.where stu
dents could dance to a juke box
and get a cup of coffee.
Bohn also stated that President
J. Wallace Sterling will address
the Legislature on Jan. 29 in an
afternoon meeting tentatively set
for 4:15 p.m. at Bowman Alumni
House. After his talk, Sterling
will participate in a discussion
with the legislators.
