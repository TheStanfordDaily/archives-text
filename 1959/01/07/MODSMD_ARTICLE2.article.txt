Africans demanding independ
ence.
At least 34 Africans have been
killed and another 100 seriously
injured in the clashes that start
ed Sunday between police and Af
ricans.
The city is still under a virtual
state of siege, but transport has
been restored.
Europeans have been armed in
case of further outbreaks of vio
lence. Paratroopers rushed from
the military base at Kamina are
standing by.
The riots began after a political
meeting of Congolese where the
future independence of the Congo
was discussed.
Tension has been high in this
steaming city for some time.
The riots concern only a limited
number of the Congo population
of about 13 million. However, the
violence of the outburst is evi
dence of wide unrest.
