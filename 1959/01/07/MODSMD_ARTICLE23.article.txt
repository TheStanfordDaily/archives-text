# Many Crutches
## 
### 
Thf. sun SHONE BRIGHTLY, the paths were drying, the first day of
classes was over.
Let's take a look at a typical class on the first day of the new
quarter. Our subject is a leeture class with ahout 80 students.' It
convenes in one of the larger, older rooms with only fair acoustics
and chairs which curve in the wrong places.
The class proceeds. Tlip instructor outlines the quar
ter s uork and reads the syllabus to the students. ( I liis
takes up time, and some of the class may not know how
to read.)
He then asks if there are any questions. Indeed there are. It
seems he has overlooked an elaborate discussion of his grading
plans, and the students bombard him with questions such as '"How
will the paper and the exams he weighted?" "Vfr ill you grade on
the curve?" and so on.
The instructor patiently answers these questions, remarking
that we really shouldn't worry about it.
And his offhand, apologetic remark is probably the most im
portant thing he has said all morning. Those who are concerned
about changes in the academic program which will permit more
individual work and initiative should take note of the questions
which are asked of instructors. They emphasize grades, just when
many others would like to see the emphasis taken ofl grades and
put on content.
Students would like not to worry (dioul grades (al
though there are those who enjoy such misery), hut it
takes a concentrated effort to direct one's attention else
where.
The instructor doesn't help the situation. He has just ex
plained that he might find it necessary to use quizzes as crutches
to force the student to keep up with the daily work.
To this we object. Why should the instructor provide the
student with any more crutches than he already has? Ihe mid
term examination forces the student to catch up in the work.
Papers make him do some work for the course, object to the
instructor taking any possibility for initiative from the student
by forcing him to keep up in the work through the threat of
quizzes, or, in other words, grades.
If the student will not do the work, if he gets way
behind, this is the result of his own foolishness. IVe are
not advocating that the instructor divorce himself from
the progress of the student, but that he not spoon-feed
him, using deadlines, crutches, jmpers, etc., as his ladles.
Those who are looking toward changes in the academic pro
gram should seek some way to begin remolding this attitude. Both
student and instructor must he convinced that the student is capa
ble of planning his own method of study. He does not need to be
poked and prodded; often lie trips over the crutches offered by
teachers, rather than supporting himself with them.
Grades and quizzes, numerous papers and mid-terms all serve
as crutches which should be burned. As to the student who fears
having to retain and comprehend knowledge over a longer period
than he must at present as he goes from test to test, other schools
will be glad to help him stumble along and the road won't be half
so difficult or challenging.
