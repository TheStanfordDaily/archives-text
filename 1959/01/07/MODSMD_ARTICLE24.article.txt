# Helium Will Defy Laws of Nature

It is also a key element in
satellite launchers and large mil
itary rockets.
Helium's importance comes not
so much from what it has, but
from what it lacks, the National
Geographic Society says. The
gas is odorless, tasteless, color
less, inert. It will not normally
combine with other elements. It
will not burn or explode. It will
change into a liquid only at ex
tremely low temperatures.
But in one liquid state helium
defies some of the laws of nature.
It will flow uphill. It transmits
heat phenomenally well. It acts
so strangely that some scientists
declare there are four kinds of
matter in the world: solids,
liquids, gases—and superfluid
helium.
As demand for the gas grows,
the Department of Interior—the
only producer in the United States
and the major world producer—
has announced a $225 million pro
gram to build 12 recovery plants
beside natural gas pipelines. He
lium occurs in natural gas in con
centrations up to 7 per cent. There
are four plants in operation: at
Otis, Kansas; Shiprock, New
Mexico; and Amarillo and Ewell,
Texas.

Although minute amounts of
helium are found in the air and
in many rocks, the gas was first
discovered, not on earth, but on
the sun. Studies of the sun's
edges during an eclipse in 1868
produced the first evidence of
its existance —a bright yellow
line in the spectrum.
Named from the Greek "helios"
meaning sun, it was not identi
fied on earth until 28 years later.
Sir William Ramsay produced it
by heating the mineral cleveite.
He described his experiment in
the National Geographic Maga
zine in Apr il, 1906.
Showing that the helium can
be formed as an end product of
radioactive decay, Sir William
pointed out a path to develop
ments far in the future:
"The radioactive elements are
in a sense explosive . . . but such
explosions surpass in degree, to
an almost inconceivable extent,
the molecular explosions with
which we are familiar," he wrote.
"Could we induce a fragment of
radium to evolve all its energy
at once, Ihe result would be ter
rific, for in the energy with which
it parts during its change, it sur
passes in explosive power our
most potent guncotton by millions
of times."
