# Library Use Limited
## 
### 
Due to the substantial increase
in the number of students using
the sources, the Stanford Univer
sity Libraries are now limiting
the privileges granted to high
school students for library use.
Instead of granting privileges
for periods up to 60 days, the
maximum period will now be 15

days with no renewal of the privi
lege during any semester.
College and university students
will continue to be granted 30- and
60-day cards upon presentation of
an application for msigned by the
librarians of their institutions.
The Stanford University Libra
ries require that high school stu
dents submit a form signed by
the high school librarian in order
to obtain library privileges at
Stanford. This form certifies that
the materials needed by the stu
dent are nol present in the school
library and recommends the pe
riod of time during which privi
leges are to be granted.
