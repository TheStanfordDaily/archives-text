# Small Insights Not Enough In New O'Hara Novel
## 
### A Review By E. Baumbach 
From the Terrace, by John
O'Hara. Random House.
"From the Terrace," the new
est and longest John O'Hara
novel, is the story of Alfred Eaton
of Port Johnson, Pa. a rich boy
(but not really rich as O'Hara
notes carefully) who goes from
prep school to Princeton to Wall
Street to dull, meaningless medi
ocrity. ■
One can briefly give the details
of Alfred Eaton's life his unhap
py childhood with a father who
rejects him and an alcoholic moth
er, his marriage which begins on
a high note of love and presum
ably real romance but which ends
in hatred and mutual boredom,
and finally his love affair with a
woman who is the flame and pas
sion of his life but who again
comes at the end lo pity, even dis
like, the man for whom she has
given everything.
Eaton's life covers a turbulent
era of American history and
O'Hara, as usual, has taken great
pains to chronicle that era in
great detail. Eaton leaves Prince
ton to join the glorious war
against the Kaiser. When he re
turns he sows the usual wild oats,
takes a flyer into airplane manu
facturing, and finally settles down
with a good, solid career in Wall
Street in which he is able to
make a little money (but not too
much—only a couple of million
dollars—not enough to give a
man real freedom, real power ).
Alfred eventually becomes Un
der Secretary of the Navy under
Roosevelt (whom he cordially dis
likes) only to find that his years
of service in wartime Washington
have caused the loss of what
could have been an extremely suc

cessful career in finance. He re
tires— from business and, more
essentially, from life itself.
For what is life for Alfred Fa
ion? Presumably love is an im
portant part of it. Oi- at least sex
is. His relationship to Mary St.
John, who is to be his first wife,
begins directly and passionately,
but degenerates into a situation
in which she is completely pro
miscuous and he is deeply in
volved in a heartbreaking love af
fair. Yet Mary tells him that for
her the relationship was always
simply sex — nothing more. And
his affair with Natalie Benzinger
duplicates in intensity the court
ship of Mary.
Why then is the affair real love
and the other merely sex? When
physical love is described in such
intricate and even tedious detail
it seems to become only sex. The
love scenes which are played over
and over again have an embar
rassing sameness. They have lost
the vitality and sense of romance
which one found in a book such
as O'Hara's earlier "Appointment
in Sahara" and resemble nothing
so much as a plumber's catalogue.
Business, too, is an integral
pari of Eaton's life. His career is
slowly unfolded against a back
drop of New York and Philadel
phia society a discreet backdrop
for the mosl part of "old money."
One is told what was served for
lunch at ihe Racquet Club on a
certain day, how younger, soon
to-be successful men address old
er, established ones during the
meal, and how this slightly inti
mate manner is modified at the
business conference afterward.
What shades of deference, what
precise, sociological understand
ing of social distinctions and un
uttered aspirations we have here
and what a terrifying glance at

the awful carefulness of the
merely rich toward the very rich.
But aside from sex and busi
ness what else is Alfred Eaton's
life? lie never feels great joy,
doesn't shout, scream, weep (al
though there are a few, scarcely
Dostoyevskian tears shed). We
know how he knots his ties and
where ho buys them. We know
every aspect of his libido and ex
actly how he will handle himself
in a business transaction (with
circumspection, some intelligence
but nut with daring, not with
genius) but Alfred Eaton as a
person—aside from his ties and
his contracts to be signed—simply
does not exist.
The intricate details of Ameri
can life which O'Hara has so care
fully researched only point out
more vividly that though O'Hara
has the setting for a big novel,
he has tailed in every way to cre
ale a hero for one. Alfred Eaton
and all of his relatives and friends
are trivial and irrelevant. For,
after all, there has to be some
thing more than sex and the im
portant desk at least there has
to be more in a work of art.
All of O'Hara's insights are the
small, ordinary ones. Although
he has, and has always had, a
wonderful sense of dialogue, his
gilt for language and his vision
of life are simply not large
enough for a "big" novel. To use
O'Hara's own words, one can de
scribe Alfred Eaton's circle with:
"Tliey had had no conversa
tion that went deeper than ob
servations on the weather and
the slippery going."
What more is there 1o say?

essentially, from life itself.
For what is life for Alfred Fa
ion? Presumably love is an im
portant part of it. Oi- at least sex
is. His relationship to Mary St.
John, who is to be his first wife,
begins directly and passionately,
but degenerates into a situation
in which she is completely pro
miscuous and he is deeply in
volved in a heartbreaking love af
fair. Yet Mary tells him that for
her the relationship was always
simply sex — nothing more. And
his affair with Natalie Benzinger
duplicates in intensity the court
ship of Mary.
Why then is the affair real love
and the other merely sex? When
physical love is described in such
intricate and even tedious detail
it seems to become only sex. The
love scenes which are played over
and over again have an embar
rassing sameness. They have lost
the vitality and sense of romance
which one found in a book such
as O'Hara's earlier "Appointment
in Sahara" and resemble nothing
so much as a plumber's catalogue.
Business, too, is an integral
pari of Eaton's life. His career is
slowly unfolded against a back
drop of New York and Philadel
phia society a discreet backdrop
for the mosl part of "old money."
One is told what was served for
lunch at ihe Racquet Club on a
certain day, how younger, soon
to-be successful men address old
er, established ones during the
meal, and how this slightly inti
mate manner is modified at the
business conference afterward.
What shades of deference, what
precise, sociological understand
ing of social distinctions and un
uttered aspirations we have here
and what a terrifying glance at

the awful carefulness of the
merely rich toward the very rich.
But aside from sex and busi
ness what else is Alfred Eaton's
life? lie never feels great joy,
doesn't shout, scream, weep (al
though there are a few, scarcely
Dostoyevskian tears shed). We
know how he knots his ties and
where ho buys them. We know
every aspect of his libido and ex
actly how he will handle himself
in a business transaction (with
circumspection, some intelligence
but nut with daring, not with
genius) but Alfred Eaton as a
person—aside from his ties and
his contracts to be signed—simply
does not exist.
The intricate details of Ameri
can life which O'Hara has so care
fully researched only point out
more vividly that though O'Hara
has the setting for a big novel,
he has tailed in every way to cre
ale a hero for one. Alfred Eaton
and all of his relatives and friends
are trivial and irrelevant. For,
after all, there has to be some
thing more than sex and the im
portant desk at least there has
to be more in a work of art.
All of O'Hara's insights are the
small, ordinary ones. Although
he has, and has always had, a
wonderful sense of dialogue, his
gilt for language and his vision
of life are simply not large
enough for a "big" novel. To use
O'Hara's own words, one can de
scribe Alfred Eaton's circle with:
"Tliey had had no conversa
tion that went deeper than ob
servations on the weather and
the slippery going."

From the Terrace, by John
O'Hara. Random House.
"From the Terrace," the new
est and longest John O'Hara
novel, is the story of Alfred Eaton
of Port Johnson, Pa. a rich boy
(but not really rich as O'Hara
notes carefully) who goes from
prep school to Princeton to Wall
Street to dull, meaningless medi
ocrity. ■
One can briefly give the details
of Alfred Eaton's life his unhap
py childhood with a father who
rejects him and an alcoholic moth
er, his marriage which begins on
a high note of love and presum
ably real romance but which ends
in hatred and mutual boredom,
and finally his love affair with a
woman who is the flame and pas
sion of his life but who again
comes at the end lo pity, even dis
like, the man for whom she has
given everything.
Eaton's life covers a turbulent
era of American history and
O'Hara, as usual, has taken great
pains to chronicle that era in
great detail. Eaton leaves Prince
ton to join the glorious war
against the Kaiser. When he re
turns he sows the usual wild oats,
takes a flyer into airplane manu
facturing, and finally settles down
with a good, solid career in Wall
Street in which he is able to
make a little money (but not too
much—only a couple of million
dollars—not enough to give a
man real freedom, real power ).
Alfred eventually becomes Un
der Secretary of the Navy under
Roosevelt (whom he cordially dis
likes) only to find that his years
of service in wartime Washington
have caused the loss of what
could have been an extremely suc

cessful career in finance. He re
tires— from business and, more
essentially, from life itself.

But aside from sex and busi
ness what else is Alfred Eaton's
life? lie never feels great joy,
doesn't shout, scream, weep (al
though there are a few, scarcely
Dostoyevskian tears shed). We
know how he knots his ties and
where ho buys them. We know
every aspect of his libido and ex
actly how he will handle himself
in a business transaction (with
circumspection, some intelligence
but nut with daring, not with
genius) but Alfred Eaton as a
person—aside from his ties and
his contracts to be signed—simply
does not exist.
The intricate details of Ameri
can life which O'Hara has so care
fully researched only point out
more vividly that though O'Hara
has the setting for a big novel,
he has tailed in every way to cre
ale a hero for one. Alfred Eaton
and all of his relatives and friends
are trivial and irrelevant. For,
after all, there has to be some
thing more than sex and the im
portant desk at least there has
to be more in a work of art.
All of O'Hara's insights are the
small, ordinary ones. Although
he has, and has always had, a
wonderful sense of dialogue, his
gilt for language and his vision
of life are simply not large
enough for a "big" novel. To use
O'Hara's own words, one can de
scribe Alfred Eaton's circle with:
"Tliey had had no conversa
tion that went deeper than ob
servations on the weather and
the slippery going."
What more is there 1o say?
From the Terrace, by John
O'Hara. Random House.
"From the Terrace," the new
est and longest John O'Hara
novel, is the story of Alfred Eaton
of Port Johnson, Pa. a rich boy
(but not really rich as O'Hara
notes carefully) who goes from
prep school to Princeton to Wall
Street to dull, meaningless medi
ocrity. ■
One can briefly give the details
of Alfred Eaton's life his unhap
py childhood with a father who
rejects him and an alcoholic moth
er, his marriage which begins on
a high note of love and presum
ably real romance but which ends
in hatred and mutual boredom,
and finally his love affair with a
woman who is the flame and pas
sion of his life but who again
comes at the end lo pity, even dis
like, the man for whom she has
given everything.
Eaton's life covers a turbulent
era of American history and
O'Hara, as usual, has taken great
pains to chronicle that era in
great detail. Eaton leaves Prince
ton to join the glorious war
against the Kaiser. When he re
turns he sows the usual wild oats,
takes a flyer into airplane manu
facturing, and finally settles down
with a good, solid career in Wall
Street in which he is able to
make a little money (but not too
much—only a couple of million
dollars—not enough to give a
man real freedom, real power ).
Alfred eventually becomes Un
der Secretary of the Navy under
Roosevelt (whom he cordially dis
likes) only to find that his years
of service in wartime Washington
have caused the loss of what
could have been an extremely suc

cessful career in finance. He re
tires— from business and, more
essentially, from life itself.
For what is life for Alfred Fa
ion? Presumably love is an im
portant part of it. Oi- at least sex
is. His relationship to Mary St.
John, who is to be his first wife,
begins directly and passionately,
but degenerates into a situation
in which she is completely pro
miscuous and he is deeply in
volved in a heartbreaking love af
fair. Yet Mary tells him that for
her the relationship was always
simply sex — nothing more. And
his affair with Natalie Benzinger
duplicates in intensity the court
ship of Mary.
Why then is the affair real love
and the other merely sex? When
physical love is described in such
intricate and even tedious detail
it seems to become only sex. The
love scenes which are played over
and over again have an embar
rassing sameness. They have lost
the vitality and sense of romance
which one found in a book such
as O'Hara's earlier "Appointment
in Sahara" and resemble nothing
so much as a plumber's catalogue.
Business, too, is an integral
pari of Eaton's life. His career is
slowly unfolded against a back
drop of New York and Philadel
phia society a discreet backdrop
for the mosl part of "old money."
One is told what was served for
lunch at ihe Racquet Club on a
certain day, how younger, soon
to-be successful men address old
er, established ones during the
meal, and how this slightly inti
mate manner is modified at the
business conference afterward.
What shades of deference, what
precise, sociological understand
ing of social distinctions and un
uttered aspirations we have here
and what a terrifying glance at

the awful carefulness of the
merely rich toward the very rich.
