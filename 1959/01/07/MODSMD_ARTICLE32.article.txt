# Vandals Invade Friday; Indians Seek Revenge
## 
### 
Stanford's touring hoopsters
who just spent a rather rugged
weekend in 1 lie Northwest will
noi have much chance to grab
any rest now thai they have re
turned home. On Friday night
the Cards will have to face a
tough Idaho team, and on Satur
day will be host to the Washing
ton Huskies.
The Idaho Vandals were one of
the teams that made Stanford's
latest stay in the North so disap
pointing. The Vandals defeated
the Indians last Saturday night
in a very tight defensive game,
36-31.
The men from Idaho don't ap
pear too much different in per
sonnel than they did last year.
There is one exception, and that's
the loss of the conference's top
scorer of last year, Gary Sim
mons.
Veteran Squad
The entire first string for the
Vandals is made up of veterans
and consists of forwards John
Liveious and Hal Darniano, cen
ter Jim Prestel, and guards
Whaylon Coleman and Bob Wal
ton.
The Vandals are not supplied
with any real big men Hut their
team average is very adequate
with two 6-5 men, Liveious and
Prestel, two 6-3ers, Walton and
Damiano, and 6-2 Coleman.
Ii was Liveious who did most of
the scoring for Idaho when they
trimmed the Indians last week
end. Although his team only had
36 points, Liveious had 13. He
sides being the top scorer, Live
ious also gathered in more than
his share of rebounds and teamed
with Hal Damiano to give Idaho
complete domination of the
boards.
These two men, Liveious and
Damiano, form the nucleus of
Idaho's attack and the Dallmar
men of Stanford will have to con
tain both of them if they want to
beat the Vandals.
If Idaho has any real big weak
ness it's lack of a strong bench.
Vandal Coach Harlan Hodges pre
fers to go with his five starters
for most of the game if he can.
With the exception of B. J.
Schaeffer, a reserve forward, and
Roily Williams, a sophomore cen
ter, Hodges hasn't any dependable
substitutes.
Change of Style
As indicated by the 36-31 Satur
day score, the Vandals are not
playing the same wide open type
of offensive ball that they did last
year, but have settled into a more
deliberate defensive minded style.
This is mainly due to the loss of
Simmons.
Simmons averaged well up in
the 20's last year and led Idaho to
a team average of over 70 points
per game. This year, however, the
Vandals have not been able to
come up with anyone who can
fill Simmons' scoring shoes and
therefore Coach Hodges has tried
to emphasize more of the defen
sive skills.
The Vandals come to town with
a 1-1 Conference record so far this
year, having lost to the UCLA
Bruins the night before they
whipped Stanford.


( OMINO; SOON —Vandal forward John Liveious (4) and guard

the Stanford-Idaho tilt here last year. All three will be hack in
action on Friday. Stanford won this one, 72-62.

With the exception of B. J.
Schaeffer, a reserve forward, and
Roily Williams, a sophomore cen
ter, Hodges hasn't any dependable
substitutes.
Change of Style
As indicated by the 36-31 Satur
day score, the Vandals are not
playing the same wide open type
of offensive ball that they did last
year, but have settled into a more
deliberate defensive minded style.
This is mainly due to the loss of
Simmons.
Simmons averaged well up in
the 20's last year and led Idaho to
a team average of over 70 points
per game. This year, however, the
Vandals have not been able to
come up with anyone who can
fill Simmons' scoring shoes and
therefore Coach Hodges has tried
to emphasize more of the defen
sive skills.
The Vandals come to town with
a 1-1 Conference record so far this
year, having lost to the UCLA
Bruins the night before they
whipped Stanford.


( OMINO; SOON —Vandal forward John Liveious (4) and guard
ilal Damiano (42) mix it up with Card center Neal Brocknieyer in
the Stanford-Idaho tilt here last year. All three will be hack in
action on Friday. Stanford won this one, 72-62.
Stanford's touring hoopsters
who just spent a rather rugged
weekend in 1 lie Northwest will
noi have much chance to grab
any rest now thai they have re
turned home. On Friday night
the Cards will have to face a
tough Idaho team, and on Satur
day will be host to the Washing
ton Huskies.
The Idaho Vandals were one of
the teams that made Stanford's
latest stay in the North so disap
pointing. The Vandals defeated
the Indians last Saturday night
in a very tight defensive game,
36-31.
The men from Idaho don't ap
pear too much different in per
sonnel than they did last year.
There is one exception, and that's
the loss of the conference's top
scorer of last year, Gary Sim
mons.
Veteran Squad
The entire first string for the
Vandals is made up of veterans
and consists of forwards John
Liveious and Hal Darniano, cen
ter Jim Prestel, and guards
Whaylon Coleman and Bob Wal
ton.
The Vandals are not supplied
with any real big men Hut their
team average is very adequate
with two 6-5 men, Liveious and
Prestel, two 6-3ers, Walton and
Damiano, and 6-2 Coleman.
Ii was Liveious who did most of
the scoring for Idaho when they
trimmed the Indians last week
end. Although his team only had
36 points, Liveious had 13. He
sides being the top scorer, Live
ious also gathered in more than
his share of rebounds and teamed
with Hal Damiano to give Idaho
complete domination of the
boards.
These two men, Liveious and
Damiano, form the nucleus of
Idaho's attack and the Dallmar
men of Stanford will have to con
tain both of them if they want to
beat the Vandals.
If Idaho has any real big weak
ness it's lack of a strong bench.
Vandal Coach Harlan Hodges pre

for most of the game if he can.
