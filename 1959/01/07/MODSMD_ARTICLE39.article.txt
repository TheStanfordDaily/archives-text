### 
Leading scorer on 'f57â€”T5B
squad with 29G eounlers. A jun
ior, he should show much im
provement this year. Rugged
and has quic k hands. Not par
ticularly fast or good jumper,
but good defensive man because
of excellent timing. A good bat
tler and really a clutch perform
er. Stands 6-3, weighs 187.

Should see much reserve ac
tion this year. Started on the
northern swing when Warren
hurt foot. Came along well last
year. Is a good passer and
shooter. Aggressive, with a
good basketball sense. Always
hustling. Valuable reserve and
a fine team player. Rose is a
senior. 6-0, 176.
