# Indian Boxing Team Eyes Great Season
## 
### 
Stanford's boxing team, antici
pating its most successful season
in several years, enters the ring
against the University of Santa
Clara on Friday, Jan. 16.
Leading the squad in its first
meet will be 139-pounder Tom
Logsdon, 156-pounder John Wil
helmy, 165-pounder Bill Vaughey
and heavyweight Trev Grimm.
Santa Clara will also find itself
facing heavyweights Eddie Roth
man and Larry Eschelman; 178-
pounders Talton Hay, Bill McDon

ald, Nick Tottossy and Bill Sharp;
and 165-pounder Ed Mitchell.
Unlike other Paci 112 i c Coast
teams, Stanford does not recruit
boxers; consequently, the Indians'
132-, 125- and 119-pound divisions
have no participants. But other
lighter divisions are well stocked
with good fighters. In addition to
those already mentioned, boxers
in these classifications are Bruce
Bellows, Steve Gregg and Mike
Lloyd at 156 pounds; Roger Gert
menian, Ron Marcelle and Smitty
Ketchem at 147 pounds; and Jim
Tompkins at 139 pounds.
Stanford undertakes a tough
schedule, meeting Santa Clara,
University of San Francisco and
California on a home - and - home
basis. Probably the most difficult
opponent will prove to be Cal,
whose huge student body peren
nially produces a strong boxing
squad.
Along with Logsdon, Wilhelmy,
Vaughey and Grimm, Gertmenian
and Sharp have had considerable
fighting experience. The rest of
the team, although not as experi
enced, shows great potential.
