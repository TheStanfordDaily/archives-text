MOSCOW (>P)â€”Soviet scientists
told newsmen Tuesday Mechta's
space voyage can be considered a
dress rehearsal for bigger and
better rockets, though they have
n't yet licked the re-entry problem
for manned flights.
Academician Anatoly Blagonra
vov said no man has flown in a
rocket and "how soon he does fly
will depend on how soon we have
assurances he will be able to re
turn safely."
Blagonravov reported that the
successful launching of the rocket
Mechta Friday marked the frst
Soviet attempt to put a projectile
outside the earth's gravitational
field.
"There isn't a spot, in the uni
verse today which could not be
reached by rocket," he said. "This
would of course require time, but
the wait would not be long."
Vice-President Alexander Top
chiev of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences announced that Mechta
had practically entered orbit as
the solar system's first artificial
planet.
