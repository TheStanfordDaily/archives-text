### 
A special report on the treat
ment of cancer with high energy
electrons from Stanford's Mark
IV linear accelerator will be pre
sented Saturday, Jan. 10, at the
dedication of Stanford's new bio
physics laboratory.
The Mark IV uses electrons di
recly on cancer tumors. Other
accelerators now in use have to
convert their beams into X-rays.
Detlev M. Bronk, president of
the Natitonal Academy of Sci
ences, will speak following a tour
of the lab. Professor Ilenry S.
Kaplan is chairman of the dedica
tion events. President Wallace
Sterling and other University of
ficials will be hosts at the cere
monies.
