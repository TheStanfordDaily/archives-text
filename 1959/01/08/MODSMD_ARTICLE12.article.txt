# NO. 2 MAN
## USSR-U.S. Trade Asked By Mikoyan 
### 
CLEVELAND, Ohio (/P)â€”"You
don't trust us enough," Anastas
I. Mikoyan, Soviet deputy pre
mier, told business leaders Wed
nesday in an appeal for trade be
tween his nation and this country.
"Trade can strengthen peace;
peace can make a proper atmos
phere for trade," the 63-year-old
No. 2 man of the Kremlin said in
a half-hour talk to a selected
group of three score men at the
Union League Club. Many of
them are heads of large corpora
tions.
Buy and Sell
"It is a fact that we have some
thing to buy and sell for each
other," Mikoyan added.
Both Mikoyan and Cyrus Eaton,
millionaire industrialist who is
host to the deputy premier for his
Cleveland visit, voiced a hope
Congress would lift barriers to
trade between the United States
and the Soviet Union.
Eaton introduced Mikoyan,
whose talk was translated by an
interpreter a mouthful at a time.
Eaton said "mutually profitable
commerce would be a further and
broader path to friendship" but
that present restrictive legislation
"poses a serious barrier."
First Stop
This was the first stop on Mi
koyan's swing from Washington
across the country on a "peace
and friendship" tour. It produced
noisy demonstrations of protest
from Iron Curtain nationality
groups. Mikoyan ignored the
shouts and signs, kept smiling and
repeated a doffed-hat greeting to
the crowds.
"When I return, I will tell the
people of the feelings expressed
here by Cyrus Eaton and others,"
Mikoyan said. "I will speak of
the words spoken here which in
dicate the hope of a peaceful co
existence."
