# P.A. LIQUOR
## Licensees Will Fight 'Dry' Zone 
### 
Relax, imbibers; there's little
cause for alarm. Reports of Tues
day and Wednesday said that nine
Palo Alto establishments would
have to stop selling liquor be
cause of Stanford boundary ex
pansion, but it now appears that
possible special California state
legislative action will allow them
to continue dispensing their prod
ucts.
The situation is an outgrowth
of the construction of married
student housing units in the
southern corner of the campus.
]'/z-Mile Limit
State law prohibits the sale of
anything stronger than 3.2 ale or
malt liquor or 4.0 beer within
IV 2 miles of collcge or university
plans. Hence, the shift in the Uni
versity boundaries caused by the
new living units means a shift in
the l'/a-mile limit.
II is this shift which has caught
the nine establishments- two on
Middlefield Road, one on Alma
Street, and six on El Camino Real.
Jerry O'Brien, Alcoholic Beverage
Control officer in San Jose, told
owners Tuesday that when the
boundary change goes into effect
â€”when the housing units are oc
cupied his office will have no
choice but to enforce the slate
law.
Legislative Relief
By Wednesday, however, it ap
peared definite that the nine own
ers would seek legislative relief
in order that they wouldn't be
forced out of business. Such re
lief could come in the form of an
amendment to the state law which
would make the present 1 'a-mile
boundary permanent, regardless
of future expansion of the campus
plant.
Assemblyman Clark Bradley,
who represents northern Santa
Clara County, said Wednesday
that he would sponsor such legis
lation at the current Assembly
session. State Senator Jack
Thompson of Santa Clara County
was not available to confirm re
ports that he would co-sponsor
the bill.
Alteniattc Form
An alternative form of relief
would lie an amendment saying
that the l'/a-mile limit would
change as boundaries change, but
that establishments already in
business al the time of a limit
change could continue to operate.
There appeared little doubt that
such legislative approval could be
gained. Similar situations near
the University of Santa Clara and
UCLA, each within the past two
years, were resolved by amend
ments favorable to liquor estab
lishments near areas of expan
sion.
Stanford's Position
Further indications of probable
approval came with word that
Stanford would not oppose a leg
islative variance.
In 1955, it was also discovered
that the state had incorrectly
measured for the limit, so two
businesses were forced to move
several hundred yards to get fur
ther than 1 miles from the cam
pus boundary.
