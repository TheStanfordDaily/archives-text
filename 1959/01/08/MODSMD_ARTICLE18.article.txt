# Rare Chance
## 
### 
Sti DF.nts wii.i HAVE a comparatively rare opportunity tliis morn
ing to hear Stanford president Wallace Sterling in an all-campus
assembly.
It has been at least six years since the I niversity's president
has spoken directly Id the students, other than al Freshman (.(in
vocation or Commencement. Pressures of time, lark of initiative
on the part of the student* have kept the president from such an
address in the past.
The outline of Dr. Sterling s talk indicates that many
questions of student interest will he covered. II e do not
expect (dl our questions to he answered: it would he im
possible to do in 50 minutes. Hut we do expert some
tbought-provoking comments from the president on the
issues facing the University and education today.
Questions raised in students' minds al 1 I a.m. in Memorial
Auditorium may he more fully answered tonight al the first of
the weekly Stanford Today and Tomorrow discussions in I lie
living groups. The freshmen will form the hulk of tonight's audi
ence, hut all meetings are open if students wish to hear a par
ticular speaker.
Dr. Sterling's talk and the regular ST&T series pro
vide excellent opportunities for students to learn more
about the policy and progress of the University. I hey
should aid the student in the realization that his ideas
are not ignored in the /dunning of the policy, nor are the
student's ideas necessarily uniqueâ€”on occasion the. Uni
versity administration is nay ahead of him in his thin/k
-ing.
We urge all students to take advantage of the opportunity to
hear Dr. Sterling this morning and to attend the ST&T evening
meetings during January.
