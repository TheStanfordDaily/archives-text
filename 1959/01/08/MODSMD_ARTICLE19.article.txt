## Which Majority Will Rule? 
### 
With all due respect to Senator
Paul Douglas, whom I admire
very much, the question at issue
in the Senate is not whether the
majority shall rule. The question
is what kind of majority shall
rule. For there are many sorts
of majorities.
Senator Douglas wants one
more than half of the Senators
elected to rule, which would be 50
Senators. But on most of the bus
iness of the Senate one more than
half of a quorum, which would be
26 votes, can pass a bill. Thus
Senator Douglas himself recog
nizes that on a question of clos
ing debate, a bigger majority
should be required than for ordi
nary legislation.
The present rules of the Sen
ate require 66 Senators to close
a debate, and exclude closure of
a debate on a change in the
rules. The Johnson - Knowland
amendment, which will prob
ably be adopted, requires a two
thirds majority of those present
and voting, which can theoreti
cally be as many as 66 and as
few as 34, to close debate. Sena
tor John Sherman Cooper has
now suggested that the major
ity be three-fifths, which would,
theoretically, permit closure by
as few as 30 Senators up to as
many as 59 Senators, depending
on how many Senators were
present and voting.
Senator Douglas is, therefore,
begging the question when he
talks as if "majority rule" were
something simple and obvious to
all men. Moreover, he ignores the
naure of the Senate, which is the
representative in our system of
a federation of states. In the Sen
ate, what does it mean to speak
of "majority rule"? A majority
of what? A majority of the states
or a majority of the people of
the United States?
In the House of Representa
tives the members represent,
more or less exactly, the voters
themselves, and a member from
New York and a member from
Alaska or Nevada represents ap
proximately the same number of
people. But this is not true of
the Senate.

Thus when Senator Douglas
wants 50 Senators to he able to
close a debate and to pass a bill,
he calls it majority rule which
is "the basic principle of our gov
ernment." But suppose the 50
Senators represent the 25 small
est states, do they represent a
majority of the people of the
United States? Taking the fig
ures for the census of 1950, the
25 smallest states, which have 50
Senators, represent about 29,000,-
000 people, or less than one-fifth
of the population in 1950. Against
these 25 states there were three
states, New York, California and
Pennsylvania, which had 7,000,000
more people in them than all the
25 combined.
The moral of all this is that
in the Senate, "majority rule"
is not something which all good
men must favor and only reac
tionaries or worse can oppose.
The question of what kind of
majority shall prevail is not
one of simple arithmetic or of
absolute principle but of politi
cal wisdom.
The Johnson amendment to the
rules, which requires at the most
66 votes to pass a controversial
measure, is a reasonable rule.
Legislation could be blocked by
an unending filibuster only if all
the Senators of 17 states partici
pated in it. This would not, as
some have suggested who side
with Senator Douglas, give the
South an absolute veto on legisla
tion to promote the civil rights of
Negroes.
Now legislation which is op
posed by all the states of a whole
section of the country, including
the states which are beginning to
comply with the new principle of
desegregation, is very doubtful
legislation indeed. It promises
more trouble than anything else.
Presumably the Johnson
amendment will be adopted, as
Senator Douglas himself forecast
in his appearance on "Meet the
Press" on Sunday evening. When
it is adopted, it will not stop his
long, persistent and invaluable
labors on behalf of civil rights.
