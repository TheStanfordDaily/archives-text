The first six months of Stan
ford-in-Germany came to a close
Dec. 11 with a farewell dinner in
the library of Strothmann Halle.
For most of us the evening wa-s
one of mixed feelings. A great
many students were looking for
ward to Christmas at home, while
others were anticipating further
travel in Europe.
Nearly all of us felt, however,
that, as a new experiment in edu
cation, Stanford-in-Germany had
been a success in numerous ways.
The reasons for thi-s general feel
ing as well as the relative merits
of the program must be dealt
with separately. But a glimpse of
the last six weeks may give some
idea of the program.
Top Experience
Around the Ist of November we
had one of the most gratifying ex
periences of the entire six
months. The occasion was the
Beutelsbach Yahrmarkt (yearly
market), which dates back to the
Middle Ages when Beutelsbach
was the major town in the Rem
stal.
Little booths were set up all
over town, but the high point of
the week end's festivities was
Dorl'abend (village evening). It
was a time set aside to portray
the everyday life of the village,
with skits and singing by local
groups.
Students Sing
The mayor of Beutelsbach in
vited some students to sing that
evening and secretly rented tra
ditional Swabian costumes for
them.
Either through director Nancy
Maiik's foresightedness or just
by luck, the students sang two
folk songs by Sitcher, a local coin
poser.
These songs plus "Old Black
Joe" and "In the Evening by the
Moonlight" combined with the
Swabian costumes to win a firm
place in the hearts of the Beuteks
bachers for Stanford-in-Germany.
The people so appreciated the
students' gesture that thunderous
applause was insufficient, and
bottles of Remstal wine began to
appear at Stanford-in-Germany's
table as ein geschenk (a gift).
The next several days both Dr.
Farmer and Dr. Strothmann were
told how much the Beutelsbach
ers had enjoyed the students'
singing.
Major Triumph
It was a small incident, but ac
tually Dorfabend was a major tri

umph. The Swabian people are
courteous but quite slow in mak
ing friends, especially with for
eigners.
The Beutelsbachers had been
extremely polite to us, but we
were still on probation until Dorf
abend, when we had the deep
pleasure of being accepted as an
integral part of the life of the vil
lage and being taken into the peo
ple's confidence.
* Our six-day Rome trip, with a
day in Florence, was another ma
jor part of the six months' ex
periences. Dining the two weeks
preceding the trip, Dr. Farmer
taught nothing but Roman and
Florentine architecture. This pre
liminary work made the six days
a profitable field trip.
Learn First hand
Dr. Farmer conducted walking
tours each morning for those in
terested, arid afternoons and eve
nings were free. Many students
wrote their term papers on archi
tectural examples in Rome and
therefore found the trip a stimu
lating experience because of first
hand contact w i t !i the subject
matter.
We also enjoyed finding that
Stanford's fame had spread even
to Florence, where along the Arno
is the Leland Bar. named by its
proprietor after Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford, who once visited his es
tablishment.
Dr. and Mrs. Farmer brought
along a new Stanford banner to
replace the old battered one that
graced a Leland Bar wall.
St. Nikolaus Abend, Dec. 6, we
had the last fest to entertain our
German friends. It was especially
festive, with nothing but candle
light in the library.

The decorations were improvis
ed in one afternoon and consisted
of a tremendous wreath with mis
tletoe in the center, greens, and
Fran Huneke's imaginative paint
ed angels floating across the win
dows.
Sins Carols
Two nights beloie the German
exam about 30 of us picked up
candles and went down to Beu
telsbach for caroling, which i« not
a German custom.
Under the enthusiastic leader
ship of Gabrielle Greer, we walk
ed through the streets and sang
our repertoire of about 10 Christ
mas carols.
Meads appeared at windows and
many BeuU-lsbachers, including
the mayor, came out with wine
and cookies for the frost-bitten
•singers.
Appropriately, we ended up at
tlie Krone, where our first recep
tion by the Beutelsbachers had
been held, and the singing turned
to the many German songs we
had learned.
Farewell Banquet
The final group meeting was at
our farewell banquet. A real Ger
man Christmas atmosphere pre
vailed, with a Christmas tree illu
minated entirely by candles.
There were the usual speeches
and an unusual number of toasts,
reflecting, perhaps, a reluctance
to part with Remstal wine as well
as gratitude to those persons men-
I ioned.
But beneath the sentimentality,
03 students and a few German as
well as the American instructors
were really sorry it was all over
when the first bus left for Stutt
gart at 12:30 a.m. with students
and suitcases.
