# Cornell Seeks Control

Seeking to make student gov
ernment "as effective as pos
sible," Cornell University stu
dents are considering a "strong
central student government, with
the power of review over groups
such as Interfraternity Council,
Cornell Panhellenic and Women's
S t u d ent Government Associa
tion," reports Cornell Daily Sun.
The central group would have
authority to delegate jurisdiction
to student groups and review
their decisions. For example,
under the plan, a change in rush
ing rules would have to be ap

proved by IPC and the central
organizat ion.
Student leaders questioned by
the Sun seemed generally favor
able to the plan, feeling it would
add strength to student govern
ment.
A question as 1o whether the
plan might limit power of groups
(such as IFC) was answered by
Cornell's student council presi
dent this way:
"In reality, only in the case of
a dispute will the student govern
ment organization limit the power
of a constituent group."
