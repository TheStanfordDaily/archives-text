# Up and Down Huskies to Test Indians in Saturday Hoop Tilt
## 
### 
Before the 1958-59 basketball
season opened most of the hoop
experts in ihe Far West and
throughout the eountry tabbed
the VVashington Huskies as the
team to beat on the West Coast
and as one ot the top teams in
the nation.
Since the season opened the
Huskies have taken their share
of lumps as have many of this
year's pre - season basketball fa
vorites. However, even though
the Huskies did not exactly im
press anyone in Ihe first few
weeks ol Ihe season, their 68-G3
whipping of llie UCLA Bruins last
Monday night gave indications
that the Northwesterners were on
their way back toward regaining
some of their pre-season glory.
Three nights before the Hus
kies' win over Ihe Uclans, the
Washington team had dropped
their opening conference game to
Pete Newcll's Cal squad.
Second Step
An altempi at a second step in
Ihe Huskies' rejuvenation pro
gram will come this weekend
when the Washington hoopsters
invade the Stanford Pavilion to
meet the Indians Salurday night
after playing Cal the night be
fore.
Leading ihe Huskies' attack
will be two of Ihe top big men
that the PCC has seen in quite a
while. These two giants, Bruno
I'.oin at 6-9 and Doug Smart at
(ST, lead a squad consisting of
nine letternien.
The "Tree Top Twins," as
Smart and Boin are referred to in
Seat lie, have rounded into one of
the most potent scoring combina
tions of all times. The last year
ihe two played together two sea
sons ago they scored a total of
956 points between them, Smart
averaging I!) points per game and
Boin IS.J).
Others Too
Despite ihe excellent record of
Small and Boin, one shouldn't get
ihe idea that there are no other
worthwhile men on the Washing
ton squad. Marie Irvine, an ex
tremely accurate left - handed
shooter, and Al Murphy, a rough
rebounder, are two other Huskies
that demand watching.
Along with Boin, Smart, Mur
phy and Irvine the Huskies round
out their stalling five with senior
guard John Pariseau, a two-year
veteran.
Right behind the starting five,
Washington Coach Tippy Dye has
fine reserves in Don Daniels and
Lou Coaston, veteran guards, and
John Douglas, a sophomore for
ward.
If Stanford were to place much
faith in comparative scores it

would seem that they really have
their work cut out for them
against the Huskies. The Wash
ington eagers killed Minnesota
over the C hr is t m a s holidays
twice, 85-63 and 73-57, while the
Indians were downed by the Go
phers 72-61.
