# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
An outstanding athlete. Re
ported late after finishing a
great football season. Saw brief
action in 21 games last season.
Has potential as defensive man
and also as fair scorer. Aggres
sive, hard driver. Should make
changeover more rapidly and
can be counted on lf> help
Cards. 6-3, 202.

Has shown tremendous im
provement since coming to
Stanford, and will continue to
show same. Started as regular
last year, but wasn't quite
ready for the job. Saw action in
24 games. Needs strength and
experience. A valuable squad
man, good substitute for Haga.
Good shooting touch. 6-8, 211.
