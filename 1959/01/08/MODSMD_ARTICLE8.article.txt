# IN MEN'S DORMS
## Women on Second Floor Still Open to Question 
### Jack Winkler 
Whether morality for Stanford women is the same on the second
floor as the first is a question which is still up in the air, or up the
stairs, if you will. Specifically, the problem of women going upstairs
in men's residences is in just as much a muddle now as it was last
quarter.
The muddle may be cleared up somewhat this afternoon when the

Social Regulations Committee of
Associated Women Students
meets at 4:15 in Women's Club
house in a discussion open to the
entire campus.
The question was brought into
the open during fall quarter when
a woman student was put on pro
bation for helping her boy friend
wallpaper his room on the second
floor of a fraternity house.
After long discussion AWS Cab
inet approved a statement say
ing, "It is acceptable for a woman
to enter a man's residence so
long as she is not upstairs after
10:30 on week-days or midnight
on weekends, unless further re
stricted by the living area. These
regulations do not apply to regis
tered open houses. Al all times a
woman's conduct must be con
sistent. with the Fundamental
Standard."
According to student sources,
the three Deans said the AWS
proposal is not socially acceptable
and they believe men are not re
sponsible enough to enforce the
regulations.
Today's meeting will try to
make other, more acceptable pro
posals toward liberalizing the reg
ulations which prevent a woman
from going upstairs at any time
other than during an open house.
What probably will result, said
one AWS committee member,
will be a suggestion lo liberalize
the open house policy,
