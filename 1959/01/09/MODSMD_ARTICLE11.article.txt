# LASSU Gives $200 for Debate Team Trip in East
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
In a happy mood after vacation,
Legislature voted to treat one of
Stanford's debate trams to an
Eastern tour, bought new uni
forms for four Stanford police
and discussed its own hostel this
weekend at the first meeting of
1959 Thursday night in Bowman
Alumni Mouse.

With all the newly-elected rep
resentatives in their seats for the
first time, LASSU appropriated
$200 to send a representative two
man team from Stanford's debate
squad, which happens to be one
of the best here in years, to the
Capitol Hill Tournament in Wash
ington and to dual-debate at
schools like Harvard, Holy Cross
and the Military Academy.
The University guaranteed to
put up $400 pending the LASSU
appropriation, so now two debat
ers will be off on an all-expenses
paid jaunt sometime in the
spring.
New Suits
Legislature also gave $61.30 to
I buy new uniforms for four Stan
ford policemen who volunteered
their services to guard the Big
Game bonfire and were sprayed
with ink by local high school stu
dents while on duty. The Univer
sity is paying half the bill here.
Sent into By-Laws Committee
were the new Off-Campus Club
Constitution and the Daily con
stitutional changes. The Off-Cam
pus Club would be an enlarge
ment of the present Off Campus
Men's Club which would permit
women members (i.e., married
women and graduate students),
place most of the power in the
hands of a Board of Directors and
hrng the old constitution up to
date.
Daily Proposals
The Daily changes would make
the managing editor's position ap
pointive. In past years this job
has often become a consolation
prize for the loser in the editor
election and the proposed changes
would try to put a person in the
position who wants the job.
Legislature closed the year's
first meeting by making arrange
ments for its own hostel at Hot
Springs Lodge in Big Sur, a
three-day affair at which Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler will
sneak tonicrht.
