# Mem Aud Full For Address

### Jack Clumeck 
For the first lime in over six
years, President Wallace Sterling
addressed an all-University assem
bly Thursday morning in Memo
rial Auditorium.
Speaking to a crowd of students
and faculty who overflowed the
Auditorium into the Little Thea
ter, Dr. Sterling opened the 1959
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
program with a resume of the or
ganization of Stanford Univer
sity. He then connected this with
the position of colleges in the
United States.
Steve Halsted, chairman of
ST&T, recalled its inception in
1953 with 10 talks to living
groups, and brought the story up
to date by stating that in 1959,
ST&T would present some 40
talks to 70 living groups.
Money Raising?
President Sterling then de
scribed the organization of the
University, the Board of Trustees
and its function. He drew laughs
from his audience when he de
scribed the Planning and Develop
ment Committee, "which is a eu
phemism for 'How to Raise Mon
ey'."
The University President next
sought to answer the questions
most often posed by students in
ST&T sessions. These included
considerations of employing
teachers or research scholars, al
legations that Stanford is "defi
cient in intellectual atmosphere,"
problems of finances, and their in
terrelationships.
Problems Galore
Dr. Sterling cited five problems
which face institutions of higher
education today:
• The great increase in the
number of people seeking a high
ed education today, some 3 million
in all, and double that number in
1970;
• The historically low level of
faculty salaries, stating that real
income for lawyers, industrial
workers and physicians increased
in a range from 29 to 96 per cent
in the period 1910-1956, while fac
ulty members' real incomes in
creased a mere 12 per cent and
professors decreased 5 per cent.
• Inflation-caused problems of
expansion and improvement of
institutions of higher education;
• Scholarship benefits to all
students today, either in the form
of lower tuition rates at state-fi
nanced institutions or by less
than adequate tuition costs at pri
vate schools;
• Research moneys, though
plentiful, more often than not fail
to cover the full cost of the re
search projects undertaken by a
university.
Tougher Standards
To meet these problems, Ster
ling advocated a two-point pro
gram of stiffened entrance re
quirements to keep enrollment
down, and increased realization of
the importance of greater faculty
salaries.
In effect, Sterling cited the
proverb of "starving the goose
that laid the golden eggs" in al
luding to the inadequacy of fac
ulty salaries. He concluded with
the statement that "This crisis,
this problem is to be met only by
a serious and sustained reapprais
al of our own values in the con
text of our concept of human dig
nity and freedom."
