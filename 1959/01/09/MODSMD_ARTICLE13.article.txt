# Tresidder Union Progress Awaits Hiring, Determination, Clarification of Authority
## 
### Walt Wurfel 
After 10 years of sporadic effoit, planning for
the Tresidder Memorial Union is now moving into
high gear.
The Union Board intends to hire a new Union
manager this spring to help co-ordinate and to pro
vide continuity in the planning. "We hope to have
someone to fill the position by June," announced
Prof. John Henry Merryman, chairman of the
Union Board.
The new manager will succeed Miss Christine
Kicker, who retires in March. Miss Ricker has su
pervised the University dining halls in addition to
her duties as Union manager. Her successor will
he released from the dining hall job to take part
in planning for the Tresidder Union.
Peaks, Valleys
"In the past," Prof. Merryman remarked, "there
have been peaks and valleys of planning activity
for the new Union. There has been much duplica
tion of effort in some areas and not enough atten
tion given to others."
No one person has been given ihe responsibility
or has had the time to serve as co ordinator, he as
serted.
A real breakthrough in planning for the Union
will be achieved with the hiring of the new mana
ger', and with the completion of a study to deter
mine the lines of authority between the Univer
sity and the Union Board, Prof. Merryman said.
Right now it isn't clear just who has the final
authority to approve plans for the new union, he
added.
Lack of money for the project has been the
major reason for the failure to push detailed plan
ning. The delay has caused the cost of the project
to climb from an expected $500,000 in 1948 to the
currently estimated $2.0 million.
Two Buildings
Present plans call for the Tresidder Union to bo
composed of two buildings—a recreation pavilion
costing $1.8 million and a student office building
at $800,000. Both will be located west of Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
The fund now stands at almost $1.2 million, the
nearest point to the estimated cost it has reached.
University officials feel now is a good time to try
to bring the project to completion.
Assistant to the President Kenneth M. Cuthbert
son reported the University Trustees decided in
June, 19.">8, that "as soon as a method of financing
the additional costs could be devised and approved
they would then recommend final approval and
construction."
The pavilion is scheduled to be built first, with
the office building to come later as funds are ob
tained.
If it appears that the new Union will operate at
a profit, it is likely, according to Dean of Students

H. Donald Winbigler, that the University would
seek a $600,000 loan to complete financing of the
pavilion.
University officials see several advantages in
this. It will speed construction of the first part of
the Memorial. In addition, the pavilion can be used
by all students, while the office building will main
ly benefit a smaller group—the student officers.
Needed More
The planners also feel the pavilion and is new
facilities are needed more than the office building,
which will be an extension of facilities already
available.
Student Financial Manager Larry Kelley sees
construction of the pavilion first as a method of
dramatizing to the students the advantages of the
entire new nine-building activity complex of which
the Tresidder Union will be only a part.
A fund for the new Union was establshed shortly
after the death, in 1918, of Stanford's fourth presi
dent, Donald B. Tresidder. President Tresidder's
wife and his mother gave the money with the un
derstanding that it be used for the Memorial.
Since then further gifts from Mrs. Tresidder,
other donations, income from investment of the
fund, one dollar a quarter from each tuition fee
and a portion of Union profits have been added to
the fund.
Plans Begun
In 19HG, when the fund had reached $750,000,
President Sterling appointed a committee repre
senting administration, faculty, Union Board and
the ASSU to begin planning. The committee de
cided what facilities should be included in the
Tresidder Union.
President Sterling referred the committee report
to architect and Director of Planning Eldridge T.
Spencer to work out preliminary plans for the
buildings.
Included in the recreation pavilion will be a large
dance floor, a kitchen, a lobby, bowling alleys in
the basement, an office for the Union manager,
dressing rooms and various service rooms. Offices
for the ASSU and other student organizations will
be housed in the smaller building.
These plans are not final. Prof. Merryman em
phasized. If future investigation shows some other
concept to be better, he indicated the present plans
will be changed.
"Once the Union is built the University is
stuck with it. We had better make sure the Union
is what we want before it is built," he said.
Despite intensified planning, completion of the
pavilion will follow the construction go-ahead by
two and a half or three years, according to Assist
ant Director of Planning John Lynd. He said that
architectural plans are still in the preliminary
stages.
