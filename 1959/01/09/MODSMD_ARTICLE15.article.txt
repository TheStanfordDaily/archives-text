1 'i.ams FOR TIIK Tresidder Memorial Union mav. lie moving into
Ii i «x!i pear, as those in charge surest, hut the machinerv -till seeing !
to be too rust\ tor nmeli effeet.
All progress is hin<j;iiifr at the moment on the selection of a new
I nion manager, slated sometime this spring, arnl the determina
tion of the final authority to approve plans for the new I nion.
It's a curious situation that for 10 yours plans for the
I residder Memorial have boon considered, but that for
]() years no one has known icho would hare the final say.
Meanwhile, costs for the proposed building have increased im
mensely. In 1948 it was suggested that half a mil lion dollars would
he a suitable amount for a memorial—though at that time no defi
nite [)lans had been made. Now there is a definite set of plans for
a two-part student union, costing more than two and a half million
dollars, hut construction plans seem to be just as nebulous as they
were 10 years ago.
Construction of the pavilion is first on the agenda. While we
do not completely concur with those who feel that 111 part should
be done first IIKdAUSE the student offices will supposedly benefit
only tlie student officers, we do agree that the pavilion will be of
more immediate value.
There is no building on campus which provides
adequate opportunities for informal gatherings such as
those which could develop after classes or meetings. Ihe
(ellar is noisy and cramped. The \itery gives one the
feeling that it might cave in at any moment.
We see the construction of a student union as relieving sonic
of the social pressures on the Library. \\ bile the number of stu
dents who go to the Library primarily to meet 112 riends or "watch
the girls go by " is not overwhelming,' there are enough of these
people to cause some confusion. The Union will provide a gath
ering place for these and leave the Library to those who actual!)
wish to study in peace.
Lor these reasons we urge that the University place on its top ■
priority list the ironing out of the wrinkles in the I nion Board
and in financing and let us see some KKAL progress.
