# Up or Down? IFC to Meet Dean Today
## 
### 
The up-and-down question,
whether women are to be allowed
on the second floor of men's resi
dences, took a few more ups and
downs today, the final landing
point of which was still on the
level—the first-floor level. But
the project may actually get up
in the air when IFC representa
tives and the Dean of Women get
together in a special meeting this
afternoon.
Social Regulations Committee
of Associated Women Students
met yesterday afternoon to decide
what to do after the Administra
tion had put a hasty but still un
official "no" on its suggestion to
let women roam wherever they
wanted in men's residences up to
10:30 on week-days and midnight
on the weekends.
They decided they could do very
little. Said Chairman Linda Krue
ger, "After the Administration
stand we felt all we could do was
clarify the existing regulation on
a woman's action in a men's resi
dence."
(iiohhleriy-gook
Miss Krueger was referring to
what one University official
called the "biggest piece of gob
bledy-gook I have ever read" -
that clause of Women's Social
Regulations which says, ". . . the
act of entering a men's residence
is neither acceptable nor unac
ceptable."
The new rule just passed by
AWS yesterday reads, "A woman
may enter only the downstairs
social area of a man's residence.
At all times her conduct must be
consistent with the Fundamental
Standard."
IFC Takes Over
Then Interfraternity Council
took over. In their weekly meet
ing last night the '1\ house presi
dents unanimously endorsed the
AWS proposal which had just re
ceived a snub from the Adminis
tration. But to it they added an
enforcement clause — "Enforce
ment of these rules is the mutual
responsibility of the woman to
Women's Council and the man to
his individual fraternity."
Thus armed with a new clause
tacked on to an old suggestion
Bob Davies, Theta Delta Chi, and
Jim Ukropina, Beta Theta Pi, will
meet with Dean of Women Elva
Brown this afternoon and try to
work out some plan acceptable to
everyone.

the project may actually get up
in the air when IFC representa
tives and the Dean of Women get
together in a special meeting this
afternoon.
Social Regulations Committee
of Associated Women Students
met yesterday afternoon to decide
what to do after the Administra
tion had put a hasty but still un
official "no" on its suggestion to
let women roam wherever they
wanted in men's residences up to
10:30 on week-days and midnight
on the weekends.
They decided they could do very
little. Said Chairman Linda Krue
ger, "After the Administration
stand we felt all we could do was
clarify the existing regulation on
a woman's action in a men's resi
dence."
(iiohhleriy-gook
Miss Krueger was referring to
what one University official
called the "biggest piece of gob
bledy-gook I have ever read" -
that clause of Women's Social
Regulations which says, ". . . the
act of entering a men's residence
is neither acceptable nor unac
ceptable."
The new rule just passed by
AWS yesterday reads, "A woman
may enter only the downstairs
social area of a man's residence.
At all times her conduct must be
consistent with the Fundamental
Standard."
IFC Takes Over
Then Interfraternity Council
took over. In their weekly meet
ing last night the '1\ house presi
dents unanimously endorsed the
AWS proposal which had just re
ceived a snub from the Adminis
tration. But to it they added an
enforcement clause — "Enforce
ment of these rules is the mutual
responsibility of the woman to
Women's Council and the man to
his individual fraternity."
Thus armed with a new clause
tacked on to an old suggestion
Bob Davies, Theta Delta Chi, and
Jim Ukropina, Beta Theta Pi, will
meet with Dean of Women Elva
Brown this afternoon and try to
work out some plan acceptable to
everyone.
I Up or down? Heads or tails?
The up-and-down question,
whether women are to be allowed
on the second floor of men's resi
dences, took a few more ups and
downs today, the final landing
point of which was still on the
level—the first-floor level. But
the project may actually get up
in the air when IFC representa
