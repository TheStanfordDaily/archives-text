# JV Hoopsters Meet Oakland
## 
### 
Stanford JV cagers return to
action today against a highly re
garded Oakland JC basketball
squad at 4 p.m. in the Pavilion.
The JV's hope to add two more
wins to their record by whipping
Oakland today and the frosh re
serves tomorrow at 4 p.m. again
preceding varsity and freshman
action.
Tall spire Phil Joujon-Roehe,
Mason Byles and Bill Martin all
figure to help the Tribe JV's in
the two contests.
