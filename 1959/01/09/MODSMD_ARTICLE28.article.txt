# Indians Set to Stop Vandal, Husky Invasion
## 
### John Schwarz 
With the rash of upsets that
have occurred in this short PCC
basketball race this weekend's
games at the Stanford Pavilion
might prove to be key games in
the litle hopes of Stanford, Idaho
and Washington.
The Indians, who dropped two
of three games last week in the
Northwest, find themselves in a
tough spot going into their first
and second home games of the
1959 PCC struggle.
A double defeat over the week
end would just about assure the
Indians that this was not their
year and even one loss would
leave the future picture very
hazy.
On top of Iheir other misfor
tunes of last week. Stanford has
lost the services of G-7 forward
Jerry Thuesen for at least the
month of January. Thuesen, a
good shooter and the most con
sistent foul shot on the Coast, is
recuperating from an attack of
pneumonia and probably won't be
available for duty until the team
heads north at the end of Janu
ary.
Many Crossroads
Both Idaho and Washington, to
night and tomorrow night's oppo
nents respectively, are also at a
crossroads in their basketball
hopes. The Vandals, who beat
Stanford last Saturday night after
being dumped by UCLA the night
before, must prove that their vic
tory over the Indians wasn't a
fluke.
The Idaho hoop.sters employed
an extremely tough defensive
style against the Indians up in
Moscow and will probably use the
same against the Cards in Palo
Alto. Whaylan Coleman, a tough
6-2 guard, will be the man given
the assignment of holding down
Stanford captain and high point
man Paul Neumann. This per
sonal battle between two of the
best guards in the West should
prove almost as good as the battle
between the two best defensive
teams in the league; Idaho has al
lowed only 4G points per game
and Stanford 48.
The Indians will start the same
five who started at Oregon State
last Monday night; Dick Haga at
center, John Hendry and John
Arrillaga at forwards, and Paul

Neumann and Jerry Rose at
guards. This lineup is a little
different than the one which
opened the season for the Cards.
That lineup contained Thuesen
and Doug Warren in place of
Hendry and Rose. Warren has
had ankle ttrouble for the last
few weeks and has had only spot
ty workouts, but he will be ready
to spell Rose if he is called on
this weekend.
Big Road Trip
As far as Washington is con
cerned this is their big road trip
of the year. The Huskies will
move into the Bay Area for Fri
day night's game with Cal and a
Saturday game at Stanford.
The Huskies, the pre - season
choice by almost everyone to
take the Coast championship,
have split in two league battles
so far this year. The Washington
learn has been somewhat of a dis
appointment and would like to

prove its real caliber this week
end.
The Cards, the league's worst
team off the boards, will have no
easy time with the Huskies main
ly due to that reason â€” boards.
The Huskies have a one-two
punch consisting of 6-9 Bruno
Boin and 6-7 Doug Smart that fig
ures to be tops on rebounds.
Stanford Coach Ilowie Dallmar
figures his team will have to
make good on at least 45 per cent
of their shots to stay in against
Washington.
Deliberate Altaik
Dallmar's men will probably
use a very deliberate attack, hop
ing to get the best shots possible.
Along with Boin and Smart,
Tippy Dye's Washington squad
will have A 1 Murphy, a fine re
bounder in his own right, at guard
oi- as the other man up front, with
Earle Irvine and John Pariseau
in the backcourt.
