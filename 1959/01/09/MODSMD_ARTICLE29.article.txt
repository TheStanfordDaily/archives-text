# Novel Gift Idea: Cowboy for Xmas
## 
### Cally Tanner 
"And what do you want for Christmas, little girl?" "A cowboy,
Santa Claus."
This Christmas dream came true for one of Stanford's women ex
change students as she was presented with a whisky-happy gentle
man in a ten-gallon hat, carried out of a Grand Canyon bar.

This was but one of the high
lights of Stanford's foreign ex
change student holiday jaunt, as
29 students and professors spent
the holidays touring Grand Can
yon, Bryce and Zion National
Parks and spreading international
good will en route.
The group left Stanford Dec. 20
under arrangements made by the
Host Committee of the Institute
of International Relations. They
first visited Disneyland and the
20th Century-Fox Studios in Los
Angeles, and then went on to
Needles, where they were dinner
guests of the Chamber of Com
merce.
At Morro Bay, St. George, Utah,
and Tehachapi the group enjoyed
community hospitality, being
warmly welcomed into private
homes.
Song Fests
But they didn't just stay on the
receiving end of things. Some
members of the group sang Ger
man and Japanese songs for the
students at the liopi Indian Reser
vation in Arizona, who also en
joyed seeing Miss Dasiova's sari
from Ceylon. They repeated their
entertainment acts in St. George,
and again in Tehachapi.
Arriving at Grand Canyon on
Christmas Eve, they celebrated in
high style. It was of particular
interest to those who were non-
Christian to see Christmas cele
brated, and those from other
Christian countries enjoyed see
ing American holiday traditions.
The snowfall at Bryce Canyon
was also a "first" for some of the
students, and Lorna Bollman, a
graduate student from Australia,
decided it was one of the nicest
parts of the trip.
Rock 'n' Roll
According to Tony V o o gd ,
group leafier and head of the Host
Committee, the rock 'n' roll party,
arranged by Mayor Valdes in Te
hachapi, was another highlight.
It seems they were expecting a
younger group and had set the
stage for real action.
Tired of bus travel and very
much impressed with the size of
this country, the group returned
to Stanford on Jan. 1. They
agreed that the sights were won
derful, and were also very much
impressed with the friendly atti
tudes of the people they met,
particularly in the smaller towns.
