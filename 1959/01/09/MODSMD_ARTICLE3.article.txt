# LIQUOR LAW
## Women Will right Limit Amendment 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Opposition to a proposed
change in state law which now
bans liquor sales within 1 ',<> miles
of Stanford is expected to be
voiced this morning by a group of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park church
women.
The non-denominational Coun
cil of United Church Women, con
sisting of representatives from 23
churches in the two cities, will
meet at 10:30 in St. Mark's Epis
copal Church, Palo Alto.
Mrs. Ray Ruppel, president of
the council, told The Daily she
expects the group to draft letters
to Stanford, State Assemblyman
Clark Bradley and local newspa
pers expressing opposition to
Bradley's proposed amendment,
which would make the present
limit permanent regard
less of future expansion of Stan
ford boundaries.
New Boundaries
Bradley proposed the amend
ment when it was disclosed that
nine Palo Alto establishments
face loss of liquor licenses next
Sepember when Stanford bounda
ries expand. The new boundaries
will come into effect with occu
pancy of married student housing
units now under construction in
the southeast part of the campus.
The new boundaries would
push the 1%-mile limit beyond
the nine stores, bars and restau
rants. The Alcoholic Beverage
Commission would then have no
choice but to revoke the establish
ments' liquor licenses.
Another Han
An alternative to freezing the
present limit would be to create
new limits each time University
boundaries were changed, but to
permit establishments operating
at the time of a limit change to
continue in business.
Mrs. Ruppel said she couldn't
say just what specific recommen
dation the council would make,
but indicated that they would
probably be favorable to the lat
ter amendment. Echoing previ
ously - expressed sentiments of
University officials, she said that
"nobody wants to see existing
businesses pushed out."
Nothing Special
Mrs. Ruppel emphasized, how
ever, that she did not think "one
should change the laws to bene
fit a certain type." She stressed
that she and the council were anx
ious to uphold what they feel is
best for Palo Alto and the Uni
versity this presumably includ
ing keeping liquor sales as far
from the campus as possible.
Some time ago, the council tried
to have the 1 Mi-mile limit meas
ured from the extremities of all
Stanford lands, but lost that fight
when the boundary was estab
lished around only those parcels
of land included in the actual edu
cational plant.

from the campus as possible.
Some time ago, the council tried
to have the 1 Mi-mile limit meas
ured from the extremities of all
Stanford lands, but lost that fight
when the boundary was estab
lished around only those parcels
of land included in the actual edu
cational plant.
Opposition to a proposed
change in state law which now
bans liquor sales within 1 ',<> miles
of Stanford is expected to be
voiced this morning by a group of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park church
women.
The non-denominational Coun
cil of United Church Women, con
sisting of representatives from 23
churches in the two cities, will
meet at 10:30 in St. Mark's Epis
copal Church, Palo Alto.
Mrs. Ray Ruppel, president of
the council, told The Daily she
expects the group to draft letters
to Stanford, State Assemblyman
Clark Bradley and local newspa
pers expressing opposition to
Bradley's proposed amendment,
which would make the present
limit permanent regard
less of future expansion of Stan
ford boundaries.
New Boundaries
Bradley proposed the amend
ment when it was disclosed that
nine Palo Alto establishments
face loss of liquor licenses next
Sepember when Stanford bounda
ries expand. The new boundaries
will come into effect with occu
pancy of married student housing
units now under construction in
the southeast part of the campus.
The new boundaries would
push the 1%-mile limit beyond
the nine stores, bars and restau
rants. The Alcoholic Beverage
Commission would then have no
choice but to revoke the establish
ments' liquor licenses.
Another Han
An alternative to freezing the
present limit would be to create
new limits each time University
boundaries were changed, but to
permit establishments operating
at the time of a limit change to
continue in business.
Mrs. Ruppel said she couldn't
say just what specific recommen
dation the council would make,
but indicated that they would
probably be favorable to the lat
ter amendment. Echoing previ
ously - expressed sentiments of
University officials, she said that
"nobody wants to see existing
businesses pushed out."
Nothing Special
Mrs. Ruppel emphasized, how
ever, that she did not think "one
should change the laws to bene
fit a certain type." She stressed
that she and the council were anx
ious to uphold what they feel is
best for Palo Alto and the Uni
versity this presumably includ
ing keeping liquor sales as far
from the campus as possible.
