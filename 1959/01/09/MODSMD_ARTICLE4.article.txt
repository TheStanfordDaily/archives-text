# Wild Havana Welcome for Conquerors

### 
HAVANA, Cuba (/P) — Joyous
Havana gave a tumultuous wel
come Thursday to Fidel Castro,
bearded conquering hero of the
Cuban revolution.
The 32-year-old warrior entered
the capital just a week from the
day his 26th of July movement
tumbled the dictatorship of Ful
gencio Batista.
Surprise Move
In a last-minute surprise move,
Castro left his motorcade ap
proaching the capital from the
east and landed by helicopter in
an eastern suburb. Word that he
was coming spread like wildfire
and Havana residents poured into
the streets.
Castro's open vehicle was sur
rounded by armored cars, tanks
and other vehicles. Horns honked
incessantly, mingling with the
roars of the people on foot. Im
promptu military bands in big
trucks poured out martial music.
Castro's warriors smiled broad
ly as they waved their rifles at
the crowd, and posed for pictures.
Confetti rained upon the rebel
soldiers. For many it was their
first visit to the glittering me
tropolis.
Near-Holiday
Practically all business in Ha
vana came to a standstill. Labor
Confederation leaders told all
workers to turn out en masse for
the welcoming ceremony.
Watchful militiamen patrolled
the capital's streets. All liquor
shops were closed to prevent the
celebration from getting out of
hand.
The civilian • clad militia has
been performing all police duties
in Havana since shortly after Ba
tista fled New Year's Day. The
police have been disarmed and a
national police reorganization is
reported in progress.
It is reported that one of Cas
tro's first goals after taking over
as Provisional President Manuel
Urrutia's military delegate—in ef
fect, commander-in-chief —will be
to disarm the militia.
