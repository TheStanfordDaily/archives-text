"Stanford is now recognized na
tionally as one of the great uni
versities of the world," said Pres
idential Assistant Kenneth Cuth
bertson Thursday. Evidence of
Stanford's eminence are a "stu
dent body virtually second to
none" and, perhaps most impor
tant, the high quality faculty of
the University.
Cuthbertson was one of 10
speaking in f r e s h m a n living
groups after dinner Thursday to
begin the series of administration
student discussions in the Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow pro
gram.
Undergraduate Program
Himself a Stanford alumnus
('40), Cuthbertson said the Uni
versity's undergraduate program,
which gives undergrads a chance
for "close work with faculty also
doing research at the graduate
level," is one reason for the high
rating.
Ho pointed out that the General
Studies Committee has effected a
greater integration of the first
and second two years of under
graduate work. The program of
the University is constantly under
review, he said, citing the quick
action on Stanford-in-Germanyâ€”
six months from the first thought
of the innovation to the departure
of the first plane load of students.
Tuition Raise?
Cuthbertson mentioned planned
bu i 1 d i n g expenditures totaling
millions, but emphasized, in re
sponse to an anxious freshman's
question, that administrators
were not planning a tuition raise
for at. least another two years.
Asked to attempt to character
ize "good teaching," mentioned
by President Wallace Sterling in
his all-University address Thurs
day morning, Cuthbertson said
that the good teacher stimulates
the inquisitiveness of his stu
dents.
He said that the Stanford ad
ministration at all levels is mak
ing a conscious effort to reward
good teaching, even though good
teaching is not so easy to define
or recognize as outstanding re
search.
