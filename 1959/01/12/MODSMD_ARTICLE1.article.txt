# New Lab Dedicated; Cancer Progress Told

"No people can do all we must
make choices, and when I see
a new laboratory, I see a wise
choice," Dr. Detlev W. Bronk told
an audience of distinguished sci
entists in a speech that concluded
a day of activities officially open
ing Stanford's new $124,000 bio
physics laboratory.
Bronk, president of the Rocke
feller Institute for Medical Re
search, suggested: "'New labora
tories should be considered as
modern temples seeking truth."
He was introduced by President
Wallace Sterling and explained
biophysics as a synthesis of sci
ences "that have become separat
ed by specialization." Biophysics
is a combination of biology and
medicine, physics, physical chem
istry and electronics.
"The need of modern science is
for an understanding between
sciences," Bronk, who is also pres
ident of the National Academy of
Sciences, continued. He lauded
Stanford's leadership in science
and praised the foresight of mov

ing the Stanford Medical School
to campus.
Bronk said, "The most impor
tant function of biophysics is a
guide for our uses of science with
regard to human values."
Earlier in the day a progress re
port on research conducted by the
biophysics department was given
including a talk by Dr. Henry S.
Kaplan on recent developments in
the treatment of cancer by Stan
ford's Mark IV linear accelerator.
Kaplan, who is head of the Radi
ology Department, will be in
charge of the research program
in the new laboratory.
Kaplan explained that in treat
ing cancer with, electrons, the
electrons hit a target creating X
rays which in some instances kill
the cancer. Stanford's biophysics
research has devised a method to
eliminate the target and apply
the electrons directly.
Benefits of this direct applica
tion of electrons to cancerous tis
sues include:
• Reaching deeper into the
flesh with the electrons.
• Controlling the depth of pen
etration by varying the amount

of the voltage— something not
possible with the X ray method.
• The electrons when applied
directly diffuse over a wider area
than do X-rays.
• Because of the greater con
trol there is less damage to tis
sues that aren't meant to he ex
posed to the treatment. giving
greater comfort to the patient.
Stanford plans to apply elec
trons in doses to cancerous tis
sues from 10 to 70 mevs (million
electron volts) with the Mark IV
linear accelerator. Kaplan said
this program will move slowly
and the benefits, if any, of higher
doses will be analyzed carefully.
So far patients have been treated
with 30 mevs.
In all, nine cancer patients have
been treated by the new method
since May, but Kaplan said there
hasn't been sufficient time to de
termine the effectiveness of the
new method. He added that in
some cases there had been retro
gression, but said this was to be
expected.
Kaplan explained that the new
treatment would probably be used
as a supplement to X-ray treat

ment of career, and "no funda
mental differences a'-e expected."
The new biophysics laboratory
will also house research on X-ray
microscope development, radia
tion physics, cell physiology and
the biological role of free radicals
(unstable, highly active molecu
lar fragments i.
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, cowinncr
of the 19.")K Nobel Prize in medi
cine, will also have a laboratory
in the new building until his labo
ratory is completed in the new
Medical School. He is expected
to join the staff about Feb. 1.
Microscope development in the
new laboratory is under the direc
tion of Dr. How ard Pat tee, Jr. The
researchers are working on in
struments to improve the obser
vation and chemical analysis of
structures within the single cells.
Four instruments are under de
velopment.
Other investigators include
Drs. Marsdan S. Blois, Jr., Victor
W. Burns, Robert Loevinger and
Mitehel Weissbluth.
Administratively, the labora
tory is part of the W. W. Hansen
Laboratories of Physics.
