# Baby Steps

### 
Akf. we rf.ai.ly becoming educated? Or are we absorbing names
and dates between runs to classes? These are two of the questions
which are getting more and more attention in these days of con
centrated study on American education.
Since the first Russian Sputnik, Americans have become more
and more concerned over the quality of teaching and of learning.
Much of the concern has been directed at science, but here at
Stanford it is the over-all problem of higher education which is
being studied.
Stanford Logan its intensive effort to find improve
ments long before the. American public became involved
in tin- furor over the Space Age. And the movement has
been rolling toward a virtually complete revamping of
the Stanford educational system —from admissions,
through housing, to graduate study.
The General Studies Program is the first obvious achievement
—but it is an ever-changing plan, tlie ramifications of which
remain to be seen.
This week in The Daily there is to be a series of articles show
ing the progress of the General Studies Committee in its attempts
to develop a workable plan in which young men and women will,
tn quote the committee's statement, attain the following goals:
"To achieve breadth of knowledge„ depth of knoivl
edge, and to develop one s interests and abilities and
clarify one's values."
That«all has not been accomplished is obvious from the ever
increasing rumblings from students and faculty alike—but that
the rumblings are increasing does not necessarily mean things are
getting worse. It means that all concerned are becoming more
conscious of the shortcomings and, instead of sitting hack and
waiting, are willing to give the situation critical thought and to
propose solutions.
The intensification of thought on the problems in
volved in higher education is to the credit of students
and faculty, and real progress is being made. —in the ex
pansion of honors programs and independent study; in
attempts to reduce the amount of busy work, and so on.
However, it is not enough to say changes will take place "as
soon as possible," or some other similarly vague phrase. Exten
sion of honors programs in some departments has been set defi
nitely for next year. Of the elimination, or at least reduction, of
the number of mid-terms—which is finding support in many quar
ters—we have heard neither "Aye" or "Nay.' And such plans as
the latter are the easiest to implement if found desirable.
Progress has been made this we do not doubt, lint
has the progress been as fast as it could be without sacri
ficing quality to speed? lias the progress been concen
trated too much im the big problems, and has it leJ the
smaller, seemingly insignificant questions be pushed
aside?
We think the answer to the first question is NO, progress has
not gone as fast as it could reasonably he expected to. In the
meantime, for example, overlapping in part with the original
period of the Study on Undergraduate Education (1954-56) has
been the construction of Wilbur and Moore halls and the wings
of Stern. This construction in many places has resulted in wasted
space and effort, and certainly does not fulfill the role of residence
in an education-oriented university as it lias finally come to be
recognized.
As to the second question, just where the line is to be drawn
between the smaller question as an integral part of the whole is
hard to determine, hut it would appear that many of the smaller
questions have indeed been set aside—questions for which there
are small answers.
Both immediate and long-range solutions need, of course,
careful study. We do not advocate taking giant steps in one
push to get where we're going: here we oppose those who want
to see massive changes effective immediately, lint we feel the
University is too inclined to restrict itself to middle-sized steps,
when baby steps could be very effective toward eventual solutions.
