# Study Reflects Educational Unrest

(Editor's Note: This is the
first of a series of articles on
general education at Stanford
that grew out of conversations
with members of the General
Studies Committe. They repre
sent the author's impressions,
and are not to be construed as
an "official" statement of the
University or the General Stud
ies Committee.)

A considered look at the Stan
ford Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation, undertaken August 1954
o September 1950, and the pres
ent work of the General Studies
Committee, emphasizes the enor

mous ramifications of general ed
ucation at Stanford.
Impetus for the study came
from several quarters, anil re
flected a general uneasiness that
Stanford had not only lost a posi
tion of national leadership in un
dergraduate education, but might
even soon fall behind a college ed
ucational average.
Dissatisfaction was localized in,
but not limited to, the outmoded
Lower Division Upper Division
system.
President Wallace Sterling's ini
tial communication to the faculty
emphasized that the study would
consider all problems relevant to
undergraduate education.

It formulated more precise con
siderations as: "What can be done
to increase the effectiveness of
undergraduate teaching? . . .
What steps can be taken to im
prove the intellectual motivation
of Stanford undergraduates? . . .
What changes in curriculum an
needed?"
As the study progressed, its
committees also considered such
matters as admissions policy, the
lecture system and the organiza
tion of formal instruction.
The curriculum aspect of the
inquiry resulted in what most
Stanford students probably think
of when "general education" is
mentioned 011 this campus: the

General Studies Program.
Robert Hoopes and Hubert Mar
shall's "The Undergraduate in the
University" (Stanford University
Press, 1957) is a remarkably hon
:>st and provocative case history
of the study.
Apart from curriculum changes
implemented in the General Stud
ies Program, the study has had
at least two significant results.
First, the administration, and
most notably the office of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, has become not only fa
vorable but enthusiastic about a
co-ordinated effort to cope with
such problems of undergraduate
education as student motivation,
quality of teaching, and the ex
tension of "general education" to
a University-wide atmosphere.
Concern about these things cer
tainly existed before August 1951,
but it seems to have been a frag
mented and, to those who were
"the concerned," frequently dis
couraging business.
The present widespread atmos
phere of interested questioning
makes individual faculty and stu
dent efforts more effective, and
thus more likely.
Secondly, the Stanford Study
had the outstanding vision to
found the General Sudies Com
mittee, which ensures that issues
of undergraduate education ;ii
Stanford will not bo shelved, witli
a sigh of relief, for another gen
eration.
Since autumn 1956 the commit
tee has been grappling wilh prob
lems not satisfactorily followed
through by the study itself, and
with new concerns as well. Spe
cifically academic problems are
prominent in its concern, but the
committee has also been influ
ential in such areas as public

events, student - faculty relations
and undergraduate housing.
Present members of the com
mittee are Robert A. Walker,
chairman (political science; Wil
liam C. Bark, executive secretary
(history); Philip H. JRhinelander
(philosophy and Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences); Joseph M. Pettit (electri
cal engineering and Dean of the
School of Engineering); Albert H.
Bowker (statistics and mathemat
ics and Dean of the Graduate Di
vision); Virgil T. Whitaker (Eng
lish ); Brooks Otis (classics); Rob
ert R. Sears (psychology),
