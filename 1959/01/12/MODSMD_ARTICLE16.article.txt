# President's Committee Airs Problems of Honors Work
## 
### Barbara Hicks Editor 
The desire, capacity and oppor
tunity for independent study at
Stanford were given a rigorous
review at the December meeting
of the president's Student-Faculty
Advisory Committee 011 Academic
Affairs.
The committee, which will meet
again Jan. 21 to continue its dis
cussion on honors programs and
independent study, intends to for
mulate its ideas into concrete pro
posals to present to the Univer
sity committees which will set
the actual policy.
It was suggested that students
fall into three categories within
the University. There are those
who are simply working toward
a degree in order to obtain the
prestige of a Stanford diploma.
Second Group
The second group thinks it
wants more independent work but
does not necessarily have the
background or motivation to do
the caliber of work which would
be required.
In the third category are those
who clearly have the background,
interest and capacity to do exten
sive independent work.
The difficulty in formulating
honors programs and independent
work lies in stimulating the sec
ond group, while not putting
binds on the third. As a start, it
would appear that honors pro
grams must be directed toward
the third group only, with an eye
to eventual expansion.
The committee turned to the
discussion of the problem of how
to determine who is to participate
in honors programs and independ
ent study.
Plan of Action
A suggested plan of action was
as follows:
1. Obtain the recommendation

of faculty—either at the student's
or the faculty member's initiative
—at the end of the sophomore
year.
2. Submit a thoughtful essay
which would indicate writing
capability.
3. Have a personal interview
with the faculty member in
charge.
4. Consider grade average.
The grade average was proba
bly the most controversial cri
terium suggested, and students
generally agreed that the grade
average should be flexible, with
more weight given to the per
sonal interview.
Members of the committee also
expressed concern over the "smor
gasbord" effect of the number of
classes and overloading of units
by students; and the difficulty of
doing justice to an honors pro
gram because of regular course
and assignment requirements.
Student Reports
The bases for the December dis
cussions were student-initiated re
ports on the agenda items. The

value of these reports and the en
suing discussion are somewhat in
tangible. Even though the com
mittee hopes to formulate con
crete proposals, the bulk of the
student ideas- which they seem
ed to feel were unique to the stu
dents has already been put in
"black and white" by the faculty
and administration. Definite plans
for expansion of honors programs
in several departments are only
awaiting financial go-ahead.
With the University plans in
mind, it is difficult to determine
the value of the student discus
sion. The student ideas do show
lhat the concern does not rest en
tirely with the faculty, and that
the faculty probably is not under
estimating the potential of the
students for more independent
work.
