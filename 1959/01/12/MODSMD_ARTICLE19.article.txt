# OUTSIDE SHOOTING BIG FACTOR
## Cards Tip Idaho, Stun Huskies 
### John Schwarz 
Stanford basketball coach Howie Dallmar pulled several tricks
out of his hat to help pull his fired-up Stanford squad through a cru
cail weekend in their flight for the PCC basketball crown.
Friday night the Indians, with a strong second half, downed a
pesky Idaho team, 50-30, and on Saturday night the Indians came
back to nip a tall Washington squad, 51-49.
In Friday's encounter the Stanford hoopsters had to shake
off an early case of cold hands, which had held their shooting per
centage down to 22 in the first half, to beat a tight, defensive Idaho
squad.
The first half started off like a repeat of the Vandal Indian game
which took place up in Idaho only a week before in which both teams
did little scoring but much defensive work with the final count
coming to 30-31 in Idaho's favor.
After 17 minutes of play in the first half the score was knotted
up at 13-13 and only a last-minute flurry of baskets brought the
count to 17 all at half.
Tribe Pulls Ahead
The Indians, who in the past have had troubles trying to score
in the opening moments of the second half, forgot their past expe
riences and went right to work pulling ahead of the Vandals as the
half-time intermission ended. After three minutes of play in the
second half center Dick Haga tossed in a foul shot to give Stanford
a 22-21 lead and from then on there didn't seem to be much doubt
that the Indians were on their way.
The Idaho victory was a strong team effort by the Cards which
is well brought out in the scoring figures. Three of the Indian play
ers hit in double figures: Dick Haga with 11, John Arrillaga with
14, and Paul Neumann with 10.
On Saturday night the Dallmarmen found themselves involved in
a real tight battle, one which they managed to squeak by by one
basket over a Washington squad that almost came back after being
down five points with only a little over a minute left in the game.
The game started off with the two teams trading baskets back
and forth and continued this way through the majority of the first
half. With about four minutes left in the first half, Stanford splurged
ahead by five mainly on the work of John Arrillaga who tossed in
a foul shot and two quick jump shots one of which appeared to
come from an almost impossible position and with two Huskies hang
ing on Arrillaga.
It didn't take the Huskies long in the opening minutes of the
second half to eradicate the majority of the Stanford five-point half
time lead. With only three minutes gone in that second half, Ihe
Huskies had fought back to within a point of the Indians.
It was at this point in the game that Stanfor d coach Howie Dall
mar pulled his big gamble of the night. Dallmar sent in his second
unit in hopes that they could wear down the Huskies and give his
own first team the rest he knew they would need if the game were
going to stay close right down to the wire.
Second Team Kept Lead
Not only did this team of Mike Tipton, John Stabler, Chris Bur
ford, Jerry Rose and Tom Crawford wear down the Huskies but they
also added a point to the Stanford lead during the seven minutes
they played.
The first team then returned and gradually regained Ihe five
point lead it had held at half-time. It appeared the Cards would
walk away with the win when there was only a minute and a half to
go in the game and Stanford had its five-point lead.
But at this point the Huskies came to life. Smart hit on two foul
shots, and when the Cards tried to freeze out the last minute George
Grant stole the ball, went the distance of the court and brought the
team to within a bucket of the lead.
With 35 seconds to go Stanford failed to cross the 10-seeond line
in time and the Huskies had an opportunity to tie the score. John
Arrillaga then pulled a key play when he intercepted a Husky pass.
Arrillaga was promptly fouled and when he missed the shot Ihe
Huskies moved back up court with now only 15 seconds to go. A
scramble ensued under the Washington offensive basket and Die
buzzer rang just after Smart was called for walking.

The game started off with the two teams trading baskets back
and forth and continued this way through the majority of the first
half. With about four minutes left in the first half, Stanford splurged
ahead by five mainly on the work of John Arrillaga who tossed in
a foul shot and two quick jump shots one of which appeared to
come from an almost impossible position and with two Huskies hang
ing on Arrillaga.
It didn't take the Huskies long in the opening minutes of the
second half to eradicate the majority of the Stanford five-point half
time lead. With only three minutes gone in that second half, Ihe
Huskies had fought back to within a point of the Indians.
It was at this point in the game that Stanfor d coach Howie Dall
mar pulled his big gamble of the night. Dallmar sent in his second
unit in hopes that they could wear down the Huskies and give his
own first team the rest he knew they would need if the game were
going to stay close right down to the wire.
Second Team Kept Lead
Not only did this team of Mike Tipton, John Stabler, Chris Bur
ford, Jerry Rose and Tom Crawford wear down the Huskies but they
also added a point to the Stanford lead during the seven minutes
they played.
The first team then returned and gradually regained Ihe five
point lead it had held at half-time. It appeared the Cards would
walk away with the win when there was only a minute and a half to
go in the game and Stanford had its five-point lead.
But at this point the Huskies came to life. Smart hit on two foul
shots, and when the Cards tried to freeze out the last minute George
Grant stole the ball, went the distance of the court and brought the
team to within a bucket of the lead.
With 35 seconds to go Stanford failed to cross the 10-seeond line
in time and the Huskies had an opportunity to tie the score. John
Arrillaga then pulled a key play when he intercepted a Husky pass.
Arrillaga was promptly fouled and when he missed the shot Ihe
Huskies moved back up court with now only 15 seconds to go. A
scramble ensued under the Washington offensive basket and Die
buzzer rang just after Smart was called for walking.

Towering Huskies weren't able to contain Stanford sharpshooter
Stanford basketball coach Howie Dallmar pulled several tricks
out of his hat to help pull his fired-up Stanford squad through a cru
cail weekend in their flight for the PCC basketball crown.
Friday night the Indians, with a strong second half, downed a
pesky Idaho team, 50-30, and on Saturday night the Indians came
back to nip a tall Washington squad, 51-49.
In Friday's encounter the Stanford hoopsters had to shake
off an early case of cold hands, which had held their shooting per
centage down to 22 in the first half, to beat a tight, defensive Idaho
squad.
The first half started off like a repeat of the Vandal Indian game
which took place up in Idaho only a week before in which both teams
did little scoring but much defensive work with the final count
coming to 30-31 in Idaho's favor.
After 17 minutes of play in the first half the score was knotted
up at 13-13 and only a last-minute flurry of baskets brought the
count to 17 all at half.
Tribe Pulls Ahead
The Indians, who in the past have had troubles trying to score
in the opening moments of the second half, forgot their past expe
riences and went right to work pulling ahead of the Vandals as the
half-time intermission ended. After three minutes of play in the
second half center Dick Haga tossed in a foul shot to give Stanford
a 22-21 lead and from then on there didn't seem to be much doubt
that the Indians were on their way.
The Idaho victory was a strong team effort by the Cards which
is well brought out in the scoring figures. Three of the Indian play
ers hit in double figures: Dick Haga with 11, John Arrillaga with
14, and Paul Neumann with 10.
On Saturday night the Dallmarmen found themselves involved in
a real tight battle, one which they managed to squeak by by one
basket over a Washington squad that almost came back after being
down five points with only a little over a minute left in the game.
The game started off with the two teams trading baskets back
and forth and continued this way through the majority of the first
half. With about four minutes left in the first half, Stanford splurged

Towering Huskies weren't able to contain Stanford sharpshooter
Stanford basketball coach Howie Dallmar pulled several tricks
out of his hat to help pull his fired-up Stanford squad through a cru
cail weekend in their flight for the PCC basketball crown.
Friday night the Indians, with a strong second half, downed a
pesky Idaho team, 50-30, and on Saturday night the Indians came
back to nip a tall Washington squad, 51-49.
In Friday's encounter the Stanford hoopsters had to shake
off an early case of cold hands, which had held their shooting per
centage down to 22 in the first half, to beat a tight, defensive Idaho
squad.
The first half started off like a repeat of the Vandal Indian game
which took place up in Idaho only a week before in which both teams
did little scoring but much defensive work with the final count
coming to 30-31 in Idaho's favor.
After 17 minutes of play in the first half the score was knotted
up at 13-13 and only a last-minute flurry of baskets brought the
count to 17 all at half.
Tribe Pulls Ahead
The Indians, who in the past have had troubles trying to score
in the opening moments of the second half, forgot their past expe
riences and went right to work pulling ahead of the Vandals as the
half-time intermission ended. After three minutes of play in the
second half center Dick Haga tossed in a foul shot to give Stanford
a 22-21 lead and from then on there didn't seem to be much doubt
that the Indians were on their way.
The Idaho victory was a strong team effort by the Cards which
is well brought out in the scoring figures. Three of the Indian play
ers hit in double figures: Dick Haga with 11, John Arrillaga with
14, and Paul Neumann with 10.
On Saturday night the Dallmarmen found themselves involved in
a real tight battle, one which they managed to squeak by by one
basket over a Washington squad that almost came back after being
down five points with only a little over a minute left in the game.
The game started off with the two teams trading baskets back
and forth and continued this way through the majority of the first
half. With about four minutes left in the first half, Stanford splurged
ahead by five mainly on the work of John Arrillaga who tossed in
a foul shot and two quick jump shots one of which appeared to
come from an almost impossible position and with two Huskies hang
ing on Arrillaga.
It didn't take the Huskies long in the opening minutes of the
second half to eradicate the majority of the Stanford five-point half
time lead. With only three minutes gone in that second half, Ihe
Huskies had fought back to within a point of the Indians.
It was at this point in the game that Stanfor d coach Howie Dall
mar pulled his big gamble of the night. Dallmar sent in his second
unit in hopes that they could wear down the Huskies and give his
own first team the rest he knew they would need if the game were
going to stay close right down to the wire.
Second Team Kept Lead
Not only did this team of Mike Tipton, John Stabler, Chris Bur
ford, Jerry Rose and Tom Crawford wear down the Huskies but they
also added a point to the Stanford lead during the seven minutes
they played.
The first team then returned and gradually regained Ihe five
point lead it had held at half-time. It appeared the Cards would
walk away with the win when there was only a minute and a half to
go in the game and Stanford had its five-point lead.
But at this point the Huskies came to life. Smart hit on two foul
shots, and when the Cards tried to freeze out the last minute George
Grant stole the ball, went the distance of the court and brought the
team to within a bucket of the lead.
With 35 seconds to go Stanford failed to cross the 10-seeond line
in time and the Huskies had an opportunity to tie the score. John
Arrillaga then pulled a key play when he intercepted a Husky pass.
Arrillaga was promptly fouled and when he missed the shot Ihe
Huskies moved back up court with now only 15 seconds to go. A
scramble ensued under the Washington offensive basket and Die
buzzer rang just after Smart was called for walking.
