### Sarah Lawrence 
Dr. Edward Lipinski, president
of the Polish Economic Society
and professor at the University of
Warsaw, visited the Stanford
campus Thursday and Friday. He
is touring colleges to become ac
quainted with the methods and
contents of economic studies in
the United States and the practi
cal application of economic prin
ciples. He is also a member of
the Polish Academy of Science.
Lipinski especially noted the
contrast between European and
American universities. "The first
thing a foreign visitor to an
American university such as
Stanford notices is the big differ
ence in equipment. The laborato
ries and facilities are not to be
compared."
"However, the main difference
one notices is that professors and
students are closer to the univer
sity and to each other. I like Ihe
custom of professors dining to
gether in such places as the Un
ion. I also like the expansion of
directed reading programs in
courses for extra credit. I would
like to see more of it in European
universities."
Dr. Lipinski also mentioned the
difference between P'nglish as it
is spoken in England and English
spoken by Americans. "I have al
ways been used to hearing ac
cents and idiomatic expressions
which are very distinct from
those spoken in the United
States."

He is visiting the U.S. as a
guest of Ford Foundation and the
Institute of International Educa
tion. He returns to Poland in one
more week.
