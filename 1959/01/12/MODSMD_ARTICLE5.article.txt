## Excellent Music Duo Performs 
### Herb Harwick 
The recital team of Eve Heinetz
and Alice Ehlers certainly lived
up to its excellent reputation last
Friday night, when, before a full
house at Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
they provided a rare opportunity
to hear some of the long-neglected
masterpieces of the Baroque era,
performed on the instruments for
which they were originally com
posed.
The program, consisting of
works by Bach, Abel. Couporin
and Marais, commenced with the
Sonata in D major by Bach for
viola da g;imba and harpsichord.
The listener was immediately
struck with the perfect ensemble
of the two players, the meticulous
technique of Miss Ehlers on the
clavier always maintaining its
vivacity and the delicate, unro
manticized sonorities produced
by Miss Ileinetz.
Miss Ileinetz, a member of the
University of Washington's fac
ulty, played a very rewarding solo
piece by Karl Friedrich Abel; full
of double and triple stops flaw
lessly executed, Miss Heinetz
communicated the intensity of the
work while never lapsing into
pedant ry.
Truly the highlight of the eve
ning, however, was the suite of
"Pieces en Concert" by Francois
Couperin. The Sicilienne was de
lightful, was played with excep
tional tenderness, and the Air du
Diable, though a little over-seri
ous, convincing.
Miss Ehlers, professor of music
at both Washington and USC,
played a beautifully clear Chro
matic Fantasy and Fugue (Bach).
