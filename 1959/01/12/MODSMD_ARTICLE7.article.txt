# NEW RESOLUTION
## Church Women Call for Closing 9 Liquor Stores 
### 
N'ine Palo Alto liquor establish
ments will ho out of business in
September if the Council of Unit
ed Church Women has its way.
The group, composed of repre
sentatives from 23 mid-Peninsula
churches, unanimously passed a
resolution Friday calling for no
amendmens or changes in an ex
isting state law which prohibits
sale of liquor within 1 '2 miles of
the boundary of any university.
Stanford boundaries are slated
to move in September when new

student housing units become oc
cupied. To protect the nine estab
lishments which are within what
will be the new IVa-mile limit,
State Assemblyman Clark Brad
ley and State Senator Jack
Thompson have proposed amend
ing the present law.
Stanford officials have indicat
ed no objection to the proposal.
The chief point of dispute thus
far has been whether to perma
nently freeze the present limit, or
to let the limit move each time
Stanford boundaries move, but
let established liquor dispensaries
remain in business.
The UCW Council, however, is
the first group to proclaim its op
position to even letting the exist
ing establishments remain. The
resolution adopted by the group
sa ys:
. . We believe (his law of
1 1 1 miles was enacted to serve
(lie best interest of all such
schools and universities in the
state.
"We see no justification in
changing this law to benefit a
few liquor dealers.
"We call upon the Stanford
authorities to recognize their
responsibility in upholding the
intent and the purpose of the
covenant by the founders of tho
I'Diversity.
"When a few persons seek to
change the law for their own
personal advantage, we find a
breakdown of democracy. The
citizens of the community
j should he considered and
' heard."
