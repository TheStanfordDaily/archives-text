### Walt Wurfel 
Smiling, jovial Anastas I. Mikoyan talked his way through a press
conference and a banquet in his honor Saturday night in San Fran
cisco with all the case of an experienced public relations man.
The Russian Deputy Premier and Foreign Trade Minister missed
few opportunities to inject humor into the press conference held at

the San Francisco Press and Un
ion Club.
"Your climate is sr> warm here
that, though 1 come from the
Soulh, I am perspiring even be
fore you ask me any questions,"
he quipped in introduction.
Molotov Demotion
Commenting on the demotion
of V. M. Molotov from Foreign
Minister to ambassador to the
Mongolian People's Republic, Mi
koyan said, "We think him an
honest and good man, but a con
servative who doesn't recognize
the need for change when that
need arises. lie got so used to
red tape he didn't see how you
could do without it."
"One cannot be a minister all
the time; is there anything ab
normal in his becoming an ambas
sador?" Mikoyan asked. "The
United States has ambassadors in
even smaller countries in South
America."
Only one question brought from
him a curt answer. In response to
the query of a CBS reporter, Mi
koyan said, "We're for freedom
of the press, but we're against
freedom of libel." He would not
say if the Russians would allow
the network to reopen its Moscow
bureau.
Commercial Talk
Speaking later Ihe same eve
ning at a World Trade Associa
tion dinner in the Fairmont Hotel
he called for more commercial re
lations between our two coun
tries.
Mikoyan called I lie State De
partment's restrictions on trade
ridiculous. "The State Depart
ment sometimes reacts to Com
munists as a bull reacts to red
cloth," he accused.
"It is time to give up the old
line of thinking about the So
viet Union," Mikoyan stated.
"Even now you're richer than us,
but we no longer should be re
garded as backward."
"Our country was once ruled by
people aristocratic in extraction
but not in spirit," he quipped.
"Now our rulers have come up
from the people and the country
is progressing rapidly."
Sputnik and Lunik
It was no accident or good for
tune. but planned development,
that Russia had the first satellite
and the first man-made planet, the
Russian leader said.
Regarding relations between
Russia and China, the Deputy
Premier called rumors of a split
between the two countries wish
ful thinking on the part of the
West. "Relations have been good,
remain good, and are getting bet
ter every day,"he said.
The United States' failure to
recognize Red China "doesn't
change the fact that it exists, and
puts America at a disadvantage,''
Mikovan stated.
