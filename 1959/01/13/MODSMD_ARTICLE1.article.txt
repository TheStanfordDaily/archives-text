# Senators Pass Filibuster Rule
## 
### 
WASIIINGTON(/P) —The Senate changed its rules Monday night
and made it easier to halt filibusters.
The leader of Southern Democrats, Senator Richard B. Russell of
Georgia, pronounced it "a sad day." But Senator Paul H. Douglas
(D-Ill.), who wanted a stronger curb on Senate debate, said the

Southerners had won a great vic
tory.
By a 72-22 roll-call vote, the Sen
ale decreed that from now on two
thirds of the members present
and voting can choke off a fili
buster against civil rights or oth
er legislation.
There are 98 senators, and the
minimum of 34 necessary to
choke off a filibuster under the
new rule is based on a quorum of
50 required to do business.
The old rule required a vote of
at least 66 members, or two-thirds
of the total membership.
First Battle Over
The rewriting of the rule on fili
busters brought to an end the
first big Congressional battle of
the new session.
Southern Democrats, who have
used the filibuster as a cudgel to
beat down civil rights legislation
in the past, wanted no change in
the rules.
"There is no need on earth,"
Russell said, "to further curtail
free speech in the Senate. ... It
is a sad day when the Senate of
the United States demeans itself
by imposing new restraints."
Republican Grip
But Douglas said the outcome
of the battle shows that a coali
tion of Southern Democrats and
conservative Republicans still has
a tight grip on the Senate.
The Northern and Western anti
filibuster bloc contended the new
rule is almost meaningless. They
said it can't be used effectively to
muzzle debate and break down
blockades to passage of civil
rights or other controversial bills.
The Northern-Western senators
said the Johnson plan was little
better than the present rule.

Southerners had won a great vic
tory.
By a 72-22 roll-call vote, the Sen
ale decreed that from now on two
thirds of the members present
and voting can choke off a fili
buster against civil rights or oth
er legislation.
There are 98 senators, and the
minimum of 34 necessary to
choke off a filibuster under the
new rule is based on a quorum of
50 required to do business.
The old rule required a vote of
at least 66 members, or two-thirds
of the total membership.
First Battle Over
The rewriting of the rule on fili
busters brought to an end the
first big Congressional battle of
the new session.
Southern Democrats, who have
used the filibuster as a cudgel to
beat down civil rights legislation
in the past, wanted no change in
the rules.
"There is no need on earth,"
Russell said, "to further curtail
free speech in the Senate. ... It
is a sad day when the Senate of
the United States demeans itself
by imposing new restraints."
Republican Grip
But Douglas said the outcome
of the battle shows that a coali
tion of Southern Democrats and
conservative Republicans still has
a tight grip on the Senate.
The Northern and Western anti
filibuster bloc contended the new
rule is almost meaningless. They
said it can't be used effectively to
muzzle debate and break down
blockades to passage of civil
rights or other controversial bills.
The Northern-Western senators
said the Johnson plan was little
better than the present rule.
