# Ike Will Meet Mikoyan In High-level Conference
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/!') â€”President Eisenhower agreed to meet Saturday with Deputy Soviet Premier
I Anastas I. Mikoyan, giving the Soviet Union an opportunity to make a new high-level move in the
East-West dispute over Berlin.
The White House announced the appointment Monday as top officals expressed some concern over
the apparent propaganda success Mikoyan has scored by his "peace and friendship" remarks since
arriving nine days ago.
To sound out Mikoyan in advance, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles set up a Friday morning

date with him at the State Depart
ment. This would continue the
far-ranging 95-minute talk the
two men held last Monday empha
sizing the future of Berlin and
Germany.
Surprise Move
In a surprise move, Dulles also
made known he would sponsor a
"working discussion" dinner Fri
day night for Mikoyan who has
insisted he came only on a holi
day as guest of Soviet Ambassa
dor Mikhail Menshikov.
Mikoyan's busy schedule when
he returns to the capital, probably
Thursday night, set off a new
flurry of speculation about thr
real purpose of his trip to the
United States.
Authorities who have carefully
followed his remarks and smiling
behavior in visits to Cleveland,
Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco
and Los Angeles said he apparent
ly has made considerable impact
in picturing the Soviet govern
ment as reasonable.
These authorities appeared split
over whether Mikoyan as a grand
finale might drop a surprise Ger
man proposal on Eisenhower's
desk.
University Tour
Mikoyan toured a big West
Coast university Monday and got
a friendly welcome.
"I envy those who can study
and eat," he told a seminar of po
litical science graduate students.
"I had no opportunity to attend
college. I am a graduate of the
school of life and revolution."
Pointing to his son, Serge, who
accompanied him, the Soviet first
deputy premier said: "He was
more fortunate. lie graduated
from college. But it was not the
university of revolution. I consid
er him weaker than I."
Demonstrations Cease
The only evidence Mikoyan has
seen so far in Los Angeles of egg
throwing Hungarian refugees,
who have attempted to harass his
party in other cities, were a few
anti - Communist placards placed
along the road to the Beverly
Hills Hotel where he had dinner
Sunday night with leading Cali
fornians as the guest of Eric
Johnston.
Security arrangements for the
Mikoyan tour have been beefed
up all along the line and the word
has been given out that the tough
and efficient Los Angeles police
do not intend to permit demon
strators near him.
