# Which Plan?
## 
### 
Bf.INC BANDIED about much these days is a discussion of I lie "se
mester system versus I lie quarter system." I.el u* review some o(
the pros and eons for each.
For the quarter system: the benefits seem to be mainly on the
student's social side. Christmas vacation comes at the end o( a
quarter; he doesn't have to worry about studies over vacation? lie
ran start fresh courses.
7 //#» student on the quarter system doesn't have to re
member so much for so long. 7 his is of dubious benefit,
mainly for those who are pros ill "the racket of taking
and passing course.s."
The semester system holds many advantages for the above class
of student, however. Under the semester plan he would probably
get one more vacation — Christmas, semester break and spring
vacation. Now he gets only Christmas and spring.
He would probably have no more mid-terms in a semester than
he has in a quarter —though he might not like this, because the
crutch wouldn't carry as far. And ii he really didn t like the idea
of having studies hanging over his head during Christmas vaca
tion, he could simply forget about them- many do.
However, it is not the above type of student who is
concerned about the semester-quarter debate, except as
a conversation piece.. 7he student who lakes his studies
seriously, who realizes the opportunities of a great uni
versity and who wishes his diploma to be worth mitre
than the paper it is printed on, is seriously considering
which method would be most helpful to him in attaining
an education.
It is acknowledged by many that a reading period before finals
would be valuable, but that the quarter system is just too short
already to make this possible. With faculty members apparently
reluctant to give up any of their lecture time, a reading period
under the quarter system would be impossible. But a semester
would likely allow such a time.
A semester would permit more time for absorption and com
prehension. It would help to eliminate the course-hopping and
the choppiness of the year.
Careful weighing of the advantages of both methods favors
the semester system, if we are to agree that more comprehensive
study is desirable.

vacation. Now he gets only Christmas and spring.
He would probably have no more mid-terms in a semester than
he has in a quarter —though he might not like this, because the
crutch wouldn't carry as far. And ii he really didn t like the idea
of having studies hanging over his head during Christmas vaca
tion, he could simply forget about them- many do.
However, it is not the above type of student who is
concerned about the semester-quarter debate, except as
a conversation piece.. 7he student who lakes his studies
seriously, who realizes the opportunities of a great uni
versity and who wishes his diploma to be worth mitre
than the paper it is printed on, is seriously considering
which method would be most helpful to him in attaining
an education.
It is acknowledged by many that a reading period before finals
would be valuable, but that the quarter system is just too short
already to make this possible. With faculty members apparently
reluctant to give up any of their lecture time, a reading period
under the quarter system would be impossible. But a semester
would likely allow such a time.
A semester would permit more time for absorption and com
prehension. It would help to eliminate the course-hopping and
the choppiness of the year.
Careful weighing of the advantages of both methods favors
the semester system, if we are to agree that more comprehensive
study is desirable.
