# LEGISLATURE
## Time To Assess ASSU 
### John Bohn ASSU President 
The time has come for an evalu
ation of the role of the ASSU Leg
islature in student and University
affairs.
This past weekend the Legisla
ture met informally for several
days at a weekend retreat to dis
cuss just this question. We were
fortunate that Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler and Assist
ant to the President Kenneth
Cuthbertson could attend and give
us the benefit of their advice.
Clarifications
One significant clarification
should be made at the outset.
Logically enough, since the Uni
versity Administration has the re
sponsibility for the actions of all
of its students, final authority
must, in theory, rest with them.
Within this framework student
government has two roles, Ihe ex
act bounds of each being some
times obscure. In the realm of
student activities, which includes
all appropriations and the actions
of aJI boards and commissions,
Legislature has the power of de
cision. In practice the adminis
tration looks to student leader
ship and decision and endeavors
at all times to refrain from inter
ference in this sphere.
University Affairs
In the realm of University af
fairs, on the other hand, student
opinion assumes the role of an in
terest group, and is considered in
making administrative decisions.
The more responsible student
opinion appears, the greater
weight it is given. To make stu
dent opinion more effective, there
fore, the administration must be
convinced that student sentiment
when expressed is well thought
out, representative and constiuc
tive. To achieve this goal is the
purpose of Legislature.
Too often in the past the ASSU
Legislature has occupied its time
with procedural matters to the
deliberate exclusion of those is
sues of current and long-range in
terest to the student body. It is
now time to reassess the interests
and composition of the Stanford
student body so that Legislature
can take its rightful place of lead
ership, not in preserving or fol
lowing outworn traditions, but in
creatively asserting new ideas. '
New Role
Now here's the catch. Tn order
to make such a new role of Legis
lature possible, we have to depend
on the interest and confidence of
ihe students. In the past this con
fidence has been lacking, perhaps
understandably, but the 1959 Leg
islature actively seeks your aid in
the form of ideas. Legislature
members would like to know
what you desire and what your in
terests are. If you can't contact
them, drop a note to the ASSU
office, or to any of your officers
personally.
Whereas in the past the stu
dents were apt to equate student
government with rallies or by
law changes, we hope that this is
no longer the case. We would like
to dispel once and for all the idea
that since we do not have final
and absolute authority in all
things we have no power at all.
This is simply not true.
