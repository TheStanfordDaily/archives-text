# Aims of General Education Imply Student initiative, Responsibility

(Editor's Note: This article,
the second in a series on gen
eral education at Stanford and
the work of the General Studies
Committee, discusses current
attempts to reduce the amount
of "busy work" in undergradu
ate courses.)

General education is more an
attitude or method of learning
than a specific study program.
In both course distribution
(University requirements) and
course concentration (major de
partment requirements), general
education means the development
in the student of a concerned cu
riosity and an ability to communi
cate.
This necessitates an emphasis
upon learning rather than acqui
sition of information, and implies
considerable independent academ
ic responsibility on the part of
the student.
Lecture System
In part, more academic respon
sibility involves less of the being
"talked at" of the lecture system.
Some instructors have moved in
the direction of making lectures
more of a special event than a
deadly routine, freeing course
time for discussion, leading and
critical papers.
Opportunity, albeit inadequate,
exists now for development of in
dependent academic responsibility
in some regular courses, and in
senior colloquia and seminars.
Much, however, remains to be
done along these lines. The argu
ment that a course of five units
"can't be covered" in less than
five lectures a week persists.
This would seem to be a relative
matter, for the course couldn't
be "covered" in 10 lectures a
week, even if it were desirable to
"cover" a subject in lectures.
When an aid to learning, such
as the term paper, is overdone,
the student learns little of how to
think or write. The value of the
shorter, more analytical paper is
being recognized in some areas of
the University.
Honors Programs
Definite advancement is being
made in the implementation of
honors programs.
An interdepartmental ITumani
ties Honors Program has long ex

isted, and the Departments of Bi
ology, History, Psychology and
Sociology now oiler honors.
These programs require inde
pendent research, an honors the
sis of some sort and a comprehen
sive examination. The Depart
ment of Anthropology offers an
Honors Program without a com
prehensive examination.
Economics, Philosophy and So
ciology Departments have ap
plied to the Carnegie Foundation
for a giant to enable them to
offer their concentration students
tutorial assistance.
In preliminaryjplanning stages
are possible honors programs in
political science and an interde
partmental program in the social
sciences.
Even with all of these programs
in operation something less than
10 per cent of the student body
will be involved.
Independent Study
Although to some extent it is
logical to offer independent study
to those best qualified for it, the
University recognizes a responsi
bility to challenge the average
student with independent study
so that he also can develop a ca
pacity for greater academic re
sponsibility.

Related to facilitating inde
pendent study for undergradu
ates is the need for greater avail
ability of books, and greater con
venience in using them. Plans for
an Undergraduate Library have
been approved, and the University
is now seeking a large gilt to in
itiate its construction.
Small Tables
Plans call for small tables
spread throughout stack areas,
rather than the present "study
hall" arrangement.
Better library facilities would
only partially solve campus study
space problems.
Living areas built in the future
will probably employ the suite
system, which makes studying in
â– the living group more feasible.
House study rooms and libraries,
on the idea of those begun in
Stern Hall, are now also consid
ered crucial to housing planning.
