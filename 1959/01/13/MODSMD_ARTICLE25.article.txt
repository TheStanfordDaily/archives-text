# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
School for Distancers
A program to develop middle and long distance runners for the
United States is currently under way in Northern California under
the direction of Bert Nelson, publisher of Track arid Field News, and
Forrest Jamieson, track and cross country coach at I'alo Alto High
School.
Backbone of the program is a" 1 weekly series of developmental
meets under AAIJ jurisdiction. These are held Saturdays at 2 p.m.
on Stanford's Angeil Field. While the stress is on tlie distances, any
track or' field event which an athlete wants on the program for any
Saturday is added.
Although the program has been in operation only since the late
fall, it is already showing signs of making a significant contribution
to American track fortunes.
December sports page headlines marveled at the feat of a 16-year
old Australian running the mile in 4:21? What was generally over
looked was that the same day 15-year-old Mike Chilton of Palo Alto,
running in one of these developmental meets, ran '1:22.4. And his
17 year-old teammate, George Linn, turned in an identical time.
Or there's the story of Wil King, a two-miler who went through
a not-too-distinguished career of distance running at Stanford. King
has been out for several years now, running for local athletic clubs
as best he can. Now, under the impetus of a regular competitive
program in the off-season, King has suddenly blossomed into a 9:02
two-miler. Only four native Americans tur ned in better times in 1955.
Year-Around Program
The theory behind the program is that year-around training in a
competitive context is needed it distance runners are to realize their
full potential. The superiority of European and Australian distance
i miners can to a significant degree be credited to their 1 superior train
ing methods.
By providing regular competition, Nelson and Jamieson think that
athletes wil lbe more inclined to follow through in year-around train
ing. After all, there's nothing like a bit of competition to ease what
can sometimes become a drudgery of training.
For- some, like Don Bowden, the ex Cal middle distance star and
only American four -minute miler, tlie program has provided a chance
to get in top shape for a February tour of Australia. Bowden has
reeled off a 4:06 and 1:51 to belie the theory that it takes a pressure
meet to produce good marks.
But lest the impression be given thai Jamieson and Nelson are
concentrating their efforts on established stars, let it be noted that
many taking advantage of this program are just of high school age.
The enthusiasm for the off-season competition can be seen from the
participants coming from as far' as Fresno and Sacramento.
Benefits to Stanford distance men are naturally good. Although
Stanford has no official connection with the program, other* than
furnishing a track, its very nearness makes it easy for the Indians
to take advantage of it.
Just how significant results are won't be known unlil spring,
when those with the benefits of off-season competition compete
against those who have been in a normal IJ.S. training program. But
the thinking now is that the efforts of Nelson and Jamieson will bear
plenty of good fruits.
Bark on the Farm
Speaking of athletes who are benefiting from special programs,
former- Stanford hurdler Chuck Cobb is getling an especially fortu
nate break as he prepares for what he hopes wil lbe a trip to the
1960 Olympics.
Cobb, now in Ihe T T .S. Navy, has been assigned to the Stanford
NROTC unit. As one of his duties, and in conjunction with govern
ment attempts to help the U.S. in international competition, Cobb
w ill train under Tribe track coach Payton Jordan.
Last year, he was the country's sixth-best high hurdler at 13.9.
With a year and one-half of intensive training ahead, Cobb's chances
to make the U.S. team look to be reasonably good. Under Jordan's
tutelage, he should come along well for the spring season as well.
A COINCIDENCE, OF COURSE—The University of California, as
the host school in the Hose Bowl, also entered in the Hose Parade
the traditional float representing the Pacific Coast Conference. While
a central iheme pertaining to the host school is naturally found on
this float, there is always a listing somewhere on the float with the
names of the other members of the Conference. This year, rather
than just putting all the names in one place, half were put on one
side and half on the other—aesthetic reasons behind this, no doubt.
And of course it was just a coincidence that USC, UCLA, Washington
and Stanford were in one group, with Oregon, OSC, WSC and Idaho
in another group, over on the other side of the float. Oh, well—Cal
might have really gotten .coincidental about it and just plain omitted
the names of its conference enemies. And thinking of the name dis
tribution again, we're not just sure how well we like seeing Stanford
thrown in with the AAWU group. But maybe Cal was just trying to
make a prediction of things to come.
