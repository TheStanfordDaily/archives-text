### 
SAN FRANCISCO f/P)- Califor
nia basketball coach Pete Ncwoll,
with his defending Pacific Coast
Conference champions perched
again in a tic for first place, said
Monday, "We feel we've improved
a little."
The Bears last weekend beat
Washington for a second time and
grabbed a decision over Idaho.
That left them with a 3-1 PCC
record deadlocked with Southern
California.
Two With Cards
This week California plays at
Stanford on Friday and the two
meet at Berkeley on Saturday.
The Indians are 3-2 and tied for
third place. They also beat Idaho
and Washington last week.
"Our big kid (610 Darrall Tm
hoff) is getting better and better
every game," Newell declared.
"He's' starting to pick oil the
shots of the jump shooter and did
a good job on defense against
Washington's Doug Smart.
'"Offensively we're more solid
than last week. Bob Dalton was
slow getting started this season
but now he has the handcuffs off.
We need him.playing his best to
be a good basketball team."
Newell termed Stanford a club
that proved itself last year and
now has the same manpower with
a season's experience behind it.
"Stanford is the ball club right
now that has to be beaten," he
declared.
(iootl Defensive Club
The Indians' coach Howie Dall
mar declared, "We think we have
a good defensive club and the
team did a good job off the boards
against Washington."
Paul Neumann of the Indians
was honored along with Laßoy
Doss of St. Mary's as the co-play
ers of the week.
"I can't say enough about Paul
Neumann," declared Dallmar.
"There's nothing that kid can't, do
on a court. So far he's hitting 53
per cent of his shots from the
floor in PCC competition this sea
son and 92 per cent of his free
throws."
Coach Jim Weaver of St.
Mary's termed Doss one of the
West's underrated performers.

He scored 11 points and took 15
rebounds against Pepperdine last
Saturday in what Weaver termed
"possibly his worst game of the
season," and added, "that is good,
but he's been doing better."
St. Mary's beat Loyola and Pep
perdine in its openers and on Fri
day night hosts Santa Clara in
what should be the big game of
Ihe young West Coast Athletic
Conference season.

now that has to be beaten," he
declared.
(iootl Defensive Club
The Indians' coach Howie Dall
mar declared, "We think we have
a good defensive club and the
team did a good job off the boards
against Washington."
Paul Neumann of the Indians
was honored along with Laßoy
Doss of St. Mary's as the co-play
ers of the week.
"I can't say enough about Paul
Neumann," declared Dallmar.
"There's nothing that kid can't, do
on a court. So far he's hitting 53
per cent of his shots from the
floor in PCC competition this sea
son and 92 per cent of his free
throws."
Coach Jim Weaver of St.
Mary's termed Doss one of the
West's underrated performers.

He scored 11 points and took 15
rebounds against Pepperdine last
Saturday in what Weaver termed
"possibly his worst game of the
season," and added, "that is good,
but he's been doing better."
St. Mary's beat Loyola and Pep
perdine in its openers and on Fri

California.
Two With Cards
This week California plays at
Stanford on Friday and the two
meet at Berkeley on Saturday.
The Indians are 3-2 and tied for
third place. They also beat Idaho
and Washington last week.
"Our big kid (610 Darrall Tm
hoff) is getting better and better
every game," Newell declared.
"He's' starting to pick oil the
shots of the jump shooter and did
a good job on defense against
Washington's Doug Smart.
'"Offensively we're more solid
than last week. Bob Dalton was
slow getting started this season
but now he has the handcuffs off.
We need him.playing his best to
be a good basketball team."
Newell termed Stanford a club
that proved itself last year and
now has the same manpower with
a season's experience behind it.
