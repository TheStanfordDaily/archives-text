# Student Rolls To Sea Death
## 
### 
A Stanford student, William El
liott Delu, on a European holiday
before returning to school, was
apparently drowned in a storm in
the Mediterranean Sea.
Cretan police said Delu, who
lived in Menlo Park, was spend
ing the night in a sleeping bag on
the deck of a small steamer, and
rolled overboard when the vessel
suddenly lurched.
The accident occurred Jan. 5
aboard the Greek steamer Ekate
rini, bound from Athens to Crete.
The steamer reduced speed,
turned on searchlights and low
ered a boat, but the search was
given up after an hour.
Delu had completed his under
graduate work last April in so
cial sciences and was planning to
continue his graduate studies
here next September.
