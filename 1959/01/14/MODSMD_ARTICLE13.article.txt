# PROPOSED LIQUOR LAW
## Limit Changes Still Undecided 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Decision on which of two law
changes to offer the State Legis
lature in an attempt to protect
nine Palo Alto liquor establish
ments will not come until at least
Saturday.
State Assemblyman Clark Brad
ley told The Daily Tuesday that
he had thus far talked only once
to parties concerned with a
change in Stanford boundaries
and the subsequent threat to the
nine businesses.
State law prohibits the sale of
liquor within l'/a miles of any
university boundary. The Stan
ford boundary change, caused by
now housing units, would move
the 1 Va-mile limit past the nine es
tablishments, putting them in vio
lation of the state law.
Rickey's Concerned
Bradley's lone conversation on
the matter was with Harry Kim
ball, general manager of Rickey's
Studio Inn. Though not threat
ened by the present expansion,
Rickey's is concerned because of
precedents which may be set af
fecting future campus expansion.
At that time, Bradley was asked
to see what he could do about get
ting legislative relief for the nine
businesses.
Two possible amendments have
been proposed by various sources.
One would freeze the present lVa
mile limit regardless of future
campus expansion. An alterna
tive change would make the limit
expand each time campus bound
aries expanded, but would allow
establishments in business at the
time of a limit change to continue
operations.
No Objection
Although Stanford has indicat
ed no objection to protecting the
nine threatened establishments,

Bradley said he had not yet met
with University officials to deter
mine which proposal they would
favor.
Bradley added that he hopes to
be in this area Saturday to talk
with Stanford authorities and con
cerned businessmen. "Whatever
alternative Stanford wants which
accommodates the aims of the
restaurant and market group is
OK with me," he said.
Only one protest to relief for
the nine businesses has been re
ceived by Bradley. This was the
resolution passed Friday by the
Council of United Church Women,
which called for strict adherence
to the present law, and saw "no
justification in changing this law
to benefit a few liquor dealers."
Explains Position
Bradley indicated that he
thought the UCW council prob
ably envisioned a complete
change in the limit law.
He said he had written the coun
cil to explain his position in try
ing to protect the threatened
group.
If he cannot talk to the con
cerned parties Saturday, Bradley
said, he would try "to get down
to cases" with them sometime
next week.
Submission of whichever
amendment is decided upon will
presumably quickly follow such
meetings.
