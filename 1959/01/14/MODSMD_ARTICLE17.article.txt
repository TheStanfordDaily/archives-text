# Positiveness

### 
An EDITORIAL which appeared in Monday's Daily lias been criti
cized by some letter-writers (sec today's Letters to tlie Editor)
who, unfortunately, have in some cases misinterpreted The Daily's
position on the .Vlikoyan-Tottoesy situation.
To find or explain possible reasons for these misinterpretations
is riot our aim here; we seek, rather, to explain again our position
on this matter, in hopes of clarifying this position and preventing
further misunderstanding and misinterpretation.
We did not in the editorial, and do not now, advocate a policy
of non-demonstration against things or persona to which one is
opposed. We would, in fact, encourage activity of this sort when
it is carried on in constructive, positive and thoughtful fashion.
Last spring's anti-H-bomb demonstrations on this campus are an
example of demonstrating in a positive fashion.
Our objection is to the overly emotional, unthinking,
physically violent form of demonstration â€”rock thron ing
which greeted Nixon in South America; mud ball and egg
showers that greeted a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
in Irui/; the missile throning and spilling which were
aimed at Mikity an.
We'certainly find no fault with the sign-carrying activities of
the anti-Mikoyan group. And neither do we find fault with the
sign carrying of the pacifist (action in Sail I' ranciseo. Hut for the
one group to deny the rights of the other group to demonstrate
as did those who stormed the pacifist group is as out of bounds
as was the missile throwing.
Secondly, we tlid not r<'f<-r lit Mikoyan as a distin
guished guest. Whether he is distinguished or infamous,
welcome or unwelcome, is not the determining factor in
eialuating a demonstration. We would condemn the.
physical aspects itf the San Francisco affair regardless of
to whom il was directed.
Finally, our concern for the presence on campus of one of the
principal demonstrators was intended in the sense of concern for
the presence of thinking which operates along a path that can lead
to a form of violence.
We cannot, of course, begin to appreciate the inner ferment
and experiences which in some cases can lead to action of this
nature. But we still maintain that attempts to preserve what
measure of peace may exist will only be injured by forms of vio
lence. We feel that actions against those who oppose us in the
present world situation must be of a positive nature. Any other
form of action makes us, as a people, guilty of I lie very things we
seek to eliminate.
