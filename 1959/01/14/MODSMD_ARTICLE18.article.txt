"Intellectual Atmosphere" lias been a much-debated subject
on this campus recently. I)o we have enough or much too little?
The 11 R-sponsored Russian Institute promises to go a long
way toward stimulating sound, serious thinking on the part of
those students who will deign to take advantage of its intellectual
atmosphere.
Russia is an enigma to many in the Western world;
the information mailable to the average reading and
listening public is scanty and often contradictory. As a
result, the popular notions of the Russian rnastadon are,
tinged u ith emotionalism and simple ignorance.
Russian foreign policv, science, culture and economy will be
analyzed and explained by a panel of men with excellent back
grounds in their respective fields. Round-table discussion groups
will have the opportunity to discuss their individual knowledge
and ask questions of the group leaders.
The lIR has provided a reading list on various aspects of Russia
and her world relations—we would strongly recommend that stu
dents read at least one of these books by way of preparation for
the Institute. Although free-world concern over ihe Soviet Union
arises from her current policies and achievements, a basic knowl
edge of her history would benefit us a good deal in understanding
her historical aims and attitudes.
During the next few days it would be wise to keep in
formed on the Middle East situation, on Mikoyans visit,
on the most recent lied satellite. A few considered ques
tions icritten out before attending Institute talks, wen
though they might be answered in the opening panel dis
cussion, wotdd eliminate the hasty, ill-stated questions
which waste valuable time anil lead the informal talks
off on a tangent.
The Russian Institute offers the a fine opportunity
lo replenish and refurbish their reservoir of knowledge of the
West's cold-war opponent. We hope Stanford will demonstrate
intelligent appreciation by contributing lo it.
