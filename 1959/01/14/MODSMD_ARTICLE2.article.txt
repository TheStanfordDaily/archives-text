# RUSSIAN VISITOR
## University Differences Observed 
### Sarah Lawrence 
Dr. Ivan Artobolevsky, a Rus
sian visitor to the U.S. and Stan
ford campus, said Tuesday that
two main differences between
U.S. and Russian universities are
in entrance requirements and in
secondary school pr eparation.
In the Soviet Union, especially
in Moscow universities, there is
a serious approach 1o entrance ex
ams because there are ten times
as many applicants as there is
room available. Also, the grading
system is much more difficult. It
is easier to fail because there are
so many qualified students who
wish to enter.
However, Dr. Artobolevsky
stressed the fact that he felt that
secondary education in the U.S.
did not prepare students in theo
retical science, especially in math
ematics and science. This would
n't make too much difference, he
said, if the students continue their
education for advanced degrees.
There were two things he espe
cially liked about the life of Amer
ican students. These were co-op
erative dormitory living, such as
is found in some of the Midwest
ern states, and also philanthropic
student organizations, such as
those which aid nurseries and war
veterans.
When questioned about student
exchanges, Dr. Artobolevsky stat
ed that not only students should
be exchanged, but people from all
walks of life â€” but especially
young people. "For these young
people are our future. Steps
taken in this direction will have
great consequences."
Dr. Artobolevsky is a Russian
professor of theoretical physics
visiting the United States under
the auspices of the American
Friends Service Committee. He
is a member of the Academy of
Sciences of the USSR and has
published several books on the
theory of mechanisms.
