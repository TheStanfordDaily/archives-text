(Editor's Not# 4 : In order to
present as many views from our
readers as is possible and as
soon as possible, in our limited
spape, we are exercising our ed
itorial prerogative to edit "Let
ters," especially when there are
several on the same topic*. We
have done the utmost to pre
serve the main theme of (he
letters.)
Cheer!
Editor, The Daily:
. . . San Francisco fulfilled her
civic duty in providing a warm
welcome for Russia's Premier An
astas' I. Mikoyan. . . . The civic
dignitaries can be justly proud of
themselves; the only disturbance
came from a "mob of hoodlums"
who were rioting at the arrival of
Mikoyan.
It is difficult to understand the
sentiments of this "mob"; they
only lost their country; some saw
their friends, relatives and par
ents gunned down by Russian sol
diers; and yet, surprisingly, they
rather curse than cheer the man
who ordered tlie massacre in their
country two years ago.
And even if we conveniently
close our ears to the agonies of
millions behind the Iron Curtain,
and cheer 1 their executor, do we
have the right to ignore the cries
within our own country? What
about our Air Force men who are
still suffering in Russian prisons
while we are toasting to the
health of their captor? . . .
Stand up, dignitaries of San
Francisco; give another "standing
ovation" to this murderer of thou
sands; cheer your mortal enemy,
and give a shining example to the
world of how desperately Amer
ica is trying to appease those who
■swore to her destruction.

Have Virtue
Editor, The Daily:
. . . To expect a victim of Com
munist purges to regard a promi
nent Communist leader as human
is expecting far too much charity.
To such a person the possibility
for this proven animal to be also
human is only probable in the
stretches of imagination. There
fore, to pelt the leopard with
straw, after he has devastated
the village, is to show consider
able restraint. . . .
Agreed: demonstrations of vio
lence are not. what we desire in
America. Not agreed: these latest
demonstrations against Mikoyan
are completely without virtue. . . .

Realize Hatred
Editor, The Daily:
Violence directed against a
guest of this country is certainly
not to be condoned. But it is not
difficult to realize the hatred that

'he refugees of the Hungarian re
volt feel toward him [MikoyanJ.
As First Deputy Premier of the
U.S.S.R., he bears a very direct
responsibility for the ruthless re
pression ol the revolt. It might be
hard to explain to these refugees
the necessity for more cultural
agreements and good will be
tween this country and Russia.
Moral judgments are easy to
make from the sidelines. Is Stan
lord to perpetuate the spirit of
I his violence by expelling Miklos
Tottossy from the University?
What right has The Daily to
"trust" that the University will
no longer "tolerate" his presence?
Nick Morgan
Presumptuous
Editor, Tile Daily:
Your editorial condemnation of
Miklos Tottossy was both ill-con
sidered and presumptuous. . . .
Under the circumstances, I
think that the Hungarians at the
airport acted with remarkable re
straint. Mikoyan, as a man re
sponsible for crimes on a massive
scale, should consider himself for
tunate to be attacked by his for
mer victims witli nothing more
lethal than eggs.
Is it then in the cause of ra
tionality and world peace that you
suggest that Miklos be ostracized
for his acts? What criteria per
mit you to tolerate, even welcome,
brutal criminals like Mikoyan,
while condemning from the pale
of "civilized" society those who
throw oranges?
Craig Ifarrisftn
Chance to Study
Editor, The Daily:
. . . The Communist countries
cannot compare these demonstra
tions with the uprisings in Hun
gary or Poland, neither in inten
sity nor in the method of demon
stration. The Western world,
which views the U.S. as the bas
tion of freedom and the giver of
all good gifts, in ihe form of bil
lions of dollars of free aid each
year, is not likely to protest these
small disturbances. . . .
Are these demonstrations un
civilized? Miklos used an orange
as a means of expressing his ha
tred and disgust—not a machine
gun, equipment of torture, or the
concentration camp. He attempt
ed to efface only the personal
pride of one man, rather than to
destroy the transcendent spirit of
a people. . . .
Is it not irrational that Amer
ica, which offers freedom to the
persecuted, should allow the per

secutor to visit our country in as
much freedom as the victim ol
oppression?
We would caution Miklos that
hatred is dangerous, because, as
Erich Remarque says, hatred
makes one forget to be cautious.
We would defend Miklos' motiva
tions but not his actions. We do
not believe that his one act should
cost him his chance to study at
this university.

Lesser Evil
Editor, Tile Daily:
. . . First of all, I think the situ
ation calls for a choice between
the lesser of two evils. If Tot tossy
is not punished we (the U.S. and
Stanford) are open to the charge
thai we condone rowdy demon
strations. I use "rowdy" rather
than "violent," as The Daily does,
because I cannot see how a dem
onstration can be very violent in
which an orange thrower is (in
The Daily's words) "one of the
most violent of the demonstra
tors."
On the other hand, IF TOT
TOSSY IS PUNISHED, WE AUK
OPEN TO THE CHARGE THAT
WE PUNISH THE VICTIMS OF
RUSSIA'S OPPRESSION WHILE
WE GIVE THE OPPRESSOR,
ANA S T A S MIKOYAN, RED
CARPET TREATMENT AT THE
FAIRMONT. This I think is the
greater of the two evils.

Any Hope
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any hope of prohibiting
the activities of United Church
Women within V/> mile-s of the
University boundary?
