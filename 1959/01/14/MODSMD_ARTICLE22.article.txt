(Editor's Note: This article,
the third in a series on general
education at Stanford, surveys
some recent and current proj
ects of the General Studies
(Committee.)

Last year the General Studies
Committee undertook a reorgani
zation of introductory social sci
ence courses on the "terminal"
principle.
These refurbished surveys are
now aimed especially at students
not going on in the subject. They
seek to acquaint him with what
is currently happening in the
more than to present a historical
survey or lay explicit groundwork
for advanced courses.
Introductory social scie n c e
courses share a problem with oth
er large survey courses: discus
sion groups.
Results Vary
To a considerable extent their
success depends on the ability,
interest and classroom presence
of the assistants leading them; re
sults are varied.
Teaching assistants' compensa
tion is being brought somewhat
more in line with the demands of
these jobs. It is also now recog
nized that discussion group pro
grams take extensive organiza
tion and supervision by depart
ment and instructor, a fact which
may eliminate some of the tin
evenness of past efforts.
Under study currently is an in
troductory course in the history
and philosophy of science, which
would expose non-scientists to the
scientific method through the use
of case studies.

One member of the General
Studies Committee commented:
"The aim of the science require
ment is to capture the spirit of
science, and this kind of course
would probably do that better for
the non-scientist than traditional
basic science courses."
The General Studies Committee
initiated the Stanford Abroad pro
gram with the Stuttgart endeav
or. Stanford students are now
getting a first-hand report on
Stuttgart from its first • session
students.
The committee has recent 1 y
been considering to what extent,
and where, the Stanford Abroad
program might be extended.
Public Events
The committee has also been
partially instrumental in an im
proved public events program,
one significant way of extending
general education to a University
wide atmosphere. One of its mem
bers, Albert Bowker, is chairman
of the Public Exercises Commit
tee.
Among their projects have been
assistance to ihe 11 It's Foreign
Policy Institute, which last spring
brought James Reston to campus
in its first session, and improving
qualifications for Political Union
speakers.
Tuesday Series
The Tuesday Evening Series
has been strengthened with such
presentations as Ihe Sputnik
panel, Marianne Moore and Geof
frey Barraclough; and special
speakers such as Robert Frost,
Eleanor Roosevelt and Clement
Alt lee have been sponsored.
Although campus musical and
dramatic productions are usually
of high caliber, Public Exercises
Committee also encourages out
side groups such as the Actors'
Workshop, which gave "Wailing
for Godot" here.

Under study currently is an in

The committee has recent 1 y

program might be extended.
Public Events
The committee has also been
partially instrumental in an im
proved public events program,
one significant way of extending
general education to a University
wide atmosphere. One of its mem
bers, Albert Bowker, is chairman
of the Public Exercises Commit
tee.
Among their projects have been
assistance to ihe 11 It's Foreign
Policy Institute, which last spring
brought James Reston to campus
in its first session, and improving
qualifications for Political Union
speakers.
Tuesday Series
The Tuesday Evening Series
has been strengthened with such
presentations as Ihe Sputnik
panel, Marianne Moore and Geof
frey Barraclough; and special
speakers such as Robert Frost,
Eleanor Roosevelt and Clement
Alt lee have been sponsored.
Although campus musical and
dramatic productions are usually
of high caliber, Public Exercises
Committee also encourages out
side groups such as the Actors'
Workshop, which gave "Wailing
for Godot" here.
