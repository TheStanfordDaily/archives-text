Stanford and the Fourfhisliers
Football supposedly passed from ihe scone Sunday with the Pro
Bowl game, but the grid sport is still prominent in the athletic- pic
ture on ihe Pacific Coast . . . and more and more, eyes are turning
toward Stanford.
Now everybody's waiting to see what Stanford is going to do
about joining the ' Big Four," Athlelie Association of Western Uni
versities.
And if the BAC has made a decision, or has a definite leaning to
ward some decision, ii must rival the best kept of military secrets.
Now factors are entering the picture every day, the latest of which
are the penalties dealt out to Southern California by the NCAA last
week. They may have no small bearing on what Stanford eventually
does.
The Trojans' boo-boo takes Ihe bottom out of Ihe AAWU's per
sistent claims of purity and that now the boys have reformed and
are following the straight and narrow.
t'SC may have made a fatal mistake for Iheir infant conference.
People outside of Ihe Big Four's little circle who were never too wild
about the idea to begin with, now are even more opposed. It must
be a bitter pill for the Trojans to take, for the two year per iod rules
the next two SC football teams out of any bowl game, and it is no
secret that Trojan followers were looking forward to great teams in
the next two years. And the powerful SC spring sports teams wore
also looking forward to renewed success. Now, nowwhere to go.
But even when the Trojans get off the hook (if ever) the bowl
game picture is a bit clouded. Pasadena's Rose Bowl is expected to
l>e filled after next year by the king of the Bin Fourfhisliers; but
who is going to play them?
The Big Ten, which is released from its Rose Bowl contract after
next year, has implied that ii might not bo too anxious to sign an
agreement with the AAWIJ. If the Big Ten was to back down, the
list of Rose Bowl possibiJitios would be greatly reduced, because most
of the other conferences are already tied to bowl game agreements.
Ten Boosts Cards
So here, strangely enough, the eyes turn toward Stanford again.
The local decision is looking more and more important, whether the
Fourfhisliers like it or not. At least a good portion of Big Ten senti
ment was revealed by L. 11. Gregory of the Portland Oregonian after
he had talked with Dick Cullom, sports editor of the Minneapolis
Tribune.
Cullom reported that right now the Big Ten would defeat a pro
posal for renewal of the Rose Bowl pact. "Sentiment at present is
exactly divided al five and five," said Cullom. "The lie would prevent
an extension."
Where lies Ihe fate of a future Rose Bowl pact? Cullom thinks
it lies with Stanford's eventual acceptance or denial of AAWU mem
bership. Plainly, the Big Ten is outwardly suspicious of the recruit
ing and scholastic integrity of the present "Big Four," and can vis
ualize the proselyting shenanigans which might be pulled off in such
an alignment. USC's latest smash on the sports pages isn't helping
things.
Gregory writes: "How would Stanford's joining up make a dif
ference? 'Because,' as Cullom put it, 'everyone knows Stanford is
pure in heart, so to speak, and wouldn't stand for anything ques
tionable in athletics. I'd almost say that Stanford's membership
or nonmemhership is the key to what the Big Ten does about the
clean —without Stanford, there might be doubt as to how far the
clean —withuf Stanford, there might be doubt as to how far the j
enthusiasm of the other Big Four schools might carry them.' "
The decision is looking bigger and bigger all the time. Cuilom's
words illustrate the widely known difference between the athjetic |
philosophies of Stanford and its prospective mates in the AAWU.
The two outlooks don't seem exactly compatible.
Could Stanford go il as an independent? There seems little doubt
as to ihi.s. It- is hard to picture California, USC and UCLA dropping
from their schedules the traditional game with Stanford. The Stan
lord rivalry with these schools is too deep and profitable—to be :
dropped just because of a new conference. For the same reasons, j
Washington can't afford to drop its traditional battles with Wash
ington State, Oregon and Oregon State.
While the Farm looks pretty secure for the present, there are
growing doubts as to the stability and prospective life-span of
AAWIJ. From the start, it has looked too much like an AALAU, and
friends: Athletic Association of Los Angeles Universities, and
Friends.

the next two years. And the powerful SC spring sports teams wore
also looking forward to renewed success. Now, nowwhere to go.
But even when the Trojans get off the hook (if ever) the bowl
game picture is a bit clouded. Pasadena's Rose Bowl is expected to
l>e filled after next year by the king of the Bin Fourfhisliers; but
who is going to play them?
The Big Ten, which is released from its Rose Bowl contract after
next year, has implied that ii might not bo too anxious to sign an
agreement with the AAWIJ. If the Big Ten was to back down, the
list of Rose Bowl possibiJitios would be greatly reduced, because most
of the other conferences are already tied to bowl game agreements.
Ten Boosts Cards
So here, strangely enough, the eyes turn toward Stanford again.
The local decision is looking more and more important, whether the
Fourfhisliers like it or not. At least a good portion of Big Ten senti
ment was revealed by L. 11. Gregory of the Portland Oregonian after
he had talked with Dick Cullom, sports editor of the Minneapolis
Tribune.
Cullom reported that right now the Big Ten would defeat a pro
posal for renewal of the Rose Bowl pact. "Sentiment at present is
exactly divided al five and five," said Cullom. "The lie would prevent
an extension."
Where lies Ihe fate of a future Rose Bowl pact? Cullom thinks
it lies with Stanford's eventual acceptance or denial of AAWU mem
bership. Plainly, the Big Ten is outwardly suspicious of the recruit
ing and scholastic integrity of the present "Big Four," and can vis
ualize the proselyting shenanigans which might be pulled off in such
an alignment. USC's latest smash on the sports pages isn't helping
things.
Gregory writes: "How would Stanford's joining up make a dif
ference? 'Because,' as Cullom put it, 'everyone knows Stanford is
pure in heart, so to speak, and wouldn't stand for anything ques
tionable in athletics. I'd almost say that Stanford's membership
or nonmemhership is the key to what the Big Ten does about the
clean —without Stanford, there might be doubt as to how far the
clean —withuf Stanford, there might be doubt as to how far the j
enthusiasm of the other Big Four schools might carry them.' "
The decision is looking bigger and bigger all the time. Cuilom's
words illustrate the widely known difference between the athjetic |
philosophies of Stanford and its prospective mates in the AAWU.
The two outlooks don't seem exactly compatible.
Could Stanford go il as an independent? There seems little doubt
as to ihi.s. It- is hard to picture California, USC and UCLA dropping
from their schedules the traditional game with Stanford. The Stan
lord rivalry with these schools is too deep and profitable—to be :
dropped just because of a new conference. For the same reasons, j
Washington can't afford to drop its traditional battles with Wash
ington State, Oregon and Oregon State.
While the Farm looks pretty secure for the present, there are
growing doubts as to the stability and prospective life-span of
AAWIJ. From the start, it has looked too much like an AALAU, and
friends: Athletic Association of Los Angeles Universities, and
Friends.

exactly divided al five and five," said Cullom. "The lie would prevent
an extension."
Where lies Ihe fate of a future Rose Bowl pact? Cullom thinks
it lies with Stanford's eventual acceptance or denial of AAWU mem
bership. Plainly, the Big Ten is outwardly suspicious of the recruit
ing and scholastic integrity of the present "Big Four," and can vis
ualize the proselyting shenanigans which might be pulled off in such
an alignment. USC's latest smash on the sports pages isn't helping
things.
Gregory writes: "How would Stanford's joining up make a dif
ference? 'Because,' as Cullom put it, 'everyone knows Stanford is
pure in heart, so to speak, and wouldn't stand for anything ques
tionable in athletics. I'd almost say that Stanford's membership
or nonmemhership is the key to what the Big Ten does about the
clean —without Stanford, there might be doubt as to how far the
clean —withuf Stanford, there might be doubt as to how far the j
enthusiasm of the other Big Four schools might carry them.' "
The decision is looking bigger and bigger all the time. Cuilom's
words illustrate the widely known difference between the athjetic |
philosophies of Stanford and its prospective mates in the AAWU.
The two outlooks don't seem exactly compatible.
Could Stanford go il as an independent? There seems little doubt
as to ihi.s. It- is hard to picture California, USC and UCLA dropping
from their schedules the traditional game with Stanford. The Stan
lord rivalry with these schools is too deep and profitable—to be :
dropped just because of a new conference. For the same reasons, j
Washington can't afford to drop its traditional battles with Wash
ington State, Oregon and Oregon State.
While the Farm looks pretty secure for the present, there are
growing doubts as to the stability and prospective life-span of
AAWIJ. From the start, it has looked too much like an AALAU, and
friends: Athletic Association of Los Angeles Universities, and
Friends.

Stanford and the Fourfhisliers
Football supposedly passed from ihe scone Sunday with the Pro
Bowl game, but the grid sport is still prominent in the athletic- pic
ture on ihe Pacific Coast . . . and more and more, eyes are turning
toward Stanford.
Now everybody's waiting to see what Stanford is going to do
about joining the ' Big Four," Athlelie Association of Western Uni
versities.
And if the BAC has made a decision, or has a definite leaning to
ward some decision, ii must rival the best kept of military secrets.
Now factors are entering the picture every day, the latest of which
are the penalties dealt out to Southern California by the NCAA last
week. They may have no small bearing on what Stanford eventually
does.
The Trojans' boo-boo takes Ihe bottom out of Ihe AAWU's per
sistent claims of purity and that now the boys have reformed and
are following the straight and narrow.
t'SC may have made a fatal mistake for Iheir infant conference.
People outside of Ihe Big Four's little circle who were never too wild
about the idea to begin with, now are even more opposed. It must
be a bitter pill for the Trojans to take, for the two year per iod rules
the next two SC football teams out of any bowl game, and it is no
secret that Trojan followers were looking forward to great teams in
the next two years. And the powerful SC spring sports teams wore
also looking forward to renewed success. Now, nowwhere to go.
But even when the Trojans get off the hook (if ever) the bowl
game picture is a bit clouded. Pasadena's Rose Bowl is expected to
l>e filled after next year by the king of the Bin Fourfhisliers; but
who is going to play them?
The Big Ten, which is released from its Rose Bowl contract after
next year, has implied that ii might not bo too anxious to sign an
agreement with the AAWIJ. If the Big Ten was to back down, the
list of Rose Bowl possibiJitios would be greatly reduced, because most
of the other conferences are already tied to bowl game agreements.
Ten Boosts Cards
So here, strangely enough, the eyes turn toward Stanford again.
The local decision is looking more and more important, whether the
Fourfhisliers like it or not. At least a good portion of Big Ten senti
ment was revealed by L. 11. Gregory of the Portland Oregonian after
he had talked with Dick Cullom, sports editor of the Minneapolis
Tribune.
