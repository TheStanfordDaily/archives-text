# TWO GAMES
## Frosh Meet Cal Squad 
### 
Fresh off a pair of wins over
Santa Cruz High and Diablo Val
ley College, Stanford's eager
freshman oagers will face the
Bearcubs of tlie University of
California in back -to - back eon
tests Friday and Saturday nights.
Friday's game will take place
in the Stanford Pavilion, while
Saturday's struggle will bo fought
in the California Men's Gymna
sium. Both contests promise to
he close, rugged struggles. The
Indian frosh are just rounding
into form and beginning to show
their mettle, while Cal'.s first-year
men have demonstrated a tough,
balanced squad which can give
trouble to any opponent.
The Papooses, sporting a 3-2
record, arc led in scoring by 6-7
center John Windsor, and in re
bounding by 6-7 forward Rich
Hosley. John Fontius, 6-1 guard,
is team floor leader and play mak
er. Opposite Fontius at guard is
6-4 Jim Bryan, and at the other
' forward is 6-3 Nels Christensen.
California is headed by Jim
| Snider, 6-5 cenler, and Neal Satre,
j 6-4 forward. Steve Chandler starts
at the other forward, with Dave
Williams, John Wible or Burton
Da vies at the guard spots.
Snider and Satre provide the
scoring punch; but the Bearcubs'
strongest feature is an air-tight
rlefon.se. It is up to the Indian
frosh to crack this defense and
hold down the Snider-Satre hoop
making production.
