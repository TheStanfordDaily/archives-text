# Important Cal Contests Next for Dallmarmen
## 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
Those who would make a middle-of-the-season prediction about the 1959 PCC Basketball Champion
ship had better look in at thji* Stanford Pavilion this Friday night and then at Men's Gym in Berkeley
on Saturday. Stanford's all-fired-up Indians take on the California Golden Bears in a home-and-home
series which could easily spell the future of either of these clubs in the final season of PCC hoop play.
Both Stanford and Cal go into this weekend's tussles on the strength of victorious exhibitions last

| time around. The two Bay Area
clubs hosted Washington's Hus
kies and the Idaho Vandals 011
alternate nights last Friday and
Saturday.
California disposed of both vis
aing squads with little trouble.
Coach Pete Newell's boys downed
the Washington team of Doug
Smart and Bruno Boin 55-41, then
tackled Idaho 61-38.
Stanford won both its games,
too, but with less ease. The Cards
| tripped Idaho 50-36, then fought
j the Huskies down to the wire be-
I fore taking a 51-49 decision.
The Friday - Saturday battles
will be two of the most defensive
! battles played in the nation this
season, and Dallmar's hope is to
turn on his top scorers at the
same time his club hits the sum
mit of its defensive prowess.
Stanford will still probably be
without the services of high-scor
ing forward Jerry Thuesen. Thlie
sen picked up a case of pneumo
nia before the Conference season
opened, missed the opening swing
throughout the Northwest, got
out to practice last week, but still
isn't ready.
Back on the starting five is
Doug Warren. He had hurt his
ankle just before the Conference
opened and had been used spar
ingly since. Over last weekend,
however, Warren proved he is
ready to start again.
