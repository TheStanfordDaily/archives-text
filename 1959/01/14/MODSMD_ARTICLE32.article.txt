# U.S. Giving Money Away; Stanford Might Get Some
## 
### 
The University has applied to
the U.S. Office of Education for
student loan funds under provi
sions of the new National Defense
Education Act. Financial Aids Di

rector Robert P. Huff expects to
know by about Feb. 1 whether
Stanford is to receive the "sub
stantial amount" asked for.
The Defense Education Act,
passed in September of last year
and described by President Eisen
hower as "an emergency under
taking," authorizes the expendi
ture of $887 million over the next
four years to improve the quality
of American education. Interim
appropriations for student loans
in California for the current fis
cal year total $.171,699.
In deciding who may receive
the loans, ranging up to $1000 per
year per- student, "financial need
will be stressed far more than
with our own loan program,"
Huff said. Loans can y 3 per cent
inerest, with principal and inter
est payments beginning one year
after the student ceases to be en
rolled full-time.
Future Teachers First
In selecting students for loans,
educational institutions are in
structed to give priority to stu
dents who wish to teach in ele
mentary or secondary schools
and students of science, math,
modern foreign languages and en
gineering.
Huff said that his office will
invite students to apply as soon
as the University learns how
much federal money it will re
ceive. Those who are full-time
students for the entire academic
year and who can sign an affirma
tion of loyally to the U.S. govern
ment and constitution are eligible.
Other New Pnmrains
Other programs of the act in
which Stanford may participate
are the National Defense Fellow
ships, the training programs for
high school guidance and coun
seling personnel and for language
teachers for elementary and sec
ondary schools, the improvement
of foreign language instruction in
colleges, and research in more ef
fective use of audio-visual aids to
education.
The fellowships, numbering
1000 for the country for 19.19, are
intended to increase the numbers
of students in graduate programs,
especially students interested in
college teaching. Institutions will
select students io receive up to
$2400 yearly for graduate study.
The act specifies that the Fed
eral Government is prohibited
from exercising authority over
any part of any educational insti
tution under terms of this act.
