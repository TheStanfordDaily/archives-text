# Kendall, Ogg Opposed On Nuclear Armaments
## 
### Diana Smith 
Professors Willmoore Kendall and Richard Ogg opposed each other
from extreme and untouching viewpoints of the humanitarian and
atomic warfare views of Albert Schweitzer last night; they argued
from a refusal to accept intolerability of the consequences as a le
gitimate argument, and from reference to the horrors of nuclear

warfare, respectively.
Kendall opened the well-attend
cd, Breakers â–  sponsored discus
sion (called by the moderator
"not a grudge match"), by read
ing his review of Schweitzer's
"Peace or Atomic War." The re
view rebutted the argument that
"nuclear weapons carry in them
selves the absolute reasons for
being renounced."
Ogg objected to "condescen
sion" in a review of a book by "a
man of this stature."
"The science of which I am a
practitioner has brought man to
a predicament . . . which I do
not think could be much worse,"
Ogg said.
He interspersed his reply with
the playing of "John Foster Dul
les" by the Kingston Trio, and
witli quotations from a variety of
authors.
Stating that the obligation of a
reviewer is more "truth" than
"good manners," Kendall then
apologized to the audience for
the lack of "rational discourse"
thus far, and for his inability to
reply with reasonable argument.
"1 honestly don't identify any
argument in what Professor Ogg
has said."
Ogg expressed opposition to the
"selfishness" of support for na
tional survival at all mosts.
