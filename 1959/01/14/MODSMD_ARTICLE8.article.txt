# Mayan Music Discussed by Mexican Prof
## 
### Lynne DeLargey 
According to anthropologist
Sam u e 1 Marti, "The Mayas
reached a state of musical devel
opment comparable and perhaps
superior to that of any known cul
ture."
Marti, professor at the Mexican
International Institute, pointed
out in his Tuesday Series lecture
how much remains to be learned
in Mayan archeology, and much
of the mater ial is beneath the jun
gle. Another problem is the
glyphs on Mayan reliefs, which
have not yet been deciphered.
One great mystery is why the
centers of classical Mayan culture
(about 300 to TOO A.D.) were
abandoned in the eighth century.
Anthropologists have had some
success in reconstructing Mayan
music, however, from their instru
ments and from the music of liv
ing related peoples in Guatemala.
The Mayans possessed wooden
drums, whistles, single and double
flutes and a four-pipe flute, on
which chords could br played,
unique among cultures of the
world.
Possible sources of information
on Mayan music, Marti said, are
Spanish records of native culture
and the Mayas' own books, some
of which may prove to be music
texts when they arc deciphered,
since tho Mayans evidently had
elaborate schools of music.
