# Dulles Blasts Russ German Proposals

### 
WASHINGTON (/I 3 )— Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles Tues
day blasted the Soviet Union's
proposals for Germany as brutal,
stupid and probably unworkable.
Coupling this harsh criticism
with an implied promise of flexi
bility, Dulles added that this coun
try is willing to meet with the
Soviet Union, Britain and France
to discuss the German problem.
Dulles thus set the stage, at a
news conference, for round No. 2
of Anastas I. Mikoyan's Washing
ton talks about the future of the
divided nation. Mikoyan, deputy
Soviet premier, is due back here
late this week after a cross-coun
try tour.
Six Points
Dulles said:
1. His and President Eisenhow
er's conferences with Mikoyan on
Friday and Saturday, respective
ly, will amount to an exchange of
views and not two-nation negotia
tions—something which U.S. al
lies oppose.
2. The Soviet Union's proposal
to isolate and demilitarize Ger
many is not only brutal, as West
German Chancellor Konrad Ade
nauer contended Monday, but "it's
a stupid approach because we
don't think it will work."
3. The Western Allies believe
Germany should be reunited
through free elections. But Dul
les said—apparently for the first
time in public—that a free elec

tion is not the only method pos
sible. He declined to elaborate,
except to add: "There arc all
kinds of methods."
No New Proposals
4. The United States has no new
proposals on Germany's future at
present. It stands on the Allies'
Dec. 31 note to the Kremlin pro
posing four-power talks on the
whole German question. Such
talks would embrace Berlin, re
unification, a peace treaty and
European security.
5. "We are having constant
talks with our allies about the

situation"—a hint that now pro
posals should not he finally ruled
out.
6. Mikoyan made clear, in talks
last week with Dulles and Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon, t hat
the Soviet Union did not intend to
lay down an ultimatum on Berlin
in its Nov. 27 note. Dulles said it
was his impression that the So
viet's proposal to hand East Ber
lin over to East Germany and de
mand withdrawal of Western
forces from West Berlin, by next
June was not "an ultimatum with
a fixed time limit."
