# Russian Panel Hears of Iron Curtain in U.S.
## 
### Rita Robison, Associate Editor 
The opening panel discussion of the IJR Russian Institute was
enthusiastically received by an attentive audience in Cubberley Audi
torium last night.
Paul Dague, lilt vice-president, introduced the Institute as being
an effort to provide a worthwhile experience for the Stanford com

munity in providing them with a
foundation of knowledge concern
ing the Soviet Union, a basis of
communication with and under
standing of the world behind the
Iron Curtain of Ignorance.
Foreign Policy
Dr. Robert North, opening the
first talk of the evening with the
observation that "We not only
have our own Iron Curtain, but
we tend to carry it, like a snail,
around with us," proceded to
pierce this shell with a brief yet
concise summary of Russian for
eign policy.
North cited Russia's traditional
foreign policies, her legacy of
Lenin and World War ll—a So
viet world achieved by striking at
capitalism's weakest links and by
exploiting nationalism.
Recent Shifts
Recent shifts in Russian for
eign policy Dr. North described
as his own "hunches"—and they
were that there is an "enormous
dynamic" trend to be found in the
extraordinary emergence of a
a managerial, bourgeois middle
class in Russia today, a class
which envisions the "engineering
of a new world with tremendous
vision of the future," a vision
which most Americans lack, he
added. "There is a vast new con
fidence, which may be good or
bad, but whichever it is, we Amer
icans must take account of it. We
must watch relations between
China and Soviet Russia, and
above all," he cautioned, "we must
realize that the Soviet Union is
not standing still," but that its
society, and the resulting foreign
policy, is constantly undergoing
change.
Russian Culture
Dr. Jack Posin, speaking rap
idly to convey a profusion of cul
tural information on Russia past
and present, apologized for the
lack of time to present a more
complete picture. His main points
wcr that Russia does indeed have
a religion—the philosophy of dia
lectical materialism, the essence
of this creed being expediency;
that dictatorial institutions and
national groups within Russia
have a direct bearing on her cul
ture; that "humanities have little
influence in Russia, depending as
they do on inquiry and investiga
tion." He stated that although
Russian training of their youth is
very efficient, we should be a
little less "gullible" in believing
that their educational system is
superior to our own.
Revival of Fading Faith
Dr. Posin sketched a brief ac
count of Russian painting, tliea
trr, cinema, music and literature
before and after 1917, posing the
question "llow much creative gen
ius has come because of Soviet
life, or in spite of it?" Pasternak
he mentioned with the great lit
erary figures of Tolstoy and Che
kov, and "Dr. Z/.ivago" he said
had "revived the fading faith of
Russians in the great literary tal
ent of the Russian people."
Dr. Wo 1 112 g an g Panovsky
stressed A m e r i c a n "misunder
standings" in relation to Russian
scientific achievements. Due to
the "prestige - consciousness" of
the regime, he explained, "results
arc shown only when perfected,
and thus are spectacular."
"Contributions of foreigners,
particularly of captured German
scientists, in the field of rocketry,
are not so," ho asserted. The
equipment and know-how of both
basic and applied science in Rus
sia is decidedly Russian, he stated.
"Science in Russia has a much
more prominent role in govern
ment than in the U.S., and scien
tists arc better paid also, he added
wryly.
Open Forum
An institute open forum will be
held today at 3:30 p.m. at the
Women's Clubhouse.
He concluded that "In our rela
tions with Russian scientists, they
demonstrate a very sincere desire
to break down the Iron Curtain
barriers."
