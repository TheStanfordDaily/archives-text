# Students Value Stuttgart Experiences
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
(Editor's Note: This is the first half of
a recent Daily interview with four Stan
ford students returned from the first
Stuttgart study group.)

"lt's not really Stanford moved to Ger
many it's something brand new, complete
ly separate, and a totally different way of
life than is experienced here."
This was the conclusion reached by four
returnees from Beutelsbach, Judy Pinson,
Lynn Pyle, Ken Pureed and Jack Rudden,
while remembering longingly many events
and features of their group, the first Stan
ford group to participate in the Stuttgart
experiment in education.
Though the 63 students had many "firsts"
to their credit, the four emphasized that no
precedent was set, that each successive
group will form its own traditions and will
decide its own policies and regulations.
Teams on Two Continents
One of the group's numerous distinctions
was that of having one of the few cheering
sections in Germany, as well as a champion
basketball team. But, after all, how many
universities can boast of winning teams on
two continents?
The team was undefeated until the "big
game" when it lost 62-50 to the national
champions of Germany, the University of
Heidelberg, and it practiced daily at 5:30
a.m.
"We really gave Heidelberg 'the axe'."
smiled Judy Pinson. "German universities
don't have rooting sections, and our enthu
siastic group, led by yell leader Carolyn
Graf, really surprised everyone."
Snipe Hunt
A "first" for Resident Director Peter
Burner was a snipe hunt a German ver
sion of the old search for the world's most
elusive animal (or bird, in this case).
"We told Dr. Burner that we didn't know

the German worrl for snipe, so we just
couldn't explain what it was," laughed
Lynn Pyle. "So away ho wont, slithering
on his stomach, with his sack, club and
flashlight, looking for the snipe!"
Among the other traditions carried over
from The Farm to The Burg were the Full
Moon custom, a practice somewhat en
larged upon; the Big Game Bonfire, held si
multaneously with the Lake Lag celebra
tion; and meeting at the "Cellar," there
there called the "Rathskeller," which served
a different beverage than the Union spe
cialty.
Completely Different Life
For the most part, the group led a com
pletely different life than that of the Stan

ford student on the Palo Alto campus.
The feeling of complete freedom was a
contrast, the less-strict Continental attitude
allowing students to go anywhere and to
do anything with the responsibility of a
completely individual person.
The extreme "togetherness" of the group
was another outstanding feature.
"Where else could a fellow borrow one
girl's car to take out another girl?" "All
dates were dutch." "Every Saturday night
we all went together to the local Gasthaus."
Social life consisted mainly of movies
there was one show in Bcutelsbach and sev
eral in Stuttgart, and movies proved a pain
less way to improve German.
Hospitality Great
The Swabian people's extreme hospitality
was stressed by the four, though it was a
more formal hospitality than is common
here. The group reports it received more
than 150 invitations.
In the homes the students t;ilked, played
games "Monopoly in German is really
fun" watched television "Sports events
arc the most popular, but there are very
few TV sets" and sangâ€”"All the families
are so musical."
Exchanges were held with a technical
high school (comparable with an American
college) and the four fell that this was ail
area which could be further expanded.
Traveling was something the group did
a great deal, as the summer quarter had a
four-day class week and the autumn quar
ter. with a five-day week, included two
longer trips to Rome and Paris. The four
estimated they each spent $400-$5OO on
traveling, plus their transportation home.
Several of the group bought cars, and
others got used motorcycles for about $100.
Ken Purcell was one of a group which went
to the World's Fair by motorcycle, a 300-
mile trip each way.
