# Eisenhower Press Conference

### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€”President Eisenhower on
Wednesday denounced in strong language the
Soviet Union's plan to demilitarize and isolate
Germany. "An exercise in futility," he called it.
But Eisenhower, speaking at a National Press
Club luncheon, offered "any assurance, any mate
rial move" to overcome Soviet fears of future
German aggression.
The President's sharp words gave backing to
an even stronger denunciation of the Soviet plan
for 1 Germany made Tuesday by Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles, who called it brutal, stupid
and probably unworkable.
Eisenhower said in his Press Club talk he has
no intention of making any new proposals 1o
Mikoyan because that would transform the infor
mal chat into a kind of negotiating conference.
In the news conference which followed the
luncheon, he offered the opinion that "we would
more than be a little stupid" not to believe that
the Soviet Union is outstripping the United States
in some phases of missile development.
After all, he said, the Soviets have been work
ing at it many years but the United States began
urgent work on long-range missiles only four
years ago.
This wasn't the President's usual news con
ference, although it was the usual day for one.
Rather, it was his first appearance at the Na
tional Press Club since he entered the White
House. TV and radio networks carried his words
live to the nation.
Some of the high points:

SEGREGATION Tito school integration prob
lem "must he solved," Eisenhower said. He didn't
say how, but ho repeated an old position: that it
will take time and dedication.
POLITICS The President said that if a Flo
publican aspirant for the White House in 1960
doesn't go along with his basic thinking on the
relationship of the government !<> the individual
and on the need of free world co-operation, "1
couldn't possibly support him."
THE ECONOMY Confidently professing a be
lief that 'wo can keep prices from rising uncon
scionably," Eisenhower said that would make it
possible to provide properly for defense and the
needs of the people and still keep fiscal integrity.
As he suggested to Congress in his State of the
Union message Friday, ho said a balanced budget
will raise hopes of tax reforms and cuts in the
future.
He said ho doesn't see any real difference be
tween Republicanism, modern Republicanism and
progressive Republicanism that lie believes in
applying the principles of the founding fathers
to the problems of today.
MISSILES AND SPACE Eisenhower pro
nounced it "absolutely fatuous and futile to try
to balance, item by item, the progress of two
great nations in their technology of defense."
"So that to disturb ourselves too much that we
have not yet caught up with another groat power
and people with great technical skill in a particu
lar item," the President said, "it seems to me to
show a loss or a lack of sense of balance."
