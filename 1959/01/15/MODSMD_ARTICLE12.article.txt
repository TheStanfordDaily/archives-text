## Pat Brown Takes Over Policy Reins, Calls for Strong State Administration 
### 
SACRAMENTO (A*)— Governor
Brown made it clcar Wednesday
that he intends to be boss of his
administration.
He told his department heads

he must okay all policy, so the
Legislature and the people will
know what the administration is
for or against.
At the same time, the Demo

cratic governor told his aides he
wants "new talent and ideas, not
hacks." And he ordered them to
cut expenses —by at least five
million dollars between now and
June 30.
It was the strongest statement
Brown has made since he took
office Jan. 5.
He told the department heads
he wants them on the job during
the legislative session, not out
making speeches.
Labor, Water, Budget
The governor said he himself is
turning down 30 invitations a day
so he can concentrate on the Leg
islature. The governor plans to
present his labor ideas to the law
makers next week, fo 1 lowed
quickly by his water program and
state budget.
The Legislature stepped up its
pace Wednesday. Ninety-five new
bills were introduced.
The Senate passed its first
measure—a rearrangement of the
Education Code making no sub
stantive changes.
NCAA Action
The Assembly had its first de
bate over a resolution concern
ing USC's athletic troubles. By a
vote of 42-28 the Assembly asked
the NCAA to reconsider its latest
two-year probation of USC.
Author John L. E. Collier (R-
Los Angeles) called the NCAA ac
tion a "kangaroo court" decision.
None of our business, argued the
opponents.
Assemblyman Louis Francis
(R-San Mateo) proposed adding
five years to minimum prison
terms for certain narcotics of
fenders making it 10 years for
first offense, 15 years for subse
quent violations. Earlier bills call
for minimum terms of 30 years.
