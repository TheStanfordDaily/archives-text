# THE 						POLITICAL EYE
## Congress 'Cold' To Ike's Program 
### Leo Krulitz 
Amid a multitude of pleas for
the dignity of man, for peace in
the world and for various other
things-—things that somehow one
felt he had heard requested many
times before — President Dwight
D. Eisenhower made a stropg, sin
cere plea for a balanced budget
and a conservative spending pol
icy before Congress. And the plea
fell on tired, almost bored ears.
This unreceptive attitude and
the fact that men dared to display
such disinterest in Ike's message
tells us several things.
First, the fine qualities of free
dom and dignity that the Presi
dent urges automatically in near
ly every speech struck a sensitive
chord. Perhaps these ideas had
come to mean more to an Ameri
can people that had watched while
the South carelessly tossed ideals
aside and Jewish temples had
been bombed. They were phrases
that weren't to be used loosely.
Mure important, the disinter
est of the Congressmen reflect
ed what they themselves be
lieved to be the mood of the
country. The country, they felt,
didn't want a conservative
spending policy or, for that
matter, a balanced budget.
Eisenhower recognized the
problems Congress will pose to
the enactment of his program and
announced recently that he will
"go to the people," if necessary,
to put through his program, bal
anced budget and all.
The lines seem to be drawn, and
many writers suggest the out
come will determine to a great ex
tent who controls the government
and the White House in 1960.
Many things might have led
to such an attitude by the Con
gressmen — most obvious, of
course, would be their recent
election on a liberal platform.
But the President was calculat

ing also, and wasnt' about to
abandon his party.
Perhaps Eisenhower was ex
pecting a conservative reaction
before the election in 1960. This
is possible, especially if inflation
isn't checked and spending has
n't been known to accomplish this
end in the past . If such a reac
tion takes place, it would be a
political assel to have introduced
a balanced budget.
As far as they Democrats were
concerned, they were content to
play the present, and the present
seemed to call for spending.
The people seemed to be tired
of the worry of balanced budg
ets. They appeared less con
cerned with space problems,
too. It no longer seemed as up
setting to hear of a Russian
made planet.
Our satellites were popping off
Cape Canaveral quite regularly,
and people were quite optimistic
that we had as much chance to
put a man on the moon as the
Russians. All that was needed
was to keep the money flowing,
and the scientists would take care
of the rest.
The real concern of the people
probably was the pasl recession.
They liked the feeling of prosper
ity in Ihe air again—and didn't
want to lose it. The easiest way
to maintain it appeared to keep
the government spending people
weren't ready for caution.
Perhaps another reason why
Congressmen felt they could
fiont the message was because
it wasn't "Ike's" message at all
—it was President Eisenhow
er's, and there was a difference.
If the President is successful in
his role as a serious, concerned
man and can win back the respect
that amiable "Ike" has lost, his
program has a chance. If not, it
seems a recent headline will win
out —"Spend . . . Spend . . .
Spend."
