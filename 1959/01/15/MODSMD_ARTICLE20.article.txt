# With Deep Regret

Editor, Tim Daily:
As so many other Americans, I
was angered and horrified at the
brutal suppression of the recent
Hungarian revolution. And, as so
many others, 1 was eager to open
the doors of our country to as
many of the Hungarian freedom
fighters as possible, and to offer
them every opportunity to find
happiness and to give voice to
their ideals and goals, as benefits
a great people.
So it i-s with deep regret that I
must express my feeling of pro
found shame for- the thoughtless
and childish way in which many
of these same people, including
students at Stanford, reacted to
the visit of Mr. Mikoyan to San
Francisco.
No one can condemn a peaceful
demonstration in a free country,
but such behavior as the throwing
of rocks and eggs hardly does
justice to the people who sup
posedly are working for mature
political and philosophical ideals.
It should be obvious to anyone
that if cruelty is always to be an
swered with cruelty, there is no
hope in the future for our civili
zation or for our race.
