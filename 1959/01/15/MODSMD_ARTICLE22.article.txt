Editor, The Daily:
... Do you really "feel certain
that the University . . . does not
condone demonstrations"? Or
would you agree that a univer
sity, per se, has absolutely no
right to pass judgment on the
political actions of its students?
If this be a civil issue, then the
civil laws designed to cope with il
will do so (as they have), and the
University will handle Miklos as
it would any other civil offender.
. . . If it be a political issue . . .
then the University has no right
to pass any judgment on it. . . .
. . . Try to put yourself in the
place of Miklos . . . and perhaps
you will see why we who have
never been oppressed have no
right to seek his expulsion for his
actions at tho airport. .. .
