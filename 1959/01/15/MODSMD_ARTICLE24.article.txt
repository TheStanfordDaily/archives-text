# Adjustments Called For In Subject Concentration

(Editor's Note: Tins article
is the fourth in a series on gen
eral education at Stanford, and
deals with possibilities til pro
jecting the principles of general
education into the major field.)

The Genera] Studies Program,
although still in need of some ad
justing, takes the major step to
ward implementing general edu
cation in terms of subject distri
bution. What remains to be done
is the application of principles of
general education to subject con
centration as well.
Tutorial System
The tutorial -system, which en
courages independent learning in
the major field, was thoroughly
examined by the Stanford Study;
it acknowledged the system's ad
vantages, but felt that the consid
erable financial outlay necessary
for tutorial could be better em
ployed elsewhere at. that time
(1956).
Time of the present faculty
could be freed for independent
work, such as tutorial, if many
courses now offered were drop
ped, condensed, or taught less
often.
The assistant dean of Humani
ties and Sciences has recently
completed a survey of course fre
quency and scope which will un
doubtedly result in some changes
within that school.
Senior Colloquia
The senior colloquia, a most
unique feature of Stanford's Gen
eral Studies Program, are expen
sive to operate.
Student reaction to the collo
quia, so far as it can be measured,
appears largely favorable. There
is some dissatisfaction with col
loquia's tendency to degenerate
in I o a swapping of unfounded
opinions, because students lack
experience in verbal critical anal
ysis.
If this criticism is well founded,
it may underline the importance
of general education. It' present
senior colloquia sometimes exhib
it deficiency in critical examina
tion and articulation, then per
haps Stanford students need con
siderable more practice in these
skills.
Student Concern
Many students need to be grad
ually and patiently won to the
taking of this kind of responsi
bility. But signs point to a rising
student concern with this kind of
education, e.g., student reaction to
Wilfred Stone's article in last au
tumn's Sequoia.
One starting point might be
"comprehensives"—a general ex
amination in the major field. The
student would be given a list of
topics upon entering his major de
partment. on which he would be

required to pass a general exami
nation before graduation.
lie would plan his study to pre
pare for some of these topics with
course work and for others with
independent reading.
House System
The house s'ystem, toward
which Muir and Burbank houses
in Stern Hall are a small begin
ning, could ultimately include fac
ulty residents from several fields
in each house. Students would
draw into a house partly to do
tutorial, by arrangement with
their major department, with one
of its faculty residents as part of
their concentration.

Tlvo possibility of a reading pe
riod before examinations was se
riously considered by the Stan
ford Study and remains not very
far back in the minds of many
Stanford academic planners.
Semester System
One deterrent to the reading
period is the quarter system, since
a reading period would further in
fringe on already cramped course
schedules. At present there are
increasingly insistent rumblings
of the possibility of a change-over
to the semester system as gener
ally conducive to more learning
and less busy work.

The tutorial -system, which en
courages independent learning in
the major field, was thoroughly
examined by the Stanford Study;
it acknowledged the system's ad
vantages, but felt that the consid
erable financial outlay necessary
for tutorial could be better em
ployed elsewhere at. that time
(1956).
Time of the present faculty
could be freed for independent
work, such as tutorial, if many
courses now offered were drop

Senior Colloquia
The senior colloquia, a most
unique feature of Stanford's Gen
eral Studies Program, are expen
sive to operate.
Student reaction to the collo
quia, so far as it can be measured,
appears largely favorable. There
is some dissatisfaction with col
loquia's tendency to degenerate
in I o a swapping of unfounded
opinions, because students lack
experience in verbal critical anal
ysis.
If this criticism is well founded,
it may underline the importance
of general education. It' present
senior colloquia sometimes exhib
it deficiency in critical examina
tion and articulation, then per
haps Stanford students need con
siderable more practice in these
skills.
Student Concern
Many students need to be grad
ually and patiently won to the
taking of this kind of responsi
bility. But signs point to a rising
student concern with this kind of
education, e.g., student reaction to
Wilfred Stone's article in last au
tumn's Sequoia.
One starting point might be
"comprehensives"—a general ex
amination in the major field. The
student would be given a list of
topics upon entering his major de
partment. on which he would be

required to pass a general exami
nation before graduation.
lie would plan his study to pre
pare for some of these topics with
course work and for others with
independent reading.
House System
The house s'ystem, toward
which Muir and Burbank houses
in Stern Hall are a small begin
ning, could ultimately include fac
ulty residents from several fields
in each house. Students would
draw into a house partly to do
tutorial, by arrangement with
their major department, with one
of its faculty residents as part of
their concentration.

Tlvo possibility of a reading pe
riod before examinations was se
riously considered by the Stan
ford Study and remains not very
far back in the minds of many
Stanford academic planners.
Semester System
One deterrent to the reading
period is the quarter system, since
a reading period would further in
fringe on already cramped course
schedules. At present there are
increasingly insistent rumblings
of the possibility of a change-over
to the semester system as gener
ally conducive to more learning
and less busy work.
