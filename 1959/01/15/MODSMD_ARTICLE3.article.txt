# LIQUOR LAW
## Stanford Won't Voice Preference 
### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
Stanford reaffirmed Wednesday
that it would take no part in de
ciding which of two proposed
liquor law amendments will be
submitted to the State Legisla
ture.
The amendments have been
proposed to grant relief to nine
Palo Alto liquor establishments
which are threatened with license
loss when Stanford boundaries
expand in September.
Not Concerned
Thomas Ford, administrative
assistant in the University busi
ness ofice, said that "the Univer
sity stand is that this is the prob
lem of the licensees. Just how the
law is changed does not concern
us; what is done is up to the busi
nesses and the Legislature."
Tuesday, Assemblyman Clark
Bradley told The Daily that he
would abide by the wishes of
Stanford in deciding which
amendment to sponsor.
The two alternatives which
would furnish relief to the threat
cned establishments are (1)
freeze the present lH'-mile limit
regardless of future University
boundary expansion, or (2) allow
the limit to move each
time the boundaries move, but let
affected liquor licensees in opera
tion at the time of a limit change
remain in business.
Licensees' Decision
Thus, it appears the final deci
sion will come from Ihe licensees
themselves, affected only by any
actions by pressure groups con
cerned with the situation.
In further explaining Stanford
policy in this matter, Ford said,
"Our position is that this is
something which comes about be
cause of academic considerations.
We don't want to put anybody out
of business. As far as any fur
ther changes in the law are con
cerned, that's a matter strictly up
to the Legislature. 1 '
