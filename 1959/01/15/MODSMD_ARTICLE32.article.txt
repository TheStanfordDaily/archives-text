mittee also altered the substitu
tion rule to open up the game.
The goal posts will remain be
hind the goal line. The posts were ;
kept there mainly for safely rea
sons.
Acting Chairman Fritz Crisler |
made the announcement as the
10-man committee wound up its
three-day deliberation of rule
changes.
Crisler said there was no dis
cussion over ihe controversial :
two-point conversion rule adopted
last year. He explained that ev- i
eryone was satisfied with it.

The s u b s t i t u t i on rule was
amended. Basically, it permits
one player to enter a game any
time the clock is dead. This will
permit, for instance, a quarter

to re-enter a game without being
recorded but only when the game
clock is officially stopped.
