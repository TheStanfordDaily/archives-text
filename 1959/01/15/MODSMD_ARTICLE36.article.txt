# Stanford Cagers Ready for Cal
## 
### Steve Baffrey Sports Editor 
California and Stanford, cur
rently the leader and number one
runner-up, respectively, in Pacific-
Coast Conference basketball play,
go at ii twice this weekend in a
home-and-home series which be
gins Friday in the Stanford Pa
vilion.
While the oddsmakers are giv
ing the Golden Bears a slight edge
in both contests, coach Howie
Dallmar's club will have some
fairly important factors to throw
at the Calmen.
Stanford leads the PCC in de
fensive statistics, and boasts the
Conference scoring leader in co
captain Paul Neumann. Califor
nia, while nowhere in the scoring
firsts, lies second to the Cards in
defense, and occupies a higher po
sition on the statistic totem poles
in most categories.
Bears' Good Defense
Over at California, however,
the Blue and Gold rests atop the
NCAA defensive stats for their
overall play this season. The bat
tle of defenses should tell the tale
when the series gets under way.
Dallmar is hoping his leading
scorers, Neumann, center Dick
Haga and forward John Arrillaga,
will have good nights againsl the
Bears while the Indian defense
continues to function as it has in
the past.
"We must play the backboards
in the respectable fashion we did
against Washington,"the mentor
feels. "Cal is a good, well - hal
anced club." Dallmar feels that
a victory over the Bears will have
to he a well-rounded effort com
bining all the team's st l ong
points.
Stanford can expect trouble
from the usually efficient Pete
Newell coached Cal club. Back to

help the defending Conference
champions is 6-10 center Darrall
Imhoff, guards Denny Fitzpatrick
and Al Buch, and forwards Bob
Dalton and Jack Grout.
Thuesen Out
Dallmar will be without the
services of Jerry Thuesen, not
fully recovered from an attack of
pneumonia, and John Stabler and
Neal Brockmeyer, both lost from
the suicide squad with the flu.
The Cards will open with Arri
llaga and John Hendry at the for
wards, Ilaga at center, and Neu
mann and Do u g \V ire n at
guards.

a victory over the Bears will have
to he a well-rounded effort com
bining all the team's st l ong
points.
Stanford can expect trouble
from the usually efficient Pete
Newell coached Cal club. Back to

help the defending Conference
champions is 6-10 center Darrall
Imhoff, guards Denny Fitzpatrick
and Al Buch, and forwards Bob
Dalton and Jack Grout.
Thuesen Out
Dallmar will be without the
services of Jerry Thuesen, not
fully recovered from an attack of
pneumonia, and John Stabler and
Neal Brockmeyer, both lost from
the suicide squad with the flu.
The Cards will open with Arri
llaga and John Hendry at the for
wards, Ilaga at center, and Neu
mann and Do u g \V ire n at
guards.
California and Stanford, cur
rently the leader and number one
runner-up, respectively, in Pacific-
Coast Conference basketball play,
go at ii twice this weekend in a
home-and-home series which be
gins Friday in the Stanford Pa
vilion.
While the oddsmakers are giv
ing the Golden Bears a slight edge
in both contests, coach Howie
Dallmar's club will have some
fairly important factors to throw
at the Calmen.
Stanford leads the PCC in de
fensive statistics, and boasts the
Conference scoring leader in co
captain Paul Neumann. Califor
nia, while nowhere in the scoring
firsts, lies second to the Cards in
defense, and occupies a higher po
sition on the statistic totem poles
in most categories.
Bears' Good Defense
Over at California, however,
the Blue and Gold rests atop the
NCAA defensive stats for their
overall play this season. The bat
tle of defenses should tell the tale
when the series gets under way.
Dallmar is hoping his leading
scorers, Neumann, center Dick
Haga and forward John Arrillaga,
will have good nights againsl the
Bears while the Indian defense
continues to function as it has in
the past.
"We must play the backboards
in the respectable fashion we did
against Washington,"the mentor
feels. "Cal is a good, well - hal
anced club." Dallmar feels that
a victory over the Bears will have
to he a well-rounded effort com
bining all the team's st l ong
