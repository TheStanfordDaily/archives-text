# Batista Henchmen Face Castro's Firing Squads
## Executions Will Continue 
### 
HAVANA, Cuba (/P) — The re
ported toll of revolutionary war
crimes executions soared Wednes
day to 180. Rebel chieftain Fidel
Castro declared they will continue
—regardless of world opinion.
Asked by newsmen as he left
his quarters in the Havana Hilton
Hotel whether the shooting of
Fulge n c i o Batista's accused
henchmen would be called off,
Castro replied swiftly: "No. To
the contrary, we have given or
ders to shoot every one of these
murderers.
Despite World Opinion
"And if we have to battle world
opinion to mete out justice we arc
prepared to do it."
Castro added, referring to crit
ics among the American press and
people: "You can tell them that
the time to worry about that—the
executions—was while the tyrant
was in power and they were be
hind him."
Revolutionary tribunals moved
to bring more suspects to trial.
Just how many eventually will die
is anybody's guess.
Hard Labor, Death
Estimates of the number jailed
in the island's six provinces
swelled to from 4000 to 6000. Sus
pects are still being hunted down.
Perhaps 5000 or more remain at
large. Some are accused of acting
as informers, others of a variety
of misdeeds.
Castro, who now heads the
Cuban armed forces, has recom
mended long terms at hard labor
for those convicted of lesser
crimes. He reiterated Tuesday
night that murderers and traitors
must die.
Military Tribunals
Castro and other Cubans con
tend that Cuba has as much right
to exterminate war criminals as
the Allies had in condemning Nazi
leaders at the Nuernberg trials
after World War 11.
Military justice officials in
Santiago say the hearings are
conducted under a revolutionary
code based on the Nuernberg
trials. So far as could be learned,
no trials have yet started in Ha
vana, where more than 1200 per
sons are jailed.
Feeling against Batista's fol
lowers stems from killings, tor
ture and other crimes perpetrated
under his rule from 1952 until his
flight New Year's Day. It
been estimated 20,000 persons suf
fered thus at the hands of troops
and national police.
