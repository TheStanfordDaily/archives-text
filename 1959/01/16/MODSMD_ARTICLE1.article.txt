# Hopeful Note Ends Institute

### Rita Robison, Associate- Editor 
.Speaking in forceful, eloquent, sometimes humorous, but always
thoughtful terms, a five-man panel concluded the two-day IIR Rus
sian Institute with an hour-and-a-half Open P'orum yesterday after
noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
Moderated by Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, former director of the Hoo-

ver Institution and future presi
dent of Mills College, the panel
ists, Dr. Robert North, Alexander
Kerensky, Dr. Wolfgang Panov
sky and Dr. Jack Posin, discussed
five principal topics, as proposed
by Dr. Rothwell.
Russian Expectations
The first of these, "What about
the aspirations and expectations
of Russians concerning their own
future?" was directed to Dr. Po
sin, who made a distinction be
tween the Russian government
and the Russian people. "The
long-range plans of the govern
ment are quite different from the
'more bread and shoes' desires of
the people." Dr. Panofsky and
Dr. North observed that whereas
technological advances have been
directed into heavy industry and
military devices, neglecting con
sumers' goods, the Russian people
have a real desire to increase their
material possessions, and the
standard of living in Russia will
certainly rise when the govern
ment and people feel they have
succeeded in "overtaking the
U.S."
Educational Future
In regard to the second ques
tion, "What about the future of
education, technological advance
and Soviet science?" Dr. Panov
sky, an eminent physicist, reas
sured us that the achievements of
the Soviet system are about equal
to that which can be achieved —
"not mandatorily" — in a good
American school. He further ob
served that there is, however, a
"frightening phenomenon" in the
Soviet ability to translate discov
ery into application. The supe
riority of .Russian education, in
particular that of women, must be
considered in the light of the Rus
sian art of "selective emphasis,"
cautioned Dr. North, and he ob
served that "in Russia a woman's
duty was seen to be first to her
profession, and secondly to her
home and family."
Political Scene
In answer to the question
"What about the future of the
political flank within the Soviet
Union?" Kerensky firmly negated
the possibility of the regime
changing for the next 100 years.
The Bolshevik policy has been to
smother the flame of freedom
which existed in Russia prior to
the Revolution, he stated, and al
though the Russian soul has not
yet been robotized, there can be
no evolution, however gradual,
into a community of Western life
within the existing state system.
C hina Is Key
Regarding Russia's relationship
with other Communist countries,
Dr. North, while referring to the

Eastern European satellites as
"extraordinarily depressing," em
phasized that "China is the key to
the problem." The Sino - Soviet
axis he sees as being very strong
at present, but that internal prob
lems between the two countries
may split them, and as such offer
the free world new hope.
The relationship between Rus
sia and non-Communist countries
is determined by what Kerensky
termed a "new kind of balance of
power, due to nuclear weapons—
H-bombs and missiles—and diplo
macy is no longer handled by dip
lomats.
New Hope
"It is necessary to find a new
balance of power," he continued,
"not a mechanical one. Now pow
er is balanced mechanically but
not psychologically or political
ly." War, he stated, has in the
past been a continuation of diplo
macy, resulting in a new approach
through diplomacy, but warfare
in modern times is hopeless.
"But I believe in the human
soul," he affirmed, "and that we
will find some way to liberate the
world." The enthusiastic applause
which greeted this statement indi
cated that the audience cherished
the same hope.

sian Institute with an hour-and-a-half Open P'orum yesterday after
noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
Moderated by Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, former director of the Hoo-

ver Institution and future presi
dent of Mills College, the panel
ists, Dr. Robert North, Alexander
Kerensky, Dr. Wolfgang Panov
sky and Dr. Jack Posin, discussed
five principal topics, as proposed
by Dr. Rothwell.
Russian Expectations
The first of these, "What about
the aspirations and expectations
of Russians concerning their own
future?" was directed to Dr. Po
sin, who made a distinction be
tween the Russian government
and the Russian people. "The
long-range plans of the govern
ment are quite different from the
'more bread and shoes' desires of
the people." Dr. Panofsky and
Dr. North observed that whereas
technological advances have been
directed into heavy industry and
military devices, neglecting con
sumers' goods, the Russian people
have a real desire to increase their
material possessions, and the
standard of living in Russia will
certainly rise when the govern
ment and people feel they have
succeeded in "overtaking the
U.S."
Educational Future
In regard to the second ques
tion, "What about the future of
education, technological advance
and Soviet science?" Dr. Panov
sky, an eminent physicist, reas
sured us that the achievements of
the Soviet system are about equal
to that which can be achieved —
"not mandatorily" — in a good
American school. He further ob
served that there is, however, a
"frightening phenomenon" in the
Soviet ability to translate discov
ery into application. The supe
riority of .Russian education, in
particular that of women, must be
considered in the light of the Rus
sian art of "selective emphasis,"
cautioned Dr. North, and he ob
served that "in Russia a woman's
duty was seen to be first to her
profession, and secondly to her
home and family."
Political Scene
In answer to the question
"What about the future of the
political flank within the Soviet
Union?" Kerensky firmly negated
the possibility of the regime
changing for the next 100 years.
The Bolshevik policy has been to
smother the flame of freedom
which existed in Russia prior to
the Revolution, he stated, and al
though the Russian soul has not
yet been robotized, there can be
no evolution, however gradual,
into a community of Western life
within the existing state system.
C hina Is Key
Regarding Russia's relationship
with other Communist countries,
Dr. North, while referring to the

Eastern European satellites as
"extraordinarily depressing," em
phasized that "China is the key to
the problem." The Sino - Soviet
axis he sees as being very strong
at present, but that internal prob
lems between the two countries
may split them, and as such offer
the free world new hope.
The relationship between Rus
sia and non-Communist countries
is determined by what Kerensky
termed a "new kind of balance of
power, due to nuclear weapons—
H-bombs and missiles—and diplo
macy is no longer handled by dip
lomats.
New Hope
"It is necessary to find a new
balance of power," he continued,
"not a mechanical one. Now pow
er is balanced mechanically but
not psychologically or political
ly." War, he stated, has in the
past been a continuation of diplo
macy, resulting in a new approach
through diplomacy, but warfare
in modern times is hopeless.
"But I believe in the human
soul," he affirmed, "and that we
will find some way to liberate the
world." The enthusiastic applause
which greeted this statement indi
cated that the audience cherished
the same hope.

Moderated by Dr. C. Easton Rothwell, former director of the Hoo-

ver Institution and future presi
dent of Mills College, the panel
ists, Dr. Robert North, Alexander
Kerensky, Dr. Wolfgang Panov
sky and Dr. Jack Posin, discussed
five principal topics, as proposed
by Dr. Rothwell.
Russian Expectations
The first of these, "What about
the aspirations and expectations
of Russians concerning their own
future?" was directed to Dr. Po
sin, who made a distinction be
tween the Russian government
and the Russian people. "The
long-range plans of the govern
ment are quite different from the
'more bread and shoes' desires of
the people." Dr. Panofsky and
Dr. North observed that whereas
technological advances have been
directed into heavy industry and
military devices, neglecting con
sumers' goods, the Russian people
have a real desire to increase their
material possessions, and the
standard of living in Russia will
certainly rise when the govern
ment and people feel they have
succeeded in "overtaking the
U.S."
Educational Future
In regard to the second ques
tion, "What about the future of
education, technological advance
and Soviet science?" Dr. Panov
sky, an eminent physicist, reas
sured us that the achievements of
the Soviet system are about equal
to that which can be achieved —
"not mandatorily" — in a good
American school. He further ob
served that there is, however, a
"frightening phenomenon" in the
Soviet ability to translate discov
ery into application. The supe
riority of .Russian education, in
particular that of women, must be
considered in the light of the Rus
sian art of "selective emphasis,"
cautioned Dr. North, and he ob
served that "in Russia a woman's
duty was seen to be first to her
profession, and secondly to her
home and family."
Political Scene
In answer to the question
"What about the future of the
political flank within the Soviet
Union?" Kerensky firmly negated
the possibility of the regime
changing for the next 100 years.
The Bolshevik policy has been to
smother the flame of freedom
which existed in Russia prior to
the Revolution, he stated, and al
though the Russian soul has not
yet been robotized, there can be
no evolution, however gradual,
into a community of Western life
within the existing state system.
C hina Is Key
Regarding Russia's relationship
with other Communist countries,
Dr. North, while referring to the

Eastern European satellites as
"extraordinarily depressing," em
phasized that "China is the key to
the problem." The Sino - Soviet
axis he sees as being very strong
at present, but that internal prob
lems between the two countries
may split them, and as such offer
the free world new hope.
The relationship between Rus
sia and non-Communist countries
is determined by what Kerensky
termed a "new kind of balance of
power, due to nuclear weapons—
H-bombs and missiles—and diplo
macy is no longer handled by dip
lomats.
New Hope
"It is necessary to find a new
balance of power," he continued,
"not a mechanical one. Now pow
er is balanced mechanically but
not psychologically or political
ly." War, he stated, has in the
past been a continuation of diplo
macy, resulting in a new approach
through diplomacy, but warfare
in modern times is hopeless.
"But I believe in the human
soul," he affirmed, "and that we
will find some way to liberate the
world." The enthusiastic applause
which greeted this statement indi
cated that the audience cherished
the same hope.
