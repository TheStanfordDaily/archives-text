# Students, Profs Close at Stuttgart
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
(Editor's Note: This is the
second half of a recent Daily
interview with four Stanford
students who have returned
from the first Stuttgart study
group.)

One of the most valuable expe
riences gained by Stuttgart stu
dents was the close relationship
with the professors living with
the students.
Two American professors and
their wives and two German pro
fessors (tutors) were there each
quarter, plus the resident direc
tor. Dr. Fricdrich Strothmann re
mained the entire time, while Dr.
Kurt Sloiner taught summer
quarter and Dr. Edward Farmer,
fall.
"They were teachers- not just
lecturers," the group stressed.
"We learned so much from them
outside of class."
"Poor Dr. Strothmann. he was
always being called to repair the
washing machine." laughed Judy
Pinson. "And Mrs. Strothmann
was forever reminding us to wear
our galoshes."
"The Natural Air"
The four commented on the
German people -"More interested
in health than Americans." "More
emphasis on nature, noticeable in
such things as the odors outside,
and the women's lack of make
up."

Lynn I'yle remembered Ihe
time that she was the only woman
wearing lipstick in church one
Sunday. "The minister delivered
a fire-and-brimstone sermon that
day; not at me, though ... I
hope!"
On studying and grading "We
really studied there, but you did
n't mind it." "Grading was not on
the curve; they tried to figure out
where our work would fit in on
the Stanford curve in America,
and wc received almost all A's."

"German was the course with the
lowest achievement the first quar
ter, but that was mainly due to
the difference in methods of the
German tea che r s ; when Dr.
Strothmann took over the second
quarter, grades went up."
On the feeling of isolation
which some persons had been
afraid that the campus would
have: "11 was more like living in
a fishbowl: during our frequent
walKs the people would always
stare in at us." "There's a town
every two kilometers; we could

sco 19 villages from our hill."
"Beutelsbach has a population of
3000 awl we went into Stuttgart
often."
"What Did Y'ou Get Out of It?"
The question most asked of the
returnees is "What did you got
out of it?"—a question much too
general and too broad to possibly
be answered completely.
"You just can't explain what
it's like," they agreed. "It was ev
erything together that was so
wonderful. Not that wc were
never dead tired, or depressed, or
homesick— but the experiences
and learning combined to make it
'home' and to make everyone
moved to tears upon leaving."
"Our farewell dinner would
sound 'slushy' to anyone else,"
stated Judy Pinson, "if we said
that all 80 people were crying.
No one considers himself 'senti
mental.' but the thought of leav
ing, plus Dr. Strothmann's fare
well speech, and the singing of
Auld Lang Syne and the Stanford
Hymn really moved everyone."
"You don't really know what
you want to get out of it when
you go," said Jack Rudden. "You
hear so much about studying in
Europe, it's kind of a romantic
idea. But it's as hard to be objec
five and concrete as In try to tell
what you got out of your first
year at Stanford."
Lynn Tyle added, "It made me

look at things differently, to have
a broader view."
Ken Purcell said he had wanted
a change, "something to break up
the routine, and to change my life
a little bit and give it meaning.
And I just wanted to travel."
Remain in Europe
The intended purpose of encour
aging students to remain in Eu
rope to study is also being ful
filled, I he four agreed. Among
those of the first group who are
now at European universities are
Nancy Fisk at the University of
Vienna, Bill Ralderree at the Sor
bonne, and Elizabeth McElvenny
and Frank Morgan at the Univer
sity of Frankfurt.
"It's a safe generalization to
say thai we all hope to return to
Europe," they added.
Could they suggest any changes
that should be made? "Only
strictly regarding procedure,"
they said. "There is really noth
ing that eottld be changed; each
group will get out of it what they
put into the program."
Though agreeing that they
would have liked to stay longer,
the four felt that the two-quarter
system gives more students the
wonderful experience of a life
which truly expresses the "free
dom" of the Stanford motto
which originated in the peasant
rebellion of the 16th century
which began there in Beutelsbach
—"Die Luft der Freiheit Weht!"
