# Evaluations Difficult

(Editor's Note: This is the
last article in a series on gen
eral education at Stanford anil
the work of the General Studies
Committee. It deals with the
problems of evaluation of un
dergraduate teaching and of
housing policy.)

"Perhaps the major unsolved
problem of university education
today is the evaluation of under
graduate teaching," commented
General Studies Committee mem
ber Virgil Whitaker.
Executive Secretary of the
Committee William Bark added
that the University is realizing
more acutely the importance ot
good teaching, and is giving fac
ulty credit for good teaching.
The matter of teaching evalua
tion depends on one's criteria for
teaching and for education. The
General Studies Committee, if il
is fair to oversimplify their think
ing somewhat, feels that the basic
criteria should be the develop
ment of the student's interested
curiosity.
Good teaching is not only pro
vocative lecturing, although ad
mittedly that has its importance.
Evaluation Difficult
Gathering information to eval
uate teaching is a difficult busi
ness. Questionnaires help, and so
do individuals' comments to the
department or to the office of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, but this information is not
always either representative or
based upon the same criteria.
Advising has been a weak point
in Stanford education in the past;
some people do an excellent job
of advising while others do a min
imum.
This state of affairs doesn't nec
essarily have to exist if students
demand good advising, and if they
do enough thinking on their own
so that advice can be of some ad
ditional help.

It is easy to change advisers,
should the relationship not be a
particularly rewarding one.
Housing Policy
Under special consideration this
year is University undergraduate
housing policy.
The point of a residence univer
sity is its ability to make under
graduate education more mean
ingful through its extension into
student living areas.
Housing revision is not the Gen
eral Studies Committee's explicit
concern, but the University-wide
atmosphere of general education
which is its specific interest will
undoubtedly influence the think
ing of those engaged in working
out housing policy particulars.
Considered Plans
Among housing ideas appealing
to individual members of the com
mittee is that of integrating the
women of all four classes.
Advantages of the sponsor sys
tem are seriously challenged by
the inadvisability of insulating
freshmen from the rest of the
University community.
Students' outlook on housing is
colored by present, far from ideal,
conditions, which frequently
make off-campus living the most
attractive solution.
The unimaginative quality of
most campus residences saps the
vitality of the University in the
long run no less than the individ
ual student's.
Concrete Possibility
But there are signs that more
ideal living conditions are closer
than many may think to being a
concrete possibility.
The Stern program is a taste of
a possible housing future.
Many members of the commit
tee also stress the importance of
continuity to an effective living
group. They would favor careful
regulation of the number of times
a student could change his living
group.
