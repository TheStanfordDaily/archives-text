The following article from
the Christian Science Monitor
is worth quoting in entirety.
Moral? Never complain about
Legislature being a slow-mov
ing student government!
"Most Sydney University stu
dents have crawled into their
shells and refuse to talk about
the election of Nicholas A. Che
lona as student council president.
"Why has a new election been
called with Chelona's name ab
sent from the ballot? A council
official pointed out, 'He's not: rep
resentative, he's not a student —
and we're not even sure he's a
He.'
"Nicholas A. Chelona is a
turtle.
"Nicholas beat out five other
candidates after a sponsor wrote
in the student newspaper that he
had spent three years in ihe medi
cal department, was a keen stu
dent of natural science, and was
sure to prove a much faster work
er than members of previous stu
dent representative councils."
The file of past examinations
has been removed from the San
Jose State library with the dec
laration that to study them is
"morally wrong." The abolish
ment was the result of a poll
taken of faculty members in
which 77 of the 181 replies re
ceived called the file a "crutch,"
"gimmick," and described it as
"spoon feeding." Although this
is eliminating one of the
"crutches" referred to in Wednes
day's Daily editorial, we question
both the actual extent of use of
the file and the effectiveness of
its removal from the library, as
the fraternity files still exist.
A Penn State junior called a

private telephone number recent
ly and became the suspect of a
Secret Service investigation. The
number, which the student had
gotten from a friend, belonged to
Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Daily
Collegian reports that the reason
for the call was to invite the Pres
ident to become an honorary
member of the student's frater
nity, Phi Sigma Kappa. Though
Ike never got to the phone person
ally, and so could not reply to de
cline or accept the invitation, sev
eral investigators did "accept"
and were waiting at the Phi Sig
house the next day.
And they call Stanford "The
Farm" . . . Penn State's 3700-
acr«* campus has 3154 acres of
farmlands —real, honest-to-good
ness farmlands with sheep, tat
tle, hogs, orchards, etc. Some
areas are used for wildlife man
agement experiments, agricul
ture testings, and proposed is a
forestry center which would in
clude drying kilns and a student
sawmill! Penn State also claims
the oldest soil fertility plots in
the Western Hemisphere, which
have been used for continuous
four-year crop rotation since
1881. '
Someone should compile a book
of strange awards given on vari
ous campuses. One of the most
esteemed tokens presented by The
Daily is an old wine bottle, the
Julie Olsen award, while at the
U. of Minnesota a red oil can is
one of the highest honors. The
oil can has been presented every
year since 191G to the student or
faculty member who has made
an outstanding contribution to
student life on the campus.
