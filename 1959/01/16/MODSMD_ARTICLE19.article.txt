Congratulations
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to Paul Dague
and the lIR for the success of the
Russia Institute. The three speak
ers Wednesday night had good in
formation, well-formulated opin
ions, and each attained his goal
of condensing a great deal of valid
material into a 20-minute talk.
Mrs. Harris' seminar after the
opening session was excellent too.
All in all, the best one-shot confer
ence I've attended at Stanford.
Brent Barksdale

The editorial writer of "Many
Crutches" deserves a "well done."
Fine content, exceptional compo
sition, and a finish indicative of
the professional. A salute to a
good mind at work!
