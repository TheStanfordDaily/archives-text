# STERLING'S SPEECH
## Hold Enrollment Steady: Wise Policy for Future 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
When President Sterling spoke
at his first all-University assem
bly last week he iriafle a lot of
jokes; some of them were funny,
some were not. We thought he
did much better when he made
some statements about Stanford's
future.
Me said in effect that Stanford
ford was going to hold its enroll
ment at the present level by mak
ing its standards for admittance
tougher in the face of a predicted
doubling of applications. Jn so do
ing he did a little philosophizing
about the theory of educaiion
something sorely needed here in
('alifornia especially.
American Ideal
The president mentioned the
American ideal that every indi
vidual should have the opportu
nity for as much education as his
ability and ambition will allow
him. The key word here should
be AfeILITY, instead it has be
come OPPORTUNITY. And Cali
fornia is the leader in the philoso
phy that lets everyone go to
school as long as he wants, re
gardless of ability.
California provides for its "stu
dents" the largest university in
the world, an extensive system of
lesser four-year state colleges and
a complete network of city junior
colleges, which do not even re
quire a high school diploma for
admittance, only that one be 18
years old. New York State, the
most populous state in the Union,
by comparison, does not maintain

a stale university, does not main
tain any state colleges, does not
cany "opporunity" to the ridicu
lous extreme o! those advanced
high schools for overgrown ado
lescents known as "JC's."
For Higher Intellect
We endorse President Sterling's
thoughts about the theory of edu
cation, feeling that higher educa
tion is for those of higher intel
lect, not simply of higher age, and
are glad that he is not like thou
sands of university presidents
across this country who view the
prospective doubling of enroll
ment in the next 10 years as a
fulfillment of the A m e r i c a n
dream. This American dream is
a lot of hooey, and it is about time
California and the rest of the
United States realized it.
Obligation Felt
The United States feels the ob
ligation to provide public educa
tion. This has been perverted in
the name of "democracy" and
"equality of opportunity" to mean
that everyone has a RIGHT to
higher education. No one has a
right to higher education; they
have tf) earn it, and if they don't
measure up, then let them get out
and get to work. Junior colleges
mean just two more years of not

having to work for a lot of people
with average intelligence. They
are a rationalization for laziness.
11' tlie president puts his thoughts
into effect, Stanford of the future
will remain a true university, a
gathering place of dedicated stu
dents and intelligent teachers,
when other schools have become
refugee camps, huge pens for
sluggards trying to escape respon
sibility.
Stanford's reputation as a cen
ter of It-anting will go up with
each passing day. A Stanford di
ploma will be more and more
valuable as other colleges lower
their standards.
Fight for Teachers
The only trouble with this is
that as other colleges increase
their enrollment, they will also
increase their faculty, making the
fight for good teachers harder
and harder. Well, so be it. Stan
ford will just have to fight harder
for its professors. It will have to
fight until the United States ma
tures and realizes, like England,
which Americans tend to consider
a declining nation, that higher ed
ucation should be selective. There
is no RIGHT to a university de
gree.
