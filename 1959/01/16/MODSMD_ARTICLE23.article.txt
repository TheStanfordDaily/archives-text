# Indians Meet Bears in Crucial PCC Series
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Steve Baffrey, Sports Editor 
Tonight's the night—or one of thern at least—during which the
final Pacific Coast Championship may be decided. It's the night for
Stanford and Cal to begin their weekend hoine-and-home series here
in the Stanford Pavilion. Tomorrow night the scene shifts to Men's
Gym at Cal.
The Cold and Blue don't have far to look down from their perch

the PCC standings to see the
dark • horse Indians in second
place. This fact, combined with
the closeness of both squads' of
fensive and d e 112 en si v e games,
makes the weekend series t lie
most interesting on the coast.
For Howie Dallmar's Indians,

victory, or at least a split in the
series, has come to look like the
hope for a better tomorrow, or
March 6, as the case may be. This
is the date the loop wraps up its
final season.
Cal is the defending PCC cham
pion, and although the Bears were
not figured to burn up the league
this year, the Pete Newell-coached
club has begun to loom over the
pack as the team to beat.
Not Since I9f>(i
Stanford last defeated the Ber
keley foe in 1956, but the second
win that year marked the end of
a three-year winning streak and
the beginning of a drought.
The series dates back to the
start of PCC play in 1916, and
probably beyond that. Cal has the
edge in PCC records with an 80-51
record.
Stanford has lost suicide squad
guard John Stabler for at least
two weeks. Stahler has come
down with mononucleosis, and his
place on the second unit will be
filled by Tom Crawford.
Bright spots appeared in the
Stanford news this week when it
was evident that forward Jerry
Thuesen, guard Doug Warren and
center N'eal Brockmeyer would all
be ready to see action this week
end.
Warren will probably open at
one of the guard positions, but it
is unlikely that Thuesen, recover
ing from pneumonia, will jump
back in with the starters. John
Hendry, who has done a good job
of filling in for Thuesen, should
open at one forward post.
Brockmeyer Back
Brockmeyer, on the road back
from the flu. will resume his spot
on the second unit.
Other Stanford starters will he
Card scoring leader Paul Neu
mann at guard, Dick Ilaga at cen
ter and John Arrillaga at forward.
Newell will go with top scorer

Tonight's the night—or one of thern at least—during which the
final Pacific Coast Championship may be decided. It's the night for
Stanford and Cal to begin their weekend hoine-and-home series here
in the Stanford Pavilion. Tomorrow night the scene shifts to Men's
Gym at Cal.
The Cold and Blue don't have far to look down from their perch

the PCC standings to see the
dark • horse Indians in second
place. This fact, combined with
the closeness of both squads' of
fensive and d e 112 en si v e games,
makes the weekend series t lie
most interesting on the coast.
For Howie Dallmar's Indians,

victory, or at least a split in the
series, has come to look like the
hope for a better tomorrow, or
March 6, as the case may be. This
is the date the loop wraps up its
final season.
Cal is the defending PCC cham
pion, and although the Bears were
not figured to burn up the league
this year, the Pete Newell-coached
club has begun to loom over the
pack as the team to beat.
Not Since I9f>(i
Stanford last defeated the Ber
keley foe in 1956, but the second
win that year marked the end of
a three-year winning streak and
the beginning of a drought.
The series dates back to the
start of PCC play in 1916, and
probably beyond that. Cal has the
edge in PCC records with an 80-51
record.
Stanford has lost suicide squad
guard John Stabler for at least
two weeks. Stahler has come
down with mononucleosis, and his
place on the second unit will be
filled by Tom Crawford.
Bright spots appeared in the
Stanford news this week when it
was evident that forward Jerry
Thuesen, guard Doug Warren and
center N'eal Brockmeyer would all
be ready to see action this week
end.
Warren will probably open at
one of the guard positions, but it
is unlikely that Thuesen, recover
ing from pneumonia, will jump
back in with the starters. John
Hendry, who has done a good job
of filling in for Thuesen, should
