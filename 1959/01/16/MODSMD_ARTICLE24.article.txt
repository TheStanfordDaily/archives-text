# GRANDSTAND VIEW
## A 						Good Idea 
### Sieve Baffrey 
Stanford's variety of let.'s-yell
more-and-varied yells at basket
ball games will get its chances
tonight and tomorrow when the
big, bad wolf . . . err, Bear . . .
takes on the Indians.
Head yell leader Dick Stanford,
urged by many and for long, is
going to give the pepped-up idea
a Iry this week end, and it sounds
like a pretty good thing. One of
the most recurrent comments this
season, beside "Do you think
Stanford will win the champion
ship?", has been pointed at Ihe
fact that it doesn't seem like a
good college game without lots
of cheering.
Stanford wants fans who feel
like yelling more yells, and more
often, to gather on the south side
of the Pavilion, across from the
Indians' bench, for some concen
trated yelling at the C'al bunch—
which comes in droves and sits
behind the Bears.
There's been a distinct feeling
that our time-outs this season
have been devoted more to music
and dancing than to spirit. This,
without doubt, is true. But lest
the Red Vest Band and the Pom
pon (iirls, bolh of which have
done a good job over the past
couple of years, get thf 4 wrong
idea- let us say they have been
enjoyed very much.
But there is a place for more
yelling at basketball games, this
writer is told, and it seems that
this week end is both a good time
to start and a good time to ex
periment.
The C'al games always generate
lots of spirit, and in the past the
always-opened-mouthed Berkeley
crowd has come away with a vic-

Tory in the yelling contest which
goes along with the one down on
the court.
It looks like this won't happen
this year—at least not without a
good fight from Stanford. And
as long as we're well enough
equipped to give them a good
fight on the court, I'm glad to see
we're going to give them one in
the stands.
Dick, we hope, will get a lot of
support in his desire to please
what has been the request of an
apparently large segment of Stan
ford basketball fans.
SHORT NOTES: Couldn't help
but notice what television cover
age of a Stanford game does to
people in the Pavilion. Don't
think I've ever seen all five yell
leaders at a game at once before.
Nor have the pomponners ever
"looked up" as much as they did
last Saturday eve.
And, in fact, even the game an
nouncer, NBC's Ed McCauly, who
the night before showed up in a
sport shirt, came tie-and-jacketed
to the Husky fracas.
I'm criticizing? Not on your
life! I thought it looked good,
and it made me wish that TV
were going to be around more
often. But, then, if it were too
common, perhaps we wouldn't get
treated this often.
Me? No, I forgot to shave and
came in a sport shirt.

the Red Vest Band and the Pom
pon (iirls, bolh of which have
done a good job over the past
couple of years, get thf 4 wrong
idea- let us say they have been
enjoyed very much.
But there is a place for more
yelling at basketball games, this
writer is told, and it seems that
this week end is both a good time
to start and a good time to ex
periment.
The C'al games always generate
lots of spirit, and in the past the
always-opened-mouthed Berkeley
crowd has come away with a vic-

Tory in the yelling contest which
goes along with the one down on
the court.
It looks like this won't happen
this year—at least not without a
good fight from Stanford. And
as long as we're well enough
equipped to give them a good
fight on the court, I'm glad to see
we're going to give them one in
the stands.
Dick, we hope, will get a lot of
support in his desire to please
what has been the request of an
apparently large segment of Stan
ford basketball fans.
SHORT NOTES: Couldn't help
but notice what television cover
age of a Stanford game does to
people in the Pavilion. Don't
think I've ever seen all five yell
leaders at a game at once before.
Nor have the pomponners ever
"looked up" as much as they did
last Saturday eve.
And, in fact, even the game an
nouncer, NBC's Ed McCauly, who
the night before showed up in a
sport shirt, came tie-and-jacketed
to the Husky fracas.
I'm criticizing? Not on your
life! I thought it looked good,
and it made me wish that TV
were going to be around more
often. But, then, if it were too
common, perhaps we wouldn't get
treated this often.
Me? No, I forgot to shave and
came in a sport shirt.

Stanford's variety of let.'s-yell
more-and-varied yells at basket
ball games will get its chances
tonight and tomorrow when the
big, bad wolf . . . err, Bear . . .
takes on the Indians.
Head yell leader Dick Stanford,
urged by many and for long, is
going to give the pepped-up idea
a Iry this week end, and it sounds
like a pretty good thing. One of
the most recurrent comments this
season, beside "Do you think
Stanford will win the champion
ship?", has been pointed at Ihe
fact that it doesn't seem like a
good college game without lots
of cheering.
Stanford wants fans who feel
like yelling more yells, and more
often, to gather on the south side
of the Pavilion, across from the
Indians' bench, for some concen
trated yelling at the C'al bunch—
which comes in droves and sits
behind the Bears.
There's been a distinct feeling

have been devoted more to music
and dancing than to spirit. This,
