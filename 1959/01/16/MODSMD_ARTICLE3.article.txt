# IFC Proposal Review Today
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
The semi • circular canals of
Deans Brown, Craig and Winbig
ler are duo for another shaking
up this morning at 11:30 when
they review the latest Interfrater
nily Council proposal in the up
and-down question — how often
women can go upstairs in men's
residences and when they have to
come down again.
The latest IFC suggestion to
disturb the current first-floor
only equilibrium provides for two
permanent open houses a week
which may be registered at the
beginning of each quarter for ev
ery week.
In addition the new plan would
allow special open houses to be
registered individually once a
week, for card parties, study
nights and the like.
This latest try at getting some
expanded open house plan past
the deans was passed at an IFC
meeling Monday night after the
proposal to allow girls upstairs
until 10:30 p.m. on weekdays and
midnight on weekends had been
rejected earlier that day.
Attached to that suggestion
was a joint enforcement provi
sion making women responsible
to Women's Council and men to
their individual fraternity. This
same provision is the enforce
ment clause of the new plan.
The proposal also provides for
a review of the question at the
end of spring quarter.
