# CUBA
## 'Democratic' Executions Continue

HAVANA, Cuba (/P) â€” Rebel
leader Fidel Castro warned the
United States sharply Thursday
against meddling with Cuba's rev
olutionary justice. He declared
that if U.S. Marines were sent to
this island nation "200,000 grin
gos will die."
Gringo is a term used by some
Latin Americans, often in a de
rogatory sense, for U.S. citizens.
About 12,000 live in Cuba.
Castro referred to the Marines,
without elaboration, at the close
of a bitter speech before 60 to 70
persons who surrounded him in
the Havana Hilton Hotel lobby as
he headed to a Rotary Club lunch
eon.
"Halt Executions"
His threat presumably was
prompted by statements of some
U.S. congressmen that the State
Department should act to halt the
executions which have followed
the fall of President Fulgencio
Batista's dictatorship.
The reported toll of the firing
squads rose Thursday to 195.
"We are trying those who killed
20, 30 or 40 persons," Castro said,
"and they ask us to be humane!"
Castro, who reports he has
"given orders to shoot every one
of the murderers," turned aside
a photographer's inquiry about
the possibility of taking pictures
of executions. He said this will
not be done because of the reac
tion abroad.
Applause
The bearded rebel, who now
commands Cuba's armed forces,
drew applause with a reiteration
of his charges that the United
States helped Batista with arms
shipments and the assignment of
a U.S. military mission here.
"We are more democratic than
President Eisenhower," Castro
declared. "We are more demo
cratic than John Foster Dulles.
There is more liberty here than in
the United States. There is no
country in the world with more
liberty than Cuba."
Discussing tortures under the
Batista regime, Castro said there
is none in the revolutionary army
and that its morale is high.
Aid Denied
The U.S. government denied
siding with Batista. The State
Department said it had repeated
ly objected to what it called the
Batista government's misuse of
military aid proivded for defense
of the Western Hemisphere as a
whole. The arms shipments were
halted last spring.
Representative Wayne Hays
(D-Ohio), chairman of a Foreign
Affairs subcommittee, demanded
U.S. action, short of sending in
troops, to check the killings. He
suggested stiff economic meas
ures, such as cutting off Cuban
credit and banning further import
of Cuban sugar.
