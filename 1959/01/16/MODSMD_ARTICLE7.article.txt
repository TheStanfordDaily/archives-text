Questions on Stanford's regis
tration, admissions, grading and
examinations policies were asked
of Registrar Harvey Hall in an
ST&T discussion last night.
Hall was asked about his views
on semester versus quarter ar
rangements. lie favors a semes
ter system, which could "mini
mize the paraphernalia of educa
tion" and so leave more time for
individual work. He said he
thought the present system un
fortunately tends to divide
knowledge into so many small
packages" and (hat the semesler
system "might alleviate the pres
sure for grades."
While Hall was speaking in Un
ion, Associate General Secretary
James Triolo recalled Stanford's
history as an independent institu
tion as he talked with Lagunita
residents. According to Triolo,
Stanford has been offered state
financial aid many times, but the
provisions of Mrs. Leland Stan
ford's will prohibit such aid. He
said that Stanford will probably
become a state school if it does
not receive enough gifts.
Hall said that admissions offi
cials weight a student's apparent
motivation, including high school
grades, in deciding whether he
may come to Stanford. He said
that specific course requirements
for entrance will continue to in
crease.
Describing Stanford in Ger
many as "an unqualified success,"
Hall said that the University has
tentative plans for a second cen
ter, possibly in Florence, tlaiy,
within two or three years.
About grades, Hall said that
Stanford grades, in the limited
comparison he has made with
other schools, "run a little high."
The all-school average is about.
2.6. He said that the office of
Dean Philip Rhinelander is try
ing to remedy any "gross inequi
ties" among courses as to how
much work is required for each
unit.
In regard to the present ath
letic conference situation, Hall
said, "There is no present inclina
tion for Stanford to join the new
athletic associationâ€”the so-called
big four." Triolo in his talk said
the University attitude was
"watch and wait."
