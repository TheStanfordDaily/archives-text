# LASSU Won't Pay for Tour
## 
### 
Legislature took the first tenta
tive steps in expressing its con
cern in areas outside normal leg
islative authority and saved itself
$200 by rescinding the appropria
tion to send a two-man debate
team on an Eastern tour at its
weekly meeting in Bowman
Alumni House last night.
Representative .Robe r 1 Dins
more suggested that Legislature
pass recommendations favoring
charge accounts at the Bookstore
and a day-rate payment for grad
uate students staying in dormito
ries over vacations instead of pay
ing for the entire period.
Both motions were tabled pond
ing further information, but they
marked the first of what are err
tain to be several recommenda
tions by LASSU on University
problems.
The University will assume the
complete cost of sending Dan
Kremer and Woody Moyle on the
debate trip after a misunderstand
ing arose over who was respon
sible for choosing the team.
