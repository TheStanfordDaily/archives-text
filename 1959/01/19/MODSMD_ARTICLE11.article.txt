# Rocket Engine Disclosed

CHINA LAKE, Calif. (/I'i A new rocket engine
that should make space ships about as easy to
drive as automobiles . . .
And a safe way of packaging dangerous fuels
so missiles can be delivered to troops in the field
ready to fire instantly, without long countdowns.
Plus a prediction that this combination of en
gine and fuels will enable man to land gently on
the moonâ€”and lake off again. . . .
All these were disclosed Sunday by scientists of
the U.S. Naval ordnance test slalion .it China
Lake, where rocket propulsion studies have been
under way for 11 years.
Douglas D. Ordahl, head of the missile propul
sion division, told a news conference, "We hope to
make a test vehicle within the next six months."
The secret of Ihe engine is a valve similar to the
master cylinder of an automobile's hydraulic
brake system. This valve controls the flow of the
liquids into the engine's combustion chamber,
where they meet, explode and produce the thrust

that drives the rocket.
The engine uses two fluids, the names of which
ate classified as secret.
"These liquids can he stored indefinitely without
corroding their aluminum tanks," a spokesman
said. "A missile using this type of fuel could bo
loaded at the factory find stored for years. When
delivered to troops in the field, it could be fired on
a moment's notice. No countdown would be neces
sary."
The scientist said the major problem in space
travel is not lack of power, but. lack of control.
"We have engines that, could go to the moon."
he said, "if we had proper control over them. This
new engine gives us that-control.
"It means we can change direction and speed in
flight, that wo can slow down and make a feather
soft landing on the moon or any of the planets, and
take off again. It also means we can bring manned
satellites back from orbit without damage by con
trolling direction and speed as they re-enter the
atmosphere."
