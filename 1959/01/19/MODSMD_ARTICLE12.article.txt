# AS MIKOYAN GOES
## U.S. to Map Big 4 Plans 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) The Unil<
talks with Anastas I. Mikoyan, v
allies this week about specific proj
for a Big Four meeting on Germai
President Eisenhower and Seen
were reported Sunday to be hope
ful their talks with the Soviet
deputy premier may lead eventu
ally to a softening of Moscow's
German policies. They particu
larly hope to avert a war-threat
ening crisis over Berlin.
Mikoyan is scheduled to leave
Tuesday for Moscow to report to
Soviet Premier N'ikita Khru
shchev and to get ready for a big
Communist Party meeting later
this month.
U.S. Will Delay Note
State Department authorities
attach so much importance to the
way in which Soviet leaders deal
with the Mikoyan mission that ]
they expect to delay sending a
new note to the Soviets about an
East-West conference on the Ger
man situation until after they get
reports on what happens at the
party congress.
The party meeting will begin
Jan. 27. Whatever Mikoyan says
there, U.S. officials believe, must
be carefully weighed for its poten
tial effect on Soviet policies and
Communist doctrines.
Mikoyan talked softly while he
was in Washington, assuring ev
eryone that Khrushchev had not
given the Western powers an ul
timatum to get out of Berlin.
Beliefâ€”lf
If Mikoyan and Khrushchev
take the same line at the party
meeting U.S. officials would be
inclined to believe it; whereas Mi
koyan's soft talk in this country
may have been to create a friend
ly atmosphere for his meetings
with Dulles and Eisenhower.
The two U.S. leaders used the
sessions with Mikoyan to try to
get across a single critical point;
that the United States and its al
lies are determined not to back
down on the Berlin issue. They
will not withdraw their forces
from West Berlin and will not ac
cept the authority of East Ger
many's Communist regime as a
substitute for Soviet responsibil
ity to keep open supply lines from
West Germany into Berlin.
Deliberate Strategy
Their desire to show Mikoyan
they were in deadly earnest about
this and that too much Soviet
pressure would create a grave
risk of war was deliberate and
calculated. It was designed to try
to get across to Khrushchev that
the Western powers arc not pre
pared to bargain over the Berlin
question and that on this point
there can be no compromise.
They hope Mikoyan can per
suade Khrushchev of this. They
a Ist) hope he may impress upon
Khrushchev the tremendous in
dustrial power of the United
States which Mikoyan had an op
portunity to observe at first hand.
If this design is reali/.ed, Eisen
hower and Dulles were said to
feel that a foreign ministers' con
ference could reasonably be ex
pected to find a formula for avert
ing a military crisis over Berlin.
