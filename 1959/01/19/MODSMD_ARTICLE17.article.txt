The statement which Friday's
Daily attributed to Alexander Ke
rensky in which he negated the
possibility of the Soviet regime
changing within ihe next 100
years was incorrect.
Kerensky clarified the misun
edrstanding Friday by asserting
that "no one can predict what
will happen to the political flank
in the Soviet Union even in the
next 10 years."
