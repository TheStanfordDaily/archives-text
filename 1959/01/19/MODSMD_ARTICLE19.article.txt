## Realize Role 
### 
Apparently one of the most con
structive results of last weekend's
Legislature hostel was the reali
zation by Legislature members of
their role as an interest group.
At Thursday's Legislature
meeting two resolutions in the
student interest were presented
by graduate representative Rob
ert Dinsmore. One was to go on
record as desiring charge ac
counts in the new bookstore (if
and when it is constructed) and
the other was to make it possible
for graduate students to spend
part of Christmas vacation in
their dorms without paying a fee
for the full time.
We hope Dinsmore doesn't feel
the "cautious" legislators
"squashed" his efforts. It appears
that he wants to set up a situa
tion like a debate the resolution
is approved and then debated. It
doesn't work quite this way. We
agree with those members of the
Legislature who want to be sure
what they are doing before they
press an issue.
However, we would like to
see more legislators doing what
Dinsmore is doing — thinking
about student needs and wants.
There are numerous possibili
ties for legislative action of this
kind —housing, the sponsor sys
tem, academic affairs.
In approving resolutions on
«uch issues, of course, Legisla
ture atcion does not mean imme
diate effect. As ASSU President
John Bohn pointed out in his col
umn last Tuesday, in most areas
of the University the administra
tive officers have the final say.
But with serious and thoughtful
moves, the Legislature, we be
lieve, can be an effective lobbying
group.
Meanwhile, we applaud Dins
more for his efforts.

It is too early to report any
thing definite in our current poll.
The deadline is Tuesday for re
turning ballots. But we have been
glancing over some of the ballots
as they have been coming in and
have found some valuable com
ments.
We are gratified that some
members of the faculty and staff
have taken enough interest to re
turn ballots, but one of the curi
ous things is that two ballots
have been marked "faculty" but
not signed. Perhaps these two
faculty memebrs thought simply
that the names are unimportant
— which is true, except in our
checking of the validity of the
ballot. However, it might be that
these two faculty members were
afraid that their names might gel
out and they fear repercussions
from their colleagues. (This
might also be the reason we have

n't heard from others of the fac
ulty.) 11 is also possible that they
simply forgot to sign their names,
but this is unlikely since they did
check "faculty."
If they are afraid of letting
their views be known, we want
to ask a very loud WHY?
Another note about the ballot:
Naturally in this type of project
we cannot hope to get a truly rep
resentative segment of the Uni
versity community; nor do we
hope to have 100 per cent partici
pation. But it is our goal to stim
ulate interest and to find out, to
some extent, just how many here
tare what is going on around
them.
The answers we offered were
quite arbitrary; this is precisely
why your comments are so valu
able. We urge any who have not
yet returned ballots to us to do
so before tomorrow evening.
A note of apology: We were
as surprised as anyone to pick
up Friday's Daily and see a pic
ture of C. Easton Kothwell de
scribed as Alexander Kerensky.
We cannot excuse such a glar
ing error, but we do wish to
apologize for it.

We realize that winter quarter
is a busy one socially, culturally
and otherwise, but we are still dis
turbed upon looking at the con
centration of events on certain
days.
For example: Friday night's
program included the Sophomore
Cotillion, an International Panel
Discussion, Concert Series and
one of the major home basketball
games. This is a diversified
enough schedule that everyone
should find something to his
taste. The trouble is, a good
many students found more than
one event to their liking. All
right, one must make a decision.
Fine, but look at the listing for
Saturday night—an away basket
ball game.
More examples: Saturday, Feb.
14—Lagunita Dance, AWS Con
ference? "Quartetto Italiano,"
home basketball and Winter One-
Acts —plus Valentine's Day. Fri
day, Feb. 27—Greek Week Dance,
International Cabaret, Chamber
Music Concert, home basketball
and Stanford Players.
This does not include the vari
ous "I" Club functions on Fri
days—which they encourage any
student to attend.
We approve of the offering of a
wide variety of events to cater to
a number of interests; but such
on schedules as these, each event
is likely to suffer as is the possi
bility of the DEVELOPMENT of
many interests. Somethin's gotta
give.
