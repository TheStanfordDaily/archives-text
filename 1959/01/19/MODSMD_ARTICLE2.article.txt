# Hilton: How Secure Is Cubans' Freedom?
## 
### Cally Tanner 
Developments in Cuba during the past month give rise to many
questions one might well ask concerning the possible course of the
future. How secure is Cuba's new freedom? Is it likely to survive
the present unrest until the elections scheduled in 18 months?
Will Castro's power simply disolve into another dictatorship? And

how will these developments af
fect the United States?
Prof. Ronald Hilton, director of
the Hispanic - American Studies
Department, is of the opinon that,
while the Cubans are "wildly en
thusiastic" about their new free
dom at the present, it is conceiv
able that Castro may meet a fate
similar to that of another anti-
Batista leader in 1944.
Another Crusader
"I recall that when Batista fell
before, there was equal enthusi
asm over another crusader, who
within a few years was utterly
discredited," he said. "Provided
Castro avoids setting up a new
dictatorship, and doesn't allow his
state to become as corrupt as the
old one, Cuba may remain free."
As to the possibilities of Cas
tro's regime dissolving into an
other one-man rule, Hilton said,
"I am doubtful. Castro is a wild
man, but he represents the stu
dents and they oppose a dictator
ship in any form.
"Also, the liberal leaders in the
Caribbean area would turn their
backs on Castro if they thought
he was setting up such a system.
I think Castro realizes these dan
gers and will guard against
them."
Focus on Trujillo
"I do think Castro will attempt
to focus hatred on Trujillo," con
tinued Hilton. "At present this
hatred runs very deep in the Car
ibbean area. To some extent Tru
jillo will be very useful to Castro,
because he can direct many of the
animosities to him, which might
otherwise be aimed at leaders in
Castro's administration, possibly
Castro himself."
Many speculations have been
made concerning the 18 months'
postponement of the free elec
tions in Cuba. Castro revolted in
the name of the people: libera
tion. Why can't they be liberated
now?
Hilton commented, "They must
realize that it will take 18 months
to achieve sufficient stability for

a free election. There is danger,
however, thai t his time will cause
more unrest."
The mass executions recently
have surprised and disgusted
many who view these happenings
from a bystander's position. "We
are not aware of the depth of feel
ing in Latin America. Yet, while
these killings may scare some
trouble-makers there, all too fre
quently 'blood begets blood.' "
Kxample of Mexico
"As far as the United States is
concerned, I am of the opinion
that Cuba will eventually follow
the example of Mexico," said Hil
ton. Castro himself, at one time
a student there, asserted inten
tions in this direction.
According to Hilton, U.S. mili
tary assistance to Latin America
is now more discredited than
ever. Our pretention to help de
fend Cuba against external ag
gression, while arming only 600
men, seemed to be somewhat of a
contradiction, and "confirmed the
Latin Amei'ican belief that the
only result our aid could have
would be to strengthen a military
dictatorship."
Hilton further noted an almost
"un-Cuban austerity" among Cas
tro's supporters. "They are deter
mined to end Cuba's reputation as
a society where corruption can
flourish."

able that Castro may meet a fate
similar to that of another anti-
Batista leader in 1944.
Another Crusader
"I recall that when Batista fell
before, there was equal enthusi
asm over another crusader, who
within a few years was utterly
discredited," he said. "Provided
Castro avoids setting up a new
dictatorship, and doesn't allow his
state to become as corrupt as the
old one, Cuba may remain free."
As to the possibilities of Cas
tro's regime dissolving into an
other one-man rule, Hilton said,
"I am doubtful. Castro is a wild
man, but he represents the stu
dents and they oppose a dictator
ship in any form.
"Also, the liberal leaders in the
Caribbean area would turn their
backs on Castro if they thought
he was setting up such a system.
I think Castro realizes these dan
gers and will guard against
them."
Focus on Trujillo
"I do think Castro will attempt
to focus hatred on Trujillo," con
tinued Hilton. "At present this
hatred runs very deep in the Car
ibbean area. To some extent Tru
jillo will be very useful to Castro,
because he can direct many of the
animosities to him, which might
otherwise be aimed at leaders in
Castro's administration, possibly
Castro himself."
Many speculations have been
made concerning the 18 months'
postponement of the free elec
tions in Cuba. Castro revolted in
the name of the people: libera
tion. Why can't they be liberated
now?
Hilton commented, "They must
realize that it will take 18 months
to achieve sufficient stability for

a free election. There is danger,
however, thai t his time will cause
more unrest."
The mass executions recently
have surprised and disgusted
many who view these happenings
from a bystander's position. "We
are not aware of the depth of feel
ing in Latin America. Yet, while
these killings may scare some
trouble-makers there, all too fre
quently 'blood begets blood.' "
Kxample of Mexico
"As far as the United States is
concerned, I am of the opinion
that Cuba will eventually follow
the example of Mexico," said Hil
ton. Castro himself, at one time
a student there, asserted inten
tions in this direction.
According to Hilton, U.S. mili
tary assistance to Latin America
is now more discredited than
ever. Our pretention to help de
fend Cuba against external ag
gression, while arming only 600
men, seemed to be somewhat of a
contradiction, and "confirmed the
Latin Amei'ican belief that the
only result our aid could have
would be to strengthen a military
dictatorship."
Hilton further noted an almost
"un-Cuban austerity" among Cas
tro's supporters. "They are deter
mined to end Cuba's reputation as
a society where corruption can
flourish."
Developments in Cuba during the past month give rise to many
questions one might well ask concerning the possible course of the
future. How secure is Cuba's new freedom? Is it likely to survive
the present unrest until the elections scheduled in 18 months?
Will Castro's power simply disolve into another dictatorship? And

how will these developments af
fect the United States?
Prof. Ronald Hilton, director of
the Hispanic - American Studies
Department, is of the opinon that,
while the Cubans are "wildly en
thusiastic" about their new free
dom at the present, it is conceiv
able that Castro may meet a fate
similar to that of another anti-
Batista leader in 1944.
