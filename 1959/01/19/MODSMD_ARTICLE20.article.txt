Dining, Not Eating
Editor, The Daily:
Harvard is continually being
held up to us as a college which
has achieved a better "intellectual
atmosphere" than Stanford, so we
might well investigate how this
may have been accomplished.
An important idea at Harvard
is that much of the intellectual
exchange in a university occurs
at meals, and that the atmosphere
in the dining halls should encour
age it. This has been accomplish
ed in the following manner:
1. There are no hashers breath
ing down one's neck. Trays are
obtained cafeteria - style, as at
Stanford, but when through eat
ing, one takes one's tray and
shoves it through a window di
rectly to the dishwasher, making
the whole operation pleasanter
and cheaper.
2. Meals are served over longer
periods (dinners are from 5:30 to
6:45) but without so much addi
tional expense, as there are no
hashers.
3. Anyone can eat at any dining
hall at any meal as the gue-st of
a resident, by paying by the meal.
4. At evening meals anyone who
is signed on board at any house
or at the Graduate Center can eat
anywhere else free as the guest
of a resident (since he has paid
somewhere).
5. The house tutors (faculty or
advanced graduate students who
are invited to live in the house in
order to contribute intellect, not
to act as nursemaids) are encour
aged to eat in the dining halls;
and, since there are not enough

tables for everybody to have his
own. they sit and talk with the
students.
The improvement in atm o s
phere created by these simple im
provements is immense. Discus
sions interrupted by hunger can
be continued at meals, and there
is enough leisure for interesting
discussions to begin in the dining
hall. The most interesting dis
cussions, particularly of matters
outside my field, commonly oc
curred at meals, while I was at
Harvard.
The additional cost is not large,
however. I was shocked when I
first came to Stanford and found
I was not permitted even to eat
with my fellow graduate students
because I lived off campus and
was therefore unwilling to sign
on for all meals. Moreover, I
was not convinced by the argu
ment that to permit more free
dom would increase the expense
of the meals.
A few weeks with the above
system and any steward worth
his salt would be able to predict
attendance at any given meal
about as well as with the present
restrictive system, and any in
crease in error would easily be
covered by the customary slight
differential between regular and
transient rates.
If the administration here wants
to develop the University com
munity (and the president says
he does, whether or not his staff
does), I hope they will consider
how much can be accomplished
by such small improvements as
this.

Harvard is continually being
held up to us as a college which
has achieved a better "intellectual
atmosphere" than Stanford, so we
might well investigate how this
may have been accomplished.
An important idea at Harvard
is that much of the intellectual
exchange in a university occurs
at meals, and that the atmosphere
in the dining halls should encour
age it. This has been accomplish
ed in the following manner:
1. There are no hashers breath
ing down one's neck. Trays are
obtained cafeteria - style, as at
Stanford, but when through eat
ing, one takes one's tray and
shoves it through a window di
rectly to the dishwasher, making
the whole operation pleasanter
and cheaper.
2. Meals are served over longer
periods (dinners are from 5:30 to
6:45) but without so much addi
tional expense, as there are no
hashers.
3. Anyone can eat at any dining
hall at any meal as the gue-st of
a resident, by paying by the meal.
4. At evening meals anyone who
is signed on board at any house
or at the Graduate Center can eat
anywhere else free as the guest
of a resident (since he has paid
somewhere).
5. The house tutors (faculty or
advanced graduate students who
are invited to live in the house in
order to contribute intellect, not
to act as nursemaids) are encour
aged to eat in the dining halls;
and, since there are not enough

tables for everybody to have his
own. they sit and talk with the
students.
The improvement in atm o s
phere created by these simple im
provements is immense. Discus
sions interrupted by hunger can
be continued at meals, and there
is enough leisure for interesting
discussions to begin in the dining
hall. The most interesting dis
cussions, particularly of matters
outside my field, commonly oc
curred at meals, while I was at
Harvard.
The additional cost is not large,
however. I was shocked when I
first came to Stanford and found
I was not permitted even to eat
with my fellow graduate students
because I lived off campus and
was therefore unwilling to sign
on for all meals. Moreover, I
was not convinced by the argu
ment that to permit more free
dom would increase the expense
of the meals.
A few weeks with the above
system and any steward worth
his salt would be able to predict
attendance at any given meal
about as well as with the present
restrictive system, and any in
crease in error would easily be
covered by the customary slight
differential between regular and
transient rates.
If the administration here wants

munity (and the president says
