# Grad Studies in Moscow
## 
### 
On Jan. 27 of la째t year Russia
and the United States signed the
first agreement to date for an
exchange of graduate students.
Only 20 men were honored with
an invitation to study in Prussian
universities for one year, one of
them a Stanford graduate stu
dent, Alexander Riasanov.sky.
Because no American students
had previously been enrolled in
a Russian university, Riasanov
sky has had to serve as a sort of
unofficial ambassador.
He has been prepared for this
by a varied background. His fa
ther is a noted Oriental scholar,
his mother, Nina Fedrova, an au
thor, and his brother a Russian
history professor. Riasanovsky
himself held a Rhodes scholarship
for three years at St. John's Col
lege, Oxford, and served as a
paartrooper during the war. The
29-year-old student taught as a
Western Civ instructor while he
was specializing in Russian his
tory.
Below is a letter which Riasa
novsky wrote to Dean Rhineland

er telling of his life at the Uni
! versity of Moscow.
The first snows of the year
have fallen here in Moscow
bringing with thern a tempo
rary pause in the activities of
I the American students at the
University. . . .
The newness of being a grad
uate student ("aspirant") in a
Soviet university has not worn
off as yet, although we all are
settled very comfortably and
are well into our work. 1 have
been able to find most of the
materials necessary for my
Stanford dissertation, parts of
which I am reworking in Rus
sian and presenting to the di
rector of my studies here.
I was fortunate to have been
assigned to Academician B. A.
Rybakov, an archeologist and
historian with an international
reputation. Although he has
noted points of disagreement
between my views on Russian
ninth century history and those
generally accepted here, he has
been very kind, helpful and en
couraging. . . .

We were well received at
Moscow University (full name,
Moscow Order of Lenin and of
the Red Banner of Labor Gov
ernment University in the
Name of M. V. Lomonosov; as
one American remarked, "Now
1 know why they have no cheer
leaders at football games") and
have been given ample opportu
nity to see much of the city and
surrounding areas . . . The
theater, ballet and cinema are
excellent; the opera less so, for
there is really no first-class
tenor or soprano, although the
choruses are first rate.
This year promises to be a
full one and highly rewarding.
The experience of it will. 1 feel,
serve me very well in my teach
ing. Thank you again for your
kindness.
Yours very sincerely,

Rybakov, an archeologist and

On Jan. 27 of la째t year Russia
and the United States signed the
first agreement to date for an
exchange of graduate students.
Only 20 men were honored with
an invitation to study in Prussian
universities for one year, one of
them a Stanford graduate stu
dent, Alexander Riasanov.sky.
Because no American students
had previously been enrolled in
a Russian university, Riasanov
sky has had to serve as a sort of
unofficial ambassador.
He has been prepared for this
by a varied background. His fa

his mother, Nina Fedrova, an au
thor, and his brother a Russian
history professor. Riasanovsky
himself held a Rhodes scholarship
for three years at St. John's Col

paartrooper during the war. The
29-year-old student taught as a
Western Civ instructor while he
was specializing in Russian his
