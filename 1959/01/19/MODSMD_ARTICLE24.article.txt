# Stones Article Prompts Plan for Stuttgart
## 
### 
In December of last year Dr.
Wilfred H. Stone, faculty resident
of Muir and Burbank in Stern,
wrote for Sequoia an article ana
lyzing some of the current prob
lems of housing at Stanford and
proposing some steps toward so
lution.
Since then the article has be
come the basis for many discus
sions and further suggestions. In
a letter to the editor, Bill Ster
ling, chairman of publicity of the
current contingent at Stanford-in-
Germany, presented the following
ideas:
. . Dr. Stone has eloquently
stated the philosophy which 1
think most critical minds cannot
refrain from lauding.
"This philosophy, as he writes,
'wants genius and brilliance to
thrive and not to be leveled out or
forced underground ... it insists
that the individual's self-discovery
and self-realization are more im
portant than his capacity to earn
money, or his status with the
group ... [it embodies 1 the idea
that education is a way of life and
not merely a means to livelihood.'
"These are lofty and noble
phrases; yet they can be properly
measured only insofar as their
implications ai-e realized in every
day campus activity. . . .
"Implementation of these ideals
must necessarily be gradual: un
due haste brings retrogressive re
action and leads to poorly thought
out conclusions. . . .
"It is therefore my contention
that in the future the accumula
tive value of very specific and
rather narrow steps will deter
mine progress. The details of the
total advance may indeed be lim
ited and of strict application in
themselves; yet, regarded as a

whole, the over-all tendency will
show an actual realization of the
principles expressed ideally.
"And, lest I become an object
of my own criticism, I proceed to
the specific proposals I have in
mind. The Stanford-in-Germany
program is already imbued with
an air of experiment, and the Beu
telsbach atmosphere should be
naturally receptive of ideas ex
tended experimentally. . . .
"In the first instance, I propose
that midterms be eliminated from
the Stanford - in - Germany pro
gram. I would add further em
phasis on hav.ing the student as
sume more personal responsibil
ity, on having him gain greater
academic self-reliance.
"And, as a corollary, I propose
that 'think' papers might well
serve to replace midterms, if, in
deed, the omission of midterms
seems to be too great a rent in
the organizational, mechanical, op
erative fabric. . . .
"And, secondly, I propose that
we strive for comprehensive fi
nals. Now, I admit right away
that the practical difficulties seem
insurmountable, but I persist in
arguing that, unless we assault
the seemingly impossible, nothing
of value is going to emerge of its
own accord. We shall sit still and
jell into a mass of star-spangled
mediocrity.
"My proposal applies in detail
strictly to the present second ses

sion; in theory and inference I
hope it is of wider scope.
"My first thought was to hold
for a comprehensive examination
at the end of each winter and
spring quarter. This seems to me
feasible in the winter, where ar
chitecture and literature lend
themselves to a merger. (1 insert
here that German should proba
bly be tested separately. In the
spring, however, political science
and literature are not nearly so
compatible.
"I resolve therefore to hold
rather for a comprehensive exam
ination at the end of six months
for the two literature courses—
which, after all, are intended to be
a series. Architecture and politi
cal science would each have their
own finals.

"The method of grading the
comprehensive examination in the
spring would be the same as that
used by the Independent Studies
program in Western Civ.: the stu
dent receives a grade for the
Whole course at the end of two
quarters; no grade is given at the
end of three months.
"In conclusion, I would direct
one last breath at the flag which
has fluttered throughout this
piece. This flag stands for an in
dividual approach to education as
a system whereby separate de
partments and facets of study are
viewed within one whole intellec
tual, living 'Weltanschauung.'
"My outstanding hope is to see
Stanford become an institution
where perspective is comprehen
sive, not piecemeal; where learn

ing is a vital and enduring pro
cess, not an inorganic and mean
ingless capsule to be swallowed
and disgorged; where students
are individuals and not flocks of
committee members.

Stanford become an institution

"Bill Sterling."
In December of last year Dr.
Wilfred H. Stone, faculty resident
of Muir and Burbank in Stern,
wrote for Sequoia an article ana
lyzing some of the current prob
lems of housing at Stanford and
proposing some steps toward so
lution.
Since then the article has be
come the basis for many discus
sions and further suggestions. In
a letter to the editor, Bill Ster
ling, chairman of publicity of the
current contingent at Stanford-in-
Germany, presented the following
ideas:
. . Dr. Stone has eloquently
stated the philosophy which 1
think most critical minds cannot
refrain from lauding.
"This philosophy, as he writes,
'wants genius and brilliance to
thrive and not to be leveled out or
forced underground ... it insists
that the individual's self-discovery
and self-realization are more im
portant than his capacity to earn
money, or his status with the
group ... [it embodies 1 the idea
that education is a way of life and
not merely a means to livelihood.'
"These are lofty and noble
phrases; yet they can be properly
measured only insofar as their
implications ai-e realized in every
day campus activity. . . .
"Implementation of these ideals
must necessarily be gradual: un
due haste brings retrogressive re
action and leads to poorly thought
out conclusions. . . .
"It is therefore my contention
that in the future the accumula
tive value of very specific and
rather narrow steps will deter
mine progress. The details of the
total advance may indeed be lim
ited and of strict application in
themselves; yet, regarded as a

whole, the over-all tendency will
show an actual realization of the
principles expressed ideally.
"And, lest I become an object
of my own criticism, I proceed to
the specific proposals I have in
mind. The Stanford-in-Germany
program is already imbued with
an air of experiment, and the Beu
telsbach atmosphere should be
naturally receptive of ideas ex
tended experimentally. . . .
"In the first instance, I propose
that midterms be eliminated from
the Stanford - in - Germany pro
gram. I would add further em
phasis on hav.ing the student as
sume more personal responsibil
ity, on having him gain greater
academic self-reliance.
"And, as a corollary, I propose
that 'think' papers might well
serve to replace midterms, if, in
deed, the omission of midterms
seems to be too great a rent in
the organizational, mechanical, op
erative fabric. . . .
"And, secondly, I propose that
we strive for comprehensive fi
nals. Now, I admit right away
that the practical difficulties seem
insurmountable, but I persist in
arguing that, unless we assault
the seemingly impossible, nothing
of value is going to emerge of its
own accord. We shall sit still and
jell into a mass of star-spangled
mediocrity.
"My proposal applies in detail
strictly to the present second ses

sion; in theory and inference I
hope it is of wider scope.
"My first thought was to hold
for a comprehensive examination
at the end of each winter and
spring quarter. This seems to me
feasible in the winter, where ar
chitecture and literature lend
themselves to a merger. (1 insert
here that German should proba
bly be tested separately. In the
spring, however, political science
and literature are not nearly so
compatible.
"I resolve therefore to hold
rather for a comprehensive exam
ination at the end of six months
for the two literature courses—
which, after all, are intended to be
a series. Architecture and politi
cal science would each have their
own finals.

"The method of grading the
comprehensive examination in the
spring would be the same as that
used by the Independent Studies
program in Western Civ.: the stu
dent receives a grade for the
Whole course at the end of two
quarters; no grade is given at the
end of three months.
"In conclusion, I would direct
one last breath at the flag which
has fluttered throughout this
piece. This flag stands for an in
dividual approach to education as
a system whereby separate de
partments and facets of study are
viewed within one whole intellec
tual, living 'Weltanschauung.'

one last breath at the flag which
has fluttered throughout this
piece. This flag stands for an in
dividual approach to education as
a system whereby separate de
partments and facets of study are
viewed within one whole intellec
tual, living 'Weltanschauung.'
"My outstanding hope is to see
Stanford become an institution
where perspective is comprehen

ing is a vital and enduring pro

"Bill Sterling."
In December of last year Dr.
Wilfred H. Stone, faculty resident
of Muir and Burbank in Stern,
wrote for Sequoia an article ana
lyzing some of the current prob
lems of housing at Stanford and
proposing some steps toward so
lution.
Since then the article has be
come the basis for many discus
sions and further suggestions. In
a letter to the editor, Bill Ster
ling, chairman of publicity of the
current contingent at Stanford-in-
Germany, presented the following
ideas:
. . Dr. Stone has eloquently
stated the philosophy which 1
think most critical minds cannot
refrain from lauding.
"This philosophy, as he writes,
'wants genius and brilliance to
thrive and not to be leveled out or
forced underground ... it insists
that the individual's self-discovery
and self-realization are more im
portant than his capacity to earn
money, or his status with the
group ... [it embodies 1 the idea
that education is a way of life and
not merely a means to livelihood.'
"These are lofty and noble
phrases; yet they can be properly
measured only insofar as their
implications ai-e realized in every
day campus activity. . . .
"Implementation of these ideals
must necessarily be gradual: un
due haste brings retrogressive re
action and leads to poorly thought
out conclusions. . . .
"It is therefore my contention
that in the future the accumula
tive value of very specific and
rather narrow steps will deter
mine progress. The details of the
total advance may indeed be lim
ited and of strict application in
themselves; yet, regarded as a

whole, the over-all tendency will
show an actual realization of the
principles expressed ideally.
"And, lest I become an object
of my own criticism, I proceed to
the specific proposals I have in
mind. The Stanford-in-Germany
program is already imbued with
an air of experiment, and the Beu
telsbach atmosphere should be
naturally receptive of ideas ex
tended experimentally. . . .
"In the first instance, I propose
that midterms be eliminated from
the Stanford - in - Germany pro
gram. I would add further em
phasis on hav.ing the student as
sume more personal responsibil
ity, on having him gain greater
academic self-reliance.
"And, as a corollary, I propose
that 'think' papers might well
serve to replace midterms, if, in
deed, the omission of midterms
seems to be too great a rent in
the organizational, mechanical, op
erative fabric. . . .
"And, secondly, I propose that
we strive for comprehensive fi
nals. Now, I admit right away
that the practical difficulties seem
insurmountable, but I persist in
arguing that, unless we assault
the seemingly impossible, nothing
of value is going to emerge of its
own accord. We shall sit still and
jell into a mass of star-spangled
mediocrity.
"My proposal applies in detail
strictly to the present second ses

sion; in theory and inference I
hope it is of wider scope.
"My first thought was to hold
for a comprehensive examination
at the end of each winter and
spring quarter. This seems to me
feasible in the winter, where ar
chitecture and literature lend
themselves to a merger. (1 insert
here that German should proba
bly be tested separately. In the
spring, however, political science
and literature are not nearly so
compatible.
"I resolve therefore to hold
rather for a comprehensive exam
ination at the end of six months
for the two literature courses—
which, after all, are intended to be
a series. Architecture and politi
cal science would each have their
own finals.

"The method of grading the
comprehensive examination in the
spring would be the same as that
used by the Independent Studies
program in Western Civ.: the stu
dent receives a grade for the
Whole course at the end of two
quarters; no grade is given at the
end of three months.
"In conclusion, I would direct
one last breath at the flag which
has fluttered throughout this
piece. This flag stands for an in
dividual approach to education as
a system whereby separate de
partments and facets of study are
viewed within one whole intellec
