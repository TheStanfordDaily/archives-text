# FROM FIRST TO THIRD
## Friday: Indians, 56-53; Saturday: Oops! 67-46 
### Steve Baffrey Spoils Editor 
Anybody's mid-season predicter
trying to pick a winner in the
last PCC basketball race would
have a hard time after last week
end's Cal - Stanford series. Stan
ford took the Pavilion opener 56-
53, and then dropped the road
game, Saturday night at Men's
Gym in Berkeley, 67-16.
The only significance in the two
games, and this really isn't very
significant, comes from the wide
margin of Cal's victory.
A tired Card first unit that just
couldn't match the determined
Cal effort and fell further and
further behind, was the Saturday
night story.
No Suicide Squad
And :i tiling Indian first team,
forced to play when Coach Howie
Dallmar's suicide squad proved
ineffective Friday night, was the
reason why the Stanford's didn't
come away any better than three
points then.
Led by ace scorer Paul Neu
mann, the Cards rolled up an im
pressive lead which hovered about
10 points for most of the Friday
night second half. With five min
utes to go in the game the locals
were sitting, apparently light, on
an 11-point front.
Nine quick Bear points put a
scare into the tiring Redmen hut
guards Doug Warren and Neu
mann, each shooting from the gift
toss line, added four counters to
ice the win in the final seconds.
N e u m a n n paced the game's
scorers with 20 counters. Center
Dick Ilaga and forward John Ar
rillaga ranked next in Card scor
ing with 16 and 12 points in that
order. Six-ten center Darrall Im
hoff topped the Blue and Gold
with 16.
Short Glory
Friday night's win pushed the
Cards up into a first-place tie
with UCLA, victor over USC. Sat
urday's loss, however, dropped
the locals into third behind UC

LA, again victorious over SC, and
Cal.
Stanford dumped in 19 of 42
field goals in pulling home on Fri
day, a 45 per cent mark. At the
free throw line the Cards dropped
in 19 out of 27 for a 67 percent
age. Cal went .37 and .57 in these
departments.
Dallmar's quintet rebounded
and defended well, probably the
best they have done this season.
But it wasn't the rebounds, where
they did a little better than 50 per
cent, where they won the game.
Forty minutes of scrappy ball,
Neumann, and a cold Cal squad
all went into the Stanford Friday
night victory.
Short-Lived Load
California jumped to an early
3-0 lead before Stanford got go
ing. The Cards tied the game al
3-3, then battled on, tying Cal
twice in the early going, and took
the "for-good" lead at 12-10 with
nine minutes to go in the half.
Haga found it rough going in
this half as he picked up four
personals guarding the Cal big
man, Imhoff. Bui the Injun center
played a brilliant second half de
spite the handicap, and matched

Neumann's all-kinds, all-sizes
shooting with some eye-openers
from the outside.
In the second stanza it was
D-D-D ("D" for defense) for Stan
ford, and the nation's No. 2 defen
sive squad did a good job of hold
ing back the top-rated.
Study in Contrast
Saturday night was a study in
contrast. From the hot Stanford
cold Cal closie of Friday, the
Berkeley contest saw a deter
mined Cal whitewash a cold Tribe
n a wide-open tussle.
The Bears hit on 54 per cent of
their floor shots and 57 per cent
of their field shots to conquer the
visitors. Stanford connected on
but 31 per cent from the court, al
though they did go 74 per cent
from the free throw line.
Cal's Half
Cal jumped off to the lead
again and although the Indians
came to within one point at 6-5
and again at 8-7, it was Cal's half
all the way as the Bears rolled to
a 31-23 halftime advantage.
Behind scoring leader Al Buch
(15) and guard Denny Fitzpatrick
(14) the Pete Newell squad wid
ened the gap by leaps and bounds,
and played the last 10 minutes 11
points or better ahead of Stan
ford.
Arrillaga led the Indian scorers
with VI counters while Haga and
Neumann each dumped in 12.
The locals looked anything but
sharp in their defensive play, but
came up with a 35-35 draw in the
rebound department:.
