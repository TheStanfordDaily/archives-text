### Associated Press 
When it comes to inspirational
basketball, UCLA's Walt Tor
rence is hard to top.
His r e bo un d in g and clutch
shooting has the Bruins in first
place in the Pacific Cbast Confer
ence standings. He bombarded
the basket for 25 points Friday
night in UCLA's 57-33 win over
the Trojans and had 20 against
them Saturday night.

With less than a minute left in
he game, Torrence executed a
>ush shot from 20 feet that tied
the score at 63, then stole a pass
from Jim White and took the ball
he length of the floor for a lay-in
that won the game, 65-63. A
crowd of 7200 watched.
First Place
UCLA now has a 5-2 standing
and is a half game in front of
last year's champions, the Univer
sity of California. The Bears
were shaded by Stanford Friday
night at Stanford but turned the
tables Saturday night, 67-46, at
Berkeley.
Stanford's loss pushed the In
dians into third place, whereas
they had gone into a first-place tie
the night before with UCLA.
Washington, beginning to find
the range after a bad beginning,
worked up to a 3-3 mark in the
standings by whipping Oregon
State Saturday night, 69-59. Doug
Smart was on his game and col
lected 31 points, high for the
night, before a crowd of 8149 at
Corvallis.
Washington was outscored in
field goals, 26-25, but the Beavers
committed 21 fouls and Washing
ton gained 19 points at the free
throw line.
Idaho ran its record to 3-3 by
whipping Washington State Sat
urday night, after trimming the
Cougars the night before, 49-42.
Idaho trailed by 13 points at one
stage in the second half, but came
with a rush in the closing min
utes. B. J. Schaffer and John
Liveious collected 19 points each
for Idaho.
