NEW ORLEANS, La. (A') — A
hard-bargaining Democratic par
ty committ.ce chose Los Angeles
Sunday as the site for the party's
1060 national convention.
Three other cities -San Fran
cisco, Philadelphia and Miami
Beach—were in the final running
for the big convention. But the
committee declined to give any
information on how the final vot
ing or competition within the
committee went in a move to pre
vent controversy.
Chicago and New York also
sought the convention.
Camille Gravel Jr., of Louisi
ana, chairman of the group, said
Los Angeles was chosen on the
basis of numerous factors.
A main consideration for Los
Angeles apparently w;is that
city's new sports arena, to be
completed in May, with 17,000
seats and surrounding facilities.
