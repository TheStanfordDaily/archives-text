# Return War? No Problem, Says Castro

HAVANA, Cuba (/P) — Rebel
chieftain Fidel Castro has derided
reports that supporters of the
ousted dictator Fulgencio Batista
would try to invade Cuba from
Batista's refuge in the Dominican
Republic.
Castro spoke Sunday as Cuba's
revolutionary tribunals prepared
to start war crimes trials Monday
of Batista henchmen at La Ca
bana fortress.
Lend Batista Ships
Castro asserted any attempt to
invade Cuba would be crushed.
He added that he would be glad
to lend Batista the ships to bring
to Cuba his force of 10,000 men—
the number mentioned in the re
ports.
Castro came back to Havana
from a tour of Cuba's six prov
inces.
While in Pinar del Rio he was
treated at a hospital briefly for a
cold and fever.
In a postmidnight speech there
he told cheering crowds, "The
generals are finished in Cuba."
"Miserable"
He used the word miserable to
describe U.S. press criticism of
executions and reiterated the fir
ing squad justice would continue.
Thus far 207 former officers,
soldiers, police and informers
have been reported executed after
being convicted by revolutionary
tribunals in Oriente, Camaguey,
Las Villas and Matanzas prov
inces.
It is estimated 650 prisoners are
lodged in La Cabana fortress,
overlooking the entrance to Ha
vana Harbor. They include Maj.
Gen. Eulogio Cantilo, who headed
a short-lived military junta which
took over after Batista led to the
Dominican Republic on New
Year's Day.
Castro has publicly accused
Cantilo of treason in permitting
the flight of Batista and a close
group of his associates.
No announcement was made of
the exact hour for the trials,
which defendants will be called
up first, or the makeup of the tri
bunals. In other provinces the
tribunals have consisted of from
three to five officers, with a pros
ecutor and defender for the ac
cused.
