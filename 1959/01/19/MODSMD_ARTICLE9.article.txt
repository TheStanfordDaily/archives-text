# Moving Arrau Concert Begins Winter Program
##

By Herb Harivick
A recital by Chilean pianisl
Claudio Arrau opened the winter
phase of the Stanford Concert Se
ries Friday night, following an
almost two-month interval.
The evening began with the Mo
zart Sonata K. 576 (the "Trum
pet"). Playing with a heavy, ro
mantic touch. Arrau did not quite
seem to catch the spirit, of this
light and lithe work. But this
same romantic technique was
splendidly successful with the
"Drei Klavierstucke" of Schoem
berg.
These pieces, which mark Ihe
transition in his work from con
ventional romanticism to the 12-
tonal system, were played with an
emphasis on their expressionist
tendencies. Arrau effectively
pointed up Ihe emotional con
trasts within them.
( Minor Sonata
Nexl on the program was the
C Minor Sonata of Beelhoven. The
composer's last work for 1 the pi
ano, it is one of his deepest.
Arrau's interpretation did more
than simply show off his techni
cal control and power; he re-cre
ated the work in its deepest emo
tional implications, and he show
ed the final pianistic resolution of
a man who "had found his peace

with himself and his God."
The program closed with the
complete Preludes of Chopin,
which some consider the personal
property of Arrau. By playing
them as a unit and stressing their
continuity, they emerged as a
"whole" of enormous impact, in
stead of the usual 24 dainty, pe
tite encores.
Score as Guide
Arrau acleri hs something more
than a mere player; he took Ihe
score as his guide and then de
termined his own rhythm and dy
namics. The result showed his ap
proach to be valid and appro
priate.
