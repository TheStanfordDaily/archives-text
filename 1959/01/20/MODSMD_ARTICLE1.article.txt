about the Stanford Research Institute.)

Stanford is its first name; Research is its second. From humble
beginnings, the Stanford Research Institute, intimately affiliated
with Stanford University yet intentionally independent and sepa
rate, has grown to become the second largest non profit research
organization in the United States in the period since 1946.
The amazing success story of this branch of the Stanford Uni
versity "family tree" may serve only as an introduction to SRI,
as it has come to be better known.
SRI and SU are directly related through the Board of Trustees
of the University, at whose direction the Institute was formed in
1946.
"The need for an institution of this sort was anticipated in Mrs.
Stanford's will," stated E. Finley Carter, SRl's director since 1956.
The will called for "applied research . . . carrying basic [academic]
studies to the point of application," he continued.
Carter's post as director corresponds to Dr. J. E. Wallace Ster
ling's position as president of the University. The 23 members of
Stanford's Board of Trustees, who function as "stockholders" of
the University and appoint its president, are the Corporate Mem
bers of the Stanford Research Institute.
This, in fact, means that the Board of Trustees elects the mem
bers of SRl's Board of Directors who appoint the director, and that,
in the event of the dissolution of SRI, all assets would revert to the
Board ol Trustees, hence to the University.
Besides this administrative arrangement, SRI and Stanford have
many other relationships. For instance, at present 42 members of
Stanford's Academic Council have consulting agreements with SRI,
and 15 of SRl's professional staff are "lecturers," etc., at the Uni
versity.

In addition to sharing common radio propagation and computer
facilities, the University made an initial $500,000 investment in SRI.
The original thinking about SRI was to have it on campus, cor
responding in size and scope to one of the schools of the University.
This plan was devised to permit a greater degree of staff inter
change.
In December, 1946, William Talbott was hired as the first di
rector and first employee of the newly formed Stanford Research
Institute, with its office in the Physics Corner.
"In the next five months, half a dozen people were added to
the staff, and we started occupation of the Village on May 31, 1917,"
commented Carsten Steffens, research co-ordinator of SRI.
Among the early employees were such present-day SRI staff
members as Associate Director Weldon B. Gibson, Research Co
ordinator Carsten Steffens and Senior Plant Physiologist Harris N.
Benedict who participated in the first SRI project to try to make
synthetic rubber from the guayule shrub native to California.
The Menlo Park Army Hospital, originally intended for caring
for injured service men from the expected landings on the mainland
of Japan, had a laboratory wing into which the SRI chemists moved.
"The next five years brought an evolution of thinking about
relocating SRI on campus," continued Steffens. "This was brought
about by rapid growth of up to 30 per cent per year, the desirability
of keeping the operations administratively distinct however much
we may co-operate, keeping financing distinct so as to be no drain
on the University, and by the nature of the different type staffs."
SRI presently owns about 47 acres in the Village area, "ample
for our needs," Steffens concluded. In addition, as the University
completes on-eampus married students' housing, SRI will continue
to buy up Village land.
The SRI seed was planted. It was nourished by the University,
and thrived upon the needs of industry and government for applied
research. Its roots have today spread around the world, to some
35 countries on every continent of the world in the last year.

versity.

In addition to sharing common radio propagation and computer
facilities, the University made an initial $500,000 investment in SRI.
The original thinking about SRI was to have it on campus, cor
responding in size and scope to one of the schools of the University.
This plan was devised to permit a greater degree of staff inter
change.
In December, 1946, William Talbott was hired as the first di
rector and first employee of the newly formed Stanford Research
Institute, with its office in the Physics Corner.
"In the next five months, half a dozen people were added to
the staff, and we started occupation of the Village on May 31, 1917,"
commented Carsten Steffens, research co-ordinator of SRI.
Among the early employees were such present-day SRI staff
members as Associate Director Weldon B. Gibson, Research Co
ordinator Carsten Steffens and Senior Plant Physiologist Harris N.
Benedict who participated in the first SRI project to try to make
synthetic rubber from the guayule shrub native to California.
The Menlo Park Army Hospital, originally intended for caring
for injured service men from the expected landings on the mainland
of Japan, had a laboratory wing into which the SRI chemists moved.
"The next five years brought an evolution of thinking about
relocating SRI on campus," continued Steffens. "This was brought
about by rapid growth of up to 30 per cent per year, the desirability
of keeping the operations administratively distinct however much
we may co-operate, keeping financing distinct so as to be no drain
on the University, and by the nature of the different type staffs."
SRI presently owns about 47 acres in the Village area, "ample
for our needs," Steffens concluded. In addition, as the University
completes on-eampus married students' housing, SRI will continue
to buy up Village land.
The SRI seed was planted. It was nourished by the University,
and thrived upon the needs of industry and government for applied
research. Its roots have today spread around the world, to some
35 countries on every continent of the world in the last year.

Stanford is its first name; Research is its second. From humble
beginnings, the Stanford Research Institute, intimately affiliated
with Stanford University yet intentionally independent and sepa
rate, has grown to become the second largest non profit research
organization in the United States in the period since 1946.
The amazing success story of this branch of the Stanford Uni
versity "family tree" may serve only as an introduction to SRI,
as it has come to be better known.
SRI and SU are directly related through the Board of Trustees
of the University, at whose direction the Institute was formed in
1946.
"The need for an institution of this sort was anticipated in Mrs.
Stanford's will," stated E. Finley Carter, SRl's director since 1956.
The will called for "applied research . . . carrying basic [academic]
studies to the point of application," he continued.
Carter's post as director corresponds to Dr. J. E. Wallace Ster
ling's position as president of the University. The 23 members of
Stanford's Board of Trustees, who function as "stockholders" of
the University and appoint its president, are the Corporate Mem
bers of the Stanford Research Institute.
This, in fact, means that the Board of Trustees elects the mem
bers of SRl's Board of Directors who appoint the director, and that,
in the event of the dissolution of SRI, all assets would revert to the
Board ol Trustees, hence to the University.
Besides this administrative arrangement, SRI and Stanford have
many other relationships. For instance, at present 42 members of
Stanford's Academic Council have consulting agreements with SRI,
and 15 of SRl's professional staff are "lecturers," etc., at the Uni
versity.
