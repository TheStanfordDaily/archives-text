# Ike's New Budget: $77 Billion; Raise in Gasoline Tax Hinted
## President Needs Expanded Economy to Keep Balance 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —President Eisenhower handed Congress Mon
day a balanced budget of $77 billion. It would keep the government
living barely within its income.
This is the largest peacetime budget ever submitted. But it is
nearly four billions below the recession-increased spending in this

fiscal year, which ends next June
30.
The hoped-for surplus of $70
million to be left over at the end
of the year compares with a defi
cit of $12,871,000,000 Eisenhower
estimated for this fiscal year.
The proposed spending figures
out at $431 per American, as com
pared with $160 in the present
year.
Defense
Eisenhower said three dollars
of every five in the budget — a
total of $45,805,000,000 out of $77,-
030,000,000 must go to keeping
Ihe U.S. military structure ready
to meet any threat with weapons
operating from the bottom of the
sea and through the fringes of
space.
The budget's revenue estimate
of $77,100,000,000 is on the as
sumption that the value of the na
tion's output of goods and serv
ices will rise from $437 billion in
the 1958 calendar year to more
than $470 billion in 1959. Per
sonal incomes are expected to
climb $2014 billion to $374 billion,
and corporate profits are pro
jected at $47 billion, a gain of
$10\is hi 1 lion.
Missiles
Of each dollar, 59 cents
would go to national security a
total of $45% billion. Defense
spending would increase most
heavily in the field of missiles,
etc.
Foreign aid spending would be
cut by $383 million to $3V-± billion,
with more emphasis on economic
aid, less on military.
Eisenhower proposed $1,300,-
000,000 of new and higher taxes,
postal charges, etc., but no gen
eral tax increase. The federal
gasoline tax would go to 4'L
cents a gallon, from 3 cents.
If President Eisenhower's 1960
budget stays in balance, it will
give him three surpluses and four
deficits in the seven budgets he
has submitted.
