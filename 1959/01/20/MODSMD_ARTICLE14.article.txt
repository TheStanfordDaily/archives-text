GENEVA f/P) â€” The United
States and Britain offered the So
viet Union Monday a major con
cession on suspension of nuclear
weapons tests. Thoy hope to get
the Russians to agree to an ade
quate control system in return.
For the first time in 13 years
of postwar negotiations, the two
Western powers agreed to isolate
the problem of halting nuclear
weapons tests from the broader
issue of general disarmament.
They dropped their demand
that the life of the test suspen
sion treaty being negotiated here
be linked with progress in cut
ting back both conventional and
nuclear weapons.
They told the Russians a treaty
on suspension of tests could con
tinue in force indefinitely if the
Soviet government would agree
to the setting up of a fully work
able international control system.
That system, the Western pow
ers said, must be phased to come
into effect on a fixed schedule.
