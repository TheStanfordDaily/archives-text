## Housing Review 
### 
Alexander Pope said, "To err is human." A cynic added, "To
always forgive yourself is rationalization."
Many of ihe arguments offered l>y undergraduate women to
justify |>ast housing plans which provided for residence changing
every quarter, or at least every year, have exaggerated to the point
of absurdity the "need for a change ol view.
Most of us at Stanford have not fell the. necessity lit
change universities every year; to argue that we NEKI)
to change resiliences annually per sc is rationalization.
It is recognized that some women's residences are considered
more "desirable" than others, either in facilities, appearance, lo
cation or atmosphere. There is no single residence which combines
all these qualities, nor is there any totally "undesirable ' unit.
Under the present and previous housing plans lor women, there
have been contented and discontented elements in every house,
even though the plans have been devised to please every individual.
Trying to please everyone is a noble, futile ideal, and
it is lime for Stanford women to realize that, no matter
where lliey live on campus, their house will he as pleasant
for l hem as I hey <tre willing to make it.
"Your life is what you make il" . . . "You get out of anything
proportionately what you put into it ' . . . "Anything worth having
is worth working for" are all subject to the criticisms of being
trite and overused, but their truth is difficult to deny. I here are
exceptions, of course, but generally those activities to which we
give a lot of time and effort "pay off." Isn't it about time we
applied the same philosophy to living groups?
Last fall President. Wallace Sterling appointed an advisory
Faculty Committee on Residence Policy. Concerned with the
over-all campus housing policy as it affects scholarship, this com
mittee last week asked the AW S Housing Committee to appeal to
undergraduate women students to submit recommendations and
suggestions for a new women's housing policy and plan. 1 hese
suggestions are to be submitted to the AVi S Student-Faculty Hous
ing Committee by Feb. 6. The AWS committee will evaluate the
students' suggestions, and those which are considered to be desir
able and workable will be presented to the faculty committee
by Feb. 11.
Women are being given the opportunity not. as before,
to vote "yes" or "no" to another housing plan. but rather
the power to participate in the FORMATION of their
own housing policy.
The Administration is waiting on the recommendations from
the faculty committee, which in turn has determined not to act
before the women themselves have had the opportunity to submit
an acceptable proposal.
The faculty committee purposes to coordinate functions which
were not related before, and is composed of representatives from
the offices of the Dean of Students, Planning, and Business, and
from the faculty. Its members have approved the principle of
integrated housing above the freshman level, subject to the de
vising of practical administrative procedures.
The committee has also approved the principle of giving more
continuity to each living group on a year-to-year basis. There have
been many disadvantages to the yearly "mass migrations," they
feel; there must be a complete new slate of officers in Lagunita
each year, and, with the small number of women who have lived
there before and who "know the ropes," so to speak, there is prac
tically no carry-over of experience. This is one example of the
disadvantages of mass migrations. Another is illustrated by the
reluctance of girls to approve expenditures for television sets or
ping-pong tables for their residences when they do not expect to
be living in that residence Ihe next year.
Consider the advantages of living among one group of friends
for three years, combining your talents, experiences and capa
bilities to make "your house" more like a home away from home
than a "room" for a year.
Residences can make significant contributions to your
college experiences if you are willing to make the most
of their potential.
Stanford undergraduate women will have a new housing plan
next fallâ€”it can be their own, if they take the responsibility of
formulating and "living" it.
