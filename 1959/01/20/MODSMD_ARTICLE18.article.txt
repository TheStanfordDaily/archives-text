Editor, The Daily:
In an article appearing in last
Friday's Daily, Jack Winkler ex
presses his opinion on the future
of Stanford University with re
spect to enrollment policy. By in
ference, he links his opinions
closely to those of President Ster
ling.
The unfortunate point is that
the general tone of the article
suggests that the ideal is that
Stanford should ascend the steps
of intellectual superiority while
the other institutions of higher
learning in this nation fall into
decay. (". . . Stanford of the fu
ture will remain a true university
. . . when other schools have be
come refugee camps, huge pens
for sluggards trying to escape re

sponsibility.") I support the hy
pothesis that Stanford should rise
in stature and that it should at
tract only the best, but I cannot
support the tenor of the article
which suggests we watch our fel
low institutions sink down as we
rise. I cannot support your blan
ket condemnation of junior col
leges. They provide a form of ed
ucation. It is not the same form
as that of Stanford University
but please understand that it is
not evil or wrong simply because
it is different from ours.
We cannot afford a blanket con
demnation of all institutions of
higher learning outside of Stan
ford. This nation could not sur
vive if it had no source of leader
ship other than Stanford Univer
sity. . . .
