### Cally Tanner 
Concerning the Cuban situation, the commehts of Len Leonard, a
freshman student at Stanford who lived in Cuba from 1953 to 1955,
and during the summers since that time, east an interesting light on
Castro's rise to power and the possible effects his regime may have
as far as the Cuban people are concerned.

"In the first place," said Leon
ard, "I don't think the Cubans
care who runs their government.
This is partly because they aren't
taxed and don't have to pay for it.
Also, once the government gets
the money it doesn't use it for the
good of the people, and as long as
this is the case, I don't see why
the people should care."
Castro's Ability
When asked whether Castro's
government might change this,
Leonard noted the great difficul
ties in bringing about real and
basic changes. He was doubtful
as to Castro's ability to do this.
"1 don't think Castro will inten
tionally set up a dictatorship, but
1 think this will be the most prob
able outcome. Cuba has always
been that way; it's their way of
thinking, and the people goner
ally assume graft and spoils in
their government, no matter who
is in power.
Rural Support
According to Leonard, Castro's
support is almost entirely from
the rural population, and he was
quite unknown to the people in
Havana until his actual campaign
against Batista.
For this reason, his postpone
ment of the elections is "probably
a very shrewd move on Castro's
part," said Leonard. "This may
give him time to win the urban
population over to his side,"
which to some extent would as
sure his position in the election.
