# Open Letter Reports Experiment In Germany Very Successful
## 
### 
While the first contingent of
students to Stanford-in-Germany
dreams of life on The Burg, the
second group has plunged active
ly into the experiment in educa
tion.
The groundwork was well laid
by the first-term travelers, accord
ing to reports from those pres
ently on The Burg. The following
are excerpts from a letter by
Steve Tirrell to his family, who
forwarded his impressions to The
Daily:
. . The temperature has been
30 during the day, about 30 at
night—which is very warm for
here. Last year they had 20 inches
of snow, but none yet this year.
Mattress Sajfs
"Our beds consist of a mattress
(hat sags and a feather blanket
smaller than our kind of blanket.
In addition to not covering one,
it has the tendency for all the
feathers to go to one spot. The
pillow is about as large as the
kitchen table. We get one very
rough towel and apparently have
it for more than one day.
"I walked down to Beutelsbach
twice today. This morning we
met some men leaving church.
They took us in and -showed us
around. One of them played some
music on the pipe organ, dating
from the Baroque era. Then we
sang with them in German.
Unexpected Visit
"In the afternoon I went down
with another group nearly entire
ly composed of girls. ... I wan
dered off by myself.
"At the railroad station a man
said something or other plus
'Stanford.' We started talking. He
spoke some English. He asked
me if I would come and visit him.
So I walked across town with
him and his wife.
"He got out a violin, the daugh
ter, 12, a flute, and they played
'Silent Night' while everyone
sang. They served wine and cook
ies. A relative drove me up the
hill before dinner. They have ask
ed me to visit them again, which
I shall do.
"Griiss Gott"
"In Beutelsbach, clothing and
bicycles seem to be about the
same prices as in the U.S. They
dress very similarly. Beutelsbach
has 3000 people but not very many
cars. Everyone walks around the
village greeting everyone else
with 'Griiss Gott.'
"Everything is very neat, no
junk lying around. The roads are
much better marked than in the
U.S., street signs and direction
posts everywhere. The kids
around here are awfully cute; the
people seem better-looking on the
average than in the U.S.
Friendly Germans
"Germany is an amazing place.
Everyone has been very friendly
to us—unbelievably friendly.

'Tonight we had the church
choir from Beutelsbach with us.
They sang us a song to start
things and are of unbelievable
quality for such a small place.
Then we sang with the choir some
German songs. . . .
"The final several hours were
spent with everyone speaking to
one another. Many of our group
at this time received invitations
to visit people in Beutelsbach.
Stuttgart Tour
"While these events were going
on, the first snow of the year fell.
Only an inch so far, but everyone,
at least of our group, was glad
to see it come.
"Yesterday we were taken on a
tour of Stuttgart. Stuttgart is a
bustling city of 620,000. One first
notices the moving mas* of pe
destrians dodging streetcars and
autos, with very dignified white
coated policemen directing traffic
at the busier intersections. One
learns quickly here that it is the
pedestrians' duty to get out of
the way of all vehicles. Many of
us were very nearly run flown
finding this out.
C ity's Highest Hill
"On our tour, the next thing we
noticed were the bombed out re
mains of buildings which haven't
yet been restored. Sixty-five per
cent of West Stuttgart was de
stroyed, though only 1 per cent of
the population lost their lives;
most were evacuated.
"Except for about three or four
of the main buildings, the down
town section of Stuttgart was de
stroyed. In the outskirts, every
here and there, one finds the re
mains of the war's destruction.
The rubble has been removed;
only the battered walls remain.
"All the rubble from the city
was piled in one place. We were
told that this forms the tallest
hill in the city. Our guide spoke
rather sadly of the historical
buildings which were destroyed,
and of the attempts to restore.
Cocktail Party
"We were next taken up to the
famous television tower, over 600
feet high, having a restaurant at
the top. Unfortunately, it was a
bad day; the wind was the strong
est T have ever felt.
"Next we went to the U.S. con
sul general's for a 'cocktail party.'

The American building is new and
modern, as are many ot tire Ger
man buildings, but is in very
bad taste, standing out preten
tiously. . . .
"Afterwards, two companions
and I were looking for a place to
eat, found one a cafe -sat down
and took off our coats. About
then we noticed that a 'caf£' is a
place which serves sweets, cake,
pie, ice cream, etc*.
"We decided it was too late to
back out, so we ended up eating
some very fine cake and coffee
for 'dinner.' The cake was very
good, and they have good coffee
here — consistently better than
most American coffee. Inciden
tally, a 'restaurant' serves regular
food.
Expensive Goods
"This morning my roommate
and 1 went into Stuttgart to visit
the stores. Things here are amaz
ingly expensive about equal to
American prices on most things.
Clothes cost as much, some food
more. (Coffee is 18 cents a cup.)
Cameras are about one-half price,
bicycles the same, skis less. . . .
"I walked around Beutelsbach
for a while on New Year's Day,
trying to savor the sights and
sounds. It seems that that is also
what everyone else was doing
greeting his neighbors. The peo
ple seem so sincere, happy. They
appear untroubled with the arti
ficial sophistication often found
in American cities. They don't try
to 'keep up with the Joneses.' . . .
A Baptism
"This morning we went to
church. The snow on the ground,
approximately one and one-half
inches, made it difficult to ride,
so we walked part of the way.
First we heard the church bells,
which are unbelievably pretty.
"The service itself was plain,
with a sermon, some hymns and
a short prayer. There was, though,
the baptizing of two babies, the
families standing proudly around.
The babies were wrapped in fine
lace dresses and didn't stir until
the baptizing itself. The fact led
me to think at first that they
were dolls representing children.
"As we stood talking to the
townspeople afterwards, the snow
started coming down quite heav

ily. The wind blew, and it was
very cold. A family invited us in
out of the snow, while we waited
for the bus, and served us apples,
wine and cookies.
Response Greater
"One thing we have been told
is that the response to us has been
greater than it was at first for the
first group of Stanford students.
They had the job of making the
first penetration into this society,
and it took several months before
they were accepted as warmly as
we have been.
"So we have a head start on
ihe last group and owe them our
gratitude for doing such a fine
job of making friends lor Stan
ford's Landgut Burg.
Study Troubles
"It appears that one of the
troubles of this place will be try
ing to find enough time to study.
We have so many people here, are
receiving so many invitations and
have so many things to do that it
seems the task may be nearly im
possible. On Jan. 27 we leave for
a nine-day trip to Bonn. Part of
this, incidentally, will be counted
as class time. This certainly is
quite an experience.
"I see here one of Stanford's
big problems in action. The fac
ulty eat by themselves at a small
table. However, I suppose we will
know them fairly well despite
this. Already we're throwing
snowballs at them. . . .
Town Reception
"This afternoon the Beutels
bachers held a 'town reception'
for us. First we visited the town's
churches. The oldest church dates
from the 1400's; one bell was cast
in 1373. They have records and
song books dating from the 1500's.
"Then we visited a wine cellar
constructed in 1670. We then
went to the wine sampling room
and sampled five different wines.
"Next 'die Deutscher' had a din
ner for u« at a 'Gasthaus.' As we
entered, the town band played for
us. . . . Music in this land is very
good. The Germans are very mu
sic conscious. We had a very fine
meal; then we sang and we
danced.,. . .
"I think that this program is,
so far, more successful than any
one imagined it would be. . .

pedestrians' duty to get out of
the way of all vehicles. Many of
us were very nearly run flown
finding this out.
C ity's Highest Hill
"On our tour, the next thing we
noticed were the bombed out re
mains of buildings which haven't
yet been restored. Sixty-five per
cent of West Stuttgart was de
stroyed, though only 1 per cent of
the population lost their lives;
most were evacuated.
"Except for about three or four
of the main buildings, the down
town section of Stuttgart was de
stroyed. In the outskirts, every
here and there, one finds the re
mains of the war's destruction.
The rubble has been removed;
only the battered walls remain.
"All the rubble from the city
was piled in one place. We were
told that this forms the tallest
hill in the city. Our guide spoke
rather sadly of the historical
buildings which were destroyed,
and of the attempts to restore.
Cocktail Party
"We were next taken up to the
famous television tower, over 600
feet high, having a restaurant at
the top. Unfortunately, it was a
bad day; the wind was the strong
est T have ever felt.
"Next we went to the U.S. con
sul general's for a 'cocktail party.'

The American building is new and
modern, as are many ot tire Ger
man buildings, but is in very
bad taste, standing out preten
tiously. . . .
"Afterwards, two companions
and I were looking for a place to
eat, found one a cafe -sat down
and took off our coats. About
then we noticed that a 'caf£' is a
place which serves sweets, cake,
pie, ice cream, etc*.
"We decided it was too late to
back out, so we ended up eating
some very fine cake and coffee
for 'dinner.' The cake was very
good, and they have good coffee
here — consistently better than
most American coffee. Inciden
tally, a 'restaurant' serves regular
food.
Expensive Goods
"This morning my roommate
and 1 went into Stuttgart to visit
the stores. Things here are amaz
ingly expensive about equal to
American prices on most things.
Clothes cost as much, some food
more. (Coffee is 18 cents a cup.)
Cameras are about one-half price,
bicycles the same, skis less. . . .
"I walked around Beutelsbach
for a while on New Year's Day,
trying to savor the sights and
sounds. It seems that that is also
what everyone else was doing
greeting his neighbors. The peo
ple seem so sincere, happy. They
appear untroubled with the arti
ficial sophistication often found
in American cities. They don't try
to 'keep up with the Joneses.' . . .
A Baptism
"This morning we went to
church. The snow on the ground,
approximately one and one-half
inches, made it difficult to ride,
so we walked part of the way.
First we heard the church bells,
which are unbelievably pretty.
"The service itself was plain,
with a sermon, some hymns and
a short prayer. There was, though,
the baptizing of two babies, the
families standing proudly around.
The babies were wrapped in fine
lace dresses and didn't stir until
the baptizing itself. The fact led
me to think at first that they
were dolls representing children.
"As we stood talking to the
townspeople afterwards, the snow
started coming down quite heav

ily. The wind blew, and it was
very cold. A family invited us in
out of the snow, while we waited
for the bus, and served us apples,
wine and cookies.
Response Greater
"One thing we have been told
is that the response to us has been
greater than it was at first for the
first group of Stanford students.
They had the job of making the
first penetration into this society,
and it took several months before
they were accepted as warmly as
we have been.
"So we have a head start on
ihe last group and owe them our
gratitude for doing such a fine
job of making friends lor Stan
ford's Landgut Burg.
Study Troubles
"It appears that one of the
troubles of this place will be try
ing to find enough time to study.
We have so many people here, are
receiving so many invitations and
have so many things to do that it
seems the task may be nearly im
possible. On Jan. 27 we leave for
a nine-day trip to Bonn. Part of
this, incidentally, will be counted
as class time. This certainly is
quite an experience.
"I see here one of Stanford's
big problems in action. The fac
ulty eat by themselves at a small
table. However, I suppose we will
know them fairly well despite
this. Already we're throwing
snowballs at them. . . .
Town Reception
"This afternoon the Beutels
bachers held a 'town reception'
for us. First we visited the town's
churches. The oldest church dates
from the 1400's; one bell was cast
in 1373. They have records and
song books dating from the 1500's.
"Then we visited a wine cellar
constructed in 1670. We then
went to the wine sampling room
and sampled five different wines.
"Next 'die Deutscher' had a din
ner for u« at a 'Gasthaus.' As we
entered, the town band played for
us. . . . Music in this land is very
good. The Germans are very mu
sic conscious. We had a very fine
meal; then we sang and we
danced.,. . .
"I think that this program is,
so far, more successful than any
one imagined it would be. . .
While the first contingent of
students to Stanford-in-Germany
dreams of life on The Burg, the
second group has plunged active
ly into the experiment in educa
tion.
The groundwork was well laid
by the first-term travelers, accord
ing to reports from those pres
ently on The Burg. The following
are excerpts from a letter by
Steve Tirrell to his family, who
forwarded his impressions to The
Daily:
. . The temperature has been
30 during the day, about 30 at
night—which is very warm for
here. Last year they had 20 inches
of snow, but none yet this year.
Mattress Sajfs
"Our beds consist of a mattress
(hat sags and a feather blanket
smaller than our kind of blanket.
In addition to not covering one,
it has the tendency for all the
feathers to go to one spot. The
pillow is about as large as the
kitchen table. We get one very
rough towel and apparently have
it for more than one day.
"I walked down to Beutelsbach
twice today. This morning we
met some men leaving church.
They took us in and -showed us
around. One of them played some
music on the pipe organ, dating
from the Baroque era. Then we
sang with them in German.
Unexpected Visit
"In the afternoon I went down
with another group nearly entire
ly composed of girls. ... I wan
dered off by myself.
"At the railroad station a man
said something or other plus
'Stanford.' We started talking. He
spoke some English. He asked
me if I would come and visit him.
So I walked across town with
him and his wife.
"He got out a violin, the daugh
ter, 12, a flute, and they played
'Silent Night' while everyone
sang. They served wine and cook
ies. A relative drove me up the
hill before dinner. They have ask
ed me to visit them again, which
I shall do.
"Griiss Gott"
"In Beutelsbach, clothing and
bicycles seem to be about the
same prices as in the U.S. They
dress very similarly. Beutelsbach
has 3000 people but not very many
cars. Everyone walks around the
village greeting everyone else
with 'Griiss Gott.'
"Everything is very neat, no
junk lying around. The roads are
much better marked than in the
U.S., street signs and direction
posts everywhere. The kids
around here are awfully cute; the
people seem better-looking on the
average than in the U.S.
Friendly Germans
"Germany is an amazing place.
Everyone has been very friendly
to us—unbelievably friendly.

'Tonight we had the church
choir from Beutelsbach with us.
They sang us a song to start
things and are of unbelievable
quality for such a small place.
Then we sang with the choir some
German songs. . . .
"The final several hours were
spent with everyone speaking to
one another. Many of our group
at this time received invitations
to visit people in Beutelsbach.
Stuttgart Tour
"While these events were going
on, the first snow of the year fell.
Only an inch so far, but everyone,
at least of our group, was glad
to see it come.
"Yesterday we were taken on a
tour of Stuttgart. Stuttgart is a
bustling city of 620,000. One first
notices the moving mas* of pe
destrians dodging streetcars and
autos, with very dignified white
coated policemen directing traffic
at the busier intersections. One
learns quickly here that it is the

for the bus, and served us apples,
wine and cookies.
Response Greater
"One thing we have been told
is that the response to us has been
greater than it was at first for the
first group of Stanford students.
They had the job of making the
first penetration into this society,
and it took several months before
they were accepted as warmly as
we have been.
"So we have a head start on
ihe last group and owe them our
gratitude for doing such a fine
job of making friends lor Stan
ford's Landgut Burg.
Study Troubles
"It appears that one of the
troubles of this place will be try
ing to find enough time to study.
We have so many people here, are
receiving so many invitations and
have so many things to do that it
seems the task may be nearly im
possible. On Jan. 27 we leave for
a nine-day trip to Bonn. Part of
this, incidentally, will be counted
as class time. This certainly is
quite an experience.
"I see here one of Stanford's
big problems in action. The fac
ulty eat by themselves at a small
table. However, I suppose we will
know them fairly well despite
this. Already we're throwing
snowballs at them. . . .
Town Reception
"This afternoon the Beutels
bachers held a 'town reception'
for us. First we visited the town's
churches. The oldest church dates
from the 1400's; one bell was cast
in 1373. They have records and
song books dating from the 1500's.
"Then we visited a wine cellar
constructed in 1670. We then
went to the wine sampling room
and sampled five different wines.
"Next 'die Deutscher' had a din
ner for u« at a 'Gasthaus.' As we
entered, the town band played for
us. . . . Music in this land is very
good. The Germans are very mu
sic conscious. We had a very fine
meal; then we sang and we
danced.,. . .
"I think that this program is,
so far, more successful than any
one imagined it would be. . .
While the first contingent of
students to Stanford-in-Germany
dreams of life on The Burg, the
second group has plunged active
ly into the experiment in educa
tion.
The groundwork was well laid
by the first-term travelers, accord
ing to reports from those pres
ently on The Burg. The following
are excerpts from a letter by
Steve Tirrell to his family, who
forwarded his impressions to The
Daily:
. . The temperature has been
30 during the day, about 30 at
night—which is very warm for
here. Last year they had 20 inches
of snow, but none yet this year.
Mattress Sajfs
"Our beds consist of a mattress
(hat sags and a feather blanket
smaller than our kind of blanket.
In addition to not covering one,
it has the tendency for all the
feathers to go to one spot. The
pillow is about as large as the
kitchen table. We get one very
rough towel and apparently have
it for more than one day.
"I walked down to Beutelsbach
twice today. This morning we
met some men leaving church.
They took us in and -showed us
around. One of them played some
music on the pipe organ, dating
from the Baroque era. Then we
sang with them in German.
Unexpected Visit
"In the afternoon I went down
with another group nearly entire
ly composed of girls. ... I wan
dered off by myself.
"At the railroad station a man
said something or other plus
'Stanford.' We started talking. He
spoke some English. He asked
me if I would come and visit him.
So I walked across town with
him and his wife.
"He got out a violin, the daugh
ter, 12, a flute, and they played
'Silent Night' while everyone
sang. They served wine and cook
ies. A relative drove me up the
hill before dinner. They have ask
ed me to visit them again, which
I shall do.
"Griiss Gott"
"In Beutelsbach, clothing and
bicycles seem to be about the
same prices as in the U.S. They
dress very similarly. Beutelsbach
has 3000 people but not very many
cars. Everyone walks around the
village greeting everyone else
with 'Griiss Gott.'
"Everything is very neat, no
junk lying around. The roads are
much better marked than in the
U.S., street signs and direction
posts everywhere. The kids
around here are awfully cute; the
people seem better-looking on the
average than in the U.S.
Friendly Germans
"Germany is an amazing place.
Everyone has been very friendly
to us—unbelievably friendly.

'Tonight we had the church
choir from Beutelsbach with us.
They sang us a song to start
things and are of unbelievable
quality for such a small place.
Then we sang with the choir some
German songs. . . .
"The final several hours were
spent with everyone speaking to
one another. Many of our group
at this time received invitations
to visit people in Beutelsbach.
Stuttgart Tour
"While these events were going
on, the first snow of the year fell.
Only an inch so far, but everyone,
at least of our group, was glad
to see it come.
"Yesterday we were taken on a
tour of Stuttgart. Stuttgart is a
bustling city of 620,000. One first
notices the moving mas* of pe
destrians dodging streetcars and
autos, with very dignified white
coated policemen directing traffic
at the busier intersections. One
learns quickly here that it is the
pedestrians' duty to get out of
the way of all vehicles. Many of
us were very nearly run flown
finding this out.
C ity's Highest Hill
"On our tour, the next thing we
noticed were the bombed out re
mains of buildings which haven't
yet been restored. Sixty-five per
cent of West Stuttgart was de
stroyed, though only 1 per cent of
the population lost their lives;
most were evacuated.
"Except for about three or four
of the main buildings, the down
town section of Stuttgart was de
stroyed. In the outskirts, every
here and there, one finds the re
mains of the war's destruction.
The rubble has been removed;
only the battered walls remain.
"All the rubble from the city
was piled in one place. We were
told that this forms the tallest
hill in the city. Our guide spoke
rather sadly of the historical
buildings which were destroyed,
and of the attempts to restore.
Cocktail Party
"We were next taken up to the
famous television tower, over 600
feet high, having a restaurant at
the top. Unfortunately, it was a
bad day; the wind was the strong
est T have ever felt.
"Next we went to the U.S. con
sul general's for a 'cocktail party.'

The American building is new and
modern, as are many ot tire Ger
man buildings, but is in very
bad taste, standing out preten
tiously. . . .
"Afterwards, two companions
and I were looking for a place to
eat, found one a cafe -sat down
and took off our coats. About
then we noticed that a 'caf£' is a
place which serves sweets, cake,
pie, ice cream, etc*.
"We decided it was too late to
back out, so we ended up eating
some very fine cake and coffee
for 'dinner.' The cake was very
good, and they have good coffee
here — consistently better than
most American coffee. Inciden
tally, a 'restaurant' serves regular
food.
Expensive Goods
"This morning my roommate
and 1 went into Stuttgart to visit
the stores. Things here are amaz
ingly expensive about equal to
American prices on most things.
Clothes cost as much, some food
more. (Coffee is 18 cents a cup.)
Cameras are about one-half price,
bicycles the same, skis less. . . .
"I walked around Beutelsbach
for a while on New Year's Day,
trying to savor the sights and
sounds. It seems that that is also
what everyone else was doing
greeting his neighbors. The peo
ple seem so sincere, happy. They
appear untroubled with the arti
ficial sophistication often found
in American cities. They don't try
to 'keep up with the Joneses.' . . .
A Baptism
"This morning we went to
church. The snow on the ground,
approximately one and one-half
inches, made it difficult to ride,
so we walked part of the way.
First we heard the church bells,
which are unbelievably pretty.
"The service itself was plain,
with a sermon, some hymns and
a short prayer. There was, though,
the baptizing of two babies, the
families standing proudly around.
The babies were wrapped in fine
lace dresses and didn't stir until
the baptizing itself. The fact led
me to think at first that they
were dolls representing children.
"As we stood talking to the
townspeople afterwards, the snow
started coming down quite heav

ily. The wind blew, and it was
very cold. A family invited us in
out of the snow, while we waited
for the bus, and served us apples,
wine and cookies.

"At the railroad station a man
said something or other plus
'Stanford.' We started talking. He
spoke some English. He asked
me if I would come and visit him.
So I walked across town with
him and his wife.
"He got out a violin, the daugh
ter, 12, a flute, and they played
'Silent Night' while everyone
sang. They served wine and cook
ies. A relative drove me up the
hill before dinner. They have ask
ed me to visit them again, which
I shall do.
"Griiss Gott"
"In Beutelsbach, clothing and
bicycles seem to be about the
same prices as in the U.S. They
dress very similarly. Beutelsbach
has 3000 people but not very many
cars. Everyone walks around the
village greeting everyone else
with 'Griiss Gott.'
"Everything is very neat, no
junk lying around. The roads are
much better marked than in the
U.S., street signs and direction
posts everywhere. The kids
around here are awfully cute; the
people seem better-looking on the
average than in the U.S.
Friendly Germans
"Germany is an amazing place.
Everyone has been very friendly
to us—unbelievably friendly.

'Tonight we had the church
choir from Beutelsbach with us.
They sang us a song to start
things and are of unbelievable
quality for such a small place.
Then we sang with the choir some
German songs. . . .
"The final several hours were
spent with everyone speaking to
one another. Many of our group
at this time received invitations
to visit people in Beutelsbach.
Stuttgart Tour
"While these events were going
on, the first snow of the year fell.
Only an inch so far, but everyone,
at least of our group, was glad
to see it come.
"Yesterday we were taken on a
tour of Stuttgart. Stuttgart is a
bustling city of 620,000. One first
notices the moving mas* of pe
destrians dodging streetcars and
autos, with very dignified white
coated policemen directing traffic
at the busier intersections. One
learns quickly here that it is the
pedestrians' duty to get out of
the way of all vehicles. Many of
us were very nearly run flown
finding this out.
C ity's Highest Hill
"On our tour, the next thing we
noticed were the bombed out re
mains of buildings which haven't
yet been restored. Sixty-five per
cent of West Stuttgart was de
stroyed, though only 1 per cent of
the population lost their lives;
most were evacuated.
"Except for about three or four
of the main buildings, the down
town section of Stuttgart was de
stroyed. In the outskirts, every
here and there, one finds the re
mains of the war's destruction.
The rubble has been removed;
only the battered walls remain.
"All the rubble from the city
was piled in one place. We were
told that this forms the tallest
hill in the city. Our guide spoke
rather sadly of the historical
buildings which were destroyed,
and of the attempts to restore.
Cocktail Party
"We were next taken up to the
famous television tower, over 600
feet high, having a restaurant at
the top. Unfortunately, it was a
bad day; the wind was the strong
est T have ever felt.
"Next we went to the U.S. con
sul general's for a 'cocktail party.'

The American building is new and
modern, as are many ot tire Ger
man buildings, but is in very
bad taste, standing out preten
tiously. . . .
"Afterwards, two companions
and I were looking for a place to
eat, found one a cafe -sat down
and took off our coats. About
then we noticed that a 'caf£' is a
place which serves sweets, cake,
pie, ice cream, etc*.
"We decided it was too late to
back out, so we ended up eating
some very fine cake and coffee
for 'dinner.' The cake was very
good, and they have good coffee
here — consistently better than
most American coffee. Inciden
tally, a 'restaurant' serves regular
food.
Expensive Goods
"This morning my roommate
and 1 went into Stuttgart to visit
the stores. Things here are amaz
ingly expensive about equal to
American prices on most things.
Clothes cost as much, some food
more. (Coffee is 18 cents a cup.)
Cameras are about one-half price,
bicycles the same, skis less. . . .
"I walked around Beutelsbach
for a while on New Year's Day,
trying to savor the sights and
sounds. It seems that that is also
what everyone else was doing
greeting his neighbors. The peo
ple seem so sincere, happy. They
appear untroubled with the arti
ficial sophistication often found
in American cities. They don't try
to 'keep up with the Joneses.' . . .
A Baptism
"This morning we went to
church. The snow on the ground,
approximately one and one-half
inches, made it difficult to ride,
so we walked part of the way.
First we heard the church bells,
which are unbelievably pretty.
"The service itself was plain,
with a sermon, some hymns and
a short prayer. There was, though,
the baptizing of two babies, the
families standing proudly around.
The babies were wrapped in fine
lace dresses and didn't stir until
the baptizing itself. The fact led
me to think at first that they
were dolls representing children.
"As we stood talking to the
townspeople afterwards, the snow
started coming down quite heav

ily. The wind blew, and it was
very cold. A family invited us in
out of the snow, while we waited
for the bus, and served us apples,
wine and cookies.
Response Greater
"One thing we have been told
is that the response to us has been
greater than it was at first for the
first group of Stanford students.
They had the job of making the
first penetration into this society,
and it took several months before
they were accepted as warmly as
we have been.
"So we have a head start on
ihe last group and owe them our
gratitude for doing such a fine
job of making friends lor Stan
ford's Landgut Burg.
Study Troubles
"It appears that one of the
troubles of this place will be try
ing to find enough time to study.
We have so many people here, are
receiving so many invitations and
have so many things to do that it
seems the task may be nearly im
possible. On Jan. 27 we leave for
a nine-day trip to Bonn. Part of
this, incidentally, will be counted
as class time. This certainly is
quite an experience.
"I see here one of Stanford's
big problems in action. The fac
ulty eat by themselves at a small
table. However, I suppose we will
know them fairly well despite
this. Already we're throwing
snowballs at them. . . .
Town Reception
"This afternoon the Beutels
bachers held a 'town reception'
for us. First we visited the town's
churches. The oldest church dates
from the 1400's; one bell was cast
in 1373. They have records and
song books dating from the 1500's.
"Then we visited a wine cellar
constructed in 1670. We then
went to the wine sampling room
and sampled five different wines.
"Next 'die Deutscher' had a din
ner for u« at a 'Gasthaus.' As we
entered, the town band played for
us. . . . Music in this land is very
good. The Germans are very mu
sic conscious. We had a very fine
meal; then we sang and we
danced.,. . .
"I think that this program is,
so far, more successful than any
one imagined it would be. . .
While the first contingent of
students to Stanford-in-Germany
dreams of life on The Burg, the
second group has plunged active
ly into the experiment in educa
tion.
The groundwork was well laid
by the first-term travelers, accord
ing to reports from those pres
ently on The Burg. The following
are excerpts from a letter by
Steve Tirrell to his family, who
forwarded his impressions to The
Daily:
. . The temperature has been
30 during the day, about 30 at
night—which is very warm for
here. Last year they had 20 inches
of snow, but none yet this year.
Mattress Sajfs
"Our beds consist of a mattress
(hat sags and a feather blanket
smaller than our kind of blanket.
In addition to not covering one,
it has the tendency for all the
feathers to go to one spot. The
pillow is about as large as the
kitchen table. We get one very
rough towel and apparently have
it for more than one day.
"I walked down to Beutelsbach
twice today. This morning we
met some men leaving church.
They took us in and -showed us
around. One of them played some
music on the pipe organ, dating
from the Baroque era. Then we
sang with them in German.
Unexpected Visit

with another group nearly entire

tiously. . . .
"Afterwards, two companions
and I were looking for a place to
eat, found one a cafe -sat down
and took off our coats. About
then we noticed that a 'caf£' is a
place which serves sweets, cake,
pie, ice cream, etc*.
"We decided it was too late to
back out, so we ended up eating
some very fine cake and coffee
for 'dinner.' The cake was very
good, and they have good coffee
here — consistently better than
most American coffee. Inciden
tally, a 'restaurant' serves regular
food.
Expensive Goods
"This morning my roommate
and 1 went into Stuttgart to visit
the stores. Things here are amaz
ingly expensive about equal to
American prices on most things.
Clothes cost as much, some food
more. (Coffee is 18 cents a cup.)
Cameras are about one-half price,
bicycles the same, skis less. . . .
"I walked around Beutelsbach
for a while on New Year's Day,
trying to savor the sights and
sounds. It seems that that is also
what everyone else was doing
greeting his neighbors. The peo
ple seem so sincere, happy. They
appear untroubled with the arti
ficial sophistication often found
in American cities. They don't try
to 'keep up with the Joneses.' . . .
A Baptism
"This morning we went to
church. The snow on the ground,
approximately one and one-half
inches, made it difficult to ride,
so we walked part of the way.
First we heard the church bells,
which are unbelievably pretty.
"The service itself was plain,
with a sermon, some hymns and
a short prayer. There was, though,
the baptizing of two babies, the
families standing proudly around.
The babies were wrapped in fine
lace dresses and didn't stir until
the baptizing itself. The fact led
me to think at first that they
were dolls representing children.
"As we stood talking to the
townspeople afterwards, the snow
started coming down quite heav

ily. The wind blew, and it was
very cold. A family invited us in
out of the snow, while we waited
for the bus, and served us apples,
wine and cookies.
Response Greater
"One thing we have been told
is that the response to us has been
greater than it was at first for the
first group of Stanford students.
They had the job of making the
first penetration into this society,
and it took several months before
they were accepted as warmly as
we have been.
"So we have a head start on
ihe last group and owe them our
gratitude for doing such a fine
job of making friends lor Stan
ford's Landgut Burg.
Study Troubles
"It appears that one of the
troubles of this place will be try
ing to find enough time to study.
We have so many people here, are
receiving so many invitations and
have so many things to do that it
seems the task may be nearly im
possible. On Jan. 27 we leave for
a nine-day trip to Bonn. Part of
this, incidentally, will be counted
as class time. This certainly is
quite an experience.
"I see here one of Stanford's
big problems in action. The fac
ulty eat by themselves at a small
table. However, I suppose we will
know them fairly well despite
this. Already we're throwing
snowballs at them. . . .
Town Reception
"This afternoon the Beutels
bachers held a 'town reception'
for us. First we visited the town's
churches. The oldest church dates
from the 1400's; one bell was cast
in 1373. They have records and
song books dating from the 1500's.
"Then we visited a wine cellar
constructed in 1670. We then
went to the wine sampling room
and sampled five different wines.
"Next 'die Deutscher' had a din
ner for u« at a 'Gasthaus.' As we
entered, the town band played for
us. . . . Music in this land is very
good. The Germans are very mu
sic conscious. We had a very fine
meal; then we sang and we
danced.,. . .
"I think that this program is,
so far, more successful than any
one imagined it would be. . .
While the first contingent of
students to Stanford-in-Germany
dreams of life on The Burg, the
second group has plunged active
ly into the experiment in educa
tion.
The groundwork was well laid
by the first-term travelers, accord
ing to reports from those pres
ently on The Burg. The following
are excerpts from a letter by
Steve Tirrell to his family, who
forwarded his impressions to The
Daily:
. . The temperature has been
30 during the day, about 30 at
night—which is very warm for
here. Last year they had 20 inches
of snow, but none yet this year.
Mattress Sajfs
"Our beds consist of a mattress
(hat sags and a feather blanket
smaller than our kind of blanket.
In addition to not covering one,
it has the tendency for all the
feathers to go to one spot. The
pillow is about as large as the
kitchen table. We get one very
rough towel and apparently have
it for more than one day.
"I walked down to Beutelsbach
twice today. This morning we
met some men leaving church.
They took us in and -showed us
around. One of them played some
music on the pipe organ, dating
from the Baroque era. Then we
sang with them in German.
Unexpected Visit
"In the afternoon I went down
with another group nearly entire
ly composed of girls. ... I wan
dered off by myself.
"At the railroad station a man
said something or other plus
'Stanford.' We started talking. He
spoke some English. He asked
me if I would come and visit him.
So I walked across town with
him and his wife.
"He got out a violin, the daugh
ter, 12, a flute, and they played
'Silent Night' while everyone
sang. They served wine and cook
ies. A relative drove me up the
hill before dinner. They have ask
ed me to visit them again, which
I shall do.
"Griiss Gott"
"In Beutelsbach, clothing and
bicycles seem to be about the
same prices as in the U.S. They
dress very similarly. Beutelsbach
has 3000 people but not very many
cars. Everyone walks around the
village greeting everyone else
with 'Griiss Gott.'
"Everything is very neat, no
junk lying around. The roads are
much better marked than in the
U.S., street signs and direction
posts everywhere. The kids
around here are awfully cute; the
people seem better-looking on the
average than in the U.S.
Friendly Germans
"Germany is an amazing place.
Everyone has been very friendly
to us—unbelievably friendly.

'Tonight we had the church
choir from Beutelsbach with us.
They sang us a song to start
things and are of unbelievable
quality for such a small place.
Then we sang with the choir some
German songs. . . .
"The final several hours were
spent with everyone speaking to
one another. Many of our group
at this time received invitations
to visit people in Beutelsbach.
Stuttgart Tour
"While these events were going
on, the first snow of the year fell.
Only an inch so far, but everyone,
at least of our group, was glad
to see it come.
"Yesterday we were taken on a
tour of Stuttgart. Stuttgart is a
bustling city of 620,000. One first
notices the moving mas* of pe
destrians dodging streetcars and
autos, with very dignified white
coated policemen directing traffic
at the busier intersections. One
learns quickly here that it is the
pedestrians' duty to get out of
the way of all vehicles. Many of
us were very nearly run flown
finding this out.
C ity's Highest Hill
"On our tour, the next thing we
noticed were the bombed out re
mains of buildings which haven't
yet been restored. Sixty-five per
cent of West Stuttgart was de
stroyed, though only 1 per cent of
the population lost their lives;
most were evacuated.
"Except for about three or four
of the main buildings, the down
town section of Stuttgart was de
stroyed. In the outskirts, every
here and there, one finds the re
mains of the war's destruction.
The rubble has been removed;
only the battered walls remain.
"All the rubble from the city
was piled in one place. We were
told that this forms the tallest
hill in the city. Our guide spoke
rather sadly of the historical
buildings which were destroyed,
and of the attempts to restore.
Cocktail Party
"We were next taken up to the
famous television tower, over 600
feet high, having a restaurant at
the top. Unfortunately, it was a
bad day; the wind was the strong
est T have ever felt.
"Next we went to the U.S. con
sul general's for a 'cocktail party.'

The American building is new and
modern, as are many ot tire Ger
man buildings, but is in very
bad taste, standing out preten
tiously. . . .
"Afterwards, two companions

from the 1400's; one bell was cast
in 1373. They have records and
song books dating from the 1500's.
"Then we visited a wine cellar
constructed in 1670. We then
went to the wine sampling room
and sampled five different wines.
"Next 'die Deutscher' had a din
ner for u« at a 'Gasthaus.' As we
entered, the town band played for
us. . . . Music in this land is very
good. The Germans are very mu
sic conscious. We had a very fine
meal; then we sang and we
danced.,. . .
"I think that this program is,
so far, more successful than any
one imagined it would be. . .
