# REPUBLICANS
## Taft Cited As Model Politician 
### 
The Associated Collegiate Press
reports Mai Maier, editor of Cin
cinnati News Record, joining
journalists everywhere mulling
over elections.
"Whore is Republicanism head
ing? Ever since the election this
question has been discussed, re
discussed and orated upon in the
public press, from speakers' plat
forms and in backroom sessions.
No answer seems to be forthcom
ing. ... At this point we miss
the figure of Robert Taft. Taft
was a conservative, not because
he was interested in "special in
terest groups" but because he be
lieved he was right. . . .
Duty to Follow
"The Republican has a duty to
follow the example of Robert
Taft who was known as much for
his integrity as for his political
views. Extremes in any case are
bad. An extreme conservativism
is as destructive for political pur
poses as is the extreme liberal
ism with which the country now
seems to be faced.
Appeal to Reason
"An appeal to reason is neces
sary. The liberals are not the
saviors of the country. No more
are the conservatives. A reasoned
approach to any situation de
pends upon compromise for the
public good. The Republican
party has a job to do. With the
aid of reason it will be done.
Weeping in one's beer does noth
ing but dilute it."
