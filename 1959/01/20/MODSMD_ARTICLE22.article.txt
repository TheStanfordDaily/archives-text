Jess —That's Not Nice
Repercussions from NCAA sanctions imposed on the University
of Southern California are still drifting up from the Southland. And
from the sounds of some of them, the boys down there just aren't
too happy about the situation.
In some respects, we really can't blame them. Penalizing athletes
for a couple of relatively insignificant and stupid blunders pulled by
the front office doesn't make an awful lot of sense. As so many
others have said ever since athletes started getting penalized for
University actions, in cases like the one at USC, it would seem more
reasonable to throw out those responsible for the illegal shenanigans
and impose some sort of sanction which wouldn't hurt the athletes

directly. The ban against appear
ances on television sportscasts is
atr example of this sort of sanc
tion.
But to get back to the South
land comment, the most back
handed slap as far as Stanford is
concerned came from USC ath
letic director Jess Hill. An article
by liraven Dyer in the Jan. 9 Los
Angeles Times asked:
Did some northern school
"squeal" on the Trojans, as re
ported in other papers?
"I am sure that the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
was not behind I his investiga
tion," answered Hill.
Well—if there's such a thing as
insult by omission, that's it.
One ironic happening was the
headline in the Jan. 7 L.A. Mirror-
News. It trumpeted the news,
"NCAA TO LIFT BAN ON SC
TjUDAV." Things were different
come Thursday.
Wo heard one intriguing sug
gestion about what could be done

for the athletes who have been denied championship competition by
NCAA action against their universities. The idea came from the
lather of a Stanford athlete, and was a proposal that when an ath
lete's school is slapped with probation the athlete be allowed to trans
fer without the normal year's loss of eligibility.
At first thought it sounds like a good deal for the penalized ath
lete. After all—he went to the school in good faith and then gets
deprived of competition because somebody in the front office fouled
things up. With free transfer rights, the athlete could then go to
some place else where he would be free to compete.
Looking objectively, however, it's pretty obvious that such a plan
would be unworkable. First of all, it's too realistic. Opponents would
argue that why should the athlete want to change schools? After all,
he picked a school for its educational merits, and those haven't been
changed any by NCAA probation. And everybody knows that all
athletes go to school primarily for their education.
Existence of such a rule would extend recruitment battles from
the high school ranks on up to the college level. If school U saw an
athlete at school C wlio was going great guns as a sophomore, it
would naturally be interested in luring him on to its own campus.
And what better way to get him than dig up a few skeletons in C's
closet, present them to the NCAA, get C thrown on probation, and
invite the star sophomore to star taking his mid-terms at I) instead
of C.
Half the members of the NCAA would probably be on probation
before they knew it.
So, the idea probably wouldn't work—not because of the athletes,
but because of the red-hot alums and over-zealous and over paying
- recruiters.
Blueprint for 11-5
The pattern of the 1959 Pacific Coast Conference basketball race,
at least as far as Stanford is concerned, has boiled down to winning
at home and losing on the road.
With home victories already recorded over California and Wash
ington—supposedly the two toughest clubs ip the league—the pros
pects are bright for Howie Dallmar's troops to wind up with an un
blemished slate on the Pavilion floor.
So add five more home wins to the present four and that gives
nine. But happens on the road? From the looks of things in Los
Angeles, a couple of tough teams will be waiting when the Indians
invade over Washington's Birthday weekend. Probably a split will
be a pretty good accomplishment.
And two more games remain in the Northwest—Oregon and
Washington. Beating the Huskies at Seattle will be a Herculean
task—and the odds say it won't happen. But figure they'll be fresh
for the Jan. 30 game at Oregon, and call that one a Stanford victory.
Add 'em up and it comes out to an 11-5 record in conference action.
Funny thing about that 11-5: Cal coach Pete Newell said that any
leam with an 11-5 mark will have a share of the title. Hope Pete's
right.
