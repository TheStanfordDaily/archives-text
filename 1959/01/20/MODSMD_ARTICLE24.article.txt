# Dallmar Welcomes Rest; Cards Patch Up Injuries
## 
### 
Statiford Basketball Coach
Howie Dallmar was pleased with
the fact that after a rough week
end in which his team had to play
two games against California,
I hey now could take a two-week
breather.
The lanky hoop coach also was
pleased over the work that his
Indians did against the Bears in
their two game set. Dallmar was
convinced, as was Pete N'ewell of
California earlier in the season,
that an 11-5 record could take the
title.
With this in mind he went on
to mention that he felt his In
dians, Cal, UCLA and Washing
ton were all definitely still in the
race. Dallmar also felt that Wash
ington might prove extremely
tough when the Indians move
north to take the Huskies on in
two weeks. The fine performance
of the Washington team over this
last weekend when they dumped
both Oregon and Oregon State at
the Oregonians' home courts was
a good indication of their come
back strength.
Smart Hot
Husky star Doug Smart, who
had started slowly this year, hit
his stride over the weekend and
on Saturday night the 69 giant
tossed in 31 points.
The rest which will be upcom
ing for the Indians will be par
ticularly beneficial to John Hen
dry, John Arrillaga, Gerry Thue
sen and John Stahler. Arrillaga
and Hendry have had ankle troub
les of late and the rest will prob
ably insure their top form for the
continuation of the conference
schedule.
Stahler has been bothered by
a case of mononucleosis and
Thuesen just recovered from a
case of pneumonia. Both men
figure to have complete medical
OK's by the end of the month.
Scoring Aid
Dallmar is especially looking
forward to Thuesen's returning
to completely perfect health be
cause the Stanford coach is hop
ing that Thuesen, the vertical hy
phen at (5-7, can take up the slack
in the Stanford scoring attack.
The Cards need someone else in
the lineup who can score consist
ently and if Thuesen returns to
his form of late last year he will
solve the pr oblem.
Even though the Cards get a
rest from Conference action they

still will have to moot COP this
weekend at home. The Tigers,
who have had a fair season, boast
of two rather good players in
Dave Klurman and Leroy Wright.
Klurman, from Irvington, N.J., is
hitting an average of 24 points
per game while Wright is the
nation's rebound leader.
Coach Da 11 ma r once again
handed out a most deserved crop
of compliments to ace guard Paul
Neumann. Neumann's perform
ances against Cal were spectacu
lar and his Friday night work
was perhaps the greatest reason
why the Stanford team pushed by
the Bears.

race. Dallmar also felt that Wash
ington might prove extremely
tough when the Indians move
north to take the Huskies on in
two weeks. The fine performance
of the Washington team over this
last weekend when they dumped
both Oregon and Oregon State at
the Oregonians' home courts was
a good indication of their come
back strength.
Smart Hot
Husky star Doug Smart, who
had started slowly this year, hit
his stride over the weekend and
on Saturday night the 69 giant
tossed in 31 points.
The rest which will be upcom
ing for the Indians will be par
ticularly beneficial to John Hen
dry, John Arrillaga, Gerry Thue
sen and John Stahler. Arrillaga
and Hendry have had ankle troub
les of late and the rest will prob
ably insure their top form for the
continuation of the conference
schedule.
Stahler has been bothered by
a case of mononucleosis and
Thuesen just recovered from a
case of pneumonia. Both men
figure to have complete medical
OK's by the end of the month.
Scoring Aid
Dallmar is especially looking
forward to Thuesen's returning
to completely perfect health be
cause the Stanford coach is hop
ing that Thuesen, the vertical hy
phen at (5-7, can take up the slack
in the Stanford scoring attack.
The Cards need someone else in
the lineup who can score consist
ently and if Thuesen returns to
his form of late last year he will
solve the pr oblem.
Even though the Cards get a
rest from Conference action they

still will have to moot COP this
weekend at home. The Tigers,
who have had a fair season, boast
of two rather good players in
Dave Klurman and Leroy Wright.
Klurman, from Irvington, N.J., is
hitting an average of 24 points
per game while Wright is the
nation's rebound leader.
Coach Da 11 ma r once again
handed out a most deserved crop
of compliments to ace guard Paul
Neumann. Neumann's perform
ances against Cal were spectacu
lar and his Friday night work
was perhaps the greatest reason
why the Stanford team pushed by
the Bears.
Statiford Basketball Coach
Howie Dallmar was pleased with
the fact that after a rough week
end in which his team had to play
two games against California,
I hey now could take a two-week
breather.
The lanky hoop coach also was
pleased over the work that his
Indians did against the Bears in
their two game set. Dallmar was
convinced, as was Pete N'ewell of
California earlier in the season,
that an 11-5 record could take the
title.
With this in mind he went on
to mention that he felt his In
dians, Cal, UCLA and Washing
ton were all definitely still in the
race. Dallmar also felt that Wash
ington might prove extremely
