## Meet the Cards 
### 
Was a JC transfer last year
who wasn't quite ready to step
into varsity competition. Saw
most of his action with the
Braves. Made three brief var
sity appearances. Should see
more action this campaign. Has
overcome tremendous handi
caps, has plenty of desire and is
eager to learn. 6-8 Va, 200.

A senior, he has seen most of
his action with the Braves. He
has seen spotted varsity action,
though. A hard worker, he is
solid on defense. Is a pretty
good shooter. Has shown steady
improvement and is slated to
see more varsity action this sea
son. Crawford is a valuable
team man. 6-0, 175.
