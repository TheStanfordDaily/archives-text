# Stanford Sailors Garner Second
## 
### 
Stanford's sailing team, skip
pered by Dick 'Landes, Dick Ward
and George Walker, made a fine
comeback to gain second place in
last month's Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Racing Association
Championship.
The Stanford sailors who were
in sixth place midway through
the regatta made a strong come
back, and in the last of 14 races
came out on top to squeak out
second place over Orange Coast
Junior College.
