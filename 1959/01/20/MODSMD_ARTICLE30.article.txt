# Swim Team Seeks PCC Title Repeat
## 
### 
With the smell of another PCC
championship burning in their
nostrils, the Stanford swim team
continues working toward their
first meet with UCLA on Feb. 13.
In opposition to past seasons,
this year's PCC meets will be held
prior to the NCAA Champion
ships in late March. This change
places the Pacific Coast on a
schedule similar to that of the
rest of Ihe nation.
"This looks like it will be a real
successful season," said Stanford
Coach Tom Haynie while looking
over the names of last year's
freshman NCAA record - setting
medley relay team.

"He looks like one of the most
promising sophomore swimmers
ever to attend Stanford," Haynie
said of Mike Zeller, freestyler on
the medley relay team. Zeller has
an impressive past, making high
school Ail-American and setting
a North Coast section record in
the 100-yard freestyle.
Co-captains for the team this
year are seniors Robin Moore and
Wayne Mehl. Moore won the 50-,
100- and 220-yard freestyle in last
year's PCC championship meet
and Mehl took second in the 200-
yard backstroke and third in the
100-yard backstroke in the PCC
meet.

The only team expected to give
Stanford any competition in its
quest for the PCC crown is USC,
which boasts of the Australian
whiz kids, Murray Rose and Jon
Hendricks. "The meet coul<j go
either way," according to Coach
Haynie. Stanford is strong in
the breaststroke and freestyle
sprints while USC will probably
take the middle distance and
backstroke.
Adding strength to the team
are Tom Peterson, PCC 100- and
200-yard breaststroke record hold

both 100- and 200 - yard NCAA
frosh butterfly records; and John

The only team expected to give
Stanford any competition in its
quest for the PCC crown is USC,
which boasts of the Australian
whiz kids, Murray Rose and Jon
Hendricks. "The meet coul<j go
either way," according to Coach
Haynie. Stanford is strong in
the breaststroke and freestyle
sprints while USC will probably
take the middle distance and
backstroke.
Adding strength to the team
are Tom Peterson, PCC 100- and
200-yard breaststroke record hold
er; George Harrison, holder of
both 100- and 200 - yard NCAA
frosh butterfly records; and John

With the smell of another PCC
championship burning in their
nostrils, the Stanford swim team
continues working toward their
first meet with UCLA on Feb. 13.
In opposition to past seasons,
this year's PCC meets will be held
prior to the NCAA Champion
ships in late March. This change
places the Pacific Coast on a
schedule similar to that of the
rest of Ihe nation.
"This looks like it will be a real
successful season," said Stanford
Coach Tom Haynie while looking
over the names of last year's
freshman NCAA record - setting
medley relay team.

"He looks like one of the most
promising sophomore swimmers
ever to attend Stanford," Haynie
said of Mike Zeller, freestyler on
the medley relay team. Zeller has
an impressive past, making high
school Ail-American and setting
a North Coast section record in
the 100-yard freestyle.
