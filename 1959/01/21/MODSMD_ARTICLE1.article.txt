# SRI Success Depends On Team Effort

(Kditor's Note: This is the
second in a series ol' three arti
cles on the Stanford Research
Institute.)

With some 1500 employees and
$18 million in yearly business, the
Stanford Research Institute,
closely allied to the University, is
the second largest non-profit re
search institution in the country.
Stanford Research Institute
provides a scientific research and
fact-finding service to business,

industry, government and the
general public. Most of its re
search is carried out on a contract
basis.
The "desired ratio" of govern
ment to private contracts is about
half and half, according to SRl's
Research Co - ordinator Cargten
Steffens.
Spectrum
"We offer as broad a spectrum
of research as one might find in
any research organization in the
country," Director E. Finley Car
ter added.
"By utilizing the multi-discipli
nary team approach, we combine
the information of a group of spe
cialists, taking fragmented facts
and integrating them into a pack
age. which, when presented to the
decision-maker, will enable him
to make a better decision."
For simplicity, the organization
of SRI is divided into four divi
sions: Engineering Research,
Physical Sciences Research, Eco
nomic Research and Poulter Lab
oratories. In addition, there are
the usual service groups.
The Engineering Research Di
vision, since its creation in 1948,
has undertaken more than 500
projects in many fields, totaling
in excess of $30 million. Its aim
is to insure that the division can
lead, in fact help develop, new
branches of engineering to keep
abreast or in advance of new
trends and needs.
Engineering 1
The Engineering Division of
SRI deals in such broad fields as
electronics, mechanics, systems,
information handling, traffic con
trol, equipment and systems reli
ability, contact research, graphic
arts, weather research and exper
imental designs.
The Physical Sciences Research
Division is concerned with re
search in chemistry, physics, met
allurgy, earth sciences and bio
logical sciences. Perhaps best de
scribed in terms of the men who
compose it, Ihc Physical Sciences
Division has among its staff
members Dr. Donald Benedict, di
rector and applied physicist; Dr.
Richard Foose, an authority in
the field of geology; Dr. Frank
Mayo, senior research chemist;
and Dan McLachlan, Jr., funda
mental research scientist.
Economics
The Economics Research Divi
sion is concerned with the pos
sible application of scientific
methods to economic and social
problems. It is divided into five
subdivisions: Resource Develop
ment Research, Industrial Eco
nomics Research, Management
Sciences -Research. International
Programs, and Defense Research.
Since its establishment, the Eco
nomics Research Division has
completed over 1300 economics
research projects.
The Poulter Laboratories Divi
sion engages in research on ex
plosives, detonation, combustion
and high - pressure phenomena.
Named after and "huilt around"
Dr. Thomas C. Poulter, director
since its establishment in 1918.
the Poulter Labs are typical of
SRl's attitude of "trying to main
fain an environment in which re
search can thrive," as espoused
by SRI Director Carter.
Specialists
Specialists at Stanford Re
search Institute generally con
duct research in their own fields
as well as applying their skills to
diverse problems through the
"team" approach to problem-solv
ing.
This general plan has appar
ently yielded more than satisfac
tory results in light of SRl's
physical growth and the world
wide reputation it now possesses.
