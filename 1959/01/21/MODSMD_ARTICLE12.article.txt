# Bookstore Bids Open Thursday
## Building Begins Soon 
### Walt Wurfel 
Contractors' bids for the new
bookstore and post office build
ings will be opened Thursday af
ternoon, acccording to the Busi
ness Office. Construction of both
buildings by the same contractor
will begin as soon as possible af
ter the contract is awarded.
The bookstore, which is expect
ed to cost $430,000, wil go up on
Lasuen Street next door to the
present bookstore. The post of
fice, with an estimated price tag
of .$186,000, will be next door and
across the street from the old
post office. A covered walkway
will connect the two buildings.
Endowment Money
The University will pay con
struction costs with endowment
money. The building will be rent
ed to the Bookstore Corporation
and the Post Office Department.
Rents should repay the cost in
about. 25 to 30 years, in addition
to returning a profit on the in
vestment, reports Assistant to the
President Kenneth Cuthbertson.
Both new buildings are de
signed to provide badly needed
space for expansion.
The general book department,
of the bookstore will be greatly
enlarged, according to Prof. Ar
thur Krocger, president of the
Bookstore Board of Directors. A
complete line of paperback books
will be carried, he said.
Better Service
Krocger expects the new book
store to place more emphasis on
providing service and less on
making a profit. The bookstore
should be more a part of the edu
cational program of the Univer
sity, he added.
Though he does not expect final
completion of the bookstore until
the end of the year, Kroeger says,
"The hope is that . . . possibly
part of the store will be available
for the fall of 1959."
Enlarged Post Offices
The new post office will be
twice as large as present facili
ties. Three stamp windows and a.
combined general delivery-parcel
post window are planned.
Only transients will receive
mail through general delivery af
ter completion of the new build
ing, announced Superintendent
Jack J. Calahan. The number of
boxes will be more than doubled
to 4000 so there should be enough
for everyone, he said.
