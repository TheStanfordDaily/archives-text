# AWAKENING OF CREATIVITY YET TO COME
## 
### Dennis Wheeler 
For some people, man is not an
insipid bug who whirls aimlessly
through the multitudinous galax
ies. For some people, man is a
creature who finds himself at the
very center of all existence be
tween the infinities of the celes

tial universe and the infinities of
1 his own oceanic soul.
And we may say of these people
. of creative spirit, these sustainers
t of the dignity of man, that they
> not only VALUF their experiences
. as men; they THRIVE on them,
-j They like to communicate with

one another for the sake of their
mutual enrichment; they seek to
cultivate about themselves an at
mosphere of creativity; and, thus,
as one of their fondest tasks, they
seek to awaken the creative spirit
in others, especially young peo
ple, in order to assure the per
petuation of such an atmosphere.
Great Fortune
It is Stanford's great fortune
that a few of these creative spir
its have congregated here. Some
of these people have shown a
great interest in the cause of a
general awakening. But a general
awakening bus yet to come.
Some observers believe that
such an awakening is beyond the
realm of possibility, that we
should be satisfied with the en
thusiasm of our better students,
as at present.
But other- observers, more opti
mistic, believe that to ignore the
mass ol' the Stanford students is
to ignore a vast reserve of latent
spiritual energy; and that with
further efforts we should be able
to awaken this spirit, and develop
its intensity to the point where it
equals that of Harvard and the
English universities.
Takes Lead
The man who takes the lead in
proposing a plan for the realiza
tion of this awakening is Prof.
Wilfred H. Stone. In his recent
Sequoia article he prescribes a set
of ideal conditions which, he feels,
if effected at Stanford, won! d

force the students to fall bark
upon their own initiatives, and
discover their latent energies.
Included among his ideal condi
tions are, first, a nobler 1 environ
ment in which to live and study,
which, to a great extent, can be
accomplished by dormitory reno
vations; second, more time to
study and think on one's own,
which can be created by diminish
ing the mechanical aspects of
courses; and, third, more valua
ble instruction from professors,
and more intimate and worth
while associations among profes
sors and students.
Meaningful
In a word, Pr'of. Stone is advo
cating a personally meaningful
academic freedom in an ennobling
atmosphere; for this is the condi
tion, he believes, in which stu
dents will awaken lo themselves.
We need not question the ger

minating powers of personally
meaningful freedom, but we may
question whether or not Prof,
i Stone's ideal conditions could pro
| vide, by themselves, an academic
freedom which would prove to be
personally meaningful.
Prof. Stone seems to think that,
given the goals of a course, and
! the freedom to pursue these goals
under' the above-stated ideal con
ditions, a student would be forced
to take advantage of his freedom
for the sake of academic survival.
He might even join other stu
dents to for m academic seminars
and societies which resembled
those at thie English universities.
And, thus, he could be said to be
using his freedom meaningfully,
for some pur pose.
For Knrichment
And it MIGHT prove to be for'
the purpose of self - enrichment,
but it might turn out to lie for no

other purpose than that of aca
demic survival, and this latter un
fortunate possibility is one which
Prof. Stone fails to consider.
And lie also fails to consider an
even worse possibility the fact
that many students under the
new conditions might regard their
increased freedom as passively as
they regard whatever freedom
they now have.
Vain Hope?
The ideal attitude under the
new conditions would be to hope
that students who did not find
their freedom personally mean
ingful at the beginning might find
meaning in their freedom through
exposure to the ideal conditions;
but thi-s might prove to be an all
too vain hope.
Certainly, we are not encour
aged by Prof. SI one's summation
of ihe student response to his pro
posals: "It's a good idea, but 1
wouldn't like it. I'd have to work
too hard.".
The problem would be the same
in that ideal situation as it is in
our present situation the prob
lem of finding an effective yet
urvrestrictive means to instill di
rection into the students, in order
that their academic freedom may
have some personal meaning at
tached tf) it. The problem remains
the fundamental problem of awak
ening the spirit.
Bui this task is not beyond our
means.
Let us consider some helpful ad
ditions to the plan which Prof.
Stone has presented.
First of all, in order to diminish
the possibility of continued pas
sivity among any large number of
students, let us substitute the ab
solute standard for the bell-curve
in the grading system, in order to
encourage an attitude of pride in
one's work, and discourage an at
titudeof flippancy in trying mere
ly "to beat the curve."
Give Unity
Secondly, in order to give some
unity to the undergraduate edu
cation, in order to help piece to
gether the many and divergent
courses which each student has to
take, let us introduce a compul

sory course in philosophy whose
task would go beyond that of the
course in Western Civilization.
It would seel-;, in an epistemo
logical discussion, not only to re
late the fields of the humanities
as fields of knowledge, but to re
late every branch of knowledge
with every other and to depict
them in an interrelated whole.
And the course would seek also,
in an ethical discussion, to provide
insight into the value of knowl
edge in general, the intrinsic val
ues of the various particular
branches of knowledge and the
value of each branch as it is re
lated to the others.
Need challenge
Finally, let us challenge our
students, whether it be through
dramatic exhortation or through
confidential discussion, to go be
yond the goals of their particular
courses and to discover in their
over-ail undergraduate education
some purposes meaningful to
them individually not .just the
purposes of Moses, Christ, or Soc
rates, but purposes of their own
which will acl as incentives to
continue the enjoyment of edu
cation throughout their lives.
Let us inculcate our students
with an attitude of life-affirma
tion; let us enshrine the "eelebra
t ions of I he human soul."
And let us DARK our students
(a dare is what they really need! i
to use their experiences here to
discover and to develop in them
selves the latent noble powers
which make them men even men
of potential greatness.
Awakens Souls
For this is the idea which awak
ens the souls of men; the idea,
when implanted, w hi c h grows
from a gnawing suspicion into an
indestructible faith; that, no mat
ter how vast the experience of a
man, he always remains for him
self the receptacle of something
inoie profound and more glorious
a golden SOMETHING which
merely awaits within his discov
ery and cultivation.
But the idea must be implanted
first! And then we shall see an
I awakening. . . .
For some people, man is not an
insipid bug who whirls aimlessly
through the multitudinous galax
ies. For some people, man is a

tions are, first, a nobler 1 environ
ment in which to live and study,
which, to a great extent, can be
accomplished by dormitory reno
vations; second, more time to
study and think on one's own,
which can be created by diminish
ing the mechanical aspects of
courses; and, third, more valua
ble instruction from professors,
and more intimate and worth
while associations among profes
sors and students.
Meaningful
In a word, Pr'of. Stone is advo
cating a personally meaningful
academic freedom in an ennobling
atmosphere; for this is the condi
tion, he believes, in which stu
dents will awaken lo themselves.
We need not question the ger

minating powers of personally
meaningful freedom, but we may
question whether or not Prof,
i Stone's ideal conditions could pro
| vide, by themselves, an academic
freedom which would prove to be
personally meaningful.
Prof. Stone seems to think that,
given the goals of a course, and
! the freedom to pursue these goals
under' the above-stated ideal con
ditions, a student would be forced
to take advantage of his freedom
for the sake of academic survival.
He might even join other stu
dents to for m academic seminars
and societies which resembled
those at thie English universities.
And, thus, he could be said to be
using his freedom meaningfully,
for some pur pose.
For Knrichment
And it MIGHT prove to be for'
the purpose of self - enrichment,
but it might turn out to lie for no

other purpose than that of aca
demic survival, and this latter un
fortunate possibility is one which
Prof. Stone fails to consider.
And lie also fails to consider an
even worse possibility the fact
that many students under the
new conditions might regard their
increased freedom as passively as
they regard whatever freedom
they now have.
Vain Hope?
The ideal attitude under the
new conditions would be to hope
that students who did not find
their freedom personally mean
ingful at the beginning might find
meaning in their freedom through
exposure to the ideal conditions;
but thi-s might prove to be an all
too vain hope.
Certainly, we are not encour
aged by Prof. SI one's summation
of ihe student response to his pro
posals: "It's a good idea, but 1
wouldn't like it. I'd have to work
too hard.".
The problem would be the same
in that ideal situation as it is in
our present situation the prob
lem of finding an effective yet
urvrestrictive means to instill di
rection into the students, in order
that their academic freedom may
have some personal meaning at
tached tf) it. The problem remains
the fundamental problem of awak
ening the spirit.
Bui this task is not beyond our
means.
Let us consider some helpful ad
ditions to the plan which Prof.
Stone has presented.
First of all, in order to diminish
the possibility of continued pas
sivity among any large number of
students, let us substitute the ab
solute standard for the bell-curve
in the grading system, in order to
encourage an attitude of pride in
one's work, and discourage an at
titudeof flippancy in trying mere
ly "to beat the curve."
Give Unity
Secondly, in order to give some
unity to the undergraduate edu
cation, in order to help piece to
gether the many and divergent
courses which each student has to
take, let us introduce a compul

sory course in philosophy whose
task would go beyond that of the
course in Western Civilization.
It would seel-;, in an epistemo
logical discussion, not only to re
late the fields of the humanities
as fields of knowledge, but to re
late every branch of knowledge
with every other and to depict
them in an interrelated whole.
And the course would seek also,
in an ethical discussion, to provide
insight into the value of knowl
edge in general, the intrinsic val
ues of the various particular
branches of knowledge and the
value of each branch as it is re
lated to the others.
Need challenge
Finally, let us challenge our
students, whether it be through
dramatic exhortation or through
confidential discussion, to go be
yond the goals of their particular
courses and to discover in their
over-ail undergraduate education
some purposes meaningful to
them individually not .just the
purposes of Moses, Christ, or Soc
rates, but purposes of their own
which will acl as incentives to
continue the enjoyment of edu
cation throughout their lives.
Let us inculcate our students
with an attitude of life-affirma
tion; let us enshrine the "eelebra
t ions of I he human soul."
And let us DARK our students
(a dare is what they really need! i
to use their experiences here to
discover and to develop in them
selves the latent noble powers
which make them men even men
of potential greatness.
Awakens Souls
For this is the idea which awak
ens the souls of men; the idea,
when implanted, w hi c h grows
from a gnawing suspicion into an
indestructible faith; that, no mat
ter how vast the experience of a
man, he always remains for him
self the receptacle of something
inoie profound and more glorious
a golden SOMETHING which
merely awaits within his discov
ery and cultivation.
But the idea must be implanted
first! And then we shall see an
I awakening. . . .
For some people, man is not an
insipid bug who whirls aimlessly
through the multitudinous galax
ies. For some people, man is a
creature who finds himself at the
very center of all existence be
tween the infinities of the celes

tial universe and the infinities of
1 his own oceanic soul.
And we may say of these people
. of creative spirit, these sustainers
t of the dignity of man, that they
> not only VALUF their experiences
. as men; they THRIVE on them,
-j They like to communicate with

one another for the sake of their
mutual enrichment; they seek to
cultivate about themselves an at
mosphere of creativity; and, thus,
as one of their fondest tasks, they
seek to awaken the creative spirit
in others, especially young peo
ple, in order to assure the per
petuation of such an atmosphere.
Great Fortune
It is Stanford's great fortune
that a few of these creative spir
its have congregated here. Some
of these people have shown a
great interest in the cause of a
general awakening. But a general
awakening bus yet to come.
Some observers believe that
such an awakening is beyond the
realm of possibility, that we
should be satisfied with the en
thusiasm of our better students,
as at present.
But other- observers, more opti
mistic, believe that to ignore the
mass ol' the Stanford students is
to ignore a vast reserve of latent
spiritual energy; and that with
further efforts we should be able
to awaken this spirit, and develop
its intensity to the point where it
equals that of Harvard and the
English universities.
Takes Lead
The man who takes the lead in
proposing a plan for the realiza
tion of this awakening is Prof.
Wilfred H. Stone. In his recent
Sequoia article he prescribes a set
of ideal conditions which, he feels,
if effected at Stanford, won! d

force the students to fall bark
upon their own initiatives, and
discover their latent energies.
Included among his ideal condi
tions are, first, a nobler 1 environ

which, to a great extent, can be
accomplished by dormitory reno

exposure to the ideal conditions;
but thi-s might prove to be an all
too vain hope.
Certainly, we are not encour
aged by Prof. SI one's summation
of ihe student response to his pro
posals: "It's a good idea, but 1
wouldn't like it. I'd have to work
too hard.".
The problem would be the same
in that ideal situation as it is in
our present situation the prob
lem of finding an effective yet
urvrestrictive means to instill di
rection into the students, in order
that their academic freedom may
have some personal meaning at
tached tf) it. The problem remains
the fundamental problem of awak
ening the spirit.
Bui this task is not beyond our
means.
Let us consider some helpful ad
ditions to the plan which Prof.
Stone has presented.
First of all, in order to diminish
the possibility of continued pas
sivity among any large number of
students, let us substitute the ab
solute standard for the bell-curve
in the grading system, in order to
encourage an attitude of pride in
one's work, and discourage an at
titudeof flippancy in trying mere
ly "to beat the curve."
Give Unity
Secondly, in order to give some
unity to the undergraduate edu
cation, in order to help piece to
gether the many and divergent
courses which each student has to
take, let us introduce a compul

sory course in philosophy whose
task would go beyond that of the
course in Western Civilization.
It would seel-;, in an epistemo
logical discussion, not only to re
late the fields of the humanities
as fields of knowledge, but to re
late every branch of knowledge
with every other and to depict
them in an interrelated whole.
And the course would seek also,
in an ethical discussion, to provide
insight into the value of knowl
edge in general, the intrinsic val
ues of the various particular
branches of knowledge and the
value of each branch as it is re
lated to the others.
Need challenge
Finally, let us challenge our
students, whether it be through
dramatic exhortation or through
confidential discussion, to go be
yond the goals of their particular
courses and to discover in their
over-ail undergraduate education
some purposes meaningful to
them individually not .just the
purposes of Moses, Christ, or Soc
rates, but purposes of their own
which will acl as incentives to
continue the enjoyment of edu
cation throughout their lives.
Let us inculcate our students
with an attitude of life-affirma
tion; let us enshrine the "eelebra
t ions of I he human soul."
And let us DARK our students
(a dare is what they really need! i
to use their experiences here to
discover and to develop in them
selves the latent noble powers
which make them men even men
of potential greatness.
Awakens Souls
For this is the idea which awak
ens the souls of men; the idea,
when implanted, w hi c h grows
from a gnawing suspicion into an
indestructible faith; that, no mat
ter how vast the experience of a
man, he always remains for him
self the receptacle of something
inoie profound and more glorious
a golden SOMETHING which
merely awaits within his discov
ery and cultivation.
But the idea must be implanted
first! And then we shall see an
I awakening. . . .
For some people, man is not an
insipid bug who whirls aimlessly
through the multitudinous galax
ies. For some people, man is a
creature who finds himself at the
very center of all existence be
tween the infinities of the celes

tial universe and the infinities of
1 his own oceanic soul.
And we may say of these people
. of creative spirit, these sustainers
t of the dignity of man, that they
> not only VALUF their experiences
. as men; they THRIVE on them,
-j They like to communicate with

one another for the sake of their
mutual enrichment; they seek to
cultivate about themselves an at
mosphere of creativity; and, thus,
as one of their fondest tasks, they
seek to awaken the creative spirit
in others, especially young peo
ple, in order to assure the per
petuation of such an atmosphere.
Great Fortune
It is Stanford's great fortune
that a few of these creative spir
its have congregated here. Some
of these people have shown a
great interest in the cause of a
general awakening. But a general
awakening bus yet to come.
Some observers believe that
such an awakening is beyond the
realm of possibility, that we
should be satisfied with the en
thusiasm of our better students,
as at present.
But other- observers, more opti
mistic, believe that to ignore the
mass ol' the Stanford students is
to ignore a vast reserve of latent
spiritual energy; and that with
further efforts we should be able
to awaken this spirit, and develop
its intensity to the point where it
equals that of Harvard and the
English universities.
Takes Lead
The man who takes the lead in
proposing a plan for the realiza
tion of this awakening is Prof.
Wilfred H. Stone. In his recent
Sequoia article he prescribes a set
of ideal conditions which, he feels,
if effected at Stanford, won! d

force the students to fall bark
upon their own initiatives, and
discover their latent energies.
Included among his ideal condi
tions are, first, a nobler 1 environ
ment in which to live and study,
which, to a great extent, can be
accomplished by dormitory reno
vations; second, more time to
study and think on one's own,
which can be created by diminish
ing the mechanical aspects of
courses; and, third, more valua
ble instruction from professors,
and more intimate and worth
while associations among profes
sors and students.
Meaningful
In a word, Pr'of. Stone is advo
cating a personally meaningful
academic freedom in an ennobling
atmosphere; for this is the condi
tion, he believes, in which stu
dents will awaken lo themselves.
We need not question the ger

minating powers of personally
meaningful freedom, but we may
question whether or not Prof,
i Stone's ideal conditions could pro
| vide, by themselves, an academic
freedom which would prove to be
personally meaningful.
Prof. Stone seems to think that,
given the goals of a course, and
! the freedom to pursue these goals
under' the above-stated ideal con
ditions, a student would be forced
to take advantage of his freedom
for the sake of academic survival.
He might even join other stu
dents to for m academic seminars
and societies which resembled
those at thie English universities.
And, thus, he could be said to be
using his freedom meaningfully,
for some pur pose.
For Knrichment
And it MIGHT prove to be for'
the purpose of self - enrichment,
but it might turn out to lie for no

other purpose than that of aca
demic survival, and this latter un
fortunate possibility is one which
Prof. Stone fails to consider.
And lie also fails to consider an
even worse possibility the fact
that many students under the
new conditions might regard their
increased freedom as passively as
they regard whatever freedom
they now have.
Vain Hope?
The ideal attitude under the
new conditions would be to hope
that students who did not find
their freedom personally mean
ingful at the beginning might find
meaning in their freedom through
exposure to the ideal conditions;
but thi-s might prove to be an all
too vain hope.
Certainly, we are not encour

Need challenge
Finally, let us challenge our
students, whether it be through
dramatic exhortation or through
confidential discussion, to go be
yond the goals of their particular
courses and to discover in their
over-ail undergraduate education
some purposes meaningful to
them individually not .just the
purposes of Moses, Christ, or Soc
rates, but purposes of their own
which will acl as incentives to
continue the enjoyment of edu
cation throughout their lives.
Let us inculcate our students
with an attitude of life-affirma
tion; let us enshrine the "eelebra
t ions of I he human soul."
And let us DARK our students
(a dare is what they really need! i
to use their experiences here to
discover and to develop in them
selves the latent noble powers
which make them men even men
of potential greatness.
Awakens Souls
For this is the idea which awak
ens the souls of men; the idea,
when implanted, w hi c h grows
from a gnawing suspicion into an
indestructible faith; that, no mat
ter how vast the experience of a
man, he always remains for him
self the receptacle of something
inoie profound and more glorious
a golden SOMETHING which
merely awaits within his discov
ery and cultivation.
But the idea must be implanted
first! And then we shall see an
I awakening. . . .
For some people, man is not an
insipid bug who whirls aimlessly
through the multitudinous galax
ies. For some people, man is a
creature who finds himself at the
very center of all existence be
tween the infinities of the celes

tial universe and the infinities of
1 his own oceanic soul.
And we may say of these people
. of creative spirit, these sustainers
t of the dignity of man, that they
> not only VALUF their experiences
. as men; they THRIVE on them,
-j They like to communicate with

one another for the sake of their
mutual enrichment; they seek to
cultivate about themselves an at
mosphere of creativity; and, thus,
as one of their fondest tasks, they
seek to awaken the creative spirit
in others, especially young peo
ple, in order to assure the per
petuation of such an atmosphere.
Great Fortune
It is Stanford's great fortune
that a few of these creative spir
its have congregated here. Some
of these people have shown a
great interest in the cause of a
general awakening. But a general
awakening bus yet to come.
Some observers believe that
such an awakening is beyond the
realm of possibility, that we
should be satisfied with the en
thusiasm of our better students,
as at present.
But other- observers, more opti
mistic, believe that to ignore the
mass ol' the Stanford students is
to ignore a vast reserve of latent
spiritual energy; and that with
further efforts we should be able
to awaken this spirit, and develop
its intensity to the point where it
equals that of Harvard and the
English universities.
Takes Lead
The man who takes the lead in
proposing a plan for the realiza
tion of this awakening is Prof.
Wilfred H. Stone. In his recent
Sequoia article he prescribes a set
of ideal conditions which, he feels,
if effected at Stanford, won! d

force the students to fall bark
upon their own initiatives, and
discover their latent energies.
Included among his ideal condi
tions are, first, a nobler 1 environ
ment in which to live and study,
which, to a great extent, can be
accomplished by dormitory reno
vations; second, more time to
study and think on one's own,
which can be created by diminish
ing the mechanical aspects of
courses; and, third, more valua
ble instruction from professors,
and more intimate and worth
while associations among profes
sors and students.
Meaningful
In a word, Pr'of. Stone is advo
cating a personally meaningful
academic freedom in an ennobling
atmosphere; for this is the condi
tion, he believes, in which stu
dents will awaken lo themselves.
We need not question the ger

minating powers of personally
meaningful freedom, but we may
question whether or not Prof,
i Stone's ideal conditions could pro
| vide, by themselves, an academic
freedom which would prove to be
personally meaningful.
Prof. Stone seems to think that,
given the goals of a course, and
! the freedom to pursue these goals
under' the above-stated ideal con
ditions, a student would be forced
to take advantage of his freedom
for the sake of academic survival.
He might even join other stu
dents to for m academic seminars
and societies which resembled
those at thie English universities.
And, thus, he could be said to be
using his freedom meaningfully,
for some pur pose.
For Knrichment
And it MIGHT prove to be for'
the purpose of self - enrichment,
but it might turn out to lie for no

other purpose than that of aca
demic survival, and this latter un
fortunate possibility is one which
Prof. Stone fails to consider.
And lie also fails to consider an
even worse possibility the fact
that many students under the
new conditions might regard their
increased freedom as passively as
they regard whatever freedom
they now have.
Vain Hope?
The ideal attitude under the
new conditions would be to hope
that students who did not find
their freedom personally mean
ingful at the beginning might find
meaning in their freedom through
exposure to the ideal conditions;
but thi-s might prove to be an all
too vain hope.
Certainly, we are not encour
aged by Prof. SI one's summation
of ihe student response to his pro
posals: "It's a good idea, but 1
wouldn't like it. I'd have to work
too hard.".
The problem would be the same
in that ideal situation as it is in
our present situation the prob
lem of finding an effective yet
urvrestrictive means to instill di
rection into the students, in order
that their academic freedom may
have some personal meaning at
tached tf) it. The problem remains
the fundamental problem of awak
ening the spirit.
Bui this task is not beyond our
means.
Let us consider some helpful ad
ditions to the plan which Prof.
Stone has presented.
First of all, in order to diminish
the possibility of continued pas
sivity among any large number of
students, let us substitute the ab
solute standard for the bell-curve
in the grading system, in order to
encourage an attitude of pride in
one's work, and discourage an at
titudeof flippancy in trying mere
ly "to beat the curve."
Give Unity
Secondly, in order to give some
unity to the undergraduate edu
cation, in order to help piece to
gether the many and divergent
courses which each student has to
take, let us introduce a compul

sory course in philosophy whose
task would go beyond that of the
course in Western Civilization.
It would seel-;, in an epistemo
logical discussion, not only to re
late the fields of the humanities
as fields of knowledge, but to re
late every branch of knowledge
with every other and to depict
them in an interrelated whole.
And the course would seek also,
in an ethical discussion, to provide
insight into the value of knowl
edge in general, the intrinsic val
ues of the various particular
branches of knowledge and the
value of each branch as it is re
lated to the others.
