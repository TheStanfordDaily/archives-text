Japanese Schools
Editor, The Daily:
In today's Daily, I read an ar
ticle about Japanese education
and textbooks based on Mr. Ada
chi, the chief of the textbook sec
tion of Ministry of Education.
Frankly, I have never 1 seen this
kind of superficial remarks be
fore. 1 know it is presumptuous
to criticize others but I know bet
ter 1 than to stick to pseudo-polite
ness when I have a ground for it.
He said he prefers the compre
hensive school systems of the U.S.
and Japan to the separate schools
and selective examinations of
England and Germany. This
might be true of the U.S. but not
of Japan. Though we changed
our education after the war with
what we call comprehensive sys
tem, 1 am afraid Japan is only
superficial and it is not working.
There are millions of problems
caused by contradictions occur
red in the process of pre-war sys
tem to post - war system which
have been left untouched politi
cally. These problems have made
competition to enter so-called
famed schools much severer.
I know pupils in upper class of
elementary schools are required
to work till late at night if they
want to enter so-called good jun
ior high schools. Yes, public jun
ior high schools except those at
tached to national universities do
not have entrance examination.
However, vainglorious parents
are eager to make their- children
enter famed private junior high
schools or those attached to na
tional universities only because
these schools have maintained
pre-war- high standard and others
have not caught up with them be
cause of political negligence. I
remind you that in the case of
high schools the competition is
beyond imagination.
Next about textbooks. He said,
"The contents of Japanese books
are very much on a par, this is
because there is so much compe
tition of publishers to release
good material." As far as I know,
the standard of textbooks is high

er than that of the U.S., but "on
a par" means ail the textbooks
are made or given pressure to
make, to lit conservative or reac
tionary purposes of the conserva
tive party. I recall myself the
fact that the conservative party
expelled all textbooks edited by
so - called progressive • professor
groups, almost all of whom are
considered more or less conserva
tive in other society.

Congratulations to the Housing
Committee for their integration
plan. With all due respect to
members of my own class, I con
tend that as a freshman I found
that experience (particularly with
the University), stimulation, and
serious thought came from up
perclassmen ;dorm life furnished
almost none.
"Never mind," someone said.
"Next year, you'll be in an upper
class dorm." 112 live in Lag this
year more than 250 residents,
with the stimulation of two jun
iors, no seniors.
Why not substitute a decent
chance for contact with members
of seven classes for our class reg
imentation housing system?

Perhaps that sentimental epi
taph for Taft should also include
the fact that he opposed lend
lease, the UN' Charter, foreign aid
to Britain, the Marshall Plan, and
he was against arming NATO
with more than four U.S. divi
sions.
Similarly, his maneuverings
before the 1950 Ohio elections
should be sufficient evidence that
he was not always aloof from
pressure-group politics.

he was against arming NATO

In today's Daily, I read an ar
ticle about Japanese education
and textbooks based on Mr. Ada
chi, the chief of the textbook sec
tion of Ministry of Education.
Frankly, I have never 1 seen this
kind of superficial remarks be
fore. 1 know it is presumptuous
to criticize others but I know bet
ter 1 than to stick to pseudo-polite
ness when I have a ground for it.
He said he prefers the compre
hensive school systems of the U.S.
and Japan to the separate schools
and selective examinations of
England and Germany. This
might be true of the U.S. but not
of Japan. Though we changed
our education after the war with
what we call comprehensive sys
tem, 1 am afraid Japan is only
superficial and it is not working.
There are millions of problems
caused by contradictions occur
red in the process of pre-war sys
tem to post - war system which
have been left untouched politi
cally. These problems have made
competition to enter so-called
famed schools much severer.
I know pupils in upper class of
elementary schools are required
to work till late at night if they
want to enter so-called good jun
ior high schools. Yes, public jun
ior high schools except those at
tached to national universities do
not have entrance examination.
However, vainglorious parents
are eager to make their- children
enter famed private junior high
schools or those attached to na
tional universities only because
these schools have maintained
pre-war- high standard and others
have not caught up with them be
cause of political negligence. I
remind you that in the case of
high schools the competition is
beyond imagination.
Next about textbooks. He said,
"The contents of Japanese books
are very much on a par, this is
because there is so much compe
tition of publishers to release
good material." As far as I know,
the standard of textbooks is high

er than that of the U.S., but "on
a par" means ail the textbooks
are made or given pressure to
make, to lit conservative or reac
tionary purposes of the conserva
tive party. I recall myself the
fact that the conservative party
expelled all textbooks edited by
so - called progressive • professor
groups, almost all of whom are
considered more or less conserva
tive in other society.
