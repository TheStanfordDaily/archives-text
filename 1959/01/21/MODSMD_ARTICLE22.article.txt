# TONIGHT
## At the Symphony 
### Diana Smith 
Soprano Eileen Farrell returns
to the Opera House tonight to
join the San Francisco Symphony
in an all-Wagner evening.
Since singing "Medea" to open
last autumn's San Francisco op
era season she has been marked
by many as the best dramatic so
prano in the country. Her oper
atic reputation began a couple of
seasons ago; until then Miss Far
rell had been primarily a concert
artist. She has, incidentally, nev
er sung at the Met.
"Medea" is something of a mar
athon role, and Miss Farrell
brought to it sustained fine sing
ing rather than an outstanding
dramatic performance (the latter
is Callas' forte).
Tonight's program should
evoke another powerful perform
ance: Miss Farrell will sing the

Prelude and Love Death ("Liebes
tod") from "Tristan and Isolde,"
and BrUnnhilde's Immolation
Scene from"The Twilight of the
Gods" ("Die Gotterdammerung"),
last of the "Ring" cycle.
"Liebestod" is Isolde's parting
agony in life, sung over the dying
Tristan as she prepares to join
him. The orchestra will also play
the prelude to that act, the third.
BrUnnhilde's Immolation Scene
is another sort of destruction; the
slain Siegfried is born in a death
march to the funeral pyre Brunn
hilde has had prepared for her'
lover. After proclaiming the end
|of the cursed ring odyssey she
j rides into the flames.
Enrique Jorda will open the
program with the overture to
I "Das Liebesverbot,"' Wagner's
I earliest, and seldom performed,
I opera.
