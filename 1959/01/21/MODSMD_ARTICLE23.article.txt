Unmatched Engineering Facilities for Devel
oping Advanced Flight Propulsion Systems
Operations at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft are essen
tially those of an engineering and development
organization. As such, an engineering atmosphere
dominates the work being done, much of which
directly involves laboratory experimentation.
In the past three decades, expansion at Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft has been almost tenfold. In
recent years, greatest emphasis has been on extend
ing engineering facilities to meet the needs of ad
vanced research and development programs in flight
propulsion.
Among the Connecticut P&WA facilities are
many that are unequaled in the industry. Thus
today, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft is better prepared
than ever to continue development of the world's
best aircraft powerplants ... to probe the propulsion
future ... to build and test greatly advanced pro
pulsion systems for coming generations of flight vehi
cles — in whatever form they take.

The Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Laboratory, oper
ated bv Pratt & Whitney Aireraft, is situated on a 1,200-aere
tract near Middletown. 7'he Laboratory was specially built
lor the development of nuclear flight propulsion systems.


The Willgoos Turbine Engine Test Facility is the
world's most extensive privately owned turbine
development laboratory. Designed and built spe
cifically to test full-scaie experimental engines and
components in environments simulating conditions
at extreme altitudes and speeds, it is currently
undergoing expansions that will greatly increase
its capacity fur development testing of the most
advanced forms of air breathing systems.


In chambers like ihis ;i1 the Willgoos Turbine
Engine Test Facility full-scale engines may he
tested in environments which simulate conditions
trorn sea level to 100,000 feet. Much 3 conditions
can also he simulated here.


In the now Fuel Systems Laboratory engineers
can minutely analyze the effects of extreme en
vironmental conditions on components of fuel
systems — conditions such as those encountered
in advanced types of flight vehicles operating at
high Mach numbers and high altitudes. Fuel for
these tests can be supplied at any temperature
from — 65'F to +500°F.
