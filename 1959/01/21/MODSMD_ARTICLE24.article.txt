More Work for Neumann
Another challenger for' raid Neumann arrives Saturday: College
of Pacific's 5-10 shooting star Dave Klurman. "Challenger'' because
every time Paul steps out on the court it seems that he is being pitted
against somebody else touted as Best in the West.
Neumann's performance in tlie Cards' defeat ol Cal Friday was
one of the more brilliant all-around shows we've seen in years. In
addition to shooting the eyes out of the basket, he almost single
handedly frustrated the Bears' full-court press.
Paul can attain certain immortality among Stanford's all-time
cage stars if he can manage to average 18.1 points a game the rest
of the way. Providing lhal the season ends with the close of the
regular schedule.
One hundred eighty-one points in 10 games would give Neumann
an even 1000 for a career. Rigid now he is ninth in Stanford history
as a career scorer and barring injuries is a virtual certainty to wind
up al least fifth, behind Ron Tomsic (1416), llank Luisetti
Hill Bond (101:i) and .lint Ramstead (!)J>2).

In fact, one field goal this week a reasonably safe assumption
will push Paul past George Yardley (820) and into eighth place in
the standings.
Yardley equaled that total, and then some, in just one year last
season when he threw in 2001 points for the Detroit Pistons an all
lime National Basketball Association mark.
He shouldn't be too concerned over being lowered a notch in Stan
ford scoring.
Saturday, Neumann will be mixing it with the Coast's leading
scorer. In the absence of Elgin Baylors, Klurman paces ;ill scorers
in the West with only a 23 0 average. This is good enough for 12th
among the national leaders.
So far this season, Neumann has met, and done great against, the
two guards expected to give him the most trouble for All-PCC
honor: Al Bucli of California and Whaylon Coleman of Idaho.
But about every team in the conference, with one 'nig exception,
looks strong at the guard positions. Besides Bucli, Cal has a stand
out in Denny Fitzpatrick, and Coleman has a good running-mate in
John Liveious. Oregon State boasts of Lee llarman and Jim Ander
son; Oregon has two double-figure scorers in Chuck Rask and Bud
Kuykendall; Washington State has its speedy little Jim Ross and
UCLA boasts Denny Crum and, of course, forward-guard Walt Tor
rente.
Plenty of All-Coast candidates. And Washington, glaringly weak
in I lie back court, would probably take any one of them.
Unorthodox, liul Outstanding
LOTS OF lILLP: But not to give the impression this is a one-man
nhow. Howie Dallmar speaking: "Granted he's unorthodox, 1 don't
think lie made two mistakes over the weekend. He had the big re
sponsibility against Cal and did a tremendous job. The others didn't
hold up."
Dick Haga is the subject. Probably one of the greatest rebound
ers, for his si/.e, in this age of giants, Haga has developed into an
outstanding scorer this season.
His high arching pushers and jumpers against. Cal Friday—yes,
unorthodox looking — hit nothing but the bottom of the net and
llama's second half must rank with the finest of clutch shooting
displays of the season.
Not to mention Doug Warren's last-minute "crucials." Or John
Arrillaga's baskets that looked, for a time, that they were going to
keep the Cards in Saturday's game at Berkeley.
But the lack of height is going to be a real handicap coming down
the stretch drive. It's got to be ranked as one of the finest outside
shooting fives ihe league has seen.
NO WESTERNERS: Not only is Klurman the leading scorer in
fhese parts, but he is only one of two West Coast cagers in the na
tion's top 50 scorers. The other, freshman Frank Burgess of Gon
zaga, is back in 31st.
In rebounds, there is only one Westerner; but he is the leader—
Leroy Wright of COP. More trouble for the Cards.

Arrillaga's baskets that looked, for a time, that they were going to
keep the Cards in Saturday's game at Berkeley.
But the lack of height is going to be a real handicap coming down
the stretch drive. It's got to be ranked as one of the finest outside
shooting fives ihe league has seen.
NO WESTERNERS: Not only is Klurman the leading scorer in
fhese parts, but he is only one of two West Coast cagers in the na
tion's top 50 scorers. The other, freshman Frank Burgess of Gon
zaga, is back in 31st.
In rebounds, there is only one Westerner; but he is the leader—
Leroy Wright of COP. More trouble for the Cards.

More Work for Neumann
Another challenger for' raid Neumann arrives Saturday: College
of Pacific's 5-10 shooting star Dave Klurman. "Challenger'' because
every time Paul steps out on the court it seems that he is being pitted
against somebody else touted as Best in the West.
Neumann's performance in tlie Cards' defeat ol Cal Friday was
one of the more brilliant all-around shows we've seen in years. In
addition to shooting the eyes out of the basket, he almost single
handedly frustrated the Bears' full-court press.
Paul can attain certain immortality among Stanford's all-time
cage stars if he can manage to average 18.1 points a game the rest
of the way. Providing lhal the season ends with the close of the
regular schedule.
One hundred eighty-one points in 10 games would give Neumann
an even 1000 for a career. Rigid now he is ninth in Stanford history
as a career scorer and barring injuries is a virtual certainty to wind
up al least fifth, behind Ron Tomsic (1416), llank Luisetti
Hill Bond (101:i) and .lint Ramstead (!)J>2).

In fact, one field goal this week a reasonably safe assumption
will push Paul past George Yardley (820) and into eighth place in
the standings.
Yardley equaled that total, and then some, in just one year last
season when he threw in 2001 points for the Detroit Pistons an all
lime National Basketball Association mark.
He shouldn't be too concerned over being lowered a notch in Stan
ford scoring.
Saturday, Neumann will be mixing it with the Coast's leading
scorer. In the absence of Elgin Baylors, Klurman paces ;ill scorers
in the West with only a 23 0 average. This is good enough for 12th
among the national leaders.
So far this season, Neumann has met, and done great against, the
two guards expected to give him the most trouble for All-PCC
honor: Al Bucli of California and Whaylon Coleman of Idaho.
But about every team in the conference, with one 'nig exception,
looks strong at the guard positions. Besides Bucli, Cal has a stand
out in Denny Fitzpatrick, and Coleman has a good running-mate in
John Liveious. Oregon State boasts of Lee llarman and Jim Ander
son; Oregon has two double-figure scorers in Chuck Rask and Bud
Kuykendall; Washington State has its speedy little Jim Ross and
UCLA boasts Denny Crum and, of course, forward-guard Walt Tor
rente.
Plenty of All-Coast candidates. And Washington, glaringly weak
in I lie back court, would probably take any one of them.

LOTS OF lILLP: But not to give the impression this is a one-man
nhow. Howie Dallmar speaking: "Granted he's unorthodox, 1 don't
think lie made two mistakes over the weekend. He had the big re
sponsibility against Cal and did a tremendous job. The others didn't
hold up."
Dick Haga is the subject. Probably one of the greatest rebound
ers, for his si/.e, in this age of giants, Haga has developed into an
outstanding scorer this season.
His high arching pushers and jumpers against. Cal Friday—yes,
unorthodox looking — hit nothing but the bottom of the net and
llama's second half must rank with the finest of clutch shooting
displays of the season.
Not to mention Doug Warren's last-minute "crucials." Or John
Arrillaga's baskets that looked, for a time, that they were going to
keep the Cards in Saturday's game at Berkeley.
But the lack of height is going to be a real handicap coming down
the stretch drive. It's got to be ranked as one of the finest outside
shooting fives ihe league has seen.
NO WESTERNERS: Not only is Klurman the leading scorer in
fhese parts, but he is only one of two West Coast cagers in the na
tion's top 50 scorers. The other, freshman Frank Burgess of Gon
zaga, is back in 31st.
In rebounds, there is only one Westerner; but he is the leader—
Leroy Wright of COP. More trouble for the Cards.

More Work for Neumann
Another challenger for' raid Neumann arrives Saturday: College
of Pacific's 5-10 shooting star Dave Klurman. "Challenger'' because
every time Paul steps out on the court it seems that he is being pitted
against somebody else touted as Best in the West.
Neumann's performance in tlie Cards' defeat ol Cal Friday was
one of the more brilliant all-around shows we've seen in years. In
addition to shooting the eyes out of the basket, he almost single
handedly frustrated the Bears' full-court press.
Paul can attain certain immortality among Stanford's all-time
cage stars if he can manage to average 18.1 points a game the rest
of the way. Providing lhal the season ends with the close of the
regular schedule.
One hundred eighty-one points in 10 games would give Neumann
an even 1000 for a career. Rigid now he is ninth in Stanford history
as a career scorer and barring injuries is a virtual certainty to wind
up al least fifth, behind Ron Tomsic (1416), llank Luisetti
Hill Bond (101:i) and .lint Ramstead (!)J>2).
Ki"h(h Place by Saturday
r* j J
In fact, one field goal this week a reasonably safe assumption
will push Paul past George Yardley (820) and into eighth place in
the standings.
Yardley equaled that total, and then some, in just one year last
season when he threw in 2001 points for the Detroit Pistons an all
lime National Basketball Association mark.
He shouldn't be too concerned over being lowered a notch in Stan
ford scoring.
Saturday, Neumann will be mixing it with the Coast's leading
scorer. In the absence of Elgin Baylors, Klurman paces ;ill scorers
in the West with only a 23 0 average. This is good enough for 12th
among the national leaders.
So far this season, Neumann has met, and done great against, the
two guards expected to give him the most trouble for All-PCC
honor: Al Bucli of California and Whaylon Coleman of Idaho.
But about every team in the conference, with one 'nig exception,
looks strong at the guard positions. Besides Bucli, Cal has a stand
out in Denny Fitzpatrick, and Coleman has a good running-mate in
John Liveious. Oregon State boasts of Lee llarman and Jim Ander
son; Oregon has two double-figure scorers in Chuck Rask and Bud
Kuykendall; Washington State has its speedy little Jim Ross and
UCLA boasts Denny Crum and, of course, forward-guard Walt Tor
rente.
Plenty of All-Coast candidates. And Washington, glaringly weak
in I lie back court, would probably take any one of them.
