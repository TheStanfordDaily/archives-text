# Meet the Cards
## 
### 
Played most of his time with
Braves last year except for four
points of varsity action. Weer
sing is a hard worker, has plen
ty of desire. Agile and a good
jumper, he should develop into
a good man on boards. Seems
lo be a year away from lop
notch varsity play. Stands 6-4,
weighs 195.

One of the three men up from
frosh squad. Third high scorer
with frosh last year. Has fine
shooting potential and is a good
all-around player. Needs expe
rience and will get it with
Braves and varsity this year.
Seems to be a year away from
varsity competition right now.
May come along. 6-2, 170.
