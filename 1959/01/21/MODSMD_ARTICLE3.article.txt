## Craig Outlines New Restrictions 
### Jack Winkler, Associate Editor 
The up-and-down question has finally settled -down.
Dean of Men William G. Craig yesterday issued a four-point pro
gram restricting the legality of women upstairs in men's residences
to one night a week, but also suggested that the whole plan may be
changed when the new fraternity clusters, with their resident faculty

advisors, arc built in the next few
years.
1. Except for registered open
houses, a woman may enter
only the downstairs social area
of a man's residence.
%. One study-open house per
week may be scheduled in each
fraternity between the hours of
7 and 11 p.m. (On such occa
sions women may enter men's
rooms.)
3. In addition men's rooms in
fraternities may be opened to
women one evening each week
between 5:30 and 7:30 in con
nection with a registered din
ner.
4. These open houses may be
registered on a quarterly basis
and must be registered not la
ter than the Tuesday prior to
the event.
Inadequate Chaperonage
Inadequate chaperonage is the
main reason for the restrictions,
Craig said yesterday, and ac
counts for Stanford's difference
from more liberal poliices at
some Eastern men's universities.
This difficulty is touched on in
a formal statement also issued by
Craig yesterday to clarify the
new rule. .
"Upon recommendation of IFC
and AWS the University has
agreed to modify the existing
regulations concerning women in
fraternity houses.
"The primary purpose of this
experiment is to allow study
dates, this being the major reason
presented by the students in sup
port of their request for an ex
tension of these privileges.
Success in Toyon
"Similar experiments last year
with study open houses in Toyon
Hall on Sunday afternoons
proved very successful. These
changes represent something less
than the proposals originally
made by the student governing
groups.
"However, the limitations of
the physical arrangements in our
fraternity houses and acceptable
social standards allow for women
in men's rooms only under care
fully controlled conditions. At
the present time the statement is
being reviewed by AWS."
Interfraternity Council was dis
appointed with the plan after
their more liberal proposals had
been repeatedly turned down by
the Administration.
Hope for Review
IFC Social Chairman Bob Da
vies, Thota Delta Chi, said the
fraternities hoped a review would
be marie of the plan at the end of
the year, in hopes of liberalizing
it. Craig said nothing definite
was planned here.
lie added, however, that the
faculty residents planned for the
new fraternity clusters and the
faculty residents now in Stern
Hall may very well constitute the
adequate chaperonage needed for
a more liberal arrangement and
that the Administration would be
willing to listen to any sugges
tions in this area.
