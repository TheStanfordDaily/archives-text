# National Title, Olympics Aim of Stanford Crew
## 
### John Osmundson 
National championship races
and a shot at the 1960 Olympics
are foremost in the Stanford
crew's plans. But a more imme
diate goal is to beat California or
Washington to qualify for a trip
to the national in the East.
Beating Cal or Washington
isn't an official requirement for
qualification. Crew publicist Kent
Mitchell said, "We are dependent
on volunteer work and financing.
The cost of a trip back East is
only worth while if we have a
good team. Both Cal and Wash
ington always have strong crews
and we will have to have a good
crew to beat either of them."
Last year's freshman crew
came close; they lost to Cal by
only one length. In 1956 the var
sity crew beat everyone on the
coast, except Washington, and
then placed third in the nationals
at Syracuse, New York.

Returning veterans from the
groat 1956 crew, along with row
ers from last year's varsity and
freshman boats, form the skele
ton of another good crew. Two
year lettermen Dick Draeger and
Rolf Peterson and single mono
gram winners Paul Dougan,
Chuck Brothers and George
Beardsley are varsity returnees.
Olympic experience is not new
to the crew. Coaching varsity
boats is Conn Findley, an Olym
pic gold medal winner. In 1956
Findley, a USC graduate, teamed
with Stanford's Dan Ayrault and
Kurt Seiffert to win the "pairs
with cox" at Melbourne.
Seventy men took part in gruel
ing autumn quarter workouts.
Most of the time was spent on
conditioning and rowing. Now the
number has been cut to three
varsity boats and between two
and three freshman boats.
