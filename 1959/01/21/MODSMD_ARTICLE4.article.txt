# California Hiking Trip Recounted

### Lynne DeLargey 
Hiker Colin Fletcher left behind
the jangling telephones of the city
and -set forth "to discover the
true, unspoiled America — and
what did I find? California."
Listeners filled Memorial Audi
torium Tuesday night as Fletcher,
a former British commando, told
of his 1200-mile south-north walk
the length of the state last year.
Traveling alone and carrying a 50-
pound pack, Fletcher passed
through Death Valley, the Mojave
Desert and the Sierras on his way
to the Oregon border.
A high proportion of the color
photographs illustrating his talk
were of colorful desert flowers
which made the desert "smell like
a greenhouse."
Fletcher followed an old "wet
back trail" for 100 miles from the
Mexican border and thereafter
made his way with the aid of
U.S. topographical maps and wild
burrow trails. He traveled for
days at a time without seeing any
other human, subsisting on dehy
drated food or on fish from the
streams, photographing the rug
ged terrain, occasional wildlife
and a few signs of civilization.
He said that one day while
crossing the desert "suddenly I
remembered it was Monday and I
WASN'T commuting." At the Or
egon border on Sept. 8 Fletcher
ended his trek with a picture of
himself in "an idiotic pose of vic
tory." He said, "After six months
in the desert I was ready—even
eager—to get back and cope with
the rat race."
