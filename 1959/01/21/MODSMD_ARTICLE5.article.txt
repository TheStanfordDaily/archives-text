# Civil Rights Bill Proposed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —In a sur
prise move, Senate Democratic
Leader Lyndon B. Johnson intro
duced Tuesday the first broad
1959 civil rights bill—a measure
aimed at settling disputes with
the help of federal conciliation.
The Texan thus set the stage
for the expected battle in Con
gress over demands for putting
more teeth into the Civil Rights
Bill passed last year.
The plan would establish as an
independent federal agency a
community relations service to
help resolve civil rights disputes.
It would be patterned after the
present Mediation and Concilia
tion Service which deals with
management-labor controversies.
