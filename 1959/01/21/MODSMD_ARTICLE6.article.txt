# Criminal Justice Studied
## 
### 
California's protracted death
penalty cases might well make
the average citizen wonder when
the wheel stops turning in Ihc ad
ministration of criminal justice, a
study by the Stanford University
Law Review shows.
The study, published in the cur
rent issue of the Review, was
based on the actual procedure fol
lowed in 180 death penalty sen
tences handed down during the
past 15 years.
"The most realistic solution to
the problem of delay," said the
Review, "lies in eliminating mul
tiple post-conviction procedures to
allow speedy exhaustion of state
remedies, and in requiring expe
ditious handling of capital cases
by both state and federal courts.
Automat ic
In California, death sentences
are automatically appealed to the
state Supreme Court for review.
But, the study disclosed, in recent
years a rapidly growing number
of petitions have been filed in the

federal courts resulting In stays
of execution which account for 5!)
per cent of the delay.
The most flagrant abuse of this
log?!I privilege has been the filing
of petitions during the hours or
days just prior to the scheduled
execution.
Procedure
The Review suggests thai pro
cedure could be improved by re
quiring a trial record that in
cludes a specific recital of all pre
trial proceedings and a detailed
examination of the defendant by
the trial court on matters involv
ing constitutional rights, includ
ing such questions as the waiver
of counsel, the nature of his plea
and the circumstances surround
ing a confession.
On the problem of the misuse
of the appeal, the Review exam
j Ined many suggestions, hnl con
cluded, "There docs not appear lo
be a satisfactory solution for pre
venting last-minute filing of pe
titions."
