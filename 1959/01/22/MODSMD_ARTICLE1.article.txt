Growing steadily and quickly since its inception in 1946, and con

Stanford Research Institute is naturally thinking of and planning

"An excellent relationship exists between SRI and the University,"
Director E. Finley Carter said. "It has been to our mutual advantage.
In our early days, the name of Stanford gave us prestige, a high

prestige of the University."
