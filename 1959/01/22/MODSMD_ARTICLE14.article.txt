# SU Biophysicist Worked On Proton Ray Surgery
## Built Machine At Uppsala 
### Walt Wurfel 
Dr. Victor Burns, 33-year-old
research associate at the Stanford
Biophysics Laboratories, was in
strumental in construction of the*
proton ray equipment used by
Swedish doctors last week to per
form the first brain operation in
history without opening the pa
tient's skull.
Burns spent 1956 at the Univer
sity of Uppsala installing the
equipment with the aid of a Swed
ish associate, and instructing doc
tors in its use. Dr. Cornelius A.
Tobias, who developed the ma
chine at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, spent nine
months in 1958 in Sweden teach
ing them the "dry-surgery meth
od."
"We essentially gave them our
know-how," Burns said. Me is a
former student of Tobias', receiv
ing his Ph.D. in biophysics at Ber
keley in 1954.
The installations at Uppsala
and at Berkeley are the only two
using proton rays for medical op
erations, according to Burns.
Swedish Operation
The operation in Sweden was a
prefrontal lobotomy. Connecting
tissue which had grown between
two lobes of the brain was cut by
the proton ray, Burns explained.
A cyclotron producing 180 mil
lion proton volts was used for the
Swedish operation. The rays gen
erated "will penetrate about 23
centimeters of tissue," Burns
said. When doctors wish to use
only a part of the ray they ab
sorb part of the beam's strength
before it enters the patient's body.
The proton ray projector uses
a "knife-edge beam," which can
be focused as small as three milli
meters wide — "the high-energy
protons scatter very little in trav
eling through the head," Burns
continued. This is important, he
emphasized, in keeping unneces
sary radiation from entering the
body.
Sweden Ahead
Sweden is ahead in using pro
ton rays for brain surgery, he
said, but "the operation could
have been done at Cal earlier if
they had wanted to." At Berkeley
the emphasis has been on deaden
ing the pituitary gland to prevent
it from aggravating cases of
breast cancer.
"The technique is not a cancer
cure," Burns emphasized; the
ray is not used to destroy cancer
ous tissue although Uppsala plans
to do work in that field. Use of
the ray on pituitary glands at
Cal only postpones the effects of
cancer, he said.
Future Uses
As proton ray operating tech
nique develops, Burns said, the
effects of the beam can be further
localized to one spot in the pa
tient's body by rotating the pa
tient back and forth using the de
sired point of beam focus as the
axis. This will minimize radia
tion damage to tissue surround
ing the point of focus.
Little preparation is necessary
for patients operated on with pro
ton rays. No anesthetic is neces
sary, he said.
Burns does not expect proton
ray operating to be widely used
anywhere in the near future. "It's
all still very experimental," he
said. Future use of the technique
"will depend on how useful the
experiments prove to be."

it from aggravating cases of
breast cancer.
"The technique is not a cancer
cure," Burns emphasized; the
ray is not used to destroy cancer
ous tissue although Uppsala plans
to do work in that field. Use of
the ray on pituitary glands at
Cal only postpones the effects of
cancer, he said.
Future Uses
As proton ray operating tech
nique develops, Burns said, the
effects of the beam can be further
localized to one spot in the pa
tient's body by rotating the pa
tient back and forth using the de
sired point of beam focus as the
axis. This will minimize radia
tion damage to tissue surround
ing the point of focus.
Little preparation is necessary
for patients operated on with pro
ton rays. No anesthetic is neces
sary, he said.
Burns does not expect proton
ray operating to be widely used
anywhere in the near future. "It's
all still very experimental," he
said. Future use of the technique
"will depend on how useful the
experiments prove to be."

. . . AS PATIENT UNDERGOES "ATOMIC KNIFE" AT CAE
Dr. Victor Burns, 33-year-old
research associate at the Stanford
Biophysics Laboratories, was in
strumental in construction of the*
proton ray equipment used by
Swedish doctors last week to per
form the first brain operation in
history without opening the pa
tient's skull.
Burns spent 1956 at the Univer
sity of Uppsala installing the
equipment with the aid of a Swed
ish associate, and instructing doc
tors in its use. Dr. Cornelius A.
Tobias, who developed the ma
chine at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, spent nine
months in 1958 in Sweden teach
ing them the "dry-surgery meth
od."
"We essentially gave them our
know-how," Burns said. Me is a
former student of Tobias', receiv
ing his Ph.D. in biophysics at Ber
keley in 1954.
The installations at Uppsala
and at Berkeley are the only two
using proton rays for medical op
erations, according to Burns.
Swedish Operation
The operation in Sweden was a
prefrontal lobotomy. Connecting
tissue which had grown between
two lobes of the brain was cut by
the proton ray, Burns explained.
A cyclotron producing 180 mil
lion proton volts was used for the
Swedish operation. The rays gen
erated "will penetrate about 23
centimeters of tissue," Burns
said. When doctors wish to use
only a part of the ray they ab
sorb part of the beam's strength
before it enters the patient's body.
The proton ray projector uses
a "knife-edge beam," which can
be focused as small as three milli
meters wide — "the high-energy
protons scatter very little in trav
eling through the head," Burns
continued. This is important, he
emphasized, in keeping unneces
sary radiation from entering the
body.
Sweden Ahead
Sweden is ahead in using pro
ton rays for brain surgery, he
said, but "the operation could
have been done at Cal earlier if
they had wanted to." At Berkeley
the emphasis has been on deaden
ing the pituitary gland to prevent
it from aggravating cases of
breast cancer.
"The technique is not a cancer
cure," Burns emphasized; the
ray is not used to destroy cancer
ous tissue although Uppsala plans
