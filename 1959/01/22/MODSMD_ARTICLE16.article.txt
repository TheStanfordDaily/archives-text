# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Dulles Moves 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
At his press conference last
week Mr. Dulles opened the door
to negotiations on the future of
Germany, fie was scrupulously
careful to say that he was not
now negotiating with Mr. Miko
yan. But he has made it possible
for Mr. Mikoyan to report back to
Moscow that there is "a desire on
both sides to get together and
talk."
* * *
Mr. Dulles did this by making
two points. Neither of these
points is entirely new. But the
emphasis upon them, considering
the circumstances, gives them a
new importance.
The first point is that, while
the formula of reunification by
free elections is the "agreed for
mula," and while we think it is
"a natural method," he "would
n't say that it is the only meth
od by which reunification could
be accomplished."
The second point is his ac
ceptance of the principle that
for a reunited Germany there
must be military guarantees to
reassure the Soviet Union: "If
there is going to be any reuni
fication of Germany, it has got
to be under conditions which
take into account realistically
some of those very elemental,
primitive facts of life."
The record shows that the point
which Mr. Dulles made about free
elections was first made in our
note to the Soviet Union on Sept.
.'■so of last year, and was reiterated
in our note of Dec. 31.
For some months at least we
have not regarded free elections
as the necessary first step to Ger
man reunification. And the rec
ord shows also that we have long
recognized that if the Soviet Un
ion withdraws from a reunified
Germany it is entitled to have
military guarantees against the
possibility of German aggression.
i
Nevertheless, it is important
that Mr. Dulles emphasized these
two points on the eve of his sec
ond round of talks with Mr. Mi
koyan.
it was evident at the press con
ference that he was acutely aware
thei-e would be a reaction in Bonn,
possibly in London and in other
west European capitals. To soften
this reaction, he dwelt on the
thoroughness of our consultations
with our allies, and he spoke at
length on his agreement with and
admiration for Dr. Adenauer's
conception of European policy.
Hut his remarks th a t free
elections are not the only meth
od by which reunification can
be accomplished have, as the
dispatches show, aroused Dr.
Adenauer. It remains to be seen
whether once again, as on sev
eral previous occasions when
.Mr. Dulles tried not to be en
tirely inflexible, Dr. Adenauer
will compel Mr. Dulles to re
tract and reverse himself.
* * * \
The real question about free
elections is whether they must
come first—whether they are the
necessary first step to German
reunification. Those who hold this
view are in effect demanding the
liquidation of the East German
state and the absorption of the
East Germans into the West Ger
man state.
The trouble with this view is
that it is absolutely impossible to
achieve it in any foreseeable time;
for it demands an unconditional
surrender of the Soviet position
in the whole of Germany — and
unconditional surrender by the
Soviet Union is a pipe dream.
I think it is not unfair to say
that those who demand free elec
tions as the first step to German
reunification are not urgently in-

torested in bringing about reuni
fication.
Some of them want to believe—
hoping against hope - that tlie So
viet Union will somehow collapse.
Many of them do not want to have
lo face the enormously compli
cated problems which a reunified
Germany will pose. In the status
quo, with a divided Germany,
there are very powerful interests
which would prefer not tu be dis
turbed.
Thus, for example, a reuni
fied Germany with free elec
tions would be far more to tlie
left than Dr. Adenauer's Ger
many.
For another example, the
whole fascinating structure of
the west European political and
economic community which Mr.
Dulles spoke of would have se
rious problems of it had to di
gest the 17,000,000 East Ger
mans.
For still another example, a
reunified Germany could not
long remain the camping
ground of the NATO armies,
and this would raise the prob
lem of where the NATO forces
should be stationed.
* *• *
Against all these difficulties
there has, however, to be weighed
the grave and incalculable dan
gers of the continuing partition
ol' Germany; for, sooner or later,

there will be uprisings against the
Soviet hold on East Germany and
on Poland, and, if there are these
uprisings, we may all be sucked
into the struggle.
To avert that, it is necessary to
proceed to the reunification of
Germany, which, if I understood
him correctly, is what Mr. Dulles
has decided he must try to do.
If that is our purpose, there
is no reason why German re
unification should not begin
with a provisional regime—that
of a dual state with some com
mon political institutions —un-
der a pact or constitution which
promised that there should be a
gradual integration over a pe
riod of years, culminating in a
free election to select a constit
ii en t assembly, which would
form an all-German state.
* * *
This is only one among innu
mer a b 1 e conceivable ways of
bringing about reunification of
the two Germanys. The crucial
question is whether, on the Soviet
side and on our side, there is in
fact'a genuine will to make one
German state.
