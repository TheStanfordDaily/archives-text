Create, Not Criticize
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wheeler's article in yester
day's Daily on the awakening of
creativity presupposed thai man
has a soul or spirit to energize.
To stir up this latent spirit, we
were exhorted to integrate our
store of knowledge — scientific,
philosophical, etc. —into a whole.
This was to lead to a realization
of our own purpose.
However, in our attempts to do
just this, we seem to have either
a concept of man in
the imuge of electrochemical re
actions -or rendered the whole
problem of soul beyond the limits
of sense experience and, hence,
some hold, of philosophy.
"Oh, Divine Spark! Recharge
our frayed synapses and circuit
again through our neurochemical
mechanisms!" With this sort of
"philosophy" we have indeed
found and followed our own pur
pose: reproduction and reaction.
Obviously, Mr. Wheeler did not
mean this way of life, but what
rule or judgment do we use to
escape this result? Observing our
selves?
We were advised not to follow
just the purposes of "M oses,
Christ, or Socrates," but our own.
I think it ironic that Moses did
not pursue his own purpose,
Christ commanded men to for
sake themselves and their own
goals, and Socrates "awakened"
to the fact that he knew nothing
except his lack of knowledge.
Would this imply that, until a
man experienced his burning
bush, cross, or oracle, creativity
remained dormant? The "gnaw
ing suspicion" of "a golden Some
thing" seems to indicate a need
for committal of, rather than a
commuuing with, ourselves. In
this way ego does not hinder out
go; one can create, not criticize.

Cause For Hope
Editor, The Daily:
Much has been said of the apa
thetic American collegian, and the
Stanford student is not excepted
from such labels.
The performance of nearly 800
members of the Stanford commu
nity last week, however, offers
some cause for hope. It was not
mere attendance at the ASSU-IIR
Russian Institute, but rather the
encouragement came from Ihe
warmth of the response, the in
telligence of the questions raised,
and the depth of the interests
aroused in the participants.
As was pointed out during the
institute, its success wiii be de
termined within everyone who
has acquired the option to make
his experiences of the Russian In
stitute terminal or inspirational.

At Least Honest
Editor, The Daily:
The article yesterday—"Awak
ening of Creativity Yet to Come"
—is certainly an enthusiastic in
tellectual inspiration. Hut I think
it is wrong.
I do not deny that there are
people who THRIVE on thrusting
their infinite, oceanic souls into
the infinities of the celestial uni
verse in an orgy of inspired cre
ativity, but I have never known
anyone who could be like that
ALL THE TIME. If wc can only
be inspired some of the time, the
rest of the time we can at least
be honest.
I do not believe in being intel
lectual for its own sake; certainly
I do not believe in being intellec
tual for the purpose of making
Stanford great. I do not believe
in art for the sake of art. And
God forbid that anyone should
ever wear black socks and a pock
etbook Kierkegaard in order to
make Stanford more like Cam
bridge, Oxford, or Harvard.
' Thinking becomes worth while
when it relates to problems that
the thinker takes seriously, not
when the thinker is just mad
about thinking. There are a lot
of things that we should take seri
ously; let me suggest a few ex
amples:
1. In California there are 200,000
farm workers who do not have a
decent standard of living and who
do not have an opportunity to
attain one.
2. Your writer proposes that
Stanford "provide insight into the
value of knowledge in general,
the intrinsic values of the various
particular branches of knowledge,
and the value of each branch as it
is related to the others." But this
is .just what Stanford cannot pro
vide, because no one knows. What
is worth while? This is a signifi
cant question when you look di
rectly at it.
3. H-bombs.
4. Most of us are in favor of
such American ideals as private
property and free enterprise for
profit. Are we sure that these in
stitutions create the best of all
possible societies?
5. And are we sure that these
institutions stand a chance of last
ing into the 21st century?
The point is that before one
thinks, one should CAKE; and it
is not enough just to care about
thinking. Otherwise Stanford will
become merely another Harvard.
