# Masters of Our Creations

### 
In addition lo fostering the continued progress of research in its
divisions, SRl's planjs for tomorrow are aimed at "turning our at
tention more and more lo being masters of rather than servants to
our creal ions," as expressed by Director W. Finley Carter.

Further explaining, Carter pro
ceeded to cite the need for "under
standing the laws of human na
ture as in the past we developed
an understanding of the physical
laws of nature. Much of the same
logic and objectivity can be ap
plied to work witli human and
animate components."
Thus, SRI will devote, and is,
in fact, devoting additional atten
tion to the field of human beha
vior and understanding. The in
stitute is currently engaging in
research projects for the Ford
Foundation and the U.S. Depart
ment of State.
This growth will be understand
ably slow when considered in the
light of figures cited by Dr. Car
ter. "While the total Federal
budget for research and develop
ment in 1957 was $3 billion. $2.7
billion was for defense and only
$.3 billion was allotted for all of
the other departments. The State
Department budget was only
$350,000. Thus 5 per cent of the

cost of a single B-52 bomber was spent to research ourselves," Carter
stated.
Considering the world situation today in the light of his organi
zation's future aims, Carter concluded that "We have bought some
time by being strong physically. Now we should spend increasingly
more in an effort to understand people."
Growth Prospects for the Future
Growth prospects for SRI were next considered by Carter. "We
are more concerned with measuring growth in quality than in quan
tity." He further explained that SRI is necessarily having to be more
selective in choosing its projects so as not to reduce the high "level
of competence" which has been maintained and presumably will be
continued in the future.
Stanford Research Institute now finds itself on the threshold of
the future. For today's research is tomorrow's progress; yesterday's
research is past history today.
The increasing importance of applied research may be judged by
the growth of Stanford Research Institute in its 12-year history from
a one-man office in the Physics Corner of Quad to a world-wide or
ganization employing over 1500 persons, including approximately 175
persons holding Ph.D. degrees, 220 possessiong M.A.'s and 310 A.B.
or B.S. graduates.
In addition to the Menlo Park facilities. SRI has laboratories in
South Pasadena, offices in Washington, D.C., New York City, Port
land, Ore., Phoenix, and a European office in Zurich, Switzerland.
$20 [Million Budget Next Year
The 1959 SRI budget anticipates about $20 million of business,
consistent with the 10 per cent growth estimate by Carter and Stef
fens.
Thus the future apepars as bright as or brighter than the present
lor the Stanford Research Institute. Devoting its efforts and ener
gies to "fact-finding for decision-makers," and working "for the pub
lic good," in an "environment in which research can thrive," the
growth potential appears unlimted.
Stanford Research Institute Director E. Finley Carter added an
appropriate postscript to this series by considering the future of the
world as connected with the future efforts of SRI: "We must better
understand how to live together on earth rather than how to destroy
each other. . . . For where arc we going if we can't live better to
gether?"
