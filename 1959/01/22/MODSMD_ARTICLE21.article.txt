# Federal Aid for 'Loyal'
## 
### Jack Kinkier Associate Editor 
The Federal Government will
start handing oul money to uni
versities in February under the
National Defense Education Act
and Stanford may come in for a
handlul or two. But as always
seems the case when people are
giving away moneiy, there is a
string attached in this case, a
loyalty oath.
Some people, notably the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors, think the string is
bigger than the package itself.
The national headquarters of the
AAIJP has again voiced its oft
heard complaint against oaths of
any kind and is lobbying in Wash
ington to get the oath provision
stricken out of the act.
Locally, the Stanford chapter
of the AAUP, headed by Prof. Ar
thur Wright of the History De
partment, has taken no formal
stand on the issue, hut is making
sure that all those Stanford peo
ple who will administer the loans
are fully informed of what the
act will mean and particularly of
the AAUP's opposition to the
oaths. It considers these disclaim
ers an infringement on academic
freedom.
Oaths Invidious
"Oaths for any particular class
or occupation are invidious," says
Wright. "The government show
ers money on all kinds of people
of whom it does' not require
oaths. Do farmers sign an affi
davit to receive subsidies?"
He noted a letter sent to all Con
gressmen by the national AAIJP
office. "The Act seems to say to
members of the educational com
munity: 'You are an important
part of American life and you
have an admitted real need, but
let there be no mistake about the
fact that you are a particularly
suspect part of the population
and will have to pass'a special
test that other citizens need not
take.' "
Act Stipulations
The act itself says in Section
1001(f), Title X:
"No . . . funds . . . shall be
used to make payments or loans
to any individual unless such in
dividual (1) has executed and
filed with the Commissioner [of
Education] an affidavit that he
does not believe in, and is not a
member of and does not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches the overthrow of t'he
United States Government by
force'or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods. . . ."
It provides for loans at 3 per
cent interest to undergraduates,
fellowships for graduate students
and funds for expansion of cer
tain university programs, notably
in languages, over the nexl four
years.
Specific Objections
Two specific objections voiced
by the AAUP were mentioned by
Wright. The act provides for the
loyalty affidavits to be filed in
Washington. In practice they
may be subcontracted to state
governments or to the universi
ties themselves. In either case
Stanford would have to assume a
policing function on the truth of
these statements that Wright be
lieves is not the purpose of any
university.
If this happens Wright said he
will convene a Stanford chapter
meeting and the body will prob
ably pass a resolution formally
announcing its disapproval and
advising Stanford not to partici
pate in the plan. .
Professors Required
Secondly, he complains about
the requirement of oaths from

professor?: and instructors con
nected with the expansion pro
grams llie government is sponsor
ing.
Don't Argue
Supporters of the government's
plan might counter that it is giv
ing away money and is free to
attach any conditions it wants,
oidy to left-handed people if it
wanted. If anyone objects to the
conditions the proper course of
action would be simply not to
take the money rather than argue
about the provisions.
This is just what will happen
with Stanford students if the Uni
versity is chosen to receive some
of the money. Stanford has its
application in now and will hear
after Feb. 1.
Action Unlikely
"There is not much we can do
about the loyalty oath provision,"
says Director of Financial Aids
Robert P. Huff. "The Board of
Trustees has approved our par
ticipation in the act. Any student
who is against the oath may take
a normal University loan.
"There is no great difficulty.
I've never had any student balk
at the provision and it is nol un
common. It is in all Federal Aid
programs and the National Sci
ence Foundation scholarships
too."
A el's Ad van luge
The big advantage of the Act
is simply money. In the current
fiscal year California colleges and
universities will receive $571,669
in education aid and Stanford has
applied for a substantial chunk of
that. In a time of extreme finan
cial pressure for all colleges a
substantial subsidy for its schol
arship program is a temptation

hard to resist, loyalty oaths or
not.
In other colleges intellectuals
are raising storm.s over the issue,
but so far nobody is turning the
money down. Swarthmore's fac
ulty and Student Council both un
animously disapproved of the
oath requirement. At Harvard
the local AAUP voiced disapprov
al informally but on the record
they are waiting and watching.
At Columbia, however, nobody
had even read down to Section
1001(f),
Idealistic Attitude
Rut, as yet, nobody is refusing
to accept the money. It would
seem that in their freedom from
the financial responsibility for
their universities, the professors
get enraged in principle. But the
administrators, with budget defi
cits staring them in the face, have
taken the realistic attitude that
they need money badly and that
loyalty oaths aren't that ,bad if
the aid is big enough.

of the money. Stanford has its

Action Unlikely
"There is not much we can do
about the loyalty oath provision,"
says Director of Financial Aids
Robert P. Huff. "The Board of
Trustees has approved our par
ticipation in the act. Any student
who is against the oath may take
a normal University loan.
"There is no great difficulty.
I've never had any student balk
at the provision and it is nol un
common. It is in all Federal Aid
programs and the National Sci
ence Foundation scholarships
too."
A el's Ad van luge
The big advantage of the Act
is simply money. In the current
fiscal year California colleges and
universities will receive $571,669
in education aid and Stanford has
applied for a substantial chunk of
that. In a time of extreme finan
cial pressure for all colleges a
substantial subsidy for its schol
arship program is a temptation

hard to resist, loyalty oaths or
not.
In other colleges intellectuals
are raising storm.s over the issue,
but so far nobody is turning the
money down. Swarthmore's fac
ulty and Student Council both un
animously disapproved of the
oath requirement. At Harvard
the local AAUP voiced disapprov
al informally but on the record
they are waiting and watching.
At Columbia, however, nobody
had even read down to Section
1001(f),
Idealistic Attitude
Rut, as yet, nobody is refusing
to accept the money. It would
seem that in their freedom from
the financial responsibility for
their universities, the professors
get enraged in principle. But the
administrators, with budget defi
cits staring them in the face, have
taken the realistic attitude that
they need money badly and that
loyalty oaths aren't that ,bad if
the aid is big enough.
The Federal Government will
start handing oul money to uni
versities in February under the
National Defense Education Act
and Stanford may come in for a
handlul or two. But as always
seems the case when people are
giving away moneiy, there is a
string attached in this case, a
loyalty oath.
Some people, notably the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors, think the string is
bigger than the package itself.
The national headquarters of the
AAIJP has again voiced its oft
heard complaint against oaths of
any kind and is lobbying in Wash
ington to get the oath provision
stricken out of the act.
Locally, the Stanford chapter
of the AAUP, headed by Prof. Ar
thur Wright of the History De
partment, has taken no formal
stand on the issue, hut is making
sure that all those Stanford peo
ple who will administer the loans
are fully informed of what the
act will mean and particularly of
the AAUP's opposition to the
oaths. It considers these disclaim
ers an infringement on academic
freedom.
Oaths Invidious
"Oaths for any particular class
or occupation are invidious," says
Wright. "The government show
ers money on all kinds of people
of whom it does' not require
oaths. Do farmers sign an affi
davit to receive subsidies?"
He noted a letter sent to all Con
gressmen by the national AAIJP
office. "The Act seems to say to
members of the educational com
munity: 'You are an important
part of American life and you
have an admitted real need, but
let there be no mistake about the
fact that you are a particularly
suspect part of the population
and will have to pass'a special
test that other citizens need not
take.' "
Act Stipulations
The act itself says in Section
1001(f), Title X:
"No . . . funds . . . shall be
used to make payments or loans
to any individual unless such in
dividual (1) has executed and
filed with the Commissioner [of
Education] an affidavit that he
does not believe in, and is not a
member of and does not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches the overthrow of t'he
United States Government by
force'or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods. . . ."
It provides for loans at 3 per
cent interest to undergraduates,
fellowships for graduate students
and funds for expansion of cer
tain university programs, notably
in languages, over the nexl four
years.
Specific Objections
Two specific objections voiced
by the AAUP were mentioned by
Wright. The act provides for the
loyalty affidavits to be filed in
Washington. In practice they
may be subcontracted to state
governments or to the universi
ties themselves. In either case
Stanford would have to assume a
policing function on the truth of
these statements that Wright be
lieves is not the purpose of any
university.
If this happens Wright said he
will convene a Stanford chapter
meeting and the body will prob
ably pass a resolution formally
announcing its disapproval and
advising Stanford not to partici
pate in the plan. .
Professors Required
Secondly, he complains about
the requirement of oaths from

professor?: and instructors con
nected with the expansion pro
grams llie government is sponsor
ing.
Don't Argue
Supporters of the government's
plan might counter that it is giv
ing away money and is free to
attach any conditions it wants,
oidy to left-handed people if it
wanted. If anyone objects to the
conditions the proper course of
action would be simply not to
take the money rather than argue
about the provisions.

test that other citizens need not
take.' "
Act Stipulations
The act itself says in Section
1001(f), Title X:
"No . . . funds . . . shall be
used to make payments or loans
to any individual unless such in
dividual (1) has executed and
filed with the Commissioner [of
Education] an affidavit that he
does not believe in, and is not a
member of and does not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches the overthrow of t'he
United States Government by
force'or violence or by any illegal
or unconstitutional methods. . . ."
It provides for loans at 3 per
cent interest to undergraduates,
fellowships for graduate students
and funds for expansion of cer
tain university programs, notably
in languages, over the nexl four
years.
Specific Objections
Two specific objections voiced
by the AAUP were mentioned by
Wright. The act provides for the
loyalty affidavits to be filed in
Washington. In practice they
may be subcontracted to state
governments or to the universi
ties themselves. In either case
Stanford would have to assume a
policing function on the truth of
these statements that Wright be
lieves is not the purpose of any
university.
If this happens Wright said he
will convene a Stanford chapter
meeting and the body will prob
ably pass a resolution formally
announcing its disapproval and
advising Stanford not to partici
pate in the plan. .
Professors Required
Secondly, he complains about
the requirement of oaths from

professor?: and instructors con
nected with the expansion pro
grams llie government is sponsor
ing.
Don't Argue
Supporters of the government's
plan might counter that it is giv
ing away money and is free to
attach any conditions it wants,
oidy to left-handed people if it
wanted. If anyone objects to the
conditions the proper course of
action would be simply not to
take the money rather than argue
about the provisions.
This is just what will happen
with Stanford students if the Uni
versity is chosen to receive some
of the money. Stanford has its
application in now and will hear
after Feb. 1.
Action Unlikely
"There is not much we can do
about the loyalty oath provision,"
says Director of Financial Aids
Robert P. Huff. "The Board of
Trustees has approved our par
ticipation in the act. Any student
who is against the oath may take
a normal University loan.
"There is no great difficulty.
I've never had any student balk
at the provision and it is nol un
common. It is in all Federal Aid
programs and the National Sci
ence Foundation scholarships
too."
A el's Ad van luge
The big advantage of the Act
is simply money. In the current
fiscal year California colleges and
universities will receive $571,669
in education aid and Stanford has
applied for a substantial chunk of
that. In a time of extreme finan
cial pressure for all colleges a
substantial subsidy for its schol
arship program is a temptation

hard to resist, loyalty oaths or
not.
In other colleges intellectuals
are raising storm.s over the issue,
but so far nobody is turning the
money down. Swarthmore's fac
ulty and Student Council both un
animously disapproved of the
oath requirement. At Harvard
the local AAUP voiced disapprov
al informally but on the record
they are waiting and watching.
At Columbia, however, nobody
had even read down to Section
1001(f),
Idealistic Attitude
Rut, as yet, nobody is refusing
to accept the money. It would
seem that in their freedom from
the financial responsibility for
their universities, the professors
get enraged in principle. But the
administrators, with budget defi
cits staring them in the face, have
taken the realistic attitude that
they need money badly and that
loyalty oaths aren't that ,bad if
the aid is big enough.
The Federal Government will
start handing oul money to uni
versities in February under the
National Defense Education Act
and Stanford may come in for a
handlul or two. But as always
seems the case when people are
giving away moneiy, there is a
string attached in this case, a
loyalty oath.
Some people, notably the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors, think the string is
bigger than the package itself.
The national headquarters of the
AAIJP has again voiced its oft
heard complaint against oaths of
any kind and is lobbying in Wash
ington to get the oath provision
stricken out of the act.
Locally, the Stanford chapter
of the AAUP, headed by Prof. Ar
thur Wright of the History De
partment, has taken no formal
stand on the issue, hut is making
sure that all those Stanford peo
ple who will administer the loans
are fully informed of what the
act will mean and particularly of
the AAUP's opposition to the
oaths. It considers these disclaim
ers an infringement on academic
freedom.
Oaths Invidious
"Oaths for any particular class
or occupation are invidious," says
Wright. "The government show
ers money on all kinds of people
of whom it does' not require
oaths. Do farmers sign an affi
davit to receive subsidies?"
He noted a letter sent to all Con
gressmen by the national AAIJP
office. "The Act seems to say to
members of the educational com
munity: 'You are an important
part of American life and you
have an admitted real need, but
let there be no mistake about the
fact that you are a particularly
