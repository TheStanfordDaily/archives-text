# Cards Host COP In Saturday Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team, and
fans, will get a look at two of the
outstanding individual stars in
N or th e r n California Saturday
night when the College of the Pa
cific Tigers invade the Pavilion.
The game will be the last non
conference outing of the season
for the Tribe, with nine more all
important ''counters" left on the
schedule.
COP, playing its toughest
schedule in history, has posted a
7-8 record so far, yet boasts two
stars among the national leaders.
This season the Tigers have al
ready had brushes with such pow
ers as Cincinnati, Seattle, Illinois
and Purdue, in addition to rack
ing lip a 2-1 mark in the tough
West Coast Conference.
Leßoy Wright, a 6-8 rebound
ing sensation ;it center, is the big
man in the Tiger picture. Wright
was selected to the all-conference
team last season as a sophomore
- only the third lime in history
that a yearling has made the WC
AC learn. The other sophs were
Bill Russell and Ken Sears, now
pro all-stars.
Top Rebounder
Wright • currently leads the na
tion in the rebounding depart
ment. In 15 games he has pulled
away 359 rebounds, an average
of 21 a game, and has recovered
22.7 per cent of all the rebounds
in COP games.
In addition, he has averaged
15.8 points a game.
But when it comes to fire-power
on the atack, little (5-10) Dave
KUu man is the big gun of the
Tigers. Klurman is the nation's
12th leading scorer with an aver
age of 23 markers a game. I lis
WCAC record is 73 points in three
games for a 24.3 mark.
Klurman comes to the Stockton
school all the way from Irving
ton, N.J. Teaming with him in
the backcourt is another Eastern
er, 5-11 Gary Kaufman of Brook
lyn. Kaufman is also a consistent
double-figures scorer and threw
in 2-1 markers, for high honors, as
the Tigers dumped San Jose State
last week.
Important Cogs
Important cogs up front in
coach Van Sweet's attack are Lar
kin Bryant, Don Cock burn and
Maurice Jones.
An individual scoring and de
fensive duel looms in the back
court between Klurman and Stan
ford's Paul Neumann. In Wright,
however, the Indians are up
against possibly the best rebound
er they will face this season; and
Stanford brings up the rear in the
Pacific Coast Conference rebound
ing statistics.

tion of the nation. A junior, Wright stands 6-8 and is leading the

ing average of 21 per game, lie pulls in nearly one-tilth ot all I iger
