Chris Plain, 2'lB-pound Stanford tackle, was drafted by the Chicago
Bears yesterday in the 19th round of the National Football League's
annual draft.
Meanwhile, the"Washington" Redskins picked up California's All-
Ameriean quarterback, Joe Kapp. Kapp, who was reportedly irked

over not being sclented during the
NFL's first four rounds last Dec
1, was picked in the 18th go-round
by the Redskins.
Plain and Kapp were the only
members of their teams chosen
in the draft's first 20 rounds.
Plain, a senior from Arlington,
Va., was the Indians' third tackle
this season and developed into a
defensive stalwart during the sec
ond hall' of the campaign.
As master of Cal's ground
minded Split-T attack, Kapp was
felt by many observers to be an
inadequate passer for the pro
game-. With the Redskins, he will
have to battle two established sig
nal-callers in Eddie Leßaron, for
mer College of Pacific star, and
Notre Dame's Ralph Guglielmi.
