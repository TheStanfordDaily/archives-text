# $77 BILLION
## Ike Explains Criticism of New Budget 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” President
Eisenhower diagnosed Democrat
ic criticism of his $77 billion budg
et Wednesday as a case of "budg
etary schizophrenia."
Eisenhower told a news confer
ence some call the budget 100 big,
others complain it is too small
"they are on all sides of it."
Schizophrenia is a mental disor
der popularly called split person
ality.
On this and several other topics
woven into the session with news
men, Eisenhower was inclined lo
be more positive than usual.
He said he thinks there is one
thing of which Soviet Deputy
Premier Anastas I. Mikoyan must
be sure as a result of his visit to
this country:
We Want Peace
"That America wants peace,, is
ready to conciliate, it is ready to
match reasonableness with rea
sonableness, but it simply won't
be pushed around. And I believe
he will understand that the Amer
ican people believe that, just as
much as does any official of the
government."
As for proposals in Congress
to repeal the constitutional
amendment banning a third term
for a President, Eisenhower of
fered an opinion that "I would
rather see it repealed that be
kept." The chief executive re
peatedly has questioned the wis
dom of the ban, but with no sug
gestion that he would like a third
term himself.
Ike Firm
Eisenhower was firm on anoth
er point, too. He said he has in
mind no economic controls to be
applied to inflationary pressures,
"because I despise them." Con
trols lead to more controls, "just
like using morphine," he said,
and make a truly free economy
impossible.
Still the President didn't back
of from the position he took in his
economic message to Congress
Tuesday that to check inflation
the nation must accept cither self
discipline or federal controls.
Lacking self-discipline, he said,
"something will have to be done"
against mounting inflation. But
he didn't spell out what.
