# No foreign Concessions Vows Castro
## 
### 
HAVANA (/Pi Fidel Castro
told a wildly cheering crowd of
about a million Cubans Wednes
day that Ihe new regime will re
vise or wipe out burdensome for
eign concessions granted to the
fallen Batista dictatorship.
He was given a 10-minute ova
lion and was interrupted fre
quency by more cheering as he
began speaking. His first words
were: "The one million who are
here can see that all Cuba backs
revolutionary justice."
On foreign concessions, he said:
"Cuba will ask a revision and
nullification of onerous conces
sions given foreign enterprises
by the government of Batista?"
His reference to foreign conces
sions obviously embraced some
run by Americans, who have one
billion dollars invested in Cuba.
But he did not mention any spe
cific 'country.
He drew even louder cheers
when he said: "We now here are
going to demand that the govern
ment ask the U.S. government to
return the Cuban war criminals."
Emphasizing the key point for
the rally, Castro gestured dra
matically and said:
"All those who demand that
gunmen be punished raise their
hands."
A great roar and waving of
hands followed."
"There!" Castro responded.
"One million Cubans of all ideals
and classes have voted as the
jury." Cuba's entire population
is estimated at slightly under six
million.
