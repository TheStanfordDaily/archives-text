Space Technology Laboratories is responsible for the
technical management of the USAF Ballistic Missile
Program and Space Probes. In addition special scientific
laboratories are now engaged in the exploitation of highly
sophisticated space studies leading to new space vehicles and
communication systems.
To assure continued growth in our capabilities for scientific
advances in these areas we must secure those who have
outstanding potentials to grow in their chosen technical
fields. Opportunities are available for those receiving their
MS or PhD degrees in the near future in the following areas:
