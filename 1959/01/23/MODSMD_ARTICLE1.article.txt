# LASSU Holds Longest Meet
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
In its longest meeting of the
year, a marathon discussion
which lasted almost four hours,
Legislature received and debated
the investigating committee re
ports on Cardinals and Rally Com
and Fundamental Standard Com
mission last night at Bowman
Alumni House.
It also appropriated $200 to in
crease the book allowance for
each foreign scholar from $15 to
$25 a quarter, approved the Folk
Music Club Constitution and gave
a vote of confidence to ASSU Fi
nancial Manager Larry Kelley for
his stand in refusal to pay unau
thorized salaries to musicians on
Hie recent Ram's Head tour in
Los Angeles.
The first report on Fun Stan
Com by representatives Cindy
Allen and John Nickerson noted
the commission's dual role as an
educational body to inform stu
dents of the meaning of the Hon
or Code and Fundamental Stand
ard and as an interpretative body
on these two codes.
Decrease Size
Their suggestion to decrease
the body's membership from 15
to 10 and include two representa
tives from Judicial Council as
voting members was well re
ceived by all.
A long discussion then ensued
on the power structure between
Fun Stan and Judicial Council.
Fun Stan Chairman Ron Sikes
noted that its recommendations
had no authority over Judicial
Council and that in fact interpre
tations often came after Judicial
Council had made its ruling.
ASSU President John Bohn
suggested making Fun Stan a ju
dicial committee of Legislature
and thereby increasing its author
ity over the Judicial Council. Kel
ley noted, however, that this
would be defeating the intention
of the Constitution in setting up
Judicial Council as a check on
Legislature and the ASSU presi
dent, analogous to the Supreme
Court in the federal government.
Finally, Miss Allen, Nickerson
and Sikes were delegated to work
out suggestions for strengthen
ing Fun Stan's position as an in
terpretative body.
Ineffective Communication
Wilbur Representative Bob
Burnett spoke for the committee
which investigated Cardinals and
Rally Com. Characterizing him
self as an idealist and possibly
representative of the minority
opinion, Burnett noted ineffective
communication between the two
bodies and a "traditional" ap

proach to spirit activities while
changing student attitudes neces
sitated new ideas.
He suggested re-evaluation of
Cardinals programs, preliminary
reports outlining future activities
of both groups, removal of the
Hostel program from Cardinals'
responsibilities, and most impor
tant that Legislature take a
more active role in regulating the
activities of both these bodies.
Mure Meetings
The abstract nature of his ar
guments indicated a need for
more discussion and specific pro
posals. The investigating com
mittee will meet again this week.
LASSU then began an hour
and -a - half - long discussion of
whether the ASSU should assume
responsibility for payment of $30
in salaries to two musicians at
the Ram's Head Revue, paid with
out proper authorization by Mu
sical Director Chuck Tidd.
After first considering taking
the money out of Tidd's salary,
Legislature finally just voted con
fidence in Kelley's refusal to pay
money which had not properly
been contracted. For this, at 10
minutes of 11, Kelley muttered a
humble, "Thanks, gang."
Next week's Legislature meet
ing will be a special oneâ€”Presi
dent Sterling fulfilling his prom
ise to appear at the group's re
quest. It will be held at 4:15 p.m.
next Thursday, but will be closed
to the public.
