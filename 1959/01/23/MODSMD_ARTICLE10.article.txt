# Trustee Aim: Campus Residences -- if Wanted
## 
### Lynn DeLargey 
Dean of Men William G. Craig
said Thursday night that trustees
are concerned to keep Stanford a
residence university, with room
for all students to live on campus.
Speaking in the third series of

weekly Stanford Today and To
morrow discussions, Craig said in
answer to questions, "I like our
present policy" which allows men
to choose where to live. "Last
year we accomplished a mile
stone" in providing enough room
for all sophomores to live on cam
pus. Most sophomores choose to
live on campus, he said, although
(here has been an interest ex
pressed recently that students
don't want this."
In response to a question on the
possible effects of proposed ef
forts to integrate classes and pro
vide for continuance in women's
residences, Craig said, "I don't
see that this makes sororities."
Change Is Slow
Asked why the University has
not moved to cut down on mid
terms and institute comprehen
sive examinations, Craig replied,
"Changes come very slowly in
this kind of institution. . . The ad
ministration has to be very care
ful about legislating on academic
matters."
"The administration can devel
op information on this problem
and pass it along to professors,"
but changes are usually depart
mental policy, Craig said.
Craig said that the market val
ue of Stanford's endowment in
vestments is now about $94 mil
lion. The income from endow
ment pays about 19 per cent of
total University expenditures.
Salaries Low
In stressing Ihe need for more
money, Craig said, "Faculty sala
ries are way out of joint with the
rest of the world." One source
of the hoped-for income will be

alumni donations. "Alumni have
not been wooed" to give in years
past, but his present listeners cer
tainly would be, he said.
A student complained that the
division of the University's book
collection into departmental libra
ries was inconvenient. Craig re
plied that Ihe purpose of the divi
sion is to put books where they
are most accessible to their users.
Any subsequent deficiencies in a
library would have to be remedied
by getting "duplicate material."
