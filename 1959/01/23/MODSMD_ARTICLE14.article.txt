# Freshmen Saved From Cinch Slips
## 
### 
Stanford freshmen claimed a
big advantage over upperclass
men autumn quarterâ€”their par
ents didn't hear about those mid
quarter D's and F's.
A new University policy called
for withholding cinch notices
from frosh parents. Normally,
copies of the so-called "pink val
entines" are sent to parents of
students receiving two or more at
mid-quarter report time.
A recommendation from Dean
of Men William Craig's office to
the committee on registration and
academic standards noted that
parents of first-quarter students
are sometimes so alarmed at re
ceiving the notices that pressure
they bring to bear on sons or
daughters hinders, rather than
helps, academic progress.
Registrar Harvey Hall said no
mid quarter progress report of
any kind was sent home "except
'ms the director of the residence
felt desirable. When a particular
problem existed, it was treated
as such, with an explanatory let
ter rather than routine form."
The new policy, however, will
not be in effect winter or spring
quarters. Parents of freshmen
then will receive notice of scholas
tic deficiency whenever a student
falls into probationary status.
Hall said that the entire policy
of sending notification to parents
will probably he further explored.
Craig noted, however, that it is
not the kind of thing which would
lend itself to any kind of compar
ative study of last fall quarter
and previous ones.
Presumably, too many other
uncontrollable variables exist to
make a valid comparison possible.
