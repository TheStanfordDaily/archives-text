# 'Temporary Roof' -- 53 Years
## 
### Marilyn Moore 
There's something missing on
Inner Quad. It's been missing, in
fact, since the 1900 earthquake,
and it has never been returned or
replaced.
That "something" is the top of
the Memorial Church, the tower,
spire or 1 dome which would finish
the church building and complete
the architecture of the Quad. The
present square, squatty top lacks
beauty and dominance, as well as
causing inconvenience and dis
comfort inside the church.
There appears to be no definite
reason why the building was not
finished irr 1906, though several
explanations are possible.
Mrs. Stanford's Wishes
The possibility of a reaction
against construction was suggest
ed by Zach Stewart ,i Planning Of
fice staff assistant. Before her
deaih in 1906, Mrs. Jane Stanford
placed emphasis on University
buildings, apparently believing
that the University would best op
erate with numerous and ade
quate facilities. President David
Starr Jordan wanted, on the oth
er hand, the available funds used
to secure more professors, and
perhaps his desires predominated
after Mrs. Stanford's death.
A second possibility is lack of
money, and a third is lack of
agreement as to style.
When the restoration of the
church took place after the earth
quake, it was generally agreed
that the collapse of the tower had
ruined the building, and therefore
it would be esserrtial to replace
it with a steel frame. But a few
people questioned the reconstruc
tion of the exact structure, favor
ing the selection of a new and
perhaps more ornate design.
Temporary Roof
Alternative styles were submit
ted by architects but, as there
was a debate over what type of
design to adopt, a "temporary"
shingle roof was put on. This
"temporary" roof has been on for
53 years, and is the only roof on
the Quad which is not tile.
Discussion continued over the
church's unfinished state, and the
division as to the style of tower
or spire remained.
In December, 1908, the picture
of the or iginal church appeared
in the "Stanford Alumnus" with
the caption, "As It Was in the
Beginning, Is Not, and Ever
Should Be." Also with the picture
was the line, "IF there is to be
any radical change, by all means
let us have two mission towers
at the front of the building."
Popular Design
The most popular design at that
time featured a square base with
statues in niches and a 14-sided
dome with stained glass windows
(see* above). A picture of this
sketch by architects Meyers and
Ward was also featured in the
"Stanford Alumnus" of Decern
ber, 1908, with the following
statement:
"This is the design which has
been submitted to the Trustees
for the reconstruction of the Me
morial Church. It will arouse vig
orous protest, surely, from all
Stanford people to whom the
clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and senti
ment. For these features, this
design substitutes more of the
white figures against a back
ground of yell o w sandstone,
which to many eyes are like the
'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small win
flows is thus left at the top of the
tower.
"This change must be based en

tirely upon aesthetic considera
tions, since the commission of ar
chitects and engineers recom
mended the reconstruction of the
tower upon its original lines, with
the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more
in harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than
are the lines of Richardson's
Trinity Church may be debatable,
but there should be no uncertain
ty as to the necessily for the
clock and its quarter-hourly mu
sic."
Whether the Trustees ever ap
proved the plans is unknown, but
the Meyers and Ward plans went
no further, and the top remained
plain and boxlike.
Clock, Bells
The clock and bells of the
church, miraculously not dam
aged, were then placed "tempora
rily" in the clock tower, a struc
ture which is now falling apart,
according to Director of Planning
Eldridge T. Spencer.
Inconvenience and discomfort
have long resulted from the in
completion of the church, as the
poor fit of the roof caused by the
angle of pitch permits cold drafts
and the occasional entrance of
birds into the church.
Squatter's Rights
Around 1928 an owl made its
nest in the dome and proceeded
to select a place right over the
president's pew as its favorite
spot. Besides causing a pile of
dust to build up daily in the pew,
the bird began to tear out the
acoustical insulation and gener
ally to bother the chaplain, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner. The
Corporation Yard was called and,
after a mad chase, the owl was
killed by the only shot ever fired
in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv
ice a few years ago.
"I had visions of it appearing
and flying above the congrega
tion just as the preacher' began
the address," Chaplain Minto
smiles. "But just as the service
was beginning and we were pro
ceeding up the aisle, an usher
came to me with the bird in his
hand."
Though there was always talk
about completing the church, af

ter 1907 nothing concrete was
done until December, 1942, when
a Restoration Fund fur the Me
morial Church Spire was created.
Carl Breer was the first donor,
and his purpose was, in the exact
words, "to establish a fund to be
used for rebuilding the memorial
arch and restoring the church
spire. The restoration work is to
take place at some time after 1 the
conclusion of World War II."
Additional Contributions
In 1943 Mrs. Katherine Ryan
added $100 to the Spire Fund and
Orton C. Woodhead, $10. Since
then Brig. Gen. Philip R. Faymon
ville has contributed $250, and
Mr. and Mrs. Preston C. Burchard
added $1. These sums, together
with the compounded interest,
now give a total of $10,708.03 in
the fund at the present time.
A possible additional contribu
tion may be received from the
will of Joseph Lynn Choate, who
wanted some of his money to be
put towar d a "campanile, a dome,
or some substitute for the steeple
on the Church." A legal question
exists, however, as it is uncertain
whether the will amends a trust
previously made.
Lack of Funds
But $10,000 is only a beginning,
and this lack of funds is the pri
mary reason that nothing further
has been done about a spire,
tower or dome.
Planning Director Eldridge T.
Spencer estimates the cost of a
new spire al about $500,000.
"There is great difficulty build
ing in masonry," he stated. "It
would have to be steel covered

with imitation stone, and that
doesn't weather realistically. We
would also have to change the
footings."
"Doesn't Add"
Spencer felt that the architect's
sketch of 1908 "doesn't add." "I
think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture
should be kept simple, he said,
one example being the 14th cen
tury European Gothic cathedrals
in which birds now live in the
rafters.
Student Pressure
Spencer emphasized, however,
that the Planning Office operates
from student pressure, and that
if students desired a new tower or
spire it would be seriously consid
ered.
Planning Office decisions, how
ever, are based upon need and
available funds. No definite
plans are made without money,
tures and building methods might

change between the time the
stated Zach Stewart, as strue
plans are completed and the time
work may actually begin.
Need Not Pressing
In spite of a large file of corre
spondence between President
Sterling, Chaplain Minto and ar
chitects of the Planning Office
concerning the church tower or
spire, no specific designs have
ever been made because no mon
ey is available and because the
need is not pressing. Top priority
is now being given the Medical
Center and the Student Union,
Stewart said.
Even now, there is still a divi
sion over style. The most recenl
suggestion was made by Chaplain
Minto, who would like a separate
campanile next to the church
which would house Ihe bells and
possibly have a small chapel in
its base. The University had a
chapel on Inner Quad prior to
1906, but following the earth
quake it became an office build
ing, is now Dean VVinbigler's of
fice.
Status Quo
And so it appears that the
church will remain as it is, with
its leaky "candlesnuffer" top in
stead of a tall spire or tower or
graceful dome, at least until
enough alumni desire to improve
it. It seems that the building
which should be dominant from
its location on the exact axis of
the University will continue to be
subordinate to Hoover Tower. It
appears that the "heart and cen
ter of the University," as stated
by Jane Lathrop Stanford in the
Founding Ideal, will be forced to
continue to wear a most unglori
ous crown.

time featured a square base with
statues in niches and a 14-sided
dome with stained glass windows
(see* above). A picture of this
sketch by architects Meyers and
Ward was also featured in the
"Stanford Alumnus" of Decern
ber, 1908, with the following
statement:
"This is the design which has
been submitted to the Trustees
for the reconstruction of the Me
morial Church. It will arouse vig
orous protest, surely, from all
Stanford people to whom the
clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and senti
ment. For these features, this
design substitutes more of the
white figures against a back
ground of yell o w sandstone,
which to many eyes are like the
'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small win
flows is thus left at the top of the
tower.
"This change must be based en

tirely upon aesthetic considera
tions, since the commission of ar
chitects and engineers recom
mended the reconstruction of the
tower upon its original lines, with
the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more
in harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than
are the lines of Richardson's
Trinity Church may be debatable,
but there should be no uncertain
ty as to the necessily for the
clock and its quarter-hourly mu
sic."
Whether the Trustees ever ap
proved the plans is unknown, but
the Meyers and Ward plans went
no further, and the top remained
plain and boxlike.
Clock, Bells
The clock and bells of the
church, miraculously not dam
aged, were then placed "tempora
rily" in the clock tower, a struc
ture which is now falling apart,
according to Director of Planning
Eldridge T. Spencer.
Inconvenience and discomfort
have long resulted from the in
completion of the church, as the
poor fit of the roof caused by the
angle of pitch permits cold drafts
and the occasional entrance of
birds into the church.
Squatter's Rights
Around 1928 an owl made its
nest in the dome and proceeded
to select a place right over the
president's pew as its favorite
spot. Besides causing a pile of
dust to build up daily in the pew,
the bird began to tear out the
acoustical insulation and gener
ally to bother the chaplain, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner. The
Corporation Yard was called and,
after a mad chase, the owl was
killed by the only shot ever fired
in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv
ice a few years ago.
"I had visions of it appearing
and flying above the congrega
tion just as the preacher' began
the address," Chaplain Minto
smiles. "But just as the service
was beginning and we were pro
ceeding up the aisle, an usher
came to me with the bird in his
hand."
Though there was always talk
about completing the church, af

ter 1907 nothing concrete was
done until December, 1942, when
a Restoration Fund fur the Me
morial Church Spire was created.
Carl Breer was the first donor,
and his purpose was, in the exact
words, "to establish a fund to be
used for rebuilding the memorial
arch and restoring the church
spire. The restoration work is to
take place at some time after 1 the
conclusion of World War II."
Additional Contributions
In 1943 Mrs. Katherine Ryan
added $100 to the Spire Fund and
Orton C. Woodhead, $10. Since
then Brig. Gen. Philip R. Faymon
ville has contributed $250, and
Mr. and Mrs. Preston C. Burchard
added $1. These sums, together
with the compounded interest,
now give a total of $10,708.03 in
the fund at the present time.
A possible additional contribu
tion may be received from the
will of Joseph Lynn Choate, who
wanted some of his money to be
put towar d a "campanile, a dome,
or some substitute for the steeple
on the Church." A legal question
exists, however, as it is uncertain
whether the will amends a trust
previously made.
Lack of Funds
But $10,000 is only a beginning,
and this lack of funds is the pri
mary reason that nothing further
has been done about a spire,
tower or dome.
Planning Director Eldridge T.
Spencer estimates the cost of a
new spire al about $500,000.
"There is great difficulty build
ing in masonry," he stated. "It
would have to be steel covered

with imitation stone, and that
doesn't weather realistically. We
would also have to change the
footings."
"Doesn't Add"
Spencer felt that the architect's
sketch of 1908 "doesn't add." "I
think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture
should be kept simple, he said,
one example being the 14th cen
tury European Gothic cathedrals
in which birds now live in the
rafters.
Student Pressure
Spencer emphasized, however,
that the Planning Office operates
from student pressure, and that
if students desired a new tower or
spire it would be seriously consid
ered.
Planning Office decisions, how
ever, are based upon need and
available funds. No definite
plans are made without money,
tures and building methods might

change between the time the
stated Zach Stewart, as strue
plans are completed and the time
work may actually begin.
Need Not Pressing
In spite of a large file of corre
spondence between President
Sterling, Chaplain Minto and ar
chitects of the Planning Office
concerning the church tower or
spire, no specific designs have
ever been made because no mon
ey is available and because the
need is not pressing. Top priority
is now being given the Medical
Center and the Student Union,
Stewart said.
Even now, there is still a divi
sion over style. The most recenl
suggestion was made by Chaplain
Minto, who would like a separate
campanile next to the church
which would house Ihe bells and
possibly have a small chapel in
its base. The University had a
chapel on Inner Quad prior to
1906, but following the earth
quake it became an office build
ing, is now Dean VVinbigler's of
fice.
Status Quo
And so it appears that the
church will remain as it is, with
its leaky "candlesnuffer" top in
stead of a tall spire or tower or
graceful dome, at least until
enough alumni desire to improve
it. It seems that the building
which should be dominant from
its location on the exact axis of
the University will continue to be
subordinate to Hoover Tower. It
appears that the "heart and cen
ter of the University," as stated
by Jane Lathrop Stanford in the
Founding Ideal, will be forced to
continue to wear a most unglori
ous crown.



MEMORIAL CHURCH: "THE HEART AND CENTER OF THE UNIVERSITY"
Top left, before the earthquake of 19(K>; top right, architect's sketch done in 1908; bottom, today

There's something missing on
Inner Quad. It's been missing, in
fact, since the 1900 earthquake,
and it has never been returned or
replaced.
That "something" is the top of
the Memorial Church, the tower,
spire or 1 dome which would finish
the church building and complete
the architecture of the Quad. The
present square, squatty top lacks
beauty and dominance, as well as
causing inconvenience and dis
comfort inside the church.
There appears to be no definite
reason why the building was not
finished irr 1906, though several
explanations are possible.
Mrs. Stanford's Wishes
The possibility of a reaction
against construction was suggest
ed by Zach Stewart ,i Planning Of
fice staff assistant. Before her
deaih in 1906, Mrs. Jane Stanford
placed emphasis on University
buildings, apparently believing
that the University would best op
erate with numerous and ade
quate facilities. President David
Starr Jordan wanted, on the oth
er hand, the available funds used
to secure more professors, and
perhaps his desires predominated
after Mrs. Stanford's death.
A second possibility is lack of
money, and a third is lack of
agreement as to style.
When the restoration of the
church took place after the earth
quake, it was generally agreed
that the collapse of the tower had
ruined the building, and therefore
it would be esserrtial to replace
it with a steel frame. But a few
people questioned the reconstruc
tion of the exact structure, favor
ing the selection of a new and
perhaps more ornate design.
Temporary Roof
Alternative styles were submit
ted by architects but, as there
was a debate over what type of
design to adopt, a "temporary"
shingle roof was put on. This
"temporary" roof has been on for
53 years, and is the only roof on
the Quad which is not tile.
Discussion continued over the
church's unfinished state, and the
division as to the style of tower
or spire remained.
In December, 1908, the picture
of the or iginal church appeared
in the "Stanford Alumnus" with
the caption, "As It Was in the
Beginning, Is Not, and Ever
Should Be." Also with the picture
was the line, "IF there is to be
any radical change, by all means
let us have two mission towers
at the front of the building."

The most popular design at that
time featured a square base with

in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv
ice a few years ago.
"I had visions of it appearing
and flying above the congrega
tion just as the preacher' began
the address," Chaplain Minto
smiles. "But just as the service
was beginning and we were pro
ceeding up the aisle, an usher
came to me with the bird in his
hand."
Though there was always talk
about completing the church, af

ter 1907 nothing concrete was
done until December, 1942, when
a Restoration Fund fur the Me
morial Church Spire was created.
Carl Breer was the first donor,
and his purpose was, in the exact
words, "to establish a fund to be
used for rebuilding the memorial
arch and restoring the church
spire. The restoration work is to
take place at some time after 1 the
conclusion of World War II."
Additional Contributions
In 1943 Mrs. Katherine Ryan
added $100 to the Spire Fund and
Orton C. Woodhead, $10. Since
then Brig. Gen. Philip R. Faymon
ville has contributed $250, and
Mr. and Mrs. Preston C. Burchard
added $1. These sums, together
with the compounded interest,
now give a total of $10,708.03 in
the fund at the present time.
A possible additional contribu
tion may be received from the
will of Joseph Lynn Choate, who
wanted some of his money to be
put towar d a "campanile, a dome,
or some substitute for the steeple
on the Church." A legal question
exists, however, as it is uncertain
whether the will amends a trust
previously made.
Lack of Funds
But $10,000 is only a beginning,
and this lack of funds is the pri
mary reason that nothing further
has been done about a spire,
tower or dome.
Planning Director Eldridge T.
Spencer estimates the cost of a
new spire al about $500,000.
"There is great difficulty build
ing in masonry," he stated. "It
would have to be steel covered

with imitation stone, and that
doesn't weather realistically. We
would also have to change the
footings."
"Doesn't Add"
Spencer felt that the architect's
sketch of 1908 "doesn't add." "I
think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture
should be kept simple, he said,
one example being the 14th cen
tury European Gothic cathedrals
in which birds now live in the
rafters.
Student Pressure
Spencer emphasized, however,
that the Planning Office operates
from student pressure, and that
if students desired a new tower or
spire it would be seriously consid
ered.
Planning Office decisions, how
ever, are based upon need and
available funds. No definite
plans are made without money,
tures and building methods might

change between the time the
stated Zach Stewart, as strue
plans are completed and the time
work may actually begin.
Need Not Pressing
In spite of a large file of corre
spondence between President
Sterling, Chaplain Minto and ar
chitects of the Planning Office
concerning the church tower or
spire, no specific designs have
ever been made because no mon
ey is available and because the
need is not pressing. Top priority
is now being given the Medical
Center and the Student Union,
Stewart said.
Even now, there is still a divi
sion over style. The most recenl
suggestion was made by Chaplain
Minto, who would like a separate
campanile next to the church
which would house Ihe bells and
possibly have a small chapel in
its base. The University had a
chapel on Inner Quad prior to
1906, but following the earth
quake it became an office build
ing, is now Dean VVinbigler's of
fice.
Status Quo
And so it appears that the
church will remain as it is, with
its leaky "candlesnuffer" top in
stead of a tall spire or tower or
graceful dome, at least until
enough alumni desire to improve
it. It seems that the building
which should be dominant from
its location on the exact axis of
the University will continue to be
subordinate to Hoover Tower. It
appears that the "heart and cen
ter of the University," as stated
by Jane Lathrop Stanford in the
Founding Ideal, will be forced to
continue to wear a most unglori
ous crown.



MEMORIAL CHURCH: "THE HEART AND CENTER OF THE UNIVERSITY"
Top left, before the earthquake of 19(K>; top right, architect's sketch done in 1908; bottom, today

There's something missing on
Inner Quad. It's been missing, in
fact, since the 1900 earthquake,
and it has never been returned or
replaced.
That "something" is the top of
the Memorial Church, the tower,
spire or 1 dome which would finish
the church building and complete
the architecture of the Quad. The
present square, squatty top lacks
beauty and dominance, as well as
causing inconvenience and dis
comfort inside the church.
There appears to be no definite
reason why the building was not
finished irr 1906, though several
explanations are possible.
Mrs. Stanford's Wishes
The possibility of a reaction
against construction was suggest
ed by Zach Stewart ,i Planning Of
fice staff assistant. Before her
deaih in 1906, Mrs. Jane Stanford
placed emphasis on University
buildings, apparently believing
that the University would best op
erate with numerous and ade
quate facilities. President David
Starr Jordan wanted, on the oth
er hand, the available funds used
to secure more professors, and
perhaps his desires predominated
after Mrs. Stanford's death.
A second possibility is lack of
money, and a third is lack of
agreement as to style.
When the restoration of the
church took place after the earth
quake, it was generally agreed
that the collapse of the tower had
ruined the building, and therefore
it would be esserrtial to replace
it with a steel frame. But a few
people questioned the reconstruc
tion of the exact structure, favor
ing the selection of a new and
perhaps more ornate design.
Temporary Roof
Alternative styles were submit
ted by architects but, as there
was a debate over what type of
design to adopt, a "temporary"
shingle roof was put on. This
"temporary" roof has been on for
53 years, and is the only roof on
the Quad which is not tile.
Discussion continued over the
church's unfinished state, and the
division as to the style of tower
or spire remained.
In December, 1908, the picture
of the or iginal church appeared
in the "Stanford Alumnus" with
the caption, "As It Was in the
Beginning, Is Not, and Ever
Should Be." Also with the picture
was the line, "IF there is to be
any radical change, by all means
let us have two mission towers
at the front of the building."
Popular Design
The most popular design at that
time featured a square base with
statues in niches and a 14-sided
dome with stained glass windows
(see* above). A picture of this
sketch by architects Meyers and
Ward was also featured in the
"Stanford Alumnus" of Decern
ber, 1908, with the following
statement:
"This is the design which has
been submitted to the Trustees
for the reconstruction of the Me
morial Church. It will arouse vig
orous protest, surely, from all
Stanford people to whom the
clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and senti
ment. For these features, this
design substitutes more of the
white figures against a back
ground of yell o w sandstone,
which to many eyes are like the
'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small win
flows is thus left at the top of the
tower.
"This change must be based en

tirely upon aesthetic considera
tions, since the commission of ar
chitects and engineers recom
mended the reconstruction of the
tower upon its original lines, with
the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more
in harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than
are the lines of Richardson's
Trinity Church may be debatable,
but there should be no uncertain
ty as to the necessily for the
clock and its quarter-hourly mu
sic."
Whether the Trustees ever ap
proved the plans is unknown, but
the Meyers and Ward plans went
no further, and the top remained
plain and boxlike.
Clock, Bells
The clock and bells of the
church, miraculously not dam
aged, were then placed "tempora
rily" in the clock tower, a struc
ture which is now falling apart,
according to Director of Planning
Eldridge T. Spencer.
Inconvenience and discomfort
have long resulted from the in
completion of the church, as the
poor fit of the roof caused by the
angle of pitch permits cold drafts
and the occasional entrance of
birds into the church.
Squatter's Rights
Around 1928 an owl made its
nest in the dome and proceeded
to select a place right over the
president's pew as its favorite
spot. Besides causing a pile of
dust to build up daily in the pew,
the bird began to tear out the
acoustical insulation and gener
ally to bother the chaplain, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner. The
Corporation Yard was called and,
after a mad chase, the owl was
killed by the only shot ever fired
in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv

think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture
should be kept simple, he said,
one example being the 14th cen
tury European Gothic cathedrals
in which birds now live in the
rafters.
Student Pressure
Spencer emphasized, however,
that the Planning Office operates
from student pressure, and that
if students desired a new tower or
spire it would be seriously consid
ered.
Planning Office decisions, how
ever, are based upon need and
available funds. No definite
plans are made without money,
tures and building methods might

change between the time the
stated Zach Stewart, as strue
plans are completed and the time
work may actually begin.
Need Not Pressing
In spite of a large file of corre
spondence between President
Sterling, Chaplain Minto and ar
chitects of the Planning Office
concerning the church tower or
spire, no specific designs have
ever been made because no mon
ey is available and because the
need is not pressing. Top priority
is now being given the Medical
Center and the Student Union,
Stewart said.
Even now, there is still a divi
sion over style. The most recenl
suggestion was made by Chaplain
Minto, who would like a separate
campanile next to the church
which would house Ihe bells and
possibly have a small chapel in
its base. The University had a
chapel on Inner Quad prior to
1906, but following the earth
quake it became an office build
ing, is now Dean VVinbigler's of
fice.
Status Quo
And so it appears that the
church will remain as it is, with
its leaky "candlesnuffer" top in
stead of a tall spire or tower or
graceful dome, at least until
enough alumni desire to improve
it. It seems that the building
which should be dominant from
its location on the exact axis of
the University will continue to be
subordinate to Hoover Tower. It
appears that the "heart and cen
ter of the University," as stated
by Jane Lathrop Stanford in the
Founding Ideal, will be forced to
continue to wear a most unglori
ous crown.



MEMORIAL CHURCH: "THE HEART AND CENTER OF THE UNIVERSITY"
Top left, before the earthquake of 19(K>; top right, architect's sketch done in 1908; bottom, today

There's something missing on
Inner Quad. It's been missing, in
fact, since the 1900 earthquake,
and it has never been returned or
replaced.
That "something" is the top of
the Memorial Church, the tower,
spire or 1 dome which would finish
the church building and complete
the architecture of the Quad. The
present square, squatty top lacks
beauty and dominance, as well as
causing inconvenience and dis
comfort inside the church.
There appears to be no definite
reason why the building was not
finished irr 1906, though several
explanations are possible.
Mrs. Stanford's Wishes
The possibility of a reaction
against construction was suggest
ed by Zach Stewart ,i Planning Of
fice staff assistant. Before her
deaih in 1906, Mrs. Jane Stanford
placed emphasis on University
buildings, apparently believing
that the University would best op
erate with numerous and ade
quate facilities. President David
Starr Jordan wanted, on the oth
er hand, the available funds used
to secure more professors, and
perhaps his desires predominated
after Mrs. Stanford's death.
A second possibility is lack of
money, and a third is lack of
agreement as to style.
When the restoration of the
church took place after the earth
quake, it was generally agreed
that the collapse of the tower had
ruined the building, and therefore
it would be esserrtial to replace
it with a steel frame. But a few
people questioned the reconstruc
tion of the exact structure, favor
ing the selection of a new and
perhaps more ornate design.
Temporary Roof
Alternative styles were submit
ted by architects but, as there
was a debate over what type of
design to adopt, a "temporary"
shingle roof was put on. This
"temporary" roof has been on for
53 years, and is the only roof on
the Quad which is not tile.
Discussion continued over the
church's unfinished state, and the
division as to the style of tower
or spire remained.
In December, 1908, the picture
of the or iginal church appeared
in the "Stanford Alumnus" with
the caption, "As It Was in the
Beginning, Is Not, and Ever
Should Be." Also with the picture
was the line, "IF there is to be
any radical change, by all means
let us have two mission towers
at the front of the building."
Popular Design
The most popular design at that
time featured a square base with
statues in niches and a 14-sided
dome with stained glass windows
(see* above). A picture of this
sketch by architects Meyers and
Ward was also featured in the
"Stanford Alumnus" of Decern
ber, 1908, with the following
statement:
"This is the design which has
been submitted to the Trustees
for the reconstruction of the Me
morial Church. It will arouse vig
orous protest, surely, from all
Stanford people to whom the
clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and senti
ment. For these features, this
design substitutes more of the
white figures against a back
ground of yell o w sandstone,
which to many eyes are like the
'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small win
flows is thus left at the top of the
tower.
"This change must be based en

tirely upon aesthetic considera
tions, since the commission of ar
chitects and engineers recom
mended the reconstruction of the
tower upon its original lines, with
the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more
in harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than
are the lines of Richardson's
Trinity Church may be debatable,
but there should be no uncertain
ty as to the necessily for the
clock and its quarter-hourly mu
sic."
Whether the Trustees ever ap
proved the plans is unknown, but
the Meyers and Ward plans went
no further, and the top remained
plain and boxlike.
Clock, Bells
The clock and bells of the
church, miraculously not dam
aged, were then placed "tempora
rily" in the clock tower, a struc
ture which is now falling apart,
according to Director of Planning
Eldridge T. Spencer.
Inconvenience and discomfort
have long resulted from the in
completion of the church, as the
poor fit of the roof caused by the
angle of pitch permits cold drafts
and the occasional entrance of
birds into the church.
Squatter's Rights
Around 1928 an owl made its
nest in the dome and proceeded
to select a place right over the
president's pew as its favorite
spot. Besides causing a pile of
dust to build up daily in the pew,
the bird began to tear out the
acoustical insulation and gener
ally to bother the chaplain, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner. The
Corporation Yard was called and,
after a mad chase, the owl was
killed by the only shot ever fired
in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv
ice a few years ago.
"I had visions of it appearing
and flying above the congrega
tion just as the preacher' began
the address," Chaplain Minto
smiles. "But just as the service
was beginning and we were pro
ceeding up the aisle, an usher
came to me with the bird in his
hand."
Though there was always talk
about completing the church, af

ter 1907 nothing concrete was
done until December, 1942, when
a Restoration Fund fur the Me
morial Church Spire was created.
Carl Breer was the first donor,
and his purpose was, in the exact
words, "to establish a fund to be
used for rebuilding the memorial
arch and restoring the church
spire. The restoration work is to
take place at some time after 1 the
conclusion of World War II."
Additional Contributions
In 1943 Mrs. Katherine Ryan
added $100 to the Spire Fund and
Orton C. Woodhead, $10. Since
then Brig. Gen. Philip R. Faymon
ville has contributed $250, and
Mr. and Mrs. Preston C. Burchard
added $1. These sums, together
with the compounded interest,
now give a total of $10,708.03 in
the fund at the present time.
A possible additional contribu
tion may be received from the
will of Joseph Lynn Choate, who
wanted some of his money to be
put towar d a "campanile, a dome,
or some substitute for the steeple
on the Church." A legal question
exists, however, as it is uncertain
whether the will amends a trust
previously made.
Lack of Funds
But $10,000 is only a beginning,
and this lack of funds is the pri
mary reason that nothing further
has been done about a spire,
tower or dome.
Planning Director Eldridge T.
Spencer estimates the cost of a
new spire al about $500,000.
"There is great difficulty build
ing in masonry," he stated. "It
would have to be steel covered

with imitation stone, and that
doesn't weather realistically. We
would also have to change the
footings."
"Doesn't Add"
Spencer felt that the architect's
sketch of 1908 "doesn't add." "I
think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture

fact, since the 1900 earthquake,
and it has never been returned or
replaced.
That "something" is the top of
the Memorial Church, the tower,
spire or 1 dome which would finish
the church building and complete
the architecture of the Quad. The
present square, squatty top lacks
beauty and dominance, as well as
causing inconvenience and dis
comfort inside the church.
There appears to be no definite
reason why the building was not
finished irr 1906, though several
explanations are possible.
Mrs. Stanford's Wishes
The possibility of a reaction
against construction was suggest
ed by Zach Stewart ,i Planning Of
fice staff assistant. Before her
deaih in 1906, Mrs. Jane Stanford
placed emphasis on University
buildings, apparently believing
that the University would best op
erate with numerous and ade
quate facilities. President David
Starr Jordan wanted, on the oth
er hand, the available funds used
to secure more professors, and
perhaps his desires predominated
after Mrs. Stanford's death.
A second possibility is lack of
money, and a third is lack of
agreement as to style.
When the restoration of the
church took place after the earth
quake, it was generally agreed
that the collapse of the tower had
ruined the building, and therefore
it would be esserrtial to replace
it with a steel frame. But a few
people questioned the reconstruc
tion of the exact structure, favor
ing the selection of a new and
perhaps more ornate design.
Temporary Roof
Alternative styles were submit
ted by architects but, as there
was a debate over what type of
design to adopt, a "temporary"
shingle roof was put on. This
"temporary" roof has been on for
53 years, and is the only roof on
the Quad which is not tile.
Discussion continued over the
church's unfinished state, and the
division as to the style of tower
or spire remained.
In December, 1908, the picture
of the or iginal church appeared
in the "Stanford Alumnus" with
the caption, "As It Was in the
Beginning, Is Not, and Ever
Should Be." Also with the picture
was the line, "IF there is to be
any radical change, by all means
let us have two mission towers
at the front of the building."
Popular Design
The most popular design at that
time featured a square base with
statues in niches and a 14-sided
dome with stained glass windows
(see* above). A picture of this
sketch by architects Meyers and
Ward was also featured in the
"Stanford Alumnus" of Decern
ber, 1908, with the following
statement:
"This is the design which has
been submitted to the Trustees
for the reconstruction of the Me
morial Church. It will arouse vig
orous protest, surely, from all
Stanford people to whom the
clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and senti
ment. For these features, this
design substitutes more of the
white figures against a back
ground of yell o w sandstone,
which to many eyes are like the
'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small win
flows is thus left at the top of the
tower.
"This change must be based en

tirely upon aesthetic considera
tions, since the commission of ar
chitects and engineers recom
mended the reconstruction of the
tower upon its original lines, with
the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more
in harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than
are the lines of Richardson's
Trinity Church may be debatable,
but there should be no uncertain
ty as to the necessily for the
clock and its quarter-hourly mu
sic."
Whether the Trustees ever ap
proved the plans is unknown, but
the Meyers and Ward plans went
no further, and the top remained
plain and boxlike.
Clock, Bells
The clock and bells of the
church, miraculously not dam
aged, were then placed "tempora
rily" in the clock tower, a struc
ture which is now falling apart,
according to Director of Planning
Eldridge T. Spencer.
Inconvenience and discomfort
have long resulted from the in
completion of the church, as the
poor fit of the roof caused by the
angle of pitch permits cold drafts
and the occasional entrance of
birds into the church.
Squatter's Rights
Around 1928 an owl made its
nest in the dome and proceeded
to select a place right over the
president's pew as its favorite
spot. Besides causing a pile of
dust to build up daily in the pew,
the bird began to tear out the
acoustical insulation and gener
ally to bother the chaplain, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner. The
Corporation Yard was called and,
after a mad chase, the owl was
killed by the only shot ever fired
in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv
ice a few years ago.
"I had visions of it appearing
and flying above the congrega
tion just as the preacher' began
the address," Chaplain Minto
smiles. "But just as the service
was beginning and we were pro
ceeding up the aisle, an usher
came to me with the bird in his
hand."
Though there was always talk
about completing the church, af

ter 1907 nothing concrete was
done until December, 1942, when
a Restoration Fund fur the Me
morial Church Spire was created.
Carl Breer was the first donor,
and his purpose was, in the exact
words, "to establish a fund to be
used for rebuilding the memorial
arch and restoring the church
spire. The restoration work is to
take place at some time after 1 the
conclusion of World War II."
Additional Contributions
In 1943 Mrs. Katherine Ryan
added $100 to the Spire Fund and
Orton C. Woodhead, $10. Since
then Brig. Gen. Philip R. Faymon
ville has contributed $250, and
Mr. and Mrs. Preston C. Burchard
added $1. These sums, together
with the compounded interest,
now give a total of $10,708.03 in
the fund at the present time.
A possible additional contribu
tion may be received from the
will of Joseph Lynn Choate, who
wanted some of his money to be
put towar d a "campanile, a dome,
or some substitute for the steeple
on the Church." A legal question
exists, however, as it is uncertain
whether the will amends a trust
previously made.
Lack of Funds
But $10,000 is only a beginning,
and this lack of funds is the pri
mary reason that nothing further
has been done about a spire,
tower or dome.
Planning Director Eldridge T.
Spencer estimates the cost of a
new spire al about $500,000.
"There is great difficulty build
ing in masonry," he stated. "It
would have to be steel covered

with imitation stone, and that
doesn't weather realistically. We
would also have to change the
footings."
"Doesn't Add"
Spencer felt that the architect's
sketch of 1908 "doesn't add." "I
think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture
should be kept simple, he said,
one example being the 14th cen
tury European Gothic cathedrals
in which birds now live in the
rafters.
Student Pressure
Spencer emphasized, however,
that the Planning Office operates
from student pressure, and that
if students desired a new tower or
spire it would be seriously consid
ered.
Planning Office decisions, how
ever, are based upon need and
available funds. No definite
plans are made without money,
tures and building methods might

change between the time the
stated Zach Stewart, as strue
plans are completed and the time
work may actually begin.
Need Not Pressing
In spite of a large file of corre
spondence between President
Sterling, Chaplain Minto and ar
chitects of the Planning Office
concerning the church tower or
spire, no specific designs have
ever been made because no mon
ey is available and because the
need is not pressing. Top priority
is now being given the Medical
Center and the Student Union,
Stewart said.
Even now, there is still a divi
sion over style. The most recenl
suggestion was made by Chaplain
Minto, who would like a separate
campanile next to the church
which would house Ihe bells and
possibly have a small chapel in
its base. The University had a
chapel on Inner Quad prior to
1906, but following the earth
quake it became an office build
ing, is now Dean VVinbigler's of
fice.
Status Quo
And so it appears that the
church will remain as it is, with
its leaky "candlesnuffer" top in
stead of a tall spire or tower or
graceful dome, at least until
enough alumni desire to improve
it. It seems that the building
which should be dominant from
its location on the exact axis of
the University will continue to be
subordinate to Hoover Tower. It
appears that the "heart and cen
ter of the University," as stated
by Jane Lathrop Stanford in the
Founding Ideal, will be forced to
continue to wear a most unglori
ous crown.

(see* above). A picture of this
sketch by architects Meyers and
Ward was also featured in the
"Stanford Alumnus" of Decern
ber, 1908, with the following
statement:
"This is the design which has
been submitted to the Trustees
for the reconstruction of the Me
morial Church. It will arouse vig
orous protest, surely, from all
Stanford people to whom the
clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and senti
ment. For these features, this
design substitutes more of the
white figures against a back
ground of yell o w sandstone,
which to many eyes are like the
'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small win
flows is thus left at the top of the
tower.
"This change must be based en

tirely upon aesthetic considera
tions, since the commission of ar
chitects and engineers recom
mended the reconstruction of the
tower upon its original lines, with
the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more
in harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than
are the lines of Richardson's
Trinity Church may be debatable,
but there should be no uncertain
ty as to the necessily for the
clock and its quarter-hourly mu
sic."
Whether the Trustees ever ap
proved the plans is unknown, but
the Meyers and Ward plans went
no further, and the top remained
plain and boxlike.
Clock, Bells
The clock and bells of the
church, miraculously not dam
aged, were then placed "tempora
rily" in the clock tower, a struc
ture which is now falling apart,
according to Director of Planning
Eldridge T. Spencer.
Inconvenience and discomfort
have long resulted from the in
completion of the church, as the
poor fit of the roof caused by the
angle of pitch permits cold drafts
and the occasional entrance of
birds into the church.
Squatter's Rights
Around 1928 an owl made its
nest in the dome and proceeded
to select a place right over the
president's pew as its favorite
spot. Besides causing a pile of
dust to build up daily in the pew,
the bird began to tear out the
acoustical insulation and gener
ally to bother the chaplain, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner. The
Corporation Yard was called and,
after a mad chase, the owl was
killed by the only shot ever fired
in the church.
Bird in Hand
Chaplain Robert M. Minto tells
of the small bird which was heard
just before a Baccalaureate Serv
ice a few years ago.
"I had visions of it appearing
and flying above the congrega
tion just as the preacher' began
the address," Chaplain Minto
smiles. "But just as the service
was beginning and we were pro
ceeding up the aisle, an usher
came to me with the bird in his
hand."
Though there was always talk
about completing the church, af

ter 1907 nothing concrete was
done until December, 1942, when
a Restoration Fund fur the Me
morial Church Spire was created.
Carl Breer was the first donor,
and his purpose was, in the exact
words, "to establish a fund to be
used for rebuilding the memorial
arch and restoring the church
spire. The restoration work is to
take place at some time after 1 the
conclusion of World War II."
Additional Contributions
In 1943 Mrs. Katherine Ryan
added $100 to the Spire Fund and
Orton C. Woodhead, $10. Since
then Brig. Gen. Philip R. Faymon
ville has contributed $250, and
Mr. and Mrs. Preston C. Burchard
added $1. These sums, together
with the compounded interest,
now give a total of $10,708.03 in
the fund at the present time.
A possible additional contribu
tion may be received from the
will of Joseph Lynn Choate, who
wanted some of his money to be
put towar d a "campanile, a dome,
or some substitute for the steeple
on the Church." A legal question
exists, however, as it is uncertain
whether the will amends a trust
previously made.
Lack of Funds
But $10,000 is only a beginning,
and this lack of funds is the pri
mary reason that nothing further
has been done about a spire,
tower or dome.
Planning Director Eldridge T.
Spencer estimates the cost of a
new spire al about $500,000.
"There is great difficulty build
ing in masonry," he stated. "It
would have to be steel covered

with imitation stone, and that
doesn't weather realistically. We
would also have to change the
footings."
"Doesn't Add"
Spencer felt that the architect's
sketch of 1908 "doesn't add." "I
think the church is nicer as it is
now," he said, "but that's only a
personal opinion."
Pearly Romanesque architecture
should be kept simple, he said,
one example being the 14th cen
tury European Gothic cathedrals
in which birds now live in the
rafters.
Student Pressure
Spencer emphasized, however,
that the Planning Office operates
from student pressure, and that
if students desired a new tower or
spire it would be seriously consid
ered.
Planning Office decisions, how
ever, are based upon need and
available funds. No definite
plans are made without money,
tures and building methods might

change between the time the
stated Zach Stewart, as strue
plans are completed and the time
work may actually begin.
Need Not Pressing
In spite of a large file of corre
spondence between President
Sterling, Chaplain Minto and ar
chitects of the Planning Office
concerning the church tower or
spire, no specific designs have
ever been made because no mon
ey is available and because the
need is not pressing. Top priority
is now being given the Medical
Center and the Student Union,
Stewart said.
Even now, there is still a divi
sion over style. The most recenl
suggestion was made by Chaplain
Minto, who would like a separate
campanile next to the church
which would house Ihe bells and
possibly have a small chapel in
its base. The University had a
chapel on Inner Quad prior to
1906, but following the earth
quake it became an office build
ing, is now Dean VVinbigler's of
fice.
Status Quo
And so it appears that the
church will remain as it is, with
its leaky "candlesnuffer" top in
stead of a tall spire or tower or
graceful dome, at least until
enough alumni desire to improve
it. It seems that the building
which should be dominant from
its location on the exact axis of
the University will continue to be
subordinate to Hoover Tower. It
appears that the "heart and cen
ter of the University," as stated
by Jane Lathrop Stanford in the
Founding Ideal, will be forced to
continue to wear a most unglori
ous crown.
