# BERLIN SITUATION
## Crisis May End If Top Powers Meet 
### J.M. Roberts Associated Press News Analyst 
If the Western Allies can get
the Soviet Union into conference
over Berlin and talk as long as
"he Chinese Reds did at Panmun
iorn over a Korean armistice, this
latest East-West crisis may even
ually simmer away.
It is noticeable that this has
been the ultimate outcome of ev
ery crisis in the last 10 years in
which all of the actors have been
controlled by the Soviet Union
Korea and Viet Nam having been
cases apart.
It is also noticeable lhat in this
particular case Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev announced a
flat policy of turning the East
Zone situation over to the East
German puppets and canceling
the Soviet Union's relations with
the Allies in Berlin. He sounded
as though he meant in the next
few days.
Peace Conference
Then he said in six months un
less the West entered into nego
tiations. Then he suggested a
nation peace conference over Ger
many. THIS the Allies refuse.
But they will start conferring
in Washington shortly on a reply
containing other suggestions for
negotiations, and on measures to
be adopted if there are no nego
tiations, or if they fail to get a
compromise.
No decisions have been reached
and all planning still is in the
speculative stage.
Reply to Soviets First
First will be a reply to the So
viet note about the 28-nation
meeting. Then discussion of
means of keeping up communica
tions with West Berlin if the So
viets should go through with
their threat.
There is no tendency to give in
on the point of recognizing any
East German atuhoritv.
There is no intention now to
force a military showdown by at
tempting to push military con
voys through possible East Ger
man road blocks.
The British are reported not to
like that idea at all, although

many Allied military loaders
hink they gave up too quickly on
hat point when the Soviet Union
iet up their blockade in 1948. That
)loekade was broken, after 11
months, by an amazing airlift.
One idea kicking around is that
the Allies should begin now to
make a highway blockade a ma
jor operation, by establishing a
pattern of continuous heavy traf
fic. Thus, if the East Germans
tried to .set up road blocks, they
would cause a big pile-up and ere
ale a much more combustible sit
uation than the Soviets might de
sire.
Standing .Must Be Saved
The Kremlin has carried the
whole thing so far now that some
sop will have to he thrown to the
East German regime, to protect
its standing at home, if the So
viet Union backs down on her
principal promise.
But there are indications that,
in the end, she will avoid a really
critical showdown.
