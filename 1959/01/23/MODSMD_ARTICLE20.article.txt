So what's new in sports? Not a lot as far as this writer is con
cerned, but the notebook is full of odds and ends and time to use
them is growing short. So, for what they turn out to be worth, here
are items of dubious interest handed to me iu the past two weeks.
OI K CONFUSION IS AGITATED Last week Head Yell Leader
Dick Stanford came up with a plan to please the "let's yell more"
crowd, and it impressed me as a good idea to give the plan a try
particularly at the Cal games. Twelve inches of copy space later this
writer urged everybody i<> go along with the new idea, for one night
ai least.
The error came in forgetting 10 urge Stanford to do it, too, 1
guess. Lit her 1 hat, or I missed parts of the Cal game through un
knowing, unconscious blackouts. The point is that Yell Leader Stan
ford didn't do what Student Body Stanford had come to expect.
Well, seeing that there isn't likely to be a change in this situation,
no more space for this. Rip out one page.
KAPP MARKS GOOD (?) After lots of fretting and worrying,
California's All-Amerlean quarterback Joe Kapp will realize his am
bition to play pro ball in the U.S. And a pretty close call it was get
ting to bo, at that. Those Canadian clubs were breathing hot down
,joe's back, but the Lear was confident that the Red, White and Blue
clubs would pick up on him.
A round-by-round account of Ihe draft sessions would probably
have sentChills down old Joe's spine, but came to round IS, the Wash
ington Redskins spoke up for him, the 209th player picked.
Well, now there's peace in Berkeley.
And "Rig Daddy" Chris Plain of Stanford went too, to Chicago's
Bears. Plain came along well last season, and showed on a number
of occasions that he could be valuable to a pro club.
SHIRLEY MARKS THE LIST There's a sports editor around
who gets into the darnedest situations, but he really takes them in
good nature? lie's Shirley Povicli of the Washington Post. Not too
long ago Shirley was presented with the immortality of a place in
"Who's Who in American Women." Good going, Shirley; it couldn't
happen to a nicer guy!
Down Rovard Field Way
FIGHT ON, FOR GOLD, SC—Well, that stink has blown over,
but it sure was good for a chuckle while it lasted. I couldn't help
but think of some of the "mutual respect," "individual policing"
phrases of the A A VV11 guide sheet as I read of the little newsbreak
down South.
Then there was a "Southland Report" in the Chronicle not too
long ago which quoted the Trojans' McKeevers as saying they could
tell a lew stories about schools which offered them more money to
attend than did SC. Some 35 schools, they said.
My questions: each, together, or what . . . how much . . . and why
didn't you take it?
Then there were other athletes at Troy who questioned the NCAA
ruling in words similar to "Why should we get penalized for some
thing someone else did, even somebody in another sport? It's a
shame!" Yes, boys, you're right: a damn shame!
ONE SOLUTION, ANYWAY —And in the midst of the SC squab
ble came a solution to end this athletic recruiting problem. It's not
ihe most workable one in the world, but these days any possible solu
tion is better- than letting the whole thing go.
This one is to stage a high school draft. It works this way: . . .
oh, forget about it, it's too complicated, but you get the idea.
SHE'S ON SR1S Hate to let the Stanford Girls' Ski Team go
without mention. The powder-puffers are breathing down my hack,
and besides that it's a fair story.
Charlotte Jones, captain Jerene Vix, Sherry Tettemer and Lucy
Stuart want it known that they are on the team. Tryouts were held
the first week of this quarler, and the club is sponsored by 1he Ski
Club.
Last weekend the girls skied at Squaw Valley against some Olym
pic tryoutees. They all fell down, but still did, to quote them, "quite
well." That they can stand up on skis is a good thing. In my opinion,
anyway.
This weekend they're teaching at the Stanford Winter Carnival
and on Sunday they will race in the Fresno Bee meet at Yosemite.
CAN'T PASS THIS UP A note on the intramural bulletin board
bears a great moral. Seems that the move is on to get the I-M squads
to appear at least semi-uniformish for games. (This in a free so
ciety?)

CAN'T PASS THIS UP A note on the intramural bulletin board

()dds and Finds
So what's new in sports? Not a lot as far as this writer is con
cerned, but the notebook is full of odds and ends and time to use
them is growing short. So, for what they turn out to be worth, here
are items of dubious interest handed to me iu the past two weeks.
OI K CONFUSION IS AGITATED Last week Head Yell Leader
Dick Stanford came up with a plan to please the "let's yell more"
crowd, and it impressed me as a good idea to give the plan a try
particularly at the Cal games. Twelve inches of copy space later this
writer urged everybody i<> go along with the new idea, for one night
ai least.
The error came in forgetting 10 urge Stanford to do it, too, 1
guess. Lit her 1 hat, or I missed parts of the Cal game through un
knowing, unconscious blackouts. The point is that Yell Leader Stan
ford didn't do what Student Body Stanford had come to expect.
Well, seeing that there isn't likely to be a change in this situation,
no more space for this. Rip out one page.
KAPP MARKS GOOD (?) After lots of fretting and worrying,
California's All-Amerlean quarterback Joe Kapp will realize his am
bition to play pro ball in the U.S. And a pretty close call it was get
ting to bo, at that. Those Canadian clubs were breathing hot down
,joe's back, but the Lear was confident that the Red, White and Blue
clubs would pick up on him.
A round-by-round account of Ihe draft sessions would probably
have sentChills down old Joe's spine, but came to round IS, the Wash
ington Redskins spoke up for him, the 209th player picked.
Well, now there's peace in Berkeley.
And "Rig Daddy" Chris Plain of Stanford went too, to Chicago's
Bears. Plain came along well last season, and showed on a number
of occasions that he could be valuable to a pro club.
SHIRLEY MARKS THE LIST There's a sports editor around
who gets into the darnedest situations, but he really takes them in
good nature? lie's Shirley Povicli of the Washington Post. Not too
long ago Shirley was presented with the immortality of a place in
"Who's Who in American Women." Good going, Shirley; it couldn't
happen to a nicer guy!
Down Rovard Field Way
FIGHT ON, FOR GOLD, SC—Well, that stink has blown over,
but it sure was good for a chuckle while it lasted. I couldn't help
but think of some of the "mutual respect," "individual policing"
phrases of the A A VV11 guide sheet as I read of the little newsbreak
down South.
Then there was a "Southland Report" in the Chronicle not too
long ago which quoted the Trojans' McKeevers as saying they could
tell a lew stories about schools which offered them more money to
attend than did SC. Some 35 schools, they said.
My questions: each, together, or what . . . how much . . . and why
didn't you take it?
Then there were other athletes at Troy who questioned the NCAA
ruling in words similar to "Why should we get penalized for some
thing someone else did, even somebody in another sport? It's a
shame!" Yes, boys, you're right: a damn shame!
ONE SOLUTION, ANYWAY —And in the midst of the SC squab
ble came a solution to end this athletic recruiting problem. It's not
ihe most workable one in the world, but these days any possible solu
tion is better- than letting the whole thing go.
This one is to stage a high school draft. It works this way: . . .
oh, forget about it, it's too complicated, but you get the idea.
SHE'S ON SR1S Hate to let the Stanford Girls' Ski Team go
without mention. The powder-puffers are breathing down my hack,
and besides that it's a fair story.
Charlotte Jones, captain Jerene Vix, Sherry Tettemer and Lucy
Stuart want it known that they are on the team. Tryouts were held
the first week of this quarler, and the club is sponsored by 1he Ski
Club.
Last weekend the girls skied at Squaw Valley against some Olym
pic tryoutees. They all fell down, but still did, to quote them, "quite
well." That they can stand up on skis is a good thing. In my opinion,
anyway.
This weekend they're teaching at the Stanford Winter Carnival
and on Sunday they will race in the Fresno Bee meet at Yosemite.

Last weekend the girls skied at Squaw Valley against some Olym
pic tryoutees. They all fell down, but still did, to quote them, "quite
well." That they can stand up on skis is a good thing. In my opinion,
anyway.
This weekend they're teaching at the Stanford Winter Carnival
and on Sunday they will race in the Fresno Bee meet at Yosemite.
CAN'T PASS THIS UP A note on the intramural bulletin board
bears a great moral. Seems that the move is on to get the I-M squads
to appear at least semi-uniformish for games. (This in a free so
ciety?)

()dds and Finds
So what's new in sports? Not a lot as far as this writer is con
cerned, but the notebook is full of odds and ends and time to use
them is growing short. So, for what they turn out to be worth, here
are items of dubious interest handed to me iu the past two weeks.
OI K CONFUSION IS AGITATED Last week Head Yell Leader
Dick Stanford came up with a plan to please the "let's yell more"
crowd, and it impressed me as a good idea to give the plan a try
particularly at the Cal games. Twelve inches of copy space later this
writer urged everybody i<> go along with the new idea, for one night
ai least.
The error came in forgetting 10 urge Stanford to do it, too, 1
guess. Lit her 1 hat, or I missed parts of the Cal game through un
knowing, unconscious blackouts. The point is that Yell Leader Stan
ford didn't do what Student Body Stanford had come to expect.
Well, seeing that there isn't likely to be a change in this situation,
no more space for this. Rip out one page.
KAPP MARKS GOOD (?) After lots of fretting and worrying,
California's All-Amerlean quarterback Joe Kapp will realize his am
bition to play pro ball in the U.S. And a pretty close call it was get
ting to bo, at that. Those Canadian clubs were breathing hot down
,joe's back, but the Lear was confident that the Red, White and Blue
clubs would pick up on him.
A round-by-round account of Ihe draft sessions would probably
have sentChills down old Joe's spine, but came to round IS, the Wash
ington Redskins spoke up for him, the 209th player picked.
Well, now there's peace in Berkeley.
And "Rig Daddy" Chris Plain of Stanford went too, to Chicago's
Bears. Plain came along well last season, and showed on a number
of occasions that he could be valuable to a pro club.
SHIRLEY MARKS THE LIST There's a sports editor around
who gets into the darnedest situations, but he really takes them in
good nature? lie's Shirley Povicli of the Washington Post. Not too
long ago Shirley was presented with the immortality of a place in
"Who's Who in American Women." Good going, Shirley; it couldn't
happen to a nicer guy!
Down Rovard Field Way
FIGHT ON, FOR GOLD, SC—Well, that stink has blown over,
but it sure was good for a chuckle while it lasted. I couldn't help
but think of some of the "mutual respect," "individual policing"
phrases of the A A VV11 guide sheet as I read of the little newsbreak
down South.
Then there was a "Southland Report" in the Chronicle not too
long ago which quoted the Trojans' McKeevers as saying they could
tell a lew stories about schools which offered them more money to
attend than did SC. Some 35 schools, they said.
My questions: each, together, or what . . . how much . . . and why
didn't you take it?
Then there were other athletes at Troy who questioned the NCAA
ruling in words similar to "Why should we get penalized for some
thing someone else did, even somebody in another sport? It's a
shame!" Yes, boys, you're right: a damn shame!
ONE SOLUTION, ANYWAY —And in the midst of the SC squab
ble came a solution to end this athletic recruiting problem. It's not
ihe most workable one in the world, but these days any possible solu
tion is better- than letting the whole thing go.
This one is to stage a high school draft. It works this way: . . .
oh, forget about it, it's too complicated, but you get the idea.
SHE'S ON SR1S Hate to let the Stanford Girls' Ski Team go
without mention. The powder-puffers are breathing down my hack,
and besides that it's a fair story.
Charlotte Jones, captain Jerene Vix, Sherry Tettemer and Lucy
Stuart want it known that they are on the team. Tryouts were held
the first week of this quarler, and the club is sponsored by 1he Ski
