# Frosh Cagers Host Tough COP Kittens
## 
### 
Stanford's erratic freshman
basketball team, hot one night
and frigid the next, faces College
of the Pacific Saturday night in
the Stanford Pavilion.
The Papooses' record stands at
4-3, and they hope to hit a hot
streak and crush the Kittens.
In order to do this, the squad
will need scoring from their ace
center, 6-7 John Windsor, and rug
ged 6-7 forward John Hosley.
These two mainstays can look for
help from 6-4 Jim Bryan, who led
the scoring against Cal in the sec
ond of last week end's two games
with 12 counters.
Opposite Bryan at guard will be
Ihe team floor leader, 6-1 John
Fontius, and at the other forward
Nels Christensen, 6-3. Bill Cover,
6-2, is looking for a chance to
break into the lineup.
Although COP is not an out
standing team, it will test the
Papooses' ability to play up to
potential consistently, a feat that
has somehow eluded the fresh
men this season. Witness the first
game against Cal: Indians 71,
Bears 4S. And just 24 hours later:
Indians 46, Bears 53.
Guard Bryan proved the sur
prise of the Cal series by turning
in an all-around strong game.

Bryan, despite his lack of real
height, garnered six of his 12
points on tip-ins. Center Windsor
leads the squad in scoring for the
season, while forward Hosley has
the most rebounds.
