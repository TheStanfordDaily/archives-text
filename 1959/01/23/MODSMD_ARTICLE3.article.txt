"Optimism" was the key word
in "The New France" as it was
described by Didier M. dc Fossey,
Depuly Consul General of France
in San Francisco, at the lIR Con
sular Talks Thursday.
De Fossey spoke of the new
character of France largely in
terms of De Gaulle's success in
dealing with the basic problems
which faced him when he came
into power.
"His very presence was enough
to restore order in France," said
De Fossey, "for he stood above
the parties." De Gaulle then pro
ceeded to reform the political in
stitutions, drawing up a constitu
tion which would provide the sta
bility so long needed by the
French government.
According to Dc Fossey, France
has further been strengthened in
ternally by the appearance of a
"middle party" in the new Assem
bly, a sort of intermediary be
twee! the "socialist left and the
conservative right in France."
On the international level,
"Frame is now more determined
than ever to work effectively with
hrr traditional allies for the de
fense of the free world," contin
ued Fossey. "We have become
young again. Having lost many
grudges from the past, we arc
now looking to the future."
