HAVANA, Cuba (,/P) —A crowd of more than 15,000 Cubans whis
tled, jeered and hooted at the first ex-army officer brought into
Havana's Sports Palace late Thursday for public trial on war crimes
charges.
The big spectacle put on by the Castro revolutionary regime to

world public opinion was wit
nessed also by a large group of

offset derogatory foreign reaction
against continuing executions of
the Batista dictatorship rem
nants.
The first, defendant in the Ha
vana showcase trials was Major
Jesus Sosa Blanco, former mili
tary commander at Holguin, Ori
ent e province. He appeared pale
and nervous as he faced the three
man revolutionary court that
holds his life in its hands.
He and the second and third
defendants called to trial Thurs
day were accused of assassina
tion, homicide and robbery.
The court president, Major
Humberto Sori Marin, read out to
Sosa Blanco a list of 108 high
crimes he is accused of in these
categories.
The reading of the charges was
interrupted frequently by roars
from the crowd.
The court said the defendant
had not designated a defender
and Army Captain Aristides Da-
Cost a would represent him.
At dusk the lights were turned
on in the modernistic sports pal
ace that ousted Dictator Fulgen
cio Batista built.
Fidel Castro announced he fa
fors a quick windup of the trials
and executions. He said they will
be ended "as soon as possible and
the sooner the better."
Reading off the charges, the
court president asserted the tri
bunal would "seek out the truth
and the guilt of the prisoner
must be proven beyond all reason
able doubt" before he could be
convicted.
