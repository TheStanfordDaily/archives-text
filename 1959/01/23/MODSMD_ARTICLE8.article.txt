## 
### Associated Press 
Winter's savage snow, sleet and
rainstorms tapered off Thursday
but a cold wave intensified the
misery of thousands and flood
waters put a big dent in industrial
production.
At least 75 were dead from
drowning or as a result of storm
conditions extending from New
Mexico to the Atlantic.
Storm damage ran into un
counted millions.
Thousands were homeless in
flooded areas of Ohio, Kentucky,
New York, Pennsylvania and In
diana.
Mines Closed
Other thousands were thrown
out of work when big manufac
turing plants and coal mines shut
down operations in stricken com
munities in the East. Stores,
schools and offices closed and
travel was difficult if not impos
sible in some areas.
Arctic air settled over much of
the eastern two-thirds of the na
tion, adding to the misery of the
storm sufferers.
The cold eased flood conditions
in some areas, but many down
stream points still faced the
threat of later damage and evacu
ations.
Worst Floods in 25 Years
Ohio reeled under the worst
flood waters in more than a quar
ter of a century. At least 10 per
sons drowned and others were
missing and believed dead.
Ohio River tributaries subsided
during the day, but traffic was
hampered nearly everywhere as
the high waters washed out
bridges and poured over high
ways. Some evacuees began trick
ling back to their homes bul thou
sands still were in emergency
quarters in schools, lodge halls
and other buildings.
Water from the swollen Sus
quehanna River in Pennsylvania
poured into a coal mine shaft.
Three miners were killed and for
a while 40 to 45 were trapped.
