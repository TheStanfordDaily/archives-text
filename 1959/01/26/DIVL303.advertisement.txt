IS STUDYING NECESSARY?
Once there were three roommates and their names were Walter
Pellucid, Casimir Fing, and Leßoy Holocaust and they were all
taking English lit. They were all happy, friendly, outgoing
types and they all smoked Philip Morris Cigarettes as you
would expect from such a gregarious trio, for Philip Morris is
the very essence of sociability, the very spirit of amity, the very
soul of concord, with its tobacco so mild and true, its packs so
soft and flip-top, its length so regular or long size. You will
find when you smoke Philip Morris that the birds sing for you
and no man's hand is raised against you.
Each night after dinner Walter and Casimir and Leßoy went
to their room and studied English lit. For three hours they sat
in sombre silence and pored over their books and then, squinty
and spent, they toppled onto their pallets and sobbed them
selves to sleep.
This joyless situation obtained all through September and
October. Then one November night they were all simultane
ously struck by a marvelous idea. "We are all studying the same
thing," they cried. "Why, then, should each of us study for
throe hours? Why not each study for one hour? It is true we
will only learn one-third as much that way, but it does not
matter because there are three of us and next January before
tlie exams, we can get together and pool our knowledge!"
Oh, what rapture then fell on Walter and Casimir and Leßoy!
They flung their beanies into the air and danced a schottische
and lit thirty or forty Philip Morrises and ran out to pursue
the pleasure which had so long, so bitterly, been missing from
their lives.
Alas, they found instead a series of grisly misfortunes. Walter,
alas, went searching for love and was soon going steady with a
coed named Invicta Breadstuff, a handsome lass, but, alas,
hopelessly addicted to bowling. Each night she bowled five
hundred lines, some nights a thousand. Poor Walter's thumb
was a shambles and his purse was empty, but Invicta just kept
on bowling and in the end, alas, she left Walter for a pin-setter,
which was a terrible thing to do to Walter, especially in this
case, because the pin-setter was automatic.
Walter, of course, was far too distraught to study his English
lit, but he took some comfort from the fact that his room
mates were studying and they would help him before the exams,
lint Walter, alas, was wrong. Mis roommates, Casimir ami
Leßoy, were nature lovers and they used their free time to go
for long tramps in the woods. One November night, alas,
they were treed by two bears, Casimir by a brown bear and
Leßoy by a Kodiak, and they were kept in the trees until mid-
January when winter set in and the brown bear and the Kodiak
went away to hibernate.
So when the three roommates met before exams to pool
their knowledge, they found they had none to pool! Well sir,
they had a good long laugh about that and then rushed to the
kitchen and stuck their heads in the oven. It was, however, an
electric oven and the effects were, on the whole, beneficial. The
wax in their ears got melted and they acquired a healthy tan

IS STUDYING NECESSARY?
Once there were three roommates and their names were Walter
Pellucid, Casimir Fing, and Leßoy Holocaust and they were all
taking English lit. They were all happy, friendly, outgoing
types and they all smoked Philip Morris Cigarettes as you
would expect from such a gregarious trio, for Philip Morris is
the very essence of sociability, the very spirit of amity, the very
soul of concord, with its tobacco so mild and true, its packs so
soft and flip-top, its length so regular or long size. You will
find when you smoke Philip Morris that the birds sing for you
and no man's hand is raised against you.
Each night after dinner Walter and Casimir and Leßoy went
to their room and studied English lit. For three hours they sat
in sombre silence and pored over their books and then, squinty
and spent, they toppled onto their pallets and sobbed them
selves to sleep.
This joyless situation obtained all through September and
October. Then one November night they were all simultane
ously struck by a marvelous idea. "We are all studying the same
thing," they cried. "Why, then, should each of us study for
throe hours? Why not each study for one hour? It is true we
will only learn one-third as much that way, but it does not
matter because there are three of us and next January before
tlie exams, we can get together and pool our knowledge!"
Oh, what rapture then fell on Walter and Casimir and Leßoy!
They flung their beanies into the air and danced a schottische
and lit thirty or forty Philip Morrises and ran out to pursue
the pleasure which had so long, so bitterly, been missing from
their lives.
Alas, they found instead a series of grisly misfortunes. Walter,
alas, went searching for love and was soon going steady with a
coed named Invicta Breadstuff, a handsome lass, but, alas,
hopelessly addicted to bowling. Each night she bowled five
hundred lines, some nights a thousand. Poor Walter's thumb
was a shambles and his purse was empty, but Invicta just kept
on bowling and in the end, alas, she left Walter for a pin-setter,
which was a terrible thing to do to Walter, especially in this
case, because the pin-setter was automatic.
Walter, of course, was far too distraught to study his English
