# Jaycees Honor Physicist Pake
## 
### 
Dr. George E. Pake, professor of physics, was one of the five out
standing young men honored by the California Junior Chamber of
Commerce at a banquet Saturday night.
Pake, 34, has been at Stanford since 1936. He received the Ph.D.
from Harvard and was executive head of the physics department at

Washington University in St.
Louis until 1956.
He is currently studying the
extent to which electrons contrib
ute to the magnetism of matter.
Other Awards
Other award recipients includ
ed two scientists, Dr. Albert R.
Hibbs, who is involved in work
on U.S. lunar probes, and Dr.
Wayland O. Griffith, in charge of
missile and spacecraft research
and development for Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation in Palo Alto;
an educator, Vic Ralph Knight Jr.,
vice principal at a Whittier junior
high school, and an athlete, Rafer
Johnson, world decathlon cham
pion and student body president
at UCLA.
Noting that the list did not in
clude a representative of the hu
manities, Pake told the Saturday
night gathering, "While I am sure
the scientists are pleased by this
recognition, I also hope that in
the future the public will recog
nize our colleges in the arts and
humanities.
Other Branches
"All areas of the intellectual
have been underestimated in the
past and I hope that some of the
recognition which science has
had in the past months will rub
off onto the other branches of
learning."
According to Prof. L. I. Sehiff,
executive head of the physics de
partment, Pake has developed a
quantitative method for chemical
analysis of the molecular struc
ture of materials.
"Pake is an extremely good
teacher at all levels, and he is
highly regarded by students,"
Schiff told The Daily.
Also speaking at Saturday's
dinner, Hibbs warned that in the
rush toward science "we do not
turn the 'Michelangelos' from
their canvasses, the 'Lincolns'
from their compassion and the
'Shakespeares' from their writ
ing."

on U.S. lunar probes, and Dr.
Wayland O. Griffith, in charge of
missile and spacecraft research
and development for Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation in Palo Alto;
an educator, Vic Ralph Knight Jr.,
vice principal at a Whittier junior
high school, and an athlete, Rafer
Johnson, world decathlon cham
pion and student body president
at UCLA.
Noting that the list did not in
clude a representative of the hu
manities, Pake told the Saturday
night gathering, "While I am sure
the scientists are pleased by this
recognition, I also hope that in
the future the public will recog
nize our colleges in the arts and
humanities.
Other Branches
"All areas of the intellectual
have been underestimated in the
past and I hope that some of the
recognition which science has
had in the past months will rub
off onto the other branches of
learning."
According to Prof. L. I. Sehiff,
executive head of the physics de
partment, Pake has developed a
quantitative method for chemical
analysis of the molecular struc
ture of materials.
"Pake is an extremely good
teacher at all levels, and he is
highly regarded by students,"
Schiff told The Daily.
Also speaking at Saturday's
dinner, Hibbs warned that in the
rush toward science "we do not
turn the 'Michelangelos' from
their canvasses, the 'Lincolns'
from their compassion and the
'Shakespeares' from their writ
ing."
Dr. George E. Pake, professor of physics, was one of the five out
standing young men honored by the California Junior Chamber of
Commerce at a banquet Saturday night.
Pake, 34, has been at Stanford since 1936. He received the Ph.D.
from Harvard and was executive head of the physics department at

Washington University in St.
Louis until 1956.
He is currently studying the
extent to which electrons contrib
ute to the magnetism of matter.
