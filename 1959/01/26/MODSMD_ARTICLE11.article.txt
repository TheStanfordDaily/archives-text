# Nanney Plays Handel
## 
### Raymond A. Prier 
After 200 years, Handel has
gained an unfortunate aura of
pomposity and stilted magnitude
which was shattered conclusively
yesterday in Memorial Church by
the lyrical and pleasingly-authen
tic performance of Organist Her
bert B. Nanney, ably assisted by
the members of the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra under the
direction of Sandor Salgo.
The program, in honor of the
56th anniversary of the dedica
tion of the Stanford Memorial
Church, concentrated its efforts
around three of the Handel or
gan concerti, opus i, numbers 1.
2 and 4. These delightful works
with their ingratiating themes
and graceful form were playfully
and correctly executed; the co-or
dination between orchestra and
organ was admirable in every re
spect.

Authenticity- truly paid off in
numbers 1 and 4. Happily the
tempos did not fall into a stately
confusion as so often happens
with today's Handel; the artful
blending of organ and orchestra
lifted these two works far above
the typically Baroque composi
tion.
Filial Polish
Nanncy's cadcnza, so merrily
interpreted, added the final polish
to the latter composition. It is
unfortunate that a bit more explo
ration into phrasing and Baroque
rubalo was not attempted in the
number two, which although
beautiful in line and pace, still
failed to approach the other two
works.
The two Bach Chorale Preludes
which preceded the Handel were
masterfully executed; Nanney
performed a true piece of artistic
interpretation on the second. His

excellent ornamentation and his
tasteful rubalos added greatly to
this highly lyrical work.
Create Cleavage
The Bach Fantaisie and Fugue
in G Minor created a cleavage "in
the total idea of thr program; the
contrast was caustic and not al
together pleasing. The Fantasie
appeared in its entirely to he too
formal and lacked that certain
personal interpretation which is
imperative to give this work its
needed vigor; however, Nanncy
redeemed the composition and the
program through his artful and
stirring interpretation of the
fugue.
Two other concerts of Handel's
organ concerti will be given April
19 and May 17; it would be unfor
tunate to miss tlic experience of
discovering an aspect of Handel
so seldom seen in modern inter
pretations of this great master's
works.
