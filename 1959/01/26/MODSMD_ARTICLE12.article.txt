### Maynard Parker 
Three Stanford students, bound for a weekend in Reno, were se
riously hurt and a fourth escaped with minor cuts in a bloody head-on
collision that took the life of one other person Saturday near the
Nevada-California state line.
Seriously injured and in Washoe Medical Center arc Bob Snelling,

24, and Lawrence Reich, 21, of
Kappa Sigma fraternity and Del
ta Chi Bill Seanor, 22. Walter
Kennedy, 21, also a Delta Chi, was
released after treatment for mi
nor abrasions.
"The driver of the other car
must have either fallen asleep or
boon drunk," Snelling said in a
telephone interview with The
Daily. "He almost hit the car
ahead of us when he swerved
over the white line and then he
came right for us."
"We didn't have a chance. If we
had moved off the road any more,
we would have plunged over a
steep cliff," Snelling continued.
Killed on Impact
The driver of the other car,
Coast Guardsman Charles Wells,
25, of San Francisco, was killed
on impact. A passenger in his
car, Joseph Montoya, 22, also of
San Francisco, was taken to the
Medical Center.
Snelling stated that the High
way Patrol found a partly used
bottle in Wells' car. He also said
that they will not be held since
witnesses verified their story.
The students were traveling
"not over 50 miles per hour," ac
cording to Snelling, in Seanor's
1956 Mercury, when the accident
occurred about 10 miles west of
Reno on U.S. Highway 40.
He said that they waited only
about five minutes before a cruis
ing highway patrol car found
them and radioed for an ambu
lance.
Injuries
According to hospital authori
ties, Snelling suffered a broken
hand, a bad gash on his knee and
a broken jaw. Seanor received a
compound fracture of the right
leg which broke clear through
the skin.
Reich bruised his arm and re
quired several stitches in his
head. The fourth member of the
party, Kennedy, received only a
small cut on his knee.
Complimenting the authorities,
Snelling said that "the medical
service here has been very good.
As far as I am concerned, the
treatment has been thorough and
no time was wasted in getting us
hospitalized."
Held in Hospital
Hospital personnel stated that
Snelling and Seanor will be re
leased in about 10 days, but will
not be able to return actively to
their studies for about two
months.
Snelling's parents rushed to his
bedside from their home in the
Bay Area upon hearing the news
of their son's injuries. The other
men's parents have also been no
tified.
After conferring with their par
ents, the men said that probably
there will be no court action
taken against the other party.
