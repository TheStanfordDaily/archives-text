# Earth Calls Fear Threat To Liberty
## 
### Bruce Smith 
"The threat to our civil liber
ties has shifted, in the past three
or four years, from a neurotic
fear of Communism to an almost
equally neurotic fear of crime,"
said Alan Barth in his Friday
night lecture at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
Speaking on "Law Enforce
ment and Individual Rights," he
said that the threat of Communist
subversion caused people to sanc
tion a "witchhunt" on the basis of
reports by "faceless accusers."
"Test Oaths" Repugnant
The current crop of "test oaths"
and "affirmations of loyalty"
would be repugnant to the men
who wrote our constitution, he de
clared. But the main threat now
he continued, is from attacks on
the procedural lights of citizens,
such as immunity from search
and seizure without a warrant,
rather than on substantive rights
like freedom of speech.
The latter trend is harder to
combat, Barth stated, because it
is mainly the scum of society,
whose procedural rights are vio
lated. There is a tendency by the
public, he continued, to dismiss
such violations as technicalities.
Crime, Barth admitted, is a
very real and growing problem in
our society. But he doubted that
more vigorous police action would
solve the problem.
Restrain Police
Only by having the courts rig
idly exclude evidence gained by
illegal means can the police be re
strained, he said, adding that the
police force is supposed to be the
servant of the public, not its mas
ter.
Quoting a Federal judge, Barth
said, "Where police are judges in
dividual liberty and justice cannot
survive."
"The fight against lawlessness
when waged by illegal means is
reduced almost to the level of
war between two lawless groups,"
Barth concluded.
