This Tin ksiiay President Sterling will speak to the members of
the Legislature in a (1LOSKI) meeting.
Few will deny the value of having the I niversity president
meet with students, and that if any discussion is to be done, the
size of the group must he limited.
However, we object to the way in which this is being handled.
Under the (onstitution (Article 111, section 4), the.
Legislature may convene in executive session by a three
fourths cote of the members present, and minutes are to
be recorded. Otherwise, says the same section of the ('.on
stitution, thi' Legislature shall meet regularly in public
session.
No vote has been taken for an executive session. And, although
no business uill be transacted ai the meeting with Dr. Sterling,
there apparently will he no regular meeting this week.
The Legislature, therefore, could call the Thursday afternoon
meeting a regular session and vote then to go into executive ses
sion. Or it could open the afternoon meeting to the public. Or
its members could call themselves a select group of students in
vited to meet and lalk with Dr. Sterling Thursday afternoon AM)
hold a regular session Thursday night to transact business.
Legislature members objected last week to having to
attend two meetings on Thursday. If they would stick to
the subject of dis< ussions at their regular meetings and
not repeal themselves so often, and if /'resident /{(din
would wield a heavier gavel in the discussions, the meet
ings would not wander on toward II p.m. as <lid last
U'eek's.
Unfortunate as it is, President Sterling cannot meet with all
students on campus in discussion groups; the Legislature, com
posed of the elected representatives of the students, is a logical
group to meet with him. But the Legislature also has a duly to
conduct its business in regular sessions, and we challenge them to
take the lime to do so.
