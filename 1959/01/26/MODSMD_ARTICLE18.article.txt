# THE 						EDITOR'S SCRAPBOOK
## The 						Last Word 
### 
In an editor's last column, ho
(or she) is tempted to become
somewhat sentimental. He is in
clined to gloss over mistakes and
see only the better facets of the
volume. This is a natural desire,
just as it is not unnatural to make
an occasional mistake.
Let's take a look at what 1
as editor think are some of the
improvements of Volume 134.
More space has been devoted
these past months to book re
views, play reviews and thought
provoking feature material than
has been in the other years of
my experience with The Daily.
For instance, there are the recent
articles on general education at
Stanford — where is it going?
what are the current plans and
thoughts? Last fall we followed
through "The Political Eye" the
progress of the election cam
paign. This week there will be
a series on the sponsor system.
The Administration has been
urged through articles and edito
rials to do more of "the little
things" which will aid students in
the overall learning process.
Last fall I devoted four edito
rials out of 11 over a two-week
period to rooters at football
games. May I take this moment
to point out that never once, de
spite the belief of many of our
letter-writers, did I tell you, dear
reader, that you HAD to go to
the football game and HAD to
yell. I did ask that once you de
cided to go you have enough of
that old school spirit — a term
which is too often bandied about
—that you sit through it to the
bitter end. I shan't bother to
quote the phrases which many
letter writers chose to ignore;
you can look back if you want to.
I took the same view of student
government activities, and urged
students to give them considera
tion, and then if they decided they
wanted nothing to do with them,
to go their own way.
Now that we're on this sub
ject I'd like to discuss a current
issue which 1 feel is closely re
lated —that of the President's
Student-Faculty Advisory Com
mittee of Academic Affairs.
The President's Committee is
composed of students invited by
the President to participate. Some
of these are representatives of
special groups- ASSU President
John Bohn is one and others are
members at large. There is no
direct connection with the ASSU.
If the ASSU and its Legisla
ture is to be adequately represen
tative of campus life and opinion,
it should reach into the field of
academics, as well as money and
rallies. To do this there should
be more bond with the Adminis
tration than John Bohn. With this
in mind, we propose that the stu
dents on the President's Commit
tee become a special committee of

the Legislature, appointed by
President Sterling upon the rec
ommendation of Bohn and the
Legislature, and responsible to
the Legislature.
The students on the committee
are, at present, responsible only
to the committee, and while all
are seriously concerned with the
problems which are discussed,
they have no means of being ade
quately representative of the
ideas of the students in general.
Too many of them discuss prob
lems only with those of like mind,
while the rest are in the dark as
to what is going on.
Here is where a direct tie-up
with the Legislature would be
of assistance in gathering more
of the student ideas.
This brings to mind another
problem, however. We would like
to ask the members of the Legis
lature:
How many of you made ade
quate reports to your constitu
encies?
How many of you really
know what your constituencies
want done? Or do you think
they want certain things done
because YOU want them done?
Thursday night the Legislature
heard reports from special com
mittees on the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Com
mission and on Rally Commission
and Cardinals. These two reports
have been under discussion by the
committees since December. What
has been accomplished? Appar
ently little, for both groups were
instructed to investigate further.
One difficulty is that both
groups realized their limitations
and attempted to hold their re
ports to the subject at hand. But
the ramifications of both are too
great for this; therefore, the
study as it is is somewhat sense
less.
Questions have arisen as to
where Fun Stan Com fits into
the total judicial picture. Presi
dent Bohn declared Thursday
night that he is concerned with
the structure of the ASSU, espe
cially the judicial. If he is so con
cerned, we challenge him to do
something al>out it. This problem
should have taken precedence
over an investigation of the func
tions of the Student-Faculty Com
mission or the Speech Activities.
May we remind Bohn that, though
it would seem that there is plenty
of time, the year is half over (wit
ness the end of Volume 134) and
an effective reorganization of the
judicial set-up, if needed as it ap
pears, would be more to the bene
fit of the student body than let
ting the Legislature members
know what each commission is
doing. This latter is valuable, but
a decision must be made as to
what should demand the Legisla
ture's time first.

volume. This is a natural desire,
just as it is not unnatural to make
an occasional mistake.
Let's take a look at what 1
as editor think are some of the
improvements of Volume 134.
More space has been devoted
these past months to book re
views, play reviews and thought
provoking feature material than
has been in the other years of
my experience with The Daily.
For instance, there are the recent
articles on general education at
Stanford — where is it going?
what are the current plans and
thoughts? Last fall we followed
through "The Political Eye" the
progress of the election cam
paign. This week there will be
a series on the sponsor system.
The Administration has been
urged through articles and edito
rials to do more of "the little
things" which will aid students in
the overall learning process.
Last fall I devoted four edito
rials out of 11 over a two-week
period to rooters at football
games. May I take this moment
to point out that never once, de
spite the belief of many of our
letter-writers, did I tell you, dear
reader, that you HAD to go to
the football game and HAD to
yell. I did ask that once you de
cided to go you have enough of
that old school spirit — a term
which is too often bandied about
—that you sit through it to the
bitter end. I shan't bother to
quote the phrases which many
letter writers chose to ignore;
you can look back if you want to.
I took the same view of student
government activities, and urged
students to give them considera
tion, and then if they decided they
wanted nothing to do with them,
to go their own way.
Now that we're on this sub
ject I'd like to discuss a current
issue which 1 feel is closely re
lated —that of the President's
Student-Faculty Advisory Com
mittee of Academic Affairs.
The President's Committee is
composed of students invited by
the President to participate. Some
of these are representatives of
special groups- ASSU President
John Bohn is one and others are
members at large. There is no
direct connection with the ASSU.
If the ASSU and its Legisla
ture is to be adequately represen
tative of campus life and opinion,
it should reach into the field of
academics, as well as money and
rallies. To do this there should
be more bond with the Adminis
tration than John Bohn. With this
in mind, we propose that the stu
dents on the President's Commit
tee become a special committee of

the Legislature, appointed by
President Sterling upon the rec
ommendation of Bohn and the
Legislature, and responsible to
the Legislature.
The students on the committee
are, at present, responsible only
to the committee, and while all
are seriously concerned with the
problems which are discussed,
they have no means of being ade
quately representative of the
ideas of the students in general.
Too many of them discuss prob
lems only with those of like mind,
while the rest are in the dark as
to what is going on.
Here is where a direct tie-up
with the Legislature would be
of assistance in gathering more
of the student ideas.
This brings to mind another
problem, however. We would like
to ask the members of the Legis
lature:
How many of you made ade
quate reports to your constitu
encies?
How many of you really
know what your constituencies
want done? Or do you think
they want certain things done
because YOU want them done?
Thursday night the Legislature
heard reports from special com
mittees on the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Com
mission and on Rally Commission
and Cardinals. These two reports
have been under discussion by the
committees since December. What
has been accomplished? Appar
ently little, for both groups were
instructed to investigate further.
One difficulty is that both
groups realized their limitations
and attempted to hold their re
ports to the subject at hand. But
the ramifications of both are too
great for this; therefore, the
study as it is is somewhat sense
less.
Questions have arisen as to
where Fun Stan Com fits into
the total judicial picture. Presi
dent Bohn declared Thursday
night that he is concerned with
the structure of the ASSU, espe
cially the judicial. If he is so con
cerned, we challenge him to do
something al>out it. This problem
should have taken precedence
over an investigation of the func
tions of the Student-Faculty Com
mission or the Speech Activities.
May we remind Bohn that, though
it would seem that there is plenty
of time, the year is half over (wit
ness the end of Volume 134) and
an effective reorganization of the
judicial set-up, if needed as it ap
pears, would be more to the bene
fit of the student body than let
ting the Legislature members
know what each commission is
doing. This latter is valuable, but
a decision must be made as to
what should demand the Legisla
ture's time first.

an occasional mistake.
Let's take a look at what 1
as editor think are some of the
improvements of Volume 134.
More space has been devoted
these past months to book re
views, play reviews and thought
provoking feature material than
has been in the other years of
my experience with The Daily.
For instance, there are the recent
articles on general education at
Stanford — where is it going?
what are the current plans and
thoughts? Last fall we followed
through "The Political Eye" the
progress of the election cam
paign. This week there will be
a series on the sponsor system.
The Administration has been
urged through articles and edito
rials to do more of "the little
things" which will aid students in
the overall learning process.
Last fall I devoted four edito
rials out of 11 over a two-week
period to rooters at football
games. May I take this moment
to point out that never once, de
spite the belief of many of our
letter-writers, did I tell you, dear
reader, that you HAD to go to
the football game and HAD to
yell. I did ask that once you de
cided to go you have enough of
that old school spirit — a term
which is too often bandied about
—that you sit through it to the
bitter end. I shan't bother to
quote the phrases which many
letter writers chose to ignore;
you can look back if you want to.
I took the same view of student
government activities, and urged
students to give them considera
tion, and then if they decided they
wanted nothing to do with them,
to go their own way.
Now that we're on this sub
ject I'd like to discuss a current
issue which 1 feel is closely re
lated —that of the President's
Student-Faculty Advisory Com
mittee of Academic Affairs.
The President's Committee is
composed of students invited by
the President to participate. Some
of these are representatives of
special groups- ASSU President
John Bohn is one and others are
members at large. There is no
direct connection with the ASSU.
If the ASSU and its Legisla
ture is to be adequately represen
tative of campus life and opinion,
it should reach into the field of
academics, as well as money and
rallies. To do this there should
be more bond with the Adminis
tration than John Bohn. With this
in mind, we propose that the stu
dents on the President's Commit
tee become a special committee of

the Legislature, appointed by
President Sterling upon the rec
ommendation of Bohn and the
Legislature, and responsible to
the Legislature.
The students on the committee
are, at present, responsible only
to the committee, and while all
are seriously concerned with the
problems which are discussed,
they have no means of being ade
quately representative of the
ideas of the students in general.
Too many of them discuss prob
lems only with those of like mind,
while the rest are in the dark as
to what is going on.
Here is where a direct tie-up
with the Legislature would be
of assistance in gathering more
of the student ideas.
This brings to mind another
problem, however. We would like
to ask the members of the Legis
lature:
How many of you made ade
quate reports to your constitu
encies?
How many of you really
know what your constituencies
want done? Or do you think
they want certain things done
because YOU want them done?
Thursday night the Legislature
heard reports from special com
mittees on the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Com
mission and on Rally Commission
and Cardinals. These two reports
have been under discussion by the
committees since December. What
has been accomplished? Appar
ently little, for both groups were
instructed to investigate further.
One difficulty is that both
groups realized their limitations
and attempted to hold their re
ports to the subject at hand. But
the ramifications of both are too
great for this; therefore, the
study as it is is somewhat sense
less.
Questions have arisen as to
where Fun Stan Com fits into
the total judicial picture. Presi
dent Bohn declared Thursday
night that he is concerned with
the structure of the ASSU, espe
cially the judicial. If he is so con
cerned, we challenge him to do
something al>out it. This problem
should have taken precedence
over an investigation of the func
tions of the Student-Faculty Com
mission or the Speech Activities.
May we remind Bohn that, though
it would seem that there is plenty
of time, the year is half over (wit
ness the end of Volume 134) and
an effective reorganization of the
judicial set-up, if needed as it ap
pears, would be more to the bene
fit of the student body than let
ting the Legislature members
know what each commission is
doing. This latter is valuable, but
a decision must be made as to
what should demand the Legisla
ture's time first.
In an editor's last column, ho
(or she) is tempted to become
somewhat sentimental. He is in
clined to gloss over mistakes and
see only the better facets of the
volume. This is a natural desire,
just as it is not unnatural to make
an occasional mistake.
