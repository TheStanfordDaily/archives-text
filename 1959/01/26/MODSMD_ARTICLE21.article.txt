# Sponsor System—Is It Justified?

### 
(Editor's Note: This is the
first of a series of articles dis
cussing the merits of the spon
sor system at Stanford. Leo
Krulitz and Camille Petersen
have combined efforts to inter
view sponsors and freshmen
and to organize the comments
obtained into thoughtful form.
The first article is an introduc
tion to the study and outlines
the aims of the sponsor sys
tem.)
Hy Leo Krulitz
To evaluate an entrenched insti
tution such as Stanford's sponsor
system is a difficult task espe
cially when the conclusions must
be given in terms of recommenda
tions for improvements instead of
a "well done."
Matters aren't facilitated when
objectivity is threatened by the
writers' biases. However, in talk
ing with sponsors and freshmen,
and in weighing opinions, com
plaints and suggestions, a sincere
effort has been made to remain
completely objective.
Sponsor Influence
Determining how much fresh
men are influenced by sponsors
and the results of this influence
are the basic aims of this study.
Such questions as, "How much in
fluence will sponsors have over
freshmen as they go through
rush?" "Do sponsors consciously
or unconsciously influence the
moral structure of the fresh
men?" and "Is the sponsor sys
tem and segregated living doing
what it is expected to?" indicate
the nature of the problems pur
sued.
Before an analysis, or evalua
tion of the sponsor system can be
made, it is necessary to establish
the criterion on which it is to be
judged. The objectives of the
sponsor program as defined by
the sponsors and officials are the
only valid criterion that might be
used, and it is not the purpose
of these articles to question these
objectives.
Objectives Outlined
In this article today an attempt
will be made to outline these ob
jectives, and tomorrow the writ
er will indicate where the present

system has fallen down with re
gard to freshman men living in
Wilbur. This article will be fol
lowed by an analysis of the defi
ciencies in the freshman women's
program.
But just what is the main objec
tive of the sponsor system? The
question seemed easier to ask
than to answer. Sponsors wres
tled with it, officials mulled it
over, and the conclusion seemed
to be that the objective was a lit
tle nebulous but they were sure
it was there.
Perhaps the fundamental and
most important purpose of ihe
present freshman living program
could be summarized from their
comments in this way: The spon
sor system should motivate and
direct freshmen toward intellec

tual fulfillment. The phrase in
tellectual fulfillment would in
clude such things as perceiving
| intellectual goals, developing a
thoughtful social orientation,
finding a meaningful concept of
individualism and other similar
objectives.
Subservient to this basic pur
pose, many other objectives were
suggested such as:
• Giving the freshmen some
one to answer procedural ques
tions in courses and registration
and to serve as a guide through
pre-reg.
• Promoting a class spirit.
• Handling freshman problems
in a convenient unit.
• Facilitating the letdown from
hig school and the transition to
'college by letting the freshmen

react among themselves to their
common problems.
• Providing housing until
freshmen are ready to go through
rush.
• (living freshmen the oppor
tunity to make friendships that
will carry through their remain
ing years regardless of later af
filiations that might be made.
• And, the presenl freshman
living program provides through
Ihe sponsors a direct liaison be
tween the Dean's office and the
individual freshmen.
A part of the problem of the
sponsor system is keeping the ob
jectives of the program from con
tradicting and in proper order
and the greatest problem is keep
ing minor purposes from overrid
ing the main objective.
