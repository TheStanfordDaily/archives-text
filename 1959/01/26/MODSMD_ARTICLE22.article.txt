# Man Fails to Understand Self: Theme of Miller s Bridge
## 
### A Review By Barkley Goldsmith 
Ailluu" Miller's A View from
Hie Bridge, starring Chester Mor
ris and now playing at the Geary,
is a lengthened version of the
original one-act which opened in
New York in 1955.
The present version tells the
story of Eddie, a likeahle and be
wildered longshoreman, and of
his excessive love for his niece,
a passion which he docs not fully
recognize until the tragic climax
of the play.
Revenge Souglil
Throughout the play Eddie al
tempts to break up a proposer)
marriage between Catherine, his
niece, and Rudolpho- one of two
Italian cousins who are living
with Eddie and his family. Eddie
feels that this line of action is
justifiable on the grounds that lie
erroneously believes Rudolpho is
something less than a man. This
action causes Eddie to lose the
love of his entire family as well

as cause an injustice to an inno
cent bystander, Marco, Rudol
pho's older brother. Marco seeks
revenge and the play moves swift
ly to its tragic conclusion.
Defiant
Miller is portraying a man in
defiant pursuit of a passion which
must invariably lead to his self
destruction. Eddie's ignorance of
his own motives prevents him
from avoiding this disaster. Mil
ler finds nobility in this man as
he exposes his sin to the world
about him. "Today," states the
lawyer who is also Miller's
spokesman, "men live by halves.
1 like it bettei this way, yet 1 note
it with alarm."
Lacks Force
This message lacks force main
ly because Eddie lacks full di
mension. Too often his violence
and anger are not convincingly
motivated by the love that we are
constantly being told is destroy
ing him from within.
This drawback is not due to
Chester Morris, who leads a very

competent cast. Within the
bounds of the script his portrayal
of Eddie is believable and sympa
thetic. Mary James is excellent
as Eddie's high-strung, harping,
yet well-meaning wife.
Well Executed
Mirando d'Ancona has directed
the play with fine emotional re
straint. In some instances, how
ever, less restraint might have in
creased Eddie's dimensions.
Nevertheless, the production
moves evenly throughout, and in
the climatic moments the cast's
intensity is absorbing. Arthur
Miller's conception of tragedy
and justice, as they revolve about
the bewildered Eddie, make for a
line evening in the theater.

as Eddie's high-strung, harping,
yet well-meaning wife.
Well Executed
Mirando d'Ancona has directed
the play with fine emotional re
straint. In some instances, how
ever, less restraint might have in
creased Eddie's dimensions.
Nevertheless, the production
moves evenly throughout, and in
the climatic moments the cast's
intensity is absorbing. Arthur
Miller's conception of tragedy
and justice, as they revolve about
the bewildered Eddie, make for a
line evening in the theater.
Ailluu" Miller's A View from
Hie Bridge, starring Chester Mor
ris and now playing at the Geary,
is a lengthened version of the
original one-act which opened in
New York in 1955.
The present version tells the
story of Eddie, a likeahle and be
wildered longshoreman, and of
his excessive love for his niece,
a passion which he docs not fully
recognize until the tragic climax
of the play.
Revenge Souglil
Throughout the play Eddie al
tempts to break up a proposer)
marriage between Catherine, his
niece, and Rudolpho- one of two
Italian cousins who are living
with Eddie and his family. Eddie
feels that this line of action is
justifiable on the grounds that lie
erroneously believes Rudolpho is
something less than a man. This
action causes Eddie to lose the
love of his entire family as well

as cause an injustice to an inno
cent bystander, Marco, Rudol
pho's older brother. Marco seeks
revenge and the play moves swift
ly to its tragic conclusion.
Defiant
Miller is portraying a man in
defiant pursuit of a passion which
must invariably lead to his self
destruction. Eddie's ignorance of
his own motives prevents him
from avoiding this disaster. Mil
ler finds nobility in this man as
he exposes his sin to the world
about him. "Today," states the
lawyer who is also Miller's
spokesman, "men live by halves.
1 like it bettei this way, yet 1 note
it with alarm."
Lacks Force
This message lacks force main
ly because Eddie lacks full di
mension. Too often his violence
and anger are not convincingly
motivated by the love that we are
constantly being told is destroy
ing him from within.
This drawback is not due to
Chester Morris, who leads a very

competent cast. Within the
bounds of the script his portrayal
of Eddie is believable and sympa
thetic. Mary James is excellent
as Eddie's high-strung, harping,
yet well-meaning wife.
