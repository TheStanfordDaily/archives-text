Stanford's hot and cold fresh
man basketball team was hot Sat
urday night in the Pavilion as it
dumped the College of Pacific
frosh 72-59.
High scorer for the Papooses
was guard Jim Bryan with 21
points. John Nicholls was high
for COP with 22 counters.
John Windsor, Stanford's 6-7
center, was held to a meager four
points as the Duke had a tough
time getting his jump shots away.
Bryan, though, took charge of the
Stanford scoring from the very
beginning, hitting for the frosh's
first six points and nine of their
first 11.
The Papooses overcame a two
point COP lead with five minutes
gone in the first half and were
never headed thereafter. The
closest that the Kittens were able
to come was near the end of the
half when they overcame a seven
point Stanford lead to make the
score 29-27 with two minutes re
maining. Nels Christ ensen fouled
COP forward Ken Vaughn, giving
him a one and one free throw at
tempt and a chance to tie the
score. Vaughn missed the first
try, however, and .Rich Hosley
and John Pontius scored for Stan
ford before the half ended, mak
ing the intermission score 33-27.
The frosh increased their lead
in the second half to 14 points
and stayed out of reach for the
remainder of the contest. The

Stanford second loam joined the
game about midway through the
last half and did*on admirable job
in keeping the persistent Kittens
from closing the gap.
