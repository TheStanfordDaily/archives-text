# Hot-Shooting Second Half Gives Tribe 66-55 Victory
## Daily Sports SCENE 
### Bob Payne 
Hot second - half shooting by
Paul Neumann, Doug Warren and
Jerry Thuesen pushed Stanford
to a 66-55 victory over tough Col
lege of the Pacific Saturday at
the Pavilion.
Trailing, 29-26, at intermission
and by as many as six points ear
ly in the second half, the Cards
pulled it out with a splurge of
dead-eye shooting in the final
minutes that left the tired Tigers
far in the distance.
Neumann popped in 25 big
points, 16 in the second half, for
high honors. The total pushed
him into seventh place in Stan
ford career scoring and only 156
points away from the 1000 figure.
Warren collected J2 points,
most of them in the clutch, and
Thuesen contributed nine impor
tant second-half markers.
Klurman Gets 20
For COP, the Coast's leading
scorer, Dave Klurman, pumped in
20 points as he hit seven of 20
tries from the field. The giant
Tiger center, Leroy Wright, saw
his nation-leading rebound aver
age cut slightly as he picked off
only 16. as compared to a yearly
mark of nearly 24 a game.
The Indians had to go without
the services of sharp - shooting
John Arrillaga, who was still suf
fering from an ankle injury re
ceived in the Cal game and did
not suit up.
The score was tied six more
times in the early going until
midway through the half when a

free throw by Gary Kaufman and
a drive by Dick Walsh pushed the
Tigers to a 17-14 advantage.
Then Klurman rifled in a long
jumper and three free throws,
answered only by single free
throws by Neumann and Dick
Haga, and COP was six points up
at 22-1(5.
Neumann registered with six
points in the closing minutes of
the half and the teams left the
floor with COP on top, 29-26.
Haga Scores
Haga brought the Tribe within
a single point as the second half
opened, scoring a fast break lay
in. Klurman then went to work,
scoring nine of 11 Tiger points
and pushing COP to a 40-34 mar
gin after five minutes of the half.
Ilaga and Neumann hit from
the key to cut the lead to 40-38,
but a free throw by Maurice
Jones and another Klurman how
itzer opened it to 43-38. That fin
ished the Tiger honeymoon.
Two free throws by Neumann
and one by Hendry cut the mar
gin to two points and then, with
12:30 left, Warren threw in a
jumper from the top of the key
and the Indians were back in busi
ness. Forty seconds later Neu
mann put the Tribe on top to stky

with a single free throw.
COP crept to within a point
once, but straight shooting by
Warren, Theusen and Neumann
continued to open the gap for the
Indians.
Second-half shooting at 15-for
-28 offset a cold first half to give
Stanford a 41 per cent field goal
mark for the game, on 2G for 63.
COP registered on 22 of G4 field
attempts for 35 per cent.
