"You are Christ's, and Christ is
God's," spoke the Rev. Joseph
Sittler in the 56th Memorial
Church Anniversary Sunday ser
mon.
Or 1 . Sillier, professor of system
atic theology at the Divinity
School, University of Chicago,
spoke on Ihe theme of Christian
humanism. Man's humanity has
got to he reconstituted by man's
revelation of man through God,

he urged.
In answer to
the hypothetical
question of what
happens to a
Christian man's
natural human
ity, he said that
"humanity is not
diminished by
belief in Christ."
Dr. Sittler
termed the apos
tle Paul a "com
plete humanist,"

saying that Paul's purpose in his
First Epistle to the Corinthians
was to "impart a secret and hid
den wisdom of God, in order that
men may be brought out of their
captivity and into themselves."
Paul had to state his case to the
Greeks with conviction, for the
Greeks sought wisdom, not sim
ply knowledge. Knowledge they
regarded as understanding their
inner selves, the nuclear struc
ture of all things, material and
metaphysical.
Men are blinded to the fact that
they are God's temple, continued
Dr. Sittler. They are unaware of
the amplitude of man's humanity.
"To deceive oneself is to ultimate
ly deny God.
"The most intoxicating delight
of any wonder of the world has
about it a holy light; when a man
receives his redemption in Christ,
it is all given back to him with a
holy light."
