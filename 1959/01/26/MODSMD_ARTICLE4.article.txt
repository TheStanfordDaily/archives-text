# Bicycle Paths Improved To Encourage Cyclists
## 
### 
Palm Drive's bicycle paths are now undergoing extensive improve
ment as a result of'the Business Office Traffic Safety Committee's
crusade to encourage the use of bicycles and reduce traffic.
The committee, concentrating first on the cast path, has begun
by moving the light at the arches at the entrance to the campus so

that it will shine outside the
arches, instead of inside as previ
ously.
Planned for the immediate fu
ture arc improvements on the
rest of the existing lighting--
change of position for lights
where trees have overgrown them
and more advantageous place
ment generally.
Lights to Be Added
Lights will also be added where
existing lights are too far apart.
One is planned for the dark re
gions between the Circle at the
entrance to Quad and Museum
Way, and roughly 200 feet past
Museum Way toward the arches.
A parking area at the Circle
will be opened in order to clear
the entrance into the paths, and
parking will he prohibited at the
pedestrian station,
Taving Deferred
The committee will wait to sec
how effective these improvements
arc before going ahead with any
more. But one big item on the
agenda which has been deferred
because of a lack of funds is the
paving of the Palm Drive paths.
A request by cyclists for a
ramp on the corner of Palm Drive
and Arboretum has been turned
down due to the danger of acci
dents when cars turn right there.
Cyclists will still have to dis
mount.
One other feature of the im
provements will be stricter police
enforcement of traffic regula
tions as soon as the work is com
pleted.
