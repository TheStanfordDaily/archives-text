# Political Struggle In Iraq

### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (/P) —A fierce
backstage political struggle for
control of Iraq is raging between
the Communists and believers in
Pan-Arabism.
It has erupted in violence in
Baghdad and elsewhere in the
country, with casualties including
at least four deaths just before
and after New Year's Day.
Until less than a fortnight ago
the Communists seemed to have
the edge on the Pan - Arabists,
with the strictly Iraqi national
ists watching from the sidelines.
Now there appears to be a
working alliance between the
Pan • Arabists and the Iraqi na
tionalists to halt any attempted
Red coup to take over the coun
try.
The key man in the picture is
General Abdel Karim Kassem,
Iraq's premier. He has just
cracked down on the Communist
dominated popular resistance mi
litia and the Red-led students' un
ion with orders virtually placing
both organizations under military
command.
Persons with access to Kassem
describe this as a turning point
and say he favors the nationalists
and is not opposed to the Pan-
Arabists.
His first concern, they say, is
the independence and welfare of
Iraq. He wants to hold off any
link or federation with the United
Arab Republic while he builds his
regime to a plane of equality.
