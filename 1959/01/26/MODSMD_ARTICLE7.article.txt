# Pope Summons World Meeting To Seek Unity
## 
### 
VATICAN CITY (/P) â€” Pope
John XXIII Sunday summoned
an ecumenical council of the Ro
man Catholic Church aimed at
uniting the Christian forces of
the world. His action was historic
and unexpected.
The wording of the Vatican
statement indicated that Chris
tian churches outside the Roman
Catholic Church may be invited
to participate in the council, at
least as observers. Ecumenical
means worldwide.
There has not been an ecumeni
cal council for nearly a century.
Such a council brings together
cardinals, archbishops and bish
ops of the church from all over
the world.
In New York, Protestant lead
ers greeted with cautious inter
est Sunday reports that Pope
John's plans for an ecumenical
council may include invitations to
other Christian churches.
The Rev. Dr. Edwin T. Dahl
bcrg, president of teh National
Council of Churches, representing
the great majority of Protestant
and Orthodox groups in this
country, said, "Anything that will
be a step toward unity of church

He added, however, that "it
would have to he recognized that
it was a mutual coming together,
not under conditions lairl down
by one church for all the others.
Protestants could not approach
such a mecling, he said, as "sepa
rated Christians" returning to the
Church of Rome.
The Pope's call of the council
at an unspecified date was inter
preted by Vatican sources as a
move toward unity, in particular
with the Russian and Greek Or
thodox churches.
