### 
WASHINGTON (JP) A Con
gressional drive to make Hawaii
the 50th state got a high speed
launching Monday before the
House Committee on Insular Af
fairs.
In an atmosphere of urgency,
Secretary of Interior Fred A. Sea
ton said that in the eyes of the
Eisenhower administration the
admission of Hawaii could not
come too soon.
Representative John W. MeCor
mack (D-Mass.l, the House Dem
ocratic floor leader, urged the
committee to hurry the statehood
bill along. He said he would do
all he could do to get a House
vote on it as quickly as possible.
Spurred by the admission of
Alaska, both Seat on and McCor
mack expressed hope the Hawaii
bill would be enacted this year.
"It is long past the hour to end
Hawaii's apprenticeship," McCor
mack said.
Seaton said Hawaii has served
an apprenticeship of 59 years in
territorial status, longer than that
of any of the present 49 states.
Opening the hearing, Commit
tee Chairman Wayne N. Aspinall
(D-Colo.) turned the gavel over
to Representative Leo W. O'Brien
(D-N.Y.), who piloted Iho Alaska
statehood bill through the House
last year.
