# POLL RESULTS
## Students Favor Present System

Compiled and Edited

Stanford students seem to like
the status quo—with only minor
changes. At least these are the
indications from the recent Daily
poll ballots returned to the Shack.
Turning in ballots were 208
members of the student body, fac
ulty and staff. Breakdowns into
groups showed the following to
tals:
Freshmen 40
Sophomores 47
Juniors 37
Seniors 32
Graduates 29
Faculty and staff 23
Totals revealed that the ballot -
ers favor the present quarter sys
tem by a wide majority—l 46 to 59
for the semester plan. However,
as the number of years of expe
rience college increased, prefer
ence for the quarter system was
narrowed.

The most common reasons giv
en for preferring the quarter sys
tem were that students liked to
relax over Christmas and spring
vacations and to begin studies
with a fresh quarter, and that
quarters offer more variety of
courses. Supporters added that
they thought the more intensive
study required during a quarter
was desirable.
Those inclined toward the se
mester felt that it gives more op
portunity to delve into a course
and it eliminates much of the ad
ministrative detail work. Several
suggested starting school about
three weeks early, in order to end
a semester at Christmas time.
This latter plan was in effect at
the University of California some
years ago. It would have definite
advantages over the present or
ganization of semesters, but it
would be extremely difficult for
one school to institute such a
plan, unless others did the same,
because of summer vacation
plans and summer schools. It
would allow students to get out
earlier in the spring to look for
jobs, but would also mean that
they would have to quit work
earlier.
Advocates of the quarter plan
also noted that quarters allow
students to take full advantage
of summer schools.
Students also were strongly in
favor of keeping mid-terms in the
schedule, although the seniors re
sponding to the poll were evenly
split on the subject.

Students said they liked mid
terms because they gave them a
chance to check up on themselves
and to know what the professor
expects them to learn from his
course.
Several suggestions were of
fered by those for and against
elimination of mid-terms. These
included a reduction of mid
terms, especially for juniors and
seniors; optional mid-terms; and

more quizzes, and substitution of
papers for the exams.
Students also objected to the
elimination of mid-terms because
they don't want their grade based
on only the final exam. They also
felt that the situation varied
greatly with the courses — in
mathematics, science and lan
guages they especially wanted
mid terms to remain.
The number of courses in the
curriculum was felt to be about
right at present by the greatest
number of those balloting, though
their view was not a majority of
all votes. Eighty-eight feel the
curriculum needs no change; 65
see the need for a decrease in
courses and 48 would like an in
crease.
It should be explained here thai
because of financial reasons it is
at present difficult to institute
more programs of independent
study. More money is needed to
provide a faculty adequate to han
dle both the present range of
courses and to counsel students
in independent and honors work.
Hence the wording of the ques
tion: "Decreased to give more
time for independent work."
Many of those balloting urged
that the number of required
courses be reduced. As one up
perclass student noted: "I've ta
ken nothing but required
courses." While acknowledging
the need for a wide range of
study, some objected to the de
mands of the General Studies
course requirements.
The closest result of the ques
tions came in response to inte
grating all four clases in their
living groups. Here the results
were 96 in favor of four-class in
tegration, and 95 against. Most
of those against four-class mixing
favor integration of classes after
the freshman year, which is the
goal of the present women's hous
ing committee.

students.
Though the fraternities and eat
ing clubs with their delayed rush
ing pose one problem to the inte
gration of men's living groups,
the majority of those favoring in
tegration can see no reason this
could not be accomplished.
(This week The Daily is run
ning a series of articles on the
sponsor system which plays a key
role in the segregated living
groups. Also this week, two Daily
staff members will present the
pros and cons of integrated liv
ing.)
The construction of a student
union was favored 168 to 22 and
most urged that moves be made
to begin work.
Most poll respondents felt they
did not know much about the
plans and others misunderstood
some of the plans. For instance,
one student was afraid the union
would be more for the student
body officers than the students.
Clarification is needed here.
The union, under its present
plans, will be built in two sections
—the first will be a pavilion for
student activities with a ballroom,
lounges, snack bars and game
rooms. A second unit will be built,
probably quite a while after Ihe
first, to house the student offi

The most common reasons giv
en for preferring the quarter sys
tem were that students liked to
relax over Christmas and spring
vacations and to begin studies
with a fresh quarter, and that
quarters offer more variety of
courses. Supporters added that
they thought the more intensive
study required during a quarter
was desirable.
Those inclined toward the se
mester felt that it gives more op
portunity to delve into a course
and it eliminates much of the ad
ministrative detail work. Several
suggested starting school about
three weeks early, in order to end
a semester at Christmas time.
This latter plan was in effect at
the University of California some
years ago. It would have definite
advantages over the present or
ganization of semesters, but it
would be extremely difficult for
one school to institute such a
plan, unless others did the same,
because of summer vacation
plans and summer schools. It
would allow students to get out
earlier in the spring to look for
jobs, but would also mean that
they would have to quit work
earlier.
Advocates of the quarter plan
also noted that quarters allow
students to take full advantage
of summer schools.
Students also were strongly in
favor of keeping mid-terms in the
schedule, although the seniors re
sponding to the poll were evenly
split on the subject.

Students said they liked mid
terms because they gave them a
chance to check up on themselves
and to know what the professor
expects them to learn from his
course.
Several suggestions were of
fered by those for and against
elimination of mid-terms. These
included a reduction of mid
terms, especially for juniors and
seniors; optional mid-terms; and

more quizzes, and substitution of
papers for the exams.
Students also objected to the
elimination of mid-terms because
they don't want their grade based
on only the final exam. They also
felt that the situation varied
greatly with the courses — in
mathematics, science and lan
guages they especially wanted
mid terms to remain.
The number of courses in the
curriculum was felt to be about
right at present by the greatest
number of those balloting, though
their view was not a majority of
all votes. Eighty-eight feel the
curriculum needs no change; 65
see the need for a decrease in
courses and 48 would like an in
crease.
It should be explained here thai
because of financial reasons it is
at present difficult to institute
more programs of independent
study. More money is needed to
provide a faculty adequate to han
dle both the present range of
courses and to counsel students
in independent and honors work.
Hence the wording of the ques
tion: "Decreased to give more
time for independent work."
Many of those balloting urged
that the number of required
courses be reduced. As one up
perclass student noted: "I've ta
ken nothing but required
courses." While acknowledging
the need for a wide range of
study, some objected to the de

course requirements.
The closest result of the ques

Students said they liked mid
terms because they gave them a
chance to check up on themselves
and to know what the professor
expects them to learn from his
course.
Several suggestions were of
fered by those for and against
elimination of mid-terms. These
included a reduction of mid
terms, especially for juniors and
seniors; optional mid-terms; and

more quizzes, and substitution of
papers for the exams.
Students also objected to the
elimination of mid-terms because
they don't want their grade based
on only the final exam. They also
felt that the situation varied
greatly with the courses — in
mathematics, science and lan
guages they especially wanted
mid terms to remain.
The number of courses in the
curriculum was felt to be about
right at present by the greatest
number of those balloting, though
their view was not a majority of
all votes. Eighty-eight feel the
curriculum needs no change; 65
see the need for a decrease in
courses and 48 would like an in
crease.
It should be explained here thai
because of financial reasons it is
at present difficult to institute
more programs of independent
study. More money is needed to
provide a faculty adequate to han
dle both the present range of
courses and to counsel students
in independent and honors work.
Hence the wording of the ques
tion: "Decreased to give more
time for independent work."
Many of those balloting urged
that the number of required
courses be reduced. As one up
perclass student noted: "I've ta
ken nothing but required
courses." While acknowledging
the need for a wide range of
study, some objected to the de
mands of the General Studies
course requirements.
The closest result of the ques
tions came in response to inte
grating all four clases in their
living groups. Here the results
were 96 in favor of four-class in
tegration, and 95 against. Most
of those against four-class mixing
favor integration of classes after
the freshman year, which is the

Students said they liked mid
terms because they gave them a
chance to check up on themselves
and to know what the professor
expects them to learn from his
course.
Several suggestions were of
fered by those for and against
elimination of mid-terms. These
included a reduction of mid
terms, especially for juniors and
seniors; optional mid-terms; and

more quizzes, and substitution of
papers for the exams.
Students also objected to the
elimination of mid-terms because
they don't want their grade based
on only the final exam. They also
felt that the situation varied
greatly with the courses — in
mathematics, science and lan
guages they especially wanted
mid terms to remain.
The number of courses in the
curriculum was felt to be about
right at present by the greatest
number of those balloting, though
their view was not a majority of
all votes. Eighty-eight feel the
curriculum needs no change; 65
see the need for a decrease in
courses and 48 would like an in
crease.
It should be explained here thai
because of financial reasons it is
at present difficult to institute
more programs of independent
study. More money is needed to
provide a faculty adequate to han
dle both the present range of
courses and to counsel students
in independent and honors work.
Hence the wording of the ques
tion: "Decreased to give more
time for independent work."
Many of those balloting urged
that the number of required
courses be reduced. As one up
perclass student noted: "I've ta
ken nothing but required
courses." While acknowledging
the need for a wide range of
study, some objected to the de
mands of the General Studies
course requirements.
The closest result of the ques
tions came in response to inte
grating all four clases in their
living groups. Here the results
were 96 in favor of four-class in
tegration, and 95 against. Most
of those against four-class mixing
favor integration of classes after
the freshman year, which is the
goal of the present women's hous
ing committee.

Stanford students seem to like
the status quo—with only minor
changes. At least these are the
indications from the recent Daily
poll ballots returned to the Shack.
Turning in ballots were 208
members of the student body, fac
ulty and staff. Breakdowns into
groups showed the following to
tals:
Freshmen 40
Sophomores 47
Juniors 37
Seniors 32
Graduates 29
Faculty and staff 23
Totals revealed that the ballot -
ers favor the present quarter sys
tem by a wide majority—l 46 to 59
for the semester plan. However,
as the number of years of expe
rience college increased, prefer
ence for the quarter system was
narrowed.

The most common reasons giv
en for preferring the quarter sys
tem were that students liked to
relax over Christmas and spring
vacations and to begin studies
with a fresh quarter, and that
quarters offer more variety of
courses. Supporters added that
they thought the more intensive
study required during a quarter
was desirable.
Those inclined toward the se
mester felt that it gives more op
portunity to delve into a course
and it eliminates much of the ad
ministrative detail work. Several
suggested starting school about
three weeks early, in order to end
a semester at Christmas time.
This latter plan was in effect at
the University of California some
years ago. It would have definite
advantages over the present or
ganization of semesters, but it
would be extremely difficult for
one school to institute such a
plan, unless others did the same,
because of summer vacation
plans and summer schools. It
would allow students to get out
earlier in the spring to look for
jobs, but would also mean that
they would have to quit work
earlier.
Advocates of the quarter plan
also noted that quarters allow
students to take full advantage
of summer schools.
Students also were strongly in
favor of keeping mid-terms in the
schedule, although the seniors re
sponding to the poll were evenly
split on the subject.
