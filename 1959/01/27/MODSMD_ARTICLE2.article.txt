# STATE TRAFFIC LAWS
## New Bills Propose Radar, Unmarked Cars, 70 Limit 
### 
SACRAMENTO (A 3 ) â€”Use of radar and unmarked patrol cars to
catch speeding motorists was proposed in the State Senate Monday.
At the same time, the senators got a bill to raise the state speed
limit to 70 miles per hour.
Senator Donald L. Grunsky (R-Watsonviile) sponsored the meas-

ures to allow the Highway Patrol
to use radar and unmarked pa
trol cars in high-accident areas.
Similar efforts in previous Legis
latures have failed.
Senator John J. Hollister (D-
Goleta t introducer! the 70-mile
speed limit bill. It would replace
the present flexible 53-mile limit,
effective next Jan. I.
Past Opposition
Grunsky said he was aware of
general opposition in the past to
radar and unmarked patrol cars.
But he said such measures arc
justified to handle unusual traffic
hazards.
Besides, he said, public atti
tudes are changing. A Senate
committee poll of drivers showed
61.2 per cent favoring unmarked
patrol cars and 68.4 per cent en
dorsing use of radar, Grunsky
said.
Kail Forfeiture
Another Grunsky bill would al
low assessment of maximum pen
alties for misdemeanor violations
by drivers who forfeit bail rather
than appear in court. It would
not constitute admission of guilt
in any subsequent civil suit.
"This will tighten up on the ha
bitual traffic offenders who have
been escaping more severe penal
ties for repeated offenses by sim
ply posting bail and forfeiting,"
said Grunsky.
