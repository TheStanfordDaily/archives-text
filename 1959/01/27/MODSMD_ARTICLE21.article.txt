# Motivation, Direction Toward Intellectual Ends Lacking

(Editor's Note: This is the
second in a series of articles
discussing the merits of the
sponsor system at Stanford.
This article concerns an evalua
tion of the success of the men's
sponsor system's objectives.)

"Motivate and direct freshmen
toward intellectual fulfillment"—
one wondered.
As the writer walked through
the Wilbur halls, stopping to talk
to a freshman or discussing the
Wilbur system with a group of
them —one just didn't have the
feeling he was talking to a group
of students who had been "moti
vated and directed."
Queries
Had Ihey voted in the freshman
election?—yes, they had voted in
the freshman election. They knew
the name of their president.
Did they like the Wilbur sys
tem of living together? yes, they
liked the Wilbur system because
they all had the same problems
and could discuss them among
themselves.
Did they know many upper
classmen?—no, they didn't really.
There was one in one of their
classes, though. Their sponsor
was an upperclassman, but he
was about the only one they real
ly knew.
What did they think of their
sponsor?—oh, they felt he was a
real nice guy. Did he have any in
fluence over Ihem? — well, not
over them personally, but they

felt some guys were influenced
by him.
Would they prefer to have
more contact with upperclass
men?—no, they thought things
were pretty good the way they
were.
Some Variance
Occasionally there was a vari
ance in the answers. One fresh
man suggested he didn't feel that
he could say if more contact with
upperclassmen would be better—
he, of course, didn't really have a
point of view to .judge by—he
hadn't really known any, he ex
plained.
While the freshmen seemed
preoccupied with their world of
Civ, English and citations, one
couldn't help feel a latent poten
tial of eagerness and energy.
When they found out the writer
was an upperclassman, he had a
hard time keeping on the asking
side of the questioning.
Frosh Questions
They wanted to know what was
the advantage of independent liv
ing. What did I think was wrong
with Wilbur? And on and on.
Then there were the answers
that were disturbing: I don't
know too much about my spon
sor; he doesn't have time to in
fluence us, he's gone most of the
time. The freshman proceeded to
explain his floor had the most
cinch notices, one of the lowest
grade point averages, the most
breakage, and a reputation for be
ing the noisiest floor.

And another: Yes, our sponsor
told us fraternity living was the
best, but he didn't recommend his
house specifically.
Separate World
What was the matter will Wil
bur? It appeared to be a separate
world, an institution apart from
the University —an appendage
that supposedly prepared its pa
tients for college life when in fact,
far from doing this, it had be
come an interim between high
school and college. For the most
it appeared to be a wasted year.
True, the Class of '62-3 or when
ever has been exalted, and fresh
men can batter their problems
back and forth and wait for a
year for the answers when some
one can challenge their errors.
Everything But
The trouble with Wilbur and
the sponsor system is that it is
doing everything but motivating
and directing the freshmen to
ward intellectual fulfillment.
But where had the main pur
pose been lost? Talking with the
sponsors gave some indication
and these findings Will be given
in tomorrow's article.
