# THE 						AMBASSADORS
## Jamesian Irony At Poignant Best 
### A Review By Joan Joffe 
Tht 1 Ambassadors by Henry
■lames. Anchor edition.
The pattern of discovery and
reunuciation, developed in James*
earlier novels, "The American"
and "Portrait of a Lady," reaches
its climax in "The Ambassadors"
and "The Wings of the Dove." N'o
where is the Jamesian irony of
renunciation more apparent and
poignant than in "The Ambassa
dor."
The extent of Lewis Lambert
Strether's European education is
his increasing realization that
"everything has come as a sort
of indistinguishable part of every
thing else," that the traditional
moral distinctions of staid Massa
chusetts cannot be made without
full knowledge of the facts, and
that when the facts are intelli
gently perceived the true moral
distinctions are seen to lie else

wh ere.
The change in Rtrelher is meas
ured by the change he notes in
Chad Newsome, the young Ameri
can he has come to Paris to
"save." Not only is this altera
tion in the boy both fascinating
and charming to St ret her, but he
discovers that Chad's lady-friend,
Mine. deVionnet, is even more
fascinating and charming. Fairly
soon, Chad appears more eager
than Strether to quit Paris.
ItemuiciatiOM
Strether's moral sensibility is
at first shocked to learn that this
liaison is the affair that Chad's
mother supposed it, but it is not
on that account immoral. In fact,
Chad's affair with Mme. deVion
net is virtuous just in proportion
to the good effect it has had on
Chad. And on Strether. Strether
has the sense, however, of being
too old to act upon tho now
awareness of his own moral na
ivete except to ease things for oth
ers. When Chad finally leaves for
America, mission accomplished,
Strether discerns further' that he
cannot share in the fruits he ear
lier anticipated.
His Burden
Like Christopher Newman in
"The American" who renounces
revenge, like Isabel Archer in
"Portrait of a Lady" who, at last
undeceived, returns to the odious
duty of being Gilbert Osmond's
wife, and like Merton Densher in
"The Wings of the Dove" who
must renounce both Kate's hand
and Milly's legacy in order to live
more honestly with himself,
Strether is caught with the bur
den of moral responsibility.
Correction Not Made
The contemporary reader is for
tunate to have James increasing
ly available in paperback reprint.
Not only is this new Anchor edi
tion significant for bringing a
major American novelist to his
public inexpensively, but it per
petuates an editorial embarrass
ment. Although the back cover
announces that it has correcled
"an error which has been com
mon to all American editions of
the novel the reversal of the se
quence of two chapters (XXVII
and XXIX)," the correction is, in
fact, not made in the text.
Register Protest
Arc we then to renounce and
eschew the new Anchor edition?
I think not, for if one wishes,
with little inconvenience one may
read the chapters in their proper
order. "The Ambassadors," a ma
jor James novel, stands as com
ment not only on American moral
experience but on larger human
perceptions and values. Without
condescension one ought, as
Strether does, to buy the experi
ence, savor the meaning, and reg
ister sensitive and sensible pro
test against human fallibility.

The change in Rtrelher is meas
ured by the change he notes in
Chad Newsome, the young Ameri
can he has come to Paris to
"save." Not only is this altera
tion in the boy both fascinating
and charming to St ret her, but he
discovers that Chad's lady-friend,
Mine. deVionnet, is even more
fascinating and charming. Fairly
soon, Chad appears more eager
than Strether to quit Paris.
ItemuiciatiOM
Strether's moral sensibility is
at first shocked to learn that this
liaison is the affair that Chad's
mother supposed it, but it is not
on that account immoral. In fact,
Chad's affair with Mme. deVion
net is virtuous just in proportion
to the good effect it has had on
Chad. And on Strether. Strether
has the sense, however, of being
too old to act upon tho now
awareness of his own moral na
ivete except to ease things for oth
ers. When Chad finally leaves for
America, mission accomplished,
Strether discerns further' that he
cannot share in the fruits he ear
lier anticipated.
His Burden
Like Christopher Newman in
"The American" who renounces
revenge, like Isabel Archer in
"Portrait of a Lady" who, at last
undeceived, returns to the odious
duty of being Gilbert Osmond's
wife, and like Merton Densher in
"The Wings of the Dove" who
must renounce both Kate's hand
and Milly's legacy in order to live
more honestly with himself,
Strether is caught with the bur
den of moral responsibility.

Not only is this new Anchor edi
