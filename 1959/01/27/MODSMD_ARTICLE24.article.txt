# SU Judo Team Improving Fast
## 
### John Osmundson 
To be ranked as a potential na
tional c h a m p 1 on in a sport
learned one term previous is rap
id progress for any athlete. Even
more startling is the fact that the
entire Stanford judo team has ac
complished this feat.
Started last term as an ex peri
mental physical education class,
judo has become Stanford's new
est intercollegiate sport. Thirty
five men took Beginning Judo
last quarter, and all but 10 are
now enrolled in the advanced
class.
Stanford's recognition as a top
college judo team came after
seven of the students entered a
recent Northern California novice
judo tournament. The Indians

won two first places and one
third; San Jose State, considered
the strongest college team in the
nation, won a single third place.
Competitors were matched in
four weight divisions. Don Pew
thers won first in the unlimited
class, Clayton Lee won at 130
pounds and Bob Dulong placed
third in the 180-lh. division. Stan
ford didn't h«ve an entry in the
remaining IfSO-lb. classification.
Responsible for the team's re
markable showing are instructor
Hideo Sato and assistant instruc
tors Ben Campbell and Greg
Knapp. Sato graduated from San
Jose where he was captain ol the
judo team.
belts are awarded for judo
skill. Novices with no experience
hold white belts. As more skill is
developed the white belt is ex
changed for a third degree brown
belt. Brown belts range up 1o
first degree and the nexl levels
are the black bells which proceed
from first degree to tenth degree.
Judo requires no prerequisites.
Since the sport's movements are
entirely unlike those of any other
sport, everyone starts on an equal
footing. Balance and timing, not
strength, are important factors.
National collegiate champion
ships will be held in May at San
Jose. Knapp and Campbell and
some students plan to enter. Al
though the team is strong in nov
ice divisions, men with previous
judo experience are needed if
Stanford is to be more than a
potential champion this year.
Northern California brown belt
championships will be held Feb.
7 in San Francisco. Matches with
Santa Clara, San Jose and Cali
fornia are planed prior to the
brown belt championships.

brown belt championships.
To be ranked as a potential na
tional c h a m p 1 on in a sport
learned one term previous is rap
id progress for any athlete. Even
more startling is the fact that the
entire Stanford judo team has ac
complished this feat.
Started last term as an ex peri
mental physical education class,
judo has become Stanford's new
est intercollegiate sport. Thirty
five men took Beginning Judo
last quarter, and all but 10 are
now enrolled in the advanced
class.
Stanford's recognition as a top
college judo team came after
seven of the students entered a
recent Northern California novice
judo tournament. The Indians

won two first places and one
third; San Jose State, considered
the strongest college team in the
nation, won a single third place.
Competitors were matched in
four weight divisions. Don Pew
thers won first in the unlimited
class, Clayton Lee won at 130
pounds and Bob Dulong placed
third in the 180-lh. division. Stan
ford didn't h«ve an entry in the
remaining IfSO-lb. classification.
Responsible for the team's re
markable showing are instructor
Hideo Sato and assistant instruc
tors Ben Campbell and Greg
Knapp. Sato graduated from San
Jose where he was captain ol the
judo team.
belts are awarded for judo
skill. Novices with no experience
hold white belts. As more skill is
developed the white belt is ex
changed for a third degree brown
belt. Brown belts range up 1o
first degree and the nexl levels
are the black bells which proceed
from first degree to tenth degree.
Judo requires no prerequisites.
Since the sport's movements are
entirely unlike those of any other
sport, everyone starts on an equal
footing. Balance and timing, not
strength, are important factors.
National collegiate champion
ships will be held in May at San
Jose. Knapp and Campbell and
some students plan to enter. Al
though the team is strong in nov
ice divisions, men with previous
judo experience are needed if
Stanford is to be more than a
potential champion this year.
Northern California brown belt
championships will be held Feb.
7 in San Francisco. Matches with
Santa Clara, San Jose and Cali
fornia are planed prior to the
brown belt championships.
