# THE 						FINISH LINE
## Snowed In 
### Dick Barnes 
The Stanford sports scene of
the past week end centered on
two widely separated fronts the
campus and Yoseniite. Campus
activity wasn't anything very
unique a basketball game and an
A At! developmental track meet.
But Yoseniite that was a dif
ferent story. More than 500 Stan
fordites got together for a week
end of skiing and socializing that
must go down as Stanford's best
Winter Carnival in years.
As an all-campus function, it
was a tremendous success. The
planning of Berk Johnson and Bob
Roberts, the excellent cooperation
from the Yosemite and Curry
Company people and the enthusi
astic response of the half a thou
sand produced an activity that is,
unfortunately, a rarity around
here.
Just from the standpoint of be
ing out in the open and getting
some plain old-fashioned physical
exercise, the week end was worth
while. Midterm and term-paper
pressures seem to keep far too
many cooped up in a dark hole
somewhere.
A quick look at any of a num
ber of reports from research
teams shows what an out-of-shape
nation the United States is get
ting to be- and it's probably
worse among book-laden college
students than most. Of course,
two days of activity won't put
anyone in tiptop condition, but
it's a start—and 500 can testify
THAT's darned refreshing.
A nice thing about the ski week
end was that there were more
than just the seasoned old pros in
attendance. Badger Pass's Bunny
Hill was covered with first-timers
— and all were having a blast,
though they might have been
laughing from a sitz-mark.
The range in ability ran all the
way from sophomore Jerene Vix,
who took first place in the female
division of the Fresno Bee Silver
Ski competition on Sunday, to the
red-faced freshmen who fell every
time they tried to negotiate the
rope toe.
We could launch into the strict
ly non-sports aspects of the week
end like the .lime C hristie pro
gram, or the far-superior-to-cam
pus food. But we'll leave those
details to word -of • mouth from
those who went.
Just one note remains to be
added the note directed at who
ever has or will have anything to
do with future ski week ends:
don't let what might become a
tremendous tradition die on the
vine.
