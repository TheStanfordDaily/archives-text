things to sayabout the Indians' star guard Paid Neumann at the San
Francisco sports writers' weekly luncheon on Monday.

ers he has ever seen. He went on in say that the flashy Indian back
court star can do everything well. Neumann now has only 1~>(> points
to score in order to reach a total ol loot) points in his three-year ca
reer. lie will have nine games in which to turn the trick.
The Card mentor said that he thinks his team's away games
against Oregon and Washington 1 his weekend are going to be tough

contests to win. Oregon has the
second top rebounder in the
league in Stu Roberlson, whereas
Washington's Dong Smart leads
the PCC in both scoring and re
bounding.
