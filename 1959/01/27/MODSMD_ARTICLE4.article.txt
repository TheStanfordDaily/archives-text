# ‘Real Beat’ Chappie
## 
### 
I mean, like man, this is Ihe
most. The Chappie, I mean.
The Bagel Shop, and most of
its occupants, have been writ
ing for ages, and everybody
knows that occupants of the
Bagel Shop are usually unpub
lished poets.
The Chappie, full of sympa
thy for Ihe struggling young
writers, has decided to publish
some of their material. Natu
rally, their edition for this
month is to be their Beatnik
edition.
This issue, on sale Wednes
day, is to contain a few pearls
of wisdom, much like Ihe works
(if Ginsberg and T. S. Eliot. For
those of us who are really in*
tercsled in ihe inner thoughts
of the inhabitants of North
Beach, this should prove most
stimulating.
