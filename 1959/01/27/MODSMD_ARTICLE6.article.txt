# NECESSITY
## Draft Due For Boost In Future 
### 
WASHINGTON (/p)_The De
fense Department told Congress
Monday the draft law must be
extended to prevent a dangerous
drop-off in enlistments.
Asst. Sec. of Defense Charles C.
Finucane gave this argument in
urging that the draft be extended
for four years. It now is due to
die on June 30.
After listening to Finucane,
Chairman Carl Vinson (D-Ga. > of
the House Armed Services Com
mittee said "we have no choice.
I hope there will be no hesitancy"
in extending the draft.
Prolongation Vote
This was one of several indica
tions the committee would vote to
prolong the draft. But there was
no assurance it would be contin
ued for four years. There have
been suggestions the extension be
limited to two years.
And before the committee acts,
it appeared likely Secretary of
Defense Neil McElroy and other
officials of the armed forces will
have to do some explaining about
military manpower cutbacks put
into effect despite objections from
Congress.
Who Ordered Cut?
Vinson said that when the De
fense Secretary appears later on,
McElroy will be asked to explain
who ordered the Army cut to 870,-
000 men after Congress had pro
vided funds for 900,000 and had
made clear it wanted the army
kept at that size.
Finucane insisted that, without
the draft, the armed services
would fall short "700,000 or 800,-
000 from our total of about 2VL>
million."
Only the Army now is using
the draft, and it obtains some of
its recruits through volunteering.
Cut Finucane said that without
the draft, enlistment in all the
services would fall off dangerous
ly.
