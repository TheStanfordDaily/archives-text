# Watson's High Twirls Answer a Question
## 
### Gary Wright 
An age-old question was an
swered at last night's Tuesday
Evening Series as a few high
twirls revealed the black pants
under Bobby Watson's seven and
a half yards of kilts.
Watson ably displayed his skill
at the art of country folk dancing
as he went through his amazing
routines in top form. Dancing to
his own taped bagpipe playing,
Watson made a few appropriate
remarks concerning the central
heating and tiie fact t hat his
"breath kept coming in short
pants."
Amusing
Watson made a good example
of a little-known dancing form,
putting his program over in an
amusing fashion.
On the end of his three-week
tour - of the U.S. and Canada, Wat
son was most sincere in his point
ed comments concerning his re
ception by American audiences.
He also had a bit of his own fun
with the English, Irish and Welsh
in the audience, almost succeed
ing in getting a lively foursome
to help him out on stage.
Honored Skill
Folk dancing is a complex and
honored skill in Scotland, backed
up by cetnuries of tradition. The
familiar Highland Fling forms
the base for the development of
all the dances.
Soldiers lifted a ban on kilts
with a "Dance of Trousers" and
eager military officers enrolled
men in the army with a subtle
"Wilt Thou Come to the Barracks,
Johnny?"
Distinction Made
He made a distinction between
Scottish and Irish dancing, how
ever, finally showing off the fa
miliar "Irish Washerwoman" and
a combination Scotch-Irish jig.
Watson jokingly put a noted em
phasis on ihc Scotch portion, giv
ing traditional Scotch claims to
the folk dancing field.
Running his own school in Ab
erdeen, Scotland, some of his pu
pils are in the three-year-old and
under bracket. A good sized, good
natured and talented man, Wat
son himself started dancing at the
age of two and a half.
"Diddling"
As he had left some of his tapes
at home, he had to hum, or "did
dle," some of his numbers'. So
with a packed Memorial Audito
rium "diddling" behind him, Wat
son proceeded with his preci
sioned skill.
Winding up with a "Celtic mix
ture," Watson took up his bag
pipes and concluded with a tra
ditional march, leaving a pleased
audience with a "wee" more ap
preciation of the Scotch.
