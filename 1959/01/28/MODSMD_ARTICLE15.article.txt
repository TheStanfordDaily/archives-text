WASHINGTON (/P)—Air Force
leaders nominated Tuesday Hie
Minuteman - an ocean-spanning
missile that can he hidden away
underground until needed —as the
weapon most likely to overcome
Russia's menacing military pow
er.
It should be put into quantity
production, because it is smaller
and cheaper than other intercon
tinental ballistic missiles, said
General Thomas D. White, Air
Force chief of staff.
White said the Minuteman, un
like other ICBM's, such as the
Alias and Titan, which are pow
ered by liquid fuels, uses solid
propellants and is comparatively
low in cost and easy to maintain
and operate. Solid fuels are eas
ier to handle and less dangerous
than liquids now used in most big
missiles.
