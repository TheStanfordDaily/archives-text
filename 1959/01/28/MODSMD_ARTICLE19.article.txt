# Soviet Union Now Producing ICBM's
## 
### 
MOSCOW (Â£ J ) Premier Khrushchev opened the 21st Congress of
the Soviet Communist party Tuesday by announcing the Soviet
Union has intercontinental ballistic missiles in serial production. But
he said the main Soviet objective is to end the cold war and inter
national tension.

The "task of tasks," he said, is to achieve nuclear disarmament,

"to learn to solve contentious
problems by peaceful talks" and
to base international relations on
peaceful coexistence.
Hp again said Russia is ready
to ban for all time the building
and testing of rockets as well as
nuclear weapons, and to destroy
all stockpiles of these weapons.
His announcement on the pro
duction of the big missiles was in
these words:
"In the Soviet Union the serial
production of intercontinental
ballistic missiles has been organ
ized."
The premier's claim touched on
a controversy in the United
States where Defense Secretary
McElroy on Jan. 22 disputed with
critics of President Eisenhower's
budget. He said the Defense De
partment does not believe the So
viet Union has an operational
ICBM, or that she would have 300
of them in stock by 1960. The
White House had no comment
Tuesday on the Khrushchev state
ment.
