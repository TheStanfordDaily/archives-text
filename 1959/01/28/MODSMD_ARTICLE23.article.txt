# Segregation Helps
## 
### Rita Robison 
Freshman women's dorms are not a case of
"There's no reason for ii; it's company policy."
Adjustment to a resident university entails prob
lems above and beyond those of the transition from
high school to college. All hough segregation of

freshman women has not solved
all of these, it has helped.
University academic require
ments are much stiffer than those
in most high schools. Generally
freshmen find themselves making
C's or worse when they have pre
viously gone straight A. Due to
the curve, their competition in
most courses is their own peer
group; at the dorm they soon dis
cover that everyone is having
trouble "making the grade."
Small Comfort
There would be other freshmen
in integrated dorms, of course,
but it is unlikely that any of them
would have the same Civ or Eng
lish teachers. Upperclass women,
busy with their activities and ma
jors, might feel they simply didn't
have time to be a big sister. Their
kind, but brief "Dig in; things gel
easier as you learn the system"
isn't much comfort when you look
at your first D's and wonder if
you have what it takes for Stan
ford.
Freshman women's dorms have
a system of corridor and house of
ficers and activities which give
girls limited responsibilities but
don't take too much time. Cam
pus organizations are explained;
new people are met during ex
changes. Freshman women have
a chance to realize that at Stan
ford you can't be in everything,
go out all the time, and maintain
passing marks and your health.
Co to Extremes
Upperclassmen have usually de
cided whether they want to con
centrate their time and energy in
the academic, social or "avoca
tional" realm. For a freshman
woman living on the Row, or
among drama majors or "intellec
tuals," the tendency to go to ex
tremes before determining her
own limits and capabilities could
be unfortunately common.
Let's not forget the freshman
men. The myth persists that even
if freshman women are not "all
dated up" they would prefer to
go out with an upperclassman.
For the determined frosh man.
exchanges with a freshman corri
dor are available; he can arrange
a blind date with a Roble or Bran
ner girl without fear of her be
ing an upperclass woman.
Prospects are good for the
future integration of all four
classes. In the past two years up
perclass women have shown in
creasing interest in the "big sis
ter" aspect of the sponsor system.
However, the present small pro
portion of upperclas women will
ing to assume the responsibilities
of being a big sister, and the in
dication by the freshman women
themselves that they are not
wholeheartedly in favor of being
integrated, would seem to indi
cate that four class integration in
women's housing should be insti
tuted only when a recognizable
majority of women really want
it.
