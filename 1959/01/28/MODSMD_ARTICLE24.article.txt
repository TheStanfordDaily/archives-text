# Integrate Now

There are two aspects to the question of living
group integration of all four classes. Is it desir
able? And, is it feasible?
It wouldn't solve all our undergraduate prob
lems, but it would lessen some of them.

The mixing of all four classes
would seem to be desirable first
of all as an aid to quicker and
easier transition from high school
to Stanford.
Freshmen do have some con
cerns not generally faced by up
perclassmen. Having freshmen
live together is supposed, among
other things, to make them feel
more secure by association with
others who share similar experi
ences and problems. But in fact
freshman living frequently mag
nifies the normal ups and downs
of a new experience into an enor
mous problem of "adjustment."
The demoralizing thing about
freshman living is the sameness
of it: the same classes, same
friends, same kinds of social ac
tivities.
Find Out Sooner
Some freshmen don't fit natu
rally into lhe mold this sameness
engenders. If these were exposed
to the rest of the campus their
first year they would find out
sooner that there are all kinds of
people and ways of living here,
and among them something to
suit nearly anyone.
Other freshmen thoroughly en
joy the freshman experience at
the time. But many of these find
at some point during their other
three years that there are many
fine things here they wish they'd
been exposed to a little earlier,
which they never knew about as
freshmen.
Expose to Variety
But it is far better to expose the
newcomer initially to enough of
a variety that he can more quick
ly and easily find a comfortable
niche from which to get the most
out of his undergraduate years,
than to make him undergo two
'transitions: one to being a Stan
ford freshman, and the other to
joining the rest of the University.
Class unity is no doubt assisted
by freshman living, but after the
first year most students find that
they are more interested in vari
ous people and things here.
Integration of all four classes
would probably necessitate some
sort of "big brother and sister"
arrangement, employed success
fully at many colleges across the
country, to help freshmen find
their way around here the first
few weeks.
