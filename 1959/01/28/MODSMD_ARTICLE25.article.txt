# AWS Gives Background On Housing
## 
### 
Seeking a workable plan for
women's housing, the AWS Hous
ing Committee is urging women
students to develop such a pro
gram.
In order to provide background
for discussion and thinking, the
committee is presently circulating
a list of goals for the residence
hall program and a fact sheet on
each of the women's residences.
Historically the primary func
tion of university residences has
been provision of food and lodging
for students, at economical rates
and under culturally acceptable
conditions.
For contemporary Stanford, res
idences should specifically pro
vide:
• Adequate space and facilities
for the student to sleep, eat and
study.
• A means of communication
between officer-s of the Univer
sity and the individual students.
• An intellectual and friendly
atmosphere conducive to high
scholastic interest and achieve
ment.
• Stimulation of interest in cul
tural activities.
• Opportunity for closer associ
ation with the faculty.
• Opportunity for each student
to choose, within the limitations
of practical necessities, the group
with whom he will associate.
• Opportunity for the develop
ment of student leadership.
• A varied social program.
• Adequate recreation outlets.
Women's residence capacities
include 360 in Lagunita, 290 on
the Row as a whole, 350 in Flor
ence Moore and 80 in Union.
Statistics compiled at the end of
the second week of autumn quar
ter showed: no seniors, 7 juniors,
344 sophomores and 10 freshmen
living in Lagunita; 62 sopho
mores, 208 juniors and 64 seniors
in Florence Moore (there are also
freshmen in Moore, though this
was not included in the report);
no sophomores, 81 juniors and 211
seniors on the Row; and 16 sopho
mores, 26 juniors and 38 seniors
in Union.
Gavilon of Florence Moore and
Union had the most class integra
tion —18 sophomores, 13 juniors
and 13 seniors in Gavilon —and
the other individual units were
predominantly one class or an
other.
The details are given on the
fact sheets distributed by the
AWS, and committee members
urge that these be reviewed as
women organize their housing
plans.
