# TONIGHT
## At the Symphony 
### Diana Smith 
The overture to Rossini's opera
"The Siege of Corinth" will open
tonight's San Francisco Sympho
ny concert. The overture is the
latest in an everlasting procession
of San Francisco musical firsts;
this one is billed as "First Per
formance at Regular Concerts."
Violinist Henryk Szeryng
plays the Mozart Concerto for vio
lin and orchestra, No. 3 in G ma
jor, K. 216, and Ravel's "Tzigane,"
rhapsody for violin and orchestra.
A native of Warsaw, Szeryng
made an early musical impression
and in the '30's played a circuit of
European capitals, including War
saw. Bucharest, Vienna and Paris.
After a period of concentrated
composing, Szeryng played for
the Allied armed services during
the war and for Central and South

American audiences. The United
States did not hear him until 1957.
Szeryng has recorded widely in
Europe, most notably Bach violin
solo pieces; his first American re
cordings are to be released this
year.
The orchestra will also perform
Schumann's Symphony No. 4 in
D minor, Op. 120. Actually writ
ten in part before his second sym
phony, the fourth was completed
and performed later and is con
ceded the most unified of the
symphonies of Schumann, a com
poser generally more comfortable
with piano music than wilh the
larger forms.
The Concert Series continues its
weekly symphony ticket exchange
service. Tickets may be left for
sale or bought daily at the Nitery,
1 to 5 p.m.
