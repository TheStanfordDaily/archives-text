# Continuity?

a
"CoN'TINI ITV*" is a word which is now frequently heard in women's
living; "roups. The discussion has arisen from attempts by the
University to make some sense out of the jumble of women's
housing.
And it has been a jumble. For, though experimentation is
not in itself unfruitful, the experiments in women's housing these
past years have left everyone confused as to what the women want
in their living groups and how to go about achieving these desires.
"Continuity" is the latest expression used in attempt
ing to clarify policies, liefore ice decide on llie merits
of continuity. ice must determine its meaning, or per Imps
ii hat it floes not mean.
Continuity does not mean thai women will he placed in a dorm
at the beginning of their sophomore year, there to stay until grad
uation no matter what.
To the Administration unless we have misplaced our faith
in them it means an attempt to discard the notion that a woman
must change her residence at the end of each year. Under the
present drawing system, this notion becomes reality, for freshmen
and sophomores must draw at the end of each year. If they are
placed in a dorm which they do uol like, they have an opportunity
to remedy the situation; hut if they do like their residence, under
the present plan, lliey could be forced to move at the end of the
year.
Willi a plan which incorporates continuity, women would not
have to move out of a dorm thev liked. But certainly the I niver
sitv will not he so ogre-like as to effect a plan which says a woman
may not move out of a dorm she does not like.
l aiilities vary in the different dorms, to he sure, but
so do women s tastes in resiliences. Some uomen like the
How, some do not: some iconld like to live in Lag, some
would not.
(ioutinuitv does not mean that students would become a stag
nant group because they lived with the same people for more than
a year. There is a constant turnover of students through gradu
ation, marriage, travel so that new people move into a residence
frequently. And certainly, a woman with any spirit should not
feel bound to associate with the same people all tin' time.
Advantages of staving in the same dorm more than a year in
clude a familiarity with the surroundings and, hopefully, the de
velopment of the feeling that a woman can make a residence her
"home," rather than her room for the year. She can develop a
close, but not closed, circle of friends.
The friends and acquaintances of a student are. not
necessarily increased by jretpient changes of residence.
If continuity means women MUST stay in the same residence
for three years, we are against it: but if it means they CA\. and
are encouraged to do so through increasing beneficial contacts
provided hv a more stable plan—and we think it does then v\c
give it our support and urge the women students to work out a
plan which corresponds to these goals.
