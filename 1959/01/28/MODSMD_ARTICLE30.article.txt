the sponsor system.)

"Beer, Booze, Broads, Bardot,
Brawls, Beds occupied. . . . For
more information, send to | fra
ternity box number]. Sent in a
plain wrapper."
"Please do not erase" was the
last line of the message on a
blackboard which was in front of
a fireplace in a Wilbur lounge.
It was a joke, of course. Some
freshman had written it there.
One safe conclusion might be
drawn from this note on the board
freshmen were thinking about
rushing. The sponsors confirmed
this and admitted quite frankly
that freshmen discussed it with
them.
Definite Influence
There wasn't much doubt in the
sponsors' minds that they have a
definite influence over the fresh
men, and most felt they were
bound to influence them as they
went through rushing simply by
the fact that they were the only
upperclassmen in most instances
which the freshmen knew well.
Of the 21 sponsors, 21 are fra
ternity men.
Rushing' Adequate?
The question was asked of some
sponsors whether they thought
rushing would give the freshmen
an adequate picture of the hous
ing possibilities, and even the
sponsors most dedicated to the
system responded negatively.
Now, what does all this have to
do with trying to determine where
the main purpose of the sponsor
system of motivating and direct
ing freshmen toward intellectual
fulfillment has been lost? It is
offered to illustrate the extent to
which freshmen are cut off from
the campus and the relevance and
importance of this fact.
The main thing that this exam
ple points up is that the sponsor
system fails in this way: the spon
sors simply can't be tlie whole
University to the freshmen.
There is a hint here also of
how the sponsor system falls
down in another way.
Position Voiced
It was learned that one night,
last week the sponsors met and
discussed for 2 1 n hours what their
position in rushing should be. The
results were three resolutions:
sponsors will not provide lists of
"good" and "bad" freshmen to
their house; they will not take
part, in "ding" meetings; sponsors

are nol to urge freshmen to join
any fraternity.
Is there any real reason why
sponsors should have to discuss a
rushing policy for 2 1 !; hours—or
at all, for that matter?
Altitude is a difficult thing to
criticize, and it wouldn't be cor
rect to say sponsors are complete
ly at fault for the failings of the
Wilbur system. They can't be ex
pected to bear the entire burden
of motivating and directing fresh
men students must be challeng
ed in classes and by the entire
atmosphere of the University.
Hut sponsors certainly stand at
a critical point in the edifice.
When his personal concerns, when
a sponsor's living affiliation seem
more important than the sponsor
program in which he fills such a
vital part it is time for the spon
sor to re-evaluate his position, to
restructure his own scale of val
ues, putting first things first.
Because of the position he holds,
sponsoring should be, in the view
of this writer, his first concern —
indeed, his only concern.
Part of the answers to the prob
lems we have been dealing with
in these 1 hi ee articles can be
found within the construction of
the present system and within the
•sponsors themselves.
Suggestions will follow Camille
Petersen's analysis of the wom
en's sponsor system, which begins
Thursday.

in these 1 hi ee articles can be
found within the construction of
the present system and within the

third in a series of articles on
the sponsor system.)

"Beer, Booze, Broads, Bardot,
Brawls, Beds occupied. . . . For
more information, send to | fra
ternity box number]. Sent in a
plain wrapper."
"Please do not erase" was the
last line of the message on a
blackboard which was in front of
a fireplace in a Wilbur lounge.
It was a joke, of course. Some
freshman had written it there.
One safe conclusion might be
drawn from this note on the board
freshmen were thinking about
rushing. The sponsors confirmed
this and admitted quite frankly
that freshmen discussed it with
them.
Definite Influence
There wasn't much doubt in the
sponsors' minds that they have a
definite influence over the fresh
men, and most felt they were
bound to influence them as they
went through rushing simply by
the fact that they were the only
upperclassmen in most instances
which the freshmen knew well.
Of the 21 sponsors, 21 are fra
ternity men.
Rushing' Adequate?
The question was asked of some
sponsors whether they thought
rushing would give the freshmen
an adequate picture of the hous
ing possibilities, and even the
sponsors most dedicated to the
system responded negatively.
Now, what does all this have to
do with trying to determine where
the main purpose of the sponsor
system of motivating and direct
ing freshmen toward intellectual
fulfillment has been lost? It is
offered to illustrate the extent to
which freshmen are cut off from
the campus and the relevance and
importance of this fact.
The main thing that this exam
ple points up is that the sponsor
system fails in this way: the spon
sors simply can't be tlie whole
University to the freshmen.
There is a hint here also of
how the sponsor system falls
down in another way.
Position Voiced
It was learned that one night,
last week the sponsors met and
discussed for 2 1 n hours what their
position in rushing should be. The
results were three resolutions:
sponsors will not provide lists of
"good" and "bad" freshmen to
their house; they will not take
part, in "ding" meetings; sponsors

are nol to urge freshmen to join
any fraternity.
Is there any real reason why
sponsors should have to discuss a
rushing policy for 2 1 !; hours—or
at all, for that matter?
Altitude is a difficult thing to
criticize, and it wouldn't be cor
rect to say sponsors are complete
ly at fault for the failings of the
Wilbur system. They can't be ex
pected to bear the entire burden
of motivating and directing fresh
men students must be challeng
ed in classes and by the entire
atmosphere of the University.
Hut sponsors certainly stand at
a critical point in the edifice.
When his personal concerns, when
a sponsor's living affiliation seem
more important than the sponsor
program in which he fills such a
vital part it is time for the spon
sor to re-evaluate his position, to
restructure his own scale of val
ues, putting first things first.
Because of the position he holds,
sponsoring should be, in the view
of this writer, his first concern —
indeed, his only concern.
