The Tragedy of a Quarterback
Sometimes people get so convinced about .something that they
are pretty blind to see anything that may happen to ihe contrary.
The City sports press is the latest to be stricken.
Hem: Joe Kapp is overlooked 208 times and drafted on the 18th
round ol' ihe National Football League draft by the Washington
Kedskins. Result: Several San Francisco sporlswriters, in so many
words, claim that 12 teams of professional football coaches and scouts
don't know what they are doing.
The writers were no doubt a bit incensed by life fact that in the
days leading up to the draft they had devoted a good deal of the
space in their columns to the fact that Joe Kapp wanted very much
to play American professional football, and that he woidd make it
Kplit-T quarterback or not.
Evidently, nobody in tho league was right about Joe. Or youM
come to believe that if you read the papers.
Saturday, one writer let his hair down:

"Joe Kapp in our opinion will,
in three years, become one of I he
top passers in pro ball it he gets
the opportunity to work regular
ly at the job. . . •. Though be
passed little down there (the
Hose Bowl) important coaches
told us be bad all (lie makings.
. . . For two years Joe lias been
working all hours, not on his
passing, hut on that run-lateral
Slit-T play. . . . Such boys as
|Boh| Newman and Randy Dun
tan rated as great passers be
cause they threw leii to Joe's one,
to better catchers. . .
Another writer interpreted
things a little bit inaccurately:
". . . 208 players were drafted
before Kapp got a tumble. It is
difficult for us to believe that
there were that many college
players better than Kapp among
last year's slender crop. . . ."
Why all the fuss? Joe probably
wishes now that he'd never seen
a sportswriter. It would be inler-

esting 1o know how many of his
expressions of disgust were his own, and how many were put in his
mouth by the scribes. Kapp proved last year he is a great leader,
and maybe these qualities will make him a good pro. But I doubt
if he needs the help of the press.
Don't Kid Us —dels i\o Unitas
Although he was one of the few Bears who came out of the Rose
Howl looking like something more than a child among men, his pass
ing at Pasadena was sorry. And this against a team whose one
major weakness was reported to be pass defense.
As for this Split-T business, maybe the pros weren't thinking of
the Hums' unpleasant experience with Minnesota's Bobby Cox, an
other do-everything. Cox was one of L.A.'s earliest choices—as a
"red-shirt" junior—in the draft two years ago. He didn't even stay
with the club through the full exhibition season.
Nevertheless, the pros took a chance on Cox. And Paul Hornung
of Notre Dame, the bonus choice two years ago, was a Split-T quar
terback in college.
The possibility remains, of course, that Kapp won't even be a
quarterback in the pros. Hornung, who was a fine college passer but
nevertheless ran more than he passed at Notre Dame, is now a com
petent fullback for Green Bay. Another jack-of-all-trades college
signal caller, Jerry Reichow of lowa, was converted to an end with
Detroit.
Kapp always showed great ability as a Split-T runner. Whether
he is a fullback-type runner, or has the speed for an end, is doubtful,
however.
There couldn't have been a better choice for the Pop Warner
Award than Joe Kapp. He tn -1 y was one of the most valuable team
men in college football and anything but the 209 th best player in
the land. But somehow, I place a little more confidence in the opin
ions of the 12 most powerful football organizations in the world than
in the heat-of-the-moment feelings of a hurt City press.
More News Than Joe, Though
THE SPORT AT HAND —BASKETBALL—Item: Stanford heads
north for important PCC basketball games With Oregon and Wash
ington.
These are real "croo-shuls." This weekend will leave the Cards
with six home games and only two road games left in conference
play. Friday, they will meet up with probably the most improved
team in the PCC, Oregon. Saturday, it's a battle in Seattle against
red-hot Washington.
Item: Oregon State guard Lee Harnian shatters loop field goal
record with a sizzling 12-for-M display against Washington State.
The latest, and now certainly, the biggest, challenger to Stanford's
Paul Neumann as the loop's best guard, Harnian must rate as the
league's most improved player. Although always a good floor man
and driver, he showed real difficulty last year in making a basket
from anywhere outside of lay-in range.
He hit 33 earlier this season as the Beavers lopped Iowa; last
week he threw in ,59 points in a pair of games againsl WSC and
Idaho. So far - , the Biggest Surprise of the Season.
Item: Brnno Boin scores 14 for Washington against Oregon.
This season, that represents a pretty big night for Bruno. About
all the (!-9 spire has shown this year is that he can be defensed.
Dalhnar sized if up: "Boin isn't going to bother yon too much
as long as you can get u man in front of him and bother him, keeping
tliat hook down. With Smart |that's Doug, Bruno's 0-7 running mate|
there isn't much you can do because he can kill you in a hundred
different ways under the basket."
