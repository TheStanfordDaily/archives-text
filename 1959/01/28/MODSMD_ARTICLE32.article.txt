# UO, Huskies Next Foes For Indians
## 
### 
They're beginning to get
mighty important for Stanford's
basketball team.
Nine games are left on the
Tribe schedule and if the Indians
entertain any visions of a Pacific
Coast Conference title, any more
than two losses the rest of the
way will be killing.
But despite Ihe fact that they
have three losses in the first sev
en outings, they're only one game
behind the leaders in the loss col
umn.
So novo the make-or-hreak se
ries of the season arrives. Fri
day, Hk 1 Tribe will be in Eugene,
Ore., to meet the improved Ore
gon Ducks and Saturday it's Se
attle to tangle with high-flying
Washington.
Seeks Second Win
Oregon has played only four
conference games and won only
one of them, but it is notable that
the one victory was over favorite
California. And two of the losses
came within the past two weeks
to Washington, the other pic-sea
son pick.
The Ducks have i m pro v e d
steadily since Steve Belko look
the coaching task three years ago.
This season Belko was forced to
open without the services of his
two top scorers and rebounders
for two years, Charlie Franklin
and Hal Duffy, but the Ducks
began to function from Ihe start
with victories over such teams as
Brigham Young and Wichita.
Shining Light
Stu Robertson, a 6-5 reserve
last season, has been the shining
light of the Webfoot attack all
year. Robertson ranks in the Pa
cific Coast Conference's top ten
in scoring, rebounding, field goals
and free throws.
Teaming with Robertson in the
Duck front line are two more 6-5
specimens, Dale Herron and Den
ny Strickland. Herron was a
starter last year as a sophomore
and currently ranks fourth in
PCC rebounding.
Belko is using a "center-less"
offense this season with Robert
son, Strickland and Herron mov
ing in and out of the post.
Dangerous Ducks
In the backcourt, the Ducks
can call on two double-figure scor
ers in junior Chuck Rask and sen
ior Bud Kuykendall. Rask, an ac
complished all-around performer,

was the NV). 3 Webfoot scorer last
season. Kuykendall is a deadly
exponent of the long two-hand set
shot and it was one of his long
casts that beat California last sea
son.
Depth is Oregon's biggest prob
lem. Only 6-4 Jerry Anderson, a
junior, and 6-1 guard Butch Kimp
ton, a sophomore, see much ac
tion outside of the starters.
And if Belko is looking ahead
to next year, things must look
pretty good, for everyone's hack
but Kuykendall.
