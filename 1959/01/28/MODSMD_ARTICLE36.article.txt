## 
### 
It's taken a while but it finally
looks like the "fifth man" prob
lem which had been plaguing
Stanford's frosh basketball team
has solved itself.
At the beginning of the season
the second guard spot, beside
John Fontius, was filled by Dave
Wolf, a prospect from Yelm,

Just before the Cal series, how
ever, Wolf packed up and left for
home after having practiced with
the quad only the d;iy before. This

left the "fifth man" very unde
cided.
First to get a crack at the spot
was Jim Bryan. Jim is 6-4 and
has an accurate jump shot.
Bryan started the first game
with the Cal frosh but shared a
lot of the action with Phil Jacobs,
a 5-10 speedster from Fowler,
Ind.
Jacobs got the nod to start Sat
urday's game against Cal in Ber
keley. Again, Bryan and Jacobs
alternated and Bryan came oat
high point man for the Papooses
with 12 counters.
Bryan Leads Scorers
So it was that last weekend
against COP frosh the "fifth
man" was Jim Bryan. This time,
though, the fifth man came in
first as he led SU scorers with a
helty 21 points and paced the
frosh to a decisive 72-. r )9 win over
the Kitten squad.
Bryan will start against tho
JV's this weekend and barring the
unforeseen should be the perma
nent fifth man for the frosh.
