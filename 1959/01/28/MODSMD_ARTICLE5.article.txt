# SATELLITE SQUAD
## Initial 110 Chosen for Space Try 
### 
NEW YORK C/l'i—One hundred
ten rugged young Americans
have "made the squad" which will
provide America's entry into the
race to put the first man into
orbit around the earth.
This was disclosed Tuesday
night by Dr. T. Keith Glennan,
U.S. space chief, in a surprise ad
dition to a speech.
The potential American pio
neers were not listed by name.
Glennan said the 110 carefully
chosen men will Ijc reduced to 12
by late March.
Mercury Astronauts
He said volunteers for this U.S.
flights would be known as Mer
cury Astronauts; America's man
ned satellite venture is known as
Project Mercury.
Whether one or more of these
astronauts is actually the first
human to go into orbit around the
world will depend in large meas
ure, of course, on whether Amer
ica's program beats the .Russians'.
Characteristics
Glennan gave these as charac
teristics of the man to be finally
selected:
1. A university graduate, with
a degree in the physical sciences
or in engineering.
2. A graduate of one of the mil
itary test-pilot training schools,
with at least 1500 hours of flying
time.
3. Younger than 40, and not
taller than 5 feet 11.
4. In superb condition, with the
physical and psychological char
acteristics best suited for space
flight as determined by the aero
medical scientists who are help
ing NASA in Project Mercury.
Few Risks
"We are determined that the
risks to the pilot will be no great
er than those experienced during
the first flight of a new, high-per
formance airplane," Glennan said.
"Repeated flight of the space
capsule, first carrying only in
struments and later animals, will
have tested and proven the prac
ticability of the final phase of
Project Mercury—manned satel
lite flight—before it is underta
ken."

risks to the pilot will be no great
er than those experienced during
the first flight of a new, high-per
formance airplane," Glennan said.
"Repeated flight of the space
capsule, first carrying only in
struments and later animals, will
have tested and proven the prac
ticability of the final phase of
Project Mercury—manned satel
lite flight—before it is underta
ken."
NEW YORK C/l'i—One hundred
ten rugged young Americans
have "made the squad" which will
provide America's entry into the
race to put the first man into
orbit around the earth.
This was disclosed Tuesday
night by Dr. T. Keith Glennan,
U.S. space chief, in a surprise ad
dition to a speech.
The potential American pio
neers were not listed by name.
Glennan said the 110 carefully
chosen men will Ijc reduced to 12
by late March.
Mercury Astronauts
He said volunteers for this U.S.
flights would be known as Mer
cury Astronauts; America's man
ned satellite venture is known as
Project Mercury.
Whether one or more of these
astronauts is actually the first
human to go into orbit around the
world will depend in large meas
ure, of course, on whether Amer
ica's program beats the .Russians'.
Characteristics
Glennan gave these as charac
teristics of the man to be finally
selected:
1. A university graduate, with
a degree in the physical sciences
or in engineering.
2. A graduate of one of the mil
itary test-pilot training schools,
with at least 1500 hours of flying
time.
3. Younger than 40, and not
taller than 5 feet 11.
4. In superb condition, with the
physical and psychological char
acteristics best suited for space
flight as determined by the aero
medical scientists who are help
ing NASA in Project Mercury.
Few Risks
"We are determined that the
risks to the pilot will be no great
er than those experienced during
the first flight of a new, high-per
formance airplane," Glennan said.
"Repeated flight of the space
capsule, first carrying only in
struments and later animals, will
have tested and proven the prac
ticability of the final phase of
Project Mercury—manned satel
lite flight—before it is underta
ken."
