Thoy arc the beat men,
They arc the neat mrn,
They are the happy men
They are the Chappie men.
Like man, this is like nothing
you've ever seen before. 1 mean
like it's so great that oven Gins
berg is here. And Ginsberg's the
most.
Man, those squares in the little
shack really came through. Like
they're way out this issue. That
one on La Boheme really sounds
like someone was ;it that party of
Erie Nord's and was taking down
every word I said. Like someone
was really aware . . .
And do I dig that bit about
Plato. Man, I almost flipped
when I saw it. It's like listening
to some of those eats at the Ba
gel Shop y'know, the ones that
seem like they're way out of it.
Only, purely, we know that they
're just inspired.

Man, though, that "On the
Street" is trite. Like somebody
was trying to lie funny and in
stead got all tied up in a trip or
something. And why make Den
ver? Man. that place is nowhere.
And Ginsberg's way out, like,
it's the stuff a man can live on.
Like he says: "Ah. Wallace, while
you preside, we are all Indians
and shall not fear the organiza
tion soup of TIME." MAN,
THAT'S THE MOST!
Only one thing beaks me.
though. Most of their cartoons
look like they were copied from
parts of Gaieties. And, man, that
wasn't so good.
Like 1 might give up a bottle
for this issue. It's way out. I
mean. man. the Chappies are
aware. Where am I going to get
the 35 cents to buy a copy today?
1 really dig this Issue and I gotta
have one or, man, I'll get malad
justed or sick or something.
