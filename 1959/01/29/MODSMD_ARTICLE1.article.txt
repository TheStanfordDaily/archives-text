# Ike Favors New Talks, But U.S. To Remain Firm
## 
### 
WASHINGTON U\') President Eisenhower said Wednesday he
favors new talks with the Soviets but that the United States won't
"retreat a single inch" on its international rights and responsibilities.
As Eisenhower was saying this at a news conference, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles denounced all Soviet proposals put forward

thus far as aimed solely at win
ning the cold war.
Dulles expressed readiness to
meet with the Soviets to discuss
East-West deadlocks over Berlin,
Germany's future, and the prob
lem of European security.
Dulles, especially, has been try
ing recently to maintain an air of
reasonableness to impress the
world. As late as Tuesday he had
said that negotiations with the
Soviets might promote peace.
Wednesday he got back to the
realistic line before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. Ev
erything the Reds do, he said, is
designed to lower the free world's
resistance to the spread of inter
national Communism.
Kremlin Cautioned
Both Eisenhower and Dulles
cautioned the Kremlin against
believing there is any split be
tween the American people and
their government on the need for
a firm policy toward the Soviet
Union.
Eisenhower said friends told
him during Soviet Deputy Pre
mier Anastas I. Mikoyan's recent
U.S. visit that the Soviet leader
professed to believe the Ameri
can people and its government
were divided on Berlin and other
foreign policy issues.
The deputy premier, in friendly
discussion with Vice-President
Nixon, gave the impression -
probably the true one—that he
had recognized the fundamental
unity of ihe United States in its
stand against international Com
ma nism.
Vigilance
Dulles in talking with Con
gressmen pledged to be vigilant
in seeking what he called "every
reasonable avenue to achieving a
better understanding with those
who are hostile to us . .
But he made clear the Eisen
hower administration does not in
tend to invent new and weaker
policies, as he put it, just because
Soviet leaders arc demanding new
offers.
Dulles added it is his deep con
viction that the cold war could
not be ended by words but by spe
cific agreements.
"Every si>ecific proposal that
the Soviets have made for pro
moting an end to Hie cold war has
been a proposal designed to di
minish our will or capacity to re
sist international Communism in
the achievement of its worldwide
goals," he said.

Eisenhower said friends told
him during Soviet Deputy Pre
mier Anastas I. Mikoyan's recent
U.S. visit that the Soviet leader
professed to believe the Ameri
can people and its government
were divided on Berlin and other
foreign policy issues.
The deputy premier, in friendly
discussion with Vice-President
Nixon, gave the impression -
probably the true one—that he
had recognized the fundamental
unity of ihe United States in its
stand against international Com
ma nism.
Vigilance
Dulles in talking with Con
gressmen pledged to be vigilant
in seeking what he called "every
reasonable avenue to achieving a
better understanding with those
who are hostile to us . .
But he made clear the Eisen
hower administration does not in
tend to invent new and weaker
policies, as he put it, just because
Soviet leaders arc demanding new
offers.
Dulles added it is his deep con
viction that the cold war could
not be ended by words but by spe
cific agreements.
"Every si>ecific proposal that
the Soviets have made for pro
moting an end to Hie cold war has
been a proposal designed to di
minish our will or capacity to re
sist international Communism in
the achievement of its worldwide
goals," he said.
WASHINGTON U\') President Eisenhower said Wednesday he
favors new talks with the Soviets but that the United States won't
"retreat a single inch" on its international rights and responsibilities.
As Eisenhower was saying this at a news conference, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles denounced all Soviet proposals put forward

thus far as aimed solely at win
ning the cold war.
Dulles expressed readiness to
meet with the Soviets to discuss
East-West deadlocks over Berlin,
Germany's future, and the prob
lem of European security.
Dulles, especially, has been try
ing recently to maintain an air of
reasonableness to impress the
world. As late as Tuesday he had
said that negotiations with the
Soviets might promote peace.
Wednesday he got back to the
realistic line before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. Ev
erything the Reds do, he said, is
designed to lower the free world's
resistance to the spread of inter
national Communism.
Kremlin Cautioned
Both Eisenhower and Dulles
cautioned the Kremlin against
believing there is any split be
tween the American people and
their government on the need for
a firm policy toward the Soviet
Union.
