## Reports, Projects Engage LASSU 
### John Bohn ASSU President 
There has been some little mis
understanding concerning the role
of the "legislative investigating
committees" which should be dis
pelled.
In past years much criticism
has arisen in reference to alleged
duplication of effort among the
various ASSU boards and coin
missions. Some were felt to be
obsolete, given the character and
temper of the newer generation
of students. Unfortunately, how
ever, accurate knowledge about
the precise functions and lines of
authority and communication
among the organizations has been
lacking. This lack of information
has precluded any attempts at re
organization, and indeed has pre
vented a proper assessment of
the need for reorganization.
Clear Underbrush
The purpose of the committees
which have been established by
Legislature is to clear away as
much of this administrative un
derbrush as possible so that a
proper evaluation of the ASSU
organization can be made, togeth
er with suggestions for improve
ment. In some areas of the gov
ernmental structure communica
tion and co-operation have been
found to be excellent, but in oth
ers improvements are badly need
ed.
Charge Accounts
The Legislature also has sev
eral other projects. Studies are
under way concerning the possi
bility of having student, charge
accounts in the new bookstore.
The major problem presented
here would be the increase in
overhead which would result.
Such an increase would have to

be made up out of rebate percent
ages unless the increased sales
could cover it. Since the increase
in sales which will result from
the new bookstore is not yet
known, information is being gath
ered to allow a better assessment
of the posibilities of charge ac
counts.
Other Projects
The ASSU, through the Stan
ford Political Union and in co-op
eration with the California Citi
zenship Clearing House, is co
sponsoring a school of politics
which will be held Feb. 21 and 22
at .Rickey's and which will feature
speakers 'and discussion on cur
rent political topics. Preliminary
studies are under way on the con
version of the back room of the
Cellar into an evening "hangout"
pending the construction of the
new Union. By tearing out the
center booths and installing a
dance floor and juke box, and by
redecorating it, we would hope to
provide an after-library and week
end meeting place for students
who remain on campus. We
would be very much interested in
your comments on this project.
Criticism Valued
On the occasion of the retire
ment of Volume KM of The Stan
ford Daily, 1 would like to take
this opportunity to express my
appreciation to Barbara Hicks,
the editor, and to her whole staff
for their co-operation, their ex
cellent coverage of ASSU activi
ties and their continued interest
and suggestions toward the im
provement of student government
at. Stanford. It is through well
thought-out criticism, discussion
and difference of opinion, that
progress can be made toward in
creasing the effectiveness of stu
dent government.
