Recommendation
Editor, The Daily:
In the discussion on how to im
prove the intellectual and social
life at Stanford, there seems to be
one barrier that nothing much
has been said about so far and
that is the present organization of
the student body. With the pres
ent set-up the students are di
vided and classified into graduate
and undergraduate students, sen
iors, juniors, sophomores and
freshmen. Each group is expect
ed to some extent to run its own
affairs and live its own social life.
Graduate students are especial
ly treated as something very spe
cial and are by many regarded as
some sort of half men, half ani
mals and only partly as Stanford
students. . . . They are older,
more mature, more experienced
and on the whole more intelligent
than the undergraduate students,
yet they play a very minor role in
student affairs and student gov
ernment.
In student activities and cam
pus life, the graduate student is
supposed to be more of a passive
supporter than active leader he
is not supposed to live in the fra
ternities or other living groups,
etc., but is still regarded as being
immature enough to have to keep
up with a lot of the same childish
rules that govern the younger,
sometimes much younger under
graduate student in his social life
on campus.
It would seem likely that by
bringing the graduate students
and undergraduate students clos
er together, within the same
framework, the whole student
body would benefit, not only intel
lectually but also socially. This
would of course mean that we in
the first place will have 1o drop
the social and administrative dis
tinction between graduate and un
dergraduate students. Secondly
we would also have to do away
with the classification of students
into seniors, juniors, etc. If a di
vision in the student body has to

bp made, i1 would bo logical to do
it somewhere after the first year
and before the third, depending
on academic qualifications. These
younger, first to second year col
lege students, would be mainly
those concerned with catching up
on what they should have learned
in high school, i.e., Western Civi
lization, American history, basic
science, foreign languages and all
the other General Studies require
ments.
The older, or University stu
dents, would thus be all those con
cerned with academic studies,
whether toward an A.B. or Ph.D.
This latter group would be the
one concerned with student gov
ernment and mainly responsible
for social and intellectual activi
ties on campus.

Little Student Spirit
Editor, The Daily:
Just how much do the different
groups presenting lectures on the
Stanford campus, ostensibly for
the intellectual broadening of the
students, depend upon the resi
dents of.the numerous surround
ing towns for support?
It would seem that the only
time there is an obvious student
representation is when, because
of the relationship between the
particular lecture and course
work, the professor requires his
class to attend. Why aren't the
lectures supported by students
who come for an hour and a half
because they are interested or, if
only mildly interested, at least
curious to learn about something
with which they are unfamiliar.
I was not aware that the differ
ent groups sponsoring lecturers
were presenting inferior ones ex
pounding on inferior topics, and
I am not unaware that the major
ity of Stanford students have lit
tle spirit for anything excepting
sporting events and permission
to travel from the first floor to
the second.
