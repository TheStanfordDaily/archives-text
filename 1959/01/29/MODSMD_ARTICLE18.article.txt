# Draft—Or Professional Army?
## 
### Rich Brown 
Should the military draft law, due to expire on .Tune
30, be renewed for another four years? That is a ques
tion Congress will have to decide shortly.
Already the Defense Department has urged the House
Armed Serviced Committee to reinstate the present Uni
versal Military Training and Service Act.
Before considering the pros and cons of the draft law,
one may start by recognizing that the United States and
the rest of the Free World are greatly endangered by the
forces of International Communism.
Most experts agree that for the U.S. presently to give
up its defense system would be fatal. It is generally
felt, too, that the U.S. is far less likely to get into a war
if it remains strong enough to discourage Communist
aggression.
Most people can agree on tlie end result—that of main
taining their freedom. The disagreement comes over the
means of accomplishing that end.
Opinions on the subject boil down to essentially two —
that the conscript army provides the best possible de
fense for the U.S., or that a voluntary defense system
is preferable and able to do a better job.
Leading the faction which feels that conscription is
necessary is the Defense Department. It says that the
U.S. would be left m peril due to drop-outs from the
services if the draft act is allowed to lapse.
Favoring a volunteer army are individuals (including
even a few military meh) and groups who have studied
the problem in detail and have concluded that the draft
no longer serves a useful purpose.
Perhaps the group which has done the most extensive
research is a committee of experts under the chairman
ship of Ralph J. Cordiner, president of General Electric.
The Cordiner Report clearly says that the present sys
tem does not meet the nation's defense needs.
A number of magazine writers have studied the de
fense problem individually and have reported their find

ings in recent issues. Most agree that the draft should
he replaced with something better.
What do these proponents of a voluntary defense
system urge?
Essentially, Ihey indicate that the military should
compete with private industry in recruitment by the
same inducements business uses—high pay, good living
conditions, more regard for individual dignity, and the
customary fringe benefits accorded by private enter
prise.
In olher words -a paid professional army. By offer
ing rewards comparable to those given by industry, the
military would attract top-notch men who would be
many times more valuable than conscripts, the reports
say.
A comparison between what various groups urge the
federal government to do with the armed services can
be made with what several states did many years ago
in abolishing conscription.
In the early days, some state and local governments
required citizens to participate in sheriffs' posses and
perform work on roads. Conscription soon proved un
satisfactory and the result was paid police forces and
highway departments.
But what about the cost of the military trying to
compete with business?
The studies indicate that taxpayers would shell out
far less in the end, in spite of substantially increased pay
to servicemen. The saving would be made by eliminat
ing the tremendous turnover and replacement costs.
As if stands now, hundreds of men quit the service
as soon as their terms are up, thereby largely wasting
the money spent on their training.
With a professional defense unit, a man once 1 rained
would be available for many years to come. His job
would be the service and he would stay because he knew
he was getting as good a financial bargain as he would
in business or the professions.
Next comes the question of morale.
Experts who favor the voluntary, professional army

point out that anyone who is happy with his job is bound
to do a better job than an unwilling participant.
Technology is probably behind the reason for so many
saying that the draft is outdated. It has been the new
inventions which made possible the shift in emphasis
from quantity to quality.
A lew years ago, the important thing was men —
masses of them. Today, however, thousands of men
carrying rifles would hardly be effective against guided
missiles, H-bombs and the like, the studies emphasize.
It has been urged that tlie emphasis be shifted from
the boot tamp to the laboratory. Experts point to Rus
sia's apparent lead in several scientific fields.
At least one magazine writer questioned the desira
bility of continuing to have hundreds of men practice
military drills and marching when the real defense is
provided by a handful of highly-skilled men who plan,
build and stand ready to operate guided missiles and
other equipment.
Last, but not least, those who favor a voluntary army
emphasize the uncertainty caused in the lives of mil
lions of Americans. They say that most of this, for the
foregoing reasons, is no longer necessary to keep the
U.S. strong.
Jt is certain that Congress will pass some sort of new
defense legislation before June 30.
Whether it renews the present draft law or provides
some other method will be determined largely by wheth
er the Defense Department or groups such as the Cordi
ner Committee have presented more convincing argu
ments.
One commentator, in discussing the Cordiner Report,
made this prediction. He said that if Congress were to
pass both a new draft law and the recommendations of
the Cordiner Report (higher pay, etc.), the military
would not have lo resort to the draft act, even though
it was on the books.
Thus, if Congress can provide enough attractions to
get the good men and keep them there will be no
necessity for conscription.

Most people can agree on tlie end result—that of main
taining their freedom. The disagreement comes over the
means of accomplishing that end.
Opinions on the subject boil down to essentially two —
that the conscript army provides the best possible de
fense for the U.S., or that a voluntary defense system
is preferable and able to do a better job.
Leading the faction which feels that conscription is
necessary is the Defense Department. It says that the
U.S. would be left m peril due to drop-outs from the
services if the draft act is allowed to lapse.
Favoring a volunteer army are individuals (including
even a few military meh) and groups who have studied
the problem in detail and have concluded that the draft
no longer serves a useful purpose.
Perhaps the group which has done the most extensive
research is a committee of experts under the chairman
ship of Ralph J. Cordiner, president of General Electric.
The Cordiner Report clearly says that the present sys
tem does not meet the nation's defense needs.
A number of magazine writers have studied the de
fense problem individually and have reported their find

ings in recent issues. Most agree that the draft should
he replaced with something better.
What do these proponents of a voluntary defense
system urge?
Essentially, Ihey indicate that the military should
compete with private industry in recruitment by the
same inducements business uses—high pay, good living
conditions, more regard for individual dignity, and the
customary fringe benefits accorded by private enter
prise.
In olher words -a paid professional army. By offer
ing rewards comparable to those given by industry, the
military would attract top-notch men who would be
many times more valuable than conscripts, the reports
say.
A comparison between what various groups urge the
federal government to do with the armed services can
be made with what several states did many years ago
in abolishing conscription.
In the early days, some state and local governments
required citizens to participate in sheriffs' posses and
perform work on roads. Conscription soon proved un
satisfactory and the result was paid police forces and
highway departments.
But what about the cost of the military trying to
compete with business?
The studies indicate that taxpayers would shell out
far less in the end, in spite of substantially increased pay
to servicemen. The saving would be made by eliminat
ing the tremendous turnover and replacement costs.
As if stands now, hundreds of men quit the service
as soon as their terms are up, thereby largely wasting
the money spent on their training.
With a professional defense unit, a man once 1 rained
would be available for many years to come. His job
would be the service and he would stay because he knew
he was getting as good a financial bargain as he would
in business or the professions.
Next comes the question of morale.
Experts who favor the voluntary, professional army

point out that anyone who is happy with his job is bound
to do a better job than an unwilling participant.
Technology is probably behind the reason for so many
saying that the draft is outdated. It has been the new
inventions which made possible the shift in emphasis
from quantity to quality.
A lew years ago, the important thing was men —
masses of them. Today, however, thousands of men
carrying rifles would hardly be effective against guided
missiles, H-bombs and the like, the studies emphasize.
It has been urged that tlie emphasis be shifted from
the boot tamp to the laboratory. Experts point to Rus
sia's apparent lead in several scientific fields.
At least one magazine writer questioned the desira
bility of continuing to have hundreds of men practice
military drills and marching when the real defense is
provided by a handful of highly-skilled men who plan,
build and stand ready to operate guided missiles and
other equipment.
Last, but not least, those who favor a voluntary army
emphasize the uncertainty caused in the lives of mil
lions of Americans. They say that most of this, for the
foregoing reasons, is no longer necessary to keep the
U.S. strong.
Jt is certain that Congress will pass some sort of new
defense legislation before June 30.
Whether it renews the present draft law or provides
some other method will be determined largely by wheth
er the Defense Department or groups such as the Cordi
ner Committee have presented more convincing argu
ments.
One commentator, in discussing the Cordiner Report,
made this prediction. He said that if Congress were to
pass both a new draft law and the recommendations of
the Cordiner Report (higher pay, etc.), the military
would not have lo resort to the draft act, even though
it was on the books.
Thus, if Congress can provide enough attractions to
get the good men and keep them there will be no
necessity for conscription.
Should the military draft law, due to expire on .Tune
30, be renewed for another four years? That is a ques
tion Congress will have to decide shortly.
Already the Defense Department has urged the House
Armed Serviced Committee to reinstate the present Uni
versal Military Training and Service Act.
Before considering the pros and cons of the draft law,
one may start by recognizing that the United States and
the rest of the Free World are greatly endangered by the
forces of International Communism.
Most experts agree that for the U.S. presently to give
up its defense system would be fatal. It is generally
felt, too, that the U.S. is far less likely to get into a war
if it remains strong enough to discourage Communist
aggression.

research is a committee of experts under the chairman
ship of Ralph J. Cordiner, president of General Electric.
The Cordiner Report clearly says that the present sys
tem does not meet the nation's defense needs.
A number of magazine writers have studied the de
fense problem individually and have reported their find

ings in recent issues. Most agree that the draft should
he replaced with something better.
What do these proponents of a voluntary defense
system urge?
Essentially, Ihey indicate that the military should
compete with private industry in recruitment by the
same inducements business uses—high pay, good living
conditions, more regard for individual dignity, and the
customary fringe benefits accorded by private enter
prise.
In olher words -a paid professional army. By offer
ing rewards comparable to those given by industry, the
military would attract top-notch men who would be
many times more valuable than conscripts, the reports
say.
A comparison between what various groups urge the
federal government to do with the armed services can
be made with what several states did many years ago
in abolishing conscription.
In the early days, some state and local governments
required citizens to participate in sheriffs' posses and
perform work on roads. Conscription soon proved un
satisfactory and the result was paid police forces and
highway departments.
But what about the cost of the military trying to
compete with business?
The studies indicate that taxpayers would shell out
far less in the end, in spite of substantially increased pay
to servicemen. The saving would be made by eliminat
ing the tremendous turnover and replacement costs.
As if stands now, hundreds of men quit the service
as soon as their terms are up, thereby largely wasting
the money spent on their training.
With a professional defense unit, a man once 1 rained
would be available for many years to come. His job
would be the service and he would stay because he knew
he was getting as good a financial bargain as he would
in business or the professions.
Next comes the question of morale.
Experts who favor the voluntary, professional army

point out that anyone who is happy with his job is bound
to do a better job than an unwilling participant.
Technology is probably behind the reason for so many
saying that the draft is outdated. It has been the new
inventions which made possible the shift in emphasis
from quantity to quality.
A lew years ago, the important thing was men —
masses of them. Today, however, thousands of men
carrying rifles would hardly be effective against guided
missiles, H-bombs and the like, the studies emphasize.
It has been urged that tlie emphasis be shifted from
the boot tamp to the laboratory. Experts point to Rus
sia's apparent lead in several scientific fields.
At least one magazine writer questioned the desira
bility of continuing to have hundreds of men practice
military drills and marching when the real defense is
provided by a handful of highly-skilled men who plan,
build and stand ready to operate guided missiles and
other equipment.
Last, but not least, those who favor a voluntary army
emphasize the uncertainty caused in the lives of mil
lions of Americans. They say that most of this, for the
foregoing reasons, is no longer necessary to keep the
U.S. strong.
Jt is certain that Congress will pass some sort of new
defense legislation before June 30.
Whether it renews the present draft law or provides
some other method will be determined largely by wheth
er the Defense Department or groups such as the Cordi
ner Committee have presented more convincing argu
ments.
One commentator, in discussing the Cordiner Report,
made this prediction. He said that if Congress were to
pass both a new draft law and the recommendations of
the Cordiner Report (higher pay, etc.), the military
would not have lo resort to the draft act, even though
it was on the books.
Thus, if Congress can provide enough attractions to
get the good men and keep them there will be no
necessity for conscription.
Should the military draft law, due to expire on .Tune
30, be renewed for another four years? That is a ques
tion Congress will have to decide shortly.
Already the Defense Department has urged the House
Armed Serviced Committee to reinstate the present Uni
versal Military Training and Service Act.
Before considering the pros and cons of the draft law,
one may start by recognizing that the United States and
the rest of the Free World are greatly endangered by the
forces of International Communism.
Most experts agree that for the U.S. presently to give
up its defense system would be fatal. It is generally
felt, too, that the U.S. is far less likely to get into a war
if it remains strong enough to discourage Communist
aggression.
Most people can agree on tlie end result—that of main
taining their freedom. The disagreement comes over the
means of accomplishing that end.
Opinions on the subject boil down to essentially two —
that the conscript army provides the best possible de
fense for the U.S., or that a voluntary defense system
is preferable and able to do a better job.
Leading the faction which feels that conscription is
necessary is the Defense Department. It says that the
U.S. would be left m peril due to drop-outs from the
services if the draft act is allowed to lapse.
Favoring a volunteer army are individuals (including
even a few military meh) and groups who have studied
the problem in detail and have concluded that the draft
no longer serves a useful purpose.
