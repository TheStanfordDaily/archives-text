# Women Sponsors Achieve Goals
## 
### Camille Petersen Staff Editor 
When discussing the sponsor
system, one must take into ac
count the different problems
faced by the men and women
sponsors. Because of these differ
ences, what may be bad for one
may be good for the other.
In the case of the freshmen wo
men living problems, it does not
seem to be as much a question of
whether or not the sponsor sys
tem is working well, but rather
whether all - freshman dorms are
better than an integrated system.
When discussing the sponsor sys
tem, the discussion of the latter
problem is inevitable.
Clear Idea
Before discussing facets of the
sponsor system it is good to have
a clear- idea as to how the spon
sors are selected and what they
personally feel are the qualities a
good sponsor should have.
There are 14 sponsors in Bran
ner and 15 in Roble. These women
were chosen last spring by the
Sponsor Choosing Committee
which consisted of 1) old spon
sors, 2) present, sponsors and 3)
leaders from living areas. This
latter group includes presidents
of dorms, committee of five mem
bers, member's of activity groups,
and dorm members who show in
terest.
The present head sponsors,
AWS president and Dean of Wo
men are automatically members
of the Committee.
Selection Process
Sponsors are selected through
applications and group interviews
conducted by the committee. Be
fore the selections are made, the
committee attempts to find out
more about the applicants by con
tacting Resident Assistants and
close friends. Selections must be
approved by the AWS cabinet.
The sponsors with whom this
writer talked seemed to feel that
great importance was laid upon
the ability to balance academic
with extracurricular activities in
selecting sponsors because these
people would be the most likely
to be able to help incoming fresh
men to gain a near balance.
They felt a good sponsor'
should 1) consider the women in
her corridor as individuals as well
as part of a group; 2) prepare the
freshmen to stand alone as soon
as possible without pushing them;
3) seek outside help when neces
sary. Because of individual differ
ences, it is not easy for some peo
ple to express themselves to one
person as it is with another. In
such cases the sponsor should see
to it that the freshman becomes
acquainted with or grows closer
to someone to whom she can ex
press her feelings freely.
One of the big problems as seen
by the sponsors is adjusting their
programs to fit the people with
whom they are working. There is
a noticeable change in the succe
eding freshmen classes and the
sponsor system — its aims and

methods — must change accord
ingly-
The sponsors found the present
freshman class more studious
than they had anticipated, and it
was necessary for them to change
their social program quite drasti
cally in the middle of last quarter.
Another noticeable change in
the program this year is the
greater stress on the individual.
After talking with sponsors and
freshmen women, this reporter
can only conclude that, in the ma
jority of cases the sponsors are

accomplishing what they have set
out to do. (Whether these aims
and the methods for accomplish
ing them are the most desirable
or not will be discussed in a later
art icle. I
The freshmen women felt that
they were being prepared to meet
situations without being nursed.
The sponsors explain the facts for'
them and then leave it to the indi
vidual to reconcile her actions
with her own standards and prin
ciples.
No feeling of being over-pro

tooted was expressed by the fresh
men. They believed that their
sponsors had tried to m;ike thorn
aware of the actual situations as
they exist hero.
The drinking laws had been ex
plained thoroughly, and the dou
ble standard for men and women
in this area discussed.
Both freshmen and sponsors ox-!
pressed the awareness of change j
in the freshmen after one quarter. |
Much of the natural awe is gone'
and they feed more secure in eas- j
iug into leadership positions.

When discussing the sponsor
system, one must take into ac

sponsors. Because of these differ

In the case of the freshmen wo
men living problems, it does not

tem, the discussion of the latter
problem is inevitable.
Clear Idea
Before discussing facets of the
sponsor system it is good to have
a clear- idea as to how the spon
sors are selected and what they
personally feel are the qualities a
good sponsor should have.
There are 14 sponsors in Bran
ner and 15 in Roble. These women
were chosen last spring by the
Sponsor Choosing Committee
which consisted of 1) old spon
sors, 2) present, sponsors and 3)
leaders from living areas. This
latter group includes presidents
of dorms, committee of five mem
bers, member's of activity groups,
and dorm members who show in
terest.
The present head sponsors,
AWS president and Dean of Wo
men are automatically members
of the Committee.
Selection Process
Sponsors are selected through
applications and group interviews
conducted by the committee. Be
fore the selections are made, the
committee attempts to find out
more about the applicants by con
tacting Resident Assistants and
close friends. Selections must be
approved by the AWS cabinet.
The sponsors with whom this
writer talked seemed to feel that
great importance was laid upon
the ability to balance academic
with extracurricular activities in
selecting sponsors because these
people would be the most likely
to be able to help incoming fresh
men to gain a near balance.
They felt a good sponsor'
should 1) consider the women in
her corridor as individuals as well
as part of a group; 2) prepare the
freshmen to stand alone as soon
as possible without pushing them;
3) seek outside help when neces
sary. Because of individual differ
ences, it is not easy for some peo
ple to express themselves to one
person as it is with another. In
such cases the sponsor should see
to it that the freshman becomes
acquainted with or grows closer
to someone to whom she can ex
press her feelings freely.
One of the big problems as seen
by the sponsors is adjusting their
programs to fit the people with
whom they are working. There is
a noticeable change in the succe
eding freshmen classes and the
sponsor system — its aims and

methods — must change accord
ingly-
The sponsors found the present
freshman class more studious
than they had anticipated, and it
was necessary for them to change
their social program quite drasti
cally in the middle of last quarter.
Another noticeable change in
the program this year is the
greater stress on the individual.
After talking with sponsors and
freshmen women, this reporter
can only conclude that, in the ma
jority of cases the sponsors are

accomplishing what they have set
out to do. (Whether these aims
and the methods for accomplish
ing them are the most desirable
or not will be discussed in a later
art icle. I
The freshmen women felt that
they were being prepared to meet
situations without being nursed.
The sponsors explain the facts for'
them and then leave it to the indi

When discussing the sponsor
system, one must take into ac
count the different problems
faced by the men and women
sponsors. Because of these differ
ences, what may be bad for one
may be good for the other.
In the case of the freshmen wo
men living problems, it does not
seem to be as much a question of
whether or not the sponsor sys
tem is working well, but rather
whether all - freshman dorms are
better than an integrated system.
When discussing the sponsor sys
tem, the discussion of the latter
problem is inevitable.
Clear Idea
Before discussing facets of the
sponsor system it is good to have
a clear- idea as to how the spon
sors are selected and what they
personally feel are the qualities a
good sponsor should have.
There are 14 sponsors in Bran
ner and 15 in Roble. These women
were chosen last spring by the
Sponsor Choosing Committee
which consisted of 1) old spon
sors, 2) present, sponsors and 3)
leaders from living areas. This
latter group includes presidents
of dorms, committee of five mem
bers, member's of activity groups,
and dorm members who show in
terest.
The present head sponsors,
AWS president and Dean of Wo
men are automatically members
of the Committee.
Selection Process
Sponsors are selected through
applications and group interviews
conducted by the committee. Be
fore the selections are made, the
committee attempts to find out
more about the applicants by con
tacting Resident Assistants and
close friends. Selections must be
approved by the AWS cabinet.
The sponsors with whom this
writer talked seemed to feel that
great importance was laid upon
the ability to balance academic
with extracurricular activities in
selecting sponsors because these
people would be the most likely
to be able to help incoming fresh
men to gain a near balance.
They felt a good sponsor'
should 1) consider the women in
her corridor as individuals as well
as part of a group; 2) prepare the
freshmen to stand alone as soon
as possible without pushing them;
3) seek outside help when neces
sary. Because of individual differ
ences, it is not easy for some peo
ple to express themselves to one
person as it is with another. In
such cases the sponsor should see
to it that the freshman becomes
acquainted with or grows closer
to someone to whom she can ex
press her feelings freely.
One of the big problems as seen
by the sponsors is adjusting their
programs to fit the people with
whom they are working. There is
a noticeable change in the succe
eding freshmen classes and the
sponsor system — its aims and

methods — must change accord
ingly-
The sponsors found the present
freshman class more studious
than they had anticipated, and it
was necessary for them to change
their social program quite drasti
cally in the middle of last quarter.
Another noticeable change in
the program this year is the
greater stress on the individual.
After talking with sponsors and
freshmen women, this reporter
can only conclude that, in the ma
jority of cases the sponsors are

accomplishing what they have set
out to do. (Whether these aims
and the methods for accomplish
ing them are the most desirable
or not will be discussed in a later
art icle. I
