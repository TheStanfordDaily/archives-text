# Earth Shape Not Circular Science Says

NEW YORK (/J 1 ) Old Mother
Earth is actually a little pear
shaped.
She's a bit bulgy in the south,
and pointed in Ihe north.
This hidden truth was discov
ered by tiny Vanguard, the grape
fruit size U.S. satellite launched
last St. Patrick's Day.
Vanguard permitted scientists
to draw an accurate new picture
of the earth because the satellite
travels so high above the earth's
air, and in a very precise, trust
worthy orbit.
But there are little wobbles in
her flight caused by variations
in the earth's shape with conse
quent differences in the earth's
tug of gravity on the satellite.
These showed that sea level at
the North Pole area is about 50
feet higher than had been thought
but some 25 feet lower outside the
polar cap area in the Northern
1 lemisphcre.
But at the south polar cap, sea
level is lower by 50 feet, and 25
feet higher than formerly pre
sumed in the Southern Hemi
sphere in the polar area.
The extra height in the north
represents a tremendously heavy
load I here on the earth's crust.
It's more weight than the thin
crust presumably could support.
This indicates the earth's inte
rior is not so plastic as many sci
entists have assumed.
