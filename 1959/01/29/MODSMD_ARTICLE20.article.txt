# Tribe Cagers Go North For Husky, Duck Tilts

Stanford draws possibly ils toughest assignment of the season Sal »
urday night when it meets tho University of Washington in Seattle!
in a Pacific Coast Conference basketball game crucial to both teams.I
From the standpoint of both sides, one of the most attractive things'
about the game will be that it is the last time they will play each

other all year.
Not only that, but California is
a thing of the past on the sched
tiles of both the Huskies and In
dians, loo. Stanford got out of
that series with a split but Cal
showed that they still had the
Huskies' number, and trounced
them twice, at home and away.
Hut since their totally unim
pressive 1-3 start, Coach Tippy
bye's Tall Timbers have racked
up three straight wins: two over
Oregon and one over Oregon
State, a couple of teams that have
proven particularly troublesome
to the leaders so Car this year.
Stanford draws the Huskies
this time on the second night of
a road trip, .'<()() miles from where
they played the night before. And
Washington has no Friday night
game to gel I ired in.
Nevertheless, there are I hose
who would say the Huskies are
n't going to he beaten at home,
anyway.
Stanford Coach Howie Dallmar
points out thai despile their three

•arly losses, the Huskies are real
ly picking up steam and may be
.n the best position, schedule
wise, to drive to a title.
The Cards nipped Washington,
")l-45>, three weeks ago at the Pa
/ilion. Dandy defensive jobs by
Dick liaga and John Hendry held
ihe tall Husky duo of Doug Smart
tnd Bruno Boin to minimum po
tency and a streak of red-hot out
side shooting gave the Cards an
important win.
Stanford has continued to hit
with effectiveness from far away,
but the Tree Top Twins haven't,
been cut down since. And Wash
ington hasn't lost since.
Smart has thrown in 72 points
in the three games since the Pa
vilion affair, and solidified his
PCC lead in boili scoring and re
bounding. Boin hasn't returned to
his sophomore junior stride all
season, but last week he was
again ripping home his tremen
dous hooks with regularity and
Oregon was dumped for a 19-
point loss.
Karle Irvine, a versatile <M jun
ior who operates al the other for
ward post;, collec ted 22 points for
co-high honors with Smart,
against Oregon, and now presents
a third potent scoring threat in
I he 1 lusky attack.
Out front, there are still prob
lems. Junior Geo r g e Gran t
earned a starting spot with his
performance against Stanford,
and is still there. But the other
position still wavers between
Don Dorland, John Pariseau, Al
Murphy and Lou Coaston. A nev
er-ending headache in Seattle.
