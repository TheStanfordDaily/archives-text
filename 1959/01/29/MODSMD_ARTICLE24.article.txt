## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team trav
els to San Luis Obispo to tangle
with Cal Poly this afternoon. It
will he the third outing for the
Cards this season, and looks to
he their 1 toughest competition
thus far.
Cal Poly was last year's West
Coast champion and is favored to
repeat this year.
Coach Jack McKenna will take
a full squad plus some frosh for
exhibitions. He said that Stan
ford Vv'ill be forced to forfeit two
matches for lack of men in the
weight divisions.
These matches should provide
the young Card team, led by
heavyweight Art Spiegel and 157-
lb. Phil Murphy, with top notch
competition and should be quite
valuable in gaining experience
for Ihe graroplers.
