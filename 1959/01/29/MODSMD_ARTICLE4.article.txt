## 
### 
WASHINGTON' (/P) President
Eisenhower vigorously disclaimed
Wednesday any rift with Chief
Justice Earl Warren over school
desegregation or anything else.
"Irresponsible reporting," Ei
senhower said when asked at his
news conference about a story
that a rift has developed. War
ren dictated a terse statement
calling the story "wholly without
foundat ion."
Eisenhower still declined to
say whether he likes or dislikes
the U.S. Supreme Court decision
which outlawed racially segregat
ed public schools. Consistently,
he has taken Ihe position that
since the President must uphold
enforcement of Supreme Court
decisions, he shouldn't express ap
proval or disapproval of them.

The President said at his press
conference that ihe United States
is making remarkable progress
on missiles after a slow start,
and:"I think it is a matter for
pride on the part of America, and
not a constant well, hang-dog at
titude of humiliation."
Almost at the outset of the ses
sion with newsmen, a reporter
told Eisenhower a story pub
lished Wednesday morning relat
ed that Warren is "pained by
what was described as your fail
ure to take forceful action . . .
to implement the desegregation
decision of Ihe court."
Then on the question (if wheth
er he is a copycat of the Demo
cratic New Deal, as Senator Bar
ry Goldwatcr (R-Ariz.) has sug
gested, Eisenhower said that as
far as he knows, "I have copied
nothing in this world except what
1 believe are the . . . basic prin
ciples of Americanism."
Highlights from the confer
ence:
Price • Wage Controls Again
taking a similar stand, Eisenhow
er said their imposition would be
;i step backward ;ind "a very sad
day for America." Rut he said
controls might become necessary
unless effective steps are taken
to control inflation a remark ob
viously aimed at both unions and
business.
Cuba The chief executive is
certain Ihe U.S. government and
people hope Kidel Castro's re
gime "will be truly representative
of the Cuban people" and will re
flect their views and aspirations.
Soviet Missiles Eisenhower
said he didn't know what Khru
shchev had in mind. This was in
response to a request for reaction
to the premier's statement Tues
day that Ihe Soviet Union is un
der way wilh "serial production"
of int.crconlinent.al ballistic mis
siles.
The President remarked thai
Americans are prone to accept
100 per cent Soviet statements
touching on their anxieties, be
liefs or convictions but that they
dismiss other statements as bald
face lies.

WASHINGTON' (/P) President
Eisenhower vigorously disclaimed
Wednesday any rift with Chief
Justice Earl Warren over school
desegregation or anything else.
"Irresponsible reporting," Ei
senhower said when asked at his
news conference about a story
that a rift has developed. War
ren dictated a terse statement
calling the story "wholly without
foundat ion."
Eisenhower still declined to
say whether he likes or dislikes
the U.S. Supreme Court decision
which outlawed racially segregat
ed public schools. Consistently,
he has taken Ihe position that
since the President must uphold
enforcement of Supreme Court
decisions, he shouldn't express ap
proval or disapproval of them.

conference that ihe United States
is making remarkable progress
on missiles after a slow start,

pride on the part of America, and
not a constant well, hang-dog at

ed that Warren is "pained by
what was described as your fail

gested, Eisenhower said that as
far as he knows, "I have copied
nothing in this world except what
1 believe are the . . . basic prin
ciples of Americanism."
