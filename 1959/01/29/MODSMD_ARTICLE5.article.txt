# Gift for Dog Gone T.V. Taken
## 
### 
Wilbur lost a 21-inch televi
vision set anil Hurlburt House
its doghouse over the week end
as pranksters had a heyday.
The tahic model TV, owned
by the men of Cedro, was stolen
from their lounge sometime
during the week end.
Huiiburt's blue-roofed brown
doghouse, which the girls had
just purchased as an intended
gift, was taken from the front
porch of the house, probably
either late Saturday night or
early Sunday morning. The
name "Claus" is painted on tin;
doghouse.
