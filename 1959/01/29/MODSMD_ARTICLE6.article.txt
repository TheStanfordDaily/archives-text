## Burg Gives Valuable Education 
### Judy Sklar 
"A very select audience" who
have "no fear of mid - ter ms"
heard Stanford-in-Germany come
alive Wednesday night in Cubber
ley Auditorium as four Stuttgart
returnees reported on life at the
Burg.
The University's goals of an in
tegral general studies program,
experience with other peoples
and cultures, full academic credit,
and non-prohibitive cost, as staled
by Dean 11. Donald Winbigler,
moderator, were well fulfilled.
Life in General
Sophomore Jim Garrett, speak
ing on life in general at Ihe Burg,
stressed that group living and the
unity achieved through it were an
invaluable part of their six
months in Germany. Hot dog
rolls, frisbee, "Brave New Burg,"
and American versus German
breakfast furnished the group
with many opportunities for fun
and excitement, as well as an ed
ucation.
Although the German people
were frightened away by the for
mal opening ceremony, feeling
they wore too "plain and simple,"
they soon warmer! up and took in
Ihe floundering-German-speaking
Americans. Gaby Greer, sopho
more, said that every student had
at least one family to whom he
could come for help, "even though
they spoke a pretty horrible dia
lect."
Not Isolated
She emphasized that Stuttgart
is not isolated, but an accepted
part of the community.
"On the weekends, everyone
look off for wherever he hadn't
been yet, and got back Sunday
night in time to flip through the
Lit assignment," was Judy Pin
son's comment on travel from ihe
Burg. Two eight-day trips, one
to Rome and one to Berlin, were
the only planned group trips, but
short ones by car, motorcycle,
train and hitch-hiking filled the
three free days at the end of each
week.
