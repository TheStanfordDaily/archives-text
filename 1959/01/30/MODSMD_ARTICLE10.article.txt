# Heritage Fund Drive to Start
## 
### 
A five-day drive for the 1959
Heritage Fund will start Monday
when Stanford seniors start can
vassing Palo Alto area mer
chants.
The fund, established by the
Class of '55, seeks this year to se
cure $12,500, which will provide
full tuition scholarships for 12
outstanding students.
Chairman of the drive is Ray
York, with James Stewart as vice
chairman. This year 15 men and
15 women will canvass.
The Heritage Fund was born
when the 1955 seniors were won
dering what to give the Univer
sity for their class present. They
wore dissatisfied with the tradi
tional drinking fountain or park
bcnch, and decided instead to seek
llie support of Peninsula mer
chants for a class gift which
achieves more long-range bene
fits.
