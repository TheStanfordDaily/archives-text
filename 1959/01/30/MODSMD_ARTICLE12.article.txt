# Fun Stan Booklet Delayed
## 
### Jack Winkler Associate Editor 
After holding an informal two
hour question and answer session
with President Wallace Sterling
Thursday afternoon, Legislature
convened after dinner at Bowman
Alumni House and turned down a
request for money to put out a
new revised booklet on the Fun
damental Standard and Honor
Code.
Legislature's feeling, as sum
marized by ASSU President John
Bohn, was that while a new inter
pretative pamphlet was a laud
able idea, the outlay for publish
ing costs ($260) would not be
wise at this time because new
ideas might come out during dis
cussions in freshman dorms next
month which would change the
booklet.
Fundamental Standard an d
Honor Code Commission Chair
man Ron Sikes presented dittoed
copies of the proposed new pam
phlet which would include (1> an
enlarged section on Standard and
Code principles, (2) specific appli
cations to dances, liquor, publica
tions, etc., (3> a history of the
Honor Code, (4) procedures for
reporting a Code violation, (5)
faculty responsibilities and ((J) a
section on Men's and Women's
Councils.
"The old booklet really didn't
say too much," he declared, and
said the revision tried to elimi
nate uninformative generalities.
Lagunita Representative Gail
Greiner said the new booklet
"clears up nebulous points in the
Fundamental Standard" and sup
ported the appropriation.
Pete Erlin, Men's Row, suggest
ed a compromise of mimeograph
ing 150 copies at a greatly re
duced cost and distributing them
to sponsors so that interested stu
dents could read them if they
wish.
Administrative Assistant Rod
Hnwes suggested that the discus
sions might sol-ve just as well as
a new pamphlet.'
The proposed appropriation
was then defeated by voice vote
and approximately $25 voter! for
mimeographing expenses, as was
Erlin's suggestion.
