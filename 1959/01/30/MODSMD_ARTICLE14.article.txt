# Arabs Still Seek Unity
## 
### 
The Arab peoples of the Middle
East are striving toward political
and social unity. Their main ob
jectives are justice, self govern
ment and economic reorganiza
tion.
These were the main points em
phasized by Dr. Most afa Kamel,
ambassador extraordinary and
plenipotentiary of the United
Aral) Republic to the U.S.
Dr. Kamel visited campus
Thursday and gave a seminar lec
ture on the Arabs of the Middle
East. He described the evolution
of Arab freedom first freedom
from Turkish domination, then
British and French in 191S, and
finally British control of the Ca
nal Zone. The two goals of the.
revolution of 19.12 were to liberate
the land of Egypt from British
occupation and to insure some
badly needed reforms in all fields.
"Since then there has been tix?-
mendous progress. Electric pow
er, petroleum, fertilizer, sugar, pa
per, cotton and new industries
have increased their profit over
100 per cent. Workers arc coming
under soc'al insurance. Arab na
tionalism has stood for Arab ren
aissance", Dr. Kamel said.
The conflicts which have arisen
have made the world wonder
whose is the blame, Dr. Kamel
stated. It is not the fault of any
one country or individual. "The
creation of Israel has not solved
any problems. It is an aggressive,
Refugees wait on its borders to
ambitious, expansionist nation,
return — one of the great injus
tices of the world."
As a final point, Dr. Kamel
enumerated the principles that
the Arabs are seeking:
• Justice and reduced suffer
ing,
• Self-government supported
by the people and non-interference
from outside nations,
• Recogni/.ation of Arab na
tionalism,
• Internal social justice.
