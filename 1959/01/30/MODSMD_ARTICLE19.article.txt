# The 						Challenge
## 
### 
There is a i nique challenge in knowing that one's words are
being read and weighed i»y 8500 critical persons who have access
to a publication chiefly because they rate among the highest in
intelligence and academic ability.
It is a challenge to try to stimulate their thinking and to make
them understand one's own way of thinking, lu a community such
as Stanford, one cannot expect or even ask for complete harmony
of thought, and these opposing views increase the challenge of
being editor of The Daily.
During ilif course of Volume 1.14, I have been (inure
of I lie magnitude of this challenge, and have tried to meet
it, bearing in mind the lliree areas of content which I
feel should he im hided in a campus newspaper:
Reporting of the news —for, despite the circulation of city
newspapers at Stanford, some readers see only Ihe Daily regu
larly and depend upon it for coverage of local, national and in
ternational events;
Publicity—announcements of meetings, speakers and other
events, if the community is to he able to lake advantage ol the
opportunities offered;
And, finally, Comment, Interpretation and Entertainment —
through editorials, columns and features.
This is a big load for a small newspaper to curry, and
it is no wonder ive liare not been able, lo "please all the
people all of the lime."
It is this challenge of finding the balance that will he most
stimulating and beneficial to the campus community which 1 now
pass on to my successor, Leo Krulitz, and to his able assistants.
Though 1 must admit I regret leaving the editor's chair—for
1 count the experience here as the most valuable I have received
at Stanford—l have no qualms in leaving The Daily in the hands
of Leo. 1 am sure he, too, recognizes the unique challenge before
him. He will give a fresh insight to the problems and projects ol
the community.
To Leo, I wish to say, "Good luck!"
To the stuff of Volume 134,1 wish lo express my thanks.
This litis been your paper: I have been proud of your
work ami of the support you have given me in mine.
And to you, dear reader—we have had our misunderstandings
and often I have wondered if you really understood what you said
when you reminded us that "to err is human, to forgive is divine."
But it has still been rewarding.
To the staff of Volume L.'jr>: 1 urge you to aid Leo as much as
you possibly can —with your suggestions, your criticisms. He alone
cannot make The Daily live up to campus expectations.
