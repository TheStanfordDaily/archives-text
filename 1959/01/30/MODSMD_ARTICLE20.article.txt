# ON OTHER CAMPI
## Crowded Enough? 
### Marilyn Moore 
Guess every college has its own
version of "becoming a Stanford
woman." But I doubt if too many
have it as completely organized
as the U. of Michigan.
Tradition has it that in order
to become a Michigan coed a
woman must be kissed at mid
night under the Engine Arch; no
requirement as to the men's class
year.
Recently two men discussed the
fact that half the women on cam
pus were not officially coeds and
decided to remedy the condition.
Declaring a "Become a Coed
Night," they sent letters to so
cial chairmen in two women's
dormitories asking if there
were any women who might
want to be "fixed up." The re
ply was overwhelming.
"We thought a few replies
would be sent back and everyone
else would think it was a big
joke," one of the chairmen stated.
Instead, approximately 200 re
plies were received, and sign-up
sheets for men had to be posted
throughout the campus.
Not only were men recruited,
they were selected and matched
up with the women in a personal
ized version of a UNIVAC ma
chine. "Application" blanks in

eluded height, color of eyes, year
in college, religious preference
and type of person preferred, and
the two instigators matched up
the couples and notified the men
of their dates.
"We are so encouraged by the
response that we hope there will
be one or two days set aside each
year for 'Become a Coed Night,' "
said one of the chairmen.
How about it, Stanford sen
ior men? Was Inner Quad
crowded enough last Sunday
night to suit you?

If the way to a man's heart is
truly through his stomach, stu
dents at the U. of Minnesota who
are in danger of flunking out may
have a way out after all.
It will only cost them about
$2.50, the trade-in value of the
$5 book for the course. The text
which holds the secret to the pro
fessors' contentment is "Curricu
lum for Cooks," a collection of
645 favorite faculty recipes sub
mitted mostly by professors'
wives. A few recipes were sub
mitted by the profs, themselves.
Published by a division of the
University Faculty Women's
Club, the book was undoubted
ly a sell-out.
