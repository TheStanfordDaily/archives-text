Misuse of Kilt'
Editor, The Daily:
It was with dismay that I read
the caption underneath the pho
tograph of Bobby Watson "Scot
tish folk dancer complete with
kilts." It grieves me to see that
even your honorable paper insists
on perpetuating the misuse of the
word "kilt."
In general, only one kilt is worn
by any person at one time. (I
would like to see someone at
tempting to wear more than one!)
A kilt is a singular garment and
in the plural can be applied only
to more than one person, i.e.,
"They were wearing kilts," but
never, "He was wearing kilts."
I hope that this will prevent
many a future misuse of the word
and that my ears will not be as
saulted by people saying, "Oh—
he's wearing his kilts today."

(Editor's Note: Thanks to J.
Nicol Sands lor straightening
this out. We'll try not to say
"kilts" when we mean "kilt" in
the future.)
Too Kind-Hearted
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Prier was simply too kind
hearted to objectively criticize....
We agree that "the co-ordina
tion between organ and orchestra
was admirable." The Handel con
cetti were well rendered, al
though it seemed as if Nanney
was practically improvising in
the "Allegro" movement of the
second concerto, having "lost his
place," perhaps?
Our biggest criticism of the re
view is in its grossly erroneous
remarks regarding the Bach

"Fantaisie and Fugue in G Mi
nor." Prier staled that the work
"created a cleavage in the total
idea of the program." Certainly
the work provided a contrast to
the Handel concert), but to say
that the contrast was "caustic
and not altogether pleasing" of
fends our aesthetic senses. The
work itself was not caustic —
(Bach caustic?) — however, the
performance may have indeed
seemed "not altogether pleasing."
The fugue in particular lacked
the rhythmic sense and pace re
quired for a listener to fully real
ize the tremendous, relentless
vigor of the work. The rendition
was far from being an "artful
and stirring interpretation." In
deed, it almost seemed as if Nan
ney were sight - reading rather
than interpreting.

many a future misuse of the word
and that my ears will not be as
saulted by people saying, "Oh—
he's wearing his kilts today."

Too Kind-Hearted
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Prier was simply too kind
hearted to objectively criticize....
We agree that "the co-ordina
tion between organ and orchestra
was admirable." The Handel con
cetti were well rendered, al
though it seemed as if Nanney
was practically improvising in
the "Allegro" movement of the
second concerto, having "lost his
place," perhaps?
Our biggest criticism of the re
view is in its grossly erroneous
remarks regarding the Bach

"Fantaisie and Fugue in G Mi
nor." Prier staled that the work
"created a cleavage in the total
idea of the program." Certainly
the work provided a contrast to
the Handel concert), but to say
that the contrast was "caustic
and not altogether pleasing" of
fends our aesthetic senses. The
work itself was not caustic —
(Bach caustic?) — however, the
performance may have indeed
seemed "not altogether pleasing."
The fugue in particular lacked
the rhythmic sense and pace re
quired for a listener to fully real
ize the tremendous, relentless
vigor of the work. The rendition
was far from being an "artful
and stirring interpretation." In
deed, it almost seemed as if Nan
ney were sight - reading rather
than interpreting.

Misuse of Kilt'
Editor, The Daily:
It was with dismay that I read
the caption underneath the pho
tograph of Bobby Watson "Scot
tish folk dancer complete with
kilts." It grieves me to see that
even your honorable paper insists
on perpetuating the misuse of the
word "kilt."
In general, only one kilt is worn
by any person at one time. (I
would like to see someone at
tempting to wear more than one!)
A kilt is a singular garment and
in the plural can be applied only
to more than one person, i.e.,
"They were wearing kilts," but
never, "He was wearing kilts."
I hope that this will prevent
many a future misuse of the word
and that my ears will not be as
saulted by people saying, "Oh—
he's wearing his kilts today."
