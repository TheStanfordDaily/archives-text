# SPONSOR SYSTEM
## Frosh Women See Two Ways To Accomplish Same Goal 
### Camille Petersen Staff Editor 
(This is another in a series of
articles on the sponsor system.)

The problem of which is better
for the freshmen women—all
freshmen dorms or integrated
houses- is one demanding a close
inspection of the objectives of
undergraduate dormitory liviny
and how the individual's needs are
affected by the methods used to
attain these objectives.
The freshmen living in Roble
and Branner generally expressed
satisfaction with the class living
arrangement for freshmen, but
were in favor of more thorough
integration than now exists for
the other three classes.
Those experiencing integration
this year, plus several in Branner
arid Roble, favored integration for
all four classes. To get a clear
enough picture to intelligently dis
cuss the question, it is necessary
to know the arguments for both
sides.
Adjustments
All -freshmen dorm advocates
felt that there are many things
to adjust to during the first year
and that it helps to be in the midst
of others in the same position.
"You understand each oth e r s
problems and this makes things
easier to cope with."
When such things as themes
and Civ mid terms come up, all
are working on the same thing
and it is easy to get assistance
when it is needed.
Freshmen dorms give the new
comer - the opportunity to ease in
to the campus hierarchy. They
feel that if there were integration
the freshmen would just sit back
and not lake the responsibility
that they now assume in their
dorms by the end of the year.
The sponsors provide a certain
contact with upper class women.
They clarify situations for the
freshmen and help guide them
when necessery.

One of the main assets of the
freshmen dorm program seems to
be the feeling of class unity that
is fostered. Some expressed the
feeling that Roble is too far away
from Branner and Wilbur, how
ever.
Integrationists prefer their sys
tem for different reasons which
lead to the same end. They feel
that by living with others who
have gone through the adjust
ment period, freshmen get the
benefit of their experience. It
gives freshmen a wirier range
from which to draw their own
set of responses to new exper
iences.
Those who had been integrated
found it "refreshing when Civ
mid terms came around to be able
to go to dinner and be able to for
get about it for half an hour...
it took a lot of the pressure off."
Close Friends
The women said it seemed
easier to study in an integrated
dorm .. ."when these girls study,
they study and when they play,
they play. When we went to Bran
ner there were girls running up
and down the halls . . . they don't
do that here."
These women expressed the
feeling that many of the upper
class women had become their
close friends; they thought that
it would be impossible to form
this close type of tie with just
one older woman in the corridor
such as the sponsor system pro
vides.
Freshmen living in integrated
houses did not feel they were ex
actly a part of the "unified class,"
but that with more wide spread
integration this would be modi
fied.
One opinion expressed was that
the strong class feeling was not
as important as a stronger unity
throughout the entire student
body.
The integrated freshmen wo
men did feel that perhaps they
had missed something during the

football season. Whore as fresh
men dorms went to the games in
mass, red feathers and all, they
had been surrounded with the less
enthusiastic upperelass women.
This situation is unfortunate,
but with complete integration this
might he eliminated. It is possible
that freshmen would help upper
class women from losing this type
of spirit while they in turn
learned to channel their energy
more effectively. Each group has
something to give to the other,
and as in every situation, it is up
to the individual to utilize the op
portunities around her.
A university housing problem
such as this one is hard to solve.
What is best for the most people?
The great difficulty lies in the
vast variance of individual needs
of the studenst. For some enter
ing the university, living in an in
tegrated system would make the
adjustment harder. They may
not be ready or have had the pre
vious experiences to prepare them
for the little less sympathetic at
mosphere prevailing in an inte
grated house.
Others are craving for this
chance to learn from the upper
classmen; lo try things a little
more on their own right away. It
perhaps in some ways resembles
the men's off-campus living situ
ation . . . some can handle it right
away, some cannot.

vast variance of individual needs
of the studenst. For some enter
ing the university, living in an in
tegrated system would make the
adjustment harder. They may
not be ready or have had the pre
vious experiences to prepare them
for the little less sympathetic at
mosphere prevailing in an inte
grated house.
Others are craving for this
chance to learn from the upper
classmen; lo try things a little
more on their own right away. It
perhaps in some ways resembles
the men's off-campus living situ
ation . . . some can handle it right
away, some cannot.
(This is another in a series of
articles on the sponsor system.)

The problem of which is better
for the freshmen women—all
freshmen dorms or integrated
houses- is one demanding a close
inspection of the objectives of
undergraduate dormitory liviny
and how the individual's needs are
affected by the methods used to
attain these objectives.
The freshmen living in Roble
and Branner generally expressed
satisfaction with the class living
arrangement for freshmen, but
were in favor of more thorough
integration than now exists for
the other three classes.
Those experiencing integration
this year, plus several in Branner
arid Roble, favored integration for
all four classes. To get a clear
enough picture to intelligently dis
cuss the question, it is necessary
to know the arguments for both
sides.
Adjustments
All -freshmen dorm advocates
felt that there are many things
to adjust to during the first year
and that it helps to be in the midst
of others in the same position.
"You understand each oth e r s
problems and this makes things
easier to cope with."
When such things as themes
and Civ mid terms come up, all
are working on the same thing
and it is easy to get assistance
when it is needed.
Freshmen dorms give the new
comer - the opportunity to ease in
to the campus hierarchy. They
feel that if there were integration
the freshmen would just sit back
and not lake the responsibility
that they now assume in their
dorms by the end of the year.
The sponsors provide a certain
contact with upper class women.
They clarify situations for the
freshmen and help guide them
when necessery.

One of the main assets of the
freshmen dorm program seems to
be the feeling of class unity that
is fostered. Some expressed the
feeling that Roble is too far away
from Branner and Wilbur, how
ever.
Integrationists prefer their sys
tem for different reasons which
lead to the same end. They feel
that by living with others who
have gone through the adjust
ment period, freshmen get the
benefit of their experience. It
gives freshmen a wirier range
from which to draw their own
set of responses to new exper
iences.
Those who had been integrated
found it "refreshing when Civ
mid terms came around to be able
to go to dinner and be able to for
get about it for half an hour...
it took a lot of the pressure off."
Close Friends
The women said it seemed
easier to study in an integrated
dorm .. ."when these girls study,
they study and when they play,
they play. When we went to Bran
ner there were girls running up
and down the halls . . . they don't
do that here."
These women expressed the
feeling that many of the upper
class women had become their
close friends; they thought that
it would be impossible to form
this close type of tie with just
one older woman in the corridor
such as the sponsor system pro
vides.
Freshmen living in integrated
houses did not feel they were ex
actly a part of the "unified class,"
but that with more wide spread
integration this would be modi
fied.
One opinion expressed was that
the strong class feeling was not
as important as a stronger unity
throughout the entire student
body.
The integrated freshmen wo
men did feel that perhaps they
had missed something during the

football season. Whore as fresh
men dorms went to the games in
mass, red feathers and all, they
had been surrounded with the less
enthusiastic upperelass women.
This situation is unfortunate,
but with complete integration this
might he eliminated. It is possible
that freshmen would help upper
class women from losing this type
of spirit while they in turn
learned to channel their energy
more effectively. Each group has
something to give to the other,
and as in every situation, it is up
to the individual to utilize the op
portunities around her.
A university housing problem
such as this one is hard to solve.

enthusiastic upperelass women.
This situation is unfortunate,
but with complete integration this
might he eliminated. It is possible
that freshmen would help upper
class women from losing this type
of spirit while they in turn
learned to channel their energy
more effectively. Each group has
something to give to the other,
and as in every situation, it is up
to the individual to utilize the op
portunities around her.
A university housing problem
such as this one is hard to solve.
What is best for the most people?
The great difficulty lies in the
vast variance of individual needs
of the studenst. For some enter
ing the university, living in an in
tegrated system would make the
adjustment harder. They may
not be ready or have had the pre
vious experiences to prepare them
for the little less sympathetic at
mosphere prevailing in an inte
grated house.
Others are craving for this
chance to learn from the upper
classmen; lo try things a little
more on their own right away. It
perhaps in some ways resembles
the men's off-campus living situ
ation . . . some can handle it right
away, some cannot.
(This is another in a series of
articles on the sponsor system.)

The problem of which is better
for the freshmen women—all
freshmen dorms or integrated
houses- is one demanding a close
inspection of the objectives of
undergraduate dormitory liviny
and how the individual's needs are
affected by the methods used to
attain these objectives.
The freshmen living in Roble
and Branner generally expressed
satisfaction with the class living
arrangement for freshmen, but
were in favor of more thorough
integration than now exists for
the other three classes.
Those experiencing integration
this year, plus several in Branner
arid Roble, favored integration for
all four classes. To get a clear
enough picture to intelligently dis
cuss the question, it is necessary
to know the arguments for both
sides.
Adjustments
All -freshmen dorm advocates
felt that there are many things
to adjust to during the first year
and that it helps to be in the midst
of others in the same position.
"You understand each oth e r s
problems and this makes things
easier to cope with."
When such things as themes
and Civ mid terms come up, all
are working on the same thing
and it is easy to get assistance
when it is needed.
Freshmen dorms give the new
comer - the opportunity to ease in
to the campus hierarchy. They
feel that if there were integration
the freshmen would just sit back
and not lake the responsibility
that they now assume in their
dorms by the end of the year.
The sponsors provide a certain
contact with upper class women.
They clarify situations for the
freshmen and help guide them
when necessery.

One of the main assets of the
freshmen dorm program seems to
be the feeling of class unity that
is fostered. Some expressed the
feeling that Roble is too far away
from Branner and Wilbur, how
ever.
Integrationists prefer their sys
tem for different reasons which
lead to the same end. They feel
that by living with others who
have gone through the adjust
ment period, freshmen get the
benefit of their experience. It
gives freshmen a wirier range
from which to draw their own
set of responses to new exper
iences.
Those who had been integrated
found it "refreshing when Civ
mid terms came around to be able
to go to dinner and be able to for
get about it for half an hour...
it took a lot of the pressure off."
Close Friends
The women said it seemed
easier to study in an integrated
dorm .. ."when these girls study,
they study and when they play,
they play. When we went to Bran
ner there were girls running up
and down the halls . . . they don't
do that here."
These women expressed the
feeling that many of the upper
class women had become their
close friends; they thought that
it would be impossible to form
this close type of tie with just
one older woman in the corridor
such as the sponsor system pro
vides.
Freshmen living in integrated
houses did not feel they were ex
actly a part of the "unified class,"
but that with more wide spread
integration this would be modi
fied.
One opinion expressed was that
the strong class feeling was not
as important as a stronger unity
throughout the entire student
body.
The integrated freshmen wo
men did feel that perhaps they
had missed something during the

football season. Whore as fresh
men dorms went to the games in
mass, red feathers and all, they
had been surrounded with the less
enthusiastic upperelass women.
