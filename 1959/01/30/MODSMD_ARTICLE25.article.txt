A Sports Editor lit*tires
Shall I? Or shall I not? That was the question. Could anything
be done about it? This is what the sports staff asked, and sure
enough "No, I won't" was the answer.
LAST COLUMN AS SPOKTS EDITOII Oh, you couldn't write a
drippy sentimental thing, could you? Well, yos, 1 could, but it would
n't look good as l>aili<*s lined garbage cans all over Quad this morn
ing, and besides, there's nothing to be sad about you'll still get to
type up the .Mural Schedule once in a while.
But seriously, it's a little exciting to think back over what has
happened since last September when this very high-paying job he
came yours. Four lull-length columns, a number of shorter ones,
a lew academic "disappointments," and a ream of copy paper later
(not to mention some long nights, late stories, screwy requests, a
couple ul banquets, and a couple of football trips), you're still think
ing and not an awful lot has really passed.
Any memories this writer comes away with are not the kind you
drool over or go into ecstasy about. There hasn't been any sort of
profound contribution to literature (but then all journalism texts say
that sports writers never - do), nor have there been any exclusives
that rocked the nation. We didn't filch any pet names like "Eucalyp
tus Jack," but we did make up one (and this is yours alone), that's
beginning to catch on: AAVVIi, Athletes Alter Wampum, Unite!
BUT ONi; THING IS KCItE All the people you met, all those
that helped, and ;ill lhat you got to see made it one helluva good
time. So thanks. And now that's over now try i«i wrile something
worth reading.
The Subject Is Haskelhall
BASKETBAI.I. Topic A-l right now is the question of jus! how
Howie Dallmur's Tjf) Indians will fare this season when that final
gun sounds. Hate to sound dumb and non-sports-writerlsh about this,
but I don't know how they'll do. Everybody knows what my predic
tion record is, so why jinx the squad by pulling for a "first place"
spot ?
Almost everybody has an idea that Ihe Cards will close out toward
the top, and this is our hope, too, but this team is such an off-again,
on-again squad that no pattern is clear. Wait and see! Don't say
a word.
TRACK Invading the realm of Daily Spoils writer' Dick Barnes
for just a minute, there's more interesting news from Stanford's
always-interesting track coach, Paylon Jordan. He is busy at the
two jobs he does best, training an always-better ! ban-average track
squad and presenting some of the nation's most colorful meets.
Jordan is, in this writer's opinion, anyway, the nation's best show
man-athlete. I lis two concerns arc presenting top-notch athletes in
.the most attention-getting of circumstances.
To Jordan the presentation factor is one which is of vital interest
to the athlete and the spectator. Track, he feels, is one sport which
can really get away from a fan, and every effort to bring it closer
to him, all the while making it more colorful to him. is worth a try.
This season, among other things, it looks like the Card squad will
be wearing colored waistbands so that grand.standers can pick out a
man when he's too far away to be spotted by the number on his
front or his name on his back. What else has Jordan up his sleeve?
Among other things, a well-balanced, hard-fighting squad. Anything
else would be a shame to tell, and a great surprise to see. And besides
that, 1 don't know of anything else right now.
COMING SOON Athletes here at Stanford will be petitioning the
ASSIJ Legislature this week for the approval of a constitution sotting
up a Stanford Student Athletic Organization. We vvoidd like to re
quest that the Legislature devote the necessary time to the fastest
possible approval of this, so that the organization may get its wheels
into gear.
For a long time now it's been our feeling that there should be a
group that can officially represent the opinion of the very large
number of athletes who represent Stanford on the outside but haven't
been able to on the inside.
We Don'l Fit There
LOTS OF RUMORS' —Sports Illustrated magazine came out with
a fairly intelligent, actually sport-minded article this week about the
possible formation of a 12-team national college football league.
.Sports Illustrated isn't the first to bear rumors of this sort, actu
ally they're pretty old. and only the teams mentioned seem to change;
Stanford's Assistant Director of Athletics, Chuck Taylor, denied
reports that we were in on the formation of such a league, and the
fact that there was any more than even talk about such a league is
still a question.
This writer doesn't like to predict at all, but this seems safe to
say. Stanford is not interested in any league of this sort. Further
more, Stanford will never join a league of this sort.
Around here we don't seem to be intereseted in a league of the
country's greatest football powers. We don't fit it now and we don't
want to fit it in the future. This doesn't mean to say that Stanford
has no future hopes of turning out a great football club.
Of course wo do, but when we do it'll be because what we have
has been combined into the magical right proportions. It will not be
because an extensive recruiting program has brought to high bidder
Stanford the best the nation had to offer.
I wouldn't be tolling the truth if I didn't express a wish for an
occasional Rose Bowl club at Stanford, but li!.„ r roi.i oi other people
here, I don't ever- want to see this school turn football-crazy. A little
more student support for the sport, yes, but a loud-mouthed student
body yelling for blood belongs in a coliseum, so to speak.
ALL-OPPONENTS CANDIDATE — Special news sources from
Wilbur Hall report a growing sentiment there to include Otero Spon
sor Bill Tiederman on a list Ireally, any list i of All-Opponents Intra
mural Greats. This seems to have the character of a paid political
announcement.
THAT DOES IT Old spors editor out, new one (Bob Payne) in.
It doesn't make much difference column-wise. IVor does it make
much difference story-wise, except that ho writes much better than
I do. Best of luck, Bob.
