# Cards Go North for Crucials

Stanford begins its fight to
stay above walor in the nip-and
tuck Pacific Coast Conference
basketball race this weekend in
the Northwest, mooting the Uni
versity of Oregon Ducks tonight
at Eugene and the Washington
Huskies tomorrow in Seattle.
The Tribe now stands with a
4-3 conference record, but the
leader, UCLA, is only one game
ahead at 5-2 and it still looks
pretty much like anybody's race.
John Arrillaga, 6-3 Card for
ward who sat out last week's Col
logo of the Pacific game with an
ankle injury, is due to be back
in the slatting lineup tonight
against Oregon. Arrillaga was
showing real signs of hitting his
top scoring stride in the Cal se
ries two weeks ago and should
add real fire power to the attack.
Thuesen Returns
More added scoring should
come with the return to regular
duty of 67 Jerry Thuesen. The
sharp - shooting stringbean saw
his first extensive action since re
turning from a pneumonia attack,
against COP and delivered nine
clutch [joints in the Tribe's sec
ond-half comeback.
Another shining light against
COP was guard Doug Warren,
who popped in 12 important
points. More of the same this
week from the 0-1 senior could
mean lhat long-sought-after five
man scoring punch for Coach
Howie Dallmar.
Neumann stands ,156 points
away from the 1000 mark in ca
reer scoring as a Card. His 17.1
average places him fourth in PCC
standings this season.
Tonight the Tribe will moot the
only team in the conference be
low it irt rebounding. However,
Oregon has two of tho top ton in
dividual r('bounders irr the loop in
Dale Herron and Stu Robertson
and at 0 5 they will have a height
advantage over every Injun but
Thuesen.
Good Guards
Tn the backcourt Coach Steve
Belko has one of the best pairs of
guards in the PCC in 6-1 Chuck
Rask and 5-11 Bud Kuykendall.
Big gun for tho Webfoots this
season has been Robertson, a
junior from Eugene. He was un
able to crack the starting five
last season behind Herron and
All-PCC forward Charlie Frank
lin, but has come on brilliantly
this season to pace the Ducks in
all offensive departments.
Saturday's game will be a re
turn match for the Tribe, but an
other Indian victory would be
rated an even bigger upset than
their 51-49 triumph over the Hus
kies ear lier this month.
Major concern for the Tribe
again, of course, is to stop the
Husky duo of Doug Smart and
Bruno Boin. Smart, a 6-7 giant
who operates all around the bas
ket, has peppered the hoop to the
tune of 19.4 points a game this
yearâ€”tops in the league.
The 6-9 Boin was held to eight
points by Stanford in the first
meeting and has been somewhat
short of his old form all season.
