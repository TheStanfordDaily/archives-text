# Greek Sees Little Hope For Economy
## 
### 
"I have very great doubts as to
the possibilities of solving the
basic economic problems in Gre
ece." 'said Markos Mamalakis, a
Greek Fulbright scholar at the
University of California, at the
lIR cultural talk Thursday.
The Greeks are inclined to ac
tivities which do not "bring re
turns," rather than industrial ac
tivities needed to accomodate the
large population and allieve the
■ever-present poverty, according to
Mamalakis.
Little Solution
Government aid apparently of
fers little to the solution of these
problems, he continued. "Because
of frequent changes in adminis
tration. lack of capital, and mis
use of foreign aid, I think the gov
ernment will be unable to make
the radical changes necessary to
stabilize our economic system."
Mamalakis further noted nega
tive attitudes of the Greek people
toward technological develop
ment. "Our education, for ex
ample, emphasizes the ancient
Greek values, rather than prac
tical training."
Technical Means
"Proud as the Greeks are of
their cultural heritage, and .just
ifiably so." he concluded, "a prac
tical problem such as a stable c
eonomy requires a practical solu
tion the development of techno
logy. This I fail to see as a pos
sibility in the near future."
The program was presented in
conjunction with lIR Travel

programs offered to acquaint stu
dents with the opportunities of
summer travel will be the"I"
Club coffoe hour today from 4-6
