# 'Little Man' Dick Bibler 'On Campus' Yesterday
## 
### Steve Baffrey 
The "Little Man" was back "on
Campus" yesterday.
Artist Dick Bibler, whose "Lit
tle Man on Campus" cartoons ap
pear in more than 300 newspapers
each week, stopped off at Stan
ford yesterday to visit the scene
of his master's degree.
And so the mystery of just
WHERE he did go to school was
solved, though the solution isn't
too simple.
Bibler claims, and is claimed
by, three schools. He "finished a
hitch in the army" and started
work for the Bachelor of Fine
Arts degree at Kansas University
in 1016. This was the year of
famod Prof. Snarf's birth.
At that time the KU school pa
per was holding a cartoon con
test. "I walked into the office
with 11 cartoons I had drawn and
they told me to get busy; il was
going to run every day, and 11

wasn't much of a start."
"I really started cartooning
when I was about 1 1, though," the
artist confides. "The Wichita Ea
gle bought a political cartoon I
drew. It was a period of sit-down
strikes and this was a picture of
a cow sitting on her udder."
Biblei - never thought the "Little
Man" would make him as famous
as it has. "We never had any idea
of selling it. but people began to
write the KU paper to ask where
they could get it."
"It was great at first I didn't
have any expenses. Things arc
different now, though."
To Stanford in '50
Bibler, now an art instructor at
M ontcrc y Peninsula College,
moved to Colorado State to Ret
his A.B. so he could teach. But
then ho decided this wasn't
enough, so came to Stanford in
1930 with his sights set on an M.S.
Who is Prof. Snarl? "I think
I'm turning into Snarf myself,"
Bibler says, and then points to
the thinning hair on his apex.
Are the characters people you
know? "Oh, yes, I know all of
them! But J think I see the teach
er's side more and more now!"
Of his teaching position Bibler
feels "I couldn't draw the 'Little
Man' if I weren't, teaching; it
would be impossible. I feel very
strongly about this situation, and
I'd miss out on all the vocabulary.
Besides, kids are changing all the
time."
More to Come
Bibler, who likes his present
set of cartoons the least of all he
has done, has some promises for
the future. "I think the new set
is the best; it has more slapstick
and incongruity in it. The girls
will be more slick, but homely
Frieda will always be around."

would be impossible. I feel very
strongly about this situation, and
I'd miss out on all the vocabulary.
Besides, kids are changing all the
time."
More to Come
Bibler, who likes his present
set of cartoons the least of all he
has done, has some promises for
the future. "I think the new set
is the best; it has more slapstick
and incongruity in it. The girls
will be more slick, but homely
Frieda will always be around."


BIBLER AND SNARF—CREATOR AND HIS NEMESIS
They're looking more alike all the time
The "Little Man" was back "on
Campus" yesterday.
Artist Dick Bibler, whose "Lit
tle Man on Campus" cartoons ap
pear in more than 300 newspapers
each week, stopped off at Stan
ford yesterday to visit the scene
of his master's degree.
And so the mystery of just
WHERE he did go to school was
solved, though the solution isn't
too simple.
Bibler claims, and is claimed
by, three schools. He "finished a
hitch in the army" and started
work for the Bachelor of Fine
Arts degree at Kansas University
in 1016. This was the year of
famod Prof. Snarf's birth.
At that time the KU school pa
per was holding a cartoon con
test. "I walked into the office
with 11 cartoons I had drawn and
they told me to get busy; il was
going to run every day, and 11

wasn't much of a start."
"I really started cartooning
when I was about 1 1, though," the
artist confides. "The Wichita Ea
gle bought a political cartoon I
drew. It was a period of sit-down
strikes and this was a picture of
a cow sitting on her udder."
Biblei - never thought the "Little
Man" would make him as famous
as it has. "We never had any idea
of selling it. but people began to
write the KU paper to ask where
they could get it."
"It was great at first I didn't
have any expenses. Things arc
different now, though."
To Stanford in '50
Bibler, now an art instructor at
M ontcrc y Peninsula College,
moved to Colorado State to Ret
his A.B. so he could teach. But
then ho decided this wasn't
enough, so came to Stanford in
1930 with his sights set on an M.S.
Who is Prof. Snarl? "I think
I'm turning into Snarf myself,"
Bibler says, and then points to
the thinning hair on his apex.
Are the characters people you
know? "Oh, yes, I know all of
them! But J think I see the teach
er's side more and more now!"
Of his teaching position Bibler
feels "I couldn't draw the 'Little
Man' if I weren't, teaching; it
would be impossible. I feel very
strongly about this situation, and
I'd miss out on all the vocabulary.
Besides, kids are changing all the
