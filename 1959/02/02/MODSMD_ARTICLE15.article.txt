# The 						Starting Point
## 
### 
VoLUMF, 135 . . . ours is a great I niversitv. We means lliis sin
cerely; and as we embark on another volume of The Dailv one
that will prod and challenge some of the policies of our institu
tion — we are hesitant.
It is in order to ask why The Ouilv feels itsell justified or e\en
qualified to challenge the decisions of our I niversity Adminis
tration in any small way, or to suggest new courses for it to lollow.
The answer is a dillicult one. Perhaps a part of the answer is that
one of the things which makes Stanford a truly line university
is its independence an independence that has been engendered
throughout its staff and students. Another part of tin* reason is
that any challenge, if constructive, will keep the Administration
policy-makers thinking and seeking improvement, because fine
ness is far from perfection. In addition, a further part ol our
justildation might come from the fact that we are a part of the
student community whose education is the prime objective ol
administrative decision. In any case, the answer must remain
incomplete.
It is, however, relatively unimportant that this justification is
not complete, because, while we feel that challenging the I niver
sity is a legitimate function of The Daily, it is not the most im
portant one. Our primary obligation is to challenge and stimulate
the thinking of the student. It we can provoke in the student a
serious consideration of what his educational purpose really is,
we will consider one of our major purposes fulfilled.
We feel most qualified to speak in the realm of student affairs.
Throughout this volume we will be commenting on, criticizing,
and recommending solution to the problems we feel are deterrent
to a desirable university atmosphere. Many of these problems are
bound to be controversial. Perhaps, at the outset, it is wise to
explain the reasoning process we will try to follow in arriving
at concrete proposals through a maze of conflicting and seem
inglv incongruent opinions.
The basis of this reasoning process is that before any problem
can be solved it must be placed in proper perspective. This can
only be done if we can construct a clear, descending order of values
and can determine where the various solutions lie on the scale.
In a word, this simply means putting first things fir:*t.
We are optimistic enough to believe that this is possible, be
cause we have a common starting point which everyone can agree
with—mainly, that the unalterable first purpose of college is our
education.
Throughout this volume the problems we deal with and the
solutions we offer must always answer to the test of advancing our
education, a concept we will try to define in a meaningful way
in the process.
Personally and on behalf of the staff, I want to take this op
portunity to compliment Barbara Hicks for her fine work as editor
of Volume 134. We are sincerely looking forward to her contri
butions to Volume 135 as a staff writer.
