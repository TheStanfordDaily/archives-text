'Gooey Article' on Creativity

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wheeler's gooey article in Jan. 21 Daily is a stirring call to
even greater unity of the student mass mind. That such an appeal
should have been made in the name of creative awakening is won
derful indeed. Creative intellctual effort is an individual thing and
grows most happily in a soil of basic rspeet for the individual, fer
tilized by acid discussion of individual opinions. Mass impregnation
of student minds in a compulsory philosophy course is a farce of even
greater absurdity than "Western Civ" iwith its segregated "Libe"
in "Temp Bilge"). If the student should take history (and he
should!), then tell him. "Take history," and let him choose some real
history courses for his requirement.

Impressions of .1 One-tl.iv Yalie
Editor, The Daily:
Recently you published a letter written by Howard Richards, an
ex-Yalie and presently a first-year law student. . . .
Richards insinuates that unless we learn to understand the prob
lems of the world in which we live we may turn into Cambridgians
and walk around with 25-cent editions of Kierkegaard in out' pockets.
But coming from an ex-Yalie, the dig is all in fun, 1 hope. . . .
I would like to recount briefly some of the more intelligent im
pressions which I received during my one land only) day stay in
New Haven, Conn., where Howard acquired his piercing insights.
I arrived at 8 a.m. on the train from New York City. At 9 a.m.
two Yalies were arrested for disturbing the peace; at 10 a.m. a group
of 20 from Davenport College had managed to extract a commode
from the Taft Hotel and were parading it down the street. At 11 a.m.
two innocent "townies" were beaned by flying beer cans. . . .
That afternoon before the football game two seniors received
bloody noses in front of the Beta house; three more acquired the
same shortly after kickoff. When the game ended somewhere around
four o'clock I spied a poor Conn. College sophomore searching fran
tically for her date (who had passed out and slipped into the muek
under the stands). By 5 p.m. the parties were roaring in the various
colleges; so was a fire in the doorway of the "place where Louie
dwells." By six one of the local thinkers had reset the electrical
timetable at the railway station and I thought of the poor Conn.
College sophomore who would undoubtedly miss her train back.
From 7 to 8 there was an ominous lull and at nine, just before 1 left,
I heard a fire truck, siren screaming, go tearing off toward the
Yale Bowl on a false alarm. . . .

two innocent "townies" were beaned by flying beer cans. . . .
That afternoon before the football game two seniors received
bloody noses in front of the Beta house; three more acquired the
same shortly after kickoff. When the game ended somewhere around
four o'clock I spied a poor Conn. College sophomore searching fran
tically for her date (who had passed out and slipped into the muek
under the stands). By 5 p.m. the parties were roaring in the various
colleges; so was a fire in the doorway of the "place where Louie
dwells." By six one of the local thinkers had reset the electrical
timetable at the railway station and I thought of the poor Conn.
College sophomore who would undoubtedly miss her train back.
From 7 to 8 there was an ominous lull and at nine, just before 1 left,
I heard a fire truck, siren screaming, go tearing off toward the
Yale Bowl on a false alarm. . . .

'Gooey Article' on Creativity
J *
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wheeler's gooey article in Jan. 21 Daily is a stirring call to
even greater unity of the student mass mind. That such an appeal
should have been made in the name of creative awakening is won
derful indeed. Creative intellctual effort is an individual thing and
grows most happily in a soil of basic rspeet for the individual, fer
tilized by acid discussion of individual opinions. Mass impregnation
of student minds in a compulsory philosophy course is a farce of even
greater absurdity than "Western Civ" iwith its segregated "Libe"
in "Temp Bilge"). If the student should take history (and he
should!), then tell him. "Take history," and let him choose some real
history courses for his requirement.

Impressions of .1 One-tl.iv Yalie
Editor, The Daily:
Recently you published a letter written by Howard Richards, an
ex-Yalie and presently a first-year law student. . . .
Richards insinuates that unless we learn to understand the prob
lems of the world in which we live we may turn into Cambridgians
and walk around with 25-cent editions of Kierkegaard in out' pockets.
But coming from an ex-Yalie, the dig is all in fun, 1 hope. . . .
I would like to recount briefly some of the more intelligent im
pressions which I received during my one land only) day stay in
New Haven, Conn., where Howard acquired his piercing insights.
I arrived at 8 a.m. on the train from New York City. At 9 a.m.
two Yalies were arrested for disturbing the peace; at 10 a.m. a group
of 20 from Davenport College had managed to extract a commode
from the Taft Hotel and were parading it down the street. At 11 a.m.
two innocent "townies" were beaned by flying beer cans. . . .
