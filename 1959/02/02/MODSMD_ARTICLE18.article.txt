# Wilbur Living Isolates Freshmen
## Integration a Logical, but impractical Solution 
### Leo Krulitz Editor Camille Petersen Staff Editor 
Summing up, the basic problem of the men's
freshman living program appears to be the lack
of contact between freshmen and upperclassmen.
The Wilbur system has generated a separate com
munity apart from the rest of the University.
To freshman women tl isn't as acute a prob
lem mainly because of their dating upperclassmen.
The logical solution to the men's problem would
appear to be integrated housing through all four
years. However, in the final analysis, while inte-

grated housing would be
desirable, it simply isn't
practical with the pres
ent housing facilities
available.
Integrating freshmen
into the independent
men's houses would re
sult in a ratio of 50 per
cent freshmen to 50 per
cent upperclassmen. It is
questionable if this rela
tionship would serve the
purpose of the integra
tion. To arrive at a real
istic- ratio of freshmen to
upperclassmen, r us h
would have to be held
the week before fresh
men started their first
year, and until tho new
fraternity quads are con
structed this seems to be

out of the question.
So then, we are faced with the problem of bring
ing the freshman men into closer contact with the
rest of the University, community within the con
structs of the present sponsor system.
For the women, exchange dinners with other
women's dorms might be helpful. At the present
time, few of the sponsors' upperclass friends visit
the sponsors at the dorms. If more upperclass
women made it a point to drop in on their friends
it might be beneficial for all concerned.
The argument that you make close friendships
in your classes is generally untrue. There is too
much time pressure to get to your next class or
to other engagements to stand around and talk.
Since it seems technically impossible to integrate

Iho freshmen at this time, and contact with the
upperclassmen is important to tlie development
of the freshmen, it seems that these exchange
dinners and conscientious effort on the pail of the
upperclassmen might help alleviate the situation
for the women.
The sincerity and devotion of the sponsors on
the whole isn't to bo questioned. Throughout the
project they have been most helpful and shown a
real concern and conscientiousness about their
position. It is to be hoped that improvements in
the selection system will eliminate the very few
exceptions.
We feel improvement can be made by some
what realigning the criteria on which sponsors

what realigning the cri
teria on which sponsors
arc selected away from
the idea that the most ac
tive students make the
best sponsors and toward
'he thought that sponsor
ing is a full-time respon
sibility even if it means
asking sponsors to go in
active with regard to
their own affiliation.
But how can we make
the freshman men more
a part of the University?
This can be accomplished
by stimulating the con
tact wherever possible:
asking sponsors to have
roommates from differ
ent living areas where
possible i.e., a club man
with a fraternity man,

etc.; bring upperclass
men as guests into independent civ sections; stimu
late upperclass contact within the freshman dorms
by having professors and upperclassmen in the
professor's department visit the dorms to discuss
the department with ihe freshmen who are poten
tial majors.
These things and more like them would lie un
dertaken with the hope that friendships would de
velop and the contact could then he carried on in
a natural and meaningful way.
We will be commenting editorially on the way
to remove the restrictions that presently deter the
freshmen and upperclassmen from following a
meaningful course of contact toward itnellect.ua!

THE INNER COURT AT WILBUR
Freshmen —it's a closed corporation
Summing up, the basic problem of the men's
freshman living program appears to be the lack
of contact between freshmen and upperclassmen.
The Wilbur system has generated a separate com
munity apart from the rest of the University.
To freshman women tl isn't as acute a prob
lem mainly because of their dating upperclassmen.
The logical solution to the men's problem would
appear to be integrated housing through all four
years. However, in the final analysis, while inte-

grated housing would be
desirable, it simply isn't
practical with the pres
ent housing facilities
available.
Integrating freshmen
into the independent
men's houses would re
sult in a ratio of 50 per
cent freshmen to 50 per
cent upperclassmen. It is
questionable if this rela
tionship would serve the
purpose of the integra
tion. To arrive at a real
istic- ratio of freshmen to
upperclassmen, r us h
would have to be held
the week before fresh
men started their first
year, and until tho new
fraternity quads are con
structed this seems to be

out of the question.
So then, we are faced with the problem of bring
ing the freshman men into closer contact with the
rest of the University, community within the con
structs of the present sponsor system.
For the women, exchange dinners with other
women's dorms might be helpful. At the present
time, few of the sponsors' upperclass friends visit
the sponsors at the dorms. If more upperclass
women made it a point to drop in on their friends
it might be beneficial for all concerned.
The argument that you make close friendships
in your classes is generally untrue. There is too
much time pressure to get to your next class or
to other engagements to stand around and talk.
Since it seems technically impossible to integrate

Iho freshmen at this time, and contact with the
upperclassmen is important to tlie development
of the freshmen, it seems that these exchange
dinners and conscientious effort on the pail of the
upperclassmen might help alleviate the situation
for the women.
The sincerity and devotion of the sponsors on
the whole isn't to bo questioned. Throughout the
project they have been most helpful and shown a
real concern and conscientiousness about their
position. It is to be hoped that improvements in
the selection system will eliminate the very few
exceptions.
We feel improvement can be made by some
