# OUTLOOK BLEAK
## English Industry Fears European Trade War 
### 
LONDON (/!') British inrlus
trialists. fearful of an approach
ing trade war. announced Sunday
first countermeasures against the
six â€¢ nation European Common
Market ECM.

After just a month's operation,
the market already is hurting
British manufacturers. Industry
and government fear the outlook
is bleak.
At) influential group led by
Raymond Gordon of Fairey Avia
tion announced it is forming an
organization called the Common
wealth Union of Trade. Its aim is
to build up Commonwealth trade
as an insurance against possible
loss of European markets.
Topline British manufacturers,
big names in the auto and engi
neering industries among them,
already have lost sales outlets
carefully built up in Europe since
World War 11. Their Continental
agents, dealers and merchants
who had been importing British
machines are switching to Ger
man products, which they believe
will benefit most from the ECM
scheme.
The ECM started operating on
J;in. I in France. Germany, Italy,
Belgium. Holland and Luxem
bourg. The six nations cut tariffs
and increased quotas for imports
from fellow members.
About 12 per cent of all Brit
ain's trade is with the six. Al
though it is too early to assess
detailed figures, the British are
clearly anxious.
A spokesman for Ihe Society of
Motor Manufacturers said: "Our
agents on the Conlinent are as
worried as we are.
"If an agent is handling a Brit
ish car in France and sees that in
It) years' time his chances of sell
ing il will be reduced, he natu
rally gels worried."
Franee is the focal point of
British worries. It has more bar
riers against imports than other
members of the six. That makes
the tariff reduced German prod
uct an even bigger attract ion for
French buyers.
