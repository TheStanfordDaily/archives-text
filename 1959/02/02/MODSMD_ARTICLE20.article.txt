# P.O., Bookstore Delayed More
## 
### 
Construction on Stanford's new
post office and bookstore has
been delayed again, but should
begin by early March, reports the
Planning Office.
Construction of the two build
ings on the former site of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon house was
originally slated sometime close
to Feb. 1, but all bids received on
the project exceeded the budget
allocated, said the University Bus
iness Office.
Reasons for the overbudgeting
were:
• Increased labor cost since
part of the budget was drawn up
1 V-i years ago.
• Unexpected costs in raising
the SAE house last summer.
• Slight errors in estimating
construction costs.
The plans are being revised to
trim construction to meet the
budget, reports the Planning Of
fice. If this cannot be done, then
the Planning Office must submit
a new budget to the Board of
Trustees for approval.
