# 'Iolanthe' Called Lively; Dancing Second Act Praised
## 
### Anne Humpherys Mary Ellen White 
Stanford's production of "lo
lanthe," Gilbert and Sullivan's
spoof on the system of peerage,
was, for the most part, lively and
extremely well done.
Gilbert and Sullivan exaggerat
ed characters are among the
hardest to portray, but Robert
Lynch, the Lord Chancellor, along
with Otis Pease as Lord Mountar
arat and William Kinsolving as
Lord Tolloller did an excellent
job. They were sufficiently pom
pous, and the humor of their

characterizations was heightened
rather than lessened by their
overacting and typical Gilbert
and Sullivan bravado.
Claudia Andreasen was a most
convincing Phyllis and her voice
was probably the best of the cast.
Among the secondary characters
Richard Jacqua was a likeable
Strephon, and Richard Bell as
Private Willis made the opening
of the second act particularly en
joyable.
When the extravagant charac
terizations of Gilbert and Sullivan
are not realized, however, the
stage portrayals tend to be flat
and dull.
Mary Jane Lampton's lolanthe
never went beyond this flat por
trayal, and Mary Anderson as
Queen of the Fairies was particu

larly disappointing. Her interpre
tation of her role wavered be
tween being an almost sympa
thetic character and the humor
ous counterpart of the Lord Chan
cellor which Gilbert and Sullivan
had intended. In general, the fair
ies and peers were adequate if
not outstanding.
The choreography and the stag
ing of the production were nearly
professional.
The movement on stage was
smooth and never awkward. Sim
ilarly, this held true for the trans
ition from aria to recitative.
Among the staging effects, the
costumes were good without be
ing elaborate, and the second act
was excellent.
All in all the production was
fresh and delightful, and its good
aspects greatly outweighed it*
weaknesses.

convincing Phyllis and her voice
was probably the best of the cast.
Among the secondary characters
Richard Jacqua was a likeable
Strephon, and Richard Bell as
Private Willis made the opening
of the second act particularly en
joyable.
When the extravagant charac
terizations of Gilbert and Sullivan
are not realized, however, the
stage portrayals tend to be flat
and dull.
Mary Jane Lampton's lolanthe
never went beyond this flat por
trayal, and Mary Anderson as
Queen of the Fairies was particu

larly disappointing. Her interpre
tation of her role wavered be
tween being an almost sympa
thetic character and the humor
ous counterpart of the Lord Chan
cellor which Gilbert and Sullivan
had intended. In general, the fair
ies and peers were adequate if
not outstanding.
The choreography and the stag
ing of the production were nearly
professional.
The movement on stage was
smooth and never awkward. Sim
ilarly, this held true for the trans
ition from aria to recitative.
Among the staging effects, the
costumes were good without be
ing elaborate, and the second act
was excellent.
All in all the production was
fresh and delightful, and its good
aspects greatly outweighed it*
weaknesses.
