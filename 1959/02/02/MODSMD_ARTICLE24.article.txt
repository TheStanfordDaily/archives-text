# Electric Trolley Connected Stanford, Palo Alto
## 
### Judy Sklar 
Mrs. Leland Stanford was
afraid that the new trolleys might
frighten the horses. That was in
the days when students traveled
by surrey and cars were prohibit
ed on Palm Drive.
But then, as now, transporta
tion was a pressing problem
horse-drawn vehicles and bikes
were just too slow for the daily
trip from Palo Alto to the cam
pus.
A trolley had been planned for
years but it was not until 1906
that J. F. Parkinson of Palo Alto
was granted the franchise to put
in an electric street car line.
It opened in Palo Alto on Nov.
15, 1906, and the entire town
turned out to celebrate. Children
were dismissed from school, mer
chants gave discounts, and the
mayor was the conductor on the
first ride. The $500 collected on
that first day was divided equally
among the town's churches.
"Taking Too Long"
For three years following the
opening, Palo Alto citizens wrote
letters to the editor, asking that
a line to the campus be built, com
plaining that it was taking much
too long to be done.
There were problems in getting
a right of way through Stanford:
Mrs. Stanford did not want to
give a permanent right of way as
was usually done. The result was
a 35-year lease, and in 1909, four
red street cars began their run
through the University.
The Toonerville trolleys stalled
down University Avenue to El Ca
mino Real, then followed El Ca
mino to Embarcadero. They cut
through the arboretum past the
stadium and west to Encina, curv
ing through the wheat fields. The
stop was at the side of the Book
store, where an old Negro boot
black had a stand. The car then
crossed Lasuen and made its final
stop in front of the Stanford
Press.
"Yellow Perils"
It was a 10-minute ride from
the SP depot to the campus. A<
first cars left every 20 minutes
from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight, but
later, as the demand increased,
one left every 10 minutes.
The red cars w.ere called Yel
low Perils, for some strange un
known reason, and they filled a
colorful spot in undergraduate
life. Almost every student had a
strong friendship with the con
ductors and motormen. And ev
eryone rode the trolley to Paly

on Friday and Saturday nights.
The cars were filled to capacity
for all athletic events, and for
Big Game extra cars were always
brought up from San Jose. For
one Big Game ride, the conduc
tor collected 198 five-cent fares.
It was a little crowded since the
car's capacity was 50 persons.
Subject of Pranks
Students soon discovered that
the cars could be tipped fore or
aft by the proper application of
weight by a certain number of
the football squad, and that if the
trolley poles were pulled away
from the overhead wires, the car
could not move. However, if they
were put back correctly, the car
would go in the opposite direc
tion.
In one case when students
pulled out the pole, the motor
men pursued them all the way
around the car at full speed.
When they suddenly let go of it,
the pole sprang back up, missed
the trolley wire and hit the cam
pus power line, causing a short
circuit all over campus.
The motormen always left the
cars parked near the Palo Alto
depot when they left for the
night, One morning one was
found abandoned at Encina after
students had had their ride home.
Soaped Hails
Soaping the rails was another
happy pastime. The cars would
sometimes skate 50 feet before
they could be brought under con
trol.
The men at Encina, notorious
for their tricks, enjoyed blocking
the tracks either by leaving their
pullcart for bonfire wood on the
tracks or by forming a continu
ous line across them.
Tying a rope between two trees
to knock the trolley off the wire
was another favorite stunt. And
ha/.ers pushing peanuts along the
rails often held up the cars.
Free riders rode on the roof
and cow-catcher. The Railway
Company ran an advertisement in
the Palo Alto Times in 1920.
"The Peninsular Railway Com
pany will not be responsible for
any injury or accident happening
to any person while such a per
son is stealing a ride on any of its
cars.
A Warning
"The practice of pulling trolley
poles from wires, riding fenders,
and other nuisances must be dis
continued, or the parties guilty
of same will be prosecuted under
the laws in such cases provided."
In 1921, the Railway Company

proposed an increase in fare from
six cents to seven (the five-cent
fare had been raised earlier). And
the student body objected violent
ly on the grounds that poor serv
ice was providedâ€”so many parts
were out of commission that the
cars were always being repaired.
There were never enough to
transport the students.
One brave soul wrote a letter
to the Palo Alto Times defending
the transit lines, saying that stu
dents had removed headlights,
globes, car signs, switch irons,
seats and windows. They had
broken off side guards climbing
to the roof for free rides. They
complained that the roof was
warped and broken and unfit for
a rainy day after they had
bounced on it continually.
Six-Cent Fare
But when the car made its last
run in 1929 ,the fare was still six
cents.
After the First World War
when automobiles were gaining
popularity, trolley revenue de
clined sharply. The franchises
and the rights of way were aban

doned in 1929.
And the transit company sched
uled the Toonerville trolley's last
run for 11:27 p.m. Sunday, Oct.
20, 1929. The bus was to begin
the University route at 6:25 a.m.
Monday.
At 10 p.m. a procession of
mourners in black bands, scar ves
of crepe and gloomy academic
gowns boarded the trolley, their
heads bowed so low in grief that
they could not drop in their fares.
They solemnly announced that
they planned to ride the car all
night.
Last Hide
The railway company, expect
ing such a maneuver, immediate
ly ordered that that be the last
ride. And so it was.
But between dusk and dawn, at
the campus terminal bedecked
with serpentine, a ceremony of
cremation was held. A pile of
barrels, railroad crossing signs
and grass was burning brightly
when campus police arrived on
the scene. No students were
around though they were all in
the dorms, sick with grief.
