With the bias! of the old Stan-j
ford fire whislle seven student
firemen drop their books, run out j
of lecture halls, or dispense with
whatever else I hey are doing and
run for the fire house.
These are the men who are
working their way through Stan
ford by fighting fire for our]
unique fire department, which is
manned by 10 regular and 11 stu

dent firemen who take turns ev
ery other clay working 24-hour
shifts.
Under the veteran direction of
John M. Marston, chief of the
University division, the primarily
student organization battles from
150 to 300 fires a year to protect
the school's $05 million worth of
property which ranges over more
than 8000 acres of land.
Chief Marston, who was elected

I last year president of the Cali
j fornia Fire Chiefs Association, ex

Even though Ihe traffic prob
lem is making travel difficult to
any point on our huge campus,
Stanford's rugged student and
regular "smoke • chasers" rarely
fail to make a blaze inside the
five-minute limit that is the most

critical in determining whether it
will be cord rolled or lost.
Chief Marston pointed out that
in the many years that he has
been working on the Stanford fire
crew, he has never known there
to be a fire casualty. This perfect
record, he said, is due largely to
the co-operation and efforts of the
students themselves, not firemen.
