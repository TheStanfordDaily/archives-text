# PLANNING OFFICE
## Campus Buildings Planned to Unify 
### Mary Lou Mckinley 
Using a scale model of Stanford
as a guide to future architecture
that will harmonize with lhe pres
ent landscape, the Planning Of
fice is constantly brainstorming
in an attempt to get variety and

a congeniality with nature in Uni
versity buildings.
The office has llic responsibility
of keeping available a constant
supply of ideas concerning Stan
ford's physical environment to the
faculty, staff, students and Ad
ministration for use in develop
ing the educational facilities clear
ly needed by the University. Eld
ridge T. Spencer, director of plan
ning, explained recently.
Trustees' Approval
Continuing, he said that the of
fice "doesn't need official sanc
tion to think about projects," but
when it comes to actual design
and construction and putting
things down to a money basis, the
agreement of the Board of Trus
tees and the Administration (in
cluding the faculty and studentsi
is necessary.
Certain preferences have to
mesh before a project can be
started, he said. The Planning
Office, faculty. Board of Trustees
and money sources all have ideas
as to which buildings should be
built first, but, since the Univer
sity is an educational institution,
the faculty has much of the say.
And if the students really get be
hind a project and support it,
Spencer added, their wishes are
taken into consideration and acted
upon.
Architect Hired
When the want and need for a
building or buildings are finally
decided upon, and agreement is
reached as to its being built, an
architect is hired. The Planning
Office then presents its prelimi
nary thinking on the project, per
forming the function of an owner.
This saves the architect from the
necessity of research and confer
ences with professors, and results
in better communication between
him and the University.
Buildings for the University are
not designed by the office, but. in
an attempt to keep outside ideas

flowing in, architects are hired
and retained to do a single job.
Design Reviewed
Once the design has been com
pleted, it is reviewed by many
University parties, any of which
may request changes in the plans.
First it goes to the Business Of
fice; then to the president's Ad
visory Committee on Land and
Building Development, composed
of faculty representatives, who
see that the building's character
and organization are compatible
with the educational philosophy
of the University.
The final decision rests with the
Board of Trustees, who review the
design and then receive a scale
model of the building in its Uni
versity setting. This model is kept
in the Planning Office and used
to see what the buildings will real
ly look in their University sur
roundings. Paper is useful and
practical to a point, Spencer said,
but, beyond Ihat, study models
which show the building's relation
to the University circulation, ar
chitecture and landscape are in
valuable.
When all parties involved final
ly agree on the building's plans, it
goes into the process of being
built.
Final Decision
The decision to build or rebuild
also starts with the faculty and
the president; then goes to the
Board of Trustees, who decide def
initely which project to take up.
When a really large project is
begun, such as the Medical School
and Hospital, a separate planning
office is organized which becomes
self-liquidating at the project's
completion. Since planning is
more a problem of ideas and guid
ance than complicated administra
tive organization, the staff is kept
as small as possible.
The office staff includes M. H.
L. Sanders Jr.. associate director
of planning; John S. Lynd. assist
ant director; Oscar F. Nelson Jr.,
landscape architect; and Zach
Stewart, staff assistant.
Current Projects
Some of the office's current
projects include the preliminary
programing of the Undergraduate
Library, supervision of the design
of the Bookstore-Post Office com
plex, a study of student housing,
continuing design and develop
ment of the pedestrian-ways, su
pervision of the design of the pe
ripheral road, and a continuing
study on University traffic, circu
lation and parking.
Unify Campus
University planning takes in a
much broader aspect than merely
buildings, Spencer emphasized.
"Tied to conservation," it concerns
land forms and outer lands and
fields, emphasizing the over-all at
mosphere of the campus and tied
to the conviction that, in Spen
cer's words, "the whole University
should continue to be more im
portant than any one of its parts."
"We wan t 110 'show-offs' in
building design," Spencer said,
citing several domed, block-like
edifices which graced the campus
in the years before the big earth
quake. Besides the fact that one
isolated building leads to deterio
ration, he added, "imposing build
ings designed separately from
their neighbors tend to control
the mind; and a mind should be
free to think and expand."

Continuing, he said that the of
fice "doesn't need official sanc
tion to think about projects," but
when it comes to actual design
and construction and putting
things down to a money basis, the
agreement of the Board of Trus
tees and the Administration (in
cluding the faculty and studentsi
is necessary.
Certain preferences have to
mesh before a project can be
started, he said. The Planning
Office, faculty. Board of Trustees
and money sources all have ideas
as to which buildings should be
built first, but, since the Univer
sity is an educational institution,
the faculty has much of the say.
And if the students really get be
hind a project and support it,
Spencer added, their wishes are
taken into consideration and acted
upon.
Architect Hired
When the want and need for a
building or buildings are finally
decided upon, and agreement is
reached as to its being built, an
architect is hired. The Planning
Office then presents its prelimi
nary thinking on the project, per
forming the function of an owner.
This saves the architect from the
necessity of research and confer
ences with professors, and results
in better communication between
him and the University.
Buildings for the University are
not designed by the office, but. in
an attempt to keep outside ideas

flowing in, architects are hired
and retained to do a single job.
Design Reviewed
Once the design has been com
pleted, it is reviewed by many
University parties, any of which
may request changes in the plans.
First it goes to the Business Of
fice; then to the president's Ad
visory Committee on Land and
Building Development, composed
of faculty representatives, who
see that the building's character
and organization are compatible
with the educational philosophy
of the University.
The final decision rests with the
Board of Trustees, who review the
design and then receive a scale
model of the building in its Uni
versity setting. This model is kept
in the Planning Office and used
to see what the buildings will real
ly look in their University sur
roundings. Paper is useful and
practical to a point, Spencer said,
but, beyond Ihat, study models
which show the building's relation
to the University circulation, ar
chitecture and landscape are in
valuable.
When all parties involved final
ly agree on the building's plans, it
goes into the process of being
built.
Final Decision
The decision to build or rebuild
also starts with the faculty and
the president; then goes to the
Board of Trustees, who decide def
initely which project to take up.
When a really large project is
begun, such as the Medical School
and Hospital, a separate planning
office is organized which becomes
self-liquidating at the project's
completion. Since planning is
more a problem of ideas and guid
ance than complicated administra
tive organization, the staff is kept
as small as possible.
The office staff includes M. H.
L. Sanders Jr.. associate director
of planning; John S. Lynd. assist
ant director; Oscar F. Nelson Jr.,
landscape architect; and Zach
Stewart, staff assistant.
Current Projects
Some of the office's current
projects include the preliminary
programing of the Undergraduate
Library, supervision of the design
of the Bookstore-Post Office com
plex, a study of student housing,
continuing design and develop
ment of the pedestrian-ways, su
pervision of the design of the pe
ripheral road, and a continuing
study on University traffic, circu
lation and parking.
Unify Campus
University planning takes in a
much broader aspect than merely
buildings, Spencer emphasized.
"Tied to conservation," it concerns
land forms and outer lands and
fields, emphasizing the over-all at
mosphere of the campus and tied
to the conviction that, in Spen
cer's words, "the whole University
should continue to be more im
portant than any one of its parts."
"We wan t 110 'show-offs' in
building design," Spencer said,
citing several domed, block-like
edifices which graced the campus
in the years before the big earth
quake. Besides the fact that one
isolated building leads to deterio
ration, he added, "imposing build
ings designed separately from
their neighbors tend to control
the mind; and a mind should be
free to think and expand."

And if the students really get be
hind a project and support it,
Spencer added, their wishes are
taken into consideration and acted
upon.
Architect Hired
When the want and need for a
building or buildings are finally
decided upon, and agreement is
reached as to its being built, an
architect is hired. The Planning
Office then presents its prelimi
nary thinking on the project, per
forming the function of an owner.
This saves the architect from the
necessity of research and confer
ences with professors, and results
in better communication between
him and the University.
Buildings for the University are
not designed by the office, but. in
an attempt to keep outside ideas

flowing in, architects are hired
and retained to do a single job.
Design Reviewed
Once the design has been com
pleted, it is reviewed by many
University parties, any of which
may request changes in the plans.
First it goes to the Business Of
fice; then to the president's Ad
visory Committee on Land and
Building Development, composed
of faculty representatives, who
see that the building's character
and organization are compatible
with the educational philosophy
of the University.
The final decision rests with the
Board of Trustees, who review the
design and then receive a scale
model of the building in its Uni
versity setting. This model is kept
in the Planning Office and used
to see what the buildings will real
ly look in their University sur
roundings. Paper is useful and
practical to a point, Spencer said,
but, beyond Ihat, study models
which show the building's relation
to the University circulation, ar
chitecture and landscape are in
valuable.
When all parties involved final
ly agree on the building's plans, it
goes into the process of being
built.
Final Decision
The decision to build or rebuild
also starts with the faculty and
the president; then goes to the
Board of Trustees, who decide def
initely which project to take up.
When a really large project is
begun, such as the Medical School
and Hospital, a separate planning
office is organized which becomes
self-liquidating at the project's
completion. Since planning is
more a problem of ideas and guid
ance than complicated administra
tive organization, the staff is kept
as small as possible.
The office staff includes M. H.
L. Sanders Jr.. associate director
of planning; John S. Lynd. assist
ant director; Oscar F. Nelson Jr.,
landscape architect; and Zach
Stewart, staff assistant.
Current Projects
Some of the office's current
projects include the preliminary
programing of the Undergraduate
Library, supervision of the design
of the Bookstore-Post Office com
plex, a study of student housing,
continuing design and develop
ment of the pedestrian-ways, su
pervision of the design of the pe
ripheral road, and a continuing
study on University traffic, circu
lation and parking.
Unify Campus
University planning takes in a
much broader aspect than merely
buildings, Spencer emphasized.
"Tied to conservation," it concerns
land forms and outer lands and
fields, emphasizing the over-all at
mosphere of the campus and tied
to the conviction that, in Spen
cer's words, "the whole University
should continue to be more im
portant than any one of its parts."
"We wan t 110 'show-offs' in
building design," Spencer said,
citing several domed, block-like
edifices which graced the campus
in the years before the big earth
quake. Besides the fact that one
isolated building leads to deterio
ration, he added, "imposing build
ings designed separately from
their neighbors tend to control
the mind; and a mind should be
free to think and expand."
