# Second Half Uprisings Win, Lose for Tribe
## Neumann Blasts Oregon— Then Smart Ruins Stanford DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Bob Payne, Sports Editor 
Second halves can change the complexion of a basketball game
mighty fast, and Stanford found this out last weekend by winning a
game and losing a game due to second-half splurges.
Friday, the Paul Neumann paced Tribe roared past a bewildered

Oregon five at the start of the st

>cond half and raced on to a 57-49
win. Saturday, after staying close
lo red-hot Washington for a half,
I he Indians were left far in t !it>
distance by an 'amazing 53-point
Husky second half and came out
rather decisive 75-52 losers.
Thus, Coach Howie Da Ulnar's
Cards returned home vviih a 5-4
conference record and only Iwo
games away from home left on
jthe conference schedule. The In
dians take this week off and re
jlurn to action next week with
home games against Oregon and
Southern California.
Split Achieved
Most Stanford backers hoped
for nothing belter lhan a splil iir
Ihe Northwest series, and the
Cards became assured of that
with a fine comeback win Friday
night.
Ice-cold shooting on the Cards'
pari and effective driving and de
fensing by Oregon left Stanford
down, 27-23, at intermission of
Friday's game in Eugene.
Dick llaga looked like the only
Indian on the floor at the outset
as lie racked up the Tribe's first
6 points, and <s of the first 11, as
Oregon h e I d a slim m a r g in
through most of the early going.
The veteran Card center ran
afoul of the whistle-tooters, how
ever, and picked up four quick
personals in the first half, to be
relegated to part-time duty on the
bench.
But the tiring that thrilled Duck
fans most about the first half was
that Stanford's great guard Paul
Neumann was being held to two
points by Chuck Rask. while Rask
was picking up nine himself and
having arr all-around fine evening.
Good-bye, Chuck
The teams had hardly taken the
floor for the second half when
Neuman had caught up with and
passed Rask, and Stanford had
caught up with and passed Ore
gon.
Neumann started the second
half by driving for a quick lay-in
to reduce the margin to two
points. Seconds later Jerry Thue
sen drilled one to tie it up, and
then John Arrillaga potted a free
throw to put the Tribe ahead
and off to the races.
Before the Ducks were able to
come around, Stanford had reeled
off 11 straight points for a 3-1-27
lead and was never seriously
threatened after that.
Neumann went on to rack up
17 -second-half points for a game
total of 19. Rask managed one
point in the second half and also
found himself fouled out.
Same Medicine
But a little of the same treat
ment was awaiting the Tribe in
Seattle Saturday night.
Doug Smart, 6-7 Washington
center who topped the league in
scoring, went on a second-half
spree of his own that really snow
ed the Indians. Smart, held to
two free throws in the first half,
came back to put away 19 second
half markers and pace the huge
Husky surge.
The game started at an incredi
bly slow pace, with almost three
minutes going by before either
team scored. Washington held a
22-17 lead at halftime, and it look
ed at that point like Stanford was
still very much in the running.
With Bruno Boin meshing his
big hook shots, the Huskies were
able to keep the Tribe at bay until
Smart caught fire.
Ilaga topped the Cards with 1(5

points as Neumann was held out
of double figures for' only the sec
ond time this year, picking up
nine points.
