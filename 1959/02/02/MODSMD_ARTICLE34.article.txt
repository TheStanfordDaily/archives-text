### 
Stanford's wrestlers dropped
their- third match of the season
to Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo
Friday. The Cards managed only
one decision in the 26-3 Cal Poly
triumph.
Captain Dick Denny deeisioned
his opponent to gain Stanford's
three points. Again the Indians
were forced lo forfeit two match
es for lack of men in the weight
divisions.
High spot of the matches was
the exhibitions. Stanford's frosh
won four of five of these exhibi
tions, and Coach Hardin of Cal
Poly said Stanford would be a
team to fear in the future.
