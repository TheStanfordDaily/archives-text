# Discus Picture Looks Up
## 
### 
Stanford took a big step toward
solving its discus problems Satur
day in AAU developmental com
petition on Angell Field.
Don Bell, the freshman platter
man from Alameda, hit a season's
topper of 159 feet. But the big
gest surprise was the 157-9 turned
in by junior Harlan Lirnmer. It
was Limmer's best-ever by near ly
eight feet.
And Armand DeWeese got in on
the act. too, with a throw of 154
feet.
Tribe coach Payton Jordan im
mediately predicted that all three
would be over 160 feet before
long. Bell, of course, is still a year
away from varsity competition.
But if the other two move into
point-scoring range they will be
giving Stanford more strength in
the discus than had been antici
pated earlier this year.
Second highlight of the weekly
competition was the high school
mile, when Genre I.inn <>112 Palo
Alto stepped off an excellent I:-

122.1. Bill Yaley of Serra ran 4:23,
|and Dave Boore of Los Altos was
third irr 4:25.6.
Dean Smith and Norm Pease
took turns winning the sprints in
10.1 and 22.0 respectively.
