# New Defense Budget

"Till: \i \IVI KNANCE of general peace and a possible reduction of
the excessive armaments which weigh down upon all nations
present themselves, in the actual present situation of the world,
as the ideal toward which should tend the eflorts of all govern
ments.
. . The present time is very favorable for seeking, through
the method of an international conlereiu'c, the most cflective means
of a real and lasting peace, and of placing helnre all the question
of ending the progressive development ol existing armaments.
"7 he ever-increasing financial expense touches public
prosperity lit its very source; the intellectual ami physical
powers of the people- labor anil capital are, in a great
measure, turned asitle from their natural functions and
consumed unproductively. Hundreds of millions arc used
in acquiring fearful engines of destruction which, today
considered as the highest triumph of scieni'P, are ileshncd
tomorrow to lose all their value because of some new dis

These words did not come Irom Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Dulles,
or Eisenhower, although they have a lamiliar ring. Perhaps some
can identify them as heing excerpts from the first Muraviev circu
lar, presented to diplomats from I I ol the world's powers at the
request of Tzar Nicholas II of Kussia in I }{')}{.
Sixty-one years later diplomats are making essentially the same
speeches. Most recently the foreign Minister ol the U.S.S.R.,
Andrei Cromyko, has stated that with the growing might ol the
Communist hloc, implying their nuclear missile superiority, a new
world war "would he impossible/' Vct Western officials realize
that Soviet capital, technology and natural resources are still chan
neled into "top priority heavy industry and armaments.
C.ornmunism advocates the overthrow of democracy â€”a
fact which Western, and in particular I nited Slates, policy
makers must not forget. The problem of how much to
spend and on what is a knotty one: concerned are not only
the people of the II.S. bur also the peoples of our non-
Communist allies. Ihe commitments are both spedfic and
moral.
The debates raging on Capitol Hill over President Eisenhower's
budget appropriations for defense have been presented to the
reading public in a rather narrow, national political light, we feel.
Is the question "How much to spend for defense to lie resolved
by the formula "How to win the next election t On the broader
scene, should any nation's foreign policy, in a world where isola
tion is virtually impossible, be conducted with the primary con
sideration being the effect on national politics?
It is generally recognized that in the event of another global
war the result would he almost total annihilation. Under these
conditions, is nuclear war likely?
We rather suggest that today the battlegrounds of the
world are wherever there is squalor, poverty, ignorance;
wherever there are dissatisfied, hungry peoples; wherever
there is piditical, economic, or social frustration.
These battles are not fought with nuclear weapons, nor are they
fought with money alone, or sympathetic handouts, first of all,
we would suggest, to win these battles one needs, first, understand
ing and appreciation of the hopes, dreams and fears of these peo
ples, and then should come the financial, technical and personal
aid to help these peoples help themselves.
What should be our defense budget, and why? 11 cin
the United States have the often-ignored and certainly
unrealized privilege of voicing our opinions of making
ourselves heard.
Editorials are written to provoke thought, and we would hope
that, in addition to thought, our readers would make known their
opinions on this question, which we feel vitall) concerns them.
