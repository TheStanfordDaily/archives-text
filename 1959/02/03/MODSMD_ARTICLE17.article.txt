Faint-Hearted Authors
Editor, The Daily:
A letler was printed in last Fri
day's Daily which began, "Mr.
Prier was simply too kind-heart
ed to objectively criticize . . The
letter continued with criticism of
the reviewer and irresponsible
statements of personal opinion
about the performance, couched
un unnecessarily vindictive
phrases. We say "irresponsible
statements" because the authors
of the letter were apparently too
taint hearted to allow their names
to appear with the letter.
Unfortunately, the authors'
criticisms also showed a fair
amount of ignorance concerning

musical -matters. Perhaps igno
rance is excusable. But we can
not understand the decision of the
editor of The Daily to publish a
letter- by people who made such
ir responsible, abusive and useless
comments and then desired to
have their names withheld.
We were al the concert. We
have heard many other people
perforin the concei ti and the Fan
tasia and Fugue. We thoroughly
enjoyed this performance! It is
inconceivable to us that a careful
listener could make complaints as
ridiculous as those expressed by
the authors of the unsigned let
ter.
