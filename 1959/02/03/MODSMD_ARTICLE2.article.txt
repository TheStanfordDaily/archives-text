# Network News Coverage Down
## 
### 
Rising costs and pressures from sponsors were ciled last week
hy news commentators Erie Sevareid and Martin Agronsky as the
causes which are forcing radio and television networks to drop pro
grams reporting on the news in depth.
The two commentators discussed the problems of network news
broadcasting on the television forum "The Press and the People,"
produced in Host on under a grant from the Fund for the Republic.
Citing the pressures brought to bear on television commentators,
Agronsky said he lost 21 sponsors for one comment on General
Mac Arthur. He also reported losing sponsors as a result of "influ
ence brought to bear" by Senator Joseph McCarthy.
Sevan id blamed the bigness of the networks, saying "The bigger
our information media, the less courage and freedom of expression
they allow."
lie said that I he enormous investment involved in network presen
tations force the advertisers to find a "great denominator" 1o de
crease the risk involved in their investment. He added that the same
problem faced the big movie companies and publishers of Ihe mass
media magazines.
Sponsors Prefer Yarirlv. WVslcrns
Agronsky added that sponsors would rather spend the money in
volved in a network presentation for variety or Western programs
that would get them a larger audience for their investment.
IJoi.h men agreed television adds a new dimension to journalism
in bringing the voice, facial expression and attitudes of the speaker
to the audience. Sevareid also said that only the big networks could
possibly do some of the shows that are now being presented.
"Understanding without feeling is not understanding. Facts arc
nothing by themselves." This statement by Archibald MacLeish,
Sevareid called a good standard for judging news reporting.
He called the "massive reporting of facts" in the New York Times
"a great divorcement of factual knowledge from human understand
ing which MacLeish thinks is a danger to our whole civilization."
"1 don't think that the normal daily 10-minute television news
programs are successful in terms of content or giving people under
standing. I don't think they ever can be. You'd be better off oil 1.1
minutes listening to radio, listening to someone really giving ii to
you," he said.
Lack of Washington INews
Only Iwo or three minutes are devoted lo I lie news from Wash
ington in the average 15-tninute broadcast, Agronsky said. "1 defy
anyone to cover Washington in two or 111 roe minutes."
"There is a sense of television and also radio as part of a public
trust," he continued. "It belongs to everybody. This is partly because
of the way it started with a government hold on it parceling out wave
lengths.
"Television and radio have become national whipping boys; news
papers are not. And this atmosphere, coupled with the endless moni
toring by committee and otherwise, gives it a relationship with gov
ernment which the press does not have.
"All this has created an atmosphere where it takes a fairly bravo
TV station owner lo go right out and editorialize, although I think
he should."
Agronsky added that he felt (here is a general feeling that be
cause of the tremendous audience involved, limitations and restric
tions are applied to television which are not applied lo newspapers.
1 le felt this was wrong.

volved in a network presentation for variety or Western programs
that would get them a larger audience for their investment.
IJoi.h men agreed television adds a new dimension to journalism
in bringing the voice, facial expression and attitudes of the speaker
to the audience. Sevareid also said that only the big networks could
possibly do some of the shows that are now being presented.
"Understanding without feeling is not understanding. Facts arc
nothing by themselves." This statement by Archibald MacLeish,

"1 don't think that the normal daily 10-minute television news
programs are successful in terms of content or giving people under

of the way it started with a government hold on it parceling out wave
lengths.

papers are not. And this atmosphere, coupled with the endless moni
toring by committee and otherwise, gives it a relationship with gov
ernment which the press does not have.
"All this has created an atmosphere where it takes a fairly bravo
TV station owner lo go right out and editorialize, although I think
he should."
Agronsky added that he felt (here is a general feeling that be
cause of the tremendous audience involved, limitations and restric
