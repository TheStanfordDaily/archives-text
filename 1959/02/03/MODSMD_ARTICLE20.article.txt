When Secretary of State John |
Foster Dulles begins his Euro- j
pean conferences, he will find a j
considerable feeling that now,
when the Soviet Union needs ;i
lessening of tensions in order 1o
push her new economic pro- j
grams, is the time to seek far
reaching agreements.
This feeling is more pro-!
nouneed in Britain, through the
press and the utterances of Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan, than
in Bonn and Paris.
Macmillan has repeatedly advo
cated a more flexible approach
than the others, and even than <
Dulles and President Eisenhower, j
Dulles and Eisenhower are on I
record as wishing to explore ev-j
ery possibility. Equally strongly i
they have expressed doubt as to
the ultimate value of agreements
with tho Soviet Union. The doubt 1

I applies especially to agreements
reached in a time of temporary
I expediency for the Communists,
I whose zigzag tactics are remem
bered.
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of
Fast Germany and President
j Charles dc Gaulle of France are
j wary of piecemeal suggestions,
I such as demilitarization of Ger
! many. They doubt the efficacy of
| anything less than general dis
armament.
Britain and the United States
are willing at least to consider
whether any piecemeal step can
be taken in the expectation of
broader advances later.
And in the background of all
| the discussions, including any
| negotiations with the U.S.S..R.
which may eventuate, is the Al
lied desire to talk the Kremlin out
of its threatened unilateral
1 change in the status of Berlin.
