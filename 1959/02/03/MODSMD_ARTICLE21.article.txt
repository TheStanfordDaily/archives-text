## Prospects Good for Legislation Securing Negroes Right to Vote 
### Walter Lippmann 
Ii would ho a good tiling if Con
gress could deal with civil rights
legislation early in the session.
For |ater on, especially in the
spring and during the summer,
there arc likely to he many dis
tractions. There will he the usual
traffic jam of hills, and in all pro
liability there will he spectacular
events in foreign affairs.
It will he useful to take stock
of the present position, as seen
from the point of view of those
who wish to realize, not to resist
and to nullify, the enjoyment hy
Negroes of the constitutional
rights which are now denied to
them. More precisely, we may
ask ourselves what is the situa
tion in the field of affirmative
action hy Congress?
Better I'rospocts
The answer, broadly speaking,
is that legislation to protect the
light to vote has a far better
prospect than legislation directed
against segregation in the public
schools. It has a better prospect
of being passed by Congress with
out a serious filibuster, and it has
a better prospect of being ac
cepted and observed in all but the
deepest and darkest South.
There is, of course, a close con
nection between the degree ol' re
sistance to a bill in the Senate
and the degree of resistance to a
law in Ihe states affected.
For all practical purposes one
may say that civil rights legis
lation which is opposed by vir
tually all the Southern states will
in practice he nullified in the
Southern states.
Right to Vote
Beginning in the late summer
of 1957, it has become clear that,
in respect to Congress, the road
forward is that of legislation to
protect the right to vote. This
was shown in the Civil Rights
Act of 1957, the first civil rights
legislation of any kind to pass
Congress since the end of the Re
construction period. This act au
thorized Federal intervention in
the states to protect the right to
vote. It was passed without a
filibuster when, but only when,
the Administration agreed to de
lete what was known as Part 111,
which would have authorized Fed
eral intervention against segre
gation in the public schools.
This d is t» n c t i o ir between
votes and schools is in practice
today the distinction between
what Congress may be able to

deal with effectively and what
it cannot now hope to legislate
about or to enforce it it could
legislate.
This distinction is at the core
of the Johnson compromise on
the rules about cloture to stop a
filibuster. In this compromise ihe
Southerners in effect agreed not
to filibuster against legislation to
protect political lights if they re
tained the power to filibuster
against legislation about social
rights. Rule XXII as amended
says that legislation may be kil
led hy filibuster if the whole
South is united against the legis
lation.
Eisenhower's ('omment
The existence of this distinc
tion has now been confirmed as
the working rule both hy Presi
dent Eisenhower and Sen. Lyndon
Johnson. The President did this
at the National Press Club con
ference on Wednesday. January
14th. lie was asked this question:
"In 1957 Congress passed at your
suggestion a civil rights bill deal
ing largely with voting. Do you
think the Congress should pass
civil rights legislation dealing
specifically with problems aris
ing from school segregation?"
The President replied, "I think
when we get into Ihe field of law
here we must be very careful.
I do believe in the law concerning
voting ..."
A few days later, Sen. Johnson
introduced his program to pro
tect civil rights, it is a bill to ex
tend the life of the Civil Rights
Commission, to do something a
bout the bombings in the South-

ern states, to sot up a mediation
and conciliation service in racial
conflicts and to give the Attorney
General subpoena powers under
the voting rights law. On the cen
tral distinction between voting
rights and school desegregation,
the President and Sen. Johnson
are agreed in principle.
This, then, is for the time heing,
Ilie way forward to use the Fed
eral power to enable qualified Ne
groes to vole. II ibis can be ac
complished, ii will make a great
difference. For insofar as the Ne
gro people arc able to vote in the
deep South, there will be as Sen.
Johnson said, "plenty they can do
to help themselves."

Better I'rospocts
The answer, broadly speaking,
is that legislation to protect the
light to vote has a far better
prospect than legislation directed
against segregation in the public
schools. It has a better prospect
of being passed by Congress with
out a serious filibuster, and it has
a better prospect of being ac
cepted and observed in all but the
deepest and darkest South.
There is, of course, a close con
nection between the degree ol' re
sistance to a bill in the Senate
and the degree of resistance to a
law in Ihe states affected.
For all practical purposes one
may say that civil rights legis
lation which is opposed by vir
tually all the Southern states will
in practice he nullified in the
Southern states.
Right to Vote
Beginning in the late summer
of 1957, it has become clear that,
in respect to Congress, the road
forward is that of legislation to
protect the right to vote. This
was shown in the Civil Rights
Act of 1957, the first civil rights
legislation of any kind to pass
Congress since the end of the Re
construction period. This act au
thorized Federal intervention in
the states to protect the right to
vote. It was passed without a
filibuster when, but only when,
the Administration agreed to de
lete what was known as Part 111,
which would have authorized Fed
eral intervention against segre
gation in the public schools.
This d is t» n c t i o ir between
votes and schools is in practice
today the distinction between
what Congress may be able to

deal with effectively and what
it cannot now hope to legislate
about or to enforce it it could
legislate.
This distinction is at the core
of the Johnson compromise on
the rules about cloture to stop a
filibuster. In this compromise ihe
Southerners in effect agreed not
to filibuster against legislation to
protect political lights if they re
tained the power to filibuster
against legislation about social
rights. Rule XXII as amended
says that legislation may be kil
led hy filibuster if the whole
South is united against the legis
lation.
Eisenhower's ('omment
The existence of this distinc
tion has now been confirmed as
the working rule both hy Presi
dent Eisenhower and Sen. Lyndon
Johnson. The President did this
at the National Press Club con
ference on Wednesday. January
14th. lie was asked this question:
"In 1957 Congress passed at your
suggestion a civil rights bill deal
ing largely with voting. Do you
think the Congress should pass
civil rights legislation dealing
specifically with problems aris
ing from school segregation?"
The President replied, "I think
when we get into Ihe field of law
here we must be very careful.
I do believe in the law concerning
voting ..."
A few days later, Sen. Johnson
introduced his program to pro
tect civil rights, it is a bill to ex
tend the life of the Civil Rights
Commission, to do something a
bout the bombings in the South-

ern states, to sot up a mediation
and conciliation service in racial
conflicts and to give the Attorney
General subpoena powers under
the voting rights law. On the cen
tral distinction between voting
rights and school desegregation,
the President and Sen. Johnson
are agreed in principle.
This, then, is for the time heing,
Ilie way forward to use the Fed
eral power to enable qualified Ne
groes to vole. II ibis can be ac
complished, ii will make a great
difference. For insofar as the Ne
gro people arc able to vote in the
deep South, there will be as Sen.
Johnson said, "plenty they can do
to help themselves."

Ii would ho a good tiling if Con

Right to Vote
Beginning in the late summer
of 1957, it has become clear that,
in respect to Congress, the road
forward is that of legislation to
protect the right to vote. This
was shown in the Civil Rights
Act of 1957, the first civil rights
legislation of any kind to pass
Congress since the end of the Re
construction period. This act au
thorized Federal intervention in
the states to protect the right to
vote. It was passed without a
filibuster when, but only when,
the Administration agreed to de
lete what was known as Part 111,
which would have authorized Fed
eral intervention against segre
gation in the public schools.
This d is t» n c t i o ir between
votes and schools is in practice
today the distinction between
what Congress may be able to

deal with effectively and what
it cannot now hope to legislate
about or to enforce it it could
legislate.
This distinction is at the core
of the Johnson compromise on
the rules about cloture to stop a
filibuster. In this compromise ihe
Southerners in effect agreed not
to filibuster against legislation to
protect political lights if they re
tained the power to filibuster
against legislation about social
rights. Rule XXII as amended
says that legislation may be kil
led hy filibuster if the whole
South is united against the legis
lation.
Eisenhower's ('omment
The existence of this distinc
tion has now been confirmed as
the working rule both hy Presi
dent Eisenhower and Sen. Lyndon
Johnson. The President did this
at the National Press Club con
ference on Wednesday. January
14th. lie was asked this question:
"In 1957 Congress passed at your
suggestion a civil rights bill deal
ing largely with voting. Do you
think the Congress should pass
civil rights legislation dealing
specifically with problems aris
ing from school segregation?"
The President replied, "I think
when we get into Ihe field of law
here we must be very careful.
I do believe in the law concerning
voting ..."
A few days later, Sen. Johnson
introduced his program to pro
tect civil rights, it is a bill to ex
tend the life of the Civil Rights
Commission, to do something a
bout the bombings in the South-

ern states, to sot up a mediation
and conciliation service in racial
conflicts and to give the Attorney
General subpoena powers under
the voting rights law. On the cen
tral distinction between voting
rights and school desegregation,
the President and Sen. Johnson
are agreed in principle.
This, then, is for the time heing,
Ilie way forward to use the Fed
eral power to enable qualified Ne
groes to vole. II ibis can be ac
complished, ii will make a great
difference. For insofar as the Ne
gro people arc able to vote in the
deep South, there will be as Sen.
Johnson said, "plenty they can do
to help themselves."
(£) New York Herald Tribune
Ii would ho a good tiling if Con
gress could deal with civil rights
legislation early in the session.
For |ater on, especially in the
spring and during the summer,
there arc likely to he many dis
tractions. There will he the usual
traffic jam of hills, and in all pro
liability there will he spectacular
events in foreign affairs.
It will he useful to take stock
of the present position, as seen
from the point of view of those
who wish to realize, not to resist
and to nullify, the enjoyment hy
Negroes of the constitutional
rights which are now denied to
them. More precisely, we may
ask ourselves what is the situa
tion in the field of affirmative
action hy Congress?
Better I'rospocts
The answer, broadly speaking,
is that legislation to protect the
light to vote has a far better
prospect than legislation directed
against segregation in the public
schools. It has a better prospect
of being passed by Congress with
out a serious filibuster, and it has
a better prospect of being ac
cepted and observed in all but the
deepest and darkest South.
There is, of course, a close con
nection between the degree ol' re
sistance to a bill in the Senate
and the degree of resistance to a
law in Ihe states affected.
For all practical purposes one
may say that civil rights legis
lation which is opposed by vir
tually all the Southern states will
in practice he nullified in the
Southern states.
