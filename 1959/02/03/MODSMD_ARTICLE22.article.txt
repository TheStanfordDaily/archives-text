THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME
Tt, happens every day. A young man {tops off to college leaving
}lis home-town sweetheart with vows of eternal love, and then
lie finds that he has outgrown her. What, in such cases, is the
honorable thing to do?
Well sir, you can do what TCoclc Sigafoos did.
When Rock left Cut and Shoot, I'a., he said to his sweetheart,
a simple country lass named Tess dTrbervilles, "My dear,
though I am far away in college, I will love you always. 1 will
never look at another girl. If 1 do, may my eyeballs parch and
wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may the moths get
my new tweed jacket!"
Then he clutched Tess to his bosom and planted a final kiss
upon her fragrant young skull and went away, meaning with
all his heart to be faithful.

But on the very first day of college lie met :i coed named Fata
Morgana, a girl of such sophistication, such poise, such mvoir
fuin us Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly ot I ran/.
Kafka, she hummed Mozart, she smoked Marlboros, the ciga
rette with better "makiii'x". Now, Rock didn't know Franz
Kafka from Pinocchio, or Mozart from James K. Polk, but
Marlboros he knew full well, lie knew that anyone who smoked
Marlboros was modern and advanced and as studded with
brains as a ham with cloves. CJood sense tells yon that you can I
beat Marlboro's new improved filter, and you never could beat
Marlboro's fine flavor. This Rock knew.
So all day he followed Fata around campus and listened to
her talk about Franz Kafka, and then in the evening he vent
buck to the dormitory and found this letter from his home-town
sweetheart 'less:
Dear Rack,
I'« ki<ts had a keen tune yesterday. We went down to the

Well sir. Rock thought about Tess and then he thought about
Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly he knew
he had outgrown young, innocent 'l ess; hi- hearl now belonged
to smart, sophisticated Fata.
Rock, being above all things honorable, returned forthwith
to his home town and walked up to 'less and looked her in the
eye and said manfully, "I do not love you any more. 1 love
a girl named Fatu Morgana. You can hit me in the stomach with
sill your might if you like."
"That's okay, hey," said Tess amiably. !'I don't love you
neither. I found a new boy."
"What is his name?" asked Rock.
"Franz Kafka," said Tess.
"A splendid fellow," stid Rock and shook Toss's hand and
Ihey have remained good friends to this day. In fact, Rock and
Fata often double-date with Franz and Tess and have heaps
of fun. Franz can do the Hula lloop (1,000 times.

lie finds that he has outgrown her. What, in such cases, is the
honorable thing to do?
Well sir, you can do what TCoclc Sigafoos did.
When Rock left Cut and Shoot, I'a., he said to his sweetheart,
a simple country lass named Tess dTrbervilles, "My dear,
though I am far away in college, I will love you always. 1 will
never look at another girl. If 1 do, may my eyeballs parch and
wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may the moths get
my new tweed jacket!"
Then he clutched Tess to his bosom and planted a final kiss
upon her fragrant young skull and went away, meaning with
all his heart to be faithful.

But on the very first day of college lie met :i coed named Fata
Morgana, a girl of such sophistication, such poise, such mvoir
fuin us Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly ot I ran/.
Kafka, she hummed Mozart, she smoked Marlboros, the ciga
rette with better "makiii'x". Now, Rock didn't know Franz
Kafka from Pinocchio, or Mozart from James K. Polk, but
Marlboros he knew full well, lie knew that anyone who smoked
Marlboros was modern and advanced and as studded with
brains as a ham with cloves. CJood sense tells yon that you can I
beat Marlboro's new improved filter, and you never could beat
Marlboro's fine flavor. This Rock knew.
So all day he followed Fata around campus and listened to
her talk about Franz Kafka, and then in the evening he vent
buck to the dormitory and found this letter from his home-town
sweetheart 'less:
Dear Rack,

Well sir. Rock thought about Tess and then he thought about
Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly he knew
he had outgrown young, innocent 'l ess; hi- hearl now belonged
to smart, sophisticated Fata.
Rock, being above all things honorable, returned forthwith
to his home town and walked up to 'less and looked her in the
eye and said manfully, "I do not love you any more. 1 love
a girl named Fatu Morgana. You can hit me in the stomach with
sill your might if you like."
"That's okay, hey," said Tess amiably. !'I don't love you
neither. I found a new boy."
"What is his name?" asked Rock.
"Franz Kafka," said Tess.
"A splendid fellow," stid Rock and shook Toss's hand and
Ihey have remained good friends to this day. In fact, Rock and
Fata often double-date with Franz and Tess and have heaps
of fun. Franz can do the Hula lloop (1,000 times.
