Learn lo Play Decent Itall
A few weeks hack when the Minneapolis Lakers and the Boston
C'cities were in San l'Yancisco for one of their NBA league games
Coach I'llil Wool pert of USF mentioned that as far as he was con
cerned San Francisco shouldn't press for a team in the NBA until
the pros learn to play decent basketball. Woolpert's comment was
mainly aimed at the shoddy defense that most of the NBA teams
employ. Many other people in the Bay Area echoed Woolpert's senti
ments but we certainly can't agree with the USF mentor.
II is true that Woolpert's USF teams have made line progress due
to the very tight deliberate defensive style of basketball which has
become traditional with the Don coach, but there arc many factors
that Wool pert neglects to realize.
First of all one must consider that basketball is not just a game
for players and coaches, the so-called technicians of the game, but
it also is at least 50 per cent a game for the spectator. Most specta
tors prefer a high-scoring, wide-open brand of basketball- the same
type which the NBA plays. It is these fans that turn out nightly to
see and to support their NBA teams. Without I hose spectators there
would be no professional basketball.
A second consideration which should Ijo explored is the true value
of defensive play. Most teams that specialize in defense these days
do it because they are forced to; they lack some necessary offensive
weapon. In the case of Stanford it is a lack of height. Stanford has
no big men to clear the hoards consistently so the Indians have to
allow their opponents as few shots as possible while taking only the
very best ones themselves. California lacks the real consistent scor
ing punch so il must prevent its opponents from piling lip too many
points for fear of not being able to keep pace.
The (ireal Initializer
There is nothing wrong with using this defensive play as a
weapon moderately in the college and high school ranks because here
the caliber of the teams is not nearly as high as the pros. It lends
individuality to the college game and serves as a great equalizer
allowing a smaller or weaker team to stand up against a team more
blessed with talent.
All the pros, however, have height and all are great shooters and
all are very close in ability. Tight defense in pro ball would only tend
to slow the game down and cause a great new wave of foul calling.
As things are now, most fans complain of too many whistle-happy
officials.
The game would lose its personality if such fine shots as Bob
C'ousy, Fluin Baylor, Bob I'ettit, George Yardley or Ken Sears were
pressed to the point where they couldn't display any of their patent
shots.
Defense is a type of play which is easily taught. Anyone with
quick enough hands and reflexes to be a top offensive man can be
taught to do an adequate job on defense; but to teach someone to
score 20 points a game is another story. Certainly, if they desired,
all the members of the NBA could be taught to play the best brand
of defensive basketball in the country but there is no profitable
market for this.
While in a discussion of defensive basketball we can't help hid
think that San Francisco high schools and the whole Bay Area are
missing the boat by over stressing this type of play in their games.
All try to be another USF of Bill lttissell days, and as a result scores
rarely get. any higher than 40 points.
This failure to develop much in the way of offense is coming
back to haunt the Coast more and more. Look at the positions in the
national rankings where Coast teams are resting. Cal and Seattle
arc the only ones to get mention in the top twenty neither in the top
ten while the Biy Figlit Atlantic Coast, Missouri Valley, Southern
and Eastern Conferences dominate.
Where Are the Shooters?
No team on the Coast seems to get any more than one or two
top all-around players, and these players are forced to carry more
than their- share of the team's load. Good examples of this are Doug
Smart of Washington, Walt Torrence of UCLA and Stanford's Paul
Neumann.
Many of the players who led Coast teams to any national recog
nition have been imports to the area. Flgin Baylor was brought to
Seattle from Washington, D.C. Previous to his stay at Seattle, ihc
O'Brien brothers from New Jersey led the Chiefs. AI Bucli, captain
of PCC favorite Cal, is a Brooklyn boy.
There aren't enough players in West Coast ball that consistently
put the ball through the hoop, and no matter how well you play de
fense you can't win without scoring.
As a last note I'd like to add that St. John's of Brooklyn may have
the best of the collegiate hoop squads in the nation. Watch for the
Iledmen come tournament time. Oh. yes, they're averaging near 80
points per game and players, AI Seiden and Tony Jackson, average
near 20 a game.

Many of the players who led Coast teams to any national recog
nition have been imports to the area. Flgin Baylor was brought to
Seattle from Washington, D.C. Previous to his stay at Seattle, ihc
O'Brien brothers from New Jersey led the Chiefs. AI Bucli, captain
of PCC favorite Cal, is a Brooklyn boy.
There aren't enough players in West Coast ball that consistently
put the ball through the hoop, and no matter how well you play de
fense you can't win without scoring.
As a last note I'd like to add that St. John's of Brooklyn may have
the best of the collegiate hoop squads in the nation. Watch for the
Iledmen come tournament time. Oh. yes, they're averaging near 80
points per game and players, AI Seiden and Tony Jackson, average
near 20 a game.
Learn lo Play Decent Itall
A few weeks hack when the Minneapolis Lakers and the Boston
C'cities were in San l'Yancisco for one of their NBA league games
Coach I'llil Wool pert of USF mentioned that as far as he was con
cerned San Francisco shouldn't press for a team in the NBA until
the pros learn to play decent basketball. Woolpert's comment was
mainly aimed at the shoddy defense that most of the NBA teams
employ. Many other people in the Bay Area echoed Woolpert's senti
ments but we certainly can't agree with the USF mentor.
II is true that Woolpert's USF teams have made line progress due
to the very tight deliberate defensive style of basketball which has
become traditional with the Don coach, but there arc many factors
that Wool pert neglects to realize.
First of all one must consider that basketball is not just a game
for players and coaches, the so-called technicians of the game, but
it also is at least 50 per cent a game for the spectator. Most specta
tors prefer a high-scoring, wide-open brand of basketball- the same
type which the NBA plays. It is these fans that turn out nightly to
see and to support their NBA teams. Without I hose spectators there
would be no professional basketball.
A second consideration which should Ijo explored is the true value
of defensive play. Most teams that specialize in defense these days
do it because they are forced to; they lack some necessary offensive
weapon. In the case of Stanford it is a lack of height. Stanford has
no big men to clear the hoards consistently so the Indians have to
allow their opponents as few shots as possible while taking only the
very best ones themselves. California lacks the real consistent scor
ing punch so il must prevent its opponents from piling lip too many
points for fear of not being able to keep pace.
The (ireal Initializer
There is nothing wrong with using this defensive play as a
weapon moderately in the college and high school ranks because here
the caliber of the teams is not nearly as high as the pros. It lends
individuality to the college game and serves as a great equalizer
allowing a smaller or weaker team to stand up against a team more
blessed with talent.
All the pros, however, have height and all are great shooters and
all are very close in ability. Tight defense in pro ball would only tend
to slow the game down and cause a great new wave of foul calling.
As things are now, most fans complain of too many whistle-happy
officials.
The game would lose its personality if such fine shots as Bob
C'ousy, Fluin Baylor, Bob I'ettit, George Yardley or Ken Sears were
pressed to the point where they couldn't display any of their patent
shots.
Defense is a type of play which is easily taught. Anyone with
quick enough hands and reflexes to be a top offensive man can be
taught to do an adequate job on defense; but to teach someone to
score 20 points a game is another story. Certainly, if they desired,
all the members of the NBA could be taught to play the best brand
of defensive basketball in the country but there is no profitable
market for this.
While in a discussion of defensive basketball we can't help hid
think that San Francisco high schools and the whole Bay Area are
missing the boat by over stressing this type of play in their games.
All try to be another USF of Bill lttissell days, and as a result scores
rarely get. any higher than 40 points.
This failure to develop much in the way of offense is coming
back to haunt the Coast more and more. Look at the positions in the
national rankings where Coast teams are resting. Cal and Seattle
arc the only ones to get mention in the top twenty neither in the top
ten while the Biy Figlit Atlantic Coast, Missouri Valley, Southern
and Eastern Conferences dominate.
Where Are the Shooters?
No team on the Coast seems to get any more than one or two
top all-around players, and these players are forced to carry more
than their- share of the team's load. Good examples of this are Doug
Smart of Washington, Walt Torrence of UCLA and Stanford's Paul
Neumann.

missing the boat by over stressing this type of play in their games.
All try to be another USF of Bill lttissell days, and as a result scores
rarely get. any higher than 40 points.
This failure to develop much in the way of offense is coming
back to haunt the Coast more and more. Look at the positions in the
national rankings where Coast teams are resting. Cal and Seattle
arc the only ones to get mention in the top twenty neither in the top
ten while the Biy Figlit Atlantic Coast, Missouri Valley, Southern
and Eastern Conferences dominate.
Where Are the Shooters?
No team on the Coast seems to get any more than one or two
top all-around players, and these players are forced to carry more
than their- share of the team's load. Good examples of this are Doug
Smart of Washington, Walt Torrence of UCLA and Stanford's Paul
Neumann.
Many of the players who led Coast teams to any national recog
nition have been imports to the area. Flgin Baylor was brought to
Seattle from Washington, D.C. Previous to his stay at Seattle, ihc
O'Brien brothers from New Jersey led the Chiefs. AI Bucli, captain
of PCC favorite Cal, is a Brooklyn boy.
There aren't enough players in West Coast ball that consistently
put the ball through the hoop, and no matter how well you play de
fense you can't win without scoring.
As a last note I'd like to add that St. John's of Brooklyn may have
the best of the collegiate hoop squads in the nation. Watch for the
Iledmen come tournament time. Oh. yes, they're averaging near 80
points per game and players, AI Seiden and Tony Jackson, average
near 20 a game.
Learn lo Play Decent Itall
A few weeks hack when the Minneapolis Lakers and the Boston
C'cities were in San l'Yancisco for one of their NBA league games
Coach I'llil Wool pert of USF mentioned that as far as he was con
cerned San Francisco shouldn't press for a team in the NBA until
the pros learn to play decent basketball. Woolpert's comment was
mainly aimed at the shoddy defense that most of the NBA teams
employ. Many other people in the Bay Area echoed Woolpert's senti
ments but we certainly can't agree with the USF mentor.
II is true that Woolpert's USF teams have made line progress due
to the very tight deliberate defensive style of basketball which has
become traditional with the Don coach, but there arc many factors
that Wool pert neglects to realize.
First of all one must consider that basketball is not just a game
for players and coaches, the so-called technicians of the game, but
it also is at least 50 per cent a game for the spectator. Most specta
tors prefer a high-scoring, wide-open brand of basketball- the same
type which the NBA plays. It is these fans that turn out nightly to
see and to support their NBA teams. Without I hose spectators there
would be no professional basketball.
A second consideration which should Ijo explored is the true value
of defensive play. Most teams that specialize in defense these days
do it because they are forced to; they lack some necessary offensive
weapon. In the case of Stanford it is a lack of height. Stanford has
no big men to clear the hoards consistently so the Indians have to
allow their opponents as few shots as possible while taking only the
very best ones themselves. California lacks the real consistent scor
ing punch so il must prevent its opponents from piling lip too many
points for fear of not being able to keep pace.
The (ireal Initializer
There is nothing wrong with using this defensive play as a
weapon moderately in the college and high school ranks because here
the caliber of the teams is not nearly as high as the pros. It lends
individuality to the college game and serves as a great equalizer
allowing a smaller or weaker team to stand up against a team more
blessed with talent.
All the pros, however, have height and all are great shooters and
all are very close in ability. Tight defense in pro ball would only tend
to slow the game down and cause a great new wave of foul calling.
As things are now, most fans complain of too many whistle-happy
officials.
The game would lose its personality if such fine shots as Bob
C'ousy, Fluin Baylor, Bob I'ettit, George Yardley or Ken Sears were
pressed to the point where they couldn't display any of their patent
shots.
Defense is a type of play which is easily taught. Anyone with
quick enough hands and reflexes to be a top offensive man can be
taught to do an adequate job on defense; but to teach someone to
score 20 points a game is another story. Certainly, if they desired,
all the members of the NBA could be taught to play the best brand
of defensive basketball in the country but there is no profitable
market for this.
