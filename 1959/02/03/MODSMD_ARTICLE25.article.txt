# Nelson, Ogden Look Best In Strong Card Net Picture

### 
"If it's depth you want, we got i
it!" Those were the words <>l
Stanford tennis coach Bob Ben
kcr as he mentioned the 1 i)Td) erli
tion of the Card net team.
The Stanford squad has six re
turning lettermen and two top
sophomores, all of whom arc |
good enough to be in the starting !
six when the Indians open their'
season later this month in the
Northern California Intercolle
giate Tournament.

Veteran Dave Nelson, the pow- I
erful senior from Chicago, ap
pears to have the inside track at I
the number one position on the!
team. Nelson, second man last
year behind Jack Douglas, will
have the unenviable task of fill
ing the shoes of last year's top
man, but all indications seem to
show that Nelson is more than ,
capable.
Behind Nelson in singles and i
pairing with him in doubles will
probably be sophomore Dick Og

the team even though he is only
a sophomore.
"laid" and "Goon"
Alter Nelson and Ogden come
Lowell C'arruth and Jim Jeffries;
both are lettermen and both are
very close in ability. Which will
play three and which will play
four is still undecided. "Goon"
and "Lud," as Carruth and Jef
fries are known to their team
mates, make up one of the most
enlertaining as well as effective
doubles teams in college tennis.
Sophomore Norm Karns and
senior Dick Gould are the favor
ites for the last two spots on the
team, but to gain them they will
have to stave off competition
from juniors Dick Mosk and Gil
Ranney.

Stanford tennis coach Bob Ben

tion of the Card net team.
The Stanford squad has six re
turning lettermen and two top
sophomores, all of whom arc |
good enough to be in the starting !

Northern California Intercolle

Nelson oil Top
Veteran Dave Nelson, the pow- I

the number one position on the!
team. Nelson, second man last
year behind Jack Douglas, will
have the unenviable task of fill
ing the shoes of last year's top
man, but all indications seem to
show that Nelson is more than ,
capable.
Behind Nelson in singles and i
pairing with him in doubles will
probably be sophomore Dick Og

Alter Nelson and Ogden come
Lowell C'arruth and Jim Jeffries;
both are lettermen and both are
very close in ability. Which will
play three and which will play
four is still undecided. "Goon"
and "Lud," as Carruth and Jef

mates, make up one of the most
enlertaining as well as effective
doubles teams in college tennis.
