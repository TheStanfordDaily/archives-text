# Quiet Integration Begins At Seven Virginia Sites
## Negro Pupils Not Molested 
### 
RICHMOND, Va. (/IV Virginia
glumly gave way to racial inte
gration Monday and hesitantly
took 21 Negro children into seven
white schools.
The Negro pupils came and
went unmolested at schools in
Norfolk and Arlington County.
In each community, a lew white
children refuser! to attend school
with them, picked up their books
and left.
Special police details turned out
to maintain older, hut there were
no commotions, serious incidents
or even any cat calls.
Police Stand By
Both in Norfolk and Arlington,
police were under instructions to
stand by indefinitely, as long as
school officials want them on
hand.
And Arlington put a ban on any
events at night in the school
even meetings of civic and par
ent tea*'her organizations.
The principals of the six Nor
folk schools said just before dis
missal time that there had been
an absence of incidents and all
was going smoothly within.
Between the white pupils and
handful of Negroes who joiner!
them there apparently was a min
imum of ill-will.
Seven Enrolled
The largest number of Negroes
enrolled at any one Norfolk
school were the seven assigned to
Norview High.
In the classes at Stratford,
school officii!ls said the four Ne
gro newcomers reacted normally
and jumped up with their share
of questions. Some of the white
children said the Negroes got
courteous treatment and their
white classmates were cheerful
about everything.
One of the Negroes, Ronald
Deskins, 12, said that "they made
us feel just like at home." lie and
the three other Negro youngsters
said the day had been pleasant.
Amazing Smoothness
School authorities, both in Ar
lington and Norfolk, were exult
ing at the smoothness of the
change-over to a measure of inte
gration.
Norfolk's six secondary schools
had been closed since last Septem
ber. They never opened after fed
eral courts ordered 17 Negroes
admitted and Virginia brought
into play a now dear! law to close
them automatically.
In the interval, most pupils
went into other public or private
schools or tutored classes.
Segregationists in the Legisla
ture still hunted hopefully, but
with slim chances of success, for
some new device to bring integra
tion to a halt. One rallying point,
a new school closure bill, was de
feated in the Senate.

was going smoothly within.
Between the white pupils and
handful of Negroes who joiner!
them there apparently was a min
imum of ill-will.
Seven Enrolled
The largest number of Negroes
enrolled at any one Norfolk
school were the seven assigned to
Norview High.
In the classes at Stratford,
school officii!ls said the four Ne
gro newcomers reacted normally
and jumped up with their share
of questions. Some of the white
children said the Negroes got
courteous treatment and their
white classmates were cheerful
about everything.
One of the Negroes, Ronald
Deskins, 12, said that "they made
us feel just like at home." lie and
the three other Negro youngsters
said the day had been pleasant.
Amazing Smoothness
School authorities, both in Ar
lington and Norfolk, were exult
ing at the smoothness of the
change-over to a measure of inte
gration.
Norfolk's six secondary schools
had been closed since last Septem
ber. They never opened after fed
eral courts ordered 17 Negroes
admitted and Virginia brought
into play a now dear! law to close
them automatically.
In the interval, most pupils
went into other public or private
schools or tutored classes.
Segregationists in the Legisla
ture still hunted hopefully, but
with slim chances of success, for
some new device to bring integra
tion to a halt. One rallying point,
a new school closure bill, was de
feated in the Senate.
