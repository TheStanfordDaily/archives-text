# NINE LICENSES TO STAY
## Liquor Limits Bill is Drafted 
### Dick Barnes, Associate Editor 
A bill which would allow nine Palo Alio liquor establishments to
stay in business despite Stanford boundary changes has almost made
its way to the floor of the California State Assembly.
Assemblyman Clark Bradley of San Jose told The Daily yesterday
that the legislative counsel's office is in the process of drafting a

measure to solve a problem of liq
uor sales which came to light in
early January. He expects to in
troduce the completed bill within
a week.
The difficulty centers around a
state law prohibiting sale of liq
uor within 1 1 ii miles of university
boundaries. Occupancy of new
housing units in September make
necessary a change in campus
boundaries, and will force the 1 \'>-
mile limit past the nine establish
ments.
Bradley's bill will allow the bus
inesses to remain, but will pro
hibit issuing of any new liquor li
censes within the new
limit. The nine licenses in the
questioned area will be transfer
able, but will be prohibited from
ever moving closer to campus
than the locations at which they
are presently in use.
Effect of Hospital
Bradley said the only question
delaying the bill concerns status
of a veterans' hospital being con
structed on a southern extremity
of campus land. The problem is
whether or not the hospital must
be considered within boundaries
of the working campus, and hence
whether or not the l'u-mile limit
will move even further down El
Camino.
More Protests
Bradley noted that the past few
weeks have brought more pro
tests to the bill, in addition to the
one voiced by the mid-Peninsula's
Council of United Church Wom
en.
He said he has answered all
protests mostly from individuals
with the explanation that the
new bill does not do away with
the I'j -mile limit, but merely
seeks to protect businesses locat
ed in good faith and compliance
with existing state law and Uni
versity boundaries.
Bradley predicted that his bill
would probably be only one of
many similar ones which will
probably come before the Legisla
ture in the next few years. Not
ing the rapid growth in dormitory
facilities at existing state schools,
plus the increase in numbers of
colleges and universities, he an
ticipates seeing many areas which
will have liquor establishments
forced out of business unless leg
islative exemption to the l'/y-mile
law is granted.

whether or not the hospital must
be considered within boundaries
of the working campus, and hence
whether or not the l'u-mile limit
will move even further down El
Camino.
More Protests
Bradley noted that the past few
weeks have brought more pro
tests to the bill, in addition to the
one voiced by the mid-Peninsula's
Council of United Church Wom
en.
He said he has answered all
protests mostly from individuals
with the explanation that the
new bill does not do away with
the I'j -mile limit, but merely
seeks to protect businesses locat
ed in good faith and compliance
with existing state law and Uni
versity boundaries.
Bradley predicted that his bill
would probably be only one of
many similar ones which will
probably come before the Legisla
ture in the next few years. Not
ing the rapid growth in dormitory
facilities at existing state schools,
plus the increase in numbers of
colleges and universities, he an
ticipates seeing many areas which
will have liquor establishments
forced out of business unless leg
islative exemption to the l'/y-mile
law is granted.
A bill which would allow nine Palo Alio liquor establishments to
stay in business despite Stanford boundary changes has almost made
its way to the floor of the California State Assembly.
Assemblyman Clark Bradley of San Jose told The Daily yesterday
that the legislative counsel's office is in the process of drafting a

measure to solve a problem of liq
uor sales which came to light in
early January. He expects to in
troduce the completed bill within
a week.
The difficulty centers around a
state law prohibiting sale of liq
uor within 1 1 ii miles of university
boundaries. Occupancy of new
housing units in September make
necessary a change in campus
boundaries, and will force the 1 \'>-
mile limit past the nine establish
ments.
Bradley's bill will allow the bus
inesses to remain, but will pro
hibit issuing of any new liquor li
censes within the new
limit. The nine licenses in the
questioned area will be transfer
able, but will be prohibited from
ever moving closer to campus
than the locations at which they
are presently in use.
Effect of Hospital
Bradley said the only question
delaying the bill concerns status
of a veterans' hospital being con
structed on a southern extremity
of campus land. The problem is
whether or not the hospital must
be considered within boundaries
of the working campus, and hence
whether or not the l'u-mile limit
will move even further down El
Camino.
