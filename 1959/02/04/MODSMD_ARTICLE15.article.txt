## Daily Policy Changes 
### Leo Krulitz Editor 
With the change in volume of
The Daily, we would like made
known to you some of the changes
in Daily policy, and suggest some
of the reasons for these altera
tions.
First, "Letters to the Editor"
will no longer be printed without
the writer's name. We feel that
Stanford students are certainly
mature and responsible enough to
stand by their own positions.
We cannot conceive of a situa
tion that would alter this policy
Perhaps it is too presumptuous
of us to think we will be able,
through editorials, columns and
news play, to stimulate serious
thought on the problems and ideas
we call to your attention. But if
we are at all successful, it would
seem only fair to make available
a vehicle which you might use to
express your thoughts more fully.
Conversation is certainly an ex
cellent means for expression; but
writing, we feel, gives a person
the added advantage of shaping
and molding an argument into a
perfected, tangible form.
In addition to the regular "Let
ters to the Editor" column, we are
reviving a column that has run in
the past called "From This Point
of View." Ordinarily it has been
available only to Daily staff mem
bers; but, in line with the com
ments above, during this volume
the column will be available to
the students generally, with the
reservation that arrangements
must be made with the editor be
fore an article is submitted.

This offer is made with the idea
that the 250-word limit on "Let
ters" will be observed and the
"From This Point of View" col
umn will be available for longer
commentary.
As a point of information, the
editor reserves the prerogative of
printing or not printing "Letters"
and articles submitted and the
right to edit, when necessary, the
material published. The reasons
for this should be quite evident,
in that The Daily is liable for all
material printed, and our space is
unpredictable and limited.
As was suggested in our edi
torial yesterday, written by Rita
Robison, we hope you will take
advantage of The Daily as a me
dium for expression of your ideas.
We also welcome your construc
tive criticism and suggestions.
We will continue to rely, this
volume, on the Walter Lippmann
political column and the I-lerblock
cartoon for provocative comment
on national affairs. In addition,
we will discuss national issues ed
itorially on occasion. While these
views may lack a seasoned edi
torial writer's competent back
ground, they will be, at least, the
product of serio us student
thought.
We are aware of our responsi
bility as a newspaper to present
news that is of interest to our
readers. News selection and news
play are aimed at satisfying the
largest number of readers possi
ble. This means news of interest
to a small group must necessarily
be handled within the limitations
that four pages imply.

be handled within the limitations
that four pages imply.
With the change in volume of
The Daily, we would like made
known to you some of the changes
in Daily policy, and suggest some
of the reasons for these altera
tions.
First, "Letters to the Editor"
will no longer be printed without
the writer's name. We feel that
Stanford students are certainly
mature and responsible enough to
stand by their own positions.
We cannot conceive of a situa
tion that would alter this policy
Perhaps it is too presumptuous
of us to think we will be able,
through editorials, columns and
news play, to stimulate serious
thought on the problems and ideas
we call to your attention. But if
we are at all successful, it would
seem only fair to make available
a vehicle which you might use to
express your thoughts more fully.
Conversation is certainly an ex
cellent means for expression; but
writing, we feel, gives a person
the added advantage of shaping
and molding an argument into a
perfected, tangible form.
In addition to the regular "Let
ters to the Editor" column, we are
reviving a column that has run in
the past called "From This Point
of View." Ordinarily it has been
available only to Daily staff mem
bers; but, in line with the com
ments above, during this volume
the column will be available to
the students generally, with the
reservation that arrangements
must be made with the editor be
fore an article is submitted.

This offer is made with the idea
that the 250-word limit on "Let
ters" will be observed and the
"From This Point of View" col
umn will be available for longer
commentary.
As a point of information, the
editor reserves the prerogative of
printing or not printing "Letters"
and articles submitted and the
right to edit, when necessary, the
material published. The reasons
for this should be quite evident,
in that The Daily is liable for all
material printed, and our space is
unpredictable and limited.
As was suggested in our edi
torial yesterday, written by Rita
Robison, we hope you will take
advantage of The Daily as a me
dium for expression of your ideas.
We also welcome your construc
tive criticism and suggestions.
We will continue to rely, this
volume, on the Walter Lippmann
political column and the I-lerblock
cartoon for provocative comment
on national affairs. In addition,
we will discuss national issues ed
itorially on occasion. While these
views may lack a seasoned edi
torial writer's competent back
ground, they will be, at least, the
product of serio us student
thought.
We are aware of our responsi
bility as a newspaper to present
news that is of interest to our
readers. News selection and news
play are aimed at satisfying the
largest number of readers possi
ble. This means news of interest
to a small group must necessarily
be handled within the limitations
that four pages imply.
