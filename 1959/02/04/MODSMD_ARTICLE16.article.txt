# Tonight at the Symphony
## 
### Diana Smith 
Another week, another musical
"first."
Tonight it's the initial appear
ance of pianist Jean Casadesus in
the first San Francisco perform
ance of the contemporary French
jomposer Francis Poulenc's "Con
cert Champetre" (1927).
Casadesus is generally referred
to as "the son of pianists Robert
and Gaby Casadesus." Robert,
who appeared with the San Fran
cisco Symphony last season, plays
Beethoven competently: Gaby is
known particularly for her Mo
zart.
There are others in this musical
family: four eminent uncles, a
great - uncle who founded the
American Conservatory of Music
in Fontainebleau, France—where
Jean now teaches, and a great
aunt, Rose Casadesus, with whom
he first studied.
Thereafter, the youngest Casa
desus progressed to lessons with
his father at the Paris Conserva
tory. He began a professional ca
reer with Eugene Ormandy in
1917 as winner of the Philadel
phia Orchestra Youth Contest,
and won the First Medal at the
Geneva International Competition

that autumn.
After intermission the orches
tra will continue with Berlioz'
Overture to "Beatrice and Bene
dict."
Then Tchaikowsky's Symphony
No. 4 in F minor, Op. 30 (1878),
about which the composer wrote:
"The introduction is the kernel,
the chief thought of the whole
symphony. This is Destiny, the
fatal power which prevents an
impetus toward happiness from
reaching its goal, which jealously
watches that peace and comfort
be not full and cloudless . . ."
The first movement he called
an escape into dreaming—which
doesnt' last. The second: ". . .
another phase of sadness. Here is
that melancholy feeling which en
wraps one when he sits at night
alone in the house . . ." Of the
third he said it is the caprice of
intoxication; "the mood is not joy
ful, but it is not sad."
Stormy strings and woodwinds
open the finale, then Russian folk
melody: "If you find no pleasure
in yourself, look about you. Go
to the people. . . . There is still
happiness, simple native happi
ness."
