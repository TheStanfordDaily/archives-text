Breakfast Disrupted
Editor, The Daily:
On occasion, your articles make
our breakfasts even less tasty.
Your most current effort to make
the cereal and milk fight each oth
er is the series on freshman spon
sors.
These articles are most thought
provoking, actually just plain
provoking. We are freshmen and
we like our sponsor. He is a good
guy who sincerely tries to help us
whenever possible. It is very
hard to find any freshman who
dislikes his sponsor.
This indicates that we can once
again congratulate you on taking
the wrong side in a controversy.
In this case you have outdone
yourself; you have created a con
troversy which doesn't even ex
ist!
Rather than revamp the spon
sor system, may we suggest that
you revamp your list of column
ists, switching Leo Krulitz to the
campus humor department. If
your attitude doesn't change, we

will be forced to read the Chapar
ral. We don't want to do this lie
cause their articles are nowhere
near as humorous as yours.
Better luck next controversy.

Anomymous Letters
Editor, The Daily:
I am frankly appalled that you
allow the publication of anony
mous letters.
The anonymous letter pub
lished last Friday relative to a
Sunday afternoon recital was pa
tently irresponsible and vicious.
Your publication of it is equally
irresponsible.
In behalf of those who were of
fended and, perhaps, personally
hurt by the letter', I strongly sug
gest an avoidance of similar mis
takes of judgment and taste in
the future.
