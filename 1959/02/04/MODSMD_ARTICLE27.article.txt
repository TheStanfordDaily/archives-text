NEW YORK (/P) â€” Colonel
Francis Roberts, Army's gradu
ate manager of athletics, Tuesday
chilled the idea of Army's belong
ing to a proposed national foot
ball conference.
Speaking at a luncheon, Rob
erts said ihe Army Academic
Board was "not favorably dis
posed toward belonging" to such
a conference.
League Discussed
The formation of a new nation
wide conference had been under
discussion for several years. The
proposal was reviewed in some
detail at a semi-secret meeting
dining the NCAA convention in
Cincinnati last month.
Possible members would be
Army, Navy, Pittsburgh, Syra
cuse, Penn State, Notre Dame,
Air Force Academy, California,
UCLA, Sout her n California,
Washington and Stanford.
Academies Disagree
Army and Navy are at odds
with the Air Force because of a
disagreement about scheduling
football games. Roberts reviewed
this situation at some length,
placed the blame on a change of
Air Force policy and said Army
would be willing to play the air
men at a neutral site "so long as
it isn't in Denver or Colorado.
