The recent World Amateur Bas
ketball Championships t urn e d
into a political football Tuesday
as an Indiana senator deplored
the poor showing of the U.S. team
and Communist sources charged
unfair treatment of the .Russian
and Bulgarian teams.
Russia and Bulgaria were dis
qualified from the tournament at
Santiago, Chile, when they re
fused to play a team from Nation
alist China. They claimed the
Chinese team from Formosa did
not represent a nation.
After the disqualification, Bra
zil, which had lost twice 1o the
Russians, was named champion
with the United States second.
Capchart Disturbed
In Washington, Senator Homer
E. Capehart (Rind.) .said he was
disturbed by Russia's defeat of
the U.S. team and even more by
the fact the United States had
failed to send its best possible
team to the championships.
He said the American team ap
parently was selected in the most
haphazard way.
The U.S. was represented by a
pick-up Aii Force team because
no college or AAU team was
available.
Irr Moscow, the newspaper Trud
charged that William Jones, sec
retary general of the Internation
al Amateur Basketball Federa
tion, had ruled unjustly against
the Soviet Union.
"Political Intrigue"
Communist China's official
New China News Agency said the
FIBA "had shamelessly resorted
to political intrigue."
NCNA said a Communist, rath
er than a Nationalist, team should
have represented China.
Trud, Russia's labor organ,
added: "There can be no doubt
that sports history will record
that the 1959 world basketball
champion was the Soviet Union,
undefeated on the courts but un
able to win from the FIBA lead
ers around a table."
