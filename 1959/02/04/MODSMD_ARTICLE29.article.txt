# Cal Gymnastic Meet Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's gymnastics loam
hosts the University of California
gymnasts tonight in the first of
two "Big Matches" between the
schools this month.
Tonight's match is scheduled
for 8 at Encuia Gymnasium. Ad
mission charge is 50 cents. The
teams will meet again Fob. 25 at
Berkeley.
Stanford comes into the match
fresh from a victory over the
Olympic Club last week. Leading
the Card forces arc Norm Pin
cock, shooting for a new school
record in the rope climb; Rich
Hawkins, in free exercise; Dale
Beernink, on the side horse, and
tumbler Bill Abernathy.
The Tribe opened its intercol
legiate season dropping a close
match to San Jose State two
weeks ago. Lack of depth has
been the major problem for coach
Wes Ruff, as San Jose was able
to nose out the Indians on the
strength of fourth and fifth
places.
