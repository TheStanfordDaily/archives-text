# Will Success Spoil Jim Tolbert?
## 
### 
Jim wanted to make good.
Good coffee. But the Biz Club
Lounge (where Jim makes cof
fee) lost customers by the
score. "It's the water," moaned
Jim. So Jim — successful Biz
School student — installed a
Puro Filter. (The first and only

drinking water filter on cam
pus.) Now Jim makes good.
Good coffee. For everyone.
Won't you drop in for a cup
and a snack? Biz Club Lounge.
Watch Jim polish his filter.
