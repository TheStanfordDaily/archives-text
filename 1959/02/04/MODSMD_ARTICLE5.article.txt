The transluccnce of snow, wa
ter and delicate plants has been
captured in almost abstract pho
tographs by artist Alexander YVey
gers, who lectured on "artogra
phy" Tuesday night.
In turning from sculpture and
painting to his new medium, Wey
gers has used his artistic training
to create compositions effective in
color, form and gradations in tone
which often have an Oriental ef
fect.
Willi color slides he illustrated
his method of closing in on com
mon objects such as mushrooms
and tree bark. Weygers has .suc
ceeded in finding in nature forms
beautiful for their own sake, "re
gardless of Ihe recognition of an
object."

tures through gradations of light
as well as sharp contrasts. Look
ing for artistic compositions, Wey
gers scans an object while keep
ing his eye to the viewfinder.
When he hits upon the perfect
arrangement he photographs and
develops it at its actual size with
out magnification or cropping.
With the new artist's tool "you
can see exactly what you're going
to get," Weygers says. Capturing
the sculptural values of form in
natural objects is not accidental
but the result of possessing the
knowledge of the sculptor. "As a
sculptor," he said, "I am satisfied
that these pictures are three-di
mensional" without the use of the
stereopticon.
Experimenting
Weygers is now experimenting
with photographing refracted
light in drops of water. The re
sulting abstractions, with their
complex patterns of line and col
ors. still have through the forms
a connection with .the natural ob
ject of the photograph.
Weygers uses a single-lens re
flex camera with no artificial
light, filters or light meters. "I
hate light meters," he insists.
"Photography per se does not in
terest me"; only the artists search
beyond the obvious to the beauti
ful. "Qualities difficult to set
down in any other medium" arc
caught by the camera, which re
cords what the artist has already
recognized in nature.

With the new artist's tool "you
can see exactly what you're going
to get," Weygers says. Capturing
the sculptural values of form in
natural objects is not accidental
but the result of possessing the
knowledge of the sculptor. "As a
sculptor," he said, "I am satisfied
that these pictures are three-di
mensional" without the use of the
stereopticon.
Experimenting
Weygers is now experimenting
with photographing refracted
light in drops of water. The re
sulting abstractions, with their
complex patterns of line and col
ors. still have through the forms
a connection with .the natural ob
ject of the photograph.
Weygers uses a single-lens re
flex camera with no artificial
light, filters or light meters. "I
hate light meters," he insists.
"Photography per se does not in
terest me"; only the artists search
beyond the obvious to the beauti
ful. "Qualities difficult to set
down in any other medium" arc
caught by the camera, which re
cords what the artist has already
recognized in nature.
The transluccnce of snow, wa

captured in almost abstract pho
