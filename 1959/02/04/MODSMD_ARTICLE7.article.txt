# Poor Ol' Charley--Schulz

### Roger Folsom 
"Yes I'm conivneed that no
body really likes me," said Pea
nuts' creator Charles Schulz yes
terday when asked if he associat
ed himself with his favorite char
acter, Charlie Brown.
Schulz was speaking to the
Tuesday Lunch "Y" religious dis
cussion. As he made charcoal
sketches of his characters in 2.")
seconds flat, he made dry state
ments but willi a grin on his
face.
"To draw a good Charlie Brown
head, it's best to have a pieplate,"
Schulz quoted Lucy while sketch
ing Brown.
Stereo Fussing
Lucy, the "world's No. 1 fuss
budget, winner of the internation
al fussbudget championship," re
cently invented stereophonic fuss
ing: "Two little kids placcd 10
feet apart."
While drawing Snoopy. Schulz
explained, "I'm not aware of your
theologies . . . but personally I
don't think there's anything
wrong with a dog dancing."
In eight years of drawing Pea
nuts, Schulz has received only six
critical letters. Schulz is con
vinced that "holy living must be
24 hours a day and I can't leave
it out of my comic strip."
( leaii. Decent
The strip is designed to be
"clean, decent, so that the editors
know it will never offend anyone
• except perhaps an accordion

player."
Schrocdct, musical genius, w;is
once defeated in a talent contest
by an accordionist. Schulz point
ed out that for Schroeder to he a
virtuoso on his piano is especially
difficult "when you realize that
the black keys are only painted
on."
Kalancc
Pcanuls attempts If) balance
some strips whose authors "ate
not aware of what they are do
ing." Around Christmas Charlie
Brown saw Snoopy shivering in
the snow, walked up to him, said,
"Be of good cheer," and walked
off.
The idea for this strip came
from the New Testament: a pas
sage in .lames which denounces
those who say "Be ye warmed
and filled" by the Christian faith
without giving the poor any food.

"We are living in an age of an
xiety - visit your nearest book
store," Schul/. said. Linus has
found an answer: "He has all the
peace and security he needs with
a piece of outing flannel. It helps
him 3(55 days a year."
Linus' blanket is one of the
very feu- ("2~i ideas at the most
in eight years") Schul/. has got
ten from his children, who con
tinually "carry their beds around
with them" the younger ones
anyway.
Schul/.' offspring range from


S< 111 \:r AM) SNOOPY VISIT STAN FORI)
Creator of Peanuts on campus for religious meet
nine years to nine months, "three
girls and two boys."
Schulz gets his ideas mainly
from just sitting at his drawing
hoard, lie may get an idea, and
then must figure out which of his
characters would most likely say
such a thing. Much of his humor
comes from putting adult re
marks in children's situations.
"Violet," who persecutes Char
lie Brown even more severely
than does Lucy, "represents ;i
type which 1 recall from the sev
enth grade," said Schulz. The
memory nl two girls specifically
telling a third that they Were not
inviting her to their party "in
spired" the creation of Violet.
Snoopy Favorite
Schulz figures from the fan
mail that Snoopy is the public's
most popu 1 a r character. But
"Schroeder," who was disappoint
ed to learn in school that Beetho
ven was not the first President of
the United States, "has a lot of
following." Schulz is ver> much
interested in music ";ts a listen
er."
No Room to (irow
Schulz hopes to enlarge the
strip "that's a good way to spark
it up." Although Linus has "ma
tured," apparently there are no
plans to make the characters
grow up. "After all, they've only
got an inch and a half." Schulz
would like to introduce another
baby to take the place Linus has
grown out of, but he is so rushed
with engagements and doing his
daily and Sunday strips that he
hasn't had time to develop a new
character.
Perhaps Schulz can overcome
these pressures the way Charlie
Brown got his kite down from a
tree -by waiting until the situa
tion improves.

Schulz gets his ideas mainly

grown out of, but he is so rushed
with engagements and doing his
daily and Sunday strips that he
hasn't had time to develop a new
character.
Perhaps Schulz can overcome
these pressures the way Charlie
Brown got his kite down from a
