### Roger Folsom 
"Yes I'm conivneed that no
body really likes me," said Pea
nuts' creator Charles Schulz yes
terday when asked if he associat
ed himself with his favorite char
acter, Charlie Brown.
Schulz was speaking to the
Tuesday Lunch "Y" religious dis
cussion. As he made charcoal
sketches of his characters in 2.")
seconds flat, he made dry state
ments but willi a grin on his
face.
"To draw a good Charlie Brown
head, it's best to have a pieplate,"
Schulz quoted Lucy while sketch
ing Brown.
Stereo Fussing
Lucy, the "world's No. 1 fuss
budget, winner of the internation
al fussbudget championship," re
cently invented stereophonic fuss
ing: "Two little kids placcd 10
feet apart."
While drawing Snoopy. Schulz
explained, "I'm not aware of your
theologies . . . but personally I
don't think there's anything
wrong with a dog dancing."
In eight years of drawing Pea
nuts, Schulz has received only six
critical letters. Schulz is con
vinced that "holy living must be
24 hours a day and I can't leave
it out of my comic strip."
( leaii. Decent
The strip is designed to be
"clean, decent, so that the editors
know it will never offend anyone
• except perhaps an accordion

player."
Schrocdct, musical genius, w;is
once defeated in a talent contest
by an accordionist. Schulz point
ed out that for Schroeder to he a
virtuoso on his piano is especially
difficult "when you realize that
the black keys are only painted
on."
Kalancc
Pcanuls attempts If) balance
some strips whose authors "ate
not aware of what they are do
ing." Around Christmas Charlie
Brown saw Snoopy shivering in
the snow, walked up to him, said,
"Be of good cheer," and walked
off.
The idea for this strip came
from the New Testament: a pas
sage in .lames which denounces
those who say "Be ye warmed
and filled" by the Christian faith
without giving the poor any food.
Anxious Ayr
"We are living in an age of an
xiety - visit your nearest book
store," Schul/. said. Linus has
found an answer: "He has all the
peace and security he needs with
a piece of outing flannel. It helps
him 3(55 days a year."
Linus' blanket is one of the
very feu- ("2~i ideas at the most
in eight years") Schul/. has got
ten from his children, who con
tinually "carry their beds around
with them" the younger ones
anyway.
