# Russian School Official Eyes Cultural Competition
## 
### 
"Approixmately 20 per cent of
all university - level students in
Russia today are studying science
and engineering. A great many
others are studying to be teach
ers."
This rather surprising statistic
was presented by Professor Pan
teleimon Dmitrievich Lebedev,
Main Administrator for Technical
and Machine Building, Higher
Technical Schools in the U.S.S.R.,
Ministry of Higher Education,
who visited campus yesterday
with a Russian delegation in en
gineering education.
Party Members
Other members of the party in
cluded Professors N. P. Bogoro
ditskii, director of the Leningrad
Electro-Technical Institute; K. M.
Barshauskas, director of the Kau
nas Polytechnic Institute; V. I.
Atroshchenko, deputy director of
the Kaunas school; and A. B. Da
vankov, lecturer at the Mcndilccv
Chemical Technological Institute,
M oscow.
Francis B. Stevens, formerly
Director of the Office of Eastern
European Affairs of the U.S. De
partment of State, accompanied
the group and served as intcrprc-

Spokesman for the group. Lobe
dev cordially answered almost all
questions asked of him. He con
tinued, "Peaceful competition be
tween the two countries in cultu
ral fields, attempting to increase
progress in both countries to at
tain a higher standard of living,
not only for the U.S. and Russia,
but for all countries, would be the
i result of student exchanges."
J "There arc a great many things
I

that we can learn from the United
States, and the U.S. can learn
from us," he concluded.
Though hesitant to quote fig
ures regarding the portion of
■Russia's budget currently devoted
to higher education, Lebedev an
swered all other questions direct
ly and enthusiastically.
Students
In answer to the question,
"How many students continue
from secondary schools to univer
sities annually?" the Education
Minister stated. "This year, 1,300,-
000 students will graduate from
secondary schools; of these, about
300,000 will be able to continue
going to school during the day.
The others may continue their ed
ucation in the evenings, or
through special mail courses."
Apparently, as Lebedev expressed
it,"The number who want a high
er education exceeds considerably
the number the schools can ac
commodate."
Graduates
The large number of graduates
was explained by Professor Lebe
dev to be the "wartime genera
tion," and he was confident that
the people who don't continue
their university edueation imme
diately after graduation from sec
ondary schools "may do so later."
Asked about the Soviet Union's
reaction to Soviet Deputy Pre
mier Mikoyan's visit to the U.S.
last month, the Russian respond
ed, "Everybody in the Soviet Un
ion considers that the visit was
beneficial, and that a summit con
ference would be very useful."
With reference to peaceful co
existence Lebedev said, "The best
method through which East-West
tensions could be eased would be
through increased exchanges of
students and other persons and by
increased trade between Eastern
Western Countries."
UnKWers
When queried about what the
engineers of Russia do with their
talents, Lebedev answered, "In
the Soviet Union, alj engineers
have a duty to society ... to build
better houses, more efficient,
more comfortable airplanes to
transport, the people, better ships
for the movement of passengers
and freight. The task of the engi
neers is to make life better for
the Soviet people."
In conclusion, Lebedev stated.
"The future belongs to youth. It
would be beneficial to the youth
of both of our countries to know
one another better. Maximum op
portunities for exchange should
be exploited."

"Approixmately 20 per cent of
all university - level students in
Russia today are studying science

This rather surprising statistic
was presented by Professor Pan

Main Administrator for Technical
and Machine Building, Higher
Technical Schools in the U.S.S.R.,
Ministry of Higher Education,
who visited campus yesterday
with a Russian delegation in en

Francis B. Stevens, formerly
Director of the Office of Eastern
European Affairs of the U.S. De
partment of State, accompanied
the group and served as intcrprc-

Spokesman for the group. Lobe
dev cordially answered almost all
questions asked of him. He con
tinued, "Peaceful competition be
tween the two countries in cultu
ral fields, attempting to increase
progress in both countries to at
tain a higher standard of living,
not only for the U.S. and Russia,
but for all countries, would be the
i result of student exchanges."
J "There arc a great many things
I

that we can learn from the United
States, and the U.S. can learn

Though hesitant to quote fig
ures regarding the portion of
■Russia's budget currently devoted
to higher education, Lebedev an
swered all other questions direct
ly and enthusiastically.
Students
In answer to the question,
"How many students continue
from secondary schools to univer
sities annually?" the Education
Minister stated. "This year, 1,300,-
000 students will graduate from
secondary schools; of these, about
300,000 will be able to continue
going to school during the day.
The others may continue their ed
ucation in the evenings, or
through special mail courses."
Apparently, as Lebedev expressed
it,"The number who want a high
er education exceeds considerably
the number the schools can ac
commodate."
Graduates
The large number of graduates
was explained by Professor Lebe
dev to be the "wartime genera
tion," and he was confident that
the people who don't continue
their university edueation imme
diately after graduation from sec
ondary schools "may do so later."
Asked about the Soviet Union's
reaction to Soviet Deputy Pre
mier Mikoyan's visit to the U.S.
last month, the Russian respond
ed, "Everybody in the Soviet Un
ion considers that the visit was
beneficial, and that a summit con
ference would be very useful."
With reference to peaceful co
existence Lebedev said, "The best
method through which East-West
tensions could be eased would be
through increased exchanges of
students and other persons and by
increased trade between Eastern
Western Countries."

When queried about what the
engineers of Russia do with their
talents, Lebedev answered, "In
the Soviet Union, alj engineers
have a duty to society ... to build
better houses, more efficient,
more comfortable airplanes to
transport, the people, better ships
for the movement of passengers
and freight. The task of the engi

engineers of Russia do with their
talents, Lebedev answered, "In
the Soviet Union, alj engineers
have a duty to society ... to build
better houses, more efficient,
more comfortable airplanes to
transport, the people, better ships
for the movement of passengers
and freight. The task of the engi
neers is to make life better for
the Soviet people."
In conclusion, Lebedev stated.
"The future belongs to youth. It
would be beneficial to the youth
of both of our countries to know
one another better. Maximum op
portunities for exchange should
be exploited."

"Approixmately 20 per cent of
all university - level students in
Russia today are studying science
and engineering. A great many
others are studying to be teach
ers."
This rather surprising statistic
was presented by Professor Pan
teleimon Dmitrievich Lebedev,
Main Administrator for Technical
and Machine Building, Higher
Technical Schools in the U.S.S.R.,
Ministry of Higher Education,
who visited campus yesterday
with a Russian delegation in en
gineering education.
Party Members
Other members of the party in
cluded Professors N. P. Bogoro
ditskii, director of the Leningrad
Electro-Technical Institute; K. M.
Barshauskas, director of the Kau
nas Polytechnic Institute; V. I.
Atroshchenko, deputy director of
the Kaunas school; and A. B. Da
vankov, lecturer at the Mcndilccv
Chemical Technological Institute,
M oscow.
Francis B. Stevens, formerly
Director of the Office of Eastern
European Affairs of the U.S. De
partment of State, accompanied
the group and served as intcrprc-

Spokesman for the group. Lobe
dev cordially answered almost all
questions asked of him. He con
tinued, "Peaceful competition be
tween the two countries in cultu
ral fields, attempting to increase
progress in both countries to at
tain a higher standard of living,
not only for the U.S. and Russia,
but for all countries, would be the
i result of student exchanges."
J "There arc a great many things
I

that we can learn from the United
States, and the U.S. can learn
from us," he concluded.
Though hesitant to quote fig
ures regarding the portion of
■Russia's budget currently devoted
to higher education, Lebedev an
swered all other questions direct
ly and enthusiastically.
Students
In answer to the question,
"How many students continue
from secondary schools to univer
sities annually?" the Education
Minister stated. "This year, 1,300,-
000 students will graduate from
secondary schools; of these, about
300,000 will be able to continue
going to school during the day.
The others may continue their ed
ucation in the evenings, or
through special mail courses."
Apparently, as Lebedev expressed
it,"The number who want a high
er education exceeds considerably
the number the schools can ac
commodate."
Graduates
The large number of graduates
was explained by Professor Lebe
dev to be the "wartime genera
tion," and he was confident that
the people who don't continue
their university edueation imme
diately after graduation from sec
ondary schools "may do so later."
Asked about the Soviet Union's
reaction to Soviet Deputy Pre
mier Mikoyan's visit to the U.S.
last month, the Russian respond
ed, "Everybody in the Soviet Un
ion considers that the visit was
beneficial, and that a summit con
ference would be very useful."
With reference to peaceful co
existence Lebedev said, "The best
method through which East-West
tensions could be eased would be
through increased exchanges of
students and other persons and by
increased trade between Eastern
Western Countries."
