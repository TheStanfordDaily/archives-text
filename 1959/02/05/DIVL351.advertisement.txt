Superclinic in
Palo Alto Brings
New Hope to
Crippled
Kids
Once treatment for physically, men

and was fantastically expensive. But
no more!
In this week's Saturday Evening Post
you'll read how the amazing Chil

University gives crippled kids the
finest care —at prices parents can af
ford. (And, best of all, lets the chil
dren go home at night, so they never
know the horror of being "sent
away.") You'll learn how famed pe
diatrician Dr. Esther Clark fought an
uphill battle to get the clinic started.
And you'll meet the courageous,
trusting kids who depend on this
unique clinic for their very lives.
Don't miss the heartwarming story
of Palo Alto's "Superclinic for Kids
Only."
It's a wonderful week in the Posf . . .
