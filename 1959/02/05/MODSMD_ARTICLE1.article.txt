# New Tests Planned for 'Electrodynamic Idea'

"The most sensitive test of the
electrodynamic theory at short
distances yet planned" will be
come a part of Stanford's Mark
111 linear accelerator within the
next 12 months.
Professor Carlisle Barber re
vealed details Wednesday of the
$800,000 project, which is sup
ported under a joint program of
the Office of Naval Research and
the Atomic Energy Commission.
Design for the experimental
setup has been worked out by
Professor G. K. O'Neill of Prince
ton's Palmer Physical Labora
tory. Stanford colaborators are
Barber, Professor W. K. H. Panof
sky and Dr. Burton Richter.
The experiment itself will in
volve the collision of 500 million
electron volt electrons injected
into stainless steel, super-vacuum
"storage rings." Shaped like
doughnuts 10 feet in diameter,
the rings will join to form a fig
ure 8. Where the two rings join,
hear! -on collisions of opposing
electrons, traveling at approxi
mately the speed of light, will re
sult in a billion-volt crash.
At the point of collision, ultra
sensitive counting and measuring
instruments will be mounted at
all posible angles to check direc
tion, number and energy of the
scattering electrons. The result
ing data, which should be avail
able in two years, should provide
convincing evidence regarding
the validity of quantum electro

dynamics at hyper - short dis
tances.
"We are worried that the laws
of electrodynamics won't be right
at smaller distances. They are re

liable down to 10 cm.," Barber
continued. "This experiment
should extend the domain of our
knowledge for a reasonable num
ber of dollars."
