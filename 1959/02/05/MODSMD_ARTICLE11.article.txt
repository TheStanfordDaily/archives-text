# Ike Again Fights Reckless Spending
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€”President
Eisenhower challenged the Demo
cratic-controlled Congress Wed
nesday to offset what he termed
reckless spending with higher
taxes.
Leaping roughshod on a $3 bil
lion Democratic - sponsored hous
ing bill now before the Senate for
action, Eisenhower protested:
"Now, this means that right off

in the very first bill the budget is
to be unbalanced."
A few hours after Eisenhower
spoke, the Senate turned down a
GOP substitute aimed at cutting
the Democratic bill back to levels
favored by the President, and the
House approved a GI home loan
bill over Republican protests that
"budget busters are on the move."
Before it adjourned overnight,

however, the Senate agreed by
voice vote to cut in half a $300
million provision for direct home
loans to veterans. Democratic
backers of the bill agreed to the
change, which had the effect of
cutting the total authorization to
$2,775,000,000.
"Talking Sense"
On the business of spending
and deficits, the chief executive
said ho was just talking sense.
He said lie is going to keep right
on hammering away, because he
is against "making everything
everything more expensive -
more expensive for the housewife
and for you and me and for every
body else."
"I don't believe that we should
have higher taxes," Eisenhower
said firmly, "and I do not believe
that the United States wants high
er taxes. That means If) me living
within your income by avoiding
unnecessary expenditures.
A Prediction
The people would accept higher
taxes to meet a clear emergency,
Eisenhower predicted. But he
said that income taxes, the main
stay of federal revenue, "are get
ting about as high as you can
keep them on the indefinite ba
sis."
