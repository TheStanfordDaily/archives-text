HELMSTEDT, Germany (/P) -
Under sharp attack by I ho United
States, Soviet authorities Wednes
day afternoon turned loose a U.S.
Army truck convoy they had held
in East Germany for - 53 hours.
The U.S. Stale Department,
hacked by President Eisenhower,
had delivered a stiff protest to
Moscow against any interference
with the Western allies' access to
Berlin.
The convoy, en route from Ber
lin to West Germany, was de
tained Monday afternoon within
sight of the East-West border.
The Soviet Army demanded an
inspection of the cargoes. But
Findley Burns Jr., political ad
viser to the U.S. Army mission in
East Berlin, who came here for
the final negotiations, said the
Soviets were not allowed to in
spect the inside of the trucks,
which were loaded with Jeeps.
The United States thus won a
point in its efforts to prevent the
Soviets from gradually clamping
a stranglehold on the highway
suppply line to Berlin, isolated
110 miles behind the Iron Curtain.
The State Department said re
fusal to let the trucks through
without inspection was a "clear
violation" nf American rights, un
der four-power agreements since
1945, to free access to Berlin.
