# Kennedy Denounces Ike's New Labor Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (JP)â€”Senator John F. Kennedy < D Mass.) Wed
nesday denounced President Eisenhower's labor bill as "an open
invitation to collusion between corrupt employers and labor rack
eteers." The senator, presiding over a hearing on labor legislation,
fired back in sharp words as Secretary of Labor Mitchell indirectly
attacked as inadequate Kennedy's own bill aimed at corruption in
unions.
Kennedy said the administration's bill goes too far. He said it
would encourage more labor racketeering, deny honest unions their
best weapons against existing racketeering and impose "dangerous
restrictions on workers' traditional legitimate rights of free speech
and peaceful bargaining."
Kennedy tore into the administration measure after the labor
secretary read a lengthy statement which never specifically men
tioned Kennedy's bill. Bul what Mitchell said obviously was aimed
at it.
Mitchell said any bill would be only a partial answer at best if
it does not deal with secondary boycotts, "blackmail picketing" and
the no-man's-land in labor-management relations in which neither
the federal nor state governments now assume jurisdiction.
Secondary boycotts involve strikes against a third party not di
rectly involved in a labor dispute.
"Blackmail picketing" refers to picketing to force recognition
of a union where employees have already indicated they do not
want a union to represent them.
