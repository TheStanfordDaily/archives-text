A tr;un of nine Justice Depart

evidence to ihe jury for several
weeks, the source said.
Frederick G. Donner, GM board
chairman, said the subpoena call
ed for "a tremendous amount of
information, records and reports."

this request, it obviously reqtiirrs
considerable study and analysis
on our part," Donner said. "We
have not had an opportunity to

examine the subpoena in detail."
