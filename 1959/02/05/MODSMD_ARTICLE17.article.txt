# Air Force Shoots Alias Missile

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (/V)
- Atlas No. 20 logged a highly
successful flight Wednesday in
the Air Force's stepped-up cam
paign to develop the mighty inter
continental range ballistic mis
sile.
The 80-foot Atlas, present main
stay of the U.S. missile arsenal,
thundered aloft in the morning
darkness. It hung in the sky as
a white dot of light for more than
three minutes before fading.
The Air Force announced later
that the missile had a successful
flight at a distance less than in
tercontinental range, but officials
did not elaborate.
Before the shoot, sources indi
cated that the rocket would be
another "hot rod"â€”the missile
man's term for a long-range shot
at full throttle.
One of the major objectives of
the shoot reportedly was to check
the performance of the blunt
shaped nose cone as it separated
from the main body of the missile
high in space.
