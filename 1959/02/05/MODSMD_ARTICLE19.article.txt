# Winter Drive

We SUBMIT there is room for misgiving about the equity of Com*
inunity (Sliest drives and about the effectiveness ol the lied ( ross,
hut that is of only partial relevance to the support of W inter Drive
this week on the Stanford campus.
If ice can agree flint Stanford students should const iter
themselves a part of /lie I'alo Alto community, then a part
of the obi i gat ion of such a relut ionshi p would he to sn />•
port the commnnity-ivide charities that basically gin'
guidance, to children and help to the needy.
Several other important points for consideration are that the
Stanford "YV' sole support is the I'alo Alto Community Chest,
that the Community Chest also sponsors work for the Con Home,
and that the Red Cross holds life-saving classes in connection with
the Stanford I\E. department, and furnishes Stanford students
with various hospital services.
The Community Chest will contribute $..M)0 this year to the
Stanford "Y"—more than most \\ inter Drives have netted in the
past.
For these reasons \\ inter Drive deserves our support.
