While we are muttering about
the curse of mid-terms and extra
long assignments that seem to be
piling up, we must feel sorry for
thosa sad souls who either are
just or have just fin
ished their finals. Of course,
these are the breaks with the se
mester system.
In the Foothill College (Moun
tain View) paper, we found an
appropriate headline: "Finals
Point Up Lack of Study."

And in Miami,
physics students
at that univer
sity got a little
upset when they
learned that al
most 70 per cent
oft he m ha d
flunked the fi
nal. So m e of
them went so far
as to break the
glass covering
the bu 11 et in
board on which

the grades had been posted.
"The whole cause was had prep
aration by the students," said the
chairman of the physics depart
ment.
And we complain about the
curve?
Pepperdine College reacted to
finals by suggesting remedies for
the occupational disease of all the
teachers, "Lowerthegradeaverage
byflunkingitis." Suggestions in
cluded raising tuition rates and
sending all of the faculty on paid
vacations during finals with the
excess cash; having the students
come to class on a "Pay for a
Day" basis; or else replacing the
traditional apple for the teacher
with a Milltown.
Well, we still have five weeks
left till doomsday.
Though we feel slightly iso
lated from contact with other
colleges when it comes to fi
nals, food seems to be a univer
sal problem on any campus —
it's bad.

And when we find an editorial
in the Pepperdine paper headed
"Ptomaine Thwarted," whi c h
talks about lads and lassies who
seem to look much more cheerful
than is usual, and then we dis
cover that the cause for all of this
cheer is just that the food on cam
pus is better—well, we begin to
wonder about our own Friday
night dinners.
We also found that a riot has
recently occurred at the Univer
sity of Minnesota, caused by the
inefficiency of their All - Univer
sity Congress in handling student
grievances. A group of banner
and placard-carrying students, ac
companied by a battered bugle
and a drummer who used an old
trash can, assembled in front of
their Union to demonstrate.
Their leader peppered the
crowd with questions like: "What
has AUC done for you? What has
that organization done about the
parking problem? The housing
problem? The food? The closed
files at the Library? Pay for the
faculty? The dormitory curfew?
Eventually the crowd broke
up, but the leader stayed
around to answer questions and
to illst i 11 his enthusiasm into
some of the less certain follow
ers.
And (shades of Castro!) lie
even had a beard.
Then we stumbled across a lit
tle tidbit in a paper from a uni
versity in East Germany. It seems
that ail members of the "rising in
telligentsia" are now required to
pursue a study of Marxism-Lenin
ism, consisting of at least three
lectures a week or a two-hour
lecture and a four-hour seminar
every two weeks.
In the last lines of the order,
we found this: "The deans and
department heads will see to it
that the members of the rising in
telligentsia do pursue a curricu
lum in Marxism-Leninism."
And we thought that the Gen
eral Studies requirements were a
little stiff!
