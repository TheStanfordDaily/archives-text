Editor, The Daily:
World events coverage has a
place in a college newspaper but
should one topic, for instance, in
tegration, be allotted a total of
one-half page or one-fourth of the
paper that is not advertisements?
And should outstanding campus
events be shuttled into the OATQ
suspects a particular committee
which a student scans only if he
meeting or rehearsal?
Your OATQ policy stifles pub
licity on campus events and al
lows less combined space for the
campus appearances of a sym

phony soloist and a nationally
known cartoonist than for a local
opera production which is next
week, doesn't need our help to sell
out, and could be covered in a
four-line announcement.
Why not split the OATQ hodge
podge into two articles: one for
announcements of meetings, re
hearsals, deadlines; a second for
fuller coverage of campus activi
ties of high quality and which
rely on The Daily for publicity.
As it is now, one can find out
more about a Tuesday Noon Mu
sicale by reading the Palo Alto
Times than by reading The Daily.
