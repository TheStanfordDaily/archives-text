## Fulbright Replaces Green on Foreign Affairs Committee; Improvement Seen 
### Walter Lippmann 
Senator Green has decided
wisely both in resigning as chair
man and in remaining as the sen
ior member of the Committee on
Foreign Relations. Old men, the
Greeks used to say, should not be
leaders but councilors, and Sena
tor Green with his long experi
ence and his vigorous memory
will be a good councilor.
Senator Fulbright, who suc
ceeds him, is a much younger
man. But he is an old hand. In
terms of his interest and active
participation in foreign affairs,
which dates back to the early
days of the Second World War,
there are few if any members of
Congress who have such long and
continuous inside knowledge. In
thinking about his differences
with Mr. Dulles, it is well to re
member that in so far as he has
been critical, he has spoken as
one of the pioneers and early sup
porters of the global policies
which have replaced the old iso
lationism.
As a matter of fact, a study of
his record will show, I believe,
that the weight of his criticism
has been directed not against the
great purposes of foreign policy
but against mistakes and distor
tions in their application.
His advent as chairman of the

committee mauks a turning point
for the better in the conduct of
our foreign policy. For the first
time since the new era which be
gan with World War 11, the Ad
ministration will have a respon
sible and articulate and loyal op
position. Until the conversion of
Senator Vandenberg at the end of
the war, the opposition was sul
len and destructive. The Vanden
berg arrangement was an emer
gency device for getting indis
pensible things done. But for the
long run it was not a good method
of governing. For instead of pro
moting debate, which educates
I he people and refines the policy
of the Administration, the Van
denberg bi-partisan system avoid
ed and evaded debate. The same
must be said for the so-called bi
partisan arrangement with Sena
tor Walter George, who sup
pressed debate when the country
would have been much better
served by a thorough debate.
The time has now come, as the
last three Congressional elections
have made sharply clear, when—
within the framework of our
world responsibilities — we must
move beyond the stereotypes and

the slogans of the post-war years.
We cannot stand pat forever on
all the positions taken in the post
war era. For the post-war era is
ending, and here and abroad
among our allies a new genera
tion is on he threshold of of pow
er. With Senator Fulbright as
the chairman of the committee,
the windows of the Senate will be
open to the fresh air of a new
time.
By coincidence, Mr. Dulles had
just about decided to go to West
ern Europe when Senator Green
stepped down. It is no secret that
Mr. Dulles will be trying to work
out with Dr. Adenauer and our
other big European allies, a work
able policy about Berlin and Ger
many.
It will help him, not hurt him,
if it is known in Europe that there
is building up in the new Con
gress an insistence that we move
off dead center, and do something
more than declaim the reasons
why we cannot do anything at all
about anything.

war era. For the post-war era is
ending, and here and abroad
among our allies a new genera
tion is on he threshold of of pow
er. With Senator Fulbright as
the chairman of the committee,
the windows of the Senate will be
open to the fresh air of a new
time.
By coincidence, Mr. Dulles had
just about decided to go to West
ern Europe when Senator Green
stepped down. It is no secret that
Mr. Dulles will be trying to work
out with Dr. Adenauer and our
other big European allies, a work
able policy about Berlin and Ger
many.
It will help him, not hurt him,
if it is known in Europe that there
is building up in the new Con
gress an insistence that we move
off dead center, and do something
more than declaim the reasons
why we cannot do anything at all
about anything.
Senator Green has decided
wisely both in resigning as chair
man and in remaining as the sen
ior member of the Committee on
Foreign Relations. Old men, the
Greeks used to say, should not be
leaders but councilors, and Sena
tor Green with his long experi
ence and his vigorous memory
will be a good councilor.
Senator Fulbright, who suc
ceeds him, is a much younger
man. But he is an old hand. In
terms of his interest and active
participation in foreign affairs,
which dates back to the early
days of the Second World War,
there are few if any members of
Congress who have such long and
continuous inside knowledge. In
thinking about his differences
with Mr. Dulles, it is well to re
member that in so far as he has
been critical, he has spoken as
one of the pioneers and early sup
porters of the global policies
which have replaced the old iso
lationism.
As a matter of fact, a study of
his record will show, I believe,
that the weight of his criticism
has been directed not against the
great purposes of foreign policy
but against mistakes and distor
tions in their application.
His advent as chairman of the

committee mauks a turning point
for the better in the conduct of
our foreign policy. For the first
time since the new era which be
gan with World War 11, the Ad
ministration will have a respon
sible and articulate and loyal op
position. Until the conversion of
Senator Vandenberg at the end of
the war, the opposition was sul
len and destructive. The Vanden
berg arrangement was an emer
gency device for getting indis
pensible things done. But for the
long run it was not a good method
of governing. For instead of pro
moting debate, which educates
I he people and refines the policy
of the Administration, the Van
denberg bi-partisan system avoid
ed and evaded debate. The same
must be said for the so-called bi
partisan arrangement with Sena
tor Walter George, who sup
pressed debate when the country
would have been much better
served by a thorough debate.
The time has now come, as the
last three Congressional elections
have made sharply clear, when—
within the framework of our
world responsibilities — we must
move beyond the stereotypes and

the slogans of the post-war years.
We cannot stand pat forever on
all the positions taken in the post
war era. For the post-war era is
ending, and here and abroad
among our allies a new genera
