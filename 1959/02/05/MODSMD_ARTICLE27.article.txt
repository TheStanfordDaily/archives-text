# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
From the Southland
After months of hearing from the Southland all about how Stan
ford was about ready to join the AAWU, it's refreshing to see some
column material from there that indicates the situation more accu
rately.
Max Stiles broke through the barrier vvilh a Mirror-News column
headlined "Stanford Cool Toward AAWU." lie led off with a state
ment from I NC athletic director -less Hill that said the Indians "have
shown no inclination to join" with USC, UCLA, Cal and Washington
in the already-troubled new league.
Originally everyone down there thought that Stanford would be
in the fold by the time the new circuit opened its doors for business
on July 1. But with the Cards sitting tight, the latest speculation on
new members has shifted to the Air Force Academy.
With the Falcons already rising to the upper echelons of the na
tional collegiate sports picture, they would be a welcome member
to the AAWIJ. The Big Four can certainly use more members, and
the prestige value they would gain from attracting the Air Force
would give the league a big boost.
Within Ihe past few months, the Air Academy has indicated in
terest in virtually every new league being proposed. If the Big Four
lures them well .. . more power to 'em. But as far as Stanford is
concerned, we have only the oft-repeated plea to not got tangled
in a league set-up with Bruins and Trojans & Company.
Troy Was (in illv
Speaking of Troy, sentiment-from their own territory seems to be
turning just a bit against them as a result of their latest two-year
probation. The first comments were along the line of, "The penalties
were too stiff, but then why was SC so stupid as to get caught?"
But now that llill has played his part in getting rid of the head
recruiter and an assistant coach—the goats in the affair —there are
rumblings that perhaps Troy's offenses weren't as minor as they
were made out to be. Sid Ziff wrote in The Inside Track:
"Those hitter tears all of us sobbed for poor SC for getting clob
bered by the NCAA may have been wasted. The Trojans put two
of their top recruiters on probation yesterday. It was the sort of
action that indicates there was truth in the NCAA charges.
The impression here had been that SC was given the works for
some technical violations that were minor in nature. . . . Obviously,
SC has now taken the first steps in an athletic housecleaning and
this wasn't such a small affair after all."
Switching the subject to track, but s1 ill staying with the Trojans,
it looks like the penalized ones are still going to try to win the na
tional spike championship.
Use's title effort won't come in the NCAA championships—
they're barred, remember but will be made in the National AAU
meet at Boulder, Colo. Normally, the USC group would all join the
Southern California St riders for AAU competition, butt the word is
that the Trojans are just mad enough about their penalties to want
to prove they're the best track team in the country.
Limnier's Tosses Improve
Shifting the track spotlight from USC to Stanford, we find a few
pleasant surprises have greeted Coach Pay ton Jordan in recent
weeks. The biggest of all was Harlan Linuner's discus-throwing
or, at least, one of his throws—in Saturday's AAU developmental
competition.
I.burner's problem in two years of throwing has been trajcclory—
the discus goes high, then" falls short, instead of whipping out on a
more slowly-rising plane. Cause of the problem has been faulty
positioning of his throwing arm, but it's been terribly difficult for
Limmer to break his fault.
But whether the result of accident or a final breaking of the habit,
Limmer finally got his arm in the groove Saturday. And the result
was a throw of lf>7-9, more than eight feet farther than his previous
best.
WHAT NIiXT? While we've been enthused, and rightfully so,
about the exploits of high school milers in this area, who should
come along but a 17-year-old who can high-jump seven feet. With
people like John Thomas coming along, it all makes one wonder
where in the world the ceiling will be in track.

about the exploits of high school milers in this area, who should
come along but a 17-year-old who can high-jump seven feet. With

From the Southland
After months of hearing from the Southland all about how Stan
ford was about ready to join the AAWU, it's refreshing to see some
column material from there that indicates the situation more accu
rately.
Max Stiles broke through the barrier vvilh a Mirror-News column
headlined "Stanford Cool Toward AAWU." lie led off with a state
ment from I NC athletic director -less Hill that said the Indians "have
shown no inclination to join" with USC, UCLA, Cal and Washington
in the already-troubled new league.
Originally everyone down there thought that Stanford would be
in the fold by the time the new circuit opened its doors for business
on July 1. But with the Cards sitting tight, the latest speculation on
new members has shifted to the Air Force Academy.
With the Falcons already rising to the upper echelons of the na
tional collegiate sports picture, they would be a welcome member
to the AAWIJ. The Big Four can certainly use more members, and
the prestige value they would gain from attracting the Air Force
would give the league a big boost.
Within Ihe past few months, the Air Academy has indicated in
terest in virtually every new league being proposed. If the Big Four
lures them well .. . more power to 'em. But as far as Stanford is
concerned, we have only the oft-repeated plea to not got tangled
in a league set-up with Bruins and Trojans & Company.
Troy Was (in illv
Speaking of Troy, sentiment-from their own territory seems to be
turning just a bit against them as a result of their latest two-year
probation. The first comments were along the line of, "The penalties
were too stiff, but then why was SC so stupid as to get caught?"
But now that llill has played his part in getting rid of the head
recruiter and an assistant coach—the goats in the affair —there are
rumblings that perhaps Troy's offenses weren't as minor as they
were made out to be. Sid Ziff wrote in The Inside Track:
"Those hitter tears all of us sobbed for poor SC for getting clob
bered by the NCAA may have been wasted. The Trojans put two
of their top recruiters on probation yesterday. It was the sort of
action that indicates there was truth in the NCAA charges.
The impression here had been that SC was given the works for
some technical violations that were minor in nature. . . . Obviously,
SC has now taken the first steps in an athletic housecleaning and
this wasn't such a small affair after all."
Switching the subject to track, but s1 ill staying with the Trojans,
it looks like the penalized ones are still going to try to win the na
tional spike championship.
Use's title effort won't come in the NCAA championships—
they're barred, remember but will be made in the National AAU
meet at Boulder, Colo. Normally, the USC group would all join the
Southern California St riders for AAU competition, butt the word is
that the Trojans are just mad enough about their penalties to want
to prove they're the best track team in the country.
Limnier's Tosses Improve
Shifting the track spotlight from USC to Stanford, we find a few
pleasant surprises have greeted Coach Pay ton Jordan in recent
weeks. The biggest of all was Harlan Linuner's discus-throwing
or, at least, one of his throws—in Saturday's AAU developmental
competition.
I.burner's problem in two years of throwing has been trajcclory—
the discus goes high, then" falls short, instead of whipping out on a
more slowly-rising plane. Cause of the problem has been faulty
positioning of his throwing arm, but it's been terribly difficult for
Limmer to break his fault.
But whether the result of accident or a final breaking of the habit,
Limmer finally got his arm in the groove Saturday. And the result
was a throw of lf>7-9, more than eight feet farther than his previous
best.

best.
WHAT NIiXT? While we've been enthused, and rightfully so,
about the exploits of high school milers in this area, who should
come along but a 17-year-old who can high-jump seven feet. With

From the Southland
After months of hearing from the Southland all about how Stan
ford was about ready to join the AAWU, it's refreshing to see some
column material from there that indicates the situation more accu
rately.
Max Stiles broke through the barrier vvilh a Mirror-News column
headlined "Stanford Cool Toward AAWU." lie led off with a state
ment from I NC athletic director -less Hill that said the Indians "have
shown no inclination to join" with USC, UCLA, Cal and Washington
in the already-troubled new league.
Originally everyone down there thought that Stanford would be
in the fold by the time the new circuit opened its doors for business
on July 1. But with the Cards sitting tight, the latest speculation on
new members has shifted to the Air Force Academy.
With the Falcons already rising to the upper echelons of the na
tional collegiate sports picture, they would be a welcome member
to the AAWIJ. The Big Four can certainly use more members, and
the prestige value they would gain from attracting the Air Force
would give the league a big boost.
Within Ihe past few months, the Air Academy has indicated in
terest in virtually every new league being proposed. If the Big Four
lures them well .. . more power to 'em. But as far as Stanford is
concerned, we have only the oft-repeated plea to not got tangled
in a league set-up with Bruins and Trojans & Company.
Troy Was (in illv
Speaking of Troy, sentiment-from their own territory seems to be
turning just a bit against them as a result of their latest two-year
probation. The first comments were along the line of, "The penalties
were too stiff, but then why was SC so stupid as to get caught?"
But now that llill has played his part in getting rid of the head
recruiter and an assistant coach—the goats in the affair —there are
rumblings that perhaps Troy's offenses weren't as minor as they
were made out to be. Sid Ziff wrote in The Inside Track:
"Those hitter tears all of us sobbed for poor SC for getting clob
bered by the NCAA may have been wasted. The Trojans put two
of their top recruiters on probation yesterday. It was the sort of
action that indicates there was truth in the NCAA charges.
The impression here had been that SC was given the works for
some technical violations that were minor in nature. . . . Obviously,
SC has now taken the first steps in an athletic housecleaning and
this wasn't such a small affair after all."
Switching the subject to track, but s1 ill staying with the Trojans,
it looks like the penalized ones are still going to try to win the na
tional spike championship.
Use's title effort won't come in the NCAA championships—
they're barred, remember but will be made in the National AAU
meet at Boulder, Colo. Normally, the USC group would all join the
Southern California St riders for AAU competition, butt the word is
that the Trojans are just mad enough about their penalties to want
to prove they're the best track team in the country.
Limnier's Tosses Improve
Shifting the track spotlight from USC to Stanford, we find a few
pleasant surprises have greeted Coach Pay ton Jordan in recent
weeks. The biggest of all was Harlan Linuner's discus-throwing
or, at least, one of his throws—in Saturday's AAU developmental
competition.
I.burner's problem in two years of throwing has been trajcclory—
the discus goes high, then" falls short, instead of whipping out on a
more slowly-rising plane. Cause of the problem has been faulty
positioning of his throwing arm, but it's been terribly difficult for
Limmer to break his fault.
But whether the result of accident or a final breaking of the habit,
Limmer finally got his arm in the groove Saturday. And the result
was a throw of lf>7-9, more than eight feet farther than his previous
best.
WHAT NIiXT? While we've been enthused, and rightfully so,
about the exploits of high school milers in this area, who should
come along but a 17-year-old who can high-jump seven feet. With
people like John Thomas coming along, it all makes one wonder
where in the world the ceiling will be in track.
