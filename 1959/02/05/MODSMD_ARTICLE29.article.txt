# Card Ring Hopes Rest on Grimm
## 
### Mike Tobriner 
Justifiably enthusiastic over his
T>9 squad is Stanford boxing men
tor Ray Lunny, whose fighters
last week came up against a
strong University of San Fran
cisco team, didn't lose a bout and
won overwhelmingly,
Star attraction on the Indian
squad is power-packed, KO-deal
ing heavyweight Trev Grirnrn,
whom Coach Lunny terms a sure
comer and potentially great.
Grimm, a junior, has TKO'd both
of tho two men he's faced this sea
son and is yet to be fully tested.
Lunny l'cels Grimm will rate
high in the Pacific Coast tourna
ment this year.
Up from PE
Far from having wide outside
experience, every man on the
squad has risen from Stanford's
elementary PE boxing courses.
From them came sophomore Jim
Tompkins, slick, hard-puniching
132-pounder who has TKO'd both
of the two opponents he has met
this season.
Coach Lunny calls Tompkins a
great, prospect and describes in
ihe same way rugged, powerful
Talton Ray, sophomore 178-
pounder who TKO'd his USF op
ponent in the opening round. Both
in their first season of college
fighting, Tompkins and Ray will
be in action next when Stanford
meets USF in San Francisco to
night, and again when the In
dians face Santa Clara at home
on Feb. 9.
Logsdon Comes Back
Team 139 pounder Tom Logs
don, a strong, tough senior, was
held to a draw in his first fight of
the season when Stanford met
Santa Clara. Logsdon, more the
slugger than boxer type, hit his
stride against USF, TKO'd his op
ponent handily.
Losing his first bout but com
ing back to win his next was
smooth - punching 147 - pounder
Roger Gertmenian, another of the
squad's seniors.
Stepping in to close a breach
left by an ineligibility, nifty-box
ing 156-pounder John Wilhelmy
has filled the gap at his weight
exceptionally well.
Also taking up slack left, by an
ineligibility is Ed Mitchell, senior
165-pounder, who won his fight:
against Santa Clara in the team's
first meet but failed 1o compete
in the USF matches because of
injury.
Hard - hitting Bill McDonald,
178-pounder, has boxed two draws
this season, looks forward to
breaking into the win tonight.
Remaining boxing meets:
Feb. S—USF at USF
Feb. 9 —Santa Clara at Stanford
Feb. 12 —California at Stanford
Feb. 25 —California at Berkeley

held to a draw in his first fight of
the season when Stanford met
Santa Clara. Logsdon, more the
slugger than boxer type, hit his
stride against USF, TKO'd his op
ponent handily.
Losing his first bout but com
ing back to win his next was
smooth - punching 147 - pounder
Roger Gertmenian, another of the
squad's seniors.
Stepping in to close a breach
left by an ineligibility, nifty-box
ing 156-pounder John Wilhelmy
has filled the gap at his weight
exceptionally well.
Also taking up slack left, by an
ineligibility is Ed Mitchell, senior
165-pounder, who won his fight:
against Santa Clara in the team's
first meet but failed 1o compete
in the USF matches because of
injury.
Hard - hitting Bill McDonald,
178-pounder, has boxed two draws
this season, looks forward to
breaking into the win tonight.
Remaining boxing meets:
Feb. S—USF at USF
Feb. 9 —Santa Clara at Stanford
Feb. 12 —California at Stanford
Feb. 25 —California at Berkeley


TREV GRIMM
Top heavyweight
Justifiably enthusiastic over his
T>9 squad is Stanford boxing men
tor Ray Lunny, whose fighters
last week came up against a
strong University of San Fran
cisco team, didn't lose a bout and
won overwhelmingly,
Star attraction on the Indian
squad is power-packed, KO-deal
ing heavyweight Trev Grirnrn,
whom Coach Lunny terms a sure
comer and potentially great.
Grimm, a junior, has TKO'd both
of tho two men he's faced this sea
son and is yet to be fully tested.
Lunny l'cels Grimm will rate
high in the Pacific Coast tourna
ment this year.
Up from PE
Far from having wide outside
experience, every man on the
squad has risen from Stanford's
elementary PE boxing courses.
From them came sophomore Jim
Tompkins, slick, hard-puniching
132-pounder who has TKO'd both
of the two opponents he has met
this season.
Coach Lunny calls Tompkins a
great, prospect and describes in
ihe same way rugged, powerful
Talton Ray, sophomore 178-
pounder who TKO'd his USF op
ponent in the opening round. Both
in their first season of college
fighting, Tompkins and Ray will
be in action next when Stanford
meets USF in San Francisco to
night, and again when the In

on Feb. 9.
