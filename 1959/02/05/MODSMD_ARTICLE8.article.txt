# Alexandria Must Mix Schools
## 
### 
RICHMOND, Va. (A') â€” A fed
eral judge told a third roluctant
Virginia community Wednesday
it must admit nine Negro pupils
to white schools next Tuesday.
The order of District Court
Judge Albert V. Bryan to the
school board of Alexandria came
as Norfolk and Arlington went
through a third peaceful and al
most routine day of racially
mixed classes.
Judge Bryan announced his de
cision a day after hearing argu
ments on a challenge to the school
board's action in turning down 14
Negro application for transfer to
white schools.
Three to Open
He ruled that Alexandria, a few
miles down the Potomac from
Washington, must open three
white schools to nine of the Ne
groes. He said the board's refusal
to admit the five others was prop
er because of residence nearer a
Negro school in the case of three
high school applicants in the case
of the two rejected grade school
applicants.
But he said he found no basis,
other than race, for the turndown
of the other nine.
Temporary Respite
Orderly compliance by Alexan
dria in the Norfolk-Arlington pat
tern should bring a temporary
respite in the running school cri
sis. Charlottesville, granted a de
lay by a U.S. appeals judge, re
opened a high school and an ele
mentary school Wednesday on an
all-white basis to ajl bul about 300
of 1675 displaced pupils.
The two schools, along with six
in Norfolk, had not opened for the
September term because of state
laws designed to fend off federal
integration order. Those laws
since have been declared unconsti
tutional.
