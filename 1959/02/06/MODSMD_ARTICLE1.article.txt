# Captured Men Returned from East Germany
## 
### 
HELMSTEDT. Germany (,V) Lieutenant Richard Mackin, an
Army pilot, and four soldiers came back to freedom Thursday after
weeks of captivity in Soviet-occupied East Germany.
Looking strained and weary, they were released across the West
German frontier at Herleshausen under an agreement between the

American Red Cross and the East
German Red Cross.
Four trucks carrying routine
supplies moved without delay
through two Soviet checkpoints
on tho 110-mile autobahn between
Berlin and the West after the
United States successfully resist
ed Soviet attempts to inspect
convoy.
Mackin, 27, from Washington,
D.C., fell into East German hands
last Dec. 3 after he became lost
while flying near the border and
parachuted when his small plane
ran out of gas. Three of the four
other soldiers disappeared in Ber
lin during November and Decem
ber last year and the fourth, five
days ago.
Robert Storey Wilson, Euro
pean director of the American
.Red Cross, arranged their release
with the East German Red Cross.
The United States declines to deal
with the East German regime,
which it does not recognize, and
maintains that the Soviet Union
is obligated under four-power
agreements to handle such cases.
Wilson told reporters he paid the
East German Red Cross 4500
marks $1071 "detention ex
penses" for the five.
