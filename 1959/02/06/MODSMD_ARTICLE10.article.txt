# Recordings Prove U.S. Plane Downed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) —'The United Stales expose 1 to tho world Thursday a secret recording of ex
cited, gloating voices it identified as those of Soviet jet fighter pilots shooting down a helpless U.S.
transport plane.
One bit, merciless and boasting, said: "Yes, he is falling, I will finish him off, boys, I will finish
him off on the run."
The graphic recording was made public by the State Department on the eve of the burial of two

victims of the plane crash. In all,
17 American airmen may have
died. Certainly six did.
It was last Sept. 2 that the un
armed CI 30 trans p or t was
downed, near the border between
Turkey and Soviet Armenia.
The craft was admittedly off
course and it crashed about 2.")
miles inside Armenia but there
was no question about it being a
transport, and there was a suspi
cion it may have been led astray
by Soviet radio signals.
Soviet Pilots
The tape recording purportedly
covers the operation of five So
viet fighter pilots from the begin
ning of a search for the transport
over Soviet territory until after
it was destroyed.
"The target is a transport, four
engine," one pilot cried, according
to a translation from the Russian
provided by the State Depart
ment.
"I am attacking the target . . .
"There's a hit . . .
"The target is burning, 582 the
number of one plane.
"The target banking . . .
"It is going toward the fence ...
"Open fire . . .
"The tail assembly is falling off
"The target has lost control, it
is going down."
Target Burns
On the way home, one of the
Russian voices bragged: "After
my third pass the target started
burning."
State Department officials re
fused to say how they came into
possession of the recording. Press
officer Lincoln White called it ab
solutely authentic as an account
of the assault.
The State Department also re
leased photographs and English
translations of two articles which
appeared in Soviet Aviation on
Sept. 19 and 20.
In these accounts some of the
fighter plane numbers were the
same as in the transcribed record
ing, although the combat de
scribed in the articles was pre
sented as a practice exercise with
cameras instead of guns.
Department officials said they
did not intend to give up in Iheir
efforts to find out what happened
to the other 11 of the 17 believed
to have been aboard the plane.
Bodies Identified
Four of the bodies could be
identified and they were turned
over to relatives last fall and
were buried in accord with their
families' wishes.
Two, unidentified, are to be
given burial with military honors
Friday in Arlington National
Cemetery. The timing of their
funeral was given as one of the
reasons for the release of the tape
recording.

him off on the run."
The graphic recording was made public by the State Department on the eve of the burial of two

victims of the plane crash. In all,
17 American airmen may have
died. Certainly six did.
It was last Sept. 2 that the un
armed CI 30 trans p or t was
downed, near the border between
Turkey and Soviet Armenia.
The craft was admittedly off
course and it crashed about 2.")
miles inside Armenia but there
was no question about it being a
transport, and there was a suspi
cion it may have been led astray
by Soviet radio signals.
Soviet Pilots
The tape recording purportedly
covers the operation of five So
viet fighter pilots from the begin
ning of a search for the transport
over Soviet territory until after
it was destroyed.
"The target is a transport, four
engine," one pilot cried, according
to a translation from the Russian
provided by the State Depart
ment.
"I am attacking the target . . .
"There's a hit . . .
"The target is burning, 582 the
number of one plane.
"The target banking . . .
"It is going toward the fence ...
"Open fire . . .
"The tail assembly is falling off
"The target has lost control, it
is going down."
Target Burns
On the way home, one of the
Russian voices bragged: "After
my third pass the target started
burning."
State Department officials re
fused to say how they came into
possession of the recording. Press
officer Lincoln White called it ab
solutely authentic as an account
of the assault.
The State Department also re
leased photographs and English
translations of two articles which
appeared in Soviet Aviation on
Sept. 19 and 20.
In these accounts some of the
fighter plane numbers were the
same as in the transcribed record
ing, although the combat de
scribed in the articles was pre
sented as a practice exercise with
cameras instead of guns.
Department officials said they
did not intend to give up in Iheir
efforts to find out what happened
to the other 11 of the 17 believed
to have been aboard the plane.
Bodies Identified
Four of the bodies could be
identified and they were turned
over to relatives last fall and
were buried in accord with their
families' wishes.
Two, unidentified, are to be
given burial with military honors
Friday in Arlington National
Cemetery. The timing of their
funeral was given as one of the
reasons for the release of the tape
recording.
