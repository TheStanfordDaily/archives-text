If the description given of the
academic market place of univer
sity faculties today is a true one,
the traditional image of the pro
fessor as an ivory-towered schol
ar, deep in thought over his books,
should be replaced by a picture of
a tense academician nervously
considering his chance for promo
tion and feverishly trying to pre
pare something anything for
publication.
Authors
The authors of "The Academic
Marketplace," Caplow and McGee,
sociologists from the Universities
of Minnesota and Texas respec
tively, present detailed results of
exhaustive research into the pro
fessional mobility of all full-time
faculty members at 10 m a jo r
American universities. These in
stitutions are never named, but
they are described sufficiently to
convince the reader that they are
indeed important centers of learn
ing, not remote teachers' colleges
or female seminaries with dubious
academic standards.
The authors set out to docu
ment the reasons why and the
processes by which university pro
fessors are hired, fired and pro
moted. The results are presented
in clear, readable English, notice
ably free from sociological jargon
and "educationese."
Promotion Because of Research
In general, the authors find that
while professors are hired princi
pally to teach, they are promoted
because of their accomplishments
in research and are especially val
ued for whatever' personal pres
tige they may achieve in the eyes
of the scholarly world. The au
thors and Jacques Barzun, who
wrote a crusading introduction
for the book, feel that these three
factors—teaching, research and
prestige—are independent varia
bles.
In all their mass of statistics,
the authors nowhere squarely face
the fact that the professors whom
they interviewed obviously affirm
an essential cause-and-effect rela
tionship between good research
and stimulating teaching. Fur
thermore, most professors seem
to assume some sort of mystical
relationship between published re
search and good teaching, on the
one hand, and prestige, on the
other.
This willingness to be essential
ly unfair to the basic presump
tions underlying the seemingly
foolish statements of the profes
sors is a real detraction from the
value of this study. The academic
profession looks sick enough
when one reads this book; there
is really no need for the authors
to make already shocking symp
toms appear to be the undeniable
earmarks of incurable malaise.
Rank Disillusionment
The cumulative effect of the re
ported interviews with professors
is rank dillusionment for anyone
who has somehow remained so
naive that he still thinks the aca
demic profession is wholly dedi
cated to the search for truth. One
professor told an interviewer: "1
am convinced, absolutely convinc
ed. that the unorthodox character
of this article lost him his job.
His heretical opinions—you know
how these people can get when
their pet dogmas are attacked."
The departed professor obvious
ly published, but his possible con
tribution to knowledge seems to

have been a good deal less impor
tant than his failure to salaam to
the status quo of professional
opinion. A departmental chair
man candidly characterized his re
quirements for a new faculty
member: "The biggest thing is
that other people think well of
him."
Nothing-Can-Shock-Me-Now
The authors supply page after
page of such quotations; the num
ber- is finally so great that the
reader is either- dulled into a state
of nothing-can-shock-me-now (and
Ac-ademica becomes, for him, a
land in Grimm's "Fairy Tales" or
a place where Gulliver might have
visited) or he becomes uncontrol
lably irate about the situation in
the university work-a-day world
and inaugurates a crusade.
Undoubtedly Caplow and Mc-
Gee point out many shocking real
ities, but their- presented results
can be misleading if searching ob
jectivity is not maintained by the
reader. The academic world is
governed to a large extent by de
partments of instruction. Yet only
once are significant findings brok
en down into results for individ
ual disciplines.
Would-Be Crusader
So it is hard for the would-be
crusader to know where to begin.
The emphasis on prestige may
seem universal, but all documen
tation may stem from three de
partments of anthropology. It is
upsetting to read of the professor
who was hired because he could
play the recorder. One presumes,
but is not told, that the depart
ment involved is not the Depart
ment of Music, Division of Per
forming Artists.
At other times the statistical
tabulations seem to be needlessly
and perhaps misleadingly com
plete. A table showing presumed
dissatisfaction of professors be
fore the termination of jobs re
cords the percentage of profes
sor's who were dissatisfied imme
diately before an untimely death.
Death is hardly a form of inter
institutional mobility, and, short
of death-by-departmental-pei'secu
tion. the dead are not. a meaning
ful category of dissatisfied acad
emicians.
Hook a Must
Despite the«e difficulties, this
book should go on the "must"
reading list for all persons con
nected with universities in this
country. For the undergraduate
a new world of horror not entirely
unlike the worlds of futuristic
novels will be opened. The gradu
ate student, especially one in the
liberal arts who seeks an academ
ic po-sition, can take this book
along as a guide to the job-getting
convention of his particular dis
cipline. The young instructor can
use this book as a pill to make
his nervous stomach even more
queasy.
Seasoned Professors
The seasoned professor can do
one of two things. He can dis
miss the book quickly and ner
vously, and mumble convulsively
something about how the authors
miss the point, fail to understand,
are basically anti-intellectual, etc.;
or he can give the book a pain
fully objective reading, analyze
what the real ailments of the aca
demic world are, and resolve on
the removal of whatever guilty
stains his own particular part of
this world may have acquired.
The academic world is a strange
social animal; while the inforrna
lion revealed in this significant
dissection may leave doubts in
some areas, one conclusion is in
escapable: if changes are to occur
in the academic market place they
must be conceived, initiated and
supported by the professors them
selves.
