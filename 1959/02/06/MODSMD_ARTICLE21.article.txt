## Mid-East Nationalism Threatens United Nations Internationalism 
### Lest or O'Shea 
It is rather ironical that these
days of the United Nations anc
its internationalism should alst
be a time in which nationalism
is rampant as seldom before. Nev
ertheless, over 25 new sovereign
nations since 1945, with more just
around the corner, seem ample in
dication of its present strength.
It is almost exclusively in
Africa and Asia that national
ism is having its day today. In
other words, it is having ils day
in Afro-Asian dress at the ex
pense of a declining Western
variety of the animal, whose in
ternational manifestation — co
lonialism —at present lies near
death.
Africans —Asians
Africans and Asians no longer
can think of giving allegiance to
a government not headed by Afri
cans or Asians. Perhaps they nev
er really could, but, at any rate,
Indian schoolchildren once sang
"God Save the King," and the
Maharajah of Jodhpur. leading
his troops in France in World
War 1 I, announced that he had
come to "die for my King." Such
inter-ethnic allegiance, whatever
its merits or - demerits, is quite
extinct today.
The rise of newly independ
ent states has been greeted with
general rejoicing in the United
States, at least among those
who are aware thai such is oc
curring. Asia has awakened;
Africa is gaining independence.
Is this not heart-warming?
Some may find it so; from a
practical point of view, how
ever, it is by no means particu
larly desirable.
Lack of Training
In the first place, it ought to be
realized that there is at present
a general absence of trained na
tives able to provide intelligent,
mature administration in at least
a large part of the Afro-Asian
area. Large numbers of the peo
ple extend, in their- culture, as far
back as the Stone Age, and the
vast majority are illiterate. They
may be presumed, hence, to be
somewhat less than adept at dem
ocratically electing capable gover
nors, even where they are avail

ible. And many of the leaders
,eem less than mature.

thoughtful slogan: "Europeans,

"keep their chains to chain up
all the Europeans with"; an
other, that all Europeans he
deported and replaced wit h
"American Negroes who have
technical know-how."

v'al base, rendering the surround
ing population unemployed; the
Indonesians cripple their econo
my by expropriating all Dutch
property.
Freedom-Loving
What the freedom-loving Af
ricans do with their lands, of
course, is more or less their
business. The difficulty is, how
ever, that their raw materials
are very useful to the West and
are not better produced (nor
are better markets and outlets
for investment provided) under
incompetent, immature govern
ment —which, for that matter,
is not the best safeguard
against Communism either.

There is an additional- and, in
the long run, perhaps more sig
nificant -problem: viz., there i*
some doubt that these newly in
dependent nations will ever be
able to see that their interests lie
in complete cooperation with
western Europe and tho United
States. This may in part be due
to their interests lying elsewhere
which would be natural enough
since they are different people
and live in a different country.
Obeisance
At any rate, thanks to national
ism and our obeisance to it, the
vast lands and resources of Af
rica arid Asia are, for the first
time in centuries, ceasing to be at
the disposal of the Occident.
These areas are not only develop
ing effective wills of their own,
hut, what is worse, wills which
are generally contrary to our
own. It is generally so much
easier to make decisions oneself
than to get someone else to make
identical ones.

Freedom-Loving
What the freedom-loving Af
ricans do with their lands, of
course, is more or less their
business. The difficulty is, how
ever, that their raw materials
are very useful to the West and
are not better produced (nor
are better markets and outlets
for investment provided) under
incompetent, immature govern
ment —which, for that matter,
is not the best safeguard
against Communism either.

There is an additional- and, in
the long run, perhaps more sig
nificant -problem: viz., there i*
some doubt that these newly in
dependent nations will ever be
able to see that their interests lie
in complete cooperation with
western Europe and tho United
States. This may in part be due
to their interests lying elsewhere
which would be natural enough
since they are different people
and live in a different country.
Obeisance
At any rate, thanks to national
ism and our obeisance to it, the
vast lands and resources of Af
rica arid Asia are, for the first
time in centuries, ceasing to be at
the disposal of the Occident.
These areas are not only develop
ing effective wills of their own,
hut, what is worse, wills which
are generally contrary to our
own. It is generally so much
easier to make decisions oneself
than to get someone else to make
identical ones.
It is rather ironical that these
days of the United Nations anc
its internationalism should alst
be a time in which nationalism
is rampant as seldom before. Nev
ertheless, over 25 new sovereign
nations since 1945, with more just
around the corner, seem ample in
dication of its present strength.
It is almost exclusively in
Africa and Asia that national
ism is having its day today. In
other words, it is having ils day
in Afro-Asian dress at the ex
pense of a declining Western
variety of the animal, whose in
ternational manifestation — co
lonialism —at present lies near
death.
Africans —Asians
Africans and Asians no longer
can think of giving allegiance to
a government not headed by Afri
cans or Asians. Perhaps they nev
er really could, but, at any rate,
Indian schoolchildren once sang
"God Save the King," and the
Maharajah of Jodhpur. leading
his troops in France in World
War 1 I, announced that he had
come to "die for my King." Such
inter-ethnic allegiance, whatever
its merits or - demerits, is quite
extinct today.
The rise of newly independ
ent states has been greeted with
general rejoicing in the United
States, at least among those
who are aware thai such is oc
curring. Asia has awakened;
Africa is gaining independence.
Is this not heart-warming?
Some may find it so; from a
practical point of view, how
ever, it is by no means particu
larly desirable.
Lack of Training
In the first place, it ought to be
realized that there is at present
a general absence of trained na
tives able to provide intelligent,
mature administration in at least
a large part of the Afro-Asian
area. Large numbers of the peo
ple extend, in their- culture, as far
back as the Stone Age, and the
vast majority are illiterate. They
may be presumed, hence, to be
somewhat less than adept at dem
ocratically electing capable gover
nors, even where they are avail

ible. And many of the leaders
,eem less than mature.

nations since 1945, with more just
around the corner, seem ample in
dication of its present strength.
It is almost exclusively in
Africa and Asia that national
ism is having its day today. In
other words, it is having ils day
in Afro-Asian dress at the ex
pense of a declining Western
variety of the animal, whose in
ternational manifestation — co
lonialism —at present lies near
death.
Africans —Asians
Africans and Asians no longer
can think of giving allegiance to
a government not headed by Afri
cans or Asians. Perhaps they nev
er really could, but, at any rate,
Indian schoolchildren once sang
"God Save the King," and the
Maharajah of Jodhpur. leading
his troops in France in World
War 1 I, announced that he had
come to "die for my King." Such
inter-ethnic allegiance, whatever
its merits or - demerits, is quite
extinct today.
The rise of newly independ
ent states has been greeted with
general rejoicing in the United
States, at least among those
who are aware thai such is oc
curring. Asia has awakened;
Africa is gaining independence.
Is this not heart-warming?
Some may find it so; from a
practical point of view, how
ever, it is by no means particu
larly desirable.
Lack of Training
In the first place, it ought to be
realized that there is at present
a general absence of trained na
tives able to provide intelligent,
mature administration in at least
a large part of the Afro-Asian
area. Large numbers of the peo
ple extend, in their- culture, as far
back as the Stone Age, and the
vast majority are illiterate. They
may be presumed, hence, to be
somewhat less than adept at dem
ocratically electing capable gover
nors, even where they are avail

ible. And many of the leaders
,eem less than mature.

Freedom-Loving
What the freedom-loving Af
ricans do with their lands, of
course, is more or less their
business. The difficulty is, how
ever, that their raw materials
are very useful to the West and
are not better produced (nor
are better markets and outlets
for investment provided) under
incompetent, immature govern
ment —which, for that matter,
is not the best safeguard
against Communism either.

There is an additional- and, in
the long run, perhaps more sig
nificant -problem: viz., there i*
some doubt that these newly in
dependent nations will ever be
able to see that their interests lie
in complete cooperation with
western Europe and tho United
States. This may in part be due
to their interests lying elsewhere
which would be natural enough
since they are different people
and live in a different country.
Obeisance
At any rate, thanks to national
ism and our obeisance to it, the
vast lands and resources of Af
rica arid Asia are, for the first
time in centuries, ceasing to be at
the disposal of the Occident.
These areas are not only develop
ing effective wills of their own,
hut, what is worse, wills which
are generally contrary to our
own. It is generally so much
easier to make decisions oneself
than to get someone else to make
identical ones.
It is rather ironical that these
days of the United Nations anc
its internationalism should alst
be a time in which nationalism
is rampant as seldom before. Nev
ertheless, over 25 new sovereign
nations since 1945, with more just
around the corner, seem ample in
