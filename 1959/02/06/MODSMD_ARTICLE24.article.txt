# Need Guidance?

### Bob Frank 
The Counseling and Testing
Center has an imporlanl part in
the educational program at Stan
ford: ils purpose is to help the
student understand himself, his
talents and interests, well enough
to decide how he will use his edu
cation.
Individual help is given to be
tween 1200 and 1500 Stanford stu
dents in each academic year by
the Center.
Three main functions of the
Counseling Center are vocational
guidance, personal counseling and
the developmental reading pro
gram.
A great number of students vis
iting the Counseling Center want
to decide on their' majors, or the
vocation they will pursue.
Personal Problems
Many students come to the Cen
ter with personal problems wor
ried about social or emotional ad
justment. The counselor does not
give advice or solve the student's
problem for him; he tries to con
tribute to the student's maturity
and independence so he can meet
the demands of future decisions.
Several groups of students are
currently trying to improve their
study habits, their vocabularies,
and their speed and comprehen
sion in reading under the guid
ance of the Counseling Center.
Reading Groups
All classes are represented in
the study groups, from freshmen
through graduates. The average
reading skill of the groups is high
er than the all-University average
even before they begin to im
prove it.
The Testing Service also hires
out its services to local industry
for much the same purposes. This
gives the counselors an opportu
nity to keep up on the job oppor
tunities and types of vocations in
industry, as further background
for their counseling of students.
Sponsors and resident assist
ants are given instruction in
counseling techniques and psy
chological principles by the Cen
ter so that they will be better

able to cope with problems before
they become too serious.
Vocational Guidance
The current procedure of the
Counseling Center is to give two
tests to the student seeking voca
tional guidance before he i-s inter
viewed an interest test and a
personality test.
When the tests have been scor
ed, the student discusses the re
sults with orre of the Center's
eight counselors. All eight are
well qualified, with training in
psychology or educational guid
ance. Those who don't have their
Ph.D.'s have the equivalent in
training and experience.
The counselor and the student
then decide what other tests
might best help the student un
derstand himself. Between 300
and 400 different tests are avail
able, although some are very sel
dom given the average client
takes a total of four to six tests.
General Areas
Tests given by the Counseling
and Testing Center come in five
general areas: general interests,
aptitudes, personality, special ap
titudes, and achievement.
The need for personal counsel
ing has not lessened wilh Stan
ford's rising admission standards.
Most come with normal psycho
logical problems of adolescence,
or anxiety caused by the more in
tense environmental pressures ;it
college.
Few Severely Disturbed
Very few who seek personal
counseling are severely disturbed.
As with vocational guidance,
interviews continue as long as
necessary. In some cases the Cen
ter may help a client find psy
chiatric.' care elsewhere, or may
charge a nominal fee per inter
view if many interview hours be
come necessary.
The services described above
are open to all, although Stanford
students and those with Stanford
connections are the focus of ac
tivities. Alumni, children of fac
ulty members, or other children
from this area may pay $50 for
a typical series of testing and in
terviews.
