# Chappie Uses Scores to Perpetuate Daily Feud
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
"We have a contemporary on
campus which we are proud to
hail. The Chaparral has seemed
to us always a noble example in
the field of college comicalness.
"It is different from the gen
erality of collegiate magazines,
most of which are as alike as two
peas—or two garbage cans. It re
flects Stanford more accurately
than other comics reflect their
colleges. It is not too proud to be
provincial, but it is careful about
the sort of jokes it uses."
The above appeared in an edi
torial which found its way into
the Nov. 22, 1928, issue of The
Daily. How times have changed!
Chappie-Daily feuds have some
times been serious, as was noticed
in an issue last quarter, but usu
ally the feuds are in a friendly
manner.
When the Chappie's offices
were on the second floor of the
Journalism building, the Chappies
perpetually used to flood the Daily
shack out, using either missiles
such as water bags or, occasion
ally, fire hoses.
Recently, the Chappies contend,
the main point of disagreement
between the two publications has
been"the utterly unsportsman
like policy of The Daily to refuse
to print the scores of Daily-Chap
pie football games."
26 6 or 6 26
According to them, in 3955 The
Daily printed an article about the
outcome of the game but reversed
the score. They insist that the
Chappie had squeezed by The
Daily for a 26-6 score, and an ar
ticle appeared giving "an absolute
baldfaced lie about the outcome."
Next year The Daily made an
effort to appease Chappie mem
bers by printing the score of the
1956 game, in correct order: Daily
8. Chappie 7. (The Daily always
wins in one way or another.)
Hammer and Coffin
The Chappie is owned and run
by members of the illustrious
Hammer and C of 112 in Society,
which was born on the eve of the
earthquake of '06. That night nine
of the Chappies gathered in Char
lie Meyer's pub in Menlo Park.
Disgruntled over the supervi
sion and, they felt, unwarranted
interference of the Press Club,
Old Boy Morrie Oppenheim ut
tered the words to be ingrained in
every Chappie heart: "We oughta
sock 'em with a hammer, toss 'em
in a coffin and seal 'em away."
Credit for the idea of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society, however,
must go to another. In 1905, Swig
Reynolds conceived the idea of a
society, thought up the name
"Hammer and Coffin" and went
up to the city to have a 10-pound
sledge hammer silver-plated.
The society still keeps the origi
nal sledge and coffin, and each
year a silver ring bearing the
names of the magazine staff is
added to the handle of the sledge.
Three handles have been covered,
and a fourth is in the process.
Claims to Fame
Chappies have claimed fame in
one way or another. Among their
Hall of Fame they include the
first man to jump into the foun
tain in Union Court fully dressed
(Henry Mack in 1924), the man
who named the campanile "The
Musical Silo" (Bill Wright, 3925),
the first man to attend the Mili
tary Ball in a Boy Scout uniform
(Noel de Nevers, 1953), the first
man to slide down the fire pole in
Union Square in full evening dress
while singing "The Marseillaise"
(Tom Timbcrlake, 1953), and, for
reasons of their own, Goodwin
Knight. Bruce Bliven, Doodles!

Weaver, Bill Irwin and Herbert
Hoover Jr.
Aside from some of the more
inane campaigns, the Chappie has
done a few useful things. They
campaigned for the present Stu
dent Union building, for liberal
ized women's social regulations
(and drew up the first proposal
for the late-leave system), for re
turn to American football from
rugby, and for the building of a
football stadium on the present
site. One of the Old Boys even led
a campaign to keep America out
of World War I.
Their greatest campaign was
for the present Memorial Audi
torium. The University had left
over from World War I a memo
rial fund of considerable size that
wasn't earmarked for any specific
purpose. The Chappies first sug
gested that this fund be used for
building a theater, and contrib
ued $5000 for that purpose.

The Chappie has had its tense
moments, too. In 1956 the April
publication was to be the 50th an
niversary issue and to contain the
history of their publication. The
usual schedule of obtaining and
reading proofs went smoothly, but
Hammer and Coffin pledges de
cided to pull a trick.
On the way from the University
Press, the pledges hijacked the
entire issue and kidnaped Belton
Flischer, who was the circulation
manager. Flischer was chained in
a stock and deposited in front of
the Daily shack.
The Daily business manager
appeared on the scene, but not
soon enough to prevent the pledg
es from absconding with the mag
azines, which appeared on the
newsstands a day late—for the
first time in their history, the
Chappies say.
Last spring the Chappie again
appeared on the stands late. Re

production copy for "Sports Frus
trated" was stolen from the Chap
pie office by a person or persons
still unknown. Other copy was
obtained, however, and the maga
zine came out on the following
Wednesday.
The Chappie has accumulated
its share of publication awards

too. The National Parody Award j
has gone to the staff every year |
since 1954, when the "Saturday!
Evening Pile" came out. In 1955
On the way from the University j
"Lurk" took the award, as did i
"LI E" (1956), "Hodilay" (1957)

and last year's "Sports Frustrat-|
ed." The Chappies claim that'
Sports Illustrated magazine liked
their parody so much that they
ordered 500 copies of the issue.
Underlying the sometimes per-[
verse, sometimes diligent attitude

of the staff in the little shack
across the street is the motto ex
pressed by an Old Boy in a mo
rn en t of philosophical wishful
thinking: "College presidents
come and college presidents go,
but the Old Boy lives on forever!"

usual schedule of obtaining and
reading proofs went smoothly, but
Hammer and Coffin pledges de
cided to pull a trick.
On the way from the University
Press, the pledges hijacked the
entire issue and kidnaped Belton
Flischer, who was the circulation
manager. Flischer was chained in
a stock and deposited in front of
the Daily shack.
The Daily business manager
appeared on the scene, but not
soon enough to prevent the pledg
es from absconding with the mag
azines, which appeared on the
newsstands a day late—for the
first time in their history, the
Chappies say.
Last spring the Chappie again
appeared on the stands late. Re

production copy for "Sports Frus
trated" was stolen from the Chap
pie office by a person or persons
still unknown. Other copy was
obtained, however, and the maga
zine came out on the following
Wednesday.
The Chappie has accumulated
its share of publication awards

too. The National Parody Award j
has gone to the staff every year |
since 1954, when the "Saturday!
Evening Pile" came out. In 1955
On the way from the University j
"Lurk" took the award, as did i
"LI E" (1956), "Hodilay" (1957)

and last year's "Sports Frustrat-|
ed." The Chappies claim that'
Sports Illustrated magazine liked
their parody so much that they
ordered 500 copies of the issue.
Underlying the sometimes per-[
verse, sometimes diligent attitude

of the staff in the little shack
across the street is the motto ex
pressed by an Old Boy in a mo
rn en t of philosophical wishful
thinking: "College presidents
come and college presidents go,
but the Old Boy lives on forever!"


CHAPARRAL STAFF MEMBERS ADMIRE THE DAILY
Ray Funkhouser and Bob d'Alessio pay thier homage (?)
"We have a contemporary on
campus which we are proud to
hail. The Chaparral has seemed
to us always a noble example in
the field of college comicalness.
"It is different from the gen
erality of collegiate magazines,
most of which are as alike as two
peas—or two garbage cans. It re
flects Stanford more accurately
than other comics reflect their
colleges. It is not too proud to be
provincial, but it is careful about
the sort of jokes it uses."
The above appeared in an edi
torial which found its way into
the Nov. 22, 1928, issue of The
Daily. How times have changed!
Chappie-Daily feuds have some
times been serious, as was noticed
in an issue last quarter, but usu
ally the feuds are in a friendly
manner.
When the Chappie's offices
were on the second floor of the
Journalism building, the Chappies
perpetually used to flood the Daily
shack out, using either missiles
such as water bags or, occasion
ally, fire hoses.
Recently, the Chappies contend,
the main point of disagreement
between the two publications has
been"the utterly unsportsman
like policy of The Daily to refuse
to print the scores of Daily-Chap
pie football games."
26 6 or 6 26
According to them, in 3955 The
Daily printed an article about the
outcome of the game but reversed
the score. They insist that the
Chappie had squeezed by The
Daily for a 26-6 score, and an ar
ticle appeared giving "an absolute
baldfaced lie about the outcome."
Next year The Daily made an
effort to appease Chappie mem
bers by printing the score of the
1956 game, in correct order: Daily
8. Chappie 7. (The Daily always
wins in one way or another.)
Hammer and Coffin
The Chappie is owned and run
by members of the illustrious
Hammer and C of 112 in Society,
which was born on the eve of the
earthquake of '06. That night nine
of the Chappies gathered in Char
lie Meyer's pub in Menlo Park.
Disgruntled over the supervi
sion and, they felt, unwarranted
interference of the Press Club,
Old Boy Morrie Oppenheim ut
tered the words to be ingrained in
every Chappie heart: "We oughta
sock 'em with a hammer, toss 'em
in a coffin and seal 'em away."
Credit for the idea of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society, however,
must go to another. In 1905, Swig
Reynolds conceived the idea of a
society, thought up the name
"Hammer and Coffin" and went
up to the city to have a 10-pound
sledge hammer silver-plated.
The society still keeps the origi
nal sledge and coffin, and each
year a silver ring bearing the
names of the magazine staff is
added to the handle of the sledge.
Three handles have been covered,
and a fourth is in the process.
Claims to Fame
Chappies have claimed fame in
one way or another. Among their
Hall of Fame they include the
first man to jump into the foun
tain in Union Court fully dressed
(Henry Mack in 1924), the man
who named the campanile "The
Musical Silo" (Bill Wright, 3925),
the first man to attend the Mili
tary Ball in a Boy Scout uniform
(Noel de Nevers, 1953), the first
man to slide down the fire pole in
Union Square in full evening dress
while singing "The Marseillaise"
(Tom Timbcrlake, 1953), and, for
reasons of their own, Goodwin
Knight. Bruce Bliven, Doodles!

Weaver, Bill Irwin and Herbert
Hoover Jr.
Aside from some of the more
inane campaigns, the Chappie has
done a few useful things. They
campaigned for the present Stu
dent Union building, for liberal
ized women's social regulations
(and drew up the first proposal
for the late-leave system), for re
turn to American football from
rugby, and for the building of a
football stadium on the present
site. One of the Old Boys even led
a campaign to keep America out
of World War I.
Their greatest campaign was
for the present Memorial Audi
torium. The University had left
over from World War I a memo
rial fund of considerable size that
wasn't earmarked for any specific
purpose. The Chappies first sug
gested that this fund be used for
building a theater, and contrib
ued $5000 for that purpose.

The Chappie has had its tense
moments, too. In 1956 the April
publication was to be the 50th an
niversary issue and to contain the
history of their publication. The
usual schedule of obtaining and
reading proofs went smoothly, but
Hammer and Coffin pledges de
cided to pull a trick.

Claims to Fame
Chappies have claimed fame in
one way or another. Among their
Hall of Fame they include the
first man to jump into the foun
tain in Union Court fully dressed
(Henry Mack in 1924), the man
who named the campanile "The
Musical Silo" (Bill Wright, 3925),
the first man to attend the Mili
tary Ball in a Boy Scout uniform
(Noel de Nevers, 1953), the first
man to slide down the fire pole in
Union Square in full evening dress
while singing "The Marseillaise"
(Tom Timbcrlake, 1953), and, for
reasons of their own, Goodwin
Knight. Bruce Bliven, Doodles!

Weaver, Bill Irwin and Herbert
Hoover Jr.
Aside from some of the more
inane campaigns, the Chappie has
done a few useful things. They
campaigned for the present Stu
dent Union building, for liberal
ized women's social regulations
(and drew up the first proposal
for the late-leave system), for re
turn to American football from
rugby, and for the building of a
football stadium on the present
site. One of the Old Boys even led
a campaign to keep America out
of World War I.
Their greatest campaign was
for the present Memorial Audi
torium. The University had left
over from World War I a memo
rial fund of considerable size that
wasn't earmarked for any specific
purpose. The Chappies first sug
gested that this fund be used for
building a theater, and contrib
ued $5000 for that purpose.

The Chappie has had its tense
moments, too. In 1956 the April
publication was to be the 50th an
niversary issue and to contain the
history of their publication. The
usual schedule of obtaining and
reading proofs went smoothly, but
Hammer and Coffin pledges de
cided to pull a trick.
On the way from the University
Press, the pledges hijacked the
entire issue and kidnaped Belton
Flischer, who was the circulation
manager. Flischer was chained in
a stock and deposited in front of
the Daily shack.
The Daily business manager
appeared on the scene, but not
soon enough to prevent the pledg
es from absconding with the mag
azines, which appeared on the
newsstands a day late—for the
first time in their history, the
Chappies say.
Last spring the Chappie again
appeared on the stands late. Re

production copy for "Sports Frus
trated" was stolen from the Chap
pie office by a person or persons
still unknown. Other copy was
obtained, however, and the maga
zine came out on the following
Wednesday.
The Chappie has accumulated
its share of publication awards

too. The National Parody Award j
has gone to the staff every year |
since 1954, when the "Saturday!
Evening Pile" came out. In 1955
On the way from the University j
"Lurk" took the award, as did i
"LI E" (1956), "Hodilay" (1957)

and last year's "Sports Frustrat-|
ed." The Chappies claim that'
Sports Illustrated magazine liked
their parody so much that they
ordered 500 copies of the issue.
Underlying the sometimes per-[
verse, sometimes diligent attitude

of the staff in the little shack
across the street is the motto ex
pressed by an Old Boy in a mo
rn en t of philosophical wishful
thinking: "College presidents
come and college presidents go,
but the Old Boy lives on forever!"


CHAPARRAL STAFF MEMBERS ADMIRE THE DAILY
Ray Funkhouser and Bob d'Alessio pay thier homage (?)
"We have a contemporary on
campus which we are proud to
hail. The Chaparral has seemed
to us always a noble example in
the field of college comicalness.
"It is different from the gen
erality of collegiate magazines,
most of which are as alike as two
peas—or two garbage cans. It re
flects Stanford more accurately
than other comics reflect their
colleges. It is not too proud to be
provincial, but it is careful about
the sort of jokes it uses."
The above appeared in an edi
torial which found its way into
the Nov. 22, 1928, issue of The
Daily. How times have changed!
Chappie-Daily feuds have some
times been serious, as was noticed
in an issue last quarter, but usu
ally the feuds are in a friendly
manner.
When the Chappie's offices
were on the second floor of the
Journalism building, the Chappies
perpetually used to flood the Daily
shack out, using either missiles
such as water bags or, occasion
ally, fire hoses.
Recently, the Chappies contend,
the main point of disagreement
between the two publications has
been"the utterly unsportsman
like policy of The Daily to refuse
to print the scores of Daily-Chap
pie football games."
26 6 or 6 26
According to them, in 3955 The
Daily printed an article about the
outcome of the game but reversed
the score. They insist that the
Chappie had squeezed by The
Daily for a 26-6 score, and an ar
ticle appeared giving "an absolute
baldfaced lie about the outcome."
Next year The Daily made an
effort to appease Chappie mem
bers by printing the score of the
1956 game, in correct order: Daily
8. Chappie 7. (The Daily always
wins in one way or another.)
Hammer and Coffin
The Chappie is owned and run
by members of the illustrious
Hammer and C of 112 in Society,
which was born on the eve of the
earthquake of '06. That night nine
of the Chappies gathered in Char
lie Meyer's pub in Menlo Park.
Disgruntled over the supervi
sion and, they felt, unwarranted
interference of the Press Club,
Old Boy Morrie Oppenheim ut
tered the words to be ingrained in
every Chappie heart: "We oughta
sock 'em with a hammer, toss 'em
in a coffin and seal 'em away."
Credit for the idea of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society, however,
must go to another. In 1905, Swig
Reynolds conceived the idea of a
society, thought up the name
"Hammer and Coffin" and went
up to the city to have a 10-pound
sledge hammer silver-plated.
The society still keeps the origi
nal sledge and coffin, and each
year a silver ring bearing the
names of the magazine staff is
added to the handle of the sledge.

the main point of disagreement
between the two publications has
been"the utterly unsportsman
like policy of The Daily to refuse
to print the scores of Daily-Chap
pie football games."
26 6 or 6 26
According to them, in 3955 The
Daily printed an article about the
outcome of the game but reversed
the score. They insist that the
Chappie had squeezed by The
Daily for a 26-6 score, and an ar
ticle appeared giving "an absolute
baldfaced lie about the outcome."
Next year The Daily made an
effort to appease Chappie mem
bers by printing the score of the
1956 game, in correct order: Daily
8. Chappie 7. (The Daily always
wins in one way or another.)
Hammer and Coffin
The Chappie is owned and run
by members of the illustrious
Hammer and C of 112 in Society,
which was born on the eve of the
earthquake of '06. That night nine
of the Chappies gathered in Char
lie Meyer's pub in Menlo Park.
Disgruntled over the supervi
sion and, they felt, unwarranted
interference of the Press Club,
Old Boy Morrie Oppenheim ut
tered the words to be ingrained in
every Chappie heart: "We oughta
sock 'em with a hammer, toss 'em
in a coffin and seal 'em away."
Credit for the idea of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society, however,
must go to another. In 1905, Swig
Reynolds conceived the idea of a
society, thought up the name
"Hammer and Coffin" and went
up to the city to have a 10-pound
sledge hammer silver-plated.
The society still keeps the origi
nal sledge and coffin, and each
year a silver ring bearing the
names of the magazine staff is
added to the handle of the sledge.
Three handles have been covered,
and a fourth is in the process.
Claims to Fame
Chappies have claimed fame in
one way or another. Among their
Hall of Fame they include the
first man to jump into the foun
tain in Union Court fully dressed
(Henry Mack in 1924), the man
who named the campanile "The
Musical Silo" (Bill Wright, 3925),
the first man to attend the Mili
tary Ball in a Boy Scout uniform
(Noel de Nevers, 1953), the first
man to slide down the fire pole in
Union Square in full evening dress
while singing "The Marseillaise"
(Tom Timbcrlake, 1953), and, for
reasons of their own, Goodwin
Knight. Bruce Bliven, Doodles!

Weaver, Bill Irwin and Herbert
Hoover Jr.
Aside from some of the more
inane campaigns, the Chappie has
done a few useful things. They
campaigned for the present Stu
dent Union building, for liberal
ized women's social regulations
(and drew up the first proposal
for the late-leave system), for re
turn to American football from
rugby, and for the building of a
football stadium on the present
site. One of the Old Boys even led
a campaign to keep America out
of World War I.
Their greatest campaign was
for the present Memorial Audi
torium. The University had left
over from World War I a memo
rial fund of considerable size that
wasn't earmarked for any specific
purpose. The Chappies first sug
gested that this fund be used for
building a theater, and contrib
ued $5000 for that purpose.

The Chappie has had its tense
moments, too. In 1956 the April
publication was to be the 50th an
niversary issue and to contain the
history of their publication. The
usual schedule of obtaining and
reading proofs went smoothly, but
Hammer and Coffin pledges de
cided to pull a trick.
On the way from the University
Press, the pledges hijacked the
entire issue and kidnaped Belton
Flischer, who was the circulation
manager. Flischer was chained in
a stock and deposited in front of
the Daily shack.
The Daily business manager
appeared on the scene, but not
soon enough to prevent the pledg
es from absconding with the mag
azines, which appeared on the
newsstands a day late—for the
first time in their history, the
Chappies say.
Last spring the Chappie again
appeared on the stands late. Re

production copy for "Sports Frus
trated" was stolen from the Chap
pie office by a person or persons
still unknown. Other copy was
obtained, however, and the maga
zine came out on the following
Wednesday.
The Chappie has accumulated
its share of publication awards

too. The National Parody Award j
has gone to the staff every year |
since 1954, when the "Saturday!
Evening Pile" came out. In 1955
On the way from the University j
"Lurk" took the award, as did i
"LI E" (1956), "Hodilay" (1957)

and last year's "Sports Frustrat-|
ed." The Chappies claim that'
Sports Illustrated magazine liked
their parody so much that they
ordered 500 copies of the issue.
Underlying the sometimes per-[
verse, sometimes diligent attitude

of the staff in the little shack
across the street is the motto ex
pressed by an Old Boy in a mo
rn en t of philosophical wishful
thinking: "College presidents
come and college presidents go,
but the Old Boy lives on forever!"


CHAPARRAL STAFF MEMBERS ADMIRE THE DAILY
Ray Funkhouser and Bob d'Alessio pay thier homage (?)
"We have a contemporary on
campus which we are proud to
hail. The Chaparral has seemed
to us always a noble example in
the field of college comicalness.
"It is different from the gen
erality of collegiate magazines,
most of which are as alike as two
peas—or two garbage cans. It re
flects Stanford more accurately
than other comics reflect their
colleges. It is not too proud to be
provincial, but it is careful about
the sort of jokes it uses."
The above appeared in an edi
torial which found its way into
the Nov. 22, 1928, issue of The
Daily. How times have changed!
Chappie-Daily feuds have some
times been serious, as was noticed
in an issue last quarter, but usu
ally the feuds are in a friendly
manner.
When the Chappie's offices
were on the second floor of the
Journalism building, the Chappies
perpetually used to flood the Daily
shack out, using either missiles
such as water bags or, occasion
ally, fire hoses.
