# Airmen Meet Card Matmen
## 
### 
Stanford's matmen will take on
the Airmen from Moffett Field to
night at 7 in the Eneina Gym. The
Airmen are an unknown outfit,
but should provide good experi
ence for the young and inexpe
rienced Indian wrestlers.
Led by heavyweight Art Spie
gel, the Cards will carry a 1-2 rec
ord into tonight's competition.
The one win of the season for the
Stanfordites was against San
Francisco State, while losing to
Cal Poly and San Jose State.
The Indians thus far have been
plagued with lack of men in the
130- and 137-pound divisions and
also by the aforementioned inex
perience. Coach Jack McKenna,
however is quite pleased with the
showing the team has made so
far and is very hopeful of a win
against the Fly-Boys.
