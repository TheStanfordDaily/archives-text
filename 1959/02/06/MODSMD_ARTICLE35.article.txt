Quite a Lineup
Tho Stanford spoils picture isn't entirely blank this weekend
in fact, there will be very big happenings in the baseball world on
this campus tomorrow. The occasion, of course, is the annual Stan
fonl Baseball Clinic; and if it's big names in baseball you want, this
lineup has them.
Once again Card diamond coach YV. I*, (hutch) Fehriiig has as
sembled a great lineup of baseball personalities to take part in the
clinic . . . from the American League's Most Valuable Player to the
retired dean of National League umpires. Last year 550 Northern
California baseball coaches and enthusiasts assembled on the Farm
to hear Kill Rigney and his San Francises Giant contingent, and
there'll be hundreds more here tomorrow.
it's a pretty good way to "officially" kick off the baseball season.
Seems like the World Series just ended, but Fehring and assistant

Mickey Ilolzman have been work
ing the Stanford baseballers all
year and now the opening game
of the season looms but two
weeks away.
For the area's coaches it will
be a good opportunity to hear
the best in the business before
taking the wraps off a new sea
son for their respective junior
college, high school and little
league teams. Most coaching
clinics for any sport are to be
held during the summer, and this
is a little late for baseball to be
getting started.
I doubt if there are many one-*
day clinics of Stanford's sort that
can match the staff that Fell ring
will assemble tomorrow. Mead
liner - of the affair is Jackie Jen
sen, the former California All-
American who reached his major
league peak last season with the
Huston Red Sox and was elected
the Most Valuable Player in the
American League. Honors just
don't come much bigger. Jackie

will instruct in the arts of hitting, a department where ho had few
peers in the majors last season, and outfield play.
Then there is Babe rinelli, who has behind him Hi years in the
major and minor leagues as ;i player and, more recently, 22 years and
'1100 games as an umpire in the National league.
To Hear Them Talk Is Kuongh
The catching department will he well manned with Muddy Ruel,
who has been in organized baseball for 44 years. Those 44 years in
clude 20 in the major leagues, mostly with the Washington Senators.
Ruel was the catcher for a pretty fair country pitcher in his day . . .
a fellow named Walter Johnson, greatest of them all.
Dolph Camilli, who used to lose baseballs over fences and play
first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies, will
instruct in the ait of first base play. Camilli now is the Pacific
Northwest scout: of the Phillies.
Chief West ( oast scolds for two major league teams are also on
the staff. The Pittsburgh Pirates' Boh Fontaine will instruct in
pitching, while Roy Johnson of I lie Chicago Cubs with 19 years
experience as a coach for the Cubs will instruct in the departments
of base coaching and infield play.
Just an afternoon around a table with that lineup would be in
itself an education in baseball. Pinclli might have the most stories
to tell for instance, one that undoubtedly would be the greatest
thrill for any umpire . . . and it came in the last game that Pinelli
ever' called from behind the plate in the majors.
That one came in the World Series of 1956, and Pinclli was behind
the plate when the New York Yankees' Don Larsen threw the only
perfect game in World Series history. Pinclli called all 97 pitches
of it right down to the third strike that pinch hitter Dale Mitchell
watched go by to end one of the great moments in sports history.
Mv Kingdom for a Pitcher
What about the Card baseball squads? Fortunes were given a
jolt, naturally, when big Bob Leopold dropped out of school to pursue
the play-for-pay type of game. Leopold's absence will leave a big hole
in the Indian pitching staff—and also to be .sorely missed will be
All American catcher Ralph Holding and three-year second baseman
A1 Shaw. Both signed after lasl season with the Chicago Cubs.
Nevertheless, Fehring should field a sound ball club, based on
the fine hitting of such veterans as Joel Newkirk, Ben Robinson, Jim
Burk and Rich DcFabio. Although fellows like Holding just don't
come along every day, the catching department looks outstanding,
with senior Art Von YVronski, junior Jay Winter and sophomore Mike
Ma gee.
But now for pitching. Fehring thinks he may have a prospect
in left hander Jim Cowart, a transfer from Los Angeles City College.
Veterans John Gillis, Warren Nelson, Roy Lawson and Joel Mogy
are going to have to carry a burden—-along with sophomores Terry
Lindcmann, Earl Russell, Dave Carter and John Hitrlbut.
Stanford has had some great pitchers in the past, and Stanford
has lost some great ones. Leopold is the most recent one lhat got
away. Not too long ago, Steve Watson, a right-hander of great prom
ise, signed with the Cincinnati Redlegs after one season as a Card.
This year's Indians may have their troubles around second base,
although Fehring has indicated he may shift last year's third sacker,
Burk, over 1o shortstop and install one of the catchers at third.
But in Ihe overall picture, the inexperienced pitching staff may
hurt badly. Southern California is ineligible for NCAA champion
ships, but. unfortunately, Ihe Trojans are still in the conference.
And with pretty much the same ball club as last year's national
champs, with a few exceptions. Notably, center fielder Ron Fairley,
who signed with the Dodgers for something like $90,000. Poor kid.
