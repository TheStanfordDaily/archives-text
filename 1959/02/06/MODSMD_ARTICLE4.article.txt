# Festival Information Uncertain
## 
### 
Information regarding the
World Youth Festival to be hold
in Vienna next summer is pres
ently in a state of some uncer
tainty.
Some time ago The Daily re
ceived information on this festi
val a known Communist-front
activity sponsored since World
War II by two prominent Com
munist groups: the World Federa
tion of Democratic Youth and the
International Union of Students.
This information came from the
American Youth Festival Organi
zation, with headquarters in Chi
cago. This group is attempting to
interest American students in this
year's World Youth Festival, to be
held for the first time in the free
world in the hope that representa
tive students of the free world
might make some impact on the
festival's Communist propaganda.
American (Jroups
The American Youth Festival
Organization claims to be coun
tering the efforts of the U.S. Fes
tival Committee, New York, to re
cruit an "American delegation" to
the Youth Festival. The Now York
group is a known subsidiary of
the WFDY and the I US.
Professor James Wat kins and
dean of foreign students Werner
Warmbrunn have received a warn
ing concerning misleading infor
mation that the U.S. Festival Com
mittee sends to university stu
dents. The warning came from a
Cambridge, Mass., group the In
dependent Service for Information
on the Vienna Youth Festival.
Warmbrunn called the Independ
ent Service a reputable group,
â€¢stating he was acquainted with
some of its members.
Need Information
Neither The Daily nor the lIR
has received information from the
U.S. Festival Committee. The
Daily's information came from
the allegedly "free world student
group" the American Youth Fes
tival Organizat ion.
Their good faith has not been
def ! nitely established, but the IIR
is planning to write them imme
diately for more information.
If the AYFO proves genuinely
interested in providing an oppor
tunity for Western students to
present their case in Vienna next
summer, Warmbrunn suggested
that it might be a challenging op
port unity.
