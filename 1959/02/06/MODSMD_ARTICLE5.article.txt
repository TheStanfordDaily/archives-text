# RESIGNATION
## Pub Rel Director Position Vacant 
### 
Applications are now being taken for director of Public Relations.
The position was vacated last week by Richard O'Brien.
The appointment of a new director will be made by Student Body
President John Bohn with the consent of O'Brien. Applications may
be picked up at the ASSU office.
O'Br ien tendered his resignation Jan. 30 because of academic pres

sure, insufficient time because of
a job, and possible graduation at
the end of the quarter.
"I feel that a smooth transition
can be made to competent person-

nel who have
been thoroughly
trained," O'Brien
said. "I plan to
remain with the
staff until .such
lime as I feel
such a transition
has been made.
Th e commis
sion has charge
of the communi
cation between
student organi
zations and the

student body at large.
It is considering the weekly
publication of a fact sheet which
would cover forthcoming weekly
events. It would be distributed to
all house presidents and be post
ed after house meetings, accord
ing to O'Brien.
"Poor communication within
I ho commission has caused some
confusion concerning the work
loads," O'Brien said. "This situa
tion is rapidly being corrected.
"The work is menial and mo
notonous, and in order to main
tain morale and still put out a
large volume of work, we are ( 1 >
shifting assignments twice a
quarter and (2) promoting people
from the commissions to one of
the five directorships whenever
possible."
O'Brien commented that the
commission has been turning out
nearly five times as much mate
rial as it has in the past few
years. Last quarter it printed ap
proximately 30 sets of posters, in
cluding a three-color poster for
Gaieties.
