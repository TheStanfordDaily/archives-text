# Ike Asks Firm Race Laws
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) President
Eisenhower asked a divided Con
gress Thursday to make it a fed
eral crime to use force or mob
violence to block racial integra
tion of schools under court orders.
The President also asked the
legislators to strengthen the FBl's
hand in dealing with school and
church bombing cases and to au
thorize federal funds and advice
to help states make the change to
desegregated schools.
Reaction was cut to a familiar
pattern â€” the Eisenhower civil
rights program either goes too
far or not far enough, depending
on whether a Southern segrega
tionist or a Northern liberal is
talking.
Then there are the in-betweens,
largely Administration supporters
from GOP ranks, who said it was
just right.
