### Dick Barnes Associate Editor 
A newly created Toyon â€¢ Inter
club Judicial Council will have
original jurisdiction in eating-club
disciplinary cases under bylaw ad
ditions passed by Legislature last
night.
Approval of the measure puts
eating clubs in the same position
as fraternities with regard to club
violation of University or ASSU
regulations. The new council will
also have original jurisdiction in
cases of dormitory violations by
residents of Toyon.
Proposed bylaw changes con
cerning Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission were
referred to the bylaws committee
for further study.
Principal provisions provide for
two members of Judicial Council

ducing the commission's size to 10
members, and for clarification of
th e commission's interpretive
powers in regard to the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code.

approved a resolution calling for
establishment of charge accounts
