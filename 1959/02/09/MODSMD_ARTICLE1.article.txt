# 2000 Researchers Escape Bio Lab Flames
## 
### Carl Oliver 
Two thousand researchers were
evacuated from a flash fire in the
biology building Friday at 3:15
p.m. All were mice being used in
cancer research.
The fire flashed through a base
ment laboratory when a bunsen
burner ignited fumes from a
chemical-soaked cloth which Mrs.
Patricia Barry, a research assist
ant, had been using to clean
slides. *
Mrs. Barry, who had left the
room for a moment, said she
heard a "whoosh" and found the
wall in flames when she returned
to the laboratory.
Nearby graduate students
grabbed fire extinguishers and
fought the blaze until firemen ar
rived on the scene about five min
utes later.
Dense smoke collected in a
large portion of the basement
and hampered fire department ef
forts to locate and extinguish the
blaze. Firemen were forced to
don oxygen masks.
The mice were trucked from
the animal room adjoining the
laboratory. Laboratory workers'
fast work saved the mice from
death by smoke inhalation.
About $G()0 damage was done
to the laboratory where Professor
Clifford Grobstein is doing re
search in experimental embryol
ogy and its implications on can
cer.
