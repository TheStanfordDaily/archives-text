# Spirited End to SF Concert
## 
### Walter Moore 
After ;i disappointing start, the
San Francisco Symphony's an
nual campus appearance Satur
day night came to a spirited and
exciting close.
As was mentioned in the eve
ning's program notes, this is
Maestro Enrique .Torda's sixth
season as musical director of the
orchestra. During his tenure,
Jorda has without doubt consid
erably rejuvenated I he spirit of
the symphony, rearranged its
personnel, and molded them into
an ensemble with a certain degree
of precision and cohesive force.
Hardly Virtuoso
It is hardly a virtuoso orches
tra, however, and is distinctly lim
ited in tonal brilliance and tech
nique. Considering the activities
■>f the orchestras of Detroit and
Pittsburgh, not to mention Chi
cago, Philadelphia, New York and
Boston, it must lie said with all
honesty that the San Francisco
Symphony does not fulfill the ex
pectations its name would sug
gest.
Saturday night's p r o g r a m
opened with a rather dry and life
less performance of Mendols

sohn's Overt urn lo Ruy Bias. The
harsh tone and poor intonation
may have been due and part to
the weather's bad effect on the
instruments and also the strange
acoustical properties of Memorial
Auditorium. It was a vigorous
and energetic reading, but hardly
distinguished by unity of purpose
and direction.
Inelegant Phrasing
The Mozart Serenata for string
orchestra and solo quartet, which
followed, was characterized by a
dull, heavy sound and inelegant
phrasing. The solo quartet sound
ed as though they were fighting
the music from beginning to end
and the net result was a labored,
unlovely and uneven perform
ance.
Throughout these first two
works, one received the distinct
impression that comparatively lit
tle time had been spent on their
preparation.
True Capabilities Shown
It remained for the Prokoffief
Suite from the "Love for Three
Oranges" to establish the true ca
pabilities of the orchestra. Jorda
I directed a refined and colorful
performance of this delightful
music and drew some beautiful

sinewy string lone from the en
semblc. A more dynamic and in
cisive approach, however, would
ave brought out more of the pun
have brought out more ol the
pungency of the score.
The remainder of the program
was devoted to a lively, spirited
performance of Beethoven's Sev
enth Symphony. The orchestra
which was by this time complete
ly warmed up and prepared for
the occasion, came through with
some well-disciplined and artistic
playing. Particularly notable was
the beautifully spun violin tone
and lucid balance between the
winds and strings in the sccond
movement.
Fell by the Wayside
Many notes fell by the wayside
as a result of the quick tempo of
the last two movements, but the
joyous and exciting music mak
ing more than compensated for
lack of t e c h n i c a 1 distinction.
Maestro Jorda's conception of the
! work was purposeful, direct and
| very well realized by the orchcs
j tra.
The capacity audience was par
ticularly grateful for this per
formance and enthusiastically ac-
I knowledged the conductor.

day night came to a spirited and
exciting close.
As was mentioned in the eve
ning's program notes, this is
Maestro Enrique .Torda's sixth
season as musical director of the
orchestra. During his tenure,
Jorda has without doubt consid
erably rejuvenated I he spirit of
the symphony, rearranged its
personnel, and molded them into
an ensemble with a certain degree
of precision and cohesive force.
Hardly Virtuoso
It is hardly a virtuoso orches
tra, however, and is distinctly lim
ited in tonal brilliance and tech
nique. Considering the activities
■>f the orchestras of Detroit and
Pittsburgh, not to mention Chi
cago, Philadelphia, New York and
Boston, it must lie said with all
honesty that the San Francisco
Symphony does not fulfill the ex
pectations its name would sug
gest.
Saturday night's p r o g r a m
opened with a rather dry and life
less performance of Mendols

sohn's Overt urn lo Ruy Bias. The
harsh tone and poor intonation
may have been due and part to
the weather's bad effect on the
instruments and also the strange
acoustical properties of Memorial
Auditorium. It was a vigorous
and energetic reading, but hardly
distinguished by unity of purpose
and direction.
Inelegant Phrasing
The Mozart Serenata for string
orchestra and solo quartet, which
followed, was characterized by a
dull, heavy sound and inelegant
phrasing. The solo quartet sound
ed as though they were fighting
the music from beginning to end
and the net result was a labored,
unlovely and uneven perform
ance.
Throughout these first two
works, one received the distinct
impression that comparatively lit
tle time had been spent on their
preparation.
True Capabilities Shown
It remained for the Prokoffief
Suite from the "Love for Three
Oranges" to establish the true ca
pabilities of the orchestra. Jorda
I directed a refined and colorful
performance of this delightful
music and drew some beautiful

sinewy string lone from the en
semblc. A more dynamic and in
cisive approach, however, would
ave brought out more of the pun
have brought out more ol the
pungency of the score.
The remainder of the program
was devoted to a lively, spirited
performance of Beethoven's Sev
enth Symphony. The orchestra
which was by this time complete
ly warmed up and prepared for
the occasion, came through with
some well-disciplined and artistic
playing. Particularly notable was
the beautifully spun violin tone
and lucid balance between the
winds and strings in the sccond
movement.
Fell by the Wayside
Many notes fell by the wayside
as a result of the quick tempo of
the last two movements, but the
joyous and exciting music mak
ing more than compensated for
lack of t e c h n i c a 1 distinction.
Maestro Jorda's conception of the
! work was purposeful, direct and
| very well realized by the orchcs
j tra.
The capacity audience was par
ticularly grateful for this per
formance and enthusiastically ac-
I knowledged the conductor.
