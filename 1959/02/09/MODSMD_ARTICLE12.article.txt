# Fun Stan Discussions Will Explain Problems
## 
### 
Members of the Fundamental
Standard Commission will discuss
the Fundamental Standard with
freshman women tonight at cor

ridor meetings in Branner, Sue
Keene, president of Women's
Council, said.
One member of the commission
will meet with women from each
corridor on an informal basis.
The discussions are being held
to provide better understanding
of the Fundamental Standard to
the freshmen and to help the
commission to keep informed of
the students' problems.
"The discussions should help
the commission to arrive at a
more valuable interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard," AS
SU President John Bohn said.
Similar discussions will be held
next Monday night at Roble with

members of the
Judicial Council
assisting the
commission.
Plans have not
yet been made
for meetings of
the same type
with freshman
men. They will
be he 1 d some
time in the near
future, however,
Ji m Robertson,
Judicial Council

member, said.
The commission had hoped to
have a revised edition of its book
lot on the Fundamental Standard
to pass around at I lie discussions,
according to Jim Robertson.
Sinre the Legislature has not
appropriated the monoy to print
the booklet this won't be possible,
he said. Though revision lias been
completed the Legislature has
postponed indefinitely appropriat
ing the money.
The commission hopes the new
booklet, when distributed, will be

complete enough to be a guide for
students faced with situations in
volving the Fundamental Stand
ard, Robinson said.
