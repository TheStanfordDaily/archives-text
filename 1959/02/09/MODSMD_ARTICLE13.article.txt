# Plans Fail For Test Ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P) â€” Russia
and the Western powers appear
close to the break-off point in
their negotiations for an agree
ment banning tests of nuclear
weapons.
A statement issued by the So
viet Foreign Ministry and broad
cast by Moscow radio Saturday
was regarded in Washington as a
move to put blame for the threat
ened collapse on the United
States.
U.S. Statement
For its part, the United States
has told Russia il will be impos
sible to negotiate an agreement if
the Soviets insist on a veto voting
system to control the proposed
inspection teams which would en
force a test ban.
The inspection system the
Western powers have proposed at
Geneva would be run by interna
tional scientific teams. In every
country the teams would be under
foreign control subject to the di
rection of: an over-all council or
commission acting by a majority
vote which would deny any coun
try a veto.
Soviet Proposal
The Soviet proposal would give
vetoes lo the United States, Brit
ain and Russia. This would per
mit any one of these powers to
prevent an inspection team from
looking into evidence of a sneak
atomic explosion on ils territory.
Furthermore, the Soviet, gov
ernment wants Russians actually
in command of the control post
on Russian territory.
