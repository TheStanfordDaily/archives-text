# Contact Rule Archaic
## 
### 
Stanford's "no-contact" rule is an affront to the intelligence,
dignity and integrity of the Stanford student and, as such, should
he repealed.
The no-contact system theoretically exists for the protection
of freshmen and for the protection of fraternities and clubs.
With regard to freshmen, it has protected them so much that
they now live in a relatively closed society, unchallenged hv any
student thinking other than their own. In order to further con
tact with upperclassmen which we Iccl would contribute in a
meaningful and vital way to a freshman's education, one of the
chief impediments to this intercourse the no-contact ride—must
he removed as a first step.
"Ao contact" is a method whereby a fraternity is pro
tected from other fraternities so that rut one house frets
a head start in rushing freshmen. In other words, the
no-contact rule protects fraternities and clubs from them
selves at the expense of the freshmen's education.
We suggest that, in our institution, education should he more
important than (he security of a living system.
The no-contact rule insinuates lliat fraternities and
clubs NEED to be protected from themselves—that they
are incapable of carrying on normal social contact with
out continually thinking about filling the pledge class.
It insinuates that they wouldn't hare the integrity to live
in an open system limited only by the rule that no pledge
pins or offers could be made until formal rush.
We would suggest that these insinuations are unfounded.
The no-contact rule intimates that the caliber of entering
freshmen is so low and so socially oriented that their first thought
and purpose for coming to college was to pledge a fraternity, and
that—if the no-contact rule weren't in existence —freshmen would
lose all concepts of education and would proceed to rush the
houses.
We feel that this intimation is an insult to the intelligence of
freshman students.
The rule further insinuates that, somehow, those get
ting to the freshmen first would have a better chance of
pledging them.
We would suggest that this has nothing to do with how a fresh
man will pledge, but that whether to pledge a house or not will
be decided by matters of much more importance —the kind of
men in the fraternity or club, etc.
Therefore it is unnecessary to keep freshmen fenced in on
these grounds by the no-contact rule.
The rule also assumes that for rushing purposes it is
desirable to keep the freshmen from viewing fraternities
and meeting fraternity and club people until formal rush.
It suggests that it is good for freshmen. in the period of
two hectic weeks, to make a decision as to where they
will live for three years.
We suggest that it would he desirable for the freshmen to have
time to learn more of their alternatives, and to he able to see clubs
and houses as they are most of the time.
If e suggest that the rule (printed on this page) needs
reconsideration, and that the objectives stated in the last
line need careful scrutiny. When placed in the perspec
tive of Stan ford's total educational purpose, we conclude
that the rule is archaic and should be repealed.
Vi e commend Legislature for instigating an investigation of
the rushing procedure. This will necessarily entail a review of
the no-contact rule. We ask that they also recommend its repeal
to the Interfraternity Council, the interclub Council and Dean
Craig.
This is only one answer to an important problem—there are
probably others. We ask that when you think about possible
corrections you think about them in terms of the over-all educa
tional objectives of the University.
And. ice submit, there is metre involved here than just
the no-contact rule.
Is it naive for us to suppose that freshmen and upperclassmen
could live in an open system? If this is the case, consider the
implications. Does this suggest that somehow our education hasn't
actually done what it was supposed to do—mainly, to train us to
handle situations in a rational manner?
II hat part of our education should be sacri ficed to
preserve a living system? Where do you draw the line?
We suggest that actually this is a problem of values. How do I
you reconcile a liv ing system, whose component parts can't depend j
upon each other, with an intelligent academic environment? Wei
believe it can be done, but it will involve some serious thinking
and a realigning of values—putting first things first. We feel that
reconsideration of the no-contact rule is as good a place to start
as any.
Tomorrow we will comment on the implications of abandon
ing the no-contact rule, and suggest ways to avoid some of the less
desirable effects.

We would suggest that this has nothing to do with how a fresh

Is it naive for us to suppose that freshmen and upperclassmen
could live in an open system? If this is the case, consider the

We suggest that actually this is a problem of values. How do I

The no-contact system theoretically exists for the protection
of freshmen and for the protection of fraternities and clubs.
With regard to freshmen, it has protected them so much that
they now live in a relatively closed society, unchallenged hv any

"Ao contact" is a method whereby a fraternity is pro

We suggest that, in our institution, education should he more

The no-contact rule insinuates lliat fraternities and
clubs NEED to be protected from themselves—that they
are incapable of carrying on normal social contact with

the rushing procedure. This will necessarily entail a review of
the no-contact rule. We ask that they also recommend its repeal
to the Interfraternity Council, the interclub Council and Dean
Craig.
This is only one answer to an important problem—there are
probably others. We ask that when you think about possible
corrections you think about them in terms of the over-all educa
tional objectives of the University.
And. ice submit, there is metre involved here than just
the no-contact rule.
Is it naive for us to suppose that freshmen and upperclassmen
could live in an open system? If this is the case, consider the
implications. Does this suggest that somehow our education hasn't
actually done what it was supposed to do—mainly, to train us to
handle situations in a rational manner?
II hat part of our education should be sacri ficed to
preserve a living system? Where do you draw the line?
We suggest that actually this is a problem of values. How do I
you reconcile a liv ing system, whose component parts can't depend j
upon each other, with an intelligent academic environment? Wei
believe it can be done, but it will involve some serious thinking
and a realigning of values—putting first things first. We feel that
reconsideration of the no-contact rule is as good a place to start
as any.
Tomorrow we will comment on the implications of abandon
ing the no-contact rule, and suggest ways to avoid some of the less
desirable effects.
Stanford's "no-contact" rule is an affront to the intelligence,
dignity and integrity of the Stanford student and, as such, should
he repealed.
The no-contact system theoretically exists for the protection
of freshmen and for the protection of fraternities and clubs.
With regard to freshmen, it has protected them so much that
they now live in a relatively closed society, unchallenged hv any
student thinking other than their own. In order to further con
tact with upperclassmen which we Iccl would contribute in a
meaningful and vital way to a freshman's education, one of the
chief impediments to this intercourse the no-contact ride—must
he removed as a first step.
"Ao contact" is a method whereby a fraternity is pro
tected from other fraternities so that rut one house frets
a head start in rushing freshmen. In other words, the
no-contact rule protects fraternities and clubs from them
selves at the expense of the freshmen's education.
We suggest that, in our institution, education should he more
important than (he security of a living system.
The no-contact rule insinuates lliat fraternities and
clubs NEED to be protected from themselves—that they
are incapable of carrying on normal social contact with
out continually thinking about filling the pledge class.
It insinuates that they wouldn't hare the integrity to live
in an open system limited only by the rule that no pledge
pins or offers could be made until formal rush.
We would suggest that these insinuations are unfounded.
The no-contact rule intimates that the caliber of entering
freshmen is so low and so socially oriented that their first thought
and purpose for coming to college was to pledge a fraternity, and
that—if the no-contact rule weren't in existence —freshmen would
lose all concepts of education and would proceed to rush the
houses.
We feel that this intimation is an insult to the intelligence of
freshman students.
The rule further insinuates that, somehow, those get
ting to the freshmen first would have a better chance of
pledging them.
We would suggest that this has nothing to do with how a fresh
man will pledge, but that whether to pledge a house or not will
be decided by matters of much more importance —the kind of
men in the fraternity or club, etc.
Therefore it is unnecessary to keep freshmen fenced in on
these grounds by the no-contact rule.
The rule also assumes that for rushing purposes it is
desirable to keep the freshmen from viewing fraternities
and meeting fraternity and club people until formal rush.
It suggests that it is good for freshmen. in the period of
two hectic weeks, to make a decision as to where they
will live for three years.
We suggest that it would he desirable for the freshmen to have
time to learn more of their alternatives, and to he able to see clubs
and houses as they are most of the time.
If e suggest that the rule (printed on this page) needs
reconsideration, and that the objectives stated in the last
line need careful scrutiny. When placed in the perspec
tive of Stan ford's total educational purpose, we conclude
that the rule is archaic and should be repealed.
