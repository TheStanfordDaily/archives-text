Dancing on Campus
Editor, The Daily:
I am a foreign student freshly
arrived from Italy—the land re
nowned for its beauty and its sen
timental people! It should not be
surprising therefore that 1 am
very fond of both good dancing
and beautiful women but to my
great surprise I could find neither
on the campus!
Admittedly 1 have not yet had
a chance nor the great pleasure of
meeting all the Stanford girls—
a hope which I greatly cherish!
On my arrival to the U.S.A.,
five weeks ago, I was told that
there did not exist a single place
where I could enjoy a "hot" Latin
American dance with a Stanford
female! Now why not devote one
of the rooms of the Women's
Clubhouse to dancing every Wed
nesday and on weekends?
This whole letter is based solely
on the assumption that American
girls like dancing. I would like

to take the opportunity to invite
any beautiful "signorina" inter
ested in learning the Cha Cha Cha
or the Mam bo, or practicing her
French and Italian, to phone
Stern Hall, Room 579.
Emmanuele Schvili
Great believer in the improve
merit of American foreign re
lations through females and
dancing!
