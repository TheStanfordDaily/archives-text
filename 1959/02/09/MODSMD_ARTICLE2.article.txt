# Julie Harris Visits Here; Tells of Stage Experiences
## 
### Cally Tanner 
Actress Julie Harris, star of the Broadway production "The Lark,"
visited Stanford Friday, telling speech and drama students of her ex
periences in the theater and her feelings about acting.
Perhaps the most exciting quality the students found in Miss
Harris was her natural honesty of expression. This, most critics

agree, remains with her on the
stage, creating a refreshing "be
lievability" in every role she
takes.
"Her belicvability is something
more than feeling that Miss Har
ris is a real person in a play,"
said Drama Professor Stanley
Donner, introducing Miss Harris.
"She communicates a sense that
somehow the audience is also a
part of that person, and genuine
ly so."
"Everything Important"
Describing preparation for an
acting career, Miss Harris said.
"Everything one experiences will
be important to him." Actors
draw on their knowledge and re
call their own feelings, so they
must be sensitive to everything
about them.
"One must observe nature and
experience solitude," she contin

ued. "Not in a hermit-like way,
but he must achieve that ability
within himself to feel aloneness,
and yet still related to that which
is about him."
"Freeing Oneself"
Miss Harris also stressed the
importance of "sensing one's
voice and physical body." She ad
vised vocal and dancing or fenc
ing lessons as very necessary aids
to "freeing oneself physically and
emotionally, in order to become
someone else." Through music
one becomes aware of the rhythm
that is present in all life, and in
plays as well.
"Imagination is the quality
that makes it possible for every
one to act," she said. When Miss
Harris played in the television
production of "Johnny Belinda"
it was the development of this
particular quality that made her
performance so convincing.
Imagine Deaf and Mute
"I had to concentrate very hard
to imagine that I had always been
deaf and mute, and that I had
never been important to anyone."
Then, she said, her sensitivity to
sign language increased and she
felt almost wholly dependent on
this type of immediate communi
cation.
"Acting is a living challenge,"
she concluded. "One can always
learn something new. When ap
proaching any new part one must
say to himself, 'I don't know any
thing.' Then he can walk into a
part and make it breathe."
Part in "Warm Peninsula"
Julie Harris is now starring in
"The Warm Peninsula" at the
Curran Theater in San Francisco.
She plays the part of Ruth Ar
nold, a girl convinced that she is
hopelessly plain and homely. She
tries to reach out to love, but
doesn't really know how, and is
constantly afraid that she will
fail.
Ruth does find meaning in life,
after a long and eventful stay in
Miami, where she observes four
lives being made miserable and
almost tragic by love. Returning
to her home in Milwaukee, she is
quite happy to be herself after
all; she marries, and leaves the
audience assured that she will
"live happily ever after."
"In the final moment of the
play I had the feeling that I
should somehow include the au
dience," said Miss Harris, and
that she does. Leaving the stage
in the wedding march. Ruth Ar
nold casts otic last glance over her
shoulder and a quick smile that I
says, "Yes, I am happy."
