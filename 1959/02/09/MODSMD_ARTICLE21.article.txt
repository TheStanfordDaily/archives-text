# The 						President's Report

### John Bonn 
Legislature, in attempting to
broaden its scope of effectiveness,
has embarked into several areas
of interest which in the past have
been largely neglected. Last week
a subcommittee was established,
one which I hope will be perma
nent. Its purpose is to ascertain
student views on questions relat
ing to the broad, somewhat amor
phous category of academics, and
to devise means whereby student
viows may be implemented.
It is our hope that this com
mittee will become conversant
with the academic policies and
practices of the University and
thereby bo able to advise Legis
lature as to the most efficacious
course of action in this area.
In the area of the Fundamental
Standard and the Honor Code
there has been some little criti
cism concerning the position and
effectiveness of the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Com
mission in relation to the Judicial
Council.
As a result of the Legislative
inquiry into this problem, by
laws arc now pending which
would provide a closer tie between
the two bodies and consequently
a more realistic and informative
interpretation of the principles of
the Fundamental Standard and
the Honor Code.
A committee has also been es
tablished to work with IFC and
ICC to examine the current rush
ing procedure with an eye to im
provement. It is hoped that such
a committee, composed as it is of
an equal number of fraternity
and non-fraternity men, can pro
vide an objectively accurate over
all analysis which will aid the fu
ture formulation of a policy bene
ficial to all.
The rushing system as it cur
rently operates seems still to be
in the experimental stage and we
would appreciate suggestions,
particularly from the freshmen,
as to how the system might be
improved.

There are a few other short
items which might be of interest.
Some question was raised last
week during the report on the
Pre-Registration Commission as
to the events which ought to bo
included in Pre â€¢ Registration
Week.
The emphasis has been increas
ingly on the academic side, and
the Commission is very much in
terested in student opinion on the
relative merits of the Jolly-up,
faculty open houses, campus
tours and so forth.

In addition, overtures have
been made to the Palo Alto Cham
ber of Commerce for a student
consultant in matters which af
fect Stanford students, but I have
as yet no details. The Cellar proj
ect is still iti the planning stage.
Dave Bess is handling the plan
ning and cost details and should
report this week. We would like
very much to have student views
on this project, and suggestions
may be dropped off at the ASSU
office.
