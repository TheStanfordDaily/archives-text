# Cal Nips Bruins, Takes Over Lead
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### 
It's looking like the same old story in Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball. California moved all alone into first place with two weekend
victories in Los Angeles and the Bears appear in good shape to drive
for their third successive title.
Cal dumped UCLA out of the driver's seat Friday night with a

60-58 victory on A 1 Buch's one
second left jump shot. Saturday,
Coach Pete Newell's crew really
got warmed up and rolled all over
Southern California, 82-55.
UCLA meanwhile was knocked
down another rung S a t u r d a y
night when Idaho's balanced scor
ing overcame a 38-point explosion
by Bruin Walt Torrence for a 91-
ST win.
Other games saw Washington
stay above water with an 82-73
win over Washington State; Ore
gon State was upset by Oregon
Friday, 73-68, but came back Sat
urday to bounce WSC, 72-58; and
USC nipped Idaho, 67-66, in a
Friday night game.
Cal Wins Crucial
Cal won its big one Friday
night behind the hot second-half
shooting of Buch and the back
board domination of 6-10 Darral
Imhoff. The Bears held a 33-29
halftime lead and increased their
advantage to as many as 10 points
in the second half before UCLA
came back to tie it up.
The Bruins pulled it to 58-58
with 15 seconds left. Cal went
into a stall waiting for a last shot
—Buch took it and Buch hit it,
with one second remaining.
Buch Leads
Saturday Buch had 17 more to
lead the Bears to an easy triumph
over USC. But the big fireworks
in that doubleheader came as Ida
ho outlasted UCLA 91-87 and Tor
rence put on the PCC's biggest
scoring show of the year.
Vandal Coach Harlan Hodges
used only six men- and all of
them hit double figures. John
Liveious had 26 for top Idaho hon
ors; Whaylon Coleman contribut
ed 16 and B. J. Schaffer 15.
Torrence moved into the PCC
scoring lead with his weekend
performance (he had 18 against
Call. Previous one • game high
this season was by Washington's
Doug Smart: 35 against UCLA.
Harmon Sprains Ankle
For Oregon Stale, it was a
doubly-disastrous weekend. Fri
day, a balanced Oregon attack,
paced by Dale Herron's 18 mark
ers, upset the Beavers, 73-68. Sat
urday, although the Orange was
easily beating WSC, they lost the
services of top scorer Lee Har
man with a sprained ankle. Har
man, who went into the game as
the PCC's top scorer, didn't score
a point. He had 23 against Ore
gon Friday.
Washington won its fifth
straight game Friday by holding
off a determined WSC rally for
an 82-73 win. Big Bruno Boin de
livered 27 points to pace the Hus
kies, while Doug Smart had 15.
John Maras, 6-6, led the Cougars
with 20.

He made t!u' difference
It's looking like the same old story in Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball. California moved all alone into first place with two weekend
victories in Los Angeles and the Bears appear in good shape to drive
for their third successive title.
Cal dumped UCLA out of the driver's seat Friday night with a

60-58 victory on A 1 Buch's one
second left jump shot. Saturday,
Coach Pete Newell's crew really
got warmed up and rolled all over
Southern California, 82-55.
UCLA meanwhile was knocked
down another rung S a t u r d a y
night when Idaho's balanced scor
ing overcame a 38-point explosion
by Bruin Walt Torrence for a 91-
ST win.
Other games saw Washington
stay above water with an 82-73
win over Washington State; Ore
gon State was upset by Oregon
Friday, 73-68, but came back Sat
urday to bounce WSC, 72-58; and
USC nipped Idaho, 67-66, in a
Friday night game.
Cal Wins Crucial
Cal won its big one Friday
night behind the hot second-half
shooting of Buch and the back
board domination of 6-10 Darral
Imhoff. The Bears held a 33-29
halftime lead and increased their
advantage to as many as 10 points
in the second half before UCLA
came back to tie it up.
The Bruins pulled it to 58-58
with 15 seconds left. Cal went
into a stall waiting for a last shot
—Buch took it and Buch hit it,
with one second remaining.

Saturday Buch had 17 more to
lead the Bears to an easy triumph
over USC. But the big fireworks
in that doubleheader came as Ida

scoring show of the year.
