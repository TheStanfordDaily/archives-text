## Dulles Hints At Western Concessions 
### 
BONN. Germany (TP) — Secre
tary of State John Foster Dulles
hinted Sunday night that the
West may make some slight con
ciliatory move toward the Soviets
on Germany.
One indication of how such a
move will be boxed in was con
tained in the phrase—no conces
sions without Soviet concessions.
Adenauer
A German spokesman quoted
West German Chancellor Konrad
Adenauer as saying firmly that
he was against Ihe kind of flexi
bility that means giving some
thing away without getting any
thing in return. This kind of bar
gaining, he said, would only en
courage the Soviets to make more
greedy demands.
Nevertheless, American and
German spokesmen hinted there
was a lot of rethinking going on,
and that the Western powers are
in the midst of a sweeping reap
praisal of their positions on Ber
lin, Germany and European secu
rity.
Difficulties
One problem is how to deal
with the situation should East
Germans attempt to regulate Al
lied military traffic to isolated
East Berlin.
An immediate problem is the
response lo the Soviet proposal of
Jan. 10 calling for a 28-nation
peace conference on a German
peace treaty this spring.
Dulles concluded his talks in
Bonn by saying they had been
"fruitful." West German Foreign
Minister Heinrieh von Brentano
said I hoy had been "a great suc
cess."
