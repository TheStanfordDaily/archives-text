## Fundamental Standard Discussed With Freshmen 
### Judy Sklar 
Fundamental Standard Commission members met with corridors
of Branner women last night in informal discussions to provide bet
ter understanding of the Fundamental Standard by freshmen and
help the commission arrive at a more valuable interpretation of it.
The discussions, the first of those planned for all freshmen, were

an attempt to clarify the Funda
mental Standard and students' re
sponsibilities to it.
In corridor One West, Jim Rob
ertson, Judicial Council member,
first explained the workings of
the Judicial Council and the Fun
damental Standard Commission,
and defined the Fundamental
Standard as an ethical code, not
a law.
Cases Presented
He presented several cases in
which the corridor discussed turn
ing in and punishing violators.
It was generally agreed that
the Fundamental Standard is a
basis for helping students attain
ethical behavior, and that report
ing a violator is the last step in
providing intelligent aid.
In discussion it was pointed out
that tlie Fundamental Standard
Commission docs not regar d a sin
gle violation of the California
stale liquor law as a violation of
the Fundamental Standard. Stu
dents fell that their own ethical
code should govern their decision
on drinking.
Discussion Series
Similar discussions will be held
next Monday night at Iloblc and
later at Wilbur.
The serins of discussions are in
tender] to stimulate student think
ing and the expression of student
ideas on the subject of the Funda
mental Standard and its enforce
ment.
It is hoped that a revised ver
sion of the Fundamental Stand
ard booklet, complete enough to
guide students faced with situa
tions involving the Fundamental
Standard, will be a result of these
meetings.
