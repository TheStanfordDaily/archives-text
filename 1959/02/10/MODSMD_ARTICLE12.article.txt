# Mice Alarmed
## 
### 
Two thousand mice again felt
panic last night, when the fire
alarm in the Biological Sciences
building started shrieking for the
second time in a week. Unlike last
Friday when they had to be evac
uated to prevent their death from
smoke inhalation, the mice re
mained safe in the animal room.
Fire Chief Gordon Davis report
ed it was only a false alarm due
to faulty wiring in the system.
