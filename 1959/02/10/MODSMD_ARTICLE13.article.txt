# Police, ABC Intervene; 300 Students Involved
## 
### Dick Barnes, Associate Editor 
Zeta Psi and Phi Gamma Delta have been suspended from campus
and five other fraternities given varying degrees of probation as an
outgrowth of a Jan. 30 party.
Dean of Men William Craig announced the penalties yesterday,
following more than a week of closed deliberation by administra-

tion officials and Interfraternity
Council.
Other penalized houses are Beta
Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, Phi Delta
Theta, Delta Kappa Epsilon and
Delta Tau Delta.
About 300 students—lso men,
150 women—attended the party,
held at Union Hall in Los Altos.
Apparently a neighborhood pa
trolman feared the party might
get out of hand, and summoned
assistance.
Police arrived about 10:15, but
confined their efforts to checking
ID's, since some minors were ap
parently drinking. Shortly before
12, police asked that the party be
halted, and the hall was cleared
by 12:15.
Full Report
A full report of the affair was
turned over to Craig by the Los
Altos police, and by Alcoholic
Beverage Control agent Charles
N. Thompson.
Craig referred the matter to
IFC for action, and IPC's Judicial
Council launched an investiga
tion.
Council Chairman Jim Ukro
pina told The Daily that the coun
cil examined the report statement
by statement. While some aspects
of the report were substantiated
by interviews with students at the
party, other accusations in the re
port were termed untrue by those
interviewed.
Ukropina said there was no
doubt that minors had been drink
ing or that beer had been thrown
from a distance at one officer.
But he said sections of the report
which claimed that an overthrow
of the police was planned or that
a woman was being assaulted
were stoutly denied.
No Alternative
Ukropina said that the council
had no alternative but to try to
find the true middle ground be
tween the police report and re
ports of students in attendance.
Giving the bulk of credence to
the police report, the council
reached what it thought was a
fair evaluation of the affair, then
recommended suspended social
probation for each of the seven
houses, Ukropina continued.
Ukropina said that because of
the difficulty in accurately fixing
blame for the incident, the coun
cil felt it most fair to mctc out
equal penalties.
Action Unacceptable
IPC's action was reported to
Craig, who found it unacceptable.
After consultation with students
and administration, he imposed
the more severe penalties and re
leased the statement printed in
adjoining columns.
Dean Craig told The Daily:
"The details aren't the significant
matter. The important fact is
that the party had to bo broken
up by the police and this was the
grounds for the University ac
tion."
Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler, attempting to clarify
the position of women at the af
fair, told The Daily, "We have not
had any indication or reports, nor
have our investigations indicated
that there is any responsibiilty on
the part of the Stanford women
present. It was purely a frater
nity function."
The penalties which each fra
ternity incurred were determined
according to their individual re
sponsibility, he added.

had any indication or reports, nor
have our investigations indicated
that there is any responsibiilty on
the part of the Stanford women
present. It was purely a frater
nity function."
The penalties which each fra
ternity incurred were determined
according to their individual re
sponsibility, he added.
Zeta Psi and Phi Gamma Delta have been suspended from campus
and five other fraternities given varying degrees of probation as an
outgrowth of a Jan. 30 party.
Dean of Men William Craig announced the penalties yesterday,
following more than a week of closed deliberation by administra-

tion officials and Interfraternity
Council.
Other penalized houses are Beta
Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, Phi Delta
Theta, Delta Kappa Epsilon and
Delta Tau Delta.
About 300 students—lso men,
150 women—attended the party,
held at Union Hall in Los Altos.
Apparently a neighborhood pa
trolman feared the party might
get out of hand, and summoned
assistance.
Police arrived about 10:15, but
confined their efforts to checking
ID's, since some minors were ap
parently drinking. Shortly before
12, police asked that the party be
halted, and the hall was cleared
by 12:15.
Full Report
A full report of the affair was
turned over to Craig by the Los
Altos police, and by Alcoholic
Beverage Control agent Charles
N. Thompson.
Craig referred the matter to
IFC for action, and IPC's Judicial
Council launched an investiga
tion.
Council Chairman Jim Ukro
pina told The Daily that the coun
cil examined the report statement
by statement. While some aspects
of the report were substantiated
by interviews with students at the
party, other accusations in the re
port were termed untrue by those
interviewed.
Ukropina said there was no
doubt that minors had been drink
ing or that beer had been thrown
from a distance at one officer.
But he said sections of the report
which claimed that an overthrow
of the police was planned or that
a woman was being assaulted
were stoutly denied.
No Alternative
Ukropina said that the council
had no alternative but to try to
find the true middle ground be
tween the police report and re
ports of students in attendance.
Giving the bulk of credence to
the police report, the council
reached what it thought was a
fair evaluation of the affair, then
recommended suspended social
probation for each of the seven
houses, Ukropina continued.
Ukropina said that because of
the difficulty in accurately fixing
blame for the incident, the coun
cil felt it most fair to mctc out
equal penalties.
Action Unacceptable
IPC's action was reported to
Craig, who found it unacceptable.
After consultation with students
and administration, he imposed
the more severe penalties and re
leased the statement printed in
adjoining columns.
Dean Craig told The Daily:
"The details aren't the significant
matter. The important fact is
that the party had to bo broken
up by the police and this was the
grounds for the University ac
tion."
Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler, attempting to clarify
