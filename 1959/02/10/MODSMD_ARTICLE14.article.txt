MOSCOW (A 3 ) â€” Neither the So
viet press nor domestic broad
casts Sunday told the Soviet peo
ple about Moscow radio's denun
ciation of U.S. tape recordings of
Soviet fighters who allegedly shot
down an American plane.
Broadcasts beamed around the
world in several languages Satur
day charged the tapes, made pub
lic by the State Department
Thursday, were a fake.
The recordings and the accom
panying State Department
charges have not been mentioned
in the press or domestic broad
casts.
The purport of the U.S. charges
was that, an unarmed American
transport, with 17 airmen aboard,
was deliberately shot down.
