WASHINGTON (/P) — House
Democratic Leader John W. Mc-
Cormack called Monday for the
full picture of a Defense Depart
ment decision not to order imme
diately parts of the Nike-Zeus
antimissile missile system.
The Massachusetts Democrat
spoke as a member of the House
Space Committee, which devoted
its session largely to critical ques
tions about the decision by Secre
tary of Defense Neil H. McFJlroy,
who is scheduled to appear before
the group on March 2.
McCormack said he Is afraid
"the sad day" might come when
Russia might be ahead of the
United States not only in inter
continental ballistic missiles for
offensive use, but also in de
fenses against any counterblows.
There were hints the committee
might recommend giving the
Army $700 million estimated as
needed to start production of
some of the more complicated
components of the Army's Nike-
Zeus antimissile missile system.
Two of the Army's technical
chiefs told the committee they
recommended that the govern
ment should lose no time in start
ing development of a production
base for Nike-Zeuses.
