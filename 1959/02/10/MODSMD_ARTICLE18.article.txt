# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Walter Lippmann McElroy Budget Controversy 
### 
In the swirling controversy
over Ihe Eisenhower-M e E 1 roy
budget the inquiring bystander
must, I believe, accept the fact
that the basic issue is not one
which can be settled definitively.
There is a race of armaments.
But who is"ahead" now, and who
will be "ahead" two years from
now is not something that can be
measured quantitatively, even if
there existed perfect intelligence
with exact and complete know
ledge of the quantity and quality
of all the weapons on both sides.
What statesmen really have to

estimate is what is likely to be
the judgment of other statesmen
about the existing balance of
power.
In making these judgments
they have to listen to the calcu
lations of the experts in various
specialties. But they must be able
to make the necessary discount
in these expert calculations, re
membering that they are essen
tially about war games and not
about the whole reality.
For these calculations are in
variably theoretical abstractions
—what, for example, would hap
pen if there were a war in which
one side had X number of mis
siles and the other had X plus Y
missiles?
At bottom the argument be
tween the Administration and
Sen. Symington is whether the
balance of power should be cal
culated in terms of intercontin
ental missiles or whether it shall
be judged in terms of the whole
complex of armaments and of
the international political situa
tion.
Administration Wrong
My point in all this is not to say
that Mr. McElroy and the Ad
ministration are right. I think
they are very wrong. But I do
not think that they are deliber
ately misleading the country.
What they have done is to argue
their case so badly that they are
losing the confidence of the pub
lic.
The fatal error lies in the de
cision of the President to make
the paramount issue of the pres
ent time a Federal budget bal
anced at the existing level of
taxes, along with a promise of a
reduction of taxes before the
next Presidential election. We
are approaching one of the great

climaxes of the cold war and the
President's decision about tin- 1
paramountry of the budget re
flects a failure to understand the
nature of the cold war.
It makes suspect all the mili
tary estimates in the budget. For
it is no part of the law of the
land, or of that moral law which
the President frequently invokes,
that the existing tax structure
cannot be raised and should be
lowered. To insist on such a dog
ma aljout taxes is to toll the peo
ple and the world that national
defense is not the first but only
the secondary consideration in
this government.
From this it follows inevitably
that Secretary McElroy's assur
ances about our over-all strength
are quite unconvincing. For no
body is prepared to believe that
by a wonderfully lucky coinci
dence the money needed for na
tional defense is just the amount
of money we can afford to spend
if the budget is to be balanced
without raising taxes.
Error About the Budget
This initial error about the
budget has forced Mr. MeElroy
into making the disastrous an
nouncement that the United
States has withdrawn from the
missiles race. He may well be
right that with fewer missiles
there will still be an over-all bal
ance of power. But it is not good
for the Russians and it is bad
for our allies to be allowed to
think that the richest nation on
earth is unwilling to pay what it
costs to stay in that part of the
race of armaments which has
the most horrible prospect. Sec
retary McElroy's announcement
is a most lamentable way to pre
pare for the impending negotia
tions which Secretary Dulles is
now dealing with in Europe.
First Priority
What should be done about it?
It should be said in no uncertain
terms that defense has the first
priority. If the President will
not say it, perhaps Congress it
self should say it by resolutions.
There should then be a substan
tial increase in the military ap
propriations, an increase suffi
cient to put us back into the mis
siles race. Then an increase of
taxes should be voted in order to
balance this larger budget.
I am aware that the extra
money invested in making more
of the existing missiles may be
"wasted" — wasted in the sense
that these missiles will soon be
obsolete and good only for the
junk pile. But the race of arma
ments is in the same sense in
herently wasteful since the ob
jective is to make weapons which
will never be used and will soon
be obsolete.
Nevertheless we are in a race
of armaments. It would be a
great day for mankind if it could
be ended. But if the race is to be
ended, this will be done only if
and when we are able to reach
general political .settlements with
the Communist powers. The race
of armaments cannot be ended or
suspended merely because we
wish to balance the budget with
out raising taxes, or because it
would be good politics to reduce
taxes before the next election.

—what, for example, would hap
pen if there were a war in which
one side had X number of mis
siles and the other had X plus Y
missiles?
At bottom the argument be
tween the Administration and
Sen. Symington is whether the
balance of power should be cal
culated in terms of intercontin
ental missiles or whether it shall
be judged in terms of the whole
complex of armaments and of
the international political situa
tion.
Administration Wrong
My point in all this is not to say
that Mr. McElroy and the Ad
ministration are right. I think
they are very wrong. But I do
not think that they are deliber
ately misleading the country.
What they have done is to argue
their case so badly that they are
losing the confidence of the pub
lic.
The fatal error lies in the de
cision of the President to make
the paramount issue of the pres
ent time a Federal budget bal
anced at the existing level of
taxes, along with a promise of a
reduction of taxes before the
next Presidential election. We
are approaching one of the great

climaxes of the cold war and the
President's decision about tin- 1
paramountry of the budget re
flects a failure to understand the
nature of the cold war.
It makes suspect all the mili
tary estimates in the budget. For
it is no part of the law of the
land, or of that moral law which
the President frequently invokes,
that the existing tax structure
cannot be raised and should be
lowered. To insist on such a dog
ma aljout taxes is to toll the peo
ple and the world that national
defense is not the first but only
the secondary consideration in
this government.
From this it follows inevitably
that Secretary McElroy's assur
ances about our over-all strength
are quite unconvincing. For no
body is prepared to believe that
by a wonderfully lucky coinci
dence the money needed for na
tional defense is just the amount
of money we can afford to spend
if the budget is to be balanced
without raising taxes.
Error About the Budget
This initial error about the
budget has forced Mr. MeElroy
into making the disastrous an
nouncement that the United
States has withdrawn from the
missiles race. He may well be
right that with fewer missiles
there will still be an over-all bal
ance of power. But it is not good
for the Russians and it is bad
for our allies to be allowed to
think that the richest nation on
earth is unwilling to pay what it
costs to stay in that part of the
race of armaments which has
the most horrible prospect. Sec
retary McElroy's announcement
is a most lamentable way to pre
pare for the impending negotia
tions which Secretary Dulles is
now dealing with in Europe.
First Priority
What should be done about it?
It should be said in no uncertain
terms that defense has the first
priority. If the President will
not say it, perhaps Congress it
self should say it by resolutions.
There should then be a substan
tial increase in the military ap
propriations, an increase suffi
cient to put us back into the mis
siles race. Then an increase of
taxes should be voted in order to
balance this larger budget.
I am aware that the extra
money invested in making more
of the existing missiles may be
"wasted" — wasted in the sense
that these missiles will soon be
obsolete and good only for the
junk pile. But the race of arma
ments is in the same sense in
herently wasteful since the ob
jective is to make weapons which
will never be used and will soon
be obsolete.
Nevertheless we are in a race
of armaments. It would be a
great day for mankind if it could
be ended. But if the race is to be
ended, this will be done only if
and when we are able to reach
general political .settlements with
the Communist powers. The race
of armaments cannot be ended or
suspended merely because we
wish to balance the budget with
out raising taxes, or because it
would be good politics to reduce
taxes before the next election.

SECRETARY McELROY
In the swirling controversy
over Ihe Eisenhower-M e E 1 roy
budget the inquiring bystander
must, I believe, accept the fact
that the basic issue is not one
which can be settled definitively.
There is a race of armaments.
But who is"ahead" now, and who
will be "ahead" two years from
now is not something that can be
measured quantitatively, even if
there existed perfect intelligence
with exact and complete know
ledge of the quantity and quality
of all the weapons on both sides.
What statesmen really have to

estimate is what is likely to be
the judgment of other statesmen
about the existing balance of
power.
In making these judgments
they have to listen to the calcu
lations of the experts in various
specialties. But they must be able
to make the necessary discount
in these expert calculations, re
membering that they are essen
tially about war games and not
about the whole reality.

reduction of taxes before the
next Presidential election. We
are approaching one of the great

climaxes of the cold war and the
President's decision about tin- 1
paramountry of the budget re
flects a failure to understand the
nature of the cold war.
It makes suspect all the mili
tary estimates in the budget. For
it is no part of the law of the
land, or of that moral law which
the President frequently invokes,
that the existing tax structure
cannot be raised and should be
lowered. To insist on such a dog
ma aljout taxes is to toll the peo
ple and the world that national
defense is not the first but only
the secondary consideration in
this government.
From this it follows inevitably
that Secretary McElroy's assur
ances about our over-all strength
are quite unconvincing. For no
body is prepared to believe that
by a wonderfully lucky coinci
dence the money needed for na
tional defense is just the amount
of money we can afford to spend
if the budget is to be balanced
without raising taxes.
Error About the Budget
This initial error about the
budget has forced Mr. MeElroy
into making the disastrous an
nouncement that the United
States has withdrawn from the
missiles race. He may well be
right that with fewer missiles
there will still be an over-all bal
ance of power. But it is not good
for the Russians and it is bad
for our allies to be allowed to
think that the richest nation on
earth is unwilling to pay what it
costs to stay in that part of the
race of armaments which has
the most horrible prospect. Sec
retary McElroy's announcement
is a most lamentable way to pre
pare for the impending negotia
tions which Secretary Dulles is
now dealing with in Europe.
First Priority
What should be done about it?
It should be said in no uncertain
terms that defense has the first
priority. If the President will
not say it, perhaps Congress it
self should say it by resolutions.
There should then be a substan
tial increase in the military ap
propriations, an increase suffi
cient to put us back into the mis
siles race. Then an increase of
taxes should be voted in order to
balance this larger budget.
I am aware that the extra
money invested in making more
of the existing missiles may be
"wasted" — wasted in the sense
that these missiles will soon be
obsolete and good only for the
junk pile. But the race of arma
ments is in the same sense in
herently wasteful since the ob
jective is to make weapons which
will never be used and will soon
be obsolete.
Nevertheless we are in a race
of armaments. It would be a
great day for mankind if it could
be ended. But if the race is to be
ended, this will be done only if
and when we are able to reach
general political .settlements with
the Communist powers. The race
of armaments cannot be ended or
suspended merely because we
wish to balance the budget with
out raising taxes, or because it
would be good politics to reduce
taxes before the next election.

SECRETARY McELROY
In the swirling controversy
over Ihe Eisenhower-M e E 1 roy
budget the inquiring bystander
must, I believe, accept the fact
that the basic issue is not one
which can be settled definitively.
There is a race of armaments.
But who is"ahead" now, and who
will be "ahead" two years from
now is not something that can be
measured quantitatively, even if
there existed perfect intelligence
with exact and complete know
ledge of the quantity and quality
of all the weapons on both sides.
What statesmen really have to

estimate is what is likely to be
the judgment of other statesmen
about the existing balance of
power.
In making these judgments
they have to listen to the calcu
lations of the experts in various
specialties. But they must be able
to make the necessary discount
in these expert calculations, re
membering that they are essen
tially about war games and not
about the whole reality.
For these calculations are in
variably theoretical abstractions
—what, for example, would hap
pen if there were a war in which
one side had X number of mis
siles and the other had X plus Y
missiles?
At bottom the argument be
tween the Administration and
Sen. Symington is whether the
balance of power should be cal
culated in terms of intercontin
ental missiles or whether it shall
be judged in terms of the whole
complex of armaments and of
the international political situa
tion.
Administration Wrong
My point in all this is not to say
that Mr. McElroy and the Ad
ministration are right. I think
they are very wrong. But I do
not think that they are deliber
ately misleading the country.
What they have done is to argue
their case so badly that they are
losing the confidence of the pub
lic.
The fatal error lies in the de
cision of the President to make
the paramount issue of the pres
ent time a Federal budget bal
anced at the existing level of
taxes, along with a promise of a
reduction of taxes before the
next Presidential election. We
are approaching one of the great

climaxes of the cold war and the
