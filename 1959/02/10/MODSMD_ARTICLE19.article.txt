Comment on Analysis
Editor, The Daily:
To qualify my brief criticism
of Lester O'Shea's article, "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. G), I shall indicate
that I am merely a freshman
with a lively interest in interna
tional affairs while Lester is a
senior and majoring in it.
Mr. O'Shea never made it clear
to me in just what way UN in
ternationalism was threatened.
Another thing which I object to
is his rash, general statement that
the African states have incompe
tent. immature governments. Per

haps some do. but it must be re
membered that the British for a
long time have shown some of
these African states good govern
ing, and to degrade African gov
ernment is to degrade the British
administration and the English
educational system in Africa.
The fact that there is a surge
in Africa for freedom does not
mean that the UN will break up,
any more than do the present
pan-Arabism tendencies. In the
final analysis 1 would ask Lester
to reconsider African moral and
intellectual values before making
such bold statements about Afri
can nationalism.
