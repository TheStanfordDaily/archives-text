Back Down to Business
And now to got down to business in this T k a<-ii'ic* Coast Conference
basketball race. li sure would bo nice if somebody would win besides
t ho- Bears.
Stanford's little vacation is over and Friday night the Indians
return for the do or die stretch run, meeting high-scoring IK'I,A*. Sat
urday, it's next-to-last, but still dangerous, Oregon.
Another loss would be killing. The Cards achieved the desired
split of the northern Oregon-Washington series, but ( al's two week
end victories make it look lige 11-5 is not going to win the PCC- as
everyone seemed to think a few weeks ago. And, finally, it looks a

little bit like we may have the
Cal • Washington race thai was
pi edicted all along.
Cal si ill faces home games with
Oregon, I CI.A, Southern Cal,
Washington State and Oregon
State. The Bears still face that
rugged throe - game northern
swing, over the Washington's
Birthday holiday: WSC on Fri
day, Idaho on Saturday and Ore
gon State, Monday.
This could be a killer for the
Bears, More and more is Idaho
loming as the spoiler of the con
ference just like last year. Af
ter a most ineffective start, the
Vandals warmed up to a 91-87 up
set over UCLA Saturday night.
Cal, which was in turn stung—
and then helped by Idaho last
year, still faces that tough
cow game.
For the short-memoried ones:a

Idaho bounced Cal last season, 82-71, a week before (he season ended
apparently handing the l'(title to Oregon State. Cut the Vandals
showed no favoritism, strangely—for on the last night of the season
they bopped OSC to throw things back into a tie. Cal went on to win
the playoff for an NCAA berth.
Washington State isn't going the rest of the way wilhout another
win, either. The Cougars shocked UCLA, 71-54, earlier in the season
giving some evidence that new Coach Marv llarshman really has
made them one of the loop's most improved fives.
Huskies Musi Play Vandals. Too
But don't be alarmed, Bears, for Washington hasn't even played
Idaho yet, at. home or away. And the Huskies have to close their
season in Los Angeles March 6 and 7. Seeing that they're buddies
with the Soiithlanders, maybe nothing will happen.
Oregon State is still around, too. But for a shocking upset by
Oregon last week, the Beavers would be tied with Washington for
second place.
However, the Beavers lost their amazing guard, Lee Harman, in
their Saturday win over WSC. Harman started, but was out of action
early with a badly sprained ankle. He didn't score and also saw his
league scoring lead shattered. Because of the injury, llarman's per
game average dropped suddenly from 20.3 to 18.3.
Probably wouldn't have made much difference anyway, for down
south, UCLA's Wall Torrence was gunning 38 points in a losing ef
fort against Idaho, and he suddenly flew into the lead, with 185 points
in nine games for a 20.(i average.
There have been four 30-plus nights for PCCers this season:
Torrenee's 38, l>oug Smart of Washington with 35 against UCLA
and 31 against Oregon Stab', and llarrnan with 33 against Idaho.
Other high marks: 28 and 20, by Harman against Oregon and
Washington Slate; 2(5, by Stanford's Paul Neumann against OSC; 20
by the Beavers' Jim Woodland in I he same game; 20 by Idaho's John
Liveious, opposite Torrenee's 38-point trick last week; 28 by Oregon's
Dale Herron against OSC, and 27 Friday night by Bruno Boin ol'
Washington against WSC.
Forrence (Jinihs in Ranking
Torrence, who had climbed to 34th in national scoring through
last week, now has upped his season's average to 21.0. That would
have been good enough to place him 20th last week.
In national scoring, the spread between ninth place, held by Ed
Blair of Western Michigan, and 52nd place, held by Boh Skousen of
Brigham Young, is only 4.2 points 23.2 to 19.0. On the other hand,
9.7 points separated leader Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati and Blair.
Robertson may yet get a run for his money, even in the absence
of Flgin Baylors and Wilt Chamberlains, who chased him to the
crown last year. While Big O was scoring 21 Saturday, Marshall's
second-place Leo Byrd tanked 38 to creep a little closer.
Torrenee's latest surge now installs him as the temporary favor
ite to cop the PCC scoring crown. But that loop scoring lead has been
a very popular position this season as five men have held it so far
(in six weeks): Denny Fitzpatrick of Cal, Neumann, Smart (for two
weeks), Harman and now Torrence.
Smart, however, need not become too concerned if he doesn't cap
ture the crown. For a mere matter of 71 points separates him from
the all-time scoring leadership of the conference. He has seven games
left to get the 71.
All-time leader is Oregon State's Dave Ganihee, who set the mark
last year when he finished his career with 908 conference points.
Smart, with 838, stands third in league history and should shortly be
second. Currently second is another Husky, Boh lloubregs, who
potted 855 points in three seasons between 1951 and 1953.
AWARD OF THE YEAR: The Oregon Sports Award banquet in
Portland, which featured Jack Curtice as guest speaker, came up
with the year's top award. WSC football coach Jim Sutherland was
presented with a "No Bowl" trophy for his Cougar team of last year.
Referring to WSC's Southland-blocked bowl bid, the inscription bore
the words of CCLA Athletic Director Wilbur Johns: "Rules are made
to he observed."

Idaho bounced Cal last season, 82-71, a week before (he season ended
apparently handing the l'(title to Oregon State. Cut the Vandals
showed no favoritism, strangely—for on the last night of the season
they bopped OSC to throw things back into a tie. Cal went on to win
the playoff for an NCAA berth.
Washington State isn't going the rest of the way wilhout another
win, either. The Cougars shocked UCLA, 71-54, earlier in the season
giving some evidence that new Coach Marv llarshman really has
made them one of the loop's most improved fives.
Huskies Musi Play Vandals. Too
But don't be alarmed, Bears, for Washington hasn't even played
Idaho yet, at. home or away. And the Huskies have to close their
season in Los Angeles March 6 and 7. Seeing that they're buddies
with the Soiithlanders, maybe nothing will happen.
Oregon State is still around, too. But for a shocking upset by
Oregon last week, the Beavers would be tied with Washington for
second place.
However, the Beavers lost their amazing guard, Lee Harman, in
their Saturday win over WSC. Harman started, but was out of action
early with a badly sprained ankle. He didn't score and also saw his
league scoring lead shattered. Because of the injury, llarman's per
game average dropped suddenly from 20.3 to 18.3.
Probably wouldn't have made much difference anyway, for down
south, UCLA's Wall Torrence was gunning 38 points in a losing ef
fort against Idaho, and he suddenly flew into the lead, with 185 points
in nine games for a 20.(i average.
There have been four 30-plus nights for PCCers this season:
Torrenee's 38, l>oug Smart of Washington with 35 against UCLA
and 31 against Oregon Stab', and llarrnan with 33 against Idaho.
Other high marks: 28 and 20, by Harman against Oregon and
Washington Slate; 2(5, by Stanford's Paul Neumann against OSC; 20
by the Beavers' Jim Woodland in I he same game; 20 by Idaho's John
Liveious, opposite Torrenee's 38-point trick last week; 28 by Oregon's
Dale Herron against OSC, and 27 Friday night by Bruno Boin ol'
Washington against WSC.
Forrence (Jinihs in Ranking
Torrence, who had climbed to 34th in national scoring through
last week, now has upped his season's average to 21.0. That would
have been good enough to place him 20th last week.
In national scoring, the spread between ninth place, held by Ed
Blair of Western Michigan, and 52nd place, held by Boh Skousen of
Brigham Young, is only 4.2 points 23.2 to 19.0. On the other hand,
9.7 points separated leader Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati and Blair.
Robertson may yet get a run for his money, even in the absence
of Flgin Baylors and Wilt Chamberlains, who chased him to the
crown last year. While Big O was scoring 21 Saturday, Marshall's
second-place Leo Byrd tanked 38 to creep a little closer.
Torrenee's latest surge now installs him as the temporary favor
ite to cop the PCC scoring crown. But that loop scoring lead has been
a very popular position this season as five men have held it so far
(in six weeks): Denny Fitzpatrick of Cal, Neumann, Smart (for two
weeks), Harman and now Torrence.
Smart, however, need not become too concerned if he doesn't cap
ture the crown. For a mere matter of 71 points separates him from
the all-time scoring leadership of the conference. He has seven games
left to get the 71.
All-time leader is Oregon State's Dave Ganihee, who set the mark
last year when he finished his career with 908 conference points.
Smart, with 838, stands third in league history and should shortly be
second. Currently second is another Husky, Boh lloubregs, who
potted 855 points in three seasons between 1951 and 1953.
AWARD OF THE YEAR: The Oregon Sports Award banquet in
Portland, which featured Jack Curtice as guest speaker, came up
with the year's top award. WSC football coach Jim Sutherland was
presented with a "No Bowl" trophy for his Cougar team of last year.
Referring to WSC's Southland-blocked bowl bid, the inscription bore
the words of CCLA Athletic Director Wilbur Johns: "Rules are made

in nine games for a 20.(i average.
There have been four 30-plus nights for PCCers this season:
Torrenee's 38, l>oug Smart of Washington with 35 against UCLA

Forrence (Jinihs in Ranking
Torrence, who had climbed to 34th in national scoring through
last week, now has upped his season's average to 21.0. That would
have been good enough to place him 20th last week.
In national scoring, the spread between ninth place, held by Ed
Blair of Western Michigan, and 52nd place, held by Boh Skousen of
Brigham Young, is only 4.2 points 23.2 to 19.0. On the other hand,
9.7 points separated leader Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati and Blair.
Robertson may yet get a run for his money, even in the absence
of Flgin Baylors and Wilt Chamberlains, who chased him to the
crown last year. While Big O was scoring 21 Saturday, Marshall's
second-place Leo Byrd tanked 38 to creep a little closer.
Torrenee's latest surge now installs him as the temporary favor
ite to cop the PCC scoring crown. But that loop scoring lead has been
a very popular position this season as five men have held it so far
(in six weeks): Denny Fitzpatrick of Cal, Neumann, Smart (for two
weeks), Harman and now Torrence.
Smart, however, need not become too concerned if he doesn't cap
ture the crown. For a mere matter of 71 points separates him from
the all-time scoring leadership of the conference. He has seven games
left to get the 71.
All-time leader is Oregon State's Dave Ganihee, who set the mark
last year when he finished his career with 908 conference points.
Smart, with 838, stands third in league history and should shortly be
second. Currently second is another Husky, Boh lloubregs, who
potted 855 points in three seasons between 1951 and 1953.
AWARD OF THE YEAR: The Oregon Sports Award banquet in
Portland, which featured Jack Curtice as guest speaker, came up
with the year's top award. WSC football coach Jim Sutherland was
presented with a "No Bowl" trophy for his Cougar team of last year.
Referring to WSC's Southland-blocked bowl bid, the inscription bore
the words of CCLA Athletic Director Wilbur Johns: "Rules are made

Back Down to Business

Stanford's little vacation is over and Friday night the Indians
return for the do or die stretch run, meeting high-scoring IK'I,A*. Sat
urday, it's next-to-last, but still dangerous, Oregon.
Another loss would be killing. The Cards achieved the desired

Cal • Washington race thai was

Cal si ill faces home games with
Oregon, I CI.A, Southern Cal,
Washington State and Oregon
State. The Bears still face that
rugged throe - game northern
swing, over the Washington's
Birthday holiday: WSC on Fri
day, Idaho on Saturday and Ore
gon State, Monday.
This could be a killer for the
Bears, More and more is Idaho
loming as the spoiler of the con
ference just like last year. Af
ter a most ineffective start, the
Vandals warmed up to a 91-87 up
set over UCLA Saturday night.
Cal, which was in turn stung—
and then helped by Idaho last
year, still faces that tough
cow game.
For the short-memoried ones:a

Idaho bounced Cal last season, 82-71, a week before (he season ended
apparently handing the l'(title to Oregon State. Cut the Vandals
showed no favoritism, strangely—for on the last night of the season
they bopped OSC to throw things back into a tie. Cal went on to win
the playoff for an NCAA berth.
Washington State isn't going the rest of the way wilhout another
win, either. The Cougars shocked UCLA, 71-54, earlier in the season
giving some evidence that new Coach Marv llarshman really has
made them one of the loop's most improved fives.
Huskies Musi Play Vandals. Too
But don't be alarmed, Bears, for Washington hasn't even played
Idaho yet, at. home or away. And the Huskies have to close their
season in Los Angeles March 6 and 7. Seeing that they're buddies
with the Soiithlanders, maybe nothing will happen.
Oregon State is still around, too. But for a shocking upset by
Oregon last week, the Beavers would be tied with Washington for
second place.
However, the Beavers lost their amazing guard, Lee Harman, in
their Saturday win over WSC. Harman started, but was out of action
early with a badly sprained ankle. He didn't score and also saw his
league scoring lead shattered. Because of the injury, llarman's per

of Flgin Baylors and Wilt Chamberlains, who chased him to the
crown last year. While Big O was scoring 21 Saturday, Marshall's
second-place Leo Byrd tanked 38 to creep a little closer.
Torrenee's latest surge now installs him as the temporary favor
ite to cop the PCC scoring crown. But that loop scoring lead has been
a very popular position this season as five men have held it so far
(in six weeks): Denny Fitzpatrick of Cal, Neumann, Smart (for two
weeks), Harman and now Torrence.
Smart, however, need not become too concerned if he doesn't cap
ture the crown. For a mere matter of 71 points separates him from
the all-time scoring leadership of the conference. He has seven games
left to get the 71.
All-time leader is Oregon State's Dave Ganihee, who set the mark
last year when he finished his career with 908 conference points.
Smart, with 838, stands third in league history and should shortly be
second. Currently second is another Husky, Boh lloubregs, who
potted 855 points in three seasons between 1951 and 1953.
AWARD OF THE YEAR: The Oregon Sports Award banquet in
Portland, which featured Jack Curtice as guest speaker, came up
with the year's top award. WSC football coach Jim Sutherland was
presented with a "No Bowl" trophy for his Cougar team of last year.
Referring to WSC's Southland-blocked bowl bid, the inscription bore
the words of CCLA Athletic Director Wilbur Johns: "Rules are made
to he observed."


WALT TORRENCE
A new scoring leader
Back Down to Business
And now to got down to business in this T k a<-ii'ic* Coast Conference
basketball race. li sure would bo nice if somebody would win besides
t ho- Bears.
Stanford's little vacation is over and Friday night the Indians
return for the do or die stretch run, meeting high-scoring IK'I,A*. Sat
urday, it's next-to-last, but still dangerous, Oregon.
Another loss would be killing. The Cards achieved the desired
split of the northern Oregon-Washington series, but ( al's two week
end victories make it look lige 11-5 is not going to win the PCC- as
everyone seemed to think a few weeks ago. And, finally, it looks a

little bit like we may have the
Cal • Washington race thai was
pi edicted all along.
Cal si ill faces home games with
Oregon, I CI.A, Southern Cal,
Washington State and Oregon
State. The Bears still face that
rugged throe - game northern
swing, over the Washington's
Birthday holiday: WSC on Fri
day, Idaho on Saturday and Ore
gon State, Monday.
This could be a killer for the
Bears, More and more is Idaho
loming as the spoiler of the con
ference just like last year. Af
ter a most ineffective start, the
Vandals warmed up to a 91-87 up
set over UCLA Saturday night.
Cal, which was in turn stung—
and then helped by Idaho last
year, still faces that tough
cow game.
For the short-memoried ones:a

Idaho bounced Cal last season, 82-71, a week before (he season ended
apparently handing the l'(title to Oregon State. Cut the Vandals
showed no favoritism, strangely—for on the last night of the season
they bopped OSC to throw things back into a tie. Cal went on to win
the playoff for an NCAA berth.
Washington State isn't going the rest of the way wilhout another
win, either. The Cougars shocked UCLA, 71-54, earlier in the season
giving some evidence that new Coach Marv llarshman really has
made them one of the loop's most improved fives.
Huskies Musi Play Vandals. Too
But don't be alarmed, Bears, for Washington hasn't even played
Idaho yet, at. home or away. And the Huskies have to close their
season in Los Angeles March 6 and 7. Seeing that they're buddies
with the Soiithlanders, maybe nothing will happen.
Oregon State is still around, too. But for a shocking upset by
Oregon last week, the Beavers would be tied with Washington for
second place.
However, the Beavers lost their amazing guard, Lee Harman, in
their Saturday win over WSC. Harman started, but was out of action
early with a badly sprained ankle. He didn't score and also saw his
league scoring lead shattered. Because of the injury, llarman's per
game average dropped suddenly from 20.3 to 18.3.
Probably wouldn't have made much difference anyway, for down
south, UCLA's Wall Torrence was gunning 38 points in a losing ef
fort against Idaho, and he suddenly flew into the lead, with 185 points
in nine games for a 20.(i average.
There have been four 30-plus nights for PCCers this season:
Torrenee's 38, l>oug Smart of Washington with 35 against UCLA
and 31 against Oregon Stab', and llarrnan with 33 against Idaho.
Other high marks: 28 and 20, by Harman against Oregon and
Washington Slate; 2(5, by Stanford's Paul Neumann against OSC; 20
by the Beavers' Jim Woodland in I he same game; 20 by Idaho's John
Liveious, opposite Torrenee's 38-point trick last week; 28 by Oregon's
Dale Herron against OSC, and 27 Friday night by Bruno Boin ol'
Washington against WSC.
Forrence (Jinihs in Ranking
Torrence, who had climbed to 34th in national scoring through
last week, now has upped his season's average to 21.0. That would
have been good enough to place him 20th last week.
In national scoring, the spread between ninth place, held by Ed
Blair of Western Michigan, and 52nd place, held by Boh Skousen of
Brigham Young, is only 4.2 points 23.2 to 19.0. On the other hand,
9.7 points separated leader Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati and Blair.
Robertson may yet get a run for his money, even in the absence
of Flgin Baylors and Wilt Chamberlains, who chased him to the
crown last year. While Big O was scoring 21 Saturday, Marshall's
second-place Leo Byrd tanked 38 to creep a little closer.
Torrenee's latest surge now installs him as the temporary favor
ite to cop the PCC scoring crown. But that loop scoring lead has been
a very popular position this season as five men have held it so far
(in six weeks): Denny Fitzpatrick of Cal, Neumann, Smart (for two

Smart, however, need not become too concerned if he doesn't cap
ture the crown. For a mere matter of 71 points separates him from
the all-time scoring leadership of the conference. He has seven games
left to get the 71.
All-time leader is Oregon State's Dave Ganihee, who set the mark
last year when he finished his career with 908 conference points.
Smart, with 838, stands third in league history and should shortly be
second. Currently second is another Husky, Boh lloubregs, who
potted 855 points in three seasons between 1951 and 1953.
