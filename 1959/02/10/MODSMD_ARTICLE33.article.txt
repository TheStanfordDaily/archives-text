THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SMOOCH
Back in my courting days (the raccoon coat, was all the rage,
everybody was singing (!ood Morning, Muter Zip Zip Zip, and
young Bonaparte had just left Corsica), back, 1 say, in iny
courting clays, the standard way to melt a uirl's heart was to
write poetry t<» her.
I don't understand why young men today have abandoned
this gambit. 'I liere is nothing Iik« j poetry for moving a difficult
girl. What's more, poems are ridiculously easy to write. The
range of subjects i endless. You can write a poem about a girl's
hair, her eyes, her lips, her walk, her talk, her clothes—anything
at all. Indeed, one of my most effective love lyrics was called
'Jo Maud's I'iiiell Box. If went like this:

In your (bar hllh leather die pencil box.
A re pencils of yellow anil red,
A nil if noil don I tell me yon lore we soon, '
I'll hit yon on lop of the head.
Honesty compels me to admit that tliis poem fell short of
success. Nothing daunted, 1 wrote another one. This time 1
pulled a switch; I threatened myself instead of Maud.
Oh, Maud, pray slop this drivel
A nil fell me you'll he mine,
For my sure/breads they do shrirel
A nil wind around my spine.
My heart doth cease its beating,
My spleen uncoils and warps,
My liver stops secreting
Soon I needs be a corpse.
When 11 lis heart-rending ballad failed to win Mauri, T could
only conclude (hat slie was cruel and heartless and 1 was better
off without her. Accordingly I took back my l!i-Y pin, bade her
adieu, and have not clapped eyes on her since. Last I heard,
she was working in Galveston as a I'limsoll line.
But I did not mourn Maud long, for after Maud came Doris—
1 )oris of the laughing eyes, 1 )oris of (he shimmering hair, I)oris
of the golden tibiae! Within moments of meeting her, I whipped
up a torrent of trochaic tetrameter:
Oh, my sweet and dulcet Doris!
/ love you Hire a Philip Morris
With its mild and rich tobacco
Iii its white and scarlet pack-o.
I'd swim from Louisnilh to Natchez
For I'hilip Morris and you and matches.
Well, of course, the dear girl couldn't resist a poem like that
— what girl could? and she instantly became my slave. For
the rest of the semester she carried my books, washed my car,
and cored my apples. There is no telling where it all would
have ended if .she hadn't been drafted.
So, men, you can -ee the power of poetry. Try it yourself. All
you need i< a rhyming dictionary, a quill pen, and a second
hand muse. CMHtt, Mai Skulraaa
I I I
Lei's drnp rht/nir anil turn to reason. The reason Marlboro
has yone to llie lit ail of the filter eif/arelte class is simple:
better " makin's" ~n flavor that pleases, a litter that tanks.

Back in my courting days (the raccoon coat, was all the rage,
everybody was singing (!ood Morning, Muter Zip Zip Zip, and
young Bonaparte had just left Corsica), back, 1 say, in iny
courting clays, the standard way to melt a uirl's heart was to
write poetry t<» her.
I don't understand why young men today have abandoned
this gambit. 'I liere is nothing Iik« j poetry for moving a difficult
girl. What's more, poems are ridiculously easy to write. The
range of subjects i endless. You can write a poem about a girl's
hair, her eyes, her lips, her walk, her talk, her clothes—anything
at all. Indeed, one of my most effective love lyrics was called
'Jo Maud's I'iiiell Box. If went like this:

In your (bar hllh leather die pencil box.
A re pencils of yellow anil red,
A nil if noil don I tell me yon lore we soon, '
I'll hit yon on lop of the head.
Honesty compels me to admit that tliis poem fell short of
success. Nothing daunted, 1 wrote another one. This time 1
pulled a switch; I threatened myself instead of Maud.
Oh, Maud, pray slop this drivel
A nil fell me you'll he mine,
For my sure/breads they do shrirel
A nil wind around my spine.
My heart doth cease its beating,
My spleen uncoils and warps,
My liver stops secreting
Soon I needs be a corpse.
When 11 lis heart-rending ballad failed to win Mauri, T could
only conclude (hat slie was cruel and heartless and 1 was better
off without her. Accordingly I took back my l!i-Y pin, bade her
adieu, and have not clapped eyes on her since. Last I heard,
she was working in Galveston as a I'limsoll line.
But I did not mourn Maud long, for after Maud came Doris—
1 )oris of the laughing eyes, 1 )oris of (he shimmering hair, I)oris
of the golden tibiae! Within moments of meeting her, I whipped
up a torrent of trochaic tetrameter:
Oh, my sweet and dulcet Doris!
/ love you Hire a Philip Morris
With its mild and rich tobacco
Iii its white and scarlet pack-o.
I'd swim from Louisnilh to Natchez
For I'hilip Morris and you and matches.
Well, of course, the dear girl couldn't resist a poem like that
— what girl could? and she instantly became my slave. For
the rest of the semester she carried my books, washed my car,
and cored my apples. There is no telling where it all would
have ended if .she hadn't been drafted.
So, men, you can -ee the power of poetry. Try it yourself. All
you need i< a rhyming dictionary, a quill pen, and a second
hand muse. CMHtt, Mai Skulraaa
