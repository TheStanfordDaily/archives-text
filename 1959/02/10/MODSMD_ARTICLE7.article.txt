### 
WASHINGTON' (/P)—Secretary
of State Dulles believes the So
viets will "keep the pressure on
until the very last minute" in Ber
lin and, generally, will follow a
tougher cold war line.
In Congressional testimony
made public Sunday, Dulles called
on Jan. 28 for a Western stand
fast in Berlin. At the same time
he said he sees no way to pull out
of Quemoy and Matsu now with
out free world loss of the whole
Far East.
No Split Widening
Dulles said he detected no split
widening between Russia and Red
China, nor any change in Red
China's policy as a result of Mao
T/.c-tung's announced decision to
step down as head of the govern
ment.
Dulles spoke in a closed session
of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee before leaving on his
current visit to Europe. The com
mittee gave out a censored ver
sion of his testimony Sunday.
Denounces Soviet Plan
The Secretary of State de
nounced the Soviet plan for big
power withdrawal from Berlin by
May 27 and said NATO military
men — not the Pentagon — have
ruled out as "military very disad
vantageous to the West" Poland's
Rapacki plan for a pullback of big
power troops.
Likening Quemoy and Matsu to
West Berlin, Dulles said abandon
ment of the Nationalist-held off
shore islands to Red China with
out Chiang Kai-shek's okay would
touch off a chain reaction losing
all of the Far East to the free
world. Chiang has opposed with
drawing from the small islands.
