University action.)
On Friday, Jan. 30, a fraternity sponsored party was held at Union
Hall in Los Altos. The Los Altos police assisted by Alcoholic Bever
age Control officers closed the party at 12:15 a.m. A full report was
made to the Dean of Men at Stanford University by the Chief of
Police, Los Altos, and Mr. Charles N. Thompson, ABC Agent.
The case was referred to the IFC Judicial Council. The action
recommended by the Council proved unacceptable to the office of
the Dean of Men. The IFC recommendation would impose suspended
social probation on seven fraternities and two Con Home hours for
every man in these houses. They further recommended that no sub-

sequent fraternity party involve
more than three fraternities. The
seriousness of this breach of ac
ceptable social conduct calls for
more stringent action.
On October 22, 1957, the IFC
Judicial Council placed Zeta Psi
on disciplinary probation, stipu
lating that further violations
would result in suspension of the
fraternity. It is clear that Zeta
Psi helped sponsor the Los Altos
party, therefore the chapter is
suspended as of this date for the
remainder of the academic year.
The house will be closed as a fra
ternity and the members moved
out by February 23rd. No more
than three members will be al
lowed to room together for the
remainder of the academic year.
The fraternity will be allowed to
return to the campus fall quarter,
1959, under a two-year probation,
the conditions stipulating that
failure to comply with acceptable
social standards as interpreted by
the University will be cause for

suspension of the chapter from Stanford.
Phi Gamma Delta, as host house, organized and managed the
party. Members of this fraternity purchased the beer, hired the hall
and provided for the entertainment. Greater responsibility fell to this
group and they are therefore suspended from the campus for the re
mainder of the academic year with probation through the academic
year 1959-60. The house is to be vacated by February 23rd.
The Bela Theta Pi fraternity supported the party financially and
as a house function, and are therefore placed on social probation for
the remainder of the academic year. They may register no social
functions for the remainder of the academic year. Probation con
tinues for the academic year 1959-60, conditions state that violations
of socially acceptable standards will be basis for suspension of the
chapter from the University.
The following three houses are hereby placed on social probation
for the remainder of winter quarter and on probation through the
academic year 1959-60: Sigma Chi, Phi Delta Theta, Delta Kappa
Epsilon. It should be pointed out that the Sigma Chi house supported
the party as a house function. However their past two-year record
as a strong positive force in the fraternity system has been taken
into account.
Although Delta Tau Delta attended the party in numbers, recog
nition is made of official action of their house on January 27th not
to attend the party as a house function. Consequently tlicy arc placed
on probation through the academic year 1959-60.
With the exception of Zeta Psi and Phi Gamma Delta, the above
named fraternities arc eligible to participate in Greek Week and
rushing as scheduled.

On Friday, Jan. 30, a fraternity sponsored party was held at Union
Hall in Los Altos. The Los Altos police assisted by Alcoholic Bever
age Control officers closed the party at 12:15 a.m. A full report was
made to the Dean of Men at Stanford University by the Chief of
Police, Los Altos, and Mr. Charles N. Thompson, ABC Agent.
The case was referred to the IFC Judicial Council. The action
recommended by the Council proved unacceptable to the office of
the Dean of Men. The IFC recommendation would impose suspended
social probation on seven fraternities and two Con Home hours for
every man in these houses. They further recommended that no sub-

sequent fraternity party involve
more than three fraternities. The
seriousness of this breach of ac
ceptable social conduct calls for
more stringent action.
On October 22, 1957, the IFC
Judicial Council placed Zeta Psi
on disciplinary probation, stipu
lating that further violations
would result in suspension of the
fraternity. It is clear that Zeta
Psi helped sponsor the Los Altos
party, therefore the chapter is
suspended as of this date for the
remainder of the academic year.
The house will be closed as a fra
ternity and the members moved
out by February 23rd. No more
than three members will be al
lowed to room together for the
remainder of the academic year.
The fraternity will be allowed to
return to the campus fall quarter,
1959, under a two-year probation,
the conditions stipulating that
failure to comply with acceptable
social standards as interpreted by
the University will be cause for

suspension of the chapter from Stanford.
Phi Gamma Delta, as host house, organized and managed the
party. Members of this fraternity purchased the beer, hired the hall
and provided for the entertainment. Greater responsibility fell to this
group and they are therefore suspended from the campus for the re
mainder of the academic year with probation through the academic
year 1959-60. The house is to be vacated by February 23rd.
The Bela Theta Pi fraternity supported the party financially and
as a house function, and are therefore placed on social probation for
the remainder of the academic year. They may register no social
functions for the remainder of the academic year. Probation con
tinues for the academic year 1959-60, conditions state that violations
of socially acceptable standards will be basis for suspension of the
chapter from the University.
The following three houses are hereby placed on social probation
for the remainder of winter quarter and on probation through the
academic year 1959-60: Sigma Chi, Phi Delta Theta, Delta Kappa
Epsilon. It should be pointed out that the Sigma Chi house supported
the party as a house function. However their past two-year record
as a strong positive force in the fraternity system has been taken
into account.
Although Delta Tau Delta attended the party in numbers, recog
