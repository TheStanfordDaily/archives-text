# Series Traces Censors
## 
### Gary Wright 
The plight of the "bibliophobe"
was traced in last night's lecture
of the Tuesday Evening Series and
was well explained by Professor
John Henry Merryman, librarian
of the L;iw School.
The bibliophobe is defined as a
book-burner or censor, and his
purpose in life appears to tie guid
ing people along the path of "de
cent" literature, according to Pro
fessor Merryman.
Throughout history the problem
of legal censorship has burdened
the minds and morals of men
and apparently all in vain. Ob
scenity is a serious social problem,
but it is not up to mere laws to
deal with it.

The reading of pornographic lit
erature has never been connected
with actual criminal tendencies, as
the vast, majority of commonly
termed "juvenile delinquents" do
not read the literature in question.
In many cases where il is read,
the "dirty" books tend to serve as
an emotional valve in curbing ac
tual deeds.
Rooks Near Bottom
As to the sources found to be
most sexually stimulating to .'i
group of prominent women, book's
were found to be near the very
bottom of their lists, with men
ranking highest in feminine
minds.
According to most authorities
laws and statutes are not the
means for curbing obscenity viola
tions, as there is no legal defini
tion of obscenity. The word is sub
ject to mood and incident alone.
In most instances the banning
of a particular work is an instan
taneous sign of its future success.
The celebrated painting "Sep
tember Morn" was on display in a
store window. A group of boys
were hired to gather around the
display, and a policeman was no
tified by the owner of the picture.
Consequently, an eventual seven
million copies of the picture were
vsold and the original painting
was sold for $10,000.
Censorship
Political and religious forces
often use thr censorship situation
to bring force against booksellers
legally within the law, thereby
technically misusing their own
public laws. Perhaps taste, molal
ity and religion are better left to
the quiet of the home front.
As suggested, the ideal solution
to the problem is to allow children
to learn about the world and its
people through literature in their
own home library.
