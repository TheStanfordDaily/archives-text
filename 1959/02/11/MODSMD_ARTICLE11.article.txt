# MEDICAL SCHOOL
## Last Students to Leave San Francisco Hospital 
### 
Stanford Medical School will withdraw the last of its students from
San Francisco Hospital on July 1 and the remainder of its faculty
by July 1960.
At present, Stanford shares the service at the hospital with the
University of California Medical School. After July 1, the latter will

take over the entire load.
The Medical School is severing
its connections with the hospital
because of its plans to move to
new quarters here on campus.
The association of the hospital
and the Medical School has been
advantageous to both parties in
the past. Medical students, in
terns and residents had access to
plenty of patients on whom to
practice.
San Francisco received, at little
cost to the taxpayer, excellent care
for its financially needy patients.
Universities Pay
Under the present system, Ihc
two universities pay the costs of
laboratory work at the city hospi
tal.
Under a new contract with Cali
fornia, the city will assume the
expense of running and staffing
the laboratories. This is estimated
as costing the city as much as
$200,000 a year.
The now Stanford Medical Cen
ter will include over 12 acres of
floor space and is scheduled to be
ready for autumn 1959 classes.
The facilities will be used by the
medical students and by the I'alo
Alto Stanford Hospital.
$18 Million Collected
The $22 million Center is one of
the largest medical construction
programs currently being under
taken in the country. At present
approximately $18 million has
been collected. The University
may have to cut coiners during
const ruet ion.
Initially the three-story Center
will consist of three hospital and
112 o u r Medical School buildings.
They will be interconnected
around open courtyards and pa
tios to form a "garden hospital."
