WASHINGTON (/!') -President
Eisenhower said Tuesday that
U.S. planes arc under strict or
ders not to play games designed
to slir up Soviet interceptors
along the Turkish borders.
Eisenhower told a news confer
ence, however, that "once in a
while we believe there are false
radio signals that will take a
plane out of course."
That was injected into a discus
sion of the crash last September
of an unarmed American trans
port plane just inside Soviet Ar
menia.
As for cutting his $3V& billion
foreign aid fund in order to off
set higher spending Democrats in
Congress propose for airports and
housing, Eisenhower said firmly
that "I could think of no policy
that was more destructive of
America's vast interests in the
world."
Concerning the government an
nouncement that unemployment
climbed by 616,000 last month to
4,724,000, Eisenhower said this
was "really less than seasonal fac
tors would normally compel." But
it brought unemployment for Ihe
month to the highest point since
1941.
