Council Comments
Editor, The Daily:
The purpose of this letter is to
express the IFC Judicial Council's
dissatisfaction with the decision
of the Dean of Men, Dean of Stu
dents and the office of the Presi
dent concerning the fraternity
sponsored party held at Los Altos
on Jan. 30.
After a careful consideration of
the facts submitted by the Los
Altos police department and re
ports of those fraternity men
present, the Council imposed a
penalty of suspended social proba
tion and two Con Home hours per
man for each house involved. This
decision from the body dealing
with fraternity violations was re
jected. We feel that our ability to
function as a judicial body has
been seriously impaired, and that
the incentive fur student-adminis
trative co-operation has been
greatly retarded. We are very
hopeful that in the future we may
assume a more responsible posi
tion and be granted due consider
ation for what we believe to be
our proper function.

Stood for Average Men
Editor, The Daily:
At long last the administration
has stood up for the great mass
of average men, the basis of all
soical progress and the American
idea that the supreme truth is the
will of the majority.
There is no doubt that those
few humanity haters, who by
some freak glandular develop
ment consider themselves individ
uals and superior to the common
man, will decry the action. They
will say, "But this party was mild
compared to many in the past and
that everything was fine until the
agency of force arrived and
'feared the party might get out of
hand' and therefore closed the
party and started shoving people l ,
who being slightly high were ir
ritated."

But it is the vast selfless soul of
the majority that decides the ul
timate truths and moral stand
ards in any good society, and if
these students thought they knew
more about what was best for
them than the mass doesâ€”then
their supreme audacity deserves
to be crushed.
They may even exclaim, "But
how can you call throwing a fire
cracker near some woman an as
sault?" Such debasement of and
profane action toward the mother
of sociely deserves ihe strongest
punishment possible.
The path to take was plain. Not
only were these few misfits bla
tantly ignoring the law, but they
attacked the law enforcers. That
was an attack on everything that
socicty is.
I have only one regret. That is
that the Deans did not go far
enough. All the fraternities
should have been closed- instead
only two will fold for good.
But the grossest example of
negligence was given by Dean
Winbigler when he said, ". . . nor
have our investigations indicated
that there is any responsibility
on the part of the Stanford wom
en present." Yet the mere pres
ence of a few men from some of
the fraternities which had noth
ing to do with the organization of
the party or even the support of
the party was enough to punish
the entire house. Therefore it is
a clear case of complete dishon
esty not to punish the residences
of the women present at the par
ty. The underage women knew,
as well as the men, that they were
challenging the authority of the
majority by drinking yet they
did so. Does the Dean mean that
women are not responsible for
their actions?
Unless the entire affair has
merely been a petty, personal at
tempt to punish a lew fraternities
that they dislike, the only honest
thing the Deans can do is to put
all of the women's residences in
volved on two-year social proba
tion and to close Moore and Bran
ner on Feb. 23.
But let us thank Ihe adminis
tration for what they have done.
Society is proud of them.
