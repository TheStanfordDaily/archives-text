Abour the lIR Article
Editor, The Daily:
Our first reaction to the article
entitled "Mid-East Nationalism
fhreatens I nited Nations Inter
nationalism," which appeared in
The Daily on Feb. G, was that its
feeble • minded immaturity and
sheet ignorance called for no com
ment.
However, on reflection, by vir
tue (a) of the presumption that
at least some of your readers will
have read the article, and <h) the
circumstance, beyond our compre
hension, that this article appeared
under the heading of "Ilk Politi
cal Analysis" and therefore pre
sumably had the blessings of that
organization, we felt that such a
flamboyant display of ill - in
formed prejudice should not pass
uncorrected.
The detailed contents of the ar
tide scarcely merit intelligent dis
cussion, but we feel obliged to
offer the following comments:
1) The article is entitled "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism" and
yet not a single reference is made
to any nation or any leading per
sonality of the Middle East, nor,
apart from a passing reference in
the first sentence, is there a sin
gle mention of the United Na
t ions.
The whole tenor of the article
suggests that the writer is much
more concerned with the problem
of the effect of Afro-Asian na
tionalism on United States (com
mercial ) internationalism.
2) "In the first place it ought
to be realized that there is at
present a general absence of
trained natives able to provide in
telligent, mature administration
in at least a large part of the
Afro-Asian area." This is an ex
traordinary statement, coming as
it does from one who purports to
write under the aegis of the lIR,
one of whose declared objectives
is to provide "a continuous pro
gram of education and discussion
in world affairs in order to en
large an informed and under
standing public opinion."
Is the writer not the least in
formed as to how many represen
tatives of these "stone age cul
tures" are now studying in the
Western Hemisphere alone, to
say nothing of the institutions of
higher 1 learning in their own coun
tries? Does the writer not know
how many leaders of the Afro-
Asian nations hold degrees from
the leading universities of the
world? Is ihe writer aware how
many of these untrained natives
are at present studying at Stan
ford, a high proportion of them
for' advanced degrees?
3) The "inarticulate major

premise" upon which this article
is based Is not hard to find. "The
difficulty is . . . that their raw
materials are very useful to the
West. . . . There is some doubt
that these newly independent na
tions will ever be able to see that
their interests lie in complete co
operation will) western Europe
and the United States. . . . These
areas are not only developing ef
fective wills of their own, but,
what is worse, wills which are
generally contrary to our own."
So this is the "Unted Nations
internationalism" which the writ
er is so anxious to defend. In a
word, the independence of the
new nations of Asia* and Africa
provides a threat to the political
and commercial interests of the
United States.
The writer of this article is, of
course, entitled to his own opin
ions, and equally entitled to ex
press them in the columns of The
Daily. That such a display of im
penetrable ignorance and outdat
ed imperialist prejudices should
be published with the apparent
approval of the lIR is regrettable.
That it should be written in osten
sible support for the principles of
the United Nations, were it not
so absurd, would bo outrageous.

Editor, The Daily:
Our first reaction to the article
entitled "Mid-East Nationalism
fhreatens I nited Nations Inter
nationalism," which appeared in
The Daily on Feb. G, was that its
feeble • minded immaturity and
sheet ignorance called for no com
ment.
However, on reflection, by vir
tue (a) of the presumption that
at least some of your readers will
have read the article, and <h) the
circumstance, beyond our compre
hension, that this article appeared
under the heading of "Ilk Politi
cal Analysis" and therefore pre
sumably had the blessings of that
organization, we felt that such a
flamboyant display of ill - in
formed prejudice should not pass
uncorrected.
The detailed contents of the ar
tide scarcely merit intelligent dis
cussion, but we feel obliged to
offer the following comments:
1) The article is entitled "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism" and
yet not a single reference is made
to any nation or any leading per
sonality of the Middle East, nor,
apart from a passing reference in
the first sentence, is there a sin
gle mention of the United Na
t ions.
The whole tenor of the article
suggests that the writer is much
more concerned with the problem
of the effect of Afro-Asian na
tionalism on United States (com
mercial ) internationalism.
2) "In the first place it ought
to be realized that there is at
present a general absence of
trained natives able to provide in
telligent, mature administration
in at least a large part of the
Afro-Asian area." This is an ex
traordinary statement, coming as
it does from one who purports to
write under the aegis of the lIR,
one of whose declared objectives
is to provide "a continuous pro
gram of education and discussion
in world affairs in order to en
large an informed and under
standing public opinion."
Is the writer not the least in
formed as to how many represen
tatives of these "stone age cul
tures" are now studying in the
Western Hemisphere alone, to
say nothing of the institutions of
higher 1 learning in their own coun
tries? Does the writer not know
how many leaders of the Afro-
Asian nations hold degrees from
the leading universities of the
world? Is ihe writer aware how
many of these untrained natives
are at present studying at Stan
ford, a high proportion of them
for' advanced degrees?
3) The "inarticulate major

premise" upon which this article
is based Is not hard to find. "The
difficulty is . . . that their raw
materials are very useful to the
West. . . . There is some doubt
that these newly independent na
tions will ever be able to see that
their interests lie in complete co
operation will) western Europe
and the United States. . . . These
areas are not only developing ef
fective wills of their own, but,
what is worse, wills which are
generally contrary to our own."
So this is the "Unted Nations
internationalism" which the writ
er is so anxious to defend. In a
word, the independence of the
new nations of Asia* and Africa
provides a threat to the political
and commercial interests of the
United States.
The writer of this article is, of
course, entitled to his own opin
ions, and equally entitled to ex
press them in the columns of The
Daily. That such a display of im
penetrable ignorance and outdat
ed imperialist prejudices should
be published with the apparent
approval of the lIR is regrettable.
That it should be written in osten
sible support for the principles of
the United Nations, were it not
so absurd, would bo outrageous.

Editor, The Daily:
Our first reaction to the article
entitled "Mid-East Nationalism
fhreatens I nited Nations Inter
nationalism," which appeared in
The Daily on Feb. G, was that its
feeble • minded immaturity and
sheet ignorance called for no com
ment.
However, on reflection, by vir
tue (a) of the presumption that
at least some of your readers will
have read the article, and <h) the
circumstance, beyond our compre
hension, that this article appeared
under the heading of "Ilk Politi
cal Analysis" and therefore pre
sumably had the blessings of that
organization, we felt that such a
flamboyant display of ill - in
formed prejudice should not pass
uncorrected.
The detailed contents of the ar
tide scarcely merit intelligent dis
cussion, but we feel obliged to
offer the following comments:
1) The article is entitled "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism" and
yet not a single reference is made
to any nation or any leading per
sonality of the Middle East, nor,
apart from a passing reference in
the first sentence, is there a sin
gle mention of the United Na
t ions.
The whole tenor of the article
suggests that the writer is much
more concerned with the problem
of the effect of Afro-Asian na
tionalism on United States (com
mercial ) internationalism.
2) "In the first place it ought
to be realized that there is at
present a general absence of
trained natives able to provide in
telligent, mature administration
in at least a large part of the
Afro-Asian area." This is an ex
traordinary statement, coming as
it does from one who purports to
write under the aegis of the lIR,
one of whose declared objectives
is to provide "a continuous pro
gram of education and discussion
in world affairs in order to en
large an informed and under
standing public opinion."
Is the writer not the least in
formed as to how many represen
tatives of these "stone age cul
tures" are now studying in the
Western Hemisphere alone, to
say nothing of the institutions of
higher 1 learning in their own coun
tries? Does the writer not know
how many leaders of the Afro-
Asian nations hold degrees from
the leading universities of the
world? Is ihe writer aware how
many of these untrained natives
are at present studying at Stan
ford, a high proportion of them
for' advanced degrees?
3) The "inarticulate major

premise" upon which this article
is based Is not hard to find. "The
difficulty is . . . that their raw
materials are very useful to the
West. . . . There is some doubt
that these newly independent na
tions will ever be able to see that
their interests lie in complete co
operation will) western Europe
and the United States. . . . These
areas are not only developing ef
fective wills of their own, but,
what is worse, wills which are
generally contrary to our own."
