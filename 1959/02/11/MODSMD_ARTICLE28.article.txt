# Stanford Cagers Face Tougher Duck Team
## 
### 
If Stanford is still in iho Pacific Coast Conference basketball race,
ii is going to have to lie proven this weekend.
The Indians return lo action, after almost two weeks, Friday night
against Die high-scoring UCLA Bruins and Saturday night take on
a dangerous Oregon five. Stanford is 5-1 in conference play and cur-

rently tied with UCLA for fourth
place in Ihe standings.
The Bruins wen! into last
week's play in first place, but
were nipped on successive nights
by California, 60-58, and by Idaho,
!>! 87. Oregon, meanwhile, has
been on the rebound in conference
play and comes into the Bay Area
with a two-game win streak.

The Ducks were downed by a
big Stanford second half two
weeks ago in Eugene, and then
lost on the next night to Oregon
Stale. But last Eriday the Web
fools took OSC into camp, 73-68,

in a major upset and Monday
ihey made il two straight with a
(il 5-J triumph over last place
Washington Stale.
Ducks Balanced
Coach Sieve Belko's Ducks pre
sent one of the most balanced at
tacks in Ihe PCC. Backcourt
sparkplug is junior guard Chuck
Bask, who had one half of glory
when Stanford met Oregon in Eu
gene two weeks ago.
In that one, Bask held Stan
ford's star guard, Paul Neumann,
lo one field goal in the first half
while Bask was scoring nine him
self. The second half, however,
saw Neumann score 17 while
Bask managed only one and the
entire Tribe "left" the Ducks in
similar fashion.
Teaming with Rask in the back
court is set-shooting senior Bud
Kuykendall, a steady veteran.
Oregon poses a fine one-two
threat at the forwards with jun
iors Dale Herron and Stu Robert
son, both 6-5. Ilerron has been the
hottest of the Ducks lately, pot
ting 28 against OSC two weeks
ago and 18 in the winning effort
over the Beavers Friday.
Anderson Moves Up
Sophomore Denny Strickland,
also 6-5, has been getting a battle
from junior Jerry Anderson, 6-4,
for the fifth starting spot. Strick
land was the Webfoots' hottest
pre-season scorer, counting one
28-point effort against Tulsa, but
has not been able to hit that
stride in conference play.
For balance, the scoring aver
ages of the Oregon starters: Her
ron, 12.6; Robertson, 11.7; Rask,
11.5; Kuykendall, 10.0, and
Strickland, G.<l.
