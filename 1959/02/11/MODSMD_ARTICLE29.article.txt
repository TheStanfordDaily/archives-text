10, Coach Bill Turner was able to
empty the bench long before the
first half was over. The final
score of the contest was 63-39 for
the frosh as 14 players broke into
ihe Stanford scoring column.
John Windsor, trie Papooses'
6-7 center, may well be trying for
a repeat of his last performance
against a junior college team
when the frosh tangle with San
Francisco City College.
Windsor hit a frosh season high
of 30 points last month against
Diablo Valley Junior College.
