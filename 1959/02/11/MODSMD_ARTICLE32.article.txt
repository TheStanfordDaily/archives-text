The meet Friday with UCLA
appears little more than a hard
J workout for the strong Stanford

biggest competition in this year's
PCC race.
Trojans Best Fver

I Southern California high school
j talent, look their strongest ever
j this year.
Home meets will continue to be
held at the men's pool, but this
year there will be an admission
charge for all the meets, in oppo
sition to last year's policy of
charging for only certain meets.

The prices will be DO cents for
Stanford students, and $1 for ad
ults.
After more than one quarter of I
hard practice, the Stanford team
looks strong in all areas, especial
ly in the breaststroke, butterfly
and I lie freestyle sprints.
