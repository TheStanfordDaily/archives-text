"Mon crayon est sur la table. Mon crayon
est blu, vert, jaune ou rouge. Comment al
lez-vous? Tout va bicn ici."
This is what six Phi Kappa Sigmas
"dream" every night.
A phonograph on the sleeping porch is
teaching them French while they sleep. The
records play one hour at about midnight
and repeat the performance from about
5:30 to 6:30 each morning.
The system is only a five-day project,
however, as all have to listen at the same
time to the record, and they come stringing
in at all hours over the weekend, which
would burn up the phonograph.
Although all the group is on the sleeping
porch, the records don't bother tin- other
brothers . . . "except when some guys leave
the speakers lying around on the floor."
Steve Hooper, initiator of the innovation,
admitted that it is a little hard to get to
sleep for the first three days. I fe listened
to a relaxation record to condition him into
getting to sleep.
John Bohn tried it for one week, but did
n't get any sleep with it. It was a novelty
and "everyone tried it sometime."
What's It Like?
What's this record like? A man talks in
a sleepy voice about babbling brooks, soft
breezes, whispering trees. "At first 1 got
so mad at him that I want to kill him, but
now I fall asleep as soon as I hear his
voice," said Hooper.
"It's all repetition," he added. "You're

supposed to road the text, and listen to Hi' 1
word right before you go to sleep, then
play the record again while you sleep."
.Ron Rankin, who has never had French he
fore is following this procedure, and has

been learning more than anyone else in Ihe
two-month period Ihis has been going on.
The record is only for grammar.
This method was originally used by the
Army in training spies to learn languages
quickly. It teaches conversational French
and perfects pronunciation with little con
scious effort by the pupil.
The reason for all this? Ron Rankin,
Rich Guggenheim, Ron Iverson and Dick
Ogden are planning to go to Europe this
summer. This is an easy way to learn con
versation.
I low Did It start?
How riirl all this start? Steve Hooper saw
a Cambridge Pacific Institute of Berkeley
ad for sleep learning and decided to investi
gate it. 110 paid $sf) for 18 sides of a French
record. Each side is to be played for one
week.
The CPI has more than just language rec
ords. In fact, its main business is in "nov
elty" records: weight reduction, relaxation,
wiil power, memory. There is even one to
slop lit lie kifls from wetting their beds.
Sell • confidence records were used by
Chrysler Corporation in training their sales
men. A convict in Visalia is using them
also in an experiment conducted by the
prison psychiatrist.
This may be. as Hooper pointed out, a bit
exaggerated for the sake of advertising, but
it is still impressive.
The Beta house is now planning to start
on a Russian course. Looks like the fever
is spreading.
