# BOUNDARIES
## Liquor Bill Introduced 
### 
A bill to prevent, nine Palo Alto
liquor establishments from losing
their licenses went into the Cali
fornia legislative mill yesterday.
Assemblyman Clark Bradley of
San Jose introduced Assembly
Bill No. 1312 ;i measure designed
to protect the nine businesses
from a Stanford boundary
change.
Occupancy of new housing
units in September will necessi
tate a change in campus bound
aries, and hence a change in a
limit. State law prohib
its sale of liquor within V/z miles
of a university.
The coming change will move
the limit past the nine establish
ments in question. Bradley's
measure provides that they can
remain in business, but that no
new licenses can be issued within
the limit.
Any of the nine licenses can be
transferred, but cannot come clos
er to campus than their present,
locations. The bill does not in any
way change the basic 1 '1' - mile
law, but only provides these spe
cific exceptions.
Should boundaries move fur
ther at some time in the future,
another bill would be required to
protect other establishments that
might be affected.
Bradley told The Daily he an
ticipates no trouble in the bill's
passing. Since no companion bill
was introduced in the State Sen
ate, Bradley's measure must first
clear the Assembly, then the Sen
ate, and then gain the approval of
Governor Brown.
