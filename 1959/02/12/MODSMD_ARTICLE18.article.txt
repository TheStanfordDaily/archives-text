# Worthwhile Action
## 
### 
Legislature will vole tonight on bylaw amendments designed
to improve the efficiency aiul cooperation between the Judicial
Council and the Fundamental Standard and Honor (lode Coin
mission.
The changes have been drafted by a Legislature investigating
committee, which examined the two groups at length. The changes
have the full support of the commission and the council perhaps
a surprising development, considering the battles which have gone
011 between the two groups in previous years.
We think the proposals are good ones. Hut, even more, we
are impressed by the manner in which lliey have been presented
and the effort thai has gone into the over-all exploration of a
serious student government problem. Il is encouraging lo see
worthwhile action in campus political allairs.
We urge Legislature lo give its approval and support lo (lie
Fun Slan Com bylaw changes.
