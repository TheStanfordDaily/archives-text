# Protest Loyalty Oaths
## 
### 
The presidents of Yale, Harvard and Princeton universilies and
Bryn Mawr, Haverford, Swarlliniore, Bates, Bowdoin and Colby
colleges have protested loyalt\ oath provisions contained in the
National Defense Kdncalion Act.
The act was passed by Congress last year, setting up a $900
million federal aid program of loans for undergraduates and
graduates, and was intended to spur science education.
An applicant for a loan or grant under the act would
be required to sign an oath pledging allegiance t<t the
(',overnrnenl and the Constitution and also sign an affi
davit declaring he did not believe in or support any
snbversive organization.
At first, university and college officials' response to student
protest was that the student could refuse the federal aid and apply
for another type of loan or grant. Since the loyalty oath was a
requisite for receiving the loan, there was nothing the college or
university could do about 'it.
Hut something is being done about it. l\ot only have
tin• presidents of Yale. Harvard and Princeton urged
repeal of the loyalty oatli provisions of the act, but the
40,000-member American Association of I niversity Pro
fessors has announced it will send letters to congressmen
urging repeal of the provision, which Yale's president
A. Whitney Griswold lias said seems "to represent a lack
of confidence in those young people and in their future,
as well as in the educational process itself." 1
Senator John F. Kennedy has promised his support in the
Senate to etfect repeal of the loyalty oath provision.
The Association of American Colleges has voted to poll its
750 member-institutions on the question of demanding repeal of
the loyalt\ oath requirements.
Feeling that loyalty oaths lend to alienate the good will of
the loyal citizen without gaining a corresponding advantage in
protecting the public against the actions or intentions of the dis
loyal, we wish the opponents every success.
