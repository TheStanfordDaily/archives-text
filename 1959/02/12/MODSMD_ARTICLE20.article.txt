Students Don't Grow Up
Editor, The Daily:
In most communities having es
tablished police forces, a person
who threw beer on a uniformed
officer, or injured a girl by throw
ing a cherry bomb next to her,
would be in jail—and would belong
there.
That the local police depart
ments are either so poor or so
cowed by the University that this
has not happened here is astound
ing and disturbing. It is, in addi
tion, another example of the rea
son some Stanford students do not
grow up—they are treated even
more gently by the University and
the subservient police forces than
juveniles are treated by the com
munity.
In -some universities students
are treated as people if they vio
late civil laws they are taken in
hand by the civil authorities; then
if they attract too much notoriety
to their university, they are also
expelled.
It is time the students of this
University were weaned; and if
Mother can't bear to make the
break, I hope the local police forces
will arise and begin to do their
duty.

No Need to Justify
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford fraternity seems
to have all the stigma of the
Southern Negro ghetto: belonging
makes a person part of an igno
rant, inarticulate minority, a
group that could hardly produce
people "who are capable of devel
oping an acceptable set of personal
moral standards," but rather those

who are sunk deep in degradation.
Any responsible individual, how
ever, who is willing to go beyond
emotional considerations and fa
miliarize himself with the situa
tion at hand, should be able to see
that all is not quite so bitter and
bad.
The lackadaisical attitude of the
fraternities in their failure to clar
ify the misrepresentations before
authoritative action was taken
does not stem from an absence of
standards on their part. Instead,
they were unconscious of a need
to justify their position at Union
Hall, knowing that there were no
immoral or flagrant violations of
any social norm.
We do not try, then, to "justify
unjustifiable conduct" but to stifle
the exaggerations and fantasies
that might have influenced Dean
Craig's action.
The prevailing atmosphere and
conduct at the Los Altos party
were not unlike many ASSU-spon
sored beer busts and carnivals
throughout the year.
If, then, it is so appalling that
some 300 Stanford students were
involved, perhaps there is room
for reflection on some of the Uni
versity-approved ASSU functions.
Having the party itself was cer
tainly no social violation, and there
is also no evidence that it was ever
out of control.
If in the past certain of the
ASSU functions have been stopped
by the ABC because of minors'
drinking, and no guilt has been
attached to the organizing body,
then does not an inequality arise
by holding a host fraternity re
sponsible for the same action?
