# Changes May Help Fun Stan Com
## 
### Dick Harries Associate Editor 
More complete and informative
interpretations of the Fundamen
tal Standard and Honor Code will
.soon become available to students
if Legislature votes final passage
on a set of by-law changes to
night.
Proposed by-law amendments,
more clearly define the interpre
tive role of Fundamental Stand
ard and Honor Code Commission,
reduce the size of the group, and
provide for better communica
tions between the commission and
Judicial Council.
Legislature member's Cindy Al
len and John Nickerson submitted
several weeks ago to Legislature
a detailed report of their investi
gation of Fun Stan Com and Ju
dicial Council. They found that
Fun Stan Corn was not function
ing as a strong unit, and that
lines of communication between it
and the council had broken down.
Duplicate Work
During recent years, the two
groups had often done duplicate
work and had even been at
crossed swords on several occa
sions.
Miss Allen and Nickerson con
sulted with members of both
groups and drafted by-laws revi
sions which are intended to better
spell out the functions and co
operative functions of the com
mission and council.

Under the proposals, Fun Stan
Com will now receive reports
from Judicial Council of all im
portant cases coming before the
council. Previously, Fun Stan
Com has not had access to Judi
cial Council proceedings. Only
names and places will be omitted
from the reports. This will en
! able Fun Stan Com to make gen
j eral interpretations of the Funda
! mental Standard and Honor Code,
based partially on Judicial Coun
cil rulings.
Publicize Interpret at ions
It can then make these general
I interpretations known to the stu
| dent body in order that students
may know just where they stand
| in relation 10 the standard and
code. Fun Stan Com will have the
power to make specific interpre
tations of either statute only

! when asked to do so by Judicial ;
Council.
Size of Fun Stan Com will be
reduced from 15 to 10 members
in the hope thai the group will be
of a more workable size. Two of
the 10 members will come from
Judicial Council, further strength
ening ties between the two organi
zat ions.
Sikcs Approves
Hon Sikes, Fun Stan Com presi
dent, thinks the changes will "be
of far-reaching significance in
improving the relationships of I
the two groups.
"As I see it.the changes carry
the implication that Judicial!
! Council will take care of individ- \
uul cases, while Fun Stan Com j
takes care of long-range rulings."
