# University Press Process is Complex

Hey you there, with that
"Bawlout" or that Courses and
Degrees bulletin! Open it to any
page and set it on a flat surface.
Now take your hand away. The
book doesn't stay open very long,
does it ?
Next fall both the Bawlout and
the Courses and Degrees bulletin
will lie flat under the same condi
tions, thanks U> a now method of
binding to be used by the Univer
sity Press.
At present, those publications
are stapled about li inch from
their edges, but a new machine,
just brought to Stanford from
England, will replace tho present
staples willi a strong glue. This
glue will enable the books to re
sist most wear and tear. One will
be able to pick a Bawlout up
by a single page, shake it and not
have the page detach itself from
the rest of the book.
The new machine is one of many
parts to the Press, all of which
are used in printing most of the
University publications. Accord
ing to director Leon Seltzer, Stan
ford University Press has one of
the best medium-size edition bind
cries in the West and the most
fully equipped bindery among col
lege presses.
Originally a small, privately-run
business, the printing plant was
begun by a student, Julius Quelle,

in ISf)2. When ho graduated in
1 St). - ), he began In do most of I ho
University's printing in a 10-foot
square builflitig near the present
t Inion parking area.
In 1!)IT I ho University houghl
the [ji oss from Quelle. a new
building was erected and new
equipment was added. The Press
then moved into its present site.
By l!'2!i the Press had outgrown
its quarters, and (tie building now
housing the composing room, the
pressroom and the bindery was
added.
$1 Million
Serving the University as both
printer and publisher, the Press
does about $1 million in business
a year. Its staff includes 90 per
sons, of which 65 are directly con
cerned with printing.
As a publisher, the Press issues
•10 to 50 new titles a year, most of
which are scholarly books. It
ranks sixth or seventh in college
press output, Harvard being first
with over 100 titles a year.
Editorial policy is governed by
a faculty committee of 10 mem
bers, appointed by the Academic
Council.
The Press editorial staff nor
mally examines about 250 matin

scripts a year, of which the? more
promising are sent out for read
ing by scholars at various univer
sities. The manuscripts receiving
favorable reports are then scruti
nized by the faculty committee at
I licit: monthly meetings.
Of note is the fact that about
40 per cent of the titles published
by the Press are written by fac
ulty members.
As a printer, the plant's equip
mcnt consists of five Linotypes.
II presses 1 letterpress, offset and
a newspaper press), a complete
bindery for hard-bound and paper
back books, pamphlets and period
icals, and a fully equipped pho
tography and plate-making de
partment.
The bindery also has a section
which does all the binding and re
binding for the University Libra
braries.
Book printing is the Press's
main work, and, for practical rea
sons, seldom less than 500 copies
of a book are printed. The aver
age book costs about $7 500 to pro
duce, of which $1,000 is for manu
facturing.
Book in (he .Making
Lot's follow a bonk in the mak
ing. The manuscript has already
been approved by the faculty com
mittee and is on its way to a copy
editor, who will mark up the man
uscript with changes, questions
and suggestions designed to make
it as accurate, clear and consistent
as possible.
While a copy editor is working
on the manuscript, the design de
partment is working on the cover,
the type of paper and print, and
the illustrations. The designer
tries to make the book easy to
read, attractive, and appropriate
to its particular purpose and sub
ject matter.
Illustrations are sen I to the art
department, where they are com
posed to fit spaces allowed in the
book. The Press can handle up to
six colors ■simultaneously in a col
ored illustration.
In printing the cover of the
freshman bulletin four colors
were used. The illustration was
printed separately in black, vol
1

low, red and blue. The yellow |
print was superimposed on the
olack and was followed by the red |
and blue prints. The final prod
uct was a color picture of Inner
Quad.

Returning to the manuscript
which has now been copy-read,
sent to the writer for corrections
and leturned to the Press - il then
goes to the composing room,
where it is set in type on Linotype
machines, which cast lines of type
as a solid piece of metal.
Proofreading
Proofreaders c h e c k gall e y
proofs for errors made in setting
the manuscript into type. Page
proofs are then checked after tlie
galleys of type have been set up
in page form. Press proofs are
made as a last-minute final check.
The book is printed in one of
two ways, either by offset press
or by letterpress.
In the offset method, type
proofs and illustrations are pasted
on sheets of paper, from which a

| large negative is made and a print -
{ ing plate made from the negative,
j In an offset press, the plate is
i inked and pressed against a rub
; ber cylinder, which is doused with
water before it makes contact
with the paper. The greasy ink
! from the imprint of the plate is
j the only thing which prints on the
paper. This method is used in
producing the Chaparral.
Using ihe letterpress method,
I '.}ight, l(j or 32 pages of type are
| locked in an iron frame, from'
| which pages are printed. Paper'
■ rolls off a large cylinder and con
tacts the horizontal forms of ink
ed type.
From the pressroom, the flat
| sheets of printed paper are auto
matically folded in the bindery
'so that they fall in proper se

quence. These folded pages are
called signatures and they form
sections of a book.
Printer! and folded signatures
are stacked in order around a re- j
volving table. They are picked up ,
in sequence by hand and ihen go
to a sewing machine, which stitch-'
es the signatures together at their
folds.
The first and last pages of the I
compiled signatures are thenl
pasted to end papers, which arc
| in turn pasted to the cover. Fin

ished books are stacked in a press,
which stores them under pressure
until ready to be put in the ware
house.
Individual copies of any l>ook
the University Press has printed
may be obtained from them at
retail price.

The bindery also has a section
which does all the binding and re

Book printing is the Press's
main work, and, for practical rea

and suggestions designed to make
it as accurate, clear and consistent
as possible.
While a copy editor is working
on the manuscript, the design de

the type of paper and print, and
the illustrations. The designer
tries to make the book easy to

Illustrations are sen I to the art
department, where they are com
posed to fit spaces allowed in the
book. The Press can handle up to
six colors ■simultaneously in a col

In printing the cover of the
freshman bulletin four colors
were used. The illustration was
printed separately in black, vol

Proofreading

the manuscript into type. Page
proofs are then checked after tlie

made as a last-minute final check.
The book is printed in one of
two ways, either by offset press
or by letterpress.
In the offset method, type
proofs and illustrations are pasted
on sheets of paper, from which a

| large negative is made and a print -
{ ing plate made from the negative,
j In an offset press, the plate is
i inked and pressed against a rub
; ber cylinder, which is doused with
water before it makes contact
with the paper. The greasy ink
! from the imprint of the plate is
j the only thing which prints on the
paper. This method is used in
producing the Chaparral.
Using ihe letterpress method,
I '.}ight, l(j or 32 pages of type are
| locked in an iron frame, from'
| which pages are printed. Paper'
■ rolls off a large cylinder and con
tacts the horizontal forms of ink
ed type.
From the pressroom, the flat
| sheets of printed paper are auto
matically folded in the bindery
'so that they fall in proper se

quence. These folded pages are
called signatures and they form
sections of a book.
Printer! and folded signatures
are stacked in order around a re- j
volving table. They are picked up ,
in sequence by hand and ihen go
to a sewing machine, which stitch-'

folds.
The first and last pages of the I
compiled signatures are thenl
pasted to end papers, which arc

Hey you there, with that
"Bawlout" or that Courses and
Degrees bulletin! Open it to any
page and set it on a flat surface.
Now take your hand away. The
book doesn't stay open very long,
does it ?
Next fall both the Bawlout and
the Courses and Degrees bulletin
will lie flat under the same condi
tions, thanks U> a now method of
binding to be used by the Univer
sity Press.
At present, those publications
are stapled about li inch from
their edges, but a new machine,
just brought to Stanford from
England, will replace tho present
staples willi a strong glue. This
glue will enable the books to re
sist most wear and tear. One will
be able to pick a Bawlout up
by a single page, shake it and not
have the page detach itself from
the rest of the book.
The new machine is one of many
parts to the Press, all of which
are used in printing most of the
University publications. Accord
ing to director Leon Seltzer, Stan
ford University Press has one of
the best medium-size edition bind
cries in the West and the most
fully equipped bindery among col
lege presses.
Originally a small, privately-run
business, the printing plant was
begun by a student, Julius Quelle,

in ISf)2. When ho graduated in
1 St). - ), he began In do most of I ho
University's printing in a 10-foot
square builflitig near the present

$1 Million
Serving the University as both
printer and publisher, the Press
does about $1 million in business
a year. Its staff includes 90 per
sons, of which 65 are directly con
cerned with printing.
As a publisher, the Press issues
•10 to 50 new titles a year, most of
which are scholarly books. It
ranks sixth or seventh in college
press output, Harvard being first
with over 100 titles a year.
Editorial policy is governed by
a faculty committee of 10 mem
bers, appointed by the Academic
Council.
The Press editorial staff nor
mally examines about 250 matin

scripts a year, of which the? more
promising are sent out for read
ing by scholars at various univer
sities. The manuscripts receiving
favorable reports are then scruti
nized by the faculty committee at
I licit: monthly meetings.

Hey you there, with that
"Bawlout" or that Courses and
Degrees bulletin! Open it to any
page and set it on a flat surface.
Now take your hand away. The
book doesn't stay open very long,
does it ?
Next fall both the Bawlout and
the Courses and Degrees bulletin
will lie flat under the same condi
tions, thanks U> a now method of
binding to be used by the Univer
sity Press.
At present, those publications
are stapled about li inch from
their edges, but a new machine,
just brought to Stanford from
England, will replace tho present
staples willi a strong glue. This
glue will enable the books to re
sist most wear and tear. One will
be able to pick a Bawlout up
by a single page, shake it and not
have the page detach itself from
the rest of the book.
The new machine is one of many
parts to the Press, all of which
are used in printing most of the
University publications. Accord
ing to director Leon Seltzer, Stan
ford University Press has one of
the best medium-size edition bind
cries in the West and the most
fully equipped bindery among col
lege presses.
Originally a small, privately-run
business, the printing plant was
begun by a student, Julius Quelle,

in ISf)2. When ho graduated in
1 St). - ), he began In do most of I ho
University's printing in a 10-foot
square builflitig near the present
t Inion parking area.
In 1!)IT I ho University houghl
the [ji oss from Quelle. a new
building was erected and new
equipment was added. The Press
then moved into its present site.
By l!'2!i the Press had outgrown
its quarters, and (tie building now
housing the composing room, the
pressroom and the bindery was
added.
$1 Million
Serving the University as both
printer and publisher, the Press
does about $1 million in business
a year. Its staff includes 90 per
sons, of which 65 are directly con
cerned with printing.
As a publisher, the Press issues
•10 to 50 new titles a year, most of
which are scholarly books. It
ranks sixth or seventh in college
press output, Harvard being first
with over 100 titles a year.
Editorial policy is governed by
a faculty committee of 10 mem
bers, appointed by the Academic
Council.
The Press editorial staff nor
mally examines about 250 matin

scripts a year, of which the? more
promising are sent out for read
ing by scholars at various univer
sities. The manuscripts receiving
favorable reports are then scruti
nized by the faculty committee at
I licit: monthly meetings.
Of note is the fact that about
40 per cent of the titles published
by the Press are written by fac
ulty members.
As a printer, the plant's equip
mcnt consists of five Linotypes.
II presses 1 letterpress, offset and
a newspaper press), a complete
bindery for hard-bound and paper
back books, pamphlets and period
icals, and a fully equipped pho
tography and plate-making de
partment.
The bindery also has a section
which does all the binding and re
binding for the University Libra
braries.
Book printing is the Press's
main work, and, for practical rea
sons, seldom less than 500 copies
of a book are printed. The aver
age book costs about $7 500 to pro
duce, of which $1,000 is for manu
facturing.
Book in (he .Making
Lot's follow a bonk in the mak
ing. The manuscript has already
been approved by the faculty com
mittee and is on its way to a copy
editor, who will mark up the man
uscript with changes, questions
and suggestions designed to make
it as accurate, clear and consistent
as possible.
While a copy editor is working
on the manuscript, the design de
partment is working on the cover,
the type of paper and print, and
the illustrations. The designer
tries to make the book easy to
read, attractive, and appropriate
to its particular purpose and sub
ject matter.
Illustrations are sen I to the art
department, where they are com
posed to fit spaces allowed in the
book. The Press can handle up to
six colors ■simultaneously in a col
ored illustration.
In printing the cover of the
freshman bulletin four colors
were used. The illustration was
printed separately in black, vol
1

low, red and blue. The yellow |
print was superimposed on the
olack and was followed by the red |
and blue prints. The final prod
uct was a color picture of Inner
Quad.

Returning to the manuscript
which has now been copy-read,
sent to the writer for corrections
and leturned to the Press - il then
goes to the composing room,
where it is set in type on Linotype
machines, which cast lines of type
as a solid piece of metal.
Proofreading
Proofreaders c h e c k gall e y
proofs for errors made in setting
the manuscript into type. Page
proofs are then checked after tlie
galleys of type have been set up
in page form. Press proofs are
made as a last-minute final check.
The book is printed in one of
two ways, either by offset press
or by letterpress.
In the offset method, type
proofs and illustrations are pasted
on sheets of paper, from which a

| large negative is made and a print -
{ ing plate made from the negative,
j In an offset press, the plate is
i inked and pressed against a rub

$1 Million
Serving the University as both
printer and publisher, the Press
does about $1 million in business
a year. Its staff includes 90 per
sons, of which 65 are directly con
cerned with printing.
As a publisher, the Press issues
•10 to 50 new titles a year, most of
which are scholarly books. It
ranks sixth or seventh in college
press output, Harvard being first
with over 100 titles a year.
Editorial policy is governed by
a faculty committee of 10 mem
bers, appointed by the Academic
Council.
The Press editorial staff nor
mally examines about 250 matin

scripts a year, of which the? more
promising are sent out for read
ing by scholars at various univer
sities. The manuscripts receiving
favorable reports are then scruti
nized by the faculty committee at
I licit: monthly meetings.
Of note is the fact that about
40 per cent of the titles published
by the Press are written by fac
ulty members.
As a printer, the plant's equip
mcnt consists of five Linotypes.
II presses 1 letterpress, offset and
a newspaper press), a complete
bindery for hard-bound and paper
back books, pamphlets and period
icals, and a fully equipped pho
tography and plate-making de
partment.
The bindery also has a section
which does all the binding and re
binding for the University Libra
braries.
Book printing is the Press's
main work, and, for practical rea
sons, seldom less than 500 copies
of a book are printed. The aver
age book costs about $7 500 to pro
duce, of which $1,000 is for manu
facturing.
Book in (he .Making
Lot's follow a bonk in the mak
ing. The manuscript has already
been approved by the faculty com
mittee and is on its way to a copy
editor, who will mark up the man
uscript with changes, questions
and suggestions designed to make
it as accurate, clear and consistent
as possible.
While a copy editor is working
on the manuscript, the design de
partment is working on the cover,
the type of paper and print, and
the illustrations. The designer
tries to make the book easy to
read, attractive, and appropriate
to its particular purpose and sub
ject matter.
Illustrations are sen I to the art
department, where they are com
posed to fit spaces allowed in the
book. The Press can handle up to
six colors ■simultaneously in a col
ored illustration.
In printing the cover of the
freshman bulletin four colors
were used. The illustration was
printed separately in black, vol
1

low, red and blue. The yellow |
print was superimposed on the
olack and was followed by the red |
and blue prints. The final prod
uct was a color picture of Inner
Quad.

Returning to the manuscript
which has now been copy-read,
sent to the writer for corrections
and leturned to the Press - il then
goes to the composing room,
where it is set in type on Linotype
machines, which cast lines of type
as a solid piece of metal.
Proofreading
Proofreaders c h e c k gall e y
proofs for errors made in setting
the manuscript into type. Page
proofs are then checked after tlie
galleys of type have been set up
in page form. Press proofs are
made as a last-minute final check.
The book is printed in one of
two ways, either by offset press
or by letterpress.
In the offset method, type
proofs and illustrations are pasted
on sheets of paper, from which a

| large negative is made and a print -
{ ing plate made from the negative,
j In an offset press, the plate is
i inked and pressed against a rub
; ber cylinder, which is doused with
water before it makes contact
with the paper. The greasy ink
! from the imprint of the plate is
j the only thing which prints on the
paper. This method is used in
producing the Chaparral.
Using ihe letterpress method,
I '.}ight, l(j or 32 pages of type are
| locked in an iron frame, from'
| which pages are printed. Paper'
■ rolls off a large cylinder and con
tacts the horizontal forms of ink
ed type.
From the pressroom, the flat
| sheets of printed paper are auto
matically folded in the bindery
'so that they fall in proper se

quence. These folded pages are
called signatures and they form
sections of a book.
Printer! and folded signatures
are stacked in order around a re- j
volving table. They are picked up ,
in sequence by hand and ihen go
to a sewing machine, which stitch-'
es the signatures together at their
folds.
The first and last pages of the I
compiled signatures are thenl
pasted to end papers, which arc
| in turn pasted to the cover. Fin

ished books are stacked in a press,
which stores them under pressure
until ready to be put in the ware
house.
Individual copies of any l>ook
the University Press has printed
may be obtained from them at
retail price.

Hey you there, with that
"Bawlout" or that Courses and
Degrees bulletin! Open it to any
page and set it on a flat surface.
Now take your hand away. The
book doesn't stay open very long,
does it ?
Next fall both the Bawlout and
the Courses and Degrees bulletin
will lie flat under the same condi
tions, thanks U> a now method of
binding to be used by the Univer
sity Press.
At present, those publications
are stapled about li inch from
their edges, but a new machine,
just brought to Stanford from
England, will replace tho present
staples willi a strong glue. This
glue will enable the books to re
sist most wear and tear. One will
be able to pick a Bawlout up
by a single page, shake it and not
have the page detach itself from
the rest of the book.
The new machine is one of many
parts to the Press, all of which
are used in printing most of the
University publications. Accord
ing to director Leon Seltzer, Stan
ford University Press has one of
the best medium-size edition bind
cries in the West and the most
fully equipped bindery among col
lege presses.

business, the printing plant was
