# NEUMANN ON TORRANCE
## Indian, Bruin Hoopsters Vie in Weekend Crucial 
### 
The latest of the Pacific Coast
Conference's top scorers comes to
the Pavilion Friday, lie's Wall
Torre nee, UCLA's senior sensation
who last week vaulted into the
lead by pumping in 38 points in a
losing cause against Idaho.
And if Stanford's star Paul Neu
mann lias anything to say about
it, Torrence is going to have to
work mighty hard to equal his 20.0
season average.
Neumann is the man tabbed by
Card coach llowie Dallmar to
cluck the rampaging Torrence.
The senior guard has been the In
dians' 1 op all around performer all
■season, and offensively he will be
trying to whittle a tow more points
off lh;-it growing goal that would
give him 1,000 career points.
Torrence hasn't had it so tough.
His huge outburst against Idaho
last week (the Bruins lost it, 01-
ST) pushed him over the 1,000
mark as a Bruin and into fourth
place in career scoring with 1.022
points. He is almost a cinch to
end up third, as he needs only two
more points to pass Don Bragg,

but he is too far behind Willie
NauUs and John Moore to rise any
higher on the all-time UCLA list.
With the high-scoring, hard-re
bounding, fast - breaking Bruins,
his point-making becomes easier.
UCLA currently is second in loop
scoring, with a tifi.l average per
game. Stanford is last with 51.3.
But in defense live Cauls are sec
ond at 52.5, and UCLA seventh
with 02.1.
The clubs are now deadlocked
for fourth place in Ihe PCC, with
5-1 records.
The Bruins do send five men on

ilie floor at a time. hut sometimes
il is hard to fell. Turrcin'c is their
only double figure scorer over the
season, averaging L>| points, while
second-placer, guard Denny Crum,
has an B.S mark.
He lops Iho regulars in free
fhrow shooting vvilh a 71 per cent
mark, is the leading./ rebotinder (al
though one ol the shorter men on
the starting l'ivi i, and is second
among the regulars in field goal
shooting with a '}.").!> mark.
Coach John Wooden's fortunes
took a dip t his week with lh<' loss
for the season of reserve center
Hon Wallace. Wallace ran afoul
of the books last semester and is
ineligible for the rest of the year.
Other Bruins include forwards
Rafer Johnson better known for
Olympic track feats, bul al-so the
Uelans' No. 3 scorer and rebound
er and (>0 Warm II Jones, a lale-
Improving sophomore.
The Bruin center, <>-(» sophomore
Kent Miller, isn't expected to see
action this weekend after twisting
an ankle in drills. Jones will
probably take his place.
Teaming wit h To r r en c e at
guard is jump-shooting Crum, a
senior veteran.

Torrence hasn't had it so tough.
His huge outburst against Idaho
last week (the Bruins lost it, 01-
ST) pushed him over the 1,000
mark as a Bruin and into fourth
place in career scoring with 1.022
points. He is almost a cinch to
end up third, as he needs only two
more points to pass Don Bragg,

but he is too far behind Willie
NauUs and John Moore to rise any
higher on the all-time UCLA list.
With the high-scoring, hard-re
bounding, fast - breaking Bruins,
his point-making becomes easier.
UCLA currently is second in loop
scoring, with a tifi.l average per
game. Stanford is last with 51.3.
But in defense live Cauls are sec
ond at 52.5, and UCLA seventh
with 02.1.
The clubs are now deadlocked
for fourth place in Ihe PCC, with
5-1 records.
The Bruins do send five men on

ilie floor at a time. hut sometimes
il is hard to fell. Turrcin'c is their
only double figure scorer over the
season, averaging L>| points, while
second-placer, guard Denny Crum,
has an B.S mark.
He lops Iho regulars in free

mark, is the leading./ rebotinder (al

shooting with a '}.").!> mark.
Coach John Wooden's fortunes
took a dip t his week with lh<' loss
for the season of reserve center
Hon Wallace. Wallace ran afoul
of the books last semester and is
ineligible for the rest of the year.
Other Bruins include forwards
Rafer Johnson better known for
Olympic track feats, bul al-so the
Uelans' No. 3 scorer and rebound
er and (>0 Warm II Jones, a lale-
Improving sophomore.
The Bruin center, <>-(» sophomore
Kent Miller, isn't expected to see
action this weekend after twisting
an ankle in drills. Jones will
probably take his place.
Teaming wit h To r r en c e at
guard is jump-shooting Crum, a
senior veteran.
The latest of the Pacific Coast
Conference's top scorers comes to
the Pavilion Friday, lie's Wall
Torre nee, UCLA's senior sensation
who last week vaulted into the
lead by pumping in 38 points in a
losing cause against Idaho.
And if Stanford's star Paul Neu
mann lias anything to say about
it, Torrence is going to have to
work mighty hard to equal his 20.0
season average.
Neumann is the man tabbed by
Card coach llowie Dallmar to
cluck the rampaging Torrence.
The senior guard has been the In
