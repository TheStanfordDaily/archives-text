### JOHN SCHWARZ 
The "Alls" Again
Willi the basketball season a little more than half over many
sportswritor\s have been gathering their notes together in order 10
start selecting their All American, AlM'oast and many other "all"
teams that appear at the close of every season. In recent years these
teams have become so varied and expanded that now not only do
we have an All American team based on scholastic achievement, and
an All-Bay Area team, but there is rumor around that this year there
will be an All-Aniericun midget basketball team selected which will
include? only men under six feet tall.
While this trend is so popular this sportswriter would like to get
in on it with his latest "All" team, the All I'CC .Most Underrated team.
The past few years have* found most writers and coaches so en
tangled in national press battles to push their top choices into All-

American berths that many play
ers who day in and day out do a
consistently good job are not
given as much recognition as they
deserve. These players are usual
ly the number two or three man
on teams that boast of one player
who is especially outstanding and
they arc therefore overshadowed
by their teammates.
This All-I'dC Most Underrated
team is an attempt to recognize
some of the league's players who
are not especially well known but
who have performed extremely
valuable service to their team.
Starting from the outside and
working in we have Denny Fitz
patrick of California and Ciiuck
Kask of Oregon at the guard
posts.
Fit/pat rick, a scrappy little
guard from Costa Mesa, also the
home of Stanford's l'aul Neu
mann, has played consistently
good ball for the Bears all year.
On last year's Cal team Denny

was the understudy for both Earl
jjlobinson and Al Ituch and did yeoman service in the last hectic
weeks which saw Cal take the league title.
Top Scorer, iitii Overshadowed
This year Denny started the season as C'al's number three man
behind Darrall ImliolT and captain Al Bncli. Since then Denny's blos
somed into the team's top scorer, averaging 12.(5 points per game,
and has done more than an adequate job on defense. Somehow, de
spile his fine showing, Fitzpatrick is rarely given deserved credit
for Cal s fine record this year.
The other guard, Charlie Kask of Oregon, is one of the slickest
back-court men to come out of the Northwest, in quite a while. Kask,
a .junior, is currently Oregon's number three scorer, averaging a little
more than II points per game. When Stanford was up in Eugene
to take on the Welt foots Chuck drew the tough assignment of guard
ing Paul Neumann. The first half found Neumann held down to two
points while liask had bucketed nine himself. Unfortunately for
Oregon, the G-l guard had collected three fouls and saw only spotty
action in Ihe second half. Neumann finished the game with 19. Their
personal battle 1 will resume this Saturday night when the Webfoots
are at the Pavilion.
IJp front on this team are Jim Woodland of OSC and Earle Irvine
of Washington at forwards and Stanford's Dirk llaga at center.
Jimmy Woodland moved to OSC from Menlo JC and even though
he is only a sophomore Ik? has won himself a starting berth with the
Beavers. Woodland, one of the fastest basketball men on the Coast,
has served as great scoring complement to OSC's Lee Harman. How
ever, Darman's great year has overshadowed the line play of Wood
land. Jim has been averaging almost 13 points per game and is the
league's top free throw shooter, hitting 91 per cent.
Another Husky Hooker —Overlooked
The other forward, Earle Irvine, has been in a worse position than
Woodland. Irvine has had to take third place at Washington due to
tho "Tree Top Twins," Doug Smart and Bruno Boin. Irvine, the pos
sessor of one of the best hook shots around, has been an important
cog in Washington's attack for the last two years. Besides being a
good shot Earle has grabbed a great many rebounds this year and
gives his team perhaps the best one-two-three punch in college re
bounding.
The final member of the team is Dick llaga, who needs no intro
duction to Stanford fans. This (J-l center has practically performed
the impossible this season for the Indians. He has consistently been
forced to play opposite men who have been five and six inches taller,
but has never failed to tlo a good job. Defensively llaga has shown
his great prowess by putting clamps on Darrall Imhoff and Doug
Smart in crucial games at the Pavilion.
The surprise of the year has been Ifaga's phenomenal shooting.
Dick is currently hitting on 44 per cent of his shots and has hit lor
an average of 12.4 points per game.

ever, Darman's great year has overshadowed the line play of Wood
land. Jim has been averaging almost 13 points per game and is the
league's top free throw shooter, hitting 91 per cent.
Another Husky Hooker —Overlooked
The other forward, Earle Irvine, has been in a worse position than
Woodland. Irvine has had to take third place at Washington due to
tho "Tree Top Twins," Doug Smart and Bruno Boin. Irvine, the pos
sessor of one of the best hook shots around, has been an important
cog in Washington's attack for the last two years. Besides being a
good shot Earle has grabbed a great many rebounds this year and
gives his team perhaps the best one-two-three punch in college re
bounding.
The final member of the team is Dick llaga, who needs no intro
duction to Stanford fans. This (J-l center has practically performed
the impossible this season for the Indians. He has consistently been
forced to play opposite men who have been five and six inches taller,
but has never failed to tlo a good job. Defensively llaga has shown
his great prowess by putting clamps on Darrall Imhoff and Doug
Smart in crucial games at the Pavilion.
The surprise of the year has been Ifaga's phenomenal shooting.
Dick is currently hitting on 44 per cent of his shots and has hit lor
an average of 12.4 points per game.

The "Alls" Again
Willi the basketball season a little more than half over many
sportswritor\s have been gathering their notes together in order 10
start selecting their All American, AlM'oast and many other "all"
teams that appear at the close of every season. In recent years these
teams have become so varied and expanded that now not only do
we have an All American team based on scholastic achievement, and
an All-Bay Area team, but there is rumor around that this year there
will be an All-Aniericun midget basketball team selected which will
include? only men under six feet tall.
While this trend is so popular this sportswriter would like to get
in on it with his latest "All" team, the All I'CC .Most Underrated team.
The past few years have* found most writers and coaches so en
tangled in national press battles to push their top choices into All-

American berths that many play
ers who day in and day out do a
consistently good job are not
given as much recognition as they
deserve. These players are usual
ly the number two or three man
on teams that boast of one player
who is especially outstanding and
they arc therefore overshadowed
by their teammates.
This All-I'dC Most Underrated
team is an attempt to recognize
some of the league's players who
are not especially well known but
who have performed extremely
valuable service to their team.
Starting from the outside and
working in we have Denny Fitz
patrick of California and Ciiuck
Kask of Oregon at the guard
posts.
Fit/pat rick, a scrappy little
guard from Costa Mesa, also the
home of Stanford's l'aul Neu
mann, has played consistently
good ball for the Bears all year.
On last year's Cal team Denny

was the understudy for both Earl
jjlobinson and Al Ituch and did yeoman service in the last hectic
weeks which saw Cal take the league title.
Top Scorer, iitii Overshadowed
This year Denny started the season as C'al's number three man
behind Darrall ImliolT and captain Al Bncli. Since then Denny's blos
somed into the team's top scorer, averaging 12.(5 points per game,
and has done more than an adequate job on defense. Somehow, de
spile his fine showing, Fitzpatrick is rarely given deserved credit
for Cal s fine record this year.
The other guard, Charlie Kask of Oregon, is one of the slickest
back-court men to come out of the Northwest, in quite a while. Kask,
a .junior, is currently Oregon's number three scorer, averaging a little
more than II points per game. When Stanford was up in Eugene
to take on the Welt foots Chuck drew the tough assignment of guard
ing Paul Neumann. The first half found Neumann held down to two
points while liask had bucketed nine himself. Unfortunately for
Oregon, the G-l guard had collected three fouls and saw only spotty
action in Ihe second half. Neumann finished the game with 19. Their
personal battle 1 will resume this Saturday night when the Webfoots
are at the Pavilion.
IJp front on this team are Jim Woodland of OSC and Earle Irvine
of Washington at forwards and Stanford's Dirk llaga at center.
Jimmy Woodland moved to OSC from Menlo JC and even though
he is only a sophomore Ik? has won himself a starting berth with the
Beavers. Woodland, one of the fastest basketball men on the Coast,
has served as great scoring complement to OSC's Lee Harman. How
ever, Darman's great year has overshadowed the line play of Wood

This year Denny started the season as C'al's number three man
behind Darrall ImliolT and captain Al Bncli. Since then Denny's blos
somed into the team's top scorer, averaging 12.(5 points per game,
and has done more than an adequate job on defense. Somehow, de
spile his fine showing, Fitzpatrick is rarely given deserved credit
for Cal s fine record this year.
The other guard, Charlie Kask of Oregon, is one of the slickest
back-court men to come out of the Northwest, in quite a while. Kask,
a .junior, is currently Oregon's number three scorer, averaging a little
more than II points per game. When Stanford was up in Eugene
to take on the Welt foots Chuck drew the tough assignment of guard
ing Paul Neumann. The first half found Neumann held down to two
points while liask had bucketed nine himself. Unfortunately for
Oregon, the G-l guard had collected three fouls and saw only spotty
action in Ihe second half. Neumann finished the game with 19. Their
personal battle 1 will resume this Saturday night when the Webfoots
are at the Pavilion.
IJp front on this team are Jim Woodland of OSC and Earle Irvine
of Washington at forwards and Stanford's Dirk llaga at center.
Jimmy Woodland moved to OSC from Menlo JC and even though
he is only a sophomore Ik? has won himself a starting berth with the
Beavers. Woodland, one of the fastest basketball men on the Coast,
has served as great scoring complement to OSC's Lee Harman. How
ever, Darman's great year has overshadowed the line play of Wood
land. Jim has been averaging almost 13 points per game and is the
league's top free throw shooter, hitting 91 per cent.
Another Husky Hooker —Overlooked
The other forward, Earle Irvine, has been in a worse position than
Woodland. Irvine has had to take third place at Washington due to
tho "Tree Top Twins," Doug Smart and Bruno Boin. Irvine, the pos
sessor of one of the best hook shots around, has been an important
cog in Washington's attack for the last two years. Besides being a
good shot Earle has grabbed a great many rebounds this year and
gives his team perhaps the best one-two-three punch in college re
bounding.
The final member of the team is Dick llaga, who needs no intro
duction to Stanford fans. This (J-l center has practically performed
the impossible this season for the Indians. He has consistently been
forced to play opposite men who have been five and six inches taller,
but has never failed to tlo a good job. Defensively llaga has shown
his great prowess by putting clamps on Darrall Imhoff and Doug
Smart in crucial games at the Pavilion.
The surprise of the year has been Ifaga's phenomenal shooting.
Dick is currently hitting on 44 per cent of his shots and has hit lor
an average of 12.4 points per game.

The "Alls" Again
Willi the basketball season a little more than half over many
sportswritor\s have been gathering their notes together in order 10
start selecting their All American, AlM'oast and many other "all"
teams that appear at the close of every season. In recent years these
teams have become so varied and expanded that now not only do
we have an All American team based on scholastic achievement, and
an All-Bay Area team, but there is rumor around that this year there
will be an All-Aniericun midget basketball team selected which will
include? only men under six feet tall.
While this trend is so popular this sportswriter would like to get
in on it with his latest "All" team, the All I'CC .Most Underrated team.
The past few years have* found most writers and coaches so en
tangled in national press battles to push their top choices into All-

American berths that many play
ers who day in and day out do a
consistently good job are not
given as much recognition as they
deserve. These players are usual
ly the number two or three man
on teams that boast of one player
who is especially outstanding and
they arc therefore overshadowed
by their teammates.
This All-I'dC Most Underrated
team is an attempt to recognize
some of the league's players who
are not especially well known but
who have performed extremely
valuable service to their team.
Starting from the outside and
working in we have Denny Fitz
patrick of California and Ciiuck
Kask of Oregon at the guard
posts.
Fit/pat rick, a scrappy little
guard from Costa Mesa, also the
home of Stanford's l'aul Neu
mann, has played consistently
good ball for the Bears all year.
On last year's Cal team Denny

was the understudy for both Earl
jjlobinson and Al Ituch and did yeoman service in the last hectic
weeks which saw Cal take the league title.
