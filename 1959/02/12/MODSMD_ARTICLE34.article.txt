Ray-Ilallinan bouts, will feature
four other top matches.

against Californian Fred Weaver
in 'lie 16~> pound bout.

feit the 156 poun 1 di\ ision because I
of an injury to John Wilhelmy, I
hard-hitting s< pior. The Indians!
also must forfeit the 12.") pound I
bracket, because of lack of com- j
petitors.
Because of these two forfeits,

po ; nts and more if they hope to
(■oniinue their unbeaten season.
Heavyweight Grimm has TKO'd
three of the four opponents he's
faced this season, and he has yet

Cal's 178-pounder Hallinan is re
puted to be an outstanding ama
teur and will give Indian Hay
highly successful in his own right
a good tussle.
Stanford has improved with ev
ery meel soundly defeating USF
twice and Santa Clara once, after
the Broncos tied them in the sea
son's opener.
