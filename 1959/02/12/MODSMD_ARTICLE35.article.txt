# WIRE BRIEFS
## Cards Seek Power 
### 
ST. LOUIS (/P) The St. Louis
Cardinals dangled two of their
better pitchers Vinegar Bend Mi
/.ell and Sad Sam Jones as trad
ing bait Wednesday for a slugger.
Bing Devine, the Cards' general
manager, said the Redbirds would
give up a front-line pitcher for a
long-ball hitter because it might
make the "difference" for the
Cards who finished in a fifth
place tie in the National League
last season.
CINCINNATI (/Pi President
Warren Giles of the National
League said Wednesday he has
proposed that changes be made in
two baseball rules before the 1959
season opens.
The National League president
would like to have spectator inter
ference with a batted ball treated
in the same manner as fan in
terference with a thrown ball.

He won]il change the rules to
leave it up to the umpire to im
pose the penally ho feels would
nullify either act of interference.
Giles wants the suspended
game rule changed so that an ex
tra - inning game could be sus
pended. The present rule dictates
that no game which has passed
nine innings can be a suspended
game.
BERKELEY (/P) Pete Elliott
and his six California football
coaching aides Wednesday re
ceived new contracts, presumably
all at higher pay.
Elliott's three-year, $16,000 con
tract had a year to run, but the
new figures were kept secret.
