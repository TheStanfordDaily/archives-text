# Castro, Bolivar Linked
## 
### Bob Frank 
Fidel Castro was compared to
Simon Bolivar yesterday by Ron
and Hilton, professor of Romanic
languages, in an evaluation of the
Cuban revolution in historical
perspective at a well â€¢ attended
meeting of Stanford's Political
Union.
Both men first failed to hold
the capitals, then retreated to
tho mountains to gain strength,
said Hilton. Both declared "war
to the death," including prisoners
captured.
Spanish wars are characterized
by guerrilla warfare, and individ
ual heroics with motives of glory
and high ideals, while Americans,
said Hilton, win by logistics, by
the strength of their organiza
tion.
Spanish Psychology
The Spanish psychology ap
pears to be manic-depressive.
Often revolutions are unexpected.
The Latins say "the procession
goes on inside."
"An abyss of misunderstand
ing" separating Americans from
Latin America is pointed up by a
recent statement by a California
congressman on a trip to the
Dominican Republic that "Ameri
cans have always admired strong
men."
Hilton said that Trujillo had a
part in Batista's dictatorship of
Cuba, and there is no doubt that
the people of Latin America won't
rest until he is deposed.
Misunderstanding
Another cause of misunder
standing is the disinclination of
newspapers to print news about
Latin America until a revolution
breaks out, claiming that there is
no reader interest in such mat
ters.
Other defects of our relations
include threats and demands
which accompany gifts and aid
to our neighboring countries. Hil
ton said that they will remember
the strings attached to gifts, the
manner in which we make the
gifts, long after they have forgot
ten what we gave them.
