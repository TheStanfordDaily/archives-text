### Leo Krulitz, Editor 
Chatting informally at a luncheon here yesterday, Prince Constan
tino, ilie Crown Prince of Greece, suggested that "it is good for a
man to go into the military service."
The Prince, only 19, is visiting the United States for the second
time, at Ihe invitation of the Defense Department. lie has been tour-

ing the United States military
academies. He visited the country
with his mother, Queen Frede
ricka, last fall.
He told Stanford Greek stu
dents that they would certainly
have to fulfill military obligations
when they returned to Greece.
Next to Air Academy
Prince Constant ine, who has
been educated in military board
ing schools in Greece, said Stan
ford was the first liberal arts uni
versity that he has visited on this
tour. His next stop is the Air
Academy in Colorado.
In the informal atmosphere of
a turkey casserole and tossed sal
ad luncheon at the International
Center, the Prince described his
visit to Hollywood as disappoint
ing in that he realized after see
ing how movies were made that
they were all quite false.
Commenting on skiing, the
poised young man expressed a
preference for the water variety,
but added that people in Greece
don't do much of it, "because they
are worried about sharks."
Occasionally the conversation
lapsed into Greek as students
questioned their Crown Prince on
internal matters. He had perfect
command of English, however.
Frogmen Activities
The Prince described his trip
with the Navy frogmen of the
California coast near San Diego
to the luncheon guests, which in
cluded representatives of the stu
dent body, as well as the Greek
students.
He had followed the routine
the frogmen go through, includ
ing being picked up out of the
water. lie sugegsted everything
was fine until he learned that the
boats didn't stop for them but
that they were to be hauled out
of the water with a hoop. He said
he asked the frogmen how it was
done, followed directions and
there wasn't anything to it.he
added, "I was too frightened to
do anything wrong."
Have to "Shove Off"
The Prince asked for 15 extra
minutes to continue the discus
sion, explaining that his escorts
kept him on a strict schedule
which didn't always prove satis
factory. He concluded by explain
ing, "As you say in America, I
guess I have to 'shove off.' "
His visit was co-ordinated by
Mrs. Inez Richardson, Stanford's
official hostess. He visited Hoo
ver Tower where he talked with
C. Easton Rothwell, toured Engi
neering Corner, and visited Me
morial Church. lie also examined
Stanford's atomic reactor depart
ment.
