# ONE-ACTS CONTINUE
## Acting Highlights Plays 
### Sallyanne Durr 
A humanistic heaven run by a thunderbolt-happy
God, a pair of frustrated college men watching a
Brigitte Bardot movie, and a lonely outpost man
ned by a contingent of three Koreans and a mad
Russian general are the three situations entertain
ing audiences ;il Winter One-Acts this week.
Members of Ihe Second Gospel Chinch of Alhe
ism, Revealed, present their concept of heaven
complete with God, Jesus and Saint Peter in
"God's in His Heaven." God himself is caught
between a desire to be "Zeus-like" and a conscience
that demands he listen to his Son (Carl Hillen
brand i who, after all, has been on earth and knows
how man feels about things.
Bottle Loving Friar
Rabelais (Mike Brown), the bottle loving friar
who is God's right-hand man, holds the play to
gether with his witty holiness. Freshman Tim
Laddish makes a good attempt at playing God,
who is exploited and subjected by the bidding of
men, particularly on Sundays.
The introduction to the comedy written by Mark
Hammer and directed by Sam Reis does much to
relieve natural audience reserve caused by the
religious theme.
In the second play, "Grunion Run," Bill, a so
ciology major who clinic-ally interprets his room
mate's interest in members of the opposite sex as
a reaction to Calvinism, is excellently portrayed by
Thomas Bissinger.
The roommate. Art, is played by Russ Coombs
who is excellent in interpreting the part of a col
lege male frustrated bv desire, scruple and doubt.

The comedy is til ly knit, and well done. Good
lines are cleverly placed, and much of the play
undoubtedly strikes a familiar chord in the memo
ries of many in the audience. Both Demise (Heath
er Hanley) and Carol (Fanny Q. Howe), the girls
who are "picked up" at the 8.8. movie, do well
as college coeds.
I'acc Kept Iliglt
Well conceived scenes and fast blackout shifts
keep the playlet's pace high. Writer Tim Welch
and director James Gleason deserve credit for this
smooth-running contemporary "college life" one
act.
"The Grand Inquisitors," the final play, was hu
morous, hut too long. The film introduction was
unnecessary and its purpose could have been suc
cessfully incorporated into the play itself. Russian
General Kropolsky (Drew Fagan) was funny as
he attempted to "brainwash" three American fly
ers downed in North Korea, especially as his frus
trated mind becomes more confused.
Colonel Practices Yoga
American Colonel Keniston (Doug Johnson) was
hilarious while he played an unbelievably straight
faced role as a student of yoga who employed this
art to keep from confessing what he didn't know
in the first place.
On the whole, this play, co-authored by Hammer
and Bill Pereira and directed by Barclay Gold
smith, is entertaining and worth seeing.
Wintei One Acts continue tonight and tomorrow
at 8:1.1 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium's Little The
a tor. Tickets may be purchased at the Memorial
Auditorium box office.
