# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Walter Lippmann Word is Flexibility 
### 
The now word in Western di
plomacy is "flexibility." It has
become fashionable because just
under the surface of the official
formulas there is going on in
Washington, in London and in
Bonn a reappraisal of the German
problem.
It is a wholly false picture, of
what is going on, to suppose that
the issue in this reappraisal is be
tween surrendering and standing
firm, between appeasement and
principle, between being soft and
being strong.
The real issue, to which the
reappraisal is, addressed, is
whether to stand pat on posi
tions that have become untena
ble or to move to new positions
from which the Western allies
can recover the political initia
tive.
Concrete Example
Let us take Berlin for a con
crete example, remembering, of
course, that it is only the focal
point of the whole larger German
problem.
At present there are two
streams of traffic between West
Berlin and West Germany. One,
which is much the larger, is civil
ian traffic. This traffic is regu
lated by an agreement between
the West German government
and the East German government
and it is by this traffic that the
civilian population of West Berlin
lives and does its business.
The other traffic is military. It
is between the British. French
and American forces in West Ger
many and their gar risons in West
Berlin. This traffic is regulated
by Allied agreement with the So
viet Union.
Moscow has now said that if
there is no other negotiation
about the status of Berlin, it
will on IV!ay 27 turn over to the
East German government its
authority over the military traf
fic. If this is done, it will mean
that at tire check points on the
highways and railroads and ca
nals Allied military traffic will
be met by East German rather
than by Soviet officials.
Immediate Question
The immediate and specific
questions about Berlin are: (1)
what will we do when we meet
these East German officials, and
(2) what will the East German
officials do about our military
traffic?
This is where the difference be
tween an "inflexible" and a "flex
ible" policy shows itself. The in
flexibles say that we do not rec
ognize the East German govern
ment and that we cannot, there
fore, allow them to have anything
to do with our traffic to Berlin.

The flexibles reply that as long
i as no one interferes with our
traffic to Berlin it does not make
I any difference whether the offi
i cial who stamps the papers wears
i an East German or a Soviet uni
i form.
The flexibles say, moreover,
that lo announce you will fight
about the official at the check
point is not a strong policy but
a foolish one, and, because it is
I foolish, it is weak. It is weak
I because the people of the West
ern world cannot conceivably
be united lo fight a world war
on such an idiotic issue.
Mayor Flexible
As we know, the mayor of West
Berlin, the highly esteemed Willy
Brandt, can be counted among the
flexibles. He has suggested that
the East German officials might
be recognized as "agents" of the
Soviet Union. An easier and as
good a way to accomplish the
same result would be to ask a
i Soviet guarantee of access to
West Berlin until a new status
• can be arranged by negotiations
covering the two Germanys and
the two Berlins.
What we want is that West
Berlin should not be blockaded
and strangled, and that Berlin
should become again the capital
of a reunited Germany.
This flexible position is a
strong one. We stand firm on
the substance, which is that
West Berlin is not to be block
aded. We are indifferent U> the
formalities, which do not mat
ter as long as access to West
Berlin is open.
We keep alive our real objec
tive, which is not to maintain
West Berlin as an island within
East Germany, but to restore
its status as the capital city to
which all parts of Germany
must have equal access.
Soviet Gamble
It may well be that the Soviet
Union will refuse to guarantee
access during the period, which
would have to be a long one, when
the whole German problem is be
ing negotiated.
If that is what happens, the
Soviet Union will find itself in a
dangerous position. It will have
given the East Germans a free
hand to impose a blockade, which
would be an act of war, and it
will be committed to come to the
defense of the East Germans if
they provoke a war.
This is a much bigger gamble
than Moscow has ever taken be
fore, and we need not jump to the
conclusion that it will take the
gamble now.
