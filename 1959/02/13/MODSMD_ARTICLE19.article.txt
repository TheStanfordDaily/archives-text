Some of the students of Everett
(Wash.) J.C., shivering as they
trudge to classes amidst new-fall
en snow, have comp up with ideas
on what the "well-dressed college
man" of 1959 should have in his
closet. The minimum require
ments are:
4 suits
3 or 4 pairs of slacks
3 sports jackets
1 blazer
9 shirts (2 evening shirts)
10 neckties
15 pairs of socks (7 pairs regular,
G pairs white athletic, 2 pairs
black silk or nylon for formal)
4 sweaters
2 pairs tennis shorts, 1 pair ten
nis shoes, 6 T-shirts, 1 golf
jacket, 1 golf cap
7 sport shirts
1 topcoat
1 raincoat
1 dinner jacket or 1 set of tails
Hats and caps: 1 each
Of course, the men of Stanford
have ample room to put all these
clothes away neatly, don't they?
(And where on this campus can a
guy wear "1 set of tails"?)

It seems that the Humboldt
State paper runs a weekly column
entitled "Inquiring Reporter." Ev

erybody knows that all reporters
are supposed to be "inquiring" all
the time, especially if they want
to get promoted.
One "inquiring reporter" asked
this: If you were stranded on a
desert island, by yourself, what
would you want for reading ma
terial?
Some of the a n sw er s were
"Burlesque," by Herb Caen; "How
the Time Elies!" by Alfred E.
Neu man; and "How to Win
Eriends and Influence Sponsors,"
by Alfred Hitchcock.
Of course, right about now ev
ery Stanford student woidd want
a copy of "The Art of Party-Giv
ing."

And there was this advertise
ment found in the writings of our
lofty compatriots at Harvard:
"The Eliot House Drama Group
announces its program of three
(lewd) FARCES to be given Feb.
26-29 in the DINING HALL of
that EDIEJCE at 8:30 p.m. Plays
by CERVANTES, HOLBERG and
by that famed composer of Green
sleeves, ANONYMOUS, will be
seen."
This sounds vaguely like adver
tisments for dorm dances, doesn't
it, girls?

ments are:
4 suits
3 or 4 pairs of slacks
3 sports jackets
1 blazer
9 shirts (2 evening shirts)
10 neckties
15 pairs of socks (7 pairs regular,
G pairs white athletic, 2 pairs
black silk or nylon for formal)
4 sweaters
2 pairs tennis shorts, 1 pair ten

Of course, the men of Stanford
have ample room to put all these
clothes away neatly, don't they?
(And where on this campus can a
guy wear "1 set of tails"?)

It seems that the Humboldt
State paper runs a weekly column
entitled "Inquiring Reporter." Ev

erybody knows that all reporters
are supposed to be "inquiring" all
the time, especially if they want
to get promoted.
One "inquiring reporter" asked
this: If you were stranded on a
desert island, by yourself, what
would you want for reading ma
terial?
Some of the a n sw er s were
"Burlesque," by Herb Caen; "How
the Time Elies!" by Alfred E.
Neu man; and "How to Win
Eriends and Influence Sponsors,"
by Alfred Hitchcock.
Of course, right about now ev
ery Stanford student woidd want
a copy of "The Art of Party-Giv
ing."

And there was this advertise
ment found in the writings of our
lofty compatriots at Harvard:
"The Eliot House Drama Group
announces its program of three
(lewd) FARCES to be given Feb.
26-29 in the DINING HALL of
that EDIEJCE at 8:30 p.m. Plays
by CERVANTES, HOLBERG and
by that famed composer of Green
sleeves, ANONYMOUS, will be
seen."
This sounds vaguely like adver
tisments for dorm dances, doesn't
it, girls?
Some of the students of Everett
(Wash.) J.C., shivering as they
trudge to classes amidst new-fall
en snow, have comp up with ideas
on what the "well-dressed college
man" of 1959 should have in his
closet. The minimum require

4 suits
3 or 4 pairs of slacks
