"Yugoslavia's economic develop
ment is in full swing." said Min
drag Mihajlovic, vice consul of
Yugoslavia, in an lIR talk at Row
man Alumni House yesterday.
He described achievements in
industrialization and mechaniza
tion as compared to the country's
extremely low level of technical
development in former years.
The economic policy, character
ized by rapid industrial growth, is
"one of the most vigorous in Eu
rope," according to Mihajlovic.
The plans are designed to pro
mote all-around economic develop
mentâ€”improvements in agricul
ture, greater production of con
sumer goods, as well as an effort
to increase foreign trade.
There will be an emphasis on
the development of power re
sources, the viee consul added.
Yugoslavia is second only to Nor
way in water resources, yet has
utilized only .1 per cent of it, he
noted as an example of the area of
emphasis.
Education is fire, said Mihajlo
vic, and is available to those who
want it. There are several agri
cultural colleges, since "we need
to have mechanical gadgets, but
also people who can use them."
