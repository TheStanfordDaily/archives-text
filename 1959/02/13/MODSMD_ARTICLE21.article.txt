Undercover Reporter
Editor, Tin* Daily:
During the past low days, now
that the aftereffects of the chaot
ic Los Altos Rebellion have some
what subdued themselves, I, as an
enterprising free ■ lance reporter
for the Los Alios Times, have
done some undercover reporting
on the junta that furtively plan
ned the overthrow of the Los Al
tos police department.
By devious means which lam
pledged not to divulge I man
aged to make my way to rebel
headquarters somewhere deep
within the tortuous confines of
Alpine Road. They first removed
my blindfold, then led me over a
peanut-shelled floor to a table in
the back of the room. In the
background blared the patriotic
•s t ra in s of there be 1 hymn,
"There's No Place Like Home."
They asked me if I had eaten;
I said no. "Would you like some
of our rations?" their bearded
leader asked me. "0.K.," 1 said.
"Four pitchers of brew, Howard,
and hurry!" he snapped. Almost
immediately the rations arrived
and our interview began.
"Why did you attempt to over
throw them?" I asked. "They
were too powerful!" he retorted.
"We must curb their power!"
Then he clenched his fists, clamp
ed down tightly on his unlit cigar
and began to fulminate. "Fra
ternity men of the world must
arise," he exhorted. "Our day has
come; we must create a policeless
society."
Just then a tired, sweaty rebel
staggered through the door, arm
ed with a pitcher of beer (their
favorite weapon). "We must dis
band!" he cried. "The A.D.'s | as
sociate dean's 1 man i-s coming."
Quickly 1 was blindfolded and led
back to campus.
Conscientious citizens! I ear
nestly adjure you to be on the
lookout for the hellions who in
sidiously plot to overthrow out'
men in blue. They have infiltrat
ed our ranks —and one might be
sitting next to you now!
There is one giveaway to 1 heir
presence, however. Out of due
respect to their cause, they refuse
to use words that start with the
letters A, B or C.

Cl.irifyln" rlic ITR. Article
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday's Daily contained a
long letter attacking the article
written by Lester O'Shea, lIR po
litical analyst. As we think the
article contained ideas worth con
sidering, and in view of the con
fusion concerning the article due
to the misleading heading given
we would like to attempt to re
date the major point* of that
irticle.
M a ny Americans regard the
rise of Afro - Asian nationalism
with an attitude of idealistic sym
pathy. The article is an attempt
to examine critically the effects
of this nationalist movement, and
to bring out some of the undesir
able effects of this nationalism
which should be weighed against
the more easily recognized desir
able effects. In general, three ma
jor points were brought out:
1. That the rise of Afro-Asian
nationalism may endanger the po
litical and economic interests of
the United States. A citizen of
another country may legitimately
reply, "So what?" But for an
American this is a point which
should be seriously considered.
2. That in many of these coun
tries there is a lack of adequately
trained administrators. This prob
lem has been noted by the govern
ments of these countries, by West
ern observers and in United Na
tions reports, and is often regard
ed as a serious barrier to econom
ic development and political de
mocracy.
Certainly much is being done to
solve this problem, and we may
hope that in the near 1 future (per
haps when those people currently
being trained assume administra
tive positions) it will be solved;
but we think that a realistic posi
tion must recognize that in many

countries at llii-s dale Die problem
is there.
:i. That nationalism hampers
"interethnic" cooperation and pre
vents interethnie allegiance. One
result of this is the establishment
>1 states on ethnic grounds in the
face of geographical and econom
ic factors (Pakistan).
The author of the article did
not say that Afro-Asian national
ism is oversensitive to criticism,
but the violent nature of tho at
tack on the article "feeblemind
ed immaturity," "sheer ignor
ance," "flamboyant display of ill
informed prejudice," "impenetra
ble ignorance," "outdated imperi
alist prejudice"—makes us fear
that perhaps he should have add
ed this as a fourth point.

Brief Criricism
Editor, The Daily:
To "qualify" my brief criticism
of Jane Rut ledges' letter (Daily,
Feb. 10), I shall indicate that I am
antagonized.
How does it follow that ". . . to
degrade African government" is
to "degrade the British adminis
tration and the English education
al system in Africa"? The teach
er can only impart knowledge and

give out ideas. The students must
make up their own minds as to
the course of action that they will
follow from the learning of
knowledge and the accumulation
>112 ideas. The actions of the free
African governments cannot he

blamed on tho former rulers. The
movement lor freedom in Africa
Is evidence in itself that the Afri
can wants a different system of
government than he has under
present rule.
