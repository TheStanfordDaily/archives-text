# Duel in the Backcourt; Neumann vs. Torrance
## 
### 
What is potentially the local
basketball season's best individ
ual duel will begin tonight at 8
when Paul Neumann and Walt
Torrence square off in Stanford
Pavilion.
Incidentally, the other mem
bers of the Stanford and UCLA
teams will be there too, to par
ticipate in what shapes up as a
nip-and tuck battle.
Bolh teams will be fighting to
stay alive in the fast-closing Pa
cific Coast Conference flag chase.
Each has a 5-1 record, and stands
1 games behind high-stepping
California.
But while championship hopes
of the two clubs are important,
there's still no denying that most
interest is centered around the
Neumann-Torrence clash.
The Indian and Bruin are prob
ably the two finest guards in the
league Torrence tops the scor
ers at 20.5 and Neumann is
fourth at 16.4.
Torrence is I he only man on his
team with much finesse he's the
glue on a club lhat likes to win
on ruggedness and go-for-broke
play.
There's certainly no doubt that
Neumann holds the Indians to
gether. lies' the court general,
the top scorer, the most effective
defesnive man, and the Indian
whom most opposition coaches
try lo bottle up before they start
to Ihink about the rest of the
squad.
From what rival ocaehes Howie
D a 1 1 m a rand Johnny Wooden
have said, there seems to be no
doubt that Torrence will be guard
ing Neumann and vice-versa. It's
probably a safe bet that whoever
wins the battle of the guards will
be setting the stage for a team
victory as well.
UCLA comes into the game
with two disadvantages, while the
Cards have one advantage. The
two Bruin sore spots are .Ron
Wallace and Kent Miller, their
two top centers. Wallace flunked
out at the semester break and
Miller twisted his ankle early in
the week. Their absence will
probably push Warnell Jones, at
6-10, into the starting lineup.
Sta n 112 ord's advantage is its
home-court invincibility so far
this year. Seven times the Cards
have taken to the Pavilion floor,
and seven times they've won

and two of these were definite
upset victories.
In the try for win number eight
at home, Dallmar is expected to
go with his normal lineup of John
Arrillaga and John Ilendry at for
wards, Dick Haga at center and
Doug Warren and Neumann at
guards.
And then there's S a 1 u r d a y
night — another conference en
counter, this one against Oregon.
Two weeks ago, the Indians rout

od the Ducks, bill from all indi
cation's it'll be a different team,
'from the Northwest this time.
Oregon, pretty much out of the
PCC race at 3-5, has nonetheless
won its last two outings and has
looked good doing it. The Ducks
figure to go with a lineup of
Chuck Rask and Bud Kuykendall
at guards, Stu Robertson and
Dale Herron at forwards, and ei
ther Denny Strickland or Jerry
Anderson at the fifth spot.

Neumann's biggest challenge to <lat<
What is potentially the local
basketball season's best individ
ual duel will begin tonight at 8
when Paul Neumann and Walt
Torrence square off in Stanford
Pavilion.
Incidentally, the other mem
bers of the Stanford and UCLA
teams will be there too, to par
ticipate in what shapes up as a
nip-and tuck battle.
Bolh teams will be fighting to
stay alive in the fast-closing Pa
cific Coast Conference flag chase.
Each has a 5-1 record, and stands
1 games behind high-stepping
California.
But while championship hopes
of the two clubs are important,
there's still no denying that most
interest is centered around the
Neumann-Torrence clash.
The Indian and Bruin are prob
ably the two finest guards in the
league Torrence tops the scor
ers at 20.5 and Neumann is
fourth at 16.4.
Torrence is I he only man on his
team with much finesse he's the
glue on a club lhat likes to win
on ruggedness and go-for-broke
play.
There's certainly no doubt that
Neumann holds the Indians to
gether. lies' the court general,
the top scorer, the most effective
defesnive man, and the Indian
whom most opposition coaches
try lo bottle up before they start
to Ihink about the rest of the
squad.
From what rival ocaehes Howie
D a 1 1 m a rand Johnny Wooden
have said, there seems to be no
doubt that Torrence will be guard
ing Neumann and vice-versa. It's
probably a safe bet that whoever
wins the battle of the guards will
be setting the stage for a team
victory as well.
UCLA comes into the game
with two disadvantages, while the
Cards have one advantage. The
two Bruin sore spots are .Ron
Wallace and Kent Miller, their
two top centers. Wallace flunked
out at the semester break and
Miller twisted his ankle early in
the week. Their absence will
probably push Warnell Jones, at
6-10, into the starting lineup.
