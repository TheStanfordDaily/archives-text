### Barbara Hicks 
The question of a new booklet for the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission arose before the Legislature last night for
the second time.
Jim Robertson of Men's Council told the Legislature that tho dis
cussions of the Fundamental Standard hold this week in Branner

Hall indicated a need for the pro
posed revised booklet for the pres
ent freshman class.
Last month the Legislature re
fused to appropriate funds for the
printing of the booklet, but ap
proved money for mimeographing
copies.
The Wilbur representatives, Bob
Burnett and Jerry Majer, said
they felt that the freshmen would
not bother to read the pamphlet
this late in the year, and that the
time to distribute it was at the be
ginning of t he year.
"It's a ridiculous waste of mon
ey now," said Burnett.
Majer moved to table the dis
cussion until the freshmen could
talk with their constituencies.
Athletic Association
Robin Moore presented a con
stitution for the Stanford Student
Athletic Association which would
"advance the interest in and serv
ice to athletics" and "bring ath
letes up equal to other students."
All members of a team compet
ing in intercollegiate athletics for
a minimum of one school year
will be eligible for the association.
The constitution w;is referred to
the bylaws committee.

law changes for the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Com
mission and sent bylaw changes

mittee.

lations Board co-chairmen, replac
