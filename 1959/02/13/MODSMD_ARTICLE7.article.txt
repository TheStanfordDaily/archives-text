"Frisbce is an exact science,"
according to an unofficial re
port by the Stanford English
Department, "and you can al
ways tell how one is going to
tall by dividing the rate of spin
into the speed."
The report was made yester
day afternoon by three mem
bers of the department who
were enjoying a brisk game on
Inner Quad. Among the many
special techniques demonstrat
ed by the experts were the
"manly hackswing" and the
"boomerang loft."
It was not known whether or
not the department planned to
publish their findings.
