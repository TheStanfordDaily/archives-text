# Japan Approves Korean Eviction
## 
### 
TOKYO (Friday) (/}*> —The .Jap
anese government today approved
a plan to send to North Korea
thousands of Koreans living in
Japan.
The action is expeeted to plunge
Japan and South Korea two of
America's firmest Far East A 1
lies into their gravest crisis
since the end of World War 11.
There are 600,000 Koreans liv
ing in this island nation and
South Korea is opposed strongly
to sending them to the Commu
nist north.
Decision Announced
The Japanese government deci
sion was anounced by Chief Cabi
net Secretary Munenori Agaki. It
came a day after high-level meet
ings in both Tokyo and Seoul on
the issue.
President Syng m a n Rhee's
South Korean cabinet, which has
hinted at the use of force to
block the repatriation, held an
emergency meeting in Seoul and
was reported to have made "a
momentous decision." Spokes
men said details of the decision
will be withheld for a few days.
Reconciliation Effort
Then came a meeting in Tokyo
between South Korean Minister
Yiu Tai Hai and Japanese Foreign
Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama. This
meeting, a final reconciliation ef
fort by Japan, appeared fruitless.
Yiu notified Fujiyama that
South Korea would never approve

the shipment of Korean citizens to
the Red - ruled north. He said
Rhee's government "is prepared
to go to any length to prevent
this crime against humanity."
Rhee's government contends it is
the only legal government of Ko
rea and that any Korean residents
of Japan who want to go home
should be sent to South Korea.
Jobs l'roniised
Most of the Koreans living in
Japan were brought here for la
bor in the period before 1945
when Japan ruled Korea. Esti

mates of the number wanting to
go to North Korea — where the
Red regime has promised them
jobs—range froVn 43,000 to 117,-
000.
South Korea maintains these
Koreans were virtually kidnaped
and that Japan has a moral debt
to allow them to earn decent
wages, without discrimination.
