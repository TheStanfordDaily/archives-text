# Indian Cagers Slay in Loop Race With Victories Over UCLA, Oregon
## DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barnes 
"Home Sweet Home" continued
Id be Stanford's favorite basket
ball sons as the Indians regis
tered victories over UCLA and
Oregon on the local floor over
the weekend.
The tjght 69-61 victory over the
Bruins and far easier 64-53 con
quest of the Ducks ran Stanford's
home win streak to 12 nine this
year and kept the Tribe within
shouting distance of PCC leader
California.
With the loop chase now past
the two-thirds mark, the Indians
stand in Ihird place at 7-1. Cal is
<S 2, Washington a game behind at
7-3.
Gaines Similar
Seorewisc, the two games bore
a striking first • half similarity.
The second periods were far dif
ferent as the Indians had to fight
to pull away at the end against
UCLA, but had little trouble
against Oregon.
The heralded Paul Neumann-
Walt Torrcnce duel duel in Fri
day's game came out relatively
even. Torrcnce made one more
field goal and one more free
throw for a 19-16 scoring advan
tage. Each picked up four fouls
in what was at times a pretty
rough battle.
Neumann, however, had his hot
test moments near the end of the
game, when the Cards pulled
ahead for keeps after being tied
three limes in two minutes.
Neumann added 13 more points
Saturday for a weekend total of
2!), slightly below his season aver
age. John Arrillaga was 15-14 for
the two games, deadlocking Neu
mann for top honors. Dick Haga
had 19 and 8 as the Stanford scor
ing in both games was remark
ably evenly divided.
Red-Hot Half
Hot shooting was the key to
Stanford's win over the Bruins.
Hanging away al a 56 per cent |
clip in the first half, the Cards
none the less couldn't pull away.

TWO FAST-BREAK POINT FOR CHRIS BURFORD
Indian star gets by Oregon's Bud Kuykendall (13) for key basket
to much of a lead until its wan
ing moments.
A hook by Ifaga after 12:08 of
play tied the count at 21-21 ihe
fourth tie of the game. A minute
and one half later, Doug Warren's
long jumper gave Stanford the
lead which il ran If) 35-27 by half
time.
After less than four minutes of
Ihe second half, Stanford was out
to a 45-32 lead. Braces of field
by Arrillaga and John Hendry,
plus two free throws by Neu
mann, apparently gave the In
dians a tight hold on ihe game.
But s u d d en 1 y the Stanford
shooting turned as cold as it had
been hot. In seven minutes, the
Bruins had closed to two points,
as Denny Crum set the pace.
Howie Dallmar's men regained
a shade of their shooting eye and
held onto the lead until 53-51, but
Rater Johnson's pair of charity
line shots made il a new game at
53-all.
Hagn Clutches
Tied again at 55 and 57, it was
n't until Haga swished through a

turn-around jump shot at .3:20
that the Cards regained the lead
for good.
Arrillaga followed with a jump
shot just eight seconds later, and
then IV eum a n n intercepted a
Bruin pass and scored himself to
widen the gap for six.
UCLA never managed to get
closer than 65-61 as the deliberate
Indians let the harried Bruins seal
their own fate with game-ending
fouls and floor errors.
Despite the one drought, Stan
ford finished with a most respec
table 46.1 field goal percentage
to just 34.4 for the Bruins. UC
LA had a fat 48-35 backboard
edge, but even the extra shooting
opportunities failed to compen
sate for their 1 failure to hit as
often as the Cards.

The Ducks stayed in Ihe game
for four minutes of the second
stanza, but when Stanford out
scored them 14-2 over a s'"-min
ute stretch, the game was as good
as over.
Dallmar substituted freely the
rest of the way, giving a total of
14 men time on the floor. The
wide margin and sloppy play of
both clubs in the final minutes re
dueed the game to not much of a
contest, although Oregon man
aged to whittle what had been ;i
l(i-point lead down to 11 at Ihe
finish.
Rebound Improvement
Stanford's biggest improve
ment over the UCLA game came
in the rebound department, where
it held a 51-39 edge. Shooting per
centage was down to 39. G, but
Oregon was even worse than the
Bruins it hit only 32.1 per cent
of the time.
Despite the two victories, Stan
ford finds itself still unable to af
ford any losses. It'll get a tough
test this weekend with games
against UCLA and USC at Pan
Pacific Auditorium in Los Ange
les.

Arrillaga followed with a jump
shot just eight seconds later, and

UCLA never managed to get
closer than 65-61 as the deliberate
Indians let the harried Bruins seal
their own fate with game-ending
fouls and floor errors.
Despite the one drought, Stan
ford finished with a most respec
table 46.1 field goal percentage
to just 34.4 for the Bruins. UC
LA had a fat 48-35 backboard
edge, but even the extra shooting
opportunities failed to compen
sate for their 1 failure to hit as
often as the Cards.

The Ducks stayed in Ihe game
for four minutes of the second
stanza, but when Stanford out
scored them 14-2 over a s'"-min
ute stretch, the game was as good
as over.
Dallmar substituted freely the
rest of the way, giving a total of
14 men time on the floor. The
wide margin and sloppy play of
both clubs in the final minutes re
dueed the game to not much of a
contest, although Oregon man
aged to whittle what had been ;i
l(i-point lead down to 11 at Ihe
finish.
Rebound Improvement
Stanford's biggest improve
ment over the UCLA game came
in the rebound department, where
it held a 51-39 edge. Shooting per
centage was down to 39. G, but
Oregon was even worse than the
Bruins it hit only 32.1 per cent
of the time.
Despite the two victories, Stan
