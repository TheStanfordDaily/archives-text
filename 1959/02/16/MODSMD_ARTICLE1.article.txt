"Home Sweet Home" continued
Id be Stanford's favorite basket
ball sons as the Indians regis
tered victories over UCLA and
Oregon on the local floor over
the weekend.
The tjght 69-61 victory over the
Bruins and far easier 64-53 con
quest of the Ducks ran Stanford's
home win streak to 12 nine this
year and kept the Tribe within
shouting distance of PCC leader
California.
With the loop chase now past
the two-thirds mark, the Indians
stand in Ihird place at 7-1. Cal is
<S 2, Washington a game behind at
7-3.
Gaines Similar
Seorewisc, the two games bore
a striking first • half similarity.
The second periods were far dif
ferent as the Indians had to fight
to pull away at the end against
UCLA, but had little trouble
against Oregon.
The heralded Paul Neumann-
Walt Torrcnce duel duel in Fri
day's game came out relatively
even. Torrcnce made one more
field goal and one more free
throw for a 19-16 scoring advan
tage. Each picked up four fouls
in what was at times a pretty
rough battle.
Neumann, however, had his hot
test moments near the end of the
game, when the Cards pulled
ahead for keeps after being tied
three limes in two minutes.
Neumann added 13 more points
Saturday for a weekend total of
2!), slightly below his season aver
age. John Arrillaga was 15-14 for
the two games, deadlocking Neu
mann for top honors. Dick Haga
had 19 and 8 as the Stanford scor
ing in both games was remark
ably evenly divided.
Red-Hot Half
Hot shooting was the key to
Stanford's win over the Bruins.
Hanging away al a 56 per cent |
clip in the first half, the Cards
none the less couldn't pull away.
