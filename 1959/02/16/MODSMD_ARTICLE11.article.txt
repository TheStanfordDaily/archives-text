# Dulles Has 'Fighting Chance'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (/IT Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles' doe
tors gave him a fighting chance
Sunday to recover enough from
cancer to stay on the job at least
part time.
In private talks, the doctors
were reported annoyed at some
reaction to Dulles' new illness
which already had counted him
out of action at this critical junc
ture of world affairs.
No More Surgery
The doctors have ruled out fur
ther surgery. Radiation therapy
is scheduled to start this week.
If that does not control the can
cer, medical experts say a variety
of other treatments could be tried
drugs derived from nitrogen
mustard gas or perhaps injections
of radioactive gold.
Dulles' new cancer, discovered
Friday when he was operated on
for hernia at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, is adenocarcino
ma, a glandular cancer. It is a re
currence of the cancer for which
he underwent intestinal surgery
al Walter Reed on Nov. 3, 1956.
(Crossroads
Dulles appeared to be at the
crossroads of three possible
courses:
1. If the spread of cancer is
completely checked, he perhaps
could stay on as secretary for the
remaining 23 months of the Ei
senhower administration, delegat
ing all but the toughest problems
to subordinates.
2. He could resign as secretary
but stay on the scene, perhaps by
joining the White House staff as
Presidential assistant on foreign
affairs.
3. If he failed to respond to
treatment, he could resign and re
main in Washington as a kind of
unofficial elder statesman con
sultant on foreign affairs.
