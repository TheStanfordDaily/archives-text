# Quartetto Performance 'Varied'
## 
### Raymond A. Prier 
The Quartctto Italiano present
ed a varied program Saturday
night in Dikelspiel Auditorium,
and although the performers cre
ated several moving adagios, they
failed in the allegros to evoke the
tonal amplitude or brilliance need
ed to solidify such a program.
Highlight of the evening was
the rewarding encore, a Schu
mann composition which probed
the romantic capabilities of the
quartet--apparently its primary
asset. With full and sustained
tone, the quartet molded its phras
ing. tempo and interpretation to
extract all of the composition's
musical possibilities.
I .imitations Shown
Two movements of the fjoeche
rini Quartet in CI major, a work
which could easily give this com
poser a deserved acclaim, clearly
showed the performers' limita
tions. The Presto, which offered
limitless lyric possibilities, espe
cially for the 'ecllo, floundered in
tempo and was imbued with a
stunted, unnatural tone.
Not even the shimmering lyri
cism of violinist Miss PcgrcfTi
could overcome the blunt effect
I of the others. The performers
| reached their forte in this number
in Minuetto, another adagio

and a quiet, almost tragic move
ment with difficult double-stop
ped passages.
A group without brilliant tonal
capacity cannot do the Mozart
Quartet, K. 455. justice. The first,
second and fourth movements
rightly showed a thoughtful and
intimate Mo/art, yet ;it a sacrifce
of the more brilliant themes. One
missed the warm tones and gaiety
inherent in the work.
Delicate Phrasing
Miss Pegreffi again produced a
delicate phrasing and artistic un
derstanding of the romantic Mo
zart in the third movement, which
helped to balance the other three
movements.
Stravinsky's Three Pieces for
String Quartets proved exasperat
ing. The performers fought irreg
ular tempos in the Dance, and the
crashing harmonies and pace of
a clever Kecentrie only showed
that expressionism is fiendishly
difficult to convey in a string
qua rtet.
Thrive on (antielc
fortunately the Canticle pro
vided the material on which these
performers seem to thrive; its
difficult harmonics proved an in
teresting experience in sonority
values.
The major work on the pro

gram, flk;.Ravel Quartet in F ma
jor, adequately tested the per
formers' ingenuity and patience.
This grave yet youthful composi
tion, of uncompromisingly classic
framework surrounding lyric mo
lives. could easily have saved the
program.
Yet after artistically creating
the requisite impresionistic tex
ture in the first movement, the
quartet was unable to evoke the
lyric themes.
Surprisingly superb co-ordina
tion within the group and the
violist's skillfully phrased the
matic passages improved the in
terpretation of the second move
men I.
"Siring Breaker"
The difficult pizzicato matrix,
however, proved a string breaker,
and although the quartet made a
masterful recovery with needed
verve, its tonality didn't reach
perfection until the fourth move
mcnt.
Miss Pegreffi's beautiful lone
possibly saved the Ties Lent, and
she certainly carried I he group to
the achievement of Ihe last move
ment. Only here were the tone
j capabilities of a quartet fully
' realized, and it was he who so
disarmingly interpreted the lyric
themes.
