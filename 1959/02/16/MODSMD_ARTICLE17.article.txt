Ruble women will meet willi
members of (he Fundamental
Standard Committee and the JllrJi
cial Council in corridor meetings
tonight in (he second of a series
of informal discussions with
freshmen.
Purpuses of the discussions arc
to hear student opinion for a re
evaluation of the Fundamental
Standard, to stimulate student in
terest in the Fundamental Stand
ard Committee, and to explain the
reasons for the committee's poli
cies, s;iid Ron Sikes, committee
chairman.
Discussions with Branner last
Monday went fairly well on the
whole, Sikes said. Me feels that
the committee is getting a good
idea of freshman opinion.
They brought up many of the
same things that upperclassmen
do, mentioning particularly the
ambiguity of the Fundamental
Standard.
Dates for discussions with Wil
bur have not been definitely set
yet, but they will probably be la
ter this week or next week.
