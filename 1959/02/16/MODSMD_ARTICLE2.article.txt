# MD to Examine Altitude Effect
## 
### 
A Stanford Medical School phy
sician is on his way to the high
Andes of South America to study
the effects of altitude upon the
hearts of newborn babies.
Professor Herbert N. Ilultgren,
head of Stanford's Cardiovascular
Research Laboratory, is making
11 if* trip under a grant from the
National Heart. Institute of the
U.S. Public Health Service. His
headquarters will be a hospital
in La Oroya, Peru, 12,.300 feet
above sea level, but he will also
visit villages at much higher ele
vations.
According to Dr. Ilultgren, the
problem of survival at high alti
tudes is most acute among new
born infants. At. this time he
plans only to survey the* potential
for future studies. He will return
to San Francisco in six weeks.
