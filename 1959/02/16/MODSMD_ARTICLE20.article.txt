## Excellent Revival of B'dway Hit 
### Herb Harwick 
A Broadway smash in (he late
'30's, Kurt Weill's "Lady in the
Dark" is currently undergoing an
excellent revival on Friday and
Saturday nights al the Opera King
in San Francisco. With Weill's
music and Ira Gershwin's lyrics,
"Lady" was the role in which the
late Gertrude Lawrence estab
lished herself.
The story probably the first
musical comedy about a psychia
trist â€” concerns the editor of a
women's magazine i Dolores Bern
hard) who, having emotional dif
ficulties, consults a psychiatrist
and relates to him in the form of
flashbacks all her dreams.
The reasons fur her dilemma
are actually rather easy lo see

| considering the zany character of
I her stall, in particular her star
photographer, played by Mickey
Miller, who turns in an absolutely
hilarious performance. Also play
ing their roles to perfection are
Byron Burleigh as the hard boiled
advertising manager and Fran
Bates as the executive secretary.
The music, like most of Weill's
I work, is astonishingly beautiful,
and the cast sings it well. The
production is in the round, and,
while director lima Kay has solv
ed most of the technical problems
connected with this type of stag
ing, the production is stiJl at times
a bit overwhelming.
Overall, this adds up to a very
enjoyable evening one not to tie
missed.
