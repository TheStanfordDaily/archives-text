[With regard to the Administra
tion's ruling on the fraternity par
ty. | ... It was a direct slap in the
face to the integrity of a sell-gov
erning community. When the Uni
versity can arbitrarily assert it
self in such a manner at any chos
en instance, why then do we con
tinue the pretense that there is
any sort of student-Administration
democracy at Stanford?
Democracy implies a sharing of
power 1 , and the University certain
ly has-not allowed students much
more initiative than that which
can be wielded w i th a rubber
stamp. The crux of the fraternity
trouble involves the same ques
tions that keep continually reap
pearing at Stanford. The Univer
sity simply will not tolerate stu
dent interference where it contra
dicts any of their policy.
The guilt behind the fraternity
problem at Stanford lies not with
the fraternities but with the Uni
versity.
We are encouraged by the Uni
versity to develop our 1 integrity,
to participate, because participa
tion and community living are as
sets of Stanford not to be had at
many other institutions. But some
how the exuberance of Stanford
Living wears off after the first
few months and is replaced by a
growing apathy, even affecting
one of Stanford's most precious
assets— education.
The student, instead of turning
inward to the University at the
time when his intellectual spirit is
first being awakened, and needs
and craves instruction, finds him
self forced outward. This is so be
cause of the lack of goals to be
found inside.
For some this is, of course, not
true, but for the majority an ex
perience in community living and
learning needs to involve a real
sharing of power 1 and responsibili
ty. A King cannot govern without
first a kingdom to govern. . . .
It is tragic that so many ex
tremely capable people here at
Stanford are being "kidded" into
thinking they have any sort of in
fluence in University policy.
The students here are far from
being children; they have the ca
pacity to th in k and judge for
themselves. Let the University
either' give us sufficient power to
control our interests, or do away
completely with the student-Ad
ministration democratic farce we
now know.

Editor, The Daily:
In regard to your editorial en
titled "Fraternity Penalty," which
appeared in last Wednesday's
Daily, these are some thoughts
that might be considered.
First, it is possible that, howev
er unintentionally, you have given

a slightly distorted picture of the
party in question. You state as a
fact that il took the entire police
force of Los Altos to break it up.
Actually someone announced that
the party was being closed, and
everyone left.
The "appalling" fact that 300
Stanford students were involved
is cited along with the observation
that "most Stanford students
probably agree that throwing beer
on uniformed officers and throw
ing cherry bombs in a crowd are
definitely beyond the bounds of
common sense and decency."
And liberally dispersed through
out the entire piece are such terms
and statements as "such action
can only be considered as a seri
ous breach of acceptable social
conduct" and"the seriousness of
the matter cannot be overstated."
All of the above are combined
quite effectively to present a pic
lure of 150 Stanford fraternity
men and their dates, all armed to
the teeth with cherry bombs and
pausing only long enough to
throw beer at officers of the law
before continuing to blow each
other to bits.
Really now, if this was your in
tention, then I refer you to the
front page of the Palo Alto Times,
Feb. 10. Their write-up on the
party gave the impression that
the party-goers played much the
same role against the Los Altos
police force as the barricaded
peasants of the French Revolu
tion played against the soldiers
of the King; and as a whole it
gives the account of the party a
much more fantastic mythological
flavor.
These efforts to throw the party J
in such a good light are deeply ap
preciated by those who attended
the party. However, in all fair-]
ness, I do not think they are de
served.
We tried; but out of 300 only i
one of us threw beer at a police j
man, and not more than two or ;
three had the foresight to bring
cherry bombs and these were
asked not to throw even their'
paltry supply. . . .
I think that you need not be so j
alarmed, because there are still
299 people who had the common !
decency not to throw beer at po
lice officers, and there were 296
people at the party who had the i
common sense not to bring cherry j
bombs.
This is the apparent fact we j
must face: that Stanford has pro
duced a system of such gross and
manifest injustice that it can pun
ish 350 fraternity men, because
within their ranks there are four,
possibly five, men who are guilty
of inconsiderate (not indecent)
actions.
The correction you are seeking
seems to lie riot so much in re
vamping our living system as per
haps to examine closely our sense
of right and wrong at all levels in
this school. . . .

In regard to your editorial en
titled "Fraternity Penalty," which
appeared in last Wednesday's
Daily, these are some thoughts
that might be considered.
First, it is possible that, howev
er unintentionally, you have given

a slightly distorted picture of the
party in question. You state as a
fact that il took the entire police
force of Los Altos to break it up.
Actually someone announced that
the party was being closed, and
everyone left.
The "appalling" fact that 300
Stanford students were involved
is cited along with the observation
that "most Stanford students
probably agree that throwing beer
on uniformed officers and throw
ing cherry bombs in a crowd are
definitely beyond the bounds of
common sense and decency."
And liberally dispersed through
out the entire piece are such terms
and statements as "such action
can only be considered as a seri
ous breach of acceptable social
conduct" and"the seriousness of
the matter cannot be overstated."
All of the above are combined
quite effectively to present a pic
lure of 150 Stanford fraternity
men and their dates, all armed to
the teeth with cherry bombs and
pausing only long enough to
throw beer at officers of the law
before continuing to blow each
other to bits.
Really now, if this was your in
tention, then I refer you to the
front page of the Palo Alto Times,
Feb. 10. Their write-up on the
party gave the impression that
the party-goers played much the
same role against the Los Altos
police force as the barricaded
peasants of the French Revolu
tion played against the soldiers
of the King; and as a whole it
gives the account of the party a
much more fantastic mythological
flavor.
These efforts to throw the party J
in such a good light are deeply ap
preciated by those who attended
the party. However, in all fair-]
ness, I do not think they are de
served.

All of the above are combined
quite effectively to present a pic

men and their dates, all armed to
the teeth with cherry bombs and

throw beer at officers of the law

other to bits.

police force as the barricaded
peasants of the French Revolu
tion played against the soldiers
of the King; and as a whole it
gives the account of the party a
much more fantastic mythological
flavor.
These efforts to throw the party J
in such a good light are deeply ap
preciated by those who attended
the party. However, in all fair-]

served.
We tried; but out of 300 only i
one of us threw beer at a police j
man, and not more than two or ;
three had the foresight to bring
cherry bombs and these were
asked not to throw even their'
paltry supply. . . .
I think that you need not be so j
alarmed, because there are still
299 people who had the common !
decency not to throw beer at po
lice officers, and there were 296
people at the party who had the i
common sense not to bring cherry j
bombs.
This is the apparent fact we j
must face: that Stanford has pro
duced a system of such gross and
manifest injustice that it can pun
ish 350 fraternity men, because
within their ranks there are four,
possibly five, men who are guilty
of inconsiderate (not indecent)
actions.
The correction you are seeking

In regard to your editorial en
titled "Fraternity Penalty," which
appeared in last Wednesday's
Daily, these are some thoughts
that might be considered.
First, it is possible that, howev
er unintentionally, you have given

a slightly distorted picture of the
party in question. You state as a
fact that il took the entire police
force of Los Altos to break it up.
Actually someone announced that
the party was being closed, and
everyone left.
The "appalling" fact that 300
Stanford students were involved
is cited along with the observation
that "most Stanford students
probably agree that throwing beer
on uniformed officers and throw
ing cherry bombs in a crowd are
definitely beyond the bounds of
common sense and decency."
And liberally dispersed through
out the entire piece are such terms
and statements as "such action
can only be considered as a seri
ous breach of acceptable social
conduct" and"the seriousness of
the matter cannot be overstated."
