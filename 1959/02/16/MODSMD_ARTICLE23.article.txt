Miscarriage of Justice
hditor. The Daily:
Considering the misinformation
vvhich is being circulated by ru
mor, Cellar talk and biased pub
licity, we feel obligated to speak,
since, as Stanford women who at
ended TDK PARTY of Jan. 30,
we are in a position to know the
circumstances (i.e., details) first
hand. An understanding of these
circumstances makes us feel that
there has been a niiscai riage of
justice.
The Administration has dealt
an irreparable blow to .student
government and shown utter dis
regard for the decisions made by
competent student leaders. The
action taken by the clean's office
in throwing out the IPC's recoiii
mendations is clearly a sign of n<>
confidence in the ability of Stan
lord students to act maturely, in
telligently and justly.
Jim IJkropina, in speaking for
the IFC, speaks for students in
every area of Stanford life only
the implications a re broader. Our
abilily to function as reasonable
individuals has been seriously
questioned, if not impaired, arid
the incentive of st udent-adminis
tralive cooperation has indeed
been retarded.
Instead of "revamping Ihe liv
ing system," which would only
make us more dependent, Stan
lord students need the opportu
nity to accept responsibility,
make 1 h e i r own decisions and
then have those decisions put into
act ion.
It has been stated that "the de
tails aren't the significant mat
ter." This is true; they are insig
nificant because, as reported, they
are inaccurate and exaggerated.
But in view of the fact that the
party was closed, and the punish
ments were meted out on the
basis of such details, they cannot
be totally disregarded.
If details were unimportant,
then unequal punishments could
not have been imposed. The de
tails lost their significance only
when they did not serve the Ad
ministration in its attempt to jus
tify its action. However, there are
several which perhaps should be
called to the front just once more.
When the police asked that the
party be closed at 12:00 though
many there did noi understand,
because the party did not seem

out. of hand—there was Immedl
ale cooperation, and within lf»
minutes a party of 300 had clear
ed out in an orderly fashion. This
does not sound like the quelling
of a riot, as was reported.
In addition, it should he noted
that the individuals who took it
upon themselves to see that the
orders of the police were carried
out are members of iho groups
most severely punished.
Assuming (or at least hoping r
that we are considered responsi
hit* women hy the Administration,
we would like to accept, at least
verbally, a share of the responsi
hility for this affair. The least we
can ask is that we he kicked off
the campus with THE men.

Heredity or I tiviioiiincnt
Kititor, The Daily:
flow has Stan I' or d 112 a i 1 e d
through its living system and its
educational philosophy? This is
quite a statement and one which
I would like clarified. When some
thing does go wrong in a group
someone or thing is usually to
blame. Nowadays, of course, il is
never the person who committed
the act but, rather, his heredity or
his environment which is at fault.
At the moment Stanford Uni
versity is being blamed for the
actions of a few irresponsible in

dividuals. These include both
iome ol the males arid females
hat were present, regardless of
he fact that only the fraternities
rad to pay the penalty.
Granted that the actions of the
students do reflect on the Univer
sity, but does this warrant the
conclusion that the living system
and educational philosophy of the
Llnivf rsity have failed? Do you
advocate abolishment of fraterni
ties, manners and morals classes
compulsory for all freshmen,
more supervision from above,
liquor on campus or do you pro
pose a reorganization of the cur
riculum?
And it any of these things, if
instituted, will prevent a group
of you people assembling with
the purpose of drinking from he
coming drunk, obscene, disre
spectful and irresponsible, you
have done an excellent thing. Hut
you must remember that this has
been occurring for centuries and,
no doubt, will keep occurring.
This is the reason we have rules,
regulations, penalties, law offi
cers, etc.
What I find most regrettable
was the lack of responsibility
shown. 1 suppose none of these
students realized that they could
be setting fraternities back a few
years, at a time when the system
is being closely studied and many
strongly feeling that it is no asset
to the college community.

Stops had Loon t.ukon last quar
ter to accept the responsibilities
that go with their privileges, to
make tho system a positive force
on the campus: crippled children
were treated to a football game,
several fraternities took part in
community projects, a juvenile
delinquent counseling system was
being established and fraternity
grades showed improvement.
Ii is to be hoped that In the fu
lure the individual fraternity
members will realize that they
have a responsibility to the sys
tern and will accept this. Or else
i hoy might be depriving those
who come after them of the en
joyment and comradeship that
fraternities do offer.

11K Posit ion
I'Mitor, The Daily:
Wednesday's Letter to the Kdi
lor concerning disapproval of the
most recently submitted article of
an lIK political analyst was splen
did. The analyst's article obvious
ly caused reaction, no doubt dis
cussion, and a call to action. This
is what it was intended lo do.
Any article committed under
auspices of an 1111 political ana
lyst is the expression of one indi
vidual'-s thoughtful ideas on a
topic of international eonsidera
lion. The article would not reflect
UK policy or belief; the lIK is not
primarily a policy-making body.

I However, the Institute does sane
i lion I he thinking ol analyses when
; logical and pertinent.
The orthodoxy of the essays as
measured by public opinion or
what is "morally right" is not at
issue. Intelligent variety in analy
sis is good. It this occasionally
arches eyebrows but increases
perspective on key issues, we will
be happy and will have achieved
I our purpose.
Let us clarify our position,
therefore. We neither condemn
nor condone the stands taken by
lIK spokesmen. This applies to
both lilt political analysts and
! other Hit officers: the IIK-1 Club
! president, it may be remembered,
I was one of the signers ol a (lis
j sent iii!' let tor.
