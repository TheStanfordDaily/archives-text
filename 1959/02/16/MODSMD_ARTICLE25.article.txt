# JV's Set Scoring Mark; Frosh Split Two Games
## 
### 
A high school team that was
complolcly outclassed and a .jun
ior college team that didn't know
when to give up spelled the story
of Stanford's freshman basketball
team's weekend. The frosh look
an easy win from Lowell High
School 48-34 Friday, then losl a
real thriller to City College of
San Francisco 70-G9 Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Braves racked
up what is believed 1o be a Pavil
ion scoring record when they ran
over Ilartnell JC Saturday, 104-52.
Junior Mason Rylcs paced an ev
erybody-scorc .IV atlack with 18
points in the sparsely-attended 4
p.m. game.
On Friday the frosh played
just well enough to beat the Low
ell five handily. Finding that his
squad was able to score almost at
will, Fapoo.se coach Bill Turner
took out his first team with only
six minutes in the game.
None of the starting five saw any
furl her act ion.
Sub liill Cover was high for the

frosh with 14 points. Lowell's
fine sophomore, Bill Carter, was
game high with 15.
The Saturday game with CC
SF was altogether a different type
of contest. Neither team led by
more than four points through
out the first 25 minutes of the
game and during the second half
both teams had eight-point leads
which they could not hold.
With 1:28 remaining and the
Papooses on the short end of a GB
- score, John Windsor fouled
Cleo Cofield of the Rams for his
fifth foul. Cofield sank both shots
to make the score 70-(!7.
With 1:15 left a pass from Tom
Chase to Rich Hosley under the
basket for a bucket cut the Ram
lead to a single point. After the
ball had changed hands twice
Chase fouled Cofield with only 14 j
seconds remaining. Cofield
missed the shot and Hosley got
the rebound, but the Papooses
could not hit for the game-win
ning score as the buzzer sounded.

could not hit for the game-win
ning score as the buzzer sounded.
A high school team that was
complolcly outclassed and a .jun
ior college team that didn't know
when to give up spelled the story
of Stanford's freshman basketball
team's weekend. The frosh look
an easy win from Lowell High
School 48-34 Friday, then losl a
real thriller to City College of
San Francisco 70-G9 Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Braves racked
up what is believed 1o be a Pavil

over Ilartnell JC Saturday, 104-52.

erybody-scorc .IV atlack with 18

six minutes in the game.
None of the starting five saw any
furl her act ion.
Sub liill Cover was high for the

frosh with 14 points. Lowell's
fine sophomore, Bill Carter, was

of contest. Neither team led by
more than four points through
out the first 25 minutes of the
game and during the second half
both teams had eight-point leads
which they could not hold.
