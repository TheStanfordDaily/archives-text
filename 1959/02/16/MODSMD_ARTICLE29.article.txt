the Peninsula Ramblers 24-3 on
the Card rugby field Saturday.
The Indians held an 11-0 lead at
the half and added 13 points in

Led by the running of Jack Tay

left-foot kicking of Kyrk Reid, the
Cards easily disposed of the Ram
biers.
Stanford drew first blood in the
match when Eric Protiva scored
on a try after a blocked kick.
Reid, the kicking specialist, made
a penalty kick from a difficult
angle shortly after to give the
Cards a 6-0 lead.
Jack Taylor scored on a try lale
in the first half on a long run and
Reid added the conversion to give
the Indians an 11-0 halftime lead.
Early in the second half of ac

only score of the day on a penalty
kick. The Ramblers never seri
ously threatened after this.
Coach Pete Kmetovic singled
out Gary VanGalder and Protiva
as outstanding in the scrum, and
Dave Scholz and Taylor in ihe
backfield.
