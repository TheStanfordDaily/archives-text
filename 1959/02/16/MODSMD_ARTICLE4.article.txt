# AWS Conference Cites Women's Government
## 
### 
Miss Katherine Towle, Dean of Women at Cal, pointed out in a
speech last Saturday thai Stanford women have a unique opportunity
for self-government because they live 011 a completely residential
campus.
Dean Towle was speaking at the AYVS Winter Leadership Confer-

encc, as the keynote speaker.
In her address, "Leadership:
What and Why?" she stated that
both communication and partiie
pation are hindered when women
live off campus. She warned,
however, that extracurricular ac
tivities and student government
should be only an adjunct to ob
taining a college education.
Also al the conference, living
group presidents heard emeritus
Professor Lois M. Stol/. speak on
"What Is College For?"
Two Views
Dr. Stol/ said that women at
Stanford look at eolege from two
different views. One view is of
college as a continuation of child
hood, submitting with only pas
sive resistance lo adult - planned
education. These people miss the
real meaning of eolelge through
the attitude that it is something
that has to be done, and spend
their time trying to find the easi
est way to get through.
The other way of looking at
college is that it is something
new, a stage of "intermediate re
sponsibilities under guidance,"
she said. It is the job of campus
leaders lo help women realize this
so that they can "choose their
own ultimate goals and plan edu
cation for the long life ahead,"
she stated.
Against Isolation
Dr. Stol/. came out strongly
a g a i n s 1 isolat ion of freshman
women, and felt that they could
not get the proper perspective on
the purpose of college when they
were isolated from more mature
women.
She felt that the most impor
tant tiling a woman ea n get from
college is a feeling of self-worth
and the ability to contribute some
thing to society, either through a
job or community activities.
