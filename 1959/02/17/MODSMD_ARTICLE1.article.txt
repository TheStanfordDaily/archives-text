# BIG FOUR CONFERENCE
## West Calls on Russia To End German Crisis 
### 
WASHINGTON (/P)â€”'The West
ern Big Three called on Russia
Monday to join in a foreign min
isters' meeting, with East and
West Germans attending, to set
tle the German crisis before it
leads to war.
Virtually identical notes were
delivered to the Kremlin by the
United States, Britain and France.
So was a similar note from West
Germany.
Reject Russian Bids
They rejected Russia's Jan. .10
bid for a 28-nation German peace
conference and suggested that a
date and place be set by mutual
Big Four agreement for a foreign
ministers' meeting on the whole
German question.
The U.S. note restated the
West's determination not to be
driven out of Berlin by Soviet
threats and demands. It did ex
press willingness to negotiate all
aspects of the problem.
Officials said they hoped Rus
sia would respond favorably so
the meeting could start in Geneva
or Vienna in late April or early
May.
Timing Important
The timing is important. The
Soviets said Nov. 27 they would
turn East Berlin over to East Ger
many in six months, which would
be May 27, thereby giving the
East Germans control of the
West's access routes to West Ber
lin. The Russians also demanded
withdrawal of allied forces from
West Berlin and an East - West
German "confederation."
"The danger to world peace in
herent in this Soviet initiative is
evident," the allied notes said.
The United States, Britain and
France declared themselves ready
for a foreign ministers' meeting
with Russia. They said the date
and place should be settled
through diplomatic channels.
Dulles' Illness
Dulles' illness may cause a
hitch in plans for a mid-March
meeting at Paris of the foreign
ministers of the United States.
Britain, France and West Ger
many.
In London, British sources said
such a meeting might be switched
to Washington, so Dulles could
attend without having to fly the
Atlantic.
