# Violent Trend of Society Examined by Cousins
## Cites Peace Policy Based On Restraint, Intelligence 
### Cally Tanner 
Could it be that we now live in "the most primitive society in all
history?" asked editor Norman Cousins of a moderate-sized but
thoughtful crowd at Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
This appears to be the case, if we suppose that primitivencss is a
condition of "man's inability to anticipate the results of his actions,"

the actions being the use of atom
ic weapons.
Outlining the vast, potential of
our destructive weapons, Cousins
maintained that war is "unthink
able." "We have no defense ex
cept peace . . . seeing to it that
the bombs don't go off."
"The principal disease of man
today, and another evidence for
primit iveness, is his casual ap
proach to human violence, at a
time when violence is completely
unable to answer."
Victory and Vice
Describing the conditions re
sponsible for this detachment,
Cousins recalled his early church
experiences as "a cheering section
for our own side. Victory was the
primary goal, and violence was
secondary."
"My education prepared me for
the White - West haif of the
world," he continued, "on the as
sumption that Western man is
unique. But on what grounds is
he so?"
Some maintain that Christian
ity sets him apart. "I wish it were
true, but I must then ask, 'Where
are the Christians?" The ethical
life taught by Christ has been "fa
| tally divorced" from Christianity
today, he said.
Our contemporary fiction, tele
vision entertainment and sports
all depend on violence, that same
violence which would be required
to set off bombs, and yet we treat
it casually.
Impending Dangers
Today's ideological differences,
profound as they may be, are only
a superficial aspect of the impend
ing dangers. "Long before these
systems came about, the world
had war, under certain basic con
ditions. Ideologies may accelerate
a war, but they alone will not
cause it, he maintained.
War is a result of ignorance,
passiveness or a conviction that
"force is the only language," and
when two powers share this feel
ing, as they now do, "you can be
sure that this will be the medium
of communication."
With an eye to the future, Cous
ins said, "We must put human ex
perience and reason to work, by
completing this 'half education,'
and thereby shattering our de
tachment." An enlightened pub
lic opinion must reflect our con
cern.
Peace Policy
"I would like to see the United
States come before the UN and
proclaim a peace policy depend
ent on restraint and intelligence.
"I would like us to say that wc
would rather die ourselves than
cause others to die by our bombs."
Cousins described a "new Unit
ed Nations," with effective power
to compel disarmament, and thus
make the world safe for human
existence.
"The new UN should maintain
a world law," for the betterment
as well as the existence of man
kind.
