# Independent's Role
## 
### 
Stanford is diffkisknt from most universities in its housing pro
gram for men il oilers three distinct possibilities from wliioli
freshmen may choose. In the past, freshmen have been introduced
to two of these, w 11il*» the third living in Stanford Village —was
understandably left unmentioned.
In the last year or two, the housing facilities for inde
pendent men have been noticeably improved, but, more,
important, a positive independent program, referred to
as the "house system" has been inaugurated.
While this program is still in its infancy, we suggest that the
frosh men who remain independent by choice or chance this year
will be the ones who will bear a lot of the responsibility lor put
ting this new "house system into effect.
Because of this, we feel that freshmen should be intro
duced to the possibilities of this system before they make
their final decision as to where they will live for the next
three years.
Also, in order to give freshmen a clearer picture of the living
alternatives, some attempt should he made to acquaint them with
the benefits of independent living as well as the benefits of Ira
ternity and club life. I bis should include comment on ofl-campus
living as v\ell as living in the independent men's houses.
In accordance with this, we suggest the following:
/. /he Administration should publish a [Himphlet out
lining the objectives of the "house system,' discussing the
steps that have been taken so far to put it into effect, and
suggesting what is planned in the next few years. I hese
should be distributed to all freshmen.
2. I fol 11 id ii a I s/wnsors should invite independent men
to speak to tln-ir floors or wings of It ilbur as a whole,
A sponsor or group of sponsors can do this by simply con
tacting Dean Larimar in the Dean of Merits Office.
3. Independent men s houses should give freshmen the
opportunity tt> visit the house and meet some of the men,
either through an informal open house or by arranging
joint meetings with icings in It ilbur to hear a faculty
speaker.
\\ bile such a program might seem a contradiction of the defi
nition of an independent, we feel the value would outweigh the
slight sacrifice of "independence/' Such a program, coupled with
the regular fraternity and club rushing programs, would, we feel,
give the freshmen a more accurate picture of the housing possi
bilities that are available to him.
In view of the fact that more than a third of the frosli men
will remain independent, we suggest that independent men have
a responsibility to conduct this limited program to introduce fresh
men to the independent ways of living at Stanford.
