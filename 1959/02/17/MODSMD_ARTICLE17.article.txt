## Walter Lippmann Dulles is Needed 
### 
There is no reason to doubt that
John Foster Dulles will again
come out on top, carried through
his or''P n l not onlv by his stam
ina, which is fabulous, but. also
by the Knowledge that he is at:
this moment the indispensable
man. There have been times in
the past when things were at the
end of a chapter, and he could
with grace and dignity have made
way for a younger man. But not
just now. This is a period when
things are moving toward a cli
max, after which the world may
be very different, and he himself
is at the climax of his career.
There is no one else in the
Western world who has author
ity, comparable with his, to lead
the enormously complex nego
tiations about Germany aiul
about Europe which in one way
or another are now unavoidable
and imperative. If the West,
moves, as it must, from a pol
icy of standing pat to one of ne
gotiation and compromise, his
personal leadership will be the
best guarantee that flexibility is
not flabbiness and that a strong
and tough hand is in charge.
The Russians will make no dan
gerous mistakes while he is
there, and our allies will be
much less apprehensive.
One Question
There is one question which, if
we knew the answer to it, would
light up the whole situation. Why
is it that Moscow has opened up
Berlin and the German question
now rather than, let us say, two
years hence? The Russians know
quite well that German opinion is
evolving, and that Dr. Adenauer's
refusal to negotiate on a realistic
basis will not be held to by his
successor. In two years, Mr. Dul
les will be out of office, and until
very recently there was no differ
ence beHveen his position and Dr.

Adenauer's. In two years, more
over, there will be—if the Rus
sians believe what Senator Sy
mington and others say — a
J marked shift in the balance of
! power.
Why then are they in such a
hurry now? My own guess,
which rests only on hints and
inferences, is that they regard
the position in Eastern Ger
many and perhaps also in East
ern Europe as precarious, and
potentially explosive. They are
deeply concerned, as everyone
knows, about West German re
armament which will have been
achieved in about two years.
Why are they so concerned
about it when they themselves
have a very much bigger army,
and are also themselves a first
class nuclear power? When 1
asked some of the people I saw
in Moscow why they worried so
much about West German rear
mament when they could annihi
late West Germany with their
intermediate range missiles, the
stock answer was that they
feared an armed Germany backed
by the United States.
No Illusions
But 1 do not think that this
is the whole explanation of
their fear, or rather 1 do not
think that it spells out (he na
ture of their fear. My guess is
that they have no illusions
about the discontent of the East
Germans, and that what they
fear is that the East Germans,
when they see a strong West
German army less than two
hours away, may l>e sorely
tempted to start an uprising in
cahoots with officers of the
west German army. If that hap
pened, the fat would be in the
fire and both the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R. would be involved,

There is no reason to doubt that
John Foster Dulles will again
come out on top, carried through
his or''P n l not onlv by his stam
ina, which is fabulous, but. also
by the Knowledge that he is at:
this moment the indispensable
man. There have been times in
the past when things were at the
end of a chapter, and he could
with grace and dignity have made
way for a younger man. But not
just now. This is a period when
things are moving toward a cli
max, after which the world may
be very different, and he himself
is at the climax of his career.
There is no one else in the
Western world who has author
ity, comparable with his, to lead
the enormously complex nego
tiations about Germany aiul
about Europe which in one way
or another are now unavoidable
and imperative. If the West,
moves, as it must, from a pol
icy of standing pat to one of ne
gotiation and compromise, his
personal leadership will be the
best guarantee that flexibility is
not flabbiness and that a strong
and tough hand is in charge.
The Russians will make no dan
gerous mistakes while he is
there, and our allies will be
much less apprehensive.
One Question
There is one question which, if
we knew the answer to it, would
light up the whole situation. Why
is it that Moscow has opened up
Berlin and the German question
now rather than, let us say, two
years hence? The Russians know
quite well that German opinion is
evolving, and that Dr. Adenauer's
refusal to negotiate on a realistic
basis will not be held to by his
successor. In two years, Mr. Dul
les will be out of office, and until
very recently there was no differ
ence beHveen his position and Dr.

Adenauer's. In two years, more
over, there will be—if the Rus
sians believe what Senator Sy
mington and others say — a
J marked shift in the balance of
! power.
Why then are they in such a
hurry now? My own guess,
which rests only on hints and
inferences, is that they regard
the position in Eastern Ger
many and perhaps also in East
ern Europe as precarious, and
potentially explosive. They are
deeply concerned, as everyone
knows, about West German re
armament which will have been
achieved in about two years.
Why are they so concerned
about it when they themselves
have a very much bigger army,
and are also themselves a first
class nuclear power? When 1
asked some of the people I saw
in Moscow why they worried so
much about West German rear
mament when they could annihi
late West Germany with their
intermediate range missiles, the
stock answer was that they
feared an armed Germany backed
by the United States.
No Illusions
But 1 do not think that this
is the whole explanation of
their fear, or rather 1 do not
think that it spells out (he na
ture of their fear. My guess is
that they have no illusions
about the discontent of the East
Germans, and that what they
fear is that the East Germans,
when they see a strong West
German army less than two
hours away, may l>e sorely
tempted to start an uprising in
cahoots with officers of the
west German army. If that hap
pened, the fat would be in the
fire and both the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R. would be involved,
