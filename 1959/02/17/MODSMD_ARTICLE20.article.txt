# ‘Turkey Now European,’ Says State Dept. Visitor
## 
### 
"Turkey now regards itself as
a European country and has been
breaking away from the restric
tive customs of the past. There
has been an extraordinary out
burst of creative energy. In fact,
it is one of the great stabilizing
forces in the Middle East."
These are the opinions of Meh
met Muzaffer Gokmen, who is
employed by the United States
Department of State as director
of Beya/.it Public Library in .Is
tanbul. He has been visiting Stan
ford for a week accompanied by
a State Department escort-inter
preter.
"Since 1928 conditions in Tur
key have changed radically. The
Arabic script has been discarded
and Roman letters substituted.
The nation has been brought out
of the Middle Ages to the twenti

eth century," Cftkmen said.
As for the standard of living,
Gokmen emphasized that there
has been great improvement.
"The living standard in Turkey is
the best by far in the Middle East,
although it may nut be excellent
compared to the United Stales.
But nourishment:, education and
technical improvements have in
creased remarkably. All this
progress has been aided by rela
tive political stability, absence of
civil war and foreign invasion.
