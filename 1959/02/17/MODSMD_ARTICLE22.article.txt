Asian Criticizes Article
Editor, The Daily:
Lester O'Shea's political analy
sis which appeared in The Daily
Feb. l> has caused a tremendous
resentment on the pari of the
Alio Asian students because of
the naive (to say the least) way
in which he handled his subject.
Being an Asian myself, I would
like to state the following points
concerning thai article:
1. The writer's assumption that
a conflict is now existing between
the Afro-Asian nationalist move
merits and UN internationalism is
entirely false, because of the sim
ple fact that those movements
endeavor first of all to liberate
those countries from foreign (usu
ally known as imperialist) domi
nation, thus eliminating the ma
jor factor of instability. To recog
nize these liberation movements
is not only one of the main func
tions of true internationalism but
necessary to preserve internal ion
al peace.
2. Based on (lie above mention
ed assumption, Mr. O'Shea re
grets the mere fact that such
movements do exist. Why? lie
cause ". . . their raw materials
are very useful to the West and
are not better produced under in
competent, immature go v e r n
ments which, for that matter, is
not the best safeguard against
Communism, either."
Being incompetent and imma
ture (to go along with Mi'. O'-
Shea's mentality) is something
we can't help thanks to the West
who has been guiding us for cen
turies! All I can say is: wait and
see. But, please, don't play again
that monotonous tune of "We
Have Come to Civilize You and
Protect You from Communism."
We have had enough of that kind
of civilization. As for Commu
nism, it is up to us to follow, to
get along with, or to fight Com
munism.
3. When Indian schoolchildren
were forced to sing "Cod Save the
King," Mr. O'Shea calls this inter

ethnic allegiance. llow wqulrt he
like American schoolchildren to
sing, if the U.S.A. were occupied
by Russian troops, "God Save
Khrushchev"!
