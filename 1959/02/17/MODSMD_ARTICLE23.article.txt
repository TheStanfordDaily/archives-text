As (»oo<l as Disneyland
The }>ig rush is coming on. The person who said, "Wait till spring
if yon want to see a lot of sports events all at once," might lake a
look at the coming weekend.
To put it briefly: Stanford learns will he engaged in six basketball
games, three baseball games, a tennis match, a wrestling match, a
rugby match, a gymnastics meet, a big intra squad track meet, one
swimming meet Friday and one Kl(> swimming meet Saturday.
There may be more. But that's enough for'a start.
The attention vv>ll he focused on two points: Los Angeles Friday
and Saturday nights; Stanford pools Saturday afternoon.
In the Southland, this school's hustling ("hustling," for want of a
better word actually, that is an understatement for Coach Howie
D&llmar's live) varsity basketball team will continue its fight lo
stay alive in the championship
race of tlit- Pacific ( oast Confer-

ence.
Stay at homers will have lots to
watch (the varsity hoop games
are the only events away from
home), and the highlight of the
whole affair is certain lo be Satur
day's swimming meet with CSC.
Hoili the Tribe and the Tro,jails
claim ' best-ever" teams. The In
dians drowned IJCLA, 73-13, last
week (the Bruins went up and
l>eat Cal the next day). SC has
its fabulous Aussies Murray
Hose and John llenricks. Stan
ford has its Kobin Moore, George
Harrison and Tom Petersen,
among others.
... It could be the greatest
collegiate dual swimming meet
ever staged in these parts. Or
anywhere, for that matter. %
It costs oidy 50 cents. They're
trying to make too much money,
you say? Fifty cents didn't seem
to faze the packed houses at two
boxing matches last week. The

attraction is there now see if you can get a scat

The Saga of Terrence Hot Dog
F.ncina Gym was a mighty crowded place last Monday and Thurs
day evenings. A good GOO people each lime I hey saw some great
shows put on by what used to be called Stanford's "minor" sports
teams.
Feature of the week had to be Trev Grimm's first-round t-k-o of
Santa Clara's vastly outclassed .Max Baer Jr. in Monday night's box
ing matches. Thursday, the wrestling team's brilliant comeback win
over Santa Clara was pretty popular with the customers, too.
Biggest laugh that night, though, came when an apparently in
spired group of California rooters decided they might take on ihe
whole crowd in a bit of unscheduled fisticuffs.
This all came about as a defense to their poor hero, Terrence (One-
Punch or Kayo—take your pick) Hallinan, who was nearly booed out
of the gym after giving a performance that puts him in first place
in the run for Hot Dog of the Year honors.
After Terrence bad been given quite a battle by Stanford's not
nearly-as touted Talton Ray. Terrence certainly must rank with the
best hitters-on-the-break we've seen in some time, as well as one of
the more accomplished hot dogs.
But Terrence won, and Cal won the match, thanks to an unpopu
lar first-bout draw. The Bears didn't leave the Gym, however, until
they had seen their heavyweight hopeful, a giant named Jack Do
mich, get knocked around the ring for three rounds by this little
Grimm fellow.
The boxing-wrestling "double-header" came off very well, the
packed house seemed to thoroughly enjoy the affair. The only thing
wrong was that somebody got anxious, and the boxing matches were
started before the final, and deciding, wrestling match was over.
Our Wonderful Pavilionites
Few as they may be (at some events), Stanford fans have their
good times. But they were really robbed of one this year when a
UCLA guard named Denny Miller decided to forgo basketball for a
movie contract. Miller -and nobody who saw him at the Cow Palace
in December can deny that he certainly looks the part—has since
become the new Tarzan. Of the Apes.
He also quit school.
So, Warnell—he of the rocking chair feet—Jones and Olympian
Rafer Johnson became the Uclans singled out by the wolves for all
kinds of wrath Friday night. The PCC's top scorer, Walt Torrence,
took his share, too; just like all top scorers.
And it might be offered here that Wall Torrence spells his name
Walt Torrence, not Wall Torrance, as the readers of some campus
newspapers might be led to believe.
Oregon's poor soul Saturday night really co-operated. He was
Dale of the flying elbows llerron, who recently has enjoyed a
few 20-plus evenings, llerron burned up the Pavilion nets for one
point, missing on eight shots from the field before Coach Sieve lielko
gave up on him.
The Pavilionites, led by the Red-Vest hand, were delighted.
Too bad Ihe Cards had to [day St. Mary's at the Cow Palace this
year. Tom (The Jaw) Merscliery or Laroy (Yul) Doss would have
been great to pick on at the Pavilion. It's not going to be near as
much fun watching Oregon State play this year, with Dave Gamhcc
gone.
