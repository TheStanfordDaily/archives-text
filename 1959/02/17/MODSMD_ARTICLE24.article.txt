# 5-7 JOHN NOURSE
## Little Man Soars To Great Heights DAILY Sports SCENE 
### Dick Barnes 
When a high jumper can clear
his own height, it's considered
"not bad." When he can add three
or four inches onto that, he's get
ting darned good. And when he
can clear nine inches over his
height, it's close to amazing.
Hut that's precisely what sopho
more John Nourse did here Sat
urday in AAU developmental
track competition.
A transfer lo Stanford from
Menlo College; Nourse had been
concentrating on the hurdles,
with nary a though! for high
jumping.
No one else thought much of
high jumping for Nourse either
he's only 5-7. But came Saturday
and a poor race in the hurdles, so
a disgusted Nourse headed for the
high jump pit.
When he was through, he had
cleared 6-4 and established him
self as quite possibly the number
one Indian in an event where the
Cards appeared to be in plenty of
t rouble.
Best Is \V,\
An idea of the magnitude of
jumping nine inches over one's
height can be seen in the fad that
the highest any jumper has ever
gone over the top of his head is
13 >4 inches.
This best - ever foal was per
formed by a Nigerian in winning
the 1951 British Empire Games.
Probably the best - known high
jumper to get more than a foot
over his height is Phil Reavis, the
ex-Villanova star. lie stands 5 9 : !i,
and cleared 6-10 last season.
Even new world indoor record
holder John Thomas has gone
only eight inches over his head in
jumping an even 7 feet.
No jumper is ever given much
of a chance to get more than a
foot over his height but with
nine inches already out of the way
in a mid-February effort, there's
no telling just what Nourse might
do for Coach Payton Jordan when
the season moves into high gear
and jumping conditions improve.
More Good Discus News
N'ourse's wasn't the only good
showing Saturday the discus
throwers again came through. Ar
mand DeWeese was the big gun
this time with a throw of 166
feet, his best-ever in competition.
And Harlan Limmer was also
in the all-time best category with
a throw of 161-4. The progress of
each is moving close to that of
Fred Peters two years ago when
he became one of the nation's
leading collegiate platter men.
Keith Wallace again lowered
his two-mile personal best with a
9:09.3 effort. This leaves him
only 4.4 seconds shy of Maury
Graves' school record.
National Junior Heeord
Wallace's previous best of
9:11.9 came in December, shortly
before his 19th birthday. Ii cur
rently stands as the American
Junior record in the two-mileâ€”a
junior being defined as any run
ner under 19 years of age.
Sprinter Norman Pease also
had his best day of the winter,
whipping off a 21.9 220. But then
he got a bit enthused over winter
sports Saturday evening and pro
ceeded to knock himself out for
several valuable days with an ice
skating gash.
The big lest of the winter for

Jordan's men will come Saturday
in an intra-squad meet, to be held
in conjunction with a track coach
es' clinic here. All except sick or
injured team members will face
the stopwatch or tape measure
test.
