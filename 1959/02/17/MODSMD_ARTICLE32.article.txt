# Cuban Students Rebelled Against Batista Regime
## 
### Bruce Smith 
Students the world over seem
to enjoy pursuing leisure time ac
tivities. Occasionally, however,

youthful energies are turned to j
more serious pursuits, as in Hun
gary and more recently in Cuba.
The Federacion Estudiantil Uni
versitaria, composed of Cuban \
students, was among the first or
ganized groups to express public
opposition to Batista when he
gained control in 1952.
The FEU organized its own re
sistance movement, the Revolu
tionary Directorate, which be
came one of Fidel Castro's co
horts. Eventually the Directorate!
had its own army and harassed i
Batista independenll y
After Batista fled the students
wanted to retain their arms to
"safeguard Cuba," but were
forced to turn them in to Castro's
dominant rebels.
Momentarily peace rests on
Cuba, but the students are ready
to lake up arms again to defend j
Cuba's constitution.
