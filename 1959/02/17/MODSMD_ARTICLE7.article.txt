## Council Ok Needed for Overnights 
### 
Stanford coeds must tempora
rily notify a member of Women's
Council before taking a mid-week
overnight leave, the Council ruled
Monday.
This action has been taken in
order to determine the number of
mid-week leaves being used and
for what reasons. This policy will
be in effect for about the next
three weeks, when Council ex
pects to have enough information
to be able to clarify the women's
social regulations concerning mid
week overnignts.
The move was prompted be
cause it has been brought to the
attention of Council that a con
siderable number of mid-week
overnights are being taken for
unknown or questionable reasons.
The present rule allows an over
night for "visiting families,
friends and relatives, provided it
is not used for an extended late
leave."
.Registered parties with Univer
sity-approved ehaperones are ac
ceptable but "these circumstances
do not include overnights to study
or 'to get away from it all.' "
Intended for Weekends
"Since Stanford is a residential
campus, the spirit of the social
regulations assumes that over
night late leaves shall be used on
weekends."
"If circumstances arrive which
require the use of an overnight
leave during the week, the wom
an should inform her director or
RA or provide the explanation for
her taking the overnight leave on
the back of her sign-out slip."
Now permission will automati
cally be granted for the following
reasons: (1) medical or dental
appointments, (2) parents visit
ing in this area, (3) call home by
parents, (4) illness.
Permission may also be granted
for other reasons if (lie Council
member feels llicy arc valid.

Stanford coeds must tempora
rily notify a member of Women's
Council before taking a mid-week
overnight leave, the Council ruled
Monday.
This action has been taken in
order to determine the number of
mid-week leaves being used and
for what reasons. This policy will
be in effect for about the next
three weeks, when Council ex
pects to have enough information
to be able to clarify the women's
social regulations concerning mid
week overnignts.
The move was prompted be
cause it has been brought to the
attention of Council that a con
siderable number of mid-week
overnights are being taken for
unknown or questionable reasons.
The present rule allows an over
night for "visiting families,
friends and relatives, provided it
is not used for an extended late
leave."
.Registered parties with Univer
sity-approved ehaperones are ac
ceptable but "these circumstances
do not include overnights to study
or 'to get away from it all.' "
