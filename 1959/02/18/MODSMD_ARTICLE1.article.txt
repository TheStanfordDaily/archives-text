Asking about Stanford-in-Ger
many, "Is il a success?" Professor
F. W. Strothmann drew enthusi
astic applause from Stuttgart vet
erans in the audience Tuesday

German-made, film on "The Burg"
which was followed by a color
film on Stanford-in-California.

Be lit els bach.
The film itself showed the care
free life of the Stanford students
as they ate heartily of Swabian
food, drank beer in their Raths
keller, and danced with their Ger
man friends at the full-moon fes
tival ending their stay.
Germans Inquisitive
According to Strothmann, the
Germans wanted to know why
Stanford students were there and
what a private university was. A
Stanford student explained this
to the TV viewers, speaking in
German without a script.
"After about one quarter the
students were able to speak Ger
man rather fluently. They could
make perfectly clear what they
wanted to say."
Germans were interested in the
fact that Stanford students
"brought their sense of distance
with them," and succeeded in see
ing a good part of Europe, mak
ing trips to Munich, Venice and
Berlin in their spare moments.
