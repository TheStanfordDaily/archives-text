## Nuclear Power Plants Unsound 
### 
Large nuclear powei pi,-mis for domestic use are economically
unsound and an additional drain on I lie taxpayer, said Leo A. lluard,
a Georgetown University law professor.
Writing in the current issue of the Stanford Law Review, Pro
fessor Huard points out that the newly established nuclear reactor at
Shippingport, Pa., cost 577,500,000 to build and produces 60,000 kilo
watts "in an area where elect rieity is abundant at a much lower cost."
Four more reactors are planned for areas in which they will be
costly to operate and expensive to build, he declared.
Although the risk of a reactor accident with a major effect on
the public has been estimated to be as rare as one in a billion per
year per reactor, this factor cannot be disregarded, Professor Huard
said. "A rash of radiation injury litigation is bound to accompany
several industrial uses o radioactive isotopes," he added.
If the United States fponsors such a power development project
tinder the foreign aid program, he writes, then "this policy must be
executed with the utmoK wisdom." He contends that any radiation
accidents on foreign soil which cause personal injury and property
damage will give "this country's cold-war opponents a powerful new
weapon."
Professor Huard points out that this does not mean that a foreign
reactor construction program is an unsound idea. As he sees it, such
a program would enable this country to help the free world achieve
leadership through peact'ul use of such power.
Limited domestic nuc.car power, Increased basic and applied re
search, foreign reactor tonst ruction and radioisotope expansion is
the course which "seems best for this country and the free world,"
ho concluded.
