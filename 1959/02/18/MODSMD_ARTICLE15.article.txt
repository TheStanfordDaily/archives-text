# 20-Inch Vanguard Flashes into Orbit
## Satellite Carries 'Observer' To Check, Report Weather 
### 
WASHINGTON (/}') An American .satellite carrying a miniature,
mechanical weather observer flashed into orbit around the earth
Tuesday.
The basketball-sized satellite is equipped to check up and report
back on the earth's cloud cover and thus help spot storm clouds or

tornadoes.
The satellite, Vanguard 11, may
whirl on through spare for years
or even centuries. But the bat
teries for its weather eyes - a
pair of photoelectric cells — can
operate continuously for only two
weeks.
And at first it may take two
weeks to process the information
relayed back to earthbound sci
entists by the 20-inch, 21'/a-pound
globe.

Yet the launching of the satel
lite was an epochal stride toward
using man-made moons to help
improve short- and long-range
weather forecasts. Still farther
in the future is a possibility that
satellites may help humans with
the control of weather.
A remodeled version of the
Vanguard rocket, which was a
$100 million fizzle in six of seven
earlier tries, shot the satellite into
orbit. Cape Canaveral, Fla., was
the launching spot.
Smooth Firing
All three stages fired smoothly.
Right from the start there was
every indication the shoot was
completely successful.
Director T. Keith Glennan told
a news conference the artificial
moon is circling the earth every
126 minutes at altitudes varying
from 335 to 2050 miles.
First checks showed the speed
varies from 14,000 to 18,000
m.p.h., with the satellite traveling
faster when it is closer to the
earth.
Glennan said the new satellite
swings 34 degrees north and
south of the equator on each cir
cuit of the earth. On that basis,
Vanguard II should be able to
check up every day on nearly a
fourth of the earth's sunlit sur
face. Most of the area will be
north of the equator.

The basketball-sized satellite is equipped to check up and report
back on the earth's cloud cover and thus help spot storm clouds or

tornadoes.
The satellite, Vanguard 11, may
whirl on through spare for years
or even centuries. But the bat
teries for its weather eyes - a
pair of photoelectric cells — can
operate continuously for only two
weeks.
And at first it may take two
weeks to process the information
relayed back to earthbound sci
entists by the 20-inch, 21'/a-pound
globe.
Improve Forecasts
Yet the launching of the satel
lite was an epochal stride toward
using man-made moons to help
improve short- and long-range
weather forecasts. Still farther
in the future is a possibility that
satellites may help humans with
the control of weather.
A remodeled version of the
Vanguard rocket, which was a
$100 million fizzle in six of seven
earlier tries, shot the satellite into
orbit. Cape Canaveral, Fla., was
the launching spot.
Smooth Firing
All three stages fired smoothly.
Right from the start there was
every indication the shoot was
completely successful.
Director T. Keith Glennan told
a news conference the artificial
moon is circling the earth every
126 minutes at altitudes varying
from 335 to 2050 miles.
First checks showed the speed
varies from 14,000 to 18,000
m.p.h., with the satellite traveling
faster when it is closer to the
earth.
Glennan said the new satellite
swings 34 degrees north and
south of the equator on each cir
cuit of the earth. On that basis,
Vanguard II should be able to
check up every day on nearly a
fourth of the earth's sunlit sur
face. Most of the area will be
north of the equator.
