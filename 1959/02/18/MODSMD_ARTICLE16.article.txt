# SRI Economics To Australia
## 
### 
Two Stanford Research Insti
tute economists, L. Victor Riches
and Carl A. Trexcl, Jr., have left
to undertake a survey of invest
ment opportunities in the state of
Victoria. They will he joined there
by four Australian economists
who will participate in the proj
ect.
The group will study Victoria's
resources, technology, marketing
procedures and industrial climate.
The goal is to identify a number
of specific industrial opportuni
ties for overseas investors.
Victoria's most important ad
vantage is its growth potential,
says Paid J. Lovewell, director of
economics research at the Insti
tute. Lovewell, who made a pre
liminary survey of the area last
year, noted that Victoria's tux
laws and policy are more favor
able to capital gains and to cor
porate earnings retention than
are similar laws in the United
States.
This is the first research of its
type to be undertaken in Austra
lia and marks SRI's initial re
search effort there. However,
this is not the Institute's first
venture into the international
field, having performed research
in 35 countries during the past
yea r.
