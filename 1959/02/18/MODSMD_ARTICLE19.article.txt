# 'Hound Dogs' In Production
## 
### 
DOWNEY, Calif. (A 3 ) â€”A piano
borne missile, that can help its
mother airplane take off and then
guide a Bo2G bomber more accu
rately than the plane can navigate
itself, is in production here.
This new weapon, shaping up
at North American Aviation's
missile division, is known offi
cially as the GAM 77 air-to-surface
missile. The missile is commonly
referred to as the "Hound Dog."
Together with the Boeing 852G
bomber that carries it, the mis
sile makes up a Strategic Air
Command weapon system sched
uled for deployment in 1960.
Much about the missile is still
secret.
