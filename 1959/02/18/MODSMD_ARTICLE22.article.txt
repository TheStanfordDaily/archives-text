For thf. \fat ffw vvffks woiiK'ti desiring I<Â» lake midweek. over

litis ternporary procedure. has been instituted because
it has been brought lit ( imm il s (it trillion I lint a consider
able number of midweek overnights are being taken for
unknown reasons or for questionable reasons (i.e., reasons
not stated in the women's social regulations).
After several weeks of galtiering information about the number
of and the reasons for midweek overnights, (louncil experts to he
in a position to clarify the present regulation governing them.
However, Women's C.ouncil is not a legislative body
and does not have the power to change the present regu
lation. Any alteration must be instituted by the women
through /JU Sand voted upon in referendum by women
of the student boilv.
We submit that there is room for change in the present regu
lation, beyond mere clarification, on at least two counts:
1. What difference is there between a midweek and a week-end
overnight, from the standpoint of valid reasons?
2. W by should a genuine desire for a temporary change of
atmosphere he frowned upon as a reason for taking an overnight?
We ask the first question fully aware that there are classes on
weekdays that students should attend. However, many students
have few or no 'classes on some weekdays.
We offer the second question fully cognizant of the value of
the ideal of a residence university. We do not feel, however, that
a residence campus is of value if it is arbitrarily and totally im
plemented: indeed, there are very few things which remain of
value when enacted in the extreme.
We do not feel that the "cliange-of-atmosphere'* mid
week overnight would, in practice, be used frequently
enough by most women to detract substantially from a
residence campus. Those few who abused this overnight
could be dealt ivith individually.
Furthermore, we feel that the burden of proof of the desira
bility of a residence campus rests upon the students, faculty and
Administration living here, it cannot he legislated.
We hope Stanford women are concerned enough about this
matter to petition AWS for a re-evaluation of the midweek over
night regulation.
