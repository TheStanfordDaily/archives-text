Editor, The Daily:
In reading Jane Rutledge's
"mild criticism" of Mr. O'Shea's
article published several days ago,
we were very much disturbed that
her unfair and unsubstantiated
opinion was a reflection on the
entire freshman class.
Although Miss Rutledge may re
gard herself as "MERELY . r i fresh

man," there are other-s of us who
do not consider being a freshman
at all degrading, and who appre
ciate and fully agree with Mr.
O'Shea's article.
It is our sincere wish that Mi«s
Rutledge will henceforth express
her opinions in her own name
without trying to assume an atti
tude for the entire freshman class.
