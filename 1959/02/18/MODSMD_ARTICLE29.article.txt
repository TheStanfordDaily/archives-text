reer in orderly musical sequence.!
i It began with study as a boy on
the violin and then the cello
debut at age 11 and progressed
with strings to his organization of
the Barbirolli Chamber Orchestra
after World War 1.
A transition to conducting came
initially with the orchestra of the

ing at the London Symphony and
Royal Philharmonic Society con
certs in 1927, and later with the
Scottish Orchestra and the Leeds
Symphony.
Barbirolli came to the United
States in 1936 to inherit leader
ship of the New York Philhar
monic Orchestra, where here- 1
mained until a 1943 migration
back to England and the llalle
Orchestra. He had not appeared

j Gabriel Fa lire's Suite from "Pel-
J leas and Melisande," Op. 80, writ
ten in 1901 from the incidental

somewhat classic style.
There will also l>e the seldom

music as a recollection of Music I.
Conductor Enrique Jorda has I
gone to Baltimore to guest-con
duct there, so the San Francisco
Symphony will play this week for
Sir John Barbirolli, regular con
ductor of the Halle Orchestra of!
Manchester, England.
Sir John has performed his ca
reer in orderly musical sequence.!
i It began with study as a boy on
the violin and then the cello
debut at age 11 and progressed
with strings to his organization of
the Barbirolli Chamber Orchestra
after World War 1.
A transition to conducting came
initially with the orchestra of the
British National Opera Company.
It continued with guest conduct
ing at the London Symphony and
Royal Philharmonic Society con
certs in 1927, and later with the
Scottish Orchestra and the Leeds
Symphony.
Barbirolli came to the United
States in 1936 to inherit leader
ship of the New York Philhar
monic Orchestra, where here- 1
mained until a 1943 migration
back to England and the llalle
Orchestra. He had not appeared
in this country since that time.
Opening tonight's program is i
his own arrangement of "An Eli/.-;
abethan Suite for String Orches
tra and Four French Horns."
Then comes French composer
j Gabriel Fa lire's Suite from "Pel-
J leas and Melisande," Op. 80, writ
ten in 1901 from the incidental
music to Maeterlinck's play of the 1

samp name. Faur£ managed 1o
speak his romantic mind in a
somewhat classic style.
There will also l>e the seldom
aired "Partita," l>y Britain's Wil
liam Walton, a craftsman who
writes sparingly and well, careful
ly selecting his moods, rhythms
and phrase lengths. He effects
full-sounding compositions with
out especially elaborate orchestra
tions. Walton has said that for
him great music must he so with
in the context of its own experi
ence, besides having some univer
sality.
fn conclusion, Barbirolli will
conduct Beethoven's Symphony
No. 5 in C Minor, Op. (>7, which
requires little comment for Stan
ford students who have even so
introductory an acquaintance with
music as a recollection of Music I.
