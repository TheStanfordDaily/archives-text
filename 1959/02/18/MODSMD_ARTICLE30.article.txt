I lie JNi<;!it in Question
Editor, The Daily:
However inebriated I may have
been on the nigh! in question. I
remember quite distinctly that I
was not al the now infamous Los
Alios fraternity affair.
I am certain that I have not
recently adorned any officers of
the law with alcoholic beverages,
and thai 1 have not thrown a
cherry bomb into Ihe midst of a
crowded room in at least two
weeks. (However, as to the for
mer action, I must confess that I
woujd quite happily emulate it,
should the opportunity present it
self.)
Your report of the incident stat
ed that approximately 300 Stan
ford students were involved. I
think you would agree that, even
if we were to assume that all of
them were officer-assaulting, cher
ry-bomb - throwing brigands, the
percentage (300 out of 8,000) is
.still respectably small.
In \ iew of the preceding, I some
how fail to see Ihe basis of your
call to arms in the editorial of
Wednesday, Feb. 11. Upon read
ing it, I was alarmed to discover
that "Stanford has failed." The
following line promised irta proper
retribution for my existence:
thing-s are going to be changed, it
thundered, so as to make certain
I become "the type of individual
desired."
In truth, had 1 known such ac
tion was forthcoming, I would
have seen to it that I, for one, de
served it. It strikes me rather un
just to punish a man without al
lowing him the luxury of break
ing the law.
All of this is not by way of dis
illusioning you. It is simply a
polite way of stating flatly thai I
do not want to become "the type
of individual desired" - whatever
that may be. If my only distinc
tion as a young man is that of
being "undesirable," I shoul d
thank you not to take il away.
Resides, unbeknownst to those
who have planned so assiduously
for my future. 1 have grown a pot
belly and, sadly enough, will not,
fit into the prefabricated tuxedo.
Indeed, I should like lo fit, to be
oi I lie right shape and opinion
would that 1 were! But candor
compels me to admit that I am
not.
I do not believe that Stanford
has failed; I do not believe that I
have failed. Moreover, 1 do not
think that those drunken and sen
sual fraternities, which you do
happily damn, have failed.
Take il for a rule: anyone who
wants to shout, who is expected
to shout, will succeed in finding
something lo shout about. Since
such shouting is intended not to
help or lo construct, but to gain
attention and to destroy, you
might at least be so kind as to
keep it vague and/or harmless.
This spring Ihe University Cho
rus will sing Bach's B Minor - Mass
'.villi the San Francisco Sympho
ny. After hearing it I am certain
that the audience will not, despite
your righteous declarations, con
clude tlicit Stanford has failed.

Defense Not Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Now that it's established that
Mr. O'Shea is not responsible for
the headline given his "political
analysis" in last Friday's Daily
(Feb. 6), perhaps he no longer
needs any defense against most of
the criticisms printed so far, most
of which arc based on the article's
failure to support that headline.
Still, perhaps a few soothing
words might find something to
soothe.
I think the best defense for Mr.
O'Shea's article is that it doesn't
actually say very much.
Surely his principal point that
there is considerable Afro-Asian
nationalism, and that this phe
nomenon is less than optimum for
the well-being of the West is a
fact not denied by East, West, or 1
any tertium quid. He never does
say the phenomenon is therefore
to lie condemned, clear though il
may be that lie would like to.
What seems to be most objec
tionable in t he article is the asser
tion that "there is at present a
general absence of trained natives
able to provide intelligent, mature
administration."
This may indeed lie a nasty
thing to say about the new Afro-
A-sian nations, but does it really
mean anything? The same remark
could well be applied to the United
States. It all depends on one's
idea of what constitutes "intelli
gent, mature administration"
and Mr. O'Shea is merely apply
ing HIS idea. To quarrel with il,
I think, is to take it more serious
ly than it deserves.
I join with the critics in regret
ling thai the article was published
as an "lIR political analysis" and
with a misleading headline. With
out these, perhaps we could call
it a political lyric and enjoy it.

Editor, The Daily:
It, was wilh some grief that 1
read Mr. O'Shea's article "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. 6).
Mi 1 . O'Shea says thai Afro-
Asian awakening and nationalism
mean declining of the "Western
variety of the animal." If the im
portance and power of the West
depends on bearing down on Af
rica and Asia; if the West can
maintain its strength only at the
expense of Afro-Asian self-respect
only on Afro-Asian submissive
ncss then what Mr. O'Shea is
afraid of is inevitable. And Mi - .
O'Shea may he right.
This, however, does not threat
en UN internationalism unless, of
course, the existence and success
of the UN depends on it. Wc hope
it. does not.
But Mr. O'Shea goes further:
to cover up the real cause of his
fear - , he resorts to outright insult,
fie calls our rulers immature and

incompetent. This wc resent.
Incidentally, Jane Rut lodge in
her letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 10) puts an amusing twist
to the issue. She writes: ". . . to
degrade African government is to
degrade the British administra
tion and the English educational
system in Africa."
Maybe we are illiterate, imma
ture, and our culture still of the
Stone Age type. But you know,
Mr. O'Shea, if you keep telling us
of our weak points we might feel
insulted.
You claim that from a practical
point of view the rise of newly
independent states is not desira
ble. "From whose practical point
of view?" I ask.
I hardly think that as an Amer
ican you believe that the Decla
ration of Independence was the
wrong move. But the United
States and Great Britain are on
good terms now. Has this threat
ened UN internationalism?

Comment on I liree Points
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 14
contains a letter from Messrs.
Ptoudfool and Willemsen regard
ing the lIR article written by Les
ter O'Shea. I am tempted to com
menl on Ihe three points in their
letter.
"1. The rise of Afro-Asian na
tionalism endangers ihe 'interests'
of Ihe United States. Though a
foreign citizen may say, 'So
what ?', it is a serious point to an
American."
This statement assumes that
Ihe U.S. political and commercial
interests are equivalent to inter
national "well-being." The logic
smacks of 19th-century European
colonial thought. I presume that
the lIR article did not have this
much of an ethnocentric frame of
reference.
"2. In many of these countries
there is a lack of adequately train
ed administrators . . . we may
hope in ihe near future (perhaps
w.hen those people currently being
trained . . .) it will be solved."
This point needs, I think, a
straight question: do these friends
know the history and the problem
of administration in these coun
tries? I would recommend the
"Gattenby's Report" on Indian ad
ministration problems. The seri
ous barrier to economic develop
ment is not in sufficiently trained
administrator's (trained in the
West) but not sufficcntly Indian
ized adminislralors.
"3. That nationalism hampers
'interethnie' cooperation . . ."
Nationalism and "inlerethnic"
cooperation" (incidentally, the
term means very little in view of
llie modern trends of thinking on
internalional affair's) are concen
tric concepts and are not mutually
exclusive of each other. Besides,
the example (Pakistan) cited is
an expression of inadequate ap
praisal of Ihe story of Ihe birth
I of Pakistan. . . .

Defense Not Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Now that it's established that
Mr. O'Shea is not responsible for
the headline given his "political
analysis" in last Friday's Daily
(Feb. 6), perhaps he no longer
needs any defense against most of
the criticisms printed so far, most
of which arc based on the article's
failure to support that headline.
Still, perhaps a few soothing
words might find something to
soothe.
I think the best defense for Mr.
O'Shea's article is that it doesn't
actually say very much.
Surely his principal point that
there is considerable Afro-Asian
nationalism, and that this phe
nomenon is less than optimum for
the well-being of the West is a
fact not denied by East, West, or 1
any tertium quid. He never does
say the phenomenon is therefore
to lie condemned, clear though il
may be that lie would like to.
What seems to be most objec
tionable in t he article is the asser
tion that "there is at present a
general absence of trained natives
able to provide intelligent, mature
administration."
This may indeed lie a nasty
thing to say about the new Afro-
A-sian nations, but does it really
mean anything? The same remark
could well be applied to the United
States. It all depends on one's
idea of what constitutes "intelli
gent, mature administration"
and Mr. O'Shea is merely apply
ing HIS idea. To quarrel with il,
I think, is to take it more serious
ly than it deserves.
I join with the critics in regret
ling thai the article was published
as an "lIR political analysis" and
with a misleading headline. With
out these, perhaps we could call
it a political lyric and enjoy it.

It, was wilh some grief that 1
read Mr. O'Shea's article "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. 6).
Mi 1 . O'Shea says thai Afro-
Asian awakening and nationalism
mean declining of the "Western
variety of the animal." If the im
portance and power of the West
depends on bearing down on Af
rica and Asia; if the West can
maintain its strength only at the
expense of Afro-Asian self-respect
only on Afro-Asian submissive
ncss then what Mr. O'Shea is
afraid of is inevitable. And Mi - .
O'Shea may he right.
This, however, does not threat
en UN internationalism unless, of
course, the existence and success
of the UN depends on it. Wc hope
it. does not.
But Mr. O'Shea goes further:
to cover up the real cause of his
fear - , he resorts to outright insult,
fie calls our rulers immature and

incompetent. This wc resent.
Incidentally, Jane Rut lodge in
her letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 10) puts an amusing twist
to the issue. She writes: ". . . to
degrade African government is to
degrade the British administra
tion and the English educational
system in Africa."
Maybe we are illiterate, imma
ture, and our culture still of the
Stone Age type. But you know,
Mr. O'Shea, if you keep telling us
of our weak points we might feel
insulted.
You claim that from a practical
point of view the rise of newly
independent states is not desira
ble. "From whose practical point
of view?" I ask.
I hardly think that as an Amer
ican you believe that the Decla
ration of Independence was the
wrong move. But the United
States and Great Britain are on
good terms now. Has this threat
ened UN internationalism?

Comment on I liree Points
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 14
contains a letter from Messrs.
Ptoudfool and Willemsen regard
ing the lIR article written by Les
ter O'Shea. I am tempted to com
menl on Ihe three points in their
letter.
"1. The rise of Afro-Asian na
tionalism endangers ihe 'interests'
of Ihe United States. Though a
foreign citizen may say, 'So
what ?', it is a serious point to an
American."
This statement assumes that
Ihe U.S. political and commercial
interests are equivalent to inter
national "well-being." The logic
smacks of 19th-century European
colonial thought. I presume that
the lIR article did not have this
much of an ethnocentric frame of
reference.
"2. In many of these countries
there is a lack of adequately train
ed administrators . . . we may
hope in ihe near future (perhaps
w.hen those people currently being
trained . . .) it will be solved."
This point needs, I think, a
straight question: do these friends
know the history and the problem
of administration in these coun
tries? I would recommend the
"Gattenby's Report" on Indian ad
ministration problems. The seri
ous barrier to economic develop
ment is not in sufficiently trained
administrator's (trained in the
West) but not sufficcntly Indian
ized adminislralors.
"3. That nationalism hampers
'interethnie' cooperation . . ."
Nationalism and "inlerethnic"
cooperation" (incidentally, the
term means very little in view of
llie modern trends of thinking on
internalional affair's) are concen
tric concepts and are not mutually
exclusive of each other. Besides,
the example (Pakistan) cited is
an expression of inadequate ap
praisal of Ihe story of Ihe birth
I of Pakistan. . . .

However inebriated I may have

I am certain that I have not

read Mr. O'Shea's article "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. 6).
Mi 1 . O'Shea says thai Afro-
Asian awakening and nationalism
mean declining of the "Western
variety of the animal." If the im
portance and power of the West
depends on bearing down on Af
rica and Asia; if the West can
maintain its strength only at the
expense of Afro-Asian self-respect
only on Afro-Asian submissive
ncss then what Mr. O'Shea is
afraid of is inevitable. And Mi - .
O'Shea may he right.
This, however, does not threat
en UN internationalism unless, of
course, the existence and success
of the UN depends on it. Wc hope
it. does not.
But Mr. O'Shea goes further:
to cover up the real cause of his
fear - , he resorts to outright insult,
fie calls our rulers immature and

incompetent. This wc resent.
Incidentally, Jane Rut lodge in
her letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 10) puts an amusing twist
to the issue. She writes: ". . . to
degrade African government is to
degrade the British administra
tion and the English educational
system in Africa."
Maybe we are illiterate, imma
ture, and our culture still of the
Stone Age type. But you know,
Mr. O'Shea, if you keep telling us
of our weak points we might feel
insulted.
You claim that from a practical
point of view the rise of newly
independent states is not desira
ble. "From whose practical point
of view?" I ask.
I hardly think that as an Amer
ican you believe that the Decla
ration of Independence was the
wrong move. But the United
States and Great Britain are on
good terms now. Has this threat
ened UN internationalism?

Comment on I liree Points
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 14
contains a letter from Messrs.
Ptoudfool and Willemsen regard
ing the lIR article written by Les
ter O'Shea. I am tempted to com
menl on Ihe three points in their
letter.
"1. The rise of Afro-Asian na
tionalism endangers ihe 'interests'
of Ihe United States. Though a
foreign citizen may say, 'So
what ?', it is a serious point to an
American."
This statement assumes that
Ihe U.S. political and commercial
interests are equivalent to inter
national "well-being." The logic
smacks of 19th-century European
colonial thought. I presume that
the lIR article did not have this
much of an ethnocentric frame of
reference.
"2. In many of these countries
there is a lack of adequately train
ed administrators . . . we may
hope in ihe near future (perhaps
w.hen those people currently being
trained . . .) it will be solved."
This point needs, I think, a
straight question: do these friends
know the history and the problem
of administration in these coun
tries? I would recommend the
"Gattenby's Report" on Indian ad
ministration problems. The seri
ous barrier to economic develop
ment is not in sufficiently trained
administrator's (trained in the
West) but not sufficcntly Indian
ized adminislralors.
"3. That nationalism hampers
'interethnie' cooperation . . ."
Nationalism and "inlerethnic"
cooperation" (incidentally, the
term means very little in view of
llie modern trends of thinking on
internalional affair's) are concen
tric concepts and are not mutually
exclusive of each other. Besides,
the example (Pakistan) cited is
an expression of inadequate ap
praisal of Ihe story of Ihe birth
I of Pakistan. . . .

Editor, The Daily:
However inebriated I may have

remember quite distinctly that I
was not al the now infamous Los
Alios fraternity affair.
I am certain that I have not
recently adorned any officers of
the law with alcoholic beverages,
and thai 1 have not thrown a
cherry bomb into Ihe midst of a
crowded room in at least two
weeks. (However, as to the for
mer action, I must confess that I

Your report of the incident stat
ed that approximately 300 Stan
ford students were involved. I
think you would agree that, even
if we were to assume that all of
them were officer-assaulting, cher
ry-bomb - throwing brigands, the
percentage (300 out of 8,000) is
.still respectably small.
In \ iew of the preceding, I some
how fail to see Ihe basis of your
call to arms in the editorial of
Wednesday, Feb. 11. Upon read
ing it, I was alarmed to discover
that "Stanford has failed." The
following line promised irta proper
retribution for my existence:
thing-s are going to be changed, it
thundered, so as to make certain
I become "the type of individual
desired."
In truth, had 1 known such ac
tion was forthcoming, I would
have seen to it that I, for one, de
served it. It strikes me rather un
just to punish a man without al
lowing him the luxury of break
ing the law.
All of this is not by way of dis
illusioning you. It is simply a
polite way of stating flatly thai I
do not want to become "the type
of individual desired" - whatever
that may be. If my only distinc
tion as a young man is that of
being "undesirable," I shoul d
thank you not to take il away.
Resides, unbeknownst to those

for my future. 1 have grown a pot

Indeed, I should like lo fit, to be

compels me to admit that I am
not.
I do not believe that Stanford
has failed; I do not believe that I
have failed. Moreover, 1 do not
think that those drunken and sen
sual fraternities, which you do
happily damn, have failed.
Take il for a rule: anyone who
wants to shout, who is expected
to shout, will succeed in finding
something lo shout about. Since
such shouting is intended not to
help or lo construct, but to gain
attention and to destroy, you
might at least be so kind as to
keep it vague and/or harmless.
This spring Ihe University Cho

Defense Not Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Now that it's established that
Mr. O'Shea is not responsible for
the headline given his "political
analysis" in last Friday's Daily
(Feb. 6), perhaps he no longer
needs any defense against most of
the criticisms printed so far, most
of which arc based on the article's
failure to support that headline.
Still, perhaps a few soothing
words might find something to
soothe.
I think the best defense for Mr.
O'Shea's article is that it doesn't
actually say very much.
Surely his principal point that
there is considerable Afro-Asian
nationalism, and that this phe
nomenon is less than optimum for
the well-being of the West is a
fact not denied by East, West, or 1
any tertium quid. He never does
say the phenomenon is therefore
to lie condemned, clear though il
may be that lie would like to.
What seems to be most objec
tionable in t he article is the asser
tion that "there is at present a
general absence of trained natives
able to provide intelligent, mature
administration."
This may indeed lie a nasty
thing to say about the new Afro-
A-sian nations, but does it really
mean anything? The same remark
could well be applied to the United
States. It all depends on one's
idea of what constitutes "intelli
gent, mature administration"
and Mr. O'Shea is merely apply
ing HIS idea. To quarrel with il,
I think, is to take it more serious
ly than it deserves.
I join with the critics in regret
ling thai the article was published
as an "lIR political analysis" and
with a misleading headline. With
out these, perhaps we could call
it a political lyric and enjoy it.

I lie JNi<;!it in Question
Editor, The Daily:
However inebriated I may have

remember quite distinctly that I
was not al the now infamous Los
Alios fraternity affair.
I am certain that I have not
recently adorned any officers of
the law with alcoholic beverages,
and thai 1 have not thrown a
cherry bomb into Ihe midst of a
crowded room in at least two
weeks. (However, as to the for
mer action, I must confess that I
woujd quite happily emulate it,
should the opportunity present it
self.)
Your report of the incident stat
ed that approximately 300 Stan
ford students were involved. I
think you would agree that, even
if we were to assume that all of
them were officer-assaulting, cher
ry-bomb - throwing brigands, the
percentage (300 out of 8,000) is
.still respectably small.
In \ iew of the preceding, I some
how fail to see Ihe basis of your
call to arms in the editorial of
Wednesday, Feb. 11. Upon read
ing it, I was alarmed to discover
that "Stanford has failed." The
following line promised irta proper
retribution for my existence:
thing-s are going to be changed, it
thundered, so as to make certain
I become "the type of individual
desired."
In truth, had 1 known such ac
tion was forthcoming, I would
have seen to it that I, for one, de
served it. It strikes me rather un
just to punish a man without al
lowing him the luxury of break
ing the law.
All of this is not by way of dis
illusioning you. It is simply a
polite way of stating flatly thai I
do not want to become "the type
of individual desired" - whatever
that may be. If my only distinc
tion as a young man is that of
being "undesirable," I shoul d
thank you not to take il away.
Resides, unbeknownst to those
who have planned so assiduously
for my future. 1 have grown a pot
belly and, sadly enough, will not,
fit into the prefabricated tuxedo.
Indeed, I should like lo fit, to be
oi I lie right shape and opinion
would that 1 were! But candor
compels me to admit that I am
not.
I do not believe that Stanford
has failed; I do not believe that I
have failed. Moreover, 1 do not
think that those drunken and sen
sual fraternities, which you do
happily damn, have failed.
Take il for a rule: anyone who
wants to shout, who is expected
to shout, will succeed in finding
something lo shout about. Since
such shouting is intended not to
help or lo construct, but to gain
attention and to destroy, you
might at least be so kind as to
keep it vague and/or harmless.
This spring Ihe University Cho

that the audience will not, despite

Defense Not Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Now that it's established that
Mr. O'Shea is not responsible for
the headline given his "political
analysis" in last Friday's Daily
(Feb. 6), perhaps he no longer
needs any defense against most of
the criticisms printed so far, most
of which arc based on the article's
failure to support that headline.
Still, perhaps a few soothing
words might find something to
soothe.
I think the best defense for Mr.
O'Shea's article is that it doesn't
actually say very much.
Surely his principal point that
there is considerable Afro-Asian
nationalism, and that this phe
nomenon is less than optimum for
the well-being of the West is a
fact not denied by East, West, or 1
any tertium quid. He never does
say the phenomenon is therefore
to lie condemned, clear though il
may be that lie would like to.
What seems to be most objec
tionable in t he article is the asser
tion that "there is at present a
general absence of trained natives
able to provide intelligent, mature
administration."
This may indeed lie a nasty
thing to say about the new Afro-
A-sian nations, but does it really
mean anything? The same remark
could well be applied to the United
States. It all depends on one's
idea of what constitutes "intelli
gent, mature administration"
and Mr. O'Shea is merely apply
ing HIS idea. To quarrel with il,
I think, is to take it more serious
ly than it deserves.
I join with the critics in regret
ling thai the article was published
as an "lIR political analysis" and
with a misleading headline. With
out these, perhaps we could call
it a political lyric and enjoy it.

Editor, The Daily:
It, was wilh some grief that 1
read Mr. O'Shea's article "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. 6).
Mi 1 . O'Shea says thai Afro-
Asian awakening and nationalism
mean declining of the "Western
variety of the animal." If the im
portance and power of the West
depends on bearing down on Af
rica and Asia; if the West can
maintain its strength only at the
expense of Afro-Asian self-respect
only on Afro-Asian submissive
ncss then what Mr. O'Shea is
afraid of is inevitable. And Mi - .
O'Shea may he right.
This, however, does not threat
en UN internationalism unless, of
course, the existence and success
of the UN depends on it. Wc hope
it. does not.
But Mr. O'Shea goes further:
to cover up the real cause of his
fear - , he resorts to outright insult,
fie calls our rulers immature and

incompetent. This wc resent.
Incidentally, Jane Rut lodge in
her letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 10) puts an amusing twist
to the issue. She writes: ". . . to
degrade African government is to
degrade the British administra
tion and the English educational
system in Africa."
Maybe we are illiterate, imma
ture, and our culture still of the
Stone Age type. But you know,
Mr. O'Shea, if you keep telling us
of our weak points we might feel
insulted.
You claim that from a practical
point of view the rise of newly
independent states is not desira
ble. "From whose practical point
of view?" I ask.
I hardly think that as an Amer
ican you believe that the Decla
ration of Independence was the
wrong move. But the United
States and Great Britain are on
good terms now. Has this threat
ened UN internationalism?

Comment on I liree Points
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 14
contains a letter from Messrs.
Ptoudfool and Willemsen regard
ing the lIR article written by Les
ter O'Shea. I am tempted to com
menl on Ihe three points in their
letter.
"1. The rise of Afro-Asian na
tionalism endangers ihe 'interests'
of Ihe United States. Though a
foreign citizen may say, 'So
what ?', it is a serious point to an
American."
This statement assumes that
Ihe U.S. political and commercial
interests are equivalent to inter
national "well-being." The logic
smacks of 19th-century European
colonial thought. I presume that
the lIR article did not have this
much of an ethnocentric frame of
reference.
"2. In many of these countries
there is a lack of adequately train
ed administrators . . . we may
hope in ihe near future (perhaps
w.hen those people currently being
trained . . .) it will be solved."
This point needs, I think, a

Defense Not Needed
Editor, The Daily:
Now that it's established that
Mr. O'Shea is not responsible for
the headline given his "political
analysis" in last Friday's Daily
(Feb. 6), perhaps he no longer
needs any defense against most of
the criticisms printed so far, most
of which arc based on the article's
failure to support that headline.
Still, perhaps a few soothing
words might find something to
soothe.
I think the best defense for Mr.
O'Shea's article is that it doesn't
actually say very much.
Surely his principal point that
there is considerable Afro-Asian
nationalism, and that this phe
nomenon is less than optimum for
the well-being of the West is a
fact not denied by East, West, or 1
any tertium quid. He never does
say the phenomenon is therefore
to lie condemned, clear though il
may be that lie would like to.
What seems to be most objec
tionable in t he article is the asser
tion that "there is at present a
general absence of trained natives
able to provide intelligent, mature
administration."
This may indeed lie a nasty
thing to say about the new Afro-
A-sian nations, but does it really
mean anything? The same remark
could well be applied to the United
States. It all depends on one's
idea of what constitutes "intelli
gent, mature administration"
and Mr. O'Shea is merely apply
ing HIS idea. To quarrel with il,
I think, is to take it more serious
ly than it deserves.
I join with the critics in regret
ling thai the article was published
as an "lIR political analysis" and
with a misleading headline. With
out these, perhaps we could call
it a political lyric and enjoy it.

It, was wilh some grief that 1
read Mr. O'Shea's article "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. 6).
Mi 1 . O'Shea says thai Afro-
Asian awakening and nationalism
mean declining of the "Western
variety of the animal." If the im
portance and power of the West
depends on bearing down on Af
rica and Asia; if the West can
maintain its strength only at the
expense of Afro-Asian self-respect
only on Afro-Asian submissive
ncss then what Mr. O'Shea is
afraid of is inevitable. And Mi - .
O'Shea may he right.
This, however, does not threat
en UN internationalism unless, of
course, the existence and success
of the UN depends on it. Wc hope
it. does not.
But Mr. O'Shea goes further:
to cover up the real cause of his
fear - , he resorts to outright insult,
fie calls our rulers immature and

incompetent. This wc resent.
Incidentally, Jane Rut lodge in
her letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 10) puts an amusing twist
to the issue. She writes: ". . . to
degrade African government is to
degrade the British administra
tion and the English educational
system in Africa."
Maybe we are illiterate, imma
ture, and our culture still of the
Stone Age type. But you know,
Mr. O'Shea, if you keep telling us
of our weak points we might feel
insulted.
You claim that from a practical
point of view the rise of newly
independent states is not desira
ble. "From whose practical point
of view?" I ask.
I hardly think that as an Amer
ican you believe that the Decla
ration of Independence was the
wrong move. But the United
States and Great Britain are on
good terms now. Has this threat
ened UN internationalism?

Comment on I liree Points
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 14
contains a letter from Messrs.
Ptoudfool and Willemsen regard
ing the lIR article written by Les
ter O'Shea. I am tempted to com
menl on Ihe three points in their
letter.
"1. The rise of Afro-Asian na
tionalism endangers ihe 'interests'
of Ihe United States. Though a
foreign citizen may say, 'So
what ?', it is a serious point to an
American."
This statement assumes that
Ihe U.S. political and commercial
interests are equivalent to inter
national "well-being." The logic
smacks of 19th-century European
colonial thought. I presume that
the lIR article did not have this
much of an ethnocentric frame of
reference.
"2. In many of these countries
there is a lack of adequately train
ed administrators . . . we may
hope in ihe near future (perhaps
w.hen those people currently being
trained . . .) it will be solved."
This point needs, I think, a
straight question: do these friends
know the history and the problem
of administration in these coun
tries? I would recommend the
"Gattenby's Report" on Indian ad
ministration problems. The seri
ous barrier to economic develop
ment is not in sufficiently trained
administrator's (trained in the
West) but not sufficcntly Indian
ized adminislralors.
"3. That nationalism hampers
'interethnie' cooperation . . ."
Nationalism and "inlerethnic"
cooperation" (incidentally, the
term means very little in view of
llie modern trends of thinking on
internalional affair's) are concen
tric concepts and are not mutually
exclusive of each other. Besides,
the example (Pakistan) cited is
an expression of inadequate ap
praisal of Ihe story of Ihe birth
I of Pakistan. . . .

tionable in t he article is the asser
tion that "there is at present a
general absence of trained natives
able to provide intelligent, mature
administration."
This may indeed lie a nasty
thing to say about the new Afro-
A-sian nations, but does it really
mean anything? The same remark
could well be applied to the United
States. It all depends on one's
idea of what constitutes "intelli
gent, mature administration"
and Mr. O'Shea is merely apply
ing HIS idea. To quarrel with il,
I think, is to take it more serious
ly than it deserves.
I join with the critics in regret
ling thai the article was published
as an "lIR political analysis" and
with a misleading headline. With
out these, perhaps we could call
it a political lyric and enjoy it.

Rulers Imm.iture
Editor, The Daily:
It, was wilh some grief that 1
read Mr. O'Shea's article "Mid-
East Nationalism Threatens Unit
ed Nations Internationalism"
(Daily, Feb. 6).
Mi 1 . O'Shea says thai Afro-
Asian awakening and nationalism
mean declining of the "Western
variety of the animal." If the im
portance and power of the West
depends on bearing down on Af
rica and Asia; if the West can
maintain its strength only at the
expense of Afro-Asian self-respect
only on Afro-Asian submissive
ncss then what Mr. O'Shea is
afraid of is inevitable. And Mi - .
O'Shea may he right.
This, however, does not threat
en UN internationalism unless, of
course, the existence and success
of the UN depends on it. Wc hope
it. does not.
But Mr. O'Shea goes further:
to cover up the real cause of his
fear - , he resorts to outright insult,
fie calls our rulers immature and

incompetent. This wc resent.
Incidentally, Jane Rut lodge in
her letter to the editor (Daily,
Feb. 10) puts an amusing twist
to the issue. She writes: ". . . to
degrade African government is to
degrade the British administra
tion and the English educational
system in Africa."
Maybe we are illiterate, imma
ture, and our culture still of the
Stone Age type. But you know,
Mr. O'Shea, if you keep telling us
of our weak points we might feel
insulted.
You claim that from a practical
point of view the rise of newly
independent states is not desira
ble. "From whose practical point
of view?" I ask.
I hardly think that as an Amer
ican you believe that the Decla
ration of Independence was the
wrong move. But the United
States and Great Britain are on
good terms now. Has this threat
ened UN internationalism?

Comment on I liree Points
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 14
contains a letter from Messrs.
Ptoudfool and Willemsen regard
ing the lIR article written by Les
ter O'Shea. I am tempted to com
menl on Ihe three points in their
letter.
"1. The rise of Afro-Asian na
tionalism endangers ihe 'interests'
of Ihe United States. Though a
foreign citizen may say, 'So
what ?', it is a serious point to an
American."
This statement assumes that
Ihe U.S. political and commercial
interests are equivalent to inter
national "well-being." The logic
smacks of 19th-century European
colonial thought. I presume that
the lIR article did not have this
much of an ethnocentric frame of
reference.
"2. In many of these countries
there is a lack of adequately train
ed administrators . . . we may
hope in ihe near future (perhaps
w.hen those people currently being
trained . . .) it will be solved."
This point needs, I think, a
straight question: do these friends
know the history and the problem
of administration in these coun
tries? I would recommend the
"Gattenby's Report" on Indian ad
ministration problems. The seri
ous barrier to economic develop
ment is not in sufficiently trained
administrator's (trained in the
West) but not sufficcntly Indian
ized adminislralors.
"3. That nationalism hampers
'interethnie' cooperation . . ."
Nationalism and "inlerethnic"
cooperation" (incidentally, the
term means very little in view of
llie modern trends of thinking on
internalional affair's) are concen
tric concepts and are not mutually
exclusive of each other. Besides,
the example (Pakistan) cited is
an expression of inadequate ap
praisal of Ihe story of Ihe birth
I of Pakistan. . . .
