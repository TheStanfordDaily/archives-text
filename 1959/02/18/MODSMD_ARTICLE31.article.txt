## West's Berlin Counterproposals: Disengagement Very Likely 
### Michael Haas 
As Khrushchev's countdown on
Ihe Berlin crisis becomes more
ominous, the lack of counterpro
posals has made the West's course
increasingly tortuous. This is,
however, no cause for despair.
The ascension of the Fulbright
wing of the U.S. Senate's Foreign
Relations Committee, couple d
with the incipient shift of British
public opinion toward Gaitskell's
Labour party, makes it clear that
the West is rapidly gravitating
toward acceptance of some form
of disengagement.
Since the content of foreign pol
icy decisions has more long-run
importance than a wistful look at
the colors of the decision-makers'
flags or skins, a re-evaluation of
disengagement is needed.
In the spring of 1957 Bulganin
proposed that foreign troops with
draw from a 1,000-mile zone in
central and eastern Europe. The
Rapacki Plan for de-nucleariza
tion of both Germany,s. Poland
and Czechoslovakia followed.
In 1958 Kennan coined the term
"disengagement," which Gailskcll
proceeded to amplify in consider
able detail.
But it is no coincidence that
when the smoke of the negative
Dulles - Acheson blunderbuss had
â€¢settled, the West found itself con
fronted in Berlin by Ihe very di
lemma that Kennan had foreseen.
For this reason a summary of the
Gaitskell Plan is in order:
1. Withdrawal of foreign troops
from both Germanys, Hungary,
Poland, and Czechoslovakia.
2. Comprehensive international
control over the remaining na
tional contingents.
3. German reunification, with
free elections.
4. A security pact guaranteeing
the territorial integrity of the
four countries, signed by those in
volved plus the Big Four.
5. Germany leaves NATO; the
satellites leave the Warsaw Pad.
As the status quo becomes more
and more difficult to preserve,
"disengagement" has been urged,
not as a panacea but as a settle
ment which takes into account the
realities of the world situation.
What are these realities? First

of all, it has been a long lime
since the West has given Russia
an opportunity to display any dip
lomatic intransigence.
Public opinion outside the U.S.,
in fact, has demanded reduction
of conventional forces in NATO,
regarding our policy of "graduat
ed deterrence" as a step on an un
certain escalator ending in total
war. Satellite unrest, the most
likely cause of European war, sim
ply cannot now be deterred.
Germany, meanwhile, will have
12 army divisions by about 1961,
compared to the Americans' five.
Whether we disengage or not,
German forces will be more im
portant than NATO.
That Russia would agree to dis
engagement and keep the agree
ment is also likely. Economical
ly. the satellites are a burden to

her. The Bulganin proposal, not j
unlike disengagement, was reiter-|
a ted by Mikoyan on his recent i
American visit. And Russia ac
cepted an Indochina settlement
less favorable to her than she i
would have had if she had accept-j
ed the Geneva Conference deci
sions.
The West cannot expect to see i
the Soviets departing from east-j
ern Europe unless it plans to!
make concessions itself.
Since disengagement maintains!
the relative balance of security in
Europe, the reunification of Ger
many, the liberation of three sat
ellites from their chains and the
consequent reduction in tensions
are certainly desirable by-prod
ucts. It is for peace and democ
racy, after all, that we are fight
ing.
