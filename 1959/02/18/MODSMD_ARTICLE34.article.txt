# New Medical Center to Have 'University-Oriented" Focus
## 
### Bob Montgomery 
When I he Stanford School Â»>l
Medicine moves to its new cam
pus location next September, ii
will mark the first time since ils
creation in 1908 that the school
has actually been a part of, rathei
than apart from, the University.
"This is not the moving of the
old school to the campus," says
Robert Alway, dean of the School
of Medicine; "it is the establish
ment of an entirely new school as
an integral part of the Stanford
family."
The move will bring about a
distinct change in the character of
the medical (school. Since its ac
ceptance as a part of the Univer
sity, the school has been essen
tially hospital-oriented. Now tho
focus will be on a university-ori
ented medical school in which the
faculty will be increasingly con
cerned with the search for knowl
edge rather than its technical ap
plication.
The new Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital, which will have a 440-
hed capacity, will be completed in

early 1959. This, along with the
medical school facilities, will form
a $17 million center which can
handle 100,(too outpatient visits a
year.
By moving to the Palo Alto cam
pus the medical school will gain
the advantage of working with
many wilier departments of the
University. An example of this is
the new biophysics laboratory,
which will be jointly used by the
Biology, Chemistry, Physics and
Electrical Engineering depart
ments as well as the School of
Medicine.
In t he School of Humanities and
Sciences a new program is being
formulated to include the Depart
ment of Sociology and the School
of Medicine. This will provide a
different orientation toward medi
cine for future doctors, increasing
consideration of the human ele
ment.
Coincident with the moving of
the physical facilities will be a
radical revamping of the curricu
lum.
"Unpruned Orchard"
"In the past the medical school
curriculum has been like an un
pruned orchard," notes Dean Al
way. "We have pruned this ram
pant growth of extra courses and
so-calied electives to only the es
sentials. This will leave truly free
lime for the student to pursue
subjects which best further his
own development."
All students admitted in 1959-60
and thereafter will take a five
year medical program rather than
the old four-year curriculum.
However, most of the students
will be admitted to medical school
j after only three years of pre modi
rul work; this will still preserve
t he eight-year total.
During the first two years one
half of the medical student's time
will be devoted to studies in his
major, General Studies courses, or
any other courses which he finds

personally interesting. Normally
the medical student would receive
his A.B. after the third year in
medical school.
The elimination of unnecessary
courses in the curriculum has
made available an entirely free
quarter during the senior year.
During this free period the stu
dent could engage in research
with an interested professor, study
at another college or medical
school, or do clinical work.
Clinical Work
Dr. Alway notes that a student
d oing clinical work for three
months d u r in g medical school
could learn more about a particu
lar specially during this time than
the ordinary person does during
his internship. It would be, in
effect, ;i "junior residency."
I >i.scussing I he quaiificat ions for
a prospective st udenl in the School
of Medicine, Dean Alway explain
ed that the admissions committee
looks for a good scholastic record

balanced vvilli a good extracurric
ular record. They might well ac- |
cept a B student (with good medi- j
cal aptitude) v\ iio had been a var
sity quarterback over an A stu
dent who had no non-scholastic in -
terests.
The Medical College Admissions '
Test, which is similar to the ('id
lege Board familiar to all Stan
lord students, is used as an indi
cator. Top scores on this lest are
usually the best bets for medical
school, and the lower scores are
the poor risks.
Motivations
Molivation is considered also. A
student who had top high school
grades and a good College Board
score, and then coasted along in
college on C'.s, would be consid
ered an unde 1 .' achiever and would
probably be docked by the com
mittee.
The trend of medical admissions
committees today is away from
the science majors which domi
nated the picture in the past. In
fact, says Dr. Alway, a survey at
Harvard Medical School showed
that the students who had liberal
arts or behavior science majors in
college had an edge over those
who had followed science major's
as undergraduates.
Students with varied back
grounds are found in the medical
schools of today. Alway points
out the fact that engineers, law
students and theology major's oft
en end iq) in medical school.
Requirements
The admissions requirements
for acceptance to Stanford's medi
cal school have been modified in
accordance with the new three
five-year setup. The only under
graduate courses required of ap
plicants are quarter units of
chemistry, 1!> quarter units of bi
ology and 12 quarter units of
physics.
"Two types of people usually go
into medicine," explained Dean
Alway. "The first type is the fel
low who has always liked animals
and living things. lie probably
had pet mice, rats and snakes, and
preferred to walk in the woods
rather than play baseball.
"The -second type is the gregari
ous fellow who just can't, get
I enough of people. This trait ac
counts for tire number of law, psy
chology and theology students
who sometimes end up in medi
cine. The quality is common to
all these professions."
