# TO THE RESCUE
## Corp Yard—University's We-Fix-Everything Men 
### Ceci Wittmann 
The Corporation Yard: Stan
ford's janitorial service, chuck
hole • filling company, gardeners,
impair and maintenance depart
ment, and -steam heaters.
Noi only does il double-deck
classrooms, and answer frantic
calls when the electricity goes oft
the night before a Civ midterm,
but it is also the proud possessor
of a new steam plant.
One of the many enterprises
run by the "Corp" Yard, this new
plant, a troublemaker for tech
nical reasons, has been causing
more than a little trouble as
shown by the plethora of pits dug
at crucial intersections.
Steam will continue to boil up
from manholes, and the depart
ment will continue to dig up the
streets in a not-very-successful at
tempt to find the leaks accord
ing to Corp Yard superintendent
C. L. Blacker.
In spite of the extra mainten
ance the new plant demands, it

has distinct advantages, First, it
runs 21 hours .1 day, whereas the
old one did not. Second, it is iso
lated from other buildings.
Gardeners are a common sight
around campus, and gardening
and grounds maintenance are
highly industrialized businesses
at Stanford. Gutters are kept
leaf-free with the street and lawn
vacuum cleaner a truck with an
elephant like attachment th a t
sucks up the debris.
Its counterpart, the brush chew
ing machine, grinds up branches
and spews the sawdust back
around a tree to serve as ferti
lizer. For the bargain of $200,
the Corp Yard is saved the ex

pciise of having to haul truck
loads of brush to a dump heap.
A campus nursery furnishes
the bushes and flowers that are
in front of History Corner and in
the inner Quad circles. This de
partment also furnishes cut flow
ers to l>r. Sterling, on request.
Students may buy surplus plants
and cut flowers Irom the nursery
at a 10 per cent discount.
This fall's Big (lame Bonfire
was fed by ilie Corp Yard's free
wood lot, at the dumping grounds
by the nursery. All scrap lumber
from renovations was taken there
until it was learned that nobody
was taking advantage of it.
Repairs furnish the majority of
work for the Corp Yard, which
services both dorms and class
rooms. Private faculty homes and
fraternity houses can get aid only
in emergencies. A repair man is
sent out to private campus resi
dences immediately to make ini
tial repairs until outside help ar
rives.
Classroom Repairs
Requests for classroom repairs
must be made through the head
of the department. Residence re
quests are made through John M.
Yarborough, the director of resi
dences, who has a handy man oil
call at all times.
There have been many com
plaints about the poor condition
of roads on campus. They are not
due to be improved soon. The
Corp Yard gets only $10,000 an
nually to maintain all roads on
campus. This money must cover
all street repairs, road building
and widening of si reels.
The Corp Yard also has very
specialized work for its employ
ees. One man does nothing but
change liyht bulbs in the dorms
and classrooms. As soon as he
has finished his rounds < it takes
a year), it is time for him to start
all over again.
The Corp Yard does not deal
exclusively in the more prosaic
jobs, such as repair work and gar
dening. Six years ago they dug
up a graveyard.
(.rave Diggers
This graveyard, which was just
inside the Stanford lands, had
been the object of vandalism. In
addition, cows were grazing all
over it. Since it. was obvious the
land would have to be abandoned,
the Corp Yard got court permis
sion to dig up the graves. The
remains of the corpses were
transferred to Holy Cross Church.
