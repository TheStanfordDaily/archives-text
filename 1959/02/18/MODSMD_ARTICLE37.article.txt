Like Football
The object of the rugby game
is much like that in American
football, namely to ground the
ball over the opponents' goal line
and fry to add the extra points
after the score. In addition to
this method of scoring there is
the highly important penalty
kick. Instead of penalizing the
team guilty of the infraction by
making yards off, in rugby the
team is given a penalty kick from
the point of the infraction.
Rugby scoring values are as
follows: try (same as touch
down), 3 points; conversions, 2
points; drop kick (from anywhere
on the field t, 3 points, and the
penalty kick, 3 points.
The one infraction of the rules
that causes the most confusion
on the part of the spectator is
offsides. A player is considered
to be offsides if he is ahead of his
teammate who has the ball. How
ever. this is not a penalty unless
the player who is offsides at
tempts to enter into the play.
Two Main Differences
The two main differences be
tween rugby are, in rugby, the
ball may never be thrown for
ward; it must always be thrown
in a backward direction. Second
ly, there is no blocking or inter
ference allowed in rugby as there
is in football; this makes it neces
sary for the player who has the
ball to depend on his own elusive
ness to break away.
A rugby match consists of two
'10-minute hall's and no time-outs
may be taken during the course
of the half, except to allow in
jured players to recover.
