# Swimmers Get Set for Two Meets
## 
### 
With only a hare minimum of
1959 experience under their belts,
the Stanford swimmers launch |
into their biggest home weekend
of the season this Friday and Sat
urday afternoon against two
Southland schools. Fullerton
will provide the primer Friday for
the titanic match the following af
ternoon against the University of
Southern California.
Fullerton, the Indians' tradi-j
tional foe for over 30 years,
should provide an interesting
meet, but little actual competi
tion. The Southland JC which an- |
nually boasts one of the top teams |
in the JC circuit is exceedingly i
strong this year in the distance ;
events, an area where Stanford |
lacks substantial power.
Bolstering Fullerton's distance
squad for 1 the coming meet will be
Dennis Brittain who took third in [
CIF 400-yard freestyle last year
and Ken Hamdorf who placed
high in the state 1500-yard free.
The SC varsity is at its strong- j
est ever this year. Most of its tal- :
ent lies in its sophomore class '
that won last year's Senior Men's j
AAU Swimming Championships, i
Included among these sopho-1
mores is Murray Rose, the blond j
vegetarian from Australia, who!
won three gold medals in the 1956
Olympics. He won the 400- and ;
500 - meter freestyle and was a
member of the 800-meter Austra- !
lian relay team that set a new
Olympic record. More recent ly
Rose won the 200- and 400-yar d |
and 1500-meter freestyle at the 1
AAU Championship meet last j
year, setting records in each of I
these events, not to mention hold
ing down a leg on the record-set- i
ting 400-yard freestyle relay. He i
was also personal high scorer of j
the meet, scoring almost one-third :
of the total team points.

1959 experience under their belts,
the Stanford swimmers launch |
into their biggest home weekend
of the season this Friday and Sat
urday afternoon against two
Southland schools. Fullerton
will provide the primer Friday for
the titanic match the following af
ternoon against the University of
Southern California.
Fullerton, the Indians' tradi-j
tional foe for over 30 years,
should provide an interesting
meet, but little actual competi
tion. The Southland JC which an- |
nually boasts one of the top teams |
in the JC circuit is exceedingly i
strong this year in the distance ;
events, an area where Stanford |
lacks substantial power.
Bolstering Fullerton's distance
squad for 1 the coming meet will be
Dennis Brittain who took third in [
CIF 400-yard freestyle last year
and Ken Hamdorf who placed
high in the state 1500-yard free.
The SC varsity is at its strong- j
est ever this year. Most of its tal- :
ent lies in its sophomore class '
that won last year's Senior Men's j
AAU Swimming Championships, i
Included among these sopho-1
mores is Murray Rose, the blond j
vegetarian from Australia, who!
won three gold medals in the 1956
Olympics. He won the 400- and ;
500 - meter freestyle and was a
member of the 800-meter Austra- !
lian relay team that set a new
Olympic record. More recent ly
Rose won the 200- and 400-yar d |
and 1500-meter freestyle at the 1
AAU Championship meet last j
year, setting records in each of I
these events, not to mention hold
ing down a leg on the record-set- i
ting 400-yard freestyle relay. He i
was also personal high scorer of j
the meet, scoring almost one-third :
of the total team points.
