# Plans for New Radio Station Under Study by Administration
## Two Proposals Differ On Organization, Purposes 
### 
Two plans for reactivating the student radio station have been sub
mitted to the administration for approval.
One proposal was prepared by the Speech and Drama Department.
The other was submitted by a student group which calls itself "The
Committee for Better Stanford Radio."
Both proposals call for the construction of a new educational [re-

quency modulation s t a I ion to
serve the entire Peninsula area,
and for the return to the air of
an improved carrier current sys
tem for broadcasting to student
residences.
Both claim to represent ideas
developed in student-faculty study
groups which met during the au
tumn quarter.
The Speech and Drama Depart
ment proposal suggests that an
engineer and a secretary be hired
on a full-time basis. The secre
tary would also serve the radio
and television faculty of the
Speech'and Drama Department, in
addition to her duties at the radio
station.
Paid Director
A director, selected from the ra
dio and television staff, would su
pervise the operations of the sta
tion. He would receive an annual
salary of ;$5OO.
The director and the engineer
would not run the station in such
a manner that no responsibility
would be left to the student offi
cers, Instructor John Witherspoon
of the Speech and Drama Depart
ment said.
"They will have just as much
executive authority as their coun
terparts in a commercial opera
tion would have. The student ex
ecutives on the station must have
the power that goes along with
their responsibility," he said.
University ( ontrol
The University must retain
"some control" over the person
ality the station would project to
off-campus listeners. This would
be the job of the faculty director.
The engineer would be necessary
to maintain a continuing supervi
sion for maintenance of technical
equipment, Witherspoon said.
The proposal of the Committee
for Better Stanford Radio disa
grees in principle with this view
point. This group believes that
students can do the engineering
and secretarial work.

"The Speech and Drama pro
posal would actually cost the Uni
versity several thousand dollars
more per year than ours," Gordon
MacGinitie, c hail' m a n of the
group, said.
Projected cost of construction
and first-year operation is $16,928
in the student proposal and $15,*
028 in the Speech and Drama De
partment plan. The second figure
docs not include the salary for the
full-time engineer which would be
$5000 or over, Witherspoon said.
I'< '< Ruling
KZSU was closed by the fed
eral Communications Commission
and the University administration
last summer, because the station
was broadcasting outside tho cam
pus in violation of FCC rules.
At that time the FCC suggested
that the University consider es
tablishing an educational FM sta
tion.
Roth plans for the new station
will be considered by the Radio
and Television Committee of the
University. The Committee will
then make a recommendation to
the administration.

versity several thousand dollars
more per year than ours," Gordon
MacGinitie, c hail' m a n of the
group, said.
Projected cost of construction
and first-year operation is $16,928
in the student proposal and $15,*

$5000 or over, Witherspoon said.
I'< '< Ruling
KZSU was closed by the fed
eral Communications Commission
and the University administration
last summer, because the station
was broadcasting outside tho cam
pus in violation of FCC rules.
At that time the FCC suggested
that the University consider es
tablishing an educational FM sta
tion.
Roth plans for the new station
will be considered by the Radio
and Television Committee of the
University. The Committee will
then make a recommendation to
the administration.
Two plans for reactivating the student radio station have been sub
mitted to the administration for approval.
One proposal was prepared by the Speech and Drama Department.
The other was submitted by a student group which calls itself "The
Committee for Better Stanford Radio."
Both proposals call for the construction of a new educational [re-

quency modulation s t a I ion to
serve the entire Peninsula area,
and for the return to the air of
an improved carrier current sys
tem for broadcasting to student
residences.
Both claim to represent ideas
developed in student-faculty study
groups which met during the au
tumn quarter.
The Speech and Drama Depart
ment proposal suggests that an
engineer and a secretary be hired
on a full-time basis. The secre
tary would also serve the radio
and television faculty of the
Speech'and Drama Department, in
addition to her duties at the radio
station.
Paid Director
A director, selected from the ra
dio and television staff, would su
pervise the operations of the sta
tion. He would receive an annual
salary of ;$5OO.
The director and the engineer
would not run the station in such
a manner that no responsibility
would be left to the student offi
cers, Instructor John Witherspoon
of the Speech and Drama Depart
ment said.
"They will have just as much
executive authority as their coun
terparts in a commercial opera
tion would have. The student ex
ecutives on the station must have
the power that goes along with
their responsibility," he said.
University ( ontrol
The University must retain
"some control" over the person
ality the station would project to
off-campus listeners. This would
be the job of the faculty director.
The engineer would be necessary
to maintain a continuing supervi
sion for maintenance of technical
equipment, Witherspoon said.
The proposal of the Committee
for Better Stanford Radio disa
grees in principle with this view
point. This group believes that
students can do the engineering
and secretarial work.
