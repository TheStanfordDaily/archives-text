# No Contract Rule
## 
### 
In Askim. Rl PMAI. of the freshman fraternity eating club no-contact
rule, we would l>c ignoring practical aspects of the situation were
we not to examine how such repeal would a (feet rushing.
II liile recommending abolishment of the no-contact
itih \ however, lie nl the same time strongly ask retention
of n no-(.()N'l HA(.I rule I hut is. no pledging of fresh
men before formal rush with Often houses spring tpuirter.
The following, we believe, would he some results of such a
system:
• freshmen would have more opportunity lo see potential
new lis ing groups before pledging and. more important, would be
able to see them more nearly as they normally exist. Ihe present
open house and rush party system permit Ireslimen lo see houses
or clubs only in their most favorable light.
Hut with freedom of contact, freshmen would be far more
likely to see houses or clubs and their members as they really are
and these groups, in turn, could gel a better idea of just what a
particular freshman is like.
* I here might be more instances of u under-the-table
pledging than at present but few can be naive enough
to thiol, there is tune no pre-rush pledging because of the
no-contact mle. I nde.r our proposed system, even if a
freshman had a bul hi his pocl.et in mid-(blotter, he still
could n i si fin until April.
During this period he would be free to visit tlie house or club,
get a better idea of just what it's like, and could change his mind
before signing time if he decided his first impressions were false.
Thus, the insecure freshman who insists on taking a bid before
the legallv-recognized time is al least given a degree of protection
"under the proposed svstem which he does not have at the present
time.
e Pressure on the indiridual freshman irould not be
so concentrated, nor nrmbl he fin e rushing in the an i d
fashion characteristic of many under tin• present system.
Some will sa\ that without a no-contact rule, freshmen wi II he
rushed extensively before they have a chance lo gel settled at
Stanford. Hut we think thai strict enforcement of the '"no pledge
until spring ride, combined with a degree of common sense which
we can legitimately expect even from entering freshmen, will pre
vent t hem 112 roii ide vol ing .ill I heir lime lo gaining a spot on the How.
freshmen will also be better able In take part in rushing ac
tivities when lliev have the lime. I nder the present system, il
open houses fall the das before papers and mid-terms, the fresh
man either goes or gels left.
I he present system also bates two iptarters for false
impressions about <lub or fraternity life to build up in
freshmen. Il\ allowing litem lo see il from the time they
m nre at Stanford the freshmen nill be bitter prepared

ne \ I iliree years, instead of being forced, as many feel
tliey me, into mailing a pressured and hurried choice

\\ edo not say ibis plan is perfeel but we do sn\ llial il is the
most realistic way to handle a diflicull problem. Any weaknesses
it may have can be overcome hv mere common sense and common
sense cannot overcome weaknesses of the present no-contact rule.
\\ e ask, then, thai the uo-contaci rule be abolished in as quick
and orderly a fashion as possible.
