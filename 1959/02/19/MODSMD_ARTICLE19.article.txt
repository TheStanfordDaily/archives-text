II was a big relief to find thai I
Stanford's tuition and hoard pay-!
men is may be going down next !
year. The Daily hasn't heard any-1
thing about it, but it seems lh;i! a j
high school paper in Austin has |
scooped us on ii.
In a comparison between 13 col 1
leges and universities, one ol the
categories was approximate cost
per year, or the cost of tuition
atul board and room.
Stanford's was listed as $7/50
for tuition and $100 for hoard
and roOlii. Why doesn't some
body tell ns about these things?
Al Penn Stale, students in a
psych section are gradually real
izing that man is coming under
the influence of machine name
ly, a machine called MARI.
MAKI (Motivation and Re
sponse Indicator) permits the in
structor to ask true and false
questions of about 30 students, to
which they respond simultaneous
ly by pushing buttons on boxes lo
cated on their desks.
A dial tells the instructor what
percentage of the class got the
answer right, and a counter tells
each student what his score is.
Theoretically, this is designed to
tell the instructor whether or not J
he is getting the material across
to the class.
Kut wouldn't this he :t unique
way of taking finals?

The Daily has found that it is
not the only paper to claim to be
a location's "Only Morning News
paper." It seems that the Cornell
Daily Sun is now using the same
idea: "Ithaca's Only Morning
Newspaper" runs gaily under its
flag.
In Britain, it seems lhat some- 1

body discovered a diamond field
and everybody in ihe area was
preparing himself for a mad rush
for the glittery little gems.
A geology professor made Ihe
announcement, and newspapers
blazed ihe story across the coun
try within hours. The professor,

Percival Allen, was whisked be
fore TV cameras to tell of the
find.
But it seems that the whole
thing was a hoax, dreamed up as
a publicity stunt to help a char
ity drive. Students had come to
Professor Allen, asking him to
co-operate in organizing a stunt,
and Allen and two of his cohort
decided to use a few of the indus
trial sapphires from the univer
sity's collect ion.
"A bit of harmless fun,"
chuckled Professor Allen.
