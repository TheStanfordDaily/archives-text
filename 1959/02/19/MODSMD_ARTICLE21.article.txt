# FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
## Legislature Asked for Money To Finance Booklet Publication 
### Barbara Dicks 
The Fundamental Standard and I
Honor Code Commission has twice '
come before the Legislature to ask j
for an appropriation of $2(50 to
print copies of a new booklet con '
cerning the Standard to bo dis
tributed to freshmen.
The first time the booklet was
turned down flat. The second re
quest was tabled, and will be;
brought before the Legislature to
night.
The commission reappeared be
fore the Legislature after the first 1
of a series of discussions on the
Standard was held with the frosh.
i
Members said the freshmen's
questions showed how much back 1
ground information on the details |
of the Standard is needed, and
they said tin 1 new booklet would
clear up these questions and open
the way for discussion on the real
meaning of the Standard.
Freshman representatives last |
week told the Legislature that the
frosh would not bother to read
the booklet, and that they feared
the presentation would harm
chances for a valuable discussion.
From the freshman reports of
the discussions held thus far in
the dorms, indications are that
the Fundamental Standard, as
such, is not highly regarded. This
writer would like to think that
this is because ihe majority of
Stanford students have been rais
ed with the ideals implicit in the!
Standard as a minimum code of I
conduct, and feel it is useless to
reiterate them.
If we can be sure this is the
case, the booklet is not worth the
$260 expense. If it is not the case,
this writer feels that, regardless
of the mode of presentation, a new
booklet at this point will not con
tribute to the realization of the
Standard.
Some in the University arc sin
cerely concerned over the appar
ent absence of an awareness of
the Fundamental Standard. Some
will go .so far as to say it does not
exist, and that it is hypocritical
to talk about such things as the
booklet when something deeper is
involved.
What is even more disturbing
is to hear the proponents of the
booklet admit thai they who
probably have thought more about
the Standard than most do not
fully understand what is meant
when one speaks of "the Funda
mental Standard."
It is they who are trying to elab
orate on the Standard in print,
when they have difficulty in (lis
cussing vocally its implications;

and the Fundamental Standard
lends itself to detailed discussion
or scholarly essays hotter than to
a factual pamphlet.
The members of the commis
sion try to 101 l us that if the book
let is not distributed to this year's
class, the class will be lost so far
as any future awareness of the
Standard is concerned. Hut this is
to say that freshmen will have no
sense of its values unless tlvoy
have this booklet in their hands.
The work of the commission is
to be applauded, but this writer
would urge them to direct their
efforts to formulating ideas to
present to the ('lass of '63 next
fall, who will be more inclined to
discuss the ideas. Booklets fol
lowed closely by Ihoughtlul dis
cussion throughout Ihe develop-

I meat of next year's freshmen
should yield benefits.
To present booklets at this point
to this year's freshmen, who have
indicated they don't care about it,
will be futile, in this writer's view.
They have been accused of be
ing smug and in other ways not
contributing to the University at
mosphere. This writer does not
; believe the fundamental Stand
ard, as such, is lost to them, but
that $2(io worth of booklets pro
i c 1 a i m in g the existence ol tin*
I Standard will be.
