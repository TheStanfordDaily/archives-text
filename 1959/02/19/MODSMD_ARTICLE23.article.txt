Ivditor, The Daily:
In his review of the Quartet to
Italiano's performance of Satur
day evening, your music critic has
given a final demonstration of his
inability to appreciate music
much less write about it.
The Quartetto Ilaliano is an in
ternationally-acclaimed group, and
its Dinkelspiel appearance was an
exposition of str ing quartet play
ing at its finest. Their* interpre
tion and playing were of high
caliber; the Ravel, especially, was
almost beyond belief.
And how did your reviewer find
the Quartetto? ". . . blunt effect
. . . irregular . . . unable 1o evoke
the lyric themes." This is not
thoughtful, considered criticism,
but irresponsible, snap-judgment
condemnation of some excellent
playing.
To conceal his musical gauche
rie, the reviewer tosses around
some musical - sounding phrases

designed to subdue I lie uniniti
ated. What, for instance, does he
mean by saying that . . its diffi
cult harmonies proved an inter
esting experience in sonority val
ues"?
He says of the Ravel Quartet in
F Major that it "could . . . have
saved the program." When a pro
gram evokes a total of eight cur
tain calls and an encore, it doesn't
need saving.
Responsible enough in other de
partments, The Daily could at
least have its music reviews writ
ten by a music major, who would
understand the difference between
being a music critic and criticizing
music.
