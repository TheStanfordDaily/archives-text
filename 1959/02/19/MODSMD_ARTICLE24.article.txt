# THE 						Finish Line

### Dick Barnes 
Track ami Field —Off llie Field
Something different iti track and field will be offered Northern
California coaches, athletes and fans here Saturday when Payton
Jordan presents his second annual February Truck and Field Clinic.
The morning-long program in Cnbhcrley Auditorium open to the
public will feature dhree panel discussions and motion pictures ol
the United States-ltiissia dual meet held last summer. Jordan was
the coach of that American national team, which also performed
behind the Iron Curtain in Hungary and I'oland.
The half-hour to 15 minute discussions cover a wide range of top
ics from sports writer coach relationships in track and field to the
place of women iti the sport, and on through feelings of the athletes
themselves. Jordan has assembled excellent panels for what give
promise of being both stimulating and interesting discussions.
following the K:.'io film showing, three writers and three coaches
will discuss "The Fourth Fstale and Coaching in Track and Field."
Bert Nelson, editor of Track and Field News, is known for the
excellent job his publication has done in both promoting track and
field at all levels, and in providing a meet-to meet history. The sta
tistics and summaries compiled by Nelson and his world-wide staff
iif track authorities have proven to be a great stimulus to the sport
and a boon for "track nuts" (like myself).
.Joining with Nelson on the writers' side will be Walt damage,
sports editor of the Palo Alto Times, and Dink Tenipleton, former
Stanford coach, columnist for the Palo Alto Times, and sports com
mentator on KFK('.
Representing the coaches will be Forres! Janiieson, Brayton Nor
ton and «lim Tcrrill, Jamicson is probably the best high school dis
tance coach in the nation. Ilis Palo Alio High School runners have,
in recent years, continually ranked with the best in the United Slates
and Paly has produced more good distance men than any other high
school.
Norton, head coach at Tennyson High in Hayward, is current
world record holder in the pentathlon and four-time national cham
pion in the event. Terrill, of course, is no stranger to Stanford he's
Jordan's assistant and coach of the Papoose team.
The middle panel, "Women in the Sport of Track and Field, Na
tionally and Internationally," will be handled by Mrs. Roxanne An
derson, manager of the '50 women's Olympic team, and Pamela Kii
iv 11 of San Francisco, one of the nation's best female discuss throw
ers.
The Athletes Have a Say, Too
The final panel, "The Athletes Speak Up," may turn out to be
quite revealing. Chuck Cobb, llerlil l.undh, Jerry Winters and Keilli
Wallace will participate, with Nelson as moderator.
Cobb, last year's Stanford captain and holder of the school high
hurdles record at 13.9, is now in the U.S. Navy, but stationed here
to work under Jordan, l.undh, in his first quarter at Stanford but
a sophomore in eligibility, has bests of 1:47.8 for 800 meters and
.'1:41 . 1 for 1500. Winters is a junior shot-putter and a fast-improving
one while Wallace is a sophomore and American .Junior record-hold
er in the two-mile at 9:11.8.
After the morning session and a lunch break, the program will
move to Angell Field at 1:30 for Stanford's Winter Track and Field
( hampionships.
With a quarter and a half of work under their belts, most of the
Indian varsity and frosh squads are rounding into fairly good shape.
.Just how good will be seen Sat unlay. Jordan says this meet will bo
a primary »> see who makes the team for the season-opener in
March. —«•'
Many of last year's lop point-winners are back, with Cobb Ihe
prime exception. The 1959 club looks particularly strong in the
.dances. Saturday's distance line-up will highlight Norman Uoyd
.id l.imdli in the mile, lOrnie ( unlitfe, Dick Lassen and freshman
l.vaiif;elos Depaslas in the half, Uoyd in the 440, and Keith Wallace,
Bob Moir/.ingo and Doug Martin in the two-mile.
Two notable event changes will be made Dean Smith going in
the low hurdles and Brooks Tovvnsend throwing Ihe javelin. Smith
stuck to the sprints last year, but with the Indians possibly in trouble
in the hurdles this season, he'll be giving the low sticks a try.
Tovvnsend broad-jumped last year, and will continue there again
this season, but has looked good enough in the spear event to give
it a try also.
