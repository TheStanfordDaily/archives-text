# CARDS' SATURDAY FOE
## Poor Bruins In Real Nose Dive DAILY Sports SCENE 
### 
UCLA's Bruins, visitors to the
Pavilion last Friday night and
Card opponents Saturday, have
found out what a difference two
weeks can make.
Three weeks ago, the board
crashing, fast â€¢ breaking IJelans
were riding along in first place
in the Pacific Coast Conference.
Some called them surprising, but,
nevertheless, their 5 2 record top
ped the loop. Two weeks later,
the Bruins had a 50 mark and
are now in a light to get into the
first division.
Tied with Trojans
UCLA and Southern California,
the Cards' hoop opponents this
weekend, are currently in a tie
for fifth and sixth place with the
identical 5-G records. IK'LA went
into a home series with Cal and
Idaho two weeks ago on top of
the heap at 5-2 and came out 5-4.
Last weekend more of the same
was waiting for the Bruins in the
Bay Area as they lost on succes
sive nights to Stanford and Cal.
First place or last, however,
Coach Johnny Wooden still has
the PCC's leading scorer, Walt
Torrence. The 6-3 senior has
pumped through points at the
rate of 20.(i a game in conference
play and over the past month has
moved all the way into the na
tion's top 25.
Bruin hopes would definitely
take a rise if 0-6 sophomore cen
ter Kent Miller could return to
action. Miller missed last week's
game with a sprained ankle.
Oregon lias Chance
Stanford doesn't meet UCLA
until Saturday night, so Oregon
will get the first crack at extend
ing the Soulhlanders' loss streak
in the opener of Friday night's
double-header at the Pan Pacific.
UCLA still tops the PCC in re
bounding, and did manage to beat
the Tribe on the hoards last week.
However, they could not keep up
with the hoi hands of the Tribe's
Dick Ilaga, Paul Neumann and
John Arrillaga in the scoring de
partment. As usual, Stanford won
because superior shooting over
came a backboard weakness.
