# N.W. Schools Plan Outright Athletic Aid
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore. (/!') Four
Northern Division colleges, about
to be freed of the Pacific Coast
Conference's strict bonds, said
Wednesday they will give out
light financial aid to athletes.
There seemed little doubt that
ii would aid recruiting at the four
schools.
The four met here to discuss
the new aid program. Out of that
meeting came talk of forming a
new conference.
Oregon Athletic Director Leo
Harris said his school had ap
proved the program in principle
and will put it into effect next
fall.
No work will be required under
the new program, Harris said.
Rather, outright grants will be
given.
Such grants, he said, will range
from $1000 to $1200 a year for
each athlete.
"This will be a grant allowed
under the NCAA rules," Harris
said. "I think the thing that
prompted it is that many schools
and many leagues have gone to
I his type of thing."
At Moscow, Idaho Athletic Di
rector Bob Gibb said: "Idaho will
go along with the board, room,
tuition and compulsory fees."
At Corvallis, Oregon State Ath
letic Director Roy Keene said:
"We will probably be doing away
with labor programs.
"In some places we will prob
ably be adopting NCAA rules. In
others we will be stricter."
