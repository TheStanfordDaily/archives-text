# Geneticist Will Study Heredity

### 
Nobel Prize winner Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, head of the Medical
School's new department of ge
netics, has announced that the de
partment will investigate basic
differences between the sexes and
changes in cellular heredity.
He explained in a press confer
ence that his personal project is a
study of the way in which sexual
ity is determined in bacteria.
He received the Nobel Prize in
1958 for his work in discovering
the phenomenon of sexual recom
bination.
Sex Is Contagious
In certain bacteria, he said, .sex
is contagious. For example, if a
female cell is introduced into a
colony of male cells, ail the cells
will become female.
He added that this phenomenon
does not work both ways. Female
cells do not become male cells.
He is trying to discover how
male cells differ from female
cells.
Some differences already ob
served are that female cells swim
faster than the males and the fe
males seem to grow faster. Male
cells may have a different carbo
hydrate on the surface which ac
counts for this difference, added
Lederberg.
Basic Investigation
He conducts his experiments
wilh a strain of the bacterium
Escherichia coli. This sort of
basic investigation would be im
posiblc in higher organisms be
cause of the many other factors
which affect the organisms, he
said.
Lederberg said that the main
function of his department would
be in basic science, but that much
of the research can lead to prac
tical clinical application.
Studies of change in cellular
heredity "conceivably have a prac
tical cancer application," he ex
plained. But first a technique for
the genetic study of cancer cells
has to bo developed.
The department's first appoint
ment, Dr. Leonard Herzenberg,
who is now with the National In
stitute of Health, wants to study
cancer of recent origins in a ge
netically controlled situation, he
said.
Lederberg and his wife Esther,
also a well-known scientist, are
working in temporary quarters in
the biophysics laboratory.

Escherichia coli. This sort of
basic investigation would be im
posiblc in higher organisms be
cause of the many other factors
which affect the organisms, he
said.
Lederberg said that the main
function of his department would
be in basic science, but that much
of the research can lead to prac
tical clinical application.
Studies of change in cellular
heredity "conceivably have a prac
tical cancer application," he ex
plained. But first a technique for
the genetic study of cancer cells
has to bo developed.
The department's first appoint
ment, Dr. Leonard Herzenberg,
who is now with the National In
stitute of Health, wants to study
cancer of recent origins in a ge
netically controlled situation, he
said.
Lederberg and his wife Esther,
also a well-known scientist, are
working in temporary quarters in
the biophysics laboratory.
Nobel Prize winner Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, head of the Medical
School's new department of ge
netics, has announced that the de
partment will investigate basic
differences between the sexes and
changes in cellular heredity.
He explained in a press confer
ence that his personal project is a
study of the way in which sexual
ity is determined in bacteria.
He received the Nobel Prize in
1958 for his work in discovering
the phenomenon of sexual recom
bination.
Sex Is Contagious
In certain bacteria, he said, .sex
is contagious. For example, if a
female cell is introduced into a
colony of male cells, ail the cells
will become female.
He added that this phenomenon
does not work both ways. Female
cells do not become male cells.
He is trying to discover how
male cells differ from female
cells.
Some differences already ob
served are that female cells swim
faster than the males and the fe
males seem to grow faster. Male
cells may have a different carbo
hydrate on the surface which ac
counts for this difference, added
Lederberg.
Basic Investigation
He conducts his experiments
wilh a strain of the bacterium
Escherichia coli. This sort of
basic investigation would be im
posiblc in higher organisms be
cause of the many other factors
which affect the organisms, he
said.
