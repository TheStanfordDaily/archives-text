POVERTY CAN BE FUN
It is no disgrace to he; poor. It is mii error, hut it i- no disgrace.
So if your purse is cuipty, do not skulk ami brood ami hide
your head in shame. Stand tall. Admit your poverty. Admit it
freely and frankly and all kinds of good things will happen to
you. Take, for instance, the ease of Blossom Sigafoos.
Blossom, an impecunious freshman at an Kastern girls'
college, was smart ;is a whip and round as a dumpling. :ind
scarcely :i day went by when she didn't get invited to a party
weekend at one of the nearhy men's schools. Hut Blossom never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she did not have the
clothes. Weekend after weekend, while her classmates went
frolicking, Hlossom sat alone, saved from utter despair only by
her pack of Marlboros, for even an exchequer a- slim as Blos
som's can afford the joys of Marlboro —joys far beyond their
paltry price: rich, mellow tobaccos, lovingly cured and care
fully packed; a new improved filter that works like a charm.
Croesus himself could not buy a better cigarette!
However, Marlboro's most, passionate admirers — among
whose number I am paid to count myself would not claim
that Marlboro can entirely replace love and romance, and Blos
som grew steadily moroser.

Then one day came a phone call from an intelligent sopho
more named Tom O'Shanter at a nearby men's college. "Blos
som," said Torn, "I want you to come down next week for the
barley festival, and I won't take no for an answer."
"No," said Blossom.
"Foolish girl," said Tom gently. "I know why you refuse inc.
It is because you are poor, isn't it?"
"Yes," said Blossom.
"I will send you a railroad ticket," said Tom. "Also a small
salami in case you get hungry on the train."
"But I have nothing to wear," said Blossom.
Tom replied, "I will send you one suit of cashmere, two
gowns of lace, three slacks of velvet, four shoes of calf, five socks
of nylon, and a partridge in a pear tree."
"That is most kind," said Blossom, "but I fear I cannot
dance and enjoy myself while back home my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed."
"Send him to Mayo Brothers and put it on my tab," said
Tom.
"You are terribly decent," said Blossom, "but I cannot come
to your party because all the other girls at the party will be
from rich, distinguished families, and my father is but a humble
woodcutter."
"I will buy him Yo-emite," said I'oni.
"You have a great heart," said 810-som. "Hold the phone
while I ask onr wise and kindly old Dean of Women whether it
i- proper for me to accept all these gifts."
She went forthwith and asked the Dean of Women, and
the Dean of Women laid her vi.-e and kindly old hand on
Blossom's cheek and said, "Child, let not false pride rob you
of Imppiness. Accept the>e gifts from Tom."
"Lord love you, \\ ise and Kindly," breathed Blo>som, drop
ping grateful tear:* into the Dean's reticule. "1 must run and
tell Tom."
"Yes. run, child, said the Dean, a -mile wrinkling her wi-e
and kindly old eyes. "And a.-k him ha- he got an older brother.
