# Mammoth Toothy Bone Discovered
## 
### 
A tooth has been found in the same place as a recently discovered
bone which was identified as a portion of a mammoth's pelvis by
Dr. Earl Packard, a research associate at Stanford and emeritus dean
of the University of Oregon school of sciences.
The yellow bone, 1.3 inches long by seven inches wide, and the

tooth were found by an excava
tion crew at an underpass project
at Page Mill Road and Oregon
Avenue, Palo Alto.
"The tooth, found several days
ago at the same place, adds fur
ther interest, to the discovery," re
marked Packard last night in an
interview with The Daily.
'"Although it can't be told defi
nitely which of the mammoths liv
ing in the Ice Age |about 12,000
years ago in the Pleistocene pe
riod | it is from, I feel it to be one
of several species, including the
Imperial and Washington mam
moths.
"There is no record of any mam
moth being discovered yet in the
Pay Area, although dwarfed mam
moths have been found on Santa
Jtosa Island."
When asked if finding of the
tooth would help in determining
of which mammoth it was possi
bly a representative, Packard said,
"It is very difficult even to deter
mine from the elephant tooth,
since the tooth is a series of plates
of enamel, up to 28 plates being
found on a single tooth, and the

number of plates on a tooth vary
from others in the mouth.' '
The bones found in Palo Alto
are from a long-tusked, hairy
mammoth apparently M foot high.
