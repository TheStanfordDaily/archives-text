# Korean Unity: Progress Key
## 
### Cally Tanner 
Continued economic progress in
Korea depends wholly on the uni
fication of North and South Ko
rea, according to Consul General
Young Han Choo, speaker at the
lIR Consular Talk yesterday.
"Until that day comes, wo are
in a very precarious position."
Choo described Korean postwar
progress in glowing terms. "In
dustry is flourishing everywhere
. . . for when the Koreans put
their mind to something, they do
it and they do it well, because
they are industrious and intelli
gent people."
He mentioned that many new
manufacturing plants for textiles,
fertilizers and jeeps, and one steel
mill have been established since
19.14.
"But this progress is not per
manent and never will be as long
as Korea is divided." A good part
of the natural resources and some
of the largest industrial plants
are in thÂ« north.
"Korea is one country," con
cluded Choo. "We will fight for
unity, when the right time comes,
and we hope that it comes soon."
