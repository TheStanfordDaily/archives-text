Macmillan said last night he
may go to Washington on his re
turn from his Moscow trip with
a view to developing a united
Western policy.
Macmillan emphasized the visit
to Moscow was not for direct ne

the ice and get some feeling of
the general situation before the
next stages."
"The next stages must be a
visit to Bonn, to Paris and per
haps to Washington with a view
to formation of the Western al
lied policy."
