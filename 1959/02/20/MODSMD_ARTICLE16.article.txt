# Thieves Lift 10 Art Prints
## 
### 
Professor Ray Faulkner of the
Art Department walked into his
classroom last Friday at about 1
p.m. to find that a series of 10
prints had been taken off a wall
where they were hung.
The prints, which are 2 by 3
feet, were ordered especially for
his senior colloquium "Form and
Content in Modern Art." They in
clude "The Lovers" by Picasso,
"Dance with Bouquet" by Degas,
"Women of Tahiti" by Gauguin
and "Nocturne" by Roualt.
They were last seen at o p.m.
Thursday. The building, which is
usually loft open for the use of
art students, is now locked in the
evenings and on Saturdays and
Sundays. It will be reopened when
the prints are returned and the
Art Department's "faith in human
nature is restored."
