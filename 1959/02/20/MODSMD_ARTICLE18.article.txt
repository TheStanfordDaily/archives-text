## Personally Speaking Standard an Individual Matter 
### Leo Krulitz 
Legislature has been consider
ing, oil' and on for (he past month,
Ihe question of vhether or not to
spend $260 to publish a new book
lot on the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code.
But —with all the discussion
011 procedural and financial mat
ters — the important question
has been lost. That question is:
How do you revive the Funda
mental Standard from its mean
ingless or misunderstood state?
Perhaps there is still a more
basic question that should be
considered: Does it make any
sense to try to revive an aware
ness of the Fundamental Stand
ard, or should we write, off the
Standard as an unnecessary and
hypocritical t radit ion?
Before going further, it would
be a good idea to point up the
assumption this writer has made,
mainly that the Standard is in
a meaningless or misunderstood
state.
This writer feels most students
probably accept this assumption,
but, for those who don't, a lew
items may be suggested as
grounds that might lead to this
assumption.
This isn't to say, of course, that
the Standard means nothing to
anyone. There are probably many
welcome exceptions.
Items leading to this assump
tion would include:
1. A statement to Legislature
by a sponsor last week to the
effect that sponsors had a terrible
time at their orientation week end
trying to figure out how to ex
plain the Standard to freshmen.
2. A quote from a freshman
gii'l during a discussion of the
Standard, "It seems to me that
people consider the Fundamental
Standard as unimportant." The
report indicated that many fresh
man girls held this same view.
3. The Standard suggests re
spect for civil law; yet the Fun
damental Standard Commission
rules that the first violation of
the California liquor law isn't a
violation of the Standard. Many
other items could be listed.
With the assumption that the
Standard is in a meaningless or
misunderstood state, this writer
personally would like to think that
the idea of a Fundamental Stand
ard is a good one and is worth re
viving, but this is a personal pref

erence one also shared, at least,
by the Fundamental Standard
Commission.
The problem we are concerned
with here, then, is: How do you
revive the Standard? How do you
communicate it? and Will the
booklet help?
One thing must he explicitly
clear before such a revival is
attempted, and that is the fact
that the Fundamental Standard
is not something which can he
deli ne d or codified —by the
Commission, the Legislature, or
any administrative dean.
The Standard can be discuss
ed in a booklet, but must be
defined by each individual. To
print and distribute a booklet in
the guise of defining the Stand
ard would be a grave error if
we are to remain consistent with
the objectives of the University.
The problem of whether or not
to codify a moral law is as old as
the break between Judaism and
Hebrew thought probably older
than that.
But if we are to maintain a tra
dition of individual dignity, each
person must work out in his own
mind — using the resources and
guideposts the University offers
his own concept of right and
wrong, decent and indecent. Civil
law, in the interests of society,
prescribes the limits and is not
the Fundamental Standard itself.
In some cases these legal lim
its are unrealistu —for example,
the liquor law —but the individ
ual always has the choice of not
obeying the law and accepting
the penalty.
Where does this leave Legisla
ture? They have the problem of
communicating the idea of the
Fundamental Standard the idea
that the individual must define it
for himself to the students, and
urging the individual to work out
his own definition.
The booklet, if presented prop
erly, would be a good first step;
the discussion groups could ij-e ex
tremely valuable; the columns of
The Daily could help; in short, al
most anything that would call at
tention to the problem could be of
value. Sponsors could be an ex
tremely important vehicle to call
attention to the idea of the Stand
ard to entering freshmen.
Beyond this, Legislature will
have to rely on the individual stu
dents to carry the communication
to the rest of the student body.

3. The Standard suggests re
spect for civil law; yet the Fun
damental Standard Commission
rules that the first violation of
the California liquor law isn't a
violation of the Standard. Many
other items could be listed.
With the assumption that the
Standard is in a meaningless or
misunderstood state, this writer
personally would like to think that
the idea of a Fundamental Stand
ard is a good one and is worth re
viving, but this is a personal pref

erence one also shared, at least,
by the Fundamental Standard
Commission.
The problem we are concerned
with here, then, is: How do you
revive the Standard? How do you
communicate it? and Will the
booklet help?
One thing must he explicitly
clear before such a revival is
attempted, and that is the fact
that the Fundamental Standard
is not something which can he
deli ne d or codified —by the
Commission, the Legislature, or
any administrative dean.
The Standard can be discuss
ed in a booklet, but must be
defined by each individual. To
print and distribute a booklet in
the guise of defining the Stand
ard would be a grave error if
we are to remain consistent with
the objectives of the University.
The problem of whether or not
to codify a moral law is as old as
the break between Judaism and
Hebrew thought probably older
than that.
But if we are to maintain a tra
dition of individual dignity, each
person must work out in his own
mind — using the resources and
guideposts the University offers
his own concept of right and
wrong, decent and indecent. Civil
law, in the interests of society,
prescribes the limits and is not
the Fundamental Standard itself.
In some cases these legal lim
its are unrealistu —for example,
the liquor law —but the individ
ual always has the choice of not
obeying the law and accepting
the penalty.
Where does this leave Legisla
ture? They have the problem of
communicating the idea of the
Fundamental Standard the idea
that the individual must define it
for himself to the students, and
urging the individual to work out
his own definition.
The booklet, if presented prop
erly, would be a good first step;
the discussion groups could ij-e ex
tremely valuable; the columns of
The Daily could help; in short, al
most anything that would call at
tention to the problem could be of
value. Sponsors could be an ex
tremely important vehicle to call
attention to the idea of the Stand
ard to entering freshmen.
Beyond this, Legislature will
have to rely on the individual stu
dents to carry the communication
to the rest of the student body.
Legislature has been consider
ing, oil' and on for (he past month,
Ihe question of vhether or not to
spend $260 to publish a new book
lot on the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code.
But —with all the discussion
011 procedural and financial mat
ters — the important question
has been lost. That question is:
How do you revive the Funda
mental Standard from its mean
ingless or misunderstood state?
Perhaps there is still a more
basic question that should be
considered: Does it make any
sense to try to revive an aware
ness of the Fundamental Stand
ard, or should we write, off the
Standard as an unnecessary and
hypocritical t radit ion?
Before going further, it would
be a good idea to point up the
assumption this writer has made,
mainly that the Standard is in
a meaningless or misunderstood
state.
This writer feels most students
probably accept this assumption,
but, for those who don't, a lew
items may be suggested as
grounds that might lead to this
assumption.
This isn't to say, of course, that
the Standard means nothing to
anyone. There are probably many
welcome exceptions.
Items leading to this assump
tion would include:
1. A statement to Legislature
by a sponsor last week to the
effect that sponsors had a terrible
time at their orientation week end
trying to figure out how to ex
plain the Standard to freshmen.
2. A quote from a freshman
gii'l during a discussion of the
Standard, "It seems to me that
people consider the Fundamental
Standard as unimportant." The
report indicated that many fresh

In some cases these legal lim
its are unrealistu —for example,
the liquor law —but the individ
ual always has the choice of not
obeying the law and accepting
the penalty.
Where does this leave Legisla
ture? They have the problem of
communicating the idea of the
Fundamental Standard the idea
that the individual must define it
for himself to the students, and
urging the individual to work out
his own definition.
The booklet, if presented prop
erly, would be a good first step;
the discussion groups could ij-e ex
tremely valuable; the columns of
The Daily could help; in short, al
most anything that would call at
tention to the problem could be of
value. Sponsors could be an ex
tremely important vehicle to call
attention to the idea of the Stand
ard to entering freshmen.
Beyond this, Legislature will
have to rely on the individual stu
dents to carry the communication
to the rest of the student body.
Legislature has been consider
ing, oil' and on for (he past month,
Ihe question of vhether or not to
spend $260 to publish a new book
lot on the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code.
But —with all the discussion
011 procedural and financial mat
ters — the important question
has been lost. That question is:
How do you revive the Funda
mental Standard from its mean
ingless or misunderstood state?
Perhaps there is still a more
basic question that should be
considered: Does it make any
sense to try to revive an aware
ness of the Fundamental Stand
ard, or should we write, off the
Standard as an unnecessary and
hypocritical t radit ion?
Before going further, it would
be a good idea to point up the
assumption this writer has made,
mainly that the Standard is in
a meaningless or misunderstood
state.
This writer feels most students
probably accept this assumption,
but, for those who don't, a lew
items may be suggested as
grounds that might lead to this
assumption.
This isn't to say, of course, that
the Standard means nothing to
anyone. There are probably many
welcome exceptions.
Items leading to this assump
tion would include:
1. A statement to Legislature
by a sponsor last week to the
effect that sponsors had a terrible
time at their orientation week end
trying to figure out how to ex
plain the Standard to freshmen.
2. A quote from a freshman
gii'l during a discussion of the
Standard, "It seems to me that
people consider the Fundamental
Standard as unimportant." The
report indicated that many fresh
man girls held this same view.
3. The Standard suggests re
spect for civil law; yet the Fun
damental Standard Commission
rules that the first violation of
the California liquor law isn't a
violation of the Standard. Many
other items could be listed.
With the assumption that the
Standard is in a meaningless or
misunderstood state, this writer
personally would like to think that
the idea of a Fundamental Stand
ard is a good one and is worth re
viving, but this is a personal pref

erence one also shared, at least,
by the Fundamental Standard
Commission.
The problem we are concerned
with here, then, is: How do you
revive the Standard? How do you
communicate it? and Will the
booklet help?
One thing must he explicitly
clear before such a revival is
attempted, and that is the fact
that the Fundamental Standard
is not something which can he
deli ne d or codified —by the
Commission, the Legislature, or
any administrative dean.
The Standard can be discuss
ed in a booklet, but must be
defined by each individual. To
print and distribute a booklet in
the guise of defining the Stand
ard would be a grave error if
we are to remain consistent with
the objectives of the University.
The problem of whether or not
to codify a moral law is as old as
the break between Judaism and
Hebrew thought probably older
than that.
But if we are to maintain a tra
dition of individual dignity, each
person must work out in his own
mind — using the resources and
guideposts the University offers
his own concept of right and
wrong, decent and indecent. Civil
law, in the interests of society,
prescribes the limits and is not
the Fundamental Standard itself.
In some cases these legal lim
its are unrealistu —for example,
the liquor law —but the individ
ual always has the choice of not
obeying the law and accepting
the penalty.
