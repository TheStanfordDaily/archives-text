# This Point of View

### Walt Wurfel 
Both proposals for a student
radio station now being considered
by the Administration strive to
mark a clear line of responsibility
from the student station manager
to the University.
The lack of well-defined respon
sibility for the station, its equip
ment and the activities of its staff
was one factor which brought the
downfall of KZSU last summer.
To correct this deficiency, the
Speech and Drama Department's
proposal would establish the new
station as a subsidiary of lhat de
partment.
Two paid personnel — an engi
neer and a secretary—would each
have duties in the radio and tele
vision section of the Speech and
Drama Department in addition to
their jobs as station personnel.
The station would receive only
part-time attention of the secre
tary. The secretary's full salary
of $3,500 a year would come out
of radio station funds, however.
The secretarial needs of KZSU
have always been met in the past
by the services of volunteer work
ers.
Necessary engineering work
could also be done by students.
At Stanford there are a dozen or
more students or faculty members
who hold the license required to
operate any radio station. One of
these people could be hired for a
fraction of the cost of a full-time
engineer. The law requires only
that the station have an engineer
on call.
This writer believes the station
could be run better by responsible
students than by hired officials
whose time and interest would be
directed to the station only part
of the time.
Under the proposal of the

Speech and Drama Department,
there is a clear danger that the
station would develop to be a pure
ly instructional tool for the radio
television faculty.
The consensus of opinion among
student planning groups last au
tumn was that the station should
be an extracurricular student ac
tivity providing high-quality pro
grams to the Peninsula; this writ
er agrees.
The proposal of the Committee
for Better Stanford Radio marks
a line of authority and communi
cation between the station's stu
dent officers and the University
without moving the station out of
the category of student activity
and making it a departmental
workshop.
A board of directors composed
of Administration and faculty rep
resentatives, as well as the sta
tion's student officers, would be
the final authority on all policies.
One member of the radio-televi
sion faculty would be responsible
for aiding and advising the stu
dent manager.
The student manager, however,
would control the station, subject
only to the approval of the board
of directors.
If the University feels it needs
final control over the station, this
can best be achieved through the
board of directors and the student
officers of the station. Control of
the station by the Speech and
Drama Department could have the
effect of modifying and interpret
ing the ideas of the University to
conform to the teaching aims of
the department.
Cooperation of the station with
the Speech and Drama Depart
ment would be a good thing sub
servience to the department would
not.

The consensus of opinion among
student planning groups last au
tumn was that the station should
be an extracurricular student ac
tivity providing high-quality pro
grams to the Peninsula; this writ
er agrees.
The proposal of the Committee
for Better Stanford Radio marks
a line of authority and communi
cation between the station's stu
dent officers and the University
without moving the station out of
the category of student activity
and making it a departmental
workshop.
A board of directors composed
of Administration and faculty rep
resentatives, as well as the sta
tion's student officers, would be
the final authority on all policies.
One member of the radio-televi
sion faculty would be responsible
for aiding and advising the stu
dent manager.
The student manager, however,
would control the station, subject
only to the approval of the board
of directors.
If the University feels it needs
final control over the station, this
can best be achieved through the
board of directors and the student
officers of the station. Control of
the station by the Speech and
Drama Department could have the
effect of modifying and interpret
ing the ideas of the University to
conform to the teaching aims of
the department.
Cooperation of the station with
the Speech and Drama Depart
ment would be a good thing sub
servience to the department would
not.
Both proposals for a student
radio station now being considered
by the Administration strive to
mark a clear line of responsibility
from the student station manager
to the University.
The lack of well-defined respon
sibility for the station, its equip
ment and the activities of its staff
was one factor which brought the
downfall of KZSU last summer.
To correct this deficiency, the
Speech and Drama Department's
proposal would establish the new
station as a subsidiary of lhat de
partment.
Two paid personnel — an engi
neer and a secretary—would each
have duties in the radio and tele
vision section of the Speech and
Drama Department in addition to
their jobs as station personnel.
The station would receive only
part-time attention of the secre
tary. The secretary's full salary
of $3,500 a year would come out
of radio station funds, however.
The secretarial needs of KZSU
have always been met in the past
by the services of volunteer work
ers.
Necessary engineering work
could also be done by students.
At Stanford there are a dozen or
more students or faculty members
who hold the license required to
operate any radio station. One of
these people could be hired for a
fraction of the cost of a full-time
engineer. The law requires only
that the station have an engineer
on call.
This writer believes the station
could be run better by responsible
students than by hired officials
whose time and interest would be
directed to the station only part
of the time.
Under the proposal of the

Speech and Drama Department,
there is a clear danger that the
station would develop to be a pure
ly instructional tool for the radio
television faculty.
