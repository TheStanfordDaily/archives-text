### A Review By Jerry Clinton 
''The Boy Friend," produced
by Comedia at the Lol't Theater,
Emerson at Hamilton, Palo Alto.
Musical comedies are usually
thought of as suited to perform
ance iri the round. The choreogra
pher's task is trebled and the cus
tomary elaborate settings of the
musical are necessarily eliminated
by a stage that faces the audience
on three sides. C'omedia has, suc
cessfully overcome these obstacles
in its production of Sandy YVil
son's "The Boy Friend."
The British spoof of 1 tie Ameri
can jazz age was originally writ
ten for a small cast in a semi
private showing, and places less
emphasis on the ornate produc
tion numbers and enormous casts
of shows designed for Broadway.
Consequently the characters ami
their dialogue play a much more
substantial part in the total effect
of the work.
These can best be brought out
in a production which brings the
audience closer to the players
than is possible in a conventional
theatre; for, as the audience be
comes more intimately involved in
the action of the play, the absence
of extensive settings is far less
noticeable.
Comedia has the additional ad
vantage of a cast that fills its
roles with such enthusiasm that
its members themselves seem to
provide all the necessary setting.
Carolyn Davis is a satisfactorily
winsome Polly, and William Kin
solving is quite engaging as Tony,
her youthful beau, in the whimsi
cal romance that provides the
play's slender plot.
Robert Atkinson gives a fine
performance as Polly's correctly
English but meltable father, and
her chorus of friends are charm
ing as irrepressihly girlish "puh
fict young ladies."

The duel "It's Never Too Laic J
to Fall in Love" between Charles
Barnes, as I lie henpecked yet pei ■ j
sistently amorous Lord Brock-!
hurst, and Carol McKanna, his
youthful conquest, is the best of
several very funny scenes.
Under Leslie Abbot's direction,
the production lakes on a gaiety
that carries ii briskly ihrough:
spots that are not otherwise ex- i
ceptional. And, taken all in all, it .
provides a very entertaining eve
ning at the theatre.

Comedia has the additional ad
vantage of a cast that fills its
roles with such enthusiasm that
its members themselves seem to
provide all the necessary setting.
Carolyn Davis is a satisfactorily
winsome Polly, and William Kin
solving is quite engaging as Tony,
her youthful beau, in the whimsi
cal romance that provides the
play's slender plot.
Robert Atkinson gives a fine
performance as Polly's correctly
English but meltable father, and
her chorus of friends are charm
ing as irrepressihly girlish "puh
fict young ladies."

The duel "It's Never Too Laic J
to Fall in Love" between Charles
Barnes, as I lie henpecked yet pei ■ j
sistently amorous Lord Brock-!
hurst, and Carol McKanna, his
youthful conquest, is the best of
several very funny scenes.
Under Leslie Abbot's direction,
the production lakes on a gaiety
that carries ii briskly ihrough:
spots that are not otherwise ex- i
ceptional. And, taken all in all, it .
provides a very entertaining eve
ning at the theatre.
''The Boy Friend," produced
by Comedia at the Lol't Theater,
Emerson at Hamilton, Palo Alto.
Musical comedies are usually
thought of as suited to perform
ance iri the round. The choreogra
pher's task is trebled and the cus
tomary elaborate settings of the
musical are necessarily eliminated
by a stage that faces the audience
on three sides. C'omedia has, suc
cessfully overcome these obstacles
in its production of Sandy YVil
son's "The Boy Friend."
The British spoof of 1 tie Ameri
can jazz age was originally writ
ten for a small cast in a semi
private showing, and places less
emphasis on the ornate produc
tion numbers and enormous casts
of shows designed for Broadway.
Consequently the characters ami
their dialogue play a much more
substantial part in the total effect
of the work.
These can best be brought out
in a production which brings the
audience closer to the players
than is possible in a conventional
theatre; for, as the audience be
comes more intimately involved in
the action of the play, the absence
of extensive settings is far less
noticeable.
