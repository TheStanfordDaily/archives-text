# TODAY AND TOMORROW
## Walter Lippmann Mid-Term Change Unwise 
### 
The decision taken by the Presi
dent last Saturday morning when
i he refused to accept Mr. Dulles'
resignation was most surely the
| right one.
For, granted that Mr. Dulles
j cannot expect to be the kind of
Secretary of State lie has been
before, and accepting the fact that
I he must for some time to come be
under treatment and withdrawn
j from activity, there is neverthe
l less reason to hope that he can
! still play a most necessary role.
This is to assure the world
that the ship will continue 011
the course in which he himself
! in the past lew months has set
it. No one else can give this
assurance, and without it there
might well he contusion, miscal
culation and suspicion abroad
i and at home.
There are, of course, obvious
disadvantages in a situation where
the Secretary of State is ill and
| inactive while the actual conduct
| of affair's is the responsibility of
j his subordinates.
But it is hard to imagine any
! good alternative, given all the cir
cumstances of hi-s unique relation
with the President, his record and
his reputation, and the fact that
we are approaching one of the
many climaxes of the cold war.
Change in Policy
' II is no mere accident, nor is it
a sign of Hie fickleness of public
opinion, that even before his pres
ent illness there had begun a
j marked change in world senti
ment about Secretary Dulles.
This change of public opinion is
not due only to his indomitable
J pei'sonal behavior. It reflects a
I change in the temper- and tone of
his diplomacy. II is a response to
; the sign of "flexibility" which Mr.
I Dulles has judged to be prudent
and desirable both in the Far Fast
and in Germany. In these changes
the rejuvenated Department ol
Slat e has played its necessary
part.
This is the first reason why
it would he a mistake to Wring
in from the outside a new and
eminent personage. There is no
! body 011 the outside who now
possesses the kind of experi-
I ence needed for negotiation in
the current phase of our en
counter with the Soviet Union.
Whoever he was, lie would he
a novice; and, long before he
could hope to master the situa
tion in his own mind, the climax
| we are now approaching would
have come and gone.

If this were a new Administra
tion at the beginning of its term,
and if there were no climax ahead
in Germany, the President might
look around for a Secretary of
State who, in the old tradition of
the office, was a political power
in the land. He might think, let
us say, of ex-Governor Dewey
but not today, when knowledge
and experience are so necessary
and when there is so good a team
already in the field.
Middle of the Term
111 all of this, it is necessary
: to remember that >Ir. Dulles'
extremely personal way of con
ducting his of 112 i c e has been
unique, and it cannot he dupli
cated even if it were desirable
to attempt it. It will be neces
> sary therefore to put more trust
in the ambassadors we sent
abroad, or to send abroad ant
bassadors whom we can trust.
Koving Ambassadors
It may be desirable to have one
or two roving ambassadors where
the problems at issue cover a
whole region rather than a single
country. It will be desirable to
talk things out more at length
than is now being done with the
foreign ambassadors in Washing-
In the special case of the So
viet Onion, exceptional proce
dines are probably necessary;
for, with rare exceptions —with
only one exception that I know
of —the Soviet Union will not
rely on the normal diplomatic
channels.
