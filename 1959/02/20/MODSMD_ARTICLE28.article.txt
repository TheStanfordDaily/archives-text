# ASSU $2200 Office Expansion Will Include Wall Removal
## 
### 
Plans for expanding the ASSU
office were approved Wednesday
by the Union Board and work
may begin Tuesday, according to
Business Manager Larry Kelley.
The Board appropriated $2150
for the project, which includes
removal of the wall between the
office and the present Concert Se
ries office. This will make one
large room and a small room

which will house the newly-ac
quired accounting machine. The
entire area will also be covered
with new linoleum.
The chief purpose of the expan
sion is lo have more space for
group treasurers and committee
chairmen who refer to ASSU re
ports and records.
The changes have been needed
for a long time, acording to Kel
lev, and the present plans were
begun by Martin Johnson and
Miss Imogen Aten, ASSU office
manager and business manager.
No action was taken, however, as
plans were being made for the
new Union, but since the offices
in the new building will not be
part of the first section, it was
decided to go ahead.
