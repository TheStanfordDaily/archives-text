# Nevada Assembly Bill Asks California and Back Taxes
## 
### 
California's comic "war" with Nevada became decidedly unfunny
Wednesday when Nevada legislators passed a resolution which de
mands restoration not only of 10,000 square miles of disputed terri
tory, but also back taxes plus compound interest on that land, a
matter of $77) billion, or one-quarter of the national debt.

The legal battle started when
Nevada claimed California land
east of the Sierra crest, from
Bishop to the Oregon border, in
cluding Lake Tahoe, Truckee, and
all of the Modoc National Forest.
Congress clearly gave the land
to Nevada in 1861, subject to
California's approval, a condition
which has never been acted on.
Last week, Nevada politely re
quested that California do some
thing about it.
Reaction was light and filled
with joking predictions of naval
battles on Lake Tahoe and "war"
between the states.
Wednesday's resolution by the
State Assembly was in a com
pletely different tone. It directed
the Nevada Attorney General to
sue California for restoration of
the lands and money.
"I'm in dead earnest about
this," said Assemblyman Don
Crawford (D-Washoe). "There
has been an unfortunate amount
of joking . . . but a staggering
sum of money is involved."
