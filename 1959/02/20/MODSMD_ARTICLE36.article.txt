The Weekend of (Iriieinls
The Bay Area has been evacuated of Pacific Coast Conference
basketball teams. The week of crucials has arrived for the front
runners.
Most of the attention will go north with the California basketball
team, Straw Hat hand, and others- where the league leaders can
either almost wrap up their third straight crown, or where the race
can suddenly become a down-to-the-wire thriller.
The Palouse country will be mighty busy this weekend. Leader
Cal (S-2> and second-place Washington (8-3) will spend KYiday and
Saturday about nine miles apart: the Huskies meet Idaho in Moscow
Friday, while the Bears are facing Washington State in Pullman.
Saturday, they trade foes.
The trouble isn't over for Cal. Monday they must meet Oregon
State in ( orvallis.
No southern team has come through the three-game northern
swing unscathed this year. Cal barely managed last year; Southern

Cal started off last season doing
it, and then fell to an undistin
guished 8-8 finish.
As for us little Indians, we'll he

DEPARTMENT: And the statis

ring injury or illness, Washington
center Doug Smart will become
this weekend (he top all-time
scorer in Pacific Coast Confer

But. so far, Smart has no! won
a I'CC scoring title and chances
are pretty good that he won't
again this year, either. Smart
needs just 25 points the rest of

in live games he should be able

Track's Sneak Preview
Meanwhile, back at Ihe Farm, anyone who likes variety in his
spoils menu should have a field day. If the weather co-operates.
A real unveiling ol Stanford's 19HH hack power will take place
tomorrow afternoon at Angell Field in Ihe big winter intrasquad
meet, the climax lo Coach l*a.vton Jordan's annual track ami field
clinic.
And that track power may be more than some were expecting.
Things became more promising last week when, in a developmental
meet, little (5-71 sophomore John Nonrse soared (i-4 in the high jump
and senior Armand DeWeese cut loose vvilh a IGG-fool throw in Ihe
discus. The high jump and discus were two of the expected weak
spoils this year.
No one is going lo deny Jordan's raft of power in the distances.
Names like Lloyd, l.iindh, Cunliffe, Wallace, l.assen are going to
dominate PCC distance running this year with only an occasional out
side threat. Then there is a brilliant freshman, Fvangelo Despastas.
The whole group returns next year.
Last year's top sprinters, Dean Smith and Norm Pease, return.
Already they're showing signs of improvement. And they're both
back next year.
They're Playing (iames lip There
SO THK OUTCASTS STRIKE BACK: And from the north this
week came Ihe rather surprising, rather amusing, news that the
four outcasts of Ihe PCC Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State
and Idaho are going to open up their athletic aid programs.
if Washington of the Big Four was figuring on dominating the
Northwest talent market with better inducements for athletes, it
looks like the outcasts have decided to muddle things up a bit. Also,
the outcasts will now be able to compete again, to some extent, on
the California talent scene. To the disappointment of the Big Four.
But just because the Northerners now propose full aid for athletes
does not mean that they are opening wide the program, in the same
fashion as the Big Four group. It isn't a matter of changing the re
cruiting tactics just a matter of changing the aid, once the athletes
arrive.
THIS ('RIME OF IT ALL: What price football? Why are Ihe
other sports so ignored, in this conference-killing?
Southern California Coach Forrest Twogood, speaking through
the column of Harry Missildine of the Spokane Spokesman-Review:
"Ours is one of the five great basketball leagues in the country. Now
it's going down the drain. We should try to stay together for basket
ball. . . .
"We're all to blame. We should bang our heads in shame. Next
season, no matter what kind of league we call ourselves in the south,
or what they call it up north, the games will just be games. . . .
"The competition in a fine basketball conference is something you
can't replace. •. . . Who profits when this thing goes? Nobody."
Amen.

SO THK OUTCASTS STRIKE BACK: And from the north this
week came Ihe rather surprising, rather amusing, news that the
four outcasts of Ihe PCC Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State
and Idaho are going to open up their athletic aid programs.
if Washington of the Big Four was figuring on dominating the
Northwest talent market with better inducements for athletes, it
looks like the outcasts have decided to muddle things up a bit. Also,
the outcasts will now be able to compete again, to some extent, on
the California talent scene. To the disappointment of the Big Four.
But just because the Northerners now propose full aid for athletes
does not mean that they are opening wide the program, in the same
fashion as the Big Four group. It isn't a matter of changing the re
cruiting tactics just a matter of changing the aid, once the athletes
arrive.
THIS ('RIME OF IT ALL: What price football? Why are Ihe
other sports so ignored, in this conference-killing?
Southern California Coach Forrest Twogood, speaking through
the column of Harry Missildine of the Spokane Spokesman-Review:
"Ours is one of the five great basketball leagues in the country. Now
it's going down the drain. We should try to stay together for basket
ball. . . .
"We're all to blame. We should bang our heads in shame. Next
season, no matter what kind of league we call ourselves in the south,
or what they call it up north, the games will just be games. . . .

SO THK OUTCASTS STRIKE BACK: And from the north this
week came Ihe rather surprising, rather amusing, news that the
four outcasts of Ihe PCC Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State
and Idaho are going to open up their athletic aid programs.
if Washington of the Big Four was figuring on dominating the
Northwest talent market with better inducements for athletes, it
looks like the outcasts have decided to muddle things up a bit. Also,
the outcasts will now be able to compete again, to some extent, on
the California talent scene. To the disappointment of the Big Four.
But just because the Northerners now propose full aid for athletes
does not mean that they are opening wide the program, in the same
fashion as the Big Four group. It isn't a matter of changing the re
cruiting tactics just a matter of changing the aid, once the athletes
arrive.
THIS ('RIME OF IT ALL: What price football? Why are Ihe
other sports so ignored, in this conference-killing?
Southern California Coach Forrest Twogood, speaking through
the column of Harry Missildine of the Spokane Spokesman-Review:
"Ours is one of the five great basketball leagues in the country. Now
it's going down the drain. We should try to stay together for basket
ball. . . .
"We're all to blame. We should bang our heads in shame. Next
season, no matter what kind of league we call ourselves in the south,
or what they call it up north, the games will just be games. . . .
"The competition in a fine basketball conference is something you
can't replace. •. . . Who profits when this thing goes? Nobody."
Amen.

The Weekend of (Iriieinls
The Bay Area has been evacuated of Pacific Coast Conference
basketball teams. The week of crucials has arrived for the front

Most of the attention will go north with the California basketball
team, Straw Hat hand, and others- where the league leaders can
either almost wrap up their third straight crown, or where the race
can suddenly become a down-to-the-wire thriller.
The Palouse country will be mighty busy this weekend. Leader
Cal (S-2> and second-place Washington (8-3) will spend KYiday and
Saturday about nine miles apart: the Huskies meet Idaho in Moscow
Friday, while the Bears are facing Washington State in Pullman.
Saturday, they trade foes.
The trouble isn't over for Cal. Monday they must meet Oregon
State in ( orvallis.
No southern team has come through the three-game northern
swing unscathed this year. Cal barely managed last year; Southern
