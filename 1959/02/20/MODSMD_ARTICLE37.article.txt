# Cagers Travel into Southland
## 
### John Anderson 
Stanford's basketball team goes into the Southland series against
UCLA ami Southern California faced with improving its perform
ances away from home or losing all possibilities of ;i conference

championship.
In six road games so far this
to top only Oregon and Washing
ton State while losing to Cal,
Washington, Oregon State and
Idaho.
One thing has changed now,
however, as for the first time the
Tribe leaves the Farm in top
shape. Forward Jerry Thuesen
has completely recovered from
his early season attack of pneu
monia, according to head coach
Howie Dallmar.
Fast improving Chr is Burford
is another asset, having come
along very well in the last four
games. His rebounding and sharp
shooting make him an able re
placement for Sianford's over
worked first-st ringers.
More Panic Squad?
With Thuesen and Burford in
stride, Los Angeles fans may see
the return of the "panic squad"
which was so effective in the ear
ly season in slowing down the
play while the first siring rested.
The strategy floundered later
with the loss of guard John Stabl
er, out fyr the season with mono
nueleosis.
Stanford can't afford to lose
either of this weekend's games.
With a 7-1 win-loss record, the
Tribe has to win all tlx rest and
wail for ('al to lose two and Wash
ington to drop one, to throw the
race into a three-way lie for first
and a playoff.
Cal in Northwest
Cal laces a tough Northwest in
vasion of Washington State, Ida
ho arid Oregon State this week
end, an excursion the Indians took
earlier in the season coming out
with one win and two losses.
Washington also travels to the
Palouse for contests against the
Cougars and Vandals.
Stanford will play the opener
of tonight's double-header al the
Pan Pacific Auditorium against
Southern Cal; Oregon meets IJC
LA in the second game, switching
opporrerds with Stanford tomor
row.

for a change, on even ground in

only 6-3. Center position is the
jig weak spot on the team with
Coach Forrest Twogood not being
able to find one player who can
lo the job well consistently.
Dig Jim llanna, (>-7, 233 pounds,
is having his worst season on the
post but he is big enough, savs
Dallmar, that he could give the
shorter Tribe plenty of trouble.
Starting guards are Steve Kemp
i and Hill Bloom.
Tomorrow the Cards will try to
repeat their performance of last
! week against the Bruins of UC

j LA. But now the home court ad
! vantage belongs to the Uelans
and the conference's leading scor
er Walt Torrence. The Bruin sen

Neumann was able to "hold"
Torrence to If) points last week,
and according to Dallmar ii will
have to be done again, for the
best way to beat the Bruins is to
hold Torrence to under 20.
Warnell ("Rocking Horse")
; .Jones, (i - !t, 210 - pound center,
played his best game of the sea-
J son against the Cards a week ago.
| Even though he scored only four
points he played a fine defensive
game under the backboards, and
is his team's top hustler.
The Westwoodians are the lead
ing rebounding team in the league
and Stanford is second from the
bottom. Il will take torrid shoot
ing from the outside for the
Cards to overcome the height dis
advantage the second shots will
probably be few and far between.

Daily sporlswriters John An
derson and Steve BalTrey are
(raveling south for this week
end's games. Their reports will
appear in Tuesday's [taper.
