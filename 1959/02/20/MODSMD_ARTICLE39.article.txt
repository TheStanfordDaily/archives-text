# Frosh Host Naval Men
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman hoopsters
will be charging down the home
stretch ol their season in the Pa
vilion this week end as they play
Moffett Field NAS today and San
Francisco Presidio tomorrow. As
the varsity will be playing down
south this week end, both games
will begin at 8 p.m.
The Stanford Braves face the
same opponents on opposite nights
in (> p.m. games. Coach Ron Wag
ner's JV's found new strength last
week in rolling up a record 104
points when they trounced Hart
nell Junior College.
Next week the frosh will close
their season with games against
Marin Junior College and San
Jose Junior College.
The Papooses this week end will
be going with their usual lineup
of John Windsor at center, Rich
Hosley and Nels Christensen at
forwards and John Fontius and
Jim Bryan at guards.
The frosh will most likely be
trying for a repeat of their per
formance against San Francisco
City College last Saturday
though they would no doubt just
as soon have the score reversed.
Although they lost to the Rams,
70-09, the Papooses turned in what
i-! quite possibly their finest per
formance of the season. They hit
on an amazing 51 per cent of their
shots and had a well-balanced at
tack, with four players hitting in
double figures.
The Ram s, however, put on
quite a show themselves, as they
canned 50 per cent of their shots
and capitalized on 12 Papoose
bad passes.
