will be his front-line performers I
in 1959, awl will furnish fans wilh |
an early look at what promises to I
be among the rno.it interesting
Stanford teams.
Strength on Track
There's no doubt that Stanford's
principal strength is in the flat |
races. But a switch here and I
there plus some surprising winter
performances make it appear as
though the Indians may nol bo as
weak in other spots as was at J
first feared.
Dean Smith, Norm Pease and
Ben Anixter lead a veteran sprint
unit. Smith had a !).(! to his credit
in 1938, and the other two each
had a 9.7 in the 100. With Pease)
and Anixter expected to hold the

attempt to bolster a possible weak
spot.
