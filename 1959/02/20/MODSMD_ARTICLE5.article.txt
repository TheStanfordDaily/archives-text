# Burbank, Muir Allowed Liberalized Open Houses
## 
### Jack Winkler, Associate Editor 
"A unique arrangement in these I
two houses makes the changes
possible," said Larimer. "With a
faculty resident living right in |
Muir [English profe-ssor Wilfred!
11. Stone|, we feel we can liberal
ize the speial rules to a certain j
extent."
The presence of the faculty res-1
ident plus the R.A.'s who will l>e :
on duty during each open house
constitute the adequate chaperon
age that was lacking in the fra
ternities' open-house suggestions
which were turned down by the
Administration a few weeks ago.
The new rulings for Muir and
Burbank constitute the first of
what may be a series of "up
ward" liberalizations in the "up
and-down" question.
Future possibilities include:
• Extension of open-house privi
leges to other independent men's
houses when additional faculty
residences are built. Preliminary
drawings have already been made
to put up a faculty cottage on

Muir and Burbank houses of Stern Hall have been given a liberal
ized open-house policy, allowing women upstairs in rooms of men
two nights a week and in the floor common rooms on another two
nights, subject to last-minute changes when Assistant Dean of Men
David S. Larimer meets with Resident Assistants Tuesday evening.
