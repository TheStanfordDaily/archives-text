"A unique arrangement in these I
two houses makes the changes
possible," said Larimer. "With a
faculty resident living right in |
Muir [English profe-ssor Wilfred!
11. Stone|, we feel we can liberal
ize the speial rules to a certain j
extent."
The presence of the faculty res-1

age that was lacking in the fra
ternities' open-house suggestions
which were turned down by the
Administration a few weeks ago.
The new rulings for Muir and
Burbank constitute the first of
what may be a series of "up
ward" liberalizations in the "up

Future possibilities include:
• Extension of open-house privi
leges to other independent men's
houses when additional faculty
residences are built. Preliminary
drawings have already been made
to put up a faculty cottage on

Muir and Burbank houses of Stern Hall have been given a liberal

• The riding that a faculty resi

• Wilbur representatives have
made preliminary inquiries about
extending the open-house privi
leges. The freshman men's dorm,
which already has faculty resi
dents, is the only living group on
campus that does not now have
specific rules laid down on the
subject. A ruling on Wilbur's sta
tus may be forthcoming shortly.
