# U of C Professors Urge Participation In National Education Act Be Declined
## 
### 
Professors at the University of
California have urged their ad
ministration not to participate in
the National Defense Education
Act unless the loyalty oath re
quirement on all those receiving
grants is removed.
(This is the action suggested
editorially in The Daily on Thurs
day. Feb. 12, for Stanford.)
The recommendation came at a
meeting of the Berkeley chapter
of the American Association of
University Professors Wednes
day evening.
.\o Stanford Move
The Stanford chapter of the
AAUP, however, has taken no of
ficial stand, though a majority of
members are opposed to the oath.
"We arc pointing out what we
consider to be the dangers and
improprieties of the act"" to Uni
versity administrators, said His
tory Professor Arthur C. Wright,
president of the Stanford chapter
of the AAUP, yesterday.
In an interview with The Daily
last month Wright stated that his
group would not meet officially
unless responsibility for adminis
tration of the oaths fell on the
University itself.
Singled Out
The formal resolution at Cali
fornia objected "to the singling
out of the nation's young scholars
and scientists, or any other group
of citizens for unjustified suspi
cion of disoyalty."

Such a loyalty oath require
ment on a specific group is "con
trary to established practices of
American justice and . . . intimi
dating with respect to historic
academic freedom."
Finally, Ihe resolution conclud
ed that "for this or any other uni
versity to participate in a pro
gram whereby students arc re
quired in financial self-interest to
abjure their freedom as Ameri
cans is to abandon the ideals of
education."
Objection Growing
Objection to the loyalty oath
provisions of the Education Act
has been growing at universities
across the country. Professors of \
at least seven schools (Swarth
more, Bates, Bowdoin, Colby,

Haverford, Harvard and Yrle)
have protested the requirement
and three colleges, including Reed
College in Portland, Ore., have
refused to participate in the grant.
