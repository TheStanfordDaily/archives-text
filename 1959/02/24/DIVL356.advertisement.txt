NOT A SIGN OF A SLIP-UP!
Typing errors disappear like magic when yon use Eaton's
Corriisable Mond. Never a Iraee of Ihe word that was
erased; errors can lie (lieked off Corrasable's special surface
with an ordinary pencil eraser. Saves re-typing, time and
money. And the sparkling new whiteness gives all typing
a new brilliance. You can't make a mistake getting
Eaton's Corrasable. (Rhymes with erasable.)
