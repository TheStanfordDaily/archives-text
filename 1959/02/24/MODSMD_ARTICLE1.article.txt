### Jach Winkler, Associate Editor 
President Wallace Sterling will confer with the Advisory Board,
an elected faculty consulting body on policy matters, on the loyalty
oath provisions of the National Defense Education Act, as soon as
a convenient date can be arranged.
Announcement of I he coming meeting was contained in a statement

issued Friday by Presidential As
sistant Frederic O. Glover of
Stanford's position on the oaths.
The declaration came in re
sponse to a request by the Palo
Alto Times last Thursday that
the University make its feelings
clear.
As announced three weeks ago,
Stanford will receive $11,000 from
the government under the act,
loyally oath included. Sterling re
ported this to the Board of Trus
tees last Thursday evening at
their regular meeting.
The upcoming talks with the
Advisory Board are on the Presi
dent's own initiative, Glover said
yesterday, and are not at the re
quest of the Board or as a result
of the recent opposition to oaths
voiced by the University of Cali
fornia faculty.
The statement from Glover:
"Stanford does not believe
that loyalty oaths are effective,
and objected to the oath provi
sion when discussing the pro
gram initially with government
officials.
"In view of recent discus
sions of the oath issue, Presi
dent Sterling" plans to confer 011
the matter with the Advisory
Hoard, an elected group of fac
ulty members with whom lie
consults on University policies.
"Stanford, like other educa
tional institutions in the coun
try, applied for a grant under
the National Defense Education
Act with knowledge that the
oath was required. It was the
University's initial conclusion
that to refuse to participate in
the program was to deny aid to
shidens wtho.se needs could not
he met by other University re
sources.
"For years students at Stan
ford and other universities have
signed an identical oath in con
nection with National Science
Foundation fellowships. Simi
lar oaths are required of teach
ers in the state school system.
These precedents indicate that
an oath of this nature is not un
precedented when linked to pay
ment: of state or federal funds.
"The whole matter needs fur
ther review by each individual
institution .and not least of all,
by llie federal government."

issued Friday by Presidential As
sistant Frederic O. Glover of
Stanford's position on the oaths.
The declaration came in re
sponse to a request by the Palo
Alto Times last Thursday that
the University make its feelings
clear.
As announced three weeks ago,
Stanford will receive $11,000 from
the government under the act,
loyally oath included. Sterling re
ported this to the Board of Trus
tees last Thursday evening at
their regular meeting.
The upcoming talks with the

voiced by the University of Cali
fornia faculty.
The statement from Glover:
"Stanford does not believe
that loyalty oaths are effective,
and objected to the oath provi
sion when discussing the pro
gram initially with government
officials.
"In view of recent discus
sions of the oath issue, Presi
dent Sterling" plans to confer 011
the matter with the Advisory
Hoard, an elected group of fac
ulty members with whom lie
consults on University policies.
"Stanford, like other educa
tional institutions in the coun
try, applied for a grant under
the National Defense Education
Act with knowledge that the
oath was required. It was the
University's initial conclusion
that to refuse to participate in
the program was to deny aid to
shidens wtho.se needs could not
he met by other University re
sources.
"For years students at Stan
ford and other universities have
signed an identical oath in con
nection with National Science
Foundation fellowships. Simi
lar oaths are required of teach
ers in the state school system.
These precedents indicate that
an oath of this nature is not un
precedented when linked to pay
ment: of state or federal funds.
"The whole matter needs fur
ther review by each individual
institution .and not least of all,
