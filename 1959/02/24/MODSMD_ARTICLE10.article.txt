### Ellington K. Farthingale 
With (he problems of filling out
income tax forms .just fading
from sight, tiro little men of Ham
mer and Coffin House have de
cided that a refresher is needed.
But a light refresher.
In view of this, the coming
Chaparral is rumored to have one
of those things the mag men eall
an insert, which is to he a short
satire on the IBM annual report
to their stockholders.
The Daily feels there are limits
to what is good and what is had,
and, since t he Chappies appeared
to reach their good limit last issue,
there is only one direction from
t here -down.
Understand, we haven't seen the
mag. hut intuition should tell the
educated <souI that, while we "nev
er had it so good" last month, we
won't have it so good this time.
We'll sec.
