## 
### 
Stephen F. Paniak, a second-year Stanford medical student, is missing and presumed drowned after
being swept into the ocean yesterday while skin diving off Bird Rock, south of Monterey, according to
the Monterey County Sheriffs' Office.
Paniak and a companion, Stephen Nelson, another second-year Medical School student, had been in
the waters off the waters off the coast "only 10 or 15 minutes," according to Nelson, when they tired

trom the very strong current and j
look refuge on Bird Rock, about
200 yards from the shore.
Nelson reported that ho helped
Paniak to the rock and then
climbed up himself.
Not to Br Seen
"1 looked around," said Nelson,
"but Paniak had slipped away
and wasn't to be seen. I was too
bushed to go after him immedi
ately, and 1 went on top of the
rock and looked into the water
everywhere, but I couldn't see
him." Finally Nelson's strength
came back and he swam to shore.
I
The tragedy was reported to
the Sheriff's Office at 3:45 p.m.
yesterday by Nelson and Paniak's
fiancee, Pat McMahon, a fresh
man at San Francisco College for
Women, who watched from the
shore.
Coast Guard land and sea
search parties and a helicopter
team from the 33rd Transporta
tion Company, Fort Ord, assisted
the Sheriff's Office in the rescue
attempt.
Combed Area
Searchers from all three agen
cies combed the area until dark
ness halted the search last night.
No trace of Paniak's body was
found.
According to Deputy F. W.
Pottharst of the Monterey County
Sheriff's Office there is virtually
no chance that Paniak will be
found alive. Paniak was reported
to have had little skin diving ex
perience and, according to Pott
harst, the extremely heavy surf
and swift current "would have
been difficult for even experi
enced men."
The search for Paniak's body
will continue today, said I he Sher
iff's Office, as a joint operation
of the Sheriff's Office and the
Coast Guard, and ground units
will begin searching the coastline
again at dawn. A sea search will
probably be continued by Coast
Guard boats.
Surf boat and Copter
The search party included a 36-
foot Const Guard motor surfboat
and a crew of three men, shore
search parties from the Sheriff's
Office and the Coast Guard, and
an H-21 army helicopter from the
Fort Ord unit.
While the Coast Guard boat,
scanned the waters unsuccess
fully for sight of Paniak and the
ground parties looked for his
body to wash ashore, the helicop
ter made broad sweeps of the
area.
The helicopter arrived at 4:40
p.m. and scanned the coastline for
more than an hour looking for
Paniak's body among the rocks.
Search Difficult
The copter's search was made
difficult, according to the pilot,
Lieutenant Norman Stockton, by
the high breakers sometimes 25
feet in heightâ€”which made it dif
ficult to pick out objects among
the rocks.
According to Stockton, the heli
copter crew searched primarily
along the coast in the hope that
Paniak had swum or been washed
to the shore. Flying at altitudes
between 25 and 50 feet, the copter
searched 10 miles or- more of
coastline near Bird Rock.
The pilot reported that most of
the coast near - Bird Rock is rocky
and uneven with only occasional
stretches of sandy beach, making
the search along the coast very
difficult. The point where Paniak
was lost is on the scenic, but rag
ged, 17-Mile Drive coast. It was
irot known if the helicopter scarch
would continue today.
