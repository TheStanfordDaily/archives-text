# Cinch Notices

### 
CINCH NOTICES as ihcv exist now at Stanford have wry little use
fulness and should he eliminated.
There are lour basic reasons why the Administralion should
do away with the cinch notice system:
• First, cinch notices don I tell a student anything that he
doe.»n't know ahead). I hey usually amount to repealing the grade
he got on a midterm, or averaging out two or three theme grades
—something we're sure he can do by himself. If his grades are
low, a conference with the instructor would do much more good.
I his could he arranged hv a note on a midterm from the instructor
or hy the student himself.
• We don't pretend to know the cost to llie I niversitv of put
ling out the cinch notices, hut, reflecting on the work it must take
department secretaries, the cost for clerical work to type up the
notices, and the distribution of them, we would imagine that the
amount runs to at least several thousand dollars.
At a time when requests for improvements of any kind are
usually met with a "We can't afford it." we feel the cost of cinch
notices —whatever it is is unjustified.
• The present way cinch notices are compiled makes them,
in many cases, meaningless. Some instructors submit grades and
some don't. The net result is that the student is never sure if he
has received all of them that he deserves.
• And, I ast, the idea of the cinch notice should have fallen
hv the wayside, along with the publishing of a student's grade
point in the "'Balloul." As cinch notices tell us nothing that we
don't know already, they are an unnecessary reminder a slap on
the hands, so to speak, by the Administration. We should hope
Stanford students are past that stage hy now.
There is one use which cinch notices do have, and that is to
give the sponsor an idea of how his freshmen are doing so that
he might help them, if possible. We suggest this could be taken
care of by simply having a list of the C.iv and F.nglish midterm
grades sent to the sponsors the first quarter.
With this one qualification, we urge that cinch notices he
eliminated.
