# This Point of View
## Loyalty Oaths—Justified or Not? 
### Dave Long 
An editorial in the February 12
issue ot The Daily dealt with the
subject of student loyalty oaths
for government financial support.
It seems that the American peo
ple— note I say the American peo
ple, not the American government
have decided to spend $900 mil
lion of their earnings for the edu
cation of some of the youth of the
country. Are they justified, then,
in refusing to grant such money
to persons advocating the violent
overthrow of THEIR govern
ment? It seems likely.
Now, are loyalty oaths desir
able? President Griswokl (Vale)
says the requirement of them
seems "to represent a lack of
confidence in those young peo
ple and in their future, as well
as in the educational process it
self."
Does it? I should like to sug
gest that it represents (l)a recog
nition on the part of the American
people that, regardless of the
plainness of the duty of such per
sons to uphold the American Con
stitution, certain of them—witness
Dr. Oppenheimer— may fail to see
this, and (2) a desire on the part
of the American people to remind
them of this duty.
Furthermore, does it seem like
ly that the expenditure of $900
million represents a lack of con
fidence in the students?
But does it represent a lack of
confidence in the educational proc
cess itself? Only if implicit in the
educational process is the possi
bility of teaching and advocating
the violent overthrow of the gov
ernment of the society wherein
the particular manifestation ot
that process is located. In short,
only if the educational system de
serves such a lack of confidence.
The editorial stated that "loy
alty oaths tend to alienate the
good will of the loyal citizen
without gaining a correspond
ing advantage in protecting tlie
public against the actions or in
tentions of the disloyal." 1
should like to suggest that at
least the second half of this
statement is subject to doubt.
It has become apparent: that,
for our society, education is THE
path to strategic positions therein,
particularly in the field of sci
ence, where the strategic charac
ter of such positions is often in
even a military sense. It seems
reasonable that the fewer persons
of antagonistic sentiments grant
ed funds, the fewer will occupy
such strategic positions.
In addition, I suggest that the
oaths may indeed be a strong,
positive force by way of remind

ing the recipients of these gifts
of their duty to the donors.
Now, it does seem to be the case
that the oaths do alienate the good
will of a small, vociferous group
of loyal citizens. Some, apparent
ly, are even willing to deny stu
dents access to the funds in ques
tion, if it is within their power.
Surely there must tie great and
pressing reasons for such a stand.
What are they? Various answers
have been given, and I propose to
examine their validity.
Robert M. Maelver, in his
book on academic freedom, as
serts: "In a truly democratic
country belief remains unbound,
and laws ami regulations are de
signed to curb men's actions,
not to put a curb on their
opinions."
Passing up the logical non se
quitur regarding democracy and
the "open society," let us examine
this "distinction" between theory
and practice. Does it seem likely
that he who believes that the gov
ernment should be overthrown
will, when the occasion presents
itself, refrain from ACTIONS to
this end?
Let us consider a statement
from the Association of American
Law Schools: ". . . tests of this
sort once instituted are likely to
he extended to ever-widening
areas of conduct and belief . . .
What began as an attempt to fer
ret out traitors is likely to end as
a device for determining whether
a man's opinions, and the opinions
of those with whom he associates,
conform to some standard pat
tern."
Is this likely? The state of Cali
fornia has already restricted your
"right" to murder your neighbor.
Does it then lollow that it will
soon prevent you from quarreling
with him as to the volume of his
hi-fi set?
What I am suggesting is that
the inclusion in any belief of
the advocacy of violent over
throw of the government makes
this belief DIFFERENT IN
KIND from beliefs innocent of
such inclusion.
Now, there is another argument
against the oaths thai 1 have not
yet mentioned. It is as follows:
The person urging violent over
throw of the government MAY BE
RIGHT.
This might indeed serve as a
basis for argument; but what is
not arguable is that the American
people have overwhelmingly de
cided this question in the nega
tive, and, further, that It is abso
lutely irrational to expect the sov
ereign people to provide for their
own frustration in any matter so
vital.

Surely there must tie great and
pressing reasons for such a stand.
What are they? Various answers
have been given, and I propose to
examine their validity.
Robert M. Maelver, in his
book on academic freedom, as
serts: "In a truly democratic
country belief remains unbound,
and laws ami regulations are de
signed to curb men's actions,
not to put a curb on their
opinions."
Passing up the logical non se
quitur regarding democracy and
the "open society," let us examine
this "distinction" between theory
and practice. Does it seem likely
that he who believes that the gov
ernment should be overthrown
will, when the occasion presents
itself, refrain from ACTIONS to
this end?
Let us consider a statement
from the Association of American
Law Schools: ". . . tests of this
sort once instituted are likely to
he extended to ever-widening
areas of conduct and belief . . .
What began as an attempt to fer
ret out traitors is likely to end as
a device for determining whether
a man's opinions, and the opinions
of those with whom he associates,
conform to some standard pat
tern."
Is this likely? The state of Cali
fornia has already restricted your
"right" to murder your neighbor.
Does it then lollow that it will
soon prevent you from quarreling
with him as to the volume of his
hi-fi set?
What I am suggesting is that
the inclusion in any belief of
the advocacy of violent over
throw of the government makes
this belief DIFFERENT IN
KIND from beliefs innocent of
such inclusion.
Now, there is another argument
against the oaths thai 1 have not
yet mentioned. It is as follows:
The person urging violent over
throw of the government MAY BE
RIGHT.
This might indeed serve as a
basis for argument; but what is
not arguable is that the American
people have overwhelmingly de
cided this question in the nega
tive, and, further, that It is abso
lutely irrational to expect the sov
ereign people to provide for their
own frustration in any matter so
vital.
An editorial in the February 12
issue ot The Daily dealt with the
subject of student loyalty oaths
for government financial support.
It seems that the American peo
ple— note I say the American peo
ple, not the American government
have decided to spend $900 mil
lion of their earnings for the edu
cation of some of the youth of the
country. Are they justified, then,
in refusing to grant such money
to persons advocating the violent
overthrow of THEIR govern
ment? It seems likely.
Now, are loyalty oaths desir
able? President Griswokl (Vale)
says the requirement of them
seems "to represent a lack of
confidence in those young peo
ple and in their future, as well
as in the educational process it
self."
Does it? I should like to sug
gest that it represents (l)a recog
nition on the part of the American
people that, regardless of the
plainness of the duty of such per
sons to uphold the American Con
stitution, certain of them—witness
Dr. Oppenheimer— may fail to see
this, and (2) a desire on the part
of the American people to remind
them of this duty.
Furthermore, does it seem like
ly that the expenditure of $900
million represents a lack of con
fidence in the students?
But does it represent a lack of
confidence in the educational proc
cess itself? Only if implicit in the
educational process is the possi
bility of teaching and advocating
the violent overthrow of the gov
ernment of the society wherein
the particular manifestation ot
that process is located. In short,
only if the educational system de
serves such a lack of confidence.
The editorial stated that "loy
alty oaths tend to alienate the
good will of the loyal citizen
without gaining a correspond
ing advantage in protecting tlie
public against the actions or in
tentions of the disloyal." 1
should like to suggest that at
least the second half of this
statement is subject to doubt.
It has become apparent: that,
for our society, education is THE
path to strategic positions therein,
particularly in the field of sci
ence, where the strategic charac
ter of such positions is often in
even a military sense. It seems
reasonable that the fewer persons
of antagonistic sentiments grant
ed funds, the fewer will occupy
such strategic positions.
In addition, I suggest that the
oaths may indeed be a strong,
positive force by way of remind

ing the recipients of these gifts
of their duty to the donors.
Now, it does seem to be the case
that the oaths do alienate the good
will of a small, vociferous group
of loyal citizens. Some, apparent
ly, are even willing to deny stu
dents access to the funds in ques
tion, if it is within their power.

able? President Griswokl (Vale)
says the requirement of them
seems "to represent a lack of
confidence in those young peo
ple and in their future, as well
as in the educational process it
self."
Does it? I should like to sug
gest that it represents (l)a recog
nition on the part of the American
people that, regardless of the
plainness of the duty of such per
sons to uphold the American Con
stitution, certain of them—witness
Dr. Oppenheimer— may fail to see
this, and (2) a desire on the part
of the American people to remind
them of this duty.
Furthermore, does it seem like
ly that the expenditure of $900
million represents a lack of con
fidence in the students?
But does it represent a lack of
confidence in the educational proc
cess itself? Only if implicit in the
educational process is the possi
bility of teaching and advocating
the violent overthrow of the gov
ernment of the society wherein
the particular manifestation ot
that process is located. In short,
only if the educational system de
serves such a lack of confidence.
The editorial stated that "loy
alty oaths tend to alienate the
good will of the loyal citizen
without gaining a correspond
ing advantage in protecting tlie
public against the actions or in
tentions of the disloyal." 1
should like to suggest that at
least the second half of this
statement is subject to doubt.
It has become apparent: that,
for our society, education is THE
path to strategic positions therein,
particularly in the field of sci
ence, where the strategic charac
ter of such positions is often in
even a military sense. It seems
reasonable that the fewer persons
of antagonistic sentiments grant
ed funds, the fewer will occupy
such strategic positions.
In addition, I suggest that the
oaths may indeed be a strong,
positive force by way of remind

ing the recipients of these gifts
of their duty to the donors.
Now, it does seem to be the case
that the oaths do alienate the good
will of a small, vociferous group
of loyal citizens. Some, apparent
ly, are even willing to deny stu
dents access to the funds in ques
tion, if it is within their power.
Surely there must tie great and
pressing reasons for such a stand.
What are they? Various answers
have been given, and I propose to
examine their validity.
Robert M. Maelver, in his
book on academic freedom, as
serts: "In a truly democratic
country belief remains unbound,
and laws ami regulations are de
signed to curb men's actions,
not to put a curb on their
opinions."
Passing up the logical non se
quitur regarding democracy and
the "open society," let us examine
this "distinction" between theory
and practice. Does it seem likely
that he who believes that the gov
ernment should be overthrown
will, when the occasion presents
itself, refrain from ACTIONS to
this end?
Let us consider a statement
from the Association of American
Law Schools: ". . . tests of this
sort once instituted are likely to
he extended to ever-widening
areas of conduct and belief . . .
What began as an attempt to fer
ret out traitors is likely to end as
a device for determining whether
a man's opinions, and the opinions
of those with whom he associates,
conform to some standard pat
tern."
Is this likely? The state of Cali
fornia has already restricted your
"right" to murder your neighbor.
Does it then lollow that it will
soon prevent you from quarreling
with him as to the volume of his
hi-fi set?
What I am suggesting is that
the inclusion in any belief of
the advocacy of violent over
throw of the government makes
this belief DIFFERENT IN
KIND from beliefs innocent of
such inclusion.
Now, there is another argument
against the oaths thai 1 have not
yet mentioned. It is as follows:
The person urging violent over
throw of the government MAY BE
RIGHT.
This might indeed serve as a
basis for argument; but what is
not arguable is that the American
people have overwhelmingly de
cided this question in the nega
tive, and, further, that It is abso
lutely irrational to expect the sov
ereign people to provide for their
own frustration in any matter so
vital.
An editorial in the February 12
issue ot The Daily dealt with the
subject of student loyalty oaths
for government financial support.
It seems that the American peo
ple— note I say the American peo
ple, not the American government
have decided to spend $900 mil
lion of their earnings for the edu
cation of some of the youth of the
country. Are they justified, then,
in refusing to grant such money
to persons advocating the violent
overthrow of THEIR govern
ment? It seems likely.
