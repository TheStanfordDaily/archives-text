# FRESHMEN CRITICIZE FUN STAN
## 
### Barbara Hicks 
"The Words Fundamental Standard and Honor Code have received
derogatory connotations and something must be done, or it will do
more harm than good. However, more emphasis on the matter i.s cer
tainly not the answer."

"If one does not have the hon
esty and conviction, no amount of
Fun Stan will do any good."
These comments are from some
of the freshman men who partici
pated in a poll conducted by fresh
man Legislature representatives
Jerry Majer and Bob Burnett on
the advisability of printing a new
Fundamental Standard booklet.
Responding to questionnaires
were 150 freshman men. Of these
79 per cent or 119 said they read
the booklet given them at the be
ginning of the year on the Funda
mental Standard and Hour Code.
Of the 119, 44 said they thought
the booklet had given them a
clear picture of the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
Asked whether the presence of
the Fundamental Standard makes
them act any differently than
they would by their personal con
victions, 8(5 per cent said no and
56 per cent said they thought the
Standard (not the Honor Code) is
unnecessary.

Ever since the Fundamental Standard and Honor Code Commission
asked the Legislature for an appropriation to print new booklets,
Legislature members (and some others) have shown a concern for
what the status of the Fundamental Standard is in the minds of
Stanford students.
Before going farther, let us see what the ASSU Constitution says
about the Standard:
ASSU By-laws, Article T, Section 1: "Students are expected !o show
both within and without the University such respect for order, mor
ality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure It) do this will be sufficient cause for removal from
the University."

The section adds that business integrity shall be required and that i
students will nut violate the rules ot the library.
This basic statement naturally lends itself to various interpreta
tions, but this writer does not intend to interpret iho Fundamental
Standard, rather to suggest a reason for the apparent lack of mean-

ing of the Standard for students.
Most of us have been raised in
homes where order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of oth
ers have been respected. It seems
repetitive to have these things
printed in black and white.
The 129 freshmen who said the
Fundamental Standard doesn't
make them act any differently
than they would by their own
convictions are, in this writer's
view, typical of the students
throughout the University who
sa> the Fundamental Standard is
meaningless. They already fol
low the tenets of the Standard
and feel it is useless to have il
dinned into their- ears.
Attempts to codify the Stand
ard are futile. One can make sup
por ting rules, but too often these
rules hinder the cause they are
seeking to forward. For instance,
the would-be thief does not stop
to think why there is a law that
will punish him if he steals; he
does not ask why he is not sup
posed to steal; he simply consid
ers that he may get caught.

There are already clarified elements in the Fundamental Standard,
requiring business integrity, i.e. prompt payment of bills, and not
violating library regulations. Why it was thoughl necessary to codify
these two points is not known by (his writer il would seem tha I
these would he implicit in (he Standard.
If this suggested reason for the meaninglessness of the Fundamen
tal Standard is accurate, perhaps il would he advisable for the Com
mission to re-examine its presentation of the Standard in this light.
•Rather than to indicate to students that this is a rule we live by,
here at Stanford, they could point out that we reaffirm the stand
ards of good citizenship which are taught most of us in our homes.
