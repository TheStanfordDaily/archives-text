Brotherhood Week will he what
you make it. It can he a week of
synthetic togetherness, giving you
a warm glow fanned hy publicity
while you live your life as usual.
Or it can he the start of a lifelong
attempt to see no man as alien.
Brotherhood begins at homo,
particularly with the person clos
est to you- yourself. This is good,
because you are the person you
need to know best and may actu
ally know least. And, if you are
like most people, you are your
own worst enemy. But how hard
it is to accept yourself for what
you really are, so that you can
move on from there to become
what you can really be!
Then consider the Stanford fam

ily. Find someone you resent,
someone you look down on, some
one you ignore. See what it is in
you and in them that causes this
negativism. Understand it, accept
it; act in the light of this under
standing and acceptance, and you
are on your way to making them
your brothers.
As part of the Stanford family,
you live in a privileged world. Not
quite a suburb of the urban jun
gle, not quite a country club, it
gives you the freedom and secu
rity which allow you to give much
of your energies to discovering
yourself and others, if you so
wish.
But the danger of belonging to
the Stanford family is that you
may forget your deeper and broad
er membership in the family of
man. This is not necessary, for
the family of man is well repre
sented at Stanford. Look within
you and around you, and see for
yourself.
