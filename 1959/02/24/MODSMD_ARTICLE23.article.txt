# Hoop, Pool Chances Take Gas
## Trojans Were Tough... 
### Steve Baffrey 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 20 Stanford proved an old rule here tonight
while dropping its fifth Pacific Coast Conference basket hall game to
Southern California, 71 -52.
And that rule is: You don't win basketball games if you don't hit
field goals.
Coach Howie Dallmar's Indians, as i( e cold as they have been at

any time in this campaign, were
held away from the field goal col
umns for the first nine minutes
and forty seconds tonight. They
warmed up only the slightest bit
after that ,but trailed by at least
10 counters for more than two
thirds of the tussle.
Stanford fans in L.A.'s Pan Pa
cific Auditorium were ama/.ed at
the Cards' inaccuracy in the un
lucky opening minutes of to
night's game.

At half time, with the Cards
down 42-22, a crack was discov
ered in the rim of Stanford's bas
ket, and it seemed like the mys
tery of the campaign had been
settled.
Officials Mel Ross and Erwin
Delman decided to let the Trojans
tussle with the same problem as
an equalizing factor in the second
half, hul ii didn't affect the sharp
shooting, harddriving Trojans a
single bit.

Led by the 28 point effort of 0 2
forward Johnny Werhas and the
19-counter barrage of center Bob
Hamilton, the Trojans maintained
a 13-point or better lead through
out the entire second half, and the
hard-pressed Indians were all but
at their wits' ends to narrow the
gap.
Stanford hit the low of 14 per
cent of its shots in the first stanza
while the Trojans hit at a 52 per
cent mark. Both went 5)2 per cent
at the free toss line.
