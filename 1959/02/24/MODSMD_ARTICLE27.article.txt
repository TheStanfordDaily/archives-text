# ...And Bruins Were Bad

### John Anderson 
LOS ANGELES Feb. 21 The UCLA Bruins put the finishing
touches on what proved to be Stanford's most disastrous basketball
weekend of the season by trouncing the Indians 64-51.
Disaster was twofold in this Southland series for the men from
the Farm. First in losing to the two downstate rivals and second in
that the defeats knocked the Tribe completely out of the PCC cham-

pionship picture. The Cards now
stand 7 0 in the won-loss column,
tied with SC and lICLA for fourth
spot.
Stanford was out rebounded by
the loftier Bruins 63-42 and this
spelled the main difference in the
: hall game. Shooting percentages
| for the two teams were near
| equal at .328 for UCLA and .302
for Stanford; however, the Uclans
! were able to take G7 shots to the
Cards' 53.
( lose for a While
The game was close for the
| first eight minutes, then Rafer
I Johnson dropped in a free throw
i that made it 15-14 UCLA and this
■ lead was never lost. Sharp shoot
• ing by Walt Torrence and Denny
; Crum widened the gap to 33-28 at
i halftime, and the Cards were nev
er to get closer except for a brief
! moment early in the .second half
when Dick Haga made a three
point play that brought the Cards
• to within four points.
After trailing by as much as 10
points after the intermission,
Stanford started to close the gap
i with about 4 1 -u minutes left. The
! suicide squad had given the first
j stringers a rest, and a 20-foot
jump shot by John Hendry made
! it 53-48.
BOt a free throw by Kent Miller
: followed by a lay-in by Warnell
I Jones iced the contest for the
j Bruins.
