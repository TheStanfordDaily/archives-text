# Papooses Split Two Contests
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball!
team ran its season record to j
eight wins and six losses over' the j
weekend as the fro.sh took an !
easy 74-54 decision from Moffett'
Field NAS Friday, but lost to San |
Francisco Presidio Saturday, SI - :
78.
The Moffett Field squad wasn't j
able to put up much of a light as ,
only two players on the squad 1
were over six feet tall.
Moffett took an early 6-2 lead,
but the Papooses quickly caught
up and went ahead 18-0 about
midway through the first half.
The l'rosh had a mild scare
thrown into them toward the end
of the hall' when their shooting
started going awry. Thanks
largely to the playmaking of little
Wayne Tuell, Moffett got back to
within three points of the Pa

pooses and the score read 2C>23
with about live minutes left in
the half.
A pass under the hoop to Rich
Hosley for a quick score and a
jump shot by Nels C'hristensen
put the frosh out of danger, how
ever, and the score was 3223 at
half time.
The second half saw Stanford
increase its lead steadily with
Moffett not able to do much to
stem the tide.
The Saturday Pavilion fracas
with San Francisco Presidio, an
other military base team, proved
to be almost a complete reversal
of the previous night's contest.
Presidio jumped off to a 15 7
lead with only five minutes gone
in the game and about halfway
through the opening period had a
25-12 margin. The Stanford de
fense looked anything but good
up to this point as Presidio con
tinually broke loose under the
basket for easy lay-ups.
Here, however, jump shots by
Jim Bryan and John Windsor's ro
hounds helped bring the l'rosh i<>
life, as they scored in points in
;i row to reduce the Presidio lc id
to Ihree points.
Stanford pulled info n 2f>2(> tie
and a little later, on Iwo free
throws by John Font ins, look :i
31-33 lead. Two quick buckets by
Presidio lost the lead for the
frosh and they never regained it.

Presidio jumped off to a 15 7
lead with only five minutes gone
in the game and about halfway
through the opening period had a
25-12 margin. The Stanford de
fense looked anything but good
up to this point as Presidio con
tinually broke loose under the
basket for easy lay-ups.
Here, however, jump shots by
Jim Bryan and John Windsor's ro
hounds helped bring the l'rosh i<>
life, as they scored in points in
;i row to reduce the Presidio lc id
to Ihree points.
Stanford pulled info n 2f>2(> tie
and a little later, on Iwo free
throws by John Font ins, look :i
31-33 lead. Two quick buckets by
Presidio lost the lead for the
frosh and they never regained it.
Stanford's freshman basketball!
team ran its season record to j
eight wins and six losses over' the j
weekend as the fro.sh took an !
easy 74-54 decision from Moffett'
Field NAS Friday, but lost to San |
Francisco Presidio Saturday, SI - :
78.
The Moffett Field squad wasn't j
able to put up much of a light as ,
only two players on the squad 1
were over six feet tall.
Moffett took an early 6-2 lead,
but the Papooses quickly caught
up and went ahead 18-0 about
midway through the first half.
The l'rosh had a mild scare
thrown into them toward the end
of the hall' when their shooting
started going awry. Thanks
largely to the playmaking of little
Wayne Tuell, Moffett got back to
within three points of the Pa

pooses and the score read 2C>23
with about live minutes left in
the half.
A pass under the hoop to Rich
Hosley for a quick score and a
jump shot by Nels C'hristensen
put the frosh out of danger, how
ever, and the score was 3223 at
half time.
The second half saw Stanford
increase its lead steadily with
Moffett not able to do much to
stem the tide.
The Saturday Pavilion fracas
with San Francisco Presidio, an
other military base team, proved
to be almost a complete reversal
of the previous night's contest.
