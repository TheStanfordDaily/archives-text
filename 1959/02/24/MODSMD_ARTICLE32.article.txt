# THE 						WAY A WOMAN LOOKS AT A MAN... AND VICE VERSA
## Men! Turn Back The Insidious, Softening Tide of "Togetherness"! 
### 
Most women —most men, too
—warm to the differences be
tween man and woman.
To shore up those differences
against the pervasive, blurring
tide of feminine "togetherness"
or "pal -manship", a massive
crusade is now building up on
Western campuses.
Backed by the "Western Col
legiate Committee for More
All-Woman Women and All-
Man Men", this is a crusade
in the great "where men are
men and women are mighty
glad" tradition, which popu
lated the West.
To provide an easily recog
nized identification for this
crusade, Can't Bust 'Em—a
name the West grew up with—
has come forth, fittingly, with
a pair of trousers. Not an ordi
nary pair of trousers. A special,
distinctive kind of trousers. In
entirely new, ruggedly mascu
line Cactus League styling,
called "Frisko '49ers". Pants
that mark unmistakably the
man that stands solidly for
manmanship.

For, though women have sought a kind of equality by wearing
pants, basic badge of the difference in the sexes and symbol of a
man's dignity has always been his trouijers he may "lose his
shirt", but never his pants.
If you are for more, not less, difference in the sexes ..,
If you are for purposeful men, and pliant women ...
If you feel men should be strong, and women silken ...
Join your voice today to thousands of others in this growing cru
sade for More All-Man Men and All-Woman Women.

Most women —most men, too
—warm to the differences be

or "pal -manship", a massive
crusade is now building up on
Western campuses.
Backed by the "Western Col
legiate Committee for More
All-Woman Women and All-
Man Men", this is a crusade
in the great "where men are
men and women are mighty
glad" tradition, which popu
lated the West.
To provide an easily recog

crusade, Can't Bust 'Em—a
name the West grew up with—
has come forth, fittingly, with
a pair of trousers. Not an ordi
nary pair of trousers. A special,
distinctive kind of trousers. In
entirely new, ruggedly mascu
line Cactus League styling,
called "Frisko '49ers". Pants
that mark unmistakably the

pants, basic badge of the difference in the sexes and symbol of a
man's dignity has always been his trouijers he may "lose his
shirt", but never his pants.
