# Political Conference 'Very Fine'
## 
### Leo Krulitz 
"A very fine conference" was
the comment of Stanford Profes
sor John Bun/el, as Patrick Hill
ings, Hank Lopez and two Califor
nia legislators, Phil Burt on
(Dem. > and Rich a r d Dolwig
(Rep.) wound up the last panel
of the School of Politics and stu
dents packed up their cars to re
turn to schools all over Northern
California.
"The students deserve the cred
it for making the conference a
success. Panel participants, who
included politicians, newspaper
men, public relations people and
party officials, spoke very candid
ly on a wide variety of questions
put to them. This was the hope
and the purpose of the conference
and I think everyone enjoyed it."
While campaigning was the
basic theme of the conference,
students heard variations on it
ranging from "Morality in Poli
tics," at the Sunday dinner meet
ing by Hank Lopez, a recent Dem
ocratic candidate for Secretary of
State, to "The Negro's .Role at
Mid-Century," by Franklin Wil
liams, West Coast regional direc
tor of the NAACP.
Extreme Views
Williams, talking about the cur
rent integration problem in the
South, suggested that most peo
ple considered segregationists one
extreme point of view and the
NAACP the other. Actually, he
pointed out, when an order comes
down from a court for a school
district to integrate, all the NAA
CP asks is that that order be put
into effect. To suggest that the
NAACP modify or compromise
its position is to ask that the law
be compromised.
Integrity
Lopez pointed up the need for
candidates of integrity. He illus
trated his talk by using examples
of three present-day politicians,
showing the differences in degree
of morality and how two had de
parted from their principles for
expediency's sake. Lope/, warned
of the danger of justifying the
means by the end, because, he
suggested, the means often be
came the end.
Republican Strategy
Hillings, in an interview with
The Daily following the panel dis
cussion, outlined the Republican
strategy for a comeback in 1060.
Noting that there won't be any
statewide propositions or state
wide races in the primary in June,
1060. and that there probably
won't be any Presidential primary
contests in California as both Pat
Brown and Richard Nixon are ex
pected to be favorite son candi
dates at the convention with the
California delegations pledged to
them, Hillings said he felt the
Democrats wouldn't turn out for
the primary.
Lopez suggested that this was
good strategy, and warned that
Ihe Democrats should keep on
their toes. He said he felt this
strategy might fall down when
November 1960 came around be
cause he felt most of the Republi
can attention and money will be
aimed at electing a President and
not assemblymen.
