# Frosh Reg 'As Usual'
## 
### 
Mike Immell. present Class of
'60 president, was told formally
Thursday night at LASSU that he
would be next fall's pre-registra
tion chairman.
Immell, however, knew of his
appointment the previous Monday,
when the present chairman, John
Phelps, a-sked him if he would
take the position.
Immell has indicated that the
"usual things" will happen to next
year's freshmen they will go
through orientation, campus
tours, convocation, Freshman Sun
day, the President's Tea, faculty
open houses, Co-Rec Day. a song
fest and the Flicks, plus Jolly-Up.
As of yet, the new chairman
hasn't thought up any new ways
to keep out the ever-present up
perclassmen at the Jolly-Up, "ex
cept possibly to double the police
force."
The Pre-Registration Committee
handles all aspects of greeting and
orienting students new to the cam
pus, including freshman, transfer
and graduate students. Although
some of the committee's work be
gins spring quarter, most of it is
done during the week immediate
ly previous to fall quarter.
Immell expects tryouts for the
committee to begin near the end
of this week and continue through
next week. Candidates for- possi
bly 37 positions will be judged on
personality, ideas on Pre-Rcg ac
tivities and willingness to arrive
on campus early next fall.
