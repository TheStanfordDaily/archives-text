# Valletti's Voice Shows Improvement
## 
### Walter Moore 
In I ho years since his American
debut with the San Francisco Op
era Company in 1953. Cesare Val
lotti's voice has darkened and bo
come considerably richer. It is
now capable of powerful dramatic
projection, yet it retains its basic
lyric color and flexibility.
In addition to possessing a beau
tiful and expressive instrument,
Valletti is a masterful technician
and a singer of refined musician
ship.
This was all brilliantly demon
strated in the group of Schumann
lieder which made up the central
core of Saturday night's program,
the fifth concert of the Stanford
Concert Series.
The vocal line in "Dein Ange
sicht" was beautifully molded and
sustained, yet it maintained com
plete simplicity throughout. The
spirited "An den Sonnenschein"
was sung with joyous abandon
and brilliance.
"Moiidiiueht" Outstanding'
Valletti's performance of "Mond
naeht" was outstanding for its
purity of tone, sensitive phrasing
and sure knowledge of style and
rubato. The discreet and respon
sive accompaniment of Henry
Holt was a major factor in com

munieating mood and expression.
Valletti's awareness of tonal
color and nuance was magnificent
ly demonstrated in the "Lamento
de Federico," by Cilea. At the be
ginning of the narrative his voice
was absolutely pure and almost
colorless. As the story and me
lodic line grew in tragic power,
the voice assumed a distinct "cry
ing" quality which considerably
heightened the pathos and despair
of the lament.
Those who may cavil about his
harsh and broken tone at the cli
max would do well to consider
that this brokenness might have
been the exact effect he was try
ing to achieve. The entire per
formance was a remarkable piece
of sustained vocal imagery.
The second half of the program
was devoted, for the most part, to
works written in the 20th century.
Of special note was Valletti's ele
gant and light hearted singing of
Debussy's "Mandoline." The spon
taneous charm of the piece was
beautifully set off by Holt's deli
cate and sensitive accompaniment.
In the "De' niiei bollonti spiriti"
from Act II of Verdi's "Traviata,"
Valletti again demonstrated his
ability to mold and control a beau
tiful phrase. What most tenors

bark and overaccent. Valletti sang
with ease and fine.sse, though sus
taining ihe dramatic urgency of
the music at the same time.
The concluding group of songs
was by American composers, the
best of which was Richard Hage
man's "Music I Heard With You."
Valletti's English still has a dis
tinct Italian accent, but is never
theless easily understandable.
Thoughtful Gesture
His inclusion of these American
songs on the program was a gra
cious and thoughtful gesture on
his part, considering that he could
easily have sung more opera arias
in their plage.
For his first encore Valletti sang
"II mio tesoro." from Mo/art's
"Don Giovanni," as few people in
the world can sing it. The tempo
was a good deal quicker than his
performance of ihe same aria on
the Metropolitan Opera broadcast
of Feb. 1 1 and sounded a bit rush
ed and superficial; but his superb
control of Mozartian line, techni
cal ease and elegant phrasing com
bined to make this an outstanding
performance.
The audience, w hi c h did not
i completely fill Memorial Audito
| rium, was especially enthusiastic
and recalled Valletti many times.

performance.
The audience, w hi c h did not
i completely fill Memorial Audito
| rium, was especially enthusiastic
and recalled Valletti many times.
In I ho years since his American
debut with the San Francisco Op
era Company in 1953. Cesare Val
lotti's voice has darkened and bo
come considerably richer. It is
now capable of powerful dramatic
projection, yet it retains its basic
lyric color and flexibility.
In addition to possessing a beau
tiful and expressive instrument,
Valletti is a masterful technician
and a singer of refined musician
ship.
This was all brilliantly demon
strated in the group of Schumann
lieder which made up the central
core of Saturday night's program,
the fifth concert of the Stanford
Concert Series.
The vocal line in "Dein Ange
sicht" was beautifully molded and
sustained, yet it maintained com
plete simplicity throughout. The
spirited "An den Sonnenschein"
was sung with joyous abandon
and brilliance.
"Moiidiiueht" Outstanding'
Valletti's performance of "Mond
naeht" was outstanding for its
purity of tone, sensitive phrasing
and sure knowledge of style and
rubato. The discreet and respon
sive accompaniment of Henry
Holt was a major factor in com

munieating mood and expression.
Valletti's awareness of tonal
color and nuance was magnificent
ly demonstrated in the "Lamento
de Federico," by Cilea. At the be
ginning of the narrative his voice
was absolutely pure and almost
colorless. As the story and me
lodic line grew in tragic power,
the voice assumed a distinct "cry
ing" quality which considerably
heightened the pathos and despair
of the lament.
Those who may cavil about his
harsh and broken tone at the cli
max would do well to consider
that this brokenness might have
been the exact effect he was try
ing to achieve. The entire per
formance was a remarkable piece
of sustained vocal imagery.
The second half of the program
was devoted, for the most part, to
works written in the 20th century.
Of special note was Valletti's ele
gant and light hearted singing of
Debussy's "Mandoline." The spon
taneous charm of the piece was
beautifully set off by Holt's deli
cate and sensitive accompaniment.
In the "De' niiei bollonti spiriti"
from Act II of Verdi's "Traviata,"
Valletti again demonstrated his
ability to mold and control a beau
tiful phrase. What most tenors

bark and overaccent. Valletti sang
with ease and fine.sse, though sus
taining ihe dramatic urgency of
the music at the same time.
The concluding group of songs
was by American composers, the
best of which was Richard Hage
man's "Music I Heard With You."
Valletti's English still has a dis
tinct Italian accent, but is never
theless easily understandable.
Thoughtful Gesture
His inclusion of these American
songs on the program was a gra
cious and thoughtful gesture on
his part, considering that he could
easily have sung more opera arias
in their plage.
For his first encore Valletti sang
"II mio tesoro." from Mo/art's
"Don Giovanni," as few people in
the world can sing it. The tempo
was a good deal quicker than his
performance of ihe same aria on
the Metropolitan Opera broadcast
of Feb. 1 1 and sounded a bit rush
ed and superficial; but his superb
control of Mozartian line, techni
cal ease and elegant phrasing com
bined to make this an outstanding
performance.
