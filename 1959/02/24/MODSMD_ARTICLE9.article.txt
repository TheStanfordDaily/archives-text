# Macmillan Talks With Khrushchev
## 
### 
MOSCOW (/P)—Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan got down to
business on world affairs at the
Kremlin Monday. He and Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev hold
a 2'i;-hour conference that a Brit
ish source said "went off very
well indeed."
A Soviet Foreign Ministry an
nouncement said "there was con
sideration of questions of mutual
interest."
As in the case of the informal
Macmillan and Khrushchev ex
changes Sunday at a government
villa 50 miles southeast of Mos
cow, neither side listed specific
issues nor disclosed what the gov
ernment chiefs said about them.
Disarmament
The disarmament deadlock,
however, apparently was a topic.
The question of German unity
and the future of West Berlin also
rank high as problems of interna
tional concern.
Whatever the eventual reaction
of Soviet officialdom, Macmillan
has made a hit with Moscow Uni
versity students.
He went from the Kremlin to
lunch at the British Embassy,
then paid a 35-minute visit to the
32-story university with a mes
sage of goodwill from British
youth. He got a riotous welcome.
Thousands Cheer
Thousands of youngsters
crowded corridors and fought
their way up and down in eleva
tors of the towering structure to
cheer their distinguished visitor.
Security officers were frustrated
in efforts to keep them in an or
derly file. Macmillan waved and
smiled.
"Many thousands of students
from India, Pakistan and Ceylon
come to complete their education
in Britain," he said in an address
to them. "We would like to see
more students from the Soviet
Union—you will be very wel
come."
He expressed hope that more
English books and magazines will
appear in Soviet book shops so
Russian people can read the work
R u ssi a n people can read the
works of modern British writers.
"One must keep in touch with
modern writing," Macmillan said.
"There arc other authors apart
from Dickens and Tolstoy."

tional concern.
Whatever the eventual reaction
of Soviet officialdom, Macmillan
has made a hit with Moscow Uni
versity students.
He went from the Kremlin to
lunch at the British Embassy,
then paid a 35-minute visit to the
32-story university with a mes
sage of goodwill from British
youth. He got a riotous welcome.
Thousands Cheer
Thousands of youngsters
crowded corridors and fought
their way up and down in eleva
tors of the towering structure to
cheer their distinguished visitor.
Security officers were frustrated
in efforts to keep them in an or
derly file. Macmillan waved and
smiled.
"Many thousands of students
from India, Pakistan and Ceylon
come to complete their education
in Britain," he said in an address
to them. "We would like to see
more students from the Soviet
Union—you will be very wel
come."
He expressed hope that more
English books and magazines will
appear in Soviet book shops so
Russian people can read the work
R u ssi a n people can read the
works of modern British writers.
"One must keep in touch with
modern writing," Macmillan said.
"There arc other authors apart
from Dickens and Tolstoy."
