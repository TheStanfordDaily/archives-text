# Stanford Gets Test Royalties
## 
### 
Nearly $15,000 in royalties from
Ihe Stanford Achievement Tests
have been turned over to Stanford
for use in follow-up studies of
gifted children.
The gift came from Ihe will of
the late I)r. Lewis M. Terman,
Stanford psychologist. University
officials estimate that Stanford
may receive as much as $75,000 in
royalties during the next 10 years.
Dr. Terman was noted for his
work with gifted youngsters who
became known as "Terman's Tal
ented Tots." Ife followed this
group from 1920 until his death
in 1956.
Purpose of this study was to
.soo what became of intellectually
superior children: whether they
would turn out better or worse
than Ihe average, and whether
they would become maladjusted
or leaders.
In March Ihe filth volume in
his series of studies, "The (lifted
Group at Mid-Life," will be issued
by the Stanford University Press.
This book is a report on a survey
taken during 1950-55. It tells what
has become of "Talented Tots.'
Co-author is Mrs. Mclila Oden,
research associate in psychology
with Dr. Terman.
