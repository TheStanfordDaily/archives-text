Who said that 11 if machine age
is here lo slay? The Chaparral,
of course, And (his month's Auto
million issue a summary of gen
era ligations that we already know
is a reiteration of the famous
saying.
Yesterday The haily told its
readers that the inmates <>r Ham
mer and (.' n 112 112 in House had
readied their pood limits and
therefore had but one direction to
go from there down.
And down they have gone but
we expect litis from Hie previous
quality of tlicit* publication.
This lime, the Chappies have
decided lo let loose their once a
yeai ins f, ii a parody <>t the IBM
(Intermittent Business Machine,si
annual Report to I he Stockhold
ers. The occasionally funny com
ments, s c a 11 e r c d at random

throughout I he report, give the
general impression of a hig happy
ffimiJy "I 11 !M employees, attired
in grey flannel suits, trying to
figure out just what the RF77-
Q( jl) card is good for.
Perhaps the* best satire of tlx*
I insert is found where it will at
tract the most attention on the
cover. Most likely designed with
'lie Organization Man in mind, it's
an electric abacus.
Hut in view of the quality of the
last issue . . . We already said
that there was only one direction
to go.
Remember the pilper dolls Kids
sometimes play with? The (>ld
Roy-and his cohorts have decided
to publish one of Ihe sets tliey

Your Own Madison Avenue Man."
We agree with the title 'twould
be best to be entirely cut up cr.

cut out.
Something worth looking at is
the treatise on the relative ceo
nomics of purchasing a camel or
an elephant. Charted in typical
economists' style are the qualities
of smell, original cost, resale val
ue. upkeep, byproducts, comfort
and safety all charted quantita
tivcly. .lust what the ambiguous
relationship between quantitative
and qualitative is at least maybe
the Chappies know.
The front covet* of the mag is
where the little men have placed
their best satire, though. (This is
obviously to coerce the unwary
I student into buying something

the many unspoken, but recogniz
