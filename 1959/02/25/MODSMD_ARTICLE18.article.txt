Confcrcncc on Berlin Possible

At least in its method the Allied
note to the Soviet Union published
last week is new and different. It
is an invitation to hold a confer
ence about Germany which does
not lay down in advance what can
be and what cannot be discussed,
what must be agreed to.
This does not mean that the
Allies no longer have positions
from which they will not retreat,
as for example that they will not
withdraw their troops in West
Berlin until the whole of Berlin
becomes once again the capital of
a reunited Germany. The novelty
and the difference in the present
approach is that the note is not a
broadside in a propaganda game,
but a simple and unconditional in
vitation to confer and negotiate.
This would not have been pos
sible if the Western powers had
not reached (he conclusion that
there are in fact subjects to ne
gotiate about. Behind the simple
words of the note there lies the
fact that we have now agreed
among ourselves that we can
protect our vital interests in En
rope while we negotiate on a
number of subjects which have
until recently been regarded as
untouchable.
Kremlin's Possibilities
This is the so-called "new flexi
bility." It covers, for example, the
idea lhat reunification need not
begin with tree elections, although
some day the reunited Germany
must, have free elections. It covers
the idea that it is possible to nego
tiate de facto with the East Ger
man state. It covers the idea that
it is possible to discuss a regional
agreement for the reduction and
limitation of armaments in cen
tral Europe.
We must now wait to see how
the Kremlin reaets. It can ac
cept the invitation to confer and
negotiate, reserving its own |k»-
sition tor the conference, which
must, if it is to be at all useful,
be carried on confidentially in
the preliminary and exploratory
stages.
Or the Kremlin can issue a new
public broadside of its demands
and its terms, in which case it will
be painfully clear that the Krem
lin does not now want to nego
tiate. Or the Russians can nego
tiate confidentially—say, through
Mr. Macmillan or through diplo
matic channels—about the circum
stances of the conference to which
the West has invited them.
Dulles' Illness
Let us hope that, in making up
their minds how to react, the Rus
sians will not draw the wrong
conclusion from the fact of Secre
tary Dulles' illness. The wrong
conclusion would be that the less
Mr. Dulles is able to participate,
the more flexible and the more
disunited would be Western pol
icy. The exact opposite is Ihe
truth.
The less able Mr. Dulles is to
oversee American and Allied
policy and to cover it with his
special authority, the more rigid
will be the American position—
the more intransigent will be
Mr. Adenauer. It is Mr. Dulles
who has made possible the new
flexibility in Western policy,
and m ii c h may depend upon
whether Mr. Mikoyan realized

(Ilis when he was here, ami lias
made it plain to Mr. Khru
shchev.
Cmpial Fact
The Russians eould easily mis
understand this crucial fact. They
have their own long-standing ster
eotype that Mr. Dulles is unyield
ing and implacable. They have
highly-simplified views of human
character and of human behavior,
and they have a rather danger
ously simplified view of Mr. Dul-

les —who is, in fact, a complicated
man. The Russians may not be
able to appreciate quickly enough
that their view of Mr. Dulles as a
monolithic character is a mistaken
one.
They may be confirmed in 1 heir
prejudice by much that is being
printed in this country. In many
quarters Mr. Dulles is being pic
tured as a kind of granite monu
ment which never changes and
never bends, no matter what the
winds that blow.
This is mythology, and, al
though it is intended as adulation,
it does less than justice to this
worldly and experienced man. The
myth has little relation to the fact
that John Foster Dulles is and
always has been a very practical
man who measures the strength
of the forces about him and sets
his course accordingly.
Conference Possible
11' the Kremlin does not mis
judge the situation, there will
l>e a conference. If there is one,
it is, of course, improbable—in
deed impossible —that the con
ference will produce a grand
settlement of the German ques
tion. But, on the other hand,
once lH»tb sides commit them
selves to a conference, they can
not break it up in total, angry
disagreement without running
the gravest risks.
Once they meet, they cannot: do
less than 10 work out arrange
ments about Berlin and the two
Germanys which, though tenta
tive and provisional, could evolve
in the course of time into some
thing more acceptable and more
permanent.
