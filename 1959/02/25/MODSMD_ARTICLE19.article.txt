Editor, The Daily:
I wish to append the following
to my yesterday's article regard
ing student loyalty oaths. The
most commonly used argument
against the oaths is that they are
ineffective. My answer to that
argument unfortunately appar
ently was cut while the paper was
being made up. It is as follows:
Anyone taking the oath falsely
may well beware of the conse
quences of so doing. If he does
belong, or has belonged, to any
subversive organization or if, in
the future, he engages in subver
sive activities (e.g., activities
aimed at the violent overthrow of
the government), he is subject to
charges and trial for perjury.
This should eliminate any but the

I most dedicated fanatics, and even
they will readily see that the sign
ing of such an oath will sternly
curtail their future activities.

informed readers that California's
14,495-foot Mt. Whitney was the
highest point in the nation. The
newest state in the Union has Cal
ifornia lopped by almost 6,000
feet. We Alaskans can boast the
highest point in North America as
well as in the United States. Mt..
McKinley rises 20.320 feet above
