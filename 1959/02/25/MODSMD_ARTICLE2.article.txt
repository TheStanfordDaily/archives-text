### 
MOSCOW (IV) Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev causlieally al
- Western foreign policies
on dermany Tuesday in a Krem
Jin speech at a British Embassy
receplion. British sources said
visjling Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan reacted with' some
shock when he heard of Khrush
chev's remarks.
Later Macmillan met with top
advisers to work out the best at
titude toward Khrushchev's tough
speech on Germany, the Middle
Hast and Western policies gener
ally.
Talks Snag
The Moscow diplomatic colony
was buzzing with reports that the
talks have struck a snag.
If there was any change by ei
ther side in their positions on cold
war issues as a result of last
week's talks, it was not apparent.

The Khrushchev speech was de
scribed hy Pritish sources as un
usual since it came right in the
middle of private conversations
between the two leaders. It was
delivered during a break in the
talks while Macmillan was on a
one-day trip lo Dulina, the Soviet
atom center !Â»(.) miles northeast of
Moscow.
Rejection
Khrushchev apparently reject
ed the West's proposal for a Big
Four foreign ministers' meeting
on Germany. It would have been
just fine at the windup of World
War IT, he said, hut "now the idea
is plainly obsolete."
The Soviet Union, the United
Slates, Britain and France cannot
discuss German unification, he
contended, because "this is a ques
tion for (ho two German states
themselves."

Khrushchev repealed as "more
expedient" the Soviet proposal,
already turned down by the West,
for a meeting of the government
chiefs of all nations that waged
war against Hitler to work out a
German peace treaty.
