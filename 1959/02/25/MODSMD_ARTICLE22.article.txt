Unshared ideas arc nol ideas at
all: they are reflections, rumina
tions, reveries self • serving or
prefatory to ideas. Ideas must be
shared, perhaps with ;i single con
fidant, with a group of friends,
or with the world; it is the com
munication of them that gives
them meaning. Thus an interest
in ideas embodies an interest in
people.
In one sense all interests and
activities may be seen as ways
people find of relating to their
fellow men. Some scholars, ar
tists, scientists even professors,
may seem shy or withdrawn, ab
sorbed in their works, but those
very works provide them the in
dispensable link with other hu
man beings.
When we think in cosmic terms,
which seems necessary these
days, it is sometimes easier to see
what all human beings have in
common: we are the carriers, the
custodians of human life. Our
own single lives acquire meaning
because they are a part of all life.
For us each of life's central task
is developing ways of relating to
others which are mutually satis
lying. Any relationship, any act
which strengthens, preserves,
beautifies, or ennobles any life,
uplifts us; that which weakens,
destroys, disfigures, or demeans
a life, degrades us. In this per
spective, the brotherhood of man
becomes more than a subject for
Sunday sermons: it is a stark bio
logical, psychological fact.
