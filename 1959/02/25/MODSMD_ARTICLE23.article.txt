# Tonight at the Symphony
## Contralto and a Tenor 
### Diana Smith 
A contralto and a tenor tonight:
Maureen Forrester and Richard
Lewis will solo with the San Fran
cisco Symphony in Mahler's song
symphony "Das Lied von der
Frde" ("The Song of Hie Farth").
Also, conductor Jorda has re
turned from Baltimore.
Mahler wrote around (he turn
ot the century with an approach

in many ways similar to lhal of
the French impressionist paint
ers. He shared, for example, their
Oriental influence: the texts of
"Das Lied" are from the Chinese,
and three descending notes of the
Chinese pentatonic scale appear
variously in each of the songs of
this symphony-with-solo-voices.
A neo-romantic in feeling, and
tagged the outstanding exponent

of the Viennese Neo-Romantic
School, Mahler chose neo-classic
forms. "Das Lied" shares with
other of his late work linear, con
trapuntal melodic threads.
Miss Forrester is from Mont
real, and generally more familiar
to European audiences than to
Americans a gap, however, she
has been steadily closing since a
19f>G New York debut.
Lewis deserted his native Man
chester, England, cotton industry
for the study of music as soon as
he could. His pursuit was further
interrupted by the war, but Lewis
has been an established concert
and oratorio singer since IM-17.
An orchestral deference to the
150 th anniversary of Mendels
sohn's birth will open tonight's
program: the Symphony No. 4 in
A major, Op. !)().
The amiable "Italian" is intro
duced, vigorously, with an Allegro
vivace, which is succeeded by the
processional Andante con moto.
The third movement is a graceful
fantasy marked Con moto mode
rato, and the fourth, Saltarello,
derives from the sporting frenzy
of the Roman carnival.
