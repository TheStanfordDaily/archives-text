A .second day of searching for
(he body of Stephen Paniak, sec
ond-year Stanford medical school
student who was swept into the
ocean Monday while skin diving
off Bird Rock near Monterey, has
failed to recover the student's
body.
According to Captain Lugene
Trenner of the Monterey County
Sheriff's Office, there is no more
than a 50-50 chance of recovering
Paniak's body. "But the tides
change during the flay," said
Trenner, "and his body might be
washed ashore at any time, so we
will continue the search."
Teams of searchers from the
Sheriff's Office and the Del Monte
Forest Patrol scanned the shore
line for three miles near Bird
Rock today. The Sheriff's Office
stated that the waters that swept
Paniak to his death were still too
treacherous to send skin divers to
search the tide pools along ihe
shore.
Paniak was lost off Bird Rock
Monday afternoon after lie and a
companion, Stephen Nelson, also
a second-year med school student,
had been in the water only a few
minutes.
An army helicopter, a Coast
C.ua rd surf boa I and shore teams
searched Ihe area Monday until
halted by darkness.
