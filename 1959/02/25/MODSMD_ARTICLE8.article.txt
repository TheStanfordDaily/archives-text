The books and people of Sin
clair Lewis still seem grotesque
to the people of our society due
primarily to the fact that we can
still somewhat recognize the val
ues of the humanities that they
omit.
Mark Schorer, professor of
English at the University of Cali
fornia, well presented the familiar
topic of the sinking value of the
humanities under the title "The
Harassed Humanities" in last
night's Tuesday Series.
The rise of the sciences, social
sciences and the humanities was
broken down to represent imper
sonal objects, group relationships,
and the study of man as individ
ual men. Only through the hu
manities may the knowledge of
the other two be evolved into wis
dom, stated Schorer, but the lack
of interest in this branch is ap
palling.

In referring to Lewis' books,
Schorer pointed out that the char
acters were people untouched by
the humanities, tinged with the
stain of inhuman qualities. The
characters are middle-class he
roes, vacant social types forming
mere protective groups in a non
social world. In these worlds de
void of human values, only social
monsters and living death pre
vail.
The study of the humanities
comprises a study of all sources
tracing the history of man, his
environment, and his experiences.
Schorer took the values of hu
manities to be represented as the
values of a woman, and the crea
tion and continuity of the human
ities became represented by a
"seed-planting She" of all time.
But with her in her beginnings
was her caveman mate and his
axe, helping her to found civiliza
tion.

In the eyes of the Renaissance
portraits there is the sign of self
assurance and self-confidence in
individuality, but in today's art.
even the recognizable and noble
man has vanished in abstraction
and symmetry.
Schorer went on to note that,
this same overshadowing of man
has tended to make himself lose
his stature as a man. The lack of
creative challenge results in
courses such as "The Use of
Deodorants" and "Marriageable
You," offered in our schools to
day. We too easily permit our
selves to slide to the "other di
rectedness" of the masses. The
threat of scientific supremacy
puts Homer back on the shelf to
gather dust.
The gradual absorption of lih
eral arts terminology ihto the sci
entific jargon is another indica
tion of its decline to an "inferior"
position.
But the humanities remain in
teresting to the scholar and a few
others who see for the first time
"what we could have been if we
wern't what we are." In the eyes
of the humanist, "all human be
ings can aspire to be human."
As to the relationship of the
humanities to the other two
branches all he asks is "To what

to the people of our society due

Mark Schorer, professor of
English at the University of Cali
fornia, well presented the familiar
topic of the sinking value of the
humanities under the title "The
Harassed Humanities" in last
night's Tuesday Series.
The rise of the sciences, social
sciences and the humanities was
broken down to represent imper
sonal objects, group relationships,
and the study of man as individ
ual men. Only through the hu
manities may the knowledge of
the other two be evolved into wis
dom, stated Schorer, but the lack
of interest in this branch is ap
palling.
People Untouched
In referring to Lewis' books,
Schorer pointed out that the char
acters were people untouched by
the humanities, tinged with the
stain of inhuman qualities. The
characters are middle-class he
roes, vacant social types forming
mere protective groups in a non
social world. In these worlds de
void of human values, only social
monsters and living death pre
vail.
The study of the humanities
comprises a study of all sources
tracing the history of man, his
environment, and his experiences.
Schorer took the values of hu
manities to be represented as the
values of a woman, and the crea
tion and continuity of the human
ities became represented by a
"seed-planting She" of all time.
But with her in her beginnings
was her caveman mate and his
axe, helping her to found civiliza
tion.
AH Has Vanished
In the eyes of the Renaissance
portraits there is the sign of self
assurance and self-confidence in
individuality, but in today's art.
even the recognizable and noble
man has vanished in abstraction
and symmetry.
Schorer went on to note that,
this same overshadowing of man
has tended to make himself lose
his stature as a man. The lack of
creative challenge results in
courses such as "The Use of
Deodorants" and "Marriageable
You," offered in our schools to
day. We too easily permit our
selves to slide to the "other di
rectedness" of the masses. The
threat of scientific supremacy
puts Homer back on the shelf to
gather dust.
The gradual absorption of lih
eral arts terminology ihto the sci
entific jargon is another indica
tion of its decline to an "inferior"
position.
But the humanities remain in
teresting to the scholar and a few
others who see for the first time
"what we could have been if we
wern't what we are." In the eyes
of the humanist, "all human be
ings can aspire to be human."
