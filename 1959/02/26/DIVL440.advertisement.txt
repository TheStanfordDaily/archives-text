Jockey Underwear
What's true about expressions is also true about styles.
Somebody always got there first. Take Jockey brand under
wear. Jockey brand is made only by Coopers. Coopers
invented Jockey underwear —and no copy can compare
with Jockey brand for qualify, comfort and fit. For under
wear that feels better because it fits better, insist on Jockey
brand — the original comfort-tailored underwear. You'll
find it at better stores everywhere. Recognize it by the
Jockey trade mark. >
