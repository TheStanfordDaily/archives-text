ferer! clarification here Wednes
day regarding the festival, to bo
held in Vienna July 27 to Aug. 7.
Harold Bokken. director of the
foreign student leadership project
of the National Students Associa
tion, discussed with ASSU • lIR
president Arden Shenker the ri
valry of the Chicago and New
York groups which are bolh try
ing to enroll official delegates to
the Communist• dominated festi
val.
Bokken said, "The New York
group is a branch of the interna
tional preparatory committee,
which is clearly operating as a
Communist front." The Chicago
group seems unstable and its prin
ciples are not clear, he added.
At present it. appears that the
quota of 400 U.S. delegates will go
to the New York group.
Although both these organiza
tions are trying to send official
delegations, Shpnker and Bokken
suggested that well-qualified, ar
ticulate students who are plan
ning to be in Vienna at the time
of live festival might be able to
fulfill a valuable role there. In
this way, according to Shenker,
they would avoid "submitting to
the restrictions and uses of the
festival."
Students interested in attending
the festival are advised to call
Shenker at the lIIt for further in
formation.
