# New Scratch Sheet: Thoughtful
## 
### Diana Smith, Managing Editor 
The lone of the revived Scratch Sheet is con
structive; the majority of its course evaluations
are thoughtful and, where the writer's experience
can be a guide, rather accurate.
It* Preface says:"The purpose (if the Scratch
Sheet is to present evaluations of general elective
courses in an effort to maintain high academic
standards by informing Ihe students concerning
their relative merits and by presenting criticism
aimed at stimulating our professors to re evaluate
those courses which appear to be deficient."
The editors add that their larger purpose is to
". . . perpetuate the critical evaluation of all as
pects of life at Stanford University."
"Seems Justified"
Admittedly subject to limitations of sampling
technique, the Scratch Sheet seems justified never
theless, on the basis of the evaluations it has
produced, in asserting that ". . . the compilations
of these evaluations arc worthy of consideration,
particularly because we found the views of each
set of contributors to be remarkably consistent."
Courses surveyed in the present scope of the
Scratch Sheet an primarily at introductory and
intermediate levels. Commentary concerns itself
with each course's separate aspects: lecture qual
ity, kind and amount of reading, type of papers
and examinations.
But in addition- probably the single most sig
nificant thing about the Scratch Sheet commen

tary also looks at each course as a whole, attempt
ing to explain what each sets out lo do, and how
successfully that is accomplished.
The things which contributors have chosen lo
talk about as they discuss courses demonstrate
the caliber of I heir educational concern.
For example, they have noted the fact wherever
professors incorporate discussion into their lec
tures, and they repeatedly imply thai section dis
cussions are generally successful in proportion lo
the number of interested and interesting section
leaders available.
Approves of Imaginative Analysis
Wherever the contributors have fell that papers
and examinations require imaginative analysis,
thai observation is recorded with approval; those
papers and examinations which demand summary
writing and rote memory are so described.
This Scratch Sheet's editorial deals with the
speech of the President of the University lo the
student body on Jan. 8. Although the editorial
overmakes its point In places, it justly requests
that those who are in a position to know the Uni
versity's aims and present situation discuss truly
relevant educational issues honestly atid compre
hensively with Stanford students, without benefit
of an extremely ably effected, but unsatisfying,
gloss.
The Scratch Sheet is on sale today through Mon
day, D to 5, at Engineering Corner and the Cellar.
The price is 15 cents.

(See editorial, page 2)
The lone of the revived Scratch Sheet is con
structive; the majority of its course evaluations
are thoughtful and, where the writer's experience
can be a guide, rather accurate.
It* Preface says:"The purpose (if the Scratch
Sheet is to present evaluations of general elective
courses in an effort to maintain high academic
standards by informing Ihe students concerning
their relative merits and by presenting criticism
aimed at stimulating our professors to re evaluate
those courses which appear to be deficient."
The editors add that their larger purpose is to
". . . perpetuate the critical evaluation of all as
pects of life at Stanford University."
"Seems Justified"
Admittedly subject to limitations of sampling
technique, the Scratch Sheet seems justified never
theless, on the basis of the evaluations it has
produced, in asserting that ". . . the compilations
of these evaluations arc worthy of consideration,
particularly because we found the views of each
set of contributors to be remarkably consistent."
Courses surveyed in the present scope of the
Scratch Sheet an primarily at introductory and
intermediate levels. Commentary concerns itself
with each course's separate aspects: lecture qual
ity, kind and amount of reading, type of papers
and examinations.
But in addition- probably the single most sig
nificant thing about the Scratch Sheet commen

tary also looks at each course as a whole, attempt
ing to explain what each sets out lo do, and how
successfully that is accomplished.
The things which contributors have chosen lo
talk about as they discuss courses demonstrate
the caliber of I heir educational concern.
For example, they have noted the fact wherever
professors incorporate discussion into their lec
tures, and they repeatedly imply thai section dis
cussions are generally successful in proportion lo
the number of interested and interesting section
leaders available.
Approves of Imaginative Analysis
Wherever the contributors have fell that papers
and examinations require imaginative analysis,
thai observation is recorded with approval; those
papers and examinations which demand summary
writing and rote memory are so described.
This Scratch Sheet's editorial deals with the
speech of the President of the University lo the
student body on Jan. 8. Although the editorial
overmakes its point In places, it justly requests
that those who are in a position to know the Uni
versity's aims and present situation discuss truly
relevant educational issues honestly atid compre
hensively with Stanford students, without benefit
of an extremely ably effected, but unsatisfying,
gloss.
