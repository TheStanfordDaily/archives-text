# AWS Submits New Plan For Women's Housing
## Calls for Class Drawings Early in Spring Quarter 
### Rita Robison 
For Iho first time in well over a decade, Stanford undergraduate
women will have a workable, equitable and long-term housing policy
which incorporates the principles of integration and continuity and
the credit goes to the women themselves.
From student recommendations ad suggestions, the AWS Student-

Faculty Housing Committee drew
up a housing policy and submitted
it to the Faculty Committee on
Residence Policy, which approved
it and subsequently submitted the
plan to President Sterling, recom
mending his approval of it.
The AWS recommendation, in
mimeographed form, has been
distributed to the women's resi
dences and can be read in detail
there. In brief, early in spring
quarter all present freshman,
sophomore and junior women will
draw according to the present sys
tem of listing all residences in
order of preference.
Residence Placement
Women will be placed in the
residences of their preference de
pending upon the number they
draw, provided their class quota
(the class status of any group be
ing that of the status of the wom
en with the least number of units)
has not been filled.
For example, should a senior, a
junior and a sophomore draw to
gether, their number would be
drawn from the sophomore class
allotment, but each woman would
be counted in her own class quota
for that residence in which the
group is placed.
If the senior quota for that resi
dence has already been filled, the
group would be placed in the resi
dence listed next on their drawing
sheet, provided the class quotas
had not been filled for any of the
three classes.
The class quota for each resi
dence will be determined by allot
ting 40 per cent of the house ca
pacity for sophomores and 30 per
cent each for juniors and seniors,
providing some flexibility in order
that an arithmetical quota would
not work out to 34sophomores.
Continuity Stressed
The plan emphasizes the desira
bility of remaining in one resi
dence after the initial drawing for
sophomore assignment. However,
the plan clearly states that "any
woman or group of two women
who desire to move once at any
time after their original sopho
more assignment should have the
opportunity to do so."
There will be a drawing at the
end of each quarter, and there
will be NO requirement for wom
en desiring to change their resi
dence to file reasons or petitions.
They WILL be required to state
the number of previous moves
made after their initial drawing,
and a repeated mover will have to
draw individually and will have a
lower "preference" placement. In
other words, with each successive
move, the likelihood that a woman
will be able to draw into the resi
dence of her preference becomes
increasingly unlikely.

"Placement preference" is no
longer based on class status i.e.,
no more "senior priority"--but
rather on the drawing number and
excepting Stuttgart, women,
sponsors and "old girls returning"
-on the number of times a wom
an has changed residence. If you
have moved only once, you will be
given placement preference over
those women who have moved two
or three times.
Each woman should read the
first three pages of the housing
plan in order to have time to de
cide if she wishes to draw singly
or with a group (limited to six
girls, with the exception of the
initial transitional drawing, in
which senior women will be al
lowed to draw in groups of 10).
The provision for larger group
drawing was made so thai groups
of close friends could live togeth
er for as long as three years.
Improvements (Considered
The last two pages of the plan
contain recommended improve
mentsâ€”physical and general.
They are not, however, an in
tegral part of the housing plan
itself. They have not been includ
ed in the faculty committee's rec
ommendation to the president.
