bone and tooth were recently
found is contemplated, according
to Dr. Karl Packard of the geol
ogy department who identified
the finds.
"We know and have known for
a long time that, there were large
numbers of mammoths roaming
over North America during the
Ice Age," Packard said.
There were two varieties near
this region, the Washington mam
moth and "we don't know how
far south that form ranged" â€¢
and the Imperial elephant, which
ranged in Mexico, and "there is
no reason why it shouldn't range
northward," Packard continued.
"1 suppose the bone belongs to
Stanford," Packard concluded,
"and the tooth has been returned
to Mr. Fischer, its finder."
