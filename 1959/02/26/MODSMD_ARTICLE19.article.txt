# Scratch Sheet Worthy
## 
### 
A (.koi I* OF sti di n is have produced the Scratch Sheet once again,
and we feci they should be complimented on their ellorts lo keep
in existence what can In* an extremely valuable publication.
The Scratch Sheet touches the problem of education at its very
core the courses and the professors themselves. \\ hile it is neces
sary and valuable to concern ourselves with the development ol
a housing system that will complement our education, or with the
problem ol relieving unnecessary pressure on students, it would
be a serious oversight not to examine the educational courses them
selves, because it is here, in the classroom with the professor, that
the student must be initially stimulated.
It is the professor and the course that must interest the student
in education itselfâ€”so much so that this interest will carry the
student beyond the pages of the textbook and into only those
courses which will provide a real challenge to his intelligence.
The Scratch Sheet could be his guide: damning professors who
lecture from the text, and courses that are nothing more than
recitations of facts given and regurgitated.
In addition to guiding students, it can hopefully challenge
professors into constantly bettering their courses.
In mundane terms, we're paying for an education; the Scratch
Sheet is a way we can ask for tlie best one possible.
We would also direct your attention to the editorial in this
issue of the Scratch Sheet. It contains comments on a speech by
President Sterling that >houhl have been said long ago.
The courses arc analyzed objectively and fairly ; we hope the
Scratch Sheet will be a permanent institution each I're-H eg Week.
