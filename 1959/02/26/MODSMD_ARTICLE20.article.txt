# Berlin Bombast
## 
### 
The LATEST Soviet challenge to the West — an ultimatum with a
time limit in effect, orders the Western powers to get out of
Berlin by May 27 or risk an atomic war.
In less than three months the U.S.S.R. threatens to turn over
administration of Berlin to the East German Democratic Republic,
whose puppet-president has stated that his regime will blockade
West Berlin if "proper respect"" is not paid his "sovereign re
public.""
Perhaps Russia is calling our bluff. However. Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary of Slate Dulles have pub
licly affirmed and reaffirmed their resolve not to abandon
the West Berliners. Should East Germany blockade access
to Berlin, "we will use all appropriate means" to break
through. Obviously, the chiefs of state are not going to
foolishly comfort themselves with the thought that Russia
will not carry through her threat.
There is considerable activity on the part of Great Britain,
France, West Germany and the United States to work out a mu
tually acceptable and comprehensive proposal to resolve this issue.
They have invited the Soviet Union to participate in a four-power
conference of foreign ministers, hopefully to take place before
May, and have suggested that East and West German "advisers'"
sit in on the talks. The hope is that, once the talks have started,
the Soviets will postpone action.
Attempting a poliey of flexibility, the West hopes to achieve
at least a propaganda victory in the Berlin talks by demonstrating
to the world that she was willing to make concessions to Russia
in exchange for similar cooperation from the Russians.
There is one span missing in the bridge leading to lier
lin talks under these condiitons, though: Khrushchev has
innocently and blandly claimed that "we Soviet people
have nothing to concede."
But, allowing for repairs on this missing span, we feel that the
West should realistically appraise any agreements the Soviets may
conclude. A 1955 U.S. Senate report of nearly 1,000 treaties and
agreements involving peace accords and fraternities entered into
by the Soviet Union states:
"In the 38 short years since the Soviet Union came into
existence, its government has broken its word to virtually
every country to which it ever gave a signed promise. . . .
It keeps no international promises at all, unless doing so
is clearly advantageous to the Soviet Union. '
We do not advocate a "no contact" rule with the Soviet Union,
on the grounds that her personal integrity is highly questionable.
However, we do urge that the West discard its complacency in
faithfully trusting in "the wrong shall fail, the right prevail."
The right will prevail — but only by being more informed, more
alert and, above all, more canny.

West should realistically appraise any agreements the Soviets may
conclude. A 1955 U.S. Senate report of nearly 1,000 treaties and
agreements involving peace accords and fraternities entered into
by the Soviet Union states:
"In the 38 short years since the Soviet Union came into
existence, its government has broken its word to virtually
every country to which it ever gave a signed promise. . . .
It keeps no international promises at all, unless doing so
is clearly advantageous to the Soviet Union. '
We do not advocate a "no contact" rule with the Soviet Union,
on the grounds that her personal integrity is highly questionable.
However, we do urge that the West discard its complacency in
faithfully trusting in "the wrong shall fail, the right prevail."
The right will prevail — but only by being more informed, more
alert and, above all, more canny.
The LATEST Soviet challenge to the West — an ultimatum with a
time limit in effect, orders the Western powers to get out of
Berlin by May 27 or risk an atomic war.
In less than three months the U.S.S.R. threatens to turn over
administration of Berlin to the East German Democratic Republic,
whose puppet-president has stated that his regime will blockade
West Berlin if "proper respect"" is not paid his "sovereign re
public.""
Perhaps Russia is calling our bluff. However. Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary of Slate Dulles have pub
licly affirmed and reaffirmed their resolve not to abandon
the West Berliners. Should East Germany blockade access
to Berlin, "we will use all appropriate means" to break
through. Obviously, the chiefs of state are not going to
foolishly comfort themselves with the thought that Russia
will not carry through her threat.
There is considerable activity on the part of Great Britain,
France, West Germany and the United States to work out a mu
tually acceptable and comprehensive proposal to resolve this issue.
They have invited the Soviet Union to participate in a four-power
conference of foreign ministers, hopefully to take place before
May, and have suggested that East and West German "advisers'"
sit in on the talks. The hope is that, once the talks have started,
the Soviets will postpone action.
Attempting a poliey of flexibility, the West hopes to achieve
at least a propaganda victory in the Berlin talks by demonstrating
to the world that she was willing to make concessions to Russia
in exchange for similar cooperation from the Russians.
There is one span missing in the bridge leading to lier
lin talks under these condiitons, though: Khrushchev has
innocently and blandly claimed that "we Soviet people
have nothing to concede."
But, allowing for repairs on this missing span, we feel that the
West should realistically appraise any agreements the Soviets may
