# Berlin Bombast
## 
### 
The I.ATF.ST Soviet challenge to tlie Went an ultimatum with a
time limit in effect, orders the Western powers to get out of
Berlin by May 27 or risk an atomic war.
In less than three months the 11.5.5. R. threatens to turn over
administration of Berlin to tlie Kast (Jerman Democratic Republic,
whose puppet-president has stated that his regime will blockade
West Berlin if "proper respect"" is not paid his "sovereign re
public.""
Perhaps Russia is calling our bluff. However. Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary of Slate Dulles have pub
licly affirmed and reaffirmed their resolve not to abandon
the II 'est lierliners. Should East Germany blockade access
to Merlin, "ice will use all appropriate means" to break
through. (Obviously, the chiefs of stale are not going to
foolishly comfort themselves with the thought thai Russia
will not carry through her threat.
There is considerable activity on the part of Great Britain,
France, West Germany and the United States to work out a mu
tually acceptable and comprehensive proposal to resolve this issue.
They have invited the Soviet Union to participate in a four-power
conference of foreign ministers, hopefully to take place before
May, and have suggested that Kast and West German "advisers'"
sit in on the talks. The hope is that, once the talks have started,
tlie Soviets will postpone action.
Attempting a poliey of flexibility, the \X est hopes to achieve
at least a propaganda victory in the Berlin talks by demonstrating
to the world that she was willing to make concessions to Russia
in exchange for similar cooperation from the Russians.
There is one span missing in the bridge leading to lier
lin talks under these condiitons, though: Khrushchev has
innocently and blandly claimed that "we Soviet people
have nothing to concede
But, allowing for repairs on this missing span, we feel that the
\v est should realistically appraise any agreements the Soviets may
conclude. A 1955 U.S. Senate report of nearly 1.000 treaties and
agreements involving peace accords and fraternities entered into
by the Soviet Union stales:
"//j the short years since the Soviet Union came into
existence, its government has broken its word to virtually
every country to which it ever gave a signed promise. . . .
It keeps no international promises at all, unless doing so
is clearly advantageous to the Soviet Union. '
We do not advocate a "no contact* rule with the Soviet Union,
on the grounds that her personal integrity is highly questionable.
However, we do urge that the West discard its complacency in
faithfully trusting in "the wrong shall fail, the right prevail.**
The right will prevail hut only bv being more informed, more
alert and, above all, more cunnv.

Attempting a poliey of flexibility, the \X est hopes to achieve
at least a propaganda victory in the Berlin talks by demonstrating
to the world that she was willing to make concessions to Russia
in exchange for similar cooperation from the Russians.
There is one span missing in the bridge leading to lier
lin talks under these condiitons, though: Khrushchev has
innocently and blandly claimed that "we Soviet people
have nothing to concede
But, allowing for repairs on this missing span, we feel that the
\v est should realistically appraise any agreements the Soviets may
conclude. A 1955 U.S. Senate report of nearly 1.000 treaties and
agreements involving peace accords and fraternities entered into
by the Soviet Union stales:
"//j the short years since the Soviet Union came into
existence, its government has broken its word to virtually
every country to which it ever gave a signed promise. . . .
It keeps no international promises at all, unless doing so
is clearly advantageous to the Soviet Union. '
We do not advocate a "no contact* rule with the Soviet Union,
on the grounds that her personal integrity is highly questionable.
However, we do urge that the West discard its complacency in
faithfully trusting in "the wrong shall fail, the right prevail.**
The right will prevail hut only bv being more informed, more
alert and, above all, more cunnv.
The I.ATF.ST Soviet challenge to tlie Went an ultimatum with a
time limit in effect, orders the Western powers to get out of
Berlin by May 27 or risk an atomic war.
In less than three months the 11.5.5. R. threatens to turn over
administration of Berlin to tlie Kast (Jerman Democratic Republic,
whose puppet-president has stated that his regime will blockade
West Berlin if "proper respect"" is not paid his "sovereign re
public.""
Perhaps Russia is calling our bluff. However. Presi

licly affirmed and reaffirmed their resolve not to abandon
the II 'est lierliners. Should East Germany blockade access
to Merlin, "ice will use all appropriate means" to break
through. (Obviously, the chiefs of stale are not going to
foolishly comfort themselves with the thought thai Russia
will not carry through her threat.
There is considerable activity on the part of Great Britain,
France, West Germany and the United States to work out a mu
tually acceptable and comprehensive proposal to resolve this issue.
They have invited the Soviet Union to participate in a four-power
conference of foreign ministers, hopefully to take place before
May, and have suggested that Kast and West German "advisers'"
sit in on the talks. The hope is that, once the talks have started,
