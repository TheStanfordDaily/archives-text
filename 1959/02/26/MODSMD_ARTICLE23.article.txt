KXMJ Clarified
l\ld it or, Tin* Daily:
The Daily, in its articles about
I he reorganization of Stanford's
radio station KZSU, has given the
wrong impression by omitting < er- j
tain facts relevant to the issue.
In doing this, The Daily has made
two major mistakes in reporting I
about the two proposals now un- 1
der consideration.
The first mistake is that the ar
ticles give the idea that one of the!
proposals was submitted by stu
dents and the olher one by the
Speech and Drama Department, j
It should be pointed oui that the,
proposal which the Speech and j
Drama Department submitted to I
the University was, to a very
great extent, the work and ideas i
of a committee of five staff mem
bers of KZSU, appointed to this
job by the general staff in a meet
ing last quarter.
This committee ( in addition to J
myself) included the chief engi
neer, the two program managers
and the business manager who

were in office at the close of last
spring quarter.
Enlarging the idea of paid per
sonnel into one of major impor
tance i-s the second mistake The
Daily has made. It was included
in the proposal of the Speech and
Drama Department only so that
no possibility would be overlooked
in reorganizing the station.
Whether it would be a solution

to the problems which KZSU faced
is not clear, and all concerned
J with the proposal felt ii was defi-
I nitely nut one of the better ideas.
| In the future, Mr. Wurfel might
! try to find out the other side of
i the story and do a little more re
i search into the matter before he
i writes his art ivies.
