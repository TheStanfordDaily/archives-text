1 lie OC I A-Sysrem
Kditor, The Daily:
It has recently become a policy
lo initiate new policies in keeping
with the policy of the progression
of modern education. To be brief,
our proposal is to revolutionize
the quarter system by completely
abandoning it to the OCTA-SYS
TKM. As implied, this would
mean eight octants instead of four
quarters each octant consisting
of approximately A 1 - weeks.
It is amazing that this method
has heretofore been unexploited,
especially when it is considered in
the light ol a growing propensity
toward an increasing number of
examinations. It is true that by
the time a student receives his
diploma he has or is assumed to
have acquired proficiency in the
science of test-taking, but this
goal has even greater potential
under the octa-system.
Instead of only 12 weeks of col
lege education being devoted to
finals, there would be 24, or, in a
simpler figure, six months. As for
midterms, they would start at the
end of the first week of the octant,
which would eliminate that un
necessarily leisurely period of
"getting adjusted."
By doubling the number of sub
jects taken, each student would
also become well acquainted with
a myriad of specialized subjects
in narrow fields. Needless to say,
this is quite in keeping with the
policy of preparing the student
for later life.
Besides, the course numbers
would go up into the 600's, which
would put Stanford in a rather
favorable light in comparing its
bulletin to those of other institu
t ions.
It h;is long been the complaint
that registration at the beginning
of each quarter is an annoying
series of waitings-in-line. With
twice as many registration peri
ods, students and Administration
alike would have ample opportu
nity to become quite familiar, and
thus increasingly efficient, in this
procedure.
The recently propounded policy
of "continuity" and "integration"
would also receive adequate ex
. l

pression under the octa-system. al
t hough new connotations to these
mottoes must he supplied. Rather
than live in one house for four
years, continuity would mean sys
tematic and regular shifting from
house to house every I,â€¢> weeks.
Students would he urged to live
out of suitcases in order to facili
tate a clock-like precision and ease
of fluid movement. In time, even
the present necessity of superflu
ous furniture could he avoided,
which would undoubtedly he ap
plauded hy harassed budget com
mittee members.
Integration would follow natu
rally by the turnover of new faces
each octant. Not only would each
student have many friends, but
there would be a good chance that
he would run into some of his
good friends every several oc
tants.
With the increased pace of stu
dent living, it would be advisable,
in order to preserve valuable min
utes, to serve lunch in 12 o'clock
classes. However, this and other
details would have to be worked
out accordingly with the octa-sys
tern as an integrated whole.
