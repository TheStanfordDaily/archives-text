# FOREIGN SCHOLAR COMMISSION
## Investigation Report Says Fraternities Don't Consider Visiting Students' Views 
### Barbara Hicks 
Communication with fraterni
ties has caused some difficulties
for I he Foreign Scholarship Com
mission in t lie past, but this
year's operation has run smooth
ly, with rare exceptions.
So showed the report of the
Legislature committee reviewing
the activities of the commission.
Co - chairmen Honnie Pomeroy
and Stove Breyer agreed with the
majority of the points made in
the report.
George Smith, off-campus Vil
lage representative; Sam Donald
son, Business School; and Bob
So 1 i. Engineering School, com
posed the committee which inter
viewed members of (he commis
sion and foreign scholars.
The committee submitted a first
report Feb. 12, but, as there were
disagreements between their find
ings and the 1 statements of Miss
Pomeroy at that time, the Legis
lature instructed them to review
I heir report.
Last week Donaldson said there
had been some errors of fact in
the first report which they cor
rected.
In discussing the situation with
the fraternities, Donaldson sug
gested to the commission that
I hey withhold approval of a for
eign student to live in a fraternity
until a roommate is assigned.
Breyer 1 pointed out th a t the
commission was not in a position
to dictate to the fraternities, but
could only hope for their coopera
tion. lie said that for next year
the commission needs 21 quarters
of residence for male scholars and
there have been 23 quarters of
tp re< I.
Breyer added that in most cases,
however, the fraternities were co
operating well. He explained that
a roommate for autumn quarter
is generally known by (he end of
the year, and that the roommate
and the fraternity president write
to Hit 1 scholar during the summer.
The commit tee also recommend
ed that the commission should
work even more closely with the
fraternities to reduce bad feelings
caused by inconsiderate action.
The committee suggested that
commission members discuss Hie
situation with the fraternity at
house meetings, or that the room
mates of foreign scholars com
pose a subcommittee of the com
mission.
Concerned over the lack of
scholars from South American
countries, the committee recom
mended that greater efforts
should bo made in that direction.
Breyer noted that announcements
are sent to several South Ameri
can universities, but that there
are vei\y few applicants.
Some oho letters are sent out
by the commission each year, and
I hey receive about 300 applica
tions. The commission narrows
these down to 20 or 30, with the
approval of the dean, and then
meets with representatives of the
living groups to determine who
will house the foreign scholars.
Brever said that selection for

next year's scholars will be made
this Sunday. The field ha-s been
narrowed to 17, of which 10 will
be chosen.
When scholars arrive on cam
pus they are oriented via a hostel
and meetings with University of
ficers.
The commission includes two
co-chairmen and eight members,
seven of whom are secretaries
who take care of correspondence,
talks given by the scholar*?, tours
and seminars, and fraternity liai
son.
The investigating committee

praised lire commission's plans I
for I lie reception of scholars when
they arrive in this country and in
arranging to permit scholars 1o
travel cross country in private
cars.
Committeemen also noted that
the"I" Center has been an asset
to scholars' enjoyment of the pro
gram.
Breyer and Miss Pomeroy said
that, on recommendation of the
committee, they will attempt to
discover how effective the dissem
ination of information is in other
count ries.

tion. lie said that for next year
the commission needs 21 quarters
of residence for male scholars and
there have been 23 quarters of
tp re< I.
Breyer added that in most cases,
however, the fraternities were co
operating well. He explained that
a roommate for autumn quarter
is generally known by (he end of
the year, and that the roommate
and the fraternity president write
to Hit 1 scholar during the summer.
The commit tee also recommend
ed that the commission should
work even more closely with the
fraternities to reduce bad feelings
caused by inconsiderate action.
The committee suggested that
commission members discuss Hie
situation with the fraternity at
house meetings, or that the room
mates of foreign scholars com
pose a subcommittee of the com
mission.
Concerned over the lack of
scholars from South American
countries, the committee recom
mended that greater efforts
should bo made in that direction.
Breyer noted that announcements
are sent to several South Ameri
can universities, but that there
are vei\y few applicants.
Some oho letters are sent out
by the commission each year, and
I hey receive about 300 applica
tions. The commission narrows
these down to 20 or 30, with the
approval of the dean, and then
meets with representatives of the
living groups to determine who
will house the foreign scholars.
Brever said that selection for

next year's scholars will be made
this Sunday. The field ha-s been
narrowed to 17, of which 10 will
be chosen.
When scholars arrive on cam
pus they are oriented via a hostel
and meetings with University of
ficers.
The commission includes two
co-chairmen and eight members,
seven of whom are secretaries
who take care of correspondence,
talks given by the scholar*?, tours
and seminars, and fraternity liai
son.
The investigating committee

praised lire commission's plans I
for I lie reception of scholars when
they arrive in this country and in
arranging to permit scholars 1o
travel cross country in private
cars.
Committeemen also noted that
the"I" Center has been an asset
to scholars' enjoyment of the pro
gram.
Breyer and Miss Pomeroy said
that, on recommendation of the
committee, they will attempt to
discover how effective the dissem
ination of information is in other
count ries.
