(iirls go lo college fur precisely the same reasons as men do:
In broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas. to drink at
the I'oiinl of wisdom. Hut if, by pure chance, wfiilc a girl is
engaged in these meritorious pursuits, a likely looking husband
should pop into view, why, what's wrong with that? Eli?
What's wrong with that?
The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a
husband? A urcat deal has been written on this subject. Some
say character i most important, some say background, some
iv appearance, some say education. All are wrong.
The most important thing -bar none in a husband is health.
Though In be handsome as Apollo and rich as Croesus, what,
good is he if lie just lie- around all day accumulating bedsores?

The very fir I thing 1o do upon mooting a man is to make
sure ho is sound of wind and limb. Before lie lias a chance to
sweet-talk you, slap a thermometer in his month, roll hack his
eyelids, yank out his tongue, rap his patella, palpate his thorax*,
ask him to straighten out ;i horseshoe with his teeth. If lie
fails these simple tests, phono for an ambulance and go on to
the next prospect.
If, however, lie turns out to ho physically fit, proceed to the
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to
a sense of humor.
A man who can't take a joke is a man to bo avoided. There
are several simple tests to find out whether your prospect can
take a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his t ires. ()r burn
his "Mad" comics. (>r steal his switchblade. < )r turn loose his
pet raccoon. Or shave his head.
After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and
-hout "April I'ool!" If ho replies, "But this is February nine
t< < nth," or something equally churlish, cross him off your list
and give thanks you found out in time.
Hut if ho laughs silverly and calls you "hiltlo minx!" put him
to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.
The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to
look at the cigarette Vie smokes. Is it mild? Is it clement? Is it
humane? Does it minister tenderly to the psyche? Does it
coddle the synapses? Is it a good companion? Is it genial? Is it
bright and friendly and full of dulcet pleasure from cockcrow
t ill I he heart of darkness?
I- it, in short, Philip Morris?
If Philip Morris it be, then clasp the man to your bosom with
hoops of steel, for you may bo sure that he is kindly as a sum
mer breeze, kindl} as a mother's kiss, kindly to his very marrow.
And now, having found a man who is kindly and healthy and
blessed wit h a sen<e of humor, the only thing that remains is to
make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That, fortu
nately, i easy. Just enroll him in engineering. <c, m», M.tShuim.n

are several simple tests to find out whether your prospect can
take a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his t ires. ()r burn
his "Mad" comics. (>r steal his switchblade. < )r turn loose his
pet raccoon. Or shave his head.
After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and
-hout "April I'ool!" If ho replies, "But this is February nine
t< < nth," or something equally churlish, cross him off your list
and give thanks you found out in time.
Hut if ho laughs silverly and calls you "hiltlo minx!" put him
to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.
The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to
look at the cigarette Vie smokes. Is it mild? Is it clement? Is it
humane? Does it minister tenderly to the psyche? Does it
coddle the synapses? Is it a good companion? Is it genial? Is it
bright and friendly and full of dulcet pleasure from cockcrow
t ill I he heart of darkness?
I- it, in short, Philip Morris?
If Philip Morris it be, then clasp the man to your bosom with
hoops of steel, for you may bo sure that he is kindly as a sum
mer breeze, kindl} as a mother's kiss, kindly to his very marrow.
And now, having found a man who is kindly and healthy and
blessed wit h a sen<e of humor, the only thing that remains is to
make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That, fortu
