Provided lho California sunshine continues to shine the rest of
the week, Stanford tennis fans will have an opportunity to see an
excellent preview of this year's tennis team and at the same time
have a chance to see several of the best net players in Northern Cali
fornia.
The event that will supply all of this is the Northern California
Intercollegiate Tennis Championship which is being held at Stanford
starling yesterday and with the finals on Saturday.
Last year the tournament was completely dominated by Stanford
| with the Indians gaining the highest number of points possible. All
eight of the Stanford entries gained quarter-final singles berths last
year and the four Stanford doubles teams made up the semi-finals.
This year however the Indians' road won't be nearly as easy. The
first problem lacing Stanford's Metiers will be the much stronger
field that this year's tournament holds. San Jose for one comes in
with a much stronger team this year led by nationally ranked Whit
ney Reed. Along with Whit the Spartans will have a pair of players,
Jim Watson and Nick Sharf, who were the top men for San Fran
cisco City College last year. Both of these men are highly regarded
in the Bay Area. Last year Watson was the only player to defeat
Stanford's Dick Ogden in a regularly scheduled match.
Reed, however, is I he real man to watch. He has had plenty of
tennis experience (he's now 25, having started at CSC six years ago
and switching to San .lose, after a stint in the service. Reed has been
in the nation's top ten for the last three years and will definitely be
the favorite to take this year's singles championship.

On top of being an ace player Reed has a reputation as being a
real court comedian. Many experts feel that Reed's desire to have a
I good time on the court has hindered his tennis progress. Whether
this is so remains to be seen but Reed's antics make him one of the
j most popular players in the eyes of the spectators.
Along with the stronger team from San Jose there also looms a
tough squad from IVlenio JC. The Mcnlo squad brags of Davis Cupper
Cliris Crawford and a very highly regarded Southern Californian
named Bruce Campbell.
Crawford is one of the best young tennis players in the world.
He plays the real big game that has become so popular with the
successes of Pancho Gonzales and Lew lload. There one hitch, how
ever: both of these boys from Menlo may be forced to play in the
freshman rather than the varsity tourney.
Besides this added competition the Stanford team has suddenly
been faced with unexpected losses from ihe squad.
Brooks Rawlins, who is not in school this quarter, will be back
for the I'CC season next quarter but his presence will be missed in
1he Northern Cal event. Along w ith Rawlins, Stanford will be minus
the services of promising sophomore Norm Karns. Karns has had
a bit of scholastic trouble and, although he like Rawlins will be ready
to go next quarter, Stanford will not be able to use him in the
tourney.
Depth Helps
Fortunately this year's Stanford team was blessed with good
; depth and Dick Mosk and Gil Ranney have stepped in to lake Raw
lins' and Karns' places.
The ofhei Indians who make up the seven-man team, Dave Nelson,
Dick Ogden, Lowell Carruth, Jim Jeffries and Dick Gould, have been
described by Coach Renker as having the potential to be the best
team in Stanford tennis history.
Nelson has moved in to fill the shoes of Jack Douglas and figures
I to do a good job.
Nelson was the only PCC netter to come close to beating Davis
Cup ace Alex Olmedo in last year's conference championships. Dave
; garnered one set in the three-set match with thâ„¢ big Peruvian and
i had a service break lead in the third set before the more experienced
Olmedo prevailed. A final match between Reed and Nelson would
be a spectator's delight.
Stanford's biggest hopes will be in the doubles. Both of the In
dians' top doubles combos, Nelson and Ogden and Carruth and Jef
rries, will be the favorites to be the tourney's finalists. Both of these
teams have real finesse and they could he the strong point that could
carry Stanford to the NorCal title.
