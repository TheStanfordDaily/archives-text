# WSC, SC Next Card Foes
## 
### 
All but mathematically out of the Pacific Coast Conference basket
ball chase, the Stanford Indians will attempt to cinch an above-.500
record this weekend when the last-place Washington State Cougars
and the Southern California Trojans visit the Pavilion.
The Cards saw their title hopes dashed and their record dip to 7-6

last week with a pair of losses in
the southland, and now a little
glory is about all that's left to
salvage.
Not since 1956 have the Indians
won more conference games than
they have lost. One victory in the
three remaining games (tlie Tribe
hosts Oregon State next week)
would assure at least an even .51)0
mark.
s< Hack
This Saturday the Indians will
gel a shot at their conquerors of
last week, Southern California.
USC' was hitting on all cylinders
at tiie Pan-Pacific last week, and,
coupled with the Cards' most dis
mal field shooting exhibition in
years, it all turned out an easy
71-52 triumph for Troy.
Coach Forrest Twogood will
bring the PCC's No. 4 scorer, jun
ior forward John Werhas, to the
Pavilion, plus at least five more
consistent scorers.
Werhas delivered 23 points
against the Indians last Friday
and has now raised his loop mark
to 17 a game. Seconding that per
formance against Stanford was
junior center find Bob Hampton,
who pumped home 19 points for
his season's high.
In Cellar
Tomorrow night Stanford will
go in against the league's usual
cellar-dwellers, Washington State.
The Indians opened up the loop

campaign last month with a fat
7>9- lO romp over the Cougs and
things haven't been much differ
ent for WSC since.
Nevertheless, this is one of the
PCC's most improved fives. The
Cougars' lone victories this year
( they've lost II) were revenge
inspired wins over UCLA and
USC in Pullman. II was Ihe e
soulhland schools that blocked the
Cougar l'oo Iha 11 team from receiv
ing a Rose Howl bid last fall.
Coach Marv llarshman, in his
first year at Pullman after many
fabulous seasons at little Pacific
Lutheran, has made the '59 Cou
gars a somewhat more sound ball
club I ban the one Jack Friel left
behind last year.
In preseason action the Cougars
defeated both Gon/.aga and Mon
tana State, a pair of clubs which
hold victories over top-ranked Se
attle.
Same Team
The big men in the cast for this
year's WSC fiv-e are pretty much
the same as last season: 6-6 cen
ter John Maras. currently sixth in
PCC rebounding and 11th in scor
ing; 5-N speedball guard Jimmy
Ross; sophomore Frank Reed, one
of the surprises of the attack
he's averaging 10.2 points a game.
Biggest surprise, however, has
been junior forward Duane Ran
niger, an 5.3 scorer this season.
Ranniger is a hustler too much
of one. His 56 personal fouls put
him way out in front of the pack
in the PCC's hatchet department.
Other Cougar vets are senior
forward Dick Axelson, who has
averaged 9.-1 points, and senior
guard Mcrt Kennedy.
