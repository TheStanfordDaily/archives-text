kIKV, I krainc (AP) —British Crime Minister Harold Mae
millan ami So-viet Premier \ikila khrushchev ended talks Thurs
day in an atmosphere of hitter chill. The British visitor warned
Khrushchev of grave danger if anyone interferes with the West
ern powers' rights in Berlin.
"lint khrushehev is not budging an inch," a British spokesman
said, "and Maemillan is not budging an inch, either. Make of that
what you will."
Before flying here for a visit, Maemillan told Khrushchev that any
interference without some alternative arrangements "would lead to
a dangerous situation," the spokesman said.
Such alternative arrangements supposedly would meet the Soviet
threat to turn over to East Germany the control of Allied lifelines

to isolated Berlin. These would
have to come through negotia
tions, in Macmillan's view.
Khrushchev's speech to a politi
cal rally in the Kremlin Tuesday
heaped ridicule on the Western
plan for negotiations at the for
eign ministers' level. In that
speech Khrushchev warned that
any violations of East Germany's
borders in a dispute over Berlin
would be considered an act of ag
gression.
Door Still Open
Despite the tenor of Khru
shchev's remarks, the spokesman
insisted, in reply to a reporter's
question, that Macmillan does not
believe the Soviet loader has shut
the door on a foreign ministers'
meeting.
But the Kremlin speech, coming
at the height of the British visit,
so stung Macmillan that he
thought of breaking off further
talks and returning to London,
British sources reported.
"But Macmillan came here to
have talks with the Soviet leaders
and to see the country," a British
official said. "He had the talks
and he decided he might as well
see the country."
Final Meeting
There will be a final meeting
with Khrushchev Monday after
Macmillan returns from visits to
Kiev and Leningrad. But the Brit
ish spokesman said there i-s noth
ing left to talk about except the
wording of a final communique.
It had been expected that the
Kiev trip would provide another
opportunity for talks between the
two leaders. But at the last mo
ment Khrushchev canceled his
plans to accompany Macmillan,
and stayed in Moscow. There he
received a delegation from Iraq.
Tooth Trouble
Khrushchev told Macmillan at
the meeting Thursday morning
that, he had a tooth which re
quired attention and he would
have to give up the trip, the Brit
ish spokesman said.
He insisted that this was no
breach of diplomatic courtesy,
since Khrushchev had not origi
nally planned to accompany Mac
millan. But diplomats wondered
whether Khrushchev's toothache
was real or diplomatic.

millan ami So-viet Premier \ikila khrushchev ended talks Thurs
day in an atmosphere of hitter chill. The British visitor warned
Khrushchev of grave danger if anyone interferes with the West
ern powers' rights in Berlin.
"lint khrushehev is not budging an inch," a British spokesman
said, "and Maemillan is not budging an inch, either. Make of that
what you will."
Before flying here for a visit, Maemillan told Khrushchev that any
interference without some alternative arrangements "would lead to
a dangerous situation," the spokesman said.
Such alternative arrangements supposedly would meet the Soviet
threat to turn over to East Germany the control of Allied lifelines

to isolated Berlin. These would
have to come through negotia
tions, in Macmillan's view.
Khrushchev's speech to a politi
cal rally in the Kremlin Tuesday
heaped ridicule on the Western
plan for negotiations at the for
eign ministers' level. In that
speech Khrushchev warned that
any violations of East Germany's
borders in a dispute over Berlin
would be considered an act of ag
gression.
Door Still Open
Despite the tenor of Khru
shchev's remarks, the spokesman
insisted, in reply to a reporter's
question, that Macmillan does not
believe the Soviet loader has shut
the door on a foreign ministers'
meeting.
But the Kremlin speech, coming
at the height of the British visit,
so stung Macmillan that he
thought of breaking off further
talks and returning to London,
British sources reported.
"But Macmillan came here to
have talks with the Soviet leaders
and to see the country," a British
official said. "He had the talks
and he decided he might as well
see the country."
Final Meeting
There will be a final meeting
with Khrushchev Monday after
Macmillan returns from visits to
Kiev and Leningrad. But the Brit
ish spokesman said there i-s noth
ing left to talk about except the
wording of a final communique.
It had been expected that the
Kiev trip would provide another
opportunity for talks between the
two leaders. But at the last mo
ment Khrushchev canceled his
plans to accompany Macmillan,
and stayed in Moscow. There he
received a delegation from Iraq.
Tooth Trouble
Khrushchev told Macmillan at
the meeting Thursday morning
that, he had a tooth which re
quired attention and he would
have to give up the trip, the Brit
ish spokesman said.
He insisted that this was no
breach of diplomatic courtesy,
since Khrushchev had not origi
nally planned to accompany Mac
millan. But diplomats wondered
whether Khrushchev's toothache
was real or diplomatic.
