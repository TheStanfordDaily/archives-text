## Personally Speaking Fraternities' Role at Stanford

. . Social and academic prob
lems . . . have grown up in the
fraternity system" Is the way
President Wallace Sterling de
scribes one part of the fraternity
problem in a recent pamphlet en
titled "Fraternities at Stanford";
and the Administration's answer
to this problem is the fraternity
cluster system.
Perhaps this is a good time to
review the cluster program and
see just how it will attempt to
solve this problem and develop
fraternities into a positive force
on campus.
The other part of the fraterni
ties' problem is adequate housing;
the clusters obviously will lake
care of this.
Before proceeding, it woul d
seem in order to try to suggest
what is meant by "a positive force
on campus." While this is a rather
nebulous thing, the pamphlet has
a few statements that might help
clarify the term:
"The purpose [of undergradu
ate living] has been to make resi
dence life contribute directly to
the educational and cultural goals
of the University."
And: '"An intellectual and
friendly atmosphere in living
groups would be conducive to high
scholastic achievement and the
stimulation of interest in cultural
activities such as the theater, art
and literature."
Fraternities will always be dis
tinguished from other living
groups by their social program,
and rightly so. Developing them
into a more positive force on cam
pus would mean bringing the so
cial and educational aspects of
fraternities into a more equitable
balance.
Evidence of this imbalance isn't
too hard to find. Most houses
maintain evening study rooms on

Quad; and in some houses not
all, of course some members
seem to feel they must move off
campus to bring up a grade point
average.
How will the cluster system at
tempt to correct the social and
academic aspects of the problem?
• The design of the houses
themselves pr o vi d e s adequate
study space away from the main
living room, in a suite of two
rooms for two guys.
• The atmosphere of the new
houses itself should help. Eight
een of the 24 present houses don't
meet'the modern building code
and many are in need of very seri
ous repair.
• A faculty residence is planned
along with each cluster of four
fraternities, in an attempt to
bring faculty and students closer
together.
But, any way you look at it, the
fact actually remains: the cluster
system won't solve the problem
entirely. It's the guys themselves
who have to WANT their "resi
dence life [to] contribute directly
to the educational and cultural
goals of the University." This de
sire can't be bought with new
houses or coerced with words.
It's this writer's opinion that
this desire does exist. We've wit
nessed numerous .social projects
undertaken by the fraternities.
The Kids' Day during this Greek
Week, treating crippled children
to a football game, etc. —these are
laudable things.
Maybe the new clusters will be
enough to bring the fraternities
into the stream of education that
Stanford is following.
We hope so, because fraterni
ties can be and should be the
finest expression of what small
group living can mean and accom-
I plish — they have a real place at
i Stanford, if they'll fill it.
